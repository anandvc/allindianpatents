				<td>DEVICE AND METHOD FOR ENHANCEMENT OF SUPERFINISHING<br>
USING A PULSATING FLEXIBLE MAGNETIC ABRASIVE BRUSH<br>
The present invention relates to a pulsating flexible magnetic abrasive<br>
brush for use in superfinishing processes involved in the manufacture of<br>
advanced engineering materials. The present invention also relates to a method<br>
for the enhancement of superfinishing of advanced engineering materials by a<br>
pulsating flexible magnetic abrasive brush.<br>
Various components of advanced engineering materials such as silicon<br>
nitride, aluminium oxide, and semiconductors in extremely low surface<br>
roughness (few nano meters) and high form accuracy are in demand in advanced<br>
industrial fields, especially in ultra precision manufacturing industries.<br>
Conventional techniques are incapable to superfinish these materials. One of the<br>
processes developed for this purpose was the magnetic abrasive finishing (MAP)<br>
process. The applications of super finishing are in the finishing of bearings,<br>
precision automotive components, shafts, artificial hip joints, and similar other<br>
components.<br>
The basic principle of magnetic abrasive finishing is that iron particles<br>
mechanically homogeneously mixed with SiC abrasives in a certain ratio are<br>
attracted by magnetic field in the finishing zone, and they are joined with each<br>
other along the lines of magnetic field due to dipole-dipole interaction and<br>
forming flexible magnetic abrasive brush (FMAB) which pushes against the work<br>
piece surface to develop finishing pressure to realize micro cutting by relative<br>
motion. The flexible means employed comprises a magnetic abrasive brush<br>
formed as a single body which adapts the contour of workpiece surface being<br>
finished.<br>
FMAB behavior is related to the magnetic field. The field strength is<br>
constant at a particular smooth direct current (D.C.) in a specified finishing zone<br>
due to constant magnetizing energy. Hence, at a specified constant current, the<br>
FMAB strength will remain the same and correspondingly the positions of<br>
abrasive grains trapped in the matrix of iron particles get unchanged. The<br>
trapped abrasive grains become dull in due course of time. But in the case of<br>
pulsed D.C. supply, the field strength would be pulsating and hence the<br>
formation and breaking of FMAB would take place at pulsed D.C. frequency.<br>
Therefore, refreshment/jumbling of abrasive grains would take place which<br>
brings new cutting edges of grains. Hence, material removal and surface finish<br>
get enhanced significantly as compared to the smooth D.C. supply. It is felt that<br>
pulsed current influences magnetic field behavior, FMAB, and abrasive grain<br>
behavior within the finishing zone.<br>
Most prior art work has focused on finishing characteristic using the<br>
surface roughness profile as a measure by chopping off the direct current supply<br>
to the magnet or using AC magnetic field. The idea of using pulsed DC current<br>
to the electromagnet is to see the effect of formation and breaking of magnetic<br>
brush in the finishing zone at different pulsed parameters. The configuration of<br>
the brush basically governs the material removal and surface roughness. In<br>
depth research findings in this direction have not been reported in the literature.<br>
The present invention provides an improvement comprising a pulsating<br>
flexible magnetic abrasive brush. Initial preliminary experimentation have been<br>
conducted successfully to find out pulsed parameters affecting surface finish and<br>
to know the process behavior. Then pulsed parameters were designed<br>
statistically and experiments conducted to analyze finishing on the plane surface<br>
of ferromagnetic work piece. The finishing mechanism of the invention was<br>
tested and the in process behaviour of magnetic force was studied. The magnetic<br>
force and cutting force, both being utilized in the finishing operation, have been<br>
measured on-line by in-house designed and fabricated a precise force transducer.<br>
This transducer uses a strain gauge signal conditioner unit and Lab view<br>
software, a complete use of virtual instrumentation unit. The pulsed current<br>
with different duty cycles and on-time, and their corresponding on-line force<br>
behavior has been found helpful to understand the behavior of cutting edges of<br>
the abrasive particles. The setup for MAP with Pulsating Magnetic Abrasive<br>
Brush has been designed and fabricated. The schematic view of the set up is<br>
shown in Fig. 1. The pulsed generator is connected across the electromagnet.<br>
The pulsed voltage and current has been measured by 2-channels digital storage<br>
oscilloscope.<br>
Experiments were conducted as per the condition given below and<br>
relationship between percentage change in surface roughness with duty cycles<br>
for a constant on-time has been established as shown in Fig.2. The results show<br>
that percentage change in surface roughness increases remarkably with increase<br>
in duty cycles. It is justified as follows: the duty cycle of a single pulse is defined<br>
as the ratio of on-time to the total pulsed time (on +off)-time. For a constant ontime,<br>
if duty cycle increases off-time decreases. Hence, FMAB will get more time<br>
to get deformed and again during on-time it will get formed. The formation and<br>
breaking of brush increases in less duty cycle which promotes grains stirring<br>
effect within FMAB resulting in increased intermittent microcutting. As a result,<br>
material removal increases resulting in increased % change in surface roughness.<br>
The atomic force micrographs (Fig.3a and 3b) show clearly the significant stirring<br>
effect of the FMAB due to formation and breaking of the brush at pulsed<br>
frequency.<br>
Comparatively low forces act on the work surface. As a result the finish is<br>
without surface defects<br>
The finishing of advanced engineering materials by smooth flexible<br>
magnetic abrasive brush (FMAB) is a developed process in recent past. The<br>
abrasive grains trapped in iron matrix become dull in due course of time during<br>
finishing. In the present invention, however, the grains are refreshed due to the<br>
on and off nature of the pulsed current by setting pulsed parameters during<br>
finishing resulting enhanced rate of surface finishing. To the best of the<br>
applicants knowledge, such method has not been attempted in the art heretofore.<br>
The basic principle of magnetic abrasive finishing is that iron particles<br>
mechanically homogeneously mixed with SiC abrasives in a certain ratio are<br>
attracted by magnetic filed in the finishing zone, and they are joined with each<br>
other along the lines of magnetic field due to dipole-dipole interaction and<br>
forming flexible magnetic abrasive brush (FMAB) which pushes against the work<br>
piece surface to develop finishing pressure to realize micro cutting by relative<br>
motion. Here flexible means the magnetic abrasive brush as a single body adapts<br>
the contour of workpiece surface being finished.<br>
In the method of the invention, the effect of formation and breaking of<br>
flexible magnetic brush in the finishing zone at different pulsed parameters was<br>
studied when a pulsed DC current was provided to the electromagnet. The<br>
configuration of the brush basically governs the material removal and surface<br>
toughness. During the work on the MAB process, it was observed that the rate of<br>
finishing is comparatively low. This is believed to be due to the fact that abrasive<br>
particles wear out and the same wornout particles are continuously in contact<br>
with the workpiece, thereby reducing the rate of finishing. As a result, several<br>
tests were carried out to devise methods to replace/refresh the abrasive grains<br>
trapped in the FMAB during finishing in order to bring fresh particles in contact<br>
with workpiece and in order to remove the material significantly faster from the<br>
peaks of the workpiece resulting smoothened surface.<br>
Finishing, cleaning, debutting and burnishing of metal and advanced<br>
engineering material parts are the end operations on any products. The<br>
derivable products from the invention can be used in high technology engineering<br>
products such as precision industries including, aerospace, semiconductors, etc. The<br>
process and device of the invention has an advantage over prior art processes such as<br>
abrasive flow machining and MRAFF since, by adding/mounting an MAP<br>
attachment to an existing machine like a vertical milling machine or drilling machine,<br>
submicron finishing can be easily performed.<br>
Turning now to Figure 1 which is a schematic representation of the device of<br>
the invention, a pulsed power generator is connected in series to an electromagnetic<br>
coil and through a magnetic pulse inducer to a 2-channel DSO, which in turn is<br>
connected to a computational machine such as a computer. The electromagnet has a<br>
coil and is preferably a C shaped electromagnet. A mixture of SiC and iron particles<br>
agglomerate at the poles of the electromagnet and form flexible electromagnetic<br>
brushes. The workpiece is provided below the poles and in contact with the flexible<br>
electromagnetic brush. The workpiece to be finished is supported on a ring<br>
dynamometer, which in turn is connected to a data acquisition mechanism through<br>
signal conditioning unit. A voltage is applied through the pulsed power generator. As<br>
described hereinabove, the application of DC pulses causes the SiC and iron particles<br>
to constantly change positions thereby bringing fresh surfaces thereof in contact with<br>
the workpiece, thereby ensuring that surface micromachining is maintained for a<br>
longer period of time. The contact of fresh rough abrasive surfaces of the particles<br>
forming the brush with the workpiece ensure that the finishing efficiency is<br>
substantially maintained over a longer period of time. The signal conditioning unit<br>
transmits profile data to the data acquisition means which then issues corresponding<br>
instructions to the pulsed power generator to cease operation once desired finish<br>
level on the workpiece is achieved.<br>
Figure 2 is a graphical representation of the relationship between Ra and the<br>
duty cycles at on time where on time is 2000 is JJs, the working gap is 1.5 mm and the<br>
RPM is 200 for a time of 15 minutes.<br>
Figures 3 (a) to (c) depict the surface of the workpieces after grinding but<br>
before being subjected to the microfinishing process of the invention, after finishing<br>
by smooth FMAB and after finishing with pulsating FMAB respectively. As is<br>
evident, the finish achieved by pulsating FMAB is significantly improved over<br>
finishing by smooth FMAB. This is essentially due to the fact that the application of a<br>
pulsating DC current ensures that the flexible magnetic abrasive brush constantly<br>
provides new surfaces of the abrasive particles to contact and finish the workpiece<br>
surface.<br>
The above disclosure is non-limiting, and variations and modifications are<br>
possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
