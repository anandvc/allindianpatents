DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
An agitation apparatus for pellets of synthetic resins in accordance with this invention will be explained in detail with reference to the embodiment shown in the accompanying drawings.<br>
In Figs. 1-3, the agitation apparatus of this invention has a supporting frame 1 assembled approximately in the rectangular shape with longitudinal frames 4 at four corners, side frames 5 of front and rear sides, and lateral frames 6 of right and left sides.  Between the upper and lower lateral frarnes 6, 6 disposed on the both sides of the supporting frame, there is fixed an elevator 8, in which a guiding bar 7 is included to move upwardly and downwardly therein, the elevator 8 is provided at the upper end of the guiding bar 7 with an elevating carrier 9 to which an atitator 3 is mounted.  The elevator 8 is constituted of cylinders of air or hydraulic pressure, the air or hydraulic pressure is     poured into or withdrawn from the cylinder, thereby causing the guiding bar 7 and the elevating carrier 9 to move together upwardly and downwardly.<br>
An agitation vessel 2 is removably housed in the inside of the supporting frame 1, and comprises a cylindrical vessel in which the pellets of synthetic resin and coloring agents are poured .  The agitation vessel 2 is provided at the center of the bottom 10 with an upright guiding pillar 11 to which a stationary blade 12 is secured, said stationary blade<br><br>
12 is protruded perpendicularly from a portion of the tangent of the circumference of the upright guiding pillar 11 so as to stop temporarily the movement of pellets of raw materials. Furthermore, in the agitation vessel 2, there is formed a plurality of mixing blades 14 which are projected respectively to the inside from the cylindrical inner circumferential wall surface 13 at the predetermined distance alternately to each other in the upper and lower direction. An agitator 3 is mounted to the center portion of the elevating carrier 9 fixed to the guiding bar 7 of the elevator 8, said agitator 3 has an electric motor 5 disposed on the upper part of the elevating carrier 9 and a rotating shaft 16 protruded to the lower part of the carrier 9. Further the agitator 3 is provided with a plurality of agitating legs 17 mounted to the lower and of the rotating shaft 16 and with agitating pawls 18 secured each to the lower end of the agitating legs 17, each agitating leg 17 comprises a horizontal portion extending from the lower end of the rotating shaft 16 parallel to the side frame 5 and the lateral frame 6 of the supporting frame 1 and a vertical portion extending parallel to the longitudinal frame 4 and bending vertically to the side frame 5 and lateral frame 6, and the agitating pawls 18 are inclined inwardly toward an axis of the rotating shaft 16 to make a favorable mixing of pellets.  The agitator 3 can be moved by the downward and upward movement of the elevating carrier 9 between two<br><br>
positions of the descended position shown in Fig. 1 which is the agitating and mixing operation position where the agitating legs 17 and agitating pawls 18 are inserted into the agitation vessel 2 housed within the supporting frame 1 and the elevated position shown in Fig.2. which is out of the agitating and mixing operation position where the agitating pawls 18 are located above the agitation vessel 2.<br>
In case of agitating, mixing and coloring the pellets in the agitation apparatus according to this invention, the raw material pellets of synthetic resins are supplied from a storing tank to the agitation vessel 2 together with the given coloring agents.  The agitation vessel 2 is settled into the supporting frame 1 of the position shown in Fig. 2 where the agitator 3 is elevated to the upmost position within the supporting frame 1.  Then by depressurizing the air of hydraulic pressure from the cylinder of the elevator 8, the elevating carrier 9 is descended and the agitating legs 17 and pawls 18 of the agitator 3 is inserted into the agitation vessel 2 which is housed in the supporting frame 1, thereupon the agitator 3 is moved into the descended position shown in Fig. 1.  Wherein the agitating legs 17 and pawls 18 are rotated by means of the electric motor 15 and the pellets are agitated, mixed, and colored.  In the agitation of the pellets with the agitating pawls 18, the pellets and coloring agents move in the same direction within the vessel 2, however the movement of the pellets will be disturbed<br><br>
temporarily by the mixing blade 14 mounted on the inner peripheral wall surface 13 of the vessel 2 and the stationary blade 12 mounted on the upright guiding member 11, thereby said movement in the same direction will be changed to produce a turbulence for coloring uniformly overall pellets and it is possible to enhance a much better coloring efficiency of pellets. Upon completion of mixing and coloring the pellets, the electric motor is stopped and then by pressurizing the air or hydraulic pressure to the cylinder of the elevator 8, the agitator 3 having the agitating pawls 18 are moved to the elevated position shown in Fig.2 and the agitator vessel 2 is taken out from the supporting frame 1 for supplying them to a transferring apparatus.<br><br><br>
