Curcumin is the non-nutritive, non-toxic compound in turmeric that has been used for centuries in India and all over the world as a dietary spice and as an herbal medicine for treatment of wounds, jaundice, and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, curcumin inhibits the proliferation of a variety of tumour cells and has anti-metastatic activity. Curcumin has numerous biological properties including anti¬oxidant, anti-cancer, anti-HIV-I integrase, chemopreventive, anti-inflammatory, and anti-angiogenesis activities.<br>
Various groups worldwide have used curcumin as a lead compound to develop numerous analogs with different bioactivities. Zambre A. P. et al ("Novel curcumin analogs targeting TNF-induced NF-KB activation and proliferation in human leukemic KBM-5 cells" Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry 14 (2006) 7196 - 7204) describes preparation and characterization of curcumin Knoevenagel condensates and their Schiff bases and corresponding copper conjugates. These compounds were evaluated for their potential of inhibiting TNF-induced NF- KB activation and proliferation in human leukemic KBM-5 cells at equimolar concentrations. However, the concentrations used by Zambre, A. P et al are in higher range. Moreover, the Knoevenagel condensates reported 80% inhibition at a very high concentration of 50 uM. Also the cell lines used to evaluate anti¬proliferative activity are different.<br>

The anti-proliferative action of synthetic curcumins was studied on Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells and Dalton's lymphoma ascites cells and for tissue culture, L929 Cells. However, the cell lines used to evaluate anti-tumor activity are different.<br>

An article by Ohori H. et al. entitled "Synthesis and biological analysis of new curcumin analogues bearing an enhanced potential for the medicinal treatment of cancer" Molecular Cancer Therapeutics 2006; 5:2563-2571 describes symmetrical 1,5-diarylpentadienone whose aromatic rings possess an alkoxy substitution at each of the positions 3 and 5. The antiproliferative activity of these analogues were screened in a variety of cancer cell lines including lines derived from stomach (GCIY, SHIOTC), lung (LK87), breast (MCF7), ovary (OVK18), prostate (PC3), pancreas (PK9), bile duct (HuCCTl), thyroid gland (8505c), skin (A431), kidney (ACHN), liver cancers (HepG2) and melanoma. This article however does not provide a detailed stability data of the analogues and other synthetic derivatives reported therein. There is no description about substitution at the active methylene position.<br>
From a biological point of view the therapeutic potential of any compound lies in its potency as well as its inherent stability of the compound, thereby allowing it to have a longer shelf life. The stability of any given compound depends on its structure. Curcumin, despite emerging as a promising anti cancer agent, is severely restricted by its unstable nature, particularly in the solution form.<br>
The need of the hour is to come up with a variety of second generation compounds having enhanced stability without compromising its potency as a chemotherapeutic agent.<br>

The, present inventors have surprisingly found that the novel derivatives of curcumin of formula 5 and formula 5' address the above shortcomings of the known prior art curcumin derivatives.<br>
The present inventors have also developed a simple and efficient methodology for the synthesis of highly bioactive derivatives of curcumin of formula 5 and formula<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The natural product curcumin and its derivatives possess numerous biological properties including anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, anti-HIV-1 integrase, chemopreventive, anti-inflammatory, and anti-angiogenesis activities. Although curcumin has been known as an anti-cancer agent against a wide range of cancer cells, its inherent instability and poor potency has been the limiting factors from its use as a potent chemotherapeutic agent. The present invention provides a one-pot process for the synthesis of a novel curcumin derivative of the formula 5, which possesses enhanced stability and anticancer properties.<br>
The compound of present invention is prepared by treating curcumin or its analogs in a solvent with azo compound in the presence of a base, typpically an amine. The reaction proceeds to completion in an hour. On completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is treated with cold aqueous acid and extracted with a suitable solvent. The combined organic layer is concentrated to afford substantially pure amino/hydrazino curcumin.<br>
The typical curcumin analogs, besides parent curcumin [diferuloylmethane or 1, 7-bis-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-l, 6-heptadiene-3, 5-Dione], include those with substituents on the aromatic ring or on the linear chain. Further, the substituent could be cyclic or open chain, branched or straight chain, could contain or devoid of hetero atoms.<br>
Following are representative examples of curcumins suitable for the present invention:<br>
•	(\E, 6E)-l,7-bis-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-l,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione,<br>
•	(1E, 6E0-l,7-bis-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-l,6-hepta.diene-3,5-dione,<br>
•	(IE, 6£)-l,7-bis-(4-nitrophenyl)-l,6-heptadiene-3j5-dione,<br>
•	(1E, 6E)-l,7-bis-(2-nitrophenyl)-I,6-heptadiene-3i5-dione,<br>
8<br><br>
•	(1E, 6E)-1,7-bis-(4-methoxyphenyI)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione,<br>
•	(\E, 6iT)-l)7-bis-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-l,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione,<br>
•	(lE",6E)-l,7-bis-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-l,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione,<br>
•	\\E, 6£)-I, 7-bis-(4-benzyloxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-l, 6-heptadiene-3, 5-Dione. The azo compounds include those with two of the groups such as carboxylic acid (CO2H), esters of carboxylic acid (CO2R, where R = ethyl, isopropyl, benzyloxycarbonyl), COR, CONR2, CN, CF3, RS02 attached to -N=N-.<br>
The ratio of curcumin to the azo compound may be 1:0.5 to 0.5:2, but the preferred ratio is 1:2<br>
Typical bases include amines such as secondary or tertiary amines, cyclic or acyclic, containing one or more N atoms. Representative examples are 4-N, N-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), its isomers and substituted analogs, imidazole and its substituted analogs, amines in which these moieties are fused to other rings, e.g. a benzene ring, l,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), l,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene (DBN). However, DMAP is preferred.<br>
The base may vary from 0.1 to 2.0 equivalents, most preferred being 1.2 equivalents.<br>
The reaction can be carried out in a range of solvents or mixtures thereof selected from alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, cyclohexanol, open chain and cyclic ether solvents such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1, 4-dioxan, halogenated solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene, benzene. Other suitable solvents include acetonitrile, dimethyl formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, acetone and ethyl acetate. These solvents do not react with either of the reactants, viz. curcumin or azo compound.<br>
9<br><br>
Although the reaction can be carried out over a wide range of temperatures from -50 to 100 °C depending on the solvent used, the preferred temperature range is -10 to 30 °C.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the reaction is preferably carried out in the dark, since the azo compounds of the present invention are photosensitive in nature.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the reaction is carried out under inert atmosphere.<br>
In yet another embodiment the stability of curcumin derivatives of formula 5 is assessed by spectrometric methods based on Lambert-Beer's law.<br>
To assess the stability of any compound spectrometric methods are used based on Lambert-Beer's law which states that:<br>
The Absorbance of any compound is<br>
-	Directly proportional to its concentration, and<br>
-	Distance traveled by the light in the solution, i.e., Aac<br>
Aal Hence, Amax = eel, Where, £ = Molar Extinction Coefficient.<br>
Based on this law, the concentration of the compound at which its Absorbance value is maximum, is referred to as AmaXjand its corresponding wavelength is X^ax. Ideally, the Amax value obtained at a specific concentration must remain constant. Hence, any variation in Amax of a compound might be regarded as an indicator of any variation in its concentration either due to reaction or due to its inherent instability in the solution.<br>
10<br><br>
Thus by incubating a compound at fixed concentration, and observing its Absorbance in a time dependent manner for 24 h, we get an idea about the stability of the compound.<br>
The invention is now illustrated with a few representative but non-limiting examples.<br>

2. Stability Assay: To determine the relative stability of the analogues 3f and 4e with respect to curcumin.<br>
Experimental Details<br>
•	The compounds were dissolved in DMSO to prepare stock concentrations 10 mM,<br>
•	Working concentration of 20 uM was prepared in deionized water for all the three compounds.<br>
•	They were incubated in dark at room temperature for 24 h.<br>
•	Blank was set with the deionized water.<br>
•	Spectrophotometer was set for baseline correction under the scanning wavelength in the range of 340 nm-500 nm.<br>
•	Amax reading was taken at zero hour at the onset of experiment. The corresponding wavelength &gt;.max was noted.<br>
16<br><br>
•	Subsequently, absorbance readings were taken after every one hour till 24 h. The spectra of each compound were obtained. The absorbance value corresponding to the ^max observed at zero time was taken.<br>
•	A graph is plotted with Amax versus time (h) and the fall in the A^ax values was calculated as a % change in 24 h.<br>

RESULTS<br>
a.	In curcumin treated cells, there was a clear evidence of on-going apoptosis<br>
both in the early as well as late phases.<br>
b.	Cells treated with AM-26 at both concentrations exclusively featured early<br>
phase of apoptosis with a few cells undergoing the late phase.<br>
c.	AM-27 recapitulated the findings seen in curcumin treated cells, featuring<br>
both the early and late apoptotic cells.<br>
1. Elucidating the role of p53 as a possible mediator in their anti-proliferative actions atlCso and 2 x IC50 concentrations by immunostainingof HCT-116 cells<br>
Experimental details<br>
•	Cells were seeded ion cover slips in 24 well plate at concentration of 0.5 * 105 /ml.<br>
•	Cells were grown for one cell-cycle and curcumins, AM-26 (3f) and AM-27 (4e) were added in IC50 and 2 x IC50 concentrations.<br>
•	Cells were fixed with 3.75% of formaldehyde.<br>
•	They were permeabilised with ice cold methanol and were incubated at -40 °C for 10 minutes and washed afterwards with 2% PBS.<br>
•	The cells were then blocked by adding 2% BSA and incubated at 37°C for half an hour.<br><br>
•	Primary antibody for p53 was added at working concentration of 1:300 and incubation was carried out for one and a half-hour in dark at room temperature.<br>
•	This was followed by two washes with 1% PBS and addition of Alexa-Iabeled secondary antibody at 1:500 concentrations. They were incubated at room temperature in dark for 1 hour.<br>
•	Another wash, once with 1% PBS and another with deionised water was given.<br>
18<br><br>
•	To stain the nucleus Hoechst dye at concentration of l^g/ml was added to the cover-slips and incubated in dark for 7-8 minutes.<br>
•	The cover-slips were mounted on the slides and observed under fluorescence microscope with appropriate filters.<br>
RESULTS<br>
a.	In the cells treated with curcumin, p53 was found to be translocated to their<br>
respective nuclei at both the concentrations.<br>
b.	In case of AM-26 (3f) and AM-27 (4e), the cells exhibited similar nuclear<br>
translocation in response to both their IC50 and 2 * IC50 concentrations.<br>
