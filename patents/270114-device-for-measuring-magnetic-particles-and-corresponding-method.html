				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention concerns a device for the qualitative or<br>
quantitative measurement of a magnetically labelled analyte,<br>
which device includes a coil arrangement, formed of at least<br>
one measuring coil and a reference coil arranged in connection<br>
with it, for measuring the analyte from a sample absorbed in a<br>
test base, and from the signal of which coil arrangement a<br>
change in inductance correlating to the content of the mag-<br>
netically labelled analyte is arranged to be detected. In ad-<br>
dition, the invention also relates to a corresponding method.<br>
Numerous methods and apparatuses for measuring magnetic parti-<br>
cles, for example, in analytic tests, are known from the prior<br>
art. For example, Finnish patent number 113297 discloses an<br>
idea concerning the use of a so-called astatic coil arrange-<br>
ment for measuring an analyte from a sample absorbed in a test<br>
base. In it, the coil arrangement is used to detect a change<br>
in inductance correlating to the content of a magnetically la-<br>
belled analyte.<br>
The application of traditional coil technology to such an ar-<br>
rangement, however, is associated with significant problems<br>
relating, for example, to the sensitivity of the apparatus.<br>
Some examples of these are capacitive par-asitic current in the<br>
coil loops. Another problem can be mentioned the asymmetry of<br>
the coils, which is caused by, for example, the manual winding<br>
of the coils.<br>
The magnetism of magnetic particles and thus the change in in-<br>
ductance they create in a coil system is very insignificant<br>
compared, for example, to the error signals caused by the en-<br>
vironment or the test base itself. Thus the measurement re-<br>
sults obtained using the apparatus leave much to be desired.<br><br>
In addition, due to the test, bases according to the prior art,<br>
the reactions of the analyte on the test base take place on a<br>
very small scale, due, for example, to expensiveness of the<br>
reagents. Therefore the positioning of the test base relative<br>
to the device, for example, creates a challenging problem<br>
while wrong positioning can distort, the test results. In addi-<br>
tion, the test base places special demands particularly on<br>
wrapped coil constructions.<br>
The solutions disclosed in PCT publications WO - 2005111614<br>
and WO - 2005111615 also make known the application of coil<br>
devices in analytic rapid tests. They are based on detecting a<br>
change of inductance from a change in resonance frequency.<br>
When measuring the change in resonance frequency, the reso-<br>
nance peak of the LC circuit changes to a different frequency<br>
when the inductance of a coil or the capacitance of a capaci-<br>
tor changes. However, the low inductance of the coil creates a<br>
problem. Parasitic phenomena of all kinds can easily connect<br>
to a coil with a low inductance, and thus they can also be<br>
distinguished from the signal measured in the frequency form.<br>
PCT publication WO 03/076931 A1 discloses yet another manner<br>
of measurement known from, the prior art. It too is based on<br>
detecting changes in frequency.<br>
Various so-called SQUID-type methods are also known. However,<br>
their operating principle, demands operation at very low tem-<br>
peratures, at even close to absolute zero. This makes the ap-<br>
paratus complicated, for example, in POCT (point of care test-<br>
ing) applications.<br>
The present invention is intended to create an improved device<br>
and corresponding method for measuring a magnetically labelled<br>
analyte qualitatively or quantitatively, by means of which<br><br>
substantially more accurate measurement information can be<br>
created than when using known apparatuses, based, for example,<br>
on coil arrangements operating at room temperature. The char-<br>
acteristic features of the device according to the invention<br>
are stated in the accompanying Claim 1 while the characteris-<br>
tic features of the method corresponding to it are stated in<br>
Claim 15.<br>
In the device according to the invention, a change in induc-<br>
tance is arranged to be detected from a change in amplitude<br>
and/or phase appearing in the output signal of the coil ar-<br>
rangement, which is arranged to be measured at the frequency<br>
of the input signal.<br>
According to one embodiment, in order to increase the induc-<br>
tive reactance to be greater than the resistance, the measur-<br>
ing frequency used in the device is arranged to be 105 - 109<br>
Hz, preferably 106 - 108 Hz. The use of such very high measur-<br>
ing frequencies will surprisingly improve the accuracy of the<br>
measurement results obtained using the device.<br>
According to one more highly developed embodiment, the device<br>
can additionally include a coil arrangement compensating for<br>
error signals, which can be formed in several different ways.<br>
It can be used to compensate, for example, for error signals<br>
caused by the environment and/or magnetic particles that are<br>
unspecifically bound to the test. base. The reference coil can,<br>
for its part, also be used for this compensation purpose. It<br>
can be used to compensate for, among other things, error sig-<br>
nals caused by the test base. Of course, it should be noted<br>
that, in the device according to the invention, the reference<br>
coil has other functions too, so that the compensation func-<br>
tion referred to in this connection does not in any way ex-<br>
clude other functions. The compensating construction can, ac-<br>
cording to one embodiment, be implemented, for example, as a<br><br>
differential coil system. One example of this can be an imped-<br>
ance bridge. In that case, the measuring coil and the refer-<br>
ence coil are in connection with the compensating construc-<br>
tion.<br>
By means of the device according to the invention, very accu-<br>
rate measurement results can be obtained, even in the case of<br>
very weak magnetic analytes. The high measuring frequencies<br>
applied in the measurement, and the differential coil con-<br>
struction mean that the device is eminently suitable for use<br>
at even room temperature, in terms of its temperature condi-<br>
tions. Compared to the frequency measurements of the prior<br>
art, the device and method according to the invention are less<br>
sensitive to parasitic phenomena, as they are not distin-<br>
guished as easily from the measured output signal, which the<br>
phase difference and/or amplitude is measured at the frequency<br>
of the input signal.<br>
According to one embodiment, the device can also be made very<br>
end-user-friendly. If the test base is integrated in interac-<br>
tion with the coil arrangement, it will not need to be sepa-<br>
rately set to a connection with the coil means. It will then<br>
be sufficient for the sample to be placed on the base and the<br>
measurement to be performed. As a device embodiment, this can<br>
be considered particularly precisely in coils in the micro-<br>
size scale and, for example, in Point-of-Care Testing i.e.<br>
POCT applications.<br>
Other characteristic features of the device and method accord-<br>
ing to the invention are stated in the accompanying Claim<br>
while additional advantages achieved are itemized in the de-<br>
scription portion.<br>
In the following, the invention, which is not restricted to<br>
the embodiments described in the following, is examined in<br><br>
greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in<br>

the coils are on different planes,<br>

coil, caused by magnetic particles, is meas-<br>
ured as a phase-difference measurement.<br>
By means of the devices 10 according to the invention and of a<br>
measuring method based on them, it is possible to detect the<br>
amount of magnetic particles from a test base 11. The measure-<br>
ment is based on using a coil arrangement 13, 18 - 20, in the<br>
operation of which the presence of magnetic particles will<br>
cause a detectable divergence.<br>
Figures 1-3 show some simplified examples of the coils 21<br>
suitable for use in devices 10 according to the invention, for<br>
the qualitative or quantitative measurement, of a magnetically<br>
labelled analyte 12.<br>
Figure 1 shows a first example of a coil 21, which can be ap-<br>
plied in the device 10. In this case, the coil construction<br>
forms a planar rectangular spiral, the number of turns of<br>
which is now two. The elongated test base 11 can be positioned<br>
quite freely, but in any event asymmetrically, relative to the<br>
coil 21, more general, the coil arrangement of the device. In<br>
this case, the test base 11 runs across the coil 21, its lon-<br>
gitudinal direction being at right angles to the direction de-<br>
fined by the contact terminals 14, 15, from which contact ter-<br>
minals 14, 15 the coil loop 21 can be connected. An example of<br>
the inductance interval of such a coil 21 can be generally 1<br>
pH - 1 mH, more specifically 1 nH - 1000 nH and the resistance<br><br>
interval generally 1 - 100 , more specifically 10 m - 10 <br>
(depending on the measuring frequency used). In general, it<br>
can be stated that the main effective factor of the resistance<br>
and inductance values is the dimensions of the coil. In this<br>
case, the reading values given are fitted to the coil dimen-<br>
sions referred to later.<br>
Figure 2 shows a second example of the coil 21 used in the de-<br>
vice 10. As the embodiment shows, the construction of the coil<br>
21 can be very simple indeed. Now the coil is formed of only a<br>
single conductor loop, being thus a simplified version of the<br>
coil construction shown in Figure 1 . The conductor loop forms<br>
a single-winding, planar coil 21, with which an interactive<br>
connection can be arranged from the test base 11 with the mag-<br>
netic particles 12. In this case too, to the coil loop 21 is<br>
connected from contact terminals 14 and 15, which are now on<br>
the same side. One example of the inductance interval of the<br>
coil loop 21 for such a coil construction can be 1 nH - 20 nH,<br>
while the resistance interval can be 1 m - 100 m.<br>
Figure 3 shows a third example of the construction of a single<br>
coil 21. In this case, the coil 21 is formed of an even sim-<br>
pler construction than in the two cases described above. The<br>
example shows that the coil 21 can even be formed of a<br>
straight conductor structure a conductor beam, which is drawn<br>
across the test base 11. Despite the simplicity of the con-<br>
struction, this construction too is understood to be still un-<br>
disputably a coil, as the conductor beam 21 now forms the coil<br>
component in the electrical circuit when it is connected to<br>
the electronics. Again, to the conductor 21 can be connected<br>
from the con-act terminals 14, 15. One example, of the induc-<br>
tance interval with such a construction can be 1.00 pH - 3 nH<br>
and the resistance interval 0.1 m - 10 m.<br><br>
Figures 4 and 5 shows some embodiments of devices 10 according<br>
to the invention, in which the coil constructions shown in<br>
Figures 1-3 can be applied. In the device 10 according to<br>
the invention, the coil arrangement, by means of which an ana-<br>
lyte 12 is measured from a sample absorbed on a test base 11,<br>
includes in its basic form at least two coils 13, 18 formed of<br>
conductor structures, the conductor structures of which can<br>
be, for example, planar and connected to each other galvani-<br>
cally. It should be noted that Figures 1 - 10 do not show, for<br>
reasons of simplicity, the insulations possibly required on<br>
the circuit board 22, or the equipment relating to the measur-<br>
ing electronics, which the implementation of the device 10 in<br>
practice requires/may demand. Figure 6 shows such a totality<br>
with all its details.<br>
The device 10 shown in Figure 4 includes two planar square-<br>
spiral shaped coils 13, 18, both of which are next to each<br>
other on the same plane and connected in series. The coil 13<br>
is used for the actual measurement and close to it is a coil<br>
18 as a reference for the measuring coil 13, which in this<br>
case forms, for its part, a compensating construction. The<br>
reference coil 18 fitted in connection with the measuring coil<br>
13 can be, for example, an identical copy of the measuring<br>
coil 13, or its mirror image, being aligned symmetrically<br>
relative to the measuring coil 13. The use of the identical<br>
copy or mirror-image property improves the interference immu-<br>
nity of the coil arrangement. The distance between the coils<br>
13, 18 is arranged to be such that they are sufficiently close<br>
to each othex" in terms of measurement, but on the other hand,<br>
however, in such a way that the magnetic fields of the coils<br>
13, 18 will not significantly interact with each other in<br>
terms of the measurement. The coils 13, 18 are wound in the<br>
same direction.<br><br>
It should be noted, that the measuring coil 13 and the refer-<br>
ence coil form a single compact totality, so that the coil ar-<br>
rangement formed by them and the test base 11 set in connec-<br>
tion with them interact mutually and the output is a single<br>
measurement signal 32, from the change in amplitude and/or<br>
phase A,  (delta A, delta phi) measured from which at the<br>
frequency of the input signal 31 the necessary conclusions<br>
concerning the analyte being examined can be drawn. This sim-<br>
plifies the construction and operation of the sensor 10.<br>
The reference coil arrangement, which in this case; includes a<br>
single reference coil 18, has in the device according to the<br>
invention several different implications, which do not exclude<br>
each other. A first function of the reference coil is to com-<br>
pensate the self-inductance, resistance, temperature depend-<br>
ence of the resistance, and capacitance of the measuring coil<br>
13. In general, it is possible to speak of the compensation of<br>
the electrical parameters caused by the coil 13 itself and of<br>
the changes not caused by those magnetic particles. When the<br>
self-inductances of the coils 13, 18 are the same, the differ-<br>
ence proportional to the. amount of particles, owing to which<br>
the measurement can be said to be differential, will appear in<br>
the output of the measuring coil 13 . In addition, the refer-<br>
ence coil 18 can also be used for its part to compensate the<br>
errors caused by the test base 11 and/or the environment,<br>
which also for its part relates to the differential nature of<br>
the arrangement. For example:, the unspecifically bound parti-<br>
cles in the test base 11, the possible capacitive connection<br>
between the turns of the coil and the material of the test<br>
base 11, and the capacitive connection between the medium<br>
(sample solution, or similar) transporting the samples and<br>
particles and turns of the coil, can be classified as errors<br>
caused by the test base 11. Sources of error caused by the en-<br>
vironment are, for example, the change in resistance caused by<br>
temperature variations, error signals induced from the input<br><br>
electronics 23, the Earth's magnetic field, and other distur-<br>
bances .<br>
The particles 12 on the test base 11 are detected using the<br>
measuring coil 13. The measurement can be performed as a so-<br>
called intermediate output measurement, from the contacts 15<br>
between the coils 13, 18. The alternating current signal fed<br>
from the contacts 14, 16 over the coils 13, 18 sums as zero in<br>
the intermediate output 15, if the test: base 11 is particle<br>
free. The magnetic field of the measuring coil 13 belonging to<br>
the coil arrangement is used to magnetize the particles to be<br>
detected, which are made to interact with at least the measur-<br>
ing coil 13 of the device 10. The magnetized particles rein-<br>
force the measuring coil's 13 own magnetic field, so that the<br>
measuring coil 13 sees the change as a change in inductance.<br>
As a result of the strengthening of the magnetic field of the<br>
measuring coil 13, a voltage, which is compared to the ground<br>
of the input signal, proportional to the number of particles,<br>
appears in the intermediate output 15. In this connection, it<br>
is indeed possible to speak of a differential connection, i.e.<br>
the output is: the difference between two signals.<br>
Thus, the coil arrangement 13, 18 - 20 of the device 10 can be<br>
used to detect a change in inductance corresponding to the<br>
content of a magnetically labelled analyte 12, which in the<br>
device 10 and method according to the invention is measured<br>
from a change in amplitude and/or phase AA, Acp appearing in<br>
the output signal 32 of the coil arrangement 13, 18, which is<br>
measured at the frequency of the input signal 31. According to<br>
one embodiment, this can be measured from the change in ampli-<br>
tude and/or phase AA, Acp of the intermediate output 15 of the<br>
measuring coil 13 and the reference coil 18. This manner of<br>
measurement achieved a particular advantage that will be re-<br>
turned to later in this description. The change in inductance<br>
is proportional to the number and location of the particles,<br><br>
which are the intended measurement results and from which con-<br>
clusions can be drawn concerning the results of the test. In<br>
the case of the device according to the invention it is indeed<br>
possible to speak of an impedance/inductance sensor, in which<br>
the properties of the coil conductor are measured.<br>
In Figure 4, the test base 11 is placed on top of only the<br>
measuring coil 13. Alternatively, the test base 11 could be<br>
arranged over both coil branches 13, 18, as shown by the em-<br>
bodiment in Figure 5. There is an electrical connection from<br>
the contact terminals 14 - 16 to the measuring arrangement<br>
formed by the; coils 13, 18.<br>
Figure 5 shows a second embodiment of a differential sensor-<br>
loop pair, which is now formed of two single-winding planar<br>
coil loops 13, 18 parallel to each other. The construction is<br>
slightly simpler than the embodiment shown in Figure 4 and<br>
thus more affordable to manufacture. In this embodiment, the<br>
test base 11 with the magnetic particles 12 is placed trans-<br>
versely on top of both coils 13, 18. Having the test base 11<br>
on top of both coils 13, 18 improves, among other things, the<br>
elimination of measurement errors caused by the test base 11.<br>
There is a connection to the measuring system from the contact<br>
terminals 14 - 16, of which 15 is again a common intermediate<br>
output for both coils 13, 18. It should be noted that each<br>
coil 13, 18 can also have its own contact terminal 14 - 16,<br>
independent of the embodiment.<br>
In both embodiments, the measuring coil 13 and the reference<br>
coil 18 forming the compensating structure for that thus now<br>
form a differential coil arrangement. The reference coil 18<br>
arranged in connection with the measuring coil 13 can be used<br>
to measure differentially the amplitude A and/or the phase <br>
of the output: signal 32 correlating to the change in induc-<br>
tance of the measuring coil 13. This minimizes the ambient in-<br><br>
terferences and particularly the error signal caused by excess<br>
unspecifically located magnetic particles.<br>
The device 10 can include even several compensating structures<br>
for error signals. The number of structures and their connec-<br>
tion to the measuring coil 13 depends on the measuring varia-<br>
tions in each case.<br>
Figure 6 shows an embodiment of the device 10 modelled with<br>
circuit components, in which the bridge measurement principle<br>
is applied using four coils 13, 18 - 20. The compensating ad-<br>
ditional structures 19, 2 0 02: structure and their placing (for<br>
example, symmetry, overlapping) can be used in this case pri-<br>
marily to eliminate error signals caused by the environment.<br>
These can be caused, for example, by electromagnetic machines<br>
and devices and also by the Earth's magnetic field. In addi-<br>
tion, bridge measurement permits 'floating measurement', in<br>
which the signal is not compared to the ground potential,<br>
which might otherwise cause errors.<br>
In this case, the compensating structure includes not only the<br>
reference coil 18, but at least two additional coils 19, 20.<br>
In this case, the measuring coil 13, reference coil 18, and<br>
the compensating structure 19, 2 0 are arranged in an impedance<br>
bridge relative to each other. In addition, the coils 13, 18 -<br>
20 are also arranged symmetrically relative to each other. In<br>
that case, the coils 13, 18 - 2 0 can be, for example, identi-<br>
cal copies or mirror images of the measuring coil 13, which<br>
properties are used to improve the interference tolerance of<br>
the arrangement. The measuring coil 13, reference coil 18, and<br>
compensating structure 19, 20 can thus be, for example, the<br>
same magnitude of, their inductance, resistance, and/or ca-<br>
pacitance. Thus at least: some of their electrical parameters<br>
can be of the same magnitude. The application of identical<br>
coils allows the sensitivity of the bridge measurement to be<br><br>
considerably increased, as all the impedances will be mainly<br>
of the same magnitude.<br>
The impedance bridge is thus formed of the measuring coil 13,<br>
its reference coil 18, and their compensating coils 19, 20.<br>
The test base 11 can be arranged, for example, in the manner<br>
shown in Figures 8 - 10, over at least the measuring coil 13<br>
and in this case also the reference coil 18. The rest of the<br>
coils 19, 2 0 are for compensation. In Figure 6, the coils 13,<br>
18 - 2 0 are shown depicting their general equivalent circuits<br>
(coil L, series resistor R, and parallel capacitor Cp) . The<br>
signal source is marked with the reference number 23.<br>
Figure 6 also includes some possible ways (CR1 - CR6) of plac-<br>
ing the resonance capacitor. One example of a way to arrange<br>
the resonance capacitors can be such that: the capacitors are<br>
on the input side of the circuit to be connected in series and<br>
those on the measuring side to be connected in parallel. The<br>
capacitors can also be manufactured together with the coils<br>
13, 18 - 20 on a common base 22. The advantage of this is that<br>
it easily achieves a first amplification stage increasing the<br>
signal.<br>
In the bridge connection, the signal 32 is measured between<br>
two separate pairs of coils. The signal 32 obtained from the<br>
intermediate output 15 of the measuring coil pair 13, 18 is<br>
compared to the intermediate output 17 of the corresponding<br>
compensating coil pair 19, 20 without particles, so that it is<br>
also possible to speak of a differential measurement. In the<br>
same way it is also possible to speak of a 'floating' measure-<br>
ment, because the actual output, i.e. measuring signal 32 is<br>
compared with the ground potential, which is not in galvanic<br>
contact, for example, with the ground potential of the input<br>
device 23.<br><br>
Figures 8 - 10 show some possible ways of placing coils 13, 18<br>
- 20 for a four-coil bridge measurement. Figure 8 shows an em-<br>
bodiment, in which all the coils 13, 18 - 20 are on the same<br>
level, being in a matrix-like formation. In it the measuring<br>
coil 13 and the reference coil 18 are aligned symmetrically<br>
relative to the measuring-signal conductors 15 and 17. The<br>
compensation coils 19, 20 are next to each other like squares<br>
on the same level. In addition, they are symmetrical relative<br>
to at least one axis with the measuring signal conductors 15,<br>
17 and the first coil pair 13, 18. Because the current leaving<br>
the measuring-signal conductors 15, 17 is considerably smaller<br>
than the current brought to the input-signal conductors 14,<br>
16, a symmetrical arrangement of this kind achieves a signifi-<br>
cant additional advantage, for example, in the compensation of<br>
interferences. The symmetrical continuity can extend to the<br>
area of influence of the coils 13, 18 - 20. The area of influ-<br>
ence of the coils 13, 18 - 20 can be said to end when the am-<br>
bient interference becomes dominant.<br>
The test base 11 with the magnetic particles 12 is located<br>
transversely on top of both coils 13, 18., The input-signal<br>
conductors 14, 16 are at the sides of the circuit card and the<br>
measuring-signal conductors 15, 17 in the middle on two lev-<br>
els. The output signal 32 is measured between the two measur-<br>
ing-signal conductors 15, 17 ('Output' in Figure 6).<br>
Figure 9 shows another embodiment of the bridge measurement.<br>
In it, the coil pairs 13, 18, 19, 20 are on top of each other.<br>
In general, it is possible to speak of a layered arrangement,<br>
in which at least some of the coils are on a different level<br>
to the others. The coils 13, 18 on the same level can then be<br>
parallel to each other, such as, for example, symmetrically in<br>
pairs. If there is precious little unspecific bonding, there<br>
coils 13, 18 - 20 can be singly, as will be described later in<br>
greater detail.<br><br>
The measuring coil 13 and the reference coil 18 are once again<br>
aligned symmetrically relative to the measuring-signal conduc-<br>
tors 15, 17. The input-signal conductors 14 and 16 come at the<br>
sides. Unlike the embodiment shown in Figure 8, the compensa-<br>
tion coils 19, 20 are now under the measuring coil 13 and the<br>
reference coil 18. In this embodiment, the test base 11 with<br>
the magnetic particles 12 is located transversely on top of<br>
both 'coil stacks'. In this case, the stacked geometry of the<br>
coils 13, 18 - 20 minimizes interferences better than in the<br>
embodiment shown in Figure: 8. In addition, this embodiment<br>
permits a better placing of the coils on the test base 11.<br>
This is an advantage, especially when using a Lateral-flow<br>
test.<br>
Figure 10 shows a third embodiment of bridge measurement, in<br>
which the coils 13, 18 - 20 are again, on the same level, but<br>
in this base in a row formation. Again, the measuring coil 13<br>
and the reference coil 18 are aligned symmetrically relative<br>
to the measuring-signal conductors 15, 17. Also in this case,<br>
the input-signal conductors 14, 16 come from the sides. The<br>
compensation coils 19, 20 are now at the ends of the coil ar-<br>
ray on eitheir side of the measuring and reference coils 13,<br>
18. The test base 11 with the magnetic particles 12 is again<br>
located transversely on top of all the coils 13, 18 - 20. One<br>
advantage of this construction is a better alignment relative<br>
to the test base 11.<br>
According to yet another bridge-measurement embodiment, the<br>
coils 13, 18 - 20 can also be concentrically on a post. In<br>
this case, reference can be made to Figure 9. The signal con-<br>
ductors of the measuring and reference coils 13, 18 can, dif-<br>
fering from Figure 9, also be run in such a way that if neces-<br>
sary insulating material can be removed from around the coils,<br>
for example, by milling. In this way, the measuring and refer-<br><br>
ence coils 13, 18 can be made clearly higher that their sur-<br>
roundings, such as, for example, other conductors. For exam-<br>
ple, the conductor 17 of Figure 9 could be made to run behind<br>
and under the conductor 15. The advantage of the construction<br>
is a better alignment on some test bases.<br>
According to one embodiment, the test base 11 can also be in-<br>
tegrated in the sensor structure 13, 18 - 20 on a separate<br>
disposable base 22 (Figure 10) . In that; case, at least the<br>
measuring coil 13 will be integrate in the immediate vicinity<br>
of the test base 11, being attached to or at least very close<br>
to it (distance 
event, independent of the arrangement, it is possible to speak<br>
of an interactive connection between the test base 11 and the<br>
coil arrangement, at the very least the measuring coil 13.<br>
Corresponding ways of arranging the connection of the test<br>
base 11 and the coils 13, 18 are also possible in a such de-<br>
vice, in connection with which the test base 11 can be brought<br>
in a detachable manner. On the same base 22, it. is also possi-<br>
ble to integrate some or all of the coils (reference coil 18,<br>
compensation coils 19, 20) and/or at least part or even all of<br>
the measuring electronics. The integrated disposable base 22<br>
can be connected to the rest of the electronics, for example,<br>
galvanically, capacitively, or inductively.<br>
As the embodiments described above show, the test base 11 can<br>
be located not only parallel to the coil plane (XY plane), but<br>
also perpendicularly through the coil plane (Z axis). The test<br>
area can also be transverse to the measuring coil 13 (in the<br>
XY plane).<br>
Irrespective of the degree of integration, the coil arrange-<br>
ment according to the invention can be manufactured typically<br>
on an insulator or a semiconductor. Such an insulator can be,<br>
for example, glass (quartz), plastic (FR4), or a semiconduct-<br><br>
ing oxide (SiO2) . The insulator material used depends on the<br>
manufacturing technique. The measuring coil 13, the reference<br>
coil 18, and. the possible compensating coils/structures 19, 20<br>
can be made from an electrically conductive metal, such as,<br>
for example, copper, aluminium, gold, or silver, but also from<br>
other electrical conductors, such as, for example, electri-<br>
cally conductive polymers, or a doped semiconductor. To manu-<br>
facture the structures, it is possible to use, for example,<br>
micro-machining methods, such as, for example, photolithogra-<br>
phy, wet or dry etching, doping, metallization, printing elec-<br>
tronics, and/or thick-membrane techniques. The structures can<br>
also be made using mechanical machining methods, such as, for<br>
example, by milling.<br>
According to one embodiment, in order to increase the induc-<br>
tive reactance of the coil arrangement, such as, for example,<br>
of the measuring coil 13, the measuring frequency of the de-<br>
vice 10 can be adapted to be higher than the known measuring<br>
frequencies of the prior art. One example of such a measuring<br>
frequency can be 105 - 109 Hz and more particularly 106 - 108<br>
Hz. At small dimensions 10-7 - 10-1 m, more particularly 10-5 -<br>
10-3 m, of the coils 13 of the device 10, and at high measur-<br>
ing frequencies 105 - 109 Hz and more particularly 106 - 108<br>
Hz, a greater sensitivity than that of earlier inductance<br>
change measuring devices and methods will be achieved. In the<br>
method according to the invention, measurement is performed<br>
using the same frequency as the input signal 31 fed to the<br>
coil arrangement 10. Though in some cases or in some measuring<br>
arrangements the frequency might change, this will not be de-<br>
tected, because it is not measured in the case of the inven-<br>
tion. Instead of the frequency change, the amplitude A and/or<br>
the phase cp of the output signal 32 is measured at the fre-<br>
quency of the input signal 31.<br><br>
The test base 11 too can, in terms of the invention, take<br>
quite many forms. Some examples of these are the so-called<br>
lateral-flow test, the pit test, the capillary, the microflu-<br>
idics channel, the micro array, or some other manner of bring-<br>
ing the particles to be measured into the vicinity of the de-<br>
vice 10. For the transportation of larger numbers of parti-<br>
cles, it is possible to use the later-flow test, on account of<br>
its simplicity, reliability, and inexpensiveness. A particular<br>
positioning precision (distance from the coil 13) is expected<br>
of smaller amounts of particles and smaller sensor transport<br>
formats. Microfluidics is more suitable than the lateral test<br>
and a test base 11 that may be integrated permanently in con-<br>
nection with the coil 13 will permit a very high positioning<br>
precision relative to the position of the coil 13 and the test<br>
base 11 to each other.<br>
The diameter of individual particles, which can be defined us-<br>
ing the device 10 according to the invention, can be, for ex-<br>
ample, in the range 1 nm - 10 m. Of particular interest are<br>
the particle clusters, with a diameter that can be, depending<br>
on the test base, for example in the range 30 run - 10 m or<br>
particularly 100 - 600 run, which are formed, for example, of<br>
smaller 5 - 30-nm particles. The amount of magnetite or a cor-<br>
responding magnetic material can be, for example, in the order<br>
of 1 ng - 1 mg and the corresponding sample volume, for exam-<br>
ple, in the range 1 nl - 1 ml. In that case, the number of<br>
particles on the test base can be in the range 1 - 1012 parti-<br>
cles, more particularly in the range 103 - 1010 (for example,<br>
lateral-flow tests) or 1 - 108 (for example, miniaturized di-<br>
agnostics) . The minimum and maximum of the size and number of<br>
the particles generally depends of the application and the di-<br>
mensions of the coil arrangement used.<br>
The form of the measuring coil 13, as well as that of the<br>
other coil devices 18 - 20 that may belong to the device 10,<br><br>
can be, for example, a polygonal (for example, a square, rec-<br>
tangle, triangle, hexagon), or round (for example, a circle,<br>
oval, omega), possibly spiral, planar, continuous, electri-<br>
cally conductive, current-carrying conductor structure.<br>
In the device 10 according to the invention, at least one di-<br>
mension of the conductor structure in at least one coil struc-<br>
ture 13 is in the order of magnitude range of a few microme-<br>
tres to hundreds of micrometres. Thus, for example, the height<br>
i.e. the thickness of the conductor (and at the same time the<br>
insulation spacing and winding spacing) can be 10-7 - 10-4 m<br>
and the width of the conductor 10-6 - 10-4 m. Here, the terms<br>
heights and thickness of the conductor refer to the direction<br>
perpendicular to the base 22 and the term width to the direc-<br>
tion parallel to the plane of the base 22.<br>
The scale parallel to the plane (its plane cross-section<br>
and/or length and/or width) of each coil 13, 18 - 20 belonging<br>
to the device 10 can be, for example, 10-7 - 10-2 m, particu-<br>
larly 10-5 - 10-3 m. This is particularly the case in a coil<br>
structure formed of several conductors. Depending on the manu-<br>
facturing technique, the example of the dimensions parallel to<br>
the plane can be 3 mm x 3 mm or 3 00 m x 3 00 m. Correspond-<br>
ingly, the spacing of the turns of the coils 13, 18 - 20 can<br>
be, for example, 100 m or 10 m. In a coil structure applying<br>
the bridge construction, the. distance of the coils 13, 18 - 20<br>
from each other can be 1 - 5 mm, such as, for example 1-3<br>
mm. Thus it is possible to speak generally of macro or micro-<br>
coils .<br>
The size of the test base 11 and the reaction area in it de-<br>
pends on the application used and the number of particles. The<br>
lateral-flow test, which is suitable for the transportation of<br>
larger numbers of particles, can be, for example, 3-mm wide,<br>
50-mm long, and a few hundreds of micrometres thick. The sur-<br><br>
face area of the test area of a lateral-flow test can be, for<br>
example, 3 mm x 1 mm, or 5 mm x 1 mm. In such a test, the par-<br>
ticle distribution can be, for example, relatively homogene-<br>
ously distribution over the whole thickness of the strip 11.<br>
The channel diameter of microfluidics, which is more suitable<br>
for the transportation of smaller numbers of particles, can<br>
be, for example, about 100 m and the surface area of the test<br>
area, for example, about 300 m x 300 m. In a test imple-<br>
mented using microfluidics, the particle distribution is in<br>
the surface of the test area, for example, or in its immediate<br>
vicinity.<br>
The dimensions of the coils 13, 18 - 20 have a significant ef-<br>
fect on the sensitivity of the measuring system. The embodi-<br>
ments shown in Figures 1 - 3 show basic geometries for planar-<br>
coils. For reasons of simplicity, only rectangular coil forms<br>
are shown in this case. Reference has already been made to<br>
other possible coil forms. The number of turns, length, thick-<br>
ness, and width of the coils of the embodiments of Figures 1 -<br>
3 can vary relative to each other. The electrical properties<br>
of the coils are determined by their geometry and dimensions.<br>
Approximate estimates of values, based on the measurements and<br>
simulations are given above for the variations (without being-<br>
restricted to them) , for the inductance and resistance, the<br>
cross-sectional area of a coil made from copper being about 3 6<br>
m x 100 m and the cross-section of the coil being 2-4 mm.<br>
in the X and Y directions. The impedance determined, from these<br>
depends on the frequency used.<br>
The following is a brief description of the operating princi-<br>
ple of the device 10 according to the invention and of the<br>
corresponding method. The magnetic particles 12 can be brought<br>
to the measuring area of the measuring coil 13 using a suit-<br>
able test base 11. The particles reinforce the magnetic field<br>
in the environment of the coil 13 when they come under the in-<br><br>
fluence of the magnetic field of the coil 13. The coil 13 ex-<br>
periences this effect as a change in the relative permeability<br>
of the environment (r &gt; 1) , This causes a change (L) in the<br>
inductance (L0) of the measuring coil 13 ..<br>
L = L0(r-1)<br>
XL =DL0<br>
The change (L) of inductance proportional to the number of<br>
particles can be detected as a change in the total impedance<br>
(Z) caused by the change (XL) in the inductive reactance<br>
(XL). This improves the performance of the measurement of the<br>
amplitude A and/or phase  at high frequencies. An LC circuit<br>
can also be used for the measurement, but in that case, too,<br>
the amplitude A (y-axis) and not the frequency is measured.<br>
The inductance (for example, 1 - 100 nH) of the coil 13 and<br>
its change (for example, about 50 fH - 50 pH) can be detected<br>
by measuring the changes A,  in the amplitude and/or phase<br>
of the high-frequency voltage, or current signal 31 fed to the<br>
measuring coil 13 . The input voltage given by the supply 23<br>
can vary between 0,1 - 10 V, more particularly between 0,5 -<br>
2,5 V, and the input current (impedance) between 0,001 - 10 A,<br>
more particularly between 0,05 - 1 A. The frequency of the in-<br>
put voltage/current can vary between 10D - 109 Hz, more par-<br>
ticularly between 106 - 108 Hz (for example, for micro-coils).<br>
As an example of the frequency, reference can be made to the<br>
use in one macro-scale pilot device of 5 - 2 0 MHz, more par-<br>
ticularly 7 - 14 MHz. The measurement of the change A,  in<br>
amplitude and/or phase can be implemented by monitoring the<br>
absolute value of the impedance and/or phase cp of the measur-<br>
ing coil 13 before and after exposure to the magnetic parti-<br>
cles, which monitoring is performed using the frequency of the<br><br>
input signal 31 fed to the coil arrangement 10. The greatest<br>
problem in such a measuring arrangement is external interfer-<br>
ence, which distorts the measurement results and reduces the<br>
reliability of the measurement, but its effects can be sur-<br>
prisingly eliminated using the compensating structures 18 -<br>
20.<br>
A comparison can be implemented, for example, using the dif-<br>
ferential construction shown in Figure 4 and 5, in which the<br>
construction is used to compensate the signal from the meas-<br>
ured signal caused by the empty measuring coil 13 (impedance<br>
of the coil and ambient interference) away at the reference<br>
coil 18. Such a differential construction is shown in Figure<br>
4. In it, two identical spiral coils 13, 18 are connected in<br>
series and a high-frequency voltage or current signal 31 is<br>
fed over the coils, (typical variation intervals of current,<br>
voltage, and frequency above). In an ideal situation, it is<br>
possible to assume both coils 13, 18 to be completely identi-<br>
cal in inductance and resistance. Thus, the voltage over both<br>
coils 13, 18 should sum to zero in the intermediate output 15<br>
between the coils 13, 18. The magnetic particles deviated from<br>
this state of balance. The unbalance can be measured, for ex-<br>
ample as the current/voltage signal 32 of the intermediate<br>
output 15.<br>
The sensitivity of the devices 10 shown in Figures 4 and 5 can<br>
be increased by bringing the coil 13 or the; coils 13, 18 into<br>
resonance at a suitable frequency (particularly in the range<br>
106 - 108 Hz) . This can be implemented, for example, using<br>
separate LC circuits, by adding suitable capacitors in paral-<br>
lel or in series with the measuring coil / coils of the cir-<br>
cuit, as shown in Figure 6. The value of such a capacitor is<br>
determined from, among other things, the inductance of the<br>
coil and the desired resonance frequency. For the frequency<br>
range referred to, the capacitance can vary (for example, with<br><br>
a 50-nH coil) between 1 fF - 1 uF, more particularly 50 pF -<br>
500 nF.<br>
The measuring sensitivity can be further improved by using the<br>
bridge circuit shown in Figures 6 - 10, in which measurement<br>
takes place between the intermediate outputs 15. 17 of two<br>
differential structures. The use of this construction will<br>
achieve more greater sensitivity and interference tolerance.<br>
Figure 6 shows a general depiction of an impedance bridge, but<br>
also other types of bridge solution may be considered. Figure<br>
6 incudes some possible way of placing the resonance capaci-<br>
tors CR1 - CR6. At least some, or even all of these capacitors<br>
can be used. The capacitance of the capacitors is determined<br>
in a manner that is, as such, known, using the inductance of<br>
the coil and the desired resonance frequency as a basis. One<br>
example of the capacitance interval can be 1 fF - 1 F, more<br>
particularly 50 pF - 500 nF .<br>
The signal level of the system can be set to zero by feeding<br>
to the output of the system, such as, for example, to the out-<br>
put of the bridge measurement, or the output of the differen-<br>
tial measurement, a current and/or voltage signal of the oppo-<br>
site phase and the same amplitude.<br>
Figure 7 shows a simplified example of a measuring circuit,<br>
which can be applied in the coil arrangement 10 according to<br>
Figure 6. It will be obvious to one skilled in the art, that<br>
the measuring arrangement is not intended to restrict the ba-<br>
sic idea according to the invention, but is intended only as<br>
an example, by means of which measurements according to the<br>
invention can be performed.<br>
The first amplifier stage 24 shown in Figures 6 and 7 can be,<br>
for example, a low-noise (LNA), broadband differential ampli-<br>
fier, such as, for example, the Texas Instruments THS7530. In<br><br>
order to maximize noise immunity, the driving and/or the meas-<br>
uring side of: the bridge, i.e. the coil arrangement 10, can be<br>
made to float with transformers (not shown). After the ampli-<br>
fier 24, there can be quadrature detection, in order to elimi-<br>
nate low-frequency noise and 50-Hz interference, as well as to<br>
permit phase-difference measurements.<br>
The quadrature detection can be implemented using mixers 25,<br>
2 6 by mixing the output signal 32 with the sine of the input<br>
signal 31 formed by the DDS oscillator 23 (Inphase I) and the<br>
cosine formed by the DDS oscillator 27 (Quadrature Q) .<br>
The outputs of the I and Q mixers 25, 26 are filtered by low-<br>
pass filters 29.1, 29.2, amplified, and fed. to the 16-bit ADC<br>
30. A third DDS oscillator 33 is arranged to eliminate the<br>
difference of the coils 13, 18, 19, 20 belonging to the bridge<br>
10, which appears despite the symmetry and manufacturing pre-<br>
cision of the measuring bridge. By means of this feedback, an<br>
amplitude and phase-controlled equalization signal 34 is fed<br>
to the output of the bridge 10. The signal 34 forces the out-<br>
put of the bridge 10 to zero, when there are no magnetic par-<br>
ticles in the sphere of influence of the coil arrangement 10.<br>
In order to reduce the noise level, and prevent feed-through<br>
between the modules, the circuit includes the necessary<br>
shields and power-supply filters. In addition, each main mod-<br>
ule can have its own regulator (not shown).<br>
In the concept according to the invention, the output signal<br>
32 should be understood to be the raw signal measured, for ex-<br>
ample, directly from the bridge 10, or the raw signal, which<br>
is manipulated in a manner that is, as such, known, in order<br>
to permit measurement. In an ideal case, the raw signal is di-<br>
rectly proportional to the number of particles. Due to the<br>
non-idealities of the bridge 10, the output signal of the<br><br>
bridge 10 has generally offset. The offset is removed using a<br>
calibration signal 34. After this, the amplified signal is the<br>
measuring signal 32, directly proportional to the particles,<br>
from which measurement can be performed. Other kinds of signal<br>
manipulation will also be obvious to one skilled in the art,<br>
without, however, altering the basic idea of the invention.<br>
By altering the ratios of the shape and the dimensions (for<br>
example, in the plane of the coil) of both the measuring coil<br>
13 and of the reference 18 and/or the compensation coils 19,<br>
20, it is possible to reduce the measuring error caused by er-<br>
rors in the placing of the sample, and thus to increase the<br>
robustness of the system.<br>
It should be further noted that the factor that, in the device<br>
10 according to the invention, the reference of the measuring<br>
coil 13 comes directly from the adjacent, reference coil 18<br>
over a galvcinic contact. Through the galvanic contact, the<br>
measuring coil 13 and the reference coil 18 can be the same<br>
conductor/structure. Even with purely a direct contact between<br>
the coils 13, 18, without intermediate electronics will sur-<br>
prisingly eliminate interference. For example, errors due to<br>
poor components or asymmetry can be eliminated, if the basic<br>
construction is arranged to be as symmetrical and unified as<br>
possible.<br>
Figure 11 shows an example of an application, in which the<br>
change in the inductance of the coil arrangement, caused by<br>
magnetic particles, is measured as an amplitude measurement.<br>
In this case, the amplitude A of the output voltage 32 is<br>
measured as a function of the frequency from the intermediate<br>
output 15 of the measuring coil 13 and the reference coil 18,<br>
in which case the amplitude difference AA relative to the in-<br>
put voltage 31 is obtained. The change in inductance, indi-<br>
cated by the amplitude difference AA, is converted into an<br><br>
electric signal by feeding a sinusoidal input voltage over the<br>
measuring coil 13 and the reference coil 18. The voltage meas-<br>
ured from the so-called intermediate output 15 between the<br>
coils 13, 18 is determined from the ratio of the impedances<br>
(inductances) of the coils 13, 18, and is proportional to the<br>
number of magnetic particles. The frequency of the input sig-<br>
nal 31, i.e. the frequency at which the output signal 32 is<br>
measured, can be, for example, the resonance frequency of the<br>
coil system, but the use of other frequencies is also possi-<br>
ble.<br>
The insert of Figure 11 shows the input voltage as a function<br>
of time in a situation, like that in Figure 11. It is also pos-<br>
sible for changes in the frequency and/or phase of the signal<br>
to occur in such measurements. It should be noted that the<br>
signal need not be sinusoidal, but that it can also be, for<br>
example, a square wave, a triangular wave, a burst, or some<br>
other wave shape obvious to one skilled in the art.<br>
Figure 12 shows an example of a typical standard graph ob-<br>
tained using the manner of measuring of Figure 11. The change<br>
AA in amplitude measured is shown on the vertical axis while<br>
the relative number of particles is shown on the horizontal<br>
axis. The unit of the vertical axis can be, for example, the<br>
volt (V), current (I), or even the bit (Bit), when using an AD<br>
converter in the signal processing. As can be seen from Figure<br>
12, the real measurement results follow the great linearity of<br>
the logarithmic scale used, the value R2 depicting the devia-<br>
tion of the measurement results from the standard graph is<br>
0.99578.<br>
Figure 13 shows the content CRP (High-sensitivity C-reactive<br>
Protein) in a sample, measured using the measuring procedure<br>
of Figure 11. The measured change AA in amplitude is shown on<br>
the vertical axis and the CRP content in the sample, propor-<br><br>
tional to the number of magnetic particles, on the horizontal<br>
axis.<br>
Figure 14 shows an example of an application of a graph, in<br>
which, instead of the amplitude A, the phase difference Acp be-<br>
tween the input voltage 31 and the output voltage 3 2 is meas-<br>
ured. In this case too, the measurement was performed from<br>
(intermediate output 15) between the measuring coil 13 and the<br>
reference coil 18. In this case too, it is also possible for<br>
changes in the frequency and/or the amplitude to occur in the<br>
measurement. Instead of being sinusoidal, the signal can also<br>
be, for example, a square wave, triangular wave, burst, or<br>
some other signal shape obvious to one skilled in the art.<br>
In the device 10 according to the invention, it is possible to<br>
use almost ideal reference signals, which measure out the<br>
background (unspecifically bound magnetic particles) from the<br>
sample and remove, in addition, external interferences (for<br>
example the Earth's magnetic field).<br>
It must be understood that: the above description and the re-<br>
lated figures are only intended to illustrate the present in-<br>
vention. The invention is thus in no way restricted to only<br>
the embodiments disclosed or stated in the Claims, but many<br>
different variations and adaptations of the invention, which<br>
are possible within the scope on the inventive idea defined in<br>
the accompanying Claims, will be obvious to one skilled in the<br>
art.<br><br>
