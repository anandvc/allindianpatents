(d)	maintaining a table associating the recipient with its telephone number by the sending machine;<br>
(e)	retrieving the recipient phone number from the table by the facsimile<br><br>
apparatus automatically; and (f) placing a PSTN call to transmit the document.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further comprises a system for automatic initiation of a PSTN call upon failure of Internet facsimile call comprising:<br>
(a)	a means for initiating a call by the sending machine to transmit a Fax document using the Internet Fax;<br>
(b)	a means for establishing a fax session with a remote end point which is connected to the PSTN and IP networks either directly, when it is an Internet aware fax device or through a gateway when it is group 3 facsimile device;<br>
(c)	a means for sending the Called Subscriber Identification at the start of the call by the called party which contains the specific identity of the called subscriber by its international telephone number; and<br>
(d)	a table associating the recipient with its telephone number maintained by the sending machine.<br>
The other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and the detailed description as follows:<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 depicts the entire system of the present invention. The sending machine which is an Internet aware device is connected to both PSTN as well as IP network. The receiver can be another lAF (Internet Aware Facsimile) device or a G3FE to which call gets routed through a gateway. Upon failure of the Internet fax, the receiving machine is reached through the PSTN line by using the proposed method.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiment is merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
STRUCTURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method and system whereby the apparatus is able to, without any manual intervention, initiate a PSTN call upon failure of Internet fax.<br>
OPERATION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Following are the steps involved in the method proposed in the present invention:<br>
A call is initiated by the sending machine to transmit a Fax document using the Internet Fax. A fax session is established with a remote end point which is connected to the PSTN and IP networks either directly, if it is an internet aware fax device or through a gateway if it is a group 3 facsimile device.<br>
At the start of the call, the called party sends the CSI (Called Subscriber Identification), which contains the specific identity of the called subscriber which identity may be its international telephone number.<br><br>
The sending machine maintains a table associating the recipient with its telephone number which is updated as and when the CSI information is received.<br>
When the Internet fax call fails to transmit data successfully, the facsimile apparatus automatically retrieves the recipient phone number from the said table and places a PSTN call to transmit the document.<br>
The present invention provides a system for automatic initiation of a PSTN call upon failure of Internet facsimile call and comprises a means for initiating a call by the sending machine to transmit a Fax document using the Internet Fax, means for transferring the call to a remote end point which is connected to the PSTN network either directly, when it is an Internet aware fax device or through a gateway when it is group 3 facsimile device, means for sending the Called Subscriber Identification at the start of the call by the called party which contains the specific identity of the called subscriber by its international telephone number and a table associating the recipient with its telephone number maintained by the sending machine through a User Interface the user can select whether he wants to automatically forward the fax to the PSTN or not.<br>
Figure 1 depicts the entire system of the present invention. Following are the components of the system.<br>
•	lAF - Internet Aware Facsimile device which is connected to the IP network as well as the PSTN network.<br>
•	G3FE - Group 3 Facsimile equipment which is connected to the PSTN network.<br>
•	Gateway - A routing device which is connected to the IP network as well as the PSTN network. The gateway receives the fax commands and image over the PSTN line from the G3FE and forms T.38 fax packets and transmits to the lAF over the IP network. It also receives T.38 packets containing fax commands and image data from the lAF through IP network and after removing the T.38 headers transfers the same over PSTN line to the G3FE In the above depicted system an Internet fax can be sent between:<br><br>
•	A G3FE and an lAF through a gateway,<br>
•	Two lAF devices.<br>
When an Internet Fax call fails the PSTN phone number of the recipient is dialed by the suggested method and through the PSTN network a fax session is established and the required document is transmitted.<br>
The advantage of the present invention is that manual intervention in terms of knowing and entering the remote machine telephone number upon failure of Internet fax is eliminated.<br>
This method allows for a better system whereby upon failure of Internet fax, the document still gets transmitted to the recipient through PSTN line automatically.<br>
