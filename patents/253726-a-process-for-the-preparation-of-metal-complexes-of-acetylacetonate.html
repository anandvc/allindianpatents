				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparation of metal complexes of acetylacetonate. Moreover this invention particularly relates to an improved, economical and environmentally benign process for metal complexes of acetylacetone having the general formula, M(acac)n wherein M is a metal cation selected from the group consisting of Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Al, Ca, Mg, Mo, Ru, Re, U Th, Ce, Na, K, Rb, Cs, V, Cr, and Mn etc., n is an integer which corresponds to the electrovalence of M, are obtained by reacting the corresponding metal hydroxide, metal hydrated oxide or metal oxide with a stoichiometric amount of acetylacetone (acacH, CsHgC). BACK GROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Metal acetylacetonates are highly efficient catalysts for a wide variety of organic transformations such as oligomerization, polymerization, hydrogenation, isomerization, coupling etc. They are also used in rubber technology for vulcanization, for extraction and separation of metals, as NMR shift reagents, in microelectronic devices, for synthesis of high quality semiconductor materials for optoelectronic devices, for separation of enantiomers, as a source of metal or metal oxides for controlled deposition, as fungicides, in pigments as color stabilizers, as carbon scavengers for diesel fuels, as combustion control catalysts for rocket fuels, and in laser technology. Metal acetylacetonates, often referred as metal chelates, are well known in the art as witnessed for example by U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,231,597 and 3,291,660. Reference may be made to British Pat. No.289,493 wherein preparation of metal acetylacetonates was carried out by the reaction of excess of acetylacetone or a solution of a solid salt of it in an inert solvent followed by refluxing the metal oxide, hydroxide, carbonate or basic carbonate of the metal. The disadvantages are the reactions are slow with quite poor yields, and requirement of solvent and energy. Reference may be made to J.Chem.Soc, 1938, 1254 and Inorg. Syntheses, 1946, 2,119 wherein preparation of metal acetylacetonates was carried out in nonaqueous solution by the reaction of metal salt and acetylacetone. The disadvantage here is that this method is applicable to those metal salts only that are soluble in the chosen nonaqueous solvent. <br>
Reference may be made to Compt.Rend., 1943. 157.30 wherein preparation of metal acetylacetonates was carried out by the reaction of acetylacetone with a metal oxide, hydroxide, carbonate or basic carbonate in aqueous solution. The disadvantages<br>
are: the reaction is very sluggish and the possibility of contamination with the byproducts.<br>
Reference may be made to J.Chem.Soc., 1947, 1084 and J.Am.Chem.Soc.. 1948, 70. 3142 wherein the metal acetylacetonates were prepared by the reaction of acetylacetone with a metal oxide, hydroxide, carbonate or basic carbonate in aqueous solution and controlling the pH of the solution by gradual addition of a weak base such as ammonia. The disadvantages are: unless care is exercised there is high probability of the end product being contaminated by metal hydroxide or basic salt, the use of buffer leading to the addition of extraneous ion. which in turn may contaminate the product. Addition of ammonia may result in high local concentration causing precipitation of metal hydroxide of basic diketone derivatives.<br>
Reference may be made to J.Chem.Soc., 1925, 2379 and J.Org.Chem.. 1948, 13. 249 wherein preparation of metal acetylacetonates was carried out in anhydrous inert medium containing the ligand and metal. The disadvantage is that this method is applicable to the synthesis of only active metal derivatives such as alkali metals, alkaline earth metals etc.<br>
Reference may be made to Anal.Chem.A95\, 23,174 wherein Mn(acacb was prepared by the reduction of MnCU by acetylacetone. The disadvantages are requirement of unstable Mn(IV) compound, involvement of an extra preparation step and contamination of the end product by chloride.<br>
Reference may be made to J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1951, 73. 4416 and Inorg. Syntheses, 1966.7,183 wherein Mn(acac)3 was prepared by air or chlorine oxidation of a basic solution of Mn2+ in the presence of acacH. or by KMnC&gt;4 oxidation of Mn2^ in the presence of acacH and a large excess of sodium acetate. The disadvantages are the deleterious effect of alkali on the end product, contamination by chloride ions, or by sodium acetate.<br><br>
Reference may be made to J.Am.Chem.Soc., 1953, 75, 2446 wherein uranium(VI) (c.f. UOj2+) acetylacetonate was prepared by using sodium hydroxide for adjusting the pH conducive to the synthesis. The disadvantages are contamination of the product because of the use of a large quantity of alkali and involvement of extra purification steps.<br>
Reference may be made to J.Am.Chem.Soc., 1953, 75, 2736 wherein preparation of metal acetylacetonates was carried out by the reaction of soluble salt of acetylacetone with a soluble salt of metal. The disadvantages are prior preparation of the salt of acetylacetone and reactions being conducted at higher pH causing the formation of by products such as M(acac)x , M(acac)OH and M(acac)3<br>
Reference may be made to Anal.Chem.,1953, 25,881 and 1954, 26,375 wherein preparation of metal acetylacetonates was carried out by incorporating solvent extraction. An immiscible liquid was added to the reaction mixture to extract the desired metal. The disadvantage is that some of the side products formed are also extracted with the pure product due to their partial solubility.<br>
Reference may be made to Inorg. Syntheses, 1957, 5, 105 wherein the metal acetylacetonates were prepared by the reaction of the metal ion and acetylacetone, i.e., by chelation of the metal ion by the bidentate ligand. As a consequence it releases proton decreasing the pH of the reaction mixture. Unless the metal chelate is highly soluble, the reaction between the metal ion and acetylacetone will come to equilibrium short of completion because of the increase in concentration of free acid in the solution. The pH suitable for the successful synthesis of metal acetylacetonates was ascertained to be 5.5. In order to shift the equilibrium to the right acidity generated, as mentioned above, can be controlled by the use of a suitable buffer. For this reason the use of acetate is recommended for such preparations. In some case homogeneous generation of ammonia in the reaction solution can be achieved by adding urea to the solution and heating. The disadvantage is that the direct reaction of acetylacetone and a salt in water is limited by the low solubility of metal acetylacetonate. And there is a definite possibility of contamination of the product by the buffer, ammonia, or acetate.<br>
Reference may be made to a US patent 3946057 wherein the preparation of metal acetylacetonates was achieved from the reaction of acetylacetone with a metal<br><br>
halide or hydroxide thereof in the presence of alkyne oxide and organic solvents. The disadvantages are contamination by chloride, partial reaction with HC1, expensive alkyne oxide and use of organic solvents. Alkali metal halides have not been found suitable for use in this process.<br>
Reference may be made to a US patent 4008260 wherein the Co (II) acetylacetonate was first made and then reacted with acacH in an organic solvent and 30% H2O2 in higher proportions under reflux. The disadvantages are extra preparation of Co(II) acetylacetonate, use of organic solvents and a high amount of H2O2 and temperature.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The novelty of the invention lies in the use of two general methodologies for the preparation of metal acetylacetonates, one based on Acid-base and the other on Electron-Transfer (Redox ) concept.<br><br>
1.	Acid-base reaction<br>
Because of the presence of active methylene hydrogen, acetylacetone shows weak acidity (pH-5). Making use of this knowledge an interaction of acetylacetone with metal hydroxide or hydrated metal oxide led to an acid-base type of reaction thereby bringing about coordination of acetylacetonate with the metal center. Accordingly, based on this philosophy a large number of metal acetylacetonates have been successfully synthesized in high yields and purity.<br>
M(OH)X + x acacH    	&gt; M(acac)x  +   x H2O<br>
Typically, what was done was that a freshly prepared alkali-free metal hydroxide was allowed to react with acetylacetone. Consequently, a clear and colored solution or in some cases a microcrystalline product was obtained. The pH of the reaction solution recorded was found to lie at 5-6. The solution or the microcrystalline product was cooled in an ice water bath and the product was separated by filtration or centrifugation in high yield.<br>
2.	Redox reaction<br>
While the coordination and chelating ability of acetylacetone ligand was already an established fact, the capability of acetylacetone to participate in Electron-Transfer reactions with higher valent metals is unknown. A new general methodology is developed in that the synthesis of metal acetylacetonates in relatively low oxidation states should be possible by an effective Electron-Transfer reaction between an appropriate metal at its higher oxidation state and acetylacetone. A number of acetylacetonates have been prepared from the reaction of the corresponding metal in higher oxidation state and acetylacetone.<br>
[Nim O(OH)] + 3 acacH 	». Ni(acac)2 + '/2 (acac-acac) + 2 H2O<br>
Although the fact that acetylacetone has acted as a reducing agent is amply clear, a direct evidence to this assertion was also obtained from the isolation of cc,a,p,(3-tetraacetylethane as the oxidized product of acetylacetone as shown below:<br>
(CH3 CO)2CH - CH (CH3 CO)2<br>
Also significant is to mention that the pH of the reaction solution was spontaneously maintained to 5 or 5.5 in both the methods thereby providing a condition<br><br>
conducive to the successful synthesis of the desired compound. Thus the invention provides an economically viable process for metal acetylacetonates.<br>
Scientific explanation: The principle of the present invention is to prepare metal acetyacetonates by an improved, economical and environmentally benign process. Two general methodologies have been developed to provide an easy access to metal acetylacetonates of diverse stoichiometries. While one protocol is based on Acid -Base reaction concept, the other stands on Redox concept.<br>
The basis of the Acid -Base reaction is the following. Because of the presence of active methylenic hydrogen, acetylacetone shows weak acidity (pH~5). An interaction of acetylacetone (acacH) with metal hydroxide or hydrated metal oxide (basic) allows an Acid-Base reaction to take place leading to the formation of the desired chelated or ionic metal acetylacetonates in very high yields and purity.<br>
M(OH)X + x acacH	*  M(acac)x  +   x H2O<br>
Typically, a freshly prepared alkali-free metal hydroxide or hydrated metal oxide is directly reacted with stoichiometric amount of distilled acetylacetone to afford crystalline acetylacetonates of metals. The reactions are generally exothermic enough thereby rendering an extraneous heating redundant. The pH of the reaction solution lie at 5-6.<br>
Interestingly, acetylacetone (acacH) has been also known to have reducing property, although the oxidized product formed in such a reaction was not known until 1983 (our paper J.Chem. Soc. Dalton trans., 1983, 2561). It has been shown now that a higher valent hydroxo, an oxo-metal or any other suitable metal species is capable of effectively participating in electron -transfer reaction between the higher valent metal and acacH, thereby reducing the metal ion to a relatively lower oxidation state. The metal ion so formed is then trapped by the acetylacetonate (acac", CsPT/C^ "), made available in the reaction solution by providing the requisite amount of the ligand -cum reducing agent at the beginning of the reaction, thereby giving the desired metal acetylacetonate in very high yields and purity. Here again, the pH of the reaction is recorded to be 5.5 and no extraneous heating is required in some cases, as the reactions are exothermic.<br><br>
