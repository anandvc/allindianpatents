				<td>SECURITY DOCUMENT AND SECURITY ELEMENT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention concerns a printed valuable document such as a<br>
security document with at least one authentication mark in the form of a luminescent<br>
substance based on a host lattice doped with at least one rare earth metal.<br>
The protection of valuable documents by means of luminescent substances has been<br>
known for a long time. The use of rare earth metals in this connection has also been<br>
discussed. These have the advantage of possessing, in the infra-red spectral region,<br>
narrow-band emission lines, which are particularly characteristic, and can therefore be<br>
safely distinguished from the emissions of other substances when using measuring<br>
technology. In order to increase protection against counterfeiting still further, the rare<br>
earth metals can be incorporated together with other substances in host lattices, with<br>
the result that the excitation and/or emission spectrum of the rare earth metal is<br>
influenced in a characteristic manner. By combination with suitably absorptive<br>
substances, tor example, a part of the excitation and/or emission bands of the rare<br>
earth metal can be suppressed. This influence can. however, also take the form of a<br>
"distortion". e.g. through damping of specific regions of broad-band spectra.<br>
Likewise for reasons of protection against counterfeiting, rare earth metals with<br>
emission lines above 1500 nm are frequently used, since detection of the emission<br>
becomes more elaborate and more difficult the further into the IR spectral region the<br>
emission lines lie, For in very general terms, the principle applies that the detection<br>
sensitivity of photodetectors decreases the longer the wavelength of the radiation to be<br>
measured, since the signal-to-noise ratio becomes smaller in the same proportion; i.e.<br>
the signals to be detected are more and more difficult to identify in the noise. The<br>
luminescent substances must therefore also be present in the valuable document in a<br>
certain minimum concentration, in order to be able, to produce an adequate signal<br>
strength, which can be reliably detected in the noise. In certain instances, however,<br>
these limit concentrations necessary for detection cannot be produced; for example, if<br>
the luminescent substances have their own colour, which destroys the desired colour<br>
impression when mixed with the material of the valuable document. In some cases, the<br>
attempt is also made to reduce the risk of detection by chemical analysis of the<br>
luminescent substances contained in a valuable document by the fact that the<br>
luminescent substances are applied only in very small concentrations.<br>
In such cases, luminescent substances must be avoided for which the emission lines<br>
can be readily detected even in small concentrations.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the aim of providing a valuable document with a<br>
luminescent substance producing emissions in the near IR spectral region so that, even<br>
at low concentrations, the presence of the luminescent substance can be demonstrated<br>
in the valuable document.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a security document, with at least one<br>
authentication mark in the form of a luminescent substance, comprising a substrate<br>
material supporting said luminescent substance, wherein the luminescent substance is<br>
based on a host lattice doped with at least one rare earth metal, which largely absorbs<br>
light in the entire visible region of the spectrum, is excitable in substantial parts of the<br>
visible region of the spectrum and is at least partially transparent at least in the<br>
wavelength range between 0.8 and 1.1 urn, wherein the rare earth metal emits in the<br>
wavelength range between 0.8 and 1.1 urn, and the host lattice has a garnet of<br>
perovskite structure.<br>
Preferably, the rare earth metal is ytterbium, praseodymium, or neodymium. Preferably,<br>
the host lattice contains chromium as the absorptive component. The garnet structure<br>
can be described by the general formula A3Cr5.xAlxO12, where AD stands for an element<br>
from the group of scandium, yttrium, the lanthanides, the actinides, and the index x<br>
fulfills the condition 0 
luminescent substance can be described by the formula Y3. 2DzCr5. x AlxO12, where D<br>
stands for an element from the group of neodymium, praseodymium, or ytterbium, and<br>
the index z fulfills the condition 0 
the general formula ACrO3, where A stands for an element from the group of yttrium,<br>
scandium, or the lanthanides. The luminescent substance can be described according<br>
to the formula Y1 . zDzCrO3, where D stands for an element from the group of<br>
neodymium, praseodymium, or ytterbium, and the index z fulfills the condition 0 
Preferably, the luminescent substance is mixed into a printing ink, which additionally<br>
contains visible colour additives or the luminescent substance is mixed into the paper<br>
pulp. Preferably, the luminescent substance is provided on or in said substrate material,<br>
which is at least partially embedded in the paper pulp. The substrate material may<br>
consist of plastic or may take the form of a security thread or mottling fibre. The<br>
luminescent substance is provided as an invisible and at least partial coating on the<br>
substrate material. Tthe coating takes the form of a stripe. The luminescent substance<br>
may be provided in the volume of the substrate material. The luminescent substance is<br>
present in the substrate material in a concentration between 0.01 and 10% by weight,<br>
and preferably between 0.1 and 5% by weight. The luminescent substance is present in<br>
a layer applied to the substrate material. The luminescent substance is preferably<br>
present in a printing ink in a concentration between 0.5 and 40% by weight, and<br>
preferably between 20 and 30% by weight. The substrate material may consist of plastic<br>
or paper. The substrate material may take the form of a security thread, mottling fibre,<br>
planchet, or label.<br>
The present invention also provides a security element, which features at least one<br>
substrate material supporting and one luminescent substance based on a host lattice<br>
doped with at least one rare earth metal, which largely absorbs light in the entire visible<br>
spectral region, is excitable in substantial parts of the visible spectral region, and is at<br>
least partially transparent at least in the wavelength range between 0.8 and 1.1 urn,<br>
whereby the rare earth metal emits in the wavelength range between 0.8 and 1.1 urn,<br>
and the host lattice has a garnet of perovskite structure. Preferably, the luminescent<br>
substance is provided in the volume of the substrate material. The luminescent<br>
substance is present in the substrate material in a concentration between 0.01 and 10%<br>
by weight, and preferably between 0.1 and 5% by weight. The luminescent substance<br>
is present in a layer applied to the substrate material. The luminescent substance is<br>
present in a printing ink in a concentration between 0.5 and 40% by weight, and<br>
preferably between 20 and 30% by weight. The substrate material may consist of plastic<br>
or paper. The substrate material may take the form of a security thread, mottling fibre,<br>
planchet, or label.<br>
The valuable document according ro the invention contains at least one luminescent<br>
substance based on host lattices doped with rare earth metal, such that the rare earth<br>
metal emits in the near IR spectral region, i.e. in the wavelength range of between O.S<br>
µm and. 1.1 µm. This emission range has the advantage that its existence can be<br>
readily detected with a silicon (Si), gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium-indium-arsenide<br>
(Ga,Jn,.,As) or germanium (Ge) photodetector, since these have a relatively high<br>
response sensitivity in this wavelength region. As optically active rare earth metals,<br>
consideration may be given to the elements ytterbium, neodymium. or praseodymium,<br>
or mixtures of these elements with one or more other rare earth metals.<br>
These rare earth metals are embedded in a host lattice, which has effective excitation<br>
bands in the visible region of the spectrum, and transfers these excitation bands to the<br>
rare earth metals. The effective excitation bands can be realised by. for example,<br>
chromium structural elements which, according to the invention, are incorporated in a<br>
garnet or perovskite structure.<br>
Tn this situation, the host lattice possesses an optical window in the near infrared<br>
spectral region, and absorbs in virtually the entire visible region of the spectrum, so<br>
that all the lines in the visible spectral region of the luminescent substance are<br>
suppressed. The excitation range of the luminescent substances overlaps the radiation<br>
range of strong light sources, such as halogen lamps, flash lamps, and similar sources.<br>
As a result of this, and due to the effective energy transfer to the rare earth metals<br>
within the host lattice, it is possible to use very small quantities of substance with the<br>
valuable documents according to the invention, without the automatic detection<br>
capability being restricted. Detection by means of chemical analysis, however, is<br>
rendered extremely difficult due to the low concentration.<br>
The ahsorptive constituents of the host lattice may in part be replaced by non-<br>
absorptive aluminium. The absorption, and therefore the brightness of the luminescent<br>
substance, can be controlled through the proportion of aluminium. Luminescent<br>
substances of this type cau therefore also be used as additives for lighter printing inks.<br>
Further embodiments and advantages of the invention are explained hereinafter on the<br>
basis of the accompanying drawings:<br>
Fig. 1 Excitation spectrum of a chromium-containing lattice according to the<br>
invention<br>
Fig. 2 Spectra of several light sources<br>
Fig. 3 Emission spectrum of a luminescent substance according to the<br>
invention, doped with Pr<br>
Fig. 4 Emission spectrum of a luminescent substance according to the<br>
invention, doped with Nd<br>
Fig. 5 Emission spectrum of a luminescent substance according to the<br>
invention, doped with Yb<br>
Fig. 6 Security element according to the invention, in a cross-sectional view<br>
Fig. 1 shows the excitation spectrum of a chromium-containing lattice according to the<br>
invention. This lattice absorbs in almost the entire visible spectral region. Due to this<br>
very broad-band absorption of the host lattice, the lines produced in this region by the<br>
rare earth metal dopings are suppressed. At the same tune, an energy transfer from the<br>
lattice to the rare earth doping takes place, thereby inducing the emission by the<br>
luminescent substance.<br>
The broadband absorption of the lattice also has the advantage that strong light sources<br>
can be used for the excitation of the luminescent substances, such as flash lamps,<br>
which likewise emit radiation in the entire visible region of the spectrum.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the spectrum of such a flash lamp with the reference character 1. The<br>
spectrum 1 of the flash lamp shown extends continuously from the UV spectral region<br>
into the IR region. In some cases, it may also be a good idea to illuminate the<br>
luminescent substance only with light from the visible spectrum range. In this case,<br>
illumination with light-emitting diodes offers the appropriate wavelength. Light-<br>
emitting diodes feature in general a narrow-band spectrum so that, to cover the entire<br>
spectral range, several LEDs are required. Fig. 2 shows the spectra 2, 3, 4 of a green,<br>
orange, and red light-emitting diode.<br>
Figs. 3, 4 and 5 show the emission spectra of individual luminescent substances<br>
according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 3 shows the emission spectrum of a host lattice doped with Pr. The spectrum<br>
extends from about 0.9 µm to about 1.08 urn. It features a very characteristic number<br>
of emission peaks, which can be assessed very satisfactorily as authentication features.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the characteristic spectrum of a lattice doped with Nd. This spectrum<br>
features two relatively strong emission peaks in the range from about 0.9 µm to just<br>
under 1.1 µm. A somewhat smaller peak is additionally located in the region of 0.95<br><br>
The spectrum shown in Fig. 5 of a Yd-doped lattice is, by contrast, very symmetrical<br>
and shows only one peak, the maximum of which is at 1.0 urn.<br>
All these Iarrices according to the invention have the factor in common that they show<br>
a very striking luminescence emission in the near infrared region, i.e. in the range<br>
between 0.8 µm and 1.1 µm, which is difficult to identify. Although all three emission<br>
spectra are arranged in the same spectral region, they differ from one another so<br>
unambiguously that differentiation with measuring equipment is readily possible.<br>
In order to guarantee the highest possible effectiveness of the rare earth metals, in the<br>
case of a garnet structuie, host lattices are used with the general formula:<br>
A3Cr5-xAlxO12<br>
where A stands for an element from the group of scandium, yttrium, the lanthanides,<br>
and the actinides, and the index x fulfils the condition 0 
index x moves in the range between 0.3 and 2.5.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the luminescent substance according to the invention is:<br>
Y3-2.D2Cr5-xAlxO12<br>
where D srands for neodymium, praseodymium, or ytterbium, and the index z fulfils<br>
the condition 0 
If the host lattice has a perovskite structure, it can be described by the general<br>
formula:<br>
ACrO3<br>
where A stands for an element from the group of yttrium, scandium, and the<br>
lanthanides.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the luminescence substance according to the invention is a<br>
perovskite structure can be described by the following formula:<br>
Y1-XD2CrO3<br>
where D stands for one of the elements neodymium, praseodymium, or ytterbium, and<br>
the index z fulfils the condition 0

The luminescent substances can, according to the invention, be introduced to the<br>
valuable document in a variety of different ways. For example, the luminescent<br>
substances can be mixed into a printing ink, which additionally contains visible colour<br>
additives. Mixing of the luminescent substances into a paper pulp is also possible.<br>
Likewise, the luminescent substances can be applied on or in a plastic substrate<br>
material, which, for example, is at least partially embedded in a paper pulp. The<br>
substrate material may in this case take the form of a safety thread, a mottling thread,<br>
or a planchet<br>
The plastic or paper substrate material can, however, also be attached to any other<br>
desired object, for example, for product security. In this case, the substrate material is<br>
preferably made in the form of a label. If the substrate material is a constituent part of<br>
the object which is to be secured, as is the case, for example, with tear-off threads,<br>
any other shape is naturally also possible. In specific application instances it may be a<br>
good idea for the luminescent substance to be provided as an invisible coating on the<br>
valuable document. It may then be present over the entire surface, or in the form of<br>
specific patterns, such as stripes, lines, circles, or in the form of alphanumeric<br>
symbols.<br>
The designation "valuable document " is to be understood in the context of the<br>
invention to mean items such as bank notes, cheques, shares, stamps, identity cards,<br>
credit cards, passes, and other documents, as well as labels, seals, packaging, or other<br>
elements for product security.<br>
Fig. 6 shows an embodiment of a security element according to the invention. The<br>
security element consists in this case of a label 5. which is composed of a paper or<br>
plastic layer 6, a transparent covering layer 7, and an adhesive layer 8. This label 5 is<br>
attached to the desired substrate 10 by means of the adhesive layer 8. This substrate 10<br>
may be a valuable document, identity card, pass, certificate, or similar item, or odier<br>
document to be safeguarded, such as CDs, packaging, etc.<br>
The luminescent substance 9 in this embodiment is contained in the volume of the<br>
layer 6. If this layer 6 is a paper layer, then the concentration of luminescent substance<br>
is between 0.05 and 1 % by weight. The core of luminescent substrate in the substrate<br>
(paper) is preferably in the range of 0.01 to 10% by weight<br>
As an alternative, the luminescent substance may also be contained in a printing ink,<br>
not shown, which is printed on one of the layers of the label, preferably on the surface<br>
of the layer 6. The concentration of luminescent substance in the printing ink varies in<br>
this case in the range between 10 and 30 % by weight. The core of luminescent<br>
substance in the printing ink is preferably in the range of 0.5 to 40% by weight.<br>
Instead of the luminescent substance being present in or on a substrate material, which<br>
is then attached as a security element to an object, it is also possible according to the<br>
invention for the luminescent substance to be provided directly in the valuable<br>
document to be safeguarded, or onto its surface, in the form of coating.<br>
