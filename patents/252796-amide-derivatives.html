				<td>AMIDE DERIVATIVES<br>
This invention concerns certain amide derivatives which are useful as inhibitors of cytokine mediated disease. The invention also concerns processes for the manufacture of the amide derivatives of the invention, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their<br>
use in therapeutic methods, for example by virtue of inhibition of cytokine mediated disease.<br>
i<br>
The amide derivatives disclosed in the present invention are inhibitors of the production of cytokines such as Tumour Necrosis Factor (hereinafter TNF), for example TNFa, and various members of the interleukin (hereinafter IL) family, for example IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8. Accordingly the compounds of the invention will be useful in the treatment of diseases or medical conditions in which excessive production of cytokines occurs, for example excessive production of TNFa or IL-1. It is known that cytokines are produced by a wide variety of cells such as monocytes and macrophages and that they give rise to a variety of physiological effects which are believed to be important in disease or medical conditions such as inflammation and immunoregulation. For example, TNFa and IL-1 have been implicated in the cell signalling cascade which is believed to contribute to the pathology of disease states such as inflammatory and allergic diseases and cytokine-induced toxicity. It is also known that, in certain cellular systems, TNFa production precedes and mediates the production of other cytokines such as IL-1.<br>
Abnormal levels of cytokines have also been implicated in, for example, the production of physiologically-active eicosanoids such as the prostaglandins and leukotrienes, the stimulation of the release of proteolytic enzymes such as collagenase, the activation of the immune system, for example by stimulation of T-helper cells, the activation of osteoclast activity leading to the resorption of calcium, the stimulation of the release of proteoglycans from, for example, cartilage, the stimulation of cell proliferation and to angiogenesis.<br>
Cytokines are also believed to be implicated in the production and development of disease states such as inflammatory and allergic diseases, for example inflammation of the joints (especially rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and gout), inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (especially inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and gastritis), skin disease (especially psoriasis, eczema and dermatitis) and respiratory disease (especially asthma, bronchitis, allergic rhinitis, adult respiratory distress<br><br>
syndrome and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and in the production and development of various cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders such as congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, hypertension, platelet aggregation, angina, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, reperfusion injury, vascular injury including restenosis and peripheral vascular disease, and, for example, various disorders of bone metabolism such as osteoporosis (including senile and postmenopausal osteoporosis), Paget's disease, bone metastases, hypercalcaemia, hyperparathyroidism, osteosclerosis, osteoperosis and periodontitis, and the abnormal changes in bone metabolism which may accompany rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Excessive cytokine production has also been implicated in mediating certain complications of bacterial, fungal and/or viral infections such as endotoxic shock, septic shock and toxic shock syndrome and in mediating certain complications of CNS surgery or injury such as neurotrauma and ischaemic stroke. Excessive cytokine production has also been implicated in mediating or exacerbating the development of diseases involving cartilage or muscle resorption, pulmonary fibrosis, cirrhosis, renal fibrosis, the cachexia found in certain chronic diseases such as malignant disease and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), tumour invasiveness and tumour metastasis and multiple sclerosis.<br>
Evidence of the central role played by TNFoc in the cell signalling cascade which gives rise to rheumatoid arthritis is provided by the efficacy in clinical studies of antibodies of TNFa (The Lancet, 1994, 344, 1125 and British Journal of Rheumatology. 1995, 34, 334).<br>
Thus cytokines such as TNFa and IL-1 are believed to be important mediators of a<br>
^<br>
considerable range of diseases and medical conditions. Accordingly it is expected that inhibition of the production of and/or effects of these cytokines will be of benefit in the prophylaxis, control or treatment of such diseases and medical conditions.<br>
Without wishing to imply that the compounds disclosed in the present invention possess pharmacological activity only by virtue of an effect on a single biological process, it is believed that the compounds inhibit the effects of cytokines by virtue of inhibition of the enzyme p38 kinase. p38 kinase, otherwise known as cytokine suppressive binding protein (hereinafter CSBP) and reactivating kinase'(hereinafter RK), is a member of the mitogen-activated protein (hereinafter MAP) kinase family of enzymes which is known to be activated by physiological stress such as that induced by ionising radiation, cytotoxic agents, and<br><br>
toxms, for example endotoxins such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide. and by a variety of agents such as the cytokmes, for example TNFa and IL-1. It is known that p38 kinase phosphorylates certain intracellular proteins which are involved in the cascade of enzymatic steps which leads to the biosynthesis and excretion of cytokmes such as TNFa and IL-1. Known inhibitors of p38 kinase have been reviewed by G J Hanson in Expert Opinions on Therapeutic Patents, 1997, 7, 729-733. p38 kinase is known to exist in isoforms identified as p38aandp38(3.<br>
The compounds disclosed in the present invention are inhibitors of the production of cytokines such as TNF, in particular of TNFa, and various interleukins, in particular IL-1.<br>
Certain 3-(5-benzamido-2-methylphenyl)-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-4-one derivatives were disclosed in Chemical Abstracts, volume 77, abstract 19599. The disclosed compounds included :- 3-(5-benzamido-2-methylphenyl)-2-methyl-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-4-one, 3-[5-(4-methylbenzarnido)-2-methylphenyl]-2-methyl-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-4-one and 3-[5-(4-methoxyben2.amido)-2-methylphenyl]-2-methyl-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-4-one.<br>

Biological Assays<br>
The following assays can be used to measure the p38 kinase-inhibitory, the TNF-inhibitory and anti-arthritic effects of the compounds of the present invention:<br>
In vitro enzyme assay<br>
The ability of compounds of the invention to inhibit the enzyme p38 kinase was assessed. Activity of test compounds against each of the p38a and p38[3 isoforms of the enzyme was determined.<br>
Human recombinant MKK6 (GenBank Accesion Number G1209672) was isolated from Image clone 45578 (Genomics, 1996, 33, 151) and utilised to produce protein in the form of a GST fusion protein in a pGEX vector using analogous procedures to those disclosed by J. Han et al.. Journal of Biological Chemistry, 1996, 271. 2886-2891. p38a (GenBank Accession Number G529039) and p38(3 (GenBank Accession Number G1469305) were isolated by PCR amplification of human lymphoblastoid cDNA (GenBank Accession Number GM1416) and human foetal brain cDNA [synthesised from mRNA (Clontech, catalogue no. 6525-1) using a Gibco superscript cDNA synthesis kit] respectively using oligonucleotides designed for the 5' and 3' ends of the human p38oc and p38p genes using analogous procedures to those described by J.Han et al, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1995, 1265, 224-227 and Y. Jiang et al, Journal of Biological Chemistry. 1996, 271. 17920-17926,<br>
Both p38 protein isoforms were expressed in e coli in PET vectors. Human recombinant p38a and p38p isoforms were produced as 5' c-myc, 6His tagged proteins. Both MKK6 and the p38 proteins were purified using standard protocols: the GST MKK6 was purified using a glutathione sepharose column and the p38 proteins were purified using nickel chelate columns.<br>
:<br>
The p38 enzymes were activated prior to use by incubation with MKK6 for 3 hours at 30°C. The unactivated coli-expressed MKK6 retained sufficient activity to fully activate both isoforms of p38. The activation incubate comprised p38cc (lOul of lOmg/ml) or p38p (lOul of 5mg/ml) together with MKK6 (lOul of Img/ml), 'Kinase buffer' [100(il; pH 7.4 buffer comprising Tris (50mM), EGTA (O.lmM), sodium orthovanadate (O.lmM) and fi-mercaptoethanol (0.1%)] and MgATP (30ul of 50mM Mg(OCOCH3)2 and 0.5mM ATP). This produced enough activated p38 enzyme for 3 Microtiter plates.<br>
Test compounds were solubilised in DMSO and lOul of a 1:10 diluted sample in 'Kinase Buffer' was added to a well in a Microtiter plate. For single dose testing, the compounds were tested at lOuM. 'Kinase Assay Mix' [30ul; comprising Myelin Basic<br>
Protein (Gibco BRL cat. no. 1322B-010; 1ml of a 3.33mg/ml solution in water), activated p38 enzyme (50ul) and 'Kinase Buffer' (2ml)] was then added followed by 'Labelled ATP' [lOul; comprising 50uM ATP, 0. luCi 33P ATP (Amersham International cat. no. BF1000) and 50mM Mg(OCOCH3)2]. The plates were incubated at room temperature with gentle agitation. Plates containing p38a were incubated for 90min and plates containing p38(3 were incubated for 45min. Incubation was stopped by the addition of SOjal of 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The precipitated protein was phosphorylated by p38 kinase and test compounds were assessed for their ability to inhibit this phosphorylation. The plates were filtered using a Canberra Packard Unifilter and washed with 2% TCA, dried overnight and counted on a Top Count scintillation counter.<br>
Test compounds were tested initially at a single dose and active compounds were retested to allow IC50 values to be determined.<br>
In vitro-cell-based assays (i)        PBMC<br>
The ability of compounds of this invention to inhibit TNFa production was assessed by using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells which synthesise and secrete TNFa when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide.<br>
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from heparinised<br>
(lOunits/ml heparin) human blood by density centrifugation (Lymphoprep™ ; Nycomed).<br>
Mononuclear cells were resuspended in culture medium [RPMI1640 medium (Gibco)	tf<br>
supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50u.g/ml streptomycin, 2mM glutamine and 1% heat-inactivated human AB serum (Sigma H-1513)]. Compounds were solubilised in DMSO at a concentration of 50mM, diluted 1:100 in culture medium and subsequently serial dilutions were made in culture medium containing 1% DMSO. PBMCs (2.4xl05 cells in 160(^1 culture medium) were incubated with 20uJ of varying concentrations of test compound (triplicate cultures) or 20ul culture medium containing 1% DMSO (control wells) for 30 minutes at 37°C in a humidified (5%CO2/95% air) incubator (Falcon 3072 ; 96 well flat-bottom tissue culture plates). 20ul lipopolysaccharide [LPS E.Coli 0111 :B4 (Sigma L-4130), final concentration 10(j.g/ml] solubilised in culture medium was added to appropriate wells. 20(4.1 culture medium was added to "medium alone" control wells. Six "LPS alone" and<br>
four "medium alone" controls were included on each 96 well plate. Varying concentrations of a known TNFa inhibitor were included in each test, i.e. an inhibitor of the PDE Type IV enzyme (for example see Semmler, J. Wachtel. H and Endres, S., Int. J. Immunopharmac. (1993), H(3), 409-413) or an inhibitor of proTNFa convertase (for example, see McGeehan, G. M, et al. Nature (1994) 370, 558-561). Plates were incubated for 7 hpurs at 37°C (humidified incubator) after which lOOul of the supernatant was removed from each well and stored at -70°C (96 well round-bottom plates; Coming 25850). TNFa levels were determined in each sample using a human TNFa ELISA (see W092/10190 and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, vol 2 by Frederick M. Ausbel et al., John Wiley and Sons Inc.).<br>
% inhibition = (LPS alone - medium alone) - (test concentration - medium alone) x JQQ<br>
(LPS alone - medium alone)<br>
(ii)        Human Whole Blood<br>
The ability of the compounds of this invention to inhibit TNFa production was also assessed in a human whole blood assay. Human whole blood secretes TNFa when stimulated with LPS. This property of blood forms the basis of an assay which is used as a secondary test for compounds which profile as active in the PBMC test.<br>
Heparinised (10 units/nil) human blood was obtained from volunteers. 160ul whole blood were added to 96 well round-bottom plates (Corning 25850). Compounds were solubilised and serially diluted in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50jj.g/ml streptomycin and 2mM glutamine, as detailed above. 20ul of each tesf concentration was added to appropriate wells (triplicate cultures). 20ul of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with antibiotics and glutamine was added to control wells. Plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C (humidified incubator), prior to addition of 20ul LPS (final concentration 10u.g/ml). RPMI 1640 medium was added to control wells. Six "LPS alone" and four "medium alone" controls were included on each plate. A known TNFa synthesis/secretion inhibitor was included in each test. Plates were incubated for 6 hours at 37°C (humidified incubator). Plates were centrifuged (2000rpm for 10 minutes) and 100(j.i plasma removed and stored at -70°C (Corning 25850 plates). TNFa levels were measured by ELISA (see WO92/10190 and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, vol 2 by Frederick M. Ausbel et al., John Wiley and Sons Inc.). The paired antibodies that were used in the ELIZA<br>
were obtained from R&amp;D Systems (catalogue nos. MAB610 anti-human TNFa coating antibody, BAF210 biotinylated anti-human TNFa detect antibody).<br>
Ex vivo / In vivo assessment<br>
The ability of the compounds of this invention as ex vivo TNFa inhibitors were assessed in the rat or mouse. Briefly, groups of male Wistar Alderley Park (AP) rats (180-21 Og) were dosed with compound (6 rats) or drug vehicle (10 rats) by the appropriate route, for example peroral (P.O.), intraperitoneal (i.p.) or subcutaneous (s.c.). Ninety minutes later rats were sacrificed using a rising concentration of CC&gt;2 and bled out via the posterior vena<br>
cavae into 5 Units of sodium heparin/ml blood. Blood samples were immediately placed on ice and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C and the harvested plasmas frozen at -20°C for subsequent assay of their effect on TNFa production by LPS-stimulated human blood. The rat plasma samples were thawed and 175p.l of each sample was added to a set format pattern in a 96 well round bottom plate (Corning 25850). 50ul of heparinized human blood was then added to each well, mixed and the plate was incubated for 30 min at 37°C (humidified incubator). LPS (25u,l; final concentrationlO|J.g/ml) was added to the wells and incubation continued for a further 5.5 hours. Control wells were incubated with 25ul of medium alone. Plates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm and 200ul of the supernatants were transferred to a 96 well plate and frozen at -20°C for subsequent analysis of TNF concentration by ELISA.<br>
Data analysis by dedicated software calculates for each compound/dose:<br>
% inhibition of TNFa = Mean TNFa (Controls) - Mean TNFa (Treated)   x JQQ<br>
Mean TNFa (Controls) Alternatively, mice could be used instead of rats in the above procedure.<br>
Test as anti-arthritic agent<br>
Activity of a compound as an anti-arthritic agent was tested as follows. Acid soluble native type 11 collagen was shown by Trentham et al [1] to be arthritogenic in rats; it caused polyarthritis when administered in Freunds incomplete adjuvant. This is now known as collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and similar conditions can be induced in mice and primates.<br>
Recent studies have shown that anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies [2] and TNF receptor-IgG fusion proteins [3] ameliorate established CIA indicating that TNF plays a key role in the pathophysiology of CIA. Moreover, the remarkable efficacy reported for anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies in recent rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials indicates that TNF plays a major role in this chronic inflammatory disease. Thus CIA in DBA/1 mice as described in references 2 and 3 is a tertiary model which can be used to demonstrate the anti-arthritic activity of a compound. Also see reference 4.<br>

Although the pharmacological properties of the compounds of the Formula la vary with structural change as expected, in general a compound of the Formula la gives over 30% inhibition of p38a and/or p38p at concentrations up to 10uM. No physiologically unacceptable toxicity was observed at the effective dose for compounds tested of the present invention.<br>

According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises an amide derivative of the Formula la or Ib, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable or in-vivo-cleavable ester thereof, as defined hereinbefore or an<br>
amide derivative selected from 3-(5-benzamido-2-methylphenyl)-2-methyl-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-4-one, 3-[5-(4-methylbenzamido)-2-methylphenyl]-2-methyl-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-4-one and 3-[5-(4-methoxybenzamido)-2-methylphenyl]-2-methyl-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-4-one in association with a pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be in a form suitable for oral use (for example as tablets, lozenges, hard or soft capsules, aqueous or oily suspensions, emulsions, dispersible powders or granules, syrups or elixirs), for topical use (for example as creams, ointments, gels, or aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions), for administration by inhalation (for example as a finely divided powder or a liquid aerosol), for administration by insufflation (for example as a finely divided powder) or for parenteral administration (for example as a sterile aqueous or oily solution for intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intramuscular dosing or as a suppository for rectal dosing).<br>
The compositions of the invention may be obtained by conventional procedures using conventional pharmaceutical excipients, well known in the art. Thus, compositions intended lor oral use may contain, for example, one or more colouring, sweetening, flavouring and/or preservative agents.<br>
The amount of active ingredient that is combined with one or more excipients to produce a single dosage form will necessarily vary depending upon the host treated and the particular route of administration. For example, a formulation intended for oral administration to humans will generally contain, for example, from 0.5 mg to<br>
0.5 g of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of excipients<br><br>
which may vary from about 5 to about 98 percent by weight of the total composition.<br>
The size of the dose for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes of a compound of the Formula la will naturally vary according to the nature and severity of the conditions, the age and sex of the animal or patient and the route of administration, according to well known principles of medicine.<br>
In using a compound of the Formula la for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes it will generally be administered so that a daily dose in the range, for example, 0.5 mg to 75 mg per kg body weight is received, given if required in divided doses. In general lower doses will be administered when a parenteral route is employed. Thus, for example, for intravenous administration, a dose in the range, for example, 0.5 mg to 30 mg per kg body<br>
weight will generally be used. Similarly, for administration by inhalation, a dose in the range, tor example, 0.5 mg to 25 mg per kg body weight will be used. Oral administration is however preferred, particularly in tablet form. Typically, unit dosage forms will contain about 1 mg to 500 mg of a compound of this invention.<br>

2-methyl-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-4-one in the manufacture of a medicament for use in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, irritable bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, AIDS, septic shock, ischaernic heart disease or psoriasis.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides a method of treating rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, irritable bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, AIDS, septic shock, ischaernic heart disease or psoriasis which comprises administering to a warm-blooded animal an effective amount of an amide derivative of the Formula la, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt or in-vivo-cleavable ester thereof, as defined hereinbefore or of an amide derivative selected from 3-(5-benzamido-2-methylphenyl)-2-methyl-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-4-one,<br>
3-[5-(4-methylbenzaniido)-2-metliylphenyl]-2-methyl-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-4-oneand 3-[5-(4-methoxybenzamido)-2-metliylphenyl]-2-methyl-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-4-one.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be used in combination with other drugs and therapies used in the treatment of disease states which would benefit from the inhibition of cytokines, in particular TNF and IL-1. For example, the compounds of the Formula la could be used in combination with drugs and therapies used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, irritable bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, AIDS, septic shock, ischaemic heart disease, psoriasis and the other disease states mentioned earlier in this specification.<br>
For example, by virtue of their ability to inhibit cytokines, the compounds of the Formula la are of value in the treatment of certain inflammatory and non-inflammatory diseases which are currently treated with a cyclooxygenase-inhibitory non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as indomethacin, ketorolac, acetylsalicyclic acid, ibuprofen, sulindac, tolmetin and piroxicam. Co-administration of a compound of the Formula I with a NSAID can result in a reduction of the quantity of the latter agent needed to produce a therapeutic effect. Thereby the likelihood of adverse side-effects from the NSAID such as gastrointestinal effects are reduced. Thus according to a further feature of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises an amide derivative of the Formula la, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt or in-vivo-cleavable ester thereof, in conjunction or admixture with a cyclooxygenase inhibitory non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, and a pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be used with anti-inflammatory agents such<br>
t<br>
as an inhibitor of the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase.<br>
The compounds of the Formula la may also be used in the treatment of conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis in combination with antiarthritic agents such as gold, methotrexate, steroids and penicillinamine, and in conditions such as osteoarthritis in combination with steroids.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered in degradative diseases, for example osteoarthritis, with chondroprotective, anti-degradative and/or reparative agents such as Diacerhein, hyaluronic acid formulations such as Hyalan, Rumalon, Arteparon and glucosamine salts such as Antril.<br>
The compounds of the Formula la may be be used in the treatment of asthma in combination with antiasthmatic agents such as bronchodilators and leukotriene antagonists.<br>
If formulated as a fixed dose such combination products employ the compounds of this invention within the dosage range described herein and the other pharmaceutically-active agent within its approved dosage range. Sequential use is contemplated when a combination formulation is inappropriate.<br>
Although the compounds of the Formula la are primarily of value as therapeutic agents for use in warm-blooded animals (including man), they are also useful whenever it is required to inhibit the effects of cytokines. Thus, they are useful as pharmacological standards for use in the development of new biological tests and in the search for new pharmacological agents.<br>

Example 1 3-(5-benzamido-2-chlorophenyI)-7-methoxy-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-4-one<br>
Triethyl orthoformate (0.189 ml) was added to a stirred mixture of N-(5-benzamido-2.-chlorophenyl)-2-arnino-4-methoxybenzamide (0.15 g), ethanol (10 ml) and glacial acetic acid (0.022 ml) and the resultant mixture was heated to 70°C for 16 hours. The mixture was evaporated. The residue was partitioned between methylene chloride and a saturated aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate. The organic phase was dried (MgSO4) and evaporated and the residue was triturated under a mixture of ethyl acetate and diethyl ether. The material so obtained was further purified by column chromatography on an ion exchange column (isolute SCX column from International Sorbent Technology Limited, Hengoed, Mid-Glamorgan, UK) using initially methanol and then a 99:1 mixture of methanol and a saturated aqueous ammonium hydroxide solution as eluent. There was thus obtained the title compound (0.054 g); NMR Spectrum: (DMSOd6) 3.92 (s, 3H), 7.12-7.22 (m, 2H), 7.48-7.6 (m, 3H), 7.68 (d, 1H), 7.88-8.0 (m, 3H), 8.04-8.12 (m, 2H), 8.28 (m, 1H), 10.06 (s, 1H); Mass Spectrum: M+H' 406 and 408.<br>
The N-(5-benzamido-2-chlorophenyl)-2-amino-4-methoxybenzamide used as a starting material was prepared as follows :-<br>
Benzoyl chloride (5.2 ml) was added to a stirred mixture of<br>
2,4-diaminochlorobenzene (6.42 g), triethylamine (12.5 ml) and methylene chloride (100 ml) which had been cooled to 0°C.
