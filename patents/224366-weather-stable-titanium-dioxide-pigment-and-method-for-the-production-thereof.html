WEATHER-STABLE TITANIUM DIOXIDE  PIGMENT AND METHOD  FOR THE PRODUCTION THEREOF<br>

3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
The invention relates to a weather-stable titanium dioxide pigment and a process for its production.<br>
Because of its high light refraction index, titanium dioxide is used as a high-grade pigment in<br>
many areas, such as plastics, coatings, paper and fibers. Because of its high scattering power, titanium dioxide imparts advantageous optical properties such as brightness, hiding power and tinting strength to such systems. However, titanium dioxide is photoactive, which means that, through the effect of ultraviolet radiation, free radicals form on the surface via electron-hole pairs, which free radicals can react with the substances in the surrounding matrix and destroy it. Weather-stable titanium dioxide pigments are therefore needed that either inhibit the formation of free radicals or prevent the free radicals, which do form, from reacting with the binder matrix. At the same time, the optical properties should, if at all possible, not be impaired.<br>
One method frequently used to improve the weather-stability of Ti02 pigments, i.e. to reduce the photocatalytic effect emanating from the titanium dioxide, is to coat the particles in a post-treatment process, e.g. with silicon oxide and/or zirconium oxide and/or aluminum oxide. Several patents describe the application of an amorphous coating of SiO2 with the highest possible density - a so-called "dense skin" - to prevent the formation of free radicals on the particle surface.<br>
US 2,885,366 describes a method for covering a fine-grained substrate with a dense amorphous SiCO2 skin. It is important here that the fine-particle substrate does not consist of SiCO2, but that the surface has sufficient reactivity to accumulate a dense silica skin. It is not absolutely necessary that the entire particle consists of this reactive material, it is enough if only the surface is made of it. A variety of substrates have the necessary reactivity, for example metal oxides or metal silicates that are insoluble at a pH of 7 toll. The application of the dense amorphous Si02 layer to a<br><br>
substrate of this kind is performed by adding active silica, i.e. SiO2 with a low condensation level, at a pH of 8 toll and a temperature of 60 to 125 °C at a rate not in excess of value that can be calculated from a formula. This guarantees that the specific surface area of the particle, which is used as an indirect indicator of the continuity or quality of the skin, does not increase. Of fundamental importance in the process described in US 2,885,366 are thus the slow rate of addition and the condition that the active silica is added in a pH range at which the amorphous silica layer precipitates immediately onto the substrate.<br>
In addition to high weather-stability, it is important for TiO2 pigments, especially when they are used in coating materials, that high opacity and high gloss are attained. However, according to US Re. 27,818, pigments manufactured as described in US 2,885,366 have certain deficits in this respect. US Re. 27,818 states that an improvement can be brought about by applying a further layer of hydrous aluminum oxide after application of the dense amorphous SiO2 skin. The procedure for doing this is to first apply the dense amorphous SiO2 skin at a pH of 8 toll and then to add a water-soluble aluminum compound, keeping the pH below 7, and finally to adjust the suspension to a pH of 7 to 8.<br>
According to US 4,125,412, the big disadvantage of the above-mentioned process (US Re. 27,818) is the long dosage time for lowering the pH after adding the silica. This very time- intensive process is a particular problem if the manufacturer wants to carry out the post- treatment as a continuous process. For this reason, an accelerated, and thus more economical post-treatment process for applying a dense Si02 and AL2O3 skin has been developed. Here, the sodium silicate is added quickly to a Ti02 suspension at a temperature of 80-100 °C, and the pH of the Ti02 suspension can be made acidic or set to pH 9 to 10.5 before the addition, if desired. In both cases, a maturation process takes place at pH 9 to 10.5, after which an additional layer of an aluminum compound is applied.<br><br>
The processes described above have the disadvantage that the precipitation of the SiO2 dense skin must be carried out at very high temperatures to produce a skin that is as near to perfection as possible. EP 0 245 984 Bl (US 4,781,761) describes a post-treatment process, which, through the simultaneous addition of Na2Si03 and a B2O3-containing solution to a TiO2 suspension that has previously been set to a pH of 7 to 10.5, allows the post-treatment process to be carried out at a slightly lower temperature of 65 to 90 °C, which is advantageous from a process engineering standpoint. The pH, which rises to 10.5 to 11.5 through the addition of the solutions, is subsequently lowered to around 8 through the addition of acid, e.g. HCI.<br>
The aforementioned patents describe basic processes for producing a SiO2 dense skin, various methods for shortening the post-treatment times, and processes for optimizing the dispersion behavior of TiO2 pigments. Common to all these processes is that the post-treatment aims to produce a completely continuous SiO2 skin that is as dense as possible to guarantee low photoactivity. They do not, however, describe any processes for further increasing the pigment stability or reducing photocatalytic activity.<br>
One approach in this direction is described in US 2003/0089278 Al. There, a process is also described for producing a SiO2  dense skin pigment with an outer coating containing aluminum. Apart from improving the dispersion behavior, stability is also increased by adding citric acid before performing the dense SiO2  skin surface treatment. The increase in stability is attributed to the combination of the SiO2  dense skin with the aluminum-based post-treatment layer stabilized with citric acid.<br>
Si02 dense skin treatments are mentioned not only in connection with Ti02 pigments for improving their stability, but also, for example, in the coating of glass fibers to increase their resistance to abrasion and lower the slippage of the fibers in the manufactured products. In this context, US 2,913,419 describes the precipitation of other polyvalent metal ions together with the silica on the particle surface. The main feature of this process is that the active silica and the metal salt solution are added to<br><br>
the suspension simultaneously but in separate streams, with the pH kept constant in the range 8 to 11 through the parallel addition of acids or alkalis, and that the mixing must be as thorough as possible during the parallel addition of the chemicals. The optimal method is considered to be adding the two solutions in a centrifugal pump carrying the TiO2 suspension to be post-treated, for example. Furthermore, the specific surface area of the particles must not rise during the course of the treatment.<br>
The process is used on a number of very fine-grained substrate materials with particle sizes of up to 100 nm, such as silica sol, metal or oxide powder, clay minerals, fibers etc. The treatment serves primarily to provide the substrate material with mechanical protection.<br>
The object of the present invention is to create a weather-stable titanium dioxide pigment and to introduce a process by which the weather stability - in particular the chalking resistance and gloss retention - of <br>
SiO2 dense skin titanium dioxide pigments can be further improved while retaining good optical properties.<br>
The object is achieved by means of a titanium dioxide pigment, in which the particles have a SiO2 dense skin doped with metal atoms, whereby the SiO2 dense skin is composed of multiple layers and whereby the innermost layer contains no significant quantity of metal atoms.<br>
The object is further achieved by means of a process for manufacturing a titanium dioxide pigment in which the particles are coated with a dense silica skin doped with metal atoms, whereby the coating components are added to the suspension one after the other.<br>
Other advantageous embodiments of the invention are described in the subclaims.<br>
The subject matter of the invention is thus a coated titanium dioxide pigment, which has improved stability and is thus able to enhance the weather-stability and/or<br><br>
tightfastness of e.g. surface coatings or plastics while retaining good optical properties; application is not restricted to such systems, however.<br>
The subject matter of the invention is furthermore a process for the manufacture of such a weather-stable titanium dioxide pigment in which a SiO2  dense skin doped with metal atoms is applied by means of post-treatment in the aqueous phase, and also the use of this pigment in particular in surface coatings and plastics.<br>
Hereinafter, the term "metal atoms" should also be understood to mean metal ions that are bound chemically or physically in the structure of the SiO2  dense skin without the exact type of bonding being shown.<br>
The weather-stability of a system pigmented with TiO2 is generally described with the aid of various characteristic data. For example, the onset of chalking and the gloss retention (period until the gloss falls below the 50 % residual gloss value) of pigmented coating systems are determined either after outdoor weathering at defined locations or after an accelerated weathering test (WOM).<br>
Because these test procedures - particularly outdoor weathering - take a long time, use is frequently made of the continuity of the SiO2  skin on the pigment particle surface to characterize weather-stability. It is assumed that weather-stabilityis related to the continuity of the SiO2 skin covering the pigment particles. This relationship and processes for determining the quality (continuity) of the SiO2 skin are described in the literature. The quality (continuity) of the SiO2  skin can be determined indirectly by means of the H2SO4 solubility test (Dwight A. Holtzen et. al: " TiO2 Photochemistry and Color Applications", DuPont White Pigment and Mineral Products, ANTEC 2001, p. 2374). The H2SO4 solubility test exploits the differing solubility of TO2 and SiO2  in hot, concentrated sulfuric acid: The more continuous and more perfect the skin, the lower the H2SO4 solubility of the pigment particle.<br><br>
A further characteristic for describing the quality of the skin is the change in the specific surface area (e.g. according to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller process: BET) following post- treatment in comparison with the specific surface of the substrate.<br>
According to the above-mentioned publication by Dwight A. Holtzen et a)., the behavior of the coating systems on outdoor weathering, shown by the gloss retention or chalking resistance, generally correlates with the results from the H2SO4 solubility testing. In this publication, a qualitative differentiation between the TO2 pigments is made in three categories according to their weather resistance.<br>
Comparing the possible tests, preference should certainly be given to the accelerated<br>
weathering test (WOM) over the H2SO4 solubility test. With this kind of test,<br>
according to Michael P. Diebold ("Analysis and Testing - Unconventional Effects<br>
ofSiO2 	on	Paint	Durability",	published	at<br>
www.coatinQs.de/articles/ecspapers/diebold/diebold.htm). Preference should, in turn, be given to the test results for chalking stability over the residual gloss values for describing the weather-stability of TiO2 pigments.<br>
Surprisingly, it was found that pigments can be produced with much improved weather resistance even if the continuity of the SiCh dense skin is not particularly high and, furthermore, even if the H2SO4 solubility decreases with increasing accelerated weathering resistance.<br>
With the process according to the invention, this improvement in weather-stability compared with the prior art is achieved by the incorporation of metal atoms into the SiO2 dense skin and by the special way of performing the post-treatment process. In particular, the metals Ti, Sn and Zr produce an improvement in weather-stability if incorporated in the SiO2 dense skin.<br>
Aluminium is not used as a metal atom to be incorporated in the SiO2 dense skin.<br><br>
The coating according to the invention is produced by adding the components to the Ti02 suspension one after the other at a sliding pH. The Ti02 suspension is initially set at a pH of at least 9, preferably at least 10 and in particular at least 11. The pH is adjusted with an alkaline compound such as NaOH, Subsequently, the SiCh component is added, preferably as an alkali silicate solution, e.g. potassium or sodium silicate. This is followed by the addition of the metal component in the form of a metal salt solution, which may be alkaline or acidic. Normally, acidic components are used, e.g. titanyl chloride, zirconium sulfate, zirconium oxychloride, tin (II) chloride etc. A person skilled in the art will be aware of additional suitable compounds. It is also possible to add mixtures of metal salt solutions or different metal salt solutions one after the other. To ensure perfect formation of the SiO2  dense skin doped with metal atoms, it is necessary to lower the pH to a value below 9 and preferably below 8. This is achieved either by addition of adequate acidic metai salt solution or by addition of additional metal salt free acids such as HCI or H2SO4. The precipitation of the SiO2  dense skin including the metal components takes place at a pH&gt;6.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the metal solution can first be added to the Ti02 suspension, but the pH should not fall below 9 preferably not below 10 and in particular not below 11. After that, the silicate solution is added and the pH subsequently lowered to below 9 andpreferably below 8.<br>
The process according to the invention is characterized by the fact that a gradient is produced in the distribution of the metrf atoms within the SiO2  dense skin. If the silicate solution is added first, an initial layer of Si02 forms on the surface of the TiO2 particles. This layer does not contain any significant quantity of the metal component. "No significant quantity" is understood to mean a quantity which does not modify the properties of the product and which has not been added on purpose. During the subsequent addition of the metal salt solution, further silica is precipitated together with the metal component on top of the first SiO2  layer to form a mixed layer of SiO2  and metal. Lowering the pH to below 9 after addition of the<br><br>
metal salt solution by means of a metal salt free acid results in the remainder of the silica becoming deposited on the particle surface.<br>
The optical properties of the pigment, such as tinting strength, dispersing behavior etc., can be improved by means of the application of an additional hydrous aluminum oxide skin. The precipitation of an hydrous aluminum oxide skin of this kind can be carried out at a fixed Ph in the range of 3.5 to 10.0 or with changing pH. Sodium aluminate, for example, is a good starting substance, and HO is particularly suitable for adjusting the pH during precipitation of the hydrous aluminum oxide skin.<br>
The dense skin on the particle surface of the pigments according to the invention contain 2.0 to 6.0 % by weight, preferably 2.5 to 4.0 % by weight Si02, and 0.1 to 3.0 % by weight, preferably 0.1 tol.O % by weight metal, calculated as oxide and calculated on the total pigment.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the particles are additionally coated with a layer of 0,5 to 6.0 % by weight, preferably 1.0 to 4.0 % by weight hydrous aluminum oxide, calculated as AI2O3.<br><br>
Examples<br>
The invention is described in greater detail with reference to the following examples, but without restricting the scope of the invention as a result.<br>
The process according to the invention starts with a TiO2 base material produced by the chloride or sulfate process. A mixture of the base material types can also be used. TiO2 base material is understood to mean TiO2 particles which have not yet been post-treated. The photostabitity of the basic base material, which is determined by the crystal modification - rutile or anatase - of the base material and may be further enhanced by doping with substances like Al, Cr etc., defines the initial level of weather-stability of the pigment, which the process according to the invention aims to improve.<br>
The base material may initially be ground, e.g. in a wet grinding process. A dispersing agent, which can be a polyphosphate, polyacrylate or any other dispersing agent known to a person skilled in the art, is preferably added during wet grinding. The pH of the starting suspension is adjusted with acid (e.g. HC!) or alkali (e.g. NaOH) to a pH of at least 10 respectively 11.<br>

25 Test methods<br>
Photostability (chalking/glos retention):<br>
The photostability of the example pigments produced is tested in an alkyd resin<br>
coating system exposed to accelerated weathering. The weathering is performed in a<br>
Weather- Ometer (WOM), a Weathering device comprising a ventilated test chamber<br>
with<br>
a.)      radiation source (carbon electrodes that generate an electric arc in operation)<br>
b.)      radiation fiiter of specialglass<br>
c.)      device for spraying the specimens with water<br>
d.)      atomizer for generating humidity<br><br>
e.)      rotating sample holder<br>
During the test cycle, outdoor weathering is simulated in accelerated time. The coating weathers during the test period, and the chalking resistance and gloss retention are measured. Ideally, only specimens from the same test cycle are compared with another.<br>
Qhalking is measured in accordance with DIN 53159, This involves pressing a piece of black wet photo paper onto the surface of the chalked paint. The day on which the pigment and filler particles leave behind a complete white impression is taken as the onset of chalking (chalking resistance). Gloss retention is determined by the daily measurement of the gloss with a haze gloss refiectometer. The time is given in days after which the gloss has dropped to 50 % of its initial value. With samples from the same test cycle, the absolute values (in days) of the chalking resistance and gloss retention can be directly compared.<br>
H2SO4 solubility:<br>
A suspension of 500 mg pigment in 25 mL concentrated sulfuric acid (96 %) is held at 75 °C for 60 minutes. After filtration, the dissolved Ti02 in the filtrate is measured by 1CP atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The lower the concentration of the dissolved TiCfe, the denser the SiCh skin on the pigment surface. Specific surface according to BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller):<br>
The BET surface area is measured according to the static volumetric principle using a Micromeritics Tristar 3000.<br>
Test results<br>
The test results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Examples 1 to 4 were subjected jointly to one weathering cycle, as were Examples 5 to 8. Compared with the<br><br>
pigments having an undoped SiO2 dense skin (Examples 1 and 5), the pigments with a doped SiC2 dense skin (Examples 2 to 4 and 6 to 8) have significantly better weather-stability (chalking resistance and gloss retention). The best results are achieved with tin. It can also be seen that, surprisingly, the weather-stability of the pigments does not correlate with the continuity of the skin - indicated as the H2SO4 solubility. Furthermore, it is shown that the specific surface area according to BET compared with that of the untreated base material (BET 6.5 m2/g) increases both with a pure SiOz coating and with the treatment according to the invention, but without any correlation with the weather-stability.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	Titanium dioxide pigment, the particles of which have a SiO2 dense skin doped with metal atoms, wherein the SiO2 dense skin is composed of multiple layers and wherein the innermost layer does not contain any significant quantity of metal atoms.<br>
