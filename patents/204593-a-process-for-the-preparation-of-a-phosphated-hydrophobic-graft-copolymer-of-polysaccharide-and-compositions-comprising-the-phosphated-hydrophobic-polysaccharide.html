(See Section 10)<br>
A PROCESS FOR THE PREPRATION OF A PAOSHATED HYDROPHOBIC<br>
GRAPT POLYMAR OF POLYSACCHARIDE AND COMPOSITION COMPRISING<br>
THE PHOSPHATED ,HYDROBIC POLYSACCHARIDE<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following  specification   particularly  describes  the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a phosphated,  hydrophobic graft polymer of polysaccharide and compositions comprising the phosphated, hydrophobic polysaccharide. The polysaccharide of the invention provides improved detergency benefits, enhanced release of specific coils and specific benefits to the fabric when used in detergent formulations or rinse compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
When laundry fabrics are washed with a detergent, to give complete cleaning, the detergent must first remove the soil particles from the fabric and suspend them in the soil solution and then prevent soil particles and other insoluble particles from re-depositing on the fabric during the washing and rinsing of the fabric. Since conventional detergent formulations give incomplete soil removal, additives need to be added to improve soil removal and ease the release of soil and/or to prevent re-deposition of the soil.<br>
Polymers can be added to detergent formulations to enhance soil removal from the fabric as well as prevent re-deposition of soil. Soil release polymers (SRPs) adsorb onto a fabric surface assisting soil removal while anti-redeposition polymers (ARDs) stablise the soil in the was solution thus preventing redeposition of the soil.<br>
Most soil release polymers disclosed in the prior art are synthetic polymers. Examples of these polymers are hydrophilic polyesters and cross-linked acrylic polymers.<br><br>
Anti-redeposition polymers  known  in  the  artare	sodium<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose and methyl cellulose amongst others. Soil release polymers disclosed in the literature address the problem of removal of oily or fatty soils from polyester and cotton, in particular polyester while anti-redeposition polymers conventionally address the problem of redeposition of particulate soils.<br>
Polysaccharides are biodegradable, natural polymers with extensive hydroxyl groups. Polysaccharides can be readily modified to give polymers with desired characteristics and such modified polysaccharides have been used extensively in the chemical industry. Modified polysaccharides have been used in detergent formulations as anti-redeposition agents, builders and to encapsulate detergent actives, amongst other functions. However, their use in detergents is limited to conventional molecules well known in the art.<br>
In addition to improved detergency, it is also desirable to impart properties like stiffness and anti-wrinkling benefits to the fabric. Smoothness of the fabric after washing is another desired attribute. While natural polymers like starch can be used for stiffening and some rinse conditioners are known to impart smoothness and anti-wrinkling benefits, it has so far not been possible to impart all these benefits along with soil release, anti-redeposition and detergency improvement.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
JP56112901_ discloses  a  wet  process  to  make  a  starch phosphate by reacting a phosphoric acid and an epihalohydrin<br><br>
with starch in the presence of an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide. The starch phosphate can be used as a detergent builder.<br>
GB2322137  (Unilever) discloses the hydrophobic modification! of starch (starch is the hydrophilic segment) and its use as a soil release polymer, in particular for detergency of oily soil from polyester fabric.   Hydrophobic modification was carried out by graft copolymerising starch with hydrophobic monomers.<br>
Our co-pending British patent application No. GB0018287.3, !<br>
j_T_<br>
filed on 25  July 2000, describes polysaccharides that are<br>
modified by a) hydrophobic modification and b) carboxylation and/or sulphonation, as soil release polymers for detergent formulations.<br>
Thus, there is a need in the detergent industry for polymer additives that can improve detergency ag well as impart other desirable properties. The applicants have now found that certain phosphated, hydrophobically modified polysaccharides give benefits when incorporated into laundry treatment compositions.  The polymers can be used as rinse<br>
conditioners, improving consequent soil removal, imparting a stiff feel to the fabric and giving anti-wrinkling and improved ironability benefits. The modified polysaccharides can also be incorporated into detergent formulations and give superior detergency for cotton, polyester and their blends and impart smoothness to the fabric.<br><br>
DEFINITION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, a phosphated, hydrophobic graft copolymer of polysaccharide having the general Formula I is provided:<br>
R'<br>
I<br>
■(G)	(G)	(G)	(G)	     (I)<br>
R<br>
wherein R is a hydrophobic vinyl polymer, R' represents a phosphate group or its salt and G is a monosaccharide or substituted monosaccharide.<br>
According to a second aspect of .the invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of a phosphated, hydrophobic graft copolymer of polysaccharide as defined in the previous paragraph, which process comprises (a) reacting a polysaccharide with an ethylenically unsaturated monomer to form a copolymer having a polysaccharide backbone carrying grafted hydrophobic vinyl polymeric groups derived from the ethylenically unsaturated monomer, (b) before or after step (a) , reacting the polysaccharide or copolymer with a phosphating agent.<br>
According to a third aspect of the invention, there are provided fabric treatment and detergent compositions as defined below.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated.<br>
The phosphated, hydrophobic graft copolymer of polysaccharide of the current invention has the general structure given in Formula I.<br>
The Phosphate Group<br>
The phosphate group is attached to the polysaccharide backbone through the hydroxyl group, either primary or secondary. It is not essential t;hat the phosphate group be present on each of the sugar rings.<br>
In a first embodiment the phosphate group, R', has the general formula II:<br><br>
wherein each of X1 and X2, which may be the same or different,<br>
is selected from ONa, OH, CI or OG where G is another polysaccharide backbone thereby providing a cross-linked polymer.<br>
In an alternative second embodiment the phosphate group, R', has the general formula III:<br><br><br>
wherein each of Y1, Y2, Y3 and Y4, which may be the same or<br>
different, is selected from CI or OG where G is another polysaccharide backbone thereby providing a cross-linked polymer.<br>
The groups R' are derived from reaction with a phosphating agent. Preferred examples of phosphating agents are phosphoric acid, sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), tetrasodium pyrophosphate, phosphorous pentachloride, phosphoryl chloride, sodium trimetaphosphate, polymeric sodi-um orthophosphates or their mixtures thereof. Preferably STPP is used as a phosphating agent.<br>
The ratio by weight of the polysaccharide to the phosphate substituent is from 1:1 to 1:0.001, more preferably from 1:0.5-1:0.01 and most preferably from 1:0.3 to 1:0.1.<br>
The Polysaccharide<br>
In Formula I, G, the repeating unit of the polysaccharide, is a monosaccharide or substituted monosaccharide. It is preferable that G is a monosaccharide.<br>
The polysaccharide is preferably chosen from starch, modified starches, cellulose, guar gum, and tamarind gum but is not limited by the same. More preferably the polysaccharide is starch. The starch can be any native starch and includes those derived from wheat, rice, oat, tapioca, maize, potato, sorghum, arrowroot or their mixtures thereof. Alternatively, acid or enzymatically degraded starch or oxidised starch or<br><br>
their mixtures or their mixtures thereof with the native starches can also be used.<br>
When starch is the preferred polysaccharide, it may be in the native form or gelatinised form. The term gelatinisation refers to rupture of the starch granule at elevated temperatures in presence of water.<br>
It is not essential to remove any unreacted polysaccharide that may be present in the final product obtained by graft copolymerisation and esterification of the polysaccharide.<br>
The Hydrophobic Vinyl Polymer<br>
The hydrophobic modification is provided by a hydrophobic vinyl polymer (R in Formula I) grafted onto the polysaccharide backbone. The hydrophobic vinyl polymer can be attached to the polysaccharide backbone through the hydroxyl group or through any of the carbon atoms on the monosaccharide or substituted monosaccharide. The polymer chains can be present at irregular intervals on the polysaccharide chain and it is not critical that they be present at regular intervals. If the homopolymer is formed, it may be present without impairing detergency.<br>
The polymers of vinyl monomers like hydrophobic acrylic monomers, vinyl acetate, styrene and substituted styrenes are especially preferred. The molecular weight of each of the hydrophobic vinyl polymer chairite is preferably 500-5,000,000, more preferably from 2000-500,000 and most preferably from 5000-100,000.<br><br>
The amount of the hydrophobic vinyl polymer is from 0.01 to 10% by weight of the polysaccharide, more preferably from 1 to 5% by weight of the polysaccharide.<br>
Preferably, hydrophobic acrylic monomers are used for graft copolymerisation. Th^^hydrophobic.) acrylic polymers suitable for the present invention are shown in Formula IV.<br><br>
wherein each of R1 and R1 ,  which may be the same or<br>
different, represents  -H,  -CH3 or -C2H5, and wherein each<br>
of  R2  and R2' /  which may be  the  same  or  different,<br>
represents  -COOCH3, -COOC2H5 or -COOC3H7.<br>
Particularly preferred is poly(methyl methacrylate) wherein<br>
R1 = R1'=-CH3 and R2 = R2' = -COOCH3.<br>
Optional Cationic Modification<br>
Optionally, the soil release polymer of the invention may be treated with a cationic reagent. Examples of suitable cationic reagents are tertiary amino compounds, quaternary ammoniiim compounds and quaternary imidazolinium compounds and include epoxy propyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, 3-chloro-2-<br><br>
hydroxy propyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, 3-chloro-2-hydroxy propyl dimethyl dodecyl ammonium chloride and 3-chloro-2-hydroxy propyl dimethyl ocatdecyl ammonium chloride amongst others<br>
Preferably, the amount of the cationic substituent should not exceed 15% by weight with respect to the polysaccharide, The polymers so prepared are especially useful for improving detergency from cotton.<br>
Polymer Mixtures<br>
Optionally, the soil release polymers of the invention may be mixed with other polymers to give a further improvement in detergency. Examples of such polymers are hydrophilic polyesters like GEROL 
Examples of Preferred Modified Polysaccharides<br>
The following formulae are representative examples of the hydrophobic, phosphated polysaccharides of the invention.<br>
In the drawings, R has the meaning given previously, and most preferably represents<br><br>
10<br><br>
where  R1  preferably  represents  -CH3  and  R2  preferably represents -COOCH3<br>
and R' has the meaning given previously and most preferably represents<br>
/NaO  ONa<br>
obtained when STPP is used as a phosphating agent.<br>
Preparation of the Phosphated, Hydrophobic Polysaccharides<br>
The modified polysaccharides of the invention are prepared by a) reacting a polysaccharide with an ethylenically unsaturated monomer to form a copolymer having a polysaccharide backbone carrying grafted hydrophobic vinyl polymeric groups derived from the ethylenically unsaturated monomer, and b) before or after step (a) , reacting the polysaccharide or copolymer with a phosphating agent.<br>
It is not particularly relevant for the present invention as; to which step is carried out first.  Preferably, the step of graft copolymerisation of the polysaccharide is carried out first, followed by phosphation.<br>
Both graft copolymerisation and phosphation of the polysaccharide can take place through the primary and/or the secondary hydroxyl groups on the polysaccharide backbone. Graft copolymerisation can also be initiated by H abstraction from the monosaccharide residue.<br><br>
Graft copolymerisation may be carried out by contacting a redox initiator, such as ferrous ammonium sulphate and hydrogen peroxide or eerie ammonium nitrate and dilute nitric acid,  with the polysaccharide in an aqueous medium.   A<br>
preferred temperature range is 2 0-60 C, more preferably from<br>
30-40 C.  It is preferable to add an entrainer, an example of<br>
which is urea. When the ferrous ammoniiim sulphate and hydrogen peroxide system is used as the redox initiator, it is preferable also to add ascorbic acid. The hydrophobic monomer is added and subsequent polymerisation takes place to yield the polymer of the invention.<br>
The amount of the hydrophobic vinyl polymer is from 0^1 to 10% by weight of the polysaccharide, more preferably from 1 to 5% by weight of the polysaccharide.<br>
The hydrophobic graft copolymer so prepared is preferably reacted with a phosphating reagent selected from phosphoric acid, sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), tetrasodium pyrophosphate, phosphorous pentachloride, phosphoryl chloride, sodiiim trimetaphosphate, polymeric sodium orthophosphates and mixtures thereof. It is most preferable to use STPP as a phosphating agent.<br>
The ratio by weight of the polysaccharide to the phosphate substituent is from 1:1 to 1:0.001, more preferably from 1:0.5-1:0.01 and most preferably from 1:0.3 to 1:0.1.<br>
Optionally the process may include treatment with a cationic reagent as discussed previously.<br><br>
Several methods are known in the art to make phosphated polysaccharides.  Methods as disclosed in Modified Starches, Properties and uses, ed. O.B. Wurzburg, 1986, page 98-103, while being specifically directed towards modified starches, remain suitable for the invention.<br>
In a preferred method of phosphating the polysaccharide, an acidic solution of STPP, of pH not greater than 6.5, is sprayed onto the polysaccharide or the graft copolymerised polysaccharide. The moisture content is then reduced to 25% or below and the mixture heated at a temperature of at least<br>
35 C for at least 30 minutes.<br>
When the polymer of the invention is prepared from native starch, it is preferred to prepare a slurry of the polymer in water followed by a conventional method of drying like drum drying or spray drying. The polymer so obtained is in a cold water soluble form.<br>
Fabric Treatment Compositions<br>
The polymers of the invention can be used in fabric treatment compositions such as rinse conditioners and can be conveniently supplied in the form of a powder, paste, flakes or a solution. In use, they can be applied as a solution to the fabric. When supplied as a solution, they may be suitably supplied in the form of aqueous compositions.<br>
Preferably the fabric treatment compositions contain from 0 to 60 wt% of a fabric treatment agent and the amount of the polymer, or a polymer mixture as previously described, is<br><br>
from 0.001 to 10%, more preferably from 0.25 to 5%. Optionally, other rinse conditioners, fabric softeners, perfumes and required stabilisers may also be added to the fabric treatment composition. In addition, optical brightening agents, colourants, opacifiers, hydrotropes, viscosity control agents and other anti-static agents and ironing aids may be present without affecting the performance of the polymer of the invention.<br>
Once the rinse conditioner is applied, subsequent washing will result in improved detergency. The polymers also impart stiffening akin to that of native polysaccharides like starch and guar gum and additionally impart anti-wrinkling benefits to the fabric.<br>
Detergent Compositions<br>
The polymer can also be incorporated into detergent compositions using conventional methods. When used in detergent formulations, the polymers give improved detergency and also impart a smooth feel to the fabric.<br>
The detergent formulations may also contain, as in conventional formulations, detergent actives (surfactants) and builders.<br>
The detergent composition may be in the form of a powder, bar, paste or liquid. Preferably the detergent composition contain from 0.001 to 10%, preferably from 0.25 to 5% of the polymer, or a polymer mixture as previously described.<br><br>
The surfactant is generally chosen from anionic, nonionic, cationic, amphoteric and zwitterionic surfactants and mixtures thereof. It is preferred that from 5 to 60 wt% of the surfactant is incorporated in the formulation, more preferably from 5 to 40 wt%. Optionally the detergent composition may also contain from 1 to 50 wt% of a detergency builder.<br>
Other ingredients include sequestrants, dye-transfer inhibitors, perfumes, bleaches, enzymes, fluorescers, optical brighteners, fungicides, germicides and hydrotropes.<br>
Detergent Ingredients<br>
Anionic surfactants which can be used in the compositions of the invention are both soap and non-soap detergents compounds. Especially suitable anionic detergent active compounds are water soluble salts of organic sulphuric reaction products having in the molecular structure an alkyl radical containing from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, and a radical chosen from sulphonic acid or sulphur acid ester radicals and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable nonionic detergent active compounds can be broadly described as compounds produced by the condensation of alkylene oxide groups, which are hydrophilic in nature, with an organic hydrophobic compound which may be aliphatic or alkyl aromatic in nature. The length of the hydrophilic or polyoxyalkylene radical which is condensed with any particular hydrophobic group can be readily adjusted to yield a water-soluble compound having the desired degree of balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic elements.<br><br>
Suitable amphoteric detergent-active compounds that optionally can be employed are derivatives of aliphatic secondary and tertiary amines containing an alkyl group of 8 to 18 carbon atoms and an aliphatic radical substituted by an anionic water-solubilizing group, for instance sodium 3-dodecylamino-propionate, sodium 3-dodecylaminopropane sulphonate and sodium N-2-hydroxydodecyl-N-methyltaurate. Suitable cationic detergent-active compounds are quaternary ammonium salts having an aliphatic radical of from 8 to 18 carbon atoms, for instance cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide.<br>
Suitable zwitterionic detergent-active compounds that optionally can be employed are derivatives of aliphatic quaternary ammonium, sulphonium and phosphonium compounds having an aliphatic radical of from 8 to 18 carbon atoms and an aliphatic radical substituted by an anionic water-solubilising group, for instance 3-(N-N-dimethyl-N-hexadecylammonium), propane-1-sulphonate betaine, 3-(dodecylmethyl sulphonium) propane-1-sulphonate betaine and 3-(cetylmethylphosphonium) ethane sulphonate betaine.<br>
Further examples of suitable detergent-active compounds are compounds commonly used as surface-active agents given in the well-known textbooks "Surface Active Agents", Volume I by Schwartz and Perry and "Surface Active Agents and Detergents", Volume II by Schwartz, Perry and Berch.<br>
The detergency builders which may be used in the formulation are preferably inorganic and suitable builders include alkali metal aluminosilicates (zeolites), alkali metal carbonate, sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) , tetrasodiiom pyrophosphate (TSPP) ,   citrates,   sodiiom  nitrilotriacetate   (NTA)   and<br><br>
combinations of these. Builders are preferably used in an amount ranging from 1 to 50% by wt. Zeolite if used as builder is present at levels not exceeding 10% by wt.<br>
The polymers of the invention are incorporated at the level of 0.001-10% by weight of the detergent composition, preferably 0.5-5% by weight of the detergent composition.<br>
It is not always essential to incorporate the polymer of the invention in the detergent formulation. The polymers of the invention can be used as part of a fabric washing kit, as part of a sachet or can be microencapsulated.<br>
The invention is illustrated further by the following non-limiting Examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of Starch Phosphate<br>
150 g of sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) was dissolved in 260 ml of 2N HCl. The pH of the resultant solution was 4. The resulting solution was sprayed on to 1 kg of starch and mixed well. The mixture was allowed to dry in air to a moisture content of 15%. The mixture was further dried in an oven to a moisture content of 10%.<br>
The phosphate content was estimated by colorimetry to be 1.53%.<br><br>
A slurry of the polymer so obtained was made and the slurry was then drum dried to obtain the cold water soluble form of the polymer.<br>
This polymer could be converted to a phosphated, hydrophobic polysaccharide in accordance with the invention.<br>

Preparation of starch-graft-poly(methyl methacrylate) (Starch-g-MMA)<br>
100 g urea was dissolved in 1 litre of distilled water in a flask equipped with a stirrer and a thermometer. 1 kg of tapioca starch, 1 g ferrous ammonium sulphate, 5 g ascorbic acid and 50 ml methyl methacrylate were added sequentially and the mixture was stirred. 10 ml hydrogen peroxide solution (30% w/v) was then added, the reaction mixture stirred and then filtered.  The reaction was conducted at<br>
30 C. The hydrophobic graft copolymer of starch-graft-poly (methyl methacrylate) obtained was repeatedly washed with water and then dried at 100 C.<br>

The resulting solution was sprayed on to 1 kg of the starch-graft-poly (methyl methacrylate) as prepared above and mixed well. The mixture was allowed to dry in air to a moisture ccsjjtent of 15%. The mixture was further dried in an oven to a moisture content of 10%. The phosphorus content was determined by colorimetry to be 1.5%.<br><br><br>
—^<br>
A slurry of the polymer so obtained was made and the slurry was then drum dried to obtain the cold water soluble form of the polymer.<br><br>
Example 4<br>
Preparation of cationic starch phosphate-graft- poly (methyl methacrylate) (Cat Starch-Phosphate-g-PMMA)<br>

The product was then heated at about 90°C for 3 hours. The measured level of nitrogen was 0.117%.<br>
A slurry of the polymer so obtained was made and the slurry was then drum dried to obtain the cold water soluble form of the polymer.<br>

Determination of Detergency Improvement<br>
For determining detergency improvement, commercially available fabrics presoiled with a mixture of oily and particulate soil were used. WFK SOD was pre-soiled polyester, WFK 20D was presoiled polyester-cotton blend and WFK lOD was pre-soiled cotton.  The soil was a mixture of<br><br>
sebum and soot. The fabrics were obtained from Global Resources Management Pvt. Ltd., Madras.<br>
Initial reflectance measurements of the fabrics were taken at 460 nm on a Milton Roy Color Scan II.<br>
The fabrics (WFK 30D and WFK 10b) were cut into test swatches of 10 X 10 cm. and washed using the detergent compositions of Example A (Control formulation) and Examples 3-8. Ten replicates were maintained for each example. Detergent solutions of concentration 5 g/1 were used for the washing.<br>
Test swatches were washed in a tergo-to-meter in the detergent solution for a period of 15 minutes. Reflectance measurements were taken at 460 nm for the washed pieces. The difference in reflectance of the soiled fabrics before and after washing was noted and represented as AR460*.<br>
Improvement in detergency was determined as follows:<br>
Improvement in detergency (AAR460*) = AR460* of the Example-AR460* of Comparative Example A.<br>
The results of the tergo-to-meter washes following the above detergency test procedure for removal of soil from WFK BOD, 20D and lOD is presented in Table 2.<br><br><br>
Table 2<br><br>
Example	Detergency Improvement (AR460*)<br><br>
	WFK SOD	WFK20D	WFK lOD<br>
B	-0.5	-	0<br>
C	1.0	-	1.74<br>
D	1.0	-	0.4<br>
5	1.8	-	2.1<br>
6	1.6	2.7	0<br>
7	1.9	4.2	0.6<br>
The data presented in Table 2 shows that the formulation containing the polymer of the invention, starch phosphate-g-PMMA  (Example  5)  shows  superior  detergency  than  a formulation containing starch phosphate (Comparative Example B) or starch -g-PMMA (Comparative Example C).<br>
Formulation containing the cationic starch phosphate -g -PMMA (Example 6) shows good benefits on polyester and polyester blends.<br>
Adding a cross-linked acrylic polymer, K-SAM GE 500F (Trade Mark), to the formulation (Example 7) gives a further improvement  in  detergency,  especially  on polyester  and polycotton.<br><br><br>
Example 8 and Comparative Examples E and F<br>
Stiffness and Anti-wrinkling Benefits of Starch Phosphate-g-PMMA<br>
The polymers of the invention were evaluated for benefits when used as rinse conditioners. Cotton and poly-cotton were used in the study. A panel of 28 members evaluated the polymer for stiffness and good ironing (anti-wrinkling benefit) in a paired comparison test.<br>
Prior to the study, the fabrics were desized by washing with a detergent.  The detergent concentration was 3 g/litre.<br>
Fabrics were then washed with the polymer of Example 3. An aqueous solution of the polymer (5g/litre) was used as the rinse conditioner (Example 8). A commercially available cold water soluble starch (5g/litre) was also evaluated in the study (Comparative Example E).<br>
Example 8 was compared with Comparative Example E and an untreated control fabric washed with water (Comparative Example F) . The fabrics were dried after the treatment and ironed.<br>
The stiffness and ironing benefit, ascertained visually, were assessed in a paired comparison test. The data are presented in Table 3 and Table 4.<br><br><br>
