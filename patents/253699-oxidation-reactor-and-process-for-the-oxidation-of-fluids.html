				<td>An oxidation reactor and process<br>
[0001] The invention relates to an oxidation reactor and an oxidation process suited to<br>
operate the said reactor, which houses a multitude of gas-tight and oxygen conductive<br>
membrane elements, the external surfaces of which are arranged on the side of a reaction<br>
chamber suitable to be filled with catalyst and which constitute, in conjunction with the<br>
membrane elements penetrable by oxygenous gas, a connection between the distribution<br>
chamber and a collecting chamber and/or discharge section of the reactor. The reactor is<br>
characterised in that one or several spacer pieces establish a defined minimum distance<br>
between the external surface of the membrane and the catalyst of the reaction chamber.<br>
[0002] Synthesis gas, i.e. gas mixtures with the main components CO and H2 (and if nec-<br>
essary for the specific production and purification step, with further components such as<br>
CO2, H2, N2 and inert ingredients) is produced in accordance with the state-of-the-art tech-<br>
nology mainly by two methods: endothermic steam reforming of hydrocarbons (such as<br>
methane) and derivated compounds according to the equation<br><br>
and by direct conversion of these compounds with the aid of oxygen in a partial oxidation<br>
(at least in a formal sense) according to the following equation:<br><br>
[0003] Oxygen required for partial oxidation may, for instance, originate from a cryogenic<br>
air fractionation plant.<br>
[0004] In the case of the state-of-the-art steam reforming used in the production of syn-<br>
thesis gas, a major disadvantage is due to the high investment costs as well as the large<br>
amount of heat released during plant operation. With regard o the partial oxidation accord-<br>
ing to equation (2), however it is necessary to consider the input of expensive oxygen as a<br>
demerit because the said oxygen is supplied by a separate ir fractionation plant. As the<br>
purity requirements do not allow a content of nitrogen in the synthesis gas obtained at a<br>
later stage, the addition of an as oxidizing agent is not feasible<br>
[0005] It would be a real economic benefit if it were possible to add the oxygen required<br>
for synthesis gas production without additional process step, i.e. direct oxygen feed by<br><br>
means of a conductive membrane into the oxidation reactor, and if even air could be used<br>
as feedstock for the O2 needed.<br>
[0006] In this context, laboratory scale processes are known which use so-called concur-<br>
rently conductive membranes (in US patent 6,077,323 also named: mixed conducting<br>
membrane) for synthesis gas production. These concurrently conductive materials are still<br>
in the development stage and they are compounds which under appropriate operating<br>
conditions exhibit a conducting capacity for electrons and oxygen ions to a significant ex-<br>
tent in each case. Materials which are exclusively oxygen ions conductive, hence without<br>
permeability to electrons, and which require charge balancing via an external power circuit,<br>
are of minor importance only.<br>
[0007] In case such type of materials are used to form gas-tight or almost gas-tight mem-<br>
branes and then they undergo heating up to the operating temperature, an oxygen flux will<br>
be established across the membrane, provided there is a partial pressure gradient be-<br>
tween the feed side and the permeative side as stated below, thereby exploiting defective<br>
lattice	sections:<br><br>
[0008] Each O2 molecule originating from the permeative side and sent into the reaction<br>
chamber will release a charge of 4 e , which is transported to the feed side counter-current<br>
to the oxygen flux.<br>
[0009] In this case the transport of the oxygen takes place in the ionic form, i.e. there is a<br>
theoretical oxygen-specific selectivity of the membrane to an indefinite extent. Thus, a<br>
membrane that is free of defective sectors and air being used as the oxygen supplier per-<br>
mits the separation of the oxygen from the residual air constituents such as nitrogen.<br>
[0010] According to the a: ve information, it is known in the present state of the art that<br>
oxidation reactions can take place with the aid of oxygen consuctive materials, with a reac-<br>
tor being used to divide the reactor into two chambers by means of a concurrently conduc-<br>
tive membrane. During o\ ation an oxygen containing gas or gas mixture is fed on the<br>
one side of the membrane membrane module, while the opposite side of the membrane<br>
(hereinafter referred to as external surface or permeative side) is provided with the fluid to<br>
be oxidised. US 5,820,655 A, for example, describes the use of such a membrane reactor.<br>
Oxygen carrying gases such as water vapour, CO2 or preferably air are exploited. During<br>
operation, oxygen permeates the membrane from the side with a higher partial pressure of<br><br>
the oxygen and then it reacts with the oxidisable fluid that is present on the opposite side.<br>
In the case of synthesis gas production, the preferred oxidisable fluid is hydrocarbon such<br>
as methane or natural gas with a high methane content water vapour being typically<br>
added to preclude coking.<br>
[0011] Since the oxygen constantly undergoes reaction, the oxygen partial pressure on<br>
the permeative side is below the partial pressure of the oxygen on the feedside so that<br>
further oxygen continues to permeate. This is why air with a more or less indefinite pres-<br>
sure can be used on the feed side, while a considerably higher pressure simultaneously<br>
prevails on the permeative side. The minimum limit for the oxygen partial pressure is set to<br>
be higher than that on the permeative side.<br>
[0012] In order to obtain acceptable reaction velocities and consequently integral selectivi-<br>
ties on the permeative side, for instance, in the synthesis gas production, it is a typical<br>
practice to use an appropriate catalyst in the reaction chamber of the reactor. Documents<br>
EP 0 999 180 A2, EP 1 035 072 A1, US 6,077,323 or US 6,695,983 describe typical ex-<br>
amples of that application At the specified operating conditions, oxygen permeates the<br>
membrane from the feed side and is converted on the opposite permeative side. The driv-<br>
ing force for this permeation is the difference in partial pressure of the oxyen on the two<br>
sides of the membrane. As this pressure is constantly maintained by the oxygen undergo-<br>
ing a permanent reaction, it is possible to perform the synthesis gas production with the aid<br>
of air on the feed side and a hydrocarbon/water vapour mixture on the permeative side,<br>
thereby using air at atmospheric pressure or a pressure that only slightly exceeds the said<br>
pressure.<br>
[0013] The mixed conductive materials are typically ceramic materials which on account of<br>
an oxygen defective structure under appropriate operating conditions, possess the ability<br>
of conducting oxygen ions. Appropriate operating conditions in this case are understood to<br>
mean a sufficiently high temperature of &gt; 600°C as well as an oxygen partial pressure dif-<br>
ference via the ceramic material. Such materials may typically originate from the group of<br>
perowskite (ABO3) or perove skite-related structures, fluorite structures (AO2), aurivillius<br>
structures ([Bi202][An-1BnOx) or Brownmillerite structures (A2B2O5). Composite materials of<br>
ion and electron conductive materials may also be suitable Typical examples of oxygen<br>
conductive materials or material classes quoted in the technical literature are: La1<br>
x(Ca,Sr,Ba)xCo1-yFeyO3-δ,	Ba(Sr)Co1-xFexO3-δ,	Sr(Ba)Ti(Zr)1-x-y,	CoyFexO3-δ,<br>
La1-xSrxGa1-yFeyO3-δ, La0,5Sr0. 5MnO3-δ, LaFe(Ni)O3-δ, La0.9Sr0.1FeO3-δ or BaCoxFeyZr1-x-yO3-δ.<br>
(A. Thursfield, I. S. Metcalfe, J. Mat. Sci., 2004, 14, 275-2485).<br><br>
[0014] Furthermore, multiphase composite materials may for example be exploited, too.<br>
Materials that are suitable t, technical applications are those with as high an oxygen per-<br>
meability as possible. Typics; values in this case approximate &gt;0.1 Nm3 / (m2 h) oxygen.<br>
[0015] A certain problem, however, is the chemical and mechanical stability of the mem-<br>
branes. The specialist skilled in the art is for example in a position to calculate the balance<br>
oxygen partial pressure of a synthesis gas stream of standard composition to be 
bars at 900°C and 30 bars total pressure.<br>
[0016] On the other hand, the materials used as mixed conductive materials are normally<br>
oxidic ceramics which tend to cause a reduction and consequently destruction of the crys-<br>
tal structure in a range that is below the oxygen partial pressure depending on the con-<br>
stituents of the membrane Thus, a specialist skilled in the art can for example, easily cal-<br>
culate that CoO usually contained in such materials will be reduced to form elemental Co<br>
at a temperature of 900°C and the above mentioned oxygen partial pressure of 
bars. This theoretical evaluation can also be substantiated by means of a test series as<br>
described in the example c&gt;= comparison.<br>
[0017] A further peril originating from such high oxygen partial pressure gradients may<br>
emanate from tensions chemically induced. Depending on the level of the respective oxy-<br>
gen partial pressure on either side of the membrane, different oxygen defective structures<br>
will develop within the crystal lattice of the membrane. This will inevitably lead to different<br>
crystal lattice constants on the feed and permeative side of the membrane. The mechani-<br>
cal load thus induced which is also named chemically induced tension may perhaps cause<br>
a destruction of the membrane.<br>
[0018] Example of comparison 1<br>
Test samples of materia!? Ba(Co,Fe,Zr)O3-δ suitable for concurrently conductive mem-<br>
branes, hereinafter referred to as BCFZ (Journal of Membrane Science, 2005, 258, 1-4),<br>
were exposed to a synthesis gas atmosphere at a temperas re of 850°C and a pressure of<br>
1 bar, the chemical compesition of the atmosphere was as ested below:<br><br><br><br>
[0020] After the said period the crystal structure of the test pieces was determined by X-<br>
Ray Diffraction (XRD) depending on the dwelling time. Fig. 1 shows the results of the<br>
comparison. The relative intensity for the six dwelling times selected for the membrane<br>
was plotted in relation to the diffraction angle (Theta). The new peaks of relative intensity<br>
that occurred vis-a-vis the 0 h value during prolonged dwelling time revealed, inter alia,<br>
that elemental Co as well as various independent oxide phases had formed. Simultane-<br>
ously the peaks crucial for the Perovskite phase disappeared. It became obvious that a<br>
rather short period of only 50 h caused a degradation of the crystal structure which leads<br>
to a disruption of the intended functionality of the membrane, i.e. to local decomposition.<br>
[0021] In addition to the destruction of the membrane, the presence of air on one side of<br>
the membrane entailed the formation of various different lattice constants on either side of<br>
the membrane, which caused mechanical load as a result of chemically induced tensions<br>
(F. Boroomand, E. Wessel, H. Bausinger, K. Hilpert, Solid State Ionics, 2000, 129, 251-<br>
258; S. B. Adler, J. Am. Ceram. Soc, 2001, 84, 2117-2119)<br>
[0022] On the empirical as well as theoretical bases one must therefore fear that a ce-<br>
ramic membrane of the BCFZ composition will be destroyed when being used for the syn-<br>
thesis gas production so that hitherto no industrial exploitation has taken place although<br>
the material properties are essentially appropriate for the application.<br>
[0023] In addition it cannot be precluded that placing the catalyst material in direct contact<br>
with the membrane at the required temperature of &gt; 800°C; will cause solids reactions in<br>
the contact area of the surfaces involved, which would contribute to a degradation or local<br>
destruction of the membrane.<br>
[0024] EU 0,999,180 A2 reveals a possibility of avoiding this destruction. The addition of<br>
oxygenates such as CO2 or water vapour on the permeative side of the membrane is rec-<br>
ommended in this document. This measure increases the balance oxygen partial pressure<br>
on the permeative side of the membrane to a value above the limit normally leading to a<br>
reduction of the membrane. However, the high investment costs and operating expenditure<br>
required for the necessary gas recycle system within the plant and for the narrow variation<br><br>
margin of the balance oxygen partial pressure are a real problem. In the case of the typical<br>
balance oxygen partial pressures of 10-10 bars that can be obtained on the permeative<br>
side, the membrane materials are in fact no longer reduced but nevertheless chemically<br>
induced tensions continue to occur. Hence, the return of the oxygenates is essentially un-<br>
suitable for improving the reduction stability and simultaneously the mechanical stability<br>
and, moreover, such measure also decreases the plant economy of this process.<br>
[0025] From the state-of-the-art viewpoint the objective is to develop an oxidation reactor<br>
with an oxygen conducting membrane that has a high reduction stability and a high me-<br>
chanical stability, the membrane being stable against the catalyst, without causing a deg-<br>
radation of the crystal structure which leads to a disruption of the intended functionality of<br>
the membrane by a local decomposition, because it is assumed that placing the catalyst<br>
material in direct contact with the membrane at the required temperature of &gt; 800°C will<br>
cause solid reactions in the contact area of the surfaces involved, which will contribute to a<br>
degradation or local destruction of the membrane.<br>
[0026] The aim of the present invention is achieved by an oxidation reactor that is pro-<br>
vided with a feed line for piping the oxygen bearing gas to a distribution chamber or a<br>
header element. In addition the said reactor is equipped with a feed line for raw gas to be<br>
completely or partially oxidised, the said line being connected to a reaction chamber which<br>
has a multitude of gas-tight oxygen conducting membrane elements.<br>
[0027] With reference to the oxygen transport the membrane elements have an inlet sur-<br>
face area and an outlet surface area, the latter being defined as external surface located<br>
on the side of the reaction chamber. The membrane elements ensure the connection be-<br>
tween the distribution chamber or collecting chamber and/or discharge section. During<br>
operation the oxygen bearing gas can flow through the reactor in the following order: inlet,<br>
distribution chamber, membrane element, collecting chamber and/or outlet section, the<br>
reaction chamber being filled with catalyst.<br>
[0028] One or several subcer elements are used to establish a defined minimum space<br>
between the external surface of the membrane elements nd / or a bundle of such ele-<br>
ments on the one side a: the catalyst space on the othe rhe said bundle or group may<br>
consist of parallel or twis or drilled membrane element; The catalyst is fillable and can<br>
be filled into the reaction chamber, and the spacer elements are catalytically active com-<br>
ponents which oxidise in the membrane contact sections during the specified reactor op-<br>
eration and thus become inert, and are placed in contact with the outlet area of the mem-<br>
brane.<br><br>
[0029] It is recommended that the above mentioned spacer elements of the reactor de-<br>
scribed in this document be formed as prefabricated pieces that enclose the bundle or<br>
group or be arranged in advanced position towards the reaction chamber. The prefabri-<br>
cated blocks may be made of the bulk type and/or as single element such as a jacket pipe.<br>
In this case, the inert material has either a pore volume or a perforated section that is<br>
smaller than the fines portion of the catalyst packing.<br>
[0030] In a further embodiment the spacer elements may consist of one or several materi-<br>
als which are directly applied to the external membrane surface. Spacer elements of such<br>
a type with a porous structure, the volume of which is smaller than the fines content of the<br>
bulk catalyst material, retain the catalyst in such a manner that it comes not into direct con-<br>
tact with the oxygen conducting membrane.<br>
[0031] A comparable method of retaining the catalyst is to form the spacer elements as<br>
catalytically active components which oxidise in the intended sections during the specified<br>
reactor operation and thus become inert and which are placed opposite the outlet area of<br>
the membrane and/or are arranged to come into slight contact.<br>
[0032] The shape of the spacer elements made in accordance with the invention is either<br>
regular or of an irregular structure. The said spacers can also be enhanced by providing<br>
them with one or several catalytically active surfaces, the ideal shape of the spacers being<br>
such that the surfaces pointing towards the reaction chamber are provided with a catalyti-<br>
cally active material coat or consist of the said material.<br>
[0033] The present invention also encompasses an oxidation reactor which essentially<br>
complies with the type of reactor described above but which by adequate shaping of the<br>
catalyst in the reaction chamber provides for a minimum distance between the external<br>
surface of the membrane element or a group or bundle of membrane elements and the<br>
catalyst itself. A particularly advantageous embodiment of the catalyst provides for a bar<br>
type or surface type shape .<br>
[0034] The oxidation receptor can be further improved by gluing or sintering one side of the<br>
catalyst to fix it adequately to the plate. In the case of such a design it is common practice<br>
to arrange in parallel the membrane and the catalyst and to obtain by this method a de<br>
fined distance with accurate centreline.<br>
[0035] A beneficial embodiment of the invention provides for membrane elements installed<br>
in the above mentioned oxidation reactors and made of one or several material that orgi-<br><br>
nate from group of Perovskite (ABO3), Perovskite-related structures, fluorite structures<br>
(AO2), Aurivillius structures ([Bi2O2]An-1BnOx]) or Brownmillente structures (A2B205). A type<br>
of membrane that is particularly suited for the 02 transport and consequently for the utiliza-<br>
tion in oxidation reactors is either made of one material or several materials which can be<br>
described by the formulae listed below: La1.x(Ca,Sr,Ba)xCo1_yFey03.8, Ba(Sr)Co1.xFexO3.5,<br>
Sr(Ba)Ti(Zr)1.x.yCoyFexO3-8, BaCoxFeyZri.x.y03-5, LaLxS^Ga^FeyOM, La2NixFey04-8,<br>
Lao,5Sro,5MnO3.5, LaFe(Ni)03.8 oder La0,9Sr0,iFeO3.6.<br>
[0036] An ideal version of such membrane elements exhibits an oxygen permeability<br>
which at approx. 950°C and an oxygen partial pressure difference of &gt;0.1 bar between the<br>
free gas phases located on the two sides of the membrane approximates an average value<br>
of &gt; 0.1 Nm3/(m2h).<br>
[0037] Moreover, the invention also encompasses a process for the oxidation of fluids in<br>
an oxidation reactor that is constructed in line with the design types described above, with<br>
the reaction chamber being filled with a catalyst:<br>
oxygen or an oxygan-bearing gas is admitted via the inlet into the distribution<br>
chamber of the oxidation reactor,<br>
a gas or gas mixtire to be oxidised is piped into the reaction chamber,<br>
-	the temperature in the reaction chamber ranging from 200 to 1200°C, preferably<br>
from 500 to 1000°C and in the ideal version from 700 to 900 °C and furthermore,<br>
-	at a pressure between 1 - 200 bars, preferably 10 - 70 bars and in the ideal ver-<br>
sion 30 to 60 bars<br>
[0038] A beneficial embodiment of the invention provides for an oxidation process in which<br>
the gas to be oxidised preferably has a content of methane or natural gas with a high<br>
methane portion, which may also contain non-oxidisable ingredients.<br>
[0039] Moreover, the invention also encompasses the us«; of the above mentioned oxida=<br>
tion process in a configuration dedicated to the production of synthesis gas with the main<br>
ingredients H2 and CO. The present invention also covers he use of the oxidation process<br>
as described in this document in order to perform the oxidative dehydration of alkanes,<br>
oxidative methane coupling, partial oxidation of higher hydrocarbon derivatives or selective<br>
oxidation of constituents of gas mixtures.<br><br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
AN OXIDATION REACTOR AND A PROCESS FOR THE OXIDATION OF<br>
FLUIDS<br>
The invention relates to an oxidation reactor and process suited to operate the said<br>
reactor which houses a multitude of gas-tight and oxygen conductive membrane<br>
elements the external surfaces of which are arranged on the side of a reaction<br>
chamber to be filled with catalyst and which constitute, in conjunction with the<br>
membrane elements penetrable by oxygenous gas, a connection between the<br>
distribution chamber and a collection chamber and/or discharge section of the<br>
reactor. The reactor is characterized in that one or several spacer pieces establish a<br>
defined minimum distance between the external surface of a membrane element<br>
and the catalyst in the reaction chamber.</td>
