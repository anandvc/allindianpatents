CORPORATION	ORGANISED	AND<br>
EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF CHINA, WHOSE ADDRESS IS BAK INDUSTRIAL PARK, KUICHONG, LONGGANG DISTRICT, SHENZHEN, GUANGDONG 518119, CHINA<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY	DESCRIBES	THE<br>
INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention belongs to the high-energy electrochemistry field, and relates particularly to a method for preparing a spherical doped nickelous hydroxide and a multi-metal oxide, and a lithium ion battery.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Currently a lithium ion battery has an extensive application in such electronic devices as mobile telephones, portable computers, and portable audio-visual equipment. However, price of its anode material, lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2), is going up continuously because of resource problems, which limits development of the lithium ion battery. Therefore, people have been working hard to look for a suitable substitute material. The material recently studied most is such composite anode materials as cobalt nickel manganese. The most widely used method reported in literature is a codeposition method. According to this method, prepare a metal salt solution according to a certain proportion; add such additives as ammonia water to control crystallization velocity of a hydroxide; and then react with an alkali to produce a deposit. In accordance with this method, add ammonia water into a base solution; after the salt solution is dripped into the base solution, first such metallic ions as Ni2+ and Co2+ have a complexation with ammonia (NH3) to produce a complex ion of X(NH3) n2+(n = 1 ~ 6, X = Ni, Co), concentration of the metallic ion being lowered; then amount of Ni2+ and Co2+ is dramatically reduced due to their reaction with OH" to produce a hydroxide deposit; and then M(NH3)n2+ releases the complex metallic ions to keep a certain concentration of the metallic ions in the solution. However, this method has the following shortcoming: After the salt solution is added into the base solution, ammonia (NH3) and OH" coexist with the metallic ions, resulting in a<br>
competitive behavior; and it is very difficult for ammonia (NH3) to control crystallization due to the<br><br><br>
fact that it is easier for OH' than NH3 to react with such ions as Ni and Co , which makes the intermediate particles have an irregular microstructure and a wider size distribution. <br>
Umicore, Belgium thinks that the material with a bigger particle size has a poorer cycling performance. According to the research done by Guoliang Wu et al., particle size distribution of the material has a remarkable influence on the discharge capacity, especially on the charge-discharge cycling performance; and the wider the particle size distribution, the poorer the cycling performance. The reason is that, the material with a wider particle size distribution will have a poor porosity, which affects its capillarity with an electrolyte and thus makes the impedance show higher; and when the battery is charged to an extreme potential, Li+ on surface of a big particle will deintercalate excessively, which will damage its layered structure and is to the disadvantage of the cycling performance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Aiming at the shortcoming of the above method, a purpose of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing the spherical doped nickelous hydroxide, by which the spherical doped nickelous hydroxide has a regular structure and a narrow particle size distribution, the particle size is easy to be controlled, and an industrialized production is made possible.<br>
Another purpose of the present invention is to provide a multi-metal oxide with high electrical conductivity and good cycling performances as well as its preparation method.<br>
Still another purpose of the present invention is to provide an anode material of the lithium ion battery with high electrical conductivity and good cycling performance as well as a lithium ion secondary battery.<br>
The technical solution for realizing the above-mentioned purposes is as below:<br>
A method for synthesizing the spherical doped nickelous hydroxide is provided, including the following steps:<br>
1) First mix a bivalent nickel salt and a bivalent cobalt salt with ammonia water and an ammonium<br><br><br>
salt to produce a complex solution; and<br>
2) then add the complex solution produced in Step 1) and a mixed solution of a metal salt and an alkali solution into a reaction vessel in parallel flow, stir to produce deposit of the spherical doped nickelous hydroxide, and wash away impurity ions.<br>
It is preferred that the metal salt is chosen from an aluminum salt, a magnesium salt, or a mixture of the two. The aluminum salt and the magnesium salt are preferred to be a nitrate or an acetate.<br>
It is preferred that, concentration of ammonia water in Step 1) is 0.1 ~ 1 mol/L, and concentration of the ammonium salt 0.02 ~ 0.25 mol/L. The molar ratio of ammonia water to the ammonium salt is 4 : 1 ~ 5 : 1, the acid group of the ammonium salt being the same to that of the nickel salt and the cobalt salt.<br>
It is preferred that, the nickel salt and the cobalt salt are a sulfate, a nitrate, a chloride or an acetate, while the alkali solution is NaOH or KOH; and the molar ratio of total of the nickel salt, the cobalt salt, and the dopant metal salt to the alkali solution is 1 : 2.1 ~ 1 : 2.4.<br>
It is preferred that, there is further a base solution in the reaction vessel; the base solution is a mixed buffer solution of ammonia water and the ammonium salt, with concentration of ammonia water in the base solution being lower than that in Step 1); and amount of the base solution is such that lower end of a stirring paddle can just be stretched into the base solution on bottom of the vessel and stir the base solution. Concentration of ammonia water in the base solution is preferred to be half of that in Step 1). The stirring velocity is preferred to be 100 ~ 600 r/min.<br>
A method for preparing the multi-metal oxide is also provided for the purposes of the present invention. That is, dry deposit of the spherical doped nickelous hydroxide prepared by the above-mentioned method, mix it uniformly with lithium hydroxide, and obtain the finished product by high-temperature sintering.<br>
It is preferred that, the molar ratio of total of the nickel salt, the cobalt salt, and the metal salt to the single-water lithium hydroxide is 1 : 1.02-1 : 1.07; when the metal salt is chosen from an aluminum salt, a magnesium salt, or a mixture of the two, total of the metal salt is the total of Ni, Co<br><br><br>
and Al, or the total of Ni, Co and Mg, or the total of Ni, Co, Al and Mg.<br>
It is preferred that, the stirring velocity for mixing is 100 ~ 600 r/min, and the drying temperature 150 ~ 200.; the high-temperature sintering is performed at 700 ~ 800, and the sintering duration is 12-24 hours.<br>
The present invention further provides a lithium ion secondary battery, whose anode active material contains the multi-metal oxide prepared by the above-mentioned method.<br>
And the present invention still further provides a multi-metal oxide with an expression of LiCoaNibMi-a.bO2, where M stands for aluminum or magnesium, a = 0.03 -0.15, and b = 0.6 ~ 0.82.<br>
The above-mentioned multi-metal oxide is suitable as anode material of the lithium ion battery.<br>

1)	Dope with the metallic ions when producing a spherical nickel intermediate, making the dopant metallic ions produce a more uniform mixed hydroxide intermediate material in liquid phase with cobalt and nickel; during the high-temperature sintering process of this intermediate, the dopant ions can better go into a void among unit cells of the material, which improves stability of the layered deintercalation structure, and restrains or decelerates phase transition during the charge-discharge process;<br>
2)	while preparing the spherical doped nickelous hydroxide, since before codeposition mix the bivalent nickel salt and cobalt salt with ammonia water and the ammonium salt to produce the complex solution (a buffer solution around pH = 7 can be produced with the ammonium salt and ammonia water; there will appear no deposit in the complex solution, whose main purpose is to prevent cobalt from depositing), and then add the complex solution and the mixed solution of the dopant metal salt and the alkali solution into the reaction vessel in parallel flow to produce deposit of the spherical doped nickelous hydroxide, this method effectively prevents the problem that particles are difficult to grow up into a sphere due to direct addition of the alkali solution;<br>
3)	in view of the fact that the complex solution and the mixture of the salt and the alkali solution<br><br><br>
are added into the reaction vessel in parallel flow to produce deposit of the spherical doped nickelous hydroxide, as long as the flow velocity is kept constant, pH value in the reaction vessel can be kept constant without the problem that the pH value rises; therefore, by the method of the present invention, the velocity at which the spherical doped nickelous hydroxide is prepared in the reaction vessel and the uniform particle size can be guaranteed, size of the intermediate effectively controlled, and a narrow particle size distribution of the synthesized intermediate obtained;<br>
4)	because the reaction vessel is added with the mixed buffer base solution of ammonia water and the ammonium salt, it is guaranteed that right from the beginning of feeding, the complex solution and the alkali solution can be stirred uniformly; and presence of the buffer base solution can guarantee that fluctuation of the pH value is very small when the reaction begins;<br>
5)	it can be seen with reference to embodiments and data to be described in detail below that, the multi-metal oxide (LiCoaNibMi.a.bO2) prepared by the method of the present invention has a uniform particle size distribution, with the particle size being about 6—10 um, the first charge-discharge specific capacity up to 170 mAh/g, the first charge-discharge efficiency close to 80%, and a tap density 2.4 g/cm3, keeping both a higher specific capacity and a higher tap density; according to an experiment with a button battery, the multi-metal oxide shows good cycling performance, with a specific capacity of 120 mAh/g remaining after 100 cycling times; it has high-voltage resistance and can be charged up to 4.5 V, with good safety performance; and<br>
6)	because the above-mentioned controlled crystallization method is adopted for preparing the spherical doped nickelous hydroxide, the process is simple and easy to be controlled, there is no need for "emptying" the reaction vessel, a continuous production is possible with a high production efficiency, and a large-scale production is feasible.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing a multi-metal oxide and its intermediate, i.e. a spherical doped nickelous hydroxide. The intermediate is prepared by a two-step process: Mix a bivalent nickel salt and a bivalent cobalt salt with ammonia water and an ammonium salt to produce a complex solution; then add the complex solution and a mixed solution of a metal salt and an alkali solution into a reaction vessel in parallel flow; and finally stir to produce deposit of the spherical doped nickelous hydroxide, and wash away impurity ions. The produced spherical doped nickelous hydroxide, as an intermediate, can be used to produce a multi-metal oxide. The produced multi-metal oxide can be used for preparing an anode active material of a lithium ion battery. The spherical doped nickelous hydroxide, according to the present invention, has advantages of uniform size and narrow particle size distribution; and the multi-metal oxide has high electrical conductivity and good cycling performance, and is particularly suitable as an anode material of the lithium ion battery.</td>
