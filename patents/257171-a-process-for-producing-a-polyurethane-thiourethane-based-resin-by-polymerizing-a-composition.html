				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a polyurethane/thiourethane-based resin and a process for producing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Since plastic lenses are lighter, less fragile, and tintable, as compared with inorganic lenses, therefore, in recent years, the application of plastic lenses to optical elements such as spectacles lenses, camera lenses and the like has increased rapidly.<br>
[0003]<br>
In particular, spectacles lenses have been required to have various features including optical properties such as (a) high refractive index and (b) low dispersion (high Abbe's number), and being (c) excellent in heat resistance, (d) excellent in impact resistance, (e) easily tintable, (f) excellent in working properties such as cutting properties, or the like. Accordingly, various resin materials for lenses have been developed and used until now.<br>
[0004]<br>
Representative examples of. those can be mentioned by <br>
polythiourethane-based resins (Patent Documents I and 2) . Among the polythiourethane-based resins, a polythiouretane-based resin obtained by using a polyisocyanate compound represented by Formula (1) (Patent Document 3) is used to provide a plastic lens having a high refractive index and low dispersion property, and exhibiting excellent heat resistance and impact resistance, thus it has been widely used for spectacles lenses.<br>
(FormulaRemoved)<br>
[0005]<br>
In Patent Document 4, there disclosed a plastic lens prepared by using a polyurethane/thiourethane-based resin, where the lens has a refractive index of 1.545 to 1.556 and excellent impact resistance, and is obtained by the reaction between diisocyanate oligomer obtained by reacting specific amounts of isophorone diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, and a divalent alcohol at a temperature between 40°C and 70°C, and specific polythiol.<br>
[0006]<br>
In addition, in the case of industrially preparing lenses, generally a large quantity of monomeric mixture is prepared at once, filtered thorough a fine filter of about 1 to 3 micron over number of hours to remove fine insoluble fractions and dust, and then the resultant is injected into a mold to be cured.<br>
[0007]<br>
Therefore, there has been demanded a simple preparation of monomeric mixture, little heat generation upon blending, low viscosity of the mixture, low rate in viscosity increase, excellent filtration property and the like, from the viewpoints of handleability and productivity.<br>
[0008]<br>
However, when carrying out the reaction between a polyisocyanate compound, a polythiol compound, and a polyol compound, during the preparation of the lens prepared by using a polyurethane/thiourethane-based resin, there has been a case where the reaction between an isocyanate group and a thiol group is accelerated by the heat caused from the reaction between a hydroxy group and an isocyanate group because the reaction of an isocyanate group with a hydroxy group proceeds faster than the reaction of an isocyanate group with a thiol group, thus may result in a runaway reaction. In consequent, depending on the conditions, abrupt heat generation by monomer upon blending, high viscosity, thereby being difficult to carry out injection into a mold, have come up as the concerns. In addition, there is room for improvement in blending large amount of monomer. Accordingly, there has been demanded a blending method by which a large heat generation is not occurred even if a polyisocyanate compound, a polythiol compound, and a polyol compound are blended in large quantity, and the temperature is sufficiently controlled.<br>
[0009]<br>
In the aforementioned Patent Document 4, in order to avoid such runaway reaction,, there disclosed a method which includes reacting<br>
$, mixture of isophorone diisocyanate and hexamethylene diisocyanate with ethylene glycol or propylene glycol as s particularly preferable divalent alcohol compound at a temperature between 40°C and 70°C for 19 hours, so as to first obtain diisocyanate oligomer, and then carrying out a polymerization with a thiol compound. [0010]<br>
In Patent Document 5, there disclosed that a molded product having high impact strength can be obtained by polymerizing an isocyanate compound with a specific structure, an aliphatic diol compound, and a polythiol compound with a specific structure. [0011]<br>
However, in the case of employing<br>
tris(6-isocyanatohexyl)isocyanulate which is one of the isocyanate compounds with a specific structure, since it is a trifunctional compound, initial viscosity thereof is high and this viscosity increases further while proceeding the polymerization, thereby leading to difficulty in blending monomer in large quantity.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION [0012] The present invention is made in the light of the above<br>
considerations, and is to provide a method of preparing a polymerizable solution without causing a large heat generation and an abrupt viscosity increase upon blending during producing a polyurethane/thiourethane-based optical resin using a polyisocyanate compound, a polyol compound, and a polythiol compound, and which further provides an optical resin prepared by using the polymerizable solution, and a process for producing the same.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0015]<br>
The process for producing a polyurethane/thiourethane-based resin of the invention includes polymerizing a component (A), a component (B), and a component (C) shown below:<br>
(A) at least one polyisocyanate compound selected from the group consisting of an alicyclic isocyanate compound represented by the following Formula (1) or Formula (2):<br>
[0016] (FormulaRemoved)<br>
[0017](FormulaRemoved)<br>
hexamethylene diisocyanate, and dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate; [0018]<br>
(B)	at least one polythiol compound optionally having at least<br>
one (poly)sulfide bond in a molecule; and<br>
(C)	at least one polyol compound having at least one ether bond<br>
and two or more hydroxy groups in a molecule.<br>
[0019]<br>
For the production process, the process step in which components (A) to (C) are polymerized is, for example, a process step in which a mixture of components (A) to (C) is heat-polymerized in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
[0020]<br>
For the invention, the order of mixing the components is not particularly limited, and for example, there may be employed:<br>
(j) a method of adding the component (C) to the component (A), thereafter adding the component (B) thereto, and polymerizing the obtained mixture; or<br>
(ii) a method of adding the component (B) and the component (C) to the component (A), and polymerizing the obtained mixture.<br>
[0021]<br>
For the above (i) , it is preferable that the component (B) is added after adding whole component (C) to the component (A). Alternatively, the component (B) may be added after preliminarily reacting the component (A) with the component (C) and subjected to polymerization. More specifically, (B) at least one polythiol compound optionally having at least one (poly)sulfide bond in a molecule may be added after adding (C) at least one polyol compound having at least one ether bond and two or more hydroxy groups in a molecule to (A) at least one polyisocyanate compound, and the obtained mixture may be heat-cured in the presence of a catalyst so as to form a resin.<br>
[0022]<br>
More specifically in the case of above (ii),<br>
(A)	at least one polyisocyanate compound,<br>
(B)	at least one polythiol compound optionally having at least one<br>
(poly)sulfide bond in a molecule, and<br>
(C)	at least one polyol compound having at least one ether bond and<br>
two or more hydroxy groups in a molecule,<br>
may be mixed at once, and the obtained mixture may be heat-cured in the presence of a catalyst to form a resin. [0023]<br>
According to the production process of the invention, since the compound used as the component (C) is a polyol compound having ether bond(s) in a molecular structure, a resin can be produced by any of aforementioned method (i) a prepolymer method and method (ii) a batch method without causing a large heat generation or an abrupt viscosity increase upon blending the raw materials. Further, since it is possible to obtain a homogeneous mixture of the components (A) to (C), a homogeneous resin can be produced.<br>
[0024]<br>
In addition, when a polyurethane/thiourethane-based resin is produced in accordance with the production process of the invention, a runaway reaction can be prevented from occurring upon blending monomer. Thus, an extreme increase in monomer viscosity is not occurred, and the viscosity of a monomeric mixture, that is a mixture of components (A) to (C), upon the injection into a mold can be controlled to be 500 mPa.s or lower at a temperature of at least 20°C, preferably not lower than°C 20 and not higher than 30°C. Therefore, injection of the mixture can be easily carried out. When the<br>
viscosity at a temperature of 20 or higher and 30°C or lower is too high, the fluidity decreases, thereby becoming difficult to be injected in general.<br>
[0025]<br>
The viscosity of the mixture of components (A) to (C) is, for example, a viscosity measured on a liquid using a B-type viscometer, where the liquid is prepared from a mixed solution obtained by adding components (A) to (C) in accordance with the predetermined order and method, by being mixed and dissolved at a predetermined temperature<br>
for 30 minutes and being allowed for a reaction to take place.<br>
[0026]<br>
According to the production process of the invention, a polyurethane/thiourethane-based resin is produced. Such resin is suitable, for example, as an optical resin. More specifically, such resin is suitable for use as lenses for spectacles and the like, or materials for other optical components.<br>
[0027]<br>
Hereinafter, aforementioned components (A) to (C) will be explained, respectively, with reference to specific examples, but the invention is not limited by those exemplified compounds mentioned below.

Among these, the component (B) is preferably 4-mercaptomethyl-l,8-dimercapto-3,6-dithiaoctane, 2,5-bismercaptomethyl-l,4-dithiane, 1,1,3,3-tetrakis(mercaptomethylthio)propane, 5,7-dimercaptomethyl-l,ll-dimercapto-3,6,9-trithiaundecane, 4,7-dimercaptomethyl-l,ll-dimercapto-3,6,9-trithiaundecane, or 4,8-dimercaptomethyl-l,ll-dimercapto-3,6,9-trithiaundecane, from the viewpoints of economic efficiency and optical properties of the resin to be obtained. However, the invention is not limited by these exemplified compounds. These may be used alone, respectively, or as a mixture of two or more kinds.<br>
[0034]<br>
Next, the component (C) will be explained.<br>
The (C) polyol compound having at least one ether bond and two or more hydroxy groups in a molecule is, for example, at least one kind selected from the group consisting of following (D), (E), (F), and (G):<br>
(D)	diethylene glycol or triethylene glycol;<br>
(E)	a polyol compound having an average molecular weight of<br>
00 or larger and 2,000 or smaller, which is obtained by a chain extension of the terminal by reacting a compound represented by following Formula (3) with ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide, or a mixture of two or more kinds thereof:<br>
HO-R1-OH   (3) (in above Formula (3) , Rl is an ethylene group or a propylene group) ;<br>
(F) a polyol compound having an average molecular weight of 180 or larger and 1,000 or smaller, which is obtained by a chain extension of the terminal by reacting a compound represented by following Formula (4) with ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide, or a mixture of two or more kinds thereof:<br>
[0035] (FormulaRemoved)<br>
[0036]<br>
(in above Formula (4) , n is 0 or 1, and R2 is a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, an ethyl group, or a hydroxyl group); and<br>
(G) a polyol compound having an average molecular weight of 840 or larger and 1,530 or smaller, which is obtained by a chain extension of the terminal by reacting sorbitol with ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide; or a mixture of two or more kinds thereof.<br>
[0037]<br>
Those mentioned above as (C) the polyol compound having at least<br>
one ether bond and two or more hydroxy groups in a molecule may be used alone or in combination of plural kinds. In addition, other polyols may also be used in addition to (C) the polyol compounds having at least one ether bond and two or more hydroxy groups in a molecule. In this case, a mixture of the component (C) and other polyol may also be used.<br>
[0038]<br>
In the invention, the average molecular weight of the component (C) is specifically a molecular weight calculated from the formula:<br>
Hydroxyl Value (mgKOH/g) =<br>
number of average functional groups x 56,100 / molecular weight.<br>
[0039]<br>
In the above formula, the hydroxyl value represents *mg number' of KOH required for neutralizing carboxylic acids produced as a by-product upon esterifying the hydroxyl group in 1 g of polyol with acid anhydride.<br>
[0040]<br>
Herein, the used ratio of (A) the polyisocyanate compound, (B) the polythiol compound optionally having at least one (poly)sulfide bond in a molecule and the (C) the polyol compound having at least one ether bond and two or more hydroxy groups in a molecule, is such that the molar ratio of functional groups represented by NCO/ (SH+OH) is in the range of 0.5 or more and 3.0 or less, preferably 0.5 or more and 1.5 or less, and particularly preferably 0.8 or more and 1. 2 or less. Within this range, a resin with well-balanced refractive index, impact resistance, tintability, and heat resistance can be<br>
obtained.<br>
[0041]<br>
Here, there is a concern that the curing property of the polymerizable composition deteriorates when the value of NCO/ (SH+OH) is too small. The curing property of the polymerizable composition can be further improved by making NCO/(SH+OH) to be 0.5 or larger, preferably 0. 8 or larger. In this manner, mechanical properties such as resin strength or impact resistance of the resin can be further improved.<br>
[0042]<br>
In addition, there is a concern that the refractive index of the resin lowers when the value of NCO/(SH+OH) is too large because the refractive index increases as the amount of SH groups in the resin increases. The refractive index of the resin can be increased by making NCO/(SH+OH) to be 3.0 or smaller, preferably 1.5 or smaller, and more preferably 1.2 or smaller. In this manner, the resin can be further preferably employed to, for example, an optical component.<br>
[0043]<br>
Further, when given that the number of moles of a hydroxy group in the component (C) is p and the number of moles of a thiol group in the component (B) is r, p/(p+r) is in the range of usually 0.001 or more and 0.40 or less, preferably 0.03 or more and 0.35 or less, and particularly preferably 0.05 or more and 0.30 or less. Also in this manner, a resin with well-balanced refractive index, impact resistance, tintability, and heat resistance can be obtained.<br>
[0044]<br>
Here, there is a concern that the impact resistance of the resin<br>
.^teriorates when the value of p/ (p +r) is too small because the impact resistance improves as the amount of OH groups in the resin increases. The impact resistance of the resin can be improved by making p/ (p+r) to be 0.001 or larger, preferably 0.03 or larger, and more preferably 0.05 or larger.<br>
[0045]<br>
Meanwhile, there is a concern that the refractive index of the resin lowers when the amount of OH groups is too large with respect to that of SH groups. At this point of view, for an upper limit of the content of hydroxy groups, provided that the number of moles of a hydroxy group in the component (C) is p and the number of moles of a thiol group in the component (B) is r, p/(p+r) is in the range of usually 0.40 or smaller, preferably 0.35 or smaller, and more preferably 0.30 or smaller. Within such range, lowering of the refractive index of the resin can also be controlled. In this manner, for example, a polyurethane/thiourethane-based resin suitable for use as lenses such as spectacles lenses and the like, with high refractive index and low dispersion, can be obtained.<br>
[0046]<br>
The balance between the mechanical properties and refractive index can be further improved by making the molar ratio of the functional groups represented by NCO/ (SH+OH) to be in the above range and also by making p/(p+r) to be in the above range.<br>
[0047]<br>
From the viewpoints of economic efficiency and handleability, or optical properties of the resin to be obtained, a combination of (A) the polyisocyanate compound, (B) the polythiol compound<br>
optionally having at least one (poly) sulfide bond in a molecule, and<br>
(C)	the polyol compound having at least one ether bond and two or<br>
more hydroxy groups in a molecule is preferably the combination of:<br>
at least one kind selected from compounds represented by above Formula (1) and above Formula (2), dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate, and hexamethylene diisocyanate, as (A) the polyisocyanate compound,<br>
at least one kind selected from the group consisting of 4-mercaptomethyl-l,8-dimercapto-3, 6-dithiaoctane, 1,1,3,3-tetrakis(mercaptomethylthio)propane, 5,7-dimercaptomethyl-l,ll-dimercapto-3, 6, 9-trithiaundecane, 4,7-dimercaptomethyl-l,ll-dimercapto-3, 6, 9-trithiaundecane, and 4,8-dimercaptomethyl-l,ll-dimercapto-3,6, 9-trithiaundecane, as (B) the polythiol compound optionally having at least one (poly)sulfide bond in a molecule, and<br>
at least one kind selected from compounds represented by above<br>
(D)	, (E) , (F) , and (G) , as (C) the polyol compound having at least<br>
one ether bond and two or more hydroxy groups in a molecule.<br>
[0048]<br>
A combination of components (A) to (C) is more preferably the combination of:<br>
at least one kind selected from compounds represented by the above Formula (1) and/or Formula (2), as (A) the polyisocyanate compound,<br>
at least one kind selected from the group consisting of 4-mercaptomethyl-l,8-dimercapto-3,6-dithiaoctane, 5,7-dimercaptomethyl-l,ll-dimercapto-3, 6, 9-trithiaundecane, 4,7-dimercaptomethyl-l,ll-dimercapto-3, 6, 9-trithiaundecane, and<br>
8-dimercaptomethyl-l,ll-dimercapto-3,6,9-trithiaundecane, as (B) the polythiol compound optionally having at least one (poly)sulfide bond in a molecule, and<br>
at least one kind selected from compounds represented by the (D) , (E) , (F) , and (G) , as (C) the polyol compound having at least one ether bond and two or more hydroxy groups in a molecule.<br>
[0049]<br>
A combination of components (A) to (C) is most preferably the combination of:<br>
at least one kind selected from compounds represented by the above Formula (1), as (A) the polyisocyanate compound,<br>
at least one kind selected from the group consisting of 4-mercaptomethyl-l,8-dimercapto-3,6-dithiaoctane, 5,7-dimercaptomethyl-l,ll-dimercapto-3,6,9-trithiaundecane, 4,7-dimercaptomethyl-l,ll-dimercapto-3,6,9-trithiaundecane, and 4,8-dimercaptomethyl-l,ll-dimercapto-3,6,9-trithiaundecane, as (B) the polythiol compound optionally having at least one (poly)sulfide bond in a molecule, and<br>
at least one kind selected from the group consisting of diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, polyol having an average molecular weight of 200 or larger and 2,000 or smaller, which is obtained by reacting the compound represented by above Formula (3) with ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide, polyol having an average molecular weight of 180 or larger and 1,000 or smaller, which is obtained by reacting the compound represented by above Formula (4) with ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide, and polyol having an average molecular weight of 840 or larger and 1,530 or smaller, which<br>
is obtained by reacting sorbitol with propylene oxide, as (C) the polyol compound having at least one ether bond and two or more hydroxy groups in a molecule.<br>
[0050]<br>
The polyurethane/thiourethane-based resin of the invention is a copolymer of above components (A) to (C), and the resin includes a urethane bond formed by an isocyanate group and a hydroxy group, and a thiourethane bond formed by an isocyanate group and a thiol group.<br>
[0051]<br>
For some purposes, it may not be a problem for the resin of the invention to include bonds other than the urethane bond and the thiourethane bond, such as an allophanate bond, a urea bond, or a biuret bond, within the scope of not affecting the productivity by the monomer viscosity.<br>
[0052]<br>
For example, there are many cases where further subjecting a urethane bond or an S-alkyl thiocarbamic acid ester bond to a reaction with an isocyanate group to increase the cross-linkage density gives a favorable result. In this case, the reaction temperature is increased up to at least 100°C or higher and the isocyanate component is a lot used.<br>
[0053]<br>
Alternatively, some of amines or the like may be employed in combination, thereby allowing the employ of a urea bond or a biuret bond. In such a case of employing compounds other than polyol compounds, polythiol compounds, or thiol compounds each having a<br><br>
fydroxy group, which can react with an isocyanate compound, it is necessary to pay attention particularly to coloring.<br>
[0054]<br>
For the invention, as in a known molding process, a variety of additives may be added, if necessary, which are, for example, a chain extender, a crosslinking agent, a light stabilizer, an ultraviolet absorber, an antioxidant, dye, pigment, filler, and so on.  For the purpose of adjusting a reaction rate to a desired level, a suitable amount of S-alkyl thiocarbamic acid ester or a known reaction catalyst which is usable in the manufacture of polyurethane can be added.<br>
[0055]<br>
The polyurethane/thiourethane-based resin of the invention, for example, a polyurethane/thiourethane-based lenses can be usually obtained by casting polymerization. It is preferable that an internal mold release agent typified by phosphate esters is preliminarily added to the polymerizable composition for the invention, that is the composition including components (A) to (C) , or alternatively that the mold is preliminarily subjected to a treatment with an external mold release agent, so as to promote a mold release between the mold and the lens after completing the polymerization.<br>
[0056]<br>
Next, processes for producing the resin of the invention will be described in more detail.<br>
[0057]<br>
According to the invention, since the amount of heat generated<br>
blending is small when (C) the polyol compound having at least one ether bond and two or more hydroxy groups in a molecule is used, (A) the polyisocyanate compound, (B) the polythiol compound, and (C) the polyol compound having at least one ether bond and two or more hydroxy groups in a molecule may be added and mixed at once or may be added in any order to be mixed, upon the monomer blending.<br>
[0058]<br>
In addition, during the production of the resin related to the invention, there can be carried out a modification of resin such as for improving the heat resistance by: adding<br>
(C) at least one polyol compound having at least one ether bond and two or more hydroxy groups in a molecule to<br>
(A)	at least one polyisocyanate compound, and then further<br>
adding thereto<br>
(W) at least one compound selected from polyol compounds having two or more hydroxy groups but not having an ether bond in a molecule, and/or (poly)hydroxy(poly)mercapto compounds having at least one hydroxy group and at least one thiol group, and<br>
(B)	at least one polythiol compound optionally having at least<br>
one (poly)sulfide bond in a molecule.<br>
[0059]<br>
Among (W) polyol compounds having two or more hydroxy groups but not having an ether bond in a molecule, and/or (poly)hydroxy(poly)mercapto compounds having at least one hydroxy group and at least one thiol group, specific examples of the polyol compounds having two or more hydroxy groups but not having an ether bond in a molecule include glycerin, ethylene glycol, propylene<br><br>
n,lycol, butanediol such as 1, 4-butanediol, pentanediol, hexanediol, heptanediol, octanediol, nonanediol, and decanediol. Specific examples of the (poly)hydroxy(poly)mercapto compounds having at least one hydroxy group and at least one thiol group include 2-mercaptoethanol, thioglycerin, 1,4-dithioerythritol, 1,4-dithiothreitol and the like. However, the compounds are not limited by those. These may be used alone, respectively, or as a mixture of two or more kinds.<br>
[0060]<br>
Among these, those preferred are 2-mercaptoethanol, thioglycerin, glycerin, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,4-dithioerythritol, and 1,4-dithiothreitol, from the viewpoints of economic efficiency and handleability, or optical properties of the resin to be obtained. These may be used alone, respectively, or two or more kinds thereof may be mixed for a use.<br>
[0061]<br>
For the invention, in the case of employing (W) the polyol compounds having two or more hydroxy groups but not having an ether bond in a molecule, and/or the (poly) hydroxy (poly) mercapto compounds having at least one hydroxy group and at least one thiol group, in combination, it is preferably added in the presence of (C) the polyol compound having at least one ether bond and two or more hydroxy groups in a molecule, for the purpose of avoiding the runaway reaction or the like upon blending.<br>
[0062]<br>
In regard to the order of adding the catalyst and the mold release agent to be used, for example, there may be employed a method<br><br>
if preliminarily dissolving in a polyisocyanate compound, a polyol compound having at least one ether bond and two or more hydroxy groups, or a polythiol compound, or a method of adding to a mixture of those, but not limited by those exemplified methods and the order may be appropriately selected considering the handleability, safety, adequacy, and the like. For the form of the catalyst, mold release agent, and other additives, upon addition, they may be directly added as it is, or may be prepared into a master liquid by being dissolved in some of monomers used so as to be then added.<br>
[0063]<br>
The monomer mixed solution obtained in such manner may be subjected to degasification, if necessary, for the purpose of preventing the generation of bubbles upon forming the resin. Thereafter, the resultant is injected into a mold, subjected usually to polymerization under gradual heating from a low temperature to a high temperature, and then taken out from the mold.<br>
[0064]<br>
According to the invention, in regard to the production of the polyurethane/thiourethane-based resin, a polymerizable solution can be prepared without causing a large heat generation or an abrupt viscosity. Thus, it becomes possible, for example, to produce a homogeneous resin.<br>
[0065]<br>
In the production process of the invention, the total amount of (A) the polyisocyanate compound, (C) the polyol compound having at least one ether bond and two or more hydroxy groups in a molecule, and (B) the polythiol compound optionally having at least one<br><br>
 (poly)sulfide bond in a molecule, to be used may be, for example, 20 kg or more. According to the invention, a stable production of the resin even in a scale-up state becomes possible as polyol as the component (C) is employed.<br>
[0066]<br>
The polyurethane/thiourethane-based resin of the invention obtained in such manner has high refractive index and low dispersion property, and those also excellent in heat resistance, tintability, impact resistance, and the like can be obtained depending on the type of monomer used, thereby being ideal for use as a material for an optical component such as spectacle lenses and camera lenses.<br>
[0067]<br>
More specifically, since the polyurethane/thiourethane-based resin of the invention is colorless and transparent, and has excellent optical properties, the resin is ideal for use as an optical component or an optical element material such as lenses, for example, spectacle lenses or the like, prism, camera lens, optical fiber, information recording plate, filter, light-emitting diode and the like.<br>
[0068]<br>
The polyurethane/thiourethane lens obtained according to the invention can be tinted for a use. In this case, the lens can be tinted, for example, in accordance with the following generally known tinting methods. That is,<br>
(1)	a method of immersing a lens in a tinting liquid,<br>
(2)	a method of subjecting coating with the use of a coating agent<br>
containing a dye, or providing a tintable coating layer and tinting<br>
the provided coating layer,<br><br>
'3) a method of polymerizing monomer raw materials in which tintable materials are contained,<br>
(4) a method of heating a sublimation dye to allow sublimation, and the like.<br>
[0069]<br>
The polyurethane/thiourethane-based lens related to the invention may be used as having a coating layer on one side or both sides thereof, if necessary. As the coating layer, a primer layer, a hard coat layer, an antireflection film, an antifogging coat film, an antistaining layer, a water-repellent layer, or the like, can be exemplified. These coating layers can be used alone, respectively, or a plurality of coating layers can be formed into a multi-layer to be used.<br>
[0070]<br>
In addition, for those coating layers, there may be employed in combination an UV absorber for the purpose of protecting lenses or eyes from UV light, an IR absorber for the purpose of protecting eyes from infrared rays, a light stabilizer or antioxidant for the purpose of improving the weatherability of lenses, dye or pigment for the purpose of increasing fashionability of lenses, photochromic dye or photochromic pigment, an antistatic agent, and other known additives for improving the properties of lenses, respectively.<br>
[0071]<br>
The primer layer is a coating layer provided for the purpose of improving the adhesiveness between the hard coat layer formed thereon and lenses, and it may also improve the impact resistance. For the primer layer, any material can be used as long as it provides<br><br>
hdgh adhesivity to the obtained optical lens, and usually employed are a urethane-based resin, an epoxy-based resin, a polyester-based resin, a melanin-based resin, a primer composition mainly including polyvinylacetal, and the like. When forming the primer layer, a surface of the lens can be pre-treated by an alkali treatment, a plasma treatment, an ultraviolet treatment, or the like, if necessary, for the purpose of improving the adhesiveness.<br>
[0072]<br>
The hard coat layer is a coating layer provided for the purpose of giving functions such as an anti-scratching property, abrasion resistance, humidity resistance, hot-water resistance, heat resistance, and weather resistance, to the lens surface. For the hard coat layer, a hard coat composition including an organosilicon compound having curing property and particulate oxide of element selected from the group consisting of Si, Al, Sn, Sb, Ta, Ce, La, Fe, Zn, W, Zr, In, and Ti and/or at least one particulate constituted of a composite oxide of those elements, are generally used. The hard coat composition preferably includes at least any of amines, amino acids, metal acetylacetonate complex, organic acid metal salt, perchloric acids, salts of perchloric acids, acids, metal chloride, and polyfunctional epoxy compound, in addition to the above components. For the hard coat composition, a suitable solvent having no influence on the lens can be also used. Obviously, the use thereof with no solvent is also possible.<br>
[0073]<br>
The antireflection layer is usually formed on the above hard coat layer, if necessary. There are an inorganic type and an organic<br><br>
' ype for the antireflection layer, and the inorganic type is provided by the use of inorganic oxide such as Si02 and Ti02 in accordance with the dry method such as a vacuum evaporation technique, a sputtering method, an ion plating method, an ion beam assist method, and a CVD method. The organic type is provided by the use of a composition which includes an organosilicon compound and a silica particle having internal cavity, in accordance with the wet method.<br>
[0074]<br>
If necessary, an antifogging coat film, an anti-staining layer, and a water-repellent layer may be further formed on the antiref lection layer. As the means for forming the antifogging coat film, the anti-staining layer, and the water-repellent layer, methods and materials for the treatment thereof, or the like are not particularly limited as long as it is within the scope of not adversely affecting the antireflection properties, and there may be employed a generally known antifogging coat treatment method, anti-staining treatment method, water-repellent treatment method, and materials.<br>
[0075]<br>
In addition, the obtained polythiourethane-based lens may be tinted for a use with the use of a dye appropriate for the purpose so as to provide a fashionability or a photochromic property. Tinting of lens can be carried out in accordance with a generally known tinting method, and is carried out generally by the following methods: (1) a method of immersing a lens in a tinting liquid, (2) a method of subjecting coating with the use of a coating agent containing a dye, or providing a tintable coating layer and tinting the provided coating layer, (3) a method of polymerizing monomer raw materials in which<br><br>
intable materials are contained, (4) a method of heating a sublimation dye to allow sublimation, and the like.<br>
[0076]<br>
The method (1) is a method including immersing a lens material finished on a predetermined optical surface in a tinting liquid in which the dye to be used is dissolved or uniformly dispersed (tinting process), and immobilizing the dye by heating (annealing process after tinting) , if necessary. There are no particular limitations on the dye used in the tinting process as long as it is a generally known dye, but an oil-soluble dye or a disperse dye is usually used. The solvent used in the tinting process is not particularly limited as long as it is the solvent in which the dye to be used can be dissolved or uniformly dispersed therein. In the tinting process, a surfactant for dispersing the dye in a tinting liquid or a carrier which encourages tinting may also be employed, if necessary.<br>
[0077]<br>
The method (2) is not for directly tinting a plastic lens material, and it is the method either including a process of coating a plastic lens with an organic coating liquid in which a dye is dispersed or dissolved and subjecting to a curing treatment to form a tinted coating layer on a lens surface, or a process of forming a tintable coating layer on a plastic lens surface, immersing the plastic lens in a tinting liquid, and subjecting to heating to be tinted. The method (2) is a method including a process of immersing a plastic lens in a tinting liquid and subjecting to heating to be tinted.<br>
[0078]<br><br>
The method (3) is a method including preliminarily dissolving a dye in monomer raw materials for a plastic lens and thereafter carrying out a polymerization. The dye to be used is not particularly limited as long as it can be uniformly dissolved or dispersed to the extent of not deteriorating the optical properties, in monomer raw materials.<br>
[0079]<br>
As the method (4), there may be employed:<br>
(i) a method which includes sublimating a solid sublimation dye and tinting a plastic lens;<br>
(ii) a method which includes facing a plastic lens to a substrate to which a solution containing a sublimation dye is applied in a non-contacting manner, and heating the substrate and the lens to allow tinting; or<br>
(iii) a method which includes transferring a transfer layer composed of a colored layer containing a sublimation dye and an adhesive layer to a plastic lens, and thereafter heating to allow tinting. Optical lenses of the invention may be tinted in accordance with any of those methods. The dye to be used is not particularly limited as long as it is a dye having a sublimating property.<br>

Impact Resistance: Resins obtained in Examples 1, 2, 10, 17, and 20 were subjected to an impact resistance test. 50% nondestructive weight (g) was determined by dropping balls of light weighed to heavy weighed in order onto a lens having a center thickness of 1.0 mm, from a height of 127 cm in accordance with the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) test method. Here, the term "1,000 g or greater" in Table 2 shown later means that even 1,000 g weighed ball was dropped, all samples subjected were not cracked.<br>

From the above Table 1, it is understood that although (A) the polyisocyanate compound, (B) at least one polythiol compound optionally having at least one (poly) sulf ide bond in a molecule, and (C) at least one polyol compound having at least one ether bond and two or more hydroxy groups in a molecule are blended at once, or alternatively the component (B) is added after adding the component (C) to the component (A) , the heat generation is hardly caused as compared with Comparative Examples, and thus the temperature can be controlled more stably and also the low viscosity is obtained.<br>
[0126]<br>
Further, in accordance with above Examples, even in the case of blending monomers including a polyisocyanate compound, a polyol compound, and a polythiol compound, the blending manipulation can be carried out without causing abrupt heat generation and viscosity increase. In addition, it is realized that the resins prepared by blending monomers of Examples have high refractive index and low dispersion, thereby being able to be used as materials for spectacle lenses. As shown in Table 2, when measurements on the impact resistance were carried out in some Examples, all of 50% nondestructive weight thereof was 500 g or greater, exhibiting a sufficient impact resistance. Therefore, the production process is suitable for industrially producing a<br>
