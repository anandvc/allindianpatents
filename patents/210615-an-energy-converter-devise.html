COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (Section 10, Rule 13)<br>
AN ENERGY CONVERTER DEVISE"<br>
I, Udaysinh Shrikant Ghatge, 158, E-ward, Kadam Wadi KOLHAPUR 416 003. Maharashtra State, India An Indian national<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed: -<br><br>
AN ENERGY CONVERTER AND CHARGING DEVICE<br>
The present invention relates to a device which converts muscular energy into another useful form of energy, which can be used for charging. More particularly it relates to a device to be used in footwear that converts muscular energy into another useful form of energy.<br>
In prior art there are various forms of energy and there are different ways in which such energy is converted into other forms so as to be useful. Mostly electrical energy is produced by the conversion of other types of energies as electrical energy can be stored and transferred easily, speedily and accurately. First of such sources is thermal energy. Thermal energy produces steam from coal, petroleum or gases. Second important source is hydro electric power by which electrical energy is produced using potential and kinetic energy by means of Turbines and generator. Thirdly mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy by means of Engine and Generator. These are the important energy conversions for utility by some or the other means. Other forms include Wind power, Tidal power, Bio gas, Wave energy, Oceanic Thermal energy and Solar energy.<br>
There is no means for the conversion of muscular energy into electrical energy and hence there is no prior art. Thus the present invention entirely involves an inventive step to convert muscular energy into electrical energy.<br><br>
Muscular energy of any human being has not been brought in use in its right sense and hence the object of the present invention is to use the muscular energy to its optimum so as to benefit mankind and to initiate a step towards changes in the energy sector.<br>
The present invention aims at converting the muscular energy associated with the human body into useful form of energy. The present invention is a device to be placed in the footwear. When a human being walks with using such footwear, in which the said device is placed, the muscular energy is converted into electrical energy by means of the said device.<br><br>
The present invention therefore comprises of two levers with one of the levers at an angle of approximately 20° with respect to the sole of the shoe being supported by a bolt to retain its position at the said angle. The other lever is mounted on the first lever at an obtuse angle with respect to the said first lever as shown in the figures. A spring (not shown) is attached to the said other lever in order to bring it back to its original position after it pushes the main shaft gear. A plate is pivoted to the free end of the other lever and this plate moves in upward and downward direction and is connected to a main shaft gear. This main shaft gear is held in position by a locking disc, which is further connected to a train of gears, the said train of gears being connected to a motor which in turn is connected to a socket. This socket is provided for inserting a wire or plugging a wire of the mobile phone device for the purpose of charging. The aforesaid locking disc, train of gears and motor is enclosed in a box.<br>
The present invention, i.e. entire assembly is illustrated in figures I, II, III and IV.<br>

Working of the invention:<br>
This is electricity generating device, which converts muscular energy generated when an individual walks, into electrical energy. The working of the invention starts with the act of walking of an individual. As the individual walks, the act of walking exerts pressure on Lever 1 as shown in figure F-IV. The pressure is exerted by the toes of the foot on the Lever 1 at point Al as indicated in Fig IV. At this point the contact end of Lever 1 (Al) moves downward which in turns makes the other end of Lever 1 (Bl) to move in upward<br><br>
direction. The Lever 1 &amp; Lever 2 are placed in the device such that they are pivoted in the sole of the footwear as shown in Fig IV as denoted by numerals 12 &amp; 13. Whenever Al is made to move in downward direction, it causes the opposite end Bl to move in upward direction. Lever 2 stays in contact with Lever 1 at the point A2 as shown in Fig IV. Thus, when Bl is caused to move upward by the downward movement of A1, it also causes A2 to move in upward direction. Thus, when A2 moves in upward direction, it causes the opposite end B2 to move in downward direction. This downward movement of B2 causes the plate, which is connected to B2, to start moving in downward direction. This plate is attached to B2 in such manner, that the plate is pivoted so that it can move around the pivoted axis. This plate has two ends, CI &amp; C2, as shown in Fig II. C2 rests on main shaft gear as indicated in Fig II. As the plate moves down C2 end of the plate makes main shaft gear to rotate. This rotation also generates reverse rotation due to i spring connected to the Lever 2 and footwear at point 14 which causes generation of reverse rotation the main gear shaft. When an individual walks, the lifting of the leg takes the pressure off from the Levers 1 and Lever 2. However, due to spring action the Levers are position back to their starting stage to begin the entire process of action explained above. Thus, when the individual places his foot on the ground, once again the entire sequence of motion mentioned above takes place.<br>
As the end C2 moves down it rotates the main shaft gear but looses contact with the main shaft gear due to rotation of the main shaft gear and goes back to its normal pivoted position. This loosing contact and rotation, makes the main shaft gear to rotate only in one direction.   The main shaft gear is connected to locking disc. The function of the<br><br>
locking disc is to supports Gear 1 (gl) and main shaft gears mounted on lower sockets. Such gears gl, g2, g3 and g4 form a gear train (numeral 5) in Fig II. Gear 1 (gl) is connected to Gear 2 (g2) through inter-locking gear teeth. Gear 2 (g2 is in turn connected in similar fashion to Gear 3 (g3) and Gear 3 (g3) in turn is connected to Gear 4 (g4) in similar manner thus forming a train of gears. As soon as the main shaft gear rotates, it causes movement of gl which moves g2 due to inter-locking teeth as explained. G2 in return, moves g3 which causes g4 to move as well. This gear g4 is connected to gear motor (numeral 11) as shown in Fig II. Thus, when the entire gear train starts rotating in a fast manner, the gear train causes gear motor to start generating electrical energy due to the high r.p.m. (revolution per minute) rotation of the gear train. The output (numeral 10) as shown in Fig II provides electricity. This electricity then could be sourced by help of a pin to charge any electrical gadget.<br><br>
