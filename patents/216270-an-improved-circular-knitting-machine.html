				<td>IMPROVED STRUCTURE OF KNITTING MACHINE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved structure of knitting machine, particularly to a multi-function machine which is adapted from producing one kind of fabric to producing another kind of fabric such as single knit, plain terry, double knit, single jacquard, double jacquard.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
The conventional knitting machine can only use a kind of knitting method and produces a single type of fabric such as single knit, double knit, or jacquard. Although the configuration and structure of these machines have only a little bit difference, they can't be replaceable with each other and are not compatible. Thus a knitting factory needs to set various kind of machines with different functions in order to fit the needs of producing different kind of fabrics in order to meet different demands of clients and seasonal change. Due to the fashions and seasons change, the amount and sort of the fabrics always need to adjust by time, each kind of fabrics is not with the same production so that only some kind of machines are running day and night yet some sort of machines are lack of full use. Except the low efficiency of some kind of machines, knitting machines often occupies quite a lot of area for use in the factory.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, it is the primary object of the present invention to provide an improved knitting machine having interchangeable components such as upper and lower<br>
cylinder mechanisms, a dust cleaning system, and rings for fixing thread. By the design of the present invention, the components can be converted and replaced simply and conveniently in order to achieve the shift in functions and avoid the waste of cost of machines.<br>
According to the above object, the main components of the present invention include mechanical main body, cylinder mechanism, yarn feeders, and fabric winding system. The cylinders are mounted on the top of the base of the main body. The upper and lower cylinder mechanisms are driven by synchronous shafts. The yarn is transmitted from yarn feeders to cylinders and then knitted to clothes and wound by the fabric winding system. The apparatus is characterized in that upper and lower cylinder mechanisms are all interchangeable so that the upper cylinder can be replaced with radial dust cleaning system. In addition, an upper support rack and a set of rings for feeding thread can be mounted on the base. Therefore, the present invention has multi-functions, wherein the upper and lower cylinders can be adjusted or replaced, or added with optional elements such as an upper support rack, rings for feeding thread and radial dust cleaning system in order to convert the model of producing fabric from one to another.<br>
The foregoing object and advantages of the present invention will be more apparent from the following detailed description, as taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein;<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring to FIG1 &amp; 2, the present invention comprising a mechanical main body (1), cylinder mechanism (2), yam feeders (3), and fabric winding system (4). The cylinder mechanism (2) having upper (21) and lower (22) cylinder mechanism which are disposed at the top of the base 11 of the main body (1), whereon the lower cylinder mechanism (22) is fixed at the base (11) and the upper cylinder mechanism (21) is mounted on the main strut seat (12) which is above the base (11). The upper and lower cylinders are driven by respective synchronous shafts. The yarn from the yarn feeders (3) is knitted to clothe through cylinder mechanisms (2) and winded by the fabric winding system (4). The present invention is characterized in: referring to FIG.3, cylinder mechanisms (2) having moveable upper cylinder mechanism (21) and lower cylinder mechanism (22) while the upper cylinder mechanism (21) can be replaced by radar dust cleaning system (23). In addition, refer to FIG.5 the upper support rack (24) and rings for fixing thread (25) can be added on the base (11) of the main body (1). Therefore, the present invention with interchangeable upper and lower cylinder mechanisms (21) (22) and optional upper support rack (24), rings for fixing thread (25) and dust cleaning system (23) can enable the conversion of producing fabric from one pattern to another for meeting the increasing demand of the varieties of fabrics.<br>
Moreover, when the present invention converts the model from producing this fabric to another fabric, the bottom base (223) of the lower block ring (224) also needs to be replaced due to the different number of yarn feed and gauge, and then follows the above-mentioned steps for replacing other components.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the embodiment of the present invention for producing double knit fabric. A lower cylinder mechanism (22) is mounted on the base (11) of the main body (1) and the upper cylinder mechanism (21) suspended from main strut seat (12). A upper cylinder seat (211) is fixed on the central shaft of the upper cylinder mechanism (21) with the upper cylinder (212) therein. A circular seat (213) is disposed at the lower part of the main strut seat (12) with upper block ring (214) therein, located just above the upper cylinder (212). While the lower cylinder mechanism (22) having lower cylinder seat (221) with lower cylinder (222) therein fixed on the base (11) of the main body (1) and the lower block ring (224) mounted on the bottom seat (223). Upper block ring (214) and lower block ring (224) include a plurality of blocks with needle tracks therein so that the needles can transfer through the track when the upper (212) and lower cylinders (222) rotate.<br>
The above-mentioned upper block ring (214) and lower block ring (224) includes a plurality of blocks therein. As shown in FIG 4 &amp; 5, a plurality of screw holes (215 in FIG 4) (226 in FIGS ) are disposed at the circle of the circular seat (213) and bottom seat (223) while the blocks (214-1 in FIG 4) (224-1 in FIGS ) are secured thereon through screws (216 in FIG 4) (227 in FIGS ) inserting into the screw holes (215 in FIG 4) (226 in FIGS ). Moreover, the sinkers (217 in FIG 4) (228 in FIGS ) with needle track therein are also fixed onto the blocks of upper block ring (214-1) and the lower block ring(224-l) by screws and then form closed tracks for needles.<br>
As a double jacquard machine, referring to FIG 3 &amp; 6, the present invention only<br>
needs to replace the upper cylinder (212) and upper block ring (214) with the ones specific for jacquard and the pattern wheels (225) for jacquard are substituted for the lower block ring (224). Accordingly, the present invention shifts from producing double knit to producing double jacquard.<br>
Referring to FIG 3 &amp; 7, another embodiment of the present invention is to provide a knitting machine which is adapted to be converted from producing double knit fabric to producing single knit fabric. The upper cylinder seat (211) and the upper cylinder (212) are detached while upper block ring (214) is replaced by the dust cleaning system (23). By the way, the upper support rack (24) is arranged on the base (11) by the lower support arms (2 41), surrounding the lower cylinder mechanism (22). And a set of rings for fixing thread (25) are mounted on the upper support rack (24) by the upper support arms (251). The lower cylinder mechanism (22) is also adjusted to have lower cylinder (222) and the lower block ring (224) suitable for single knit.<br>
Please refer to FIG.7 &amp; 8, still another embodiment of the present invention as a single knit jacquard machine which converts from producing single knit fabric to producing single jacquard fabric. The upper support rack (24) and the rings for fixing thread (25) can be suspended by the winding machine (26), then detached the lower block ring (224) and replace needles in the lower cylinder (222). The blocks (224-1) of the lower block ring (224)is also replaced by the pattern wheels (225). At last, the upper support rack (24) and the rings for fixing thread (25) are turned in the original place.<br>
By the way, the embodiment of the present invention in FIG 7 for producing single knit fabric can be converted to produce plain terry fabric. The components, such as lower cylinder (222) and needles inside, lower block ring (224), upper support rack (24) and rings for fixing thread (25), need to be replaced with the ones specific for the plain terry.<br>
While a preferred embodiment of the invention has been shown and described in detail, it will be readily understood and appreciated that numerous omissions, changes and additions may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
