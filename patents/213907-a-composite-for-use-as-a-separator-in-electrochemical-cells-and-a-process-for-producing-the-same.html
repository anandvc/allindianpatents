The present invention relates to composites which are suitable in particular as separators for electrochemical cells, preferably rechargeable cells and in particular lithium batteries and lithium ion batteries, to these separators and, respectively, electrochemical cells per se, and also to a process for producing these composites.<br>
Electrochemical cells, in particular those which are rechargeable, are well known, for example from UUmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5  ed,. Vol. A3, VCH Veriagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim 1985, pages 343-397.<br>
Due to their high specific energy storage density, lithium batteries and lithium ion batteries occupy a particular position among these cells, especially as secondary cells.<br>
As described, inter alia, in the above extract from „Ullmann",such cells contain lithiated compound oxides of manganese, cobalt, vanadium or nickel. These may be described in the stoichiometrically simplest case as LiMn204, LiCo02, LiV205 or LiNi02.<br>
These compound oxides react reversibly with substances, such as graphite, which are capable of incorporating lithium ions into their lattice, the lithium ions being removed from the crystal lattice and the metal ions within this, such as manganese, cobalt or nickel ions, being oxidized. In an electrochemical cell this reaction can be used to store electrical energy by separating the compound accepting lithium ions, i.e. the anode material, from the lithium-containing compound oxide, i.e. the cathode material, by means of an electrolyte through which the lithium ions forming the compound oxide can migrate into the anode material (charging).<br><br>
The compoimds suitable for reversible storage of lithium ions are usually secured to collector electrodes by means of a binder.<br>
During charging of the cell, electrons flow through an external voltage source and lithium cations through the electrolyte toward the anode material. When the cell is used, the lithium cations flow through the electrolyte, whereas the electrons flow from the anode material to the cathode material through a load.<br>
In order to avoid a short circuit within the electrochemical cell, a layer which is electrically insulating but permeable to lithium cations is located between the two electrodes* This may be a so-called solid electrolyte or a conventional separator.<br>
As is well known solid electrolytes and separators are composed of a carrier material, incorporated into which are a dissociable compound which contains lithium cations and serves to increase lithium ion conductivity and also usually other additives, such as solvents.<br>
Microporous films have for some time been proposed as separators. For example, GB 2 027 637 describes a microporous film which comprises a matrix with from 40 to 90% by volume of a polyolefin and from 10 to 60% by volume of an inorganic filler and other constituents as respectively defined therein. The matrix described therein has 30 to 95% by volume of cavities, based on the volume of the film, and is a separator for lead accumulators.<br>
EP-B 0 715 364 describes a two^layer battery separator with shutdown characteristics. The battery separator described there has a first microporous membrane which has a shutdown fimction and has been produced from a material selected from the class consisting of polyethylene, a blend comprising essentially polyethylene and of a copolymer of polyethylene. The separator also has a second microporous membrane which has a strengthening fimction and has been produced from a material selected from the class consisting of polypropylene, of a blend which comprises essentially polypropylene and a copolymer of polypropylene. According to the description, this separator has better mechanical strength and transit energy than the prior art.<br><br>
EP-A 0 718 901 describes a three-layer battery separator with shutdown characteristics* This separator comprises a first and third microporous polypropylene membrane which in turn includes a microporous polyethylene membrane, where the first and third membrane has a greater puncture resistance and a higher melting point than the second membrane.<br>
EP-A-0 708 791 describes a composite polymer electrolyte in membrane form which has an ion-conducting polymer gel applied to a matrix material made from a porous polytetrafluoroethylene membrane.<br>
It is an object of the present invention, taking into account this prior art, to provide a separator which likewise has a shutdown mechanism and, furthermore, has dimensional stability at high temperature (&gt; 150°C) and fiirther unproved mechanical strength, and, furthermore, has excellent ion-conducting properties.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by means of a composite comprising at least a first layer which comprises a composition comprising<br>
(a)	from 1 to 99% by weight of a solid (I) with a primary particle size of from 5 nm to 100 (xm or a mixture made from at least two solids,<br>
(b)	from 99 to 1% by weight of a polymeric binder (II) which comprises:<br>
(Ila) from 1 to 100% by weight of a polymer or copolymer (Ila) which has, along the chain, terminally and/or laterally, reactive groups (RG) which are capable of crosslinking reactions when exposed to heat and/or UV radiation, and<br>
(lib) from 0 to 99% by weight of at least one polymer or copolymer (lib) which is free from reactive groups RG,<br>
where the at least one first layer has been applied to at least one second layer comprising at least one conventional separator.<br>
The composition present in the at least one first layer, and the preparation of the same, is now described in more detail below.<br><br>

Preferred solids I are hydrophobicized solids I, more preferably hydrophobicized compounds of the abovementioned type.<br>
Basic solids are particularly suitable here. For the purposes of the invention, basic solids are those whose mixture with a liquid, water-containing diluent which itself has a pH of not more than 7 has a higher pH than this diluent.<br>
The solids should advantageously be very substantially insoluble in the liquid used as electrolyte, and also be electrochemically inert in the battery medium.<br>
Suitable solids I are those which have a primary particle size of from 5 nm to 20 jun, preferably from 0.01 to 10 jim and in particular from 0.1 to 5 nm, the particle sizes given being determined by electron microscopy. The melting point of the pigments is preferably above the usual operating temperature of the electrochemical cell, and melting points of above 120°C, in particular above ISO^'C, have proven particularly advantageous.<br>
The pigments here may be symmetrical in their external shape, i.e. have a dimensional ratio of height to width to length (aspect ratio) of about 1 and be<br><br>
shaped as spheres or pellets, be approximately round in shape, or else be in the sh£^e of any desired polyhedron, such as a cuboid, tetrahedron, hexahedron, octahedron or bipyramid, or may be distorted or asymmetric, i.e. have a dimensional ratio of height to width to length (aspect ratio) which is not equal to 1 and be, for example, in the form of needles, asynmietrical tetraliedra, asymmetrical bipyramids, asymmetrical hexa- or octahedra, lamellae or plates, or of fiber-like shape. If the solids are asymmetric particles, the upper limit given above for the primary particle size refers to the smallest axis in each case.<br>
The composition used according to the invention comprises from 1 to 95% by weight, preferably from 15 to 90% by weight, more preferably from 25 to 85% by weight, in particular from 50 to 80% by weight, of a solid I, and from 5 to 99% by weight, preferably from 10 to 85% by weight, more preferably from 15 to 75% by weight, in particular from 20 to 50% by weight, of the polymeric binder IL<br>
This polymeric binder II comprises from 1 to 100% by weight of at least one polymer or copolymer Ila which has, along the chain, terminally and/or laterally, reactive groups (RG) which are capable of crosslinking reactions when exposed to heat and/or UV radiation, and from 0 to 99% by weight of at least one polymer or copolymer (lib) which is free from reactive groups RG.<br>
The polymers Ila used may in principle be any polymer crosslinkable on exposure to heat and/or high-energy radiation, preferably UV light, and having, along the chain, terminally and/or laterally, reactive groups (RG), preferably reactive groiups RGa or RGb, or RGa and RGb, through which the polymers can crosslink when activated by heat and/or radiation.<br>
The polymer Ila is more preferably a polymer which has, along the chain, terminally and/or laterally, at least one group RGb different from RGa and coreactive with RGa, where on average across all of the polymer molecules there is at least one RGa and at least one group RGb.<br>
The polymer Ila may, fiirthermore, be formed from a mixture of two or more polymers of which a portion has only RGa and another portion has only RGb.<br><br>
The polymer Ila may, furthermore, be formed from a mixture of two or more polymers of which a portion has only RGa and another portion has only RGb and of other polymers which have both RGA and RGb.<br>
The polymer Ila is generally formed from one coherent class of polymers, preferably from the polyacrylates class. However, blends of various polymer classes are also possible.<br>
The polymer Ila may comprise either polymers or oligomeric substances, or also mixtures of polymers and oligomeric substances.<br>
The oligomeric and/or polymeric fimdamental structure of the polymers Ila may comprise known polymers built up, for example, via -C-C- linkages, which may also have double and/or triple bonds, or also via ether, ester, urethane, amide, imide, imidazole, ketone, sulfide, sulfone, acetal, urea, carbonate or siloxane linkages*<br>
The oligomeric or polymeric fundamental structure may also be linear, branched-chain, ring-shaped or of dendrimer type.<br>
The polymers Ila used according to the invention may be obtained by polymerization, polyaddition or polycondensation of monomeric building blocks which, besides the groups through which the polymer is built up, also have RGa and/or RGb, so that according to the invention fimctionalized polymers Ila are formed straightaway during the preparation of the polymer.<br>
The polymers Ila according to the invention may, furthermore, be obtained by polymer-analogous reaction of functional polymers with compounds which have RGa and/or RGb and at least one other group which can react with the functional groups of the oligomeric or polymeric fundamental structure.<br>
It is also possible for one of the functional groups RGa and/or RGb to be incorporated straightaway during the preparation of the polymer, and then for the other RG to be introduced into the finished polymer by polymer-analogous functionalization.<br><br>
Groups RGa are groups having structures which are capable of hydrogen abstraction when exposed to high-energy radiation, preferably UV radiation, in the triplet excited state (Norrish Il-type photoinitiator groups known from the literature). Structures of this type are known to the skilled worker from photochemistry. The literature also lists the appropriate acrylate (derivative) compounds which have structures of this type. Further details concerning these compounds can be found in US 5 558 911, the full scope of the disclosure of which in this connection is incorporated into this application. According to the invention it is, of course, also possible to use other monomers, oligomers or polymers which have structures RGa of this type.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

The concomitant use of RGa acrylates of this type makes it readily possible, for example by copolymerization with other acrylates, to obtain acrylate copolymers functionalized with RGa in a manner according to the invention.<br>
Base polymers having, for example, amino groups but without RGa groups may also readily be ftmctionalized with RGa by Michael addition of RGa acrylates of this type.<br>
Benzophenone groups are preferred as RGa, In the case of polyacrylates, particularly high UV reactivity is achieved with benzophenone derivatives in which the benzophenone group has been bonded to the main f)olymer chain via a<br><br>
spacer group. Particularly preferred polyacrylates are obtainable by copolymerizing with acrylates of the formulae 24 to 26 and 34.<br>
Another cost-effective and preferred way of introducing RGa into polymers is the reaction of hydroxybenzophenones, preferably 4-hydroxybenzophenone, with the epoxy groups of a polymer, preferably the addition of 4-hydroxybenzophenone to polyacrylates having glycidyl (meth)acrylate content. Another elegant method is the reaction of an adduct made from one mole of diisocyanate and one mole of 4-hydroxybenzophenone with a polymer having free hydroxyl groups.<br>
A preferred method of introducing RGa into polyesters is the concomitant use of benzophenonecarboxylic acids or, respectively, of benzophenonecarboxylic anhydrides during the polycondensation, or the reaction or, respectively, esterification of polymers having hydroxyl groups, epoxy groups, isocyanate groups and/or amino groups with benzophenonecarboxylic acids or, respectively, benzophenonecarboxylic anhydrides.<br>
Groups RGb are groups which can interact with excited Norrish II photoinitiator groups. A particular interaction of this type known to the skilled worker is hydrogen transfer to the Norrish II structure, resulting in formation of free radicals both on the H donor and on the abstracting Norrish II structure. Direct crosslinking of the polymers is possible via free-radical combination. It is also possible for the photochemically produced free radicals to initiate a free-radical-initiated polymerization of, for example, polymerizable functional groups RGb, e.g. maleate, fiimarate, (meth)acrylate, allyl, epoxy, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, vinyl ether, vinyl ester, vinylaryl or cirmamate groups.<br>
Preferred RGb interact as H donors with RGa systems, i.e. are free from double bonds. An advantage inherent in such systems is their low sensitivity to interference since, compared with unsaturated UV systems, they have less reactivity toward the other constituents of the overall mix. This does not, of course, rule out the (concomitant) use of unsaturated substances, and this is a task for optimization in individual cases. H-donor groups are known to the skilled worker in photochemistry. They are in principle groups which have hydrogen having a low<br><br>
bond energy, in particular groups having hydrogen atoms with a bond energy of less than 397 kJ/mol.<br>
Data on bonding energy are known from the literature and can be found, for example, in Morrison, Robert Thornton, Organic Chemistry, Table : Homoiytic Bond Dissociation Energies on the mside of the jacket, in Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data ISBNO-205^08453-2, 1987, by Allyn and Bacon, Inc. A Division of Simon &amp; Schuster, Newton, Massachusetts, USA.<br>

These half esters are obtainable in a smooth reaction from maleic anhydride (MA), water and dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) or, respectively, by direct addition of DCPD to MA. It is also possible to carry out direct addition of DCPD to other acids and/or acid polyesters.

Also of interest is the introduction of endomethylenetetrahydrophthalic acid structures and tetrahydrophthalic acid structures via the imides of these acids using hydroxyalkylamines, as disclosed, for example, in DE-A-15700273 or DE-A-17200323.<br>
The oligomeric and/or polymeric fundamental structure of the polymers Ila may comprise known polymers built up, for example, via -C-C- linkages, which may<br><br>
also have double and/or triple bonds, or also via ether, ester, urethane, amide, imide, imidazole, ketone, sulfide, sulfone, acetal, urea, carbonate or siloxane linkages, subject to the fimctionalizations more closely defined above.<br>
Preference is given to polyesters, polyethers, polyurethanes and, particularly preferably, polyacrylates.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, polyesters are saturated and unsaturated polyester resins.<br>
The polyester resins here may be built up using the usual and known carboxylic acids having &amp; 2 carboxyl groups and/or anhydrides of these and/or esters of these and hydroxyl compounds having ^ 2 OH groups. Concomitant use of monofiinctional compounds is also possible, for example to regulate the molecular weight of the polycondensates.<br>
Examples of possible carboxylic acid components are a,P-ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids, such as maleic acid, maleic anhydride, fumaric acid, itaconic acid and citraconic acid, saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids or, respectively, anhydrides of these, such as succinic acid, adipic acid, suberic acid, sebacic acid and azelaic acid, naturally occurring fatty acids and polymerized naturally occuring fatty acids, such as linseed oil fatty acid, dimeric and polymeric linseed oil fatty acid, castor oil and castor oil fatty acid, saturated cycloaliphatic carboxylic acids or, respectively, anhydrides of these, such as tetrahydrophthalic acid, hexahydrophthalic acid, endomethylenetetrahydrophthalic acid and norbomenedicarboxylic acid, aromatic carboxylic acids or, respectively, anhydrides of these, such as the isomeric forms of phthalic acid, and also tri- and tetracarboxylic acids or, respectively, anhydrides of these, such as trimellitic acid and pyromellitic acid, and polycarboxylic acids partially esterified with allyl alcohol, e.g. monoallyi trimeliitate or diallyl pyromellitate, and particular importance is placed on benzophenonecarboxylic acids, since these copolymers allow the incorporation of structures which can be excited by UV light.<br>
Examples of possible hydroxyl components are at least dihydric, if desired alkoxylated, aliphatic and/or cycloaliphatic alcohols, such as ethylene glycol.<br><br>
propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, butanediol isomers, hexanediol, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, neopentyl glycol, cyclohexanedimethanol, bisphenol A and hydrogenated bisphenol A, OH-polyfimctional polymers, such as polybutadienes modified with hydroxyl groups or polyurethane prepolymers having hydroxyl groups, glycerol, mono- and diglycerides of saturated or unsaturated fatty acids, in particular monoglycerides of linseed oil or sunflower oil. Other possible compounds are unsaturated alcohols, such as polyfimctional hydroxyl compounds (partially) etherified with allyl alcohol, e.g. trimethylolethane monoallyl ether, trimethylolethane diallyl ether, trimethylolpropane monoallyl ether, trimethylolpropane diallyl ether, pentaerythritol monoallyl ether, pentaerythritol diallyl ether, 2-butene-l,4-dioi and alkoxylated 2-butene-l,4-diol.<br>
If monofunctional substances are used to regulate the molecular weight, these are preferably monofunctional alcohols, such as ethanol, propanol, butanol, hexanol, decanol, isodecanol, cyclohexanol, benzyl alcohol or allyl alcohol. For the purposes of the present invention the term polyester also comprises polycondensates which have, besides the ester groups, amide groups and/or imide groups, as obtained by concomitant use of amino compounds. Polyesters modified in this way are known, for example, from DE-A-15700273 and DE-A-17200323. Introduction of endomethylene-tetrahydrophthalic acid structures and of tetrahydrophthalic acid structures via the imides of these acids with hydroxyalkylamines as are mentioned there implies that these are groups RGb for the purposes of the present invention.<br>
It is also possible to carry out addition of DCPD to the double bonds of the unsaturated polyesters used, allowing the incorporation of endomethylene-tetrahydrophthalic acid structures which are RGb for the purposes of this invention. These endomethylenetetrahydrophthalic acid structures may have locations at the double bonds of the polyester along the chain and/or at terminal double bonds, for example those introduced via substances of formula 3. The double bonds of the unsaturated dicarboxylic acids and/or of unsaturated diols are RGb along the chain for the purposes of the invention. The RGs may be introduced by cocondensation and/or by polymer-analogous reactions on polyesters having functional groups. Examples of cocondensations are the concomitant use of<br><br>
trimethylolpropane di- and monoallyl ethers, pentaerythritol di- and monoallyl ethers, 2-butene-1,4-diol, alkoxylated 2-butene-1,4-diol, allyl alcohol and compounds of formulae 3,4, 5, 7 and 8.<br>
A preferred way of introducing RGa is the cocondensation of benzophenonecarboxylic acids or anhydrides of these. Further preference is given to the addition of the reaction products of hydroxy-benzophenones with an excess of diisocyanates to hydroxy-functional polyesters.<br>
RGb can also be introduced into hydroxy-fimctional polyesters in this way. For this, diisocyanates having isocyanate groups of differing reactivity, e.g. isophorone diisocyanate or tolylene 1,4-diisocyanate, are preferably first reacted with half the stoichiometric amount of, for example, hydroxyacrylates, hydroxyvinyl ethers, hydroxyallyl esters, hydroxyallyl ethers or hydroxy-DCPD compounds of formulae AGb4 and AGb6, and these reaction products are then reacted with the hydroxy-functional polyesters. It is also possible for hydroxy-functional substances of different types to be used simultaneously in the reactions mentioned.<br>
Poly(meth)acrylate resins functionalized with RG according to the invention are another important class of polymers according to the invention and are obtained by copolymerizing acrylates, if desired vsdth other copolymerizable compounds.<br>
The poly(meth)acrylate resins according to the invention may, however, also be prepared in solvents. Another advantageous method of preparing poly(meth)-acrylates is solvent-free, free-radical bulk polymerization in a stirred reactor, if desired at superatmospheric pressure, or in continuous reactors at temperatures above the melting point of the polymers fomied.<br>
Examples of components suitable for building poly(meth)acrylate resins are known acrylates and methacrylates with aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, araliphatic or aromatic alcohols having from 1 to 40 carbon atoms, e.g. methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, propyl (meth)acrylate, isopropyl (meth)acrylate, n-butyl (meth)acrylate, isobutyl (meth)acrylate, tert-butyl (meth)acrylate, amyl (meth)acrylate, isoamyl (meth)acrylate, hexyl (meth)acrylate, 2-ethyIhexyl (meth)acrylate,    decyl     (meth)acrylate,    undecyl    (meth)acrylate,    dodecyl<br><br>
(meth)acrylate, tridecyl (meth)acrylate, cyclohexyl (mcth)acrylate, methylcyclohexyl (meth)acrylate, benzyl (meth)acrylate, tetrahydrofurfuryl (meth)acrylate and furfiiryl (meth)acrylate, and the esters of 3-phenylacrylic acid and various isomeric forms thereof, for example methyl cinnamate, ethyl cinnamate, butyl cinnamate, benzyl cinnamate, cyclohexyl cinnamate, isoamyl cinnamate, tetrahydrofiirfiiryl cinnamate and furfuryl cinnamate, acrylamide, methacrylamide, methylolacrylamide, methylolmethacrylamide, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, 3-phenylacrylic acid, hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates, such as ethylene glycol mono(meth)acrylate, butylene glycol mono(meth)acrylates and hexanediol mono(meth)acrylate, glycol ether (meth)acrylates, such as methoxyethylene glycol mono(meth)acrylate, ethyloxyethylene glycol mono-(meth)acrylate, butyloxyethylene glycol mono(meth)-acrylate and phenyloxyethylene glycol mono(meth)-acrylate, glycidyl acrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, and amino (meth)acrylates, such as 2-aminoethyl(meth)-acrylate.<br>
Other possible components are monomers capable of free-radical copolymerization, for example styrene, 1-methylstyrene, 4-tert*butylstyrene, 2-chlorostyrene, vinyl esters of fatty acids having 2 to 20 carbon atoms, for example vinyl acetate and vinyl propionate, vinyl ethers of alkanols having from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, such as vinyl isobutyl ether, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, vinyl alkyl ketones, dienes, such as butadiene and isoprene, and also esters of maleic acid and of crotonic acid. Other suitable monomers are cyclic vinyl compounds, such as vinylpyridine, 2-methyl-l-vinyIimidazole, 1-vinylimidazole, S-vinylpyrrolidone and N-vinylpyrrolidone, It is also possible to use allylically unsaturated monomers, such as allyl alcohol, allyl alkyl esters, monoallyl phthalate and allyl phthalate. Acrolein and methacrolein and polymerizable isocyanates may also be used.<br>
The RGs may be incorporated by copolymerization during the preparation of the polyacrylates or by subsequent polymer-analogous reaction. Examples of compounds which polymerize well and have groups RGb are dihydrodicyclopentadienyl (meth)acrylate, dihydrodicyclopentadienyl ethacrylate and dihydrodicyclopentadienyl cinnamate. Examples of compounds which polymerize well and have other groups at which a polymer^analogous functionalization is possible are copolymerizable epoxy compounds, such as<br><br>
glycidyl (meth)acrylate or hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates. The hydroxy! groups and/or epoxy groups incorporated in this way are anchor groups for polymer-analogous fimctionalization reactions of the polymers, Epoxy groups are, for example, suitable for introducing acrylic double bonds by reacting with (meth)acrylic acid (RGb) and/or for mtroducing vinyl ether groups (RGb) by reacting with aminovinyl ether compounds, such as diethanolamine divinyl ether, or for introducing benzophenone groups (RGa) by reacting with hydroxy- and/or aminobenzophenones.<br>
Polyurethanes fimctionalized according to the invention with RG are another important class of polymers according to the invention and are obtained in a manner known to the skilled worker from polyfimctional, mostly bifimctional, isocyanates and polyhydroxy and/or polyamino compounds. It is also possible here to include incorporation of RGa and/or RGb directly during the build-up of the polyurethanes, or to introduce them subsequently into functional polyurethanes. The chemical reaction partners for this are essentially the same as for the polymers described above, RGa are preferably introduced via concomitant use of functional benzophenone compounds, and RGb via hydroxy-DCPD compounds of formulae RGb4 and RGb6,<br>
Further details concerning the base polyurethane structures which can be used can be found in the corresponding discussion of the polyurethanes which can be used as polymer lib.<br>
Polymer Ila according to the invention is prepared following well known principles and aspects of its preparation, such as the setting of the desired molecular weight by concomitant use of regulating or monofunctional starting materials, or the setting of a desired glass transition temperature by balancing hard and soft components, are known to the skilled worker.<br>

The polymers Ila used may also be the polymers and copolymers discussed below under "polymers lib", as long as these are provided with reactive groups RG, in particular RGa and/or RGb. Particular mention should be made here of polymers and copolymers of halogen-containing olefinic compounds (class 4f) provided with reactive groups RG.<br>
The polymers Ila used according to the invention are preferably crosslmked by high-energy radiation, in particular by UV light. In most cases no other photoinitiator need be added here, i.e, the substances photocrosslink by themselves, and a particular advantage is their low level of air-inhibition. However, the addition of other commercially available photoinitiators is not ruled out. Many polymers Ila can also be crosslinked thermally. Unsaturated systems which also have DCPD groups have particularly high thermal crosslinkability in the presence of peroxides and/or of C-C-labile substances of benzpinacol type. Some systems of this type can also be cured thermally without peroxides. A preferred rapid crosslinking is achieved by combined use of heat and UV light, e.g. by combining IR and UV sources.<br>
The polymers lib used may comprise thermoplastic and ion-conducting polymers. Those to be mentioned in particular are:<br>
1)	Polycarbonates, e.g. polyethylene carbonate, polypropylene carbonate, polybutadiene carbonate and polyvinylidene carbonate.<br>

aliphatic non-cyclic diisocyanates, e.g. hexamethylene 1,5-<br>
diisocyanate and hexamethylene 1,6-diisocyanate, aliphatic cyclic<br>
diisocyanates,	e.g,	cyclohexylene	1,4-diisocyanate,<br>
dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate and isophorone diisocyanate, or aromatic diisocyanates, e.g. tolylene 2,4-diisocyanate, tolylene 2,6-diisocyanate, tetramethylxylene m-diisocyanate, tetra-methylxylene p-diisocyanate, tetrahydro-naphthylene 1,5-diisocyanate and diphenylene-methane 4,4'-diisocyanate, or mixtures of compounds of this type.<br>
with<br>
b)        polyhydric alcohols, e.g. polyesterols, polyetherols and diols.<br>
The polyesterols are advantageously predominantly linear polymers having terminal OH groups, preferably those having two or three, in particular two, terminal OH groups. The acid number of the, polyesterols is less than 10 and preferably less than 3. The polyesterols may be prepared in a simple manner by esterifying aliphatic or aromatic dicarboxylic acids having from 4 to 15 carbon atoms, preferably from 4 to 6 carbon atoms, with glycols, preferably glycols having from 2 to 25 carbon atoms, or by polymerizing lactones having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms. Examples of dicarboxylic acids which may be used are glutaric acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, sebactc acid, dodecanoic acid and preferably adipic acid and succinic acid. Suitable aromatic dicarboxylic acids are terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, phthalic acid or mixtures of these dicarboxylic acids with other dicarboxylic acids, e.g. diphenic acid, sebacic acid, succinic acid and adipic acid. The dicarboxylic acids may be used individually or as mixtures. To prepare the polyesterols it may on occasions be advantageous to use, instead of the dicarboxylic acids, the corresponding acid derivatives, such as carboxylic anhydrides or carboxylic chlorides. Examples of suitable glycols are diethylene glycol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,10-decanediol and 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,5-pentanediol. Preference is given to the use of 1,2-ethanediol, 1,3-propanediol,   2-methyl-1,3-propanediol,   1,4-butanediol,   1,6-hexanediol,<br><br>
2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol, 1,4-dmiethylolcyclohexane, 1,4-diethanol-cyclohexane and ethoxylated or propoxylated products of 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenylene)propane (bisphenol A). Depending on the properties desired in the polyurethanes, the polyols may be used alone or as a mixture in various quantity ratios. Examples of suitable lactones for preparing the polyesterols are a,a-dimethyl-p-propiolactone, Y'^^^^yrolactone and preferably e-caprolactone.<br>
The polyetherols are essentially linear substances having terminal hydroxyl groups and containing ether bonds. Suitable polyetherols may readily be prepared by polymerizing cyclic ether, such as tetrahydrofuran, or by reacting one or more alkylene oxides having from 2 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkylene radical with a starter molecule which contains, bonded within the alkylene radical, two active hydrogen atoms. Examples of alkylene oxides are ethylene oxide, propylene 1,2-oxide, epichlorohydrin, butylene 1,2-oxide and butylene 2,3-oxide. The alkylene oxides may be used individually, alternating in succession or as a mixture. Examples of starter molecules used are water, glycols, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol and 1,6-hexanediol, amines, such as ethylenediamine, hexamethylenediamine and 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl-methane, and amino alcohols, such as ethanolamine. Suitable polyesterols and polyetherols, and also the prepamtion of these, are described, for example, in EP-B 416 386, and suitable polycarbonatediols, preferably those based on 1,6-hexanediol, and also the preparation of these, is described, for example, in US-A 4 131 731,<br>
Amounts of up to 30% by weight, based on the total weight of the alcohols, of aliphatic diols having from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably 2 to 10 carbon atoms can advantageously be used, for example 1,2-ethanediol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,10-decanediol, 2-methyl-I,3-propanediol, 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propane- diol, 2-methy 1-2-buty I-1,3 -propanediol, 2,2-dimethyl-1,4-butanediol, 1,4-dimethylolcyclohexane, neopentyl glycol hydroxypivalate, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol or methyldiethanolamine, or aromatic-aliphatic or aromatic-cycloaliphatic diols having from 8 to 30 carbon atoms, where<br><br>
possible aromatic structures are heterocyclic ring systems or preferably isocyclic ring systems, such as naphthalene derivatives or in particular benzene derivatives, such as bisphenol A, doubly symmetrically ethoxylated bisphenol A, doubly symmetrically propoxylated bisphenol A, more highly ethoxylated or propoxylated bisphenol A derivatives or bisphenol F derivatives, or also mixtures of compounds of this type.<br>
Amoimts of up to 5% by weight, based on the total weight of the alcohols, of aliphatic triols having from 3 to 15 carbon atoms, preferably from 3 to 10 carbon atoms may advantageously be used, for example trimethylolpropane or glycerol, the reaction product of compounds of this type with ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide, or also mixtures of compoimds of this type.<br>
The polyhydric alcohols may have fimctional groups, for example neutral groups, such as siloxane groups, basic groups, such as in particular tertiary amino groups, or acid groups, or salts thereof, or groups which readily convert into acid groups, which are introduced via a polyhydric alcohol Use may advantageously be made of diol components which have groups of this type, for example N-methyldiethanolamine, diethyl N,N-bis(hydroxyethyl)aminomethylphosphonate or 3-sulfopropyl N,N-bis(hydroxyethyl)*2-aminoacetate, or dicarboxylic acids which have groups of this type and can be used for preparing polyesterols, for example 5-sulfoisophthalic acid.<br>
Acid groups are in particular the phosphoric acid, phosphonic acid, sulfuric acid, sulfonic acid, carboxyl or ammonium group.<br>
Examples of groups A^^ch readily develop into acid groups are the ester group or salts, preferably of the alkali metals, such as lithium, sodium or potassium.<br>
4) The polyesterols described above per se, where care should be given to obtaining molecular weights of from 10,000 to 2,000,000, preferably from 50,000 to 1,000,000,<br><br>

6)	Polyetherols, as described, for example, in the discussion above of the polymer lib 1, as compound (c), or in the discussion of the polyurethanes.<br>
It is, of course, also possible to use mixtures of the above polymers lib. The copolymers lib used according to the invention may, depending on the maimer of preparation, contain a random distribution of the monomers, or may be block copolymers.<br>
The polymers Ila and lib are polymerized in a conventional manner known to the skilled worker, preferably free-radical polymerization. The polymers Ila and lib may be used in high-molecular-weight or oligomeric form or as mixtures of these.<br>
The proportion of the polymer Ila in the polymeric binder II is generally from 1 to 100% by weight, preferably from 20 to 80% by weight, more preferably from 30 to 60% by weight. The proportion of the polymer lib to the polymeric binder II is correspondingly generally from 0 to 99% by weight, preferably from 20 to 80% by weight and more preferably from 40 to 70% by weight.<br>
The present invention preferably prx)vides composites witii a first layer which comprises the following composition:<br>

The compositions used according to the invention may moreover comprise a plasticizer III, However, a plasticizer need not be used,<br>
The proportion of the plasticizer III, if used, based on the composition, is from 0.1 to 100% by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 50% by weight and in particular from 1 to 20% by weight.<br>
Examples of plasticizers III are those described in DE-A 198 19 752, preferably dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate, dipropyl carbonate, ethylene carbonate, propylene 1,2-carbonate, propylene 1,3-carbonate, organic phosphorus compounds, in particular phosphates and phosphonates, e.g. trimethyl phosphate, triethyl phosphate, tripropyl phosphate, tributyl phosphate, tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate, polyalkylene oxide ethers and polyalkylene oxide esters, e.g. diglyme compoxmds, triglyme compounds and tetraglyme compounds, polymeric plasticizers, e.g. themioplastic polyurethanes or polyamides, and also mixtures of these.<br>
The compositions used according to the invention may be dispersed or dissolved in an inorganic or organic, preferably an organic liquid diluent, in which the mixture according to the invention should have a viscosity of preferably from 100 to<br><br>
50,000 mPas, and then be applied to a substrate in a manner known per se, for example spray coating, casting, dipping, spin coating, roller coating, relief printing, gravure printing or planography or screen printing. Further processing may proceed as usual, e,g. by removing the diluent and curing the mixture.<br>
Suitable organic diluents are aliphatic ethers, in particular tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, hydrocarbons, in particular hydrocarbon mixtures, such as petroleum spirit, toluene or xylene, aliphatic esters, in particular ethyl acetate and butyl acetate, and ketones, in particular acetone, ethyl methyl ketone and cyclohexane, and also DMF and NMP. It is also possible to use combinations of diluents of this type.<br>
Possible substrates are the materials usually used for electrodes, preferably metals, such as aluminum or copper. It is also possible to use temporary substrates, such as films, in particular polyester films, such as polyethylene terephthalate films. Films of this type may advantageously have a release layer, preferably made from polysiloxanes.<br>
The separators may also be produced thermoplastically, for example by injection molding, melt casting, compression, kneading or extruding, and if desired the composition used according to the invention may be calendered in a subsequent step,<br>
Afier the film has been formed from the composition used according to the invention, volatile components, such as solvents or plasticizers, may be removed.<br>
The composition used according to the invention may be crosslinked in a manner known per se, for example by irradiating with ionic or ionizing radiation, or an electron beam, preferably with an acceleration voltage of from 20 to 2000 kV and a radiation dose of fi^m 5 to 50 Mrad, or with UV or visible light, advantageously adding, m the usual manner, an initiator such as benzil dimethyl ketal or 1,3,5-trimethylbenzoyltriphenylphosphine oxide in amounts of in particular not more than 1% by weight, based on the polymer Ila, and crosslinking generally within a period of from 0.5 to 15 minutes; by thermal crosslinking via fi^e-radical polymerization, preferably at above 60*^C, where an initiator may advantageously<br><br>
be added, for example azobisisobutyronitrile in amounts of generally not more than 5% by weight, preferably from 0,05 to 1% by weight, based on the polymer Ila; by electrochemically induced polymerization; or by ionic polymerization, for example by acid-catalyzed cationic polymerization, where possible catalysts are primarily acids, preferably Lewis acids, such as BF3, or in particular LiBF4 or LiPFe. Catalysts containing lithium ions, such as LiBF4 or LiPFe may advantageously remain here in the solid electrolyte or separator as conducting salt.<br>
The crosslinking described above may, but need not, take place under an mert gas. The irradiation time here may according to the invention be controlled so that either complete crosslinking takes place or there is merely a short period of UV-light preirradiation to give only partial crosslinking.<br>
As mentioned at the outset, the at least one second layer of the molding according to the invention comprises a conventional separator. According to the invention any conventional separator may be used here.<br>
The following should be mentioned in particular in this connection:<br>
separators based on microporous polyolefin films, as commercially available, for example, with the tradenames Celgard^ and Hipore® and described, inter alia, in EP-A 0 718 901 and EP^B 0 715 364, the entire scope of both of which is incorporated into the present application by way of reference; polyethylene films and polypropylene films, and also films which comprise blends of polyethylene and, respectively, polypropylene with other polymers are similarly useful here;<br>
microporous pol3^etrafluoroethylene (PTFE) films from Goretex, as described, for example, in EP-A 0 798 791, which is also incorporated into the present application by way of reference;<br>
webs, fibers, and also nonwovens, all of which can be produced using fibrous polymer materials, e,g, polyolefin, polyamide or polyester fibers; films available with the tradename Nafion®;<br>
films based on a copolymer of vinylidene difluoride and hexafluoropropene, as described, for example, in US 5 540 741 and US 5 478 668;<br><br>
homopolymers, block polymers and copolymers which in each case contain filler and can be obtained by extrusion, prepared from<br>
(a)	olefinic hydrocarbons, e.g. ethylene, propylene, butylene, isobutene, propene, hexene or higher homologs, butadiene, cyclopentene, cyclohexene, norbomene or vinylcyclohexane;<br>
(b)	aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. styrene or methylstyrene;<br>
(c)	acrylates or methacrylates, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, hexyl, octyl, decyl, dodecyl, 2-ethyIhexyl, cyclohexyl, benzyl, trifluoromethyl, hexafluoropropyl or tetrafluoropropyl acrylate and, respectively, methacrylate;<br>
(d)	acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, N-methylpyrrolidone, N-vinylimidazole or vinyl acetate;<br>
(e)	vinyl ethers, e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, hexyl, octyl, decyl, dodecyl, 2-ethylhexyl, cyclohexyl, benzyl, trifluoromethyl, hexafluoropropyl or tetrafluoropropyl vinyl ether;<br>
(f)	halogen-containing olefinic compounds, such as vinyl chloride, vinyl fluoride, vinylidene fluoride, vinylidene chloride, hexafluoropropene, trifluoropropene, 1,2-dichloroethene, 1,2-difluoroethene or tetrafluoroethene,<br>
where the solids (I) according to the invention are used as fillers in these polymers; the composition and production of extruder films of this type are described in detail in DE-A 19713072.0.<br>
To produce the novel composite, the at least one first layer is brought together with the at least one second layer, and according to the invention any known process may be used to bring layers of this type together. For example, the first layer may be applied to the second layer by processes at atmospheric pressure, e.g. casting or doctoring of the starting material for the first layer, or also by processes at superatmospheric pressure, e.g. extrusion, lamination, in particular hot lamination, calendering or compression. The resultant composite here may be cured or crosslinked by radiation, or electrochemically or thermally. In addition, the starting material for the at least one first layer may firstly be cured or crosslinked<br><br>
thermally, either partially or completely, and then, as described above, brought together at atmospheric pressure or at superatmospheric pressure with the second layer used according to the invention. If prefabricated films, i.e. the at least one first layer in the form of a film and also the conventional separator in the form of a film, are to be brought together, this preferably takes place by lamination, generally at fi^om about 100 to about 160°C, preferably fi-om about 115 to about 140°C (hot lamination), where in each case the precise temperatures used depend, in particular, on the respective conventional separator used. For example, if polypropylene films are used here the temperatures may be slightly higher than when polyethylene films are used. If the composite is produced by lamination, the composition of the first layer may also be in partially or completely crosslinked form and the composite obtained after lamination may, if required, be crosslinked again or else used directly without post-crosslinking.<br>
If the novel composite is used as a separator in an electrochemical cell, the composite is combined with conventional anodes and cathodes. In addition, a dissociable compound containing lithium cations, known as a conducting salt, and, if desired, other additives, such as in particular organic solvents, sometimes called an electrolyte, may be incorporated. Some or all of the lastmentioned substances may be admixed during the production of the novel composite or introduced after it has been produced.<br>
Conducting salts which may be used are well known and described, for example, in EP-A 0 096 629. Conducting salts preferably used according to the invention are LiPFfi, LiBF4, LiC104, LiAsFe, LiCFaSOa, LiC(CF3S02)3, LiN(CF3S02)2, LiN(S02CnF2n+H)2, LiC[(C„F2,rfi)S02]3, Li(CnF2„-.i)S02, where n is in each case from 2 to 20, LiN(S02F)2, LiAlCU, LiSiFe, LiSbF6, (RS02)r,XLi („X = ,0, ,S, 2N, 2?, 3C, 3Si; R = CniF2m+i where m = 0-10 or C1-C20 hydrocarbons), Li imide salts, Li methide salts, or a mixture of two or more of these, and the use of LiPF6 as conducting salt is preferred.<br>
Possible organic electrolyte solvents are the compounds discussed above under "plasticizers", and those preferably used are the conventional organic electrolytes, preferably esters, such as ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate or diethyl carbonate, or mixtures of compounds of this type.<br><br>
The thickness of the novel composites is advantageously from 5 to 500 jmi, preferably from 10 to 500 |xm, more preferably from 10 to 200 fmi and in particular frt&gt;m 15 to 100 (xm.<br>
The composite may be assembled with the anodes and cathodes to give an electrochemical cell, which in turn is a solid composite article. This composite article advantageously has an overall thickness of from 30 to 2000 pm, in particular an overall thickness of from 50 to 1000 |mi.<br>
The present invention also provides a process which produces a composite of this type and comprises the following stages:<br>
(I)	producing at least one first layer as defined above;<br>
(II)	producing at least one second layer as defined above; and<br>
(III)	then combining the at least one first layer with the at least one second layer, by a conventional layering process.<br>
The at least one first layer is preferably produced on a temporary substrate. According to the invention, conventional temporary substrates may be used here, e.g. a release film made from a polymer or from a preferably coated paper, e.g. a siliconized polyester film. However, this first layer may also be produced on a permanent substrate, e.g, a collector electrode, or else even entirely without a substrate.<br>
The bringing together and the production of the layer defined above takes place by means of atmospheric-pressure processes for providing layers or for the production of films, such as casting or doctoring, or else by processes at superatmospheric pressure, such as extrusion, lamination, in particular hot lamination, calendering or compression. The resultant composite may, if desired, be cured or crosslmked by radiation or electrochemically or thermally.<br>
It is also possible to use the process described above to bring the novel composite together with conventional electrodes and so to prepare a composite article with the constituents (release film/separator/electrode).<br><br>
It is also possible, by double-sided coating of the composite, to provide a composite article with the constituents anode/separator/cathode.<br>
For this, the composite, as a separator, with the anode film and/or cathode film, may be laminated together at &gt;80*^C. The novel composite here may readily be laminated to a conventional anode or cathode, giving a composite article - anode/-or cathodeAseparator - which may then, in turn, be combined with a conventional cathode or anode.<br>
A composite article of anode/separator/cathode as described above may also be produced without using a substrate and, respectively, the collector electrodes, since the novel composite comprising at least one first and at least one second layer, as defined above, has per se sufficient mechanical stability for use in electrochemical cells.<br>
The electrolyte and conducting salt may be placed into composite articles of this type or into the electrochemical cell either before the layers are brought together or preferably after the layers have been brought together, if desired after contact has been made with suitable collector electrodes, e.g. with a metal foil, or even after the composite or, respectively, the composite article, has been introduced into a battery casing. Here, the specific microporous structure of the layers in the novel composite, determined in particular by the presence of the solid (I) defined above permits the electrolyte and the conducting salt to be absorbed with displacement of the air in the pores. Depending on the electrolyte used, the loading may take place at from 0 to about 100°C<br>
The novel electrochemical cells may be used in particular as an automobile battery, appliance battery, flat-type battery, on-board battery, battery for static applications, or electrotraction battery.<br>
The novel composite has the following advantages over the separators hitherto provided for use in electrochemical cells:<br><br>
the combination of a conventional separator and the composition containing<br>
a solid (I) gives a composite which has exceptional mechanical stability, in<br>
particular  excellent  dimensional   stability  and  improved  compressive<br>
strength;<br>
the novel composite may be used without difficulty in battery production<br>
on commercially available winding machinery used for that purpose;<br>
the novel composite is a separator with shutdown mechanism.<br>
Some examples will now be used to describe the present invention.<br>
Figures 1 to 5 here in each case show the results frx)m cycling (voltage: 4.15 V) of the electrochemical cells obtained as in Examples 1 to 5,<br>
Preparation Example 1 (PAD<br>
800 g of xylene were heated to 85°C.<br>
A feed I, composed of a mixture made from<br>
100 g of	lauryl acrylate,<br>
300 g of	dihydrodicyclopentadienyl acrylate,<br>
120 g of	glycidyl methacrylate,<br>
480 g of	ethylhexyl acrylate and<br>
2 g of	mercaptoethanol<br>
was started at the same time as a feed II composed of<br>
30 g of	Wako V 59 (Azostarter V 59) and<br>
200 g of	xylene.<br>
Feed I was run into the initial charge within a period of 1.5 hours, and feed II within a period of 2 hours. The temperature here was held at from 80 to 90*^C. The mixture was allowed to continue reacting at 90^C for 3 hours.<br>
166 g of 4-hydroxybenzophenone and<br><br>
0,83 g of dimethylaminopyridine<br>
were then added. The reaction was allowed to continue for from 2 to 3 hours until an epoxide value of 
Example 1<br>
20 g of a methacrylic silane hydrophobicized woUastonite (Tremin*®^ 283-600 MST) were dispersed in 15 g of acetone. 54 g of a solution of 6 g of a vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene copolymer (Kynarflex® 2801, ELF Atochem) and a solution of 4.6 g of the PAl prepared as in Preparation Example 1 were then added in 34 g of xylene. Finally, 2.8 g of tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate were added.<br>
The resultant composition was then applied at 60°C to a substrate using a doctor with a casting gap of 500 fim, the solvents were removed within a period of 5 min and the film obtained after the dried coating had been peeled away had a thickness of about 27 [xm.<br>
The resultant film was laminated to a commercially available microporous PE film of thickness 8 ^m (Celgard^ without other additives, with the laminator rolls at 115°C. An Ibico laminator was used. Once the lamination was complete, the layer laminated onto the microporous PE film was photocrosslinked for 5 min at a distance of 5 cm in a field of superactinic fluorescent tubes (TL 09, Philips).<br>
The resultant composite was used as a separator and assembled, together with LiCoOa as cathode and graphite as anode, to give a "sandwich" cell. Using LiPFe as conducting salt and a 1:1 mixture of ethylene carbonate and diethylene carbonate as liquid electrolyte, the electrochemical cell obtained was cycled applying a voltage of 4.15 V.<br>
The specific battery data achieved using this cell were as follows:<br><br>
Battery test<br>
Cathode surface area:    1 cm<br>
Anode surface area:      1 cm^<br>
Cathode weight per unit area: 270 g/m'<br>

The results from this cycling are given in Table 1 above and, respectively, in Figs. 1 and 2. Fig. 1 here shows the plot of charging and discharging tests against time, where V is the voltage applied and t is the time elapsed. It is noticeable that the charging and, respectively, discharge capacity/ of the sandwich cell of Example 1 does not change with time. This is confirmed by Fig. 2, in which the specific charging and, respectively discharge capacity [mAh/g] has been plotted against the number of cycles (Z). It can be seen that at, for example, the 5* cycle this cell had a specific charging capacity at the cathode of 89 mAhg/g.<br>
Example 2<br>
A composite was produced in a manner similar to that of Example 1 using PAl as crosslinking system, except that the film initially obtained was irradiated under the conditions of Example 1 for 2 seconds and tbeti brought together with the PE film in a manner similar to that of Example 1. The resultant compo site was then UV-<br><br>
irradiated as in Example 1 and used as a separator. Table 2 and Fig. 3 show the results of the studies of electrochemical activity.<br><br><br><br>
The discharge capacity obtained for this cell at the 5*** cycle was about 82 mAh/g*<br>
Example 3<br>
An electrochemical cell was produced in a manner similar to that of Example 2, but in Example 3 the composite initially obtained received no further UV post-irradiation* Cycling then followed as in Example 1 or 2. The results of this cycling are shown in Table 3 and, respectively, Fig. 4.<br><br>

The discharge capacity obtained for this cell at the 5^ cycle was about 95.5 mAh/g, Example 4<br>
A fihn was first produced as in Example 1 and, without having been radiated, laminated to an anode (graphite on Cu fihn) at 140**C, and the resultant composite article was laminated at 115°C to a microporous PE film (Celgard®) of 8 [jm thickness.<br>
