Triazatrinaphthyrins and the Use Thereof<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to macrocycles having three naphthyridine<br>
5	subunits and salts and metal complexes thereof; to a process for the preparation<br>
of these macrocycles, their salts and complexes; and to the use of compositions of these macrocycles for extracting a transition metal and a method for extracting a transition metal using the composition.<br>
Related Art<br>
10	The transition metals include the nine metals of Group VIII of the periodic<br>
table, as representative examples thereof, and the lanthanide and actinide metals. The transition metals further include the metals called rare metals, noble metals, and heavy metals. Specific examples thereof include iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), palladium (Pd), osmium (Os), indium<br>
15	(Ir), platinum (Pt), titanium (Ti)t vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn),<br>
copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), yttrium (Y), zirconium (Zr), niobium (Nb), molybdenum (Mo), silver (Ag), cadmium (Cd), lanthanum (La), cerium (Ca), neodymium (Nd), samarium (Sm), europium (Eu), gadolinium (Gd), terbium (Tb), holmium (Ho), erbium (Er), thulium (Tm), ytterbium (Yb), lutetium (Lu), hafnium (Hf)&gt; tantalum<br>
20	(Ta), tungsten (W), gold (Au), mercury (Hg), uranium (U), and plutonium (Pu).<br>
These transition metals are used not only in catalysts and iron/steels but also in a wide variety of other applications such as hydrogen-absorbing alloys, batteries, magnets, and superconductive materials. These metals are desired to be recovered from so-called secondary resources from the standpoint of stable<br>
25	supply. Furthermore, it in necessary to treat industrial drainage and the like to<br>
remove the metals contained therein in slight amounts. Thus, the establishment of an efficient metal recovery technique is an important subject also from the standpoint of environmental protection.<br><br>
WO 01/46193	PCT/US00/34911<br>
-2-<br>
One of the elemental techniques for the recovery and purification of<br>
transition metals is the solvent extraction method. The solvent extraction method<br>
has conventionally employed an acid, basic, or neutral extracting agent according<br>
to the composition of the solution to be treated.   Besides being used alone,<br>
5	transition metals have recently come to be used as composites and similar<br>
materials such as alloys and mixtures.   It is hence thought that the solvent extraction method comes to be utilized increasingly.<br>
There is a desire for an extracting agent which has higher extraction<br>
capacity, higher extraction rate, and higher selectivity and is harmless and<br>
10	inexpensive.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an extracting agent for a<br>
transition metal which has a novel structure entirely different from the structure<br>
of any known extracting agent for a transition metal and has excellent extracting<br>
15	performance.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for extracting a transition metal with the extracting agent.<br>
The present invention addresses these and other shortcomings in the prior<br>
art by providing macrocyclic compounds for use in specific metal ion binding.<br>
20	The invention concerns a class of novel macrocycles, termed triazatrinaphthyrins,<br>
and their metal complexes and salts. In a general and overall sense, the novel triazatrinaphthyrin compounds of the present invention include those with structures in accordance with general Formula /:<br><br>
WO 01/46193	3_	PCT/USOO/34911<br><br>
or a solvate, hydrate, ester or salt thereof; wherein R1-R3 and Ra, Ra', Ra  ,Rb, Rb', Rb", Rc, Rc', Rc' , Rd, Rd' and Rd" are as defined below.<br>
These and other objects of the present invention are accomplished by a<br>
5	composition for extracting a transition metal .which comprises as an active<br>
ingredient a triazatrinaphthyrin or a salt thereof-<br>
Furthermore, these and other objects of the present invention are<br>
accomplished by a method for extracting a transition metal which comprises<br>
extracting a transition metal with the above-described composition for extracting<br>
10	a transition metal.<br>

Scheme 1 illustrates the synthetic sequence for the preparation of various 2,7-diamino-1,8-naphthyridines (5a). As shown, this is accomplished by reacting the corresponding 2-amino-7-chloro-l,8-naphthyridine (4) or 2,7-dichloro-l,8-naphthyridine (7) with anhydrous ammonia or other amine.   The 2-amino-7-<br>
25	chloro-l,8-naphthyridines (4) can be prepared according to the method of<br>

of Formula /. For example, as shown in Scheme 2 below, protection of the 2- and<br>
7-amino groups with a suitable protecting group and subsequent treatment with<br>
base generates one or more nucleophilic carbon atoms on the naphthyridine ring<br>
10	which can react with the appropriate electrophile (e.g., alkyl halides, epoxides,<br>
anhydrides, sulfonate esters and the like) to arrive at a functionalized 2,7-diaminonaphthyridine for use in the subsequent macrocycle forming reaction.<br><br>

Scheme 3 illustrates the synthesis of the parent triazatrinaphthyrin<br>
(wherein Ra, Ra,' Ra", Rb, Rb', Rb", Rc, Rc', Rc", Rd, Rd' and Rd" of Formula/ are each<br>
hydrogen).    The macrocycle forming reaction is carried out in a vertical<br>
Abderhalden apparatus (see Figure 1) or in a tube furnace, the latter providing<br>
5	better temperature control.    In general, the macrocycle forming reaction is<br>
characterized by the treatment of a 2,7-diamino-1,8-naphthyridine with hydrogen halide gas at a temperature sufficient to cause melting of the 2,7-diamino-l,8-naphthyridine in 1 atmosphere of hydrogen halide gas. While not intending to be limited to any mechanistic explanation, the reaction is believed to proceed by<br>
10	elevation ofahydrohalidesalt of2,7-diamino-l,8-naphthyridine to a temperature<br>
sufficient to cause amine extrusion and triazatrinaphthyrin formation. The details of an embodiment of the synthesis as carried out in the Abderhalden apparatus are outline in Example 1.<br>
It is to be understood that the macrocycle-forming reaction can be carried<br>
15	out with a single 2,7-diamino- 1,8-naphthyridine or with a mixture of 2,7-<br>
diamino- 1,8-naphthyridines. When the macrocycle-forming reaction is carried out with a mixture of 2,7-diamino-1,8-naphthyridines, a mixture of products (including various regioisomers) is obtained. One of skill in the art will appreciate various chromatographic media and solvent systems capable of<br>
20	separating a mixture of triazatrinaphthyrins and isolating the desired compound<br>
from the mixture. Typical chromatographic media include various mesh sizes of silica gel or alumina and typical solvent systems include mixtures of polar and non-polar solvents such as CHC13/CH3OH, CH2C12/CH3OH, and others known in the art of chrornatography.<br>
25	An alternative embodiment of the process for forming triazatrinaphthyrins<br>
involves the use of a hydrohalide salt of an aromatic amine or a mixture of aromatic amines (including, but not limited to, pyridinium hydrochloride, quinoline hydrochloride or 4-(3-phenylpropyl)pyridine hydrochloride) as a solvent  in  which  a  2,7-diamino-l,8-naphthyridine  is   dissolved   and  the<br>
30	temperature elevated sufficiently to cause melting of the solvent and amine<br><br>

extrusion and triazatrinaphthyrin formation. Certain solvents, such as pyridinium hydrochloride, when heated to near its boiling point of 222 °C, facilitate the formation of triazatrinapthyrin in 1 atmosphere of hydrogen chloride at temperatures well below 300 °C.<br>
5	At sufficiently elevated temperatures, the use of hydrogen chloride or a<br>
hydrohalide salt may not be necessary to effect formation of the<br>
triazatrinapthyrin. Specifically, the di-n-propyl-diaminonaphthyriine outlined in<br>
Scheme 2, when heated rapidly and briefly to its melting point of about 340 °C<br>
in a sealed tube, spontaneously forms the corresponding hexapropyl<br>
10	triazatrinapthyrin in good yield.     Accordingly, the present invention  also<br>
encompasses a process for forming a triazatrinaphthyrin by heating a 2,7-diamino-l,8-naphthyridine at, or above, its melting temperature to yield the desired triazatrinaphthyrin.<br><br><br>
WO 01/46193	PCT/US00/34911<br>
Metalation/Addition of Radioisotopes<br>
The triazatrinaphthyrin compounds of the present invention include those<br>
where the triazatrinaphthyrin is complexed with certain metals for use as a<br>
transition metal complexing agent, or simply as a convenient form of the<br>
5	compound. Examples of metals which are appropriate include paramagnetic ions<br>
of elements such as Gd, In, Eu, Dy, Pr, Pa, Cr, Co, Fe, Cu, Ni, Ti, and V,<br>
preferably Gd or Eu. Complex formation is typically carried out in a polar<br>
solvent, including but not limited to, water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol,<br>
acetone, DMF, DMSO, acetonitrile and the like. Solvent systems including a<br>
10	mixture of solvents and/or aqueous solvent mixtures are also contemplated.<br>
Typically, the metal ion in the form of its halide or acetate salt is used in the complex forming reaction. An exemplary complex forming reaction is described in Example 2.<br>
Protonated Macrocycles<br>
15	Triazatrinaphthyrins   undergo   facile   protonation   at  one   or  more<br>
naphthyridine nitrogens or at one or more apical (or "meso") nitrogens. Typically, a triazatrinaphthyrin is contacted with an acid selected from hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydrofluoric, perchloric, nitric, sulfuric, phosphoric, formic, acetic, trifluoroacetic, propionic, maleic, succinic, malonic, and methane<br>
20	sulfonic in an aqueous solution.    The resulting singly or multi-protonated<br>
macrocycle is associated with one or more negatively charged counterions, depending on the acid used to protonate the macrocycle.<br>

b. 11,22,33-Triazatrinaphthyrin. A custom-built vertical Aberhalden apparatus (see Figure 1) was charged with 2,7-diamino-l,8-naphthyridine (12 grams) and capped with a stoppered top leading to a manifold capable of replacing a vacuum with 1 atmosphere of anhydrous hydrogen chloride gas. The<br>
20	diaminonaphthyridine was held under vacuum in the inner chamber of the<br>
Aberhalden vessel until such time as condensing vapors of sulfuric acid (bp=300 °C) began to bathe the outside of the inner chamber and the diaminonaphthyridine began to change color from the heat. The vacuum was then promptly replaced with 1 atm of anhydrous hydrogen chloride.    The<br>

minutes the darkened reaction mass had completely resolidified, and heating was continued for an additional 20 minutes.

25	Extraction of Metals<br>
Besides the nine elements of Group VIII of the periodic table, the transition metals include the elements of Groups 3A to 7A and Groups 1B and 2B, that is, the elements ranging from scandium, having an atomic number of 21,<br><br>
WO 01/46193	PCT/US00/34911<br>
-18-<br>
to zinc, having an atomic number of 30, from yttrium, having an atomic number<br>
of 39, to cadmium, having an atomic number of 48, from lanthanum, having an<br>
atomic number of 57, to mercury, having an atomic number of 80, and from<br>
actinium, having an atomic number of 89, to lawrencium, having an atomic<br>
5	number of 103. Specifically, the transition metals include the elements of Group<br>
VIII, i.e., iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), palladium (Pd), osmium (Os), iridium (IT), and platinum (Pt), and further include titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), yttrium (Y), zirconium (Zr), niobium (Nb), molybdenum (Mo), silver (Ag),<br>
10	cadmium (Cd), lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), neodymium (Nd), samarium (Sm),<br>
europium (Eu), gadolinium (Gd), terbium (Tb), holmium (Ho), erbium (Er), thulium (Tin), ytterbium (Yb), lutetium (Lu), hafnium (Hf), tantalum (Ta), tungsten (W), gold (Au), mercury (Hg), uranium (U), and plutonium (Pu).<br>
The solution to be extracted is not particularly limited in the concentration<br>
15	of transition metals dissolved therein. Even when the solution has a transition<br>
metal concentration as low as about 1.0 x 10"5 M, it is expected to be sufficiently extracted.<br>
Although the aqueous transition metal solution is not particularly limited in pH, it preferably has a pH below 6. As the pH of the solution is altered, the<br>
20	degree of extraction may tend to decrease. In this case, a longer extraction period<br>
is necessary as is know in the art<br>
The extraction temperature is not particularly limited as long as it is not higher than the boiling point of the solvent used. In general, a temperature around room temperature may be used.<br>
25	The extraction operation is conducted by bringing a solution of the<br>
triazatrinaphthyrin into contact with a solution containing transition metals dissolved therein. This contacting is accomplished by shaking, stirring, etc. Although conditions for shaking or stirring are not particularly limited, vigorous shaking or agitation is more effective in efficient extraction.  Shaking may be<br>
30	usually conducted at a frequency of about from 100 to 400 times per minute.<br><br>
WO 01/46193	PCT/US00/34911<br>
An additive for accelerating the extraction (extraction accelerator) can also be used.<br>
Examples of the extraction accelerator include basic nitrogen-containing<br>
heterocyclic compounds and aromatic amino acids. Specific examples thereof<br>
5	include   nitrogen-containing   heterocyclic   compounds,   such   as   pyridine,<br>
alkylpyridinas (e.g., methylpyridine, ethylpyridine), and quinoline; and amino<br>
acids containing an aromatic ring, such an tryptophan and phenylalanine.<br>
Examples  of the extraction accelerator further include compounds  which<br>
coordinate to transition metal ions and help the ions to associate with the<br>
10	triazatrinaphthyrin and which thus function to heighten the rate of complex<br>
formation with transition metal ions.   However, pyridine and tryptophan are<br>
preferred.<br>
Although the concentration of the extraction accelerator is not particularly<br>
limited, the amount thereof is preferably from 1 to 1,000 gram equivalents per<br>
15	gram equivalent of the transition metal ions to be extracted.<br>
If the amount of the extraction accelerator is too small, the effect of accelerating extraction is not obtained. Conversely, if the amount thereof is too large, there is a fear that the accelerator may alter the properties of the solvent used in an organic phase.<br>
20	The composition for extracting a transition metal of the present invention<br>
is useful for efficiently extracting transition metals, particularly lanthanides, such as gadolinium.<br>
Extraction Example<br>
Extraction of transition metals with a triazatrinaphthyrin of the present<br>
25	invention may be carried out as follows:<br>
In the extraction experiment, 10 ml of an organic phase is prepared by dissolving triazatrinaphthyrin acetate (or other triazatrinaphtyrin macrocycle, salt or complex) in chloroform in a concentration of 5.0 x 10-4 M and placing the same in a 30-ml screw vial together with 10 ml of an acetic acid phase containing<br><br>
WO 01/46193	PCT/US00/34911<br>
-20-<br>
transition metal chlorides in an amount of 1.0 x 10-4 M, and the contents are<br>
shaken for 24 hours. In determining the degree of extraction for each metal, the<br>
acetic acid phase after the shaking is analyzed with an atomic absorption<br>
photometer to determine the concentration of ions of the metal remaining therein.<br>
5	The degree of extraction is calculated using the following equation, wherein<br>
M+tolal means the initial concentration of the metal ions and M+solulion means the found metal ion concentration in the acetic acid phase after the extraction experiment.<br><br>
10	Having now fully described this invention, it will be understood to those<br>
of ordinary skill in the art that the same can be performed within a wide and equivalent range of conditions, formulations, and other parameters without affecting the scope of the invention or any embodiment thereof.
