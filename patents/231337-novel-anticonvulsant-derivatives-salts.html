One of these compounds, 2,3,4,5-bis-O- (l-methylethylidene) -p-D-fructopyranose sulfamate, known as topi:ramate, has been demonstrated in clinical trials of human epilepsy to be effective as adjunctive therapy or as monotherapy in treating simple and complex partial seizure and secondarily generalized seizures (E. Faught, B.J. Wilder, R.E. Ramsey, R.A. Reife, L.D. Kramer, G. . Pledger, R.M. Karim, et al. , Epilepsia, 36 (S4) 33, (1995); S.K. Sachdeo, R.C. Sachdeo, R.A. Reife, P. Lim and G. Pledger, Epilepsia, 36 (S4) 33, (1995)). U.S. Patents No. 4,513,006, No. 5,242,942, and No. 5,384,327, which are hereby incorporated by reference, disclose processes for th

EXAMPLE 23 Preparation of Chollne Salt Form CH1<br>
Topiramate (10.36g, 30.5 mmol) was dissolved in ethyl acetate (150 mL) and the clear solution was treated with choline hydroxide (45% solution in methanol; 8.2g, 30.5 mmol) . The solution was heated to evaporate some of the solvent while maintaining the volume constant by portionwise addition of ethyl acetate until the boiling temperature reached 75°C. The resulting clear solution was allowed to stand at room temperature overnight. The precipitated crystalline Bolid was collected by filtration, washed with ethyl acetate and air-dried.<br>

EXAMPLE 24 Maximal Electroshock (MES) Seizure Test<br>
Anticonvulsant activity was determined using the MES test as described by Swinyard EA, Woodhead JH, White HS, Franklin MR. Experimental selection, quantification, and evaluation of anticonvulsants. In Levy RH, et al., eds. Antiepileptic Drugs. 3rd ed. New York: Raven Press, 1989:85-102.<br>
In this procedure, a 60-Hz alternating current (mice 50 mA, rats 150 mA) was delivered for 0.2 sec through corneal electrodes by an apparatus that is capable of precisely regulating current intensity and duration. The concave side of the electrode (2;mm diameter for mice; 4.0mm diameter for rats) was placed on each cornea. The current reliably produces, in all rodents, a single convulsive episode that includes, as a component, hind limb tonic extension. Immediately before placement of corneal electrodes, a drop of saline (an electrolyte that promotes the dispersion of the current and that reduces lethalities) was placed on each electrode. Rodents were restrained by hand during this procedure and released immediately after stimulation to permit observation of the convulsion throughout its entire course.<br>
The test compound or corresponding vehicle was administered to overnight fasted rodents by the oral (gavage) route of administration. (Test compound or vehicle may alternatively oe administered via intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular route of administration.) Subsequently,<br><br>
electrical stimulation was administered to the rodents at a time corresponding to the suspected time of peak activity of the test comrpound. The test was complete when the entire course of the convulsion had been observed (typically, less than 1 minute after electrical stimulation), and rodents were then immediately euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation.<br>
Abolition of the hind-limb tonic extensor component of the seizure was taken as the endpoint for this test. Absence of this component indicated that the test compound has the ability to prevent the spread of seizure discharge through neural tissue. "he ED50 value of the test compound was the calculated dose required, to block the hind limb tonic-extensor component of the MES-induced seizure in 50% of the rodents tested.<br>
Form K1 of the potassium salt of topiramate (the compound of formula (Ia) ) was tested in rats according to the above procedure, dosing orally. Calculated ED50 value was determined in two separate measurements as 3.1mg/kg and 8.1 mg/kg at 2 hours post dosing.<br>
Form Kl of the potassium salt of topiramate (the compound of formula (Ia)) was tested in mice according to the above procedure, dosing orally and IP with calculated ED50 results as follows:<br>
Dosing orally ED5, @ 2 hrs = 40.6 mg/kg Dosing IP ED50 @ 2 hrs = 26.8 mg/kg Dosing IV ED50 @ 5 mins = 41.51 mg/kg<br>
Form Nal of the sodium salt of topiramate (the compound of formula (Ia)) was tested in rats according to<br><br>
the above procedure, dosing orally. Calculated ED50 value was determined in as 4.8 mg/kg at 2 hours post dosing.<br>
Form Nal of the sodium salt of topiramate (the compound of formula (Ia)) was tested in mice according to the above procedure, dosing IP with calculated ED50 results as follows:<br>
Dosing IP ED50 @ 30 mins = 45.44 mg/kg Dosing IV ED50 @ 5 mins = 46.18 mg/kg<br>
