				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a system for refrigeration and air conditioning. The said system comprising containers of compressed fuel gas, expansion valves, refrigeration and air conditioning unit and engine / oven. More particularly, the said system is useful in application in vehicles and non vehicular use such as in cold rooms and stores.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
As it is known that whenever there is a fast extraction of gas from a container, it results in a drop in the temperature of the container and thereby sweating of the container takes place. This phenomenon of sweating of the container, containing the compressed gas, is the condensation on the surface of the cylinder resulting due to the rapid extraction of the compressed gas. When the gas is extracted from containers of compressed gas, the following processes start: -<br>
(a)	"Latent heat of vaporization " in case of liquid state fuel, along with the<br>
(b)	"Expansion of the compressed gas " which is under pressure, results in this drop in<br>
temperature.<br>
A compressed gas is a mixture of hydrocarbons, which are in a gaseous state at ambient<br>
temperature and pressure and are liquefied under pressure for easy storage, handling and<br>
transportation in pressurized vessels. Propane and Butane is the main constituent of the said<br>
compressed gas in the case of L.P.G and Methane in the case of C.N.G.<br>
Now days there are number of vehicles that are running in the market, which are using<br>
compressed gas as a fuel for engine.<br>
However, no one has come out till date with a novel &amp; non-conventional method for "Energy<br>
Efficient Air Conditioning" and "Cooling in an enclosed Compartment" of vehicles along<br>
with cooling of appliances without incurring any running cost thereof.<br>
Moreover, in the present invention the inventors have proposed an energy efficient system<br>
and a method which is helpful in doing away with the consumption of the fuel needed to run<br>
the Air Conditioners in the vehicles and other cooling appliances by the conventional<br>
methods used today. The proposed system and method is a novel approach targeted to<br><br>
harness the untapped captive energy, which otherwise goes unutilized. The proposal of this method of air conditioning in vehicles and cooling of other appliances without incurring any additional running cost in vehicles and appliances, run on compressed gas. In a fast depleting Global oil reserve scenario along with a huge National oil exchequer payout for furnishing to the escalating oil demands the foreseeable advantages of the said proposal are manifold. As is evident that with a burgeoning population and escalating everyday vehicular needs, clubbed with the rising affordability of the people inclined with a disposition for comfort and improved quality of lifestyle. Inventors strongly believe that the invention stands a good chance in capping the consumption of fuel used for vehicular air-conditioning, running of refrigeration units therein, and providing cooling without incurring any additional running cost.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a system and a method of air conditioning in vehicles and non vehicular use such as in cold rooms and stores for cooling of other appliances without incurring any additional running cost in vehicles and appliances, run on supplied compressed gas.<br>
One another objective of the present invention is to provide a system of air conditioning, which is devoid of compressor-condenser assembly unit. Thereby, reducing the number of moving parts and processes involved along with increased dependability.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to obtain free cooling without any load on the Engine of the vehicle, thus the process is a Green and Clean Air approach.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide no additional fuel consumption in the cooling of the vehicle. In other words, improving the fuel efficiency of vehicle in the range of 5 km/hr to 10 km/hr.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to obtain cooling in a range from 3,000 Btu per hour to 20,000 Btu per hour.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to increase engine life by providing absence of load during running the air conditioner of the vehicle.<br><br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a system for refrigeration and air conditioning, characterized by<br>
a)	one or more container (1) filled with compressed fuel gas at high pressure,<br>
b)	one or more conduit (2), wherein first end of the conduit is connected to container and second end is connected to at least one expansion means (3),<br>
c)	one or more expansion means (3) such as herein described that converts the high-pressure liquefied or compressed gas into low-pressure gas, without heat gain or loss in the conduit,<br>
d)	said expansion means (3) are in communication with an engine or a burner (6) through a refrigeration / air conditioning unit (4) wherein multiple number of conduits (5) are located parallel to each other, and ends are connected next to each other,<br>
e)	the end portion of the said parallel conduits (5) are connected to an engine or a burner (6) whereby the said gas is extracting at a rate, for obtaining desired cooling in the said refrigerating / air conditioning unit (4).<br><br>
One aspect of the present invention wherein the said compressed liquefied gas are LPG /<br>
LNG or CNG.<br>
One aspect of the invention wherein, wherein the expansion mean is selected from the group<br>
comprising electronic expansion valve, mechanical valve and step motor expansion valve.<br>
More preferably, the electronic valves are selected from solenoid, pulse, analog, heat motor<br>
or step motor.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention, wherein the air conditioning unit having one or more<br>
fan to direct the air to any desired location.<br>
One another aspect of the present invention wherein, the said system is devoid of compressor<br>
and condensers and providing cooling with LPG or CNG in the range of 3000 BTU per hour<br>
to 25000 BTU per hour.<br>
One another aspect of the present invention wherein, a vehicle driven by above-said<br>
compressed fuel gas is incorporated with said system, providing cooling inside the vehicle in<br>
the range of 3000 BTU per hour to 25000 BTU per hour and fuel efficiency is increased in<br>
the said vehicle by 5km/hr to 10km/hr.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention wherein the energy used in compressing the gas into<br>
the container is the unutilized energy available. This is the energy, which is there in the<br>
containers un-accounted for. Having been recovered, and used profitably for useful purposes,<br>
without being wastefully dissipated. The said invention is related to utilize this energy<br>
available with us at no extra cost.<br>
One another aspect of the present invention wherein this energy is utilized in the Cooling of appliances as well as for air conditioning of the cars and vehicles running on compressed gas. The cooling is possible due to the following two major processes:-<br>
a)	The "Latent Heat of Vaporization" is taken up by the liquid gas to convert into a gaseous state and the result is an endothermic process producing cooling.<br>
b)	Along with this the expansion of the compressed gas to a lower pressure from a much higher initial compression is an adiabatic expansion and shall add to the cooling capacity.<br>
In one another aspect of the present invention, wherein there is a need for variable expansion valve/ device for the consumption of the L.P.G / L.N.G fuel, acting as the refrigerant,<br><br>
dependant upon the speed of the vehicle. A fixed diameter capillary, commonly used as an expansion devise for air conditioning and refrigeration, works well where the quantum of rate of refrigerant flowing through it per unit time does not vary. The rate of flow of refrigerant through it is binary, namely either it is full flow or it is switched off.<br>
Pertaining to the aforesaid, in the event of the rate of consumption of refrigerant varying below a certain quantum, the evaporator shall get flooded. This shall result in a drop in cooling produced in the evaporator.<br>
Unlike the conventional refrigeration system, which is a closed system, where the process of absorbing and rejecting heat is performed by the alternate compression, condensation and evaporation of a working fluid the present process is an open system where the already compressed liquid fuel having similar properties of R-22 (refer table) is evaporated and expanded in the evaporator to provide cooling.<br>
In its simplest form, the present system consists of no compressor, condenser assembly. The expansion device, evaporator, expansion devices, and interconnecting piping are required for the present process.<br>
The expansion device is very important to precisely regulate the flow of the fuel, which also acts as the refrigerant into the evaporator. Its function is to receive high pressure and temperature refrigerant (fuel) liquid (not Vapor) from the compressed cylinder and expand it into low pressure and temperature refrigerant vapor in the evaporator. The expanded vapor, with the requisite pressure, is then fed into the engine for consumption. The need of a condenser, which performs the function of removing heat from the expanded vapor, and rejecting the heat to air or water, is eliminated. The fuel cum refrigerant being consumed, the need to compress it back is also eliminated.<br>
The liquid fuel cum refrigerant, which remains at a high pressure, passes through the expansion device, experiences a pressure drop, and becomes a low pressure, two phase (liquid and vapor) mixture. This refrigerant mixture returns to the vapor phase in the evaporator by absorbing heat from the medium being cooled. The low pressure, low temperature vapor then goes to the engine, and is consumed depending upon the rate of consumption.<br><br>
Here, special importance arises to the type of the expansion device involved in expanding as well as regulating the flow of the liquid refrigerant. This is so because when the consuming agency, namely the engine, is operating at a lower rate of consumption, then a fixed rate of flow of refrigerant cum fuel from the cylinder into the evaporator will not mature the device and thereby not produce the adequate optimum amount of cooling. A flooding of the evaporator with more amount of fuel than being consumed will result in lesser or no cooling at all.<br>
Thus the applicant reach the need for the electronic expansion valves that regulates the flow of the fuel into the evaporator, in constant tandem with the amount of fuel that is being consumed by the engine at that point of time.<br>
The above-said refrigeration and air conditioning system can be implemented with existing vehicles where the conventional air conditioning systems are installed. A person skilled in the art can make effort to implement the proposed system with the existing one, so that capacity of air conditioning system in vehicles can be enhanced. The inventors have strong believe that the system will be workable and after implementation in used vehicles whereby refrigeration or air conditioner is not providing satisfactory results and running on compressed gas, the said proposed system will boost the systems capacity and mileage without incurring any additional cost.<br>
The advantages of the disclosed invention are thus attained in an economical, practical, and facile manner. While preferred embodiments and calculations, configurations have been shown and described, it is to be understood that various further modifications and additional configurations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. It is intended that the specific embodiments, configurations and calculations herein disclosed are illustrative and should not be interpreted as limitations on the scope of the invention.<br>
WORKING EXAMPLE<br>
The applicants hereby providing the mathematical calculations for estimating the cooling effect achieved, based upon the principle of the present invention. In calculation various assumptions have been made, which can be modify by a person skilled in the art.<br><br>
The calculations for the cooling possible are based on the data shown in Table 01 and are categorized as follows: -<br>
a)	Temperature Calculations resulting due to the expansion of gas<br>
b)	Cooling Calculations due to (A) Latent Heat taken up by gas due to evaporation i.e.; transition from liquid to gaseous state. (B) Heat taken up by gas due to volume expansion as displayed in (a).<br>
c)	Volumetric expansion Calculations due to pressure release.<br>
Study has shown that a minimum of about 0.2 Mpa absolute pressure, i.e. (1.973847 atm.) is required for satisfactory operation of delivery system. LPG has been and continues to be the most widely used alternative fuel to gasoline and diesel on the worldwide basis. (See Table 02) The delivery pressure of Auto LPG is 10 bars, in the cylinders while packing. Source IOCL). The LPG for commercial or Industrial use is available in 19 kg capacity cylinders.<br>
A)        VOLUME CALCULATIONS<br>
1)	P1 =&gt; The pressure in the L.P.G. Cylinder from the supplier = 10 bars. = 9.869233 atmosphere.<br>
2)	P2 =&gt; The required pressure in the Vaporizer Cylinder. = 0.2 Mpa. = 1.9738 atmosphere. This minimum pressure is needed for the smooth running of the vehicular engines.<br>
3)	V1 =&gt; The volume of one unit of the particular gas component of L.P.G.<br><br>
4)	V2=&gt; The volume of that L.P.G. gas component after expansion in the vaporizer.<br>
5)	(γ) =&gt; The ratio of Specific Heats (Gamma: Cp/Cv) at 1 bar and 27 degree Celsius.<br>
6)	For Propane (γ)	=	1.15<br>
7)	For Butane (γ)	=	1.11<br>
The inventors found in the calculations considering that the L.P.G. supplied for automotive purposes is in the ratio of 90% Propane: 10% Butane.<br>
For Propane<br>
(Equation Removed)<br><br><br>
Thus one unit volume of propane compressed at 10 bar. i.e., 9.869233 atm. Pressure expands to 4.052 unit volume after pressure is reduced to 1.99999 bar. i.e., 1.973837 atm. Pressure.<br>
For Butane<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Thus one unit volume of Butane compressed at 10 bars Pressure expands to 4.262 unit volume after pressure is reduced to 1.99999 bar i.e., 1.973837 atm. Pressure.<br>
TEMPERATURE CALCULATIONS For Propane<br>
1)	Tl =&gt; The Temperature in the L.P.G. Cylinder from the supplier at 27 degree Celsius = 300.15 degree Kelvin.<br>
2)	T2 =&gt; The Temperature in the Vaporizer Cylinder after expansion to 1.9738 atmosphere pressure.<br>
3)	Vl=&gt; The volume of the component of L.P.G. supplied in the cylinder.<br>
4)	V2=&gt; The volume of the expanded gas component of L.P.G. in the vaporizer.<br>
5)	For Propane (Y)	=	1.15<br><br>
6)	For Butane (γ)	=	1.11<br>
We do the calculations considering that the L.P.G. supplied for automotive purposes is in the ratio of 90% Propane: 10% Butane.<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Or,      T2 = (300.15)x (1/4.052)<br>
Or,      T2 = 243.32 degree Kelvin<br>
Or,      T2 = (-) 29.83 degree Celsius.		(B- A)<br>
It is of importance to note that this low temperature (T2) in the Vaporizer is achieved without<br>
any conventional mechanical effort, in the form of compressors or coolant.<br>
The Boiling point of Propane being at -42.1 °C and this being lower than the temperature<br>
(T2) achieved due to  the expansion of the compressed gas, the  gas remains fit for<br>
combustion.<br>
For Butane<br>
7)	Tl =&gt; The Temperature in the L.P.G. Cylinder from the supplier at 27 degree Celsius = 300.15 degree Kelvin.<br>
8)	T2 =&gt; The Temperature in the Vaporizer Cylinder after expansion to 1.9738 atmosphere.<br>
9)	Vl=&gt; The volume of the component of L.P.G. supplied in the cylinder.<br>
10)	V2=&gt; The volume of the expanded gas component of L.P.G. in the vaporizer.<br><br>
11)	For Propane (γ)	=	1.15<br>
12)	For Butane (γ)	=	1.11<br>
We do the calculations considering that the L.P.G. supplied for Automotive purposes is in the ratio of 90% Propane: 10% Butane.<br><br><br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Or,      T2 = (300.15)x (1/4.262)<br>
Or,      T2 = 255.90 degree Kelvin<br>
Or,      T2 = (-) 17.25 degree Celsius.		(B- B)<br>
It is of importance that this low temperature (T2) in the Vaporizer is achieved without any conventional mechanical effort, in the form of compressors or coolant. The Boiling point of Butane being at -0.5 °C and this being higher than the temperature (T2) achieved due to the expansion of the compressed gas, the gas condenses and impedes in combustion. The volume of Butane being just 10% the problem can be solved by<br>
a)	Heating the expanded gas by captive energy available as in the engine coolant etc., OR<br>
b)	By using pure Propane.<br>
THUS AVERAGE TEMPERATURE IN THE VAPORIZER AFTER EXPANSION OF 90% PROPANE AND 10% BUTANE GAS IS<br>
TEMP. = 243.32X9 + 255.90X1   =244.578 Degrees Kelvin = (-)28.572 degree C. 10<br>
FINAL VAPORIZER TEMPERATURE<br>
= (-) 28.572 degree C.		(B- C)<br>
B) LATENT HEAT OF VAPORIZATION CALCULATIONS<br>
Average Distance of vehicles running on L.P.G., i.e. L.P.G. = 10.5 km/Kg..<br>
Or, Distance moved by vehicle in one 19 Kg. L.P.G. cylinder = 200 Km. Approx.<br>
Assuming that the car/ vehicle is moving at a speed of 100 Km./ Hr.<br>
Then consumption of L.P.G. = (19 ÷200) x 100 = Kg/hour. = 9.5 Kg / Hour.<br>
Thus, the total volume of compressed gas consumed per hour from LPG cylinder at 10 bar =<br>
9.8692 atm. while running the vehicle at 100 Km per Hour = 9.5 Kg/ Hour<br><br>
For Propane<br>
Latent Heat of Vaporization = 425.31 kJ/kg.<br>
Endothermic Energy due to vaporization of Propane Component of L.P.G. assuming Propane is 90% of L.P.G.<br>
= 425.31 x 9.5 x 0.9 = 3636.4 kJ/Hour.<br>
= 868.53 K.Cal/Hour. = 3446.64 BTU /hour.     	(IIIA)<br>
For Butane<br>
Latent heat of vaporization = 385.6 kJ/kg<br>
Endothermic Energy due to vaporization of Butane Component of L.P.G. assuming Butane is 10% of L.P.G.<br>
= 385.6x9.5x0.1 = 366.32 kJ/Hour.<br>
= 87.49 K. Cal/Hour. = 347.20 BTU/hour		(IIIB)<br>
Total Cooling achieved due to Latent Heat of Vaporization of Propane (+) Butane<br>
= 3446.64 (+) 347.20 = 3793.84 BTU /Hour		(IVB)<br>
C)        POLYENTROPIC EXPANSION CALCULATIONS<br>
For Propane<br>
Specific Gravity = 1.550 (Vapor State) at 1.9738 atm., (-) 28.572 degree Celsius. Specific Gravity = 0.5077 (Liquid State) at 9.8692 atm.; (+) 27.0 degree Celsius. Liquid density: 582 kg/m3<br>
As, Density= Mass / Volume Or, Volume = Mass / Density<br>
As, Propane = 90% of the L.P.G. used<br>
So, Extraction Rate of Mass of Propane being used = 9.5 X 0.9 = 8.55 Kg/Hour<br>
Or, Volume of Liquid Propane rate of extraction from cylinder<br>
V1= (8.55) / (582)<br>
Or,	V1= 0.01469 Cu.M/Hr.<br><br>
V1= 14.69 LITRES/ HOUR.<br>
Where, V1 is the volume of LIQUID Propane before expansion at 9.8692 atm. Pressure.<br>
As we know that unit volume of Liquid Propane expands to 311 unit volume of Vapour at 1 ATM. i.e. Liquid/gas equivalent (1.013 bar and 15 °C (59 °F)) = 311 vol. / vol.<br>
So as,<br>
VOLUME OF LIQUID PROPANE EXTRACTED AT 9.8692 ATM. PRESSURE = 14.69 LITRES/HOUR.<br>
So,<br>
COMPARABLE VOLUME OF PROPANE VAPOUR AFTER EXTRACTION TO 1.0<br>
ATM. PRESSURE<br>
= 14.69 X 311 =4568.6 LITRES/HOUR.<br>
AND COMPARABLE VOLUME OF PROPANE VAPOUR AFTER EXTRACTION TO 1.9738 ATM PRESSURE =<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Where, V2 is the volume of Propane after expansion to 1.9739 Atm. Pressure.<br>
Again,	(Equation Removed)<br><br><br>
Where V1 is the volume of Propane VAPOR CONVERTED FROM LIQUID STATE before expansion and is at 9.8692 atm. Pressure.<br>
Because,<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Where "ΔW" is the energy absorbed due to the expansion of compressed gas L.P.G in the container from 9.8692 atm. to 1.9738 atm. Pressure.<br>
Or,	(Equation Removed)<br>
Or,      ΔW = 7773.91 atm. Liter / hour<br>
As, 1 atm. Liter =101 joule<br>
So,      ΔW = 785165.87 joule/hour<br>
Or,      ΔW = 785.165 Kjoule/hour<br>
Or,      ΔW = 187.533 K Cal. / hour<br>
Or,      ΔW = 744.192 BTU/Hour     	    (I)<br>
Similarly For Butane<br>
Specific Gravity = 0.5844 (Vapor State) at 1.9738 atm., (-) 28.572 degree Celsius. Specific Gravity = 2.077    (Liquid State) at 9.8692 atm.; (+) 27.0 degree Celsius. Liquid density: 601.4 kg/m3<br>
As, Density= Mass / Volume Or, Volume = Mass / Density<br>
As, Butane = 10% of the L.P.G. used<br>
So, Rate of Mass of Butane being used = 9.5 X 0.1 = 0.95 Kg/Hour<br>
Or, Volume of Liquid Butane rate of extraction from cylinder at 9.8692 atm. Pressure.<br>
V1= (0.95) ÷(601.4)<br>
Or,	V1= 1.5796 LITRES/ HOUR.<br><br>
Where, Vi is the volume of LIQUID Butane before expansion and at 9.8692 atm. Pressure.<br>
As we know that unit volume of Liquid Butane expands to 239 unit volume of Vapour at 1.0 ATM. Pressure<br>
AS VOLUME OF LIQUID BUTANE EXTRACTED AT 9.8692 ATM. PRESSURE = 1.5796 LITRES/HOUR.<br>
SO COMPARABLE VOLUME OF BUTANE VAPOUR AFTER EXTRACTION TO 1.0 ATM. PRESSURE<br>
= 1.5796 X 239 = 377.52 LITRES/HOUR.<br>
AND COMPARABLE VOLUME OF BUTANE VAPOUR AFTER EXTRACTION TO 1.9738 ATM PRESSURE =<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Where V2 is the volume of Butane after expansion to 1.9739 Atm. Pressure. As γ for Butane =1.11<br>
Again,<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Where V1 is the volume of Butane VAPOR CONVERTED FROM LIQUID STATE before expansion and is at 9.8692 atm. Pressure.<br>
As mentioned before V2 is the volume of Butane after expansion to 1.9738 atm. Pressure.<br>
And because,<br>
(Equation Removed)<br><br>
Where "ΔW" is the energy absorbed due to the expansion of compressed gas (Butane) from 9.8692 atm. to 1.9738 atm. Pressure.<br>
So,	(Equation Removed)<br><br>
Or,      ΔW = 634.57 atm. Liter / hour<br>
As, 1 atm. Liter =101 joule<br>
So,      ΔW = 64091.99 joule / hour<br>
Or,      ΔW = 64.091 K joule / hour<br>
Or,      ΔW = 15.307 KCal./hour<br>
Or,      ΔW = 60.746 BTU/Hour		    (II)<br>
So, total cooling due to expansion in volume of Propane + Butane<br>
= 744.192 (+) 60.746 BTU per hour<br>
= 804.938 BTU per hour	-—     (III)<br>
GRAND TOTAL COOLING = (IVB) + (III)<br>
= 3793.84 (+) 804.938<br>
= 4598.778 BTU PER HOUR INFERENCE<br>
TOTAL COOLING ACHIEVED DUE TO EXPANSION AND LATENT HEAT OF EVAPORATION OF L.P.G ASSUMING THAT THE RATE OF CONSUMPTION FOR RUNNING THE VEHICLE AT 100 KM. PER HOUR WILL CONSUME GAS FROM THE CYLINDER ( WHERE ONE CYLINDER CAPACITY =19 KG) RUNS VEHICLE FOR 200 KM.<br>
= 4598.778 BTU PER HOUR<br>
SALIENT POINTS<br>
a)   This Free Cooling is obtained without any load on the Engine of the vehicle, thus the process is a Green and Clean Air approach.<br><br>
b)	No additional fuel consumption is involved in the cooling of the vehicle. Larger vehicles with higher consumption will have more cooling by this process. Room air conditioners in general range from 5,000 Btu per hour to 15,000 Btu per hour. Select room air conditioners with EER of at least 9.0 for mild climates. In hot climates, select air conditioners with EER over 10.<br>
c)	The cooling equipment systems used in residential and small commercial buildings often express cooling system efficiency in terms of the Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) and/or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER). These are defined by the cooling effect in Btu (not in tons) divided by the power use in watts (not in kW) for the peak day (EER), or the seasonal average day (SEER). In the present invention the EER is immensely high as no extra power is being used by the user.<br>
d)	In one of the specific applications of the present invention, a perceptible increase in the engine life of a vehicular application will be observed. The absence of load on the vehicle's engine, due to the running of the Air Conditioner of the vehicle, will result in this.<br>
FOR C.N.G THE CALCULATIONS ARE AS BELOW A)  VOLUME CALCULATIONS<br>
1)	P1 = pressure in the C.N.G. Cylinder from the supplier = 200 bars. = 193.5682 atmosphere pressure.<br>
2)	P2 = required pressure in the Vaporizer Cylinder.  = 0.2 Mpa.  =  1.9738 atmosphere = 30 PSI.<br>
As a specific application, this minimum pressure is needed for the smooth running in the case of vehicular engines.<br>
3)	V1 = the volume of one unit of the compressed gas component of C.N.G.<br>
4)	V2 = the volume of that C.N.G. Gas component after expansion in the vaporizer.<br>
5)	(γ) = the ratio of Specific Heats (Gamma: Cp/Cv) at 1 bar and 27 degree Celsius.<br><br><br>
6)	For Methane in C.N.G. (γ)    =1.305454<br>
NTP- Normal Temperature and Pressure - is defined as air at 20 Degree C (293.15 K, 68°F) and 1 atm ( 101.325 kN/m2, 101.325 kPa, 14.7 psia, 760 mm in Hg, 760 torr) AT WHICH Density- p - OF METHANE = 0.668<br>
We do the calculations considering the C.N.G supplied for automotive purposes<br>
Assuming that Average Distance of vehicles running on C.N.G. = 15 km./Kg.<br>
Or, Distance moved by vehicle in 9 Kg. C.N.G. cylinder =135 Km. Approx.<br>
Assuming that the car/ vehicle is moving at a speed of 100 Km./ Hr.<br>
Then consumption of C.N.G. = (9÷ 135) x 100 = Kg/hour. = 6.66 Kg / Hour.<br>
Total volume of compressed gas consumed per hour from C.N.G cylinder at 193.5682 Atmosphere Pressure while running the vehicle at 100 Km per Hour = 6.66 Kg/ Hour<br>
For Methane<br>
AS,     DENSITY = MASS divided by VOLUME<br>
OR,     VOLUME = MASS divided by DENSITY<br>
AS,     DENSITY OF METHANE IN C.N.G = 0.668 Kg/cum (SEE TABLE 03)<br>
SO,     VOLUME OF 6.66 Kg. C.N.G AT NTP i.e., Normal Temperature and Pressure will be<br>
=6.66 ÷ 0.668 = 9. 97 Cu.M.			(A)<br>
NOW, VOLUME OF 6.66 Kg OF CONSUMED C.N.G AT 193.5682 ATMOSPHERE PRESSURE AS SUPPLIED FROM FILLING STATIONS WILL BE<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Or,      Vl = 0.17656 Cu.M.		(I )<br>
Where       P2 = 1.973847 atmosphere pressure P1 = 193.5682 atmosphere pressure<br><br>
V2 = 9.97 Cu. M V1= 0.17656 Cu.M<br>
γ = 1.305454<br>
Thus volume of 6.66 kg of Methane at 1.973847 atmosphere pressure (P2) Pressure is at a<br>
volume of 9.97 Cu. M and (V2) is supplied compressed to 0.17656 Cu. M (V1) volume at<br>
193.5682 atm. (P1) Pressure in the cylinder.<br>
THUS RATIO OF EXPANSION OF ONE UNIT OF GAS =<br>
9.97 ÷ 0.17656 = 56.468		(II)<br>
TEMPERATURE CALCULATIONS<br>
We do the calculations considering that the C.N.G. supplied for automotive purposes is supplied in the pressure of 193.5682 atm.<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Or,      T2 = (300.15) x(l/56.468)<br>
Or,      T2 = 87.54 degree Kelvin<br>
Or,      T2 = (-) 185.61degree Celsius.		(III)<br>
WHERE,<br>
V2 = 9.97 Cu. M<br>
V1 = 0.17656 Cu.M<br>
It is of importance to note that this low temperature (T2) in the Vaporizer is achieved without any conventional mechanical effort, in the form of compressors or coolant.<br>
LATENT HEAT OF VAPORIZATION CALCULATIONS<br>
For Methane<br>
Assuming that, as the C.N.G is in gaseous form in the cylinder so no Latent Heat of Vaporization is involved.<br>
ENDOTHERMIC EXPANSION CALCULATIONS<br>
Endothermic Energy due to expansion of compressed Methane (C.N.G.) For Methane<br><br>
Specific Gravity = 0.55 (Vapor State) at 1.9738 atm., 27 degree Celsius.<br>
Specific Gravity = 0.587 (Vapor State) at 193.5682 atm., 27 degree Celsius.<br>
So, Rate of Mass of Methane being used = 6.66 Kg/Hour<br>
Or, Volume of Methane when extracted from cylinder<br>
As calculated above,<br>
V1 = 0. 17656 Cu.M and<br>
V2 = 9.97 Cu. M<br>
Wherein, V1 is the volume of Methane before expansion at 193.5682 atm. Pressure. And V2 is the volume of Methane after expansion to 1.9738 atm. Pressure.<br>
Because,<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Where "ΔW" is the energy absorbed due to the expansion of compressed gas C.N.G in the container from 193.5682 atm. to 1.9738 atm. Pressure.<br>
Or,	(Equation Removed)<br><br>
Or,     ΔW = 47462.51 atm. Liter / hour<br>
As, 1 atm. Liter =101 joule<br>
So,    ΔW = 4793714.12 joule/hour<br>
Or,     ΔW = 4793.714 Kjoule/hour<br>
Or,     ΔW = 1144.95 K Cal. / hour<br>
Or,      ΔW = 1.331587 K Watt hour<br>
Or,      ΔW = 4543.56 BTU PER HOUR     	(I)<br>
Conclusion<br>
Total cooling achieved due to expansion of C.N.G gas assuming that Average Distance of vehicles running on C.N.G. = 15 km/Kg. And the vehicle is run at the rate of 100 Km/ hour.<br><br>
= 4543.56 BTU PER HOUR<br>
No additional fuel consumption is involved in the cooling of the vehicle. Larger vehicles with higher consumption will have more cooling by this process. Room air conditioners in general range from 5,000 Btu per hour to 15,000 Btu per hour. Select room air conditioners with EER of at least 9.0 for mild climates. In hot climates, select air conditioners with EER over 10.<br>
The said system is having applications in the restaurants where there is continuous consumption of LPG, whereby, side by side the said cooling can be utilized for cold storages. Further, the said system is also useful in vehicles driven by LPG, in such case a small cabin in a car can be provided as a refrigeration unit, whereby refreshments can be kept. Also, the cool air can be directed inside the cabin of a car or any other vehicle, by fans or blowers.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION<br>
1)	The present invention is an "OPEN SYSTEM" of refrigeration and air conditioning, unlike disclosed systems in the prior arts which are "CLOSED SYSTEMS". This implies that there is no requirement in the present invention to generate energy to recycle a refrigerant.<br>
2)	There is no extra fuel consumption associated in producing the desired operational cooling at the point where the products developed upon the invention. Thus Zero running cost of the present invention is one of the primary advantage.<br>
3)	The absence of a "compressor and condenser unit" in the products to be developed, based on the principles of the present invention, is another aspect in the embodiment of the invention. This is so because practically no extra parts are required, rather a lesser numbers of parts are used in the application of the present invention process Thus the "surprising" result is a quantum reduction in the wear and tear of conventional moving parts which operating to produce the required cooling. This signified a higher dependability and longer operational life of the products.<br>
4)	The present invention is applicable for non vehicular use such as in cold rooms and stores, refrigerators, air conditioning of places in close proximity where the alternate fuels, mentioned in the present invention, is being used.<br><br>
5)	Yet another advantage of the present invention is the quantum improvement which assists in surpassing the adherence to allowed levels of permissible emission norms laid down for air conditioning and refrigeration of appliances operated by means of conventional methods. This is so because technically there is almost zero emission associated with the products developed upon the present invention.<br>
6)	Zero operational heat emission as embodied for the systems based on present invention is another "surprising" result. This inherent absence of heat emission, while air conditioning or refrigerating an enclosure, is an immensely "surprising" element of the present invention.<br>
7)	Another "surprising" advantage of the present invention is the absence of noise levels while the process of the present invention is operational. The absence of moving parts is the reason for this reduction in noise levels. Another pertinent "surprising" result, in the case of vehicular as well as non vehicular application of the invention, is the improvement in the energy efficiency levels of the engines and appliances. This is associated to the reduction in loading on the engine to run the air conditioner compressor assembly.<br>
8)	One of the most pertinent and "surprising" results of the present invention is the absence of the "Global warming Potential" due to air conditioning of the vehicles. This is a welcome surprise of the present invention on a Global level. With the World facing the threat due to global warming attributed to many factors. Prominent among which are air conditioning, refrigeration and vehicular emissions due to their motor exhausts, and system operations. This global warming is attributed to the air conditioning of vehicles, their enhanced emissions thereof, refrigerator operations, in addition to providing transportation. It is also pertinent from the point of view of non vehicular applications too, as the refrigerants used in the present invention are "green, environment friendly" in nature.<br>
9)	The present invention is the process which seeks to harness the potential captive energy available in the fuel itself. The invention is independent of the conventional processes of initially generating energy to run a compressor-condenser assembly, or heating a saturated reactant, by consuming fuel, and then consume this generated energy.<br><br>
10)	Instead of wastefully splurging the available potential captive energy available in the fuel itself, as has been done till now, it utilizes this captive energy by tapped it profitably to produce desired results.<br>
11)	The present invention is extremely energy efficient, in comparison to the conventional methods adopted. The present invention is that the heat energy extracted from the space being thermally refrigerated or air-conditioned. The heat extracted from the space under consideration is not dissipated in the immediate surrounding of the appliances developed on the basis of this invention.<br>
12)	The problem of high temperature refrigerant, entering into the compressor assembly of a conventional system, adversely affects its durability and destroys the rubber members inside the discharge portion of the compressor. The said problem is not faced in the present invention. The products developed on the principles of the present invention shall be sturdier and more dependable.<br>

Table 02 LPG Review<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is a petroleum derived, colorless gas, typically comprised of mainly propane, butane, or a combination of these two constituents. LPG fuel for vehicles is actually a mixture of various hydrocarbons which are gases at atmospheric pressure and temperature but which liquefy at higher pressures like less than 200 psi. LPG is a natural derivative of both natural gas and crude oil.<br>
Commercially three different grades of LPG are available, Table 1. Standard HD5 requires minimum propane content of 90 % and propylene content of less than 5 % (volume basis).<br>
Table 1. Composition of LPG Types<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
*PPMW: Particles per million by weight fraction.<br>
The remainder is normally n-butane, with isobutane and butanes also present. The limitation on propylene and other unsaturated hydrocarbons (olefins) results from their low octane number, which means low knock resistance, Table 2.<br>
