EIGHT SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/908,814 filed on March 29, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The invention relates generally to a multiple speed automatic<br>
transmission having a plurality of planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque<br>
transmitting devices and more particularly to an eight speed automatic<br>
transmission having four planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting<br>
devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical multiple speed automatic transmission uses a<br>
combination of friction clutches, planetary gear arrangements and fixed<br>
interconnections to achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical<br>
arrangement of the planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging,<br>
cost and desired speed ratios.<br>
1<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001151-PTT-DLT<br>
[0005] While current automatic transmissions achieve their intended<br>
purpose, the need for new and improved transmission configurations which<br>
exhibit improved performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency,<br>
responsiveness and smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced<br>
size and weight, is essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an<br>
improved, cost-effective, compact multiple speed automatic transmission.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0024] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0025] At the outset, it should be appreciated that in the particular<br>
example provided, the eight speed automatic transmission of the present<br>
invention has an arrangement of permanent mechanical connections between<br>
the members of the four planetary gear sets. These permanent mechanical<br>
connections relate the transmission embodiments. More specifically, a first<br>
component or member of a first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a<br>
first component or member of a second planetary gear set. A second component<br>
or member of the first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a second<br>
component or member of a second planetary gear set. A first component or<br>
8<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001151-PTT-DLT<br>
member of the second planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a first<br>
component or member of a third planetary gear set. A third component or<br>
member of the second planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a third<br>
component or member of a fourth planetary gear set. Finally, a second<br>
component or member of the third planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a<br>
second component or member of the fourth planetary gear set.<br>
[0026] Referring now to FIG. 1, a first embodiment of an eight speed<br>
automatic transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever<br>
diagram is a schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device<br>
such as an automatic transmission. Each individual lever represents a planetary<br>
gear set wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary gear<br>
are each represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes:<br>
one for the sun gear, one for the planet gear carrier, and one for the ring gear.<br>
The relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the<br>
ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gearset. These lever ratios, in turn, are used<br>
to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to achieve an appropriate<br>
ratios and ratio progression. Mechanical couplings or interconnections between<br>
the nodes of the various planetary gear sets are illustrated by thin, horizontal<br>
lines and torque transmitting devices such as clutches and brakes are presented<br>
as interleaved fingers. If the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is<br>
grounded. Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams<br>
can be found in SAE Paper 810102, which is hereby fully incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>

Attorney Docket No. P001151-PTT-DLT<br>
[0027] The automatic transmission 10 includes an input shaft or<br>
member 12, a first planetary gear set 14 having three nodes: a first node 14A, a<br>
second node 14B and a third node 14C, a second planetary gear set 16 having<br>
three nodes: a first node 16A, a second node 16B and a third node 16C, a third<br>
planetary gear set 18 having three nodes: a first node 18A, a second node 18B<br>
and a third node 18C, a fourth planetary gear set 20 having three nodes: a first<br>
node 20A, a second node 20B and a third node 20C and an output shaft or<br>
member 22. The first node 14A of the first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to a<br>
first node 16A of the second planetary gear set 16. The first node 16A of the<br>
second planetary gear set 16 is also coupled to the first node 18A of the third<br>
planetary gear set 18. The second node 14B of the first planetary gear set 14 is<br>
coupled to the second node 16B of the second planetary gear set 16. The third<br>
node 16C of the second planetary gear set 16 is coupled to the third node 20C of<br>
the fourth planetary gear set 20. The second node 18B of the third planetary<br>
gear set 18 is coupled to the second node 20B of the fourth planetary gear set<br>
20.<br>
[0028] The input shaft or member 12 is coupled to the second node<br>
18B of the third planetary gear set 18 and the second node 20B of the fourth<br>
planetary gear set 20. The output shaft or member 22 is coupled to the first<br>

connects the input shaft or member 12 to the third node 14C of the first planetary<br>
gear set 14 and a first brake 32 selectively connects the third node 14C of the<br>
first planetary gear set 14 to ground or transmission housing 40. A second clutch<br>
10<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001151-PTT-DLT<br>
28 selectively connects the first node 16A of the second planetary gear set 16 to<br>
the first node 20A of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A second brake 34<br>
selectively connects the second node 14B of the first planetary gear set 14 to<br>
ground or transmission housing 40 and a third brake 36 selectively connects the<br>
third node 18C of the third planetary gear set 18 to ground or transmission<br>
housing 40.<br>
[0029] Referring now to Figure 2, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of the first embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 according to<br>
the present invention. In Figure 2, the numbering from the lever diagram of<br>
Figure 1 is carried over. The clutches, brakes and couplings are correspondingly<br>
presented whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now appear as<br>
components of planetary gear sets such a sun gears, ring gears, planet gears<br>
and planet gear carriers. The transmission 10 includes the input shaft or<br>
member 12 which is coupled to and directly drives a third planet carrier 18B of<br>
the third planetary gear set 18. The third planet carrier 18B includes a plurality of<br>
planet gears 18D rotatably disposed thereon. Each of the planet pinions of the<br>
plurality of planet gears 18D mesh with both the sun gear 18C and the ring gear<br>
18A. The input shaft or member 12 also is coupled to and directly drives a fourth<br>
sun gear 20B of the fourth planetary gear set 20. The output shaft or member 22<br>
is coupled to and driven by a planet gear carrier 20A which includes a plurality of<br>
planet gears 20D rotatably disposed thereon. Each of the planet pinions of<br>
plurality of planet gears 20D mesh with both the sun gear 20B and the ring gear<br>
20C.<br>
11<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001151-PTT-DLT<br>
[0030] A first shaft or interconnecting member 42 couples the first<br>
brake 32 to a first planet gear carrier 14C of the first planetary gear set 14 and<br>
the first clutch 26. First brake 32 selectively couples first planet gear carrier 14C<br>
of the first planetary gear set 14 to ground or transmission housing 40. The first<br>
planet carrier 14C includes a plurality of planet gears 14D rotatably disposed<br>
thereon. Each of the planet pinions of plurality of planet gears 14D mesh with<br>
both the sun gear 14B and the ring gear 14A. The first clutch 26 selectively<br>
interconnects the interconnecting member 42 and the first planet gear carrier<br>
14C with the third planet gear carrier 18B. A second shaft or interconnecting<br>
member 44 couples the second brake 34 to a first sun gear 14B of the first<br>
planetary gear set 14. The second interconnecting member 44 also couples the<br>
first sun gear 14B and the second brake 34 to a second ring gear 16B of the<br>
second planetary gear set 16. The second brake 34 selectively couples first sun<br>
gear 14B of the first planetary gear set 14 and second ring gear 16B of the<br>
second planetary gear set 16 to ground or transmission housing 40. A third shaft<br>
or interconnecting member 46 couples the third brake 36 to a third sun gear 18C<br>
of the third planetary gear set 18. The third brake 36 selectively couples third<br>
sun gear 18C of the third planetary gear set 18 to ground or transmission<br>
housing 40. A fourth shaft or interconnecting member 48 interconnects a first<br>
ring gear 14A of the first planetary gear set 14, a third ring gear 18A of the third<br>
planetary gear set 18, a second sun gear 16A of the second planetary gear set<br>
16 and the second clutch 28. The second clutch 28 selectively interconnects the<br>
fourth interconnecting member 48 with the fourth planet carrier 20A of the fourth<br>
12<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001151-PTT-DLT<br>
planetary gear set 20 and the output shaft or member 22. Finally, a fifth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 52 couples the second planet carrier 16C of the second<br>
planetary gear set 16 to a fourth ring gear 20C of the fourth planetary gear set<br>
20. The second planet carrier 16C includes a plurality of planet gears 16D<br>
rotatably disposed thereon. Each of the planet pinions of plurality of planet gears<br>
16D mesh with both the sun gear 16A and the ring gear 16B.<br>
[0031] Referring now to Figures 2 and 3, the operation of the first<br>
embodiment of the eight speed automatic transmission 10 will be described. It<br>
will be appreciated that the automatic transmission 10 is capable of transmitting<br>
torque from the input shaft or member 12 to the output shaft or member 22 in<br>
eight forward speed or torque ratios and one reverse speed or torque ratio.<br>
Each forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of<br>
one or more of the clutches or brakes as will be explained below. Figure 3 is a<br>
truth table presenting the various combinations of clutches and brakes that are<br>
activated or engaged to achieve the various gear states. Actual numerical gear<br>
ratios of the various gear states are also presented although it should be<br>
appreciated that these numerical values are exemplary only and that they may<br>
be adjusted over significant ranges to accommodate various applications and<br>
operational criteria of the automatic transmission 10.<br>
[0032] To establish reverse gear, the first brake 32 and the third brake<br>
36 are engaged or activated. The first brake 32 grounds the first planet carrier<br>
14C of the first planetary gear set 14 and the third brake 36 grounds the third sun<br>
13<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001151-PTT-DLT<br>
gear 18C of the third planetary gear set 18. Likewise, the eight forward ratios are<br>
achieved through different combinations of clutch engagement as per Figure 3<br>
[0033] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the eight speed automatic transmission 10 assumes, first of<br>
all, that all clutches and brakes not specifically referenced in a given gear state<br>
are inactive or disengaged and, second of all, that during gear shifts, i.e.,<br>
changes of gear state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or brake<br>
engaged or activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
[0034] Turning now to Figure 4, a lever diagram for a second<br>
embodiment of an eight speed automatic transmission 100 is illustrated. The<br>
automatic transmission 100 includes an input shaft or member 112, a first<br>

17<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001151-PTT-DLT<br>
torque from the input shaft or member 112 to the output shaft or member 122 in<br>
eight forward speed or torque ratios and one reverse speed or torque ratio.<br>
Each forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of<br>
one or more of the clutches or brakes as will be explained below. Figure 6 is a<br>
truth table presenting the various combinations of clutches and brakes that are<br>
activated or engaged to achieve the various gear states. Actual numerical gear<br>
ratios of the various gear states are also presented although it should be<br>
appreciated that these numerical values are exemplary only and that they may<br>
be adjusted over significant ranges to accommodate various applications and<br>
operational criteria of the automatic transmission 100.<br>
[0040] To establish reverse gear, the second brake 134 and the first<br>
clutch 126 are activated or engaged. The second brake 134 grounds the first<br>
carrier 114B of the first planetary gear set 114 and the second ring gear 116B of<br>
the second planetary gear set 116. The first clutch 126 interconnects the input<br>
shaft or member 112 with the second planet carrier 116A of the second planetary<br>
gear set 116. Likewise, the eight forward ratios are achieved through different<br>
combinations of clutch engagement as per Figure 6.<br>
[0041] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the eight speed automatic transmission 100 assumes, first of<br>
all, that all clutches and brakes not specifically referenced in a given gear state<br>
are inactive or disengaged and, second of all, that during gear shifts, i.e.,<br>
changes of gear state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or brake<br>
engaged or activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
