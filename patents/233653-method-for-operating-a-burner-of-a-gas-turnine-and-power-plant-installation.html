				<td>Method for operating a burner of a gas turbine, and<br>
power plant installation<br>
The invention relates to a method for operating a<br>
burner of a gas turbine, in which a fossil fuel is<br>
gasified in a gasification device and gasified fuel is<br>
fed as synthesis gas to the burner assigned to the gas<br>
turbine in order to be burnt. The invention also<br>
relates to a power plant installation, in particular<br>
for carrying out the method, having a gas turbine which<br>
is assigned a combustion chamber having at least one<br>
burner. Upstream of the combustion chamber there is a<br>
fuel system, which comprises a gasification device for<br>
fossil fuel and a gas line which branches off from the<br>
gasification device and opens out into the combustion<br>
chamber.<br>
A gas and steam turbine installation with integrated<br>
gasification of fossil fuel usually comprises a<br>
gasification device for the fuel, which on the outlet<br>
side is connected to the combustion chamber of the gas<br>
turbine via a number of components provided for gas<br>
purification purposes. A heat recovery steam generator,<br>
the heating surfaces of which are connected into the<br>
water-steam circuit of a steam turbine, may be<br>
connected downstream of the gas turbine on the flue gas<br>
side. An installation of this type is known, for<br>
example, from GB-A 2 234 984 or US 4,697,415.<br>
To reduce the emission of pollutants during the<br>
combustion of the gasified fossil fuel or synthesis<br>
gas, a saturator, in which the synthesis gas is laden<br>
with steam when the installation is operating, may be<br>
connected into the gas line. For this purpose, the<br>
gasified fuel flows through the saturator in<br>
countercurrent to a flow of water which is passed<br>
through a water circuit referred to as the saturator<br>
circuit. To achieve a particularly high level of<br>
efficiency, there is provision for<br>
heat from the water-steam circuit of a gas and steam<br>
turbine installation to be introduced into the<br>
saturator circuit.<br>
As a result of contact with the heated flow of water<br>
guided in the saturator circuit in the saturator, the<br>
gasified fuel is saturated with steam and is heated to<br>
a limited extent. For thermal reasons and also for<br>
operating reasons, it may be necessary to further heat<br>
the fuel before it is fed into the combustion chamber<br>
of the gas turbine.<br>
DE 19 832 293 Al has described a gas and steam turbine<br>
installation having a heat recovery steam generator<br>
connected downstream of the gas turbine on the flue gas<br>
side. The heating surfaces of the heat recovery steam<br>
generator are in this case connected into the<br>
water-steam circuit of the steam turbine. A<br>
gasification device for fuel is connected upstream of<br>
the combustion chamber, via a fuel line, for the<br>
purpose of integrated gasification of a fossil fuel for<br>
the combustion chamber. To achieve a particularly high<br>
efficiency in the installation, the fuel line, between<br>
the gasification device and the saturator, includes, in<br>
addition to a mixing device for admixing nitrogen, a<br>
heat exchanger on the primary side, which on the<br>
secondary side is likewise connected into the fuel<br>
line, between the saturator and the combustion chamber.<br>
A similar gas and steam turbine installation to that<br>
described in DE 19 832 293 Al is disclosed by<br>
WO 00/20728. It is intended for it to be possible for<br>
the gas and steam turbine installation described in<br>
that document to be operated with a particularly high<br>
level of efficiency even when oil is used as fossil<br>
fuel.<br>
For this purpose, in WO/20728, a heat exchanger is<br>
connected into the fuel line on the primary side,<br>
upstream of a mixing device for admixing nitrogen to<br>
the gasified fuel, as seen in the direction of flow of<br>
the gasified fuel, which heat exchanger, on the<br>
secondary side, is designed as an evaporator for a flow<br>
medium.<br>
On the steam side, the heat exchanger is connected to<br>
the combustion chamber of the gas turbine.<br>
To ensure particularly reliable operation of the gas<br>
and steam turbine installation, it should be possible<br>
for a feed of the synthesis gas into the combustion<br>
chamber of the gas turbine to be stopped at any time.<br>
For this purpose, a quick-closing fitting should<br>
usually be connected into the gas line upstream of the<br>
combustion chamber. When required, the quick-closing<br>
fitting blocks off the gas line within a particularly<br>
short time, so that it is impossible for any synthesis<br>
gas to enter the combustion chamber assigned to the gas<br>
turbine.<br>
On account of the relevant safety regulations, the fuel<br>
system usually comprises a gas lock. A gas lock<br>
comprises. two fittings, for example ball valves, which<br>
can be opened or closed to a flow of gas. An<br>
intermediate relief or a pressure line is connected in<br>
between these two fittings. The intermediate relief may<br>
be connected to an excess gas burner, via which excess<br>
gas can be burnt off. As an alternative to the<br>
intermediate relief, the pressure line can be connected<br>
up, ensuring that it is impossible for any gas to flow<br>
in via the gas lock fittings. The gas lock therefore<br>
separates the fuel system in gastight manner in a first<br>
region or the gasification system upstream of the gas<br>
lock and in a second region or what is known as the gas<br>
turbine fuel system downstream of the gas lock.<br>
A gas and steam turbine installation with gasification<br>
device can be operated both with the synthesis gas,<br>
which is generated, for example, from coal, industrial<br>
residues or garbage, and with a second fuel, such as<br>
for example natural gas or oil. In the event of a<br>
changeover from synthesis gas to second fuel or vice<br>
versa, it is for safety reasons necessary for the<br>
region between the gas lock and the combustion chamber,<br>
i.e. the gas turbine fuel system, to be purged with an<br>
inert medium, such as nitrogen or steam.<br>
To allow a gas and steam turbine installation to be<br>
optionally operated with the synthesis gas from a<br>
gasification device or a second or substitute fuel, the<br>
burner in the combustion chamber assigned to the gas<br>
turbine has to be designed as a two-fuel or multi-fuel<br>
burner, to which both the synthesis gas and the second<br>
fuel, e.g. natural gas or fuel oil, can be fed<br>
according to the particular requirements. The<br>
corresponding fuel is in this case supplied to the<br>
combustion zone via a fuel passage in the burner.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a method<br>
for operating a burner of a gas turbine which makes it<br>
possible to achieve improved synthesis gas operation. A<br>
further object of the invention is to provide a power<br>
plant installation, in particular for carrying out the<br>
method.<br>
According to the invention, the first object mentioned<br>
is achieved by a method for operating a burner of a gas<br>
turbine, in which a fossil fuel is gasified, and<br>
gasified fossil fuel is fed as synthesis gas to the<br>
burner assigned to the gas turbine in order to be<br>
burnt, in which method the synthesis gas is divided<br>
into a first part-stream and a second part-stream, and<br>
the part-streams are fed separately to the burner in<br>
order to be burnt.<br>
In this case, according to the invention it is also<br>
quite possible to provide more than two part-streams<br>
and for these part-streams in each case to be fed<br>
separately to the burner in order to be burnt.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the observation<br>
that the overall efficiency of power plant<br>
installations, for example of gas and steam turbine<br>
installations with integrated gasification of a fossil<br>
fuel, deteriorates the higher the fuel-side pressure<br>
loss becomes in the burner to which the fuel is fed in<br>
order to be burnt. The pressure loss is in this case<br>
defined by the flow resistance or the flow conductance<br>
of the burner for the corresponding fuel gas.<br>
When a gas flows through a line, the pressure<br>
difference which occurs is proportional to the gas<br>
flow, i.e. the mass flow of gas. The proportionality<br>
factor is known as the flow resistance. The reciprocal<br>
of the flow resistance is known as the flow<br>
conductance. On account of the efficiency<br>
considerations for a power plant installation referred<br>
to above, it is necessary for this burner pressure loss<br>
in design situations, e.g. at nominal load, to be<br>
minimized. However, the result of this is that at very<br>
low gas turbine powers or when the gas turbine is<br>
idling, the burner pressure loss on the fuel side is<br>
too low and the combustion is no longer sufficiently<br>
stable with respect to flame oscillations. Therefore,<br>
for installation designs of this nature, output<br>
operation in the synthesis gas mode is only possible<br>
between base load and a minimum partial load of the gas<br>
turbine, which is dependent on the prevailing<br>
conditions.<br>
The invention now provides a completely new way of<br>
operating the burner of a gas turbine with synthesis<br>
gas, with the fuel gas which is formed from the<br>
gasification of a fossil fuel and has a low calorific<br>
value compared to natural gas being fed to the burner<br>
in at least two separate part-streams in order to be<br>
burnt. This considerably widens the bandwidth of the<br>
fuel mass flow which can be set within the permissible<br>
range for the fuel-side burner pressure loss, with the<br>
result that lower fuel mass flows are possible in<br>
particular compared to conventional burner operation.<br>
Dividing the synthesis gas into a first part-stream and<br>
a second, separate part-stream or optionally into<br>
further part-streams allows fuel to be fed to the<br>
burner at correspondingly spatially different locations<br>
in order to be burnt. Accordingly, two or more<br>
combustion zones are formed, which are assigned to a<br>
corresponding part-stream of synthesis gas.<br>
This advantageously avoids combustion instability<br>
resulting from fuel-side burner pressure losses being<br>
too low<br>
in synthesis gas mode. Furthermore, possibly complex<br>
design modifications to the burner to adapt to<br>
synthesis gas operation, in particular with a view to<br>
avoiding burner or combustion chamber humming, in the<br>
future can be avoided. Compared with operation with<br>
just one synthesis gas passage, feeding synthesis gas<br>
to the burner in at least two part-streams makes it<br>
possible in general terms to achieve improved options<br>
by adjusting and optimizing the operating mode of the<br>
burner. In this context, it has proven particularly<br>
advantageous that the combustion of the synthesis gas<br>
in the burner can be deliberately adjusted and<br>
optimized by adjusting the part-streams in a very<br>
efficient way to the desired operating mode of the<br>
burner, e.g. base load or part-load or idling. The<br>
widened range of possible operating settings makes it<br>
easier to match the system to altered fuel boundary<br>
conditions.<br>
This new operating mode allows stepped synthesis gas<br>
operation. This firstly allows a sufficiently low<br>
pressure loss across the burner in full-load operation<br>
with correspondingly significant mass flows in all the<br>
part-streams, in particular the first and second<br>
part-streams, and secondly also allows a gas turbine<br>
assigned to the burner to be operated at minimal load<br>
or in idling mode with only one significant part-stream<br>
of synthesis gas. In this case, the first part-stream<br>
or if appropriate further part-streams and the second<br>
part-stream can advantageously be subject to different<br>
flow conductances as they flow separately through the<br>
burner and into a respective combustion zone, with the<br>
result that, given a predetermined range of variation<br>
in the fuel mass flow, a significantly reduced range of<br>
variation in the pressure loss in the burner is<br>
achieved compared to when only one synthesis gas stream<br>
is used. As a result, the pressure loss in the burner<br>
at base load of the gas turbine compared to the<br>
pressure loss at minimum load, e.g. in idling mode, is<br>
advantageously lower than with a single-stream concept<br>
using the same design of burner.<br>
In one preferred configuration, the first part-stream<br>
and the second part-stream are in each case fed to the<br>
burner in a controlled manner. This configuration makes<br>
it possible to control the part-streams independently<br>
of one another, so that the operating bandwidth of the<br>
burner is widened, in this case it is possible, for<br>
example, to select an operating mode in which the<br>
overall mass flow of synthesis gas is kept constant,<br>
with the first part-stream and the second part-stream<br>
being matched to one another with regard to the<br>
combustion power which can be achieved and to stable<br>
operation.<br>
It is preferable for natural gas or steam to be admixed<br>
to at least one of the part-streams in order to alter<br>
the calorific value. Depending on the particular<br>
requirements, the calorific value of a part-stream can<br>
be increased or reduced by admixing natural gas or<br>
steam. It is advantageously possible for both<br>
part-streams to be inerted independently of one another<br>
by the application of steam or another inerting medium,<br>
such as for example nitrogen. Therefore, the calorific<br>
value can be set for both part-streams of synthesis<br>
gas, and in particular the calorific value of the<br>
part-streams can be set differently, with the result<br>
that a correspondingly different conversion of heat by<br>
combustion can be achieved in the corresponding<br>
combustion zone. This advantageously provides a further<br>
degree of freedom, namely the calorific value, it being<br>
possible for this calorific value to be set<br>
individually for each of the part-steams of synthesis<br>
gas according to the particular requirements.<br>
It is preferable for the part-streams to be set as a<br>
function of the power which is to be produced by the<br>
gas turbine. In the method for operating a burner of a<br>
gas turbine with the synthesis gas, it has proven<br>
particularly advantageous for the part-streams, i.e. in<br>
particular their particular level of the gas mass flow<br>
or their particular specific calorific value, to be<br>
controlled as a function of the power to be produced by<br>
the gas turbine. In this case, by way of example, the<br>
power of the gas turbine can be predetermined at a set<br>
value which is common to all the fuel passages,<br>
and the gas flows for each passage can be adjusted<br>
independently according to the set value in a<br>
downstream control circuit as a function of the<br>
requirements described above, e.g. in a closed-loop<br>
control circuit.<br>
In the event of minimum-load or idling operation of the<br>
gas turbine, it is preferable for one of the<br>
part-streams to be zero. This operating mode can<br>
therefore be realized by delivering a part-stream of<br>
synthesis gas to the burner. For this purpose, it is<br>
advantageous for that one of the part-streams which, in<br>
view of a required minimum pressure loss therefor, can<br>
achieve a corresponding flow resistance as it flows<br>
through the burner to the combustion zone, to be<br>
selected for the minimum-load or idling mode of the gas<br>
turbine. In the event of a significant flow resistance,<br>
combustion instability, for example on account of the<br>
pressure drop being too low across the burner, can be<br>
avoided even with a low mass flow of the selected<br>
part-stream of synthesis gas.<br>
According to the invention, the object relating to a<br>
power plant installation is achieved by a power plant<br>
installation, in particular for carrying out the method<br>
described above, having a gas turbine, which is<br>
assigned a combustion chamber having at least one<br>
burner, and having a fuel system, which is connected<br>
upstream of the combustion chamber and comprises a<br>
gasification device for fossil fuel and a gas line<br>
which branches off from the gasification device and<br>
opens out into the combustion chamber, in which<br>
installation a further gas line branches off from the<br>
gas line upstream of the combustion chamber, the gas<br>
line being connected to a first fuel passage of the<br>
burner and the further gas line being connected to a<br>
second fuel passage, which is separated in terms of<br>
flow from the first fuel passage, of the burner.<br>
In this case, it is advantageously possible for a<br>
second fuel passage, which is already present at the<br>
burner and is usually designed as a passage<br>
for natural gas with a high calorific value of<br>
typically 40,000 kJ/kg to additionally be used a second<br>
synthesis gas passage, which in flow terms is arranged<br>
from the first fuel passage. Therefore, the burner of<br>
the power plant installation has two fuel passages for<br>
synthesis gas which is provided in the gasification<br>
device by gasification of the fossil fuel and can be<br>
fed separately, via the gas line and the further gas<br>
line, to the fuel passage respectively connected<br>
thereto. The flow conductance for synthesis gas may be<br>
different for the first fuel passage and the second<br>
fuel passage, with the result that a stepped, in<br>
particular two-stage, supply of fuel is achieved by<br>
targeted application of a respective part-steam of<br>
synthesis gas to the fuel passages. As a result, the<br>
power plant installation is designed especially for the<br>
combustion of fuel gas with a low calorific value, e.g.<br>
originating from the gasification of coal as a fossil<br>
fuel. The stepped supply of synthesis gas<br>
advantageously widens the bandwidth of the fuel mass<br>
flow which can be set within the permissible range of<br>
the fuel-side burner pressure loss in synthesis gas<br>
mode, and in this way the burner pressure loss in<br>
full-load operation can be minimized or at least<br>
substantially reduced.<br>
In a preferred configuration, a control fitting, by<br>
means of which the flow of fuel in the associated fuel<br>
passages can in each case be controlled, is provided in<br>
both the gas line and the further gas line. The gas<br>
lines having the control fittings for synthesis gas are<br>
in this case connected in parallel, so that each<br>
fitting controls the corresponding part-stream passing<br>
to its associated fuel passage.<br>
It is preferable for a gas lock, which is arranged<br>
upstream of the location where the further gas line<br>
branches off from the gas line, to be connected into<br>
the gas line.<br>
This on the one hand ensures the gas lock function and<br>
on the other hand reduces the number of shut-off and<br>
control fittings. A quick-closing or tightly sealing<br>
fitting is advantageously provided in the gas line<br>
upstream of the location where the further gas line<br>
branches off from the gas line.<br>
The power plant installation with gasification device<br>
can be operated both with the synthesis gas, which is<br>
generated, for example, from coal or residual oil, and<br>
with a second fuel, such as for example natural gas. In<br>
the event of a changeover from synthesis gas to second<br>
fuel or vice versa, it is for safety reasons necessary<br>
for the area between the gas lock and the combustion<br>
chamber, i.e. the gas turbine fuel system, to be purged<br>
with an inert medium, such as nitrogen or steam. In the<br>
power plant installation, this requirement can be met,<br>
for example, by the gas lock which is connected into<br>
the gas line and is arranged upstream of the combustion<br>
chamber comprising a quick-closing fitting, a<br>
pressure-relief or excess-pressure system and a gas<br>
lock fitting. As a result, in the event of a change in<br>
the gas which is to be fed to the burner of the gas<br>
turbine, it is possible to ensure that the synthesis<br>
gas or the second fuel as well as any flue gas is<br>
displaced out of the fuel system in a particularly<br>
reliable way, since the volume to be purged is<br>
relatively small. Moreover, if the volume to be purged<br>
is small, a purge in just one direction via both fuel<br>
passages has proven sufficient, with the result that<br>
complex control mechanisms for the purge operation can<br>
be eliminated. In the event of a changeover to a second<br>
fuel, e.g. natural gas, there is no need to purge the<br>
further gas line and the associated fuel passage. It is<br>
only necessary for both fuel passages, or if<br>
appropriate a plurality of fuel passages, to be purged<br>
in the event of a quick closure of the gas turbine.<br>
The purge advantageously takes place only in the<br>
forward direction, i.e. in the direction of the<br>
combustion chamber or of the<br>
burner of the gas turbine. The purge operation may be<br>
carried out alternatively using steam or nitrogen, e.g.<br>
pure nitrogen. On account of the small volume which has<br>
to be purged, a purge using nitrogen is particularly<br>
economical. Furthermore, in this case there is no need<br>
for any steam to be extracted from a steam turbine<br>
installation arranged in the power plant installation,<br>
for the purge operation, making the overall efficiency<br>
of the power plant installation particularly high. In<br>
addition, there is no need to use high-alloy steels,<br>
since at most a small amount of corrosion can occur. A<br>
small volume to be purged can be achieved in the power<br>
plant installation by means of compact arrangement of<br>
the components. For example, if the gas lock and the<br>
quick-closing fitting are arranged next to one another,<br>
the quick-closing fitting can perform the function of<br>
one of the fittings provided in the gas lock, so that<br>
this fitting can be dispensed with and the volume of<br>
the gas turbine fuel system which has to be purged can<br>
be made particularly small. Furthermore, the relatively<br>
small volume of the fuel system makes load shedding in<br>
the event of an excessive speed considerably simpler,<br>
in particular on account of the reduced lag effect in<br>
the gas-carrying components.<br>
Ball valves or ball cocks are customarily used as<br>
fittings for the gas lock which is arranged in<br>
particular upstream of the location where the further<br>
gas line branches off from the gas line and is<br>
connected into the gas line. These ball valves have<br>
particularly good gas-sealing properties. The<br>
quick-closing fitting may, for example, be designed as<br>
a quick-closing flap. However, depending on the overall<br>
size of the fitting, it is also possible for any other<br>
quick-closing fitting, such as for example a suitable<br>
quick-closing valve, to be used for this purpose.<br>
Therefore, the power plant installation having the<br>
gasification device can be operated particularly<br>
reliably in synthesis gas mode or in the event of a<br>
change of fuel to a second fuel.<br>
In one preferred configuration of the power plant<br>
installation, natural gas or steam can be delivered to<br>
the further gas line via a feed<br>
device. The further gas line, which is connected to the<br>
second fuel passage of the burner, can be adjusted with<br>
regard to the calorific value for operation of the<br>
second fuel passage as a result of natural gas or steam<br>
being admixed to the synthesis gas. Admixing natural<br>
gas to the synthesis gas increases the calorific value.<br>
On the other hand, the calorific value can be reduced<br>
by admixing steam to the synthesis gas. Targeted<br>
admixing of natural gas or steam via the feed device<br>
allows the calorific value to be very accurately<br>
matched to the desired operating mode of the burner.<br>
Synthesis gas, which has been formed in particular by<br>
gasification of a fossil fuel in the gasification<br>
device, can preferably fed to the further gas line.<br>
Therefore, synthesis gas, natural gas, steam or a<br>
mixture of various fuels can be fed to the further gas<br>
line in a targeted fashion as required.<br>
The power plant installation is preferably configured<br>
as a gas and steam turbine installation, having a heat<br>
recovery steam generator which is connected downstream<br>
of the gas turbine on the flue gas side and the heating<br>
surfaces of which are connected into the water-steam<br>
circuit of a steam turbine.<br>
Further advantages of the power plant installation will<br>
emerge by analogy to the advantages of the method<br>
described above for operating a burner of a gas<br>
turbine.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is explained<br>
in more detail with reference to a drawing, in which,<br>
in some cases diagrammatically and not to scale:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a power plant installation in which a<br>
fuel system having a gasification device is<br>
connected upstream of the gas turbine, and<br>
Fig. 2 shows an exert corresponding to Fig. 1 with an<br>
associated burner of the gas turbine.<br>
The power plant installation 3 shown in Figure 1 is<br>
designed as a gas and steam turbine installation 1 and<br>
comprises a gas turbine installation la and a steam<br>
turbine installation lb. The gas turbine installation<br>
la comprises a gas turbine 2 with an air compressor 4<br>
coupled to it and a combustion chamber 6, which is<br>
connected upstream of the gas turbine • 2 and is<br>
connected to a compressed-air line 8 of the compressor<br>
4. The combustion chamber 6 includes a burner 7. The<br>
gas turbine 2 and the air compressor 4 as well as a<br>
generator 10 are arranged on a common shaft 12.<br>
The steam turbine installation lb comprises a steam<br>
turbine 20 with a generator 22 coupled to it and also,<br>
in a water-steam circuit 24, a condenser 26 connected<br>
downstream of the steam turbine 20 and a heat recovery<br>
steam generator 30. The steam turbine 20 comprises a<br>
first pressure stage or a high-pressure part 20a and a<br>
second pressure stage or a medium-pressure part 20b.<br>
There is also a third pressure stage or a low-pressure<br>
part 20c of the steam turbine 20, the pressure stages<br>
20a, 20b, 20c driving the generator 22 via a common<br>
shaft 32.<br>
An exhaust-gas line 34 is connected to an inlet 30a of<br>
the heat recovery steam generator 30 for the purpose of<br>
feeding working medium AM, which has been expanded in<br>
the gas turbine 2, or flue gas into the heat recovery<br>
steam generator 30. The expanded working medium AM from<br>
the gas turbine 2 leaves the heat recovery steam<br>
generator 30 via its outlet 30b in the direction of a<br>
stack (not shown in more detail).<br>
The heat recovery steam generator 30 comprises a<br>
condensate preheater 40, which on the inlet side is<br>
connected via a condensate line 42 into the one<br>
condensate pump unit 4 4 and can be fed with condensate<br>
K from the condenser 26. On the outlet side, the<br>
condensate preheater 40 is connected, via a line 45, to<br>
a<br>
feedwater tank 46. Moreover, to allow the condensate<br>
preheater 40 to be bypassed if necessary, the<br>
condensate line 42 can be connected directly to the<br>
feedwater tank 46 via a bypass line (not shown) . The<br>
feedwater tank 46 is connected via a line 47 to a<br>
high-pressure feed pump 48 with medium-pressure<br>
removal.<br>
The high-pressure feed pump 48 brings the feedwater S<br>
flowing out of the feedwater tank 46 to a pressure<br>
level which is suitable for a high-pressure stage 50,<br>
assigned to the high-pressure part 20a of the steam<br>
turbine 20, in the water-steam circuit 24. The<br>
high-pressure feedwater S can be fed to the<br>
high-pressure stage 50 via a feedwater preheater 52,<br>
which on the output side is connected to a<br>
high-pressure drum 58 via a feedwater line 56 which can<br>
be shut off by means of a valve 54. The high-pressure<br>
drum 58 is connected to a high-pressure evaporator 60<br>
arranged in the heat recovery steam generator 30 in<br>
order to form a water-steam cycle 62. To discharge live<br>
steam F, the high-pressure drum 58 is connected to a<br>
high-pressure superheater 64 which is arranged in the<br>
heat recovery steam generator 30 and on the outlet side<br>
is connected to the steam inlet 66 of the high-pressure<br>
part 20a of the steam turbine 20.<br>
The steam outlet 68 of the high-pressure part 20a of<br>
the steam turbine 20 is connected via a reheater 70 to<br>
the steam inlet 72 of the medium-pressure part 20b of<br>
the steam turbine 20. The steam outlet 74 of the latter<br>
is connected via an overflow line 7 6 to the steam inlet<br>
78 of the low-pressure part 20c of the steam turbine<br>
20. The steam outlet 80 of the low-pressure part 20c of<br>
the steam turbine 20 is connected via a steam line 82<br>
to the condenser 26, so that a closed water-steam<br>
circuit 24 is formed.<br>
Moreover, a branch line 84 branches off from the<br>
high-pressure feed pump 48 at a removal location, at<br>
which the condensate K has reached a medium pressure.<br>
This branch line 84 is connected, via a further<br>
feedwater preheater 86 or medium-pressure economizer,<br>
to a medium-pressure stage 90, assigned to the<br>
medium-pressure part 20b of the steam turbine 20, of<br>
the water-steam circuit. For this purpose, the second<br>
feedwater preheater 8 6 is connected on the outlet side,<br>
via a feedwater line 94 which can be shut off by a<br>
valve 92, to a medium-pressure drum 96 of the<br>
medium-pressure stage 90. The medium-pressure drum 96<br>
is connected to a heating surface 98, which is arranged<br>
in the heat recovery steam generator 30 and is designed<br>
as a medium-pressure evaporator, in order to form a<br>
water-steam cycle 100. To discharge medium-pressure<br>
live steam F', the medium-pressure drum 96 is connected<br>
via a steam line 102 to the reheater 70 and thereby to<br>
the steam inlet 72 of the medium-pressure part 20b of<br>
the steam turbine 20.<br>
A further line 110, which is provided with a<br>
low-pressure feed pump 107, can be shut off by a valve<br>
108 and is connected to a low-pressure stage 120,<br>
assigned to the low-pressure part 20c of the steam<br>
turbine 20, of the water-steam circuit 24, branches off<br>
from the line 47. The low-pressure stage 120 comprises<br>
a low-pressure drum 122, which is connected to a<br>
heating surface 124, which is arranged in the heat<br>
recovery steam generator 30 and is designed as a<br>
low-pressure evaporator, in order to form a<br>
water-steam cycle 126. To discharge low-pressure live<br>
steam F', the low-pressure drum 122 is connected to<br>
the overflow line 76 via a steam line 127, into which a<br>
low-pressure superheater 128 is connected. Therefore,<br>
in the exemplary embodiment the water-steam circuit 24<br>
of the gas and steam turbine installation 1 comprises<br>
three pressure stages 50, 90, 120. Alternatively,<br>
however, it is also possible to provide fewer, in<br>
particular two pressure stages.<br>
The gas turbine installation la is designed to operate<br>
with a gasified untreated gas or synthesis gas SG which<br>
is generated by the gasification of a fossil fuel B.<br>
The synthesis gas SG provided may, for example, be<br>
gasified coal or gasified oil. For this purpose, the<br>
gas turbine installation la comprises a fuel system<br>
129, by means of which<br>
synthesis gas SG can be fed to the burner 7 in the<br>
combustion chamber 6 assigned to the gas turbine 2. The<br>
fuel system 129 comprises a gas line 130, which<br>
connects a gasification device 132 to the combustion<br>
chamber 6 of the gas turbine. Coal, natural gas or oil<br>
can be fed as fossil fuel B to the gasification device<br>
132 via an introduction system 134. Furthermore, the<br>
gasification system 129 comprises components which are<br>
connected into the gas line 130 between the<br>
gasification device 132 and the combustion chamber 6 of<br>
the gas turbine 2.<br>
Upstream of the combustion chamber 6, a further gas<br>
line 131 branches off from the gas line 130, the gas<br>
line 130 and the further gas line 131 being separately<br>
connected to the burner 7 of the combustion chamber 6.<br>
The synthesis gas SG can be divided into a first<br>
part-stream SGI and a second part-stream SG2 via the<br>
gas line 130 and the further gas line 131. The<br>
part-streams SGI, SG2 of synthesis gas SG can in this<br>
case be fed separately to the burner 7 in order to be<br>
burnt. A first part-stream SGI can be supplied via the<br>
gas line 130, and a second part-stream SG2 can be<br>
supplied via the further gas line 131. The further gas<br>
line 131 in this case branches off from the gas line<br>
130 in a region 236 which is described in more detail<br>
in Fig. 2. Downstream of the region 236, the gas line<br>
130 and the further gas line 131 are connected<br>
substantially in parallel in terms of flow and are<br>
connected to the burner 7 at various connection<br>
locations, so that the part-streams SGI, SG2 can be fed<br>
to the burner 7 separately in terms of flow and<br>
independently of one another.<br>
An air separation installation 138 assigned to the fuel<br>
system 129 is connected upstream of the gasification<br>
device 132 via an oxygen line 136 in order to provide<br>
the oxygen O2 required for the gasification of the<br>
fossil fuel B. The inlet side of the air separation<br>
installation 138 can be fed with an air stream L which<br>
is composed of a first air part-stream L1 and a second<br>
air part-stream L2. The first air part-stream L1 can be<br>
removed from the<br>
air which has been compressed in the air compressor 4.<br>
For this purpose, the air separation installation 138<br>
is connected on the inlet side to a removal air line<br>
140, which branches off from the compressed-air line 8<br>
at a branching location 142. Moreover, a further air<br>
line 143, into which an additional air compressor 144<br>
is connected and via which the second air part-stream<br>
L2 can be fed to the air separation installation 138,<br>
opens out into the removal air line 140. In the<br>
exemplary embodiment, therefore, the total air stream L<br>
flowing to the air separation installation 138 is<br>
composed of the air part-stream L2 which has been<br>
branched off from the compressed-air line A and the air<br>
part-stream L2 which has been delivered by the<br>
additional air compressor 144. A circuit concept of<br>
this nature is also referred to as a partially<br>
integrated installation concept. In an alternative<br>
configuration, known as the fully integrated<br>
installation concept, the further air line 143 together<br>
with the additional air compressor 144 can be dispensed<br>
with, so that the entire feed of air to the air<br>
separation installation 138 is effected by means of the<br>
air part-stream L1 removed from the compressed-air line<br>
8.<br>
The nitrogen N2 which is obtained in addition to the<br>
oxygen 02 in the air separation installation 138 during<br>
the separation of the air stream L is fed via a<br>
nitrogen feed line 230, which is connected to the air<br>
separation installation 138, to a mixing device 146,<br>
where it is admixed to the synthesis gas SG. The mixing<br>
device 14 6 is designed to mix the nitrogen N2 with the<br>
synthesis gas particularly uniformly without laminar<br>
flows. The mixing device 146 is optional and can also<br>
be dispensed with if desired in other installation<br>
concepts with low oxygen contents in the nitrogen.<br>
The synthesis gas SG flowing out of the gasification<br>
device 132 initially passes via the gas line 130 into a<br>
synthesis gas heat recovery steam generator 147, in<br>
which the synthesis gas SG is cooled by heat exchange<br>
with a flow medium. High-pressure steam which is<br>
generated during this heat exchange is fed to the<br>
high-pressure stage 50 of the water-steam circuit 24,<br>
in a manner which is not illustrated in more detail.<br>
The gas line 130, a dedusting device 148 for the<br>
synthesis gas SG and a desulfurization installation 149<br>
are connected downstream of the synthesis gas heat<br>
recovery stream generator 147 and upstream of a mixing<br>
device 146, as seen in the direction of flow of the<br>
synthesis gas SG. In an alternative configuration, it<br>
is also possible for a carbon black scrubbing device to<br>
be provided instead of the dedusting device 148, in<br>
particular when the fuel being gasified is oil.<br>
To achieve a particularly low level of pollutant<br>
emissions during the combustion of the gasified fuel B<br>
in the burner 7 arranged in the combustion chamber 6,<br>
there is provision for the gasified fuel B to be laden<br>
with steam before it enters the combustion chamber 6.<br>
This can take place, in a manner which is particularly<br>
advantageous in thermal terms, in a saturator system.<br>
For this purpose, a saturator 150, in which the fuel B<br>
which has been gasified to form the synthesis gas SG is<br>
guided in countercurrent to heated saturator water W,<br>
is connected into the gas line 130. The saturator water<br>
W circulates in a saturator circuit 152 which is<br>
connected to the saturator 150 and into which a<br>
circulation pump 154 and a heat exchanger 156 for<br>
preheating the saturator water W are connected. The<br>
primary side of the heat exchanger 156 is acted on by<br>
preheated feedwater at the medium-pressure stage 90 of<br>
the water-steam circuit 24. An infeed line 158 is<br>
connected to the saturator circuit 152 in order to<br>
compensate for the losses of saturator water W which<br>
occur during the saturation of the gasified fuel.<br>
On the secondary side, a heat exchanger 159, which acts<br>
as a synthesis gas/mixed gas heat exchanger, is<br>
connected into the gas line 130 downstream of the<br>
saturator 150, as seen in the direction of flow of the<br>
synthesis gas SG. On the primary side, the heat<br>
exchanger 159 is likewise connected into the gas line<br>
130, at a location upstream of the dedusting<br>
installation 148, so that the synthesis gas SG which<br>
flows to the dedusting installation 148 transfers some<br>
of its heat to the synthesis gas SG flowing out of the<br>
saturator 150.<br>
It is also possible for the synthesis gas SG to be<br>
passed through the heat exchanger 159 before it enters<br>
the desulfurization installation 149 in the case of a<br>
circuit concept which is modified with regard to the<br>
other components. In particular when a carbon black<br>
scrubbing device is connected into the circuit, the<br>
heat exchanger 159 may preferably be incorporated<br>
downstream of the carbon black scrubbing device on the<br>
synthesis gas side.<br>
A further heat exchanger 160, which on the primary side<br>
may be heated with feedwater or with steam, is<br>
connected on the secondary side into the gas line 130,<br>
between the saturator 150 and the heat exchanger 159.<br>
The heat exchanger 159, which is formed as a synthesis<br>
gas/pure gas heat exchanger, and the heat exchanger 160<br>
result in particularly reliable preheating of the<br>
synthesis gas SG flowing to the burner 7 of the<br>
combustion chamber 6 of the gas turbine 2 even in the<br>
event of different operating states of the gas and<br>
steam turbine installation 1. A heat exchanger 162,<br>
which on the secondary side is designed as a<br>
medium-pressure evaporator for a flow medium S', is on<br>
the primary side connected into the removal air line<br>
140 in order to cool the part-stream LI of compressed<br>
air which is to be fed to the air separation<br>
installation 138 and is also referred to as removal<br>
air. To form an evaporator cycle 163, the heat<br>
exchanger 162 is connected to a water-steam drum 146<br>
desiged as a medium-pressure drum. The water-steam<br>
drum 164 is connected via lines 166, 168 to the<br>
medium-pressure drum 96 assigned to the water-steam<br>
cycle 100. Alternatively, the heat exchanger 162 may<br>
also be directly connected to the medium-pressure drum<br>
96 on the secondary side. In the exemplary embodiment,<br>
therefore, the water-steam drum 164 is indirectly<br>
connected to the heating surface 98 designed as<br>
medium-pressure evaporator. Moreover, a feedwater line<br>
170 is connected to the water-steam drum 164 in order<br>
to top up evaporated flow medium S'.<br>
A further heat exchanger 172/ which on the secondary<br>
side is designed as a low-pressure evaporator for a<br>
flow medium S" , is connected into the removal air<br>
line 140, downstream of the heat exchanger 162 as seen<br>
in the direction of flow of the part-stream L1 of<br>
compressed air. To form an evaporator cycle 174, the<br>
heat exchanger 172 is connected to a water-steam drum<br>
176 designed as a low-pressure drum. In the exemplary<br>
embodiment, the water-steam drum 17 6 is connected via<br>
lines 178, 180 to the low-pressure drum 122 assigned to<br>
the water-steam cycle 126 and is therefore indirectly<br>
connected to the heating surface 124 designed<br>
low-pressure evaporator. Alternatively, however, the<br>
water-steam drum 176 may also be connected up in<br>
another suitable way, in which case steam removed from<br>
the water-steam drum 17 6 can be fed to an auxiliary<br>
consumer as process steam and/or as heating steam. In a<br>
further alternative configuration, the heat exchanger<br>
172 may also be connected directly to the low-pressure<br>
drum 122 on the secondary side. Moreover, the<br>
water-steam drum 176 is connected to a feedwater line<br>
182.<br>
The evaporator cycles 163, 174 may each be designed as<br>
a forced cycle, in which case circulation of the flow<br>
medium S' or S' is ensured by a circulation pump and<br>
the flow medium S', S' at least partially evaporates<br>
in the heat exchanger 162 or 172, respectively,<br>
designed as an evaporator. In the exemplary embodiment,<br>
however, both the evaporator cycle 163 and the<br>
evaporator cycle 174 are in each case designed as a<br>
natural cycle, in which case the circulation of the<br>
flow medium S' or S" is ensured by the pressure<br>
differences which are established during the<br>
evaporation process and/or by the geodetic arrangement<br>
of the respective heat exchanger 162 or 172 and of the<br>
respective water-steam drum 164 or 176. In this<br>
configuration, in each case only a relatively small<br>
recirculation pump (not shown in more detail) for<br>
starting up the system is connected into the evaporator<br>
cycle 163 or into the evaporator cycle 174.<br>
To introduce heat into the saturator circuit 152, there<br>
is, in addition to the heat exchanger 156, which<br>
can be fed with heated feedwater S which has been<br>
branched off downstream of the feedwater preheater 86,<br>
a saturator water heat exchanger 184, which on the<br>
primary side can be fed with feedwater S from the<br>
feedwater tank 46. For this purpose, the saturator<br>
water heat exchanger 184 is on the primary side<br>
connected on the inlet side to the branch line 84 via a<br>
line 186 and on the outlet side to the feedwater tank<br>
46 via a line 88. To reheat the cooled feedwater S<br>
flowing out of the feedwater heat exchanger 184, an<br>
additional heat exchanger 190, which on the primary<br>
side is connected downstream of the heat exchanger 172<br>
in the removal air line 140, is connected into the line<br>
188. An arrangement of this nature makes it possible to<br>
achieve a particularly high degree of heat recovery<br>
from the removal air and therefore a particularly high<br>
efficiency of the gas and steam turbine installation 1.<br>
A cooling air line 192, via which a partial quantity 1/<br>
of the cooled part-stream L can be fed to the gas<br>
turbine 2 as cooling air for cooling the blades and<br>
vanes, branches off from the removal air line 140<br>
between the heat exchanger 172 and the heat exchanger<br>
190, as seen in the direction of flow of the air<br>
part-stream LI. This embodiment is used occasionally.<br>
When the gas and steam turbine installation 1 is<br>
operating, synthesis gas SG, which has been obtained by<br>
gasification of the fossil fuel B in the gasification<br>
device 132, is fed to the burner 7 of the gas turbine<br>
2. In the process, the synthesis gas SG is divided in<br>
the region 236 into a first part-stream SGI and a<br>
second part-stream SG2, and the part-streams SGI, SG2<br>
are fed separately to the burner 7 in order to be<br>
burnt. The first part-stream SG and the second<br>
part-stream SG2 may each be fed to the burner 7 in a<br>
controlled manner.<br>
The circuit concept on which the synthesis gas mode of<br>
the burner 7 of the gas turbine 2 is based is<br>
illustrated in detail in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 substantially<br>
shows an enlarged representation of the region 236<br>
shown in Fig. 1 and the corresponding connection to the<br>
burner 7, which is illustrated on an enlarged scale.<br>
The burner 7 is arranged in a combustion chamber 6, the<br>
combustion chamber 6 being assigned to the gas turbine<br>
2 (cf. Fig. 1). In the region 36, the further gas line<br>
131 branches off from the gas line 130 at a branching<br>
location 242. The burner 7 has a burner axis 252, along<br>
which a first fuel passage 238 and a second fuel<br>
passage 240, which is separate from the first fuel<br>
passage 238 in terms of flow, extend. Furthermore, the<br>
burner has a combustion space 246, in which a first<br>
combustion zone 248a and a second combustion zone 248b<br>
are formed. The first combustion zone 248a is assigned<br>
to the first fuel passage 238, and the second<br>
combustion zone 248b is assigned to the second fuel<br>
passage 240. In this case, the combustion zones 248a,<br>
248b may at least partially physically overlap one<br>
another. The fuel passages 238, 240 are arranged at a<br>
radial distance from one another around the burner axis<br>
252 of the burner 7, the fuel passages 238, 240 in each<br>
case forming a cylindrical annular space. When the<br>
burner 7 is operating, it is fed with combustion air Lv<br>
which is removed from the compressor 4 via the<br>
compressed-air line 8 (cf. Fig. 1). Furthermore, the<br>
gas line 130 is connected to the first fuel passage<br>
238, and the further gas line 131 is connected to the<br>
second fuel passage 240, so that a first part-stream<br>
SGI of synthesis gas SG is fed to the first fuel<br>
passage 238 and a second part-stream SG2 of synthesis<br>
gas SG is fed to the second fuel passage 240, in order<br>
to be burnt. In this case, the first part-stream SGI<br>
is laden with combustion air L and burnt in the first<br>
combustion zone 248a and the second part-stream SG2 is<br>
laden with combustion air L and burnt in the second<br>
combustion zone 248b, so as to form hot combustion<br>
gases which act on the gas turbine 2.<br>
When the fuel system 12 9 shown in Fig. 1A is being shut<br>
down, a purge operation is required. This takes place<br>
in such a manner that a first and a second region of<br>
the fuel gasification system 129 are purged separately<br>
with nitrogen N2 in one or more steps. The gasification<br>
system or the first<br>
region and the gas turbine fuel system or the second<br>
region are in this case separated from one another in<br>
the region 236 by a gas lock 200 shown in Fig. 2. The<br>
gas lock 200 is in this case connected into the gas<br>
line 130, with the gas lock 200 being arranged upstream<br>
of the location 242 where the further gas line 131<br>
branches off from the gas line 130. The gasification<br>
system itself comprises the gasification device 132 as<br>
far as the gas lock 200, and the gas turbine fuel<br>
system comprises the gas lock 200 and the downstream<br>
components as far as the combustion chamber 6,<br>
including the burner 7, of the gas turbine 2.<br>
The gas lock 200 comprises a quick-closing fitting 202<br>
which is arranged in the gas line 130 and • connected<br>
directly downstream of which there is a gas-lock<br>
fitting 204 designed as a ball valve. Residual gas is<br>
discharged to an excess gas burner via the exhaust-gas<br>
line 207 during the purge after the gasification device<br>
132 has been switched off or during the purge of the<br>
saturator 150 and downstream heat exchanger. The<br>
exhaust-gas line 207 with associated fitting serves as<br>
a pressure-relief system 206 for the gas lock 200. The<br>
gas line 130 can be shut off in a gastight manner by<br>
means of the gas lock 200 and if necessary can be<br>
closed off within a particularly short time by means of<br>
the quick-closing fitting 202.<br>
A control fitting 208a, which is connected into the gas<br>
line 130 and is used to control the first part-stream<br>
SGI of synthesis gas SG to the burner 7, is connected<br>
directly downstream of the gas lock 200. A further<br>
control fitting 208b is connected into the further gas<br>
line 131, which branches off from the gas line 130. The<br>
second part-stream SG of synthesis gas SG to the burner<br>
7 can be controlled by means of the control fitting<br>
208b.<br>
Pure nitrogen R-N2 from the air separation installation<br>
138 is provided for the purpose of purging the<br>
gasification system or the first region of the fuel<br>
system with nitrogen N2, i.e. from the gasification<br>
device 132 to the gas lock 200. For this purpose, the<br>
nitrogen N2, which is produced in addition to the<br>
oxygen O2 in the air separation installation 132 during<br>
the separation of the air stream L, is discharged from<br>
the air separation installation 138 as pure nitrogen<br>
R-N2 via a feed line 210. A branch line 214, which can<br>
be shut off by a valve 212 and opens out in order to<br>
purge the first region of the fuel system 129 and the<br>
gasification device 132 for fossil fuel, branches off<br>
from the first feed line 210.<br>
Pure nitrogen R-N2 is also provided for the purpose of<br>
purging the second region or the gas turbine fuel<br>
system with nitrogen N2 as a purge medium. For this<br>
purpose, the feed line 210 opens out into a nitrogen<br>
store 220. In addition, a reserve line 224, which can<br>
be shut off by the valve 222 and on the inlet side is<br>
connected to an emergency filling system 226 for pure<br>
nitrogen R-N2, opens out into the feed line 210. On<br>
account of the fact that the nitrogen store 220 is<br>
connected both to the air separation installation 138<br>
and to the emergency filling system 226, it can be fed<br>
both with pure nitrogen R-N2 from the air separation<br>
installation and with pure nitrogen R-N2 from the<br>
emergency filling system 226. As a result, purging of<br>
the gasification system 129 is ensured particularly<br>
reliably even in the event of the air separation<br>
installation 138 failing. The dimensions of the<br>
nitrogen store 226 are such that it covers the demand<br>
for pure nitrogen R-N2 for the purging operation<br>
including a sufficiently high reserve capacity. On the<br>
outlet side, the nitrogen store 226 is connected to the<br>
gas line 130 via a purge line 228. The purge line 228<br>
opens out into the gas line 130 downstream of the<br>
synthesis gas SG in the region immediately following<br>
the gas lock 200, i.e. following the gas lock fitting<br>
204.<br>
A second feed line 230, which opens out into the mixing<br>
device 14 6, branches off from the air separation<br>
installation 138 (Fig. 1) for the purpose of supplying<br>
impure nitrogen U-N2 which has been generated in the<br>
air separation installation 138. In the mixing device<br>
146, the impure nitrogen U-N2 is admixed to the<br>
synthesis gas SG in order to reduce the levels of NOX<br>
emissions from the gas turbine. The mixing<br>
device 146 is designed for a particularly uniform<br>
mixing, without any laminar flows, of the nitrogen N2<br>
with the synthesis gas SG.<br>
In the event of any changeover in the gas turbine 2<br>
from synthesis gas SG to a second fuel, corresponding<br>
to a change in the fuel gas fed to the burner 7 of the<br>
combustion chamber 6, there is provision for the gas<br>
turbine fuel system 129 to be purged with nitrogen. The<br>
synthesis gas SG located in the gas turbine fuel system<br>
129 has to be virtually completely displaced by the<br>
purge operation, for safety reasons.<br>
In synthesis gas mode, i.e. during combustion of<br>
synthesis gas SG, which is fed to the associated fuel<br>
passages 240, 238 shown in Fig. 2 in part-streams SGI<br>
and SG2, in order to be burnt, natural gas EG or steam<br>
D can be admixed to the second part-stream SG2. This<br>
allows the calorific value of the first part-stream<br>
SGI, used to operate the second fuel passage 240, to be<br>
increased or reduced as required. For this purpose,<br>
there is a feed device 244, which comprises a natural<br>
gas feed system 244a and a further feed system 244b for<br>
steam D or pure nitrogen R-N2. The feed device 244 is<br>
connected to the further gas line 131 at a connection<br>
location 250 in the region 236, so that if necessary it<br>
is possible to feed a corresponding fluid into the<br>
further gas line 131 and to the second fuel passage 240<br>
via the feed device 244. In this case, the second fuel<br>
passage 240 is advantageously supplied with synthesis<br>
gas SG independently of the first fuel passage 238.<br>
Furthermore, the part-streams SGI, SG2 can be fed<br>
independently of one another with pure nitrogen R-N2 or<br>
steam D via the purge line 228 or the further feed<br>
system 244b of the feed device 244 and can thereby be<br>
purged. Therefore, both synthesis part-streams SGI, SG2<br>
can be operated with a different, controllable<br>
calorific value. The feed system 244 which is assigned<br>
to the second fuel passage<br>
240 in this case performs two tasks, namely that of<br>
reducing NOx in a natural gas mode and of targeted<br>
adjustment of the calorific value and operational<br>
control of combustion in the synthesis gas mode.<br>
This novel method for operating a burner 7, together<br>
with the installation concept described, allows stepped<br>
operation of a power plant installation 3 with<br>
synthesis gas SG. This synthesis mode is distinguished<br>
on the one hand by a sufficiently low pressure loss in<br>
full-load operation with respective part-streams SGI,<br>
SG2 flowing through the two fuel passages 238, 240. On<br>
the other hand, however, the required minimum pressure<br>
loss in the event of minimum-load or idling mode of the<br>
gas turbine 2 with synthesis gas SG is also ensured, as<br>
a result of, for example, only the second fuel passage<br>
240 being utilized when required. For this purpose, the<br>
second fuel passage 240 may have a greater flow<br>
resistance than the first fuel passage 238 by employing<br>
a suitable structural design and dimensioning of the<br>
second fuel passage 240. The simultaneous utilization<br>
of both fuel passages 238, 240, which may have<br>
different flow resistances, allows a significantly<br>
narrower range of variation in the pressure loss<br>
compared to the systems which have previously been<br>
known to be achieved for a predetermined range of<br>
variation in the total fuel mass flow fed to the burner<br>
7. Consequently, the pressure loss at base load<br>
compared to the pressure loss under minimum load, e.g.<br>
when the gas turbine 2 is idling, is lower than with a<br>
single-passage concept, in which just one synthesis-gas<br>
stream is fed to a burner 7 in order to be burnt.<br>
By adapting the dilution ratio of the synthesis gas SG,<br>
which is delivered to the second fuel passage 240, via<br>
the feed device 244, it is possible to stabilize the<br>
first fuel passage 238, which can serve as the main<br>
passage for the synthesis gas SG. In the event of a low<br>
dilution of the second part-stream SG2 of synthesis gas<br>
SG through the<br>
second fuel passage 240, the second fuel passage 240<br>
can serve as a pilot flame for the first fuel passage<br>
238, which may be more strongly diluted. Furthermore,<br>
by influencing the dilution ratio in a targeted manner,<br>
it is possible to influence flame oscillations in a<br>
very efficient way, without the need for complex<br>
changes to the geometry of the burner 7, purely by<br>
trimming the part-streams SGI, SG2. The two-flow<br>
concept of the burner 7 operated using the method<br>
according to the invention particularly advantageously<br>
makes it possible to adapt the combustion behavior. As<br>
a result, the possible options for optimizing the<br>
combustion behavior in terms of combustion oscillations<br>
and burner temperatures are improved considerably by<br>
adapting the corresponding operating setting. The<br>
invention is distinguished in particular by the fact<br>
that at least one fuel passage of the burner 7, for<br>
example the second fuel passage 240, can be utilized<br>
with a dual function, specifically as a synthesis<br>
passage in synthesis-gas mode or as a fuel passage for<br>
a further gaseous fuel (B) , e.g. natural gas (EG) in<br>
natural gas mode. In this case, it is also possible for<br>
a mixture of synthesis gas and natural gas to be fed to<br>
a fuel passage, if appropriate with added steam, and to<br>
produce a novel type of mixing operation.<br>
