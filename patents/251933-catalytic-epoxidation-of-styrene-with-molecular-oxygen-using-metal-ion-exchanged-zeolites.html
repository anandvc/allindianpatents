				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the catalytic epoxidation of styrene with molecular oxygen using metal ion exchanged zeolites.<br>
More specifically, the invention relates to a catalyst and the catalytic process for epoxidation of styrene to styrene oxide using molecular oxygen/air in presence of cobalt exchanged zeolite catalyst having adsorbed water molecules and alkali and/or alkaline earth metal cationic promoters.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Styrene oxide is used over a wide range of field, for example as a stabilizer for polymers, an ultraviolet ray absorber, a starting material in the preparation of drugs, a stabilizer for solvents, or as a starting material for phenethyl alcohol and phenethyl aldehyde which are useful as synthetic perfumes and sweetening materials.<br>
For preparing styrene oxide by the epoxidation of styrene there generally is adopted a process in which styrene is epoxidised using an organic peracid. However, this process involves the following drawbacks and is not always satisfactory.<br>
During the reaction of oxidizing styrene with an organic peracid, the organic peracid is decomposed and there occurs an addition reaction of the resulting radical to styrene, thus resulting in that the selectivity of styrene oxide with respect to styrene is deteriorated.<br>
The resulting styrene oxide cleaves in the presence of an organic acid byproduced after the reaction, thereby producing an ester and a hydroxy compound, whereby the selectivity of styrene oxide with respect to styrene is deteriorated.<br>
Peracetic acid which is most easily available industrially among organic peracids is prepared by a so-called Daicel-Wacker process comprising air oxidation of acetaldehyde, but it is a very expensive oxidizing agent.<br>
In order to avoid a possible danger in the use of an organic peracid it is necessary to pay close attention to both operation and equipment.<br>
In order to overcome these limitations, the conventional route for epoxidation of alkenes is being attempted to be replaced by environmental friendly re-usable heterogeneous catalysts and hydrogen peroxide/molecular oxygen as oxidant.<br>
Y. W. Kobe in U. S. Pat. No. 3,806,467 (1974) proposed a process wherein an olefin and hydrogen peroxide are reacted in the presence of a bis (tri-n-methyltinoxy) molybdic acid catalyst to prepare an epoxide. However, as long as the working Examples thereof are reviewed, the yield of styrene oxide is a little lower than 3% (based on hydrogen peroxide) and thus this proposed process cannot be considered preferable as a styrene oxide preparing process. E.L.Lines et al. in U. S. Pat. No. 3,953,362 (1976) describes oxygen-containing molybdenum compound as catalysts for the epoxidation reaction of unsaturated organic compounds with peroxidic compounds such as hydrogen peroxide. In order to retard the co-production of undesirable organic compounds such as glycols, it is required to have no more than a minor amount of water present during oxidation. The main drawback of this invention is that the hydrogen peroxide using in the reaction must have less than 1 percent water in it.<br>
E. L. Lines et al. in U. S. Pat. No. 4,157,346 (1979) describes an epoxidation method wherein an alkylene compound is reacted with a peroxidic compound, e.g., H2O2, in the presence of an improved molybdenum catalyst at 10 to 20 atmospheres pressure. The water which may be formed enhances the production of undesirable glycols, it desirable to maintain the amount of water to get epoxide selectivity. The main drawbacks of this invention are the high pressure required for the reaction and the contentious removal of the by-product water formed from the reaction mixture.<br>
L. Kim in U. S. Pat. No. 4,418,203 (1983) describes a process for the epoxidation of olefins with hydrogen peroxide in a fluorinated alcoholic solvent using a catalyst selected from a group consisting of molybdenum, tungsten and rhenium and an organo metallic co-catalyst selected from the group consisting of organo tin, organo arsenic, organo antimony and organo germanium. The main drawback of this invention is the use of fluorinated alcoholic solvent for the reaction.<br>
C.L.Hill in U.S. Pat.No. 4,864,041 (1989) A novel process for the homogenous oxidation of organic substrates is disclosed. This process uses a transition metal-substituted polyoxometalate catalyst, which in the presence of an oxygen donor, catalyses epoxidation reaction of the organic substrate. Typical oxygen donors used in this invention include C1.30 alkyl hydroperoxides, hydrogen peroxide, C6-3o iodosylarenes, C1.30 amine N-oxides, C1.30<br>
peracids, hypochlorites, and other halogen oxyanions, oxaziridines, and highly oxidizing transition metal oxo compounds such as chromate, dichromate, permanganate, ruthenium and osmium tetroxides. The main drawback of this invention is the oxygen donor is required to use in equivalent to the amount of substrate or on a molar basis for the oxidation of the substrate.<br>
P.R.Blum in US Pat. No. 4,894,467 (1990) disclosed a process for making styrene oxide which comprises contacting styrene in the vapour phase with a molecular oxygen-containing gas over a silver metal catalyst containing a promoting amount of at least one alkali metal hydroxide selected from sodium, potassium and lithium hydroxides, on an inert solid inorganic support at contact times of from 0.6 to 10 seconds and temperatures from 200 to 350°C. The main drawback of this invention is that the reaction was carried out at vapour phase at high temperatures ranging from 200 to 350°C.<br>
S. Enomoto et al. in U. S. Pat. No. 5,041,569 (1991) discloses a process for the styrene oxide preparation by reacting styrene and hydrogen peroxide in a heterogeneous system in the presence of a bis(tri-n-alkyltinoxy)molybdic acid and an amine such as ammonia, primary, secondary and tertiary methylamines, primary, secondary and tertiary ethylamines, primary, secondary and tertiary n-propylamines, primary, secondary and tertiary isopropylamines, primary, secondary and tertiary butylamines, primary, secondary and tertiary ethanolamines. The main drawback of this invention is that the process involves the use of amine promoters.<br>
J. R. Monnier et al. in U. S. Pat. No. 5,145,968 (1992) disclosed a process for the selective monoepoxidation of styrene, styrene analogs, and styrene derivatives. Such compounds are contacted with an oxygen-containing gas in the presence of a promoted, supported silver catalyst at a pressure in the range of 0.1 up to 100 atmospheres, temperature in the range of 100 to 325°C. 0.5 to 75% conversion was obtained during the reaction. The main drawback of this invention is that the maximum conversion was only 75%.<br>
K. Nishibe et al. in U. S. Pat. No. 5,155,241 (1992) describes a process for preparing Styrene oxide by reacting styrene and hydrogen peroxide in a heterogeneous system in the presence of a bis(tri-n-alkyltinoxy) molybdic acid catalyst and an inorganic anion as a promotor in the reaction. 62-77% conversion was observed and 45-100% selectivity was obtained. The main drawback of this invention is that the maximum conversion was only 77%.<br>
K. B. Sharpless et al. in U. S. Pat. No. 5,939,568 (1999) discloses a rhenium-catalyzed epoxidation of olefinic substrates, accelerated by the acclerants having a nitrogenous aromatic heterocyclic structure. Use of the accelerants also enables the use of aqueous hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. To achieve optimum acceleration, the accelerant should have a concentration within a range from 2.0 mole percent to 100 mole percent of the acclerant with respect to 1 mole of the olefinic substrate. The main drawback of this invention is that the process involves the use of 2.0 to 100 mole percent acclerants.<br>
R. A. Grey et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,591 (2001) disclosed an olefin epoxidation process using a titanium zeolite catalyst modified with Pt, Pd, or Cu compound. The main drawback of this invention is that the titanium silicate zeolite catalysts are acidic in nature they also catalyse the epoxide isomerization and/or epoxide ring opening, thereby reducing the selectivity for the formation of epoxide in the epoxidation process over these catalysts.<br>
B. Zhou et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 6,534,661 (2003) discloses a bimetallic, primarily Pt and Pd noble metals supported on titanium containing silica support for the epoxidation of organic compounds such as propylene using hydrogen and oxygen at elevated pressure of 500-2000 psig. In this disclosure, the presence of Pt, Pd and Ti is essential for the epoxidation to occur. In addition, the reaction is carried out in gas/liquid phase but at elevated pressures and the catalyst is prepared by impregnation of reduced Pd and Pt containing solution (by hydrogen) on the titanium containing zeolite support. After filtration of the impregnated mass and drying, it is further reduced in hydrogen at 250-300°C for 10-20 hours. The main drawback of this invention is that the process of this disclosure is expensive and complicated requiring heterogeneous deposition for formation of the catalyst, and elevated pressures during application for epoxidation<br>
V. R. Choudhary et al. in US Pat. Publication No. 20050065355 (2005) discloses an invention relates to a process for the liquid phase epoxidation of a normally liquid olefinic compound to corresponding organic epoxide compound using aqueous or anhydrous organic hydroperoxide as an oxidizing agent in the presence of a supported nano-gold catalysts. The main drawback of this invention is that the process requires highly expensive nano-size gold particles as catalysts.<br>
V. R. Choudhary et al. in U. S. Pat. Publication No. 20050113586 (2005) discloses an invention relates to a biphasic process for the epoxidation of an organic compound by organic hydroperoxide to the corresponding epoxide, using chromate or dichromate anions as the<br>
catalyst in aqueous medium. The main drawback of this invention is that the process requires organic hydroperoxide the mole ratio of 0.1 to 10 to olefinic compound.<br>
Q.Tang, et al in Chem. Commun., 2004, 440-441 and Journal of Catalysis 230 (2005) 384-397, discloses the use of Co2+ containing molecular sieves as catalysts for the epoxidation of styrene with molecular oxygen. They observed a maximum styrene conversion 45% with styrene oxide selectivity 65%. The main drawback of their process is that the styrene conversion is only 45% and styrene oxide selectivity is only 65%.<br>
J. Liang et al in Catalysis Communications, 2004, 5, 665-669, describes Fe2+-exchanged NaY zeolite and Fe2+-containing compounds including Fe3(PO4)2 and Fe3C&gt;4 as heterogeneous catalysts for the epoxidation of alkenes with molecular oxygen in the absence of a sacrificial reductant. A maximum styrene conversion 46.2% with styrene oxide selectivity 62.2% were observed in their reaction. The main drawback of their process is that styrene conversion is only 46.2% and styrene oxide selectivity is only 62.2%.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the present invention, we report a novel catalyst for the epoxidation of styrene to styrene oxide with molecular oxygen, having the chemical composition, (Co)x.(M2/n)y Al88<br>
Si104 O384. wH2O, where the values of x varies from O to 44, y from O to 88, w being the number of moles of water and M is a alkali or alkaline earth metal cation having valancy n. Zeolites, which are microporous crystalline alumna-silicates, are finding increased applications as catalysts for various chemical reactions. Zeolites have a three dimensional network of basic structural units consisting SiO4 and A104 tetrahedrons linked to each other by sharing apical oxygen atoms. Silicon and aluminium atoms lie in the centre of the tetrahedral. The resulting aluminosilicate structure, which is generally highly porous, possesses three-dimensional pores the access to which is through molecular sized windows. In a hydrated form, the preferred zeolites are generally represented by the following formula, M2/nO.Al2O3.xSiO2. WH2O, where M is a cation, which balances the electrovalence of the tetrahedral and is generally referred to as extra framework exchangeable cation, n represents the valancy of the cation and x and w represents the moles of SiC&gt;2 and water respectively. The extra framework cations present in zeolites play significant role in determining their adsorption and catalytic properties. In particular, if co-ordinately unsaturated metal ions can be incorporated inside the zeolite cavities, novel adsorption and catalytic behaviour may be fashioned on the basis of coordination of guest molecules. Exchangeable transition metal ions in activated zeolites are generally co-ordinately unsaturated and readily form complexes with a variety of guest molecules. For applications, transition-metal ions are often introduced by ion-exchange; these can coordinate more selectively to guest molecules than filled-shell cations and often have easy access to other oxidation states, so their introduction into the zeolite allows new mechanisms for their function as sorbents and catalysts.<br>
The attributes which makes the zeolites attractive as catalysts include, an unusually high thermal and hydrothermal stability, uniform pore structure, easy pore aperture modification and substantial catalytic activity. Furthermore, zeolites can be produced synthetically under relatively moderate hydrothermal conditions.<br>
X-ray powder diffraction studies of various cobalt-exchanged zeolite at ambient temperature were carried out using PHILIPS X'pert MPD system in the 29 range of 5-65 degrees using CuKai (k = 1.54056A). The diffraction patterns of the starting materials show that these are highly crystalline showing the reflections in the range 5 to 35 degrees typically of zeolites. The structure of the zeolite was retained during the cations exchange process. The X-ray powder pattern of various cobalt ion exchanged zeolites showed the loss of crystallinity during the cobalt ion exchange process. The X-ray diffraction at "2 theta" values<br>
6.1, 10.0, 15.5, 20.1, 23.4, 26.7, 29.3, 30.5, 31.0 and 32.1 were used for comparison with the standard reference sample.<br>
Surface area and pore size distribution of the various cobalt-exchanged zeolites were determined from the N2 adsorption data at 77.35K. The equilibrium nitrogen adsorption at 77.35K was measured using Micromeritics ASAP 2010. The samples were activated at 100°C under vacuum (5xl0"3mmHg) for 12 hours before the N2 sorption measurements. The surface areas of different catalyst samples were determined by applying BET and Langmuir equations in the N2 adsorption data at 77.35K and the micropore area, micropore volume and external pore area by applying t-plot. The surface area of the zeolite samples increased on cobalt ion exchange. This is due to the decrease in the number of extra framework cations while replacing monovalent sodium ions with divalent cobalt ions. On replacing sodium ions with divalent cations such as cobalt, one Co2+ replaces two Na+ ions; therefore half the cations are present in the zeolite. The external surface area determined from the t-plot also increases with percentage of cobalt exchange. This can be explained in terms of the structural deformation occurred during the cation exchange process and/or vacuum dehydration at higher temperatures.<br>
Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopic (DRS) studies were carried out using Shimadzu UV-3101PC equipped with an integrating sphere. BaSC&gt;4 was used as the reference material. The spectra were recorded at room temperature in the wavelength range of 200-750 nm. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) detects the d-d transitions of Co2+ in the near infrared region and the 0-»Co2+ charge transfer transition in the ultraviolet region. In the hydrated pink sample, spectral minima appear around 530nm in the visible region and 240nm in the UV region. These absorptions are assigned to the transitions of the octahedral [Co(H2O)6]2+ complex located in the super cages of the zeolites. The intensity of both the peaks at 530 nm and 240 nm increases correspondingly with the amount of cobalt exchange.<br>
The zeolite in the powder form was used as the starting material. X-ray diffraction data showed that the starting material was highly crystalline. Cobalt cations were introduced into this highly crystalline zeolite by the cobalt ion exchange from aqueous solution. Typically, the zeolite was refluxed with a 0.01 to 1 M aqueous solution of the cobalt salt in the solid / liquid ratio 1:80 at 20 to 90°C for 0.1 to 10 hours. The residue was filtered, washed with hot distilled water, until the washings were free from cobalt ions and dried at room<br>
temperature in air as specified in the examples. The extent of cobalt exchange was determined by the complexometric titration of the original solution and filtrate obtained after the ion exchange with EDTA using murexide indicator.<br>
The sodium cations of the zeolites were replaced with various alkali and alkaline earth metal cations by ion exchanging with potassium, rubidium, cesium, magnesium, calcium, strontium and barium salt solution separately or in combination as explained in the examples. The ion exchange process was repeated several times to achieve the complete replacement of sodium ions with other alkali and alkaline earth metals. Cobalt cations were introduced into this highly crystalline zeolites by the cobalt ion exchange from aqueous solution. Typically, the zeolite was refluxed with a 0.01 to 1 M aqueous solution of the cobalt salt in the solid / liquid ratio 1:80 at 20 to 90°C for 0.1 to 10 hours. The residue was filtered, washed with hot distilled water, until the washings were free from nitrate ions and dried in air at room temperature. Zeolite samples having different amount of cobalt exchange were prepared by subjecting repeated ion exchange into the zeolite. The extent of cobalt exchange in zeolite was determined by the complexometric titration of the original solution and filtrate obtained after the ion exchange with EDTA using murexide indicator.<br>
The cobalt ion exchanged zeolites dried at room temperature were used for the catalytic studies with out any further activation. The catalytic epoxidation reactions were carried out in liquid phase as a batch reaction at 100°C. Typically, a round bottom flask equipped with an efficient water condenser is kept in a constant temperature oil bath whose temperature was maintained at 100±2°C. 10 mmol styrene along with 20 ml N, iV-dimethylformamide (DMF) and 200 mg catalyst were added to the flask. The reaction was started by bubbling 02 at atmospheric pressure into the reaction mixture at the rate of 6-8ml min"1. Tridecane was used as internal standard. The reaction mixture was magnetically stirred. After completing the reaction time, the catalyst was separated by centrifuging the reaction mixture and the liquid organic products were analysed with a gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard Model 6890, USA) having a flame ionisation detector and HP-5 capillary column (30m length and 0.32mm diameter, packed with silica-based supel cosil), programmed oven (temperature range 50-220°C), and N2 as carrier gas. Reaction kinetics was monitored by withdrawing small amount of the sample from the reaction flask at a time intervals of 30 minutes and analysing its composition by GC. Calibrations of GC peak areas of styrene and styrene oxide were carried out using solutions having known amounts of styrene and styrene oxide. The conversion was calculated on the basis of mole percent of styrene, the initial mole percent of styrene was<br>
divided by initial area percent (styrene peak area from GC) to get the response factor. The unreacted moles of styrene remained in the reaction mixture were calculated by multiplying response factor with the area percentage of the GC peak for styrene obtained after the reaction. The conversion, selectivity and turnover frequency (TOF) were calculated as follows:<br>
(SEQUENCE REMOVED)<br>
No. of moles of cobalt in the catalyst x Reaction time<br>
The spent catalyst was recovered from the reaction mixture by filtration and thoroughly washed with DMF, distilled water and then dried in air at room temperature.<br>
The important inventive steps involved in the present invention are that the epoxidation catalyst, (i) is prepared by the cation exchange process using aqueous solution of cobalt salt in a temperature range of 20-90°C and is used as the catalyst for the catalytic epoxidation reaction after drying at room temperatures obviating the high temperature activation (&gt;350°C) normally done for zeolite based catalysts, (ii) have alkali and/or alkaline earth metal cationic promoters for enhancing the styrene oxide selectivity and (iii) uses molecular oxygen/air for the catalytic epoxidation reactions at atmospheric pressure at 80-150°C.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
The catalytic epoxidation reaction was carried out in liquid phase as a batch reaction at 100°C using zeolite catalyst having the chemical composition Na88Al88Si104O384.wH2O. A round bottom flask equipped with an efficient water condenser is kept in a constant temperature oil bath whose temperature was maintained at 100±2°C. 10 mmol styrene along with 20 ml N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and 200 mg zeolite were added to the flask. The reaction was started by bubbling O2 at atmospheric pressure into the reaction mixture at the rate of 3-5 ml min"1. The reaction mixture was magnetically stirred. After 4 hours of reaction, the catalyst<br>
was separated by centrifuging the reaction mixture and the liquid organic products were analysed with a gas chromatograph. The styrene conversion was calculated using internal standard method. 2.5% styrene conversion with 56.5% styrene oxide selectivity was observed during the reaction.<br>
Example 2<br>
Cobalt cations were introduced into this highly crystalline zeolite having the chemical composition tfNagsAlssSiKMCWweO by the cobalt ion exchange from aqueous solution. The zeolite was refluxed with 0.05M aqueous solution of the cobalt salt in the solid / liquid ratio 1:80 at 30±10°C for 2 hours. The residue was filtered, washed with hot distilled water, until the washings were free from nitrate ions and dried in air at room temperature. The extent of cobalt exchange in zeolite was determined by the complexometric titration of the original solution and filtrate obtained after the ion exchange with EDTA using murexide indicator.
