				<td>Process of Producing C2- and C3-olefins From Hydrocarbons<br>
Description<br>
This invention relates to a process of producing C2- and C3-olefins from hydrocarbons.<br>
Such process is known from U.S. patent 5,981,819, which proceeds from a feed hydrocarbon containing C4- to C7-olefins,<br><br>
which hydrocarbon feed is reacted on a form-selective <br><br>
zeolite<br>
catalyst.<br>
It is the object underlying the invention to develop the known process and to be able to employ a hydrocarbon mixture obtained as intermediate product, which also has higher-boiling components. In accordance with the invention this is achieved in that the feed hydrocarbon together with steam is passed as vapor through a thermal steam cracking in which it is heated to temperatures in the range from 700 to 1000°C, where a cracking mixture is produced which contains C2- to C6-olefins and C4- to C6-diolefins. From the cracking mixture a first fraction, which contains C2- and C3-olefins,<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
and a second fraction, which contains olefins and diolefins of the range C4 to C6, are separated. The second fraction may for instance only contain C4-olefins or in addition C4-diolefins, and it may for instance only consist of C5- and C6-olefins and C5- and C6-diolefins. From the second fraction, the diolefins are at least partly removed and an inter-mediate product is produced, which consists of C4- to C6-olefins for at least 30 wt-%, that a feed mixture containing C4- to C6- olefins and steam is introduced into a reactor with an inlet temperature of 300 to 700°C, which reactor contains a bed of granular, form-selective catalyst, where a product mixture containing C2- to C4-olefins is withdrawn from the bed and C2- and C3-olefins are separated from the product mixture. The hydrocarbon mixture introduced into the steam cracking for instance is naphtha or ethane.<br>
From the second fraction, which contains olefins and diolefins of the range C4 to C6 and is separated from the product of the steam cracking, the diolefins (e.g. butadiene, penta-diene, hexadiene) must first be separated to a residual content of preferably not more than 5 wt-%. This is necessary because the diolefins disturb the further treatment, as they may contribute to a rapid carbonization of the form-selective catalyst. For removing the diolefins from the second fraction, several possibilities exist, and they may for instance be removed extractively or they are at least partly converted to olefins (e.g. butene, pentene, hexene) by a partial hydro-genation.<br>
It may be expedient to wholly or partly use the mixture at least partly liberated from diolefins, here referred to as intermediate product, for producing methyl-tert-butylether (MTBE). For this purpose, at least part of the intermediate product may be passed through an MTBE synthesis, where in particular the isobutene contained therein is converted to MTBE on a catalyst known per se by adding methanol. Details<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
of the MTBE synthesis are known (for example process of Snam-progetti or Universal Oil Products).<br>
A feed mixture containing steam and C4- to C6-olefins is finally passed over a granular, form-selective zeolite catalyst. The zeolite preferably is of the pentasil type with an atomic ratio Si:Al in the range from 10:1 to 200:1. Such zeolite catalyst is described for instance in EP-B-0369364. It is recommended, to operate the reactor which contains the zeolite catalyst at relatively low pressures in the range from 0.2 to 3 bar and preferably 0.6 to 1.5 bar. Details are known from U.S. patent 5,981,819.<br>
Embodiments of the process will be explained with reference to the drawing. The drawing shows a flow diagram of the process.<br>
A vaporous feed hydrocarbon, which may also be a hydrocarbon mixture, e.g. naphtha, is supplied via line 1, mixed with steam from line 2 and passed through a steam cracker 3. The steam cracker is heated in a manner known per se by burning a fuel, where by an indirect heat exchange the mixture to be cracked is briefly heated to temperatures in the range from 700 to 1000°Ci. Under these conditions, larger molecules are thermally cracked. Via line 4, a cracking mixture is withdrawn, which usually contains C2- to C20_olefins and also higher-boiling components. In a distillation 5, which may also have a multi-stage configuration, the desired fractions are separated from the mixture supplied. A first fraction, which contains C2- to C3-olefins, is discharged via line 7 and already represents a raw product. A second fraction, which contains olefins of the range C4 to C6, is withdrawn via line 8, and the heavier components are obtained in line 9.<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
To at least partly remove diolefins and in particular butadiene from the second fraction of line 8, two possibilities are represented in the drawing, which may also be utilized at the same time. The first possibility is to pass through the open valve 10 and line 11 to an extraction 12 in which butadiene is removed. This extraction operates in a manner known per se, for instance according to a process licensed by the firm BASF. Extracted butadiene is discharged through line 13.<br>
The second possibility for the further treatment consists in that the second fraction of line 8 is wholly or partly charged through the open valve 15 and line 16 to a hydrogena-tion 17, to which hydrogen gas is also supplied through line 18. In the hydrogenation, which operates catalytically in a manner known per se, diolefins are at least partly converted to olefins. The product of the hydrogenation 17 and the mixture from the extraction 12 are combined in line 20 and there is formed a mixture which here is referred to as intermediate product. This intermediate product consists of C4- to C6-olefins for at least 30 wt-% and preferably at least 50 wt-%.<br>
It is easily possible that the intermediate product of line 20 is wholly or only partly charged through line 22 to a reactor 23, in order to produce the desired C2- and C3-olefins. One process variant consists in that the intermediate product of line 20 is wholly or partly supplied through the open valve 25 and line 26 to an MTBE synthesis 27. By means of this synthesis, which operates in a manner known per se, MTBE is recovered, which is used as anti-knocking agent in fuels for prime movers. MTBE is withdrawn via line 28. The remaining gas mixture likewise reaches the reactor 23 through line 29.<br>
The reactor 23 contains a bed of a granular, form-selective zeolite catalyst. At temperatures of 300 to 700°C in the bed<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
the feed material supplied via lines 22 and 29 is largely converted to C2- and C3-olefins.<br>
The product mixture coming from the reactor 23 is withdrawn via line 30 and cooled to temperatures of about 30 to 80°C in a cooler 31, so that water and gasoline will condense out. The condensate-containing mixture flows through line 32 to a separator 33- From the separator, water is withdrawn through line 34, in line 35 an organic gas phase is obtained, and through line 3 6 a product gas is withdrawn. The product gas contains the desired products ethylene and propylene. To separate the valuable substances ethylene and propylene, the gas of line 36 can be supplied to a separating means not represented.<br>
The organic gas phase 35 is partly condensed in the distillation column 38 and divided into a gaseous phase containing C4-olefins, which gaseous phase is withdrawn through line 39, and into a liguid phase, which is withdrawn through line 40.<br>
Examples:<br>
There is employed a plant corresponding to the drawing, and 89 t/h naphtha, 6 t/h ethane and 42 t/h steam are supplied to the steam cracker 3. The data of the examples have been calculated in part, all compositions (in wt-%) are indicated without the steam content. The cracking mixture leaving the steam cracker via line 4 with a temperature of 380°C has the composition indicated in Table I, column A (in wt-%):<br><br>

Upon cooling and fractionating there is obtained a first fraction with the composition indicated in Table I, column B and a second fraction with the composition indicated in col-' umn C. This second fraction is further processed in various ways, which are described in Examples 1 to 4:<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
Example 1:<br>
With the valve 15 closed, the second fraction is supplied through line 11 to a butadiene extraction 12 known per se, and in line 20 an intermediate product with the composition in accordance with Table I, column D is obtained. This intermediate product is charged into the reactor 23 with an inlet temperature of 500°C and with a weight ratio H20 : hydrocarbons of 1.8 : 1, the zeolite catalyst is described in U.S. patent 5,981,819 (Examples). In line 36, a product fraction with the composition in accordance with Table I, column E is obtained, which together with the first fraction (Table I, column B) is passed through a gas separation plant to recover the end products ethylene and propylene in the desired purity. A second product fraction, which is obtained in line 39 and has the composition in accordance with Table I, column F, will be added to the cracking mixture of line 4, whereby the yield of ethylene and propylene can be increased.<br>
Example 2:<br>
The procedure is as in Example 1, but with the valve 21 closed the intermediate product of line 20 is supplied through line 26 to an MTBE synthesis 27 known per se, where isobutylene is reacted with methanol to form MTBE, and this product is withdrawn through line 28. The remaining mixture, which flows to the reactor 23 via line 29, has the composition indicated in Table I, column G. The reaction in the reactor 23 is effected under the same conditions as in Example 1, which is also true for the subsequent separation of ethylene and propylene.<br>
Example 3:<br>
A second fraction with the composition indicated in Table II, column A (in wt-%) is obtained in line 8.<br><br>

With the valve 10 closed, this second fraction together with hydrogen from line 18 is supplied through line 16 to a partial hydrogenation 17 on a commercially available Pd/Al203 catalyst disposed in a fixed bed. The mixture withdrawn from<br>
the hydrogenation has the composition indicated in Table II, column B, and it is supplied to the reactor 23 through lines 20 and 21. The procedure takes place in the reactor 23 and subsequently as shown in Example 1, the product stream of line 36 has the composition in accordance with Table II, column C, and column D indicates the composition of the gas mixture of line 39.<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
Example 4:<br>
The procedure first of all takes place with the valve 10 closed, as in Example 3, the valve 21 is now also kept closed, and the intermediate product of line 20 - Table II, column B - is supplied to the MTBE synthesis 27. Upon separating the MTBE produced, a mixture with the composition in accordance with Table II, column E is withdrawn via line 29 and supplied to the reactor 23, which is operated as described in Example 1. The composition of the product of line 36 is indicated in Table II, column F. Column G indicates the composition in line 39.<br><br>
