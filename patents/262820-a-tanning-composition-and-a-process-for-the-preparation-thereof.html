				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of synthetic tanning agent for improved leather characteristics. More particularly, the present invention provides a process for the manufacture of synthetic tanning agent for improved leather characteristics prepared from natural and proteinous solid materials. It is envisaged to have potential application in leather industry for making leathers, whereby the combination of synthetic tanning agents can be substituted in the conventional post tanning operation by a single synthetic tanning agent.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Post tanning operation, in general, attempt the addition of aesthetic values and improvement of functional properties of leather (Fred O'Flaherty, Roddy, T.W. and Lollar, R.M. The Chemistry and Technology of Leather, Vol II, Type of tannages', Rober E. Krieger Publishing Co, Florida, 1978). Retanning, dyeing and fatliquoring are the major steps of post tanning operations (Eckhart Heidemann. Fundamentals of Leather Manufacture, Roetherdruck, Darmstadt Eduard Roether KG Cop, 1993). Leather is a crosslinked three-dimensional anisotropic collagen fiber network, functional properties of which vary from location to location. The market value of the leather lies on the profitable utilization of its area. Orientation and compaction of collagen fiber are the main determining factors for over all performance of the final leather. Hence, the application of suitable polymeric materials as synthetic tanning agents in post tanning operation can alter the determining factors.<br>
Generally, the tanned leathers are retanned with a combination of synthetic tanning agents to enhance the properties such as fullness, grain tightness, grain smoothness and roundness. Synthetic tanning agents primarily employ condensates of phenol, naphthalene, urea, melamine, low molecular weight acrylic resins and polyamides as raw materials. The functional<br><br>
Characteristics of leather are based on the type of synthetic tanning agent employed in the post tanning. Phenol-formaldehyde condensates based synthetic tanning agent provide uniform filling in all regions of leather. Synthetic tanning agents based on acrylics result in grain tightness and selective filling of the looser areas of leather. The use of natural materials such as vegetable tannins, lignin and polysaccharides enhances the overall filling and grain characteristics. Combination of synthetic tanning agents comprising of phenol-formaldehyde, acrylics and natural materials are employed to obtain functional properties in leathers as mentioned above. Many of these chemicals are toxic and slow biodegradable and hence affect the environment significantly.<br>
Acrylic based tanning and retanning systems have been reported (US Patent No. 2,205,882 and<br>
US Patent No. 2,205,883). The disadvantages of acrylic products are that they considerably<br>
lighten the color of the leather and, when too large an amount is used, lead to a rubber-like feel<br>
of the leather. In order to avoid this, acrylics may also be grafted onto water-soluble proteins or<br>
polysaccharides. Such acrylic synthetic tanning agents have been prepared by graft<br>
polymerization of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid onto a mixture of sulfated fish oil and alginic<br>
acid by Lakshminarayana et al (Journal of the American Leather Chemists Association, 85, 425,<br>
1990). Acrylic based retanning agents containing protein hydrolysates obtained from solid<br>
wastes like leather shavings, as a component of polymerization have also been reported by<br>
Kanagaraj et al (Journal of the American Leather Chemists Association, 97, 207, 2002) Further,<br>
acrylic acid modified products based on chitosan, alginic acid etc. are biodegradable and find<br>
use in bone implants and drug delivery systems as reported by Berger et al (European Journal<br>
of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics, 57, 19, 2004). Alginates, a natural biopolymer<br>
obtained from seaweeds, find its application in pharmaceutical, food, textile, polymer and<br>
leather industries. Graft co-polyrner of acrylics and alginate have been reported as a retanning<br>
as well as chrome exhaustive aid in leather processing by Venba et al (Science	and<br><br>
Technology for Leather into the Next Millennium, Tata McGraw-Hill Publishing Company Ltd., New Delhi, p. 220, 1999). The use of protein hydroylsates in leather processing as filling agent during post tanning has been reported by Chen et al (Journal of American Leather Chemists Association, 96, 262, 2001) and as chrome exhaust aid by Ramamurthy et al (Journal of the Society of Leather Technologists and Chemists, 73, 168, 1989).<br>
However, no attempt has been made for the preparation of a synthetic tanning agent using natural and proteinous waste materials, which provide desired properties such as better fibre lubrication, filling of looser ends, softness, shape retention and fabrication comforts without combining with other synthetic tanning agents.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is thus to provide a process for the preparation of synthetic tanning agent, which by itself provides improved leather characteristics without combining with other synthetic tanning agents.<br>

Yet another objective of the invention is use of proteins, preferably as their hydrolysates from<br><br>
The jproteinous wastes of leather industry in tanning.<br>

Description of the Invention<br>
The process of the present invention is described below in detail.<br>
Solutions of biopolymer such as sodium alginate, starch and carrageenan in the concentration range of 0.5-10% is prepared using water at a temperature of 80°C in a thermostatic three necked reactor. To this 10-25% w/w protein hydrolysate (based on the weight of the biopolymer) from proteinous wastes is added and then stirred for 10 min. Subsequently, 1% w/w sodium metabisulfite (based on the weight of the acrylic acid) is added to the reactor and stirred for 5 min. Acrylic acid dissolved in 400% v/v water (based on the weight of the acrylic acid) and 2%<br><br>
botassium persulfate (based on the weight of the acrylic acid) dissolved in 3000% v/w water (based on the weight of the potassium persulfate) are added into the reactor simultaneously through two different necks of the reactor and stirred for 30 min. Finally, the viscous solution is stirred for 30 min at 60°C and then at 70°C for 30 min or till such time the product was devoid of any monomer smell. The resultant product is cooled to room temperature. The cooled solution is neutralized to a pH 4.5-5.0 using 0.5-2% w/v alkali or mixture of alkalis (based on the weight of the acrylic acid) with continuous stirring if required.<br>
The inventive step of the present invention lies in the preparation of a synthetic tanning agent by blending the solution of biopolymer, protein hydrolysate, sodium metabisulphite and simultaneous addition of acrylic acid and potassium persulphate under continuous stirring. The product thus obtained provides improved properties to the final leather.<br>
