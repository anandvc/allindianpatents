STRIP-CASTING PLANT<br>
The invention relates to a strip-casting plant, in particular for the strip-casting of steel.<br>
During the strip-casting of steel, it is possible to select, in a substantially optimal manner, the casting thickness of the strip (e.g. about 10 mm) , as a factor depending on the required thickness of the hot strip on completion of rolling (1 to 3 mm) , and for ensuring satisfactory material properties during the necessary hot deformation process.<br>
An apparatus for the continuous casting of metal is known from DE 31 42 099, said apparatus comprising a feeding means for liquid metal, a carrier belt for liquid and solidified metal, and lateral boundaries which abut closely against the carrier belt. The lateral boundaries are attached to the carrier belt in the manner of a link chain.<br>
A construction of this kind is technically relatively complicated. In addition, it is, essentially, suitable only for relatively narrow strip breadths. In broader strip breadths, the stress in the carrier, as a result of the thermal load, is considerably greater than in narrow strips, such that, for broad strip breadths, it is not possible to use the construction of the chain-like revolving lateral boundaries,<br><br>
which serve as reinforcing.<br>
In the instance where the lateral boundary is stationary relative to the direction of transportation of the cast strip, or relative to the carrier, an adhesion of the solidified steel will occur sporadically in the course of the casting process. This results in major defects in the strip and interruptions in operations, including a stoppage in the casting operation. Similar problems arise with regard to the feeding means. Here, too, an adhesion of solidified steel occurs sporadically, resulting in the same difficulties.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object to provide a strip-casting plant in which the adhesion of solidified steel to the feeding means . and to the lateral boundaries is at least inhibited in a reliable manner.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a strip-casting plant, comprising a feeding means for liquid metal, a carrier belt for liquid and solidified metal and lateral boundaries closely abutting against the carrier belt, wherein the feeding means and/or the lateral boundaries are designed to oscillate, in particular in the plane of the carrier belt, and are connected to a means for generating oscillations.<br>
This object is met in that the feeding means and/or the lateral boundaries are designed to oscillate in the plane of the carrier belt and are connected to a means for generating<br><br>
oscillations.  As a result hereof, it is possible to prevent the adhesion of solidified material.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the oscillations of the feeding means and/or the lateral boundaries are provided substantially vertically relative to the direction of transportation of the strip. The oscillation thus takes place in the plane of the carrier belt, or of the steel strip cast, but in a direction transversely relative to the direction of transportation. The advantage hereof is that the structural complexity is reduced when compared to an oscillation in the direction of transportation, in which case it would be necessary for the lateral boundary to be controlled accurately along the entire length. In addition, in the present embodiment, it is possible in an advantageous manner for the oscillation to be adjusted in an optimal manner in the region of the metallurgical length (from the pouring region and up to the thorough solidification of the strip), for example by subdividing the lateral boundaries in this region into individual sections, each having an optimal frequency and amplitude.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment, the side-wall boundaries are adjustable at an angle relative to one another. This applies not only to oppositely-disposed side-wall boundaries, but also to the sections which are optionally provided on the respective side. As a result hereof, it is possible for the uniformity of the strip thickness to be<br><br>
improved on the cast strip across the entire breadth. The lateral boundaries are, in particular, also inclined relative to the vertical line in the direction of the surface of the carrier belt.<br>
According to a preferred exemplified embodiment, the side-wall boundaries are water-cooled hollow profiles.<br>
The means for generating the, oscillations are preferably eccentric drives, while it is also possible for electromagnets or hydraulic cylinders to be used. The oscillation mode may, inter alia, be sinusoidal, saw-tooth-like or trapezoidal. It is possible for the stroke frequency to be, for example, 50 Hz, for a stroke, for example, of 0.5 mm. The cooling water is supplied via flexible tubes. In the instance of a cover, which is preferably provided over the cast strip, a layer of temperature-resistant sealing material, in particular of a ceramic-fibre matting, is arranged to serve as sealing means between the lateral boundaries and the coverings. A corresponding sealing means is provided between the feeding means and the carrier belt, an aluminium sheet preferably also being inserted between the carrier belt and the sealing means, such that only a relative movement between the matting layer and the aluminium sheet takes place during an oscillation. The feeding means and the lateral boundaries are preferably secured by means of helical springs.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment, it is possible for<br><br>
the boundaries to oscillate simultaneously vertically and also parallel to the movement of the strip (direction of casting), so as to provide an overall shearing force on the edge of the strip and acting in the direction of casting-  In particular, the oscillation has components in all three dimensions.<br>
In addition, it is possible for the oscillations to take place vertically relative to the surface of strip.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the oscillations are stimulated by blows in the longitudinal and transverse directions of the lateral boundaries. As a result hereof, it is possible to produce sudden longitudinal waves, effectively preventing any adhesions.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
