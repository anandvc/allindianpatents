Description<br>
Cycloalkyl-substituted alkanoic acid derivatives, methods for the production thereof, and use thereof as a medicament<br>
The invention relates to arylcycloalkyl-substituted alkanoic acid derivatives and to their physiologically acceptable salts and physiologically functional derivatives.<br>
Compounds of a similar structure have already been described in the prior art for the treatment of hyperlipidemia and diabetes (WO 2000/64876).<br>
It was an object of the invention to provide compounds which allow a therapeutically exploitable modulation of the lipid and/or carbohydrate metabolism and are thus suitable for the prevention and/or treatment of diseases such as type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis and the various sequelae thereof.<br>
Surprisingly, a series of compounds which modulate the activity of PPAR receptors has been found. In particular, the compounds are suitable for the activation of PPARalpha and PPARgamma, and the extent of the relative activation can be different depending on the compounds.<br>
Accordingly, the invention relates to compounds of the formula I<br><br>
in which<br>
Ring A        is (C3-C8)-cycloalkanediyl or (C3-C8)-cycloalkenediyl, where in the<br>

The present invention also encompasses all combinations of the "preferred embodiments" of the invention described herein.<br>
The alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl radicals in the substituents R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 can be straight-chain or branched.<br>
Aryl refers to an aromatic, carbocyclic, mono- or bicyclic ring system which contains from 6 to 10 atoms in the ring or in the rings.<br>
Heteroaryl is a mono- or bicyclic aromatic ring system having from 4 to 11 ring members, in which at least one atom in the ring system is a heteroatom from the group of N, O and S.<br>
The compounds of the formula I contain at least two centers of asymmetry and may contain more. The compounds of the formula I may therefore be present in the form of their racemates, racemic mixtures, pure enantiomers, diastereomers and diastereomer mixtures. The present invention encompasses all of these isomeric forms of the compounds of the formula I. These isomeric forms may,<br><br>
even when some of them are not described expresses verbis, be obtained by known methods.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are particularly suitable for medical applications because of their greater solubility in water compared with the starting or base compounds. These salts must have a pharmaceutically acceptable anion or cation. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the invention are salts of inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic, phosphoric, metaphosphoric, nitric and sulfuric acids, and of organic acids such as, for example, acetic acid, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, citric, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glycolic, isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, maleic, malic, methanesulfonic, succinic, p-toluenesulfonic and tartaric acids. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable basic salts are ammonium salts, alkali metal salts (such as sodium and potassium salts) and alkaline earth metal salts (such as magnesium and calcium salts) and salts of trometamol (2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol), diethanolamine, lysine or ethylenediamine.<br>
Salts with a pharmaceutically unacceptable anion such as, for example, trifluoroacetate likewise belong within the scope of the invention as useful intermediates for the preparation or purification of pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts and/or for use in nontherapeutic, for example in vitro, applications.<br>
The term "physiologically functional derivative" used herein refers to any physiologically tolerated derivative of a compound of the formula I of the invention, for example an ester which is able, on administration to a mammal such as, for example, to a human, to form (directly or indirectly) a compound of the formula I or an active metabolite thereof.<br>
Physiologically functional derivatives also include prodrugs of the compounds of the invention, as described, for example, in H. Okada et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1994, 42, 57-61. Such prodrugs can be metabolized in vivo to a compound of the invention. These prodrugs may themselves have activity or not.<br><br>
The compounds of the invention may also exist in various polymorphous forms, for example as amorphous and crystalline polymorphous forms. All polymorphous forms of the compounds of the invention belong within the scope of the invention and are a further aspect of the invention.<br>
All references hereinafter to "compound(s) of formula I" refer to compound(s) of the formula I as described above, and to the salts, solvates and physiologically functional derivatives thereof as described herein.<br>
Use<br>
This invention relates further to the use of compounds of the formula I and their pharmaceutical compositions as PPAR receptor ligands. The PPAR receptor ligands of the invention are suitable as modulators of the activity of the PPAR receptors.<br>
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) are transcription factors which can be activated by ligands and belong to the class of nuclear hormone receptors. There are three PPAR isoforms, PPARalpha, PPARgamma and PPARdelta, which are encoded by different genes (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR): structure, mechanisms of activation and diverse functions: Motojima K, Cell Struct Fund, 1993 Oct, 18(5), 267-77).<br>
There exist two variants of PPARgamma, PPARgammai and -gamma2, which are the result of alternative use of promoters and differential mRNA splicing (Vidal-Puig et al.f J. Clin. Invest., 97:2553-2561, 1996). The various PPAR receptors have a different tissue distribution and modulate different physiological functions. The PPAR receptors play a key role in different aspects of the regulation of a multitude of genes, whose gene products are crucially involved directly or indirectly in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Thus, for example, PPARalpha receptors play an important role in the regulation of fatty acid catabolism or lipoprotein metabolism in the liver, while PPARgamma is crucially involved, for example, in the regulation of adipose cell differentiation.<br>
In addition, PPAR receptors are also involved in the regulation of many further physiological processes, including those which are not directly connected with carbohydrate or lipid metabolism. The activity of the different PPAR receptors can be modulated to varying extents by various fatty acids, fatty acid derivatives and synthetic compounds. For relevant reviews concerning functions, physiological effect and pathophysiology, see: Joel Berger et al., Annu. Rev. Med., 2002, 53,<br><br>
409 - 435; Timothy Wilson et alM J. Med. Chem., 2000, Vol. 43, No. 4, 527-550; Steven Kliewer et al., Recent Prog Horm Res., 2001, 56, 239-63. The present invention relates to compounds of the formula I which are suitable for modulating the activity of PPAR receptors, especially the activity of PPARalpha and PPARgamma. Depending on the profile of the modulation, the compounds of the formula I are suitable for the treatment, control and prophylaxis of the indications described hereinafter, and for a series of other, connected pharmaceutical applications (see, for example, Joel Berger et al., Annu. Rev. Med., 2002, 53, 409 - 435; Timothy Wilson et al., J. Med. Chem., 2000, Vol. 43(4), 527-550; Steven Kliewer et al., Recent Prog Horm Res., 2001, 56, 239-63; Jean-Charles Fruchart, Bart Staeis and Patrick Duriez: PPARS, Metabolic Disease and Arteriosclerosis, Pharmacological Research, Vol. 44, No. 5, 345-52, 2001; Sander Kersten, Beatrice Desvergne &amp; Walter Wahli: Roles of PPARs in health and disease, NATURE, VOL. 405, 25 MAY 2000, 421-4; Ines Pineda Torra, Giulia Chinetti, Caroline Duval, Jean-Charles Fruchart and Bart Staeis: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors: from transcriptional control to clinical practice, Curr Opin Lipidol 12:2001, 245-254).<br>

Formulation<br>
The amount of a compound of formula I necessary to achieve the desired biological effect depends on a number of factors, for example the specific compound chosen, the intended use, the mode of administration and the clinical condition of the patient. The daily dose is generally in the range from 0.001 mg to<br><br>
100 mg (typically from 0.01 mg to 50 mg) per day and per kilogram of body weight, for example 0.1-10 mg/kg/day. An intravenous dose may be, for example, in the range from 0.001 mg to LOmg/kg, which can suitably be administered as an infusion of 10 ng to 100 ng per kilogram per minute. Suitable infusion solutions for these purposes may contain, for example, from 0.1 ng to 10 mg, typically from 1 ng to 10 mg, per milliliter. Single doses may contain, for example, from 1 mg to 10 g of the active compound. Thus, ampoules for injections may contain, for example, from 1 mg to 100 mg, and single-dose formulations which can be administered orally, such as, for example, capsules or tablets, may contain, for example, from 0.05 to 1000 mg, typically from 0.5 to 600 mg. For the therapy of the abovementioned conditions, the compounds of formula I may be used as the compound itself, but they are preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition with an acceptable carrier. The carrier must, of course, be acceptable in the sense that it is compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and is not harmful for the patient's health. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid or both and is preferably formulated with the compound as a single dose, for example as a tablet, which may contain from 0.05% to 95% by weight of the active compound. Other pharmaceutically active substances may likewise be present, including other compounds of formula I. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be produced by one of the known pharmaceutical methods, which essentially consist of mixing the ingredients with pharmacologically acceptable carriers and/or excipients.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, peroral (for example sublingual) and parenteral (for example subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal or intravenous) administration, although the most suitable mode of administration depends in each individual case on the nature and severity of the condition to be treated and on the nature of the compound of formula I used in each case. Coated formulations and coated slow-release formulations also belong within the scope of the invention. Preference is given to acid- and gastric juice-resistant formulations. Suitable coatings resistant to gastric juice comprise cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate and anionic polymers of methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate.<br><br>
Suitable pharmaceutical preparations for oral administration may be in the form of separate units such as, for example, capsules, wafers, suckable tablets or tablets, each of which contain a defined amount of the compound of formula I; as powders or granules, as solution or suspension in an aqueous or nonaqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. These compositions may, as already mentioned, be prepared by any suitable pharmaceutical method which includes a step in which the active compound and the carrier (which may consist of one or more additional ingredients) are brought into contact. The compositions are generally produced by uniform and homogeneous mixing of the active compound with a liquid and/or finely divided solid carrier, after which the product is shaped if necessary. Thus, for example, a tablet can be produced by compressing or molding a powder or granules of the compound, where appropriate with one or more additional ingredients. Compressed tablets can be produced by tableting the compound in free-flowing form such as, for example, a powder or granules, where appropriate mixed with a binder, glidant, inert diluent and/or one or more surface-active/dispersing agent(s) in a suitable machine.

Determination of EC50 values of PPAR agonists in the cellular PPARalpha test<br>
Principle<br>
The potency of substances which bind to human PPARalpha and activate it in an agonistic manner is analyzed using a stably transfected HEK cell line (HEK= human embryo kidney) which is referred to here as PPARalpha reporter cell line. It contains two genetic elements, a luciferase reporter element (pdeltaM-GAL4-Luc-Zeo) and a PPARalpha fusion protein (GR-GAL4-humanPPARalpha-LBD) which mediates expression of the luciferase reporter element depending on a PPARalpha ligand. The stably and constitutively expressed fusion protein GR-GAL4-humanPPARalpha-LBD binds in the cell nucleus of the PPARalpha reporter cell line via the GAL4 protein portion to the GAL4 DNA binding motif 5'-upstream of the luciferase reporter element which is integrated in the genome of the cell line. There is only little expression of the luciferase reporter gene without addition of a PPARalpha ligand if fatty acid-depleted fetal calf serum (cs-FCS) is used in the test. PPARalpha ligands bind and activate the PPARalpha fusion protein and thereby bring about expression of the luciferase reporter gene. The luciferase which is formed can be detected by means of chemiluminescence via an appropriate substrate.<br><br>
Construction of the cell line<br>
The PPARalpha reporter cell line was prepared in 2 stages. Firstly, the luciferase reporter element was constructed and stably transfected into HEK cells. For this purpose, five binding sites of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (in each case 5'-CGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGAG-3') were cloned in 5'-upstream of a 68 bp-long minimal MMTV promoter (Accession #V01175), The minimal MMTV promoter section contains a CCAAT box and a TATA element in order to enable efficient transcription by RNA polymerase II. The cloning and sequencing of the GAL4-MMTV construct took place in analogy to the description of Sambrook J. et. al. (Molecular cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989). Then the complete Photinus pyralis luciferase gene (Accession # M15077) was cloned in 3'-downstream of the GAL4-MMTV element. After sequencing, the luciferase reporter element consisting of five GAL4 binding sites, MMTV promoter and luciferase gene was recloned into a plasmid which confers zeozin resistance in order to obtain the plasmid pdeltaM-GAL4-Luc-Zeo. This vector was transfected into HEK cells in accordance with the statements in Ausubel, F.M. et al. (Current protocols in molecular biology, Vol. 1-3, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1995). Then zeozin-containing medium (0.5 mg/ml) was used to select a suitable stable cell clone which showed very low basal expression of the luciferase gene. In a second step, the PPARalpha fusion protein (GR-GAL4»humanPPARalpha-LBD) was introduced into the stable cell clone described. For this purpose, initially the cDNA coding for the N-terminal 76 amino acids of the glucocorticoid receptor (Accession # P04150) was linked to the cDNA section coding for amino acids 1-147 of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (Accession # P04386). The cDNA of the ligand-binding domain of the human PPARalpha receptor (amino acids S167-Y468; Accession #S74349) was cloned in at the 3' end of this GR-GAL4 construct. The fusion construct prepared in this way (GR-GAL4-humanPPARalpha-LBD) was recloned into the plasmid pcDNA3 (from Invitrogen) in order to enable constitutive expression therein by the cytomegalovirus promoter. This plasmid was linearized with a restriction endonuclease and stably transfected into the previously described cell clone containing the luciferase reporter element. The finished PPARalpha reporter cell line which contains a luciferase reporter element and constitutively expresses the PPARalpha fusion protein (GR-GAL4-human PPARalpha-LBD) was isolated by selection with zeozin (0.5 mg/ml) and G418 (0.5 mg/ml).<br>
Test procedure<br><br>
The activity of PPARalpha agonists is determined in a 3-day test, described below:<br>
Day 1<br>
The PPARalpha reporter cell line is cultivated up to 80% confluence in DMEM (#41965-039, Invitrogen) with the following additives: 10% cs-FCS (fetal calf serum, #SH-30068.03, Hyclone), 0.5 mg/ml of zeozin (#R250-01, Invitrogen), 0.5 mg/ml of G418 (#10131-027, Invitrogen), 1% penicillin streptomycin solution (#15140-122, Invitrogen) and 2mM of L-glutamine (#25030-024, Invitrogen). Cultivation is carried out in standard cell culture bottles (# 353112, Becton Dickinson) in a cell culture incubator at 37°C in the presence of 5% C02. The 80% confluent cells are washed once with 15 ml of PBS (#14190-094, Invitrogen), treated with 3 ml of trypsin solution (#25300-054, Invitrogen) at 37°C for 2 min, taken up in 5 ml of the DMEM medium described and counted in a cell counter. After dilution to 500 000 cells/ml, in each case 35 000 cells are sown into each well of a 96-well microtiter plate having a clear plastic bottom (#3610, Corning Costar). The plates are incubated in a cell incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 h.<br>
Day 2<br>
The PPARalpha agonists to be tested are dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM. This stock solution is diluted in DMEM (#41965-039, Invitrogen) to which 5% of cs-FCS (#SH-30068.03, Hyclone), 2 mM of L-glutamine (#25030-024, Invitrogen) and the antibiotics already described (zeozin, G418, penicillin and streptomycin) are added.<br>
Test substances are tested at 11 different concentrations in the range of from 10 nM to 100 pM. More potent compounds are tested in concentration ranges of from 1 pM to 10 pM or between 100 nM and 1 pM.<br>
The medium of the PPARalpha reporter cell line sown on day 1 is completely removed by aspiration, and, immediately, the test substances diluted in medium are added to the cells. Dilution and addition of the substances are carried out using a robot (Beckman FX). The end volume of the test substances diluted in medium is 100 pi per well of a 96-well microtiter plate. The DMSO concentration in the test is below 0.1 % v/v to prevent cytotoxic effects of the solvent. To demonstrate that the test is working in each individual plate, a standard PPARalpha agonist, which is also diluted to 11  different concentrations, was<br><br>
To demonstrate that the test is working in each individual plate, a standard PPARalpha agonist, which is also diluted to 11 different concentrations, was added to each plate. The test plates are incubated in an incubator at 37°C and 5% C02for24h.<br>
Day 3<br>
The PPARalpha receptor cells treated with the test substances are removed from the incubator and the medium is aspirated off. The cells are lyzed by pipetting 50 IJ\ of Bright Glo reagent (from Promega) into each well of a 96-well microtiter plate. After incubation at room temperature in the dark for 10 minutes, the microtiter plates are measured in the luminometer (Trilux from Wallac). The measuring time for each well of a microtiter plate is 1 sec.<br>
Evaluation<br>
The crude data of the luminometer are exported into a Microsoft Excel file. Dose-activity curves and EC50 values of PPAR agonists are calculated using the program XL.Fit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (IDBS).<br>
The PPARalpha EC50 values for the compounds of examples 1 to 15 in this assay are in the range from 0.04 nM to &gt; 10 jaM.<br>
The results for the activity of some compounds of the formula I according to the invention are listed in table I below:<br><br><br><br>
It is evident from table I that the compounds of the formula i according to the invention activate the PPARalpha receptor, thus effecting, for example, analogously to clinically used fibrates, a lowering of the triglyceride concentration in the organism (see, for example, J.-Ch. Fruchard et al.: PPARS, Metabolic Disease and Atherosclerosis, Pharmacological Research, Vol. 44, No. 5, 345-52, 2001; S. Kersten et al.: Roles of PPARs in health and disease, NATURE, VOL 405, 25 MAY 2000, 421-4; I. Pineda et al.: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors: from transcriptional control to clinical practice, Curr Opin Lipidol 12: 2001,245-254).<br>
Determination of EC50 values of PPAR agonists in the cellular PPARgamma test<br>
Principle<br>
A transient transfection system is employed to determine the cellular PPARgamma activity of PPAR agonists. It is based on the use of a luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3basic-5xGAL4-TK) and of a PPARgamma expression plasmid (pcDNA3-GAL4-humanPPARgammaLBD). Both plasmids are transiently transfected into human embryonic kidney cells (HEK cells). There is then expression in these cells of the fusion protein GAL4-humanPPARgammaLBD which binds to the GAL4 binding sites of the reporter plasmid. In the presence of a PPARgamma-active ligand, the activated fusion protein GAL4-humanPPARgammaLBD induces expression of the luciferase reporter gene, which can be detected in the form of a chemiluminescence signal after addition of a luciferase substrate. As a difference<br><br>
from the stably transfected PPARalpha reporter cell line, in the cellular PPARgamma test the two components (luciferase reporter plasmid and PPARgamma expression plasmid) are transiently transfected into HEK cells because stable and permanent expression of the PPARgamma fusion protein is cytotoxic.<br>
Construction of the plasmids<br>
The luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3basic-5xGAL4-TK is based on the vector pGL3basic from Promega. The reporter piasmid is prepared by cloning five binding sites of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (each binding site with the sequence 5'-CTCGGAGGACAGTACTCCG-3'), together with a 160 bp-long thymidine kinase promoter section (Accession # AF027128) 5'-upstream into pGL3basic. 3'-downstream of the thymidine kinase promoter is the complete luciferase gene from Photinus pyralis (Accession # M15077) which is already a constituent of the plasmid pGL3basic used. The cloning and sequencing of the reporter plasmid pGL3basic-5xGAL4-TK took place in analogy to the description in Sambrook J. et. al. (Molecular cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989). The PPARgamma expression plasmid pcDNA3-GAL4-humanPPARgammaLBD was prepared by first cloning the cDNA coding for amino acids 1-147 of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (Accession # P04386) into the plasmid pcDNA3 (from Invitrogen) 3'-downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Subsequently, the cDNA of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the human PPARgamma receptor (amino acids I152-Y475; Accession # g1480099) was cloned 3'-downstream of the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Cloning and sequencing of the PPARgamma expression plasmid pcDNA3-GAL4-humanPPARgammaLBD again took place in analogy to the description in Sambrook J. et. al. (Molecular cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989). Besides the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3basic-5xGAL4-TK and the PPARgamma expression plasmid pcDNA3-GAL4-humanPPARgammaLBD, also used for the cellular PPARgamma test are the reference plasmid pRL-CMV (from Promega) and the plasmid pBluescript-SK(+) from Stratagene. All four plasmids were prepared using a plasmid preparation kit from Qiagen, which ensures a plasmid quality with a minimal endotoxin content, before transfection into HEK cells.<br><br>
Test procedure<br>
The activity of PPARgamma agonists is determined in a 4-day test which is described below. Before the transfection, HEK cells are cultivated in DMEM (#41965-039, Invitrogen) which is mixed with the following additions: 10% FCS (#16000-044, Invitrogen), 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (#15140-122, Invitrogen) and 2 mM L-glutamine (#25030-024, Invitrogen).<br>
Day 1<br>
Firstly, solution A, a transfection mixture which contains all four plasmids previously described in addition to DMEM, is prepared. The following amounts are used to make up 3 ml of solution A for each 96-well microtiter plate for one test: 2622 |jl of antibiotic- and serum-free DMEM (# 41965-039, Invitrogen), 100 pi of reference plasmid pRL-CMV (1 ng/pl), 100 pi of luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3basic-5xGAL4-TK (10 ng/pl), 100 pi of PPARgamma expression plasmid pcDNA3-GAL4-humanPPARgammaLBD (100 ng/pl) and 78 pi of plasmid pBluescript-SK(+) (500 ng/pl). Then 2 ml of solution B are prepared by mixing 1.9 ml of DMEM-(# 41965-039, Invitrogen) with 100 pi of PolyFect transfection reagent (from Qiagen) for each 96-well microtiter plate. Subsequently, 3 ml of solution A are mixed with 2 ml of solution B to give 5 ml of solution C, which is thoroughly mixed by multiple pipetting and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. 80%-confluent HEK cells from a cell culture bottle with a capacity of 175 cm2 are washed once with 15 ml of PBS (#14190-094, Invitrogen) and treated with 3 ml of trypsin solution (#25300-054, Invitrogen) at 37°C for 2 min. The cells are then taken up in 15 ml of DMEM (#41965-039, Invitrogen) which is mixed with 10% FCS (# 16000-044, Invitrogen), 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (#15140-122, Invitrogen) and 2 mM L-glutamine (#25030-024, Invitrogen). After the cell suspension has been counted in a cell counter, the suspension is diluted to 250 000 cells/ml. 15 ml of this cell suspension are mixed with 5 ml of solution C for one microtiter plate. 200 pi of the suspension are seeded in each well of a 96-well microtiter plate with a clear plastic base (#3610, Corning Costar). The plates are incubated in a cell culture incubator at 37°C and 5% C02 for 24 h.<br><br>
Day 2<br>
PPAR agonists to be tested are dissolved in DMSO in a concentration of 10 mM.<br>
This stock solution is diluted in DMEM (# 41965-039, Invitrogen) which is mixed with 2% Ultroser (#12039-012, Biosepra), 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (#15140-122, Invitrogen) and 2 mM L-glutamine (#25030-024, Invitrogen). Test substances are tested in a total of 11 different concentrations in the range from 10 |JM to 100 pM. More potent compounds are tested in concentration ranges from 1 ptol0pM.<br>
The medium of the HEK cells transfected and seeded on day 1 is completely removed by aspiration, and the test substances diluted in medium are immediately added to the cells. The dilution and addition of the substances is carried out by a robot (Beckman FX). The final volume of the test substances diluted in medium is 100 pi per well of a 96-well microtiter plate. Each plate is charged with a standard PPARgamma agonist, which is likewise diluted in 11 different concentrations, in order to demonstrate the functioning of the test in each individual plate. The test plates are incubated in an incubator at 37°C and 5% C02for 48 h.<br>
Day 4<br>
After removal of the medium by aspiration, 50 \i\ of Dual-Glo™ reagent (Dual-<br>
Glo™ Luciferase Assay System; Promega) are added to each well in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions in order to lyze the cells and provide the substrate for the firefly luciferase (Photinus pyralis) formed in the cells. After incubation at room temperature in the dark for 10 minutes, the firefly luciferase-mediated chemiluminescence is measured in a measuring instrument (measuring time/well 1 sec; Trilux from Wallac). Then 50 pi of the Dual-Glo™ Stop &amp; Glo reagent (Dual-Glo™ Luciferase Assay System; Promega) is added to each well in order to stop the activity of the firefly luciferase and provide the substrate for the Renilla luciferase expressed by the reference plasmid pRL-CMV. After incubation at room temperature in the dark for a further 10 minutes, the chemiluminescence mediated by the Renilla luciferase is again measured for 1 sec/well in the measuring instrument.<br>
Evaluation<br><br>
The crude data from the luminometer are transferred into a Microsoft Excel file.<br>
The firefly/Renilla luciferase activity ratio is determined for each measurement<br>
derived from one well of the microtiter plate. The dose-activity curves and EC50<br>
values of PPAR agonists are calculated from the ratios by the XL.Fit program as<br>
specified by the manufacturer (IDBS).<br>
PPARgamma EC50 values in the range from 160 nM  to &gt;10 //M were measured<br>
using the PPAR agonists described in this application.<br>

Methyl cis-3-(tert-butyl-diphenylsi!anyloxy)cyclohexanecarboxylate<br><br>
22 g of 6-oxabicycio[3.2.1]octan-7-one are dissolved in 200 ml of methanol, and 10% strength sodium methoxide solution is added until a pH of 10 is reached. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes and then neutralized by addition of dilute acetic acid, and the mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is dissolved in ethyl acetate, dried over magnesium sulfate and then concentrated under reduced pressure. This gives 21 g of the methyl ether as a colorless oil. This is dissolved in 200 ml of dimethylformamide, 43 g of tert-butyldiphenylsilyi chloride, 13 g of imidazole and 1 g of dimethylaminopyridine are added and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 12 hours. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the residue is taken up in methyl tert-butyl ether and washed with water. The organic phase is dried over magnesium sulfate and the solvent is then removed. This gives 56.8 g of methyl cis-3-(tert-butyl-diphenylsilanyloxy)cyclohexanecarboxylate as a yellow oil.<br><br>

36.8 g of cis-3-(tert-butyl-diphenylsilanyloxy)cyclohexanecarboxyIic acid are dissolved in 150 ml of isopropanol, and 8g of sodium hydroxide, dissolved in 50 ml of water, are added. The mixture is heated at 60°C for 1 hour. The reaction mixture is cooled and neutralized by addition of 2N hydrochloric acid. The reaction mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure and extracted with in each case 200 ml of ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases are dried over magnesium sulfate and the solvent is then removed under reduced pressure. This gives 34 g of the free acid as a colorless oil (Rf(ethyl acetate) = 0.63). This is dissolved in 250 ml of dimethylformamide, and 18.6 g of ferf-butyl L-valinate hydrochloride are added. At 0°C, 29.1 g of 0-[cyano(ethoxycarbonyl)methyleneamino]-1,1,3,3,-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate are added. After 10 minutes, the ice bath is removed and 23.9 g of hydroxybenzotriazole and 61.8 ml of Hunig base are added. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the resulting residue is dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed three times with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. The organic phase is dried over magnesium sulfate and the solvent is then removed. The residue is purified on silica gel using the mobile phase n-heptane:ethyl acetate 2:1.

The mixture is stirred at 60°C for 3 h and then concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue is purified on silica gel using the mobile phase n-heptane:ethyl acetate = 5:1 =&gt; 1:1. This gives 18 g of a white solid. Since this is still slightly impure, 8 g are subjected to another purification on silica gel.

After 2 hours of stirring at room temperature, another 3.4 ml of allyl bromide are metered in. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 12 hours, 200 ml of methyl tert-butyl ether are then added to the reaction mixture and the mixture is washed three times with in each case 100 ml of water. The organic phase is dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue is purified on silica gel using the mobile phase n-heptane:ethyl acetate = 40:1 =&gt; 10:1.

The alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl radicals in the substituents R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 can be straight-chain or branched.<br>
Aryl refers to an aromatic, carbocyclic, mono- or bicyclic ring system which contains from 6 to 10 atoms in the ring or in the rings.<br>
Heteroaryl is a mono- or bicyclic aromatic ring system having from 4 to 11 ring members, in which at least one atom in the ring system is a heteroatom from the group of N, O and S.<br>
The compounds of the formula I contain at least two centers of asymmetry and may contain more. The compounds of the formula I may therefore be present in the form of their racemates, racemic mixtures, pure enantiomers, diastereomers and diastereomer mixtures. The present invention encompasses all of these isomeric forms of the compounds of the formula I. These isomeric forms may,<br><br>
even when some of them are not described expresses verbis, be obtained by known methods.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are particularly suitable for medical applications because of their greater solubility in water compared with the starting or base compounds. These salts must have a pharmaceutically acceptable anion or cation. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the invention are salts of inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic, phosphoric, metaphosphoric, nitric and sulfuric acids, and of organic acids such as, for example, acetic acid, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, citric, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glycolic, isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, maleic, malic, methanesulfonic, succinic, p-toluenesulfonic and tartaric acids. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable basic salts are ammonium salts, alkali metal salts (such as sodium and potassium salts) and alkaline earth metal salts (such as magnesium and calcium salts) and salts of trometamol (2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol), diethanolamine, lysine or ethylenediamine.<br>
Salts with a pharmaceutically unacceptable anion such as, for example, trifluoroacetate likewise belong within the scope of the invention as useful intermediates for the preparation or purification of pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts and/or for use in nontherapeutic, for example in vitro, applications.<br>
The term "physiologically functional derivative" used herein refers to any physiologically tolerated derivative of a compound of the formula I of the invention, for example an ester which is able, on administration to a mammal such as, for example, to a human, to form (directly or indirectly) a compound of the formula I or an active metabolite thereof.<br>
Physiologically functional derivatives also include prodrugs of the compounds of the invention, as described, for example, in H. Okada et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1994, 42, 57-61. Such prodrugs can be metabolized in vivo to a compound of the invention. These prodrugs may themselves have activity or not.<br><br>
The compounds of the invention may also exist in various polymorphous forms, for example as amorphous and crystalline polymorphous forms. All polymorphous forms of the compounds of the invention belong within the scope of the invention and are a further aspect of the invention.<br>
All references hereinafter to "compound(s) of formula I" refer to compound(s) of the formula I as described above, and to the salts, solvates and physiologically functional derivatives thereof as described herein.<br>
Use<br>
This invention relates further to the use of compounds of the formula I and their pharmaceutical compositions as PPAR receptor ligands. The PPAR receptor ligands of the invention are suitable as modulators of the activity of the PPAR receptors.<br>
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) are transcription factors which can be activated by ligands and belong to the class of nuclear hormone receptors. There are three PPAR isoforms, PPARalpha, PPARgamma and PPARdelta, which are encoded by different genes (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR): structure, mechanisms of activation and diverse functions: Motojima K, Cell Struct Fund, 1993 Oct, 18(5), 267-77).<br>
There exist two variants of PPARgamma, PPARgammai and -gamma2, which are the result of alternative use of promoters and differential mRNA splicing (Vidal-Puig et al.f J. Clin. Invest., 97:2553-2561, 1996). The various PPAR receptors have a different tissue distribution and modulate different physiological functions. The PPAR receptors play a key role in different aspects of the regulation of a multitude of genes, whose gene products are crucially involved directly or indirectly in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Thus, for example, PPARalpha receptors play an important role in the regulation of fatty acid catabolism or lipoprotein metabolism in the liver, while PPARgamma is crucially involved, for example, in the regulation of adipose cell differentiation.<br>
In addition, PPAR receptors are also involved in the regulation of many further physiological processes, including those which are not directly connected with carbohydrate or lipid metabolism. The activity of the different PPAR receptors can be modulated to varying extents by various fatty acids, fatty acid derivatives and synthetic compounds.

Formulation<br>
The amount of a compound of formula I necessary to achieve the desired biological effect depends on a number of factors, for example the specific compound chosen, the intended use, the mode of administration and the clinical condition of the patient. The daily dose is generally in the range from 0.001 mg to<br><br>
100 mg (typically from 0.01 mg to 50 mg) per day and per kilogram of body weight, for example 0.1-10 mg/kg/day. An intravenous dose may be, for example, in the range from 0.001 mg to LOmg/kg, which can suitably be administered as an infusion of 10 ng to 100 ng per kilogram per minute. Suitable infusion solutions for these purposes may contain, for example, from 0.1 ng to 10 mg, typically from 1 ng to 10 mg, per milliliter. Single doses may contain, for example, from 1 mg to 10 g of the active compound. Thus, ampoules for injections may contain, for example, from 1 mg to 100 mg, and single-dose formulations which can be administered orally, such as, for example, capsules or tablets, may contain, for example, from 0.05 to 1000 mg, typically from 0.5 to 600 mg. For the therapy of the abovementioned conditions, the compounds of formula I may be used as the compound itself, but they are preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition with an acceptable carrier. The carrier must, of course, be acceptable in the sense that it is compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and is not harmful for the patient's health. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid or both and is preferably formulated with the compound as a single dose, for example as a tablet, which may contain from 0.05% to 95% by weight of the active compound. Other pharmaceutically active substances may likewise be present, including other compounds of formula I. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be produced by one of the known pharmaceutical methods, which essentially consist of mixing the ingredients with pharmacologically acceptable carriers and/or excipients.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, peroral (for example sublingual) and parenteral (for example subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal or intravenous) administration, although the most suitable mode of administration depends in each individual case on the nature and severity of the condition to be treated and on the nature of the compound of formula I used in each case. Coated formulations and coated slow-release formulations also belong within the scope of the invention. Preference is given to acid- and gastric juice-resistant formulations. Suitable coatings resistant to gastric juice comprise cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate and anionic polymers of methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate.<br><br>
Suitable pharmaceutical preparations for oral administration may be in the form of separate units such as, for example, capsules, wafers, suckable tablets or tablets, each of which contain a defined amount of the compound of formula I; as powders or granules, as solution or suspension in an aqueous or nonaqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. These compositions may, as already mentioned, be prepared by any suitable pharmaceutical method which includes a step in which the active compound and the carrier (which may consist of one or more additional ingredients) are brought into contact. The compositions are generally produced by uniform and homogeneous mixing of the active compound with a liquid and/or finely divided solid carrier, after which the product is shaped if necessary. Thus, for example, a tablet can be produced by compressing or molding a powder or granules of the compound, where appropriate with one or more additional ingredients. Compressed tablets can be produced by tableting the compound in free-flowing form such as, for example, a powder or granules, where appropriate mixed with a binder, glidant, inert diluent and/or one or more surface-active/dispersing agent(s) in a suitable machine. Molded tablets can be produced by molding the compound which is in powder form and is moistened with an inert liquid diluent in a suitable machine.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for peroral (sublingual) administration comprise suckable tablets which contain a compound of formula I with a flavoring, normally sucrose and gum arabic or tragacanth, and pastilles which comprise the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerol or sucrose and gum arabic.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions suitable for parenteral administration comprise preferably sterile aqueous preparations of a compound of formula I, which are preferably isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. These preparations are preferably administered intravenously, although administration may also take place by subcutaneous, intramuscular or intradermal injection. These preparations can preferably be produced by mixing the compound with water and making the resulting solution sterile and isotonic with blood. Injectable compositions of the invention generally contain from 0.1 to 5% by weight of the active compound.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for rectal administration are preferably in the form of single-dose suppositories. These can be produced by mixing a compound of formula I with one or more conventional solid carriers, for example cocoa butter, and shaping the resulting mixture.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for topical use on the skin are preferably in the form of an ointment, cream, lotion, paste, spray, aerosol or oil. Carriers which can be used are petrolatum, lanolin, polyethylene glycols, alcohols and combinations of two or more of these substances. The active compound is generally present in a concentration of from 0.1 to 15% by weight of the composition, for example from 0.5 to 2%.<br>
Transdermal administration is also possible. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for transdermal uses can be in the form of single plasters which are suitable for long-term close contact with the patient's epidermis. Such plasters suitably contain the active compound in an aqueous solution which is buffered where appropriate, dissolved and/or dispersed in an adhesive or dispersed in a polymer. A suitable active compound concentration is about 1% to 35%, preferably about 3% to 15%. A particular possibility is for the active compound to be released by electrotransport or iontophoresis as described, for example, in Pharmaceutical Research, 2(6): 318 (1986).<br>
The compounds of the formula I act favorably on metabolic disorders. They have a positive effect on lipid and sugar metabolism and, in particular, reduce the concentration of triglycerides, and they are suitable for preventing and treating type II diabetes and arteriosclerosis and their various sequelae.<br>
Combinations with other medicaments<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered alone or in combination with one or more further pharmacologically active substances which, for example, act favorably on metabolic disorders or diseases frequently associated therewith. Such medicaments are, for example,<br><br>
1.	medicaments which lower blood glucose, antidiabetics,<br>
2.	active compounds for the treatment of dyslipidemias,<br>
3.	antiatherosclerotic medicaments,<br>
4.	antiobesity agents,<br>
5.	antiinflammatory active compounds<br>
6.	active compounds for the treatment of malignant tumors<br>
7.	antithrombotic active compounds<br>
8.	active compounds for the treatment of high blood pressure<br>
9.	active compounds for the treatment of heart failure and<br>
10.	active compounds for the treatment and/or prevention of complications caused by diabetes or associated with diabetes.<br>
They may be combined with the compounds of the formula I according to the invention in particular for synergistic improvement of the effect. Administration of the active compound combination may take place either by separate administration of the active compounds to the patients or in the form of combination products in which a plurality of active compounds are present in one pharmaceutical preparation.<br>

Determination of EC50 values of PPAR agonists in the cellular PPARalpha test<br>
Principle<br>
The potency of substances which bind to human PPARalpha and activate it in an agonistic manner is analyzed using a stably transfected HEK cell line (HEK= human embryo kidney) which is referred to here as PPARalpha reporter cell line. It contains two genetic elements, a luciferase reporter element (pdeltaM-GAL4-Luc-Zeo) and a PPARalpha fusion protein (GR-GAL4-humanPPARalpha-LBD) which mediates expression of the luciferase reporter element depending on a PPARalpha ligand. The stably and constitutively expressed fusion protein GR-GAL4-humanPPARalpha-LBD binds in the cell nucleus of the PPARalpha reporter cell line via the GAL4 protein portion to the GAL4 DNA binding motif 5'-upstream of the luciferase reporter element which is integrated in the genome of the cell line. There is only little expression of the luciferase reporter gene without addition of a PPARalpha ligand if fatty acid-depleted fetal calf serum (cs-FCS) is used in the test. PPARalpha ligands bind and activate the PPARalpha fusion protein and thereby bring about expression of the luciferase reporter gene. The luciferase which is formed can be detected by means of chemiluminescence via an appropriate substrate.<br><br>
Construction of the cell line<br>
The PPARalpha reporter cell line was prepared in 2 stages. Firstly, the luciferase reporter element was constructed and stably transfected into HEK cells. For this purpose, five binding sites of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (in each case 5'-CGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGAG-3') were cloned in 5'-upstream of a 68 bp-long minimal MMTV promoter (Accession #V01175), The minimal MMTV promoter section contains a CCAAT box and a TATA element in order to enable efficient transcription by RNA polymerase II. The cloning and sequencing of the GAL4-MMTV construct took place in analogy to the description of Sambrook J. et. al. (Molecular cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989). Then the complete Photinus pyralis luciferase gene (Accession # M15077) was cloned in 3'-downstream of the GAL4-MMTV element. After sequencing, the luciferase reporter element consisting of five GAL4 binding sites, MMTV promoter and luciferase gene was recloned into a plasmid which confers zeozin resistance in order to obtain the plasmid pdeltaM-GAL4-Luc-Zeo. This vector was transfected into HEK cells in accordance with the statements in Ausubel, F.M. et al. (Current protocols in molecular biology, Vol. 1-3, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1995). Then zeozin-containing medium (0.5 mg/ml) was used to select a suitable stable cell clone which showed very low basal expression of the luciferase gene. In a second step, the PPARalpha fusion protein (GR-GAL4»humanPPARalpha-LBD) was introduced into the stable cell clone described. For this purpose, initially the cDNA coding for the N-terminal 76 amino acids of the glucocorticoid receptor (Accession # P04150) was linked to the cDNA section coding for amino acids 1-147 of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (Accession # P04386). The cDNA of the ligand-binding domain of the human PPARalpha receptor (amino acids S167-Y468; Accession #S74349) was cloned in at the 3' end of this GR-GAL4 construct. The fusion construct prepared in this way (GR-GAL4-humanPPARalpha-LBD) was recloned into the plasmid pcDNA3 (from Invitrogen) in order to enable constitutive expression therein by the cytomegalovirus promoter. This plasmid was linearized with a restriction endonuclease and stably transfected into the previously described cell clone containing the luciferase reporter element. The finished PPARalpha reporter cell line which contains a luciferase reporter element and constitutively expresses the PPARalpha fusion protein (GR-GAL4-human PPARalpha-LBD) was isolated by selection with zeozin (0.5 mg/ml) and G418 (0.5 mg/ml).<br>
Test procedure<br><br>
The activity of PPARalpha agonists is determined in a 3-day test, described below:<br>
Day 1<br>
The PPARalpha reporter cell line is cultivated up to 80% confluence in DMEM (#41965-039, Invitrogen) with the following additives: 10% cs-FCS (fetal calf serum, #SH-30068.03, Hyclone), 0.5 mg/ml of zeozin (#R250-01, Invitrogen), 0.5 mg/ml of G418 (#10131-027, Invitrogen), 1% penicillin streptomycin solution (#15140-122, Invitrogen) and 2mM of L-glutamine (#25030-024, Invitrogen). Cultivation is carried out in standard cell culture bottles (# 353112, Becton Dickinson) in a cell culture incubator at 37°C in the presence of 5% C02. The 80% confluent cells are washed once with 15 ml of PBS (#14190-094, Invitrogen), treated with 3 ml of trypsin solution (#25300-054, Invitrogen) at 37°C for 2 min, taken up in 5 ml of the DMEM medium described and counted in a cell counter. After dilution to 500 000 cells/ml, in each case 35 000 cells are sown into each well of a 96-well microtiter plate having a clear plastic bottom (#3610, Corning Costar). The plates are incubated in a cell incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 h.<br>
Day 2<br>
The PPARalpha agonists to be tested are dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM. This stock solution is diluted in DMEM (#41965-039, Invitrogen) to which 5% of cs-FCS (#SH-30068.03, Hyclone), 2 mM of L-glutamine (#25030-024, Invitrogen) and the antibiotics already described (zeozin, G418, penicillin and streptomycin) are added.<br>
Test substances are tested at 11 different concentrations in the range of from 10 nM to 100 pM. More potent compounds are tested in concentration ranges of from 1 pM to 10 pM or between 100 nM and 1 pM.<br>
The medium of the PPARalpha reporter cell line sown on day 1 is completely removed by aspiration, and, immediately, the test substances diluted in medium are added to the cells. Dilution and addition of the substances are carried out using a robot (Beckman FX). The end volume of the test substances diluted in medium is 100 pi per well of a 96-well microtiter plate. The DMSO concentration in the test is below 0.1 % v/v to prevent cytotoxic effects of the solvent. To demonstrate that the test is working in each individual plate, a standard PPARalpha agonist, which is also diluted to 11  different concentrations, was<br><br>
To demonstrate that the test is working in each individual plate, a standard PPARalpha agonist, which is also diluted to 11 different concentrations, was added to each plate. The test plates are incubated in an incubator at 37°C and 5% C02for24h.<br>
Day 3<br>
The PPARalpha receptor cells treated with the test substances are removed from the incubator and the medium is aspirated off. The cells are lyzed by pipetting 50 IJ\ of Bright Glo reagent (from Promega) into each well of a 96-well microtiter plate. After incubation at room temperature in the dark for 10 minutes, the microtiter plates are measured in the luminometer (Trilux from Wallac). The measuring time for each well of a microtiter plate is 1 sec.<br>
Evaluation<br>
The crude data of the luminometer are exported into a Microsoft Excel file. Dose-activity curves and EC50 values of PPAR agonists are calculated using the program XL.Fit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (IDBS).<br>
The PPARalpha EC50 values for the compounds of examples 1 to 15 in this assay are in the range from 0.04 nM to &gt; 10 jaM.<br>
The results for the activity of some compounds of the formula I according to the invention are listed in table I below:<br><br><br><br>
It is evident from table I that the compounds of the formula i according to the invention activate the PPARalpha receptor, thus effecting, for example, analogously to clinically used fibrates, a lowering of the triglyceride concentration in the organism (see, for example, J.-Ch. Fruchard et al.: PPARS, Metabolic Disease and Atherosclerosis, Pharmacological Research, Vol. 44, No. 5, 345-52, 2001; S. Kersten et al.: Roles of PPARs in health and disease, NATURE, VOL 405, 25 MAY 2000, 421-4; I. Pineda et al.: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors: from transcriptional control to clinical practice, Curr Opin Lipidol 12: 2001,245-254).<br>
Determination of EC50 values of PPAR agonists in the cellular PPARgamma test<br>
Principle<br>
A transient transfection system is employed to determine the cellular PPARgamma activity of PPAR agonists. It is based on the use of a luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3basic-5xGAL4-TK) and of a PPARgamma expression plasmid (pcDNA3-GAL4-humanPPARgammaLBD). Both plasmids are transiently transfected into human embryonic kidney cells (HEK cells). There is then expression in these cells of the fusion protein GAL4-humanPPARgammaLBD which binds to the GAL4 binding sites of the reporter plasmid. In the presence of a PPARgamma-active ligand, the activated fusion protein GAL4-humanPPARgammaLBD induces expression of the luciferase reporter gene, which can be detected in the form of a chemiluminescence signal after addition of a luciferase substrate. As a difference<br><br>
from the stably transfected PPARalpha reporter cell line, in the cellular PPARgamma test the two components (luciferase reporter plasmid and PPARgamma expression plasmid) are transiently transfected into HEK cells because stable and permanent expression of the PPARgamma fusion protein is cytotoxic.<br>
Construction of the plasmids<br>
The luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3basic-5xGAL4-TK is based on the vector pGL3basic from Promega. The reporter piasmid is prepared by cloning five binding sites of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (each binding site with the sequence 5'-CTCGGAGGACAGTACTCCG-3'), together with a 160 bp-long thymidine kinase promoter section (Accession # AF027128) 5'-upstream into pGL3basic. 3'-downstream of the thymidine kinase promoter is the complete luciferase gene from Photinus pyralis (Accession # M15077) which is already a constituent of the plasmid pGL3basic used. The cloning and sequencing of the reporter plasmid pGL3basic-5xGAL4-TK took place in analogy to the description in Sambrook J. et. al. (Molecular cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989). The PPARgamma expression plasmid pcDNA3-GAL4-humanPPARgammaLBD was prepared by first cloning the cDNA coding for amino acids 1-147 of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (Accession # P04386) into the plasmid pcDNA3 (from Invitrogen) 3'-downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Subsequently, the cDNA of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the human PPARgamma receptor (amino acids I152-Y475; Accession # g1480099) was cloned 3'-downstream of the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Cloning and sequencing of the PPARgamma expression plasmid pcDNA3-GAL4-humanPPARgammaLBD again took place in analogy to the description in Sambrook J. et. al. (Molecular cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989). Besides the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3basic-5xGAL4-TK and the PPARgamma expression plasmid pcDNA3-GAL4-humanPPARgammaLBD, also used for the cellular PPARgamma test are the reference plasmid pRL-CMV (from Promega) and the plasmid pBluescript-SK(+) from Stratagene. All four plasmids were prepared using a plasmid preparation kit from Qiagen, which ensures a plasmid quality with a minimal endotoxin content, before transfection into HEK cells.<br><br>
Test procedure<br>
The activity of PPARgamma agonists is determined in a 4-day test which is described below. Before the transfection, HEK cells are cultivated in DMEM (#41965-039, Invitrogen) which is mixed with the following additions: 10% FCS (#16000-044, Invitrogen), 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (#15140-122, Invitrogen) and 2 mM L-glutamine (#25030-024, Invitrogen).<br>
Day 1<br>
Firstly, solution A, a transfection mixture which contains all four plasmids previously described in addition to DMEM, is prepared. The following amounts are used to make up 3 ml of solution A for each 96-well microtiter plate for one test: 2622 |jl of antibiotic- and serum-free DMEM (# 41965-039, Invitrogen), 100 pi of reference plasmid pRL-CMV (1 ng/pl), 100 pi of luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3basic-5xGAL4-TK (10 ng/pl), 100 pi of PPARgamma expression plasmid pcDNA3-GAL4-humanPPARgammaLBD (100 ng/pl) and 78 pi of plasmid pBluescript-SK(+) (500 ng/pl). Then 2 ml of solution B are prepared by mixing 1.9 ml of DMEM-(# 41965-039, Invitrogen) with 100 pi of PolyFect transfection reagent (from Qiagen) for each 96-well microtiter plate. Subsequently, 3 ml of solution A are mixed with 2 ml of solution B to give 5 ml of solution C, which is thoroughly mixed by multiple pipetting and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. 80%-confluent HEK cells from a cell culture bottle with a capacity of 175 cm2 are washed once with 15 ml of PBS (#14190-094, Invitrogen) and treated with 3 ml of trypsin solution (#25300-054, Invitrogen) at 37°C for 2 min. The cells are then taken up in 15 ml of DMEM (#41965-039, Invitrogen) which is mixed with 10% FCS (# 16000-044, Invitrogen), 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (#15140-122, Invitrogen) and 2 mM L-glutamine (#25030-024, Invitrogen). After the cell suspension has been counted in a cell counter, the suspension is diluted to 250 000 cells/ml. 15 ml of this cell suspension are mixed with 5 ml of solution C for one microtiter plate. 200 pi of the suspension are seeded in each well of a 96-well microtiter plate with a clear plastic base (#3610, Corning Costar). The plates are incubated in a cell culture incubator at 37°C and 5% C02 for 24 h.<br><br>
Day 2<br>
PPAR agonists to be tested are dissolved in DMSO in a concentration of 10 mM.<br>
This stock solution is diluted in DMEM (# 41965-039, Invitrogen) which is mixed with 2% Ultroser (#12039-012, Biosepra), 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (#15140-122, Invitrogen) and 2 mM L-glutamine (#25030-024, Invitrogen). Test substances are tested in a total of 11 different concentrations in the range from 10 |JM to 100 pM. More potent compounds are tested in concentration ranges from 1 ptol0pM.<br>
The medium of the HEK cells transfected and seeded on day 1 is completely removed by aspiration, and the test substances diluted in medium are immediately added to the cells. The dilution and addition of the substances is carried out by a robot (Beckman FX). The final volume of the test substances diluted in medium is 100 pi per well of a 96-well microtiter plate. Each plate is charged with a standard PPARgamma agonist, which is likewise diluted in 11 different concentrations, in order to demonstrate the functioning of the test in each individual plate. The test plates are incubated in an incubator at 37°C and 5% C02for 48 h.<br>
Day 4<br>
After removal of the medium by aspiration, 50 \i\ of Dual-Glo™ reagent (Dual-<br>
Glo™ Luciferase Assay System; Promega) are added to each well in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions in order to lyze the cells and provide the substrate for the firefly luciferase (Photinus pyralis) formed in the cells. After incubation at room temperature in the dark for 10 minutes, the firefly luciferase-mediated chemiluminescence is measured in a measuring instrument (measuring time/well 1 sec; Trilux from Wallac). Then 50 pi of the Dual-Glo™ Stop &amp; Glo reagent (Dual-Glo™ Luciferase Assay System; Promega) is added to each well in order to stop the activity of the firefly luciferase and provide the substrate for the Renilla luciferase expressed by the reference plasmid pRL-CMV. After incubation at room temperature in the dark for a further 10 minutes, the chemiluminescence mediated by the Renilla luciferase is again measured for 1 sec/well in the measuring instrument.<br>
Evaluation<br><br>
The crude data from the luminometer are transferred into a Microsoft Excel file.<br>
The firefly/Renilla luciferase activity ratio is determined for each measurement<br>
derived from one well of the microtiter plate. The dose-activity curves and EC50<br>
values of PPAR agonists are calculated from the ratios by the XL.Fit program as<br>
specified by the manufacturer (IDBS).<br>
PPARgamma EC50 values in the range from 160 nM  to &gt;10 //M were measured<br>
using the PPAR agonists described in this application.<br>
