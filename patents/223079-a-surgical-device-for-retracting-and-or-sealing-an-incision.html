				<td>A SURGICAL DEVICE FOR RETRACTING AND/OR SEALING AN INCISION<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a surgical device. More specifically, the invention<br>
relates to devices for retraction of an incision or natural bodily opening during<br>
surgery and for protecting the edges of incisions from infection or tumour seeding<br>
during surgery.<br>
Wound Retraction<br>
Adequate anatomical exposure is required in modern surgical procedures to allow<br>
procedures to be safely and effectively performed. Anatomical exposure is<br>
achieved by separating the walls of a natural orifice or spreading apart the margins<br>
of a surgical incision. A difficult surgical procedure can be simplified by adequate<br>
retraction whereas a relatively simple procedure can be made more difficult or<br>
even dangerous by the lack of adequate retraction. Exposure is maximised with<br>
correct incision placement and well directed retraction.<br>
Retraction can be achieved in several different ways. The most common method<br>
of surgical wound retraction is by the use of hand held retractors. These may be<br>
made of metal or thermoplastics and allow an operator to apply a retraction force<br>
to the wound edges. They are disposable or reusable and come in a variety of<br>
shapes and sizes to satisfy the requirements of different surgical procedures.<br>
Another type of retractor are Frame mounted retractor devices are also known.<br>
Such devices consist of a rigid circular or horseshoe-shaped frame on which<br>
multiple, detachable and movable paddle retractors are attached. The device may<br>
be mounted to an operating table to provide secure anchorage. Retraction may be<br>
applied in required directions. Typically such retractors are made of stainless steel<br>
to facilitate cleaning and sterilisation for reuse. Some of the more complex<br>
retractors need to be taken apart before sterilisation and reassembled before use.<br>
These devices always apply retraction at a fewspecific locations on the. wound.<br>
This is a disadvantage of such devices as it can lead to regional ischaemia on parts<br>
the wound edge.<br>
A wound retractor.and protector is disclosed in US-A-5524644 (Crook). This<br>
device consists of an open-ended sleeve of polymeric material with a flexible ring<br>
at each end. One ring is inserted into the incision and the sleeve is manually<br>
rolled up around the other ring to apply tension to the polymeric material to<br>
achieve retraction. The device is often difficult to use because of the manual<br>
dexterity required, especially when the surgeons hands are wet. In addition, the<br>
device is incrementally adjustable. This restricts the efficiency of the device across<br>
all abdominal wall thicknesses.<br>
US-A-5545179 (Williamson IV) describes a device having an elastomeric sealing<br>
element and a tubing conduit. The device protects the edges of the wound from<br>
contamination. However, the device is specifically for laparoscopic instruments<br>
and is not suitable for hand assisted surgery because the wound opening is not<br>
sufficiently retracted.<br>
WO-A-96/36283 (Mollenauer) describes a trocar device for retracting and sealing<br>
an incision and providing a sealed access port for surgical instruments. Whilst<br>
mis incision and providing a sealed access port for surgical instruments. Whilst<br>
this device provides bom retraction and protection to the wound edge is not<br>
suitable for use in hand assisted surgery due to size limitations. The device<br>
retarcts and protects due to the inflation of one or one or more balloons and<br>
because these dose the lumen when inflated it is not possible to visulaise the<br>
contents of the abdomen through the device.<br>
WO-A-98/48724 discloses a device for use in hand assisted laparoscopic surgery.<br>
The device has a wound retractor/protector component and a component for<br>
sealing around the wrist of the surgeon. The wound protector component<br>
consists of an inner ring and two outer inflatable doughnut-shaped rings mounted<br>
vertically on top of another. The inner and outer rings are linked by an<br>
elastomeric sleeve. Inflation of the two outer rings causes retraction of the<br>
elastomeric sleeve. This device provides wound retraction and protection but it is<br>
not suitable for device has a large vertical profile due to the outer rings. This<br>
restructs reach into the incision and extends the fulcrum of any instruments used<br>
in such a way that their effective reach and breath of lateral movement would be<br>
severely restricted.<br>
"Wound Protection<br>
The sides of an open wound are susceptible to infection and cross contamination<br>
if they are touched by contaminated material such as body parts or fluids as they<br>
pass through the opening of a wound. Serious problems can also result from<br>
cancerous material coming into contact with the wound edge. It is well known<br>
that cancerous cells may become seeded in wound areas, especially at trocar<br>
sites.<br>
To avoid such problems great care is taken to protect the edges of an incision<br>
using drapes that are impervious to liquids. An incision liner is disclosed in US<br>
3397692 (Creager). This linear comprises a sheet of polymeric material. The sheet<br>
has a hole cut out in the centre and the edges of the hole are reinforced using a<br>
semi-rigid ring. This ring can be inserted into the incision allowing a surgical<br>
procedure to proceed through the ring while the material attached to the ring<br>
protects the edges of the incision from contaminants in the wound site. These<br>
device marketed as "Steridrape" by 3M Corporation and comes in a variety of<br>
sizes for different wound sizes. However such devices do not adequately retract<br>
an incision.<br>
In general known devices are of either complex construction, do not effectively seal<br>
a wound and are difficult to operate, or are difficult to operate<br>
There is therefore a need for an improved surgical device that will overcome at least<br>
some of these problems.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Referring to the drawings and initially to Fig. 1 to 7 thereof there is illustrated a<br>
surgical device, especially for use in laproscopic surgery. The device 1 in this case<br>
is used in surgery involving an incision 2 in a wall 3 of a patients abdomen. The<br>
wound is, in this case, both protected and retracted by the device 1 of the<br>
invention. Thus, the invention in this case provides a wound protector retractor.<br>
The device 1 comprises an inner mounting means in the form of an O-ring 10 of<br>
flexible material such as of elastomeric material for insertion through the wound<br>
opening 2, an outer mounting means for mounting external of the wound opening<br>
2 and a connecting means, in this case in the form of a sleeve 11 extending<br>
between the inner 10 and outer mounting means. The outer mounting means is<br>
movable, in this case rotatable, relative to the inner O-ring 10 to twist the sleeve<br>
11 to form a centralised lumen 12 of reduced cross section and to shorten the axial<br>
extent of the sleeve 11. As the sleeve 11 is twisted the inner O-ring 10 is drawn<br>
upwardly from the inserted position illustrated in Fig. 3 to the in-use position<br>
illustrated in Fig. 4 in which the wound is sealed and a radial retraction force is<br>
applied to the wound. A surgeon inserts a sealed gloved hand/arm/instrument<br>
through the sealed and retracted wound to perform a surgical procedure within<br>
the abdomen.<br>
In this preferred case the outer mounting means comprises a first outer mounting<br>
means in the form of a first annular ring 20 and a second outer mounting means in<br>
the form of a second annular ring 21. The sleeve 11 is of biocompatible pliable<br>
gas impermeable plastics material and is attached at one end to the ring 20 and at<br>
an opposite end to the ring 21. The sleeve 11 is connected to the ring 20, led over<br>
the O-ring 10 and back up for attachment to the ring 21 as best illustrated in Fig.<br>
2.<br>
In use, a surgeon makes an incision in the abdominal cavity and the O-ring 10 is<br>
flexed and inserted through the incision as illustrated in Fig. 3. The outer rings<br>
20,21 are then rotated relative to one anodier in the direction of the arrows A and<br>
B in Fig. 3. This relative rotation twists the sleeve 11 and shortens the sleeve until<br>
the device is in the operative position of Fig. 4. In this position the inner O-ring<br>
10 is engaged against the inside of the interior of the anterior abdominal wall and<br>
the rings 21 and 22 are external of the wound opening with the sleeve 11 shortened<br>
in axial extent. The twisting of the sleeve 11 provides a central lumen 12 of reduced<br>
size, which depends on the degree of twist. A full 180° relative twist would result in<br>
closing down of the lumen. The reduced lumen 12 provides access for instruments<br>
and a surgeon's arm or a surgeon's arm while maintaining a wound seal.<br>
Locking means of any suitable type may be provided to lock the rings 20, 21<br>
together. The locking means may, for example comprise a releasable latching<br>
system such as a ratchet and pawl arrangement or the like.<br>
Preferably a gas tight seal is formed between the rings 20, 21 in use. The sleeve in<br>
this case provides an inflatable space 30 between the rings 20, 21 and the inner O-<br>
ring10. An inflation connection port may be provided in the device to facilitate<br>
inflation. On inflation, a wound engaging section 11a of the sleeve is pushed<br>
radially outwardly to provide a highly efficient wound protector/seal and wound<br>
retractor. The inner sleeve section 11b is inflated to further restrict the lumen 12<br>
and provide highly efficient sealing engagement with a surgeons forearm, a device<br>
or an instruments inserted through the lumen.<br>
For efficient sealing engagement it is preferred that the inner diameter (d) of the<br>
sleeve 11 is greater than or equal to the axial length (1) of the sleeve 11 as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 7. Preferably the inner diameter of the sleeve is greater than the<br>
axial length of the sleeve by an amount which is less than the thickness of an<br>
average abdominal wall. With this configuration on twisting of the sleeve 11,<br>
sealing and retraction forces are applied to the wound opening.<br>
The surgical device 1 may be formed from a cylindrical sleeve 50 of pliable plastic<br>
material attached to a pair of rings 20, 21 as illustrated in Figs 6 and 7. A flexible<br>
O-ring 10 is fitted over the sleeve 50. The flexible sleeve 50 is then turned over on<br>
itself so that the O-ring 10 is confined between inner and outer sleeve sections 1 la,<br>
11b and the rings 20, 21 are in the configuration illustrated in Figs 1 and 2.<br>
The device of the invention applies a force to the wound edges to achieve<br>
adequate exposure without causing ischaemic injury to the wound edges. The<br>
device protects wound edges from cross infection or seeding by cancerous or<br>
otherwise malignant cells. Another advantage is that the device is sufficiently<br>
inexpensive that it can be disposed of after a single use thereby obviating the need<br>
for cleaning and sterilisation between use. In addition, the device is simple to<br>
place into a desired position in a wound or natural bodily opening and easy to<br>
remove, especially without negating the benefits gained from use of the device as a<br>
wound protector.<br>
Referring to Figs 8 to 10 there is illustrated another surgical device 60 according to<br>
the invention. The device 60 is similar to the device 1 and like parts are assigned<br>
the same reference numerals. In this case the sleeve 61 is a single wall sleeve and<br>
there is only one outer mounting ring 62. On rotation of the outer ring 62 relative<br>
to the inner ring 10 a twist is formed in the sleeve which is shortened, drawing the<br>
inner ring 10 upwardly against the interior of the anterior abdominal wall as<br>
illustrated in Figs. 9 and 10.<br>
It will be appreciated that the inner O-ring may be fixed, for example, by<br>
adhesives to the sleeve of the surgical device. It will also be appreciated that one<br>
or more of the mounting means may be shaped to positively engage with tissue.<br>
For example, the mounting means may include tissue-engaging projections to lock<br>
the mounting means in position.<br>
It will be appreciated that while for efficient retraction and wound protection it is<br>
preferred that the connecting means between the outer and inner mounting means<br>
is in the form of a sleeve of pliable material, the connecting means may be<br>
discontinuous. For example the sleeve may be in the form of elongate strips or<br>
the like.<br>
Referring to Figs 11 to 13 there is illustrated another surgical device 70 according<br>
to the invention. In this case the connecting means comprises a plurality of straps<br>
71 which are drawn upwardly to shorten the axial extent and to form a wound<br>
retractor. The straps 71 are retained in the shortened configuration illustrated by<br>
any suitable locking means such as by wedge elements 72. In mis case an iris<br>
diaphragm type device 80 is provided in the wound opening which is inflatable<br>
from the rest configuration illustrated in Fig. 11 to the pressurised inflated<br>
configuration illustrated in Fig. 12.<br>
Referring to Figs 14 to 16 there is illustrated another device 85 according to the<br>
invention in which the connecting means is defined by a plurality of straps 86<br>
which are movable between an inner mounting ring 83 and an outer mounting<br>
ring 84 by buckle devices 87 from the initial position illustrated in Fig 15B to the<br>
wound retracting position of Fig. 15 A. The inner ring 83 is first inserted though<br>
the incision. The outer ring 82 is men brought down to skin level by taking up the<br>
slack in the straps 86. To achieve the retraction effect the straps 86 are pulled taut<br>
causing the wound edge to be displaced put from the centrepoint of the wound.<br>
The straps 86 may be adjusted until optimum retraction is achieved. Tension in<br>
the straps 86 is maintained by the buckles 86 which may hold the strap 86 taut<br>
either by friction or using a clasp mechanism.<br>
Referring to Figs 17 and 18 another surgical device 90 similar to the device 85 is<br>
illustrated. In this case the inner and outer mounting rings 82, 83 are of oval<br>
shape in transverse cross section to smooth the movement of the straps 86. This<br>
device operates in a similar manner to the device 85.<br>
Referring to Figs 19 and 20 there is illustrated another surgical device 93 which<br>
has single legged straps 94. This device operates in a similar manner to devices 85<br>
and device 90. In this case straps 94 do not loop around the inner ring 83 but are<br>
directly attached to it.<br>
Referring to Fig. 21 there is illustrated a further surgical device 95 having straps 96<br>
which are locked in position by a locking mechainism. The locking mechanism<br>
comprises a wedge 97 inserted into a hole through which the strop 96 passes to<br>
hold the strap 96 in position by friction. A ratchet mechanism may also be used<br>
or some other adjustable locking mechanism to hold the strap in position.<br>
The device 98 illustrated in Figs. 22 and 23 is similar to the device of Fig. 21<br>
except that a different construction of wedge or ratchet 99 is used to lock the<br>
straps in position.<br>
Referring to Figs 24 to 26 there is illustrated another surgical device according to<br>
the invention. In this case the surgical device is a wound protector retractor 200<br>
