				<td>Benzenesuiphonamide derivatives, method for production and<br>
use thereof for treatment of pain<br><br>
The present invention relates to novel benzenesulphonamide compounds, their method of preparation and pharmaceutical composition comprising these compounds;<br><br>
These novel compounds are useful for treatment of pain.<br><br><br><br><br>
Prior art<br>
Compounds are already known whose structure includes a group of benzenesulphonamide type. For example, through EP 236 163 and EP 236 164, N-a-arylsulphonylaminoacyl-p-amidino-phenyl-alaninamide derivatives may be cited which are selective thrombin inhibitors and can be used as anti-thrombotics. Also, from EP 614 911, compounds are known having a fairly close structure to the preceding compounds, simultaneously containing an arylsulphamoyl group and a substituted phenylamidine group, which have the property of binding to receptors of the Y neuropeptide and can be used to treat hypertension, angina pectoris, atherosclerosis, depression, anxiety, inflammation, allergy or excess fat.<br>
EP 558 961 also suggests the use of arylsulphonamide-type compounds of substituted amino acids for the treatment of thrombosis on account of their anticoagulant properties.<br>
Studies on the anti-thrombotic properties of compounds containing an arylsulphonamide group in their structure and a phenylamidine group have also been published in Pharmazie 1984 vol. 39 (5) pages 315-317 and Pharmazie 1986 vol. 41(4) p 233-235.<br>
In the same field of pharmacological activity WO 92/16549 Al describes derivatives of phenylalanine comprising an arylsulphonamide group, which are proteinase inhibitors, in particular thrombin inhibitors.<br>
Also, according to WO 97/25315, compounds are known having N(arylsulphonyl)amino-acid structure, which can be used to treat inflammatory diseases.<br>
Among the prior art documents proposing structural elements of arylsulphonamide type, mention may be made of WO 96/40639, WO 97/24349, WO 98/03503, WO 98/24783 and WO 99/00387, pertaining to antagonist compounds of the B2 receptor of bradykinin. Antagonist compounds of the B1 receptor of bradykinin, whether peptide or nonpeptide, are also known through documents WO 01/05783, WO 02/099388 and WO 97/09346.<br><br>

EDCI	(1-(3-dimethylami nopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide),	DIC<br>
(diisopropylcarbodiimide) or HOAT (1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazOle), at a temperature generally lying between ambient temperature and the boiling point of the solvent, for approximately 2 to 15 hours, to obtain the amide of formula:<br><br>

(Formula Removed)<br><br>
c)	hydrolysing the ester of formula VI, for example through the action of trifluoroacetic acid, the reaction being conducted in a solvent such as dichloromethane, at a temperature lying between approximately 0 0C and 50 0C for approximately 1 to 6 hours, to obtain the acid of formula II:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
in which R1, R2, R3, P.4 and Ra remain unchanged and Y represents a<br>
-CH2-CH2-O-CH2- group.<br>

in which<br>
X represents CH or a nitrogen atom,<br>
p represents 2 or 3,<br><br>
A represents a single bond, a nitrogen atom optionally substituted with a methyl group (if X does not also represent a nitrogen atom), or a straight or branched C1-C5 alkylene group optionally hydroxylated or of which one of the carbon atoms is oxidized into a ketone function, B represents a nitrogen-containing heterocycle or an amine group optionally substituted with one or two C1-C4 alkyl groups, on the understanding that, should a non-substituted nitrogen atom be present, this nitrogen atom is protected by a different amino-protecting group to the amino-protecting group used for acid compound VII, such as a Boc group (1,1-dimethylethoxycarbonyl), in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or dichloromethane or dimethylformamide for example, in the presence of activators such as<br>
EDCI	(1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide),	DIC<br>
(diisopropylcarbodiimide) or HOAT (1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole) for example, at a temperature generally lying between ambient temperature and the boiling point of the solvent, for approximately 2 to 15 hours, to obtain the amide of formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which Za, Ra, Y, p, X, A and B maintain the same meaning as in the starting compounds,<br>
b)	removing the Za amino-protecting group, for example by catalytic hydrogenation if Za is a benzyl group, to obtain the secondary amine of formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which Ra, Y, p, X, A and B maintain the same meaning as in the preceding compound,<br>
c)	allowing this secondary amine IX to react with a benzenesulphonyl chloride of formula:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
in which R1, R2, R3 and R4 each independently represent a hydrogen or halogen atom, a C1-C3 alkyl group or a C1-C3 alkoxy group, CF3 or OCF3 group, in a solvent such as dichloromethane for example, in the presence of an aprotic organic base such as triethylamine or pyridine for example, at a temperature lying between approximately 0 and 50 0C, for approximately 1 to 3 hours, to obtain the sulphonamide of formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which R1, R2, R3, R4, Ra, Y, p, X, A and B maintain the same meaning as in the starting compounds,<br>
d)	if necessary, removing the amino-protecting groups, for example through the action of trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of anisole if said amino-protecting group is a Boc group,<br>
e)	if necessary, obtaining an addition salt of the formula I compound with a mineral or organic acid.<br>
As a variant of the above method, step a) to form the amide bond may be conducted by first forming the acid chloride of formula VII, for example through the action of oxalyl chloride or thionyl chloride in an anhydrous aprotic solvent, followed by reaction of the acid chloride obtained with the formula III amine as described above, in a solvent and for example in the presence of an aprotic base such as triethylamine.<br>
The heterocyclic derivatives of formula III are known compounds, commercially available or described in the literature, or may be prepared using methods known to persons skilled in the art, for example through a reductive amination reaction between piperazine or homopiperazine and a ketone, for example in the presence of titanium isopropoxide then a reaction with a reducing agent such as sodium cyanoborohydride, or, if piperidine derivatives are used, through catalytic hydrogenation of pyridine-homologous compounds.<br>
The invention will be more readily understood with the help of examples of preparation of compounds and the results of pharmacological tests demonstrating the therapeutic usefulness of these compounds. These examples are non-limiting and cannot be interpreted as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
Among the abbreviations used in the description, M means mole, mM means millimole (10~ mole). THE means tetrahydrofurane, DCM means dichloromethane, DMF means dimethylformamide, TFA means trifluoroacetic acid. For compounds having a centre of assymetry, the absence of any particular indication means that the compound is in the form of the racemic mixture. In the spectral data for nuclear magnetic<br><br>
resonance, chemical shifts are indicated with reference to TMS (tetramethylsilane).<br>
PREPARATION I<br>
N(2-hydroxyethyl)-4- methoxy- N, 2,6-trimethylbenzene-suiphonamide<br>
A solution of 1.76 g (23.4 mM) of 2-(methylamino)ethanol is prepared in 100 ml of DCM and 5.4 g (53 mM) of triethylamine are added. The mixture is cooled to 0 0C and a solution of 5 g (21.3 mM) of 2,6 dimethyl4-methoxybenzenesulphonyl chloride in 50 ml of DCM is added progressively. The mixture is then agitated for 3 hours at ambient temperature, and then poured over 50 ml of 0.5 N hydrochloric acid. The organic phase is separated and then washed with water, dried over magnesium sulphate and concentrated under reduced pressure. 5.8 g of the compound sought after are thus obtained as a colourless oil (yield = 100 0/a)<br><br>
'H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO) 8: 6.80 (s, 2H) ; 4.70 (t, 1H) ; 3.80 (5, 3H) ; 3.48 (q, 2H); 3.09 (t, 2H); 2.69 (s, 3H); 2.54 (s, 6H).<br><br>
PREPARATION II<br>
[2-([(4-methoxy-2,6-dimethylphenyl)sulphonyl]methylamino]-ethoxyjacetic acid, 1,1-dimethylethyl ester<br>
A solution of 4.85 g (17.7 mM) of the compound obtained according to preparation I is prepared in 100 ml of toluene and 1.62 g of tetrabutylammonium chloride are added. The mixture is cooled to 0 0C and 100 ml of 350/a sodium hydroxide are then added, then, progressively, 3.95 ml (26.6 mM) of t-butyl bromacetate are added. The mixture is agitated at ambient temperature for 2 hours and the organic phase is then separated by decanting, and washed with water to neutral pH and then dried over sodium sulphate. After concentration under reduced pressure, an oil is obtained which is purified by silica gel chromatography in eluting<br><br>
with the aid of a cyclohexane/ethyl acetate mixture (75/25; v/v). 6.5 g of the compound sought after are thus obtained as a colourless oil (yield =<br>
94 0/~~)<br><br>
'H NMR (250 MHz, DMSO) 8: 6.80 (s, 2H) ; 3.89 (s, 2H) ; 3.80 (s, 3H); 3.56 (t, 2H); 3.21 (t, 2H); 2.71 (s, 3H); 2.53 (s, 3H) ; 1.41 Cs, 9H).<br><br>
PREPARATION III<br>
[2-[[(4-methoxy-2,6-dimethylphenyl)sulphonyl]methylami no]ethoxyjacetic acid<br>
6.4 g (16.5 mM) of the ester obtained according to preparation II are dissolved in 80 ml of DCM, and 8 ml of trifluoroacetic acid are added. The mixture is agitated at ambient temperature for 4 hours, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue from evaporation is taken up into solution in 100 ml of iN sodium hydroxide and the solution obtained is washed twice with 30 ml of ethyl acetate, and then acidified with an N solution of hydrochloric acid and extracted with twice 80 ml of ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed with water, dried over sodium sulphate and concentrated under pressure. The acid sought after is thus obtained as an oil which crystallises (yield = 95 0/a).<br>

A solution is prepared of 7 g (21 mM) of acid obtained according to preparation III in 50 ml of chloroform and 0.1 ml of dimethylformamide and, at ambient temperature, a solution of 3.7 ml (42 mM) of oxalyl chloride in 8 ml of chloroform, is added dropwise. The reaction mixture is agitated for 3 hours at ambient temperature and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue from evaporation is taken up into 20 ml of chloroform and is added slowly, at 00C, to a solution of 4.04 g (22 mM) of 1-(1-methyl-4-piperidinyl)piperazine and 8.7 ml of triethylamine in 40 ml of chloroform. The reaction mixture is agitated for 1 hour at 00C and then<br>
poured over 60 ml of iced water. The mixture obtained is extracted with 100 ml of chloroform and the organic phase is washed with a solution of sodium bicarbonate, and then with water, dried over magnesium sulphate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The product sought after is thus obtained as an oil (yield = 81.70/a) which is used, without other purification, to obtain a salt with an acid.<br><br>

1-piperazinyl]-2-oxoethoxy]ethyl]benzenesulphonamide, dihydrochioride<br>
A solution is prepared of 6 g (12 mM) of the compound obtained according to Example 149 in 100 ml of ethanol heated to around 650C. 3.2 ml (36 mM) of concentrated hydrochloric acid are then added, at around 600C. A precipitate forms rapidly. After 2 hours under agitation at ambient temperature, the suspension is cooled to 00C and filtered on a sinter. The solid isolated is washed with 10 ml of cold ethanol and then with 15 ml of ethyl ether and dried under reduced pressure. 5.2 g of the salt sought after are thus obtained as a white solid (yield = 75 %).<br>

Biological activity<br>
The compounds of the present invention were evaluated for their analgesic property using the formalin-induced pain response test in mice (Shibata, M., Ohkubo, T., Takahashi, K. &amp; P.. Inoki. Modified formalin test:<br>
characteristic biphasic pain response. Pain, 38, 347-352). To summarize, formalin (0.92 0/a in physiological saline) is injected into the hind paw and the period of paw licking, which represents pain intensity, is recorded from 0 to 5 mm (1~ phase) and from 15 to 30 mm (2nd phase) after the injection. According to this test, the percentage inhibition of the second paw licking phase induced by formalin is 43% for the compound of example 4 administered via the oral route at a dose of 3 mg/kg and 40 0/~ for the compound of example 6 administered via the oral route at a dose of 1 mg/kg.<br>
These results demonstrate a substantial lowering of pain response after administering the compounds.<br>
Subsequent to the results of the preceding test, the compounds of the invention were subjected to a test intended to demonstrate their mode of action and involving the B, receptor of bradykinin.<br>
This test uses the human umbilical vein and is conducted as per the following protocol:<br>
Human umbilical cords 15-25 cm long are recovered just after delivery and are immediately placed in a flask containing a Krebs solution of composition (in mM): 119 NaCI 119, 4.7 KCI, 1.18 KK2PO4, 1.17 MgSO4, 25 NaKCO3, 2.5 CaCI2, 5.5 Glucose, 0.026 EDTA then stored at 40C.<br>
The cord is dissected in Krebs solution to release the umbilical vein. The vein is cleansed of all adhering tissue and cut into small rings 3-4 mm in width. The endothelium is carefully removed by inserting a fine n0 1 catheter, made slightly abrasive, into the vessel lumen.<br>
To induce expression of the B, receptor of bradykinin, the vein segments are allowed to incubate at 37GC in a 25 ml chamber for 16<br><br><br>
hours in an EMEM culture medium oxygenated by a 950/a 02 + 50/a CO2 mixture to which antibiotics are added: penicillin 10 000 lU/mi and streptomycin 10 000 lU/mI. The following day, the vein rings are mounted on a stainless steel support connected to an isometric sensor and placed in a 8 ml isolated organ bath chamber thermostated at 370C, containing the Krebs solution oxygenated by a 95% 02 + 5% CO2 mixture.<br>
After a rest period of one hour during which the rings are rinsed 5 to 6 times with the Krebs solution (maintained at 37GC throughout the entire handling procedure and oxygenated by a 950/a 02 + Sa/a CO2 mixture), the vein is gradually subjected to a ig load. When the load is stable, after approximately 45 minutes, the Krebs solution is replaced by a hyper-potassium solution (KPSS: at a temperature of 37GC) of the same composition but containing 125 mM KCI and not NaCI.<br>
After a series of rinsings, rests and load readjustments, the maximum contraction of each segment is determined by further depolarisation with the KPSS solution.<br>
After a new rest period during which the ig load is constantly readjusted, the following compounds are added to the isolated organ bath: Mepyramine (1 pM), Atropine (1 pM), Indometacine (3 pM), LNA (30 pM), Captopril (10 pM), DL-Thiorphan (1 pM) and Nifedipine (0.1 pM).<br>
After 20 minutes, the molecule to be tested or the molecule solvent is added to the isolated organ bath. The molecules are examined at 10 pM; should a molecule show a sufficient level of activity, it is examined at lower concentrations (eg: 1 — 0.1-0.01 pM).<br>
After 15 minutes incubation, the vein segments are contracted through the addition of increasing concentrations of des-ArglO-Kallidin (0.1 nM to 30 000 nM) in the chamber.<br>
The EC50 values (effective concentrations of agonists required to produce 5O0/a of the maximum response obtained with KPSS) are calculated using the least square method.<br><br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The pK8 = [-logK8] is obtained from the equation:<br>
KB = [A] / (concentration ratio-i)<br>
n which [A] is the concentration of antagonist and the (concentration ratio) represents the ratio between ECsa in the presence of an antagonist and EC50 in the absence of antagonist.<br>
According to this test, the compounds of the invention cited in the description show a PKB value of more than 7.<br>
By way of example, the pK8 values of some compounds of the invention are given in table II:<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be used to treat various forms of pain such as inflammatory hyperalgesia, allodynia, neuropathic pain assoicated with, for example, diabetes, with neuropathies (constriction of sciatica nerve, lumbago), with any form of trauma, surgery (tooth extraction, tonsil removal), interstitial cystitis, inflammatory colon disease, or with cancer.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be used to treat any pathology associated with neutrophil migration such as acute respiratory distress syndrome for example, or psoriasis, chronic lung obstructions, inflammatory diseases, in particular inflammatory diseases of the colon, rheumatoid polyarthritis.<br>
The activity of the compounds of the. invention, evidenced during the biological tests, is indicative of analgesic properties and permits their considered use for therapy.<br>
According to the invention, the use is advocated of compounds defined by formula I and of their salts with non-toxic acids, preferably their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, as active ingredients in medicinal products intended for the treatment of mammals, notably in man, suffering from pain or certain diseases generally characterized by massive neutrophil migration.<br>
Among the diseases which can be treated by administering a therapeutically efficient quantity of at least one of the formula I compounds, mention may be made of inflammatory hyperalgesia, neuropathic pain, pain assoicated with trauma or with cancer, inflammatory diseases of the colon, rheumatoid polyarthritis, psoriasis, chronic lung obstructions or acute respiratory distress syndrome.<br>
The invention also concerns a method for treating pain or the above-mentioned diseases which consists of administering a therapeutically efficient quantity of a formula I compound to patients in need thereof.<br>
The dose of active ingredient is dependent upon the mode of administration and type of pathology; it is generally between 0.05 and 10 mg/kg of the treated patient. In relation to the intended treatment, the formula I compounds or their salts may be associated with other active ingredients and are to be formulated with routinely used excipients.<br>
To obtain swift action, notably for the treatment of acute pain, the method of administration of the medicinal product is preferably by injection, for example via the intramuscular or the subcutaneous route. For chronic pain, the medicinal product may be administered in common galenic formulations, for example via the oral route in capsule or tablet form, in which a compound of the invention is associated with excipients known to persons skilled in the art, or in adhesive patch form in which a compound of the invention is formulated with excipients known to persons skilled in the art to promote transdermal passing of the active ingredient.<br><br>
The composition of present invention comprising at least one physiologically acceptable excipient, it contains at least one benzene surfonamide compound of Formula I or one of its pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts with an acid shows synergistic properties exhibiting surprising results.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
