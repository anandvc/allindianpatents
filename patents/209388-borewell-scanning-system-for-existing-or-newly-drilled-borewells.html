Background of invention: This invention relates to the scanning of existing or newly drilled borewells to study the fac-tors like which affects the performance of the borewell system ,like   formation of borewell, casing lenth, casing condition, seating condition of casing in the borewell, dry gaps, present water level water gaps, silt, obstruction due to holders and depth of borewell without installig motor and pump directly for testing purpose.<br>
so many experiments are conducted to carry out this invention successfully.<br>
Abstract:  The problem faced by the farmers to install the<br>
submersible pump and motor for a particular depth for perment<br>
source of water.   In a newly drilled invisble borewell, we cannot<br>
judge at what depth the water channels present and gives<br>
permanent source of water.<br>
Previously the farmers fix up the motor and pump<br>
approximately by trail and error for better results, it is a very time consuming task and even though borewell cannot work properly. To over come thease problems I directed to see the structure of earth crest directly by means of scanning technical.   Were we can see the entire structure and function of borewell.<br>
The scanning system for existing or newly dried borewell is very useful instrument to note details of borewell to confirm   whether the borewell works healthy or not without install<br><br>
king a motor and pump to the borewell directly for testing, the borewell scanning equipment mainly containg monitor, control unit, scanning unit.   The signal revived by the scanner with the help of illumination of lamp or bulb in the borewell is converted in to display signals on the monitor through cable and control unit, where we can see the invisible details of the borewell directly on the monitor, by confirming the condition of borewell suggested to install the pump and motor. The invention is successfully working, number of borewells are scanned so fonscanning equipment suitable to scan 4, 6,8, 10,12 inches bore wish receptivity.<br>
objective of invention: The borewell scanning system will aim at the following points.<br>
1.	To solve the scarcity due to nonavailablity of surface water and resources at deep level.<br>
2.	Borewell scanning system saves the cost of farmers and there by giving predetermined information to be invested on motor, pump, cable, power house and electric supply.   By knowing, the depth at where the sufficient water gaps avail-blew or not to install the motor and pump.<br>
3.	To avoid repetitive drilling of borewells and by repairing existing one after scanning.<br><br>
4.   The environment point if view practice of drilling new<br>
borewells affects fall of ground water and scarcity of water occurs. 5.The borewell scanning system useful to educate the farmers regarding existing borewell by forecasting useful data after scanning a borewell .<br>
6.	The bore well scanning system by forecasting useful data to educate the customer about underground water at that particular area or site and  direction of water flow in the bore well after scanning a newly drilled borewell,<br>
7.	The borewell scanning system monitors the design data to farmers at anytime without any modification , change or disturbance upon the existing system.<br>
Advantages of borewell scanning system: The system provide significance by forecasting useful data. The system can able to scan Invisible conditions of existing or newly drilled borewell.<br>
1.	Length of casing.<br>
2.	Condition of casing(In case of old borewells)<br>
3.	Seating condition of casing at rock surface after subsoil.<br>
4.	Formation of borewell.<br>
5.	To identify dry gaps (Empty layers of earth crest). 6.Present water level indicates water level at that area or zone<br><br>
7.	To identify water gaps or water channels.<br>
8.	To Identify the direction of flow of water in the borewell.<br><br>
9.	To identify silt (Loose formation in between rock surfaces).<br>
10.	To identify any obstruction in the borewell to install motor.<br>
11.	To identify bolders.<br>
12.	The borewell scanning system have proved economical   to<br>
the user by feeding information to select suitable submers Bible pump and motor to at what depth water channels evadible .number of stages and HP required . 13.The borewell scanning system can able to scan invisible conditions have proved better than geological survey report by saving sampling cost. 14 The borewell scaning system avoids sample collection and testing of earth density to erect pillers for multistoried building by scaning a single borewell at the particular site to what extent subsoil and hard rock availble. These are the some of the major advantages of the borewell scaning system.<br>
Principle of operation :- The visual signals are converted into display signals on the monitor in the borewell containing high hydrostatics pressure of water. The hydrostatic pressure of borewell is more compared to open wells. The pressure in the borewells increases with respect to depth of the borewell. The scaner  which is used to scan the borewell is designed to withstand hydrostatic pressure of water. As depth increases pressure also increases on scanner body. The 12 voltas bulb or lamp is used along with scaner to illuminate borehole surface; by allowing scanner and lamp together into theborewell<br><br>
through the cable graduated with foot marks and a cable is supported by a PVC string to avoid elongation of cable. Not-in the details of borewell on the monitor the image can be recorded to VHS cassata or to pc further reference.<br>
