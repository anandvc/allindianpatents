Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
A detailed description of the present invention is hereinafter given with reference to specific embodiments and the accompanying drawings.<br>
The embodiments of the present invention include: after a third party server which is not an IM service provider initiates a state request of an IM user to an IM server, the IM server returning a state of the IM user to the third party server.<br>
The system and method for providing the state of an IM user is hereinafter described with reference to Figure 2 in accordance with the embodiments of the present invention. Referring to Figure 2, the system provided by an embodiment of the present invention includes an IM server, an IM client and a third party server.<br>
The third party in the embodiments of the present invention is relative to the IM service provider and the IM user, i.e., the IM service provider is a first party and the IM user is a second party, and another service provider which is not the IM service provider is called a third party. The third party server includes a server of an authorized third party service provider (called an authorized third party server for short) and a server of an unauthorized third party service provider (called an unauthorized third party server for short). The authorized third party server is authorized by an IM system, while the unauthorized third party server is unauthorized by the IM system. The rights for providing<br><br>
a service for an IM client by the both third party servers are different.<br>
The authorized third party server may communicate with the IM server via a dedicated or public interface, while the unauthorized third party server communicates with the IM server only via a public interface. The protocol used in the dedicated interface is a protocol designated by both the authorized third party server and the IM server, while the protocol used in the public interface is a public protocol. If the third party server communicates with the IM server via the public interface, the IM server may identify the authorization state of the third party server by setting an interface parameter or by authorization information stored in the IM server.<br>
The IM client is the combination of a computer device and software with functions including displaying and setting a user state and executing instant messaging. The IM client sends to the IM server login information and setting information of the user of the IM client via a communication interface. The setting information includes richer states set by the user of the IM client, i.e., various states set by the user, which may be a state provided by the IM system or a state expressed in Chinese characters, for example "I am in Tianjin", "make an examination recently" or "don't trouble me".<br>
The IM server is the combination of a computer device and software for providing and managing an IM service and the state of an IM user. The IM server includes a memory for storing detailed states of an IM user and a corresponding management module, and also includes a memory for storing information and a relative protocol of the authorized or unauthorized third party service provider and a corresponding management module. The IM server has an interface and a corresponding program module for communicating with the above authorized or unauthorized third party server. As a result, the IM server may communicate with the third party server.<br>
The memory for storing the detailed states of an IM user is a relational database storing states of all IM users in practical applications. An example of the database is as shown in the following table.<br><br><br>
In the above table, the State is referred to a state provided by the IM system to the IM user, and the Rich States is referred to self-defining rich states of the IM user. The IM user may set the self-defining rich states in the IM system or a service platform of the third party server.<br>
In the above relational database, a Structured Query Language (SQL) is used as an interface program for managing database contents, which may update the database contents according to the setting information of the user of IM client.<br>
The method for providing the state of an IM user is hereinafter described with reference to Figure 2 and Figure 3 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The method provided by an embodiment of the present invention is based on the system described in Figure 2 and includes the following steps as shown in Figure 3.<br>
Step 301: Set an interface on an IM server and a third party server respectively in advance to communicate with each other. As the above mentioned, the interface for the IM server communicating with the authorized third party server is a dedicated or public interface while the interface for the IM server communicating with the unauthorized third party server is a public interface. If the IM server communicates with a third party server via the public interface, the IM server may identify the authorization state of the third party server by setting an interface parameter, for example adding an authorization identity in the interface parameter.<br>
Step 302: The IM client sends login information and login state setting information to the IM server when logging in the IM system. Generally, the IM user logs in the IM system with an online state; alternatively, the IM user may also log in the IM system with an invisible state. The IM server receives the login information or the login state setting information, and saves the state of the IM user in the relational database. After logging in the IM system, the IM user may set his/her state as online, invisible, leaving or offline. Whenever setting the state, the IM client sends new state information to the IM server. After receiving the new state information, the IM server saves the new state information in the relational database. The IM user may set self-defining rich states, for example "I'm in Tianjin", in the IM system or by the third party server. If the rich states are set by the third party server, the third party server sends new state information to the IM server after<br><br>
setting the rich states every time, and the IM server keeps the rich states sent by the third party server last time after the IM client quits the IM server.<br>
Step 303: The third party server sends a state request of the IM user, which includes at least a unique identity of the IM user in the IM system, to the IM server.<br>
Step 304: After receiving the state request from the third party server, the IM server queries the relational database for the state of the IM user corresponding to the unique identity, and returns to the third party server the found the state of the IM user. The state of the IM user may be a state of the IM user being in the IM system, e.g., an online or offline state, or a rich state set by the IM user, for example "don't trouble me".<br>
At the same time, the IM server determines the authorization state of the third party server. If the authorized third party server is preset to interact with the IM server only via a dedicated interface, the IM server may determine the authorization state of the third party server by the type of the interface for exchanging data; if the authorized third party server is preset to interact with the IM server via a public interface, the IM server may determine the authorization state of the third party server by the authorization identity in the interface parameter or by authorization information stored by itself. After the authorization state of the third party server is determined, the IM server returns different service providing rights to the third party server according to the authorization state. If the third party server is authorized by the IM system, the service providing right is relatively high, for example including popping up a designated web page, starting and executing a designated programming module. If the third party server is unauthorized by the IM system, the service providing right is relatively low, for example only including popping up a designated web page. The service providing right returned by the IM server to the third party server may be a command for the IM server allowing the third party server to provide a service so as to be executed by the third party server.<br>
Step 305: The third party server displays the state of the IM user on its own service platform according to the returned the state of the IM user in an image mode or by a designated value. At the same time, the third party server provides a service for the IM client according to the received service providing right, i.e., execute the command for allowing the third party server to provide a service returned by the IM server. For<br><br>
example, the state of the IM user on the service platform of the third party server may be returned to the IM server and added in the relational database, i.e., the personalized state of the IM user is added; alternatively, when the IM user is online, other users may leave a message to the IM client by the service platform of the third party server, and the message is sent to the IM client by the IM server.<br>
The command which the IM server allows the third party server to execute further includes: starting or activating the IM client, jumping a designated web page, and starting a designated programming module or running a designated process module. After the command is executed, the third party server returns a command execution result to the IM client. After receiving the command execution result sent by the third party server, the IM client may execute a certain action, e.g., self-starting or activating a certain function.<br>
In accordance with the above system and method, the third party server may obtain the state of the IM user and provide a service for the IM user according to the state of the IM user. The IM user may not only obtain the state of a contact person by the IM system, but also obtain the states of other IM users by the third party server. In addition, the IM user may add and modify its own personalized states by the third party server.<br>
The embodiments of the present invention may be modified appropriately during specific implementation to meet the detailed requirements of specific cases. It is thereby understood that the specific embodiments described in this disclosure are demonstrative rather than limiting the protection scope of the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
