				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS TO MONITOR A VALVE ADAPTED TO<br>
CONTROL MODE TO GEAR TRANSITIONS DURING OPERATION OF<br>
AN ELECTRO-MECHANICAL TRANSMISSION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This disclosure pertains generally to control systems for electromechanical<br>
transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Powertrain architectures comprise torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to a vehicle driveline. One such<br>
transmission includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from<br>
a prime mover power source, typically an internal combustion engine, and an<br>
output member for delivering motive torque from the transmission to the<br>
vehicle driveline and to wheels of the vehicle. Electric machines, operatively<br>
connected to an electrical energy storage device, comprise motor/generators<br>
operable to generate motive torque for input to the transmission,<br>
independently of torque input from the internal combustion engine. The<br>
electric machines are further operable to transform vehicle kinetic energy,<br>
transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy that is storable in<br>
the electrical energy storage device. A control system monitors various inputs<br>
from the vehicle and the operator and provides operational control of the<br><br>
powertrain system, including controlling transmission gear shifting,<br>
controlling the torque-generative devices, and regulating the electrical power<br>
interchange between the electrical energy storage device and the electric<br>
machines.<br>
[0004] The exemplary electro-mechanical transmissions are selectively<br>
operative in fixed gear operation and continuously variable operation through<br>
actuation of torque-transfer clutches, typically employing a hydraulic circuit to<br>
effect clutch actuation. A fixed gear operation occurs when the ratio of the<br>
rotational speed of the transmission output member to the rotational speed of<br>
the input member is constant, typically due to actuation of one or more torque-<br>
transfer clutches. A continuously variable operation occurs when the ratio of<br>
the rotational speed of the transmission output member to the rotational speed<br>
of the input member is variable based upon operating speeds of one or more<br>
electric machines. The electric machines can be selectively connected to the<br>
output member via actuation of a clutch, or directly by fixed mechanical<br>
connections. Clutch actuation and deactivation is typically effected through a<br>
hydraulic circuit, including electrically-actuated hydraulic flow management<br>
valves, pressure control solenoids, and pressure monitoring devices controlled<br>
by a control module.<br>
[0005] During operation, there is a need to monitor operation to identify a<br>
mismatch between a commanded operating range state and an actual operating<br>
range state. In such a situation, a mode-gear mismatch may occur, including<br>
for example the control system commanding continuously variable operation,<br>
when the transmission is actually operating in fixed gear operation. However,<br>
operation of the powertrain may mask presence of the mismatch. When this<br><br>
occurs, the control system tries to force engine speed to a calculated optimum<br>
speed intended for a continuously variable operation. The result may be an<br>
unwanted change in operation of the vehicle. There is a need to effectively<br>
identify absence of a mismatch, identify presence of a mismatch, and mitigate<br>
effects of any mismatch.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] An electro-mechanical transmission includes a hydraulic circuit<br>
having a plurality of flow management valves and pressure control solenoids<br>
operative to actuate a plurality of clutches and a plurality of pressure<br>
monitoring devices adapted to monitor the hydraulic circuit. The transmission<br>
is operative in fixed gear and continuously variable operating range states<br>
through selective actuation of the clutches. A method to monitor the operation<br>
of the transmission includes controlling position of one of the flow<br>
management valves, the one of the flow management valves adapted to<br>
selectively control operation of the electro-mechanical transmission in one of<br>
the fixed gear and the continuously variable operating range states. A fault in<br>
the one of the flow management valves is detected based upon outputs of<br>
predetermined ones of the pressure monitoring devices during steady state<br>
operation in one of the continuously variable operating range states. And, a<br>
fault in the one of the flow management valves is detected based upon the<br>
output of one of the predetermined ones of the pressure monitoring devices<br>
during a transition in the one of the flow management valves.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0012] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the depictions are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating embodiments of the invention only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict a system comprising an<br>
engine 14, transmission 10, driveline 90, control system, and hydraulic control<br>
circuit 42 (Fig. 4) which has been constructed in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The exemplary hybrid powertrain<br>
system is configured to execute the control scheme depicted hereinbelow with<br>
reference to Fig. 5. Mechanical aspects of the exemplary transmission 10 are<br>
disclosed in detail in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,953,409, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. The exemplary two-mode, compound-split,<br>
electro-mechanical hybrid transmission embodying the concepts of the present<br><br>
invention is depicted in Fig. 1. The transmission 10 includes an input shaft 12<br>
having an input speed, Ni that is preferably driven by the internal combustion<br>
engine 14, and an output shaft 64 having an output rotational speed, No.<br>
[0013] The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal<br>
combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transmit torque to<br>
the transmission via shaft 12, and can be either a spark-ignition or a<br>
compression-ignition engine. The engine 14 has a crankshaft having<br>
characteristic speed NE which is operatively connected to the transmission<br>
input shaft 12. The output of the engine, comprising speed NE and output<br>
torque TE can differ from transmission input speed N1 and engine input torque<br>
T1 when a torque management device (not shown) is placed therebetween.<br>
[0014] The transmission 10 utilizes three planetary-gear sets 24, 26 and 28,<br>
and four torque-transmitting devices, i.e., clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and<br>
C4 75. An electro-hydraulic control system 42, preferably controlled by<br>
transmission control module (TCM) 17, is operative to control actuation and<br>
deactivation of the clutches. Clutches C2 and C4 preferably comprise<br>
hydraulically-actuated rotating friction clutches. Clutches C1 and C3<br>
preferably comprise comprising hydraulically-actuated stationary devices<br>
grounded to the transmission case 68. Each clutch is preferably hydraulically<br>
actuated, receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid from a pump 88 via an electro-<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0015] There is a first electric machine comprising a motor/generator 56,<br>
referred to as MG-A, and a second electric machine comprising a<br>
motor/generator 72, referred to as MG-B operatively connected to the<br>
transmission via the planetary gears. Each of the machines includes a stator, a<br><br>
rotor, and a resolver assembly 80, 82. The stator for each machine is<br>
grounded to outer transmission case 68, and includes a stator core with coiled<br>
electrical windings extending therefrom. The rotor for MG-A 56 is supported<br>
on a hub plate gear that is operably attached to output shaft 60 via carrier 26.<br>
The rotor for MG-B 72 is attached to sleeve shaft hub 66. The resolver<br>
assemblies 80, 82 are appropriately positioned and assembled on MG-A 56<br>
and MG-B 72. Each resolver assembly 80, 82 comprises a known variable<br>
reluctance device including a resolver stator, operably connected to the stator<br>
of each electric machine, and a resolver rotor, operably connected to the rotor<br>
of each electric machine. Each resolver 80, 82 comprises a sensing device<br>
adapted to sense rotational position of the resolver stator relative to the<br>
resolver rotor, and identify the rotational position. Signals output from the<br>
resolvers are interpreted to provide rotational speeds for MG-A 56 and MG-B<br>
72, referred to as NA and NB. Transmission output shaft 64 is operably<br>
connected to a vehicle driveline 90 to provide motive output torque, To, to<br>
vehicle wheels. There is a transmission output speed sensor 84, operative to<br>
monitor rotational speed of the output shaft 64. Each of the vehicle wheels is<br>
equipped with a sensor 94 adapted to monitor wheel speed, the output of<br>
which is monitored by the control system and used to determine absolute<br>
wheel speed and relative wheel speed for braking control, traction control, and<br>
vehicle acceleration management.<br>
[0016] The transmission 10 receives input torque from the torque-<br>
generative devices, including the engine 14, and MG-A 56 and MG-B 72,<br>
referred to as 'T1', 'TΑ', and 'TΒ' respectively, as a result of energy<br>
conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an electrical energy<br><br>
storage device (ESD) 74. The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-coupled to<br>
transmission power inverter module (TPIM) 19 via DC transfer conductors<br>
27. The TPIM 19 is an element of the control system described hereinafter<br>
with regard to Fig. 2. The TPIM 19 transmits electrical energy to and from<br>
MG-A 56 by transfer conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits<br>
electrical energy to and from MG-B 72 by transfer conductors 31. Electrical<br>
current is transmitted to and from the ESD 74 in accordance with whether<br>
the ESD 74 is being charged or discharged. TPIM 19 includes the pair of<br>
power inverters and respective motor control modules configured to receive<br>
motor control commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing<br>
motor drive or regeneration functionality. Preferably, MG-A 56 and MG-B<br>
72 are three-phase AC machines each having a rotor operable to rotate<br>
within a stator that is mounted on a case of the transmission. The inverters<br>
comprise known complementary three-phase power electronics devices.<br>
[0017] Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic block diagram of the control<br>
system, comprising a distributed control module architecture, is shown. The<br>
elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall vehicle control<br>
architecture, and are operable to provide coordinated system control of the<br>
powertrain system described herein. The control system is operable to<br>
synthesize pertinent information and inputs, and execute algorithms to control<br>
various actuators to achieve control targets, including such parameters as fuel<br>
economy, emissions, performance, driveability, and protection of hardware,<br>
including batteries of ESD 74 and MG-A 56 and MG-B 72. The distributed<br>
control module architecture includes engine control module (ECM) 23,<br><br>
transmission control module (TCM) 17, battery pack control module (BPCM)<br>
21, and TPIM 19. A hybrid control module (HCP) 5 provides overarching<br>
control and coordination of the aforementioned control modules. There is a<br>
User Interface (UI) 13 operably connected to a plurality of devices through<br>
which a vehicle operator typically controls or directs operation of the<br>
powertrain including the transmission 10, including an operator torque request<br>
(To_req) and operator brake request (BRAKE). Exemplary vehicle input<br>
devices to the UI 13 include an accelerator pedal, a brake pedal, a transmission<br>
gear selector, and a vehicle speed cruise control. Each of the aforementioned<br>
control modules communicates with other control modules, sensors, and<br>
actuators via a local area network (LAN) bus 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for<br>
structured communication of control parameters and commands among the<br>
various control modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is<br>
application-specific. The LAN bus and appropriate protocols provide for<br>
robust messaging and multi-control module interfacing between the<br>
aforementioned control modules, and other control modules providing<br>
functionality such as antilock braking, traction control, and vehicle stability.<br>
[0018] The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19,<br>
and BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the UI 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the battery pack, the HCP 5 generates various<br>
commands, including: the operator torque request (Toreq), the engine input<br>
torque T1, clutch torque, (TCL_N) for the N various torque-transfer clutches C1,<br>
C2, C3, C4 of the transmission 10; and motor torques TAand TΒ for MG-A 56<br>
and MG-B 72. The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the electro-hydraulic<br><br>
control circuit 42, including for monitoring various pressure sensing devices<br>
(not shown) and generating and executing control signals for various solenoids<br>
to control pressure switches and control valves contained therein.<br>
[0019] The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators,<br>
respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
shown as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque<br>
command from the HCP 5, and generates a desired axle torque, and an<br>
indication of actual engine input torque, T1, to the transmission, which is<br>
communicated to the HCP 5. For simplicity, ECM 23 is shown generally<br>
having bi-directional interface with engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Various<br>
other parameters that may be sensed by ECM 23 include engine coolant<br>
temperature, engine input speed, NE, to shaft 12 (which translate to<br>
transmission input speed, N1) manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and<br>
ambient pressure. Various actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23<br>
include fuel injectors, ignition modules, and throttle control modules.<br>
[0020] The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
signals to the transmission. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include<br>
estimated clutch torques (TCL_N) for each of the N clutches, i.e., C1, C2, C3,<br>
and C4, and rotational output speed, No, of the output shaft 64. Other<br>
actuators and sensors may be used to provide additional information from the<br>
TCM to the HCP for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from<br>
pressure switches and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids and shift<br><br>
solenoids to actuate various clutches to achieve various transmission operating<br>
modes, as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0021] The BPCM 21 is signally connected one or more sensors operable to<br>
monitor electrical current or voltage parameters of the ESD 74 to provide<br>
information about the state of the batteries to the HCP 5. Such information<br>
includes battery state-of-charge, amp-hour throughput, battery temperature,<br>
battery voltage and available battery power.<br>
[0022] Each of the aforementioned control modules is preferably a general-<br>
purpose digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central<br>
processing unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory (ROM),<br>
random access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory<br>
(EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog<br>
(D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate<br>
signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each control module has a set of<br>
control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations<br>
stored in ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the various computers is preferably<br>
accomplished using the aforementioned LAN 6.<br>
[0023] Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the control<br>
modules are typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute<br>
control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device,<br>
using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular<br><br>
intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during<br>
ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be<br>
executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0024] Referring now to Fig. 3, the exemplary two-mode, compound-split,<br>
electro-mechanical transmission operates in one of several operating range<br>
states comprising fixed gear operation and continuously variable operation,<br>
described with reference to Table 1, below.<br><br>
[0025] The various transmission operating range states described in the table<br>
indicate which of the specific clutches C1, C2, C3, and C4 are engaged or<br>
actuated for each of the operating range states. A first continuously variable<br>
operating range state, i.e., Mode I, is selected when clutch C170 is actuated in<br>
order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set 28. The<br>
engine 14 can be either on or off. A second continuously variable operating<br>
range state, i.e., Mode II, is selected when clutch C170 is released and clutch<br>
C2 62 is simultaneously actuated to connect the shaft 60 to the carrier of the<br>
third planetary gear set 28. Again, the engine 14 can be either on or off. For<br><br>
purposes of this description, Engine Off is defined by engine input speed, NE,<br>
being equal to zero revolutions per minute (RPM), i.e., the engine crankshaft<br>
is not rotating, typically as a result of the engine being decoupled from the<br>
transmission. Other factors outside the scope of this disclosure affect when<br>
the electric machines MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 operate as motors and<br>
generators, and are not discussed herein.<br>
[0026] Mode I and Mode II are characterized by single clutch applications,<br>
i.e., either clutch C1 62 or C2 70, and by the controlled speed and torque of<br>
the electric machines 56 and 72, which can be referred to as a continuously<br>
variable transmission mode. Certain operating rage states are described below<br>
in which fixed gear ratios are achieved by applying an additional clutch. This<br>
additional clutch may be clutch C3 73 or C4 75, as shown in the table, above.<br>
When the additional clutch is applied, fixed gear operation of input-to-output<br>
speed of the transmission, i.e., N1/NO, is achieved. During fixed gear<br>
operation, the rotations of machines MG-A 56 and MG-B 72, i.e., NΑ and NΒ,<br>
are dependent on internal rotation of the mechanism as defined by the<br>
clutching and proportional to the input speed measured at shaft 12.<br>
[0027] In response to an operator's action, as captured by the UI 13, the<br>
supervisory HCP control module 5 and one or more of the other control<br>
modules determine the operator torque request to be executed at shaft 64.<br>
Final vehicle acceleration is affected by other factors, including, e.g., road<br>
load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The transmission operating range state is<br>
determined for the exemplary transmission based upon a variety of operating<br>
characteristics of the powertrain. This includes an operator demand for<br>
torque, typically communicated through inputs to the UI 13 as previously<br><br>
described. Additionally, a demand for output torque is predicated on external<br>
conditions, including, e.g., road grade, road surface conditions, or wind load.<br>
The transmission operating range state may be predicated on a powertrain<br>
torque demand caused by a control module command to operate one of the<br>
electric machines as an electrical generator or as an electric motor. The<br>
transmission operating range state can be determined by an optimization<br>
algorithm or routine operable to determine optimum system efficiency based<br>
upon operator demand for power, battery state of charge, and energy<br>
efficiencies of the engine 14 and MG-A 56 and MG-B 72. The control system<br>
manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 based<br>
upon an outcome of the executed optimization routine, and system<br>
optimization occurs to optimize system efficiencies to improve fuel economy<br>
and manage battery charging. Furthermore, operation can be determined<br>
based upon a fault in a component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the<br>
parametric states of the torque-generative devices, and determines the output<br>
of the transmission required to arrive at the desired torque output, as described<br>
hereinbelow. Under the direction of the HCP 5, the transmission 10 operates<br>
over a range of output speeds from slow to fast in order to meet the operator<br>
demand.<br>
[0028] The energy storage system and electric machines MG-A 56 and<br>
MG-B 72 are electrically-operatively coupled for power flow therebetween.<br>
Furthermore, the engine, the electric machines, and the electro-mechanical<br>
transmission are mechanically-operatively coupled to transmit power<br>
therebetween to generate a power flow to the output. In Mode I operation, the<br>
transmission operates as an input-split electrically variable transmission<br><br>
(EVT). In Mode II operation, the transmission operates as a compound-split<br>
EVT. While operating in either of these two modes, the control system<br>
performs closed loop control on an engine speed which optimizes fuel<br>
economy while still meeting the torque request and given power constraints.<br>
It then commands motor speeds to vary the input-to-output speed ratio to<br>
accelerate the vehicle, in response to the operator torque request. Through use<br>
of the two additional clutches, the transmission also has the capability of<br>
achieving one of four fixed gear ratios. While operating in a fixed gear, the<br>
vehicle acts as a parallel hybrid and the motors are used only for boosting and<br>
braking/regeneration the vehicle.<br>
[0029] Referring to Fig. 4, a schematic diagram is depicted which provides a<br>
more detailed description of the exemplary electro-hydraulic system for<br>
controlling flow of hydraulic fluid in the exemplary transmission. The main<br>
hydraulic pump 88, driven off the input shaft 12 from the engine 14, and<br>
auxiliary pump 110, operatively electrically controlled by the TPIM 19,<br>
provides pressurized fluid to the hydraulic circuit 42 through valve 140. The<br>
auxiliary pump 110 preferably comprises an electrically-powered pump of an<br>
appropriate size and capacity to provide sufficient flow of pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid into the hydraulic system when operational. Pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid flows into electro-hydraulic control circuit 42, which is<br>
operable to selectively distribute hydraulic pressure to a series of devices,<br>
including the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, active<br>
cooling circuits for machines A and B, and a base cooling circuit for cooling<br>
and lubricating the transmission 10 via passages 142,144 (not depicted in<br>
detail). As previously stated, the TCM 17 is preferably operable to actuate the<br><br>
various clutches to achieve various transmission operation through selective<br>
actuation of hydraulic circuit flow control devices comprising variable<br>
pressure control solenoids (PCS) PCS1 108, PCS2 112, PCS3 114, PCS4 116<br>
and solenoid-controlled flow management valves X-valve 119 and Y-valve<br>
121. The circuit is fluidly connected to pressure switches PS1, PS2, PS3, and<br>
PS4 via passages 124, 122, 126, and 128, respectively. There is an inlet spool<br>
valve 107. The pressure control solenoid PCS1 108 has a control position of<br>
normally high and is operative to modulate fluidic pressure in the hydraulic<br>
circuit through fluidic interaction with controllable pressure regulator 109.<br>
Controllable pressure regulator 109, not shown in detail, interacts with PCS1<br>
108 to control hydraulic pressure in the hydraulic circuit 42 over a range of<br>
pressures, depending upon operating conditions as described hereinafter.<br>
Pressure control solenoid PCS2 112 has a control position of normally low,<br>
and is fluidly connected to spool valve 113 and operative to effect flow<br>
therethrough when actuated. Spool valve 113 is fluidly connected to pressure<br>
switch PS3 via passage 126. Pressure control solenoid PCS3 114 has a control<br>
position of normally low, and is fluidly connected to spool valve 115 and<br>
operative to effect flow therethrough when actuated. Spool valve 115 is<br>
fluidly connected to pressure switch PS1 via passage 124. Pressure control<br>
solenoid PCS4 116 has a control position of normally low, and is fluidly<br>
connected to spool valve 117 and operative to effect flow therethrough when<br>
actuated. Spool valve 117 is fluidly connected to pressure switch PS4 via<br>
passage 128.<br>
[0030] The X-Valve 119 and Y-Valve 121 each comprise flow management<br>
valves controlled by solenoids 118, 120, respectively, in the exemplary<br><br>
system, and have control states of High (1) and Low (0). The control states<br>
refer to positions of each valve with which to control flow to different devices<br>
in the hydraulic circuit 42 and the transmission 10. The X-valve 119 is<br>
operative to direct pressurized fluid to clutches C3 and C4 and cooling<br>
systems for stators of MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 via fluidic passages 136, 138,<br>
144,142 respectively, depending upon the source of the fluidic input, as is<br>
described hereinafter. The Y-valve 121 is operative to direct pressurized fluid<br>
to clutches C1 and C2 via fluidic passages 132 and 134 respectively,<br>
depending upon the source of the fluidic input, as is described hereinafter.<br>
The Y-valve 121 is fluidly connected to pressure switch PS2 via passage 122.<br>
A more detailed description of the exemplary electro-hydraulic control circuit<br>
42 is provided in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application No. 11/263,216,<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0031] An exemplary logic table to accomplish control of the exemplary<br>
electro-hydraulic control circuit 42 is provided with reference to Table 2,<br>
below.<br><br><br>
[0032] Selective control of the X and Y valves and actuation of the solenoids<br>
PCS2, PCS3, and PCS4 facilitate flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate clutches<br>
C1, C2, C3, and C4, and provide cooling for the stators of MG-A 56 and MG-<br>
B 72.<br>
[0033] In operation, one of the fixed gear and continuously variable<br>
operating range states is determined for the exemplary transmission based<br>
upon a variety of operating characteristics of the powertrain. This includes an<br>
operator torque request, typically communicated through inputs to the UI 13 as<br>
previously described. Additionally, a demand for output torque is predicated<br>
on external conditions, including, e.g., road grade, road surface conditions, or<br>
wind load. Transmission operating range state may be predicated on a<br><br>
powertrain torque demand caused by a control module command to operate of<br>
the electric machines as an electrical generator or as an electrical motor.<br>
Operation can be determined by an optimization algorithm or routine operable<br>
to determine optimum system efficiency based upon operator demand for<br>
power, battery state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the engine 14 and<br>
MG-A 56 and MG-B 72. The control system manages torque inputs from the<br>
engine 14 and MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 based upon an outcome of the executed<br>
optimization routine, and system optimization occurs to optimize system<br>
efficiencies to improve fuel economy and manage battery charging.<br>
Furthermore, operation can be determined based upon a fault in a component<br>
or system.<br>
[0034] Referring now to the transmission described with reference to Figs. 1,<br>
2, 3, and 4, and Tables 1 and 2, specific aspects of the transmission and<br>
control system are described herein. The control system is operative to<br>
selectively actuate the pressure control devices and the flow management<br>
valves based upon a demand for torque, presence of a fault, and temperatures<br>
of the electric motors. The control system selectively commands one of a low-<br>
range continuously variable operation, a high-range continuously variable<br>
operation, a low range state, and a high range state based upon selective<br>
actuation of the X-valve 118 and Y-valve 120 flow management valves. The<br>
control system effects actuation of the stator cooling system for the first<br>
electric machine (MG-A Stator Cool), the stator cooling system for the second<br>
electric machine (MG-B Stator Cool), and the first hydraulically-actuated<br>
clutch (C1) based upon selective actuation of the pressure control devices<br>
PCS2, PCS3, and PCS4 when the low-range continuously variable operation<br><br>
has been commanded. Furthermore, the control system is operative to effect<br>
actuation of the stator cooling system for MG-A 56, stator cooling system for<br>
MG-B 72, and the second hydraulically-actuated clutch C2 based upon<br>
selective actuation of the pressure control devices when a high-range<br>
continuously variable operation has been commanded. The control system is<br>
operative to effect actuation of the first, second, and fourth hydraulically-<br>
actuated clutches (i.e., C1, C2, C4) based upon selective actuation of the<br>
pressure control devices when a low-range state has been commanded,<br>
comprising operation in one of FG1, FG2, MI and MII via selective actuation<br>
of the clutches. The control system is operative to effect actuation of the<br>
second, third, and fourth hydraulically-actuated clutches (i.e., C2, C3, C4)<br>
based upon selective actuation of the pressure control devices when a high-<br>
range state has been commanded, comprising operation in one of FG2, FG3,<br>
FG4, and MI and MII via selective actuation of the clutches.<br>
[0035] As previously stated, fluid output from each of the second, third and<br>
fourth pressure control devices (i.e., PCS2, PCS3, and PCS4) is selectively<br>
mapped to one of the four hydraulically-actuated clutches and stator cooling<br>
systems for MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 based upon commanded positions of the<br>
first and second flow management valves. Therefore, selective actuation of<br>
PCS2 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to provide cooling to the stator of MG-B<br>
72, when both the X-valve and the Y-valve are commanded to Low. Selective<br>
actuation of PCS2 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate clutch C2 when<br>
either of the X-valve and the Y-valve are commanded to High. Selective<br>
actuation of PCS3 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate clutch C1 when<br>
both the X-valve and the Y-valve are commanded to Low. Selective actuation<br><br>
of PCS3 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to provide cooling to the stator of MG-<br>
B 72 when the X-valve is commanded to Low and the Y-valve is commanded<br>
to High. Selective actuation of PCS3 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate<br>
clutch C1 when the X-valve is commanded to High and the Y-valve is<br>
commanded to Low. Selective actuation of PCS3 effects flow of hydraulic<br>
fluid to actuate clutch C3 when both the X-valve and the Y-valve are<br>
commanded to High. Selective actuation of PCS4 effects flow of hydraulic<br>
fluid to provide cooling to the stator of MG-A 56 when the X-valve is<br>
commanded to Low, regardless of the position to which the Y-valve is<br>
commanded. Selective actuation of PCS4 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to<br>
actuate clutch C4 when the X-valve is commanded to High, regardless of the<br>
position to which the Y-valve is commanded.<br>
[0036] Referring now to the flowchart depicted in Fig. 5, with reference to<br>
the exemplary transmission described with reference to Figs. 1,2, 3, and 4,<br>
and Tables 1 and 2, specific aspects of controlling and monitoring operation of<br>
the exemplary transmission are described. In operation, the electro-<br>
mechanical transmission is commanded by one of the control modules to<br>
operate in one of the continuously variable operating range states, i.e., either<br>
MI or MII, through selective actuation of either clutch C1 or clutch C2,<br>
including the X-valve 119 controlled to a low logic state. This includes<br>
ongoing operation in the continuously variable mode, wherein there is no<br>
transition out of the continuously variable mode, operation comprising a<br>
transition from fixed gear mode to the continuously variable mode, and during<br>
system startup wherein the vehicle operates initially the continuously variable<br><br>
mode. Operation of the transmission is monitored, including hydraulic<br>
pressures in the hydraulic circuit.<br>
[0037] In each of the continuously variable operating range states only one<br>
clutch is applied, which corresponds to one pressure control solenoid (PCS) in<br>
the hydraulically high state for the exemplary embodiment. The hydraulic<br>
system is designed such that if a hardware fault occurs affecting either of the<br>
remaining two pressure control solenoids while operating in either MI or MII,<br>
the only result is motor stator cooling. It can be seen with reference to Table 2<br>
that in either of MI or MII, the X-valve 119 is in a hydraulically low state. If<br>
there is a fault in the X-valve causing it to remain in a hydraulically high state,<br>
a single fault in one of the PCS devices can lead to an unacceptable operating<br>
condition. For example, were the X-valve to have a fault causing it to remain<br>
'HIGH', the vehicle continues to operate in MI by operating in the 'Low<br>
Range' state and commanding PCS3 hydraulically high. However, any<br>
subsequent fault on PCS2 in HIGH position may result in application of clutch<br>
C2, with a corresponding mismatch, in that Mode Ml is commanded, whereas<br>
GR2 is executed in the transmission.<br>
[0038] The invention comprises monitoring the X-valve to identify faults<br>
related thereto, including, e.g., a fault with the solenoid 118 or a fault causing<br>
the spool valve to stick, i.e., remain in a fixed position. Monitoring comprises<br>
monitoring outputs of the pressure switches, specifically PS3 126 and PS4<br>
128. Monitoring occurs during steady state operation in one of the<br>
continuously variable operating range states, during any transition between MI<br>
or MII continuously variable operating range states, and during vehicle startup,<br>
subsequent to a key-off event. A fault is identified in the one of the flow<br><br>
management valves based upon the outputs of one or both the pressure<br>
switches PS3 126 and PS4 128. This is now described in detail.<br>
[0039] The X-valve 119 multiplexes flow between the PCS solenoids and<br>
valves, and routes hydraulic flow between the clutches used in one of the fixed<br>
gears, and MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 cooling. Additionally, the X-valve is used<br>
to redundantly disengage gear clutches, to remediate faults related inadvertent<br>
actuation of an additional clutch, referred to as a three-clutch tie-up, a mode-<br>
gear mismatch, and, a neutral-mode mismatch. There is a potential for a<br>
mode-gear mismatch when inputs to the control system indicate the system is<br>
operating in either of MI or MII, and a clutch is unintentionally applied,<br>
inadvertently placing the transmission in a fixed gear mode as a result of a<br>
fault related to the X-valve. There is a potential for a three-clutch tie-up when<br>
the vehicle is operating in one of the fixed gears, and fault occurs in one of the<br>
PCS devices, resulting in application of a third clutch as a result of a fault<br>
related to the X-valve. The mode-gear mismatch and three-clutch tie-up have<br>
the potential to occur only if the X-valve is in the hydraulically high state.<br>
Any fault which results in the X valve remaining in the hydraulically high<br>
state is preferably detected expeditiously<br>
[0040] Methods for monitoring the X-valve, in the form of algorithms, are<br>
executed in one or more of the control modules during ongoing operation.<br>
Operation of the transmission is monitored, including hydraulic pressures in<br>
the hydraulic circuit. During ongoing operation in the continuously variable<br>
mode, wherein there is no transition out of the continuously variable mode<br>
(510), the monitoring scheme includes detecting an unintended transition from<br>
a hydraulically low to a hydraulically high state when not commanded,<br><br>
resulting in the valve being stuck high in steady state operation. During a<br>
transition from fixed gear mode to the continuously variable mode (520), the<br>
monitoring scheme detects whether the X-valve is stuck in a hydraulically<br>
high state after being commanded to a hydraulically low state, resulting in<br>
being stuck high in transition; and detects whether the X-valve is stuck in a<br>
hydraulically low state after being commanded to a hydraulically high state,<br>
resulting in being stuck low in transition. During system startup wherein the<br>
vehicle operates initially the continuously variable mode, the monitoring<br>
scheme detects whether the X-valve is stuck in bore at vehicle start-up,<br>
carrying over from a previous key-on cycle. Upon detection of a fault in the<br>
X-valve in any of the modes described, the control system executes actions to<br>
mitigate effects of the X-valve fault.<br>
[0041] The tables above demonstrate that fixed gear operation requires the<br>
X-valve to the hydraulically high state, whereas both MI and MII operation<br>
can be achieved with the X-valve in either hydraulically high or low states.<br>
During ongoing operation, when either MI or MII is commanded, states EVT<br>
Lo or EVT Hi are requested, respectively. Each of the continuously variable<br>
operating states requires application of a single clutch corresponding to one of<br>
the pressure control solenoids (PCS) controlled in the hydraulically high state.<br>
A hardware fault that affects either of the remaining two pressure control<br>
solenoids while operating in either EVT Lo or EVT Hi results in motor<br>
cooling, i.e., MG-A Stator cool and MG-B Stator cool, respectively.<br>
[0042] The first monitoring scheme comprises monitoring the X-valve 119<br>
during steady-state operation, typically in one of the continuously variable<br>
operating modes, to detect an unintended transition from a hydraulically low<br><br>
to a hydraulically high state when not commanded, resulting in the valve being<br>
stuck high in steady state operation (512). In the mechanization described<br>
hereinabove, the X-valve state is be determined by monitoring the pressure<br>
switches associated with PCS2 and PCS4, i.e., PS3 and PS4. When the X<br>
valve transitions from high to low or low to high, both PS3 and PS4 toggle, or<br>
invert, their current state, and outputs of both PS3 and PS4 are monitored to<br>
detect such toggling. An unintended toggling may caused by a mechanical<br>
fault occurring with the solenoid 118. In operation, when the vehicle is<br>
operating in either MI or MII, the X-valve is commanded in a hydraulically<br>
low state. A fault occurring in the solenoid which results in pressurizing the<br>
X-valve pressurizes causes both PS3 and PS4 to toggle. Thus when PS3 and<br>
PS4 toggle simultaneously (i.e., within a calibratable time window), there is an<br>
indication that the X-valve solenoid has been pressurized, and the X-valve<br>
moved to a hydraulically high state. A software flag is set, and the control<br>
module modifies the control strategy to address the fault and mitigate and<br>
eliminate risks (514). When the software flag remains set for a pre-calibrated<br>
period of time, a software code is set and the vehicle operator is informed,<br>
typically via illumination of a dashboard lamp. Mitigation includes inhibiting<br>
the control system from commanding any gear or motor cooling. In this case,<br>
operation is permitted only in MI and MII, and shifts between MI and MII<br>
through neutral are not permitted. On the next key cycle, the steady state<br>
detection must re-detect the fault. This detection scheme uses two pressure<br>
switch states to determine the position of the X valve.<br>
[0043] The second and third monitoring schemes comprise monitoring the<br>
X-valve 119 during X-valve transitions, resulting in a mode-gear transition.<br><br>
The potential fault, as referred to as 'stuck in bore', occurs when the spool of<br>
the valve is physically jammed against the valve body typically due to<br>
contaminated transmission fluid. The algorithm is executed in conjunction<br>
with a shift command from a Low Range operation to MI, or a High Range<br>
operation to MII, during which the X-valve is commanded to the low state.<br>
[0044] The second monitoring scheme comprises monitoring a mode-gear<br>
transition wherein the X-valve is commanded to a hydraulically high state, X-<br>
CMD-HI (520). This monitoring scheme is executed in conjunction with a<br>
command to shift from one of the mode operating states to the corresponding<br>
range operating state, as depicted with reference to Table 2. The monitoring<br>
system seeks to identify a transition, indicated by toggles of the PS4 and PS3<br>
pressure switches (522), which are expected to occur within a given elapsed<br>
time period after the X-valve command. The time window is calibratable and<br>
is a function of transmission fluid temperature, e.g., colder temperatures<br>
having longer elapsed times to allow for slower solenoid movement. When<br>
the pressure switches toggle as expected, operation continues. If the pressure<br>
switches do not toggle within the elapsed time period, movement of the X-<br>
valve cannot be confirmed, and it is determined that the X-valve is stuck low<br>
in transition. The software flag is set, and the control module modifies the<br>
control strategy to address the fault and mitigate and eliminate risks, primarily<br>
by inhibiting cooling (524). When the software flag remains set for a pre-<br>
calibrated period of time, a software code is set and the vehicle operator is<br>
informed, typically via illumination of a dashboard lamp. Some shifting<br>
between gears is permitted resulting in ongoingly retesting the system. If the<br><br>
X-valve subsequently moves, it is detected, and the mitigation is discontinued.<br>
On the next key cycle, the steady state detection must re-detect any fault.<br>
[0045] The third monitoring scheme comprises monitoring a mode-gear<br>
transition wherein the X-valve is commanded to a hydraulically low state, X-<br>
CMD-LO (530). This monitoring scheme is executed in conjunction with a<br>
command to shift from one of the range operating states to the corresponding<br>
mode operating state, as depicted with reference to Table 2. The monitoring<br>
system again seeks to identify a transition, indicated by toggles of the PS4 and<br>
PS3 pressure switches (532), which are expected to occur within a given<br>
elapsed time period after the X-valve command. Again, the time window is<br>
calibratable and is a function of transmission fluid temperature, e.g., colder<br>
temperatures having longer elapsed times allow for slower solenoid<br>
movement. When the pressure switches toggle as expected, operation<br>
continues. If the pressure switches do not toggle within the elapsed time<br>
period, movement of the X-valve cannot be confirmed, and it is determined<br>
that the X-valve is stuck high in transition. The software flag is set, and the<br>
control module modifies the control strategy to address the fault and mitigate<br>
and eliminate risks, by permitting operation in the mode operating range state.<br>
Operation in one of the fixed gears is not permitted, and cooling is not<br>
permitted. Furthermore, operation is permitted only in MI and MII, and shifts<br>
between MII and MI through neutral are not permitted (534). When the<br>
software flag remains set for a pre-calibrated period of time, a software code is<br>
set and the vehicle operator is informed, typically via illumination of a<br>
dashboard lamp. The mitigation continues for the key-cycle, unless a pass is<br><br>
subsequently detected. On the next key cycle, the steady state detection must<br>
re-detect the fault.<br>
[0046] The fourth monitoring scheme comprises monitoring the X-valve 119<br>
at vehicle start-up from a previous key-on cycle (540), in order to detect a<br>
stuck-in-bore fault that may not have been detected before key-down during<br>
the previous engine-on cycle, and to verify previously identified faults. On<br>
key up and system start, the control system commands Neutral operation, with<br>
both the X and Y valves commanded in a hydraulically low state. The steady<br>
state X valve monitoring described above looks for both PS3 and PS4 to be<br>
incorrect in order to determine the X valve to be high. If the X-valve is stuck<br>
in bore, the PS3 pressure switch reads hydraulically low. The result, on key-<br>
up, is that only PS4 provides an unexpected reading in the event of a stuck<br>
valve, the cause of which can include a fault with either of the PCS4 or PS4<br>
devices. Therefore, at controller wakeup, when PCS4 is determined to be<br>
stuck high by the hydraulic detections (542), another software flag is set,<br>
comprising a X_valve_stuck_Hi_on_startup flag. When PCS4 is not<br>
determined to be stuck, normal operation continues (543). The<br>
X_valve_stuck_Hi_on_startup flag inhibits actions of Stator A cooling and the<br>
PCS4 stuck high detection. Furthermore, the X_valve_stuck_Hi_on_startup<br>
flag inhibits operation in any one of MII, and FG2, FG3 and FG4. Operation<br>
is only permitted in MI and FG1, including disabling monitoring of PCS4<br>
(544). During normal operation, when the control system commands FGl<br>
(546), which includes a command to the X-valve to transition to HIGH state,<br>
the X-valve is monitored to detect the transition to FG1. If operation in FG1 is<br>
not commanded and achieved within a preset time period, a code is set, and<br><br>
mitigation happens (547). The mitigation strategy comprises inhibiting motor<br>
cooling, as described in Step 524.<br>
[0047] When FG1 operation is achieved, normal operation of the<br>
transmission is permitted (548), and monitoring of PCS4 is re-enabled to<br>
permit detection during a transition. During normal operation, when a shift<br>
command out of FG1 occurs, PCS4 is monitored, to determine if it is stuck<br>
HIGH (550), and if so, a PCS4 fault is identified, and appropriate action is<br>
taken, including identifying presence of the PCS4 fault (551), and a code is<br>
set, and mitigation happens (547). If a PCS4 fault is not identified, normal<br>
operation continues, with an expectation for a commanded mode-gear<br>
transition which commands the X valve to LOW (552). The control system<br>
monitors the transition as previously described with reference to Steps 530,<br>
532, and 534.<br>
