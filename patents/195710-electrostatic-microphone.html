				<td>1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to electrostatic microphones comprising a capsule housing in which a diaphragm and a rigid electrode as well as, optionally, a friction pill and an electric circuit on a printed circuit board are arranged.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
The invention thus relates to electroacoustic transducers which operate as sound receivers, are used as microphone capsules, and operate according to the electrostatic principle.  Such transducers have, independent of their physical operating mode, a diaphragm which is exposed to a field of sound and is directly excited by it to vibrate.<br>
The electrodes of the electrostatic transducer are an elastic, taut diaphragm and a stationary (rigid) electrode which is usually referred to simply as electrode.  Both together form a capacitor whose electrical capacitance changes as a result of pressure fluctuations of the field of<br>
sound.  Since an electric field is built up between the electrodes of the electrostatic transducer, it is possible to convert the capacitance changes of the transducer by means of an amplifier arranged downstream into electrical voltage changes.<br>
Electrostatic capsules can be divided into two groups with respect to the type of application of the electrical field between its electrodes:<br>
1.	Electrostatic capsules in which the charges which generate the electrical field are applied by means of an externally supplied voltage (polarization voltage) : capacitor capsules.<br>
2.	Electrostatic capsules in which the electrical charge is "frozen" on the electrode or diaphragm so that in this way an externally applied voltage is obsolete: electret capsule.<br>
Such capsules are used in a series of applications in a an increasingly miniaturized form; reference is being had in this respect to mobile telephones or handsfree communication devices in vehicles and the like. The increasing miniaturization, in particular, in connection with the mass<br>
production of such capsules, requires the assembly as well as the principal configuration to be as economical as possible.<br>
According to the prior art both capsule variants have the same type of configuration in common which is illustrated in Fig. 1.  A diaphragm ring 2 is arranged in the capsule housing 1 on which a diaphragm 3 has been pretensioned and fastened. The diaphragm ring 2 must have a certain thickness because its task is to maintain the diaphragm 3 in the pretensioned state.  This can be realized only with a thickness of the diaphragm ring starting approximately at 0.7 mm up to 2 mm. Moreover, the diaphragm together with the diaphragm ring should form a unit which is sufficiently robust in order to be processed automatically or manually. A spacer ring of material 4 having excellent insulating properties is introduced and placed onto the diaphragm ring. By means of this spacer ring, the diaphragm and a rigid electrode 5 are maintained at a fixed distance of a few 10 um.   The electrode 5 which is placed onto the spacer ring 4 in the capsule housing forms the second electrode of the capacitor.  It is manufactured of an electrically conducting material and has a perforation.<br>
An acoustic friction 6 is arranged on the electrode 5. It is conventionally produced of plastic material by an injection molding process and has a hole or opening which is covered or closed by a porous material.  The acoustic friction 6 serves for acoustic tuning of the microphone capsule relative to the frequency response curve of the output level and the pick-up characteristic of the capsule. The microphone capsule is closed at the rear by an electronic printed circuit 7 on which the electronic components which are necessary for the function of the capsule are arranged.<br>
All of the components arranged in the described sequence on the diaphragm have openings in order to allow the sound to impact on the diaphragm also from the backside of the capsule, which is required for the acoustic tuning of the capsule including providing the desired directional dependency of the pick-up characteristic of the capsule.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to reduce the number of components of such a microphone capsule and to simplify the configuration of the capsule without this resulting in a loss of quality.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, this is achieved in that the diaphragm is connected with the front side of the capsule housing.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an electrostatic microphone comprising:<br>
a capsule housing having a front side;<br>
a diaphragm provided within said capsule housing;<br>
a rigid electrode mounted within said capsule housing;<br>
an electrical circuit on a printed circuit board arranged in the capsule housing;<br>
Wherein said diaphragm is connected to and supported directly by the front side of the capsule housing without the necessity of a diaphragm ring.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the capsule housing is provided with an annular shoulder in the area of its front side onto which the diaphragm is mounted, preferably glued, in the stressed or taut state. For this purpose, an adhesive is applied onto the shoulder, for example, by means of a first plunger and, by means of a second plunger, the diaphragm, secured in the tensioned state on the second plunger, is pressed by the second plunger onto the shoulder and is glued onto the shoulder in this way. Subsequently, the spacer ring, the electrode, the friction pill, and the printed circuit board are introduced and mounted, so that, according to the invention, the previously required diaphragm ring is no longer needed.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
In the drawing:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a capsule according to the prior art;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a capsule according to the invention; and<br>
Fig. 3 shows a second embodiment of the capsule according to the invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates the solution according to the invention.  The microphone capsule housing 11 is provided with a step or inner shoulder 12 which makes it possible to eliminate the diaphragm ring.  All other components of the microphone capsule according to the invention of Fig. 2 are identical to those of the capsule according to the prior art as illustrated in Fig. 1.<br>
Since the capsule housing generally is produced by deep-drawing from sheet aluminum, it is no problem to form the shoulder 12 and to provide in this way an integrated "diaphragm ring" within the capsule housing in a single processing step.  Since the total height of the resulting microphone capsule is even smaller than the height that was possible according to the prior art, such a capsule is more space-saving and cheaper than prior art capsules.  Since the height (axial extension) of the microphone capsule according to Fig. 2 is only a few millimeters, the mounting of the diaphragm on the shoulder 12 in the interior of the capsule is no problem for a person skilled in ±he art.  For this purpose, the diaphragm is introduced in a pre-tensioned state by a device into the microphone housing and is connected to<br>
it by gluing in a way known in the art.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Fig. 3.  A capsule housing is illustrated here which differs from that of Fig. 2 in that the capsule housing is of a two-part configuration and is comprised of a housing bottom 21 and a capsule lid 28.  The two-part configuration of the capsule housing can be found frequently for reasons of acoustic tuning, the reason being the following.  The frequency response of a microphone capsule depends on the number and surface area of the sound openings 29 of the lid. For this reason, the capsule housing is frequently divided such that the attachment of different capsule lids 28 is possible.  In this way, by simply exchanging the lid, different types of acoustic tuning of a capsule can be easily realized.<br>
The invention enables with the illustrated configuration of the capsule lid with a shoulder 22 a cheaper manufacture of the entire microphone capsule.  The microphone lid 22 may be comprised of, but must not be comprised of, the same material as the housing bottom 21.  For example, it is possible to produce the capsule housing bottom of aluminum and the capsule housing lid of plastic material.  It is also<br>
possible to divide the housing at a different location.<br>
The invention is not limited to the illustrated and described embodiments but can be modified in various ways. For example, the possibility of achieving acoustic tuning by cooperation of the parts of the capsule with the parts of the device into which the capsule is introduced, which makes the friction pill unnecessary, has not been discussed.<br>
The employed materials and technologies are unchanged relative to the prior art so that a person skilled in the art, in knowledge of the invention, will encounter no problems in realizing the invention.<br>
Forming of the shoulder can be realized depending on the type of manufacture and material of the capsule or the capsule part which supports the shoulder. The drawings are not to scale so as to provide an easily recognizable illustration; reference is being had to the conventional dimensions of miniaturized capsules which, for example, have a total height and outer diameter of only a few millimeters, respectively.<br>
In the case of the divided capsule housing, the connection between the two parts is possible in many different ways.  All those connection are conceivable which are sufficiently stable, including frictional engagement as well as screwing or gluing.<br>
While specific embodiments of the invention have been shown and described in detail to illustrate the inventive principles, it will be understood that the invention may be embodied otherwise without departing from such principles.s<br><br><br><br><br>
