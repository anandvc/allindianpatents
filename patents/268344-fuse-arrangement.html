Fuse arrangement<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a fuse arrangement according<br>
to the precharacterizing clause of claim 1.<br>
DE 10 2005 009 235.7 has disclosed a fuse arrangement<br>
in which each fuse is accommodated within a cylindrical<br>
container, a sealing body being provided so as to seal<br>
off the cylinder body, which sealing body is pressed<br>
into the interior of the insulating body by a sealing<br>
head, with a plate spring interposed.<br>
Each fuse has, as is described in the German patent<br>
application, a tripping bar, which moves outwards when<br>
the fuse responds and in this way actuates a tripping<br>
mechanism.<br>
The object of the invention is to specify a tripping<br>
mechanism which has a very simple design.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by<br>
the features of claim 1.<br>
Therefore according to the invention a twin-armed lever<br>
is mounted on the sealing head, one arm of said twin-<br>
armed lever covering the tripping bar of the fuse and<br>
its other arm unlatching a tripping mechanism, with<br>
which a circuit breaker can be driven.<br>
As can be gleaned from the abovementioned patent<br>
application, two fuses are arranged one above the<br>
other, with the result that their mid-axes cover a<br>
vertical plane with one another.<br><br>
WO 2006/111339	PCT/EP2006/003501<br>
- 2 -<br>
Parallel to the vertical plane, a transmission rod is<br>
mounted such that it can rotate about its vertical<br>
axis, pins being arranged on said transmission rod<br>
which protrude at right angles thereto and interact<br>
with the second lever arm of the twin-armed lever, with<br>
the result that the transmission rod is rotated when<br>
the tripping bar is moved out.<br>
If the fuses are arranged at the corner of a triangle,<br>
a further transmission rod is located on the opposite<br>
side, which transmission rod is coupled to	the twin-armed lever of the adjacent fuse in such a	way that the further transmission rod is rotated when	the tripping bar is moved out.<br>
In accordance with a further embodiment of the<br>
invention, in each case one arm is fixed on the<br>
transmission rods so as to protrude radially, the free<br>
ends of said arm being coupled to one another by a<br>
coupling rod, which can be displaced by in each case<br>
one arm during the tripping operation; the latching<br>
point of the tripping mechanism is then coupled to the<br>
coupling rod via an intermediate element.<br>
The invention and further advantageous configurations<br>
and improvements and further advantages will be<br>
explained and described in more detail with reference<br>
to the drawing, in which an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
invention is illustrated and in which<br>
the single figure shows a perspective plan view of a<br>
fuse arrangement for an electrical<br>
switchgear assembly with a tripping<br>
mechanism.<br>
In figure 5 of DE 10 2005 009 235.7, which has already<br>
been mentioned above, a holding plate 100 for mounting<br>
the sealing head 43 is provided for each fuse, with<br><br>
WO 2006/111339	PCT/EP2006/003501<br>
- 3 -<br>
which holding plate the sealing head (the sealing head<br>
41 according to the abovementioned DE 10 2005 009<br>
235.7), which is not illustrated in the single figure<br>
here, is pressed into the interior of each fuse<br>
container 30. In this context, reference is made to<br>
DE 10 2005 009 235.7.<br>
In the embodiment according to the present invention,<br>
three fuses 30, 231 and 232 are provided corresponding<br>
to the number of phases, the mid-axes of said fuses<br>
running horizontally and being arranged at the corners<br>
of a triangle. In this case, the fuses 30, 232 are<br>
located one above the other in a vertical plane,<br>
whereas the third fuse 231 is positioned at the apex of<br>
the triangle, of which the plane of the two fuses 30,<br>
232	forms the base.<br>
The sealing heads 43, 233 and 234 are in the form of<br>
pots, the base of each sealing head being directed<br>
towards the fuse container 30, 231, 232.<br>
Mounted in the walls 24 7, 24 8 of the sealing heads 43,<br>
233	which lie one above the other are twin-armed levers<br>
249 and 250, which pass through an opening (not given a<br>
designation) in the walls 43, 233. The inner arm 251<br>
and 252 covers the respective tripping bar (not<br>
illustrated here) of the fuse and the arms 253 and 254,<br>
which are located outside of the walls 43, 233, are<br>
bent back approximately in the form of an L and<br>
interact with pins 255 and 256, which are fixed on a<br>
first transmission rod 257 so as to protrude radially.<br>
Mounted on the sealing head 234, which is likewise in<br>
the form of a pot, is likewise a twin-armed lever 258,<br>
whose one lever arm 259 engages over the tripping bar<br>
of the fuse 231, whereas the other arm 260 is bent back<br>
in the same way as the arms 253 and 254, the arm 260<br><br>
WO 2006/111333	PCT/EP2006/003501<br>
- 4 -<br>
interacting with a radially protruding pin 261 on a<br>
second transmission rod 262.<br>
The twin-armed levers 249, 250 and 258 run horizontally<br>
and can be pivoted in each case about a vertically<br>
running axis in the walls of the sealing heads. The<br>
transmission rod 257 is located on one side of the<br>
triangle, outside the triangle, parallel to the base of<br>
the triangle, whereas the other transmission rod 262 is<br>
arranged on the opposite side, i.e. the apex side of<br>
the triangle. The two transmission rods 257 and 262 run<br>
at right angles and in a plane, which runs parallel to<br>
the plane of the plate 100.<br>
Lever arms 263 and 264, whose free ends are coupled by<br>
a coupling rod 265, are fixed at the upper ends of the<br>
transmission rods 257 and 262, the coupling rod 265<br>
running at an angle with respect to the plane in which<br>
the transmission rods 25 7 and 262 are located. In this<br>
case, the free end of the lever arm 2 63 points away<br>
from the plate 100; the free end of the lever arm 264<br>
points towards the plate 100 with the result that the<br>
end of the coupling rod, which is connected to the arm<br>
264, has a shorter distance than the other end of the<br>
coupling rod 265, which is connected to the arm 263.<br>
The free ends of the lever arms 263 and 264 are coupled<br>
to one another1 via a slot 266 and 267, the coupling<br>
bolts (no reference numerals) in the tripping-ready<br>
position shown in figure 1 bearing against one end of<br>
the slots.<br>
If the fuse 231 should now respond, the twin-armed<br>
lever 258 actuates the transmission rod 262 via the pin<br>
261 in the clockwise direction, as a result of which<br>
the lever arm 264 -pivots and exerts a force on the<br>
coupling rod 265 so as to displace it, the coupling rod<br>
265 being freely movable owing to the slot 266. On the<br><br>
WO 2005/111339	PCT/EP2006/003501<br>
- 5 -<br>
other hand, if, owing to the response of the fuse 30,<br>
the transmission rod located on the left-hand side in<br>
the drawing is pivoted counter to the clockwise<br>
direction, the lever arm 263 displaces the coupling rod<br>
265, and the Coupling rod 265 can move freely, i.e.<br>
independently of the position of the transmission rod<br>
262, owing to the slot 267.<br>
Connected to the coupling rod 265 is a Bowden cable<br>
268, via which the movement Of the coupling rod acts on<br>
a tripping element 269 in the latching point of a<br>
switching mechanism.<br>
An indicating rod 270 is fixed to the coupling rod 265,<br>
and an indicating lug 271 is fixed to its free end,<br>
which indicating lug 271 indicates the switching<br>
position or the tripping position of the fuses, i.e.<br>
indicates whether a fuse has responded.<br>
As an indication that the abovementioned German patent<br>
application is to a certain extent the basis for the<br>
present patent application, the reference numerals 43,<br>
30, 100 have been selected to be the same.<br>
In addition it is also mentioned that the transmission<br>
rods 257 and 262 are axially undisplaceable, but are<br>
mounted such that they can rotate about their<br>
vertically running mid-axis.<br><br>
