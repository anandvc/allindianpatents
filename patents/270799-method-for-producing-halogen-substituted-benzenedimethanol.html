benzenedimethanol, US 6759558 discloses a method comprising<br>
reacting 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthalic acid with sodium<br>
borohydride followed by reacting with an alkylating agent,<br>
sulfuric acid, an alkyl sulfonic acid or an aryl sulfonic<br>
acid.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a method for producing<br>
a halogen-substituted benzenedimethanol represented by the<br>
formula (2):<br><br><br>
wherein X1, X2, X3 and X4 are the same or different and each<br>
independently represent a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom,<br>
provided that X1, X2, X3 and X4 are not hydrogen atoms at<br>
the same time,<br>
by reacting a halogen-substituted terephthalic acid<br>
represented by the formula (1):<br><br>
wherein X1, X2, X3 and X4 are the same meanings as defined<br>
above,<br>
with a borohydride compound in an organic solvent, followed<br>
by contacting the obtained reaction mixture with hydrogen<br>
chloride at 40 to 70°C.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Present Invention<br>
In the halogen-substituted terephthalic acid<br>
represented by the formula (1), examples of the halogen<br>
atom represented by X1, X2, X3 and X4 include a fluorine<br>
atom, a chlorine atom and a bromine atom. X1, X2, X3 and X4<br><br>
are preferably fluorine atoms.<br>
Examples of the halogen-substituted terephthalic acid<br>
represented by the formula (1) include 2-fluoroterephthalic<br>
acid, 2-chloroterephthalic acid, 2,5-difluoroterephthalic<br>
acid, 2,6-difluoroterephthalic acid, 2,3-<br>
difluoroterephthalic acid, 2,5-dichloroterephthalic acid,<br>
2,6-dichloroterephthalic acid, 2,3-dichloroterephthalic<br>
acid, 2,3,5-trifluoroterephthalic acid, 2,3,5-<br>
trichloroterephthalic acid, 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthalic<br>
acid, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalic acid and 2,3,5-<br>
trifluoro-6-chloroterephthalic acid.<br>
The halogen-substituted terephthalic acid represented<br>
by the formula (1) can be produced, for example, according<br>
to a known method such as a method comprising hydrolyzing<br>
the corresponding halogen-substituted terephthalonitrile<br>
(e.g. US 5792887).<br>
Examples of the borohydride compound include an alkali<br>
metal borohydride such as sodium borohydride, lithium<br>
borohydride and potassium borohydride; and an alkaline<br>
earth metal borohydride such as calcium borohydride and<br>
magnesium borohydride. In the view of availability, the<br>
alkali metal borohydride is preferable and sodium<br>
borohydride is more preferable.<br>
While a commercially available borohydride compound is<br>
usually used, those prepared according to a known method<br><br>
may be used. For example, sodium borohydride can be<br>
prepared easily from a boric acid ester and sodium hydride.<br>
Alternatively, other borohydride compounds can be prepared<br>
by a reaction of sodium borohydride and the corresponding<br>
metal halide, and for example, calcium borohydride is<br>
obtained by a reaction of sodium borohydride and calcium<br>
chloride. When the borohydride compound is prepared to use,<br>
those previously prepared may be added to the reaction<br>
system and it may be prepared in the reaction system.<br>
The used amount of the borohydride compound is usually<br>
1 mole or more per 1 mole of the halogen-substituted<br>
terephthalic acid represented by the formula (1). While<br>
there is no specific upper limit, in the viewpoint of<br>
economic efficiency, it is practically 5 moles or less and<br>
preferably 2 to 3 moles of less.<br>
Examples of the organic solvent include ether solvents<br>
such as diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diisopropyl ether and<br>
dimethoxyethane, and aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as<br>
toluene, xylene and chlorobenzene, and ether solvents are<br>
preferable, and dimethoxyethane is more preferable. While<br>
the used amount of the organic solvent is not particularly<br>
limited, it is usually 1 to 100 parts by weight per 1 part<br>
by weight of the halogen-substituted terephthalic acid<br>
represented by the formula (1).<br><br>
The reaction temperature is usually -20 to 200°C, and<br>
preferably 0 to 100°C.<br>
The reaction of the halogen-substituted terephthalic<br>
acid represented by the formula (1) and the borohydride<br>
compound is conducted by mixing the organic solvent, the<br>
halogen-substituted terephthalic acid represented by the<br>
formula (1) and the borohydride compound. The mixing order<br>
is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include a<br>
method comprising adding the halogen-substituted<br>
terephthalic acid represented by the formula (1) or a<br>
mixture of the halogen-substituted terephthalic acid<br>
represented by the formula (1) and the organic solvent into<br>
a mixture of the organic solvent and the borohydride<br>
compound.<br>
The reaction time is usually 0.5 to 24 hours.<br>
While the reaction is usually carried out at normal<br>
pressure, it may be carried out under pressure. The<br>
progress of the reaction can be checked by a conventional<br>
analytical means such as gas chromatography and high<br>
performance liquid chromatography.<br>
The desired halogen-substituted benzenedimethanol<br>
represented by the formula (2) can be obtained by<br>
contacting the reaction mixture obtained in the reaction of<br>
the halogen-substituted terephthalic acid represented by<br>
the formula (1) and the borohydride compound with hydrogen<br><br>
chloride at 40 to 70°C.<br>
As hydrogen chloride, hydrogen chloride gas,<br>
hydrochloric acid and an organic solvent solution of<br>
hydrogen chloride can be used, and in the viewpoint of<br>
operability and availability, hydrochloric acid is<br>
preferable. A commercially available hydrochloric acid may<br>
be used as it is and may be mixed with an inert gas on the<br>
reaction, an organic solvent, water or the like to use.<br>
When hydrochloric acid is used, one having high<br>
concentration of hydrogen chloride is preferably used and<br>
concentrated hydrochloric acid is more preferable.<br>
Examples of the organic solvent solution of hydrogen<br>
chloride include hydrogen chloride/dioxane solution,<br>
hydrogen chloride/tetrahydrofuran solution and hydrogen<br>
chloride/dimethoxyethane solution.<br>
The used amount of hydrogen chloride is usually 1 mole<br>
or more per 1 mole of the borohydride compound used in the<br>
above-mentioned reaction of the halogen-substituted<br>
terephthalic acid represented by the formula (1) and the<br>
borohydride compound. While there is no upper limit<br>
particularly, it is practically 10 moles or less in view of<br>
economic aspect and volume efficiency.<br>
The contact of the reaction mixture obtained in the<br>
above-mentioned reaction of the halogen-substituted<br>
terephthalic acid represented by the formula (1) and the<br><br>
borohydride compound with hydrogen chloride is conducted,<br>
for example, by a method comprising adding hydrogen<br>
chloride into the reaction mixture adjusted at 40 to 70°C.<br>
The reaction mixture may be used as it is and after adding<br>
the above-mentioned ether solvent and the above-mentioned<br>
aromatic hydrocarbon solvent thereto.<br>
The contact time of the reaction mixture and hydrogen<br>
chloride is usually 0.5 to 24 hours.<br>
While the contact of the reaction mixture and hydrogen<br>
chloride is carried out at normal pressure, it may be<br>
carried out under pressure. The progress of the reaction<br>
can be checked by a conventional analytical means such as<br>
gas chromatography and high performance liquid<br>
chromatography.<br>
After completion of the reaction, the halogen-<br>
substituted benzenedimethanol represented by the formula<br>
(2) can be isolated by, if necessary adding water or a<br>
water-insoluble solvent, conducting extraction and<br>
concentrating the obtained organic layer. The isolated<br>
halogen-substituted benzenedimethanol represented by the<br>
formula (2) may be further purified by a conventional<br>
purification means such as recrystallization and column<br>
chromatography.<br>
Examples of thus obtained halogen-substituted<br>
benzenedimethanol represented by the formula (2) include 2-<br><br>
fluoro-1,4-benzendimethanol, 2-chloro-1,4-benzendimethanol,<br>
2,5-difluoro-1,4-benzendimethanol, 2,6-difluoro-1,4-<br>
benzendimethanol, 2,3-difluoro-1,4-benzendimethanol, 2,5-<br>
dichloro-1,4-benzendimethanol, 2,6-dichloro-l,4-<br>
benzendimethanol, 2,3-dichloro-l,4-benzendimethanol, 2,3,5-<br>
trifluoro-1,4-benzendimethanol, 2,3,5-trichloro-1,4-<br>
benzendimethanol, 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzendimethanol,<br>
2,3,5,6-tetrachlorobenzendimethanol and 2,3,5-trifluoro-6-<br>
chlorobenzendimethanol.<br>
Examples<br>
The present invention will be illustrated in more<br>
detail by Examples below. The present invention is not<br>
limited to these Examples. The analysis was conducted by<br>
high performance liquid chromatography absolute calibration<br>
method.<br>
Example 1<br>
Into a 200 ml flask, 2.58 g of sodium borohydride and<br>
25 g of dimethoxyethane were charged at room temperature<br>
and the obtained mixture was heated to 50°C. A mixed<br>
solution of 6.1 g of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthalic acid<br>
and 20 g of dimethoxyethane was added dropwise to the<br>
mixture over 1 hour while stirring at the same temperature<br>
to effect the reaction for 7 hours at 60°C. After adding<br><br>
20 g of toluene to the reaction mixture and cooling the<br>
obtained mixture at 50°C, 8.5 g of 35% by weight aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid was added thereto dropwise over 1 hour<br>
and the resultant mixture was stirred and kept for 6 hours<br>
at 60°C. To the obtained mixture, 30 g of water was added.<br>
After leaving the mixture at rest, the mixture was<br>
separated to an organic layer and an aqueous layer. The<br>
aqueous layer was extracted twice with 30 g of ethyl<br>
acetate and the obtained oil layers were mixed with the<br>
organic layer previously obtained. The organic layer after<br>
mixing was washed with 10 g of a saturated potassium<br>
carbonate and then 10 g of water, and the organic layer was<br>
concentrated to obtain the solid. The solid was<br>
recrystallized with toluene and hexane to obtain 5.35 g of<br>
a white powder solid containing 2,3,5,6-<br>
tetrafluorobenzenedimethanol. The purity of 2,3,5,6-<br>
tetrafluorobenzenedimethanol was 95.1% and the yield<br>
thereof was 95%.<br>
Example 2<br>
Into a 200 ml flask, 2.3 g of sodium borohydride and<br>
25 g of dimethoxyethane were charged at room temperature<br>
and the obtained mixture was heated to 50°C. A mixed<br>
solution of 6.1 g of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthalic acid<br>
and 30 g of dimethoxyethane was added dropwise to the<br><br>
mixture over 1 hour while stirring at the same temperature<br>
to effect the reaction for 2 hours at 60°C. To the<br>
reaction mixture, 15.5 g of 14% by weight hydrogen<br>
chloride/dioxane solution was added dropwise over 3 hours,<br>
and then the resultant mixture was stirred and kept at the<br>
same temperature for 5 hours. After cooling the obtained<br>
mixture at 25°C, 30 g of 5% by weight hydrochloric acid was<br>
added thereto and the mixture was separated to an organic<br>
layer and an aqueous layer. The aqueous layer was<br>
extracted twice with 30 g of toluene and the obtained oil<br>
layers were mixed with the organic layer previously<br>
obtained. The organic layer after mixing was washed with<br>
10 g of water, and the organic layer was concentrated to<br>
obtain the solid. The solid was recrystallized with<br>
toluene and hexane to obtain 5.6 g of a white powder solid<br>
containing 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzenedimethanol. The<br>
purity of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzenedimethanol was 87.0%<br>
and the yield thereof was 90%.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
Into a 200 ml flask, 2.58 g of sodium borohydride and<br>
25 g of dimethoxyethane were charged at room temperature<br>
and the obtained mixture was heated to 50°C. A mixed<br>
solution of 6.1 g of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthalic acid<br>
and 20 g of dimethoxyethane was added dropwise to the<br><br>
mixture over 1 hour while stirring at the same temperature<br>
to effect the reaction for 7 hours at 60°C. After adding<br>
25 g of toluene to the reaction mixture and cooling the<br>
obtained mixture at 25°C, 8.5 g of 35% by weight aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid was added thereto dropwise over 1 hour at<br>
25 to 30°C and the resultant mixture was stirred and kept<br>
for 6 hours at 25 to 30°C. To the obtained mixture, 30 g<br>
of water was added. After leaving the mixture at rest, the<br>
mixture was separated to an organic layer and an aqueous<br>
layer. The aqueous layer was extracted twice with 30 g of<br>
ethyl acetate and the obtained oil layers were mixed with<br>
the organic layer previously obtained. The organic layer<br>
after mixing was washed with 10 g of a saturated potassium<br>
carbonate and then 10 g of water, and the organic layer was<br>
concentrated to obtain the solid containing 2,3,5,6-<br>
tetrafluorobenzenedimethanol. The yield of 2,3,5,6-<br>
tetrafluorobenzenedimethanol was 33%. Alternatively, 4-<br>
carboxy-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzyl alcohol was formed as by-<br>
products in the yield of 29%, and a raw material 2,3,5,6-<br>
