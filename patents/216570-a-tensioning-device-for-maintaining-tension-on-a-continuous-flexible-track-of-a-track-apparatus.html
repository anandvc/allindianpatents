COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A tensioning device for maintaining tension on a continuous flexible<br>
track of a track apparatus"<br>
AGTRACKS, INC., a US company of 204A Main Street, Mt. Vernon, IN 47620, United States of America.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to track apparatus for vehicles and, in particular, to apparatus for maintaining proper tension on flexible tracks during operation of tracked vehicles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Agricultural vehicles such as tractors, combines and the like are commonly used in agricultural fields for a variety of jobs. Typically, these agricultural vehicles incorporate tires on which the vehicles are supported. Since these types of large agricultural vehicles are quite heavy, the weight of agricultural vehicles are distributed to a relatively small area on the tires of the vehicles. As a result, the tires on the agricultural vehicles tend to compact the soil in the fields. Compacted soil discourages the growth of crops planted in the fields which need loose soil to flourish.<br>
In addition, since agricultural fields are often wet due to rain or watering, agricultural vehicles which enter the fields become bogged down in the mud due to the fact that there is such a small area of the tire in contact with the soil. As such, it is highly desirable to develop a track system for vehicles which disburses the weight of the agricultural vehicle over a larger area so as to reduce the compaction of the soil in the agricultural fields and to provide a track with a larger surface area which contacts the soil so as to prevent the agricultural vehicle from becoming bogged down in mud in the fields.<br>
A prior track system for vehicles is disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,452,949 (Kelderman), assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference. The Kelderman '949 patent discloses a track suspension system for a vehicle having a frame and a continuous track. The drive wheel is attached to the frame for engaging and driving the continuous flexible track. The drive wheel has a plurality of drive projections disposed thereon which engage depressions in the rubber track. As the drive wheel rotates, it engages and drives the continuous flexible track.<br><br>
In order to insure proper operation of a prior art track system, the tension on the flexible track must be maintained within a predetermined range. By way of example, a minimum tension must be maintained on the flexible track to prevent slippage thereof during operation of the track system. As is known, slippage of the flexible track reduces the efficiency of a track system and increases the likelihood of premature wear of the flexible track. Similarly, excessive tension on the flexible track may result in the premature wearing thereof and loss of horsepower. Therefore, it is highly desirable to provide a track system which incorporates a tensioning devise that maintains the proper tension on the flexible track thereof during operation of the track system.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, it is a primary object and feature of the present invention to provide a track apparatus incorporating a tensioning device for maintaining a predetermined tension on a continuous flexible track thereof during use.<br>
It is a further object and feature of the present invention to provide a track apparatus incorporating a tensioning device which discourages slippage of a continuous flexible track during extended use thereof.<br>
It is a still further object and feature of the present invention to provide a track apparatus incorporating a tensioning device for maintaining a predetermined tension on a continuous flexible track thereof during use which is inexpensive to manufacture, simple to utilize and independent of the vehicle.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a tensioning device is provided for maintaining the tension on a continuous flexible track of a track apparatus. The flexible track has upper and lower lengths and an inner surface. The track apparatus includes a frame; a drive wheel structure rotatably mounted with respect to the frame which has an upper circumferential portion engaging the inner surface of the flexible<br><br>
track along the upper length and a lower circumferential portion spaced above the lower track length; and an idler assembly having an idler wheel engaging the track. The tensioning device includes a cylinder housing interconnected to the frame. The cylinder housing extends along an axis and defines a chamber therein. A,piston has a first end pivotably connected to the idler wheel and a second end slidably received within the chamber of the cylinder housing. The piston is movable between a first retracted position and a second extended position. A first dampening structure discourages movement of the piston towards the retracted position for a first predetermined axial length. A second dampening structure discourages movement of the piston towards the retracted position for a second predetermined axial length. The first dampening structure includes a first dampening cylinder which extends along an axis and defines a chamber therein. A first dampening piston is slidably received within the first dampening cylinder and is movable axially between a first position and a second position. The. first dampening piston divides the chamber  of the first dampening cylinder into a first portion for receiving a pressurized gas and a second portion. A fluid conduit interconnects the second portion of the chamber in the first dampening cylinder and the chamber of the cylinder housingv A fluid is disposed within the second portion of the chamber in the first dampening cylinder the chamber of the cylinder housing; and the fluid conduit therebetween.

mounting ears 140a and 140b, respectively, are axially aligned. Piston shaft mounting<br>
ears 140a and 140b define a piston receipt cavity 146 therebetween for receiving<br>
terminal end 148 of piston shaft 139. As best seen in FIGURES 6-8, terminal end 148<br>
of piston shaft 139 includes an opening 150 for receiving mounting pin 144 such that<br>
piston shaft 139 of cylinder 142 may pivot on mounting pin 144.<br><br>
Referring to FIGURES 6-8, piston shaft 139 includes a second opposite end<br>
154 received within chamber 156 within cylinder housing 158 of cylinder 142.<br>
Cylinder housing 158 includes a first open end 159 for allowing piston shaft 139 to be<br>
inserted within chamber 156 and an opposite closed end 160. Inner surface 162 of<br>
cylinder housing 158 forms a slidable interface with the outer surface 164 of piston<br>
shaft 139. Closed end 160 of cylinder housing 158 includes a dog ear having an<br>
opening 166 passing therethrough. Closed end 160 of cylinder housing 158 is<br>
positioned between mounting flanges 95 and 97 such that opening 166 in closed end<br>
160 is aligned with openings 95a and 97a in mounting flanges 95 and 97, respectively.<br>
Pin 168 extends through openings 95a and 97a in mounting flanges 95 and 97,<br><br><br>
respectively, and through opening 166 in closed end 160 of cylinder housing 158 so as to pivotally connect cylinder 142 to frame 34.<br>
Referring once again to FIGURES 6-8, chamber 156 within cylindrical housing 158 communicates with input 169 of manifold 170 through conduit 172. As best seen in FIGURES 4, 13 and 14, conduit 172 extends through opening 174 in lower panel 53 of side portion 36 of frame 34 and through opening 176 in upper panel 48 of side portion 36 of frame 34. In a preferred embodiment, manifold 170 is mounted to upper surface 178 of upper panel 48. Manifold 170 includes a first output 180 operatively connected to the input 182 of low pressure cylinder 184 and a second output 186 operatively connected to the input 188 of high pressure cylinder 190. Seals 192 are provided between the outputs 180 and 186 of manifold 170 and the inputs 182 and 188 of cylinders 184 and 190, respectively, to maintain the integrity of the connections therebetween.<br>
Cylinder! 84 includes an inner surface 194 defining a'chamber 196 therein. A piston 198 is slidably received within chamber 196 so as to divide chamber 196 into a first portion 196a for receiving low pressure nitrogen gas therein and a second portion 196b which communicates with chamber 156 within cylinder housing 158 through manifold 170 and conduit 172. A generally tubular limiter member 200 is positioned within chamber 196. Limiter member 200 includes an outer surface 202 which engages the inner surface 194 of cylinder 184. Limiter member 200 limits movement of piston 198 such that piston 198 is slidable between a first position, FIGURE 6, and a second position, FIGURES 7 and 8.<br>
[Cylinder 190 includes an inner surface 204 defining a chamber 206 therein. A piston 208 is slidably received within chamber 206 so as to divide chamber 206 into a first portion 206a for receiving a high pressure nitrogen gas therein and a second portion 206b which communicates with chamber 156 within cylinder housing 158 through manifold 170 and conduit 172. It is contemplated to provide a fluid within chamber 156 of cylinder housing 158, conduit 172, manifold 170, and second portions<br><br>
196b and 206b of chambers 196 and 206, respectively, in cylinders 184 and 190,<br>
respectively.	<br>
As described, as piston shaft 139 moves into chamber 156 of cylinder housing 158, from left to right in FIGURES 6-8, fluid is urged from chamber 156 through conduit 172 into manifold 170. Given that the first portion 196a of chamber 196 of cylinder 184 is filled with a low pressure nitrogen gas and that the first portion 206a of  chamber 206 of cylinder 190 is filled with a high pressure nitrogen gas, the fluid within manifold 170 will take the path of least resistance and urge piston 198 within chamber 196 from right to left in FIGURES 6-8 against the bias of the low-pressure nitrogen gas in first portion 196a of chamber 196 in cylinder 184. Travel of piston 198 within chamber 196 is terminated when piston 198 engages limiter member 200, FIGURE 7, which corresponds to a predetermined distance X which piston shaft 139 is inserted into chamber 156 of cylinder housing 158, FIGURE 9. Thereafter, as piston shaft 139 is further inserted into chamber 156 of cylinder housing 158, the fluid within manifold 170 will attempt to urge piston 208 against the force of the high pressure nitrogen gas present in first portion 206a of chamber 206 of second cylinder 190, FIGURE 9.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 9, as described, the amount of force necessary to insert piston shaft 139 a predetermined distance within chamber 156 of cylinder housing 158 gradually increases from an initial value A to an increased value A' as the low pressure nitrogen gas is compressed in first portion 196a of chamber 196 in cylinder 184 by piston 198 being urged from the first to the second position by the fluid. Thereafter, the amount of force necessary to further insert piston shaft 139 a second predetermined distance Y-X within/chamber 156 of cylinder housing 158 gradually increases from an initial value B to an increased value B'. Since the nitrogen gas within cylinder 190 is under greater pressure than the nitrogen gas within/cylinder 184, a substantially greater force is required for piston shaft 139 to travel the predetermined distance Y-X than the initial predetermined distance X.<br><br>
In operation, track system 10 is mounted to an axle of a vehicle through drive wheel 12 as heretofore described. The axle of the vehicle is rotated in a conventional manner through the vehicle by its engine and through a transmission which can vary the speeds and allow for forward and reverse rotation. Flexible track 15 of track apparatus 10 is positioned over drive wheel 12 such that lugs 32 projecting from the inner surface 28 of flexible track 15 are received between corresponding pairs of drive lugs 30 projecting from outer surface 29 of outer rim 24 of drive wheel 12. It is intended terminal end surface 32a of such lugs 32 engage outer surface 29 of outer rim 24 of drive wheel in order that lugs 32 are supported when driven by drive wheel 12, thereby minimizing the possible twisting and turning of lugs 32, and hence, damage to lugs 32 during operation of track system 10. As drive wheel 12 rotates, drive lugs 30 engage corresponding lugs 32 and drive flexible track 15 about drive wheel 12. Thereafter, successive drive lugs 30 engage subsequent lugs 32 extending from the inner surface 28 of flexible track 15 so as to drive flexible track 15 about drive wheel 12.<br>
As flexible track 15 approaches leading idler wheels 137, lugs 32 pass therebetween. In addition, the radially outer surfaces 137a of leading idler wheels 137 engage the inner surface 28 of flexible track 15 and direct the lower length of flexible track 15 into contact with a supporting surface such as a farmer's field. As flexible track 15 continues to be driven about drive wheel 12, lugs 32 pass between the pairs of leading and trailing bogie wheels 101 and 107, respectively. As previously described, the radially outer surfaces 101a and 107a of bogie wheels 101 and 107, respectively, engage the inner surface 28 of flexible track 15 along its lower length and insure contact of flexible track 15 with the supporting surface along the lower length of flexible track 15. Similarly, as flexible track 15 approaches trailing idler wheels 117, lugs 32 on the inner surface 28 of flexible track 15 pass therebetween. The radially outer surfaces 117a of idler wheels 117 engage the inner surface 28 of flexible track 15 and guide flexible track 15 onto drive wheel 12 to form a continuous loop.<br><br>
It is contemplated as being within the scope of the present invention to rotate drive wheel 12 in a second, opposite direction such that trailing idler wheels 117 may function as leading idler wheels, and such that leading idler wheels 137 may function as trailing idler wheels as heretofore described.<br>
In order to maintain the proper tension on flexible track 15 so as to prevent slippage of flexible track during travel about drive wheel 12, piston shaft 139 of cylinder 142 is provided. It is heretofore described, the nitrogen gas in the first portions 196a and 206a of chambers 196 and 206, respectively, of corresponding cylinders 184 and 190, respectively, urge corresponding pistons 198 and 208 towards the first position. As a result, the fluid in chamber 156 of cylinder housing 158 urges piston shaft 139 therefrom. Piston shaft 139, in turn, urges the outer surfaces 137a of leading idler wheels 137 into contact with the inner surface 28 of flexible track 15 through connection with leading idler axle support 130 so as to maintain proper tension on flexible track 15.<br>
In the event that flexible track 15 engages an obstruction on the supporting surface during operation of track system 10, such obstruction may cause flexible track 15 to deflect thereby causing leading idler axle support 130 to pivot on mounting pin 132 and to urge piston shaft 139 into chamber 156 of cylinder housing 158 through leading idler wheels 137 and leading idler axle 136. The amount of force necessary to insert the piston shaft 139 into chamber 156 of cylinder housing 158 (in other words, the amount of force necessary to allow flexible track 15 to deflect) gradually increases as piston shaft 139 is further inserted into chamber 156, as heretofore described. Once track system 10 clears the obstruction, the piston shaft 139 is urged back into its original position by the nitrogen gas in first portions 196a and 206a of chambers 196 and 206, respectively, in corresponding cylinders 184 and 190, respectively, so as to once again provide the proper tension on flexible track 15.<br>
As described, the structure of track system 10 allows for deflection of the flexible track in response to obstructions or the like while maintaining the proper tension thereon. It can be appreciated that the tension on the flexible track may be<br><br>
adjusted by varying the pressure of the nitrogen gas in first portions 196a and 206a of chambers 196 and 206, respectively, in corresponding cylinders 184 and 190, respectively, and/or by varying the position of limiter member 200.<br>
