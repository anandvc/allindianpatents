CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Serial No, J J/520,336 filed September 12, 2006.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates reclining mechanisms for vehicle seating assemblies, more specifically to manually operated reclining mechanisms.<br>
2.	Background Art<br>
Vehicle seats normally include a seat base and a seat back, Reclining mechanisms may be provided for vehicle seats that allow the seats to be positiioned to accommodate different body types and the personal comfort of seat occupants. Reclining mechanisms for vehicle seats permit the seat back to pivot to allow a passenger to recline or incline the seat.<br>
Manually operated reclining mechanisms have a locked position in wliich the seat back cannot pivot and an unlocked position in which the seat back can be pivoted. The mechanism is moved from a locked position to an unlocked position when a user manually operates a reclining mechamsm. The mechanism is returned to a locked position after the user finishes adjusting the reclining mechanism. In the locked poshion, full engagement of the reclining mechanism must be assured.<br>
Reclining mechanisms must meet or exceed performance specifications and must be simple for customers to use.    The components of<br><br>
reclining mechanisms must be manufactured to close tolerances to assure acceptable performance. Components that do not meet tolerances requirements for components may lead ro inconsistent results, unacceptable levels of scrap, and other manufacturing problems.<br>
The present invention is directed to overcoming the above problems and other problems that are addressed by the embodiments that are summarized below.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

The pivotal plate is provided with at least two internal gear segments. A cam is provided with at least two cam pawls and two lock elements that cooperate with the guide plate and the cam. The lock elements each have a radially outwardly oriented gear segment that reflectively engages one of the internal gear segments. Each of the lock elements have an engagement element that cooperates with the cam pawl. The cam is rotated to cause the cam pawls to contact the engagement elements of the lock elements to unlock each of the external gear segments from the internal gear segments. Springs are provided that cooperate with the guide plate and the cam to urge the cam to translate the external gear segments into engagement with the internal gear segments. A bushing cooperates with the cam to assure rotation about the pivotal axis. The bushing is configured to receive a shaft that connects one of the reclining mechanisms to a second reclining mechanism.<br>
A shaft is provided that engages the bushings of the pair of reclining mechanisms to force cooperation between the pair of reclining mechanisms. The bushings are rotated when the shaft is manually rotated which causes each of the cams to rotate. Rotation of the cams causes each of the cam pawls to engage the engagement elements at one contact point. The engagement elements are rotated to pull the lock elements inwardly to unlock the pivotal plates. The pivotal plates, when unlocked, may be pivoted relative to the guide plates.<br>
A seat assembly for use in a vehicle is provided with a seat bottom, a seat back, a pair of reclining mechanisms and a shaft. Each of the reclining mechanisms has a guide plate that is adapted to be secured to the seat bottom and a pivotal plate that is adapted to be secured to the scat back which is pivotally connected to the guide plate about a pivotal axis. Each pivotal plate is provided witli two internal gear segments. A cam is provided that has at least two cam pawls. Two lock elements are moved by the cam relative to the guide plate. The lock elements each have an external gear segment that faces radially outwardly to cooperate with one of the internal gear segments. The cam engages each lock element at two contact points to drive the external gear segments into the internal<br><br>
gear segments when the pair of reclining mechanisms is in a locked position. The lock elements each have an engagement element that cooperates with the cam pawl. The cams rotate to cause the cam pawls to engage the engagement elements at one contact point to move the lock elements. The cam rotation unlocks each of the external gear segments from the internal gear segments. Two springs cooperate with the guide plate and the cam to urge the cam to move the external gear segments into engagement with the internal gear segments.<br>
A shaft may engage the bushings of the reclining mechanisms to link the pair of reclining mechanisms. The bushings rotate when the shaft is manually rotated which causes each of the cams to rotate. The cam pawls each engage one of the engagement elements to pull the lock elements and unlock the pivotal plates. Unlocking the pivotal plates allows each of the pivotal plates to move allowing the seat back to be inclined or reclined.<br>
A reclining mechanism is provided for a vehicle seat that has a guide plate that is adapted to be secured to one of a seat bottom or a seat back and a pivotal plate that is adapted to be secured to the other of the seat bottom or seat back. The pivotal plate is pivotally connected to the guide plate about a pivotal axis. The pivotal plate is provided with two internal gear segments. A cam is provided that is pivotaliy connected to the pivotal plate. The cam provides at least two cam pawls. Two lock elements cooperate with the guide plate and the cam for movement relative to the guide plate. The lock elements each have a radially outwardly oriented external gear segment that cooperates with one of the internal gear segments. The lock elements each have an engagement element that cooperates with the cam pawl. The cam rotates to cause each of the cam pawls to engage one of the engagement elements to move the lock elements radially inwardly. This inward movement unlocks each of the external gear segments from one of the internal gear segments. Two springs cooperate with the guide plate and the cam to urge the cam to translate the external gear segments into engagement with the internal gear segments.<br><br>
The reclining mechanism may move from an unlocked position to a locked position such that the cam contacts the lock element at only one contact point. The cam urges the lock element radially outward at the only one contact point until the external gear segments are partially engaged with the internal gear segments.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Detailed embodiments are disclosed below but it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely examples of the invention that may be embodied in various and alternative forms. The figures are not necessarily to scale; some features may be exaggerated or minimized to show details of particular components. The specific structural and functional details are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a representative basis for the claims and to teach one skilled in the art to practice the invention.<br>
Referring now to Figure 1, a seat assembly is illustrated and referenced generally by numeral 20. The seat assembly 20 includes a horizontal seat bonom 22. The seat assembly 20 also includes an upright seat back 24. A pair of reclining mechanisms 26 connect the seat bottom 22 to the seat back 24. The reclining mechanisms 26 are connected together by a shaft 28. The shaft 28 links<br><br>
the reclining mechanisms 26 to lock or unlock the scat back 24 relative to Che seat bottom 22.<br>
In one embodiment, the reclining mechanisms 26 each have a guide plate 30, which connects the reclining mechanism 26 to the seat bottom 22. Two connectors 31 link the guide plate 30 to the seat bottom 22. Any suitable means of connecting the guide plate 30 to the seat bottom 22 is contemplated within the scope of the present invention such as a mechanical fastener to a seat frame.<br>
The reclining mechanisms 26 have a pivotal plate 32 connecting the reclining mechanism 26 to the seat back 24. The pivotal plate 32 is connected to the seat back 24 by two connectors 33, Any suitable means of connecting the pivotal plate 32 to the seat back 24 is contemplated within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The guide plate 30 is pivotally connected to the pivotal plate 32 at the pivotal axis 34. The pivotal axis 34 may be generally in the center of the guide plate 30 and the pivotal plate 32. The shaft 28 extends along the pivotal axis 34 and rotates about the pivotal axis 34. The pivotal plate 30 rotates about the pivotal axis 34 and guides rotation the seat back 24 about the pivotal axis 34 to recline or incline.<br>
The reclining mechanism 26 may have a bias spring 35 on the shaft 28. The bias spring 35 locks shaft 28 from rotating until a user raises the lever 36. A user may raise the lever 36 in one direction to overcome the force of the bias spring 35 allowing the shaft 28 to rotate about the pivotal axis 34.<br>
With reference now to Figure 2, the reclining mechanism 26 is generally housed within the guide plate 30 and the pivotal plate 32. A bushing 38 is connected to the guide plate 30. The bushing 38 is sized to receive a shaft, such as the shaft 28 illustrated in Figure 1, and may be secured to the pivotal plate 32 by the clip 40. In one embodiment as illustrated in Figure 13, neither the bushing 38 nor the clip 40 extend beyond the outside housing of the pivotal plate 32.<br><br>
As shown in Figure 2, the cam 42 has a central bore sized to receive the bushing 38. A partial clearance may exist between the outer diameter of the bushing 38 and the inner diameter of the cam 42. When the bushing 38 rotates about the pivotal axis 34, the bushing 38 rotates the cam 42 due to a corresponding splined configuration.<br>
The cam 42 rotates two lock elements 44. The lock elements 44 are positioned opposite each other about the pivotal axis 34. The guide plate 30 guides the lock elements 44 in radial movement. When an outer end 45 of one of the lock elements abuts the pivotal plate 32, the pivotal plate 32 cannot rotate about the pivotal axis 34. When the outer end 45 does not contact the pivotal plate 32, the pivotal plate rotates about the pivotal axis 34. The outer ends 45 of the lock elements 44 have an external gear segment 58. As shown in Figure 14, the external gear segment on the outer end 45 engages with the interna! gear segment provided on the inside of the pivotal plate 32.<br>
The cam 42 has a cam pawl 46 and the lock elements 44 have an associated lock pawl 48. When the cam pawl 46 does not engage the lock pawl 48, the cam 42 drives the lock element 44 outward at two contact points so that the outer end 45 contacts the pivotal plate 32. When the cam 42 rotates counterclockwise about the pivotal axis 34, illustrated sequentially in Figures 4, 7 and 10, the cam pawl 46 hooks the lock pawl 48 at one contact point, to pull the lock element 44 toward the pivotal axis 34. Pulling the lock element 44 toward the pivotal axis 34 forces the outer end of the lock element 45 out of contact with the pivotal plate 32. The pivotal plate 32 and the associated seat back 24 may rotate about the pivotal axis 34 when the lock element 45 is disengaged from the pivotal plate.<br>
A pair of torsion springs 50 are connected to the guide plate 38 and tlie cam 42, The springs 50 cause the cam 42 to contact the lock elements 44 at two points and bias the lock elements 44 radially outward and into engagement with pivotal plate 32.<br><br>
With reference to Figures 2 and 3, retainers 52, 68 connect the guide plaie 30 and the pivotal plate 32 while allowing the pivotal plate 32 to rotate about the pivotal axis 34 while restricting movement in a transverse direction. At least a first retainer 52 provided through the pivotal plate 32 has a larger portion which overlaps along a peripheral arcuate segment 64 of the guide plate 30 to support the guide plate 30. At least a second retainer 68 provided through the guide plate 30 has a larger portion which overlaps along a peripheral arcuate segment 66 of the pivotal plate 32. The retainers 52, 68 allow limited rotation of the guide plate 30 relative to pivotal plate 32 about the pivotal axis 34.<br>
As illustrated in Figures 1 and 3, guide plate holes 54 on the guide plate 30 allow the guide plate 30 to be connected to a seat bottom 22 by connectors<br>
31.	Pivotal plate holes 56 are provided on the pivotal plate 32, The pivotal plate<br>
holes 56 allow coimection of the pivotal plate 32 to a seat back 24 by connectors 33.<br>
The number of guide plate holes 54 and pivotal plate holes illustrated here is not a<br>
limitation, as any number of holes is contemplated within the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to Figure 3, the guide plate 30 is connected to the pivotal plate 32 by a bushing 38 that extends through the guide plate 30 and the pivotal plate<br>
32.	Retainers 52, 68 movably support the guide plate 30 and the pivotal plate 32,<br>
With reference to Figure 4, the guide plate 30 is shown with the bushing 38 connected to the cam 42. The cam 42 contacts the lock elements 44 at two locations to drive or push the lock elements 44 outward into a locked position.<br>
In Figure 5, the cam pawl 46 and the lock pawl 48 are not engaged and the reclining mechanism 26 is locked. The cam 42 contacts the lock elements 44 at two contact points 49 to drive or push the lock elements 44 outward into the locked position. The two contact points 49 may be as far from the center of the lock element 44 as possible to help stabilize the reclining mechanism 26. Clearance 47 is provided between the cam pawl 46 and the lock element 44.<br><br>
Referring to Figure 6, a partial internal gear segment 60 fully engages an external gear segment 58. As shown in Figure 5, the two contact points 49 between the cam 42 and the lock element 44 drive the gear segments 58, 60 into fall engagement as illustrated in Figure 6.<br>
With reference to Figure 7, an intermediate position or transitional position is illustrated. When the reclining mechanism 26 moves from the locked to unlocked position or from the unlocked to locked position, the cam 42 engages the lock element 44 at a single point 51 and the cam 42 urges the lock element 44 radially outward at the only one contact point 51 until the external gear segments 58 are partially engaged with the internal gear segments 60 as illustrated in Figure 9.<br>
As shown in greater detail in Figure 8, the cam pawl 46 and the lock pawl 48 contact at the point 51 in which the reclining mechanism 26 is in the intermediate or transitional position. In this position, two clearances 53 are created between the cam 42 and the lock element 44. The contact point 51 is the single point of contact between the cam 42 and the lock clement 44 in the intermediate position.<br>
In Figure 9, an internal gear segment 60 partially engages the externa! gear segment 58. The gear segments 58, 60 may be driven into further engagement as shown in Figure 6 or pulled into disengagement as shown in Figure 12 from the intermediate position.<br>
Referring to Figure 10, the bushing 38 is connected to the cam 42 and the cam 42 is shown full engaging the lock element 44. The outer end of the lock clement 45 does not abut the pivotal plate 32, allowing the pivotal plate 32 to rotate. The lock element 45 is pulled radially inward unlocking the pivotal plate 32 and the reclining mechanism 26. The cam 42 contacts the lock element 44 only at the cam pawl 46 and locking pawl 48 in the unlocked position. Full engagement between the cam pawl 46 and the lock pawl 48 pulls the lock element 45 radially inward unlocking the gear segments 58, 60, as in Figure 12 described below.<br><br>
With reference to Figure 11, the cam pawl 46 fully engages the lock pawl 48 unlocking the reclining mechanism. Two clearances 53 are provided between the cam 42 and the lock element 44 of Figure 10,<br>
Referring to Figure 12, a partial internal gear segment 60 is fully disengaged from the external gear segment 58 unlocking the reclining mechanism an allowing rotation of the reclining mechanism.<br>
With reference to Figure 13, the reclining mechanism 26 is illustrated in cross-section to the shaft 28 in connection with the bushing 38, The bushing 38 is secured on one side against the guide plate 30 by a shoulder or step 39. The outer end of the bushing 38 may be secured to the reclining mechanism 26 by a retaining clip 40. Neither the bushing 38 nor the clip 40 extends beyond the outer profile 41 of the reclining mechanism 26. The guide plate 30 and the pivotal plate 32 may be oppositely oriented so that the bushing 38 may be mounted to the pivotal plate 32.<br>
Referring to Figure 14, a partially assembled reclining mechanism 26 is shown. The outer end of the lock elements 45 have an external gear segment 58 that interacts with an internal gear segment 60 of the pivotal plate 32. The internal gear segment 60 of the pivotal plate 32 is on the inside lip 62 of the pivotal plate 32. When the lock clement 45 engages the pivotal plate 32, the pivotal plate 32 does not rotate.<br>
While embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it is not intended that these embodhnents illustrate and describe all possible forms of the invention. Rather, the words used in the specification are words of description rather than limitation, and it is understood that various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
