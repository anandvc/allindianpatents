				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of the racemic or optically active (2-halogenphenyl) (6,7,-dihydro-4H-tieno[3,2-c] pyridin-5-yl)acetic acid methyl esters of the general formula (VI):<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
It is known that methyl (2-halogenophenyl)-(6,7-dihydro-4H-thieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5-yl)acetates and their salts can favourably be used in the treatment, first of all owing to their platelet-aggregation-inhibitory and antithrombotic effects.<br>
An especially favourable representative of these compounds, falling<br>
under general formula (VI)- wherein X means chloro atom-, is the dextrorotatory<br>
methyl	(+)-[(S)-(2-chlorophenyl)-(6,7-dihydro-4H-thieno[3,2-c]pyridin-5-<br>
yl)acetate hydrogen sulfate], with the international non-proprietary name (INN) clopidogrel (European patent application, Publication Nr. 099802).<br>
Large-scale preparation of compounds of general formula (VI)- wherein X means halogen atom- was earlier feasible only through the strongly lacrimatory and mucous membrane irritant a-halogenophenylacetic acid derivatives, which are difficult to handle during the technology and which are unfavourable from the view of health and environment (European patent applications, Publication Nos. 099802, 0420706, 0466569). Furthermore, yields of the known methods are rather poor.<br>
Our aim was to eliminate the use of the above unpleasant intermediates (such as for instance a-bromo-(2-chlorophenyl)acetic acid and its methyl ester) and to enhance substantially the yield of compounds of general formula (VI) in the synthesis.<br>
Since in the synthesis according to our present invention each intermediate is chiral, in the preparation of an optically active end-product, as for instance clopidogrel, the possibility is open to use- from the first step on-<br>
optically active compounds as intermediates. The economical benefit of the method is among others the avoidance of preparation of an unwanted isomer.<br>
We have found that preparing the compounds of general formula (VI) by the route shown on scheme 1., the use of the unpleasant intermediates can be avoided, and in addition, the yield of the synthesis is much higher. The subject of the present invention is the third section of reaction scheme 1. The optically active compounds of general formula (VI) are prepared either from the optically active compounds of general formula (VII), or starting from the optically active intermediates obtained by resolving the intermediates of general formula (VIII), or by resolving the racemic compounds of general formula (VI).<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of the racemic or optically active (2-halogenphenyl) (6,7,-dihydro-4H-tieno[3,2-c] pyridin-5-yl)acetic acid methyl esters of the general formula (VI)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein X is halogen atom - or their salts, wherein a racemic or optically active new [2-(2-thienyl) ethylamino] (2-halophenyl) actamide of general formula (VII)-<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein X is halogen atom-is uransiormea wiin metnanoi in tne presence of 0,1-6 molequivalents of methyl hydrogen sulphate at a temperature between 50°C and 150°C into a racemic or optically active methyl[2-(2-thienyl) ethylamino] (2-halophenyl) acetate of general formula (VIII)-<br>
optically active compounds as intermediates. The economical benefit of the method is among others the avoidance of preparation of an unwanted isorner.<br>

Dextrorotatory [2-(2-thienyl)ethylamino](2-chlorophenyl)acetamide 38 g (0.129 mol) of racemic [2-(2-thienyl)ethylamino](2-chlorophenyl)acetamide is dissolved at 50 °C in 380 ml of isopropanol containing 0-0,4, advantageously 0,2% of water and to this solution is added the 50 °C solution of 10,6 g (0,071 mol) of L(+)-tartaric acid in 230 ml of isopropanol, containing 0-0,4%, advantageously 0,2% of water. The mixture is stirred at 50 °C for 30 minutes. Thick, white precipitate is formed. To the mixture 3,4 ml (0,09 mol) of formic acid is added and stirring is continued at 50 °C for 1 hour. The reaction mixture is then cooled to room temperature, stirred for another hour and the solid phase is filtered off. The precipitated material is the salt formed between the laevorotatory enantiomer of the starting material and L(+)-tartaric acid, in an optically slightly<br>
contaminated form. Weight: 30 g. Mp.: 167 - 169 °C, after crystallization from ethanol. The mother liquor is evaporated in vacuo. The residue ( 29 g) is taken up in 200 ml of water and 200 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane and neutralized under stirring with 16 g (0.19 mol) of sodium hydrogen carbonate. The phases are separated, the aqueous layer is washed with 2x30 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane, the combined organic layer is extracted with 50 ml of water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated in vacuo. Weight: 18 g. The raw product is recrystallized from 70 ml of ethanol, washed with a small amount of ethanol and dried. Weight: 12.6 g. Mp.: 122 - 124 °C, [α]22D = + 69 °(c = 1, methanol). Yield: 66,3% calculated on the dextrorotatory enantiomer content of the starting material. Optical purity: 99 -100%, usually higher than 98% (determined by HPLC).<br>
The product was identified by elementary analysis, IR spectrum and 1H-NMR investigation. By concentration of the filtrate 4 g of racemic starting material can be recovered.<br>
Example 17.<br>
Dextrorotatory [2-(2-thienyl)ethylamino](2-chlorophenyl)acetamide<br>
76 g (0,257 mol) of racemic [2-(2-thienyl)ethylamino](2-chlorophenyl)acetamide<br>

solution 21.2 g (0,141 mol) of L(+)-tartaric acid and 8,3 g (0.18 mol) of formic<br>
acid are added. The mixture is stirred at 50°C for 1 hour while thick white<br>
precipitate is formed. The reaction mixture is then cooled to room temperature<br>
during a period of 1 hour, stirred for another 2 hours and the solid phase is filtered<br>
off.<br>
The precipitated material is the salt formed between the laevorotatory enantiomer<br>
of the starting material and L(+)-tartaric acid is an optically slightly contaminated<br>
form. Weight: 57 g. Mp.: 167-169°C after crystallisation from ethanol.<br>
After filtration of the former solid material 5.2 g (0.141 mol) hydrochloric acid gas<br>
is introduced into the filtrate to precipitate the hydrochloride of the product. The<br>
formed white crystallized material is filtered out and dried. Weight: 41.7 g.<br>
The obtained optically slightly contaminated salt is taken up in 100 ml of ethanol and 5.3 g (0.13 mol) of sodium hydroxide dissolved in 70 ml of ethanol is added into it gradually to release the free base.

camphorsulfonate is suspended in 700 ml of acetone while heating under reflux<br>
conditions, and to achieve full dissolution 300 ml of methyl ethyl ketone is added.<br>
The mixture is allowed to cool down to room temperature. The resulting precipitate<br>
is separated and treated at room temperature with 500 ml of acetone and 300 ml of<br>
