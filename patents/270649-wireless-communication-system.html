				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a wireless communication<br>
system.<br>
Background Art<br>
A mobile communication system for assigning transmission<br>
using a scheduler as an HSDPA system standardized in a 3GPP has<br>
been partially put to practical use.<br>
Described below is an example of an HSDPA system for<br>
performing a high-speed downlink transmission using an example<br>
of the configuration of a terminal and an example of a<br>
configuration of a base station.<br>
FIGS. 1 through 5 are explanatory views of a conventional<br>
HSDPA system.<br>
In the terminal illustrated in FIG. 1, for example, a<br>
wireless channel quality measurement/calculation unit 13<br>
measures and calculates a wireless channel quality indicator<br>
(hereinafter referred to as a CQI (channel quality indicator))<br>
according to the pilot signal of a downlink signal received<br>
through an antenna 10, a radio unit 11, and a<br>
demodulation/decoding unit 12. As a practical example, an SIR<br>
is calculated by measuring the reception power and interference<br>
power of the pilot signal. The CQI value is assembled into a<br>
transmitting signal by a wireless channel quality indicator<br>
transmission unit 14, encoded and modulated by a<br>
coding/modulation unit 15, and transmitted to a base station<br>
on an uplink wireless channel through the antenna 10.<br>
On the other hand, the base station illustrated in FIG.<br>
2 receives a signal carrying the CQI value transmitted from a<br>
terminal through an antenna 20, a radio unit 21, and a<br>
demodulation/decoding unit 22, collects a wireless channel<br><br>
quality indicator (CQI), and notifies a scheduler 24 of the<br>
indicator. The scheduler 24 calculates the priority of the<br>
terminal for each available frequency band using the wireless<br>
channel quality indicator (hereinafter referred to as a CQI<br>
(channel quality indicator) reported from the terminal, and<br>
selects a transmission parameter on a higher priority basis.<br>
A control signal generation unit 25 generates a transmitting<br>
control signal, and transmits the signal to a terminal through<br>
a coding/modulation unit 27, a radio unit 28, and the antenna<br>
20. The transmission data of a transmission data buffer 26 is<br>
transmitted to a terminal after the control signal is<br>
transmitted.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of a scheduling process.<br>
Assume that there are terminals UEl through UEn in the<br>
cell of a base station. In step S10, the CQI values (CQI1<br>
through CQIn) of the terminals UEl through UEn are received.<br>
In step Sll, the CQI1 through CQIn are stored. In step S12,<br>
a TTI is initialized. A TTI is short for a transmission time<br>
interval, and refers to a transmission interval of the data to<br>
a terminal. In this example, it is used as a variable indicating<br>
a transmission frequency. In step S13, the TTI is increased<br>
by 1. In step S14, the priority Pk of the terminal UEk is<br>
calculated. In step S15, the system is initialized to i=0, j = l.<br>
In step S16, the wireless resources Ri is calculated. With i=0,<br>
the wireless resources have not been assigned. Therefore, Ri<br>
refers to the entire wireless resources. In step S17, if is<br>
determined whether or not the wireless resources Ri is smaller<br>
than 0. If the determination in step S17 is YES, control is<br>
passed to step S21. If the determination in step S17 is NO,<br>
the terminal UEj having the priority Pk of the maximum value<br>
Pk_max is calculated from the n-i terminals in step S18. In<br>
step S19, the method of transmitting data (data length,<br>
modulation system, etc.) to the terminal UEj is selected. In<br>
step S20, i is increased by 1, j is increased by 1, and control<br>
is returned to step S16. In step S21, the transmitting method<br><br>
selected in step S19 is modulated as a control signal, and the<br>
result is transmitted to the terminal. In step S22, the<br>
transmission data is modulated for the terminal to which the<br>
control signal has been transmitted, transmits the result to<br>
the terminal, and control is returned to step S13.<br>
As a method of calculating the priority, the MAX CIR method<br>
of selecting a larger CQI value, and the PF (proportional<br>
fairness) method of selecting a larger CQI and performing a<br>
selection for equal opportunity.<br>
In the above-mentioned 3GPP, the specification of the E3G<br>
(evolved 3G) system is inspected as a next generation mobile<br>
communication system. In this respect, the implementation of<br>
the OFDMA system and the SC-FDMA system are studied respectively<br>
for downstream and upstream as a multi-connection method.<br>
In addition, in the E3G system, a scheduling process is<br>
performed as with the HSDPA system using the frequency band<br>
broader than the conventional HSDPA (for example, four times).<br>
Furthermore, the terminal used in the E3G system has different<br>
bandwidths between upstream and downstream. Additionally, in<br>
the downstream, the available bands by terminals depend on each<br>
terminal, for example, 1.25 MHz, 2.5 MHz, 5 MHz,10 MHz, 20 MHz,<br>
etc.<br>
Therefore, it is necessary to perform a scheduling<br>
process at the system band of 20 MHz by considering the available<br>
bandwidth.<br>
That is, as illustrated in FIG. 4, it is necessary to<br>
perform the scheduling process on the entire system using one<br>
scheduler.<br>
Furthermore, assume that the downlink system bandwidth<br>
is 20 MHz, and the downlink bandwidth of a terminal is 5 MHz.<br>
At this time, the frequency used during operation is variable<br>
with the relationship with other terminals taken into account,<br>
and there are four options. Therefore, to allow the scheduler<br>
of a base station to select the optimum band from among a<br>
plurality of bands with the available bandwidths by other<br><br>
terminals taken into account, the CQI is measured and calculated<br>
for every 5 MHz band at a terminal as illustrated in FIG. 5,<br>
and the result is to be reported to the base station.<br>
That is, four times as much as the measurement and<br>
calculation are required as compared with the HSDPA system. In<br>
addition, the frequency of reporting the CQIs to the base<br>
stations quadruples. As a result, the interference of the<br>
up-channel also quadruples.<br>
In the E3G system, when the entire system is scheduled<br>
by one scheduler,<br>
When simply compared with the scheduler of the<br>
conventional HSDPA system, the number of terminals to be<br>
scheduled is multiplied (for example, quadrupled).<br>
• As compared with the transmission interval of 2 msec<br>
of the conventional HSDPA system, the interval is 1/4, that is,<br>
0.5 msec.<br>
For the two above-mentioned reasons, for example, 16<br>
times scheduling speed as fast as the conventional system is<br>
demanded. That is, the priority calculation time is to be set<br>
to 1/16.<br>
On the other hand, the improvement of the performance of<br>
the process of the CPU and the DSP for performing the scheduling<br>
process approximately quadruples on the basis of the reference<br>
of year 2010 as the target of starting the service of the E3G,<br>
which is far from the above-mentioned 16 times with the Moore's<br>
Law (double process speed in 18 months) taken into account.<br>
Therefore, it is inevitable that the scheduling process<br>
is performed at a higher speed.<br>
The patent document 1 discloses the technology of<br>
grouping and scheduling terminals moving at a high speed.<br>
Furthermore, it specifies the bands to be scheduled. It is<br>
assumed that they are based on the HSUPA (high speed uplink<br>
packet access) of the 3GPP. However, in the descriptions, a<br>
terminal moving at a low speed or during halts is not scheduled.<br>
The patent document 2 discloses an example using an OFCDM<br><br>
(orthogonal frequency and code division multiplexing). That<br>
is, a spreading process is performed in the frequency and time<br>
directions, and then a multiplexing operation is performed.<br>
The patent document 3 groups the terminals using the<br>
amount of attenuation of transmission power. Since there are<br>
no descriptions about available frequency bands, it is<br>
considered that the conventional OFDM is used.<br>
The patent document 4 discloses a base station detecting<br>
the moving speed of a mobile station using a Doppler frequency,<br>
and optimally selecting a coding rate and a modulation system.<br>
The patent document 5 discloses optimally determining the<br>
transmission rate of the communications of a mobile station and<br>
a base station according to the information about the Doppler<br>
frequency etc. of a mobile station.<br>
The patent document 6 discloses grouping a subcarrier,<br>
acquiring channel quality information for each group, and<br>
transmitting and receiving the information.<br>

Best: Mode for Carrying Out: the Invention<br>
Described below is a downlink transmission as an example.<br>
FIG. 6 is a sequence of the flow of the process according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In FIG. 6, a terminal measures the wireless channel<br>
quality for each frequency band (1) . That is, an SIR is<br>
calculated from received data, and a CQI value is obtained on<br>
the basis of the calculated SIR. The measured wireless channel<br>
quality is notified to a base station (2) . The base station<br>
determines the available frequency band by the terminal from<br>
the information about the received wireless channel quality (3) ,<br>
and classifies all terminals that have transmitted the wireless<br>
channel quality into groups (4) . When the grouping process is<br>
completed, the base station notifies each terminal of the<br>
terminal group to which the terminal belongs (5) . Upon receipt<br>
of the terminal group notification, the terminal sets an<br>
available frequency band and the terminal group (6). The<br>
terminal measures the wireless channel quality at the available<br>
frequency bands set for the terminal (7) , and notifies the base<br>
station of the measurement result (8) . The base station<br>
performs a scheduling process for each available frequency band<br>
on the basis of the notified wireless channel quality. That<br><br>
is, the base station selects a technique for transmission on<br>
the basis of the priority of the terminal, and selects a<br>
transmitting method. Then, it generates control information<br>
to be received by the terminal (9), notifies the terminal of<br>
the transmission control information (10), and then transmits<br>
data (11).<br>
Thus, in the OFDMA system and the MC-CDMA system,<br>
terminals are grouped depending on the possible available<br>
bandwidths and the available frequencies. The grouping<br>
process can be performed when a wireless channel is set, or can<br>
be performed at predetermined intervals after setting the<br>
wireless channel. The information for the grouping process can<br>
be a possible available bandwidth of a terminal, the channel<br>
quality of each band, the use of a channel (load) of each band,<br>
etc.<br>
FIG. 7 is an explanatory view illustrating the case in<br>
which a grouping operation is performed in the easiest method<br>
on a basis of channel quality of each band during channel<br>
setting.<br>
Practically, assume a case in which a terminal has the<br>
maximum possible available bandwidth of 5 MHz, and the bandwidth<br>
of the system of 20 MHz. When a characteristic is set, the<br>
terminal measures the wireless channel quality for each band<br>
obtained by dividing the system band of 20 MHz by the maximum<br>
possible available bandwidth of 5 MHz, calculates a wireless<br>
channel quality indicator (1), and notifies the base station<br>
of the calculated indicator (2) . The base station (or a<br>
wireless channel control station) determines the available<br>
frequencies on the basis of the information and the possible<br>
available bandwidth about the terminal (3), divides the<br>
terminal for each available bandwidth and available frequencies,<br>
and performs the grouping process (4) . It is also possible to<br>
determine the available frequencies by considering the channel<br>
load between the frequencies that can be accommodated.<br>
FIG. 7 is substantially the same as FIG. 6, but the<br><br>
available frequency bands and the terminal group are set when<br>
a channel is set, and the wireless channel quality of the<br>
available frequency bands of each terminal is measured by each<br>
terminal in a normal state, and the base station performs the<br>
scheduling process on the basis of the reported wireless channel<br>
quality, and starts communications. The operation in the<br>
normal state is the same as in FIG. 6, and the description is<br>
omitted here.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates an image of measuring wireless channel<br>
quality for each available band.<br>
As described above, the terminal for which a terminal<br>
group is determined measures the channel quality only for the<br>
determined available frequencies, calculate the CQI, and<br>
reports the results to the base station.<br>
Thus, the number of CQI reports decreases, thereby<br>
reducing the uplink interference.<br>
The base station that has received the CQI classifies the<br>
CQI for each group of the terminal, and performs the scheduling<br>
process for each terminal group (each available frequency band) .<br>
Thus, since the number of terminals to be scheduled decreases,<br>
the computational complexity in calculating a priority of the<br>
terminal in the scheduling process is reduced, thereby speeding<br>
up the entire process. Furthermore, since the scheduling<br>
process is performed on each terminal group, the entire process<br>
can be furthermore sped up by concurrently operating a plurality<br>
of schedulers.<br>
FIGS. 9 and 10 are explanatory views of the method of<br>
grouping and scheduling a terminal.<br>
In FIGS. 9 and 10, the band of the system is 20 MHz, the<br>
available bandwidth of the terminal is 5 MHz, and the terminals<br>
UE 100 through 139 are classified into four groups. Using a<br>
frequency band 1, a group 1 is scheduled by a scheduler 1 in<br>
the four schedulers. Similarly, a group 2 is assigned a band<br>
2 and a scheduler 2, a group 3 is assigned a band 3 and a scheduler<br>
3, and a group 4 is assigned a band 4 and a scheduler 4. They<br><br>
are illustrated by (a) in FIG. 10. Since the data transmission<br>
interval is 0.5 ms, the scheduling process of each group is<br>
performed every 0.5 ms.<br>
Thus, when a plurality of schedulers are provided, one<br>
scheduler is assigned to each terminal group. That is, the<br>
group 1 is scheduled by, for example, the scheduler 1, and the<br>
group 2 is scheduled by the scheduler 2. The scheduling<br>
processes can be concurrently performed as illustrated by (b)<br>
in FIG. 10.<br>
FIG. 11 is an explanatory view (1) of an image of grouping<br>
and scheduling methods when the available bandwidth of a<br>
terminal is different from that illustrated in FIG. 10.<br>
In FIG. 11, the available bandwidth of the terminal is<br>
10 MHz, and there are a group 5 scheduled by a scheduler 5 using<br>
bands 1 and 2, and a group 6 scheduled by a scheduler 6 using<br>
the bands 3 and 4.<br>
FIGS. 12 and 13 are explanatory view of hierarchical<br>
grouping.<br>
As described above, the possible available bandwidth by<br>
a terminal depends on the performance of a terminal. Therefore,<br>
there can be a method of performing a grouping process on the<br>
basis of a possible available bandwidth. In the case<br>
illustrated in FIG. 12, the terminals UE 160 through 169 capable<br>
of using 20 MHz are classified into a group 7, and scheduled<br>
by a scheduler 7. On the other hand, the terminals UE 14 0<br>
through 149, and the UE 150 through 159 having the available<br>
band of 10 MHz are respectively classified into the group 5<br>
scheduled by the scheduler 5 using the bands 1 and 2 and the<br>
group 6 scheduled by the scheduler 6 using the bands 3 and 4.<br>
The terminals UE 100 through 109, UE 110 through 119, UE 120<br>
through 129, and UE 130 through 139 having the available band<br>
of 5 MHz are respectively classified into the group 1 scheduled<br>
by the scheduler 1 using the band 1, the group 2 scheduled by<br>
the scheduler 2 using the band 2, the group 3 scheduled by the<br>
scheduler 3 using the band 3, and the group 4 scheduled by the<br><br>
scheduler 4 using the band 4.<br>
As illustrated by (a) and (b) in FIG. 13, it is assumed<br>
that all of the possible available bands are used, and that,<br>
for example, a group having a broad loop such as 10 MHz as a<br>
possible available band is defined as a higher order group, and<br>
a group having a narrow loop such as 5 MHz as a possible available<br>
band is defined as a lower order group. At this time, the<br>
scheduling process is performed from the higher order group to<br>
the lower order group.<br>
As illustrated by (a) in FIG. 13, the group 7 is first<br>
scheduled every 0.5 ms as the transmission time of each piece<br>
of data, and then the groups 5 and 6, and finally the groups<br>
1 through 4 are scheduled. Part (b) in FIG. 13 illustrates the<br>
image of hierarchical scheduling. The scheduling process is<br>
performed sequentially and hierarchically from the scheduler<br>
7. Since the two schedulers, that is, the schedulers 5 and 6,<br>
and the four schedulers, that is, the schedulers 1 through 4,<br>
are concurrently operated, the scheduling processes can be<br>
expected to be sped up.<br>
FIG. 14 illustrates an example of a grouping table of a<br>
base station when a terminal is grouped.<br>
Corresponding to each terminal group number, the central<br>
frequency of the available band of each group, the bandwidth,<br>
and the identification number of the terminal belonging to each<br>
group is entered.<br>
FIG. 15 is an explanatory view of other grouping methods.<br>
The necessary transmission speed depends on the data to<br>
be transmitted. Therefore, the necessary bandwidth depends on<br>
the data. That is, QoS may need an available broad bandwidth,<br>
or an available narrow bandwidth. Furthermore, if a<br>
transmission can be performed by narrowing the bandwidth for<br>
the relationship with other terminals although a necessary<br>
transmission speed cannot be satisfied, the transmission can<br>
be performed. Therefore, when the possible available<br>
bandwidth of a terminal is 20 MHz, it cannot only belong to the<br><br>
terminal group of 20 MHz, but also belong to the terminal group<br>
of a narrower bandwidth such as 10 MHz, 5 MHz, etc. Therefore,<br>
the terminal group is hierarchically defined in the descending<br>
order of size of the available bandwidth. In FIG. 15, the<br>
terminal having the available band of 20 MHz can perform<br>
communications at 10 MHz and 5 MHz. In addition, the terminal<br>
having the available band of 10 MHz can also perform<br>
communications at 5 MHz. The terminals UE 160 through 169<br>
having the available band of 20 MHz not only belong to the group<br>
7 scheduled by the scheduler 7, but also belong to all groups<br>
1 through 6. Accordingly, when the terminals UE 160 through<br>
169 cannot use the band of 20 MHz, they can be assigned to the<br>
group 5 or 6 having the band of 10 MHz. When they cannot also<br>
use the band of 10 MHz, they can be assigned to any of the groups<br>
1 through 4 of the band of 5 MHz. Thus, the possibility that<br>
the terminals UE 160 through 169 cannot perform communications<br>
can be reduced. Similarly, the terminals UE 140 through 149<br>
and UE 150 through 159 having the available band of 10 MHz can<br>
also be assigned to the groups 1 through 4 so that communications<br>
can also be performed at 5 MHz when the communications cannot<br>
be performed at the band of 10 MHz. Since the terminals UE 100<br>
through 109, UE 110 through 119, UE 120 through 129, and UE 130<br>
through 139 belong only to the groups 1 through 4 because there<br>
is no available band lower than 5 MHz.<br>
The scheduling process is performed from a higher order<br>
group (for example, 2 0 MHz) to a lower order group (for example,<br>
5 MHz) . Thus, the number of terminals to be scheduled in a group<br>
can be reduced, and the priority calculating process can also<br>
be reduced, thereby speeding up the entire scheduling process.<br>
FIG. 16 illustrates an example of a grouping table of a<br>
base station for the grouping operation illustrated in FIG. 15.<br>
The central frequency of the available band of each group,<br>
the bandwidth, and the identification numbers of the terminals<br>
belonging to each group are entered in the table corresponding<br>
to each of the terminal group numbers 1 through 7.<br><br>
As with the case illustrated in FIG. 14, when a plurality<br>
of schedulers are provided, the number of schedulers are to be<br>
equal to the number of groups. By providing a scheduler for<br>
each group and concurrently and hierarchically operating the<br>
plurality of schedulers, the scheduling process can be sped up.<br>
In addition, the plurality of schedulers can be replaced with<br>
one scheduler capable of performing concurrent operations.<br>
FIGS. 17 through 21 are views of examples of the process<br>
when a terminal is grouped.<br>
In the example illustrated in FIG. 17, in step S30, the<br>
maximum possible available bandwidth of a target terminal is<br>
confirmed. In step S31, the CQI of each band is received from<br>
the terminal. In step S32, the available band is selected from<br>
the maximum value of the CQI. In step S33, a terminal group<br>
corresponding to the selected band is selected.<br>
In the example illustrated in FIG. 18, the maximum<br>
possible available bandwidth of a target terminal is confirmed<br>
in step S35, and the CQI of each band is received in step S36.<br>
In step S37, the available band is selected from the CQI and<br>
the use state of each band, and in step S38, a terminal group<br>
is selected. The use state of each band refers to the number<br>
of terminals already assigned to each band, etc. When the<br>
number of terminals assigned to a certain band becomes too large,<br>
the frequency of the selection by the scheduler is reduced and<br>
the transmission speed becomes lower. In this case, performed<br>
is the process of selecting the band of the second largest CQI,<br>
not the band of the largest CQI, etc.<br>
In the example illustrated in FIG. 19, the maximum<br>
possible available bandwidth of a target terminal is confirmed<br>
in step S40. In step S41, the bandwidth and the CQI for each<br>
band are received from the terminal. In step S42, the available<br>
bandwidth and the available band are selected from the maximum<br>
value of the CQI. In step S43, a terminal group is selected.<br>
In FIG. 19, the terminal can use a plurality of available bands.<br>
For example, when the system band is 20 MHz and the available<br><br>
band of the terminal is 10 MHz, the terminal can use 10 MHz and<br>
5 MHz. Therefore, the terminal measures the CQIs of two bands<br>
having a 10 MHz width and four bands having a 5 MHz, and the<br>
base station selects the available band from the measurement<br>
results.<br>
In the example illustrated in FIG. 20, for example, assume<br>
the case in which the GBR (guaranteed bit rate) of the QoS is<br>
set. That is, assume the case in which a service of the<br>
regulated lowest transmission speed is set. For example,<br>
assume that the possible transmission speed is 3 Mbps with the<br>
band of 5 MHz, the modulation system of the QPSK, and at the<br>
coding rate of 1/3. At this time, when the GBR of a terminal<br>
is 5 Mbps, it is necessary to have the bandwidth of 10 MHz to<br>
satisfy the GBR. Therefore, the terminal is assigned to the<br>
group having the available bandwidth of 10 MHz. The modulation<br>
system can be a QPSK, and a multivalue modulation system of 16<br>
QAM, 64 QAM, etc. , the coding rate can be variable, and the MIMO<br>
function can be used.<br>
In step S45, the maximum possible available bandwidth of<br>
a target terminal is confirmed. In step S46, the QoS of<br>
transmission data to the target terminal is confirmed. In step<br>
S47, the necessary bandwidth is calculated. In step S48, the<br>
CQI for each band of the necessary bandwidth is received from<br>
the terminal. In step S49, the available bandwidth is selected<br>
from the maximum value of the CQI, the possible available<br>
bandwidth, and the necessary bandwidth. InstepS50, a terminal<br>
group is selected.<br>
In the example illustrated in FIG. 21, the degradation<br>
of the transmission characteristic by the movement of a terminal<br>
is considered. That is, the Doppler frequency is determined<br>
by the moving speed of the terminal, and the level of the<br>
degradation of the transmission characteristic is determined<br>
by the Doppler frequency. Since the Doppler frequency is<br>
enhanced with increasing available frequencies, it is desired<br>
to use a lower frequency in the communications with the terminal<br><br>
to correspond to a high-speed movement.<br>
Then, for example, when the system bandwidth is 20 MHz,<br>
and the central frequency is fl<f2 in fig. a higher></f2>
frequency band (central frequencies f3, f4, and f6) is defined<br>
for a high-speed movement terminal while a lower frequency band<br>
(fl, f2, and f5) is defined for a low-speed movement or suspended<br>
terminal.<br>
Prior to grouping a terminal, the terminal or the base<br>
station estimates the moving speed of the terminal. An<br>
estimating method can be realized by, for example, measuring<br>
the interval (fading pitch) of a drop of the intensity of a<br>
reception electric field by fading. The result is compared with<br>
the threshold of the moving speed, a high-speed movement is<br>
determined when the moving speed is higher, and a low-speed<br>
movement or a suspended state is determined when the moving<br>
speed is lower.<br>
In step S55, the moving speed of a target terminal is<br>
estimated. In step S56, a high-speed movement/low-speed<br>
movement is determined. In step S57, the maximum possible<br>
available bandwidth of a target terminal is confirmed. In step<br>
S58, the CQI of each band of a necessary bandwidth is received<br>
from the terminal. In step S59, a bandwidth and a available<br>
band are selected from the moving speed, the possible available<br>
bandwidth, and the CQI of each band. In step S60, a terminal<br>
group is selected.<br>
FIG. 22 is a view of the configuration illustrating the<br>
principle of the terminal according to the present invention.<br>
FIG. 23 is a view illustrating the configuration of the<br>
principle of the base station according to the present invention.<br>
In FIG. 22, a component corresponding to that in FIG. 1 is<br>
assigned the same reference numeral. In FIG. 23, a component<br>
corresponding to that in FIG. 2 is assigned the same reference<br>
numeral.<br>
In the downlink transmission of the wireless<br>
communication system using a plurality of bands in the OFDMA<br><br>
system such as the E3G etc. and the MC-CDMA system etc., when<br>
a terminal receives a downlink control signal (for example, a<br>
pilot signal) when a channel is set through the antenna 10, the<br>
radio unit 11, and the demodulation/decoding unit 12, and<br>
measures and calculates the wireless channel quality of each<br>
band by the wireless channel quality measurement unit 13, and<br>
notifies the base station using an uplink wireless channel<br>
through the channel quality transmission unit 14, the<br>
coding/modulation unit 15, the radio unit 16, and the antenna<br>
10.<br>
In the base station that receives the wireless channel<br>
quality of each band, a channel setting measurement result<br>
extraction unit 29 extracts the wireless channel quality etc.<br>
of each band measured by a terminal, and provides it for a channel<br>
setting unit 30. The channel setting unit 30 refers to the<br>
information about the terminal of a terminal group setting unit<br>
31, considers the possible available bandwidth of the terminal,<br>
the use state and the load of the band, determines the band used<br>
by the terminal, groups the terminal by the available band, and<br>
notifies the terminal of the result through a terminal group<br>
setting signal generation unit 32.<br>
Upon receipt of the notification, the terminal allows a<br>
terminal group setting information extraction unit 17 to<br>
extract the information, sets the frequency band etc. of the<br>
terminal group to which the terminal is assigned on the radio<br>
units 11 and 16 and the channel quality measurement unit 13<br>
through a terminal setting control unit 18. Afterwards, the<br>
channel quality of the available band is periodically measured<br>
by the channel quality measurement unit 13, calculates the<br>
channel quality indicator, and reports the result to the base<br>
station through the uplink wireless channel.<br>
When the base station allows the channel quality<br>
information collection/classification unit 23 to receive the<br>
wireless channel quality indicator from each terminal<br>
classifies the wireless channel quality indicator for each<br><br>
group to which the terminal belongs, and calculates the<br>
transmission priority on the basis of the wireless channel<br>
quality indicator for each group using schedulers 24-1 through<br>
24-n. At this time, a scheduler of the schedulers 24-1 through<br>
24-n is selected for taking charge of the terminal group to which<br>
the terminal that has transmitted the channel quality<br>
information belongs, and calculates the transmission priority.<br>
In FIG. 23, only two schedulers are illustrated, but generally<br>
n schedulers can be provided, and it is effective when the number<br>
of schedulers is equal to the number of terminal groups.<br>
A transmission terminal is selected on the basis of the<br>
priority calculation result, a transmitting method (for example,<br>
the amount of transmission data, a modulation system, a coding<br>
rate, etc.) is selected, a transmission control signal is<br>
generated by control signal generation units 25-1 through 25-n<br>
on the basis of the selection result, and the signal is<br>
transmitted to the terminal that transmits data. After the<br>
transmission control signal, transmission data is coded in the<br>
determined transmitting method, modulated, and then<br>
transmitted to the terminal. With the possible available<br>
bandwidth of the terminal and the possible available modulation<br>
system taken into account, a transmitting method is selected.<br>
Furthermore, by limiting the possible available modulation<br>
system for each group (for each scheduler) , the transmitting<br>
method selecting process can be more easily performed.<br>
The terminal allows a control signal extraction unit 19<br>
to extract the transmission control signal transmitted from the<br>
base station, interprets the contents of the signal, and makes<br>
necessary settings in receiving data on the<br>
demodulation/decoding unit 12. After the settings, the data<br>
transmitted from the base station is received.<br>
As described above, the following processes can be<br>
performed by grouping terminals on the basis of the available<br>
bands.<br>
1) The wireless channel quality is measured only for the<br><br>
available band, the wireless channel quality indicator is<br>
calculated, and the result is reported to the base station.<br>
2) The scheduling process is performed or each group, the<br>
priority is calculated, the transmitting terminal is selected,<br>
and the transmitting method is determined.<br>
As described above, the following effect can be obtained.<br>
The measurement of the wireless channel quality can be<br>
reduced on the unused bands. That is, the process can be easily<br>
performed. In addition, the number of reports of the wireless<br>
channel quality indicator to the base station can be reduced.<br>
Thus, the transmitting process at the terminal can be reduced,<br>
and the number of reports can be decreased, thereby reducing<br>
the wave interference with the up-channel.<br>
Furthermore, since the scheduling process can be<br>
performed for each group, the number of terminals to be<br>
scheduled can be reduced, and the processing time required to<br>
calculate the priority etc. can be shortened. In addition, by<br>
performing the scheduling process for each group, the<br>
scheduling processes can be concurrently performed, and the<br>
processing time required to calculate the priority etc. can be<br>
shortened.<br>
In the example of the configuration of the base station<br>
illustrated in FIG. 23, the channel setting unit 30 and the<br>
terminal group setting unit 31 enclosed by the doted lines can<br>
be provided for the wireless channel control station (RNC) as<br>
an upper-stream device of the base station.<br>
In the descriptions above, the terminals are grouped when<br>
a channel is set, but the grouping process can be changed at<br>
predetermined intervals or for adjustment of the number of<br>
accommodated terminals in the corresponding bands (that is, a<br>
negative load) . In this case, for example, the process can be<br>
performed in the procedure illustrated in FIG. 6.<br>
FIG. 24 illustrates an example of a configuration<br>
illustrated in FIG. 22 applied to a case when a CQI is measured<br>
as wireless channel quality. FIG. 25 illustrates an example<br><br>
of a configuration illustrated in FIG. 23 applied to a case when<br>
a CQI is measured as wireless channel quality.<br>
The CQI measurement/calculation unit illustrated in FIG.<br>
24	measures and calculates the CQI only for the frequency band<br>
used by the related terminal group after it is determined which<br>
terminal group the related terminal belongs. The necessary<br>
settings are performed by the terminal setting control unit 18.<br>
The CQI collection/classification unit 23 illustrated in FIG.<br>
25	measures the CQI relating to the available frequency bands<br>
of the terminal group to which the terminal belongs, and<br>
collects the calculation value. The obtained CQI value is<br>
passed to the scheduler for managing the scheduling of the<br>
corresponding terminal group.<br>
FIG. 26 illustrates the second example of a configuration<br>
of a base station according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In FIG. 26, a component corresponding to that illustrated<br>
in FIG. 23 is assigned the same reference numeral.<br>
In the example of the configuration above, the grouping<br>
process is performed with the possible available bandwidth of<br>
the terminal taken into account. In this example, the possible<br>
available band of a terminal is 20 MHz, and one divided band<br>
is 5 MHz. The terminal belongs to the group of the available<br>
band of 20 MHz . However, depending on the data to be transmitted,<br>
the requested transmission speed may not require the bandwidth<br>
of 20 MHz. In this case, the available bandwidth of 20 MHz is<br>
not efficient. However, in the group for which the available<br>
bandwidth is fixed, the available band is 20 MHz.<br>
Then, assume that the terminal belongs to possible<br>
multiple groups of the bandwidths of 20 MHz, 10 MHz, and 5 MHz.<br>
Since the terminal can belong to the groups having different<br>
available central frequencies, the terminal can belong to seven<br>
groups. In this case, when a broad bandwidth is used, and when<br>
a transmitting terminal is selected, the scheduling process is<br>
to be performed in the descending order of the available<br><br>
bandwidths. By hierarchically arranging the groups in the<br>
descending order of available bandwidths, a broad band can be<br>
easily used. In addition, when a broad band is used, it is<br>
desired that consecutive bands are selected, but the<br>
consecutive bands can be more easily used by the hierarchical<br>
configuration above.<br>
When the hierarchical grouping is performed, different<br>
schedulers are not assigned to each terminal group, but it is<br>
performed by providing one hierarchical scheduler 24a capable<br>
of performing a concurrent calculation.<br>
FIG. 27 illustrates the third example of a configuration<br>
of a base station according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. FIG. 28 illustrates the second example of a<br>
configuration of a terminal according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention corresponding to FIG. 27. In FIG. 27, the<br>
component corresponding to that in FIG. 23 is assigned the same<br>
reference numeral. In FIG. 28, the component corresponding to<br>
that in FIG. 22 is assigned the same reference numeral.<br>
In this example, an uplink transmission is described as<br>
an example, but an available frequency band can be selected<br>
using uplink wireless channel quality for a downlink<br>
transmission.<br>
A terminal performance information generation unit 53<br>
generates terminal performance information on the basis of the<br>
terminal performance stored in a terminal performance storage<br>
unit 52, and the terminal transmits a control signal (for<br>
example, a pilot signal) generated by an uplink control signal<br>
generation unit 54 according to the information about the<br>
possible available band as the terminal performance.<br>
The base station measures the reception power of the<br>
control signal (for example, a pilot signal) transmitted from<br>
the terminal using each band in a CQI measurement/calculation<br>
unit 50 during channel setting, a terminal performance<br>
information extraction unit 51 extracts a result obtained by<br>
calculating the wireless channel quality of each band and the<br><br>
possible available bandwidth of the terminal, they are provided<br>
for the channel setting unit 30, a group to which the<br>
corresponding terminal belongs is selected, and the terminal<br>
is notified of the result.<br>
Upon receipt of the notification, the terminal allows the<br>
terminal group setting information extraction unit 17 to<br>
extract group information, the terminal setting control unit<br>
18 to set devices such as the radio units 11 and 16, and then<br>
performs an uplink data transmission using the bands.<br>
On the other hand, the base station allows the wireless<br>
channel quality indicator collection unit 23 to measure and<br>
calculate the uplink wireless channel quality only on the bands<br>
of the group to which the terminal belongs, and performs the<br>
scheduling process on the basis of the results of the<br>
measurement and the calculation. A terminal is selected on the<br>
basis of the priority calculated in the scheduling process, an<br>
uplink transmitting method is selected, and the selected<br>
terminal is notified of the results. The notification is<br>
extracted by the control signal extraction unit 19 of the<br>
terminal, and set by the demodulation/decoding unit 12.<br>
FIG. 29 illustrates the fourth example of a configuration<br>
of a base station according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. In FIG. 29, the component corresponding to that in<br>
FIG. 23 is assigned the same reference numeral.<br>
With the above-mentioned configuration, a terminal is<br>
grouped by the wireless channel quality of each band and the<br>
possible available bandwidth. However, in this example, since<br>
the terminal is grouped with the QoS (quality of service) of<br>
the transmission data taken into account. Since the QoS is<br>
predetermined (for example, during channel setting) when the<br>
base station communicates with the terminal, and the base<br>
station is informed of the QoS in advance when it communicates<br>
with the terminal, it inputs the information to the channel<br>
setting unit 30 and the terminal group setting unit 31 to<br>
consider the terminal in the grouping process.<br><br>
FIG. 30 illustrates the fifth example of a configuration<br>
of a base station according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. In FIG. 30, the component corresponding to that in<br>
FIG. 23 is assigned the same reference numeral.<br>
With the above-mentioned configuration, a terminal is<br>
grouped using the wireless channel quality of each band and the<br>
possible available bandwidth of the terminal. However, in this<br>
example, the grouping process is performed with the moving speed<br>
of the terminal taken into account. In the base station, for<br>
example, a moving speed measurement/calculation unit 40<br>
measures the control signal (for example, a pilot signal)<br>
transmitted from the terminal and the reception power of data,<br>
and calculates the moving speed (or the relative speed between<br>
the terminal and the base station) of the terminal on the basis<br>
of the measurement result. In the terminal group setting unit<br>
31 or the channel setting unit 30, the measured and calculated<br>
speed of the terminal is compared with the speed threshold<br>
stored in the terminal group setting unit 31 of the channel<br>
setting unit 30. If it is equal to or exceeds the threshold,<br>
then it is determined that the terminal is moving at a high speed,<br>
an available bandwidth and an available frequency are selected,<br>
and a terminal group is selected. The speed threshold can be<br>
externally stored for the terminal group setting unit 31 and<br>
the channel setting unit 30.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention,<br>
a terminal is grouped for each available frequency, and<br>
scheduled for group, thereby reducing the number of target<br>
terminals to be scheduled, concurrently performing the<br>
scheduling processes, and shortening the processing time for<br>
the scheduling processes.<br>
In addition, since the wireless channel quality can be<br>
measured only for the available frequency band, the measuring<br>
process can be reduced. Furthermore, since the number of<br>
reports of the wireless channel quality can be reduced, the<br>
interference power can be successfully reduced.<br><br>
