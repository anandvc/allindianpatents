				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an article of manufacture comprising a substrate and at least one coating layer, useful as a model of mammalian keratinous tissue.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many consumer products are applied to the skin or hair, and/or involve the sensory experience of touching. Consumer preferences are influenced by a multitude of factors, including product effectiveness, the feel of the product, fragrance, durability, ease of rinsing, etc. One way to determine consumer preferences is by conducting consumer marketing tests, in which a representative group of consumers, or panelists, provide feedback after using a product. Consumer marketing tests have several drawbacks, however. Because panelists must be appropriately selected and compensated for their time, such tests are expensive and time consuming. Human feedback is inherently subjective, and may raise concerns about reliability. Products must be safe for human testing, and the analyses that can be performed after application also are limited.<br>
Some product testing can be performed using model systems. Artificial substrates are available that, to some extent, imitate human skin. For example, theatrical performers often transform their appearance by using molded body parts that can be made to look remarkably like human skin. Alternatively, keratinous tissue from animals or human cadavers may be used. Whereas these and other available models may be suitable for some types of product testing, all have significant limitations. Cadaver tissue is costly, and neither cadaver nor animal tissue can truly mimic living, human tissue. Artificial substrates are poorly suited to assess characteristics such as product adsorption, rinseability, elasticity and compressibility. Many substrates absorb water and/or decompose, and thus cannot be effectively cleaned or reused. Currently available models also fail to reflect differences in skin on various parts of the body, in different environments, and between different individuals, which may be critical in developing certain personal care products. Characteristics of skin on, for example, one's face, fingertips, palms of the hand, heels, and underarms tend to differ dramatically. The skin of babies and young children differs from the skin of adults, and skin having hair differs<br>
from non-haired skin. In summary, to date no suitable substrate is available that can reproduce complex properties of various types of keratinous tissue that are relevant to a wide range of products.<br>
There exists a need, therefore, to provide a more suitable model of a range of types of mammalian keratinous tissue for testing consumer products, which is capable of reproducing a wide range of properties most relevant to a given product, and which can reduce the need for testing with human subjects.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention meets the aforementioned need. Applicants have found that a coating layer can be stably affixed to the surface of a suitable substrate to produce a more suitable model of keratinous tissue. The coating layer can be chosen from a variety of coating materials to demonstrate known physical properties of the keratinous tissue of interest. In addition, the substrate and/or coating layer may have a texture similar to the keratinous tissue. A substance, one example of which is a consumer product, then can be topically applied to the article, which in turn can be analyzed by a wide variety of methods to gain insight into the interaction of the substance with the coated substrate. These interactions in turn can be correlated to consumer preferences, and thus aid hi selective product development.<br>
Some non-limiting physical properties of interest include surface energy (including hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions), surface charge, and surface reactivity. For example, dry skin and human vulvar skin tend to be relatively hydrophobic, whereas wet skin tends to be relatively hydrophilic. If one is interested in formulating a product that more effectively adheres to skin in the shower, a coating layer similar in hydrophilicity to wet skin can be bonded to a substrate of the present invention, the product applied, rinsed, and the surface analyzed. Similarly, if one is interested in formulating a composition that effectively transfers from the surface of a product (for example, from a wipe or catamenial product) and effectively adheres to, for example, vulvar skin, a coating layer similar in hydrophobicity to vulvar skin can be bonded to a substrate, the product applied, and the surface analyzed. In addition, skin has a net charge associated with its surface, which may be dependent upon many factors, including for example perspiration, dryness, and even one's gender. A coating layer can be bonded to<br>
the substrate to produce a desired net positive or net negative charge, which would allow selective development of products better suited to these various circumstances.<br>
The texture of the substrate is an important aspect of the present invention. In contrast to previously available models, the texture of the article of manufacture of the 'present invention can more closely mimic a wide variety of keratinous tissues. Texture may be important in determining, for example, product deposition and coverage, in particular in areas of keratinous tissue having wrinkles and deep lines. Texture also may be important in determining whether a given product is effective, for example, in dark, moist environments produced by deep lines and folds of skin.<br>
Textured, coated substrates can be produced that combine any of the aforementioned properties, resulting in models of keratinous tissue found in a variety of environments, on a variety of body parts, and on a variety of individuals. Therefore, by choosing appropriate combinations of texture and coating materials, the surface can be controllably varied to meet a wide range of product development needs.<br>
The coated substrates of the present invention offer several advantages over both consumer marketing tests and currently available model substrates. They are cost effective, and easy to produce, store and use. The coated substrates are robust, can be effectively cleaned with a variety of solvents without substantial deterioration, and reused. Testing can be performed more rapidly, and can more easily be repeated, resulting in increased throughput, efficiency and reproducibility. After a substance has been applied, the coated substrate can be analyzed using standard physical and analytical methods, which results in more objective and reliable data than can be obtained from human panelists. A wide variety of analyses can be performed, including destructive analyses, which are not possible to perform on human subjects. In addition, the physical properties can be selected that are beyond the parameters typically observed in human skin, which would, for example, allow mechanistic studies to be performed.<br>
According to the first embodiment of the present invention, an article of manufacture is provided comprising a substrate and a coating layer. The coating layer comprises at least one coating material, and is stably affixed to said substrate to form a stable, coated surface. The coated surface has a texture that mimics the topography of mammalian keratinous tissue and demonstrates at least one physical property<br>
representative of mammalian keratinous tissue, selected from the group consisting of a<br>
total surface energy of from about 15 mJ/m to about 50 mJ/m, a dispersive component of the surface energy of from about 15 mJ/m2 to about 50 mJ/m2, a polar component of the total surface energy of from about 1 mJ/m2 to about 14 mJ/m2, a zeta-potential at a pH of about 5.0 of from about -40 mV to about 30 mV, and combinations thereof.<br>
According to a second embodiment of the present invention, an article of manufacture is provided comprising a substrate and a coating layer. The coating layer comprises at least one coating material, and is stably affixed to the substrate to form a stable, coated surface which has a texture that mimics the topography of mammalian keratinous tissue. The coating material is selected from the group consisting of allyl amines, allyl alcohols, 1,1,1-trimethyl-l-pentene, perfluoromethylcyclohexane (PFMCH) monomer, and combinations thereof<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Whereas the specification concludes with claims that particularly point out and distinctly claim the present invention, it is believed that the invention will be better understood from the following details.<br>
In all embodiments of the present invention, all percentages of materials in the substrate are by weight of the total substrate, unless specifically stated otherwise. All percentages of materials in an individual coating layer are by weight of the individual coating layer, unless specifically stated otherwise. All ratios are weight ratios, unless specifically stated otherwise. The number of significant digits conveys neither limitations<br>
on the indicated amounts nor on the accuracy of the measurements. All amounts indicating quantities, percentages, proportions, etc. are understood to be modified by the word "about" unless otherwise specifically indicated. All measurements are understood to be made at about 25°C and at ambient conditions, where "ambient conditions" means conditions under about one atmosphere of pressure and at about 50% relative humidity, unless otherwise specified.<br>
'Topical application," as used herein, means to apply or spread a composition onto the surface of the keratinous tissue and/or onto an article of manufacture as described herein.<br>
"Keratinous tissue," as used herein, means keratin-containing layers disposed as the outer layer of mammalian epidermal tissue, including skin, hair, nails, lips, vulvar region, buttock, and nails. The vulvar region is understood to include the region from the posterior gluteal groove and perineum to the anterior mons pubis and laterally between the intertriginous zones. The keratinous tissue may be from any part of the body of the mammal, and may vary widely in characteristics that include, but are not limited to, age, condition (for example, dryness), thickness, elasticity, pigmentation, presence of blemishes and/or imperfections, etc. "Keratinous tissue" also is understood to include the outer layer of mammalian mucosal membranes, such as the alimentary canal, including the oral cavity, esophagus, stomach, intestines, nasal cavity, lips, stomach and intestines, and the vaginal canal.<br>
"Curable," as used herein, means substrate material that initially is in a liquid state, and that may be formed into a desired shape, for example, by pouring into a mold. Solvents are allowed to evaporate or are otherwise substantially removed. The material solidifies, and may undergo a variety of chemical reactions, including, for example, crosslinking. "Moldable," as used herein, means substrate material that may not initially be present in a liquid state, but which may be formed into a desired shape in a solid state, for example, by appropriately applying pressure to the material. Upon application of pressure, the material will substantially maintain its shape.<br>
"Elongation range," as used herein, means the range that an article of manufacture may be elongated, or stretched, before breaking or alternatively, before becoming irreversibly unfit for the intended use. Herein, the elongation range is expressed as a<br>
percentage, and is calculated as the length of the article of manufacture after stretching divided by the length of the article of manufacture prior to stretching, the quotient of which is multiplied by 100.<br>
'Texture," as used herein, means a series of impressions and/or elevated areas, relative to the average height of the planar surface of the textured layer.<br>
"Resembles" or alternatively "resembling the topography," means that one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize the depth, density and arrangements of the lines and/or grooves of the article of manufacture to be similarly patterned to, or to mimic, the keratinous tissue of interest.<br>
"Negative mold," or "negative impression," as used herein, means a mold created by placing a suitable material on the keratinous tissue or body part of interest, and removing the material from the tissue. The resulting negative mold contains an impression of the keratinous tissue or body part. The resulting negative mold subsequently can be used to create a positive mold.<br>
"Positive mold," as used herein, means an article made from material capable of being molded or formed so as to resemble the shape of a body part or keratinous tissue of interest. Positive molds typically are made by pouring or pressing a suitable material into a negative mold. A suitable material will retain the texture and/or shape of the keratinous tissue from which the negative mold is made.<br>
"Substrate," as used herein, means one or more materials to which a coating layer may be stably affixed. "Coating layer," as used herein, means one or more chemical moieties, or coating materials, that are stably affixed, to the substrate. When more than one substrate material and/or coating material is present, the materials may be homogenovisly mixed, may form discrete areas, and/or may form discrete layers.<br>
"Homogenously mixed," as used herein, means that the substrate and/or coating materials are combined such that the chemical and physical properties of various areas of the substrate or coating layer are substantially uniform.<br>
"Discrete area," as used herein, means that within a given layer, the substrate and/or coating materials are separated to form areas that predominantly comprise different materials or combinations of coating materials. This results in a substrate and/or coating<br>
layer that may have varying chemical and physical properties, depending upon which area of the layer is analyzed.<br>
"Discrete layer," as used in reference to the coating layer, means that the coating materials form at least a first coating layer and a second coating layer. The first coating layer stably affixed to the substrate such that the thickness of the coating layer is substantially uniform, and the second layer similarly is stably affixed to the first coating layer. When used in reference to the substrate, the materials form a first layer, upon which a second, layer is stably affixed. Additional layers may be sequentially added. Each layer may comprise the same or different materials. When a layer comprises more than one material, the materials may be homogenously mixed, may form discrete areas, and/or may be combinations thereof.<br>
"Stably affixed," or alternatively "bonded," as used herein, means that a compound, for example a coating layer, is stably attached such that the compound remains substantially affixed during at least one use, analysis and/or cleaning. One example of a stably affixed coating layer is one which has been applied by plasma deposition as described herein. "Substantially affixed" is understood to mean any amount of coating layer that may be incidentally removed is insufficient to measurably alter the physical properties of the artificial substrate surface that are representative of keratinous tissue. "Stably affixed" further means that the compound remains substantially affixed when rinsed and/or rubbed with solvents including, but not limited to, water, detergents, alcohols (for example, methanol, ethanol and isopropanol), hydrocarbons (for example, hexane), where "rubbing" is understood to mean at least five back-and-forth motions using a paper towel or a Kimwipe™ which is soaked in the solvent. The bonding may be covalent, or may occur by any suitable means as would be understood by one of skill in the art to result in being stably affixed as defined herein. "Stably affixed" is understood not to include, for example, laminated or other coating layers which may be removed, exhibit peeling, and/or are visibly or otherwise damaged upon exposure to solvents including, but not limited to, the aforementioned solvents. "Laminated" is understood to include layers which are attached by a discrete adhesive means, for example, a glue or other chemical adhesive.<br>
"Stable," as used herein, means that after at least one use as described herein, the chemical and/or physical properties of the article of manufacture, including but not limited to surface energy, surface charge, texture, thickness and/or mass (for example, loss of the integrity of the texture and/or gain in mass due to absorption of water or other liquids) do not exhibit a statistically significant change. When used in reference to one or more coating layers, "stable" means that the coating layer remains substantially affixed during at least one use, non-destructive types of analysis, and/or cleaning.<br>
"Re-used," as used herein, means that a substance may be applied to the article of manufacture and data reliably obtained at least twice.<br>
"Physical properties representative of mammalian keratinous tissue," or grammatical equivalents thereof, as used herein, means physical and/or chemical properties of the article of manufacture that are substantially similar to mammalian keratinous tissue and that may be relevant to a particular product or substance. For example, if the keratinous tissue is found to be hydrophobic and positively charged, the coated surface of the article of manufacture also will be hydrophobic and positively charged.<br>
"Interaction of products with mammalian keratinous tissue," includes, but is not limited to, absorption, adsorption, covalent bonding, dispersion, changes in physical properties such as color, opacity, odor, texture, feel, etc.<br>
"Products relating to keratinous tissue," as used herein means products that are applied to the keratinous tissue, are in close contact with the keratinous tissue, and/or products that involve sensory experiences via the keratinous tissue.

Alternatively, the substrate is in the form of a child's buttocks and/or pelvic region.<br>
The substrate may be colored, white or colorless, and may be transparent or opaque. In one embodiment, the substrate is similar in color to a desired type of mammalian skin. Alternatively, the substrate is similar in color to human skin. Alternatively, the color may be altered to resemble various degrees and types of pigmentation found in human skin. B. Texture<br>
The article of manufacture may comprise at least one textured surface. When the article of manufacture is cylindrical, the outermost surface may be textured. The substrate may be textured, and/or the texture may result from the coating layer. The texture comprises a plurality of impressions and/or elevated areas that may be patterned and/or may be randomly arranged. The topography of the texture may vary to resemble degrees of wrinkling of keratinous tissue. Alternatively, the depth of the impressions may vary to resemble keratinous tissue ranging from relatively smooth (for example, oral mucosal linings) to deeply lined (for example, elbows or deep facial lines), and further may resemble scaly, fissured, rough, and/or otherwise visibly-textured keratinous tissue. The texture may resemble the topography of keratinous tissue on essentially any body part. The texture may resemble the topography of healthy keratinous tissue or alternatively keratinous tissue damaged by, for example, exposure to UV- rays, chemicals, and/or illness. Alternatively, a substrate may comprise discrete areas having different textures. The texture may be visible without the use of visual aids, (i.e. on a macroscopic level), or may be clearly visible only with visual aids such as a magnifying glass or microscope set<br>

Alternatively, the texture mimics the topography of human skin. Alternatively, the texture mimics the topography of the outermost layer of mammalian hair. Alternatively, the texture mimics the topography of the outermost layer of human hair. Alternatively, natural or artificial hair may be attached or anchored in the substrate such that one end protrudes outwardly through the coating layer. Alternatively, the texture mimics a composite of topographies of keratinous tissue from a plurality of individuals, representative of an average keratinous tissue type of a given population.<br>
The impressions may be in the form of, for example, lines or grooves, the depth of which may vary depending upon the type and condition of keratinous tissue upon which the substrate is modeled. In one embodiment, the impressions have a depth of from about 0.01 mm to about 10 mm, alternatively from about 0.01 mm to about 0,1 mm, alternatively from about 0.1 mm to about 1 mm, and alternatively from about 0.1 mm to about 0.5 mm, as measured from the average height of the planar surface of the substrate. C. Coating layer<br>
The article of manufacture of the present invention may comprise at least one coating layer that is stably affixed to the substrate. The coating layer comprises at least one coating material. The thickness of the coating layer may be substantially uniform. In one embodiment, the coating material is covalently bonded to the textured surface. In another embodiment, the coating layer forms a textured surface, which is stably affixed to a textured or non-textured substrate, which may or may not be textured. The texture may result from structures in the coating layer itself, non-limiting examples of which include particulates and fibers, or alternatively may result from impressions made in the coating layer subsequent to deposition, for example, by "stamping". The coating layer may demonstrate at least one physical property that is representative of mammalian keratinous tissue, and the choice of coating material(s) will depend upon the desired physical property. When more than one coating material is used, the compounds may be homogenously mixed, may form discrete areas, and/or may form discrete layers. In one embodiment, a first discrete coating layer is stably affixed to the substrate, and at least one additional coating layer is stably affixed to the first coating layer. The additional<br>
coating layers may be made from the same or from different coating materials than the first coating layer. The thickness of the coating layer may vary, but when the underlying substrate is textured, the coating layer may be sufficiently thin so as not to mask or significantly interfere with an underlying texture, and may faithfully mimic the underlying substrate topography, hi one embodiment, the thickness of an individual coating layer is a monolayer. Alternatively, the thickness of an individual coating layer is from about 0.1 nm to about 1 mm, and alternatively from about 1 nm to 0.1 mm.<br>
In one embodiment, the coating layer may be sufficiently cleaned to allow at least one re-use. Alternatively, the coating layer may be cleaned and re-used at least five times, alternatively at least ten times, and alternatively at least 20 times.<br>
Examples of classes of suitable coating materials include, but are not limited to, chemical functional groups, organic compounds, hydrocarbons, chemically functionalized hydrocarbons, macrocycles, lipids, proteins, hydrophilic monomers, hydrophobia monomers, polymerizable monomers, metals, particulates, and combinations thereof. Additionally or alternatively, the coating material may comprise fibrous materials. In one embodiment, the coating materials are selected from the group consisting of chemically functionalized hydrocarbons, hydrophilic monomers, hydrophobic monomers, polymerizable monomers, and combinations thereof. Alternatively, the coating material is a metal selected.from the group consisting of gold, silver, nickel, and mixtures thereof.

The coating layer may be stably affixed to the substrate and/or other coating Jayer by any process which results in formation of a stable coating layer. The process may result in covalent bonds being formed between the coating layer and the substrate, or alternatively between two coating layers, or the process may result in other types of stable bonds. The bonding process may require the steps of surface activation; deposition of the coating material; and bonding the coating material to the activated substrate. Alternatively, curing may be required to further stabilize the coating material.<br>
Alternatively, the coating layer may be bonded by means of self-assembly, one non-limiting example of which is bonding of a sulfur-containing moiety to a metallic surface to produce what is known in the art as a self-assembled monolayer.<br>
Surface activation may be required to make the surface chemically reactive and thus prepare the substrate for deposition of a coating layer. Surface activation may occur by a variety of means, non-limiting examples of which include plasma activation, electron beam activation, corona activation, glow discharge activation, optical activation, and combinations thereof. Surface activation may occur either at or below atmospheric pressure. In one embodiment, surface activation occurs by means of plasma activation.

An example of a suitable atmospheric-pressure plasma generating apparatus and bonding process is described in U.S. patent 6,821,379, issued to Datta et al. An example of a suitable microwave-frequency generated plasma apparatus and bonding process is described in U.S. patent 6,841,201, issued to Shanov et al.<br>

Processes that result, for example, in a laminated coating that can be manually peeled or removed by rubbing and/or with commonly available solvents are not considered to be stably affixed, as defined herein. In one embodiment, the coating material is deposited in the gas phase, for example by plasma deposition. Alternatively, the coating material is deposited by means of flash evaporation and cryo-condenstation.<br>
Bonding and/or curing may be required subsequent to deposition to sufficiently adhere the coating layer to the substrate and to otherwise stabilize the coating layer.

The energy may be applied in a pulsed and/or continuous manner.<br>
Alternatively, activation, deposition and/or bonding may occur by means of a single process. For example, both surface activation and deposition (or "grafting") may occur as a result of the plasma deposition process described in U.S. patents 6,821,379, issued to Datta et al., and 6,841,201, issued to Shanov et al. E. Physical Properties Representative of Mammalian Keratinous Tissue<br>
The article of manufacture of the present invention demonstrates one or more physical properties that are representative of mammalian skin. The property or properties of interest will vary according to factors that include, but are not limited to, the type of keratinous tissue, the environment of the keratmous tissue, the individual consumer, the substance that is being applied to the keratinous tissue and/or the product with which the keratinous tissue comes into contact. Examples of representative properties include, but are not limited to, surface energy (for example, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity), surface charge, surface reactivity, texture, and combinations thereof. The properties can be controllably varied by, for example, the choice of substrate and/or coating layer, and by varying parameters that control deposition of the coating layer.<br>
The coating layer may have an average surface charge that is representative of mammalian keratinous tissue. Herein, the surface charge of the coating layer is understood to mean the average surface charge of a representative area of coating layer, although localized variations may occur due to such factors as variation of deposition of coating materials (e.g. proteins and lipids) and texture. The surface charge of the coating layer may be positive, negative, or neutral, and is largely determined by the presence of ionic species, including acidic and basic species. The surface charge determines, for example, the polarity of the keratinous tissue, which in turn may affect deposition and adhesion of various substances on the surface. The net surface charge may be measured by determination of the isoelectric point and/or the zeta-potential of the surface. A variety of means of determining the zeta-potential may be employed and would be known to one of skill in the art. For the purposes of the present invention, determine the zeta-potential of the coated substrates by streaming potential measurements conducted on an Electro Kinetic analyzer (model no. BI-EKA, Anton Parr GmbH, Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, New York, NY) with a clamp cell configuration, using as an electrolyte solution 1.0 x 10"3 M KC1 in deionized water, titrated starting from a pH of about 2.5 to a<br>
pH of about 8.0 using a IN solution of NaOH. The zeta potential values generated as a function of pH are relative to standard PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate). Each zeta-potential profile (for each type of coated substrate and other model) can thus be compared in relative terms.<br>
In one embodiment, the zeta-potential of the coating layer at a pH of about 5.0 is from about -40 mV to about +30 mV, where "mV" means 1 x 10"3 Volts. In one embodiment, the zeta-potential of the coating layer at a pH of about 5.0 is from about -15 mV to about +15 mV, where "about 5.0" is understood to mean 5.0 ± 0.3 pH units.<br>
The coating layer may have an average surface energy that is representative of mammalian keratinous tissue. Herein, the surface energy of the coating layer is understood to mean the average surface energy of a representative area of coating layer, although localized variations may occur due to such factors as variation of deposition of coating materials (e.g. proteins and lipids) and texture. The surface energy of the coating layer correlates to hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity, and may be representative of, for example, the moisture content of keratinous tissue. The surface energy of the coating layer are derived from contact angle measurements, which can be converted to surface energy by various accepted models that would be known to one of skill in the art. One such model, used in the present invention, is the Fowkes equation, as described in Fowkes, FM.: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, vol. 56, number 12, p, 40 (1964):<br>
(Sequence Removed)<br>
where 0 refers to the contact angle;      lv  refers to the surface tension of liquid; Y tv refers to is the dispersive component of the surface tension of liquid;  dsv refers to the<br>
dispersive component of the surface tension of solid;  p refers to the polar component of the surface tension of liquid and  P - is the polar component of the surface tension<br>
of solid. The contact angles of the coated substrates of the present invention were measured using diiodomethane ( 99%, Aldrich), ethylene glycol ( 99% +, AJdrich) and water (HPLC grade, Aldrich).<br>
The total surface energy of the coating layer is the sum of the dispersive surface energy component and the polar surface energy component, which is thought to affect properties such as adhesion of substances to the coating layer. In one embodiment, the<br>
coating layer has a total surface energy of from about 15 mJ/m2 to about 50 mJ/m2, alternatively from about 20 mJ/m2 to about 40 mJ/m2 and alternatively from about 28 ' mJ/m2 to about 35 mJ/m2, where "mJ" means 1 x 10"3 Joules and "m2" means square meters. In one embodiment, the coating layer has a polar surface energy component of from about 0 mJ/m2 to about 15 mJ/m2. Alternatively, the polar surface energy component is from about 0 mJ/m2 to about 5 mJ/m2, alternatively from about 7 mJ/m2 to about 13 mJ/m2, and alternatively from about 13 mJ/m2 to about 20 mJ/m2.<br>
The coating layer may have a surface reactivity that is representative of mammalian keratinous tissue. Surface reactivity is understood to include an increased tendency to react with, or alternatively to bond to, a given compound. Surface reactivity may be determined by a variety of methods, including, for example, measurement of binding coefficients. In contrast to surface charge, which relates to the presence of ionic species, surface reactivity is understood to encompass other types of chemical interactions, for example, covalent interactions. One non-limiting example of surface reactivity would be that exhibited by a thiol-containing coating material toward nucleophilic chemical moieties, for example gold or silver, in products and/or substances. H. Method of Use<br>
The present invention further describes a method of evaluating the interaction of one or more substances with mammalian keratinous tissue. The method comprises the step of applying a substance to an article of manufacture as described herein. The substance may be applied directly, or may be applied by bringing a second article of manufacture, non-limiting examples of which include a wipe or an absorbent article, into contact with the coated substrate of the present invention. The method further may comprise the step of performing chemical and/or instrumental analysis of the coated substrate, the second article of manufacture, and/or the substance of interest. In one embodiment, the binding coefficient of the substance to the coating layer may be determined. Alternatively, the substance may be removed from the article of manufacture, for example by rinsing, wiping, or other suitable means, prior to, during and/or after analysis. The method may be performed under static conditions or with dynamic movement, at room temperature, or at body temperature. Alternatively, the substrate may be pre-conditioned to specified environmental conditions, for example,<br>

A printed advertisement, for example, in a trade journal, refers to the article of manufacture contained in the package and communicates that the substrate and coating material are suitable for testing consumer products. IV. Examples Example 1<br>
The following example illustrates one process of creating a mold and imparting to the substrate a texture that has been modeled directly from the skin.<br>
Make a first negative imprint of keratinous tissue by applying a material1 capable of forming a cast, or mold, onto a body part, for example, human skin and/or hair. Remove the cast and allow to dry for 3 - 7 min. Make a positive mold that resembles the body part in both form and texture by placing for example silicone or other suitable material2 in the negative mold. Impress the positive mold into polyurethane or other suitable material to create a second negative mold, and allow the second negative mold to cure overnight. Optionally, press the positive molds into a unitary mold of polyurethane or other suitable material to create multiple negative molds. Optionally, coat the second negative mold with a 1:1 mixture of Skin-Flex SC-893 stretch paint (aliphatic polyurethane gloss paint) and Skin-Flex SC-89 thinner4 to create a first substrate having a thickness of from about 100 µm to about 600 µm, and allow to dry for at least 12 hours. A substrate material5 may then be poured into the second negative mold (onto the gloss paint, if present) in an<br>
amount sufficient to produce a substrate having a thickness of approximately 0.1 mm - 1 cm.<br>
1	Suitable materials include PLY-0-LIFE™ and ALGIFORM™ casting material, both available from Pink<br>
House Studios (St. Albans, VT); or other suitable equivalent materials.<br>
2	Other suitable materials include dental materials, liquid rubber, room temperature vulcanized (RTV)<br>
rubber, plastic, or equivalents thereof.<br>
3	SC-89 Stretch Paint, available from Burman Industries (Van Nuys, CA).<br>
4	SC-89 Thinner, available from Burman Industries, (Van Nuys, CA).<br>
5	TC-410 polyurethane, Part A (aromatic diisocyanate based pre-polymer, plasticizer mixture) and Part B,<br>
polyurethane curing agent, for example, polyether polyol, di (2-ethylhexyl) adipate, aromatic amines, aryl<br>
mercuric carboxylate) with Parts A and B in a 1:1 ratio.  Optionally, Part C (Plasticizer-ester) may be<br>
included at a level of 1% to 150% by weight of the combination of Parts A and B, An acceptable alternative<br>
to TC-410 parts A and B is Skin Flex, Part A (aromatic diisocyanate terminated polyoxypropylene glycol<br>
mixture); Part B, polyurethane curing agent (polyol-diamine mixture), with Part A and Part B in a 1 ;2 ratio;<br>
and optionally Skin Flex Part C (Plasticizcr-ester) at a level of 1% to 150% by weight of the combination of<br>
Parts A and B; all available from BJB Industries (Tustin, CA).<br>
Example 2<br>
The following illustrates one example of the process for making a suitable substrate: Combine equal amounts of Part A and Part B of TC-410 polyurethane, or equivalent materials, and thoroughly mix. Slowly pour a sufficient amount of the mixture into a desired mold, starting from the edge and gradually moving to the center of the mold. The amount should be sufficient to produce a substrate having a thickness of approximately 0.1 mm -1 cm. One example of a suitable amount is 25 ml in a mold having an area of 7 cm x 14 cm. Allow to cure overnight. Begin peeling the polymer substrate from the mold, starting from the edge. Cut away the border if necessary. When poured into a mold as described in Example 1, the substrate thus made has the texture of human keratinous tissue of the body part used to make the first negative imprint.<br>
Example 3<br>
The following example illustrates a process of directly imparting a texture to a substrate<br>
surface.<br>
A patterned surface resembling the surface of mammalian keratinous tissue, for example<br>
forearm skin, or hair, may be mechanically etched onto a metallic surface, following<br>
standard procedures of photolithography known to one of skill in the art. First, create a<br>
pattern that resembles the texture of human skin, for example, from the forearm, either as<br>
a computer-simulated image, or as an actual image (e.g. photographic, microscopic) from<br>
the human body part of interest. Transfer the pattern to a clear sheet to form a mask. Place the mask onto a copper, brass or other appropriate metallic sheet, upon which a photoresist has been previously adhered or laminated. A variety of photoresists are available commercially, for example DuPont TM MX series dry film photoresists. The selection of the photoresist is based on the desired size, texture and/or feature of the keratinous tissue-texture. Expose the composite of metal/photoresist/mask to an appropriate dose of UV light, using industry standard exposure tools. Remove the mask, develop the photoresist and etch the metal layer using appropriate etching solutions, as described in standard textbooks on second level microelectronics packaging.1 Pour a 1:1 mixture of Skin-Flex SC-89 Stretch-paint and Skin-Flex SC-89 Thinner, as described in the previous examples, into the metallic mold and allowed to dry overnight. Adjust the amount of poured mixture, according to the size of the mold, to yield a final substrate that is typically between 600 to 800 micrometers thick. After overnight drying, the substrate material is carefully peeled off of the metallic mold as described above. The substrate material may be surface-modified, or fixedly coated, to impart more specific skin surface properties.<br>

Example 4<br>
The following example illustrates one process for stably affixing a suitable coating<br>
material to a substrate by means of plasma coating.<br>
Plasma deposition may be performed in a plasma unit consisting of a cylindrical vacuum<br>
chamber having a diameter of approximately 30.5 cm and a length of 61.0 cm. Vacuum<br>
may be produced by means of a Leybold PCS 25 vacuum pump. The RF energy may be<br>
supplied from a PE 1000 Advanced Energy 40KHz power supply, across a set of parallel<br>
Al-electrodes in the vacuum chamber.  Create plasma in the vacuum chamber, between<br>
the two electrodes, by application of the RF power. The effective plasma treatment area<br>
is approximately 40 cm by 20 cm.<br>
Plasma deposition may be achieved through the following process:   Place the substrate<br>
material (sample) on a perforated aluminum sample tray in between parallel plate<br>
aluminum electrodes in the plasma chamber.   Reduce the chamber base pressure to<br>
approximately 100 milliTorr (mTorr). Allow a mixture of argon and nitrogen gas, at flow rates of 20 seem of Ai and 10 seem of nitrogen, (where "seem" means standard cubic centimeter per minute) to flow into the chamber for about one hour to substantially degas the sample to be coated. Reduce the base pressure to 10 mTorr, and 25W continuous wave RF power is applied for approximately 5 minutes while allowing the argon/nitrogen mixture to flow into the chamber at the same flow rates. Stop the Ar and N2 flow, evacuate the chamber again to 10 mTorr, and introduce the coating material1 (monomer) into the chamber to a pressure of 100 mTorr, selecting a flow rate of about 10 seem to 200 seem. The rate will depending upon the monomer used and will be within the knowledge of or may be determined with limited experimentation by one of skill in the art. Apply a continuous wave radiofrequency (RF) power at 25W for 25 minutes while maintaining a vapor pressure of approximately 100 - 120 mTorr, This results in the deposition of the monomer onto the sample surface in the form of a polymeric coating that is covalently bonded to the sample surface. Instead of 25W continuous power, RF power may be applied in the pulsed mode, with on/off time ratios of 1 to 1000, and on times in the range of 10 microseconds to 1 sec, to fine-tune the chemical nature of the coating on the sample surface. The exact times will be within the knowledge or may be determined with limited experimentation by one of skill in the art. Power source can also be varied between microwave (MW) and RF, with frequencies selected from available and allowed ranges for MW or RF sources. Turn the power off, and stop the flow of the coating material. Purge the chamber with about 20 seem Ar for about 30 min. Remove the plasma coated surfaces from the chamber and determine the contact angle, surface charge and the thickness of the coating layer determined by video contact angle measurement system (VCA-2500 from ASM), zeta-potential measurement (Anton Parr Electrokinetic Analyzer, Model BI-EKA) and Atomic Force Microscopy (Q-Scope 250 from Quesant Corporation) methods. The plasma coating process can be performed with more than one monomer, used either together to form a combination coating with polymeric species generated from both monomers simultaneously, or as separate coating layers resulting from each monomer applied separately and sequentially.<br>

Example 5<br>
The following example illustrates one non-limiting method of using the artich<br>
manufacture of the present invention to measure the benefit of a product.<br>
Prepare a coating substrate having properties similar to wet skin as described above. Weigh the dry surface, and analyze the surface by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Pre-heat the coated substrate to normal human body temperature. Topically apply an in-shower moisturizer to the coated substrate, and rinse the substrate with running water for about 5 minutes. Allow the surface to dry and weigh the surface. An increase hi mass of the coated substrate provides an indication of how effectively the product adheres to the coated substrate, and how effectively the product would adhere to human skin under similar conditions. The SEM images provide evidence of how effectively the product coats the textured surface.<br>
