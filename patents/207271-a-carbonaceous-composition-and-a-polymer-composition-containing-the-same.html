Treated Carbonaceous Compositions and Improved Polymer Compositions<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to treated carbonaceous compositions comprising a carbonaceous material, preferably a carbon black, treated with an ester polymer. The present invention also relates to polymeric compositions comprising the treated carbonaceous material and at least one polymer.<br>
Background of the Art<br>
Carbonaceous materials include, but are not limited to, carton black, graphite and carbon fibers.<br>
Carbon blacks produced by a furnace process generally have bulk densities ranging from 0.02 to 0.1 gram/cubic centimeter (g/cc) and are generally known as fluffy carbon blacks. Fluffy carbon blacks are generally easy to disperse in liquids, and in some polymeric systems. However, fluffy carbon blacks are generally cohesive and, hence difficult to handle for purposes such as conveying and weighing.<br>
Fluffy carbon blacks are agglomerated by various types of mechanical processes, either in the dry state, or with the aid of a liquid to produce pellets with improved handling characteristics. Common liquid pelletizing agents are oil and water. The process of agglomerating fluffy carbon blacks to form carbon black pellets is generally referred to as pelletizing.<br>
Unfortunately, generally utilized densification or agglomeration (pelletizing) processes have detrimental effects on the dispersion characteristics of the carbon black. Therefore it is recognized in the art that in pelletizing carbon blacks there is a fine balance between acceptable handling characteristics and ease of dispersion.<br>
A process for pelletizing carbon black is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,065,371 which describes a typical wet pelletization process whereby the fluffy carbon black and a liquid, typically water, are combined and agitated until spherical beads are formed. These beads are then dried to reduce the water content preferably to below 1% to form carbon black pellets.<br>
Prior art patents also disclose the use of binder additives in a wet pelletization process to further improve the pellet handling characteristics.<br>
The construction of insulated electrical conductors, i.e., wire and cables designed for medium and high voltage applications, is known in the art. Typical constructions include a core conductor which comprises one or more strands of a conducting metal or alloy such as copper or aluminum; a layer of a semiconductive shielding compound; a layer of insulation such as crosslinked polyethylene or ethylene-propylene rubber and a layer of a semiconductive insulation shield compound overlaying the insulation.<br><br>
The conductor shield, the insulation shield and the overlaying semiconductive shield layer may be formed by cither a two pass or by a single pass triple extrusion process. A two pass operation refers to a process whereby the conductor shield and the insulation layer are extruded in tandem and then crosslinked prior to extrusion of the semiconductor insulation layer. A single pass triple extrusion process refers to a process in which the conductor shield, the insulation layer and the semiconductive shield are all extruded in a common extrusion head and crosslinked simultaneously. The single pass triple extrusion process minimizes production steps and hence is a preferred method of manufacture. However, the single pass triple extrusion process generally makes the semiconductive shield layer more fully bonded to the insulation layer, than in a two pass operation.<br>
Generally, in order to splice insulated electrical wires, or make terminal connections, the semiconductive shield layer should be stripped from the insulation layer. Stripping the semiconductive shield layer from the insulation shield layer is often very difficult. In a situation where the semiconductive shield layer contains carbon black, a carbon containing residue on the surface of the insulation shield often results . The carbon residue may disadvantageous^ promote treeing in the insulation layer which will ultimately lead to electrical breakdown of the cable. It is therefore advantageous and desirable for a semiconductive shield layer to have a low strip force (be easily separable) when being removed from the insulation layer and for the semiconductive shield layer to leave minimal amounts of carbon residue on the surface of the insulation shield.<br>
Strippable conductive shield compositions are those which can be separated from a crosslinked insulation layer without leaving appreciable amounts of residue on the insulation layer. Usually, the force required to separate a strippable conductive shield composition is significantly lower than the separation force required for bonded shield compositions.<br>
There is a significant cost difference between strippable and bonded semiconductive shield compositions based on existing technological approaches. It would be advantageous, to produce more cost effective strippable formulations than those developed from the technical approaches utilized to date.<br>

present invention will be further illustrated by the following examples wherein the following testing procedures were utilized.<br>
The following testing procedures were utilized in the determination and evaluation of the analytical properties of the carbon blacks utilized in the following examples. The DBP (dibutyl phthalate adsorption value) of the carbon blacks utilized in the examples, expressed as cubic centimeters DBP per 100 grams carbon black (cc/lOOg), was determined according to the procedure set forth in ASTM D2414. The iodine number (I2No.) of the carbon blacks utilized in the examples, expressed as<br>
milligrams per gram (mg/g), was determined according to ASTM test procedure D1510.<br>
The peel force was determined by producing a plaque of the semiconductive composition utilizing a heated hydraulic press (temperature 130° C) to produce 1.2 millimeters (mm) thick plaque. A 2mm thick polyethylene plaque containing 1% dicumyl peroxide was produced in a similar manner. The two plaques were laminated together under a pressure of 100 psi and exposed to a curing cycle of 180° C for 15 minutes. The resulting laminate was allowed to cool to ambient temperature under pressure. The strip force required to delaminate the composition layer from the polyethylene layer, at a peeling angle of 180° and a separation speed of 3.94 inches/minute was recorded as peel force. The error of the test is typically +/-0.1 lb/0.5 in.<br>
The carbon blacks pellets described in the following examples were evaluated utilizing the following testing procedures. The pellets were assessed for mass pellet strength according to ASTM test procedure D1937.<br>
The dispersion of the treated carbon black compositions was determined by extruding the compositions to form a tape and measuring the number and size of surface imperfections in the tape compositions using an optical microscope at lOOx magnification and a reflected light source.<br>
The effectiveness and advantages of the present invention will be further illustrated by the following examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
Twenty seven polymer compositions, A-Z and AA, were produced utilizing three carbon blacks, CB1, CB2 and CB3 having the properties set forth in Table 1 below.<br><br>
Carbon black pellets were produced by combining the fluffy carbon black with a<br><br>
polymer emulsion, if utilized, and water, to form wet pellets, in a continuous pin pelletizer. The resultant wet pellets were dried at a temperature which was sufficient to remove the water without causing decomposition of the polymer. In these experiments, drying temperatures in the range of 120° to 180° C were found to be acceptable.<br>
The following polymer emulsions were utilized as polymer treating agents:<br>

The polymer compositions were produced by combining dry carbon black, with and without polymeric treating agent, using a Banbury mixer, with ELVAX EVA resins (manufactured and sold by DuPont Corporation, Wilmington, Delaware) to produce compositions containing 40% by weight, based on the weight of the composition, of carbon black, 0.5% by weight, based on the weight of the composition, of AGERITE MA antioxidant (manufactured and sold by R.T. Vanderbilt Company Inc.), 1.0% by weight, based on the weight of the composition, of VUL-CUP R peroxide curing agent (manufactured and sold by Hercules Inc., Wilmington, Delaware); the remainder being EVA resin and binder. The mixing temperature was maintained below 150° C to minimize premature cure of the compound.<br>
The peel force of each composition was then determined utilizing the procedure described above. The results are provided in Table 2 below<br><br><br><br>
Table 2 demonstrates the beneficial effect on reducing the strip force using treated carbon black compositions. This effect is noticeable for different polymeric binder compositions, different binder loading and different vinyl acetate containing EVA resins.<br>
Example 2<br>
This example illustrates the improved strength performance of the treated carbonaceous compositions of the present invention, utilizing carbon black as the carbonaceous material, as compared to untreated carbon black pellets.<br>
Eleven carbon black pellet compositions, BB-LL were produced utilizing CB1 from Example 1 above. Carbon black pellets compositions CC-LL were treated carbon black compositions of the present invention. Carbon black composition BB was a control carbon black pellet composition produced without a treating agent. Twenty samples of each carbon black pellet composition were produced for further evaluation.<br>
Carbon black pellets were produced by combining the fluffy carbon black with an ester polymer emulsion, if utilized, and water, to form wet pellets, in a continuous pin pelletizer. The resultant wet pellets were dried at a temperature which was sufficient to remove the water without causing decomposition of the polymer. In these experiments, drying temperatures in the range of 120° to 180° C were found to be acceptable.<br>
The ester polymer emulsions utilized were VINNAPAS LL 462 ethylene, vinyl acetate copolymer emulsion; VINNAPAS LL 870 ethylene, vinyl acetate copolymer emulsion; and VINNAPAS EAF 60 ethylene, vinyl acetate, acrylate emulsion; having the properties described in Example 1.<br>
Each of the carbon black pellets were then tested for mass pellet strength utilizing the procedure described above. The results are provided in Table 3.<br><br><br>
The results illustrate that carbon black pellet compositions of the present invention, produced utilizing an ester polymer treating agent, have enhanced pellet strength in comparison to a control carbon black pellet produced without treating agent. One of ordinary skill in the art would expect that the enhancement in strength would result in the carbon black pellet compositions of the present invention having less pellet attrition during conveying and transportation, resulting in fewer dust handling problems in subsequent process operations.<br>
Example 3<br>
This example illustrates the improved dispersion characteristics exhibited by estc polymer treated carbonaceous compositions of the present invention in polymer compositions.<br>
Five polymer compositions, MM-QQ were produced utilizing carbon black CB1 described in Example 1. Carbon black pellets were produced by combining the fluffy carbon black with, or without, a polymer emulsion and water, to form wet pellets, in a continuous pin pelletizer. The resultant wet pellets were dried at a temperature which was sufficient to remove the water without causing decomposition of the polymer. In these experiments, drying temperatures in the range of 120° to 180° C were found to tx acceptable.<br>
The ester polymer emulsions utilized were VINNAPAS LL 462 ethylene, vinyl acetate copolymer emulsion and VINNAPAS EAF 60 ethylene, vinyl acetate, acrylate emulsion having the properties described in Example 1.<br><br>
The polymer compositions were produced by combining cry carDon black was and without polymeric treating agent, using a Banbury mixer, with ELVAX EVA resins to produce compositions containing 40% by weight, based on the weight of the composition, carbon black, 0.5% by weight, based on the weight of the composition, of AGERITE MA antioxidant, 1.0% by weight, based on the weight of the composition, of VUL-CUP R peroxide curing agent; the remainder being EVA resin and binder. The mixing temperature was maintained below 150° C to minimize premature cure of the compound.<br>
The polymer compositions were extruded, utilizing a single screw extruder fitted with a slit die, to produce tapes. The surface of the tape was examined and the area of undispersed carbon black measured utilizing the test procedure described above. The results are provided in Table 4 below.<br>
Table 4 - Dispersion Characteristics<br><br>
These results illustrate that extruded polymer compositions NN, OO, PP and QQ produced utilizing a treated carbon black composition prepared with an ester polymer treating agent have a reduced percentage of undispersed carbon black in comparison to polymer composition MM, a similar extruded polymer composition produced with an untreated carbon black. One of ordinary skill in the art would expect that the improvement in dispersion quality will allow a fabricator to produce an improved extruded article.<br>
