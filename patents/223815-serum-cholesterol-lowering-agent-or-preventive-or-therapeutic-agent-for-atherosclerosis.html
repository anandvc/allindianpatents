EXAMPLE<br>
In the pharmacological experiments of this example, the compound of compound<br>
No. 56 (called compound 56 as following) and the compound of compound No. 37<br>
. (called compound 37 as following) in the above Table were used as a compound<br>

Pharmacological experiment 1<br>
The pharmacological experiment of serum cholesterol lowering action by the<br>
combination of compound 56 and atorvastatin or fenofibrate in cholesterol-fed rat.<br>
Male Splague-Dawley rats weighing 300~500g (Nihon SLC Co. Ltd.) were fed<br>
MF-2 chow (Nihon Crea Co. Ltd.) until study onset. At the study onset, the chow<br>
was changed to MF-2 chow containing 1% cholesterol and 0.5% cholic acid.<br>
Compound 56 at 0.3mg/kg, atorvastatin at lmg/kg or fenofibrate at lOmg/kg<br>
dissolved in polyethylene glycol 400 were simultaneously administered once a day<br>
for 7 days. Twenty hours after the last administration, blood was collected from the<br><br>
abdominal aorta under ether anaesthesia, and serum was separated. The<br>
cholesterol value was measured using Cholesterol E Test Wako (Wako Pure<br>
Chemical Co. Ltd.). Furthermore, the effect of combined dosage of compound 56<br>
at 0.3mg/kg and atorvastatin at lmg/kg or fenofibrate at lOmg/kg were examined<br>
similarly. The results were shown in Table 13. The experimental No. of 1~3, 4<br>
and 5 indicates the case of compound 56 alone, atrovastatin alone and fenofibrate<br>
alone, respectively. The experimental 5 and 6 indicates the combined dosage<br>
examples in the present invention. Each reduction percent is shown as the value<br>
to control.<br>
From Table 13, in the case of combined dosage compound 56 at 0.3mg/kg/day and<br>
atrovastatin lmg/kg/day (Experimental No. 6), and compound 56 at 0.3mg/kg/day<br>
and fenofibrate at l0mg/kg/day (Experimental No. 7), each reduction % of serum<br>
cholesterol value was over the sum of reduction % when each agent was<br>
administered alone (Experimental No. 2, 4 and 5), indicating synergistic effect.<br>
Pharmacological experiment 2<br>
Except of the use of compound 37 instead of compound 56, quietly same<br>
experiment to pharmacological experiment 1 was carried out. The results were<br>
shown in Table 14. Each reduction % is shown as the value to control.<br>
From Table 14, in the case of combined dosage compound 37 at 0.3mg/kg/day and<br>
atrovastatin lmg/kg/day (Experimental No. 16), and compound 37 at 0.3mg/kg/day<br>
and fenofibrate at l0mg/kg/day (Experimental No. 17), the reduction % of serum<br>
cholesterol values were over the sum of reduction % when each agent was<br>
administered alone (Experimental No. 12, 14 and 15), indicating synergistic effect.<br>
