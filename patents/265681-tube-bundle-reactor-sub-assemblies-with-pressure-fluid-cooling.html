				<td>Tube bundle reactors with pressure fluid cooling.<br>
The present invention relates to a set of prefabricated tube bundle reactor subassemblies devised<br>
for assembly at a construction site to form a tube bundle reactor for carrying out catalytic gas<br>
phase and/or liquid phase reactions. The present invention also relates to a tube bundle reactor as<br>
defined in the precharacterizing part of claim 21 and an arrangement of tube bundle reactors as<br>
defined in the pre-characterizing part of claim 30.<br>
Tube bundle reactors comprise a plurality of parallel reactor tubes which are arranged in a tube<br>
bundle and into which catalyst material, usually of granular nature is filled. If desired, the reactor<br>
tubes also may be filled with inert material or variously combined and arranged catalyst and inert<br>
materials. The tube bundle is surrounded by a reactor shell, usually a cylindrical one. The ends of<br>
the reactor tubes are open and firmly positioned in tube sheets with their outer walls in sealing<br>
engagement with the tube sheets. The reaction gas mixture (feed gas) is supplied to the reactor<br>
tubes through a reactor head which spans the respective tube sheet. It is discharged as product gas<br>
mixture through another reactor head spanning the other tube sheet.<br>
In a widely used system for dissipating heat of reaction generated in a tube bundle reactor during<br>
exothermal reactions a liquid heat carrier, such as heat carrier oil or a mixture of nitrate or nitrite<br>
salts, is passed through the reactor by circulation means so that it will flow around the outside of<br>
the reactor tubes, either in a concurrent flow or as a countercurrent to the flow of reaction gas<br>
mixture. Such a system is advantageous in that it offers operation which is practically<br>
pressureless and, as a consequence, the thickness of walls can be kept relatively thin even in big<br>
reactors. Suitable flow guide means ensure good and uniform dissipation of heat throughout the<br>
reactor cross section.<br>
Another system of dissipating heat of reaction is by way of pressure fluid cooling, often<br>
performed as cooling by evaporation, such as cooling by boiling water. In this case the heat<br>
carrier system is operated under pressure, using fluids in forced or natural circulation that<br>
evaporate partly, fully, or not at all. The preferred fluid is water. As used here, the terms "boiling<br><br>
water cooling" and "boiling water reactor" are merely examples of "cooling by evaporation" and<br>
"tube bundle reactor with evaporative cooling", respectively, and are not to be understood as<br>
restrictive.<br>
With cooling by evaporation, the heat of reaction is dissipated by making use of it to evaporate<br>
part of the heat carrier. The resulting liquid-steam-mixture rises due to its low density and is<br>
passed out of the reactor to be split thereafter in a separator into a liquid phase and a steam phase.<br>
The liquid phase is returned to the reactor, while the steam phase can be utilized directly as<br>
working steam without any need for another heat carrier circuit. It is an essential advantage of<br>
this system that, at a given constant pressure, the temperature is the same everywhere in the heat<br>
carrier system as long a liquid heat carrier is present and the walls of the reactor tubes are in<br>
contact with the same. Morever, very good heat transfer is obtained at the outer tube walls so that<br>
expenditure is negligible for flow improvement installations to enhance uniform distribution of<br>
the heat carrier. As the heat carrier evaporates in part only, the walls of the reactor tubes remain<br>
in constant contact with liquid heat carrier, whereby local overheating is avoided. Various<br>
embodiments of this type of structure are described, for example, in US 3,518,284, DE 2 013<br>
297, DE 2 123 950, DE 2 420 949, DE 30 28 646, and EP 0 532 325.<br>
For economic reasons, the aims with tube bundle reactors of the kind mentioned are to obtain<br>
large capacities, i.e. the greatest possible number of tubes and maximum useful tube volume to<br>
accommodate catalyst filling. Some reactor types require tube lengths in the order of 10 to 15<br>
meters. Yet the desired capacity enlargement is subject to limitations imposed by the<br>
transportation environment. True, it has become possible by now to move relatively light<br>
apparatus with diameters of some 10 to 11 meters by road but, as a rule, shipment by road or rail<br>
of reactors equipped with tubes and having diameters of more than 4 to 5 meters over greater<br>
distances is impossible or forbids itself for reasons of cost. That is so, on the one hand, because of<br>
limited vertical and/or horizontal clearances or weight restrictions of bridges and the like and, on<br>
the other hand, the lack of suitable hoisting equipment at the place of reloading or the final site of<br>
erection.<br><br>
Therefore, transportation of very big or very heavy reactors in parts to the construction site and<br>
assembly at the place of erection are desirable. At the same time, it is just as desirable to build the<br>
most compact tube bundle reactors which, however, still are such as to be suited for<br>
shipment in fully assembled state. As regards the first aspect, existing limitations of fabrication at<br>
a construction site make it imperative to determine the limits of weights and dimensions of<br>
individual reactor elements that will just stay within keeping of the limits imposed by<br>
transportation. In that way, the number of joints and seams can be kept as small as possible.<br>
It should be noted also that it is very uneconomical and time consuming to equip the reactor with<br>
tubing at the construction site only, i.e. to thread the reactor tubes into the tube sheets and seal<br>
them to the tube sheets. In addition, in most cases it will not be possible to accomplish this at the<br>
site for lack of proper fabrication conditions and adequate quality assurance. Besides, the<br>
problems of dimensioning still would remain unresolved.<br>
In the description below, designs will be discussed which relate to assembling a reactor. In<br>
particular, this will relate to reactors devised for assembly at the construction site or reactors<br>
composed of specifically defined subassemblies. Moreover, reactors will be described that are<br>
particularly compact and also reactor units that are combinations of a plurality of smaller<br>
reactors!<br>
A tube bundle reactor to be put together at the construction site is specified, for instance, in DE<br>
25 43 758 C3. It comprises at least two independent sectors with associated tube sheet sectors,<br>
outer shell sections, and inner wall sections including reactor tubes disposed inside the same, the<br>
respective walls of the sectors being mutually propped by spacer elements.<br>
The invidual sectors of such a tube bundle reactor can be tested for operability while still at the<br>
place of manufacture prior to being shipped because the reactor tubes will have been installed and<br>
the walls surrounding the reactor tubes define a tightly sealed space all around. It is at the<br>
erection site only that the sectors and the heads, the tube connections and the supports will be<br>
connected to one another, in the first place by welding procedures, to complete the tube bundle<br>
reactor.<br><br>
This type of sectoral structure is suitable for operations in which the liquid heat carrier used is not<br>
under pressure and does not evaporate. The heat carrier space in this case is operated practically<br>
without pressure so that the thickness of the vessel walls essentially is determined by<br>
their own weight rather than by internal pressure. If such a tube bundle reactor were devised as a<br>
boiling water reactor, with a pressurized evaporating medium acting as heat carrier, the wall<br>
thickness of the reactor shell clearly would have to be greater for reasons of rigidity. Such a<br>
reactor is not suitable for the sectoral construction known from DE 25 43 758 C3. The main<br>
obstacle resides in the heat treatment after welding to which component parts with thick walls<br>
must be subjected in order to release internal tensions generated in the material by the welding<br>
process. Local heat treatment of the longitudinal connecting shell seams, that would be required<br>
with a boiling water tube bundle reactor according to DE 25 43 758 C3 delivered to the job site as<br>
several independent units having tubes already installed in them, is out of the question because of<br>
the differential thermal expansions between the reactor shell and the reactor tubes.<br>
Further disadvantages of the sectoral construction are caused by the fact that the individual<br>
sectors dispose of quite a number of planar walls which either must be made unduly thick in view<br>
of the pressures prevailing inside the sectors or be reinforced by struts or some other kind of<br>
costly support. In addition, tension peaks caused by the internal pressure in the interior of the<br>
sector occur at the transitions between individual walls. Reactor tubes cannot be disposed in the<br>
central region of the reactor to utilize this region for reactions. Moreover, it must be sealed with<br>
respect to the upper and low reactor heads. The whole structure suffers from sealing problems<br>
and is susceptible to tension cracks, especially so if operated periodically and under frequently<br>
changing operating conditions, respectively.<br>
EP 1 210 976 A2 describes the use of mechanical connector elements for assembling a tube sheet<br>
consisting of a plurality of tube sheet parts of a tube bundle apparatus. At the location of the<br>
joints, the tube sheet parts have complementary contours presented, for instance, as grooves and<br>
tongues which are secured to each other by pins extending through the grooves and tongues. To<br>
obtain a tight connection, the joint and the pin contours are welded together at both sides of the<br>
tube sheet. The essential advantages which this design is said to offer are smaller production<br>
machines, shorter production times, and clearly less distortion in comparison with fully welded<br>
connections throughout. Careful preparation is needed at the points of contact in such a structure.<br><br>
If the play is too great at the groove and tongue joint the transmission of force from one tube<br>
sheet part to another is reduced. If the play is too small pinching results and the parts cannot be<br>
joined. The bores to receive the connecting pins cannot be made until after the parts have been<br>
put together. Recesses must be formed at the counter-contours of edges so that these will not<br>
pinch. The tubes cannot be introduced and fixed in the tube sheet until after the connection has<br>
been completed. The fabrication process, therefore, must be performed at the manufacturing<br>
plant. Assembling the tube sheet parts at the job site makes little sense.<br>
DE 1 667 187 C describes a solid bed, high pressure reactor for exothermal catalytic reactions<br>
with repeated intermediate cooling among a plurality of catalyst beds. The special feature of this<br>
reactor is a tube bundle evaporator serving as cooler. It is subdivided, arranged in the middle of<br>
the reactor, and fastened by its tube plate on the reactor head, preferably such that it can be pulled<br>
out. Having passed the reactor, the product gas exits from the reactor through a central opening in<br>
the tube plate of the first internal heat exchanger and a downstream outlet nozzle. The diameter of<br>
this type of reactor is limited due to the necessary thick walls which are needed because of the<br>
high process pressures. In this respect, therefore, a reactor described in the embodiment as having<br>
an inner diameter of 2.2 m presumably will present the upper limit. With diameters greater than<br>
that, a planar plate likewise could not be realized to serve as reactor head because of the great<br>
thickness needed. This would be even less feasible if, regardless of its shape, the reactor head<br>
were weakened by a plurality of passages for heat exchanger tube bundles. As diameters become<br>
greater, furthermore, a detachable flange connection becomes ever more problematic because of<br>
the size of the flanges and screws needed. Moreover, with greater diameters it remains<br>
unresolved how to transmit the weight load from the combination of catalyst bed and heat<br>
exchanger to the reactor shell. The requirements as to rigidity will not be met by a small<br>
projection provided within the reactor shell to serve as bearing surface, as illustrated in the<br>
embodiment, nor by the thin mounting plate at the top of the combination of catalyst bed and heat<br>
exchanger. The proposed structure is not suitable for final assembly at the construction site if the<br>
diameters of reactors are great.<br>
DE 28 16 062 A1 describes a methanization reactor comprising a combination of solid bed and<br>
heat exchanger suspended in the reactor shell. Cooling of the reaction gas is effected exclusively<br>
by the cool feed gas entering. The entire weight load of the combination of solid bed and heat<br><br>
exchanger is accommodated by an upper mounting plate which is supported on and connected by<br>
screws to the upper end of the cylindrical reactor shell. A detachable screw connection<br>
interconnects the upper reactor head and the reactor shell. Product gas is led out of the reactor by<br>
an outlet duct which is sealed towards the reactor shell by a stuffing box. Compensation which<br>
would take care of different expansions in length of the cold reactor shell and the hot<br>
combination of solid bed and heat exchanger is not provided for. It is conceivable to disassemble<br>
the structure shown into its major elements, namely the reactor shell with the lower reactor head<br>
and the combination of solid bed and heat exchanger with the upper reactor head, and then ship<br>
them separately to the place of erection where they would be built together. The structure,<br>
however, is limited as to diameter for similar reasons as the solid bed, high pressure reactor<br>
known from DE 1 667 187 C. For this reason, separate shipments of individual parts to the job<br>
site and subsequent assembly there are not required. Moreover, the reactor has but one pressure<br>
space so that the design principle is not suited for application to a tube bundle reactor having<br>
separate reaction and heat carrier spaces.<br>
Likewise known are tube bundle reactors whose tube bundle, mounted according to the floating<br>
head principle, can be taken out. The floating head principle provides for the tube sheet of one<br>
tube bundle end to be rigidly connected to the shell of the apparatus, whereas the other tube sheet<br>
is movable more or less freely. The tube bundle may be disposed either standing vertically<br>
upright or suspended, or it may be lying horizontally. A great number of variants of this design<br>
principle are specified in the respective standards, such as ASME, AD2000, or TEMA. The<br>
variants, in the first place, are concerned with how to direct the tube-side fluid out of the tube<br>
bundle. In the case of the free floating head, the tube-side fluid is deflected at the tube end so as<br>
to flow back in opposite direction. In its return flow, the tube-side fluid normally has a<br>
temperature which differs from the flow when entering and, therefore, compensation in length<br>
must be provided in the return line. The configuration of a U-tube bundle is an exception in that<br>
lengthwise compensation is effected by the U-tube bundle itself. Yet the tube-side fluid also may<br>
be passed on in the same direction through an outlet duct which leads out of the shell of the<br>
apparatus at the other end. Specifically in this case, lengthwise compensation must be provided at<br>
a suitable location.<br><br>
DE 27 58 131 describes a tube bundle reactor which is used preferably for endothermal<br>
processes.The heat carrier, for example, is a heating gas which is guided around the reactor tubes<br>
by ring or disc-shaped deflector plates. The tube bundle is represented by a standing tube bundle<br>
with a floating head. An expansion joint is built into the connecting line between the<br>
floating head and the upper reactor head. The connecting line terminates at a flange in the upper<br>
reactor head, and a reactor outlet line is connected to this flange. The upper reactor head also is<br>
attached to the cylindrical reactor shell by a flange connection. A separate tube sheet head is<br>
connected to the lower tube sheet. A lower connecting line leads from the lower tube sheet head<br>
to the outlet nozzle of the lower reactor head and is welded to the same by its end. For exchange<br>
of the tube bundle, first the screw connections of the upper reactor outlet line and the upper<br>
reactor head are undone. Next, the welded connection of the lower connecting line is broken,<br>
whereupon the tube bundle can be withdrawn in upward direction. Upon completion of the<br>
maintenance or repair work, the reactor is reassembled in the opposite sequence. Although the<br>
reactor described is quite easy to dismantle, it still has the fundamental disadvantages of a<br>
floating head design. The tube side of the reactor is not sealed directly with respect to the<br>
surroundings but instead towards a second pressure space. That, of course, results in a more<br>
expensive structure, and the interior pressure envelope suffers additional strain from the<br>
surrounding medium and the pressure and temperature thereof.<br>
A tube bundle reactor having a floating head implemented in suspended form is known from US<br>
5,006,131 B. It forms part of the reactor system described in that publication. An upper reactor<br>
head having gas outlet nozzles is connected to the edge of the upper tube sheet. The upper reactor<br>
head further includes a manhole nozzle. A cylindrical shell connected in downward direction to<br>
the edge of the upper tube sheet merges at its lower end into a lower reactor head. At their lower<br>
ends, the reactor tubes open into a floating head consisting of a lower tube sheet and a lower tube<br>
sheet head. An outlet line leads from the lower tube sheet head through the lower reactor head<br>
and out of the reactor. The outlet line is connected to the lower reactor head by an expansion joint<br>
located outside of the reactor. A heat carrier enters the reactor at one side and leaves it at the<br>
other, while ring or disc-shaped deflector plates guide it as it flows through the reactor, always<br>
vertically with respect to the tubes in order to enhance the heat transfer. This type of reactor is not<br>
suited for final assembly at the site of its erection because several thick sheets must be welded<br>
together. The preferred number of tubes is small, being indicated as 250 and 1000 in US patent<br><br>
5,006,131 B. Additionally, the observations made in the discussions above of DE 1 667 187 C<br>
regarding the problems of greater reactor diameters and of DE 27 58 131 regarding the<br>
disadvantages of a floating head design apply here as well.<br>
DT 25 13 499 A1 describes a reforming oven which functions by heat convection and a system<br>
provided with such an oven to produce gas rich in hydrogen or synthetic gas. In principle, the<br>
reforming oven or reactor may be used in addition for many other applications. In the case of the<br>
embodiment specified, the reforming oven, referred to below as reactor, includes a multipart tube<br>
sheet to which a bundle of reactor tubes are attached. At their lower ends, the reactor tubes open<br>
into a central pipe which extends upwardly and further on through the upper reactor head to the<br>
outside of the reactor. The tube sheet, including the reactor tubes suspended from it, is fixed<br>
radially inwardly by a strong welded connection to the central pipe through which the product gas<br>
leaves the reactor, and at its outer peripheral edge it is connected by an elongate carrying member<br>
to the lower part of the upper reactor head. The elongate carrying member is relatively elastic and<br>
thus able to compensate differential radial expansions of the cylindrical shell, upper reactor head,<br>
and upper tube sheet. Such movements are intended to be reduced by an insulating layer within<br>
the multipart upper tube sheet. Since the upper reactor head is flange-connected to the major<br>
cylindrical reactor part it is easy to pull the upper reactor head out of the reactor, along with the<br>
tube sheet and reactor tubes. The design described is suitable only for small and medium reactor<br>
diameters because the entire tube bundle is suspended mainly by the central pipe. The elongate<br>
carrying member between the tube sheet and the upper reactor head can accommodate only minor<br>
forces. Separate shipment and later joining of individual reactor groups at the job site would seem<br>
to be conceivable. But to fill the tubes with granular catalyst material and, above all, to empty<br>
them again would be difficult, if at all to be fully accomplished.<br>
A structure designed for multiple length compensation is known from EP 1 048 343 A2 which<br>
describes a tube bundle reactor having the upper ends of the reactor tubes fastened individually<br>
by expansion joints to an upper tube sheet. The lower ends of the reactor tubes are firmly<br>
connected to a lower tube sheet. The lower tube sheet is enclosed by a head to which a nozzle is<br>
connected. This nozzle in turn (at its other end) is connected to the lower reactor outlet nozzle by<br>
an expansion joint which is disposed still inside the reactor. The welding must meet high<br>
demands where an individual reactor tube is to be connected to a tube sheet with the aid of an<br><br>
expansion joint. It makes sense only to accomplish this kind of work at a manufacturing plant.<br>
Fabrication at the place of erection practically is excluded. Also, dividing the tube bundles<br>
including the tube sheets secured to them causes problems since the expansion joints are highly<br>
sensitive and could be damaged during transportation.<br>
With the aim to provide a compact reactor unit, it is suggested as a possibility in EP 1 590 076<br>
A1, for example, that on entering a tube bundle reactor devised for partial evaporation of a heat<br>
carrier, the latter be distributed uniformly around the reactor circumference by interior annular<br>
channels. In this way the number of conduits outside of the reactor is reduced to a minimum. But<br>
still, nozzles are needed radially at the circumference of the reactor shell and, as a consequence,<br>
the overall dimensions of the reactor for shipment are enlarged. This type of reactor is not<br>
suitable to be dismantled into several subassemblies for shipment.<br>
DT 1 542 494 C3 describes a tube bundle reactor in which liquid salt is used as heat carrier. The<br>
heat carrier gives off heat which it has taken up in the tube bundle reactor through laterally<br>
protruding conduits in a heat exchanger disposed outside of the reactor, e.g. embodied by a steam<br>
generator, to be returned later into the reactor. A particular characteristic of this tube bundle<br>
reactor is the arrangement of the reactor tubes in a plurality of tube bundle sectors between which<br>
there are passageways which are free of tubes. One passageway is somewhat larger than the<br>
others so that, in addition, it can house an inlet line to the heat exchanger and an outlet line from<br>
the heat exchanger. A guide duct including a built-in impeller is disposed centrally in the tube<br>
bundle reactor and driven by an electric motor. The major part of the heat carrier conveyed<br>
downwardly by the impeller enters the space between the lower tube sheet and an orifice plate<br>
located above the same and is then distributed uniformly throughout the entire reactor cross<br>
section by means of the passageways and the orifice plate. This major amount flows upwardly<br>
around the reactor tubes and, having passed through an upper orifice plate, reenters the guide duct<br>
at the top. The residual amount of heat carrier flows through an inlet line into the heat exchanger<br>
where it gives off the heat it had taken up and flows back to the tube bundle reactor through a<br>
return line into the inlet of the central guide duct. A remarkable detail of this design is the<br>
distribution and collection, respectively, of the heat carrier centrally in the interior of the reactor,<br>
whereby expensive valve means, annular channels, and specifically devised windows for entry<br>
into the interior of the reactor can be dispensed with.<br><br>
WO 2004/004884 A1 suggests a reactor system and a reactor arrangement, respectively, in which<br>
a plurality of reactor units are operated in parallel like a single reactor, dispensing with individual<br>
measuring and control means. These reactor units are operated with a common heat carrier<br>
system, preferably applying boiling water cooling in a natural circulation layout. The reaction gas<br>
is supplied through one or more conduits to two or more reactor units. For the product there is<br>
one withdrawal or several ones in common. It is preferred to use tube bundle reactors, the reactor<br>
tubes being filled with catalyst. The reactor system presented in the document offers a solution<br>
for achieving the efficiency of a very big reactor and profiting from the transportability of the<br>
individual reactors for assembling the reactor system.<br>
It is, indeed, a widely applied principle in process engineering to connect several smaller units in<br>
parallel to obtain one bigger unit. As a rule, however, this has the disadvantage of requiring<br>
expensive distribution and collection systems and the associated piping and nozzles for supply<br>
and discharge of the reaction gases and heat carrier fluids to and from the individual units.<br>
Furthermore, each one of the smaller units must provide accessibility toward its interior, such as<br>
for catalyst replacement. Connections in parallel also involve extra expenditure caused, for<br>
instance, by supporting of the units, mutual compensation of thermal expansions, insulation,<br>
space requirement, and the surrounding steel structures. No measures are indicated in WO<br>
2004/004884 A1 for minimizing the additional expenditure involved with connections in parallel<br>
so that it might be possible to come up with solutions which are economical.<br>
In chemical production plants on an industrial scale it is often desired, for economic reasons, to<br>
have one big tube bundle reactor unit with as many reactor tubes as possible. But the dimensions<br>
and/or weight of big tube bundle reactors surpass the limits of transportability. Known designs of<br>
subassemblies are not suitable for tube bundle reactors with pressure fluid cooling. Besides, it is<br>
desirable, again for reasons of shipment but also for ease of assembly, that such tube bundle<br>
reactors or tube bundle reactor arrangements be compact in structure and able to function without<br>
a lot of accessory equipment.<br><br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a tube bundle reactor unit with<br>
pressure fluid cooling and great capacity for catalytic gas and/or liquid phase reactions, and not<br>
having its capacity limited by problems of transportation and/or assembly.<br>
This object is met, in accordance with the invention, by a set of prefabricated tube bundle reactor<br>
subassemblies as defined in claim 1.<br>
The object also is met, with a tube bundle reactor of the kind specified initially, by the<br>
characterizing features of claim 21.<br>
Furthermore, the object is met, with an arrangement of the kind specified initially, by the<br>
characterizing features of claim 30.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention are recited in the subclaims.<br>
By the measures of the invention, tube bundle reactor units with pressure fluid cooling are<br>
rendered shippable, which have greater capacities than tube bundle reactor units which could be<br>
transported up to now with their given dimensions and/or weights. Moreover, they are allowed to<br>
be assembled under conditions prevailing at construction sites while, at the same time, meeting<br>
quality requirements in correspondence with those of complete fabrication and mounting at the<br>
manufacturer's.<br>
When "conditions prevailing at the construction site" are mentioned in the specification of the<br>
present invention, this expression is to be understood as meaning that welding of thick sheets<br>
measuring more than 38 mm in wall thickness, such as tube sheets, is excluded in view of the fact<br>
heat treatment of such sheets is mandatory under the regulations in force at present. As, for<br>
example, the tube sheets come with reactor tubes already inserted and fixed by welding, heat<br>
treatment of the tube sheets forbids itself.<br>
Nothing but subassemblies which are separate from the reactor shell and the reactor heads make<br>
up a tube bundle with tube sheets attached thereto in a set of prefabricated tube bundle reactor<br>
subassemblies according to the invention. In other words, the reactor shell and the reactor heads<br><br>
form subassemblies which include no parts at all of the tube bundle and tube sheets. In this way,<br>
the reactor shell and the reactor heads can be assembled alone at first at the construction site, if<br>
necessary, and thus there will be no risk that the tube bundle and tube sheets become affected by<br>
welding seams which must be applied when mounting the reactor shell and the reactor heads. The<br>
thicknesses of the reactor shell and the reactor heads, as a rule, are such that heat treatment must<br>
be applied following the welding step. Any adjacent or nearby tube sheets would become<br>
deformed by such heat treatment in the vicinity, and they in turn then would have to undergo heat<br>
treatment. That, however, cannot be performed at the construction site nor justified for economic<br>
reasons.<br>
The reactor shell and one reactor head, for example, the lower reactor head, thus form at least one<br>
shell/head subassembly, while the other reactor head, for example, the upper reactor head forms<br>
at least one head subassembly. At least one of these subassemblies comprises supporting means<br>
for the at least one or each tube bundle subassembly, respectively, to provide vertical support for<br>
tube bundle subassemblies. Yet the joining of tube bundle and tube sheet, respectively, with the<br>
reactor shell and reactor heads does not require any subsequent heat treatment of the parts that<br>
have become united. Preferred embodiments of the tube bundle subassemblies are specified in<br>
subclaims 2 to 6 and shown in fig. 4. Examples of structural implementations of such connections<br>
and vertical supports, respectively, are recited in subclaims 7 to 12 and 14 to 17 and illustrated in<br>
figs. 2a-d, 5a+b, and 6a-d.<br>
Moreover, according to the invention the at least one shell/head subassembly and/or the tube<br>
sheets are provided with sealing means to become tightly fastened to the reactor shell and the<br>
tube sheets, respectively, at the sides of the tube sheets remote from the reactor tubes and/or the<br>
peripheral edges. The sealing means are designed and arranged such that their fastening, on the<br>
one hand, can be made pressure tight and, on the other hand, does not require subjecting the tube<br>
sheets subsequently to heat treatment. Examples of the structural implementation of such sealing<br>
means are indicated in claims 8 to 20 and shown in figs. 2a-d and 3a-d. A pressure vessel or<br>
pressure space, therefore, can be formed, under conditions at the construction site, between tube<br>
sheets and the reactor shell and thus also a second pressure space results between the tube sheets,<br>
the reactor heads, and the reactor tubes once the tube bundle subassembly(ies) has/have been<br>
introduced into the shell/head subassembly. In other words, two pressure spaces are obtained<br><br>
which are directly sealed off from the surroundings. Thereby, a floating head solution with the<br>
considerable expenditure this involves is avoided.<br>
When all the subassemblies have been combined the distance of the parting line, i.e. the assembly<br>
welding seam between the shell/head subassembly and the head subassembly, from the closest<br>
tube sheet can be smaller than with conventional structures because the thermal loading caused<br>
by the heat treatment of the assembly welding seam can be transmitted to the tube sheet to a<br>
limited extent only by the sealing means.<br>
The tube bundle subassemblies are supported vertically on supporting means provided at the<br>
reactor shell and/or they rest on supporting means, such as radially extending ribs or a central<br>
bearing ring. The ribs may extend along the edges of division of the tube bundle subassemblies or<br>
in the inner area of the tube sheet portions thereof. The tube bundle subassemblies may be<br>
supported at the lower and/or upper tube sheet sectors. It is likewise conceivable to provide the<br>
tube sheet portions at their edges of division with vertical flanges which are screwed together to<br>
offer stiffness against forces and moments. In any case, the tube sheet portions of the tube bundle<br>
subassemblies are welded to one another or to the supporting means exclusively by mounting<br>
sealing weld seams so that it is not necessary to subject the tube sheet portions to heat treatment<br>
after the welding procedure.<br>
As a set of in accordance with the invention prefabricated tube bundle reactor subassemblies thus<br>
can be assembled under conditions prevailing at the construction site, a tube bundle reactor is<br>
offered which meets the quality standards to be expected of a tube bundle reactor fully assembled<br>
at the works, as regards welding technique, process technology, and handling. The subassemblies<br>
of the tube bundle reactor also may be fabricated at different places and then shipped separately<br>
to the specific job site.<br>
The essential steps taken for assembly at the construction site begin with, if any, welding and<br>
heat treating shell sections and shell subassemblies, respectively, and the lower head. Thereafter,<br>
the tube bundle subassemblies are introduced individually into the reactor shell and connected to<br>
each other and to the reactor shell. Finally, the upper head is connected to the reactor shell. It is<br><br>
no problem, here, to weld and heat treat the respective weld seams since the upper tube sheet has<br>
no direct contact with this assembly welding seam.<br>
The steps of preparing and assembling a set of in accordance with the invention prefabricated<br>
tube bundle reactor subassemblies will be described in greater detail below.<br>
The following subassemblies, for instance, may be prepared at the works for their final assembly,<br>
i.e. with the welding processes and heat treatment completed:<br>
a plurality of tube bundle subassemblies the reactor tubes of which are welded to the<br>
associated tube sheet portions, wherein the lower and/or upper tube sheet portions<br>
comprise sealing means for connection to the reactor shell;<br>
a lower reactor head, including nozzles, a support skirt connection facility, a cylindrical<br>
connector piece, tube sheet supporting means (e.g. ribs), a bearing ring for tube sheet<br>
portions or parts thereof, a supply duct for heat carrier;<br>
a plurality of subassemblies of the reactor shell sections, some equipped with sealing<br>
means to be connected to a tube sheet;<br>
upper reactor head, including nozzles;<br>
steam outlet with expansion joint;<br>
support skirt base member.<br>
All the subassemblies prepared at the works and ready for assembly are shipped to the<br>
construction site where stepwise mounting will be carried out, for instance, as follows:<br>
The first shell section is welded to the lower reactor head in horizontal alignment.<br>
One after the other, the next shell sections are mounted in the same alignment and<br>
connected by welding.<br>
The support skirt base member is mounted and welded to the support skirt connection<br>
facility of the shell/head subassembly, finished but still lying.<br>
The shell/head subassembly, including the support skirt base member connected to it, is<br>
heat treated as a whole.<br>
The shell/head subassembly, including the support skirt base member is erected vertically<br>
on a foundation and fixed to it.<br><br>
The individual tube bundle subassemblies are introduced into the reactor shell and the<br>
lower reactor head and positioned on the supporting means.<br>
The individual tube bundle subassemblies are welded tightly to the reactor shell and to the<br>
heat carrier supply duct as well as amongst each other.<br>
The steam outlet, including the expansion joint is fitted into and welded to the upper tube<br>
sheet.<br>
The upper reactor head is welded to the uppermost shell section and to the steam outlet<br>
and then submitted to heat treatment.<br>
The sequence of the individual mounting steps may be changed depending on local circumstances<br>
and specific requirements.<br>
According to the invention, the object of providing transportable tube bundle reactors of great<br>
capacity is met also by a tube bundle reactor which, while offering the same capacity as known<br>
transportable reactors, is more compact in design. Or, in other words, its capacity is greater if it<br>
has the same dimensions as the known reactors mentioned. According to claim 21, that is<br>
achieved by the invention in that at least one pipe for supplying and/or discharging the heat<br>
carrier extends in axial direction through a tube sheet. Therefore, a feed and/or discharge duct<br>
extending in radial direction through the reactor shell is superfluous. Consequently the radial<br>
dimensions of the tube bundle reactor are reduced substantially.<br>
If it is desired to increase the capacity of such a tube bundle reactor to an extent that would render<br>
it no longer transportable as a reactor in finally assembled state ex works, the design according to<br>
the invention permits the tube bundle reactor specifically to be divided into a set according to the<br>
invention which consists of prefabricated tube bundle reactor subassemblies. This is possible<br>
because the feed pipes or discharge pipes passing through the tube sheets may be designed to<br>
function simultaneously as vertical supporting means for tube bundle subassemblies. For details,<br>
reference is made to the description above of the vertical support of tube bundle subassemblies.<br>
Once joined at the construction site, the tube bundle subassemblies form a common functional<br>
unit which is surrounded by a common heat carrier space. The liquid heat carrier entering the<br>
space inside the shell, preferably, is distributed uniformly and/or collected through passageways<br><br>
which are free of tubes and extend in especially preferred star-like fashion away from the feed<br>
pipe and/or discharge pipe of the heat carrier. Further measures may be taken to distribute the<br>
liquid heat carrier entering the space inside the shell, as known in the art.<br>
Moreover, a discharge pipe for the liquid-steam mixture extending through the upper tube sheet,<br>
in the case of an at least partly evaporating heat carrier, may readily function as support for a<br>
steam drum disposed above the upper reactor head. In this manner, the building space<br>
requirement for the steam drum is reduced, as no means are required to provide support at the<br>
outside of the reactor shell.<br>
In preferred embodiments, only one feed pipe and/or only one discharge pipe may be provided<br>
centrally, or two or more feed pipes and/or discharge pipes may be arranged in decentralized<br>
manner symmetrically with respect to the reactor axis. In any case, they may be devised as<br>
supporting means for the tube bundle subassemblies.<br>
As far as the arrangement of the kind specified initially is concerned, the object of providing a<br>
transportable tube bundle reactor unit of great capacity is met, according to the invention, by the<br>
characterizing features of claim 30. As the gas inlet and gas outlet heads of adjacent tube bundle<br>
reactors each are interconnected by short piping, the tube bundle reactors do not each need an<br>
external gas supply line and gas discharge line of their own. That permits the tube bundle reactors<br>
to be positioned very close together. Moreover, a common steam drum is disposed above the<br>
upper reactor heads in such a way as to be in fluid communication with each tube bundle reactor,<br>
i.e. with the respective pressure vessel for the heat carrier. On the whole, the arrangement<br>
requires distinctly less building space laterally of the tube bundle reactors, i.e. in horizontal<br>
direction, than known arrangements as it benefits from the measures of the invention.<br>
As regards dimensions and weights, each individual tube bundle reactor may be layed out so that<br>
it can leave the works and still be transportable as a fully assembled tube bundle reactor. At the<br>
construction site, individual tube bundle reactors will be united to form the arrangement<br>
according to the invention and thus present a composite reactor unit of great capacity.<br><br>
With a preferred embodiment, the cross sectional size of the gas supply pipes and gas discharge<br>
pipes as well as of the short interconnecting pipes between the reactor heads is chosen to be the<br>
same as of a manhole. This guarantees accessibility of the reactor heads by persons to carry out<br>
maintenance or repair work. No separate access nozzle is needed at each reactor head.<br>
Advantageously, the steam drum is connected to each tube bundle reactor by at least one riser and<br>
by downcomers. Also these risers serve as supports for the steam drum. The downcomers can<br>
convey the liquid heat carrier from the steam drum directly back to the tube bundle reactors.<br>
As a favorable further development of the invention, all the tube bundle reactors are secured to<br>
one another to provide one mechanical unit, standing on a common base structure. In another<br>
preferred embodiment, all the tube bundle reactors are surrounded by a common insulating shell.<br>
These measures help to keep expenditures low for fastening and supporting measures as well as<br>
insulation means of the tube bundle reactors.<br>
Preferably, all the tube bundle reactors in an arrangement according to the invention are tube<br>
bundle reactors of the kind specified above.<br>

Fig. la shows an embodiment of a set 1 according to the invention of prefabricated tube bundle<br>
reactor subassemblies 2, 3, 4 which can be fitted together to form the tube bundle reactor 5 shown<br>
in fig. 1b.<br>
The tube bundle reactor 5, as fully mounted, may be layed out for catalytic exothermal or<br>
endothermal gas and/or liquid reactions to be performed. It comprises a bundle 6 of vertical<br>
reactor tubes 7 filled with catalyst. The upper ends 8 of the reactor tubes 7 are fastened in an<br>
upper tube sheet 9 in pressure tight manner, i.e. also tight against gas and liquid. The lower ends<br>
10 of the reactor tubes 7 are tightly fastened in a lower tube sheet 11. The reactor tubes 7 extend<br>
through the respective tube sheets 9, 11 preferably as far as the surfaces or sides 12, 13 thereof<br>
remote from the reactor tubes 7. The ends 8, 10 of the reactor tubes 7 are open and welded at<br>
their faces or outer sides 14 to the tube sheets 9, 11.<br>
As a rule, the outer diameters of the reactor tubes 7 lie in a range between 15 mm and 60 mm and<br>
the wall thicknesses between 1 mm and 3 mm. The preferred lengths of the reactor tubes 7 used<br>
with this invention lie in a range between 6 m and 15 m. The figs. do not show the lengths and<br>
diameters true to scale.<br>
The tube bundle 6 is enclosed in a cylindrical reactor shell 15 which is pressure tightly connected<br>
to the tube sheets 9, 11. Reference numeral 16 designates the central axis. The reactor shell 15<br>
and the tube sheets 9, 11 together thus form a pressure vessel 17. By its peripheral edge 18, the<br>
lower tube sheet 11 rests on a supporting means 19, embodied by a bearing ring 19a in figs. 1 a<br>
and 1b, which is fastened to the inside wall 20 of the reactor shell 15. The upper tube sheet 9 is<br>
supported exclusively by the reactor tubes 7 and, therefore, axially movable.<br>
The reactor shell 15 comprises radially extending inlet nozzles 21 and outlet nozzles 22 for a<br>
liquid heat carrier 23. The heat carrier 23 is fed under pressure into the pressure vessel 17 formed<br>
by the reactor shell 15 and the tube sheets 9, 11 and, while flowing around the reactor tubes 7, it<br>
may partly evaporate. The heat carrier 23 exits through the outlet nozzles 22.<br><br>
Each tube sheet 9, 11 is spanned by a reactor head 24, 25 which is in fluid communication with<br>
the reactor tubes 7 through the open ends 8, 10 thereof. One of the reactor heads 24, 25, in the<br>
example shown the lower one 25, forms a gas inlet head, while the other reactor head 24 is the<br>
gas outlet head. The reactor heads 25, 24 of the embodiment shown comprise a central gas inlet<br>
nozzle 27 and a gas outlet nozzle 26 for a reaction gas 28. Moreover, they each comprise a<br>
decentrally located access nozzle 29 having the width of a manhole and designed to be opened<br>
and closed again.<br>
The embodiment shown is one of three prefabricated subassemblies 2, 3, 4 adapted to be built<br>
together at the construction site, i.e. at the final place of erection of tube bundle reactor 5 and thus<br>
be the finished tube bundle reactor 5 ready for operation.<br>
It is essential that it is assured when deciding on the division into subassemblies, that the reactor<br>
tubes 7 with the tube sheets 9, 11 fastened to them and perhaps further elements likewise secured<br>
to them, such as baffle plates, always will constitute subassemblies which are separate from the<br>
reactor shell 15 and the reactor heads 24, 25.<br>
Among the subassemblies there is a shell/head subassembly 2. It includes the reactor shell 15 and<br>
the lower reactor head 25 fastened to the shell. Gas distribution means of a kind known in the art<br>
are received in the lower reactor head 25. The lower reactor head 25 also comes with the gas inlet<br>
nozzle 27 and the access nozzle 29 already fastened to it. Moreover, supporting means 30 are<br>
secured to the outside of the reactor head 25. They may become connected to a base structure for<br>
support of the entire tube bundle reactor 5.<br>
The reactor shell 15 is provided with the inlet and outlet nozzles 21, 22 for the heat carrier 23.<br>
Furthermore, a continuous bearing ring 19a on which the lower tube sheet 11 may be placed is<br>
fixed to the inside wall 20 of the reactor shell 15 near the lower reactor head 25, and sealing<br>
means 31 secured to the bearing ring 19a may become pressure tightly connected to the lower<br>
tube sheet 11. These sealing means 31 embodied by a lip 32 which is flexible in radial direction<br>
will be described in greater detail below with reference to fig. 3c.<br><br>
The set of subassemblies further includes a tube bundle subassembly 3. It contains the tube<br>
bundle 6 with the two tube sheets 9, 11 secured to the bundle. At its lateral peripheral edge 18,<br>
the lower tube sheet 11 is formed with a shoulder 33 by which it may be placed on the bearing<br>
ring 19a of the shell/head subassembly 2. Arc-shaped sheets 34 are fastened pressure tightly to<br>
the upper side 12, remote from the tube bundle 6, of the upper tube sheet 9. By means of these<br>
sheets 34, the upper tube sheet 9 may be connected tightly to the inside wall 20 of the reactor<br>
shell 15.<br>
The sealing means 31 are elastically deformable in radial direction so as to follow different radial<br>
thermal expansions of the tube sheets 9, 11 and the reactor shell 15.<br>
The third subassembly of the set of subassemblies illustrated is a head subassembly 4 which<br>
includes the upper reactor head 24. The gas outlet nozzle 26 and also an access nozzle 29 already<br>
are attached to the lower reactor head 24.<br>
The description below will deal with assembling the three subassemblies 2, 3, 4 to form a<br>
complete tube bundle reactor 5.<br>
To begin with, the shell/head subassembly 2 is erected vertically, the lower reactor head 25<br>
becoming the bottom end. Thereupon, the tube bundle subassembly 3 is introduced into the open<br>
upper end of the reactor shell 15, the lower tube sheet 11 leading as the lower end of the tube<br>
bundle subassembly 3. This manner of inserting the tube bundle subassembly 3 into the<br>
shell/head subassembly 2 is continued until the shoulder 33 of the lower tube sheet 11 abuts<br>
against the bearing ring 19a in the shell/head subassembly. Thereupon, assembly welding seams<br>
35 are applied to pressure tightly weld the lower sealing means 32 to the bottom side 13 remote<br>
from the tube bundle 6 of the lower tube sheet 11. Also, assembly welding seams 36 are applied<br>
to pressure tightly weld the sealing means 34 which are fastened to the upper sheet 9 to the inside<br>
wall 20 of the reactor shell 15. Finally, the head subassembly 4 is placed on the upper edge 37 of<br>
the reactor shell 15 and connected to the same by an assembly welding seam 38 as well.<br>
The bearing ring 19a accommodates the full vertical load exclusively via contact between the<br>
lower tube sheet 11 and the bearing ring 19a. No further fastening means or measures are needed<br><br>
to carry off load, in particular no welding throughout the full thickness of the tube sheet which<br>
would make it necessary to subject the same to heat treatment following the welding. As the<br>
assembly welding seams 35, 36 described above are nothing but sealing seams to create a<br>
pressure vessel 17 between the tube sheets 9, 11 and the reactor shell 15, they can be made<br>
relatively thin and consequently need not be subjected to subsequent heat treatment in accordance<br>
with the relevant regulations. The assembly welding seam 38 between the head subassembly 4<br>
and the shell/head subassembly 2 readily may be heat treated, if need be, because there is no<br>
direct contact between the upper tube sheet 9 and this assembly welding seam 38.<br>
Figs. 2a to 2d illustrate further embodiments of supporting means 19 for vertical support of the<br>
tube bundle subassembly 3 by the shell/head subassembly 2, i.e. along the peripheral edge 18 of<br>
the lower tube sheet 11 or the upper tube sheet 9. All the associated pressure tight connections<br>
between the respective tube sheets 9, 11 and the reactor shell 15 shown in figs. 2a to 2d are<br>
produced exclusively by welding seams and are, therefore, not elastic.<br>
Fig. 2a shows an assembly welding seam 39 which transmits vertical forces between the lower<br>
tube sheet 11 and the reactor shell 15. To achieve that, a radially extending flange 40 is formed at<br>
the peripheral edge 18 of the tube sheet 11 and its thickness is reduced to such an extent, as<br>
compared to the thickness of the tube sheet 11, that heat treatment of the tube sheet 11 after<br>
welding is not required under the relevant regulations, e.g. AD specifications. At the inside wall<br>
20 of the reactor shell 15, opposite the tube bottom flange 40, another flange 41 is formed which<br>
has a thickness corresponding to that of the tube bottom flange 40. The opposed edges of the<br>
flanges 40, 41 define a downwardly open joint so that a V-shaped assembly welding seam 39 can<br>
be produced from the bottom. This force transmitting welding seam 39, at the same time,<br>
establishes the tight connection 31 between the tube sheet 11 and the reactor shell 15. The flanges<br>
40, 41 may be made flush with the bottom side 13 of the tube sheet 11, or they may be formed at<br>
the upper side 42 of the tube sheet 11 facing the tube bundle 6. The upper tube sheet 9 likewise<br>
may be connected to the reactor shell 15 by welding, making use of such flanges 40, 41. Also,<br>
both tube sheets 9, 11 of a tube bundle may be welded to the reactor shell 15.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in fig. 2b, a bearing ring 19b formed with a downwardly inclined<br>
lower side 43 serves to receive a lower tube sheet 11. The pressure tight connection 31 between<br><br>
the tube sheet 11 and the reactor shell 15 and the bearing ring 19a, respectively, is established by<br>
an assembly sealing weld seam 44 at the bottom side 13 of the tube sheet 11.<br>
Fig. 2c illustrates an embodiment with which the bearing ring 19a and the peripheral edge 18 of<br>
the lower tube sheet 11 are mutually engaged in the manner of claws and hooks, respectively,<br>
whereby they provide a connection in form lock not only in vertical direction but also radially.<br>
The pressure tight connection 31, 44 is obtained in the same way as in the case of fig. 2b.<br>
In respect of vertical support, the embodiment according to fig. 2d corresponds essentially to the<br>
embodiment explained with reference to fig. la, but the spacing between the bottom side 13 of<br>
the lower tube sheet 11 and the bottom side 45 of the bearing ring 19a is smaller. An additional<br>
bar 46 is provided here to accommodate upwardly directed forces. It abuts against the bottom<br>
side 45 of the bearing ring 19a as well as the bottom side 13 of the lower tube sheet 11, and a<br>
screw 47 is passed through and threaded into the bottom side 13 of the tube sheet 11 to tighten<br>
the bar 46 against both the bearing ring 19a and the tube sheet 11.<br>
Figs. 3a to 3d illustrate further embodiments of sealing means which are deformable elastically in<br>
radial direction between the tube sheet and the reactor shell and reactor head, respectively.<br>
Fig. 3a is an enlarged view of the sealing means 34 shown in figs, 1a and 1b between the upper<br>
tube sheet 9 and the reactor shell 15, designated detail IIIa in fig. 1b. The sealing means 34 is<br>
embodied by an arc-shaped sheet welded at the works to to the upper side 12 of the tube sheet 9.<br>
At the construction site, upon assembly of subassemblies 2, 3, 4, it is connected to the reactor<br>
shell 15 by the assembly welding seam 36.<br>
Fig. 3b shows sealing means 48 having an annular cross section and being connected by a<br>
fastening flange 49 each to the peripheral edge 50 of the upper tube sheet 9 and to the reactor<br>
shell 15. Both welding seams 51 in this embodiment may be made as assembly welding seams.<br>
Fig. 3c shows the detail designated IIIc in fig. lb, on an enlarged scale. The supporting means 19<br>
is embodied by a bearing ring 19a having an inclined lower side 43 (similar to fig. 2b). By a<br>
shoulder 33 formed at its peripheral edge 18, the lower tube sheet 11 rests on this bearing ring<br><br>
19a. In the embodiment according to fig. 3c, a vertical lip 32 is formed radially inwardly of the<br>
bearing ring 19a, a flexurally stiff connection existing between the lower end 52 of this lip 32 and<br>
the bearing ring 19a. The lip 32 has a given length and is disposed at a predetermined radial<br>
spacing 53 from the bearing ring 19a. In the assembled state of the tube bundle subassembly 3<br>
and the shell/head subassembly 2, the lip 32 may be connected at its upper end 54 by an assembly<br>
welding seam 35 to the bottom side 13 of the lower tube sheet 11. The lip 32 is bendable in radial<br>
direction by virtue of its free length.<br>
The embodiment shown in fig. 3d of a sealing means 31 substantially corresponds to the<br>
embodiment according to fig. 3a. Here, however, the upper tube sheet 9 rests on the bearing ring<br>
19a by a shoulder 55 formed at its peripheral edge 50, and the sealing means 31 is embodied by<br>
an L-shaped sheet. The long leg 56a is welded to the upper side 12 of the tube sheet 9 at the<br>
works and extends in vertical direction. The connection between the short leg 56b and the reactor<br>
shell 15 is produced by an assembly welding seam 57 after the subassemblies 2, 3, and 4 have<br>
been joined.<br>
The embodiments of sealing means 31 as shown in figs. 3a, 3b, and 3d may be used also with<br>
lower tube sheets 11, in mirror-inverted orientation about a horizontal axis.<br>
Instead of the three subassemblies 2, 3, 4 discussed above, a subassembly set 1 according to the<br>
invention also may comprise a greater number of subassemblies. For instance, instead of just one<br>
subassembly, several subassemblies each may be made comprising a reactor shell 15 and a<br>
reactor head 24, 25, or a tube bundle 6 with the tube sheets 9, 11 attached to them, or the second<br>
reactor head 25, 24.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates a tube bundle subassembly 100 which results from dividing a tube bundle 6 with<br>
associated tube sheets 9, 11 into a plurality of subassemblies. The tube bundle 6 is divided along<br>
planes of divison 101 which extend parallel to the reactor tubes 7. In the embodiment shown, the<br>
planes of division 101 extend in radial direction and they each contain the central axis 16 of the<br>
tube bundle 6. This results in tube bundle subassemblies 100 having the shape of sectors.<br><br>
The radially extending edges 102 of the tube sheets 9, 11 define the edges of division of the tube<br>
bundle subassembly and the tube bundle sector 100, respectively. In the embodiment<br>
shown, they include an angle of 45° so that a tube bundle 6 may be composed of eight such tube<br>
bundle sectors 100.<br>
The reactor tubes 7 of such tube bundle subassemblies 100 located at the outside in<br>
circumferential direction are positioned at a predetermined distance in circumferential direction<br>
from adjacent edges of division 102 of the tube sheet sectors 103, 104. In this manner<br>
passageways 105 free of tubes are formed along the edges of division 102 of the tube sheet<br>
sectors 103, 104 when the tube bundle sectors 100 are assembled, whereby free space is offered<br>
for pressure tightly connecting the tube bundle sectors 100 to each other.<br>
In the embodiment shown, four baffle plates 106 likewise sector-shaped, extend transversely of<br>
the reactor tubes 7 in each tube bundle sector 100 between the tube sheet portions and the tube<br>
sheet sectors 103, 104, respectively. The reactor tubes 7 extend through and are connected to the<br>
baffle plates 106. The baffle plates 106 prevent buckling of the reactor tubes 7.<br>
In the interest of clarity, fig. 4 represents only one reactor tube 7; openings for passage of the heat<br>
carrier 23 are not shown in the baffle plates 106.<br>
In each tube bundle sector 100 adjacent baffle plates 106 are connected to each other as well as<br>
the tube sheets 103, 104 and the respective adjacent baffle plates 106 are connected to each other<br>
by vertical sheets 107 offering a connection which is shear resistant and flexurally stiff<br>
particularly in the plane of the sheets. The sheets 107 between the tube sheets 103, 104 and the<br>
respective adjacent baffle plates 106 are perforated to permit the heat carrier to pass. The vertical<br>
sheets 107, in the embodiment shown, are positioned between the outer reactor tubes 7 in<br>
circumferential direction and the radial edges 102 of the tube sheet sectors and baffle plate<br>
sectors 103, 104, 106, respectively. These sheets 107 also are designed to prevent loss of<br>
stability, such as by buckling or warping, and they assure that the position of the baffle plates 106<br>
is maintained so that, in turn, they can prevent bending or buckling of the reactor tubes 7 due to<br>
their being connected to them.<br><br>
The sector-shaped tube sheets 103, 104 and the baffle plates 106 have a concave edge 108 of<br>
circular arc shape radially inwardly. This circular arc-shaped inner edge 108 of the tube sheet<br>
sectors 103, 104 is intended to abut against and be fixed to a central support or a central nozzle.<br>
Fig. 4 does not show by what means the tube sheet sectors 103, 104 might rest on supporting<br>
means (e.g. a shoulder at the peripheral edge, as in the case of the tube bundle subassembly<br>
according to fig. 1a), nor are any sealing means indicated. Fig. 4 simply is intended to present a<br>
diagrammatic embodiment of a tube bundle subassembly 100 having sector shape.<br>
Figs. 5a and 5b show an embodiment of a supporting means 109 of rib shape. As may be seen,<br>
ribs are arranged in the shape of a rectangular cross on which four tube bundle subassemblies 100<br>
of sector shape are supported by their lower sector-shaped tube sheets and tube sheet portions<br>
104, respectively. The sector angle in this case is 90°. The cross-section of the ribs 109 is that of<br>
an inverted T, the free edge 110 of the web 111 presenting the bearing surface for the lower tube<br>
sheets 104 of the tube bundle subassembly 100. The rib cross is welded to the inside wall 20 of<br>
the reactor shell 15.<br>
Furthermore, a continuous bearing ring 112 is formed at the inside wall 20 of the reactor shell 15<br>
to help carry the lower tube sheets 104 which are formed with shoulders 113, 33 along their<br>
edges of division 102 and peripheral edges 18. By these shoulders they rest on the ribs 109 and<br>
the bearing ring 112. At their bottom sides 114, the lower tube sheets 104 are welded to the<br>
bearing ring 112 and the ribs 109 by means of assembly sealing weld seams 115, 116. In the<br>
present case, the latter establish the pressure tight connections amongst the tube bundle<br>
subassemblies 100 as well as with the reactor shell 15.<br>
The tube bundle subassemblies 100 include no other parts which might pierce the planes of<br>
division 101, i.e. protrude into the building space of an adjacent tube bundle subassembly 100.<br>
Thus the individual tube bundle subassemblies 100 and sectors, respectively, may be introduced<br>
one after the other from above and positioned on the cross of ribs 109 inside the reactor shell 15<br>
which has been mounted before.<br><br>
In Fig. 5a tubeless passageways 105 also can be seen which are arranged to extend like a cross in<br>
correspondence with the cross of ribs 109. The spacing of the outer reactor tubes 7 in<br>
circumferential direction from the edge of division 102 of the tube sheet sectors 104 has been<br>
selected so that the reactor tubes 7 will pass by the webs 111 when the tube bundle subassemblies<br>
100 rest on the cross of ribs 109.<br>
Fig. 5b shows the cross-like configuration of the webs 111 and flanges 117 of the cross of ribs<br>
109.<br>
Figs. 6a to 6d illustrate some embodiments of connections between tube bundle subassemblies<br>
100 amongst each other and/or with a supporting means 109 consisting of ribs.<br>
In fig. 6a, lower tube sheet sectors 104 are placed on the upper flange 118 of a T-shaped bearing<br>
rib 119. The edge of division 102 of the tube sheet sectors 104 is formed with a shoulder 113 to<br>
rest on the upper side 120 of the flange 118. Each shoulder 113 is attached to the flange 118 by a<br>
screw 121 which passes through the flange 118 from the bottom to the top, being screwed into a<br>
blind bore 122 in the shoulder 113 of the tube sheet sector 104. Moreover, the bottom side 114 of<br>
the tube bundle sector 104 is welded to the side edge 123 of the flange 118 by an assembly<br>
welding seam 124.<br>
Fig. 6b shows a similar supporting means for use with the upper tube sheet sectors 103. The tube<br>
sheet sectors 103 rest with their shoulders 125 on the upper side 126 of an enlarged head 127 of a<br>
rib 128. A screw bolt 129 passing through the shoulder 125 from the top to be threaded into a<br>
blind bore 130 formed in the head 127 of the rib is welded tightly to the upper side 131 of the<br>
tube bundle sector 103 by means of an assembly welding seam 132. The edges of division 102 of<br>
the tube sheet sectors 103 are pressure tightly welded together by an assembly welding seam 133.<br>
Also with the embodiment shown in fig. 6c the upper tube sheets 103 of the tube bundle<br>
subassemblies 100 rest by a shoulder 125 on a rib 134 and are pressure tightly connected to each<br>
other by a U-shaped structural element 135 which bridges the joint between the tube sheet sectors<br>
103 and is pressure tightly connected to the upper side 131 thereof by an assembly welding seam<br>
136.<br><br>
The embodiment shown in fig. 6d has a connection between the lower tube sheet sectors 104 and<br>
a supporting rib 137, similar to that shown in fig. 2a between the peripheral edge 18 of the lower<br>
tube sheet 11 and the inside wall 20 of the reactor shell 15. The edges of division 102 of the tube<br>
sheet sectors 104 include a flange 138 the thickness of which is less than the thickness of the tube<br>
sheet. The rib 137 is formed with flanges 139 having the same thickness as the tube sheet flanges<br>
138 opposite to which they come to lie in the combined state of the subassemblies so that they<br>
may be connected to them by assembly welding seams 140. The assembly welding seams 140 in<br>
this structure provide both vertical support and a pressure tight connection. The thickness of the<br>
flanges 138, 139 and of the assembly welding seams 140, respectively, is chosen such that the<br>
structural members, when welded together, need not undergo heat treatment according to the<br>
relevant regulations.<br>
The embodiment illustrated here shows the weld connection between lower tube sheet sectors<br>
104 and a rib 137 as having flanges 138, 139 flush with the bottom side 114 of the tube sheet<br>
sectors 104. Yet the flanges 138, 139 also could be flush with the upper side 141 of the lower<br>
tube sheet sectors 104 and, moreover, they could also lie somewhere between these two limit<br>
positions. In all these cases the welding seams will be produced from below.<br>
A similar weld connection is conceivable also for the force transmitting pressure tight connection<br>
between upper tube sheet sectors 103 and a rib. Again the flanges would be flush with the bottom<br>
or upper sides of the tube sheet sectors 103, or they would be positioned anywhere in between.<br>
The weld joints are open upwardly so that the assembly welding seams will be produced from the<br>
top.<br>
Fig. 7 shows an embodiment of a connection without ribs between tube sheet sectors 104. Here,<br>
the edges of division 102 have connecting flanges 142 adapted to be screwed 143 together upon<br>
assembly of the subassemblies 100 so as to offer a rigid connection providing stiffness against<br>
forces and moments. The engagement between the connecting flanges 142 may cover the full<br>
surface area or only part thereof. In the example according to fig. 7, the lower tube sheet sectors<br>
104 are thus interconnected. The connecting flanges 142 are prepared at their ends remote from<br><br>
the reactor tubes 7 for welding seams so that, once combined, they may be connected pressure<br>
tightly to each other by an assembly welding seam.<br>
At their peripheral edges 18, the tube sheet sectors 104 have shoulders 33 resting on a bearing<br>
ring 112 to which they are connected by an assembly welding seam 115, in a manner similar to<br>
the embodiment shown in fig. 5a.<br>
Fig. 8 is an illustration of a tube bundle reactor 5 for carrying out gas and/or liquid phase<br>
reactions. The aim of this design is to reduce the horizontal dimensions of the reactor, i.e. the<br>
dimensions perpendicular to the reactor axis 16. To that end, the feed pipe 201 for liquid heat<br>
carrier 23 extends through a tube sheet, in this case the lower tube sheet 11. The discharge pipe<br>
202 for the heat carrier 23 which may be a liquid-steam mixture as it leaves the reactor also<br>
extends through a tube sheet, in this case the upper tube sheet 9.<br>
Like the reactor shown in fig. 1b, this tube bundle reactor 5 comprises a bundle 6 of vertical<br>
reactor tubes 7 filled with catalyst material and having their ends 8, 10 fixed pressure tigthly in<br>
the upper and lower tube sheets 9, 11. The tube bundle 6 is enclosed by a reactor shell 15 which<br>
is connected pressure tightly to the tube sheets 9, 11 so that a pressure vessel 17 is formed by the<br>
tube sheets 9, 11 together with the reactor shell 15 The connections, moreover, provide stiffness<br>
against forces and moments. The liquid heat carrier 23 supplied through the feed pipe 201<br>
circulates under presure around the reactor tubes 7 while, at the same time, it may also evaporate<br>
at least in part. A resulting liquid-steam mixture is passed out through the discharge pipe 202 into<br>
a steam drum (see fig. 11). The tube sheets 9, 11 each are spanned by a reactor head 24, 25<br>
connected to the reactor shell 15 and in fluid communication with the upper ends 8, 10 of the<br>
reactor tubes 7.<br>
The tube bundle 6 has a central area 203 which is free of tubes and into which the feed pipe 201<br>
and the discharge pipe 202 open. Tubeless passageways also extend in star-like fashion from the<br>
feed pipe 201 and discharge pipe 202 in order to distribute heat carrier 23 uniformly throughout<br>
the tube bundle 6.<br><br>
The feed pipe 201 extends through an inlet nozzle 204 in the lower reactor head 25 and the<br>
discharge pipe 202 through an outlet nozzle 205 in the upper reactor head 24. Outside of the<br>
reactor 5, the nozzles 204, 205 each are connected via compensating means 206 to the pipes<br>
201, 202. Varying thermal expansions of the pipes 201, 202 and heads 25, 24 thus can be<br>
compensated.<br>
The upper reactor head 24, moreover, comprises a gas inlet nozzle 27, while the upper reactor<br>
head 25 comprises a gas outlet nozzle 26. Known gas distribution means are provided in the<br>
upper reactor head 24.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a modification of the embodiment according to fig. 8. The reactor 5 illustrated in<br>
fig. 9 is composed of a set of subassemblies 1 according to the invention.<br>
Other than with fig. 8, the upper tube sheet 9, 103 in the reactor 5 according to fig. 9 is not<br>
connected rigidly to the reactor shell 15 but instead supported so as to be axially movable on the<br>
upper ends 8 of the reactor tubes 7. This means that the upper tube sheet 9, 103 is movable with<br>
respect to the reactor shell 15 and, therefore, able to follow thermal expansions of the reactor<br>
tubes 7.<br>
The heat carrier feed pipe 201 extends centrally and vertically through the lower reactor head 25<br>
to which it has been welded at the works. Outside of the reactor head 25, the feed pipe 201<br>
extends horizontally, being bent at a right angle.<br>
The heat carrier discharge pipe 202, too, extends centrally and vertically but through the upper<br>
reactor head 24 to which it has been welded at the works. This pipe is provided with<br>
compensation means 207 inside the upper reactor head 24 so as to equalize variations in length<br>
caused by thermal loading.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the tube bundle reactor 5 is composed of subassemblies as follows:<br>
A first subassembly 2 comprises the lower reactor head 25, including the heat carrier feed pipe<br>
201 connected to the same and two nozzles fastened to the reactor head 25 - a gas outlet nozzle<br><br>
26 and an access nozzle 29 - as well as a supporting means 30 secured to the reactor head 25 for<br>
support of the fully assembled tube bundle reactor 5.<br>
The first subassembly 2 further comprises the complete reactor shell 15 welded to the lower<br>
reactor head 25. A continuous bearing ring 19a is formed at the inside wall 20 of the reactor shell<br>
15 near the lower reactor head 25. The bearing ring 19a is designed to receive a shoulder 33<br>
formed at the outer edge 18 of lower tube sheet sectors and tube sheet portions 104, respectively.<br>
The bearing ring 19a is formed with a vertical lip 32, such as illustrated in figs, 1a, 1b, or 3c.<br>
Below the bearing ring 19a, in this first subassembly 2, a cross of ribs 208 is fixed to the inside<br>
wall 20 and its center is welded to the outside of the feed pipe 201. Its upper edge 209 presents a<br>
bearing surface for lower tube sheet sectors 104 of tube bundle subassemblies. The configuration<br>
of the ribs 208 is that of an inverted T (in correspondence with fig. 5a).<br>
In addition, the feed pipe 201 is provided at its end opening into the tube bundle 6 with a central<br>
bearing ring 210 having a radially outwardly protruding step 211 on which to place the shoulders<br>
213 defined at inner edges 212 of tube sheet sectors 104. The interior cross section of the central<br>
bearing ring 210 corresponds to that of the feed pipe 201.<br>
The first subassembly 2 also includes that part of the upper reactor head 24 that has a cylindrical<br>
wall in axial continuation of the reactor shell 15.<br>
The second to fifth subassemblies 100, 3a - 3d each comprise a 90° sector of the tube bundle 6,<br>
including the respective upper and lower tube sheet sectors 103, 104 fastened to the same.<br>
The lower tube sheet sectors 104 are provided at their outer peripheral edges 18 with the<br>
shoulders 33 mentioned above to be placed on the bearing ring 19a which is mounted on the<br>
reactor shell 15. Radially inwardly, the tube sheet sectors 104 have concave inner edges 212 of<br>
circular arc shape formed with the shoulder 213 already mentioned to be supported by the central<br>
bearing ring 210.<br>
With the embodiment of fig. 9, therefore, the feed pipe 201 forms part of the supporting means<br>
19 for the lower tube sheet 104.<br><br>
At the works, an elastic sealing means 34, such as shown in fig. 3a, is welded to the upper side 12<br>
of the upper tube sheet sectors 103 near the outer peripheral edges 18 there of. When the<br>
tube bundle subassemblies 100 and 3a-3d, respectively, have been inserted, the sealing means 34<br>
may be connected tightly to the reactor shell 15 by an assembly welding seam 36.<br>
The upper tube sheet portions and sectors 103, respectively, are formed at their radially inner<br>
edges 215 with a flange 216 configured similar to the one illustrated in fig. 6d but being flush<br>
with the upper side 12 of the tube sheet sectors 103. The thickness of the flange 216 is reduced as<br>
compared to that of the tube sheet sectors 103 so that the structural members, having been<br>
connected by welding, need not undergo heat treatment subsequent to the welding step in<br>
accordance with the relevant regulations. When the tube bundle subassemblies 3a - 3d have been<br>
put together the inner edges 215 of the upper tube sheet sectors 103 may be moved into abutment<br>
against the discharge pipe 202 and connected to the outside thereof by an assembly welding seam<br>
217.<br>
A sixth subassembly 4 which corresponds to the third subassembly shown in fig. 1a includes the<br>
vaulted upper part of the upper reactor head 24 with the heat carrier discharge pipe 202 fastened<br>
to it and two nozzles likewise fastened to it, namely a gas inlet nozzle 27 and an access nozzle 29.<br>
The subassemblies 2, 3a - 3d, 4 are assembled as follows:<br>
To begin with, the first subassembly 2 is erected vertically so that the lower reactor head 25 will<br>
be at the lower end and the first subassembly 2 positioned on the supporting means 30.<br>
Thereupon, the four tube bundle subassemblies and sectors 3a - 3d, respectively, are inserted into<br>
the first subassembly 2 one after the other such that the lower tube sheet sectors 104 come to lie<br>
not only on the outer bearing ring 19a but also on the central bearing ring 210 along their<br>
shoulders 213, and on the ribs 208 as well. The vertical lips 32 formed at the outer bearing ring<br>
19a are connected pressure tightly to the bottom side of the tube sheet sectors 104 by means of an<br>
assembly welding seam 35. Furthermore, the lower tube sheet segments 104 are connected<br>
pressure tightly to the central bearing ring 210 and the ribs 208 at their bottom sides 13 by means<br><br>
of an assembly welding seam 218. The sealing means 34 which are provided on the upper side 12<br>
of the upper tube sheet segments 103 are connected pressure tightly to the inside<br>
wall 20 of the reactor shell 15 and the upper reactor head 24, respectively, by means of an<br>
assembly welding seam 36.<br>
Next, the sixth subassembly 4 is positioned on the upper edge 37 of the first subassembly 2 and<br>
connected to the same by assembly welding seam 38. If necessary, this assembly welding seam<br>
38 is heat treated. Once the sixth subassembly 4 has been positioned on the first subassembly 2,<br>
the radially inwardly located flanges 216 of the upper tube sheet portions 103 are connected<br>
pressure tightly by means of an assembly welding seam 217 to the outside wall of the discharge<br>
pipe 202 at the end opening into the tube bundle 6.<br>
If desired or necessary, the heat carrier discharge pipe 202 may have been divided, at the works,<br>
in horizontal direction within the upper reactor head 24 and then will be welded together at the<br>
construction site by an assembly welding seam 219.<br>
All the assembly welding seams, perhaps with the exception of the assembly welding seam 38<br>
between the first and sixth subassemblies 2 and 4 if necessary, are designed as welding seams<br>
without need for heat treatment.<br>
Figs. 10a and 10b show a tube bundle reactor 5 similar to the one of fig. 9, but comprising four<br>
feed pipes 201 and four discharge pipes 202 each for the heat carrier 23 extending through the<br>
lower and upper tube sheets 104, 103 as well as the lower and upper reactor heads 25, 24. This<br>
embodiment likewise comprises four sector-like tube bundle subassemblies 100 and 3a - 3d, the<br>
sector angle being 90°. In each of the tube bundle sectors 3a - 3d, one feed pipe 201 each opens<br>
into the lower tube sheet sector 104 and one discharge pipe 202 each into the upper tube sheet<br>
sector 103. Each feed pipe 201 presents vertical support for the associated tube bundle sector 3a -<br>
3d.<br>
For configuring the subassemblies 3a - 3d, each feed pipe 201 and each discharge pipe 202 is<br>
horizontally split in the respective reactor head 25, 24.<br><br>
At the works, the end piece 220 of the feed pipe 201 opening into the tube bundle 6 is welded to<br>
the respective lower tube sheet sector 104. The next piece 221 of pipe length passes through the<br>
lower reactor head 25 to which it is welded at the works. After introduction of the tube bundle<br>
subassemblies 3a - 3d into the shell/head subassembly 2, the end pieces 220 are connected to the<br>
respective next pipe pieces 221 by an assembly welding seam 222.<br>
Reinforcing ribs 223 extending between the outer sides of the end pieces 220 and the bottom<br>
sides 13 of the tube sheet sectors 104 have been welded to them at the works.<br>
Also the end pieces 224 of the discharge pipes 202 opening into the tube bundle 6 are welded to<br>
the respective upper tube sheet sector 103 at the works. The next pieces 225 of pipe length pass<br>
through the upper reactor head 24 to which they are welded at the works. The end pieces 224<br>
already include the compensation means 226. When the head subassembly 4 has been positioned<br>
on the shell/head subassembly 2, the end pieces 224 are connected to the respective next pipe<br>
pieces 225 by an assembly welding seam 227.<br>
The sealing means 228 between the reactor shell 15 and the lower and upper tube sheets 104, 103<br>
correspond to the embodiment shown in fig. 3a in rectangular configuration. They are welded at<br>
the works to the bottom side 13 of the lower tube sheet 104 and to the upper side 12 of the upper<br>
tube sheet 103, respectively, and will be connected pressure tightly to the reactor shell 15 at the<br>
construction site by an assembly welding seam 229.<br>
Both the lower and upper tube sheet sectors 104, 103 are formed at their radially inner edges 330<br>
with flanges 231 having a thickness which is smaller than that of the tube sheets 104, 103. They<br>
are connected to the tube sheet sectors 104, 103 by an assembly welding seam 232. In the case of<br>
the lower tube sheet sectors 104, the flanges 231 are flush with the bottom side 13, while they are<br>
flush with the upper side 12 in the case of the upper tube sheet sectors 103.<br>
Supply and discharge of the reaction gas 28 is accomplished by a central gas inlet nozzle 27 into<br>
the lower reactor head 25 and by a central gas outlet nozzle 26 from the upper reactor head 24,<br>
respectively. The upper reactor head 24 comprises an access nozzle 29, just like the lower reactor<br>
head 25.<br><br>
As may be gathered from fig. 10b, passageways 105 free of tubes extend along the edges of<br>
division 102 of the tube bundle sectors 100 and 3a - 3d, respectively. Each tube bundle sector<br>
as may be gathered from fig. 10b, passageways 105 free of tubes extend along the edges of<br>
division 102 of the tube bundle sectors 100 and 3a - 3d, respectively. Each tube bundle sector 3a -<br>
3d, in addition, is designed to have four more tube-free passageways 233 extending in star-like<br>
fashion from the respective feed and discharge pipes 201, 202 of the tube bundle sector 3a - 3d.<br>
Just like the tube bundle reactor according to fig. 10a, also the tube bundle reactor 5 illustrated in<br>
fig. 11 comprises four discharge pipes 202 opening into the upper tube sheet 9 and exiting from<br>
the upper reactor head 24. The heat carrier 23 flows around the reactor tubes 7 and evaporates at<br>
least partly. The resulting liquid-steam mixture rises through the discharge pipes 202.<br>
The discharge pipes 202 not only open into a steam drum 234 disposed above the reactor head 24<br>
they also provide means of support for the same. A downcomer 235 extends from the steam drum<br>
234 centrally and vertically through the upper reactor head 24 and through the upper tube sheet 9<br>
down to just above the lower tube sheet 11. Liquid heat carrier 23 flows from the steam drum 234<br>
through this downcomer 235 back into the pressure vessel and heat carrier space 17, respectively,<br>
between the tube sheets 9, 11.<br>
The tube sheets 9, 11 of the embodiment shown are fastened to the reactor shell 15 throughout<br>
their thickness. This means that the tube bundle reactor 5 is not assembled of subassemblies<br>
according to the invention but instead fabricated entirely at the works. Nevertheless it is readily<br>
possible to produce such tube bundle reactors 5 as subassembly according to the invention,<br>
similar to what is shown in fig. 9. With the embodiment according to fig. 11, the feed pipe that<br>
passes through the lower reactor head is dispensed with and replaced instead by the downcomer<br>
235.<br>
Here, too, the lower and upper reactor heads 25, 24 are provided each with gas inlet and gas<br>
outlet nozzles 27, 26, respectively, and with an access nozzle 29.<br><br>
Figs. 12a and 12b as well as 13a and 13b each show arrangements 300 of pluralities of tube<br>
bundle reactors 5. Each one of these tube bundle reactors 5 is completed in itself and operable<br>
as such, including a bundle of vertical, catalyst-filled reactor tubes. The ends of the reactor tubes<br>
are fastened pressure tightly in upper and lower tube sheets 9, 11. A reactor shell 15 encloses the<br>
tube bundle and is connected pressure tightly to the tube sheets 9,11, whereby the reactor shell<br>
15 together with the tube sheets 9, 11 forms a pressure vessel. Liquid heat carrier 23 circulates<br>
under pressure around the reactor tubes, while evaporating in part. The tube sheets 9, 11 each are<br>
spanned by a reactor head 24, 25 connected to the reactor shell 15 and in fluid communication<br>
with the reactor tubes. One of the reactor heads, the upper reactor head 24 in the embodiment<br>
shown, constitutes a gas inlet head and the other one, here the upper reactor head 25, constitutes a<br>
gas outlet head.<br>
As regards dimensions and weight, each tube bundle reactor 5 presents an individual<br>
transportable unit and subassembly, respectively, of the arrangement 300.<br>
Once assembled to form an arrangement 300 according to the invention, the respective gas inlet<br>
and gas outlet heads 24, 25 of adjacent tube bundle reactors 5 are interconnected by short pipes<br>
301. One or more of the gas inlet and gas outlet heads 24, 25 is/are connected to gas supply and<br>
gas discharge lines, respectively, (not shown) which lead into and out of the arrangement 300,<br>
respectively.<br>
Above the arrangement 300, there is disposed a steam drum 302 in fluid communication not only<br>
with each discharge pipe 303, 305 for liquid-steam mixtures 23 coming from each of the tube<br>
bundle reactors 5 but also with each feed pipe 304, 312 for liquid heat carrier 23 leading to the<br>
tube bundle reactors.<br>
In figs. 12a and 12b an arrangement 300 is shown which comprises six tube bundle reactors 5<br>
disposed in two parallel rows of three each. The gas inlet and gas outlet heads 24, 25 of the two<br>
tube bundle reactors 5a in the middle of these two rows of three are provided, in their crown<br>
zones, with inlet and outlet nozzles 27, 26 suitable for connection to external gas inlet and gas<br>
outlet lines, i.e. lines which come from outside and lead to the outside, respectively. The gas inlet<br>
and gas outlet heads 24, 25 of the respective outer tube bundle reactors 5b of the rows of three are<br><br>
connected by short pipes 301 to the gas inlet and gas outlet heads 24, 25, respectively, of the tube<br>
bundle reactor 5a in the middle of their row of three. Thus the gas 28 supplied may<br>
flow from the middle gas inlet head 24 to the two outer gas inlet heads 24, and the reacted gas 28<br>
may flow back from the two outer gas outlet heads 25 to the gas outlet head 25 in the middle.<br>
The expression "short pipe" is used to express that this particular pipe 301 is a direct link between<br>
the reactor heads 24, 25 stretching with the shortest length and without any detours across the<br>
distance between them.<br>
In each row of three, i.e. each row of tube bundle reactors 5 whose reactor heads 24, 25 are<br>
interconnected by short pipes 301, one gas inlet head 24 and one gas outlet head 25 includes an<br>
access pipe end 29 each through which a person may enter the reactor head 24, 25.<br>
The cross sectional dimension of the short pipes 301 between the reactor heads 24, 25<br>
corresponds at least to that of a manhole. A person thus also may enter the other reactor heads 24,<br>
25 of the row by passing through these short pipes 301. That permits maintenance and/or repair<br>
work to be done in the tube bundle reactors 5 without having to remove the reactor heads 24, 25<br>
or having to equip each reactor head 24, 25 with its own access nozzle.<br>
The pressure vessels of the tube bundle reactors 5 filled with liquid, evaporating heat carrier 23<br>
likewise are connected to each other by piping 305, 312. Each tube bundle reactor 5 comprises an<br>
upper ring channel 307 for discharging the liquid-steam mixture and a lower ring channel 308 for<br>
supplying the liquid heat carrier 23. The ring channels 307, 308 are mounted at the outside of the<br>
reactor shell 15 and in fluid communication with the pressure vessels inside the reactor shell 15<br>
through openings uniformly distributed across the circumference.<br>
The respective opposite upper ring channels 307 of the two rows of three are in fluid<br>
communication with each other through heat carrier discharge pipes 305. A riser 303 each opens<br>
into the three heat carrier discharge pipes 305. The upper ends of these risers open into the steam<br>
drum 302, and the resulting liquid-steam mixture flows through them from the respective two<br>
connected tube bundle reactors 5 and into the steam drum 302.<br><br>
The risers 303, at the same time, constitute the vertical supports for the steam drum 302.<br>
The liquid is separated from the steam in the steam drum 302. At its upper surface, the steam<br>
drum 302 includes an outlet 309 for steam 310. An inlet 311 for liquid heat carrier 23 opens<br>
horizontally into the steam drum 302 and it may function, at the same time, as horizontal support<br>
for the steam drum 302.<br>
The lower ring channels 308 of the two outer tube bundle reactors 5b are in fluid communication,<br>
through heat carrier feed pipes 312, with the lower ring channel 308 of the middle tube bundle<br>
reactor 5a of the same row of three. A downcomer 304 each opens into each of these four heat<br>
carrier feed pipes. The upper ends of these downcomers 304 open into the steam drum 302, and<br>
liquid heat carrier 23 flows through them from the steam drum 302 and back into the tube bundle<br>
reactors 5.<br>
The tube bundle reactors 5 are mechanically connected by a fastening structure 313 so as to form<br>
one unit. Bearing brackets 314 mounted on the unit allow the unit to be supported by a support<br>
structure 315. In the instant case the bearing brackets 314 rest on horizontal beams 315.<br>
The embodiment of the arrangement 300 according to the invention presented in figs. 13a and<br>
13b comprises ten tube bundle reactors 5 arranged in a circle. The design of the tube bundle<br>
reactors 5 corresponds substantially to the embodiment shown in fig. 9. The tube bundle reactors<br>
5, however, have their dimensions and weight selected such that they are transportable and,<br>
therefore, fully mounted at the works.<br>
The gas inlet heads 24, i.e. the upper reactor heads of two diametrically opposed tube bundle<br>
reactors 5 each comprise a gas inlet nozzle 27 suitable for connection to an external gas supply<br>
line.<br>
Gas inlet heads 24 located next to one another are interconnected by short pipes 301. Some of the<br>
gas inlet heads 24 - four in the embodiment shown - comprise access nozzles 29 through which a<br>
person may enter the gas inlet head 24. Here, too, the cross section of the short pipes 301 is at<br><br>
least as great as that of a manhole so that a person may get through the short pipes 301 from one<br>
gas inlet head 24 to the next, as with the embodiment according to figs. 12a and 12b.<br>
A gas collecting vessel 316 is disposed centrally in the arrangement 300, at the level of or<br>
below the gas outlet heads 25, i.e. the lower reactor heads. Mutually adjacent gas outlet heads 25<br>
are interconnected by gas outlet lines 317, and a gas collecting line 318 each leads from each gas<br>
outlet line 317 to the gas collecting vessel 316.<br>
The gas collecting vessel 316 is designed like a separator, including a filter 320 in its interior<br>
above the openings 319 of the gas collecting lines 318. Liquid components 321 of the reacted gas<br>
322 are separated and collected in the lower part of the separator 316, the liquid 321 being<br>
withdrawn from that region through a liquid outlet line 323. The gaseous components 324 flow in<br>
upward direction through the filter 320 to be carried off by a gas outlet line 325.<br>
In view of the fact that the gas outlet heads 25 of the instant embodiment are not interconnected<br>
by piping of manhole diameter, each gas outlet head 25 is provided with an access nozzle 29 of<br>
its own, as shown, for example, in fig. 13a with the left tube bundle reactor 5<br>
A common steam drum 302 shaped like a ring is disposed above the tube bundle reactors 5 and<br>
connected to each tube bundle reactor 5 via a respective riser 303. The riser 303 extends through<br>
the upper tube sheet 9 into the gas inlet head 24 of the respective reactor 5. The liquid-steam<br>
mixture 23 rises from the tube bundle reactors 5 through the riser 303 into the steam drum 302.<br>
With this design, too, the risers 303 present the vertical support of the steam drum 302.<br>
Morever, a downcomer 304 leads from the steam drum 302 to two adjacent tube bundle reactors<br>
5 each in the interior of the circular arrangement 300. At the level of the gas outlet heads 25, the<br>
downcomer 304 branches into two heat carrier distributing lines 326. These two heat carrier<br>
distributing lines 326 lead to the respective adjacent tube bundle reactors 5, pass through the gas<br>
outlet head 25, and open into the lower tube sheet 11 of the respective tube bundle reactor 5.<br>
Liquid heat carrier 23 flows from the steam drum 302 back through these downcomers 304 and<br>
distributing lines 326 to return into the tube bundle reactors 5.<br><br>
At its upper surface, the steam drum 302 includes an outlet 309 for steam 310. Moreover, the<br>
steam drum 302 is supplied with liquid heat carrier 23 through a heat carrier feed pipe 311.<br>
All the tube bundle reactors 5 of this arrangement 300 likewise are fastened to each other to form<br>
a mechanical unit and they stand on a common support structure 315.<br><br>
