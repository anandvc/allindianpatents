				<td>LIGHT ILLUMINATION APPARATUS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a light illumination apparatus.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
A typical light illumination apparatus comprises an arrangement adapted for illuminating<br>
a light sensitive material. Such material may e.g. comprise printing plates, materials<br>
adapted for rapid prototyping, film, etc. The illuminating is performed for the purpose of<br>
obtaining certain changes of properties of the illuminated material. Such illumination may<br>
thus e.g. result in the establishment of an image on the illuminated material or a certain<br>
structure.<br>
In order to obtain the desired illumination, light must be modulated. One prior art method<br>
of modulating light transmitting to an illumination surface is to apply a single or multiple<br>
beam laser, which may be modulated when performing a scanning movement over the<br>
illumination surface.<br>
Another and more recent way of illuminating an illumination surface is to apply a so-<br>
called spatial light modulator. Examples of such modulators may be a DMD, an LCD,<br>
etc. The spatial light modulator is adapted for modulating an incoming light beam into a<br>
number of individually modulated light beams.<br>
A problem of the prior art is that the obtainable modulating speed is somewhat limited<br>
due to the nature of the applied light modulators combined with the required energy and<br>
illumination speed for some applications.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a light illumination apparatus comprising at least one exposure<br>
head and at least two light modulating arrangements,<br><br>
each of said two light modulating arrangements comprising a spatial light modulator<br>
and an associated light emitter arranged for illumination of an illumination surface<br>
via said spatial light modulator,<br>
each of said two light modulating arrangements being digitally controlled,<br>
said apparatus comprising means for performing a relative movement between said at<br>
least one exposure head and said illumination surface in at least one direction.<br>
According to the invention it has been realized that a movable exposure head may<br>
advantageously comprise two spatial light modulators, thereby facilitating a scanning<br>
by means of a two modulators at one time.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the light illumination apparatus comprises at least<br>
one exposure head and at least two light modulating arrangements<br>
each of said two light modulating arrangements comprising a spatial light modulator<br>
and an associated light emitter arranged for illumination of an illumination surface<br>
via said spatial light modulator,<br>
each of said two light modulating arrangements being digitally controlled,<br>
said apparatus comprising means for performing a relative movement between said at<br>
least one exposure head and said illumination surface in at least one direction.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said at least two light modulating arrangements<br>
are arranged on the same exposure head.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said relative movement is a scanning movement<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said relative movement is established by moving<br>
the at least one exposure head relative to said illumination surface.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said relative movement is established by moving<br>
said illumination surface relative to the at least one exposure head.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, at least one exposure head comprises two light<br>
modulating arrangements. It has thus been established that a cost-effective way of<br>
illuminating an illumination surface is by applying two spatial light modulation<br>
arrangements in one exposure head, thereby obtaining an illumination arrangement,<br>
which may illuminate the illumination surface in a relatively high-speed scanning<br>
movement. In this context is noted that an exposure head may be somewhat difficult<br>
to deal with when the weight of the moving arrangement increases.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said relative movement is established by moving<br>
said illumination surface relative to the at least one exposure head.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, at least one exposure head comprises two light<br>
modulating arrangements.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said light modulating arrangements are arranged<br>
on at least two different exposure heads and where said exposure heads perform<br>
scanning movements over the illumination surface. When applying two or more free-<br>
running scanning exposure heads, the illumination may be optimized carefully to the<br>
illumination surface, thereby avoiding so-called "over-scanning". In principle, any<br>
superfluous scanning may be avoided or at least minimized due to the fact that the<br>
scanning performed by the exposure heads may be adapted to avoid any conflicting<br>
movement between the applied exposure heads. Thus, a number of free-running<br>
exposure heads illuminating an illumination surface by scanning is quite<br>
advantageous with respect to efficiency due to the fact that the scanning movement<br>
as such ensures a high-speed illumination, while the free-running heads ensure that<br>
the illumination of the illumination area may be optimized as described above.<br><br>
According to a further embodiment of the above-described free-running exposure<br>
heads, the number may exceed two, e.g. three or further heads in total. Moreover,<br>
each head may e.g. comprise two or further illumination arrangements, e.g. of the<br>
type described in fig. 2.<br>
When said spatial light modulators being arranged so as to illuminate two<br>
substantially separate sub-areas of said illumination surface, an advantageous<br>
embodiment of the invention has been obtained.<br>
When said spatial light modulating arrangements being aligned so that the rows of<br>
both light modulators are parallelly oriented, an advantageous embodiment of the<br>
invention has been obtained.<br>
When said spatial light modulating arrangements being aligned so that the<br>
neighboring rows of the two spatial light modulators are positioned substantially so<br>
that the distance (DN) between the two neighboring rows of the two spatial light<br>
modulators are substantially the same as the distance (DR) between the rows of the<br>
individual light modulators, an advantageous embodiment of the invention has been<br>
obtained.<br>
When the "x-projection" (D1) of the distance between the centers of the two spatial<br>
light modulators being less than 200 millimeters, preferably less than 150<br>
millimeters, preferably substantially 120 millimeters, an advantageous embodiment<br>
of the invention has been obtained.<br>
When the "y-projection" (D2) of the distance between the centers of the two spatial<br>
light modulators being less than 50 millimeters, preferably less than 35 millimeters,<br>
preferably substantially 25.6 millimeters or 20.5 millimeters when applying SXGA,<br>
and XGA respectively, an advantageous embodiment of the invention has been<br>
obtained.<br><br>
When the distance between the centers of the two spatial light modulators being less<br>
than 121.73 millimeters (XGA) or 122,70 rmllimeters (SXGA), an advantageous<br>
embodiment of the invention has been obtained.<br>
According to the invention it has been recognized that a very close positioning of the<br>
light modulating arrangements facilitates an improved overall scanning speed in the<br>
sense that the effective scanning area is optimized. A minimizing of the distance<br>
therefore results in that both spatial light modulators of the exposure head are active<br>
as long as possible at the ends of the scanning lines.<br>
When said exposure head comprising cooling means, an advantageous embodiment<br>
of the invention has been obtained.<br>
Cooling means may e.g. comprise electrically driven fans.<br>
When each spatial light modulating arrangement comprising individual cooling<br>
means, an advantageous embodiment of the invention has been obtained.<br>
When said substantially separate sub-areas comprising neighboring surfaces of said<br>
illumination surface, an advantageous embodiment of the invention has been<br>
obtained.<br>
When said at least one direction being substantially transverse to a relative<br>
movement of said illumination surface, an advantageous embodiment of the<br>
invention has been obtained.<br>
When said at least one direction establishing that an illuminated pixel on said<br>
illumination surface is illuminated by means of a least two light modulators of said<br>
spatial light modulator, an advantageous embodiment of the invention has been<br>
obtained.<br><br>
When said at least one direction establishing that an illuminated pixel on said<br>
illumination surface is illuminated by means of at least one modulator row of said<br>
spatial light modulator, an advantageous embodiment of the invention has been<br>
obtained.<br>
When said exposure head being movable in at least two directions with respect to<br>
said illumination surface, an advantageous embodiment of the invention has been<br>
obtained.<br>
When said light emitter comprising a light source, an advantageous embodiment of<br>
the invention has been obtained.<br>

coupled to a light source, an advantageous embodiment of the invention has been<br>

invention has been obtained.<br>
When said light emitter comprising a LED matrix, an advantageous embodiment of<br>
the invention has been obtained.<br>
When said spatial light modulator comprising a DMD chip, an advantageous<br>
embodiment of the invention has been obtained.<br>
The spatial light modulating array of the illumination arrangements may be a<br>
transmissive micro-mechanical shutter array as disclosed in WO 98 47048 and WO<br>
98 47042, which are hereby included by reference.<br>
Another type of spatial modulator may be a DMD modulator or e.g. LCD light<br>
modulator.<br><br>
When said spatial light modulator comprising a micro-mechanical transmissive light<br>
modulator, an advantageous embodiment of the invention has been obtained.<br>
When said illumination surface comprising a printing plate, an advantageous<br>
embodiment of the invention has been obtained.<br>
When said illumination surface comprising a light sensitive material, such as epoxy,<br>
an advantageous embodiment of the invention has been obtained. Other light<br>
sensitive materials may be applied as well within the scope of the invention such as<br>
emulsions for silkscreen printing, PCB emulsions, etc.<br>
According to the invention, the illumination arrangement may be applied for so-<br>
called rapid prototyping.<br>
Moreover, the invention relates to a method of illuminating an illumination surface<br>
whereby at least two light modulating arrangements arranged on at least one<br>
exposure head, each comprising a spatial light modulator illuminate the illumination<br>
surface by a scanning movement.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said at least two light modulating arrangements<br>
are arranged on the same exposure head.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said at least two light modulating arrangements<br>
are arranged on different free-running exposure heads.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the illumination is performed by means of a light<br>
illumination apparatus according to any of the claims 1-31.<br><br>

Detailed description<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a view of a few main components of an exposure system, according<br>
to an advantageous embodiment of the invention.<br>
The illustrated system comprises an exposure head 12 comprising two illumination<br>
arrangements 20 arranged for illumination of an illumination surface 15. The<br>
exposure head 12 is suspended in a suspension (not shown). The suspension<br>
facilitates movement in the direction of the arrows under control by suitable<br>
electronic circuits (not shown).<br>
For illustrative purposes, two illumination areas I1, 12 illuminated by the spatial light<br>
modulators (e.g. DMD chips) arranged in the illumination arrangements 20 are<br>
indicated on the illumination surface. The illumination areas I1 and I2, may e.g.<br>
comprise 1024x768 (XGA) pixels or 1280 xl024 pixels (SXGA) if applying e.g. TI<br>
DMD-chips. The modulated pixels will, if applying a scanning movement, be<br>
switched dynamically from row to row (or column to column) thereby applying<br>
several pixels (e.g. a complete row of a spatial light modulator) for illumination of a<br>
single pixel on the illumination surface. Thereby, the delivered optical energy to a<br>
single pixel is increased.<br>
According to the illustrated embodiment, the exposure head is moved in the X-<br>
direction and the illumination surface 15 is moved stepwise in the Y-direction.<br>
Evidently, other relative movements may be applied within the scope of the<br>
invention. A further advantageous embodiment of the invention may e.g. imply a<br>
relative movement of the exposure head 12 in both directions X and Y while keeping<br>
the illumination surface stationary.<br>
The spatial light modulating array of the illumination arrangements may be a<br>
transmissive micro-mechanical shutter array as disclosed in WO 98 47048 and WO<br>
98 47042, which are hereby included by reference.<br><br>
Another type of spatial modulator may be a DMD modulator.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a preferred embodiment of one of the light modulating arrangements<br>
20 of fig. 1. The first part 21 of the arrangement 20 produces a focused and uniform<br>
beam of light. It comprises a lamp 210, a lamp driver 211, a blower 216 and a fan<br>
217, a protection glass 212, a shutter 213, a light-integrating rod 214 and beam<br>
shaping optics 215.<br>
The type of lamp 210 depends on the type of plate to be exposed. Possible types<br>
comprise conventional short arc bulbs, laser sources, diode arrays and more. A<br>
preferred conventional lamp might have a power consumption of 270 W, but the<br>
present invention is not in any way limited to this value, nor to the mentioned types<br>
of lamps. Alternatives such as 250 W and 350 W may be considered.<br>
The light from the lamp 210 is transmitted through a filter (e.g. IR or UV- filter<br>
depending on the application) 212, functioning as an interference filter, and through<br>
a shutter mechanism 213, making it possible to turn off the light beam without<br>
turning off the lamp. This is important as most lamp types need time before their<br>
light intensity and frequency is unvarying. A blower 216 and a fan 217 ensure the<br>
cooling of the lamp 210.<br>
Subsequently the light beam is transmitted through a light-integrating rod 214.<br>
Thereby the light is mixed, making the light throughout the beam uniform with<br>
regards to intensity. This ensures mat the light in the periphery of the beam has the<br>
same intensity as the light in the center of the beam. When the light leaves the light-<br>
integrating rod 214, the beam shaping optics 215 focuses it.<br>
The next part of the arrangement 20 modulates the light beam to reflect electronically<br>
stored image data. It comprises a light-modulating means 22 and means 224 for<br>
directing the unmodulated light beam towards the light-modulating means 22 without<br>
disturbing its modulated light beam output.<br><br>
Suited light-modulating means 22 comprises DMD modulators, transmissive shutters<br>
including LCD and micro-mechanical shutters and more. For the preferred<br>
embodiment of fig. 2, a DMD light-modulating chip 220 mounted on a PCB 221<br>
with a cooling plate 222 and a temperature sensor 223 is used.<br>
The light directing means 224 depends on the type of light-modulating means 22<br>
used. For transmissive light modulating means the unmodulated light beam is<br>
directed towards one side of the light modulating means, and the modulated light<br>
beam is emitted from the other side. In such an arrangement the light directing means<br>
224 might be excluded.<br>
For DMD modulators the unmodulated light beam is directed towards the same point<br>
as where the modulated light beam is emitted. This necessitates the use of light<br>
directing means 224. In the preferred embodiment of fig. 2, a TIR-prism is used for<br>
light directing means. TIR is an abbreviation meaning 'Total Internal Reflection'. A<br>
TIR-prism comprises a surface 225 which will act as a mirror to light coming from<br>
one direction (from the left for this specific embodiment), and will let light coming<br>
from another direction (from the top for this specific embodiment) straight through.<br>
The last part of the arrangement 20 focuses the multiple modulated light beams<br>
emitted from the light modulating means 220 on an illumination surface 24 (printing<br>
plate). It comprises a set of lenses / a macro lens 230 located within a housing 23.<br>
Fig. 3a illustrates a scanning pattern of an exposure head with respect to an<br>
illumination.<br>
The illustrated scanning pattern obtained by the fight illumination apparatus<br>
according to the invention, e.g. the illumination arrangement as described in fig. 2,<br>
involves that two illuminating arrangements 31, 32 of an exposure head 30a perform<br>
a relative movement with respect to an illumination surface. Both illumination<br>
arrangements 31, 32 are arranged on the same exposure head 30a.<br><br>
One of the illustrated illumination arrangements 31 illuminates the sub areas SUB1<br>
and the other illumination arrangement 32 illuminates the sub areas SUB2.<br>
It should be noted that the exposure head 30a illuminates the illumination surface by<br>
modulated light in both directions in a scanning movement as indicated by the<br>
horizontal arrows while shifting between each scanning movement in steps 301, as<br>
indicated by the vertical arrow.<br>
The y-axis movement is here performed as steps corresponding to the total transverse<br>
scanning width obtained by both light illuminating arrangements in combination.<br>
Fig. 3b illustrates a further scanning pattern of an exposure head 30b with respect to<br>
an illumination surface.<br>
According to the illustrated embodiment of the invention, an exposure head 30b<br>
comprises two spatial light modulators 31, 32 (the illumination arrangements<br>
carrying the spatial modulators are not illustrated). The applied illumination<br>
arrangements 31, 32 may e.g. both be the illustrated illumination arrangement of fig.<br>
2. According to the illustrated embodiment, two spatial light modulators 31, 32 (or<br>
the resulting illuminated surface corresponding to I1, and I2 of fig. 1) are arranged<br>
and displaced only in the Y-direction.<br>
The exposure head 30b is performing a scanning movement back and forth in the X-<br>
direction. Moreover, the illumination surface or the exposure head performs a<br>
relative movement in the Y-direction involving basically two different steps, a micro<br>
step 302 and a macro step 303.<br>
According to the illustrated embodiment, eight sub-areas SUB1 and eight sub-areas<br>
SUB2 are illuminated by performing the micro-steps 302. Thereafter, a macro step<br>
303 is performed and a new set of sub-areas, SUB1 and SUB2, is illuminated by<br>
performing further micro steps 302.<br><br>
It should be emphasized that several other scanning methods (patterns) may be<br>
applied within the scope of the invention.<br>
Fig. 4a illustrates an advantageous positioning of the illuminating arrangements (here<br>
= optical engines) on the exposure head of e.g. fig. 3a. The illumination arrangement<br>
20, which e.g. may be the one illustrated in fig. 2, is indicated by dashed lines.<br>
The dimensions of the optical engine are very important for the productivity and cost<br>
of the machine. The two illuminating arrangements 20 of the exposure head are<br>
located so that the obtainable illuminated areas are adjacent in the direction of the y-<br>
axis (not to be confused with the scanning and modulator axis). This implies that<br>
there is a center distance between the optical engines in the x-axis, see fig. 4a.<br>
The mutual distance between the engines in the x-axis implies that it is necessary to<br>
expose longer than the actual plate length so that both heads have passed the entire<br>
plate (the illumination surface). This superfluous "over- scan" is twice the center<br>
distance Dl. This over-scan reduces the productivity and increases the width of the<br>
x-movement and thus the width of the machine. The center distance must therefore<br>
be as low as possible. An example of such minimized distance may e.g. be<br>
Center distance, x-axis: D1=120 mm<br>
Center distance, y-axis: D2= (XGA) 20.48 ± 0.002 mm and D2 (SXGA) = 25.6 ±<br>
0.002 mm<br>
The lower limit is defined by the optics and the further illumination arrangement<br>
component, e.g. the macro lens 230 of fig. 2. A fixture (not shown) will allow<br>
adjustment in the iUumination plane, i.e. adjustment in x- and y-axis, and rotation<br>
about the z-axis, of the optical engines individually. This implies that the image must<br>
be accurately parallel to the flange of the macro lens house, so that both images will<br>
be in the same plane. The flange on the house is used to mount the house to the<br>
fixture, in the z-direction. The bottom side of the flange will define the focus, so that<br><br>
the optical engines can be mounted against a flat surface, and thus having focus in<br>
the same plane.<br>
Fig. 4b illustrates a further embodiment of the invention, where the apparatus<br>
comprises four light modulating arrangements 53, 54, 55, 56, e.g. of the type<br>
illustrated in fig. 2, arranged on an exposure head 50.<br>
The four light modulating arrangements 53, 54, 55 and 56 all move together due to<br>
the fixation to the same exposure head. A scanning may advantageously be<br>
performed in several different ways, e.g. according to the principles illustrated in fig.<br>
3a.<br>
Fig. 4c illustrates a further embodiment of the invention, where the apparatus<br>
comprises two light modulating arrangements 62, 63, e.g. of the type illustrated in<br>
fig. 2.<br>
The illustrated embodiment comprises two separate exposure heads 60, 61, each<br>
carrying a modulating arrangement 62, 63.<br>
The illustrated embodiment of the invention has the advantage that the illumination,<br>
when applying a scanning e.g. in the direction of the illustrated arrows, may be<br>
optimized carefully to the illumination surface, thereby avoiding the above-described<br>
"over-scanning". In principle, any superfluous scanning may be avoided due to the<br>
fact that the scanning performed by the exposure heads 60, 61 may be adapted to<br>
avoid any conflicting movement between the applied exposure heads 60, 61.<br>
The illustrated embodiment, featuring a number of free-running exposure heads<br>
illuminating an illumination surface by scanning, is quite advantageous with respect<br>
to efficiency due to the fact that the scanning movement as such ensures a high-speed<br>
iDumination, while the free-running heads ensure that the illumination of the<br>
illumination area may be optimized as described above.<br><br>
Evidently, the embodiment of fig. 4c may be modified to incorporate further<br>
illumination heads, e.g. three or further heads in total.<br><br>
