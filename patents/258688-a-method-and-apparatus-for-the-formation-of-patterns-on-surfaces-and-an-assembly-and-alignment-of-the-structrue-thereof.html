				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus Tor the formation of patterns on surfaces and an<br>
assembly and alignment of the structures thereof. It further relates to patterning/lithography on micro- or<br>
nano- meter scales. In addition, it relates to rapid and spontaneous generation and modulation of patterns<br>
directly on soft solids through clastic deformation. It also pertains to a method of patterning which enables<br>
formation of patterns tlvat can be transformed in situ, erased, reformed, and eventually made less<br>
dcformable. It further relates to a method in which the final pattern on the substrate is morphologically and<br>
structurally distinct from the pattern on the stamp.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Patterning of substrates on micro- or nano- meter scales is of great technological importance in the<br>
fabrication of semiconductors, integrated circuits, optical devices like display devices, anti-reflective<br>
surface coatings, MEMS/MEMS, chemical or biological sensors, DNA enrichment and other biojogkal<br>
applications, lab-on-a-chip diagnostic devices, etc.<br>
Patterns arc generated on thin films or substrates by various litliographic techniques including conventional<br>
optical lithography and alternative soft lithographic techniques described in the reference Xia, Y and<br>
Whitcsides. G. M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1998, 37, 550, like micro contact printing, micro molding in<br>
capillaries, replica molding, etc. However, all these techniques involve generating patterns that cannot then<br>
be transformed or modified in situ nor erased and reformed. The patterns are generated in the materials that<br>
arc in the liquid form or the polymers that are heated above their glass transition temperature, and then the<br>
patterns arc made less dcformable by lowering the temperature, by evaporation of solvents or by chemical<br>
reactions. Patterns formed are positive or negative replica of the mold or stamp used. [We will use the term<br>
'stamp' hereon interchangeably with any of the commonly accepted terms for the surface containing the<br>
pattern to be transferred from (e.g., mask, mold, master, template)]. Such patterns are said to have a simple<br>
geometrical correlation to the pattern on the stamp. The generation of complex patterns significanth<br>
different from that on the stamp, and thereby having a complex geometrical correlation with those on the<br>
stamp, is not feasible by these techniques. Also, processing in the liquid form may take many minutes to<br>
hours because of the slow kinetics of flow. None of these techniques exploit elastic deformation of surface<br>
layer for self-assembly of patterns.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,713,2.18 describes a method for formation of patterns in a liquid film by the deformation of<br>
its surface induced by a stamp placed above the material but physically separated from the film by a gap<br>
The self-assembled pattern forms under the stamp because of viscous flow of liquid - not because of elastic<br>
deformations. Periodic discrete pillars dial have a height equal to the separation gap distance between the<br>
film and the stamp arc formed and then made permanent by cooling the liquid. Pillars are formed under the<br>
protrusions of the stamp (positive replica of the stamp). The time for the pattern formation can be large,<br>
from minutes to hours, because of the viscous flow mechanisms involved. The lateral feature size in the<br>
pattern is determined by the long-wave instability of the liquid layer which results in the lateral feature<br>
sizes substantially greater than the sur&amp;cc layer thickness (typically - &gt; 50 times the surface layer<br>
thickness). Moreover, the lateral feature size depends on the materials of the substrate, surface layer and the<br>
stamp, as well as the gap between the stamp and the surface layer (sec Chou, S. Y. and Zhuang, L. J. Vac<br>
Sci. Technol. B 1999, 17(6), 3197).<br>
U. S. Pat. No. 5,772,905 describes a method and apparatus for forming nanometer si/cd patterns in which<br>
a thin film is deposited on the substrate and heated above its glass transition temperature. Subsequently, a<br>
mold having protruding and recessed features is pressed into the thin film to form a negative replica of the<br>
pattern on the stamp by liquid flow. The mold is removed after cooling, leaving a more permanent negative<br>
replica of the mold.<br>
U. S. Pat. No. 6,818,139 describes a method in which a polymer thin film is deposited on the substrate. A<br>
rigid mold having the desired shape and pattern is pressed into the polymer film at room temperature by<br>
high pressure compression techniques. The polymer undergoes irreversible plastic deformation and flow at<br>
high pressures to replicate the pattern in the mold. The polymer is made to undergo glass transition and thus<br>
made liquid- like at room temperature by absorbing a solvent. The solvent is evaporated alter which the<br>
mold is removed leaving behind a more permanent negative replica of the mold in the surface layer.<br>
U. S. Pat. No. 2004009673 describes a method wherein patterns are generated in light curable liquids using<br>
electric fields and followed by curing of the activating light curable liquid. A thin film of light curable<br>
liquid is deposited on an electrically conductive substrate. A template formed of electrically conductive and<br>
non-conductive portions is brought into close proximity to the deposited thin liquid layer. Application of<br>
the electric field across the liquid layer generates patterns determined by the template, the liquid is attracted<br>
to the raised portions of the template. Activating light is applied to cure the light curable liquid and form<br>
patterns on the substrate.<br>
*<br>
In all the above techniques the patterns arc formed in liquid materials by flow and irreversible plastic<br>
deformations and then made less dcformablc to preserve the patterns. The lime taken for patterning<br>
depends on the kinetics of liquid flow, which can be relatively long for high molecular weight, high<br>
viscosity polymers. The rate of high viscosity polymeric liquid flow and pattern formation front the liquid<br>
state is thus usually quite slow (minutes to hours). The patterns formed cannot generally be further<br>
transformed, modified or manipulated in situ or erased anil reformed, since the position of stamp in all of<br>
these methods is kept fixed. Thus, morphologically and structurally distinct patterns cannot be created by<br>
using a single stamp. Further, the lateral lengthscale of the self-assembled patterns in liquid films<br>
processing is large compared to the film thickness and depends on the material properties of the polymer,<br>
substrate and the stamp. w<br>
Theoretical aspects of surface elastic deformation upon contact with a flat stamp are known (See Shenoy.<br>
V. and Shanna, A.. Physical Review Letters 2001, 86, 119). where it is shown that the lateral size of the<br>
randomly-oriented self-assembled features is about three times the surface layer thickness, and independent<br>
of the shear modulus and nature of stamp surface. However, no prior information is available on the<br>
following no\<cl and useful aspects: distinct morphologies or geometries of the resulting elastic patterns></cl>
(such as pillars, channels, wells...), (b) the control, modulation and alignment strategies of the pattern by<br>
relative movement of the stamp and the surface layer, and (c) surface patterning and the resulting pattern<br>
morphology by the use of pre-patterned stamps. The only pattern observed previously is a randomlvoriented<br>
labyrinth pattern formed by the contact of a flat, rigid stamp without any movement after contact<br>
(see MOnch, W. and Herminghaus, S. Europhys. Lett. 2001. 53. 525). However, a randomly rough surface<br>
has generally limited use in patterning applications. The novelty and non-obvious nature of the invention is<br>
in creating a variety of vastly more useful, ordered and aligned patterns of different morphologies by<br>
movements of rigid and flexible pre-patterncd stamps. Another non-obvious novelty is to create many<br>
morphologically or structurally distinct patterns by using the same stamp and m-situ modulation of the<br>
pattern by the stamp movement.<br>
Thus, the invention addresses a need for developing the low-cost technologies for rapid mass producing<br>
micron scale and sub-micron scale patterns, which are of importance in many technological applications.<br>
The generation of patterns that can be transformed, modified, manipulated in xiiu, erased and reformed at<br>
high speeds will have a major impact in a wide range of applications like smart materials, micro/nano -<br>
electro mechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS). micro reactors. DNA separation and enrichment techniques,<br>
chemical and biological sensors, microfluidic devices, lab-on-a-chip devices and more.<br>

Figure 1. is a schematic illustration of the vertical displacement of the stamp (2) from the surface layer (3) starting from complete contact as in (a) to the position just prior to the complete detachment between the surface layer and the stamp (d). In the figure (a) - complete contact, (b) &amp; (c) vertical displacement of the stamp in the direction of increasing distance from the substrate (1), (d) -position of the stamp relative to the surface layer at the instant just prior to complete detachment and D-is the separation distance between the surface layer and the stamp, CR -the contact area between the surface layer and the stamp. There is an increase in the height of the structures when the separation distance increased as illustrated in (b) and (c).<br>
Figure 2. shows plotting of the wavelength and the scaling of the features as a function of the thickness of the surface layer (H). (a) Wavelength of the features when the surface layer is of thickness greater than lµA - low surface energy stamp and the shear modulus of surface layer of 1.02 MPa, B- low surface energy stamp and shear modules of 0.1 MPa, C-high surface energy stamp and sheat modulus of surface layer is 1.02 MPa. The non-dependence of the pattern lengthscale on the modulus of the surface layer and the material of stamp is clearly exhibited (b) The change in the scaling of wavelength when the<br><br>
thickness of the surface layer is reduced. The increase in scaling from approximately 3 * H at thickness greater than about 500 nm to more than 5 * H at about 200nm is noticed.<br>
Figure 3 (a) is a Schematic of the pattering induced in the elastic surface layer by the stamp in close proximity A- stamp B -elastic surface layer, C substrate. The axes x, y, z are shown with respect to the geometry of the stamp. Lateral displacement referred to in the document refers to the movement in the x or y axes.

Figure 9 shows formation of beaker like structures as the stamp is brought closer to the surface layer Stripe pattern of the stamp is first replicated in the surface layer and as the gap is reduced, bridging between the stripes occurs, forming micro-wells. The lengthscale of these structures also corresponds to that of elastic instability (3 * H), thickness of surface layer = 980nm and the center to center distance between the wells is about 3 |im. A sketch of the stamp is shown to indicate that the bridges form under the recessed regions of the stamp.<br>

Figure 11 is an AFM micrographs of the cross patterns on the surface layer by the two- step process. The change in the thickness of the deformable surface layer gives rise to a change in the patters, thought the stamp used in both the cases is the same. The stamp was a flexible micro-patterned aluminum foil. The stamp periodicity was 1.5 nm and the height of the protrusion was 80 nm (a) Patterns formed on the surface layer of thickness 700nm and (b) patterns formed on the surface layer of thickness 200nm.<br>

The inventive method (ECIL) involves first bringing a flat or pre-patterned stamp in close proximity to the<br>
surface layer of a visco-clastic solid or placing the former in gentle contact with the latter (i.e.. without the<br>
application of high pressures that arc required for irreversible viscous and plastic flows of surface layers)<br>
The pressure applied on the surface layer on contact is low enough so that the stress in the surface layer is<br>
+•<br>
significantly less than the yield stress of the material of the surface layer. This ensures that there is no<br>
significant irreversible plastic deformation of the surface layer in this method. A material is said to be<br>
predominantly clastic if the storage modulus (G') is at least an order of magnitude greater than the toss<br>
modulus (GM) (Sec Brady, R. F. Jr. cd. Polymer Characterization and Analysis. OUP, USA, 2002X The<br>
modulus is obtained from standard rhcological characterization techniques such as parallel plate oscObmr<br>
rhcomctcr (Sec Brady. R. F. Jr. cd. Polymer Characterization and Analysis, OUP. USA. 2002) and<br>
Dynamic Mechanical Analy/er (Sec Menard. K. P. Dynamic Mechanical Anahyas: A Practical<br>
Introduction, CRC press. FL. USA, 1999). Herein, Hie shear modulus of elasticity is referred to as the shear<br>
modulus. The material of the surface layer used for patterning must be predominantly elastic in nature and<br>
have a shear modulus less lli;in 100 MPa. more preferably less than 10 MPa. When the elastic deformation<br>
is difficult, the modulus can be reduced by heating and/or by a solvent and/or by the addition of plasticLdng<br>
agent in the surface layer (Sec Sperling. L. H., Introduction to Physical Polymer Science, John WDey,<br>
USA, 1992). The clastic modulus is reduced by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude by heating below glass<br>
transition in the so called "Rubbery Plateau Region" bringing it down to about 1 MPa range for polystyrene<br>
for example (Sec Sperling, L. H., Introduction to Physical Polymer Science, John Wilty, USA, 1992V. In<br>
general, the surface layer of the substrate can be made from clastomcric materials, including polymers like<br>
polydimcthylsiloxanc (PDMS). Polyurcthanc, Polybutadiene. St&gt;Tenc-butadiene-$tyrene copotymer.<br>
polyisobutylene. polyisoprcnc. crosslinkcd-polyacrylamide etc.. or their composites with other materials.<br>
The substrate can itself be an clastomcric material or a polymer or glass, quart/, semiconductors <c .></c>
silicon. GaAs). metal, or metal oxide or (heir composites. The stamp can be made of metal, polymer, or<br>
their composites, and having a flal surface or an appropriate pattern on it. Ttic stamp can be rigid or flexible<br>
like a thin metal foil or polymeric ribbon. Since some of the theoretical aspects of surface elastic<br>
deformations upon contact with a flat stamp arc known, the ECIL method is firmly grounded in the basic<br>
physics of clastic surface deformations, which makes it possible to generalize it to all soft surface layers<br>
regardless of the substrate and the stamp materials<br>
The thickness of the surface layer, defined here as H. can be from a monoatomk layer to several<br>
micrometers. The separation distance between the surface layer and the stamp when the pattern first forms<br>
is typically up to 1000 nm. more preferably up to 500 nm. most preferably upto 100 nm. The separation<br>
«*<br>
distance is controlled, for example, by a pic/.o-clcctric positioner, induction motor or a stepper motor with <br>
micrometer or nanometer step precision, and the separation distance is measured by suitable non-contact<br>
techniques. After formation of a pattern, stamp can be vertically moved to modify the pattern to any extent<br>
desired from complete contact to the complete detachment of the surface layer from the stamp, which is<br>
typically less than tens of microns, but depends on the surface layer thickness, its shear modulus and the<br>
strength of adhesion between the stamp and the surface layer. Figure 1 schematically represents the<br>
displacement of the stamp from the surface layer beginning from complete contact (a) where the stamp is in<br>
uniform, intimate and complete contact with (lie surface layer and there are no cavities or columns. The<br>
surface layer attains a morphology1 that is the same as that of the stamp surface (in the schematic^ flat<br>
stamp is shown). As the stamp is displaced vertically relative to the surface layer, the elastic instability<br>
induced patterns are generated The height of the patterns generated depend on the vertical displacement of<br>
the stamp and the height increases with the displacement of the stamp as it is displaced away from the<br>
surface layer, as represented schematically in figures Ib and k. Figure Id represents the position of the<br>
stamp relative to the surface layer at the instant just prior to complete detachment a few isolated points of<br>
contact between the surface layer and the stamp remaining at this position. The elastic surface pattern, if<br>
not made less deformablc at any of the above stages, disappears upon complete detachment. The patterns at<br>
any vertical displacement can also be modified and aligned by lateral movements of the stamp. The stamp<br>
movement is stopped after obtaining a desired pattern, which is then made less deformaWe before removing<br>
the stamp. The lateral relative movement of stamp and surface layer, while maintaining some contact<br>
between them, for modification and alignment of pattern, is typically less than 1000 times the surface layer<br>
thickness.<br>
In the above ECIL method, movement of the stamp creates distinct self-assembled patterns betwwn the<br>
stamp and the surface layer at different positions of the stamp. The surface layer deforms spontaneously in<br>
this method because of an clastic instability. It involves a complex interplay of adhesive interactions which<br>
tend to destabilise the surface layer like long range van dcr Waals interaction, electrostatic interaction,<br>
electric field, etc and the clastic restoring force and surface energies that hav^ a stabilizing effect. The<br>
nature of the interactions lends to the formation of patterns, such as pillars, channels, cavities or wells,<br>
labyrinths or a combination of these, that liave a length scale that depends mostly on the thickness of the<br>
•** surface layer and the lateral dimension of the pattern on the stamp. In particular, the lateral lengthscale is in<br>
the range of 2H to 10H. more likely in the range of 2H to 4H for micron thickness surface layers, but larger<br>
for thinner surface layers (about 6 H for 100-200 nm surface layers). The wavelength of die patterns and<br>
the scaling of the wavelength with the thickness of the surface layer arc shown in the plot in figure 2 fora<br>
flat stamp. The lengthscale of the patterns varies linearly with the ti***"^ of the snrfece layer and is<br>
independent of (he shear modulus and the nature of the material of the tfanp (as seen in plot in fig. 2a). The<br>
lengthscale of the pattern is between 2H - 4H for surface layer thickness greater than about 600 nm. For<br>
thickness less than 600 run, the lateral lengthscale increases slowly and becomes about 6H for a surface<br>
layer of 200 nm thickness (figure 2b). For substantially thinner surface layers (
effects become increasingly important and may increase further the scaling of the lateral lengthscale of the<br>
pattern - n H, where n &gt; 6. For these very thin surface layers, the surface tension can be reduced, for<br>
example by adding another liquid in the gap between the surface layer and the stamp, to reduce the effect of<br>
surface tension on the lengthscale. This clastic lengthscale in the range of 2H to 10H is clearly different<br>
from the methods (see Chou. S. Y. and Zhuang, L. J. Vac. Sci. Technol B 1999^17(6), 3197) that involve<br>
self-assembly of LIQUID films, where the lengthscale is much larger than the film thickness (usually<br>
greater than 50 H) and where it depends on the gap thickness, surface layer thickness and (he<br>
stamp/substrate materials nonlinearly (see Sharma, A. Langmuir 1993. 9. 861, Shanna. A. &amp; Rcitcr, G. <br>
Colliod Interface Sci 1996. 178, 383). The lengthscale of the elastic self-assembly is independent of the<br>
stamp material and the shear modulus of the surface layer. Also, the rale of elastic deformation and pattern<br>
formation is very fast, generally occurring at about the speed of sound for purely clastic materials.<br>
compared to minutes to hours required for self-assembled patterns in liquid films by viscous flow (see<br>
Chou. S. Y and Zhuang, L. J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B 1999, 17(6), 3197. US Pat. No. 6.713,238).<br>
The key step in the method involves modulation of self-assembled patterns on the surface layer \ia<br>
displacement of the stamp relative to surface layer. . Since the deformations are dominanUy elastic in<br>
nature, the relative movement of stamp with respect to the surface layer rapidly creates a variety of<br>
morphologically distinct patterns using a single stamp, which is a significant advancement over prior art<br>
The surface layer becomes flat and deformation free if the stamp is completely detached. This property<br>
i<br>
makes it possible to generate patterns in the surface layer that arc erasable in nature, can be transformed,<br>
modified or manipulated in situ. This opens up many new applications in the fields of micro fluidics.<br>
MEMS/NIEMS. medicine, biology, smart materials and chemistry.<br>
Figure 3a. schematically shows the generation of patterns in the surface layer in close proximity to a stamp,<br>
which may be Hat or ore-patterned. The axis and the vertical, lateral and angular directions of displacement<br>
arc shown in reference to the substrate. The modification in the morphological structures varying from<br>
columns to labyrinths to cavities by the vertical displacement of the stamp, isotropic in nature, formed by<br>
using a flat stamp are shown in the optical micrographs in figures 3b, 3c and 3d respectively, the stamp<br>
being displaced progressively towards the substrate.<br>
When (he stamp is withdrawn from the surface layer until complete detachment, the patterns disappear, and<br>
the surface layer undergoes relaxation to form flat layer. Hence, it is necessary to have an additional step to<br>
preserve the resultant pattern on the surface layer upon the removal of the stamp. This step of rendering<br>
surface layer less dcformable consists of prior art or similar methods such as exposure to reactive crosslinking<br>
chemistries, or curing electromagnetic radiation or thermal curing. For example, for silicon<br>
containing surface layers, the patterns formed can be exposed to intense UV emissions of 185 and 254 nm<br>
wavelength for a time of the order of 30 minutes, by holding the stamp at the desired position, resulting in<br>
the formation of ozone, active oxygen and also excitation of organic molecules. The silicon containing<br>
surface layer undergoes oxidation producing stiff silica like layer on the surface (See Hillborg, H., Ankncr,<br>
J. F., Gcddc U. W., Smith, G. D., Yasuda, H. K.( Wikstrom, K. Polymer 2000,41,68591). This layer has a<br>
much higher modulus and prevents the relaxation of the surface layer thus preserving the patterns. We<br>
define this process as surface hardening and this renders the surface patterns less deformable. The modulus<br>
of the stiff layer increases with the time of exposure to UV radiation and thus can be controlled. The<br>
relatively long exposure time of the order of 30 minutes renders the surface patterns substantially less<br>
dcformable. The schematic of the process is shown in figure 4. Partial hardening refers to the increase in<br>
the modulus of the surface layer by a relatively short time of exposure to UV (about 5 minutes). The<br>
surface layer is hardened partially so that the immediate relaxation of the surface patterns is avoided when<br>
the stamp is completely withdrawn. Surface hardening in PDMS can also be induced by exposure to<br>
oxygen plasma or o/.onc atmosphere (Sec Bowdcn, N., Brittain, S., Evans, A. G., Hutchinson, J. W. and<br>
«<br>

Yasuda. H. K. and Wikstrom. K. Polymer 2000, 41, 6851).<br>
In one embodiment, the modulation of separation distance is done repeatedly until a desired pattern is<br>
obtained on the surface layer and then the resultant pattern is made less-defonnable by above described<br>
methods.<br>
In another embodiment, a sequence of separation distance modulation and partial liardening is employed to<br>
create a desired pattern, which is then followed by another cycle of patterning, eventually followed by a<br>
more complete hardening of the surface layer to preserve it.<br>
These and other aspects of the invention arc now described in the experiments described below:<br>
Experiments were performed on crosslinked polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films (surface layers) of<br>
thickness range varying from about 0.2 to about 15 urn, deposited on glass substrate. The shear modulus of<br>
the surface layer was varied from about 0.01 MPa to 1.02 MPa by varying the concentration of the<br>
crosslinker between 5 % and 10 % in the casting solution. The PDMS surface layer was spin coated from<br>
solution in hexane and then cured at 130° C for 12 hours to crosslink the PDMS and yield a dominantly<br>
clastic surface layer.<br>
Bringing of a stamp into close proximity or in gentle contact to the deposited surface layer spontaneously<br>
deforms the surface forming patterns whose lateral dimensions arc determined by the thickness of the<br>
surface layer. Withdrawing the stamp to complete detachment from the surface layer causes the patterns to<br>
disappear and the surface layer regains its original flat morphology over a certain period time, typically<br>
about 30-60 seconds for our PDMS layers. The experiments were performed at the room temperature of<br>
about 23 ± 2° C.<br>
The random isotropic patterns that are generated when a flat stamp was used were arranged and aligned by<br>
the use of a pre-patterned stamp or by lateral displacements of the stamp in contact with the surface layer<br>
and aflcr the generation of patterns. The atomic force microscope micrograph of the silicon stamp used is<br>
shown in Figure 5; the stamp had periodic alternative protruding and recessed regions. The widths of the<br>
protruding and recessed features on the stamp used were equal and two different sized stamps of periodicity<br>
of 3 urn and 1.5 urn and protrusion heights of 100 nm and 80 nm respectively were used. The stamp used is<br>
a typical example and the patterns on the stamp are not limited to that shown in figure 5. The patterned<br>
i<br>
stamp was brought in close proximity by placing it on the surface layer. The region of the surface layer<br>
.**<br>
below the protrusions in the stamp experiences greater attractive interaction and this region rises towards<br>
the surface of the stamp thus increasing in height as shown schematically in figure 6. The geometry of the<br>
surface layer patterns and their height is determined by the position of the mask/stamp in the vernal<br>
direction with respect to the substrate within the limits of complete detachment and corapiae contact of<br>
surface layer and the mask/stamp (further referred to as separation gap distance). By varying the moveim<br>
of the stamp in the vertical direction from this position, the patterns on the surface layer can be modified ID<br>
form various patterns like discrete pillars, a positive replica of the pattern on the stamp, * negative repica<br>
of the pattern on the stamp, femto liter 'wells' or a combination of these.<br>
Figure 6 shows a schematic sketch of the modulation of patients by the vertical displacement of the scpnp<br>
The region of the surface layer below the protrusions on the stamp experiences greater attraction and there<br>
is an increase in height of the surface layer in the region below the protruding features on the stamp. Tfas<br>
leads to the formation of the positive replica of the patterns on the stamp. As the stamp is displaced n tte<br>
vertical direction away from the surface layer, columns or pillars aligned along the protrusions of the aanp<br>
arc formed. On displacing the stamp towards the surface layer and applying some pressure by hand. UK<br>
protrusions on the stamp sink into the surface layer to form an imprint patterns which is the negatne repfoa<br>
of the stamp pattern.<br>
Figure 7a shows the schematic of the positive replica of the pattern on the stamp and the Atomic FORK<br>
Microscopy (AFM) micrograph of the replicated pattern in the surface layer of thickness about I<br>
schematic of the process is shown in figure 7b. The patterns were spontaneously generated ui the<br>
layer when the stamp was placed on it and no external pressure was applied except for the waghi of ibe<br>
stamp. The patterns formed only under the protrusions of the stamp and not under the recessed regions The<br>
patterns thus formed on the PDMS surface layer were exposed to the UV radiation for 30 minutes msaki^?<br>
them substantially less deformable thus preserving them and then imaged under AFM A positive repfoca of"<br>
the pattern but with an aspect ratio higher than that of the stamp patterns is formed The height o« '±e<br>
patterns in the surface layer here was about 430 nm. When the thickness of the surface layer was reduced to<br>
480 nm. the resulting pattern contained multiple ridges which are aligned along the protrusions or the<br>
stamp pattern as shown in figure 7c.<br>
*<br>
Figure 8 shows the formation of pillars generated by the collapse of the stripes caused by the %ero^ii<br>
+*<br>
displacement of the stamp from the previous position, increasing (lie distance from the substrate The bach*<br>
of the patterns (pillars) in this case is about 450 nm. The AFM micrograph of the pillars is shown in<br>
8a and the schematic of the process is shown in figure 8b.<br>
Figure 9 shows AFM micrograph of the micro wells generated having a volume of few femto liters, when<br>
the stamp is brought closer towards the substrate, starting from the position as described in reference to<br>
figure 7. The straight channel pattern (positive replica of the stamp) gets transformed into a periodic array<br>
of micro wells by the formation of "bridges" between Ihe stripes. The reduction in the gap distance between<br>
the stamp and the surface layer induces secondary instabilities that results in the formation of "bridges"<br>
across the channels in the surface layer resulting in the formation of "micro-well" patterns. The periodicity<br>
of the wells also shows a scaling which is about to 3 x H (H is the thickness of the surface layer) which is<br>
similar to the scaling of elastic instability. The height of the patterns in this morphology' is about 380 nm<br>
indicating Uic displacement of the stamp towards the substrate, the thickness of the surface layer is 980 nm.<br>
The spacing of these wells is about 3 urn, which indeed corresponds to that for the clastic instability.<br>
Figure 10 shows AFM micrographs of the patterns generated when the stanjp is brought closer to the<br>
surface layer. The patterns tend towards the formation of the negative replica of the pattern on the stamp.<br>
The protruding features in the pattern on the surface layer now arc formed under the recessed regions of the<br>
stamp. The stamp is represented by the sketch drawn on the AFM micrograph to indicate the position of the<br>
surface patterns with respect to the pattern on the stamp. The height of the patterns in this case is about 110<br>
nm. The remnants of the cavities which are generated on closer proximity of the stamp to surface layer<br>
remains, but will disappear and an exact replica of the pattern on stamp will be formed by further pressing<br>
it gently.<br>
The two dimensional crossed patterns can also be generated on the surface layer by using a stamp with one<br>
dimensional features by a two step process. We have used a flexible micro-patterned aluminum foil as the<br>
stamp. The wavelength of the pattern on the stamp was 1.5 um and the height of the protrusion was 80 nm.<br>
In this method initially, the desired pattern is formed by the above described method and is partially<br>
hardened by exposing the surface layer to UV radiation, holding the stamp in the desired position for about<br>
5-10 minutes, the increase in the modulus is sufficient to prevent the immediate relaxation of the surface<br>
»<br>
layer after the stamp is removed from the surface layer. The patterned stamp was then again brought into<br>
** close proximity or contact with Uic surface layer after rotating it by some angle different from the first<br>
position (in this example, rotation is close to 90°). The resulting patterns show a network of channels and<br>
columns. The examples shown in figure 11 arc generated by positioning the stamp where the patterns on<br>
the stamp are at an angle to the initial surface patterns. In figure lla, the surface layer thickness was 300<br>
nm. The first pattern was a positive replica of the stamp. These are convened to rectangular columns after<br>
the second step described above. Figure 1 Ib shows the patterns generated in a surface layer of thickness 90<br>
nm. The patterns formed after the first step was the split stripes which results in the patterns with spikes<br>
after the second step.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, aligned or ordered patterns in the surface laye/ are<br>
generated by lateral displacement of the stamp with respect to the surface layer. The isotropic random<br>
patterns are generated when a flat stamp is brought into close proximity to the surface layer. Figure 12<br>
shows the alignment of the isotropic randomly oriented labyrinth structures, formed initially from the<br>
proximity of the flat stamp, by .the lateral displacement of the stamp, the arrows in figure 12 representing<br>
the direction of displacement of the stamp. The stamp when displaced laterally, but maintaining the<br>
separation gap distance between the stamp and the surface layer constant, at a velocity of about I inm/s Tor<br>
1 second resulted in the 1-D alignment of the labyrinth fingers in the direction of the displacement as seen<br>
in figure 12b. The length-scale of the pattern in the direction perpendicular to the direction of movement<br>
does not change wlien it is aligned. Second displacement of the contactor but in a direction perpendicular to<br>
the first displacement yields a square 2-D array of rectangular cavities; the FFT of the image shows a<br>
periodic array exhibiting symmetry of eight neighboring cavities (Figure 12c).<br>
The experiments were performed also with hvdrogel and it exhibits similar pattern generation on the<br>
surface lavcr as with PDMS surface layers thus showing that this technique (EC1U is general in nature and<br>
can be applied to various class of sofl materials. Polvacrvlamide (PAA) hvdrogcls \»crc prepared by<br>
polymerization of aery lamidc (5 % w/w) with N. N - Mcthylcnc bis- acrylamidc as crosslinking agent (0.1<br>

glass plates (one of which is silani/.cd to enable easy removal of Ihc plate from the surface laycr_..aflgr<br>
i<br>
casting) using a spacer to ensure the required thickness of the surface lavcr. An clastic surface layer is<br>
+*<br>
formed in about 5 minutes. A patterned stamp is brought into close proximity of the surface lavcr as per the<br>
procedure described earlier for PDMS. Figure 13 shows the optical and atomic force microscopy<br>
micrographs of the patterns generated by ECIL on the hvdrogel surface laver of thickness of about 2 pm.<br>
The stamp used is the same as shown in figure 5. The positive replica of the «*«mp hut with a periodicity of<br>
about 5 92 um which is close to the expected scaling of 3H (H is the thidmess of the surface lavcrt is seen<br>
in figure 13a. The height of ihc structure is about 780 nm. On closer approach of the stamp to the surface<br>
layer, micro - wells are generated (figure 13b). The height of the structures is about 630 nm. The centre to<br>
centre distance between ihc micro wells is aboul 6 um. which again corresponds to the scaling that is<br>
cltaractcristic of the elastic instability. Figure 13c is an optical micrograph of the micro well pajtems<br>
indicating the larger area patterning and alignment of the wells. The process of pattern formation in<br>
hvdrogcl surface layers is the same as in the PDMS surface layers and is engendered bv the elastic<br>
instability in the surface lavcr arising from the close proximity of another surface. The patterns are<br>
preserved in the surface layer by simply drying the hvdrogel surface layer while the stamp is still in contact<br>
with ii. The atomic force microscopy imaging is performed on the surface parents after preserving the<br>
patterns bv drying them. Figure 13d is an optical microscope micrograph of the patterns on the surface<br>
layer when the thickness of the surface laver is increased to about 30 um. The wavelength of the stripe<br>
patterns now corresponds to 109.54 ± 11.43 um (~ 3.35H) as expected. The alignment of the instability<br>
patterns bv the presence of the patterned stamp is clearly noticed. The patterns in the flal region of the<br>
stamp (lower part of the micrograph) show randomly oriented labyrinth patterns.<br>
Figure 14 is a simplified block diagram of the apparatus to perform the elastic contact imprint lithography<br>
(ECIL) in accordance with the invention. It consists of two movable blocks, B and C in general, but at least<br>
one movcablc block, which has 3-dimcnsional motion and also can be rotated. These blocks hold the<br>
substrate and the stamp during the process. They are coupled to a controller A, which aligns the blocks<br>
based on alignment mechanism, F and provides for the control of the vertical, lateral and angular<br>
displacement of the blocks. B and C with respect to each other. The assembly is enclosed in the patterning<br>
chamber. G. with suitable loading and unloading meclianism for the substrate and stamp. The chamber is<br>
scaled during the process and the atmosphere inside can be modified to suit the requirements of modulating<br>
4.<br>
the shear modulus of the surface layer, for example, it can be filled with ozone or exposed to UV radiation<br>
to make the surface layer less defonnable The chamber lias a movable access panel which allows the<br>
access to the substrate, stamp and other components inside the chamber. The loading and unloading of the<br>
substrate and stamp is also done through this access panel.<br>
The substrate containing the surface layer to be patterned and the stamp used to generate toe surface<br>
patterns are mounted on the movable blocks (B and C) whose motion is precalibnted. The blocks are<br>
mounted on a 3 dimensional positioner thai is controlled by the controller. The motion is generated by a<br>
pic«&gt; electric element or a stepper motor or an induction motor with micrometer or nanometer screws. The<br>
movement would require three linear motors, one for each axis of displacement. The rale and the extent of<br>
the displacement of the blocks during the motion is carefully and accurately controlled. The separation<br>
distance between the blocks can be determined by laser interferometry or induction sensors both of which<br>
would provide nanometer accuracy.<br>
The blocks also consist of heating and cooling mechanism and thermal sensor to heat the surface layer to<br>
reduce the shear modulus below 100 MPa. The heating and cooling mechanism is also controlled by the<br>
controller. This heating and cooling mechanism together with the control of atmosphere in the chamber can<br>
alter the shear modulus of the surface layer.<br>
The alignment mechanism (F) ensures the right relative positions of the surface layer and the stamp. The<br>
controller positions the movable blocks (B and C) after determining the position from the alignment<br>
mechanism. This mechanism may be in the form of a mark and a detector on either of the blocks, a laser<br>
source and a detector on either of the blocks. The alignment mechanism may also consist of etched patterns<br>
on the blocks.<br>
A suitable loading and unloading mechanism can consist of a conveyor mechanism that moves the substrate<br>
with the surface layer onto the movable block C. It can also be in the form a mechanical arm (robotic) that<br>
replaces the substrate after the surface layer is patterned with another substrate which is to be patterned<br>
This mechanism is also controlled by the controller (A).<br>
The controller is an electronic device with suitable detection and analysis capabilities and a computer<br>
controlled user interface The interface would depict the operating parameters like the temperature.<br>
displacement of the blocks B and C and other information related to the processing in the enclosed<br>
4<br>
patterning chamber<br>
The subsystem lo alter ihe shear modulus of the surface layer and the hardness of the surface patterns on<br>
the surface layer can consist of a radiation source (example UV light), the chamber environment is filled<br>
with ozone or the change in temperature of the surface layer by beating or cooling it through the substrate<br>
holder or the patterning chamber itself.<br>
The method of the invention can also be operated to generate patterns on elastic surface layers which are in<br>
the form of a continuous film or a ribbon or a long strip. The process thus can be operated in the continuous<br>
mode or in the batch process mode. Figure 15 represents a simple block diagram of an apparatus to perform<br>
ECIL on a continuous surface layer film in the mode of continuous operation. The apparatus consists of a<br>
patterned cylindrical stamp (A) which can rotate on its axis and also has vertical and lateral movement<br>
relative to the surface layer (F) which is placed on a movable holder (D). The film of surface layer is<br>
wound around the unwind spool (B) which unwinds the film during the operation. The patterned surface<br>
layer film is then wound onto another spool, the winding spool (C). The patterning is performed within the<br>
closed patterning chamber in which the patterns are rendered substantially non-deformable by treating the<br>
patterned surface layer to radiation (example UV for a PDMS surface layer), thermal or chemical<br>
reatments. The relative vertical displacement between the cylindrical stamp and the surface layer on the<br>
holder (D) is made possible by piezo-clectric element or a stepper motor or an induction motor and is<br>
controlled by a controller (H) with suitable computer based user interface. The rale of unwinding and<br>
winding of the film of surface layer is also controlled by the controller. Two small rollers (G) are used<br>
optionally to provide for the proper alignment of the surface layer strip with the holder.<br>
Another embodiment of the apparatus shown in the block diagram in figure 16, involves the rolling of a<br>
patterned cylindrical stamp on the surface layer in the patterning chamber. It consists of a movable<br>
patterned cylindrical stamp (C) that rotates on its axis and/or rolls on the surface layer. The substrate (B) on<br>
which there exists the surface layer to be patterned is mounted on a substrate holder (A) that can be<br>
movable or stationary. The separation distance between the surface layer and the cylindrical stamp is<br>
controlled by positioning the cylindrical stamp with suitable mechanism like piezo-electric element or a<br>
stepper motor and other such mechanisms. They are enclosed in a patterning chamber which consists of a<br>
sub-assembly to modify the shear modulus of the surface layer or to harden the surface patterns generated<br>
on the surface layer.<br>
Thus, the invention makes it possible to generate erasable and in situ transformable patterns. The patterns<br>
can be s\vitchcd-on. turned-off (erased), and morphologically modulated by controlling the separation<br>
distance between the surface layer and the stamp and by lateral displacement of the stamp.<br>
The present invention (ECO.) offers many advantages over the prior art First, the modulation and<br>
manipulation of the patterns, erasable, reformable and reversible nature of the patterns, and the possibility<br>
of in situ transformation of the patterns is possible. The generation of many complex different patterns from<br>
a single and simple stamp by a one step process is demonstrated. The usage of energetic beams like<br>
photonic, electron. X-ray etc has been done away with, the limits of resolution in conventional<br>
lithographies is also eliminated. Some salient aspects of the patterning by this technique are: (a) it dges not<br>
involve viscous flow of surface layer, (b) in addition to the stamp morphology, the lateral and vertical<br>
«<br>
motion of the stamp relative to the surface layer.determines the patterns on the surface layer, leading to<br>
more flexible patterning strategies, (c) patterns thus formed are largely due to elastic (rather than permanent<br>
plastic) deformations, (d) the polymer patterns can be manipulated in-situ by relative movement of stamp<br>
and surface layer, making it possible to arrive at "erasable patterns", "patterns-on-demand" and "dial-apattern"<br>
applications, (e) because of the dependence of the surface layer morphology on relative<br>
displacement of stamp, it is possible to create a variety of morphologically distinct ordered patterns using<br>
the SAME stamp. (0 repeated cycle of first patterning, followed by partial hardening, stamp detachment<br>
and re-patterning can generate complex patterns from the same stamp, and (g) In the applications requiring<br>
a permanent pattern after removal of the stamp, the pattern in a cross-linked PDMS surface layer can be<br>
made preserved by making it substantially less deformable by exposure to UV/further<br>
crosskicking/temperature assisted curing. Basically, any polymer sensitive to curing by radiation or<br>
temperature or chemical reaction or combination may be finally cured before removal of the stamp to<br>
produce the desired permanent structure.<br>
