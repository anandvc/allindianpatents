				<td>Method for producing synthetic fibres from a fibre-forming polymer-based melt blend<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing synthetic threads from a mixture based on fiber-forming polymers. The threads can be used as a continuous filament yarn or else be processed into staple fibers.<br>
The spinning of polymer blends into synthetic threads is well known. Its purpose is to obtain a higher breaking extension in the spun fiber at a certain spinning speed than without modification through additive polymer. This is supposed to enable a higher draw ratio to be used to produce the final yarn and thereby increase the productivity of the spinning unit.<br>
The increased productivity is supposed to bring an improvement in the economic efficiency of the manufacturing operation. This economic efficiency is compromised to a certain extent by production difficulties and costlier high speed equipment, The additional costs of the additive polymer have a substantial influence, so that there is even a point where the economic efficiency reaches zero, depending on the amount added. Moreover, the availability of the additive polymers on the market is an important factor. For these reasons, a multiplicity of the additives described in the literature do not even come into consideration for operation on a large industrial scale.<br>
The producer or process originator has to consider the production chain as a whole and cannot be content with his increasing the productivity of just a single step in the chain, for example spinning. Subsequent operations must not be impaired.<br><br>
More particularly, it is a main purpose of this invention not to reduce but preferably to improve the further processing conditions in subsequent steps, despite an increased spinning speed.<br>
For instance, the prior art for the production of Posy reports very high breaking extensions for polymer blends even at a high spinning speed, which characterize a substantial reduction in the degree of orientation. Such as-spun filaments are known to be instable in storage and cannot be fed to and processed at high speeds in draw-texturing processes- Breaking extensions 
Initial attempts to solve these problems are disclosed in EP 0 047 464 B (Teijin), DE 197 07 447 (Zimmer), DE 199 37 727 (Zimmer), DE 199 37 728 (Zimmer) and WO 99/07 927 (Degussa) . EP 0 047 464 B concerns an undrawn polyester yarn prepared in a process in which 0,2 -10% by weight of a polymer of the type - (-CH2-CRiR2-)n-/ such as poly (4-methyl-1-pentene) or polymethyl methacrylate, is added to obtain improved productivity through an increase in the breaking extension of the as-spun fiber at speeds between 2 500-8 000 m/min and correspondingly higher draw ratios. The additive polymer has to be finely and uniformly dispersed by mixing, the particle diameter having to be   to avoid fibrillation. The special effect is said to be due to the culmination of three matters - the chemical structure of the additive, which substantially prevents elongation of the&gt;additive molecules; the low mobility; and the compatibility of polyester and additive. The measures serve to increase productivity. No requirements are disclosed for draw texturing. Replicating this technical teaching as part of WO 99/07927 revealed high additive requirements and an<br><br>
attendant   impairment   to   quality   and   further processability.<br>
DE 197 07 447 (Zimmer) concerns the production of polyester or polyamide filaments having a breaking extension 
DE 199 37 727 (Zimmer) discloses the production of polyester staple fibers from a polymer blend which contains 0.1 to 2.0% by weight of an incompatible amorphous polymeric additive which has a glass transition temperature in the range from 90 to 170°C. The ratio of the melt viscosity of the polymeric additive to the melt viscosity of the polyester component shall be in the range from 1:1 to 10:1.<br>
DE 199 37 728 (Zimmer) relates to a process for producing HMLS filaments from polyester, a polymeric additive and optionally addition agents at a spinning take-off speed of 2 500 to 4 000 m/min. The polymeric additive shall have a glass transition temperature in the range from 90 to 170°C and the ratio of the melt viscosity of the polymeric additive to the melt viscosity of the polyester component shall be in the range from 1:1 to 7:1.<br>
WO 99/07 927 concerns the production of POYs by spinning polyester-based polymer blends at a take-off speed V of at least 2 500 m/min, the polyester being admixed with a second amorphous thermoplastically processable copolymer having a glass transition temperature of more than 100°C. The ratio of the melt viscosity of the copolymer to the melt viscosity of the polyester  is  in the range  from 1:1  to  10:1.  The<br><br>
polyester has added to it at least 0.05% by weight of copolymer and the maximum amount M of copolymer added to the polyester depends on the take-off speed v, as<br>
follows<br><br>
Although the last-cited processes (Zimmer AG) provide good and commercially acceptable breakage rates during the spinning of such polymer blends, the industry nonetheless continues to demand processes for spinning polymer blends with an even smaller number of broken ends in order that the efficiency of the spinning process may be further increased- Another requirement is improved further processability on the part of the synthetic threads, especially in the draw-texturing process.<br>
In the processes mentioned, the extensibility enhancers used are customarily granulated prior to being added to the polyester in order that the free-flowability of the additive polymer may be increased- However, even the granulated additive polymer has a large particle size and hence relatively poor and nonuniform metering properties. The poor and nonuniform metering leads to a deterioration in the yarn parameters and especially in yarn uniformity, for example dye ability. Since, moreover, it is time and cost intensive to granulate the extensibility enhancer, users are demanding processes for melt-spinning polymer blends that permit the use of nongranulated extensibility enhancers. Yet, the extensibility enhancers shall be uniformly and continuously meterable.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for producing synthetic threads from a blend based on fiber-forming matrix polymers whereby synthetic threads are produced at a lower breakage rate and in a simple manner- More particularly, the process .<br><br>
shall make it possible to produce polyester-based POYs having breaking extension values in the range of 90%-165%, a high uniformity with regard to the filament parameters and a low degree of crystallization.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a process for producing synthetic threads from a blend based on fiber-forming matrix polymers that permits the use of nongranulated extensibility enhancers and hence is substantially more economical than existing processes.<br>
It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a process for spinning synthetic threads which can be carried out on a large industrial scale and economically. More particularly, the process of the present invention shall make it possible to produce POYs at very high take-off speeds, preferably &gt; 2 500 m/min.<br>
According to the invention, the synthetic threads shall be simple to further process. More particularly, the POYs obtainable according to the present invention shall be further processable in a drawing or draw-texturing operation, preferably at high processing speeds, with a low number of broken ends.<br>
These and other objects not explicitly mentioned but readily derivable or apparent from related matters discussed herein by way of introduction are achieved by a process for producing synthetic threads which has all the features of claim 1. Advantageous modifications of the process according to the present invention are protected in sub claims append ant to claim 1. The synthetic thread obtainable by the process is described in an independent product claim. The further processing of the synthetic thread in a draw or draw-texturing operation is protected in claim 12, whereas claim 13 concerns the use of the synthetic thread for producing<br><br>
staple fibers.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides a process for producing synthetic threads from a melt blend based on fiber-forming matrix polymers by admixing the fiber-forming matrix polymer with at least a second amorphous additive polymer which is incompatible with the fiber-forming matrix polymer in an amount of 0.05 to 5% by weight, based on the total weight of the fiber-forming matrix polymer and the additive polymer which is incompatible therewith, wherein the additive polymer is obtainable by multiple initiation. This unforeseeable process makes it possible to produce synthetic threads in a simple manner at a lower breakage rate. More particularly, granulating the extensibility enhancer is no longer necessary for the process of the present invention.<br>
At the same time, the process of the present invention has a number of further advantages. These include:<br>
•	The process of the present invention can be carried out in a simple manner, on a large industrial scale and economically. More particularly, the process makes it possible to spin and wind at high take-off speeds.<br>
•	Owing to the high uniformity of the synthetic thread obtainable by the process, it is simple to achieve good package build to ensure uniform and substantially defect-free dyeing and further processing of the synthetic thread.<br>
•	The process of the present invention is particularly useful for producing polyester-based POYs having breaking extension values in the range of 90%-165%, a high uniformity with regard to the filament parameters and a low degree of crystallization.<br><br>
• The synthetic threads obtainable by the process can be further processed in a simple manner, on a large industrial scale and economically. For example, the POYs of the present invention can be drawn or draw textured at high speeds and a low number of broken ends,<br>
The process of the present invention relates to the production of synthetic threads from a melt blend based on fiber-forming matrix polymers.<br>
The spinning can be effected not only by a direct spinning process, in which the extensibility enhancer is metered in the form of a melt into the melt of the matrix polymer, but also by an extruder spinning process, in which the extensibility enhancer is metered as a solid into the matrix polymer and subsequently melted therein. Further details concerning the processes mentioned can be taken from the prior art, for example EP 0 047 464 B, WO 99/07 927, DE 100 49 617 and DE 100 22 889, the disclosure of each of which is hereby explicitly incorporated herein.<br>
In the context of the present  invention,	the term<br>
„synthetic  threads"  comprehends  all  the	kinds  of<br>
threads   which   are   obtainable   by	spinning<br>
thermoplastically  processable  blends  of	synthetic<br>
polymers-   These  include   staple   fibers,	textile<br>
filaments, such as flat yarns, POYs,	FOYs and<br>
industrial filaments.<br>
Further details concerning synthetic threads and also concerning the groups mentioned, especially with regard to  their  material  properties  and  the  customary production conditions, can be taken from the prior art, for   example   from  Fournier   „Synthetische   Fasern: Hostelling,  Machine  und  Apparatus,  Eigenschaften; Handbook fir Anlagenplanung, Maschinenkonstruktion und Berries", Munich, Vienna; Hanker Vela 1995, and also<br><br>
DE 199 37 727   (staple  fibers),   DE 199 37 728   and DE 199 37 729   (industrial  yarns)   and  WO 99/07 927 (POYs). The disclosure content of these references is therefore explicitly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the process of the present invention is used for producing staple fibers, flat yarns, POYs, FOYs or industrial filaments. The process of the present invention has been determined to be very useful for producing POYs.<br>
Useful fiber-forming matrix polymers for the invention include thermoplastically processable polymers, preferably polyamides, such as nylon-6 and nylon-6.6, and polyesters. Mixtures or blends of different polymers are also conceivable. Preference for use in the present invention is given to polyesters, especially polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate, polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTMT) and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) . In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the matrix polymer is polyethylene terephthalate, polytrimethylene terephthalate or polybutylene terephthalate, especially polyethylene terephthalate.<br>
Homopolymers are preferred according to the invention-<br>
However, it is also possible to use copolymers,<br>
preferably polyester copolymers containing up to about<br>
15 mol% of customary comonomers, for example diethylene<br>
glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol,<br>
polyethylene glycol, isophthalic acid and/or adipic<br>
acid.	.<br>
The polymers of the present invention may include, as further constituents, additives which are customary for thermoplastic molding compositions and contribute to improved polymer properties. Examples of such additives<br><br>
include antistats, antioxidants, flame retardants, lubricants, dyes, light stabilizers, polymerization catalysts, polymerization assistants, adhesion promoters, delusterants and/or organic phosphites. These addition agents are used in a customary amount, preferably amounts of up to 10% by weight, preferably 
A polyester used in the process of the present invention may also contain a small fraction (preferably not more than 0.5% by weight) of branched components, is for example Polyfunctional acids, such as trimellitic acid, pyromellitic acid, or tri- to hexavalent alcohols, such as trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, glycerol or corresponding hydroxy acids.<br>
In the invention, the matrix polymer is mixed with an additive polymer in an amount of at least 0.05% by weight, and the additive polymer shall be amorphous and substantially insoluble in the matrix polymer. In essence, the two polymers are not compatible with each other and form two phases which can be distinguished under the microscope. The additive polymer shall furthermore have a glass transition temperature (determined by DSC using a 10°C/min heating rate) of more than 100°C and be thermoplastically processable. The melt viscosity of the additive polymer shall be chosen in such a way that the ratio of its melt viscosity (measured at an oscillation rate of 2.4 Hz and at a temperature which is equal to the melting temperature of the matrix polymer plus 34.0°C (290°C for polyethylene terephthalate) ) on extrapolation to the time zero to the melt viscosity of the matrix polymer (when measured under identical conditions) is in the range from 1:1 to 10:1. In other words, the melt viscosity of the additive polymer is at least the same as  or preferably  higher  than  that  of  the  matrix<br><br>
polymer.<br>
The ratio of the melt viscosity of the copolymer to that of the matrix polymer under the abovementioned conditions is preferably between 1.4:1 and 8:1. Particular preference is given to a ratio between 1.7:1 and 6.5:1 for the melt viscosities. Under these conditions, the average particle size of the additive polymer is 140 to 350 nm.<br>
The amount of additive polymer to be added to the matrix polymer is between 0.05% by weight and 5% by weight, based on the total weight of the polymer blend. There are many applications, for example the production of POYs, where it is sufficient to add less than 1.5% and in the case of take-off speeds above 3 500 and up to 6 000 m/min or more even often less than 1.0%, amounting to an appreciable cost advantage.<br>
The mixing of the additive polymer with the matrix polymer  is  effected  in  a  conventional  manner  as described for example in WO 99/07 927 or DE 100 22 889, the disclosure content of each of which is hereby explicitly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The polymer blend is spun at temperatures, which depend on the matrix polymer, in the range from 220 to 320°C-<br>
Useful additive polymers for addition to the fiber-forming polymer in accordance with the invention may differ in chemical composition, provided they possess the aforementioned properties. Particularly useful additive polymers for the invention include the hereinbelow specified polymers and copolymers:<br>
1.   A polymer obtainable by polymerization of monomers of the general formula (I):<br><br><br>
0)<br>
where R” and R” are substituents consisting of the optional atoms C, H, O, S, P and halogen atoms and the sum total of the molecular weights of R” and R” is at least 40. Exemplary monomer units include acrylic acid, met acrylic acid and CH2=CR-C00R', where R is an H atom or a CH3 group and R' is a C1_15-alkyl radical or a   radical or a C6.i4-aryl radical, and also styrene and  -alkyl-substituted styrenes.<br>
2.	A  copolymer  containing  the  following  monomer<br>
units :<br>
A = acrylic acid, methacrylic acid or CH2=CR-COOR' , where R is an H atom or a CH3 group and R' is a  -alkyl radical or a C5-12~cycloalkyl radical or a  aryl radical,<br>
B =  styrene or Ci.3-alkyl-substituted styrenes,<br>
the copolymer consisting of 60 to 98% by weight of A and 2 to 40% by weight of B, preferably of 83 to 90% by weight of A and 2 to 17% by weight of B and more preferably of 90 to 98% by weight of A and 2 to 10% by weight of B (sum total = 100% by weight).<br>
3.	A  copolymer  containing  the  following  monomer<br>
units:<br>
C =  styrene or  -alkyl-substituted styrenes,<br><br>
D =  one or more monomers of the formula II, III or IV<br><br>
where R”, R” and R” are each an H atom or a Ci.i5-alkyl radical or a C6.i4-aryl radical or a Cs-iz-cycloalkyl radical,<br>
the copolymer consisting of 15 to 95% by weight of C and 2 to 80% by weight of D, preferably of 50 to 90% by weight of C and 10 to 50% by weight of D and more preferably of 70 to 85% by weight of C and 15 to 30% by weight of D, the sum total of C and D being 100% by weight.<br>
4.   A  copolymer  containing  the  following  monomer units:<br>
E = acrylic acid, methacrylic acid or CH2=CR-C00R' where R is an H atom or a CH3 group and R' is a Ci_i5-alkyl radical or a   radical or a Cg”““-aryl radical,<br>
F =  styrene or Ci.3-alkyl-substituted styrenes,<br>
-G =  one or more monomers of the formula II, III or IV<br><br><br>
where R”, R” and R” are each an H atom or a Ci-15-alkyl radical or a   radical or a C6_i4-aryl radical,<br>
H = one       or   more   ethylenically   unsaturated monomers which are copolymerizable with E and/or with F and/or G and are selected from the  group  consisting  of  a-methylstyrene, vinyl acetate,  acrylic esters,  methacrylic esters   other   than   E,   acrylonitrile, acrylamides,  methacrylamide,  vinyl  chloride, vinylidene   chloride,   halogen-substituted styrenes,  vinyl  ethers,  isopropenyl ethers and dieses,<br>
the copolymer consisting of 30 to 99% by weight of E, 0 to 50% by weight of F, 0 to 50% by weight of G and 0 to 50% by weight of H, preferably of 45 to 97% by weight of E, 0 to 30% by weight of F, 3 to 40% by weight of G and 0 to 30% by weight of H and more preferably of 60 to 94% by weight of E, 0 to 20% by weight of F, 6 to 30% by weight of G and 0 to 2 0% by weight of H, the sum total of E, F, G and H being 100% by weight.<br>
Component H is an optional component. Although the advantages to be achieved according to the present invention are already obtainable by means of copolymers which contain components from groups E to G, the advantages to be achieved according to the present invention are also obtained when further monomers from<br><br>
group H are involved in the construction of the copolymer to be employed according to the present invention.<br>
Component H is preferably chosen such that it has no adverse effect on the properties of the copolymer to be used according to the present invention.<br>
Component H can be employed, inter alia, to modify the properties of the copolymer in a desired manner, for example through increases or improvements in the flow properties on heating to the melting temperature, or to reduce any residual color in the copolymer or by using a polyfunctional monomer in order thereby to introduce a certain degree of crosslinking into the copolymer.<br>
As well as for these reasons, H can also be chosen such that any copolymerization of components E to G is augmented or made possible in the first place, as in the case of MA and MMA, which do not copolymerize on their own, yet will copolymerize readily on addition of a third component such as styrene.<br>
Useful monomers for this purpose include vinyl esters, esters of acrylic acid, for example methyl acrylate and ethyl acrylate, esters of methacrylic acid other than methyl methacrylate, for example butyl methacrylate and ethylhexyl  methacrylate,  acrylonitrile,  acrylamides, methacrylamide,  vinyl  chloride,  vinylidene chloride, styrene,  a-methylstyrene  and  the  various  halogen-substituted styrenes, vinyl ethers, isopropenyl ethers, dynes, for example 1,3-butadiene, and divinylbenzene. The reduction in copolymer color may be particularly preferably achievable through use of an elctron-rich monomer, for example through the use of a vinyl ether, vinyl acetate, styrene or a-methylstyrene.<br>
Particular preference among the compounds of component H is given to aromatic vinyl monomers,  for example<br><br>
styrene or a-methylstyrene.<br>
The additive polymers to be used according to the present invention are prepared in a conventional manner. They can be prepared by bulk, solute ion, suspension or emulsion polymerization. Helpful information with regard to bulk polymerization is to be found in Houben-Weyl, Volume E20, Part 2 (1987) , page 114 5ff. Information with regard to solution polymerization is found ibid, at page 1156ff. The suspension polymerization technique is described ibid, at page 1149ff, while emulsion polymerization is described and illustrated ibid, at page llO.<br>
Particular preference for the purposes of the present invention is given to bead polymers whose particle size lies in a particularly favorable range. The additive polymers to be used according to the present invention, for example by being mixed into the melt of the fiber polymers, are particularly preferably in the form of particles having an average diameter of 0.1 to 1.0 mm. However, larger or smaller beads can also be employed.<br>
Al 1 the copolymers according to the present invent ion are obtainable commercially or by a process familiar to one skilled in the art.<br>
Polymer blends of polyethylene terephthalate for textile applications, such as POYs, having a limiting viscosity number of about 0.55 to 0.75 dl/g and additive polymers of type 1, 2, 3 or 4 are preferably formed from additive polymers having viscosity numbers in the range from 70 to 13 0 cmVg-<br>
The process of the present invention comprises admixing an additive polymer which is obtainable by multiple initiation. The term „multiple initiation' as used herein comprehends not only single or multiple supplementary    initiation    of    a    free-radical<br><br>
polymerization, ie the single or multiple renewed addition of initiator at later reaction times, but also free-radical polymerization in the presence of a mixture comprising at least two initiators having graduated half-lives, the latter option being particularly preferred in the context of the present invent ion. „Graduated half-1ives" as used herein denotes that the at least two initiators each considered separately have different half-lives at a certain temperature or have the same half-life in different temperature ranges. Preference is given to using initiators which each have a half-life of one hour in temperature ranges which are at least 10°C apart, The initiator selected from the individual temperature ranges can be a single compound for each range, but it is also possible to employ in each instance two or more initiators having appropriate half-lives from appropriate temperature ranges.<br>
Such polymerizations are described for example in the documents  US 4 588 798,   US 4 605  717,   EP 489 318, DE 199 17 987 and the references cited therein.  The disclosure content of the cited documents is hereby explicitly included herein by reference.<br>
It has been determined to be particularly advantageous for the purposes of the present invention to use an initiator mixture which includes an initiator Ij having a half-life T” of one hour in the range from 70 to 85”C and a further initiator I2 having a half-life Tj of one hour in the range from 85 to 100°C. Further initiators I” which can be used where appropriate, preferably have decomposition temperatures T” between T” and T2.<br>
The amount of the initiator mixture to be used can be varied within relatively wide limits; the amount of the initiators used can be used to control the polymerization time and also the polymerization temperature. The amounts used according to the present<br><br>
invention are specified in parts by weight of initiator per 100 parts by weight of monomer. It is advantageous to employ a total amount of about 0.05 to 1.0 part by weight of initiator mixture per 100 parts by weight of monomer, advantageously 0.05 to 0.5 part by weight of initiator mixture and especially 0.15 to 0.4 part by weight of initiator mixture per 100 parts by weight of monomer.<br>
The weight ratio between the individual initiators in the initiator mixture can likewise be varied within relatively wide limits. The weight ratio between the individual initiators is preferably in the range from 1:1 to 1:10 and more preferably in the range from 1:1 to 1:4. Suitable amounts and mixing ratios can be determined in simple preliminary tests.<br>
Useful initiators for the present invention include the<br>
customary initiators used for free-radical formation in<br>
free-radically initiated polymerizations, This includes<br>
compounds such as organic peroxides, such as dicumyl<br>
peroxide, di acyl peroxides, such as dilauroyl peroxide,<br>
peroxydicarbonates such as diisopropyl<br>
peroxydicarbonate, peresters such as tert-butyl peroxy-<br>
2-ethylhexanoate and the like. Other types of compounds<br>
capable of forming free radicals are suitable for the<br>
purposes of the present invention. This includes in<br>
particular azo compounds such as 2,2'-azobisiso-<br>
butyronitrile	and	2,2'-azobis- (2,4-<br>
dimethylvaleronitrile).<br>
Particularly   useful   initiator   mixtures   comprise<br>
components selected from the following initiators:<br>
tert-amyl peroxypivalate half-life T (1 hour) = 71°C,<br>
2,2' -azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile)  T  (1  hour)<br>
71°C,<br>
di-(2,4-dichlorobenzoyl) peroxide T (1 hour) = 72°C,<br>
tert-butyl peroxypivalate T (1 hour) = 74°C,<br>

Peroxide initiators are most preferred for the purposes of the present invention.<br>
The polymerization can be substantially or largely carried out under isothermal conditions. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the polymerization is carried out in at least two steps. A first step comprises polymerizing at a comparatively low temperature, preferably at a temperature between 60 and less than 85°C. A second step continues the polymerization at a higher temperature, preferably at a temperature between 85 and 120°C.<br>
The residual monomer content of the additive polymer is preferably less than 0.62% by weight, advantageously less than 0,47% by weight and preferably less than 0.42% by weight, each percentage being based on the<br><br>
total weight of the additive polymer. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the residual monomer content of the additive polymer is less than 0.37% by weight, preferably less than 0.30% by weight, advantageously less than 0.25% by weight and especially less than 0.20% by weight, each percentage being based on the total weight of the additive polymer.<br>
Here, residual monomer content of the additive polymer refers according to the present invention to the amount of monomer which remains in the additive polymer after polymerization and polymer isolation. The residual monomer content in the case of polymers produced by free-radical polymerization is customarily in the range from 0.65% by weight to 1.0% by weight, based on the total weight of the polymer. Processes for reducing the residual monomer content of the polymer are known from the prior art. For instance, the residual monomer content of polymer can be reduced by devolatilizing the polymer melt, preferably in an extruder and directly before spinning. In addition, it is also possible to obtain polymers having a reduced residual monomer content through judicious choice of the polymerization parameters.<br>
It is further exceedingly advantageous in the context of the present invention to mix a flow aid into the additive polymer. In this context, flow aid refers to any assistant mixed into pulverulent or granulated, especially hygroscopic, substances in small amounts to prevent the substances clumping or caking together and so ensure permanent free flow. Useful flow aids, which are also known as abhesives, antleaking agents or fluidifiers, include water-insoluble, hydrophobicizing or moisture-absorbing powders of diatomaceous earth, pyrogenic silicas, tricalcium phosphate, calcium silicates, AI2O3, MgO, MgCOj, ZnO, stearates, fatty amines  (see CD Rompp Chemie Lexicons .- Version 1.0,<br><br>
Stuttgart/New York: George Thyme Vela 1995). In the context of the present invention, such flow aids have been found to have only limited usefulness, since they are disadvantageous for the spinning process. First, they can become lodged in the spinning apparatus and so cause blockages in pipework and nozzles or dies and hence lead to system upsets. Secondly, these „extraneous materials" are liable to compromise the material properties of the resulting synthetic threads and increase the thread breakage rate during spinning.<br>
According to the invention, polymers and/or copolymers are therefore particularly preferred for use as flow aids. The hereinbelow specified polymers and/or copolymers have been found to be particularly useful:<br>
1.	A polymer obtainable by polymerization of monomers<br>
of the general formula (I) :<br><br>
where R” and R” are substituents consisting of the optional atoms C, H, O, S, P and halogen atoms and the sum total of the molecular weights of R” and R” is at least 40. Exemplary monomer units include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and CH2=CR-C00R', where R is an H atom or a CH3 group and R' is a Ci-15-alkyl radical or a Cg.ij-cycloalkyl radical or a C6.i4-aryl radical, and also styrene and Ci_3-alkyl-substituted styrenes.<br>
2.	A  copolymer  containing  the  following  monomer<br>
units:<br>
A =  acrylic   acid,    methacrylic    acid   or CH2-CR-COOR' , where R is an H atom or a CH3<br><br>
group and R' is a Ci.;i”5-alkyl radical or a C5_i2-cycloalkyl        radical        or       a       C6_i4-aryl<br>
radical,<br>
B =  styrene or  -alkyl-substituted styrenes,<br>
the copolymer consisting of 60 to 98% by weight of A and 2 to 40% by weight of B, preferably of 83 to 90% by weight of A and 2 to 17% by weight of B and more preferably of 90 to 98% by weight of A and 2 to 10% by weight of B (sum total = 100% by weight).<br>
3.   A  copolymer  containing  the  following  monomer units:<br>
C =  styrene or  -alkyl-substituted styrenes,<br>
D =  one or more monomers of the formula II, III or IV<br><br>
where R\ R** and R” are each an H atom or a Ci.i5-alkyl radical or a C6.i4-aryl radical or a C5-i2~cycloalkyl radical,<br>
the copolymer consisting of 15	to 95% by weight of<br>
C and 2 to 80% by weight of D,	preferably of 50 to<br>
90% by weight of C and 10 to	50% by weight of D<br>
and more preferably of 70 to	85% by weight of C<br>
and 15 to 30% by weight of D,	the sum total of C<br>
and D being 100% by weight.<br><br>
4.   A  copolymer  containing  the  following  monomer units:<br>
E = acrylic acid, methacrylic acid or CH2=CR-C00R' where R is an H atom or a CH3 group and R' is a Ci.i5-alkyl radical or a   radical or a Cg.”“-aryl radical,<br>
F =  styrene or  -alkyl-substituted styrenes,<br>
G = one or more monomers of the formula II, III or IV<br><br>
where R”, R” and R” are each an H atom or a Ci-15-alkyl radical or a Cg.ij-cycloalkyl radical or a C6.i4-aryl radical,<br>
H =  one   or  more   ethylenically   unsaturated monomers which are copolymerizable with E and/or with F and/or G and are selected from the  group  consisting  of  a-methylstyrene, vinyl acetate,  acrylic esters,  methacrylic esters   other   than   E,   acrylonitrile, acrylamide,  methacrylamide,     vinyl  chloride, vinylidene   chloride,   halogen-substituted styrenes,  vinyl , ethers,  isopropenyl  ethers and dynes,<br>
the copolymer consisting of 30 to 99% by weight of E, 0 to 50% by weight of F, 0 to 50% by weight of G and 0 to 50% by weight of H, preferably of 45 to<br><br>
97% by weight of E, 0 to 3 0% by weight"“ of F, 3 to 4 0% by weight of G and 0 to 3 0% by weight of H and more preferably of 6 0 to 94% by weight of E, 0 to 2 0% by weight of F, 6 to 3 0% by weight of G and 0 to 20% by weight of H, the sum total of E, F, G and H being 100% by weight.<br>
Component H is an optional component. Although the advantages to be achieved according to the present invention are already obtainable by means of copolymers which contain components from groups E to G, the advantages to be achieved according to the present invention are also obtained when further monomers from group H are involved in the construction of the copolymer to be employed according to the present invention,<br>
Component H is preferably chosen such that it has no adverse effect on the properties of the copolymer to be used according to the present invention.<br>
Component H can be employed, inter alia, to modify the properties of the copolymer in a desired manner, for example through increases or improvements in the flow properties on heating to the melting temperature, or to reduce any residual color in the copolymer or by using a polyfunctional monomer in order thereby to introduce a certain degree of crosslinking into the copolymer.<br>
As well as for these reasons, H can also be chosen such that any copolymerization of components E to G is augmented or made possible in the first place, as in the case of MA and MMA, which do not copolymerize on their own, yet will copolymerize readily on addition of a third component such as styrene.<br>
Useful monomers for this purpose include vinyl esters, esters of acrylic acid, for example methyl acrylate and ethyl acrylate, esters of methacrylic acid other than<br><br>
methyl methacrylate, for example butyl methacrylate and ethylhexyl  methacrylate,  acrylonitrile,  acrylamide, methacrylamide,  vinyl chloride,  vinylidene chloride, styrene,  a-methylstyrene  and  the  various  halogen-substituted styrenes, vinyl ethers, isopropenyl ethers, dienes, for example 1,3-butadiene, and divinylbenzene, The reduction in copolymer color may be particularly preferably achievable through use of an electron-rich monomer, for example through the use of a vinyl ether, vinyl acetate, styrene or a-methylstyrene.<br>
Particular preference among the compounds of component H is given to aromatic vinyl monomers, for example styrene or a-methylstyrene.<br>
The flow aids mentioned are prepared in a conventional manner. They can be prepared by bulk, solution, suspension or emulsion polymerization. Helpful information with regard to bulk polymerization is to be found in Houben-Weyl, Volume E2 0, Part 2 (1987) , page 1145ff. Information with regard to solution polymerization is found ibid. at page 1156ff. The suspension polymerization technique is described ibid. at page 1149ff, while emulsion polymerization is described and illustrated ibid, at page aloof. If necessary, the polymers have to be additionally ground.<br>
Preference is given according to the invention in<br>
particular to flow aids whose particle size lies in a<br>
particularly favorable range. They are particularly<br>
preferably in the form of particles having an average<br>
diameter of 0.01 to less than 100 /im. However, it is<br>
also possible to use flow aids having larger or smaller<br>
particle sizes.	'<br>
The imidated copolymer types 3 and 4 can be prepared not only from the monomers using a monomeric imide but also by subsequent complete or preferably partial imidation of a copolymer containing the corresponding<br><br>
maleic acid derivative. These flow aids are obtained for example by complete or preferably partial reaction of the corresponding copolymer in the melt phase with ammonia or a primary alkyl- or arylamine, for example aniline (Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering Vol. 16 [1989] , Wiley, page 78) . The resulting copolymers have to be additionally ground, if necessary.<br>
All the copolymers according to the present invention and also, as far as they exist, their nonimidated starting copolymers are obtainable commercially or by a process familiar to one skilled in the art.<br>
Particularly useful flow aids in the context of the present invention have a substantially identical chemical composition to the additive polymer used. The flow aid and the additive polymer used contain the same repeat units to an extent which is advantageously not less than 50% by weight, preferably not less than 60% by weight, more preferably not less than 7 0% by weight and especially not less than 80% by weight, each percentage being based on the total weight of flow aid and of the additive polymer used, respectively. In this context, the term „repeat units" refers to the recurring units in the polymer which are derived from the monomers originally used.<br>
Particularly advantageous results can be obtained according to the present invention when the flow aid and the additive polymer used have the same repeat units to an extent which is not less than 90% by weight, preferably not less than 95% by weight and especially not less than 97% by weight, each percentage being based on the total weight of the flow aid and of the additive polymer used, respectively. In a very particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the polymer composition of the flow aid and the polymer composition of the additive polymer used<br><br>
are completely identical with regard to the repeat<br>
units.<br>
It is additionally advantageous in the context of the present invention to use a flow aid which has a similar weight average molecular weight to the additive polymer used. The weight average molecular weight of the flow aid is preferably less than 50%, advantageously less than 3 0% and especially less than 20% different from that of the additive polymer used.<br>
The preferred concentration range for the flow aid in the additive polymer is 0.05 to 5.0% by weight and preferably 0.05 to 1.0% by weight, each percentage being based on the total weight of additive polymer and flow aid, and depends on the surface area and hence on the average diameter of the additive polymers. In the case of a bead polymer having an average particle size of 0.7 mm, the flow aid concentration is preferably in the range from 0.05 to 0.3% by weight. As the bead diameter decreases, the flow aid concentration required for the flow-furthering effect increases. When the flow aid concentration is too low, the flow-furthering effect will be insufficient, whereas excessively high flow aid concentrations will yield no further improvement in flowability, but instead give rise to pronounced, technically undesirable dusting due to the excessive, finely divided flow aid powder.<br>
It is advantageous for the flow aid to be prepared by an emulsion polymerization process and isolated by spray drying- The spray drying operation can be carried out in a conventional manner. Illustrative descriptions of spray drying can be found in DE 332 067 or Pullmans Encyclopedia deer technischen Chemie, 5th edition (1988), B 2, page 4-23. Depending on the spraying assembly (one-material nozzle, two-material nozzle or atomizer disk), the particles obtained have an average particle diameter of 20 to  <br><br>
The mixing of additive powder and flow aid to obtain a very uniform (homogeneous) extensibility enhancer can be effected in a conventional manner. Further details are described for example in Pullmans Enzyklopadie deer technischen Chemie, 5th edition (1988) and also Romps Chemie Lexicon (CD) - Version 1.0, Stuttgart/New York: George Thyme Vela 1995.<br>
It has been found to be exceedingly advantageous in the context of the present invention for the additive polymer, which is preferably dried using a fluidized bed dryer, and the spray-dried flow aid to be mixed using a fluidized bed dryer. Details concerning the fluidized bed process can likewise be taken from the technical literature, for example Ullmanns Enzyklopadie der technischen Chemie, 5th edition (198 8) and also Rompps Chemie Lexikon (CD) - Version 1.0, Stuttgart/New York: Georg Thieme Verlag 1995.<br>
The extensibility enhancer to be used according to the present invention is not granulated, in contradistinction to the prior art. Granulating in this context refers to the production of pellets of the same shape and size. The powder to be granulated is customarily melted in a single- or twin-screw extruder and fed to a peel let  zing machine. Comminution can be effected not only by cold pelletization but also by hot pelletization. In cold pelletization, the granulating die produces strands, strips or thin self-supporting films which, after solidification, are comminuted by a rotating blade. In hot pelletization, the plasticated polymer is pressed through the die and the emerging strand is comminuted by a rotating blade, which is customarily secured to the die plate. The melt is cooled after pelletizing, usually either by air or by water-<br>
The synthetic threads are produced from the polymer blends of the present invention by melt spinning using<br><br>
conventional spinning means as described for example in the references DE 199 37 727 (staple fibers), DE 199 37 718 and DE 199 37 729 (industrial yarns) and WO 99/07 927 (POYs) . The disclosure content of these references is hereby explicitly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Since the process of the present invention has been determined to be particularly advantageous for producing POYs, a particularly preferred embodiment of the process according to the present invention, for producing POYs, will now be described. It will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art how to apply the teaching of the present invention to processes for producing other synthetic threads.<br>
POYs are preferably melt spun at spinning take-off speeds of at least 2 500 m/min. The filter pack used is equipped according to the known prior art with filter means and/or loose filter media (eg steel sand).<br>
The molten polymer blend, after shearing and filtration in the die pack, is forced through the capillaries in the die plate. There follows a cooling zone in which the melt threads are cooled by cooling air to below their softening temperature to avoid sticking or jamming on the downstream thread guide. The configuration of the cooling zone is not critical, provided a homogeneous air stream which passes through the filament bundle uniformly is ensured- For instance, directly below the die plate there can be an air quiescent zone to retard cooling. The cooling air can be supplied from an air conditioning system by transverse or radial quenching or be taken by means of a cooling pipe from the environment by self-aspiration.<br>
After cooling, the filaments are bundled and spin finished. This is accomplished using toiler pads to which a spin finish emulsion is supplied by metering pumps. The spin-finished thread advantageously passes<br><br>
through entangling means to improve bundle coherency. Similarly, handling and safety elements are advisable before the thread arrives at the winding assembly and is wound up there on cylindrical bobbin centers to form packages. The surface speed of the yarn package is automatically adjusted and is equal to the winding speed. The take-off speed of the thread can be 0.2 to 2-5% higher than the winding speed, owing to the traversing movement of the thread. Optionally, driven godets can be used downstream of the spin finishing step and upstream of the winding step. The surface speed of the first godet system is referred to as the take-off speed. Further godets can be used for drawing or relaxing.<br>
The incompatibility of the two polymers is responsible for the fact that the additive polymer will form elongate particles in the matrix polymer which are radially symmetrical predominantly in the yarn transportation direction, immediately upon exit of the polymer blend from the spinnerette. The length/diameter ratio is preferably &gt;2, where the diameter (d) was measured at right angles to the yarn transportation direction and the length was measured parallel to the yarn transportation direction. The best conditions were obtained when the average particle diameter (arithmetic average) dgg was 1 000 nm in a sample cross-section was below 1%.<br>
The effect on these particles of the spinline extension ratio was demonstrated analytically. Investigations of the as-spun threads by transmission electron miscroscopy (TEM) have shown that a fibril like structure is present there' The average diameter of the fibrils was estimated to be about 4 0 nm. The length/diameter ratio of the fibrils was &gt;50. When these fibrils are not formed or when the additive particles are too large in diameter upon exit from the spinnerette or the size distribution is.too nonuniform,<br><br>
which is the case when the viscosity ratio is insufficient, then the beneficial effect is lost.<br>
The roller action described in the literature could not be demonstrated with the additive polymer according to the present invention. The evaluation of microscopic examinations of fiber cross and longitudinal sections suggests that the spinline extension tension is transferred to the additive fibrils as they form and that the polymer matrix undergoes a low-tension extension- As a consequence, the matrix deforms under conditions which result in a reduction in the orientation and suppression of spinning-induced crystallization. It is sensible to judge the effect by the as-spun filament formation and by the processing characteristics.<br>
It ig further advantageous for the efficacy of the additives according to this invention for the copolymers to have a flow activation energy of at least 80 kJ/mol,  a higher flow activation energy than that of the polymer matrix. Under this precondition it is possible for the additive fibrils to solidify before the polyester matrix and to take up an appreciable fraction of the spinning tension which is applied. Thus, the desired capacity increase for the spinning plant can be achieved in a simple manner.<br>
The above-described preferred embodiment of the process according to the present invention is similarly useful for the high speed spinning of POY yarns having a POY filament linear density of &gt;3 dtex to 20 dtex or more, but also of POY filament linear densities  , especially microfilaments of 0.2 to 2.0 dtex.<br>
The process of the present invention, as a consequence of the added additive polymer, which is obtainable by multiple initiation, has a yarn breakage rate which is distinctly reduced compared with prior, art processes.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, POYs having a linear density &gt;3 dtex are produced with a yarn breakage rate of less than 0.75 breaks per metric ton of polymer blend, advantageously less than 0.5 breaks per metric ton of polymer blend and preferably less than 0.4 breaks per metric ton of polymer blend.<br>
The synthetic threads obtainable by the process according to the invention can be used direct in the present form or else further processed in a conventional manner. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, they are used for producing staple fibers. Further details concerning the production of staple fibers can be taken from the prior art, for example DE 199 37 727 and the references cited therein.<br>
In a further particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, POYs produced by the process of the present invention are drawn or draw textured. In this context, the following observations are important for the further processing of the spun thread in the draw-texturing process at high speeds: spun threads according to this invention which are to be used as feed yarn for draw texturing - and are customarily known as POY - are preferably produced at take-off speeds &gt;2 500 m/min, more preferably &gt;3 500 m/min and most preferably &gt;4 000 m/min. These yarns have to have a physical structure which is characterized by a specific degree of orientation and a low degree of crystallization. Useful parameters for characterizing the yarn are the breaking extension, the birefringence, the crystallinity and the boil-off shrinkage. The polyester-based polymer blend according to the present invention is characterized by a breaking extension of not less than 85% and not more than 180% for the POY. The boil-off shrinkage is 32-69% and the birefringence is between 0.030 and 0.075, the crystallinity is less<br><br>
than 20% and the breaking tenacity is at least 17 cN/tex, The POY breaking extension is preferably between 85 and 160%. Conditions are particularly favorable when the POY breaking extension is between 109 and 146%, the POY breaking tenacity is at least 22 cN/tex and the Ulster value is not more than 0.7%.<br>
Synthetic POYs obtainable in this manner are particularly suitable for further processing in a drawing or draw-texturing operation. The number of broken ends will continue to be lower in the further processing operation. The draw-texturing is effected at different speeds depending on filament linear density, speeds &gt;750 m/min and preferably &gt;900 m/min being used for normal linear density filaments &gt;2 dtex, per filament (final linear density). Microfilaments and fine linear densities (final linear density) 
The draw ratios to be employed for the POYs specified are between 1.35 and 2.2, POYs having a comparatively low degree of orientation preferably being subjected to draw ratios at the upper end of the range, and vice versa. In draw texturing, the draw ratio is influenced by tension surging as a function of the processing speed. It is therefore particularly preferable to employ draw ratios as per the formula:<br><br><br>
The invention will now be more particularly described with reference to an inventive example and to a comparative example, although the invention shall not be restricted to this inventive example. The property values reported as well as the values reported above were determined as follows:<br>
The residual methyl methacrylate and styrene monomer content was determined by gas-chromatographic headspace analysis, a method for determining vaporizable constituents in liquids and solids, including monomers in thermoplastics. The residual N-cyclohexylmaleimide monomer content was determined by gas chromatography on a solution of the polymer in dichloromethane.<br>
The average particle size of the spray-dried flow aid was determined via laser diffraction spectroscopy using a Moisturizer Microplus from Malvern (measuring range: 0.05-555  <br>
The average particle diameter of the spun fiber additive beads was determined via sieve analysis using an Alpine air jet sieving machine (model A 200 LS).<br>
The intrinsic viscosity was determined on a solution of 0,5 g of polyester in 100 ml of (3:2 w/w) phenol/I,2-dichlorobenzene at 25°C. The viscosity number VN (also known as the Standing function) is the concentration-based relative viscosity change of a 0.5% solution of the copolymer in chloroform, based on the solvent, the flow times being determined in a suspended level Ubbelohde viscometer, Schott model No. 532 03, and a   capillary according to DIN standard 51562 at 25°C. The solvent used was chloroform.<br><br><br>
t   =  flow time of polymer solution in seconds<br>

c   =  concentration in g/lOO cct<br>
To determine the melt viscosity (initial viscosity), the polymer was dried under reduced pressure to a water content 
To determine the melting * temperature of the polymer, the polymer sample was first melted at 310°C for 1 min and thereafter immediately quenched to room temperature. The melting temperature was subsequently determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement  at  a  heating  rate  of . 10°C/min.  The<br><br>
pretreatment and the measurement were carried out under a nitrogen blanket.<br>
The linear density was determined in known manner using a precision reel and weighing means. The pre-tension used is advantageously 0.05 cN/dtex for POYs and 0.2 cN/dtex for texturized yarn (DTY).<br>
The breaking tenacity and the breaking extension were determined in a Statement under the following conditions; the clamped length was 200 mm for POY and 5 00 mm for DTY, the rate of extension was 2 000 mm/min for POY and 1 500 mm/min for DTY and the pre-tension was 0.05 cN/dtex for POY and 0.2 cN/dtex for DTY. The maximum breaking load values were divided by the linear density to determine the breaking tenacity, and breaking extension was determined at maximum load.<br>
Comparative example<br>
Polyethylene terephthalate chips having a water content of less than 35 ppm, a limiting viscosity number of 0.64 dl/g and a melt viscosity (at 290,°C) of 250 Pas were fed into the intake of an extruder. The additive, dried to a residual moisture content of 
The additive used was a bead polymer prepared in suspension from MMA, styrene and N-cyclohexylmaleimide. The bead polymer was in tact a geopolymer containing 89.2% by weight of units derived from methyl methacrylate, 8.8% by weight of units derived from styrene and 2% by weight of units derived from N-cyclohexylmaleimide, had a viscosity number VN of about 101 cmVg and a melt viscosity (at 290°C) of about<br><br>
1 400 Pas.<br>
The MMA-styrene-N-cyclohexylmaleimide additive of VN 101 cave was obtained as follows:<br>
A mixture of 525 kg of demineralized water, 0.071 kg of KHSO4 and 13 kg of a 13 percent aqueous solution of polyacrylic acid was heated to 40*=*C in a 1 000 1 polymerization vessel  equipped  with  heating/cooling jacket,  stirrer,  reflux  condenser  and  thermometer. 525 kg of a mixture of 88.68 parts by weight of methyl methacrylate (MMA) , 8.75 parts by weight of styrene, 1.99 parts   by   weight   of   N-cyclohexylmaleimide, 0.14 part  by weight  of  2-ethylhexyl  thioglycolate, 0.09 part by weight of t-dodecyl mercaptan, 0.05” part by weight of stearic acid and 0.3 part by weight of dilauroyl peroxide was then added with stirring. The batch was polymerized at 80°C for 13 0 minutes and at 98°C  for  60 minutes  and  then  cooled  to  room temperature.  The  polymer  beads  were  filtered  off, thoroughly washed with demineralized water and dried in a fluidized bed dryer at 80°C.<br>
The dried polymer beads were subsequently admixed with 0.1 part by weight of a spray-dried MMA-styrene emulsion polymer by mixing in the fluidized bed dryer for about 5 minutes.<br>
The MMA-styrene emulsion polymer antis tat or flow aid was obtained as follows:<br>
A 50 0 1 polymerization vessel equipped with heating/cooling jacket, stirrer, reflux condenser and thermometer was charged with 80 kg of demineralized water, 0.016 kg of 75% sodium diisooctyl sulfosuccinate and 0.056 kg of sodium peroxodisulfate and heated to an internal temperature of 92°C. A second stirrer-equipped reactor was used to prepare, at room temperature, an emulsion of 182.4 kg of methyl methacrylate, 17.6 kg of styrene,  0.080 kg  of  2-ethylhexyl  thioglycolate  in<br><br>
120 kg of demineralized water containing 0.8 kg of sodium diisooctyl sulfosuccinate and 0.12 kg of sodium peroxodisulfate. This emulsion was metered at a rate of 1.2 kg/minute into the polymerization vessel, which was maintained at a polymerization temperature of about 92 °C by heating or cooling. On completion of the metered addition, the reactor contents were supplementarily heated at an internal temperature of 92°C for 3 0 minutes.<br>
The polymer dispersion obtained was subsequently spray dried in a Nero spray tower equipped with an atomizing disk rotating at 15 000 rpm. The air added was at a temperature of 180 to 190°C; the effluent air was at a temperature of 75 to 8 0*”0. The dried MMA-styrene copolymer had an average particle size of dgo = 14 /am.<br>
The VN of the spray-dried MMA-styrene copolymer was 97 cave.<br>
The spray-dried MMA-styrene copolymer was, as stated above, mixed into the MMA-styrene-N-cyclohexylmaleimide in a f fluidized bed dryer at room temperature for 5 minutes at a concentration of 0.1% by weight.<br>
This gave 510 kg of polymer beads having a DIN 7745 viscosity number of 101 cave/ a residual methyl methacrylate content of 0.47% by weight and an average particle diameter of 0,75 mm. The residual styrene content was below the detection limit of 0.05% by weight. The residual N-cyclohexylmaleimide content was below the detection limit of 0.1% by weight.<br>
The additive was added in a concentration of 0.77% by weight, based on the total amount of the polyester-additive polymer blend taken off the extruder-fed spinning system. The total amount of polymer blend taken off was defined by the number of operated spinning pumps of the hereinbelow described spinning<br><br>
system and by the throughput through every spinning pump used. When all the spinning pumps were in operation, a total amount of 304.5 kg/h of polymer blend was taken off the spinning system and the additive was gravimetrically metered into the extruder intake at a rate of 2.34 kg/h.<br>
Some form of preloading of the additive beads with the polyester chips occurred even in the extruder intake, by virtue of the undulating movement of the extruder screw. The polyester chips and the additive beads were conjointly melted and blended in an extruder, an LTM-24D/E8 spinning extruder from Barrage AG, Remscheidt/Germany. This first polymer blend was discharged at a temperature of 2 90°C at a pressure of 180 bar, fed through the melt line as a 304.5 kg/h melt stream and filtered through a 20 (mxm  candle filter.<br>
The filtered first polymer blend was fed to an SMX static mixer from Seltzer AG having an internal diameter of 52.5 mm and a length of 525 mm and homogenized and dispersed therein to form a second polymer blend.<br>
This second polymer blend was distributed by means of a product line over twelve spinning positions each position containing six spin packs, the average residence time of the second polymer blend from the time of exit from the static mixer to the time of entry into the spin pack being five minutes. Each spin pack contained a round die having 34 holes having a diameter of 0.25 mm and a length of twice the diameter. The spin pack contained, above the die plate, a spin filter pack, consisting of a steel sand packing 30 mm in height and 0.5 to 0.85 mm in particle size range and also a 40 /mX woven filter and a 20 film no woven steel filter. The diameter of the spin filter pack was 85 mm. The residence time of the melt in the filter pack was about 1.5 minutes. The heating of the spin pack was adjusted to 290°C. The surface of the spinnerette was<br><br>
situated 30 mm above the heating box wall. As the melt blend passed through, the die pressure was 150 bar. The average residence time of the polymer blend formed from polyester and additive melt from the point of exit from the extruder to the point of exit from the spin packs was about ten minutes.<br>
The molten filaments extruded from the spinnerette holes were cooled to 18°C by quench air flowing horizontally against the spinline at a flow rate of 0 - 55 m/s, were converged and spin finished in an oilier pad at a distance of 1 250 mm from the die plate.<br>
A pair of S-wrapped godets drew the spinline down at a speed of 5 000 m/min, at a spinline extension ratio setting of 141.<br>
An entangling jet installed between the godets which was closed when yarn transport was normal was used to entangle the yarn to 13 nodes/m using an air pressure of 4.5 bar. The entangling jet inlet tension was adjusted to 0.16 g/denier.<br>
Six ends at a time from one spinning position were wound up on bobbins, the winding speed of 4 985 m/min having been chosen so that the yarn tension was 0.1 g/denier upstream of the winder. The POYs obtained were characterized by a linear density of 126 denier, a breaking extension of 116% and a tenacity of 2 ,4 g/denier.<br>
During the production period of seven days, the breakage rate incurred when operating the spinning system was an average of 0.75 broken ends per metric ton of polymer blend throughput.<br>
The POYs obtained were draw textured at a speed of 900 m/min on an FK6 texturing machine from Barrage AG/Germany. The draw ratio was set to 1.77 and heater temperatures 1 and 2 to 210”C and 170°C respectively.<br><br>
The breakage rate averaged 21 broken ends per metric ton of textured yarn. The textured yarn had a linear density of 74 denier, a tenacity of 4.5 g/denier, a breaking extension of 18.3% and was characterized by good uniformity of dyeing.<br>
Inventive example<br>
The spinning system described in the comparative example was used with the same throughputs and under the same spinning conditions. The inventive example likewise employed an additive containing 89.2% by weight of units derived from methyl methacrylate, 8,8% by weight of units derived from styrene and 2% by weight of units derived from N-cyclohexylmaleimide, the geopolymer having a viscosity number VN of about 101 cave- In contradistinction to the comparative example under 1 hereinabove, however, the MMA-styrene-N-cyclohexylmaleimide additive employed was obtained by multiple initiation as follows:<br>
A mixture of 525 kg of demineralized water, 0.071 kg of KHSO4 and 13 kg of a 13 percent aqueous solution of polyacrylic  acid was heated to 40°C  in a  10001 polymerization vessel  equipped with  heating/cooling j accept,  stirrer,  reflux  condenser  and  thermometer. 525 kg of a mixture of 88.68 parts by weight of methyl methacrylate  (MMA),  8.75 parts by weight of styrene, 1.99 parts   by   weight   of   N-cyclohexylmaleimide, 0.14 part  by weight  of  2-ethylhexyl  thioglycolate, 0.09 part by weight of t-dodecyl mercaptan, 0.05 part by weight of  stearic acid,  0.2 part by weight  of dilauroyl peroxide and 0.1 part by weight of tert-amyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate was then added with stirring. The batch was polymerized at 80°C for 115 minutes and at  98°C  for  60 minutes  and  then  cooled  to  room temperature.  The  polymer beads  were  filtered off, thoroughly washed with demineralized water and dried in a fluidized bed dryer at 80°C. The dried polymer beads<br><br>
were subsequently admixed with 0.1 part by weight of a spray-dried MMA-styrene emulsion polymer, the synthesis of which is described hereinabove in the comparative example, and mixed in the fluidized bed dryer for about 5 minutes.<br>
This gave 513 kg of polymer beads having a DIN 7745 viscosity number of 101 cm”/g, a residual methyl methacrylate content of 0.22% by weight and an average particle diameter of 0.75 mm. The residual styrene content was below the detection limit of 0.05% by weight. The residual N-cyclohexylmaleimide content was below the detection limit of 0.1% by weight.<br>
The additive of the inventive example thus had a distinctly lower residual monomer content, compared with the additive of the comparative example, for the same bead size and after the same treatment with MMA-styrene emulsion polymer in the fluidized bed dryer.<br>
The additive was added in an amount of 0.77% by weight, based on the entire amount of the polymer blend fed to the spinning system, and the polymer blend was spun similarly to the comparative example. POY was again produced during a production period of seven days. It was characterized by a linear density of 126 denier, a breaking extension of 117% and a tenacity of 2.4 g/denier. The breakage rate on operation of the system averaged 0.35 broken ends per metric ton of polymer blend throughput.<br>
The POYs were draw textured similarly to the comparative example at a speed of 900 m/min. The breakage rate averaged 18 troches ends per metric ton of textured yarn. The textured yarn, for the same linear density and the same tenacity as the textured yarn of the comparative example, had a breaking extension of 18.6% coupled with a similar uniformity of dyeing.<br><br><br><br><br>
