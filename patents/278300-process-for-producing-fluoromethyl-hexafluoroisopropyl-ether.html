				<td>Technical Field<br>
[0001.] The present invention relates to a process for producing fluoromethyl<br>
hexafluoroisopropyl ether, which is used as an inhalation anesthetic.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002.] Fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether, known as "Sevoflurane", is used<br>
as an inhalation anesthetic with good anesthetic performance. As a production<br>
method of fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether, there is known a process of<br>
reacting formaldehyde (paraformaldehyde) with hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol in a<br>
liquid phase by the use of sulfuric acid as a dehydrating agent in hydrogen fluoride<br>
(see Patent Document 1). Further, there is proposed a process for obtaining<br>
fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether by selective solvent extraction or distillation,<br>
in place of using a dehydrating agent, from a reaction mixture in which<br>
hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol and formaldehyde are in equilibrium in hydrogen<br>
fluoride (see Patent Document 2). It has been found that several percentages of<br>
fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether can be obtained by mixing hydrogen<br>
fluoride with formaldehyde (trioxane), cooling the mixture, adding<br>
hexafluoroisopropanol to the mixture, and then, stirring the resulting mixture (see<br>
Patent Document 3). There is also proposed a process for producing fluoromethyl<br>
hexafluoroisopropyl ether by reacting high-purity bisfluoromethyl ether with<br>
hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol in the presence of sulfuric acid (see Patent Documents<br>
4 and 5).<br>

Summary of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0004.] The production process of Patent Document 1 has difficulty in wasting<br>
the sulfuric acid used as the dehydrating agent. The production process of Patent<br>
Document 2 uses a large amount of hydrogen fluoride to e.g. separate Sevoflurane<br>
from the reaction system by azeoptropic extraction with hydrogen fluoride and<br>
requires extra caution in handling such a large amount of hydrogen fluoride. The<br>
process of Patent Document 3 is low in yield and is not so practical. The<br>
production process of Patent Document 4 has the possibility of generating a large<br>
amount of liquid waste containing sulfuric acid or hydrofluoric acid due to the use of<br>
1 mL of 98% sulfuric acid per 2 g of bisfluoromethyl ether and 4.1 g of<br>
hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol. The production process of Patent Document 5, which<br>
is similar to the production process of Patent Document 4, also has the possibility of<br>
generating a large amount of liquid waste containing sulfuric acid or hydrofluoric<br>
acid due to the use of 20 mL of sulfuric acid per 100 uL of bisfluoromethyl ether<br>
and about 16 uL of hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol. There is technical difficulty in<br>
recovering sulfuric acid and hydrogen fluoride or hydrofluoric acid from the liquid<br>
waste. It is thus common practice to fix the waste acid with a basic substance and<br>
dispose of the fixed acid waste. However, the disposal of such waste acid raises a<br>
concern of environmental load.<br>
[0005.] It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an industrially<br>
applicable process for producing fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether<br>
((CF3)2CH-O-CH2F) without using hydrogen fluoride or a large amount of sulfuric<br>
acid and thereby without causing a large amount of waste acid as a by-product.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
[0006.] In order to solve the above problems, the present inventors have made<br>
researches on the production of fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether with the use<br>
of bisfluoromethyl ether and hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol as raw materials but<br>
without the use of hydrogen fluoride and have found that, in the case of reacting<br>
 <br>
bisfluoromethyl ether and hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol in the presence of an acid<br>
catalyst, it is possible by the coexistence of a specific solvent in the reaction system<br>
to reduce the amount of the acid catalyst to a significantly small level and allow the<br>
reaction to proceed even under moderate conditions.<br>
[0007.] Namely, the present invention includes the following features.<br>
[Inventive Feature 1 ]<br>
A process for producing fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether,<br>
comprising: reacting bisfluoromethyl ether with hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol in a<br>
solvent substantially immiscible with hydrogen fluoride in the presence of a<br>
catalytic amount of a strong acid selected from sulfuric acid and any other acids<br>
stronger in acidity than sulfuric acid.<br>
[Inventive Feature 2]<br>
The process for producing fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether<br>
according to Inventive Feature 1, wherein the solvent is any of halogenated aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons.<br>
[Inventive Feature 3]<br>
The process for producing fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether<br>
according to Inventive Feature 1 or 2, wherein the strong acid is one kind, or two or<br>
more kinds, selected from the group consisting of sulfuric acid,<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and fluorosulfuric acid.<br>
[0008.] The process of the present invention enables industrial production of<br>
fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether ((CF3)2CH-O-CH2F) without using<br>
hydrogen fluoride or a large amount of sulfuric acid and thereby without causing a<br>
large amount of waste catalyst as a by-product.<br>
Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0009.] Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail below. In<br>
the present specification, bisfluoromethyl ether, hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol and<br>
fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether may sometimes be abbreviated as "FE",<br>
"HFIP" and "SEVO", respectively.<br>
 <br>
[0010.] In the present invention, fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether is<br>
produced by reaction of bisfluoromethyl ether and hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol in a<br>
specific solvent in the presence of a catalytic amount of a strong acid selected from<br>
sulfuric acid and any other acids stronger in acidity than sulfuric acid.<br>
[0011.] Namely, the bisfluoromethyl ether (CH2F-O-CH2F) is reacted with the<br>
hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol ((CF3)2CHOH) by the catalytic action of the strong acid<br>
in the production process of the fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether according to<br>
the present invention. The following equilibrium is established in the reaction<br>
system.<br>
 <br>
Fluoromethanol (CH2FOH) generated as a by-product is unstable and immediately<br>
decomposed into hydrogen fluoride and formaldehyde (CH2O) under the<br>
equilibrium. It is assumed that, due to the facts that: hydrogen fluoride is<br>
substantially insoluble in the solvent of the present invention; and fluoromethyl<br>
hexafluoroisopropyl ether is soluble in the solvent of the present invention, the<br>
existence of the solvent of the present invention in the present equilibrium system<br>
makes it possible that the fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether can be obtained<br>
efficiently by letting out the hydrogen fluoride from the solvent but allowing the<br>
fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether to remain in the solvent.<br>
[0012.] In the present invention, the hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol is used in an<br>
amount of 0.1 to 1000 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the bisfluoromethyl<br>
ether. It is preferable to use 0.5 to 500 parts by mass of the hexafluoroisopropyl<br>
alcohol per 100 parts by mass of the bisfluoromethyl ether. As is apparent from the<br>
above reaction formula, the reaction of the bisfluoromethyl ether with the<br>
hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol is a 1:1 reaction. Although it is suffice to use the<br>
hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol and the bisfluoromethyl ether at a molar ratio of 1:1,<br>
either one of the hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol and the bisfluoromethyl ether may be<br>
 <br>
used in a larger amount than that of the other in view of the availability of these raw<br>
materials.<br>
[0013.] There is no particular limitation on the method of preparation of the FE<br>
and HFIP as the raw materials in the present invention. The raw materials can be<br>
prepared by any known methods. For example, it is feasible to prepare the FE by<br>
reaction of formaldehyde and hydrogen fluoride as disclosed in Patent Document 3<br>
and is feasible to prepare the HFIP by catalytic reduction of hexafiuoroacetone<br>
hydrate in a liquid phase as disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.<br>
S59-204142 and in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. HO 1-301631.<br>
[0014.] In the present invention, the strong acid used as a catalyst is selected from<br>
sulfuric acid and any other acids stronger in acidity (larger in acid dissociation<br>
constant) than sulfuric acid. Specific examples of such a strong acid are: sulfuric<br>
acid (Hammett acidity function Ho = -12, pKa = -5.0): trifluoromethanesulfonic acid<br>
(Ho = -14.9, pKa - -13); fluorosulfuric acid (Ho = -15); imidic acid [(CF3SO2)2NH];<br>
and methide acid [(CF3SO2)3CH]. Among others, sulfuric acid,<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and fluorosulfuric acid are particularly preferred as<br>
these acids are readily available. The strong acid is used in a sufficient amount to<br>
allow the reaction to proceed (referred to as "catalytic amount" in the present<br>
specification). The amount of the acid used as the catalyst is 0.001 to 10 parts by<br>
mass, preferably 0.001 to 1 part by mass, per 100 parts by mass of the reaction<br>
solution constituting the reaction system. In practice, the acid amount is not<br>
limitative and can be set automatically within the range that the acid can be<br>
dissolved in the solvent used. If the amount of the acid falls within the above range<br>
but exceeds the solubility limit, the reaction solution cannot be obtained as a<br>
uniform solution by the addition of the acid so that it is useless to add such an<br>
excessive amount of acid. The rate of the reaction is unfavorably low if the amount<br>
of the acid is smaller than the above range. It is feasible to dissolve a catalytic<br>
amount of strong acid in the solvent by adding the strong acid to the solvent, stirring<br>
the acid and the solvent well, and then, isolating the undissolved acid from the<br>
solvent. The strong acid such as sulfuric acid can be used in the form of a<br>
commercially available reagent or an industrial material as it is.<br>
 <br>
[0015.] The solvent of the present invention is required to dissolve therein the<br>
catalytic amount of strong acid and the bisfluoromethyl ether, be stable in the<br>
presence of the strong acid and be substantially immiscible with hydrogen fluoride.<br>
It means that, when the solvent is substantially immiscible with hydrogen fluoride,<br>
the hydrogen fluoride is substantially insoluble, almost insoluble or at least not<br>
completely soluble in the solvent. As such a solvent, there can be used any of<br>
halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons.<br>
Specific examples of the halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons are dichloromethane,<br>
chloroform, tetrachloromethane, dichloroethane, trichloroethane, tetrachloroethane,<br>
trichlorotrifluoroethane, 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HFC-245fa) and<br>
l-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene (HCFC-1233). Specific examples of the<br>
halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons are benzotrifluoride, bistrifluoromethylbenzene<br>
and 2,4-dichlorobenzotrifluoride. As these solvents can dissolve therein a slight<br>
amount of strong acid such as sulfuric acid or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, are<br>
stable in the presence of the strong acid, and can dissolve therein the FE, it is<br>
possible to carry out the reaction of the FE with the HFIP under moderate conditions<br>
and thereby produce the SEVO by the use of any of these solvents. Further, these<br>
solvents may be used in combination of two or more kinds thereof. There is no<br>
particular limitation on the amount of the solvent in the reaction system. The<br>
solvent is generally used in an amount of 0.1 to 99.9 parts by mass per 100 parts by<br>
mass of the total amount of the reaction system. It is preferable to use 1 to 99 parts<br>
by mass, more preferably 5 to 95 parts by mass, of the solvent per 100 parts by mass<br>
of the total amount of the reaction system. If the amount of the solvent is less than<br>
0.1 part by mass, the solvent unfavorably does not perform its function. If the<br>
amount of the solvent exceeds 99.9 parts by mass, the proportion of the reaction<br>
substrates in the reaction system is so low that the productivity of the reaction<br>
system is unfavorably decreased.<br>
[0016.] In the present invention, the reaction temperature is in the range of 0 to<br>
150°C, preferably 5 to 100°C, more preferably 30 to 80°C. If the reaction<br>
temperature is lower than 0°C, the rate of the reaction is low. If the reaction<br>
temperature exceeds 150°C, it is necessary to use a special pressure-resistance<br>
reaction container and externally pressurize the container with nitrogen or the like in<br>
 <br>
order to carry out the reaction in a liquid phase. Under such pressurized conditions,<br>
however, the amount of impurities in the reaction product is unfavorably increased<br>
even though the rate of the reaction is made high.<br>
[0017.] The reaction time is in the range of 1 minute to 100 hours, generally 10<br>
minutes to 50 hours, and can be set as appropriate in the present invention.<br>
Although the reaction can be performed in either a batch system or a flow system, it<br>
is preferable to perform the reaction in a batch system. Further, the reaction can be<br>
performed with or without stirring.<br>
[0018.] Not only the fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether but also the<br>
unreacted bisfluoromethyl ether, hydrogen fluoride etc. are contained in the reaction<br>
product of the present invention. There is no particular limitation on the method of<br>
extraction of the fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether from the reaction product.<br>
The fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether can be extracted from the reaction<br>
product by any known method. For example, it is feasible to extract the<br>
fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether by placing the reaction product in water to<br>
thereby separate the reaction product into an aqueous layer containing an acid<br>
component and a solvent layer, and then, distillating the solvent layer. In order to<br>
separate the acid component by water washing as mentioned above, it is desirable to<br>
use the solvent insoluble or difficult to dissolve in water.<br>
Examples<br>
[0019.] The present invention will be described in more detail below by way of<br>
the following examples. It should be noted that these examples are illustrative and<br>
are not intended to limit the present invention thereto. In the following examples,<br>
the analysis of organic substances was conducted by gas chromatography (with a<br>
FID detector) unless otherwise specified.<br>
[0020.] [Example 1]<br>
In a 20-mL lidded glass container, 5 g of dichloromethane was placed.<br>
Then, 0.1 g (0.001 mol) of sulfuric acid was added to and mixed well by shaking<br>
with the dichloromethane. The resulting solution was left still. It was found that<br>
some amount of the sulfuric acid was adhered to an inner surface of the glass<br>
 <br>
container without being dissolved in the dichloromethane. This 5-g<br>
dichloromethane solution of the sulfuric acid was provided as an acid catalyst<br>
solution. In a 10-mL lidded polyethylene container, 9 g (0.3 mol in terms of<br>
formaldehyde) of trioxane was placed. While externally cooling the container with<br>
ice, 30 g (1.5 mol) of hydrogen fluoride was added into the container. The lid of<br>
the container was closed. The trioxane was then dissolved in the hydrogen fluoride.<br>
The lid of the container was opened after confirming that the content of the<br>
container was in the form of a uniform solution. Subsequently, 20 g of<br>
dichloromethane was added to the uniform solution. The lid of the container was<br>
closed. The resulting solution was mixed well by shaking, left still and thereby<br>
separated into a lower dichloromethane layer and an upper hydrogen fluoride layer.<br>
The lower dichloromethane layer was isolated. To the upper hydrogen fluoride<br>
layer, 20 g of dichloromethane was again added. The lid of the container was<br>
closed. The resulting solution was then mixed well by shaking and left still. The<br>
lower dichloromethane layer was isolated and blended with the previously isolated<br>
dichloromethane layer. The same operation was repeated again. With this, about<br>
53 g of the transparent dichloromethane solution was obtained. Some amount of<br>
the obtained dichloromethane solution was sampled. The hydrogen fluoride<br>
dissolved in the sampled dichloromethane solution was fixed with sodium fluoride<br>
powder. After that, the dichloromethane solution was analyzed by gas<br>
chromatography. There was detected 0.03 mol of bisfluoromethyl ether in the<br>
dichloromethane solution. Into this dichloromethane solution, 6 g (0.036 mol) of<br>
hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol was added and mixed. Immediately after the mixing,<br>
some amount of the mixed dichloromethane solution was sampled. The hydrogen<br>
fluoride dissolved in the sampled dichloromethane solution was fixed with sodium<br>
fluoride powder. The dichloromethane solution was then analyzed by gas<br>
chromatography. There was newly detected 0.036 mol of HFIP in addition to the<br>
0.03 mol of bisfluoromethyl ether (FE) in the dichloromethane solution. The<br>
generation of fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether (SEVO) was not however<br>
detected at all. Next, 10 g of this FE- and HFIP-containing dichloromethane<br>
solution was placed in a 100-mL polyethylene container and mixed with the<br>
above-prepared 5-g dichloromethane solution of the sulfuric acid. At the time the<br>
 <br>
resulting mixed solution was held at 25°C for 15 hours, the reaction was completed.<br>
After the completion of the reaction, while externally cooling with ice the<br>
polyethylene container accommodating therein the mixed solution, the lid of the<br>
polyethylene container was opened. Ice was then added into the mixed solution.<br>
The lid of the polyethylene container was closed. The mixed solution was mixed<br>
well by shaking, thereby terminating the reaction. The reaction-terminated solution<br>
was left still. The thus-formed lower dichloromethane layer was isolated, dried<br>
with sodium sulfate, and then, analyzed by gas chromatography. As a result, the<br>
generation of SEVO was confirmed. The yield of the SEVO on the FE basis was<br>
38% as determined from the ratio of peak areas in the gas chromatograph.<br>
[0021.] [Example 2]<br>
The experiment was conducted in the same manner as in Example 1<br>
except for using trifluoromethanesulfonic acid as an acid catalyst. The acid<br>
catalyst was prepared as follows. In a 20-mL lidded glass container, 5 g of<br>
dichloromethane was placed. Then, 0.15 g (0.001 mol) of trifluoromethanesulfonic<br>
acid was added to and mixed well by shaking with the dichloromethane. The<br>
resulting solution was left still. It was found that some amount of the<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonic acid remained separated on a bottom of the glass container<br>
without being dissolved in the dichloromethane. This 5-g dichloromethane<br>
solution of the trifluoromethanesulfonic acid was provided as an acid catalyst<br>
solution. In a 100-mL lidded polyethylene container, 10 g of the FE- and<br>
HFIP-containing dichloromethane solution as obtained in Example 1 was placed and<br>
mixed with the prepared 5-g dichloromethane solution of the<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (acid catalyst solution). At the time the resulting<br>
mixed solution was held at 25°C for 15 hours, the reaction was completed. After<br>
the completion of the reaction, while externally cooling with ice the polyethylene<br>
container accommodating therein the mixed solution, the lid of the polyethylene<br>
container was opened. Ice was then added into the mixed solution. The lid of the<br>
polyethylene container was closed. The mixed solution was mixed well by shaking,<br>
thereby terminating the reaction. The reaction-terminated solution was left still.<br>
The thus-formed lower dichloromethane layer was isolated, dried with sodium<br>
 <br>
sulfate, and then, analyzed by gas chromatography. The generation of SEVO was<br>
confirmed. The yield of the SEVO on the FE basis was 58% as determined from<br>
the ratio of peak areas in the gas chromatograph.<br>
[0022.] [Comparative Example 1]<br>
The experiment was conducted in the same manner as in Example 1<br>
except for using methanesulfonic acid (pKa = -1.2) as an acid catalyst as follows.<br>
Into 5 g of dichloromethane, 0.1 g (0.001 mol) of methanesulfonic acid was added<br>
and mixed well by shaking. The resulting solution was left still. It was confirmed<br>
that the methanesulfonic acid was dissolved in the dichloromethane. This 5-g<br>
dichloromethane solution of the methanesulfonic acid was provided as an acid<br>
catalyst solution. In a 100-mL lidded polyethylene container, 10 g of the FE- and<br>
HFIP-containing dichloromethane solution as obtained in Example 1 was placed and<br>
mixed with the prepared 5-g dichloromethane solution of the methanesulfonic acid<br>
(acid catalyst solution). At the time the resulting mixed solution was held at 25°C<br>
for 15 hours, the reaction was completed. After the completion of the reaction,<br>
while externally cooling with ice the polyethylene container accommodating therein<br>
the mixed solution, the lid of the polyethylene container was opened. Ice was then<br>
added into the mixed solution. The lid of the polyethylene container was closed.<br>
The mixed solution was mixed vvell by shaking, thereby terminating the reaction.<br>
The reaction-terminated solution was left still. The thus-formed lower<br>
dichloromethane layer was isolated, dried with sodium sulfate, and then, analyzed<br>
by gas chromatography. The generation of SEVO was not almost detected.<br>
[0023.] [Comparative Example 2]<br>
The experiment was conducted in the same manner as in Example 1<br>
except for using paratoluenesulfonic acid (pKa = -2.8) as an acid catalyst as follows.<br>
In a 20-mL lidded glass container, 5 g of dichloromethane was placed. Then, 0.17<br>
g (0.001 mol) of paratoluenesulfonic acid was added to and mixed well by shaking<br>
with the dichloromethane. The resulting solution was left still. It was confirmed<br>
that the paratoluenesulfonic acid remained separated as a solid on a bottom of the<br>
glass container without being dissolved in the dichloromethane. This 5-g<br>
dichloromethane solution of the paratoluenesulfonic acid was provided as an acid<br>
 <br>
catalyst solution. In a 100-mL lidded polyethylene container, 10 g of the FE- and<br>
HFIP-containing dichloromethane solution as obtained in Example 1 was placed and<br>
mixed with the prepared 5-g dichloromethane solution of the paratoluenesulfonic<br>
acid (including the undissolved paratoluenesulfonic acid). At the time the resulting<br>
mixed solution was held at 25°C for 15 hours, the reaction was completed. After<br>
the completion of the reaction, while externally cooling with ice the polyethylene<br>
container accommodating therein the mixed solution, the lid of the polyethylene<br>
container was opened. Ice was then added into the mixed solution. The lid of the<br>
polyethylene container was closed. The mixed solution was mixed well by shaking,<br>
thereby terminating the reaction. The reaction-terminated solution was left still.<br>
The thus-formed lower dichloromethane layer was isolated, dried with sodium<br>
sulfate, and then, analyzed by gas chromatography. The generation of SEVO was<br>
not almost detected.<br>
[0024.] As described above, it is possible according to the present invention to<br>
enable industrial production of the fiuoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether<br>
((CF3)2CH-O-CH2F) without using hydrogen fluoride or a large amount of sulfuric<br>
acid as an acid and thereby without causing a large amount of acid waste as a<br>
by-product.<br>
[0025.] Although the present invention has been described with reference to the<br>
above specific embodiments, the present invention is not limited to these exemplary<br>
embodiments. Various modifications and variations of the embodiments described<br>
above can be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
 <br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A process for producing fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether,<br>
comprising: reacting bisfluoromethyl ether with hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol in a<br>
solvent substantially immiscible with hydrogen fluoride in the presence of a<br>
catalytic amount of a strong acid selected from sulfuric acid and any other acids<br>
stronger in acidity than sulfuric acid.<br>
2.	The process for producing fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether<br>
according to claim 1, wherein the solvent is any of halogenated aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons.<br>
3.	The process for producing fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether<br>
according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the strong acid is one kind, or two or more kinds,<br>
selected from sulfuric acid, trifluoromefhanesulfonic acid and fluorosulfuric acid.<br>
 <br>
<br>
There is provided according to the present invention a process for<br>
producing fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether ((CF3)2CH-O-CH2F), including:<br>
reacting bisfluoromethyl ether with hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol in a solvent<br>
substantially immiscible with hydrogen fluoride in the presence of a catalytic<br>
amount of a strong acid selected from sulfuric acid and any other acids stronger in<br>
acidity than sulfuric acid. The process of the present invention enables industrial<br>
production of the fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether without using hydrogen<br>
fluoride or a large amount of sulfuric acid and thereby without causing a large<br>
amount of waste as a by-product.</td>
