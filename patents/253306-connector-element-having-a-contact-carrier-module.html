LOCKING DEVICE FOR CONNECTOR ELEMENTS AND A CONNECTOR PROVIDED WITH SAID DEVICE<br>
The present invention relates to a connector element locking device and a connector that is provided with said device.<br>
Electrical connectors, notably in their automobile applications, contain contact-locking devices that assure that the contacts are firmly held in their sockets.<br>
These locking devices frequently have a mobile part such as a front cap comprising a front face, provided with holes for passage of the contact pins that will be coupled with complementary female contacts, and lateral walls enclosing the lateral faces of a contact-carrier module.<br>
The cap/module assembly thus constitutes a first connector element bearing contacts of a first type designed to be coupled with a second connector element bearing contacts of a second type, complementary to the first type.<br>
In order to permit repairing the connector and being able to detect a poorly inserted contact, the cap can move between a contact insertion/extraction position and a contact locking position.<br>
It is necessary to make the functioning of connectors secure and, before complementary connector elements are coupled, to guarantee, on the one hand, that the contacts are correctly inserted, and, on the other hand, that the contact locking devices are in their locking position.<br>
In order to do this, the present invention seeks to propose a device for locking a cap onto a contact-carrier module, wherein the cap bearing means for locking the contacts disposed in the contact-carrier module is assembled onto<br><br>
the coupling face of the contact-earner module in such a way that the cap and the module form a first connector element, characterized in that it has means for latching the cap onto the module in a longitudinal position for locking the contacts, and removable stop means that prevent the connector element from being coupled with a complementary connector element as long as the cap is not latched onto the module in the contact locking position.<br>
According to the invention, the latching means comprise, in particular a lever provided with at least one locking finger, the removable stop means advantageously comprising a first arm of the lever.<br>
In order to latch the cap in the contact locking position, the device can comprise a first locking finger, and the device can also comprise a second locking finger that latches the cap onto the contact-carrier module in a contact insertion/extraction position-In an alternative embodiment, the device comprises a locking finger that, when it is in a first position, latches the cap onto the contact-carrier module in the contact locking position, and, when it is in a second position, latches the cap in a contact insertion/extraction position.<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of the invention will be better understood upon reading the description that will follow of examples of embodiment of the invention in reference to the figures, which show:<br>
In Figure 1: A perspective view of a cap and a contact-carrier module according to a first example of embodiment of the invention;<br><br>
in Figure 2A and 2B:  Perspective views of the example of embodiment of<br>
Figure 1 in position before coupling with a complementary connector<br>
element;<br>
In Figures 3A, 3B and 3C:  Sectional views of details of the locking device<br>
according to the example of Figure 1, respectively, in the position before<br>
mounting, in the contact insertion/extraction position and in the contact<br>
locking position;<br>
In Figure 4: A sectional perspective view of a module and a cap according<br>
to a second example of embodiment;<br>
In Figures 5A to 5F:  Partial sectional perspective views, in various<br>
functioning positions, of a device according to Figure 4;<br>
In Figure 6: A sectional view of a cap and a contact-carrier module<br>
according to the invention.<br>
The object of the invention is to create a device that prevents the coupling of a first connector element comprising a contact-carrier module and a cap protecting the front part of the first connector element, with a second complementary connector element, in the case where the first connector element is not correctly assembled.<br>
Figure 1 shows a general view of such a first connector element provided with a cap 1 and a contact-carrier module 2, making up the first connector element 11 after assembly.<br>
A section of the connector element cap mounted on the module is shown in Figure 6.<br><br>
According to this example, cap 1 bears means 3 for locking contacts 23 positioned in the contact-carrier module and connected to a cable 24.<br>
Locking means 3 are here secondary locking means for the contacts and are pressing on contact retaining tabs 25.<br>
An embodiment for which locking means 3 are directly held on the contacts can be envisioned according to the invention.<br>
According to the example, the cap is designed to be assembled on the coupling face of contact-carrier module 2 in order to form first connector element 11.<br>
The cap is shown in Figure 6 in a contact insertion/extraction position, means 3 not yet resting on the tabs, so that these tabs can hold the contacts in position, but can release the contacts if the cable is pulled sufficiently hard or if the tab is lifted by its front part.<br>
Returning to Figure 1, a first example of embodiment of the cap locking device according to the invention is shown. The locking device here has a lever 14 of one piece with the cap and pivoting around a lateral face of the cap.<br>
This first example of embodiment is detailed more precisely in Figures 3A to 3B, and its use is shown in Figures 2A and 2B, which show the connector element of Figure 1 when it is coupled with a complementary connector element 12.<br>
The device for locking cap 1 onto contact-carrier module 2 shown in Figures 3A to 3C has means 4, 5, 6, 14 for latching cap 1 onto module 2.<br><br>
These latching means permit positioning the cap on the module in a longitudinal contact insertion/extraction position as well as in a longitudinal contact locking position.<br>
According to the embodiment of Figure 1, the means for latching the cap onto the module comprise a lever 14 provided with at least one locking finger 4.<br>
According to the embodiment of Figures 3A to 3C, lever 14 is provided with two locking fingers 4 and 5.<br>
The one or more locking fingers permit(s) latching the cap onto the module in the contact insertion/extraction position and in the contact locking position described above.<br>
In the case of the device with a single locking finger such as shown in Figure 1, the contact insertion/extraction position can be a position that does not block the cap.<br>
In the versions with two locking fingers shown in Figures 3A to 3C, the first position is a stable position for which a first finger 4 is latched onto a stud 6 in order to position the cap in the contact insertion/extraction position, the lever remaining in an inclined position for which a rear arm 10 of the lever passes through the outer footprint of the cap to interfere with a projecting part 16 of complementary connector element 12. The first locking finger here is connected to the lever bearing a second locking finger, but, in an alternative version, can be separate from this lever.<br>
In order to prevent a coupling of the connector elements, the device has removable stop means that prevent the coupling of the connector element with<br><br>
the complementary connector element until the cap is latched in the contact locking position onto the module, that is to say, when the cap is still not in the contact locking position.<br>
According to the example of embodiment of Figures 3A to 3C, the removable stop means are made up of the end of arm 10.<br>
This arm is a manipulating handle of the lever, which is opposite a second lever arm bearing locking fingers 4, 5, relative to a rotation point 21 of lever 13.<br>
In the position of Figures 2A and 3B. arm 10 interferes with projecting part 16 of complementary connector element 12 and prevents a coupling of connector elements 11, 12.<br>
In Figure 3AT cap 1 is pre-mounted on module 2, while in Figure 3B. cap 1 is in the contact insertion/extraction position.<br>
As indicated previously, the example of Figures 3A to 3C is a device having two locking fingers, finger 4 for the contact insertion/extraction position, finger 5 for the contact locking position.<br>
In order to reach the contact locking position shown in Figure 3C, it is necessary to push cap 1 while possibly pressing manipulating handle 10 until this locking finger 5 is latched behind stud 6 after passage on stud 6 into a retaining cavity of cap 1, this cavity here being made up by the space behind stud 6.<br>
The cap is then in the contact locking position and, in this position, arm 22 bearing locking finger 5 rests on stud 6 so that lever 14 is bent and lowers the first arm 10 into a position that does not interfere with said projecting part of complementary connector 12.<br><br>
Thus, the connector elements can be coupled in the contact locking position and only in this position.<br>
By referring to Figure 6, one notes that one function of the device is to detect a poorly inserted contact.<br>
In fact, in the case of a contact poorly inserted in its socket, corresponding tab 25 bumps into the contact body and is pushed away from its position of being latched in the contact.<br>
In such a situation, cap locking element 3 bumps into tab 25 in its turn, which prevents positioning the cap in the contact locking position.<br>
In such a case, the removable stop means comprising the first arm 10 of lever 14 cannot be removed, which renders a coupling of the connector elements impossible, and thus permits detecting the poor insertion of at least one contact<br>
Such an embodiment is particularly sought after in the automobile field, in which it is desired to detect poor mounting in the production line, while preventing the mounting of connectors whose contacts are incorrectly inserted.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is notably shown in Figures 5A to 5F.<br>
According to this embodiment, cap 1 also has a locking lever 13 and removable stop means comprising a first arm 9 of lever 13.<br>
In contrast, according to this embodiment, first arm 9 is contiguous with a locking finger 7 that assures locking the cap onto the module in the contact locking position.<br><br>
First arm 9 here is opposite a manipulating handle 15 of lever 13 relative to a rotation point 21 of lever 13, and has a protuberance 9a at its end.<br>
The removable stop means comprise protuberance 9a of first arm 9^ which interferes with a projecting part 16 of the complementary connector element and prevents the coupling of connector elements 11,12 when the cap is not in the locked position on module 2.<br>
In order to do this and to hold first arm 9 in the interference position the stop means also comprise a counter-stop 17 on module 2.<br>
The counter-stop is positioned so that in the contact insertion/extraction position, a lower segment of the first arm 9 rests on counter-stop 17, which thus prevents the bending of lever 13.<br>
As soon as cap 1 has been pushed into the contact locking position, the segment is offset beyond counter-stop 17.<br>
Protuberance 9a can thus be removed from a position of interference with said projecting part of complementary connector 12 by bending lever 13.<br>
In order to conserve a different elasticity between locking finger 7 and first arm 9, the first arm is separated from finger 7. The first arm has two longitudinal branches 18, 19 and a cross-bridge 20, longitudinal branches 18, 19 framing locking finger 7, and cross-bridge 20 being situated on top of finger 7.<br>
Thus, the device according to the invention can comprise a first locking finger 4 that latches the cap in the contact insertion/extraction position, and a second locking finger 5 that latches the cap in the contact locking position on the contact-carrier module, or can comprise a single locking finger 7 that latches the<br><br>
cap in the insertion/extraction position as well as in the position for locking onto the contact-carrier module.<br>
The versions for which the arm making up the stop means is opposite the arm bearing the locking fingers relative to a pivoting point 21 of the lever permit detecting when the cap is not in place at the beginning of the connection with the complementary connector element.<br>
The version for which the arm forming the stop means is found on the same side as the locking fingers permits creating a less cumbersome cap, for which manipulating handle 15 is protected in the footprint of the cap between longitudinal partitions 26 on the cap.  The invention is not limited to the examples of embodiment shown, and notably stud 6 can be in the form of a cross-piece.<br>
Moreover, the insertion/extraction and locking positions can be obtained by latching the fingers in a succession of cavities separated by gaps; therefore, the lever making up part of the stop means according to the example of embodiment of Figure 5 can be a separate lever from the lever bearing the one or more locking pieces.<br><br><br>
