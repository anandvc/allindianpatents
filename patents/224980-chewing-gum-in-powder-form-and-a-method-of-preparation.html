				<td> CHEWING GUM IN POWDER FORM AND A METHOD OF PREPARATION<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
The subject of the present invention is a novel chewing<br>
gum in tablet form, which can be produced by direct<br>
compression of a gum formulation in powder form; the<br>
chewing gum thus obtained is characterized by a<br>
pleasant chewability which remains unchanged throughout<br>
the chewing period without hardening like most<br>
conventional chewing gums.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Examples of chewing gums in compressed form produced by<br>
direct compression of mixtures in powder form have been<br>
known in the art for several years and various types<br>
are available commercially. However, the compressed-<br>
powder gums which are currently available are<br>
unpleasant to chew because to avoid technical<br>
difficulties in the production process they have been<br>
produced from hardbasic gums. It is in fact known that<br>
it is much easier to grind and compress hard and dry<br>
materials and that the compression of powders is more<br>
complex the softer they are; up to now, the need to<br>
have starting mixtures or materials which are<br>
sufficiently hard or dry to be granulated and<br>
compressed easily has led to the production of chewing<br>
gums which are hard and friable, with the risk of some<br>
of the gum accidentally being swallowed.<br>
Various chewing gums produced by the compression of<br>
powdered ingredients are described in the literature.<br>
As early as 1942, United States patent US-2,290,120<br>
described, for example, the preparation of chewing gums<br>
by cold grinding of basic gum and glucose syrup (at<br>
about -2 0°C) and subsequent mixing and compression<br>
thereof; however, the basic gums used in this patent<br>
contain natural gums which, owing to their known<br>
limitations with regard to performance, quality of<br>
supply, and technical problems of use, have now been<br>
almost completely abandoned and replaced by other,<br>
synthetic ingredients.<br>
United States patent US-4,753,805 describes the<br>
granulation and subsequent compression of a chewing-gum<br>
composition having a moisture percentage of between 2<br>
and 8%, with the use of various technological<br>
coadjuvants such as anti-agglutination agents and<br>
granulation coadjuvants (alkali-metal phosphates,<br>
alkaline-earth metal phosphates, maltodextrins, or<br>
mixtures thereof).<br>
European patent EP-0221850 describes chewing-gum<br>
formulations which are suitable for being formed into<br>
tablets and which are produced by mixing the basic gum<br>
with dry ingredients, including the aromatic portion,<br>
without the plasticization due to the oils of the<br>
flavourings, subsequent cooling of the mixture to above<br>
the freezing point of water (5-10°C), dry granulation,<br>
and compression.<br>
United States patent US-4,000,321 describes a chewing<br>
gum with characteristics of softness during chewing and<br>
light weight. This result is achieved by cold<br>
granulation of a chewing-gum mixture, following by<br>
spontaneous adhesion by heating of the granulate. A<br>
chewing gum which contains bubbles and which cannot be<br>
mixed with other ingredients is thus obtained.<br>
WO 99/2503 describes a process which provides for the<br>
preparation of a chewing-gum mass in powder form in<br>
which the basic gum is cooled to a temperature of<br>
between 0 and -35 °C; the mass thus cooled is then<br>
granulated, supplemented with the necessary additives<br>
and active ingredients, and then compressed.<br>
United States patent US-4,588,592 describes a method of<br>
preparing chewing gums containing from 70 to 95% by<br>
weight of granulated sugar. The granulated sugar,<br>
previously heated to a temperature of between 51 and<br>
93°C, is mixed with the basic gum at a temperature of<br>
between 54 and 121°C. The product thus obtained can<br>
then be used as it is or transformed into a granular<br>
product, after cooling to a temperature of between -6<br>
and -40°C.<br>
US-4,161,544 describes a method of preparing chewing<br>
gum which provides for sugars to be mixed with a basic<br>
gum, heated to a temperature of 60-12 0°C; the<br>
temperature is then reduced to between 3 0 and -5°C and<br>
the mass thus obtained is granulated. The method in<br>
question provides for the use of "bulking agents" such<br>
as gum arabic, pectin, or other similar additives; as<br>
is well known, these ingredients are soluble in water<br>
and, as such, will be ingested after brief chewing,<br>
together with the sugars, thus leaving a bolus of<br>
harder consistency; the object proposed is thus<br>
achieved only partially, providing chewing which is<br>
extremely variable over time.<br>
Finally, International patent application WO 01/19206<br>
describes a particularly laborious method of preparing<br>
chewing gum, requiring a pretreatment of the basic gum<br>
mixture which is reduced to pellets of relatively small<br>
particles which in turn are then cooled to extremely<br>
low temperatures, i.e. below -40°C, by the addition of<br>
dry ice. Even when operation takes place in special,<br>
greatly dehumidified environments (with consequent<br>
greater economic expense and reduced practicality),<br>
this selection easily leads to the formation and<br>
accumulation of condensation on the dry ice intimately<br>
mixed with the gum composition, with the formation of<br>
lumps and agglutinations.<br>
As mentioned above, however, the methods described in<br>
the above-mentioned patent documents have considerable<br>
drawbacks such as, for example, the production of<br>
chewing gum with poor chewability.<br>
DESCRIPTION OP THE INVENTION<br>
A method has now been discovered which permits the<br>
production of a chewing gum in powder form which is<br>
transformed, simply by compression, into a gum tablet<br>
with chewability and softness characteristics similar<br>
to or better than those of good-quality,<br>
conventionally-produced chewing gums, particularly with<br>
regard to optimal palatability throughout the chewing<br>
period.<br>
A further advantage of the present invention is the<br>
ability to produce' pharmaceutical or medicated chewing<br>
gums containing one or more active ingredients which<br>
are sensitive to heat; in fact, in contrast with<br>
conventional techniques, the mixing of the gum in<br>
powder form with the active ingredients and its<br>
subsequent transformation into the finished product<br>
does not require heating.<br>
Another advantage offered by the process of the present<br>
invention is that it allows to produce a chewing gum in<br>
various forms and shapes other than the conventional<br>
ones, including tablets and micropellets of less than<br>
0.8 grams (which would be very hard to produce with<br>
traditional means) simply by replacing the punches in a<br>
press.<br>
A method for manufacturing miniature chewing gums is<br>
disclosed in WO 02/094032, filed by Wrigley, and it is<br>
substantially based in the extrusion of the chewing gum<br>
in the liquid filled chamber of a so-called "underwater<br>
pellettizer", as for instance that manufactured by Gala<br>
Industries and disclosed in WO 01/2137.<br>
The method according to WO 02/094032 presents however a<br>
drawback which cannot be neglected: due to the<br>
technical characteristics of the underwater<br>
pellettizer, the amount of bulk sweetener in the<br>
chewing gum must be kept quite low; consequently, in<br>
case a sweet chewing gum is desired, the gum center<br>
extruded by the underwater pellettizer has to be<br>
surrounded by a coating which comprises at least 50% by<br>
weight of the coated chewing gum and which contains the<br>
necessary amount of bulk sweetener, as for instance<br>
disclosed in WO 02/094032, also filed by Wrigley.<br>
On the contrary, the method according to the present<br>
invention permits to manufacture micropellet chewing<br>
gums independently of the amount of bulk sweetener<br>
requested.<br>
Another advantage which will become clear from the<br>
following description is that the chewing-gum<br>
formulation in powder form can be packaged, dispatched,<br>
and preserved, even for prolonged periods of time,<br>
without losing its properties, in fact remaining<br>
completely in the granulated state.<br>
Finally, another advantage offered by the present<br>
invention is that it is possible to produce a chewing<br>
gum in various forms other than the conventional forms<br>
and shapes, simply by replacing the punches in a tablet<br>
press.<br>
In contrast with the prior art described in the<br>
literature, in order to prepare the powdered chewing-<br>
gum mixture, it is not necessary to use exclusively dry<br>
ingredients or to mix frozen ingredients in powder form<br>
without liquid ingredients or other forms of<br>
plasticization such as, for example, liquid<br>
flavourings, to avoid softening the mixture.. In fact,<br>
one of the main characteristics of the present<br>
invention is the fact that it is possible to operate<br>
initially in accordance with the usual preparation<br>
method which is used for the preparation of<br>
conventional chewing gums (that is, those which are' not<br>
in powder form).<br>
Moreover, the method according to the present invention<br>
can be implemented without the aid of granulation<br>
coadjuvants such as, for example, alkali-metal<br>
phosphates, alkaline-earth metal phosphates,<br>
maltodextrins, or mixtures thereof, and/or without the<br>
aid of "bulking agents" such as, for example, gum<br>
arablc or pectin.<br>
Another advantage of the following preparation method<br>
consists in the complete use and recovery of the<br>
product which thus permits an absence of processing<br>
losses or waste.<br>
One of the elements which characterize the present<br>
invention is the use of "soft" basic gums which give<br>
rise to products having a pleasant chewing profile,<br>
comparable with, if not better than, that of<br>
conventional products. It has in fact been discovered<br>
that, in contrast with the prior art, it is possible to<br>
produce complete chewing-gum mixtures in powder form,<br>
ready to be compressed and thus also comprising the<br>
flavouring portion in the desired percentage, with the<br>
use of soft starting basic gums.<br>
The method for the production of chewing gum in powder<br>
form according to the present invention is<br>
characterized in that it comprises the following steps:<br>
a) mixing of a soft basic gum, i.e. a gum base, with at<br>
least one sweetener and, optionally, at least one other<br>
typical chewing-gum ingredient, at a temperature of<br>
between about 35 and 75°C,<br>
b) cooling of the mixture thus obtained to a<br>
temperature of between about 0 and -4 0°C and,<br>
preferably, between -10 and -40°C,<br>
c) grinding and subsequent screening of the mixture<br>
thus obtained to a particle size of less than about 10<br>
mesh,<br>
d) optional mixing of the powder thus obtained with at<br>
least one anti-agglutination agent,<br>
e) optional compression of the mixture thus obtained.<br>
The mixing (step a) is preferably performed at a<br>
temperature of between about 4 0 and 50°C for a period<br>
of about 10-3 0 minutes, preferably 2 0 minutes.<br>
The grinding (step c) is preferably performed until<br>
particles having a size of less than about 10 mesh and<br>
preferably less than 14 mesh are obtained.<br>
Within the scope of the present invention, "soft basic<br>
gum" is intended to define a basic gum characterized by<br>
a penetration index, in 1/10 mm, which is greater than<br>
about 15 and, preferably, greater than 18 (measured in<br>
accordance with the "Standard method for Needle<br>
Penetration of Petroleum Waxes", ASTM D1321-97).<br>
In particular, the soft basic gum preferably used for<br>
the implementation of the present invention will have<br>
the following qualitative/quantitative composition:<br>
from about 8 to 16% of one of more elastomers,<br>
preferably selected from the group comprising<br>
polyisobutylene, isobutylene/isoprene copolymer, and<br>
vinyl acetate/vinyl laurate copolymer,<br>
- from about 12 to 19% of polyvinyl acetate,<br>
from about 14 to 3 0% of resin preferably to be<br>
selected from the group comprising vegetable resin<br>
esters, resins produced by synthesis, and/or terpene<br>
resins,<br>
- from about 10 to 22% of hydrogenated or partially<br>
hydrogenated vegetable oils,<br>
- from about 0 to 7% of waxes selected from the group<br>
comprising vegetable waxes, waxes derived from<br>
petroleum, and/or synthetic waxes,<br>
- from about 5 to 9% of emulsifiers and technological<br>
assistants, more precisely, but not exclusively,<br>
glycerol monostearate, acetylated monoglycerides,<br>
lecithin, sugar esters and triacetin,<br>
- from about 15 to 40% of inert mineral fillers,<br>
- up to about 0.1% of antioxidants.<br>
The soft basic gum may be mixed in the usual manner<br>
with one or more polyols or with sugar, with or without<br>
the presence of polyol syrups or glucose syrup, with or<br>
without the presence of intensive sweeteners, and with<br>
or without the presence of liquid flavourings and other<br>
additives such as food acids, softeners, etc.<br>
The selection of the specific ingredients does not<br>
alter the principle of the invention and is appropriate<br>
for the use of the product, particularly when the gum<br>
mixture in powder form is marketed as such and the<br>
purchaser intends to enrich it with further flavourings<br>
in powder form, intensive sweeteners, or dietary,<br>
functional, pharmaceutical, or cosmetic active<br>
ingredients, before forming tablets.<br>
If the sweeteners and the other typical chewing-gum<br>
ingredients usable in step a) of the present invention<br>
are used in the solid state, they normally have a<br>
particle size of less than 200 µm and preferably less<br>
than 150 urn.<br>
The term "typical chewing-gum ingredients" is intended<br>
to define intensive sweeteners, flavourings and other<br>
additives. In particular intensive sweeteners<br>
typically used are aspartame, acesulfame and salts and<br>
derivatives thereof, saccharine, neohesperidin<br>
dihydrochalcone, sucralose, neotame, thaumatine,<br>
monelline etc. The term "flavourings" is intended to<br>
define any mixture of natural or synthetic aromatic<br>
oils or of individual active flavouring ingredients,<br>
taken individually or in combination, refreshing<br>
substances, etc., in solution or carried by a suitable<br>
vehicle by means of one or more of the known<br>
techniques.<br>
The additives usable in the present invention are all<br>
of those commonly used in the production of<br>
conventional chewing gum and thus comprise colorants,<br>
food acids, softeners, flavourings, etc.<br>
As is known in the art, the basic gum may be mixed with<br>
the use of preheated gum or gum at ambient temperature,<br>
according to its format, i.e., the use of 8-10 kg<br>
blocks of basic gum in fact requires preheating which<br>
is not necessary for formats which can be metered in<br>
pellets or drops. The basic gum is thus mixed with the<br>
ingredients selected as described above at a<br>
conventional temperature of between 35 and 75°C, most<br>
preferably between 40 and 55°C, for a period of time of<br>
between 10 and 3 0 minutes, with the use of one of the<br>
techniques known in the art. Upon completion of this<br>
mixing, the mixture is discharged and conditioned at a<br>
temperature of between -40 and 0°C. In particular it<br>
is possible to operate discontinuously with prolonged<br>
cooling to temperatures between -30 and 0°C and,<br>
preferably between -15 and -25°C; alternatively, it is<br>
possible to use methods which ensure continuous cooling<br>
to temperatures of between -40 and -10°C.<br>
The mixture is then ground by means of a blade mill. A<br>
percentage of the mass will be obtained with a<br>
satisfactory particle size straight away, whereas the<br>
portion with a particle-size greater than that desired<br>
is subsequently ground in a mill, optionally cooled to<br>
a temperature of between -40 and 0°C, and then<br>
recycled, thus achieving a 100% yield. Should it also<br>
be necessary to have a lower particle-size limit, the<br>
portion separated can be entirely reprocessed, thus<br>
also permitting complete recovery of the product in<br>
this case; the powder thus obtained preferably has a<br>
particle size greater than 100 mesh and, even more<br>
preferably, greater than 80 mesh.<br>
Anti-agglutination agents such as, for example, metal<br>
salts of fatty acids, precipitated silica, sugar<br>
esters, polyols of the type most suitable for<br>
compression, for example, isomalt and xylitol, are<br>
added to the powder thus obtained.<br>
Additionally one or more intensive sweeteners such as<br>
aspartame, acesulfame and salts and derivatives<br>
thereof, saccharine, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone,<br>
sucralose, neotame, thaumatine, monelline etc.,<br>
aromatic active ingredients or flavourings in powder<br>
form or carried by encapsulation etc., food acids, or<br>
other additives with specific functional and<br>
pharmaceutical or nutritional active ingredients such<br>
as vitamins, amino-acids, polypeptides or other<br>
substances with functional or cosmetic activity may<br>
also be added at this stage.<br>
The chewing-gum mixture in powder form thus obtained<br>
has the advantage that it can be used directly or can<br>
be packaged, stored and dispatched to a purchaser who<br>
can thus simply proceed with tablet-forming, possibly<br>
preceding this operation with an additional mixing with<br>
further flavourings in, powder form, encapsulated<br>
flavourings etc., and/or dietary, functional,<br>
pharmaceutical or cosmetic active ingredients, as<br>
required. The pharmaceutical industry is in fact not<br>
normally equipped with the machinery used for<br>
processing chewing gums, and can give form and<br>
consistency to the finished product solely by<br>
compression of a powder. Up to now, these limitations<br>
have led to an underestimation of the potentialities of<br>
chewing gum as a release vehicle.<br>
The final stage of the processing consists in forming<br>
into tablets or pills in a very wide selection of<br>
formats and dimensions by a tablet or a pill press or a<br>
tablet-forming machine; the tablets or pills thus<br>
obtained may therefore be packaged straight away in the<br>
desired format, i.e. in blister packs,, sticks,, etc. or<br>
sugar-coated, optionally also incorporating one or more<br>
flavourings, sweeteners and active ingredients in the<br>
coating, and then packaged.<br>
A particular embodyment of the present invention is<br>
represented by chewing gums obtained by coating<br>
micropellets obtainable through the described process.<br>
Such coated micropellet chewing gums having a gum<br>
center surrounded by a coating and a total weight of<br>
less than 1.2 grams, preferably less than 0., 8 grams,<br>
even more preferably less than 0.5 grams and/or a<br>
diameter lower than 10mm, preferably lower than 3mm.<br>
The coating will essentially consist of bulk sweeteners<br>
and it may comprise up to about 55%, preferably up to<br>
45% by weight of the coated chewing gum; more than<br>
about 80% by weight of the preferred coating will<br>
normally consist of bulk sweeteners, more preferably<br>
from 85 to 95%.<br>
The micropellets used as gum centers will normally<br>
contain from about 60 to 90% by weight of basic gum and<br>
from about 5 to 2 5% by weight of bulk sweeteners,<br>
preferably from 10 to 20% of bulk sweeteners, together<br>
with customary ingredients (such as intensive<br>
sweeteners, flavourings, anti agglutination agents and<br>
vegetable extracts). A preferred embodiment of the gum<br>
center which can be used for manufacturing ~ the<br>
micropellet chewing gums according to the invention is<br>
disclosed in example 10 (and table 3).<br>
Further aspects of the invention will become clear from<br>
the following experimental and comparative sections<br>
which should not, however, be considered as limiting of<br>
the invention.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL SECTION<br>
Example 1<br>
The following description refers to the preparation of<br>
a gum in powder form having the qualitative composition<br>
given in Example 1 in Table 1.<br>
Initially, 29.3 parts by weight, which was the entire<br>
quantity of basic gum, was mixed, in a sigma mixer,<br>
heated to a temperature of between 4 0 and 50°C, with<br>
13.47 parts of sorbitol in powder form, which was one<br>
third of the sorbitol quantity, and with 6.7 parts of<br>
mannitol. After a few minutes, a second portion of<br>
sorbitol in powder form, again of one third of the<br>
total was added, together with 0.4 parts of intensive<br>
sweeteners, mixing was continued for a few minutes, and<br>
the remaining sorbitol was then added, together with<br>
2.2 parts selected from flavourings in liquid and<br>
powder form, homogenization of the mixture being<br>
continued for a further few minutes.<br>
It is useful to point out that the quantity of<br>
flavouring which is in powder form could also be added<br>
after grinding.<br>
10-3 0 minutes after the start of the mixing, the<br>
mixture thus obtained was discharged and left to<br>
condition at a temperature of about -2 0°C.<br>
After a period of about 24 hours, the chewing-gum<br>
mixture thus treated was ground in a blade mill with a<br>
4 mm2 grating and the ground material was screened.<br>
After screening, a mixture which had a particle size of<br>
less than 10 mesh and 60% of which had a particle size<br>
of less than 14 mesh was obtained.<br>
3.5 parts of anti-agglutination mixture and 17.5 parts<br>
of isomalt of the type commonly marketed for<br>
applications in the tablet-forming field were added to<br>
79 parts of the chewing-gum mixture in powder form thus<br>
obtained.' The chewing-gum mixture in powder form was<br>
then compressed.<br>
The method described above may also be applied to the<br>
preparation of gums in powder form having a composition<br>
other than that of Example 1, such as the compositions<br>
of Examples 2-8 of Tables 1 and 2.<br>
Example 6<br>
The following description refers to the preparation of<br>
a gum in powder form having the qualitative composition<br>
given in Example 6 in Table 2. In the first step, 27<br>
parts of soft basic gum, 3 6.8 parts of sorbitol, 5.3<br>
parts of mannitol, 8.8 parts of isomalt, 2.3 parts of<br>
sorbitol syrup, 0.3 parts of intensive sweetener, 0.3<br>
parts of liquid flavouring, and 0.2 parts of additive<br>
were mixed by methods similar to those described in the<br>
preceding example. In this example, the term<br>
"additives" means a plasticizer selected from those<br>
commonly used in chewing gum, in view of the low<br>
percentage of liquid flavouring used.<br>
The mixture was discharged, conditioned, ground and, in<br>
the final step, 3 parts of anti-agglutination mixture<br>
and 16 parts of vegetable extracts were added to 81<br>
parts of the mixture in powder form thus obtained. The<br>
chewing-gum mixture thus obtained could then be<br>
compressed.<br>
Example 8<br>
The following description refers to the preparation of<br>
a gum in powder form having the qualitative composition<br>
given in Example 8 in Table 2. A method similar to<br>
that of the preceding example was used but, in this<br>
example, the quota of isomalt, which was equal to 21.5<br>
parts, was composed of 6.5 parts of conventional<br>
isomalt for chewing gum, which was added in the first<br>
mixing step, and by 15 parts of isomalt of a type<br>
suitable for compression, which was added to the<br>
mixture in powder form, in the second step.<br>
Example 10<br>
The following description refers to the preparation of<br>
a gum in powder form having a quantitative composition<br>
given in Example 10 in (Table 3) . A method similar to<br>
that of previous examples was used. Chewing gums<br>
obtained under this example are particularly suited to<br>
be coated in order to obtain products with a weight<br>
lower than 1.2 grams, preferably lower than 0.8 grams,<br>
even more prefereably less than 0.5 grams. It is worth<br>
of note that the softness characteristics of the basic<br>
gum are such that the chewing gum tablets thus obtain<br>
have pleasant chewing properties substantially<br>
identical to that of conventional chewing gums also<br>
when using high percentages of gum base.<br>
The preferred coating for surrounding the compressed<br>
chewing gum obtained according to the present example<br>
will have the following by weight composition:<br>
- Intensive sweetener 1.4 %<br>
- Flavour 3.5 %<br>
- Colour (preferably TiO2) 1.6 %<br>
- Bulk sweetener (preferably maltitol) 87.5 %<br>
- Other additives (preferably arabic gum) 6.0 %<br>
Total 100.0 %<br>
According to requirements, it is thus possible to add<br>
one or more intensive sweeteners such as aspartame,<br>
acesulfame and salts and derivatives thereof,<br>
saccharine, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, sucralose,<br>
etc., aromatic active ingredients or flavourings in<br>
powder form or carried by encapsulation, etc., food<br>
acids, or other additives with specific functions, and<br>
pharmaceutical active ingredients or nutritional active<br>
ingredients such as vitamins, amino-acids,<br>
polypeptides, or other substances with functional or<br>
cosmetic activity.<br>
Naturally, the addition of flavourings, encapsulated or<br>
otherwise carried, and the addition of heat-sensitive<br>
active ingredients takes place after the grinding in<br>
the stabilization step carried out with the use of one<br>
or more anti-agglutination agents known in the art and<br>
commonly used for this purpose, such as, for example,<br>
magnesium stearate, silica, talc, polyols of the type<br>
most suitable for compression, for example, isomalt,<br>
xylitol, etc.<br>
After being formed into tablets or pills, the chewing<br>
gum thus obtained can thus also be sugar-coated as a<br>
normal chewing-gum or confectionery product, including<br>
intensive sweeteners, flavourings and active<br>
ingredients as described above in the coating.<br>
COMPARATIVE SECTION<br>
Despite constant attempts to apply instrument-based<br>
assessment methods to the study of chewing gum and the<br>
identification of its properties, the determining<br>
factor in the assessment of the chewing properties of a<br>
chewing gum is still subjective assessment by the<br>
chewer. The typical chewing sensation in fact includes<br>
the perception, prolonged over time, of odour, flavour,<br>
taste, colour, consistency, palatability and<br>
aftertaste.<br>
Although qualitative and quantitative analytical<br>
methods exist for establishing the residual content of<br>
flavouring, active ingredients, and sweeteners or sugar<br>
in a chewing gum at a specific moment during chewing,<br>
there is not yet a method of assessing the perception<br>
of the pleasantness of the release of the flavouring<br>
and of the sweetness or the duration of both.<br>
There are also objective parameters which may enable<br>
individual properties of the chewing gum to be assessed<br>
but, at the moment, there is no technique which is<br>
sufficiently sophisticated and complete to assess the<br>
combination of chewing properties defined as a whole in<br>
English as "mouth feel", which consists of a perception<br>
of various factors such as softness, resilience,<br>
slipperiness, and consistency of the bolus, which<br>
constitute the palatability of a chewing gum.<br>
In order to assess the innovative aspects of the<br>
present invention, sensory assessment by a panel of<br>
chewers was therefore used and, in parallel, at least<br>
one significant parameter was assessed by performing a<br>
test measurement by means of a penetrometer.<br>
The sensory assessment of the performance of a chewing<br>
gum and of the basic gum used to prepare it is<br>
generally based on three consecutive stages, referred<br>
to as (a) the first biting or chewing stage, (b) the<br>
intermediate biting or chewing stage, and (c) the final<br>
biting or chewing stage. To look at the assessment of<br>
a gum in greater detail, the first stage (a) or "first<br>
bite" corresponds to the first seconds of chewing in<br>
which the chewing gum is placed in the mouth and bitten<br>
into. At this stage, the chewing gum should respond to<br>
quite precise requirements such as the correct degree<br>
of compliance under the teeth, and should avoid<br>
breaking up into minute parts which might even<br>
involuntarily be ingested, which typically occurs with<br>
commercially-available compressed chewing gums. At the<br>
same time, however, in order for chewing to be pleasant<br>
from the very first moments, the chewing gum should not<br>
be particularly hard or stiff, which is another<br>
property that is lacking in currently available<br>
products of this type.<br>
The second stage (b), known as the "intermediate"<br>
stage, is of longer duration and corresponds, to the<br>
period of 30-60 seconds during which most of the sugar<br>
or sweeteners go into solution owing to the effect of<br>
the saliva and the product simultaneously releases most<br>
of the flavour. In this stage, it is particularly<br>
important for chewing to be uniform, in other words,<br>
for the physical drop in consistency due to the<br>
dissolving to be slight and not too noticeable, thus<br>
maintaining so-called "linear" behaviour.<br>
The third or "final" stage (c) starts about one minute<br>
after the start of chewing and continues throughout the<br>
remaining time for which the gum is chewed. After most<br>
of the sugar or sweeteners have dissolved, a flavouring<br>
portion and a residue of sugars are still present and<br>
the gum is partially hydrated. During this stage, the<br>
characteristics of the basic gum are fundamental since<br>
it represents almost the whole of the residual bolus.<br>
With gums of a particular firmness which are used<br>
because they are more easily broken up, even if the<br>
intrinsic hardness is not perceived in the first two<br>
stages, possibly by virtue of some expedients, it will<br>
inevitably become apparent at this stage, rendering<br>
chewing difficult and unpleasant and, as such, not at<br>
all appealing.<br>
Amongst the various parameters indicative of the<br>
performance of a chewing gum which can be measured<br>
objectively, that which relates to the chewing stage<br>
(a) or "first bite" is certainly indicative, though not<br>
exhaustively, of the quality of the product. The force<br>
necessary for a tooth initially to penetrate a sugar-<br>
coated pill or a tablet is in fact proportional to the<br>
hardness of the pill or tablet and can therefore give a<br>
measurement of how pleasant chewing may be. For<br>
tablets, hardness is proportional to friability and to<br>
the tendency to crumble during the first bites. The<br>
harder the product is, and hence the easier it is to<br>
grind and compress, the more marked will be its<br>
tendency to break up into minute bits which might even<br>
be ingested involuntarily. To demonstrate this, some<br>
measurements have been made on commercially-available<br>
products, experimental test pieces, and samples<br>
available commercially at trade fairs, with the use of<br>
a penetrometer (Sommer &amp; Runge KG, Berlin) which is<br>
commonly used in the industry for assessing the<br>
hardness of plastic materials such as waxes which, as<br>
is well known, are also ingredients used in the<br>
preparation of the basic gum.<br>
The measurements made, which were performed in parallel<br>
with sensory assessments, gave results indicative of<br>
the superior chewing characteristics of the samples<br>
produced in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Table 4 gives the results obtained for two commercial<br>
products, indicated as brand A and brand B,<br>
respectively, a product distributed at a trade fair,<br>
indicated as brand C, and two samples produced in<br>
accordance with the present invention.<br>
*: The products indicated as BRAND A, B and C are<br>
compressed powder chewing gums corresponding respectively<br>
to:<br>
BRAND A: Golnatur Propol-young, "Gum Tech"®, lemon taste<br>
marketed by D. ULRICH SpA, Torino.<br>
BRAND B: "Vitermine vitamine erbe e minerali Gola", mint<br>
taste, marketed by GUABER, Funo, Italia.<br>
BRAND C: Compressed chewing gum tablets made with Satin® I<br>
gum base manufactured by L.A. Dreyfus Company.<br>
As can be seen, the experimental measurement confirms<br>
the judgement with regard to the sensory assessment of<br>
the specific parameter.<br>
The performance claimed in the present invention is<br>
achieved with the use of "soft" gums which give rise to<br>
products with a pleasant chewing profile .which is<br>
comparable with, if not better than, that of<br>
conventional products.<br>
It is important to stress that the values given above<br>
are significant only to the above examples and<br>
variations in the composition of the basic gum may lead<br>
to appreciably different results. Although basic gums<br>
having formulations other than that given above are<br>
used conventionally for the preparation of high-quality<br>
chewing-gum products by conventional methods in<br>
conventional formats, i.e., sticks, or dragèea, they do<br>
not have the characteristics of softness possessed by-<br>
basic gums with the formulation given above.<br>
In particular, it can easily be shown that high-quality<br>
basic gums in which only two of the categories of<br>
ingredients indicated above differ from those of the<br>
gums of the present invention have clearly different<br>
characteristics in terms of softness. Two basic gums,<br>
identified as gum 1 and gum 2, given by way of example<br>
in Table 5, have the following differences in<br>
comparison with the formulation described above.<br>
To confirm what has been stated and the difference<br>
described, a test measurement by penetrometer was also<br>
used in this case to assess the consistency and<br>
hardness of the basic gum samples, by comparing the two<br>
samples described above with a third identified as: gum<br>
3 which had a formulation corresponding to that<br>
described above. The results are given in Table 6.<br>
A further parameter commonly used by the industry to<br>
characterize a basic gum is the softening point. This<br>
measurement, which is performed by the so-called "ring<br>
&amp; ball" technique, provides for the measurement of the<br>
initial softening temperature of the basic gum and the<br>
temperature at which it actually passes through, with<br>
the use of a standard body, once the softening point is<br>
reached. Two temperatures and the respective interval<br>
are thus obtained and provide extremely useful<br>
information on the characteristics of the gum. In the<br>
specific case of the gums given by way of example, the<br>
temperatures measured are given in Table 7.<br>
It is clear from the data set out above that the<br>
difference between the examples, gum 1 and gum 2, on<br>
the one hand and gum 3, on the other, is not only in<br>
the macroscopic difference in the absolute values of<br>
the softening temperatures which would themselves be a<br>
significant indicator; in fact, the extent of the<br>
softening interval is also in direct correlation with<br>
the characteristics of greater plasticity and softness<br>
in gum 3 in comparison with the greater stiffness of<br>
gum 1 and gum 2.<br>
It is thus clear that the use of a soft basic gum is a<br>
particularly important parameter for the production of<br>
chewing gums in powder form which have palatability<br>
characteristics comparable with, if not better than,<br>
those of conventional chewing gums.<br>
