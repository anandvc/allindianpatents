				<td>CASPASE INHIBITORS AND USES THEREOF<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is in the field of medicinal<br>
chemistry and relates to novel compounds, and<br>
pharmaceutical compositions thereof, that inhibit<br>
caspases that mediate cell apoptosis and inflammation.<br>
The invention also relates to methods of using the<br>
compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention to treat diseases where caspase activity is<br>
implicated.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a<br>
principal mechanism by which organisms eliminate unwanted<br>
cells. The deregulation of apoptosis, either excessive<br>
apoptosis or the failure to undergo it, has been<br>
implicated in a number of diseases such as cancer, acute<br>
inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, ischemic diseases<br>
and certain neurodegenerative disorders (see generally<br>
Science, 1998, 281, 1283-1312; Ellis et al., Ann. Rev.<br>
Cell. Biol., 1991, 7, 663).<br>
Caspases are a family of cysteine protease<br>
enzymes that are key mediators in the signaling pathways<br>
for apoptosis and cell disassembly (Thornberry, Chem.<br>
Biol., 1998, 5, R97-R103). These signaling pathways vary<br>
depending on cell type and stimulus, but all apoptosis<br>
pathways appear to converge at a common effector pathway<br>
leading to proteolysis of key proteins. Caspases are<br>
involved in both the effector phase of the signaling<br>
pathway and further upstream at its initiation. The<br>
upstream caspases involved in initiation events become<br>
activated and in turn activate other caspases that are<br>
involved in the later phases of apoptosis.<br>
Caspase-1, the first identified caspase, is<br>
also known as interleukin converting enzyme or "ICE."<br>
Caspase-1 converts precursor interleukin-lb ("pIL-lb") to<br>
the pro-inflammatory active form by specific cleavage of<br>
pIL-1b between Asp--116 and Ala-117. Besides caspase-1<br>
there are also eleven other known human caspases, all of<br>
which cleave specifically at aspartyl residues. They are<br>
also observed to have stringent requirements for at least<br>
four amino acid residues on the N-terminal side of the<br>
cleavage site.<br>
The caspases have been classified into three<br>
groups depending on the amino acid sequence that is<br>
preferred or primarily recognized. The group of caspases,<br>
which includes caspases 1, 4, 5 and 13, have been shown<br>
to prefer hydrophobic aromatic amino acids at position 4<br>
on the N-terminal side of the cleavage site. Another<br>
group which includes caspases 2, 3 and 7, recognize<br>
aspartyl residues at both positions 1 and 4 on the N-<br>
terminal side of the cleavage site, and preferably a<br>
sequence of Asp-Glu-X-Asp. A third group, which includes<br>
caspases 6, 8, 9 and 10, tolerate many amino acids in the<br>
primary recognition sequence, but seem to prefer residues<br>
with branched, aliphatic side chains such as valine and<br>
leucine at position 4.<br>
The caspases have also been grouped according<br>
to their perceived function. The first subfamily consists<br>
of caspases-1 (ICE), 4, 5 and 13. These caspases have<br>
been shown to be involved in pro-inflammatory cytokine<br>
processing and therefore play an important role in<br>
inflammation. Caspase-1, the most studied enzyme of this<br>
class, activates the IL-1b precursor by proteolytic<br>
cleavage. This enzyme therefore plays a key role in the<br>
inflammatory response. Caspase-1 is also involved in the<br>
processing of interferon-g inducing factor (IGIF) which<br>
stimulates the production of interferon gamma, a key<br>
immunoregulator that modulates antigen presentation, T-<br>
cell activation and cell adhesion.<br>
The remaining caspases make up the second and third<br>
subfamilies. These enzymes are of central importance in<br>
the intracellular signaling pathways leading to<br>
apoptosis. One subfamily consists of the enzymes<br>
involved in initiating events in the apoptotic pathway,<br>
including transduction of signals from the plasma<br>
membrane. Members of this subfamily include caspases-2,<br>
8, 9 and 10. The other subfamily, consisting of the<br>
effector capsases 3, 6 and 7, are involved in the final<br>
downstream cleavage events that result in the systematic<br>
breakdown and death of the cell by apoptosis. Caspases<br>
involved in the upstream signal transduction activate the<br>
downstream caspases, which then disable DNA repair<br>
mechanisms, fragment DNA, dismantle the cell cytoskeleton<br>
and finally fragment the cell.<br>
Knowledge of the four amino acid sequence<br>
primarily recognized by the caspases has been used to<br>
design caspase inhibitors. Reversible tetrapeptide<br>
inhibitors have been prepared having the structure<br>
CH3CO-[P4]-[p3]-tP2]-CH(R)CH2CO2H where P2 to P4 represent<br>
an optimal amino acid recognition sequence and R is an<br>
aldehyde, nitrile or ketone capable of binding to the<br>
caspase cysteine sulfhydryl. Rano and Thornberry, Chem.<br>
Biol. 4, 149-155 (1997); Mjalli, et al., Bioorg. Med.<br>
Chem. Lett. 3, 2689-2692 (1993); Nicholson et al., Nature<br>
376, 37-43 (1995) . Irreversible inhibitors based on the<br>
analogous tetrapeptide recognition sequence have been<br>
prepared where R is an acyloxymethylketone -COCH2OCOR'<br>
R' is exemplified by an optionally substituted phenyl<br>
such as 2, 6-dichlorobenzoyloxy and where R is COCH2X where<br>
X is a leaving group such as F or C1. Thornberry et al<br>
Biochemistry 33, 3934 (1994); Dolle et al., J Med. Chem.<br>
37, 563-564 (1994).<br>
The utility of caspase inhibitors to treat a<br>
variety of mammalian disease states associated with an<br>
increase in cellular apoptosis has been demonstrated<br>
using peptidic caspase inhibitors. For example, in<br>
rodent models caspase inhibitors have been shown to<br>
reduce infarct size and inhibit cardiomyocyte apoptosis<br>
after myocardial infarction, to reduce lesion volume and<br>
neurological deficit resulting from stroke, to reduce<br>
post-traumatic apoptosis and neurological deficit in<br>
traumatic brain injury, to be effective in treating<br>
fulminant liver destruction, and to improved survival<br>
after endotoxic shock. Yaoita et al., Circulation, 97,<br>
276 (1998); Endres et al., J Cerebral Blood Flow and<br>
Metabolism, 18, 238, (1998); Cheng et al., J. Clin.<br>
Invest., 101, 1992 (1998); Yakovlev et al., J<br>
Neuroscience, 17, 7415 (1997); Rodriquez et al., J. Exp.<br>
Med., 184, 2067 (1996); Grobmyer et al., Mol. Med., 5,<br>
585 (1999).<br>
In general, the peptidic inhibitors described<br>
above are very potent against some of the caspase<br>
enzymes. However, this potency has not always been<br>
reflected in cellular models of apoptosis. In addition<br>
peptide inhibitors are typically characterized by<br>
undesirable pharmacological properties such as poor oral<br>
absorption, poor stability and rapid metabolism. Plattner<br>
and Norbeck, in Drug Discovery Technologies, Clark and<br>
Moos, Eds. (Ellis Horwood, Chichester, England, 1990).<br>
Recognizing the need to improve the<br>
pharmacological properties of the peptidic caspase<br>
inhibitors, peptidomimetic inhibitors have been reported.<br>
Amongst these, inhibitors where the P3 amino acid has been<br>
replaced by derivatives of 3-aminopyridin-2-ones and 5-<br>
aminopyrimidin-4-ones have received much attention (US<br>
Patent 5,756,466 (Bemis et al.); Dolle et al. J. Med. Chem.<br>

2181, (1997); Semple et al, Biorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 7,<br>
1337, (1997)) leading to compounds of general structure:<br>

where R1 is hydrogen or various groups, R2 is hydrogen,<br>
methyl or ethyl, R3 is alkyl, phenyl or phenalkyl, and R4 is<br>
various groups.<br>
WO 98/16502 discloses aspartate ester inhibitors of<br>
20 interleukin-lB converting enzyme. WO 98/16505 discloses<br>
sulfonamide derivatives that inhibit interleukin-lB<br>
converting enzyme. WO 96/40647 discloses alpha-(1,3-<br>
dicarbonylenol ether) methyl ketones as cysteine protease<br>
inhibitors.<br>
25 Due to the inherent problems of the peptidic<br>
inhibitors, there continues to be a need for small<br>
molecule, nonpeptide caspase inhibitors that are potent,<br>
stable, and penetrate membranes to provide effective<br>
inhibition of apoptosis in vivo. Such compounds would be<br>
3 0 extremely useful in treating the aforementioned diseases<br>
where caspase enzymes play a role.<br>

OR, =NNHCOR, =NNHCO2R, =NNHSO2R, or =NR.<br>
A substitutable nitrogen on an aromatic or non-<br>
aromatic heterocyclic ring may be optionally substituted.<br>
Suitable substituents on the nitrogen include R, COR,<br>
S(O)2R, and CO2R, where R is an aliphatic group or a<br>
substituted aliphatic group.<br>
The term "electronegative leaving group" has<br>
the definition known to those skilled in the art (see<br>
March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th Edition, John Wiley<br>
&amp; Sons, 1992). Examples of electronegative leaving<br>
groups include halogens such as F, Cl, Br, I, - aryl and<br>
alkylsulfonyloxy groups, trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy.<br>
Isosteres or bioisosteres of carboxylic acids,<br>
esters and amides result from the exchange of an atom or<br>
group of atoms to create a new compound with similar<br>
biological properties to the parent carboxylic acid,<br>
ester or amide. The bioisosteric replacement may be<br>
physicochemically or topologically based. An example of<br>
an isosteric replacement for a carboxylic acid is<br>
CONHSO2(alkyl) such as CONHSO2Me.<br>
Compounds of this invention where R2 is COOH or<br>
CH2COOH are gamma {y = 1) or delta-ketoacids (y = 2) which<br>
may exist in solution as either the open form 1 or the<br>
cyclized hemiketal form 2. The representation herein of<br>
either isomeric form is meant to include the other.<br>
Likewise it will be apparent to one skilled in<br>
the art that certain compounds of this invention may<br>
exist in tautomeric forms or hydrated forms, all such<br>
forms of the compounds being within the scope of the<br>
invention. Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted<br>
herein are also meant to include all stereochemical forms<br>
of the structure; i.e., the R and S configurations for<br>
each asymmetric center. Therefore, single stereochemical<br>
isomers as well as enantiomeric and diastereomeric<br>
mixtures of the present compounds are within the scope of<br>
the invention. Unless otherwise stated, structures<br>
depicted herein are also meant to include compounds which<br>
differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically<br>
enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the<br>
present structures except for the replacement of a<br>
hydrogen by a deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of<br>
a carbon by a 13C- or 14C-enriched carbon are within the<br>
scope of this invention.<br>

The compounds of this invention may be prepared<br>
in general by methods known to those skilled in the art<br>
for analogous compounds, as illustrated by the general<br>
Schemes below and by the preparative examples that<br>
follow.<br>
Reagents: (a) NaH/THF; (b) NaOH/THF/H2O; (c)<br>
EDC/DMAP/HOBt; (d) Dess-Martin periodinane; (e) TFA/DCM<br>
In Scheme I above, the following abbreviations<br>
are used: EDC is 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-<br>
ethylcarbodiimide; HOBT is 1-hydroxybenzotriazole; TFA is<br>
trifluoroacetic acid; DCM is dichloromethane; and DMAP is<br>
4-dimethylaminopyridine. The starting heterocycle 1, is<br>
either commercially available or prepared by methods<br>
analogous to those described by Fuss and Koch, Synthesis<br>
(1990), 681-685, unless stated otherwise. Starting<br>
heterocycle 1 is treated first with sodium hydride, then<br>
with an ester 2 (LG is a leaving group such as bromine or<br>
O-triflate). The resulting ester 3 (e.g., Y = alkyl) is<br>
first hydrolized using base or, when Y is a t-butyl<br>
group, using trifluoroacetic acid. The acid 3 (Y = H) is<br>
then coupled with the amino alcohol 4. Depending on the<br>
nature of R1 and R2 an amino ketone may be used, in place<br>
of the amino alcohol, which avoids the subsequent<br>
oxidation step. In the case of fluoromethyl ketones<br>
where R1 is CH2F, the amino alcohol 4 may be obtained<br>
according to the method of Revesz et al., Tetrahedron<br>
Lett., 1994, 35, 9693. Finally the hydroxyl in compound<br>
5 is oxidized and the compound treated appropriately<br>
according to the nature of R2. For example, if the product<br>
I requires R2 to be a carboxylic acid, then R2 in 4 is<br>
preferably an ester and the final step in the scheme is<br>
hydrolysis.<br>
Accordingly, one aspect of this invention relates to a<br>
general method of preparing compounds of formula I<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
(a) providing an acid or acid derivative of formula<br>
II:<br>
(b) coupling II with an amino alcohol or amino<br>
ketone of formula 4 to provide an intermediate<br>
of formula III:<br>
(c) converting intermediate III to compound I,<br>
wherein Y is hydrogen or an organic radical; Z is =0 or<br>
OH; and ring A, R1, R2, R3, xl X2 and X3 are as described<br>
above.<br>
This method is particularly useful for .<br>
preparing chiral compounds of this invention, where the<br>
carbon bearing the R3 substituent is stereochemically<br>
enriched. As exemplified below (see Examples 21-27),<br>
intermediate acids or acid derivatives of formula II may<br>
be obtained in chiral form. This is illustrated herein<br>
for Ring A being a quinazolin-4-one (Examples 21-24, 26),<br>
a pyrimidin-4-one (Example 25) and a dihydroquinazoline-<br>
3-one (Example 27). The step (b) coupling of II and 4 to<br>
provide III may be carried out according to any suitable<br>
method. It is understood that when 4 is a ketone (Z =<br>
0) , it may need to be generated in the presence of II,<br>
for example, by in situ deprotection of the amino group.<br>
In step (c), the conversion of III to provide I will<br>
depend on the nature of Z and R2. Synthetic manipulation<br>
of these groups, if necessary, may be performed as<br>
decribed herein or according to other methods familiar to<br>
those skilled in the art.<br>
Certain chiral intermediates II, useful for<br>
making compounds of this invention, are novel. These<br>
intermediates are represented by pyrimidinones IIA and<br>
quinazolinones IIB:<br>
wherein Y is hydrogen or an organic radical, the<br>
pyrimidinone and quinazolinone rings are optionally<br>
substituted as described above for Ring A, and R3 is a C1-6<br>
alkyl group.<br>
Reagents: (a) Ethyl formate/diisopropylamine; (b)<br>
ArCOCl/THF; (c) PPh3/xylene; (d) TFA/DCM; (e)<br>
EDC/DMAP/HOBt; (f) Dess-Martin periodinane; (g) TFA/DCM<br>
In Scheme II above, the starting amino acid<br>
ester 6, which is commercially avaialable or synthesised<br>
under standard conditions, is first formylated and then<br>
treated with an 2-azido aromatic acid, activated for<br>
example as an acid chloride. The resulting amide 7, is<br>
treated with a reducing agent such as triphenyl phosphine<br>
and the resulting ester (e.g., Y = alkyl) is hydrolized<br>
using base or, when Y is a t-butyl group, using<br>
trifluoroacetic acid. The synthesis is then completed as<br>
outlined in Scheme I.<br>
Reagents: (a) EDC/DMAP/HOBt; (b) HCl/EtOAc; (c)<br>
(EtO)3CH/xylene; (d) EDC/DMAP/HOBt; (e) Dess-Martin<br>
periodinane; (f) TFA/DCM<br>
In Scheme III above, the starting amino acid<br>
ester 6, which is commercially avaialable or synthesised<br>
under known methods, is coupled with an unsaturated amino<br>
acid under standard conditions to provide amide 10. The<br>
amide 10 is deprotected (e.g., P = Boc) using acid<br>
conditions and the resulting amine heated with a<br>
formylating agent, eg triethylorthoformate. The<br>
intermediate then undergoes a thermal retro-Diels Alder<br>
reaction to provide 11.—The synthesis is then completed<br>
as outlined in Scheme I.<br>
Reagents: (a) Et3N/Et0H/18; (b) RaNi/H2/EtOH; (c) CDI/THF;<br>
(d) NaH/DMSO/15; (e) TFA/DCM; (f) 4/EDC/DMAP/HOBt; (g)<br>
Dess-Martin periodinane; (h) TFA/DCM<br>
In Scheme IV above, the starting amino acid<br>
ester 6 is alkylated with a benzyl group (where LG may be<br>
a halogen, tosylate, mesylate, triflate or the like) to<br>
provide 13. The nitro group in 13 is reduced (for<br>
example with Raney Nickel) and the diamine then cyclized<br>
onto a carbonyl source, (e.g. carbonyl diimidazole,<br>
"CDI") to provide quinazolone 14. The resulting free NH<br>
may be alkylated to provide compound 16. The synthesis<br>
is then completed as outlined in Scheme I.<br>

the resulting solution washed with water. The organic<br>
layer was discarded and the aqeous layer was acidified<br>
with concentrated HC1 then extracted several times with<br>
ethyl acetate. The combined organic extracts were dried<br>

The compounds utilized in the compositions and<br>
methods of this invention may also be modified by<br>
appending appropriate functionalities to enhance<br>
selective biological properties. Such modifications are<br>
known in the art and include those which increase<br>

According to a preferred embodiment, the<br>
compositions of this invention are formulated for<br>
pharmaceutical administration to a mammal, preferably a<br>
human being.<br>
Such pharmaceutical compositions of the present<br>
invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by<br>
"parenteral" as used herein includes subcutaneous,<br>
intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular,<br>
intra-synovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intrahepatic,<br>
intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion<br>
techniques. Prefexably, the compositions are<br>
administered orally or intravenously.<br>
Sterile injectable forms of the compositions of<br>
this invention may be aqueous or oleaginous suspension.<br>
These suspensions may be formulated according to<br>
techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or<br>
wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile<br>
injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable<br>
solution or suspension in a non-toxic<br>
parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example<br>
as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable<br>
vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water,<br>
Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution.<br>
In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally<br>
employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this<br>
purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including<br>
synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. Fatty acids, such as<br>
oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in<br>
the preparation of injectables, as are natural<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or<br>
castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated<br>
versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also<br>
contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, such<br>
as carboxymethyl cellulose or similar dispersing agents<br>
which are commonly used in the formulation of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms including<br>
emulsions and suspensions. Other commonly used<br>
surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and other emulsifying<br>
agents or bioavailability enhancers which are commonly<br>
used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
solid, liquid, or other dosage forms may also be used for<br>
the purposes of formulation.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be<br>
orally administered in any orally acceptable dosage form<br>
including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets, aqueous<br>
suspensions or solutions. In the case of tablets for<br>
oral use, carriers which are commonly used include<br>
lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as<br>
magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral<br>
administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include<br>
lactose and dried corn starch. When aqueous suspensions<br>
are"required for oral use, the active ingredient is<br>
combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If<br>
desired, certain sweetening, flavoring or coloring agents<br>
may also be added.<br>
Alternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions<br>
of this invention may be administered in the form of<br>
suppositories for rectal administration. These can be<br>
prepared by mixing the agent with a suitable<br>
non-irritating excipient which is solid at room<br>
temperature but liquid at rectal temperature and<br>
therefore will melt in the rectum to release the drug.<br>
Such materials include cocoa butter, beeswax and<br>
polyethylene glycols.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention may also be administered topically, especially<br>
when the target of treatment includes areas or organs<br>
readily accessible by topical application, including<br>
diseases of the eye, the skin, or the lower intestinal<br>
tract. Suitable topical formulations are readily<br>
prepared for each of these areas or organs.<br>
Topical application for the lower intestinal<br>
tract can be effected in a rectal suppository formulation<br>
(see above) or in a suitable enema formulation.<br>
Topically-transdermal patches may also be used.<br>
For topical applications, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions may be formulated in a suitable ointment<br>
containing the active component suspended or dissolved in<br>
one or more carriers. Carriers for topical<br>
administration of the compounds of this invention<br>
include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid<br>
petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol,<br>
polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying<br>
wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions can be formulated in a suitable lotion or<br>
cream containing the active components suspended or<br>
dissolved in one or more pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited<br>
to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60,<br>
cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol,<br>
benzyl alcohol and water.<br>
For ophthalmic use, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions may be formulated as micronized suspensions<br>
in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, or, preferably,<br>
as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline,<br>
either with our without a preservative such as<br>
benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, for ophthalmic<br>
uses, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated<br>
in an ointment such as petrolatum.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention may also be administered by nasal aerosol or<br>
inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to<br>
techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical<br>
formulation and mav be prepared as solutions in saline,<br>
employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives,<br>
absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability,<br>
fluorocarbons, and/or other conventional solubilizing or<br>
dispersing agents.<br>
The above-described compositions are<br>

compositions should be sufficient to cause a detectable<br>
decrease in the severity of the disease or in caspase<br>
activity and/or cell apoptosis, as measured by any of the<br>
assays described in the examples.<br>
According to another embodiment, the<br>
compositions of this invention may further comprise<br>
another therapeutic agent. Such agents include, but are<br>
not limited to, thrombolytic agents such as tissue<br>
plasminogen activator and streptokinase. When a second<br>
agent is used, the second agent may be administered<br>
either as a separate dosage form or as part of a single<br>
dosage form with the compounds or compositions of this<br>
invention.<br>
It should also be understood that a specific<br>
dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient<br>
will depend upon a variety of factors, including the<br>
activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body<br>
weight, general health, sex, diet, time of<br>
administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and<br>
the judgment of the treating physician and the severity<br>
of the particular disease being treated. The amount of<br>
active ingredients will also depend upon the particular<br>
compound and other therapeutic agent, if present, in the<br>
composition.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention<br>
provides a method of treating a mammal, having one of the<br>
aforementioned diseases, comprising the step of<br>
administering to said mammal a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable composition described above. In this<br>
embodiment, if the patient is also administered another<br>
therapeutic agent or caspase inhibitor, it may be<br>
delivered together with the compound of this invention in<br>
a "single dosage form, or,as a separate dosage form.<br>
When administered as a separate dosage form, the other<br>
caspase inhibitor or agent may be administered prior to,<br>
at the same time as, or following administration of a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a<br>
compound of this invention.<br>
In order that this invention be more fully<br>
understood, the following preparative and testing<br>
examples are set forth. These examples are for the<br>
purpose of illustration only and are not to be construed<br>
as limiting the scope of the invention in any way.<br>
Example 28<br>
Enzyme Assays<br>
The assays for caspase inhibition are based on<br>
the cleavage of a fluorogenic substrate by recombinant,<br>
purified human Caspases -1, -3, -7 or -8. The assays are<br>
run in essentially the same way as those reported by<br>
Garcia-Calvo et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 273 (1998), 32608-<br>
32613), using a substrate specific for each enzyme. The<br>
substrate for Caspase-1 is Acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-amino-<br>
4-methylcoumarin. The substrate for Caspases -3, -7 and -<br>
8 is Acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-amino-4-methylcoumarin.<br>
The observed rate of enzyme inactivation at a<br>
particular inhibitor concentration, kobs, is computed by<br>
direct fits of the data to the equation derived by<br>
Thornberry et al. (Biochemistry 33 (1994), 3943-3939)<br>
using a nonlinear least-squares analysis computer program<br>
(PRISM 2.0; GraphPad software). To obtain the second<br>
order rate constant, kinact, kobs values are plotted against<br>
their respective inhibitor concentrations and kinact values<br>
are subsequently calculated by computerized linear<br>
regression.<br>
Table 8 shows inhibition of caspase-1 activity<br>
for selected compounds of this invention as determined by<br>
the above method.<br>
Table 9 shows inhibition of caspase-3 activity for<br>
selected compounds of this invention as determined by the<br>
above method.<br>

Inhibition of IL-1b secretion from Mixed Population of<br>
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC)<br>
Processing of pre-IL-1b by caspase-1 can be<br>
measured in cell culture using a variety of cell sources.<br>
Human PBMC obtained from healthy donors provides a mixed<br>
population of lymphocyte and mononuclear cells that<br>
produce a spectrum of interleukins and cytokines in<br>
response to many classes of physiological stimulators.<br>
Experimental procedure<br>
The test compound is dissolved in dimethyl<br>
sulf oxide (DMSO, Sigma #D-2650) to give a 100 mM stock<br>
solution. This is diluted in complete medium consisting<br>
of RPMI containing 10% heat inactivated FCS (Gibco BRL<br>
#10099-141), 2mM L-Glutamine (Sigma, #G-7513), 100U<br>
penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma #P-7539).<br>
The final concentration range of test compound is from<br>
100 pM down to 6 nM over eight dilution steps. The<br>
highest concentration of test compound is equivalent to<br>
0.1% DMSO in the assay.<br>
Human PBMC are isolated from Buffy Coats<br>
obtained from the blood bank using centrifugation on<br>
Ficoll-Paque leukocyte separation medium (Amersham, #17-<br>
1440-02) and the cellular assay is performed in a sterile<br>
96 well flat-bottomed plate (Nunc). Each well contains<br>
100 m1 of the cell suspension, 1 x 105 cells, 50 ml of<br>
compound dilutions and 50 ml of LPS (Sigma #L-3012) at 50<br>
ng/ml final concentration. Controls consist of cells +/-<br>
LPS stimulation and a serial dilution of DMSO diluted in<br>
the same way as compound. The plates are incubated for<br>
5 16-18h at 37 °C in 5%CO2 &amp; 95% humidity atmosphere.<br>
After 16-18 h the supernatants are harvested<br>
after centrifuging the plates at 100 x g at 18°C for 15<br>
min and assayed for their IL-1b content. Measurement of<br>
mature IL-1b in the supernatant is performed using the<br>
10 Quantikine kits (R&amp;D Systems) according to manufacturer's<br>
instructions. Mature IL-1b levels of about 600-1500<br>
pg/ml are observed for PBMCs in positive control wells.<br>
The inhibitory potency of the compounds can be<br>
represented by an IC50 value, which is the concentration<br>
15 of inhibitor at which 50% of the mature IL-1b is detected<br>
in the supernatant as compared to the positive controls.<br>
Table 11 shows inhibition of IL-1b secretion from<br>
peripheral blood mononuclear cells for selected compounds<br>
of this invention as determined by the above methods.<br>
Example 30<br>
Anti-Fas Induced Apoptosis Assay<br>
Cellular apoptosis may be induced by the<br>
binding of Fas ligand (FasL) to its receptor, CD95 (Fas).<br>
CD95 is one of a family of related receptors, known as<br>
death receptors, which can trigger apoptosis in cells via<br>
activation of the caspase enzyme cascade. The process is<br>
initiated by the binding of the adapter molecule<br>
FADD/MORT-1 to the cytoplasmic domain of the CD-95<br>
receptor-ligand complex. Caspase-8 then binds FADD and<br>
becomes activated, initiating a cascade of events that<br>
involve the activation of downstream caspases and<br>
subsequent cellular apoptosis. Apoptosis can also be<br>
induced in cells expressing CD95 eg the Jurkat E6.1 T<br>
cell lymphoma cell line, using an antibody, rather than<br>
FasL, to crosslink the cell surface CD95.<br>
Anti-Fas-induced apoptosis is also triggered via the<br>
activation of caspase-8. This provides the basis of a<br>
cell based assay to screen compounds for inhibition of<br>
the caspase-8-mediated apoptotic pathway.<br>
Experimental Procedure<br>
Jurkat E6.1 cells are cultured in complete<br>
medium consisting of RPMI-1640 (Sigma No) + 10% foetal<br>
calf serum (Gibco BRL No. 10099-141) + 2mM L-glutamine<br>
(Sigma No. G-7513) . The cells are harvested in log phase<br>
of growth. 100ml Cells at 5-8x105 cells/ml are<br>
transferred to sterile 50ml Falcon centrifuge tubes and<br>
centrifuged for 5 minutes at 100xg at room temperature.<br>
The supernatant is removed and the combined cell pellets<br>
resuspended in 25ml of complete medium. The cells are<br>
counted and the density adjusted to 2xl06cells/ml with<br>
complete medium.<br>
The test compound is dissolved in dimethyl<br>
sulphoxide (DMSO) (Sigma No. D-2650) to give a 100mM stock<br>
solution. This is diluted to 400uM in complete medium,<br>
then serially diluted in a 96-well plate prior to<br>
addition to the cell assay plate.<br>
100ml of the cell suspension (2x106 cells) is<br>
added to each well of a sterile 96-well round-bottomed<br>
cluster plate (Costar No. 3790) . 50ml of compound<br>
solution at the appropriate dilution and 50ml of anti-Fas<br>
antibody, clone CH-11 (Kamiya No.MC-060) at a final<br>
concentration of lOng/ml, are added to the wells.<br>
Control wells are set up minus antibody and minus<br>
compound but with a serial dilution of DMSO as vehicle<br>
control. The plates are incubated for 16-18hrs at 37°C<br>
in 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.<br>
Apoptosis of the cells is measured by the<br>
quantitation of DNA fragmentation using a 'Cell Death<br>
Detection Assay' from Boehringer-Mannheim, No. 1544 675.<br>
After incubation for 16-18hrs the assay plates are<br>
centrifuged at 100xg at room temperature for 5.minutes.<br>
150ml of the supernatant are removed and replaced by<br>
150ul of fresh complete medium. The cells are then<br>
harvested and 200ul of the lysis buffer supplied in the<br>
assay kit are added to each well. The cells are<br>
triturated to ensure complete lysis and incubated for 30<br>
minutes at 4°C. The plates are then centrifuged at<br>
1900xg for 10 minutes and the supernatants diluted 1:20<br>
in the incubation buffer provided. 100ml of this<br>
solution is then assayed exactly according to the<br>
manufacturer's instructions supplied with the kit. OD405nm<br>
is measured 20 minutes after addition of the final<br>
substrate in a SPECTRAmax Plus plate reader (Molecular<br>
Devices) . OD405nm is plotted versus compound<br>
concentration and the IC5O values for the compounds are<br>
calculated using the curve fitting program SOFTmax Pro<br>
(Molecular Devices) using the four parameter fit option.<br>
Table 12 shows the results of the activity of<br>
selected compounds of this invention in the FAS induced<br>
apoptosis assay.<br>
