				<td>Extruder<br>
The invention refers to an extruder for the continuous<br>
processing and/or treatment of free-flowing materials with at<br>
least two shafts rotating in the same direction, which are<br>
equipped with interlocking feed screw segments and working<br>
segments and guided in circle segment-shaped recesses in the<br>
extruder housing parallel to the shafts.<br>
The shafts equipped with the feed screw segments and the<br>
working segments can also be arranged in a hollow space in<br>
the extruder housing along a circle with the same central<br>
angle (EP 0 788 867 Bl). Whilst the feed screw segments<br>
formed from individual elements feed the material to be<br>
processed in the extruder from the material feed opening to<br>
the material exit opening at the other end of the extruder,<br>
at the same time the working segments shaped as individual<br>
elements have a braking and, if necessary, a reversing<br>
function. As the working elements, kneading blocks, as known<br>
from EP 0 422 272 Al, for example, can be used, or so-called<br>
blisters, i.e. baffle plates with a diameter of the same size<br>
as the outer diameter of the screw, which can also be<br>
equipped as a so-called toothed disk with external teeth.<br>
Instead of such working elements that compress the material,<br>
pressure relieving working elements are also used. For<br>
example, from DE 102 33 213 Al, a screw element is known that<br><br>
2<br>
has a feed-neutral, pressure-relieving section which is<br>
formed through wearing of the screw at the screw cog.<br>
The working elements, which have different surfaces for<br>
different process tasks, can be combined with each other in<br>
almost any way to optimally take into account the respective<br>
total technical process requirements. The feed screw elements<br>
and working elements are lined up tightly to each other and<br>
are placed on the carrier shafts in a torque-proof manner<br>
and, positioned accurately both radially and axially, are<br>
driven in a co-ordinated manner by the drive.<br>
Due to special technical process requirements, working<br>
elements are frequently reduced in length to up to one sixth<br>
of the screw diameter and are almost always shorter than the<br>
screw diameter. On the other hand, high pressure can occur<br>
between the interlocking working elements of two adjacent<br>
shafts, particularly if these elements, such as reversing<br>
screw elements, kneading blocks, blisters or toothed disks,<br>
have a diameter that corresponds to the external sectional<br>
diameter. In this way, forces occur in double screw extruders<br>
around such working elements that lead to a considerable<br>
spread between the shafts. These forces also lead to<br>
considerable wear in multiple shaft extruders where the<br>
shafts are arranged around a circle with the same central<br>
angle.<br>
The task of the invention is to reduce the above-average wear<br>
around the working elements.<br>
In the invention, this is achieved by the working segments,<br>
which lead to a larger spread between two shafts than feed<br>
screw segments, being formed by a single-piece combined<br><br>
3<br>
element comprising at least one feed screw segment and/or at<br>
least one further working segment.<br>
The working segment which is united with a feed screw segment<br>
to form a combined element made as one piece can be a<br>
reversing working segment with a diameter corresponding to<br>
the screw diameter, particularly a screw segment with a<br>
greater pitch than the feed screw segment or a pitch<br>
direction counter to the feed screw segment or a kneading<br>
block, a blister or a toothed disk. However, two working<br>
segments can also be united as an element made as one piece,<br>
e.g. two kneading blocks with opposing pitch directions or a<br>
screw segment with an opposing pitch direction and a kneading<br>
block.<br>
By uniting a feed screw segment and a working segment, or two<br>
working segments into a longer combined element in accordance<br>
with the invention, the bending strength of the shafts is<br>
significantly improved. At the same time, the spreading<br>
forces are distributed over a larger, generally better<br>
lubricated surface and thus the surface load and therefore<br>
the wear are significantly reduced. In addition, the<br>
combination of several different technical process<br>
requirements that can be located in a segment over a<br>
relatively short length brings with it a decisive reduction<br>
in the number of parts, which results in a significant<br>
simplification of the equipment and maintenance of the shafts<br>
as well as their storage.<br>
In order to simplify the equipping of the shafts, the face<br>
surfaces of the combined elements in the invention are<br>
delimited by circular arcs, which correspond to the feed<br><br>
4<br>
screw diameter, the feed screw core diameter and are no<br>
larger than the centre distance of the axes of the shafts.<br>
The combined elements can then simply be placed on the shafts<br>
in such a way that the face surfaces delimited by the<br>
circular arcs align with each other. Thus fault-free mounting<br>
of the combined elements that interlock with the combined<br>
elements of the adjacent shaft is made significantly easier.<br>
So that the benefits of the combined elements take effect<br>
with regard to bending, strength and wear, the combined<br>
element has a length greater than the diameter of the screw,<br>
and specifically, more than double the diameter of the screw.<br>
The feed screw segment of the combined element is preferably<br>
designed with a double lead, as a double-lead screw leads to<br>
a larger feed quantity than a triple-lead screw, but compared<br>
to a single-lead screw has a greater bending strength.<br>
If a working segment of the combined element also has a<br>
screw-shaped surface, i.e. a screw segment with a greater<br>
pitch or counter pitch direction, this is also preferably<br>
designed with a double lead. The surface of the working<br>
segment can also simply have a spiral shaped progression<br>
similar to a screw, for example in the case of kneading<br>
blocks. So in accordance with the invention, a kneading block<br>
segment with double-lead cam plates arranged in a spiral that<br>
have a pitch direction in accordance with the feed screws,<br>
for example, can be combined with a double-lead kneading<br>
block segment with an opposing pitch direction to form one<br>
element.<br><br>
5<br>
With the high temperatures to which the material being<br>
processed is subjected, the shafts and the feed and working<br>
elements sitting on them expand differently. This results in<br>
the formation of a gap between the shaft and the elements<br>
sitting on them, into which the molten material, such as<br>
plastic, can penetrate and possibly combust, and in any case<br>
can bind the shaft with the elements so firmly that the<br>
elements can only be withdrawn from the shaft after cooling<br>
with the greatest of difficulty.<br>
This problem is accentuated in the long combined elements<br>
used in the invention to such an extent that at times the<br>
elements cannot be withdrawn at all and the whole shaft has<br>
to be discarded.<br>
In accordance with the invention therefore, each shaft is<br>
preferably divided into several shorter shaft sections,<br>
whereby the shaft sections are formed to be able to be<br>
axially distorted in the shaft core. For the axial distortion<br>
ability, an axially fixed rotating element is preferably<br>
pivoted at one end of the shaft section in the shaft core,<br>
which is equipped in a torque-proof manner with an external<br>
thread, which engages in the inner thread in the core of the<br>
adjacent shaft section. For this, the shaft section can have<br>
at one end a rotating element with an external thread and on<br>
the other end the inner thread in the core. There can also be<br>
shaft sections that at both ends have such rotating elements<br>
with external threads and which are connected to shaft<br>
sections that have internal threads in the core at both ends.<br>
In the shaft core of the shaft section, there is preferably<br>
an axial bore hole or similar recess so that the rotating<br><br>
6<br>
element can be activated. For this, the rotating element can<br>
be equipped on its side facing the axial recess of the shaft<br>
section with a polygon or polygonal recess, for example a<br>
hexagonal recess or peg, which is operated through a rod<br>
inserted in the axial bore hole of the shaft core, equipped<br>
at its end with a corresponding opposing polygon. Instead of<br>
a polygonal recess or a polygonal peg, naturally another<br>
activating recess or activating projection can be designed on<br>
the rotating element which is activated through a rod<br>
correspondingly designed at its end, inserted in the axial<br>
bore hole in the shaft core.<br>
Each shaft section with the torque-proof elements arranged on<br>
it is connected in a torque-proof manner with the adjacent<br>
shaft section. To do this, there is an interlocking, torque-<br>
proof connection between two adjacent shaft sections, for<br>
example using serrated or wedge-shaped teeth on the external<br>
perimeter of the end of the shaft core, to which the rotating<br>
element is pivoted, whereby the teeth work together on the<br>
external perimeter using serrated or wedge-shaped teeth in a<br>
hub bore hole at the end of the adjacent shaft section, where<br>
the internal thread is located into which the external thread<br>
on the rotating element of the adjacent shaft section<br>
engages.<br>
The combined element with a working segment and at least one<br>
feed screw segment and/or at least one additional working<br>
segment can be formed with the shaft core of the shaft<br>
segment as one piece. However, it is also possible to design<br>
the screw core of the shaft section for mounting one or more<br>
combined elements in a torque-proof manner.<br><br>
7<br>
Through the elements combined as one piece in the invention,<br>
the bending strength of the shaft is significantly increased<br>
to a certain length so that transverse forces that are<br>
produced are better distributed over a larger surface area<br>
and thus wear is reduced. In addition, in the invention the<br>
number of components is reduced, which has a beneficial<br>
effect on both storage and assembly and dismantling.<br>
Furthermore, short working segments are integrated, for<br>
example working segments with a length that is smaller than<br>
one half of the feed screw diameter, and also those that are<br>
not covered by the type charts, e.g. through their structural<br>
length and/or placement position. Placement errors can also<br>
be safely avoided in the case of complicated arrangements.<br>
The number of tight spots is also drastically reduced and the<br>
process space is radially close on a certain machine length<br>
to an internally guided shaft.<br>
The extruder in the invention can be formed as a double shaft<br>
extruder. However, it will preferably have three or more<br>
shafts arranged in a cavity in the extruder housing along a<br>
circle or circular arc with the same central angle.<br>
Below, the invention is described in more detail using the<br>

according to Figure 10;<br>

Figure 13 shows a cross-section along the line XIII-XIII in<br>
Figure 11; and<br>
Figure 14 shows a longitudinal section through a shaft made<br>
from several shaft sections with combined elements in place.<br>
In accordance with Figures 1 and- 2, an extruder in a housing<br>
1 has a space 2 which extends along a circle 3. In the space<br><br>
9<br>
2 are a number of shafts 4 arranged parallel to the axis<br>
around a core 5. The housing 1 is closed at the face sides<br>
with end plates 6 and 7. The shafts 4 extending through the<br>
end plate 6 are driven in the same direction by a drive that<br>
is not shown. The material feed opening is identified as 8<br>
and the material exit opening in the end plate 7 is<br>
identified as 9.<br>
There are several elements 11, 12, 13, 14 placed in a torque-<br>
proof manner on each shaft 4 using wedge-shaped teeth. Whilst<br>
elements 11 and 13 are formed by a feed screw segment,<br>
element 12 consists of a feed screw segment 15 and a kneading<br>
block 16, and element 14 of a feed screw segment 17 with a<br>
greater pitch than that of the feed screw elements 11 and 13,<br>
as well as a short screw segment 18 with an opposing pitch.<br>
The kneading block segment 16 and the short screw segment 18<br>
with an opposing pitch represent the working segments.<br>
On the inner side of the housing 1 and on the core 5 are<br>
recesses 19 and 20, parallel to the axis and shaped as<br>
circular segments, in which the feed screw elements 11 and 13<br>
and the combined elements 12 and 14 engage with limited play,<br>
i.e. to the greatest degree of tightness. At the same time,<br>
the feed screw elements 11 and 13 and the combined elements<br>
12 and 14 interlock tightly in each other to a large extent.<br>
Figures 3 and 4, as well as 5 and 6, show two other combined<br>
elements 22, 23 made from one feed screw segment 24 or 25 and<br>
one working segment 26 or 27, which are each formed through a<br>
screw segment with a greater pitch than that of the feed<br>
screw segment 24 or 25, whereby the working segment 27 is<br>
designed to be shorter than the working segment 26.<br><br>
10<br>
Figures 7 and 8 show a combined element 28, which consists of<br>
a kneading block segment 29 made from cam disks which, as<br>
indicated by the dotted line 29', is arranged with a pitch<br>
direction in accordance with a feed screw element, and a<br>
kneading block segment 30 made from can disks, which, as<br>
indicated by the dotted line 30', are arranged with opposing<br>
pitch directions. This means that in this design form, two<br>
kneading block segments 29 and 30 as working segments with<br>
different functions are combined into one element 28.<br>
As shown in Figure 9, two interlocking combined elements 22<br>
have a face 10 which is delimited by the circular arcs A-B,<br>
E-F and A-E. The circular arc A-B has a diameter that<br>
corresponds to the screw diameter D, the circular arc E-F has<br>
a diameter that corresponds to the screw core diameter d, and<br>
the circular arc A-E has a diameter the radius of which<br>
corresponds to the axis distance Ax of both combined elements<br>
22 (see also EP-B-0002131). In the same way, the face 10 of<br>
the combined elements 22 and 2 8 is formed in accordance with<br>
Figures 3 and 4 and/or 7 and 8.<br>
The combined element 23 in accordance with Figures 5 and 6<br>
also has a face 20 which is delimited by the circular arcs A-<br>
B, E-F' and A-E, but additionally by the circular arc 32,<br>
which corresponds to a semicircle with the diameter of the<br>
screw core.<br>
Through the combined elements' faces formed from these<br>
circular arcs, the equipping of the shafts is significantly<br>
simplified, as the elements only have to be equipped so that<br>
their faces align with each other.<br><br>
11<br>
Each shaft 4 is divided into several short shaft sections<br>
that can be different formed. Thus with the shaft section 33<br>
according to Figures 10 and 11, the shaft core 37 and the<br>
schematically depicted combined element 36 are formed as one<br>
piece, whilst in the case of the shaft sections 34, 35 in<br>
Figures 12 and 14, the schematically represented combined<br>
elements 36 are placed on the shaft core 37 in a torque-proof<br>
way using wedge-shaped teeth 38.<br>
The shaft sections 33, 34, 35 are designed to be able to be<br>
axially deformed under tension in the shaft core 37. For<br>
this, a cylindrical rotating element 41 pivots at the end of<br>
each shaft section 33, 34, 35 in an axial recess 39 in the<br>
shaft core 37. At its end that protrudes from the axial<br>
recess 39, the rotating element 41 has an external thread 42.<br>
To axially attach the rotating element 41, there is a wire<br>
ring 43 which engages on one side in a perimeter groove 44 in<br>
the cylindrical axial recess 39 in the shaft core 37 and on<br>
the other in a perimeter groove 45 in the external perimeter<br>
of the cylindrical rotating element 41.<br>
The wire ring 43 is formed, as can be seen in Figure 13, by a<br>
wire being pushed between the perimeter grooves 44, 45<br>
through a tangential bore hole 48 in the shaft core 37 from<br>
the side.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 10, to connect the shaft sections<br>
there is a coaxial internal thread 49 on the other end of the<br>
shaft section 33 in the shaft core 37, into which the coaxial<br>
external thread 42 of the adjacent shaft section 33 can be<br>
screwed.<br><br>
12<br>
In order to increase the bending strength, the shaft core 37<br>
protrudes at the end of the shaft section 33 on which the<br>
rotating element 41 is arranged, whereby the axial peg formed<br>
by the protruding shaft core end 4 6 is inserted in the end of<br>
the adjacent shaft recess 33 where, on the inner side of the<br>
axial recess 47, the axial recess has an internal thread 49.<br>
To activate the rotating element 41, the shaft core 37 has a<br>
continuous axial bore hole or similar recess 51. The rotating<br>
element 41 can, for example, have a hexagonal recess 52, in<br>
which a hexagon, which is not shown, is attached to a rod<br>
which is inserted through the axial bore hole 51 in order to<br>
turn the rotating element 41 and thus screw the external<br>
thread 42 either in or out of the internal thread 49 of the<br>
adjacent shaft section 33, in order to connect or detach the<br>
adjacent shaft section. Each shaft section 33 is formed in a<br>
torque-proof manner using the adjacent shaft section 33. For<br>
this, there are wedge-shaped teeth 53 on the peg 4 6 in<br>
accordance with Figure 11, which engage with the wedge-shaped<br>
teeth 50 in the axial recess 47 of the adjacent shaft recess<br>
33. In the case of the design form in accordance with Figure<br>
12, the wedge-shaped teeth 38 on the shaft core 37 used for<br>
the elements 36 are additionally used.<br>
In Figure 14, the direction of extrusion is indicated with an<br>
arrow 54. The direction for assembling the shaft from the<br>
shaft sections 34, 35 also corresponds to the direction of<br>
the arrow 54, whilst the direction of dismantling runs<br>
counter to the direction of the arrow 54. It can be seen that<br>
the ends of the shaft sections 34, 35 are each equipped on<br><br>
13<br>
their upstream end with a rotating element 41 with reference<br>
to the direction of extrusion 54.<br><br>
