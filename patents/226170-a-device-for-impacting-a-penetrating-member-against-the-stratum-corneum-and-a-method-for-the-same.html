MOOES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0015] The applicator device of the present invention is used for<br>
repeatabte impact application of an array of microprotrusions to the stratum<br>
corneum in conjunction with transdermal therapeutic agent (e.g., drug)<br>
delivery or transdermal body analyte (e.g.. glucose) sampling. Although the<br>
applicator device 10 is described for use with a certain type of microprotrusion<br>
array, it should be understood that the applicator device may also be used<br>
with other types of stratum corneum micropenetrating members. The<br>
applicator device can be used by patients having neither the hand strength<br>
nor the manual dexterity to cock other types of spring-loaded applicator<br><br>
devices. Further, the applicator device can be cocked and released with one-<br>
handed operation v.'hicli provides certain advantages, for example, allowing a<br>
patient to apply a drug delivering mjcroprotrusion array tor local therapy on a<br>
site on the patient's own arm<br>
[0016] Turning now to the figures, FIG. 1 illustrates applicator device 10<br>
including a device body 12 and a piston 14 movable within the device body.<br>
A cap 16 is provided on the device body 12 for activating the applicator to<br>
impact the stratum corneum with a microprotrusion array (not shown in FIG<br>
1). An impact spring 20 is positioned around a post 22 of the piston 14 and<br>
biases the piston downward with respect to the device body 12. The piston<br>
14 has a tower surface 18 which is substantially planar, slightly convex, or<br>
configured to a body surface (i.e , a specific skin site). The lower surface 18<br>
of the piston 14 causes a microprotrusion array or a transdermal patch<br>
containing a microprotrusion array to impact and pierce the stratum corneum.<br>
(0017] FIG. 1 shows the piston 14 in an uncocked position, while FIG. 2<br>
shows the piston in the cocked position. When the applicator device 10 is<br>
cocked, the piston 14 is pressed up inside the device body 12 and locked in<br>
place by a locking mechanism. The locking mechanism includes a catch 26<br>
on the post 22 and a flexible finger 28 on the device body 12 having a<br>
corresponding latch 30.<br>
(0018] As the piston M is moved toward the device body 12 compressing<br>
the impact spring 20. the catch 26 flexes the finger 28 and snaps over the<br>
corresponding lajch so of the flexible finger 28. The cocking step is<br>
performed by a single compression motion which both cocks and locks the<br>
piston 14 in the cocked position. This cocking step is easily performed with<br>
only one hand by compressing the applicator device 10 between a user's<br>
hand and another surface (e.g. a table top)<br>
(0019] FIG. 2 illustrates the applicator device 10 with the piston 14 in a<br>
cocked configuration. As shown in FIG. 2. in the cocked position, the catch<br>
26 and latch 30 on the piston 14 and device body 12 are releasably engaged<br>
preventing downward motion of the piston in the device body.<br>
[0020] FIG. 2 also illustrates a patch retainer 34 mounted on the device<br>
body 12. The retainer 34 has an annular shape with a first end 40 which is<br><br>
configured to engage the device body 12. A second end 42 of the retainer 34<br>
provides a stratum comeum contacting surface. A patch 44 is mounted<br>
between the first and seconci ends 40, 42 of the retainer 34 The patch 44 is<br>
suspended in the retainer 34 Although the manner in which the patch 44 is<br>
mounted in the retainer 34 and the location ol the mounted patch 44 within<br>
the retainer 34 may vary (tor example, the patch 44 may be positioned<br>
adjacent the second end 42 of the retainer 34) it is preferred to mount patch<br>
44 recessed some distance from both ends 40 and 42 (as shown in FIG. 1) in<br>
order to avoid inadvertent contact of the patch microprotrusions with other<br>
objects (e.g., the fingers of the user).<br>
[0021] According to one example, the patch 44 is connected by frangible<br>
sections of patch base material to an annular ring of patch material which is<br>
adhered to the retainer ring 34. The patch 44 is separated from the retainer<br>
ring 34 by the downward force of the piston 14 Alternatively, the patch may<br>
be releasably attached to the piston 14 or positioned on the skin beneath the<br>
piston.<br>
[0022] The applicator device 10 can be used with a patch 44 which<br>
generally includes a nwcrop.'Otrusion array, an agent reservoir, and a backing<br>
However, the applicator device 10 may also be used with a microprotrusion<br>
array without an agent reservoir. In thts case, the microprotrusion array is<br>
used as a pretreatment which is followed by the application of an agent with a<br>
separate transderrnai agent delivery or sampling device. Alternatively, the<br>
microprotrusion array may incorporate the agent as a coating on the<br>
microprotrusions, e.g. tor delivering a vaccine intradermally. The application<br>
device 10 may also be used for impacting other micropiercing elements<br>
against the stratum comeum, for example those disclosed in Godshall et ai,<br>
U.S. Patent 5,879,326 and Zuck WO 99/29364, the disclosures of which are<br>
incorporated by reference herein.<br>
[0023] In addition to being able to cock the device 10 with only one hand,<br>
device 10 is also designed to be operated (i.e., to cause release of the spring-<br>
loaded piston 14 and thus causing the patch 44 to impact the skin) using only<br>
one hand. The activation ot the applicator device 10 by releasing the locking<br>
mechanism is performed by downward force applied to the applicator cap 16<br><br>
while the second end 42 of the applicator device is held against the skin. The<br>
cap 16 is biased upwards by a hold down spring 24 which is positioned<br>
between the device body 12 and the cap. The cap 16 includes a pm 46<br>
extending downward from the cap. When the cap 16 is pressed downward<br>
against the bias of the hold down spring 24, the pin 46 contacts a ramp 48 on<br>
the flexible finger 28 moving the flexible finger outward and disengaging the<br>
latch 30 of the flexible finger 28 from the catch 26. This releases the piston<br>
14 and the piston moves downward impacting the stratum corneum with the<br>
patch 44.<br>
[0024] FIG. 3 illustrates the applicator device 10 after ths device has been<br>
released and a patch has been applied to the stratum corneum The hold<br>
down spring 24 is selected such that a predetermined hold down force must<br>
be achieved before the device is released The hold down force causes the<br>
stratum corneum to be stretched by the second end 42 of the retainer 34 so<br>
that the skin is under optimal tension at the time the patch 44 impacts the<br>
skin. The hold down force applied by the hold down spring 24 is preferably<br>
selected to cause the second end 42 to apply a tension to the skin in the<br>
range of about 0.01 to 10 megapascais (MPa), more preferably about 0.05 to<br>
2MPa.<br>
[0025] A balance between the hold down spring 24 and the impact spring<br>
20 allows the cocking of the piston 14 by pressing on the cap 16 without<br>
causing the finger 46 to release the locking mechanism. The impact spring<br>
20 is selected to achieve a predetermined impact which is appropriate for a<br>
particular patch to provide the desired penetration. The selection of the<br>
impact and hold down springs is described further in U.S. Provisional Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 60/240,307 filed on even date herewith, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
(0026] The retainer 34 is attached to the device body 12 after cocking of<br>
the piston 14. The retainer 34 is attached by a snap in connection requiring<br>
less force to snap m than the force required to release the piston. The<br>
retainer 34 may also be attached to the device body by a bayonett fitting or a<br>
slide-on fitting which allows the retainer 34 to slide into the device body 12 in<br>
a direction normal to the axis of the applicator.<br><br>
[0027] FIG. 4 illustrates the cap 16, device body 12, and piston 14 in an<br>
exploded perspective view. As shown «n FIG. 4. the piston 14 includes piston<br>
retainer tabs 52 which engage a lower rim 54 (FIG. 3) of the device body 12<br>
and prevent the piston from being expelled from the device body. In addition,<br>
the cap 16 includes retainer tabs (not shown) which similarly engage an upper<br>
rim 58 (FIG 3) of the device body 12 and prevent the cap from coming off of<br>
the body.<br>
[0028] FIG. 4 also illustrates an optional rotational locking arrangement<br>
which allows the cap 16 to be rotated io a locked position at which activation<br>
of the applicator is not possible because the pin 46 is not aligned with the<br>
flexible finger 28. An indication of the locked or unlocked position of the cap<br>
16 is provided through a window 60 in the cap. When the cap 16 is at<br>
positions other than the unlocked position, the pin 46 is not aligned with the<br>
ramp 48 on the flexible finger 28 and thus, the applicator cannot be released.<br>
While this optional locking feature prevents inadvertent activation of the<br>
applicator device 10, the re'ative rotational motion of the body 12 and the cap<br>
16 generally requires the use of both hands, which in some cases is less<br>
desirable.<br>
[0029] FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrate an alternative embodiment of an applicator<br>
80	having a different shape and somewhat different cocking arrangement<br>
which also achieves the desired result of simple one handed cocking<br>
operation. According to this embodiment, the user grasps an outer cylinder<br>
81	which acts as a handle for the device. A piston 82 is slidabty engaged<br>
within the cylinder 81 An impact spring 83, shown in compression in FIG. 6<br>
biases thejaisten 82 away from the top or skin distal end of cyclinder 81. A<br>
releasabie catch mechanism 84 (not shown in detail in FIG 6) is provided<br>
whereby depression of button 85 causes latchj&amp;to retract thereby enabling<br>
compressed spring 83 to move piston 82 downwardly (i.e. , in a direction<br>
towards the skin). Slidably engaging the skin proximal end of cyclinder 81 is<br>
a middle housing 87 having an indicator notch 96. Threaded to housing 87 is<br>
lower housing 88 which has a generally annular shape. A retainer 93, whose<br>
function is described in detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No.<br>
60/240,379 filed on even date herewith and incorporated herein by reference<br><br>
is screwed onto the skin proximal end ot cyclinder 81. Within retainer 93 is an<br>
impact head 34 which is attached to piston 82. [W,Q^J}SSSLS^ is adapted to<br>
hold, on its skin proximal suface, a patch having a plurality ot<br>
microprotrusions (the patch is not shown m FIG 6). A hold down spring 95,<br>
shown in compression in FIG. 6, is provided between cyclinder 81 and middle<br>
housing 87r Hold down spring 95 compresses when the user grabs cylinder<br>
81, places edge 89 against the skin site to be pierced, and presses the device<br>
80 against the skin site As spring 95 is compressed, notch 96 becomes<br>
aligned with the lower edge of band 97. In this alignment, the hold down<br>
spring 95 is in a predetermined compression which provides the necessary<br>
hold down force and skin stretching at edge 89. Once the notch 96 is aligned<br>
with the lower edge of band 97, the operator simply presses button 85, which<br>
releases latch 86_which in turn releases piston 82 and head 94, causing head<br>
94 to impact the microprotrusion member against the patient's skin.<br>
[0030] The applicator devices 10 and 80, according to the present<br>
invention have been described with respect to an upright orientation in which<br>
the patch 44 is applied Irorn a piston side of the device which is illustrated at<br>
the bottom/skin proximal end of the devices in the figures It should be<br>
understood that the applicator devices may be used in other orientations (i.e ,<br>
sideways and upside down) as long as the device is properly oriented against<br>
the skin site to be pierced.<br>
[0031] FIG. 7 illustrates one embodiment of a stratum corneum<br>
penetrating member for use with the present invention. FIG. 7 shows a<br>
plurality of microprotrusior.s in the form of microblades 90. The microblades<br>
90 extend at a substantially 90° angle from a metal sheet 92 having openings<br>
94. The sheet 92 may be incorporated in an agent delivery patch or an agent<br>
sampling patch which includes an agent reservoir and an adhesive for<br>
adhering the patch to the stratum corneum. Examples of agent delivery and<br>
sampling patches which incorporate a microprotrusion array are found in WO<br>
97/48440, WO 97/48441. WO 97/48442. The microprotrusion array of FIG 7<br>
without a reservoir may also be applied alone as a skin pretreatment.<br>
[0032] The teifn microprotrusion" as used herein refers to very tiny<br>
stratum corneum piercing elements typically having a length of less than 500<br><br>
nm, and preferably less than 250 Mm, which pierce through the stratum<br>
corneum into the underlying epidermis layer or epidermis and derrnis layers.<br>
However, the microprotrusions should not penetrate so deep into the dermis<br>
layer as to cause bleeding. In order to penetrate the stratum corneum, the<br>
microprotrusions preferably have a length of at least 10 urn, more preferably<br>
at least 50 urn In general, microprotrusions penetrate the skin to a depth of<br>
no more than about 500 urn and preferably less than about 400 urn. The<br>
microprotrusions may be formed in different shapes, such as needles, hollow<br>
needles, blades, pins, punches, and combinations thereof<br>
[0033] The tern "microprotrusion array' as used herein refers to a plurality<br>
of microprotrusions arranged in an array for pierce 3 the stratum corneum.<br>
The microprotrusion array may be formed by cutting a plurality of blades from<br>
a thin metal sheet and folding each of the blades out of the plane of the sheet<br>
to form the configuration shown in FIG. 7. The microprotrusion array may<br>
also be formed in other known manners, such as by connecting multiple strips<br>
having microprotrusions along an edge of each of the strips. The<br>
microprotrusion array may include holiow needles which inject a liquid<br>
formulation.<br>
