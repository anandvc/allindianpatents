				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method of molding a dispensing tube having a head joined to a tubular body, an apparatus and a molded head thereof. In general, this invention relates to containers, for example, collapsible dispensing containers, e.g., tubes, for packaging food, dentifrice, cosmetic, industrial, home use and other products. More particularly, this invention is directed to improved containers, e.g., collapsible dispensing containers, that have plastic upper portions, e.g., heads, that have thinned portions. In the improved containers, the upper portions, e.g., the shoulders of the heads, have sufficient rigidity for the process to resist deformation and are securely bonded to the bodies of the containers,<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There has been an on-going effort to reduce the cost of making containers. Efforts<br>
have been made to reduce the amount of materials used to make the containers. With<br>
respect to dispensing containers having an orifice in a substantially rigid upper portion<br>
that is joined to a body portion, e.g., collapsible dispensing containers having and<br>
orifice in a substantially rigid head whose shoulder is joined to a squeezable or<br>
collapsible body, efforts have been directed to reducing the thickness of the upper<br>
portion or head. However, these efforts have met with only limited success. When the<br>
thickness of the upper portion, e.g., the portion of the shoulder of the head that is<br>
joined to the upper end portion of the body, has been reduced, the bond at the joint<br>
between the shoulder and the body has lacked sufficient strength to maintain the<br>
integrity and seal of the joint. One problem has been that with a thinned shoulder,<br>
there has not been an effective way to provide enough plastic material of the shoulder<br>
at a high enough temperature to and at the area of the joint with the upper portion of<br>
the body wall, to obtain an effective joint and seal. For example, in injection molding<br>
processes that inject heads from or through the rim of the 	__^^<br><br>
orifice of the head to the portion, usually the lower, portion of the shoulder, the temperature of the thinned plastic material drops as it travels through the mold cavity to the area of the shoulder where the temperature of the plastic is not high enough to form  a satisfactory bond to the body wall. Although the injection gate can be towards the shoulder to shorten the travel and achieve the bond, it makes it more difficult to back fill the head without flashing the shoulder joint.<br>
It would be desirable to provide low cost containers, especially of the collapsible dispensing type, that employ less materials to produce and that have sufficient strength and integrity. It would also be desirable to provide improved methods and apparatus for forming such containers.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide improved low cost containers of the above-described type, and methods and apparatus for<br>
forming them, that overcome one or more of the above-described problems and/or meet one or more of the above mentioned desires.<br>

Figs. 13 through 15 show a preferred conventional set of injection molding tools of the Tuboplast process that have been modified for forming the head and container of the invention.<br>
The head of the invention is made with less material than would a head of equal size be made without the invention. An improved low cost head is therefore provided. Containers utilizing the head are low cost containers. The low cost containers with the thinned heads or shoulders of the heads joined to the body walls of the containers have the required rigidity in the neck and shoulder of the head, and they have a sufficiently strong bond at the joint between the shoulder and body. The bond at the joint provides a hermetic seal for commercial applications.<br>
The heads and collapsible dispensing containers of the invention can be made by slight modification and use of any suitable method and apparatus. Referring to Figs 13-15, a preferred method is to inject the plastic material that is to form the head into a mold cavity 50 that is shaped in the form of the head. The molten plastic material is injected from above into the cavity portion that forms the rim of the neck of the head. According to the invention, male tooling, here shown, for example, as the male die member 52 that forms the interior surface of the head, has axial grooves 54 therein that are designed to form the ribs on the interior surface of the head, as the head is being molded. In the preferred process, a tubular body, often referred to as a sleeve (not shown), is positioned on a male mandrel 56 that is axially aligned with the female die member that forms the head. This method and apparatus, without the modification of the invention, is well known in the art. When the head is fomned, the molten plastic material flows into and along the grooves to the lower end portion or<br><br>
edge of the shoulder of the head. The grooves provide channels for the flow of the molten material to the lower portion of the shoulder of the head. Enough of the molten material reaches the lower portion of the shoulder at a temperature and pressure that is high enough to form a good bond with the upper end portion or rim of the tubular body. The head and body are left in the mold long enough to bond them together and cool sufficiently that they are securely bonded or joined together. Conventional molding temperatures and materials can be employed. Conventional head forming methods and apparatus modified in accordance with the invention can be employed. This includes pre-molding a head and assembling it to a tubular body in a second operation. The pre-molds can be formed by injection, compression, and thermoformlng. Assembly can be effected by induction welding, spin welding and various known processes using heat and pressure. The tubular containers of the invention can be formed by compression molding or thermoformlng the head, in each case with simultaneous bonding to the tubular body or sleeve. The heads can also be formed by injection blow molding and perform blow molding. The preferred process and apparatus to be modified according to the invention is well known to those skilled in the art as the Tuboplast process and apparatus. This involves injection of the head and simultaneous bonding of the head to the tubular body or sleeve. This process is disclosed in one or more expired U.S. Patents and will be described more fully herein. Thus, other than mainly for providing and utilizing grooves in the male tooling or male die member, or of course in the female tooling to form ribs on the outer surface of the head, the tooling and the process can be conventional.<br>
As stated above, the head of the invention and container bodies of the invention can be formed by conventional compression molding processes and apparatus. In compression molding, the mold cavity is open and the heated plastic material, usually a metered dose thereof, is deposited into the open mold. The mold is closed under pressure. This moves the plastic around the cavity to forni the head and simultaneously join it to the sleeve on the mandrel. The male die member in this process is adapted according to the invention to have grooves to flow material to<br><br>
the joint area and to form the rigidifying ribs.<br>
The plastic material that flows through the grooves preferably leaves the ends of the grooves and flows circumferentially around the mandrel forms the lower end of the shoulder and forms a good bond about the entire periphery of the joint between the head, usually the lower end of the<br>
shoulder, and the tubular body.<br>
The use of a reduced amount of plastic material in the head reduces cycle time in producing the heads. The grooves for the ribs and the flow of molten material through the grooves assures that there is enough plastic material to form a good bond and that the plastic is hot enough that it flows to the joint area and is hot enough and has enough pressure when it reaches the area and to form a good bond, e.g., with the upper portion of the body wall. The invention is not to be limited by the words used to describe the bond at the joint between the shoulder and the head. Any suitable joint, fusion of materials or connection can be employed. A bond does not require but could have an adhesive.<br>
Traditional Injection and compression molded tube heads for a 1 inch diameter tube, measured through the frustoconical portion web of the shoulder of the conventional head, are designed with a typical lmm/0.040" thick cross section. For such a sized tube, the preferred cross section according to the invention, measured through the web portion of the shoulder between the ribs, is about 0.51mm/0.024." thick. The thickness of a cross section through the shoulder and an underlying rib is the same or about the same as the conventional shoulder thickness of 0.040". The preferred thickness of the web area between the ribs is about 0.023" to about 0.024", plus or minus 0.005". The interstitial web thickness is sufficient to render the head self-supporting or freestanding. Above 0.030" there is less need for ribs. If the shoulder of the tube is less than 0.015" thick, the chances increase that there may not be an adequate bond. The invention is especially advantageous tor tubes whose diameters are from about %" to about 1 &gt;^" or about 2".<br><br>
The container bodies of the invention can be made by yet other injection molding processes and apparatus. One such method allows the head and shoulder of the invention to be molded according to the invention as a single entity separately from a body or sleeve. Later, the head is joined to the body or sleeve in a conventional secondary assembly process with suitable materials, temperatures and pressures. The head would be loaded onto a mandrel and heated enough to form a satisfactory bond to the body or sleeve. Any of several of such processes, e.g., induction welding, spin welding, etc. can be employed.<br>
The heads and bodies of the invention can be formed with any suitable materials. Preferably, the head comprised polyethylene, preferably high or low-density polyethylene. The preferred materials for the head have a melt index of from about 1 to 2, although by no means is this range to be considered a limitation. For example, the melt index for the injected perform head could be up to 12 or more.<br>
The drawings show the preferred rib dimensions for the tube described. Those persons of skill in the art will know how to adjust rib widths etc, to suit the application. If the flow path is too thin, it will be difficult for the plastic to have enough heat at the shoulder to provide a good bond.<br>
The ribs can be in any suitable design or configuration. For example, they can branch to distribute material at more points or areas about the circumference of the tube. The ribs can be formed in any suitable pattern.<br>
The heads of the invention provide about a 25% reduction in materials for the tube shown on Sheet A of the drawings. As the size of the tube increases, more savings are provided. The ribs of the invention can be of any suitable thickness, number and arrangement, so long as the grooves to form them allow a sufficient amount of the particular moldable<br><br>
material being employed to flow at the desired temperatures to the desired location, and to preferably provide sufficient rigidity to rigidify the head as needed for the process employed and the handling and uses intended.<br><br><br>
