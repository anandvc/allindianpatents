				<td>A WATER MILL USED FOR GRINDING GRAINS<br>
The invention relates to a water mill useful for grinding grains in hill through the utilization of water power. Grinding of grains with ordinary, wooden water mill is an age-old tradition in hilly areas of our country. These water mills, known as gharats in Uttar Pradesh have designs that are centuries old and so far very little modification has been done in them to improve their performance. The present invention is a revolutionary improvement over the designs as it enables a water mill to grind grains 3-5 times faster and that too in a more environment friendly manner.<br>
The traditional water mill consists of a wooden turbine with straight wooden blades, fitted at an angle to a thick vertical wooden shaft tapering at both ends. The water chute<br><br>
consists of an open channel either made from wooden planks or carved out from a large tree trunk. The chute is narrowed down towards the lower end forming a nozzle. The wooden shaft of the turbine is supported on a stone pivot through a steel pin and held in the sliding bearing at the top. The sliding bearing is a wooden bush fixed in the lower stationary grinding stone. The top grinding stone sustains the lower stone and is rotated by the turbine shaft through a straight slot coupling. The gap between the stone is adjusted by lifting die upper stone with the help of a mechanical lever.<br>
The efficiency of existing gharats ranges around 10 to 15% only. Being made almost entirely of wood, it not only necessitates cutting down of trees but also requires constant maintenance. With the increase in population, the traditional water mills with such low outputs are not able to provide enough economic supports to the mill owners. Slowly, therefore, these are being abandoned and are being replaced by such alien and polluting devices as diesel and electric mills. People are not very happy with these new devices but have no option but to bear with them as they are definitely fester. However, by providing superior technical inputs, the life and efficiency of a traditional water mill can be increased by 3-5 times, thus improving economical viability, and making better use of a non-polluting source of energy.<br>
The main objective is to provide an efficient and long life watermill mat is useful for grinding cereals at a faster rate with minimal maintenance. The invention is the first of its type that ensures the enhancement of efficiency by 3-5 times over the systems<br>
commonly in use from centuries.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to use, as many parts as possible of the existing water mills, which are generally found in good condition and the use of which do not affect the output of the water mills. The parts of the present invention are very simple and easy to understand by local people. Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide its easy installation of the existing water mill sites.<br>
Accordingly, The present invention relates to a water mill used for grinding grains utilizing water power comprising a shaft made of steel with a runner fitted to the said shaft by means of a collar pin, the said driving shaft being provided with a ball bearing at its lower end, resting on a hardened steel piece, welded on a steel plate, attached to a bottom stone, the upper end of the shaft being rectangular in cross section and is provided with a rynd at the upper end of it and placed inside the upper grinding stone;<br>

Hie present invention thus comprises of a shaft (1) made of steel of 50-mm diameter. This shaft is attached with the runner (2) by providing a simple collar pin (3). The length of the shaft may vary from site to site as the existing water mills have different shaft lengths. The upper end of the shaft is cut in a rectangular form (18) to fit the rynd (23) for upper stone (13) attachment The runner (2) has a very simple structure cast in steel. The diameter of the runner (2) is 500 mm having 16 blades (16). The complete runner (2) is of single piece casting having about 30 kg weight.<br>
A very simple pivot bearing has been designed as pivot bearing (5). The ball (4), that is originally the ball o a ball bearing, is fitted at the lower end of the shaft (1) in the slot (20). The shaft (1) resting on a hardened steel piece (21) welded on a steel plate (22), has been used as pivot bearing. A hole is drilled in the hardened piece (21) and steel plate (22) and a grease nipple (6) is provided for greasing the bottom bearing (5) through the hole with the help of a nipple.<br><br>
A simple oil socked wooden bush (IS) made of hard wood is used as top bearing. A rynd (23) made of steel is used for revolving the upper stone over the bottom stone by driving shaft. The rynd (23) is placed inside the upper grinding stone (13).<br>
Hie other components such as, hopper, grinding stones, feeding mechanism are the same as used in existing water mills. Even die existing flume can be reused by providing the lining of a G.I. sheet inside the flume. The position of the existing flume man however, need to be changed to provide the required angle with the new runner and the lower end of the flume may be modified so mat the water jet strikes the runner properly. Existing grinding stones can be used for the new installation if these be in good condition. Generally, it has been found that the grinding stones of the existing water mills are not properly dressed. It is very important that the grooves be made properly and scientifically. The grooves should be about 2.5 cm wide and about 1 cm deep. About 10 cm at the edge of the grinding stone should be left to enable find grinding. The owner should be taught to make the grooves properly at the time of installation. The feeding mechanism is also a very simple device. It has two main parts, hopper and bird. Hopper can be made either from wooden planks of G.L Sheets. The bird is made of hard wood and is fitted to the hopper. The existing feeding, mechanism can also be used for the new installation provided it fits and functions correctly.<br>
In order to install the system, first of all, the room should be cleaned properly and ail the unwanted things lying there taken out After removing the upper grinding stone and the<br><br>
old water mill runner, the driving shaft is placed through the hole of the bottom grinding stone. From the down stream side, the runner is placed above the bottom bearing which is fitted loosely on the lift mechanism bar. The runner is aligned with the shaft and the bottom bearing. The upper bearing/wooded bush is fitted into the bottom grinding stone over the driving shaft. After it is ensured that the runner is moving freely, the bottom bearing plate is fixed on the lift mechanism bar with nails. Next the upper stone is placed over the bottom stone and the Rynd is fixed over the upper end of the shaft and upper stone. After fitting the runner with the stone, it is to be ensured that the water jet is striking the runner blade properly, if not, the jet is corrected as per requirement<br>
The working of the improved water milt is similar to that of the traditional water mills, but the output of the improved water mill is found to be increased by 3-5 times over that of the traditional water mill.<br>
The invention is the first of its type, which has the following important and useful characteristics:<br>
(i) This is an improved water mill capable of grinding cereals about 3-4 times more faster rate than a traditional water mill.<br>
(ii) The runner, which is the main component of the system is cast in single piece in order to save die fabrication cost as casting is very cheap and manufacturing can be done fast Using cast iron in place of wood makes the invention almost maintenance free and saves otherwise needed for this purpose.<br><br>
(iii) The installation of the improved Hater mill is very easy. Its part can be fitted to the existing traditional water mil 3 systems at the same site. Therefore., there is no need to replace all the parts of the ex is ti ng system, which saves cost.,<br>
(iv) The improved water mill is very compact and has a long lite in comparison to the traditional water mill.<br>
(v) The parts of the improved water mill are light and can be easily transported to the site.<br>
