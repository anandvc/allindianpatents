FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The  present  invention  is  in  relation to  film  coated  controlled  release  matrix<br>
formulations. More particularly the present invention relates to controlled release matrix formulations containing glucosamine and their salts. The formulation of the present invention is useful for the management of arthritis and its related disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Natural ingredients, including Ayurvedic formulations, have been used to treat bone and joint inflammation, especially in eastern countries, and, increasingly, in western countries. Such natural ingredients include, for example, cartilage, chondroitin, glucosamine, proteolytic and other enzymes, and herbs, such as the gummy extract of B. serrata, Ashwagandha root and ginseng root. Although such natural ingredients generally do not lead to the kind of side effects observed with the steroidal and no steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), many of these natural ingredients do not always provide sufficient relief of pain or restoration of significant function and use of inflamed tissue, e.g., joints. However, glucosamine and chondroitin have been found to contribute to restoring such function and use. Although glucosamine generally does not provide the same rapid temporary relief of inflammation and pain as aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), it plays several key roles in the preservation and rebuilding of joint tissues. Namely, it stimulates the cartilage cells to produce glycosaminoglycans and proteolysis, which maintain healthy joints and contribute to rebuilding connective tissue, and it, is one of the main ingredients of the synovial fluid that lubricates and provides nutrients for the joint structure. By participating in the preservation and rebuilding of joint tissues, it is believed that glucosamine can contribute to long term relief of a wide range of degenerative and inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, degenerative spinal disc disease, tendonitis, bursitis, and trauma to joints, tendons and ligaments, and may actually reverse the underlying disease process, in many cases.<br>
Chondroitin, e.g., chondroitin sulfate, have also been found to play a role in the preservation and rebuilding of joint tissues. In a similar fashion to glucosamine, chondroitin have been found to stimulate cartilage cells to produce the needed proteoglycans and to inhibit the enzymes that break down proteoglycans. Chondroitin sulfate in particular also functions to draw fluid into the proteoglycans molecules.<br><br>
This fluid acts as a shock absorber for the joint tissue and also carries nutrients into the cartilage.<br>
Although the administration of glucosamine appears to be an effective treatment for many conditions having an inflammatory component, it is not free of side effects. In that regard, it has been found that high blood serum levels of glucosamine can interfere with glucose regulation in both normal individuals and individuals with diabetes mellitus. The high levels of glucosamine can induce an insulin resistance response, resulting in reduced rates of insulin-mediated glucose uptake by the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue (fat cells). If uncontrolled, insulin-resistance can lead to hyperglycemia and possibly glucose toxicity. In normal (i.e., non-diabetic) individuals, hyperglycemia can interfere with cellular metabolism and the mechanics for insulin-induced glucose disposal. The hyperglycemia itself can worsen insulin resistance, thus contributing to a vicious cycle that makes glycemic regulation more difficult. Moreover, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance are major contributing factors in the pathogenesis of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).<br>
The effects of high glucosamine levels on patients with NIDDM are typically more pronounced, since such patients generally affect glycemic regulation with dietary control. Thus, in such patients the cause and effect of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia on each other result in worsening the diabetic state and making glycemic regulation more difficult. Moreover, clinical studies have shown that hyperglycemia is the cause of most if not all of the chronic complications of diabetes. Insulin resistance induced by high levels of glucosamine can also have dramatic effects on patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) by again initiating a vicious cycle that worsens the diabetic state and makes glycemic regulation more difficult, possibly leading to glucose toxicity. Drawbacks of glucosamine conventional tablets and capsules: Glucosamine can be a stomach irritant in certain individuals, when glucosamine contacts the stomach lining.<br>
Glucosamine capsule dissolves very quickly and leads to stomach irritation because of the sudden release of the glucosamine.<br>
Glucosamine tablets sudden dissolution provides high local concentrations and cause causes stomach lining irritation.<br><br>
Significant fraction of the ingested glucosamine is categorized by first-pass metabolism in the liver.<br>
The bioavailability of oral glucosamine sulfate is only 26% of that seen with intravenous injection. The half life of glucosamine is short and is less than one hour Irritation mechanisms that depend on the fast release into the stomach of the active substance contained in a tablet should be significantly off-set if the active substance is released slowly.<br>
Beneficial effects of Glucosamine slow and sustained release (SR) products:<br>
♦	Glucosamine SR product prevents stomach irritation due to controlled release of active release in the stomach.<br>
♦	Glucosamine SR product is not suddenly dissolved in its entirety at any given spot, and consequently does not give rise to any locally high concentration of the active substance.<br>
♦	Glucosamine SR composition is capable of forming a protective gel in the gastric environment. This composition acts as a stomach guard protecting the stomach lining from possible detrimental side effects of active substances such as glucosamine.<br>
Therapeutic Uses of Glucosamine:<br>
The formulation of the present invention is useful for the treatment of arthritis, including osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatism, tendonitis, bursitis, degenerative spinal disc disease, and trauma to joints, tendons, and ligaments, including sports trauma. Action of Glucosamine:<br>
Glucosamine is the main substrate for the biosynthesis of giycosaminoglycans and hyaluronic acid, the primary function of glucosamine is to stimulate the secretion of giycosaminoglycans in the particular cartilage. Therefore, glucosamine helps in addressing all arthritic related disorders such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatism, tendonitis, bursitis, degenerative spinal disc disease, trauma to joints, tendons and ligaments, including sports trauma. It was also found to provide natural protection against the cartilage-damaging effects of some NSAIDs.<br><br>
Market available products:<br>
•	Glucosamine IR tablets containing 250,400,500,750, 1000 mg and 1500 mg of glucosamine<br>
•	Glucosamine SR tablets containing l000mg and 1500mg<br>

&gt;	The core tablets were coated using organic solution of Eudragit RL 100 Eudragit RSI00 in Ethyl alcohol and purified talc as anti-adherent.<br>
&gt;	Products having strength of ISOOmg, lOOOmg, 750mg and 500mg were developed with Sustained Release of Glucosamine up to 12 hrs for ISOOmg, lOOOmg and 750mg strengths and 8hrs for SOOmg strength.<br>
&gt;	All the samples of the products developed were found to be relatively more stable when compared to products available in market.<br>
&gt;	Critical Process parameters: Drying of wet granules: LOD of dried granules must be between 0.5% to 4.5%, preferably between 1.0% to 3.5% and more preferably between 1.5% to 2.0%. Over dried granules produced tablets with more friability (more than 1.0%).<br>
&gt;	Optionally the formulations of instant invention can even be prepared using direct compression method followed by coating with the coating composition of the instant invention.<br>
The technology of the instant Application is further elaborated with the help of following examples. However, the examples should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br>
Step 3: Granulation<br>
Granulate the dry mix of step 2 with granulating solvent (isopropyl alcohol) by using<br>
Rapid Mixer Granulator (RMG). Step 4: Wet milling:<br>
Mill the wet mass through 8mm screen and collect in a double lined Polybag. Step 5: Drying:<br>
Dry granules of step 4 in Hot Air Oven at 45-50° C until optimum LOD is obtained. The LOD of dried granules must be between 0.5% to 4.5%, preferably between 1.0 % to 3.5 % and more preferably between 1.5 % to 2.0 %. Over dried granules produced tablets with more friability (more than 1.0%).<br>
Step 6: Dry milling:<br>
Mill the dried granules of step 5 through 2mm screen and collect in a double lined<br>
Polybag.<br>
Step 7: Dry Screening:<br>

Step 8: Lubrication:<br>
Add stearic acid powder to step 7 granules and blend for 3 minutes and collect into a<br>
HDPE containers containing doubled Lined polybag<br>
Step 9: Compression:<br>
Compress the granules of step 8<br>
Step 10: Preparation of coating Suspension:<br>
Disperse Eudragit RLIOO and Eudragit RSI00 in Ethanol.<br>
•	Stir for 90 min to dissolve.<br>
•	Add Purified talc to above clear solution.<br>
•	Stir for 5 min.<br>
•	Filter the above suspension through nylon cloth (200#). Step 11: Coating operation:<br>
Coat the core tablets of step 9 using coating solution of step 10 till achieving required weight gain and free from solvent.<br>
The coated tablets obtained were subjected for assay followed by carrying out dissolution studies using water as a solvent by United States Pharmacopoeia method. Here, the coating build up was made to have 25 mg and the dissolution profile had showed a release of 103.15 % at 12"^ hour. Thus, the prepared tablets were showing<br><br>
the controlled release up to 12 hours. In addition, any variation in concentration of components of composition had resulted in decrease in release of the drug as it is evident from the aforementioned example wherein it has shown a release of 50.71 % at 12* hour having a coating build up of 50mg for batch number (GHXA070107) El. Similarly the procedure is followed with other examples provided in the below tables with slight variation in the concentration of the actives and excipients/ additives.<br><br>
Here, the coating build up was made to have 15 mg and the dissolution profile had showed a release of 98.77 % at 12* hour. Thus, the prepared tablets were showing the controlled release up to 12 hours. In addition, any variation in concentration of components of composition had resulted in decrease in release of the drug as it is evident from the aforementioned example wherein it has shown a release of 69.55 % at 12* hour having a coating build up of 25mg for batch number: GHAU020307.<br><br><br>
Here, the coating build up was made to have 30 mg and the dissolution profile had showed a release of 99.69 % at 12"^ hour. Thus, the prepared tablets were showing the controlled release up to 12 hours. In addition, any variation in concentration of components of composition had resulted in decrease in release of the drug as it is evident from the aforementioned example wherein it has shown a release of 75.63 % at 12* hour having a coating build up of 40 mg for batch number GTS170207.<br><br><br>
Here, the coating build up was made to have 5 mg and the dissolution profile had showed a release of 97.99 % at 12"^ hour. Thus, the prepared tablets were showing the controlled release up to 12 hours. In addition, any variation in concentration of components of composition had resulted in decrease in release of the drug as it is evident from the aforementioned example wherein it has shown a release of 73.98 % at 8* hour having a coating build up of 15 mg for batch number (GHAUSO 10307)1.<br><br><br>
Here, the coating build up was made to have 20 mg and the dissolution profile had showed a release of 90.14 % at 12th hour. Thus, the prepared tablets were showing the controlled release up to 12 hours. In addition, any variation in concentration of components of composition had resulted in decrease in release of the drug as it is evident from the aforementioned example wherein it has shown a release of 99.02 % at 4th  hour having a coating build up of 10 mg for batch number GSSAO10307. Thus, this batch number GSSAO 10307was not able to provide a controlled release of glucosamine. Therefore, concentration of components in the composition and the coating build up for each of the dose strengths was a challenge which has been addressed by the application of instant invention.<br>
Any drastic variation in concentrations of the components of the composition may not result in even obtaining the solid dosage forms such as tablets etc. The present invention was successful in arriving at a concentration specific composition of<br><br>
ingredients so as to achieve a controlled release of glucosamine for a time-period of<br>
up to 12 hours.<br>
Example: 6 Stability data of Glucosamine HCI SR ISOOmg tablets.<br>
The details of the formulation subjected for stability studies.<br>
Batch No. 470375<br>
Batch Size: 5Lakh<br>
Pack: White HDPE container with child resistant closure<br><br>
It is evident from the aforementioned stability data that the product of the application of instant invention is indeed stable as it complies with its appearance, dissolution percentage release, assay values and microbial limit test parameters.<br><br><br><br>
