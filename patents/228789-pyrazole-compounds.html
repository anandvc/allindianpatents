CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims priority to US<br>
Provisional Patent Application 60/257,387 filed December<br>
21, 200C and US Provisional Patent Application 60/286, 949<br>
filed April 27, 2001, the contents of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The. present invention is in the field Of<br>
medicinal chemistry and relates to compounds that are<br>
protein kinase inhibitors, compositions containing nuch<br>
compounds and methods of use. More particularly, this<br>
invention relates to compounds that are inhibitors of<br>
Aurora-2 protein kinase. The invention also relates to<br>
methods of treating diseases associated with protein<br>
kinases, especially diseases associated with Aurora-2,<br>
such as cancer.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The search for new therapeutic agents has been<br>
greatly aided in recent years by better understanding of<br>
the structure of enzymes and other biomolecules<br>
associated with target diseases. One important class of<br>
enzymes that has been the subject cf extensive study is<br>
the protein kinases.<br>
Protein kinases mediate ir.trace bhulrr signal<br>
transduction. They do this by effecting a phosphoryl<br>
transfer from a nucleoside triphosphate to a protein<br>
acceptor that is involved in a signaling pathway. There<br>
are a number of kinases and pathways through which<br><br>
extracellular and other stimuli cause a variety of<br>
cellular responses to occur inside the cell. Examples of<br>
such stimuli include environmental and chemical stress<br>
signals(e.g. osmotic shock, heat shock, ultraviolet<br>
radiation, bacterial endotoxin, K2O2), cytokines(e.g.<br>
interleukin-1(IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor a(TNF-α)), and growth factors(e.g. granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor(GM-C3F), and fibroblast growth<br>
factor(FGF). An extracellular stimulus may effect one<br>
or more cellular responses related to ceil growth,<br>
migration, differentiation, secretion of hormones,<br>
activation of transcription factors, muscle contraction,<br>
glucose metabolism, control of protein synthesis and<br>
regulation of cell cycle.<br>
Many diseases are associated with abnormal<br>
cellular responses triggered by protein kinase-mediated<br>
events. These diseases include autoimmune diseases,<br>
inflammatory diseases, neurological and neurodegenerative<br>
diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies and<br>
asthma, Alzheimer's disease or hormone-related diseases.<br>
Accordingly, there has been a substantial effort in<br>
medicinal chemistry to find protein kinase inhibitors<br>
that are effective as therapeutic agents.<br>
Aurora-2 is a serine/threonine protein kinase<br>
that has been implicated in human cancer, such as colon,<br>
breast and other solid tumors. This kinase is believed<br>
to be involved in protein phosphorylation events that<br>
regulate the cell cycle. Specifically, Aurora-2 may play<br>
a role in controlling the accurate segregation of<br>
chromosomes during mitosis. Misregulation of the cell<br>
cycle can lead to cellular proliferation and other<br>
abnormalities. In human colon cancer tissue, the aurora-2 protein has been found to be overexpressed. See<br><br>
Bischoff et al., EMBO J., 1398, 17, 3052-3065; Schumacher<br>
et al . , J. Cell Biol., 1998, 143, 1635-1646; Kimura et<br>
al., J. Biol. Chem., 1997, 272, 13766-13771.<br>
Glycogen synthase kinase-3(GSK-3) is a<br>
serine/threonine protein kinase comprised of α and β<br>
isoforms that are each encoded by distinct genes [Coghlan<br>
et al., Chemistry &amp; Biology, 7, 793-303(2000); Kim and<br>
Kimmel, Curr. Opinion Genetics Dev. , 10, 508-514(2000)] .<br>
GSK-3 has been implicated in various diseases including<br>
diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, CNS disorders such as<br>
manic depressive disorder and neurodegenerative diseases,<br>
and cardiomyocete hypertrophy [WO 99/65897; WO 00/38675;<br>
and Haq et al., J. Cell Biol.(2000) 151, 117]. These<br>
diseases may be caused by, or result in, the abnormal<br>
operation of certain cell signaling pathways in which<br>
GSK-3 plays a role. GSK-3 has been found to<br>
phosphorylate and modulate the activity of a number of<br>
regulatory proteins. These proteins include glycogen<br>
synthase which is the rate limiting enzyme necessary for<br>
glycogen synthesis, the microtubule associated protein<br>
Tau, the gene transcription factor β-catenin, the<br>
translation initiation factor elF23, as well as ATP<br>
citrate lyase, axin, heat shock factor-1, c-Jun, c-Myc,<br>
c-Myb, CREB, and CEPBOt. These diverse protein targets<br>
implicate GSK-3 in many aspects of cellular metabolism,<br>
proliferation, differentiation and development.<br>
In a GSK-3 mediated pathway that is relevant<br>
for the treatment of type II diabetes, insulin-induced<br>
signaling leads to cellular glucose uptake and glycogen<br>
synthesis. Along this pathway, GSK-3 is a negative<br>
regulator of the insulin-induced signal. Normally, the<br>
presence of insulin causes inhibition of GSK-3 mediated<br><br>
phosphorylation and deactivation of glycogen synthase.<br>
The inhibition of GSK-3 leads to increased glycogen<br>
synthesis and glucose uptake [Klein et al., PNAS, 93,<br>
8455-9(1996); Cross et al., Biochem. J., 303, 21-25(1994); Cohen, Biochem. Soc. Trans., 21, 555-567(1993);<br>
Massillon et al., Biochem J. 299, 123-128(1994)].<br>
However, in a diabetic patient where the insulin response<br>
is impaired, glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake fail<br>
to increase despite the presence of relatively high blood<br>
levels of insulin. This leads to abnormally high blood<br>
levels of glucose with acute and long term effects that<br>
may ultimately result in cardiovascular disease, renal<br>
failure and blindness. In such patients, the normal<br>
insulin-induced inhibition of GSK-3 fails to occur. It<br>
has also been reported that in patients with type II<br>
diabetes, GSK-3 is overexpressed [WO 00/38675].<br>
Therapeutic inhibitors of GSK-3 therefore are considered<br>
to be useful for treating diabetic patients suffering<br>
from an impaired response to insulin.<br>
GSK-3 activity has also been associated with<br>
Alzheimer's disease. This disease is characterized by<br>
the well-known β-amyloid peptide and the formation of<br>
intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. The<br>
neurofibrillary tangles contain hyperphosphorylated Tau<br>
protein where Tau is phosphorylated on abnormal sites.<br>
GSK-3 has been shown to phosphorylate these abnormal<br>
sites in cell and animal models. Furthermore, inhibition<br>
of GSK-3 has been shown to prevent hyperphosphorylation<br>
of Tau in cells [Lovestone et al. , Current Biology 4,<br>
1077-86(1994); 3rownlees et al . , Neuroreport 8, 3251-55(1997)]. Therefore, it is believed that GSK-3 activity<br>
may promote generation of the neurofibrillary tangles and<br>
the progression of Alzheimer's disease.<br><br>
Another substrate of GSK-3 is β-catenin which<br>
is degradated after phosphorylation by GSK-3. Reduced<br>
levels of β-catenin have beer: reported in schizophrenic<br>
patients and have also been associated with other<br>
diseases related to increase in neuronal cell death<br>
[Zhong et al., Nature, 395, 598-702(1998); Takashima et<br>
al. , PNAS, 90, 7789-93(1993); Pei et al., J.<br>
Neuropathcl. Exp, 56, 7O-78(1997)].<br>
As a result of the biological importance of<br>
GSK-3, there is current interest in therapeutically<br>
effective GSK-3 inhbitors. Small molecules that inhibit<br>
GSK-3 have recently been reported [WO 99/65897(Chiron)<br>
and WO 00/38675(SmithKline Beecham)].<br>
For many of the aforementioned diseases<br>
associated with abnormal GSK-3 activity, other protein<br>
kinases have also been targeted for treating the same<br>
diseases. However, the various protein kinases often act<br>
through different biological pathways. For example,<br>
certain quinazoline derivatives have been reported<br>
recently as inhibitors of p38 kinase(WO 00/12497 to<br>
Scios). The compounds are reported to be useful for<br>
treating conditions characterized by enhanced p38-α<br>
activity and/or enhanced TGF-β activity. While p38<br>
activity has been implicated in a wide variety of<br>
diseases, including diabetes, p38 kinase is not reported<br>
to be a constituent of an insulin signaling pathway that<br>
regulates glycogen synthesis or glucose uptake.<br>
Therefore, unlike GSK-3, p38 inhibition would not be<br>
expected to enhance glycogen synthesis and/or glucose<br>
uptake.<br>
There is a continued need to find new<br>
therapeutic agents to treat human diseases. The protein<br><br>
kinases Aurora-2 and GSK-3 are especially attractive<br>
targets for the discovery of new therapeutics due to<br>
their important roles in cancer and diabetes,<br>
respectively.<br>

A "pharmaceutically acceptable derivative or<br>
prodrug" means any pharmaceutically acceptable salt,<br>
ester, salt of an ester or other derivative of a compound<br>
of this invention which, upon administration to a<br>
recipient, is capable of providing, either directly or<br>
indirectly, a compound of this invention or an<br>
inhibitorily active metabolite or residue thereof.<br>
Particularly favored derivatives or prodrugs are those<br>
that increase the bioavailability of the compounds of<br>
this invention when such compounds are administered to a<br>
patient(e.g., by allowing an orally administered<br>
compound to be more readily absorbed into the blood) or<br>
which enhance delivery of the parent compound to a<br>
biological compartment(e.g., the brain or lymphatic<br>
system) relative to the parent species.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of the<br>
compounds of this invention include, without limitation,<br>
the following derivatives of the present compounds:<br>
esters, amino acid esters, phosphate esters, metal salts<br>

themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be employed<br>
in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in<br>
obtaining the compounds of the invention and their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts.<br>
Salts derived from appropriate bases include<br>
alkali metal(e.g., sodium and potassium), alkaline earth<br>
metal(e.g., magnesium), ammonium and N+(C1-4 alkyl)4<br>
salts. This invention also envisions the quaternization<br>
of any basic nitrogen-containing groups of the compounds<br>
disclosed herein. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible<br>
products may be obtained by such quaternization.<br>
The amount of the protein kinase inhibitor that<br>
may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a<br>
single dosage form will vary depending upon the patient<br>
treated and the particular mode of administration.<br>
Preferably, the compositions should be formulated so that<br>
a dosage of between 0.01-100 mg/kg body weight/day of<br><br>
the inhibitor can be administered to a patient receiving<br>
these compositions.<br>
It should also be understood that a specific<br>
dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient<br>
will depend upon a variety of factors, including the<br>
activity cf the specific compound employed, the age, body<br>
weight, general health, sex, diet, time of<br>
administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and<br>
the judgment of the treating physician and the severity<br>
of the particular disease being treated. The amount of<br>
the inhibitor will also depend upon the particular<br>
compound in the composition.<br>
Depending upon the particular protein kinase-mediated condition to be treated or prevented, additional<br>
therapeutic agents, which are normally administered to<br>
treat or prevent that condition, may be administered<br>
together with the inhibitors of this invention. For<br>
example, in the treatment of cancer other<br>
chemotherapeutic agents or other anti-proliferative<br>
agents may be combined with the present compounds to<br>
treat cancer. These agents include, without limitation,<br>
adriamycin, dexamethasone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide,<br>

Scheme III above shows another alternative<br>
route for preparing the present compounds. The starting<br>
material 6 may be chlorinated to provide intermediate 7.<br>
Displacement of the 4-chloro group in 7 with<br>
aminopyrazole (or aminoindazole) 2 gives intermediate 8<br>
which, upon oxidation of the methylsulfanyl group,<br>
provides the methylsulfone 9. The methylsulfonyl group<br>
of 9 may be displaced readily with R1-QH to give the<br>
desired product I. See J. Am. Chem. Soc, 81, 5997-6006<br>
(1959) (where Q is an N-Link)or in Bioorg. Med. Chem.<br>

Scheme IV above shows a general route for the<br>
preparation of the present compounds wherein Ry is a group<br>
attached to the pyrimidine core via a nitrogen, oxygen or<br>
sulfur heteroatom. The starting 4,6-dihydroxy-2-methylsulfanylpyrimidine 10 may be prepared as described<br>
in J. Med. Chem. , 27, 12, 1621-1629 (1984). The chloro<br>
groups of intermediate 11 may be displaced sequentially<br>
with aminopyrazole (or aminoindazole) 2 and then with<br>
another amine (or alcohol or thiol) following procedures<br>
similar to those reported in US Patent 2585906 (ICI,<br>
1949) . The methylsulfanyl group of 13 may then be<br>
oxidized to provide the methylsulfone 14. Displacement<br>
of the methylsulfonyl group of 14 gives the desired<br>
product II.<br><br><br>
Scheme V above shows general routes for the<br>
preparation of compounds of formulae IVa, IVb, IVc, and<br>
