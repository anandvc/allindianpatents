Background<br>
[0003] Modulation of immune response has become an important anti-cancer<br>
strategy. A significant effort in the design of cancer vaccines and immunotherapies<br>
has focused on the identification of antigens that are selectively present in tumor<br>
cells. Unique tumor immunogenicity has permitted induction of tumor-specific<br>
immune responses using vaccines that include tumor-specific antigens, or genes<br>
expressing tumor-specific antigens. Vaccination approaches have also included<br>
adoptive cellular methods, whereby antigen-presenting cells are modified to present<br>
tumor-associated antigens. Additional immunological strategies for cancer treatment<br>
include administration of cytokines and chemokines, which have therapeutic<br>
potential as adjuvants or treatments in anti-cancer therapies based on their ability to<br>
expand and recruit immune effector cells. See e.g., Homey et al. (2002) Nat Rev<br>
Immunol 2:175-84; Parmiani et al. (2002) J Natl Cancer Inst 94:805-18; Bronte<br>
(2001) Curr Gone Ther 1:53-100; and Fehniger et al. (2002) Cytokine Growth Factor<br>
Rev 13:169-83.<br>
[0004] Notwithstanding the above-noted advances, the success of immunological<br>
approaches has been limited by: (1) tumor-specific antigenicity, such that therapies<br>
are limited to particular cancer types; (2) poor antigen presentation by tumor cells;<br>
and (3) and the ability of tumor cells to produce immune inhibitory factors to thereby<br>
escape immune surveillance. Thus, there exists a long-felt and continuing need in<br>
the art for effective and broadly applicable cancer therapies. To meet this need, the<br>
present invention provides novel immunostimulatory methods for cancer treatment<br>
and prevention.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0031] Figure 1 depicts a line graph, which shows that bacuiovirus-expressed CCL21<br>
inhibits tumor growth and Induces complete tumor remission in a 3LL mouse mode!<br>
of lung cancer. As described in Example 2, CCL21 administration included 6<br>
intratumoral injections of CCL21 at the concentrations indicated. Increasing the<br>
dose per injection increased tumor inhibition and the frequency of complete<br>
responses. One way ANOVA analysis was performed using data collected on day<br>
24. Albumin compared with treated groups, P

CCL21, as described in Example 3. rhCCL21, reoombinant human CCL21; qd,<br>

Example 6. Solid bars, animals that did not undergo surgical resection of the tumor;<br>
hatched bars, animals in which tumors were surgically resected (Surg) 1 day after<br>
the last dose of CCL21.<br>
[0034] Figure 4 depicts a line graph, which shows that administration of baculovirus-<br>
expressed CCL21 imparts resistance to tumor re-challenge, as described in Example<br>
5. Briefly, 4T1 tumors were established in Balb/c mice, and a subset of host mice<br>
were treated via intratumoral administration of baculovirus-expressed CCL21. One<br>
day after the last dose of CCL21, tumors were surgically resected. One day after<br>
tumor resection, mice were re-challenged with s.c. injection of 4T1 cells at a site<br>
contralateral to the original tumor. Naifve, mice that had not previously hosted a<br>
tumor and which did not receive CCL21 treatment; Alb + Surg + Re-chlg, mice that<br>
had previously hosted a 4T1 tumor and that received albumin treatment; hCCL21 +<br>
Surg + Re-chlg, mice that had previously hosted a 4T1 tumor and that received<br>
CCL21 treatment In the Alb + Surg + Re-chlg group, 1 of 10 mice showed complete<br>
resistance to tumor growth. In the hCCL21 + Surg + Re-chlg group, 6 of 10 mice<br>
showed complete resistance to tumor growth.<br>
[0035] Figures 5A-5B demonstrate baculovirus-induced resistance to tumor re-<br>
challenge. In the 3LL tumor model, animals that have been successfully treated with<br>
baculovirus-derived CCL21 are resistant to re-challenge with the same tumor for<br>
prolonged periods. Figure 5A summarizes experiments with animals that had a<br>
complete remission of tumors after treatment with baculovirus-derived mouse<br>
recombinant CCL21 (see e.g., Figure 1), and were re-cha!lenged in the opposite<br>
flank with the same tumor at 60, 70 and 80 days following the last dose of<br>
baculovirus-derived CCL21. Animals were resistant to re-challenge for at least 70<br>
days. Figure 5B summarizes experiments with animals that received an inoculation<br>
30 days following completion of baculovirus CCL21 treatment and induction of<br>
complete remission ("tumor boost"), and that were re-challenged in the opposite<br>
flank with the same tumor at 80, 120, 160 and 200 days following the last dose of<br>
baculovirus-derived CCL21. These results demonstrate that resistance to tumor re-<br>
challenge can be extended to at least 200 days by using a tumor boost<br>
[0036] Figure 6 depicts a line graph, which shows that CCL21 produced in yeast or<br>
E. coli does not result in tumor remission in a 3LL tumor model of lung cancer.<br>

as therapeutic agents. Chemokines are a family of homologous proteins whose<br>
functions include: (a) mediating lymphocyte migration and activation; (2) regulating<br>
angiogenesis; (c) and maintaining immune homeostasis and secondary lymphoid<br>
organ architecture. See Baggiolini et al. (1997) Annu Rev Immunol 15:675-705;<br>
Jung &amp; Littman (1999) Curr Opin Immunol 11:319-25; and Homey et al. (2002) Nat<br>
Rev Immunol 2:175-84.<br>
[0054] In the course of developing cancer immunotherapies that employ Secondary<br>
Lymphoid Tissue Chemokine (referred to herein as "CCL21;" also known in the art<br>
as SLC, Exodus-2, and 6C-kine), as described in Examples 1-6, the inventors of the<br>
subject disclosure came to the surprising discovery that non-pathogenic viruses are<br>
potent anti-tumor agents. See Example 7.<br>
[0055]Thus, the present invention provides, inter a//a, methods for treating a subject<br>
in need of anti-cancer therapy, including inhibition of cancer growth, inhibition of<br>
cancer metastasis, and cancer resistance, via administration of a non-pathogenic<br>
virus to the subject. Significantly, the cancer immunotherapies disclosed herein do<br>
not rely on identification of tumor-specific antigens. Rather, administration of non-<br>
pathogenic viruses is broadly applicable and is efficacious in multiple tumor types.<br>
See Examples 2-6.<br>
[0056] While the inventors do not wish to be bound to a particular mode of operation,<br>
the inventors suggest that the anti-cancer activity of non-pathogenic viruses is<br>
attributable, at least in part, to their immunostimulatory properties. For example,<br>
baculovirus activates dendritic cell maturation and cytolytic T cell (CTL) responses<br>
both in vitro and in vivo. See Examples 9-10. See also Gronowski et al. (1999) J<br>
Virol. 73:9944-51.<br>
[0057] The term "virus," as used herein to describe an effective anti-tumor<br>
composition, encompasses live virus, inactivated virus, virus particles, viral occlusion<br>
bodies, virosomes, Viral Like Particles, viral components, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0058]Virosomes and Virus Like Particles (VLPs) generally contain one or more<br>
proteins from a non-pathogenic virus optionally combined or formulated with a<br>
phospholipid. In some embodiments virosomes and VLPs are non-replicating and<br>
do not contain any of the native viral genome. The viral proteins may be<br>
recombinantly produced or isolated from whole viruses. VLPs are discussed further<br>
in WO 03/024480, WO 03/024481, Niikura et al.,"(Chimeric Recombinant Hepatitis E<br>
Virus-Like Particles as an Oral Vaccine Vehicle Presenting Foreign Epitopes",<br>

for example, Gluck et al., (New Technology Platforms in the Development of<br>
Vaccines for the Future, Vaccine (2002) 20:B10-B16.)<br>
[0059] The term "live virus" refers to a virus whose infectivity is similar or identical to<br>
a native virus. In particular, a live virus can infect its native host cells.<br>
[0060]The term "inactivated virus" refers to a virus that is incapable of replication in<br>
a native host cell, as described further herein below. For example, a non-pathogenic<br>
virus, which is incapable of replication in a mammalian host cell, is similarly<br>
incapable of replication in it native host cell upon being inactivated. Inactivated<br>
viruses can be used to minimize safety concerns regarding administration of live<br>
viruses. An "inactivator" is the agent utilised to inactivate the virus.<br>
[0061]The term "virus particle" refers to a virus that has been constructed, or<br>
modified from jis native form, whereby it is unable to replicate in naturally occurring<br>
host cells. Methods for preparing virus particles are known in the art. The structural<br>
and functional integrity of virus-like particles can be assessed by electron<br>
microscopy, immunogenicity analyses, and standard plaque assays. For example,<br>
Hamakubo, et. al WO 02/06305 discuss generation of enucleated baculovinal-like<br>
particles.<br>
[0062]U.S. Patent No. 5,750.383 discloses methods for preparing baculovirus<br>
particles using a marker-rescue system. The method employs a genetically modified<br>
baculovirus, which lacks a gene essential for viral replication (e.g., gp64), and which<br>
is propagated in cells that complement the genetic deficiency.<br>
[0063]The term "viral occlusion body" refers to a structure comprising a multiplicity of<br>
viral particles embedded within a virus-encoded proteinaceous crystal. Upon<br>
dissolution of the protein crystal, the multiplicity of viral particles is released, and<br>
each viral particle is capable of subsequent infection of a host cell.<br>
[0064] Production of viruses, and in particular baculoviruses, is accomplished using<br>
techniques well known in the art Cloned cell lines are provided in a culture medium<br>
in vitro, inoculated with virus, and incubated for a sufficient time and under conditions<br>
effective to allow viral production. Culture conditions, including cell density,<br>
multiplicity of infection, time, temperature, media, etc. are not critical and can be<br>
readily determined by a practitioner skilled in the art.<br>
[0065] Representative methods for baculovirus production are described in Example<br>
1, which employ Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf) cells. Additional representative host<br>
cells and amplification methods are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,405,770<br>
(Heliothis subflexa cell line) and 6,379,958 (Spodoptera frugiperda cell lines, which<br>
show improved baculovirus production).<br>
[0066]Following incubation, the viral agents so produced are recovered by<br>
techniques conventional in the art, including polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation,<br>
ultracentrifugation, and chromatographic purification, such as use of an ion<br>
exchange resin, size exclusion chromatography, affinity chromatography, or<br>
combinations thereof. See U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0015945<br>
(chromatographic purification); U.S. Patent No. 6,194,192 (viral adsorption to<br>
sulfated-fucose"Containing polysaccharide(s)).<br>
[0067]The term "viral component," as used herein, refers to a molecule that is<br>
derived from a non-pathogenic virus and that retains anti-tumor and/or anti-infectious<br>
disease activity of the parent live virus. In some embodiments, a viral component<br>
comprises anti-tumor activity that is similar in magnitude and specificity of response<br>
when compared to that elicited by the parent live virus from which it was derived.<br>
The term "viral component" encompasses any biological component of a virus<br>
including, for example, one or more of a protein, a peptide, a nucleic acid, a lipid, a<br>
carbohydrate, any other bioactive molecule of a virus, and combinations thereof. In<br>
some embodiments, the viral component is gp64.<br>
[0068] For example, a viral component can comprise a viral capsid protein or a DNA-<br>
assodated protein of the viral nucleoprotein core. Representative baculoviral capsid<br>
proteins are described by Pearson et al. (1988) Virology 167:407-13; by Summers &amp;<br>
Smith (1978) Virology 84:390-402; by Thiem &amp; Miller (1989) J Virol 63:2008-18; and<br>
by Vialard &amp; Richardson (1993) J Virol 67:5859-66. Representative baculoviral<br>
DNA-associated proteins are described by Tweeten et al. (1980) J Virol 33:866-876;<br>
by Wilson et al. (1987) J Virol 61:661-6; and by Rohrmann (1992) J Gen Virol 73 (Pt<br>
4):749-61.<br>
[0069]A viral component can also comprise proteins and carbohydrates found in<br>
viral occlusion bodies, including the occlusion body matrix and the calyx outer layer<br>
found in mature occlusion bodies. Representative baculovirus occlusion body<br>
proteins include polyhedron and calyx.<br>
[0070]Following a review of the disclosure herein, which provides that non-<br>
pathogenic viruses have potent anti-tumor activity and/or anti-infectious disease<br>
activity, a skilled artisan could readily identify, purify or otherwise prepare, and<br>
administer viral components to recapitulate the anti-tumor activity and/or anti-<br>
infectious disease of the parent live virus. For example, as one approach, U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,001,806 discloses biochemical methods for fractionating baculovirus-<br>
infected insect cells, and then using the eluate fractions in assays to identify a<br>
glycoprotein that mimics the anti-viral activity previously recognized in the parent live<br>
virus.<br>
[0071] In addition, viral proteins and nucleic acids are readily prepared using<br>
recombinant methods known in the art and can be similarly tested for anti-cancer<br>
and/or anti-infectious disease activity. For example, viral nucleic acids can be<br>
cloned, synthesized, altered, mutagenized, or combinations thereof. Standard<br>
recombinant DNA and molecular cloning techniques used to isolate nucleic acids<br>
can be found, for example, in Sambrook et al. (eds.) (1989) Molecular Cloning: A<br>

York; Silhavy et al. (1984) Experiments with Gene Fusions. Cold Spring Harbor<br>

and characterized using a variety of standard techniques that are known to the<br>
skilled artisan. See e.g., Schroder &amp; Lübke (1965) The Peptides. Academic Press,<br>

[0072] In particular, the complete sequence of AcNPV is known (Kool and Vlak,<br>
1993), and thus a systematic analysis of all AcNPV proteins can be readily<br>
performed using known methods for recombinant expression in combination with<br>
assays for anti-tumor activity.<br>
[0073]To facilitate identification of active viral components, the present invention<br>
further provides an in vitro assay that can be used to screen candidate viral<br>
components. See Example 8. The assay involves induction of cytotoxicity by<br>
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). As disclosed herein, a non-<br>
pathogenic virus can induce cytotoxictty of tumor cells by PBMCs, and this activity<br>
correlates with anti-tumor activity observed upon in vivo administration. Candidate<br>
viral components include, for example, biochemical fractions of a non-pathogenic<br>
. virus, purified or recornbinantly produced viral proteins, purified or synthesized<br>
nudeic acids, virosomes, Virus Like Particles, and the like.<br>
[0074] The term "non-pathogenic," as used herein to describe a virus, refers to a<br>
virus that is not infectious in a mammalian host to be treated with the virus, and in<br>
some embodiments, a non-pathogenic virus is not infectious in any mammalian host<br>
In some embodiments, a non-pathogenic virus is not infectious in a human host<br>
For the sake of convenience, unless otherwise indicated, the term "non-pathogenic"<br>
virus includes inactivated virus, virus particles, viral occlusion bodies, virosomes,<br>
Viral Like Particles, viral components, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0075] The term "infectious" generally refers to a property of being deleterious to a<br>
host cell or organism, for example by expression of genes that are deleterious to the<br>
host cell or organism and/or by replication in the host. Consistent with this definition,<br>
non-pathogenicity does not preclude entry into a mammalian cell, wherein such entry<br>
does not compromise the health of the host cell or organism. However, in some<br>
embodiments, a non-infectious virus does not enter into a mammalian cell.<br>
[0076] A non-pathogenic virus, for example baculovirus, can also be transcriptionally<br>
silent in mammalian host cells. Thus, in some embodiments, a non-pathogenic virus<br>
can be a type of virus that is specifically excluded from current gene therapy<br>
methods, as heterologous genes are also not expressed.<br>
[0077] Examples of non-pathogenic viruses include, but are not limited to, insect-<br>
specific viruses, amphibian-specific viruses, and plant-specific viruses.<br>
Representative viruses useful in the methods disclosed herein include viruses of the<br>
family Baculoviridae (e.g., nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPV) such as Autographa<br>
califomtca NPV, and granuloviruses (GV) such as Trichoplusia ni GV),<br>
Polydnaviridae (e.g., ichnoviruses such as Campoletis sonorensis virus, and<br>
bracoviruses such as Cotesia melanoscela virus), Ascoviruses, Tetraviridae, and<br>
Nodaviridae (e.g., nodaviruses such as Nodamura virus and Rock House Virus). A<br>
number of non-pathogenic viruses useful in the present invention are found in<br>
insects. See Fields et al., eds. (1996) Virology, Lippincott-Rave Publishers,<br>
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.<br>
[0078]The term "infectious disease" refers to an agent (e.g. virus, fungi or bacteria)<br>
that is deleterious to its host. In some embodiments the agent is deleterious to a<br>
human host. An "anti-infectious disease" treatment refers to a treatment that<br>
prevents, ameliorates or eradicates the infectious disease and/or its disease-causing<br>
agent.<br>
[0079] Examples of infectious diseases include without limitation, HIV, West Nile<br>
virus, hepatitis A, B, C, small pox, tuberculosis, Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV),<br>
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), human papilloma virus (HPV), SARS, influenza,<br>
Ebola, viral meningitis, herpes, anthrax, lyme disease, and E. Coli., among others.<br>
[0080] In some embodiments, a non-pathogenic virus comprises a baculovirus. As<br>
described in the Examples below, the present invention provides that baculovirus is<br>
a potent inhibitor of tumor growth and can promote complete tumor remission. The<br>
present invention further provides that baculovirus can be used to inhibit tumor<br>
metastasis and to promote resistance to tumor re-challenge, as described in<br>
Examples 5-6.<br>
[0081]As used herein, the term "tumor re-challenge" refers to animal whose cancer<br>
or tumor has been treated or removed and then is exposed to a new tumor. In<br>
accordance with the definition provided herein above, the term "baculovirus"<br>
encompasses baculovirus particles and baculovirus components.<br>
[0082]The host specificity of baculovirus has been thoroughly studied. Although<br>
baculovirus is known to infect over 30 species of Lepidoptera, it is not thought to be<br>
competent to replicate in other Insect cells or in any of the over 35 mammalian cell<br>
lines studied. See Tjia et al. (1983) Virology 125:107-17; Volkman &amp; Goldsmith<br>
(1983) Appl Environ Microbiol 45:1085-1093; and Mclntosh &amp; Shamy (1980)<br>
Intervirology 13:331-41. Baculovirus does, however, enter mammalian cells and<br>
viral DNA can be detected in the host cell nucleus. See Graner et al. (1984)<br>
Intervirology 21:203-9; Tjia et al. (1983) Virology 125:107-17; and Volkman &amp;<br>
Goldsmith (1983) Appl Environ Micrablol 45:1085-93.<br>
[0083]The term "non-pathogenic" further encompasses viruses, which are<br>
pathogenic in their native form, and which have been modified to be non-pathogenic.<br>
Such modification can include genetic modification (e.g., disruption of a gene that is<br>
essential for viral replication, as described herein above for the baculovirus gp64<br>
gene; and/or disruption of a viral promoter to render it transcripfionally Inactive in the<br>
host species). For example, the species-specific pathogenicity of baculovirus is due<br>
in part to silence of the bacuiovirus promoter in species, other than Lepidoptera.<br>
When a heterologous promoter is inserted into baculovirus genome, the modified<br>
virus becomes capable of gene expression in non-Lepidopteran cell lines, including<br>
various mammalian cell lines. See Boyce &amp; Bucher (1996) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA<br>
93:2348-52; Carbonell et al. (1985) J Viral 56:153-60; Carbonell &amp; Miller (1987) Appl<br>
Environ Microbiol 53:1412-7; and Hofmann et al. (1995) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA<br>
92:10099-103. A viral promoter that is initially active in mammalian cells could be<br>
similarly modified to the opposite result, whereby it is no longer pathogenic in<br>
mammalian species. Methods for site-specific mutagenesis to create base pair<br>
changes, deletions, or small insertions are also known in the art, for example as<br>
described in the references noted herein above.<br>
[0084] Modified viruses, as well as unmodified viruses that are suspected to be non-<br>
pathogenic, can be readily assayed for non-pathogenicity using methods for<br>
determining viral infectivity and replication known in the art. Representative methods<br>
can be found, for example, in Tjia et al. (1983) Virology 125:107-17; Volkman &amp;<br>
Goldsmith (1983) Appl Environ Microblol 45:1085-93; Mclntoah &amp; Shamy (1980)<br>
Intervirology 13:331-41; and U.S. Patent No. 6,248,514, among other places.<br>
[0085]The present invention also provides non-pathogenic viruses having anti-<br>
cancer activity and/or anti-infectious disease activity and/or adjuvant activity,<br>
including live viruses, inactive viruses, viral particles, virosomes, VLPs, viral<br>
occlusion bodies, and viral components. Also provided are methods for selecting a<br>
non-pathogenic virus useful in the therapeutic methods described herein.<br>
[0086]To select a non-pathogenic virus having anti-cancer activity, candidate non-<br>
pathogenic viruses can be tested using an in vitro or in vivo assay of tumor cytolysis,<br>
as described in Example 8, and/or an in vivo or in vivo model of anti-cancer activity,<br>
for example as described in the Examples. In some embodiments, an in vitro assay<br>
can be used as an initial screen, and then viruses that are active in vitro can be<br>
subsequently tested in relevant animal models to assess anti-cancer activity.<br>
[0087]To select a non-pathogenic virus having adjuvant activity, candidate non-<br>
pathogenic viruses can be tested for ability to enhance immunogenicity of an<br>
antigen. Immunogenicity can be determined by, for example, detecting T cell-<br>
mediated responses. Representative methods for measuring T cell responses<br>
include in vitro cytotoxicity assays or in vivo delayed-type hypersensrtivity assays. In<br>
some embodiments, for example, CCL21 in combination with a non-pathogenic virus<br>
can induce in vitro cytotoxicity of tumor cells by PBMCs, and this activity correlates<br>
with anti-tumor activity upon in vivo administration. Other antigens may substitute for<br>
CCL21. Immunogenicity can also be assessed by detection of antigen-specific<br>
antibodies in a subject's serum, and/or by a demonstration of protective effects of<br>
antisera or immune cells specific for the antigen. In some embodiments, a non-<br>
pathogenic virus enhances immunogenicity of ah antigen by at least about 2-fold,<br>
about 5-fold, about 10-fold, about 25-fold, or about 100-fold.<br>
[0088] In some embodiments, non-pathogenic viruses are inactivated, as described<br>
further herein below. Non-pathogenic viruses, which show anti-cancer, can be<br>
subjected to any one of a variety of inactivation methods to render the virus<br>
incapable of infecting its native host cell. Using the assays disclosed herein, a<br>
skilled artisan can select an inactivation method that preserves anti-cancer activity of<br>
the virus. In some embodiments, inactivation methods permit viral entry into host<br>
ceils, and disrupt transcription and/or replication of the viral genome. In some<br>
embodiments, a virus is genetically modified such that it is capable of cellular entry,<br>
but is unable to undergo normal transcription and/or replication.<br>
A2. Anti-infectious Disease Activity of Non-Pathogenic Viruses<br>
[0089] Current approaches to treatment of infectious diseases indude the use of<br>
medicaments that cause adverse or undesirable side effects. Additionally, many<br>
effective therapies including vaccination are specific for only a single infectious agent<br>
or agents closely related thereto. The inventors of the subject disclosure came to the<br>
surprising discovery that non-pathogenic viruses are also potent against infectious<br>
diseases. See Example 17.<br>
[0090]To select a non-pathogenic virus having anti-infectious disease activity,<br>
candidate non-pathogenic viruses can be tested using an in vitro or in vivo assay of<br>
the infectious disease which are well known by those of skill in the art. For example,<br>
for tuberculosis, a rabbit TB model or an in vitro Macrophage Model may be used to<br>
test for anti-infectious disease activity. Abe et al., (Journal of Immunology, 2003,<br>
171: 1133-1139) discuss other assays suitable for testing compounds for activity<br>
against infectious diseases.<br>
[0091] In some embodiments, an in vitro assay can be used as an initial screen, and<br>
then viruses that are active in vitro can be subsequently tested in relevant animal<br>
models to assess anti-infectious disease activity.<br>
[0092]Thus, the present invention provides, inter alia, methods for treating a subject<br>
in need of anti-infectious disease therapy via administration of a non-pathogenic<br>
virus to the subject. Significantly, the non-pathogenic viruses with anti-infectious<br>
disease activity disclosed herein do not appear to rely on identification of antigens<br>
specific to an infectious agent Rather, administration of non-pathogenic viruses is<br>
broadly applicable.<br>
[0093] While the inventors do not wish to be bound to a particular mode of operation,<br>
the inventors suggest that the anti-infectious disease activity of non-pathogenic<br>
viruses is attributable, at least in part, to their immunostimulatory properties. For<br>
example, baculovirus activates dendritic cell maturation and cytolytic T cell (CTL)<br>
responses both in vitro and in vivo. See Examples 9-10.<br>
B. Therapeutic Applications<br>
[0094] The present invention provides methods for treating a cancer-bearing<br>
mammalian subject via administration of a non-pathogenic virus to the subject. The<br>
disclosed methods are useful for, for example, inhibiting cancer growth, including<br>
complete cancer remission, for inhibiting cancer metastasis, and for promoting<br>
cancer resistance.<br>
[0095] The present invention provides methods for treating a subject having one or<br>
more infectious diseases via administration of a non-pathogenic virus to the subject.<br>
The disclosed methods are useful for, for example, inhibiting viral replication, inhibit<br>
fungal growth.<br>
[0096]The term "cancer growth" generally refers to any one of a number of indices<br>
that suggest change within the cancer to a more developed form. Thus, indices for<br>
measuring an inhibition of cancer growth include but are not limited to a decrease in<br>
cancer cell survival, a decrease in tumor volume or morphology (for example, as<br>
determined using computed tomographic (CT), sonography, Or other imaging<br>
method), a delayed tumor growth, a destruction of tumor vasculature, improved<br>
performance in delayed hypersensitivity skin test, an increase in the activity of<br>
cytolytic T-lymphocytes, and a decrease in levels of tumor-specific antigens.<br>
[0097] The term "delayed tumor growth" refers to a decrease in duration of time<br>
required for a tumor to grow a specified amount For example, treatment can delay<br>
the time required for a tumor to increase in volume 3-fold relative to an initial day of<br>
measurement (day 0) or the time required to grow to 1 cm3.<br>
[0098]The term "cancer resistance" refers to an improved capacity of a subject to<br>
resist cancer growth, in particular growth of a cancer already had. Alternatively<br>
stated, the term "cancer resistance" refers to a decreased propensity for cancer<br>
growth in a subject Cancer resistance is associated with induction of an adaptive<br>
immune response, as described herein below.<br>
[0099] The term "subject" as used herein includes any mammalian species. In some<br>
embodiments, the methods of the present invention are contemplated for the<br>
treatment of cancers and/or infectious diseases in mammals such as humans, as<br>
well as those mammals of importance due to being endangered, of economical<br>
importance and/or social importance to humans.<br>
[00100] The term "cancel" generally refers to. tumors, including both primary and<br>
metastasized tumors. In some embodiments, the tumor is a solid tumor. The term<br>
"tumor" encompasses solid tumors and carcinomas of any tissue in a subject,<br>
including but not limited to breast; colon; rectum; lung; oropharynx; hypopharynx;<br>
esophagus; stomach; pancreas; liver; gallbladder, bile ducts; small intestine; urinary<br>
tract including kidney, bladder and urothelium; female genital tract including cervix,<br>
uterus, ovaries (e.g., choriocarcinoma and gestational trophoblastic disease); male<br>
genital tract including prostate, seminal vesicles, testes and germ cell tumors;<br>
endocrine glands including thyroid, adrenal, and pituitary; skin (e.g., hemangiomas<br>
and melanomas), bone or soft tissues; blood vessels (e.g., Kaposi's sarcoma); brain,<br>
nerves, eyes, and meninges (e.g., astrocytomas, gliomas, glioblastomas,<br>
retinoblastomas, neuromas, neuroblastomas, Schwannomas and meningiomas).<br>
[00101] The term "tumor" also encompasses solid tumors arising from<br>
hematopoietic malignancies such as leukemias, including chloromas,<br>
plasmacytomas, plaques and tumors of mycosis fungoides and cutaneous T-cell<br>
lymphorna/Ieukemia, multiple myeloma, and lymphomas including both Hodgkin's<br>
and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.<br>
[00102] The term "cancer," as used herein, also encompasses non-neopiastic<br>
proliferative disorders. Thus, the methods of the present invention are contemplated<br>
for the treatment or prevention of hyperplasia, metaplasia, or most particularly,<br>
dysplasia (for review of such abnormal growth conditions, see Robbins &amp; Angeli<br>
(1976) Basic Pathology, 2d Ed., pp. 68-79, W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia,<br>
Pennsylvania).<br>
[00103] Hyperplasia is a form of controlled ceil proliferation involving an increase<br>
in cell number in a tissue or organ, without significant alteration in structure or<br>
function. As one non-limiting example, endometrial hyperplasia often precedes<br>
endometrial cancer. Metaplasia is a form of controlled cell growth in which one type<br>
of adult or fully differentiated cell substitutes for another type of adult cell.<br>
Metaplasia can occur in epithelial or connective tissue cells. Atypical metaplasia<br>
involves a somewhat disorderly metaplastic epithelium. Dysplasia is frequently a<br>
forerunner of cancer, and is found mainly in the epithelia; it is the most disorderly<br>
form of non-neoplastic cell growth, involving a loss in individual cell uniformity and in<br>
the architectural orientation of cells. Dysplastic cells often have abnormally large,<br>
deeply stained nuclei, and exhibit pleomorphism. Dysplasia characteristically occurs<br>
where there exists chronic irritation or inflammation, and is often found in the cervix,<br>
respiratory passages, oral cavity, and gall bladder. Although preneoplastic lesions<br>
can progress to neoplasia, they can also remain stable for long periods and can<br>
even regress, particularly if the inciting agent is removed or if the lesion succumbs to<br>
an immunological attack by its host<br>
[00104] Thus, administration of a non-pathogenic virus to a subject as disclosed<br>
herein can elicit an innate anti-cancer immune response or an adaptive, cancer-<br>
specific immune response. The term Immune system" includes all the cells, tissues,<br>
systems, structures and processes, including non-specific and specific categories,<br>
that provide a defense against cells comprising antigenic molecules, including but<br>
not limited to tumors, pathogens, and self-reactive cells. Thus, an immune response<br>
can comprise an innate immune response, an adaptive immune response, or a<br>
combination thereof.<br>
[00105] The term "innate immune system" includes phagocytic cells such as<br>
neutrophils, monocytes, tissue macrophages, Kupffer cells, alveolar macrophages,<br>
dendritic cells, and microglia. The innate immune system mediates non-specific<br>
immune responses. The innate immune system plays an important role in initiating<br>
and guiding responses of the adaptive immune system. See e.g., Janeway (1989)<br>
Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol 54:1-13; Romagnani (1992) Immunol Today<br>
13:379-381; Fearon &amp; Locksley (1996) Science 272:50-53; and Fearon (1997)<br>
Nature 388:323-324. An innate response can comprise, for example, dendritic cell<br>
maturation, macrophage activation, cytokine or chemokine secretion, and/or<br>
activation of NFKB signaling.<br>
[00106] The term "adaptive immune system" refers to the cells and tissues that<br>
impart specific immunity within a host. Included among these cells are natural killer<br>
(NK) cells and lymphocytes (e.g., B cell lymphocytes and T cell lymphocytes). The<br>
term "adaptive immune system" also includes antibody-producing cells and the<br>
antibodies produced by the antibody-producing cells.<br>
[00107] The term "adaptive immune response" refers to a specific response to an<br>
antigen include humoral immune responses (e.g., production of antigen-specific<br>
antibodies) and cell-mediated immune responses (.e.g., lymphocyte proliferation), as<br>
defined herein below. An adaptive immune response can further comprise systemic<br>
immunity and humoral immunity.<br>
[00108] The terms "cell-mediated immunity" and "cell-mediated immune response"<br>
refer to the immunologica! defense provided by lymphocytes, such as that defense<br>
provided by T cell lymphocytes when they come into close proximity to their victim<br>
cells. A cell-mediated immune response also comprises lymphocyte proliferation.<br>
When "lymphocyte proliferation" is measured, the ability of lymphocytes to proliferate<br>
in response to specific antigen is measured. Lymphocyte proliferation is meant to<br>
refer to B cell, T-helper cell or CTL cell proliferation.<br>
[00109] The term "CTL response", as used herein refers to the ability of an<br>
antigen-specific cell to lyse and kill a cell expressing the specific antigen. As<br>
described herein, standard, art-recognized CTL assays are performed to measure<br>
CTL activity.<br>
[00110] The term "systemic immune response", as used herein, refers to an<br>
immune response in the lymph node-, spleen-, or gut-associated lymphoid tissues<br>
wherein cells, such as B lymphocytes, of the immune system are developed. For<br>
example, a systemic immune response can comprise the production of serum<br>
immunoglobulins (IgGs). Further, systemic immune response refers to antigen-<br>
specific antibodies circulating in the blood stream and antigen-specific cells in<br>
lymphoid tissue in systemic compartments such as the. spleen and lymph nodes.<br>
[00111] The terms "humoral immunity" or "humoral immune response" are meant<br>
to refer to the form of acquired immunity in which antibody molecules are secreted in<br>
response to antigenic stimulation.<br>
[00112] The term "cancer-specific," as used herein to describe an adaptive<br>
immune response, refers to a cell-mediated or humoral immune response in a<br>
subject, wherein the response is directed specifically to a cancer previously present<br>
in the subject. Given that innate and adaptive immune responses involve unique<br>
immune cell types, one would not expect that methods for eliciting an innate immune<br>
response could also elicit an adaptive immune response. In some embodiments,<br>
administration of a non-pathogenic virus to a subject elicits both an innate immune<br>
response and an adaptive immune response.<br>
[00113] In some embodiments, the methods disclosed herein for the<br>
administration of non-pathogenic viruses can be combined with one or more other<br>
cancer therapies. For example, a tumor or abnormal cell growth can be surgically<br>
removed before or after administration of a non-pathogenic virus. Similarly, a non-<br>
pathogenic virus of the invention can be co-administered or co-formulated with<br>
additional agents, for example anti-angiogenic, chemotherapeutics, and/or additional<br>
immunomodulatory agents. Representative agents that can be used in conjunction<br>
with a non-pathogenic virus include, but are not limited to, methoxtrexate. tamoxifen,<br>
nelandron, nilutamide, adriamycin, 5-fluorouracil (5FU), cytokines such interferon<br>
alpha (IFN-a), interferon gamma (IFN-g), interleukin 2 (IL2), irrterieukin 4 (IL4),<br>
interleukin 6 (IL6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Infectious diseases can further<br>
be treated by administering anti-virals, anti-biotics, or anti-fungals.<br>
[00114] The present invention further relates to methods and compositions useful<br>
for inducing cytotoxic T-cell mediated responses in mammalian subjects, including<br>
humans. In some embodiments, the present invention relates to the use of a non-<br>
pathogenic virus for inducing cytotoxic T-cell mediated responses. Thus, the present<br>
invention provides methods for preparing antigen formulations comprising a non-<br>
pathogenic virus and an antigen. The term "antigen" refers to a substance that<br>
activates lymphocytes (positively or negatively) by interacting with T cell or B cell<br>
receptors. Positive activation leads to immune responsiveness, and negative<br>
activation leads to immune tolerance. An antigen can comprise a protein, a<br>
carbohydrate, a lipid, a nucleic acid, or combinations thereof. An antigen can<br>
comprise a heterologous (e.g., an antigen that is typically not found in a host subject)<br>
or an autologous antigen (self antigen).<br>
[00115] Also provided are methods for using the disclosed antigen formulations as<br>
therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents. For example, such antigen formulations can<br>
be administered to a mammalian subject for the treatment of diseases in which a<br>
CTL response is important, for example, in the treatment of HIV infection or<br>
influenza; it can also be extended to use in treatment or prevention of bacterial<br>
infections, parasitic infections, and the like.<br>
[00116] In some embodiments the present invention provides methods of<br>
inhibiting one or more symptoms of cancer in an individual in need thereof. The<br>
methods comprise administering to the individual an amount of a composition<br>
comprising a non-pathogenic virus effective to inhibit one or more symptoms of<br>
cancer in the individual.<br>
[00117] Symptoms of cancer are well known to the art-skilled and include both<br>
physiological and physical indicia. Physiological indicia include, without limitation,<br>
tumor growth, abnormal ceil growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, cell death or cell<br>
invasiveness. Physical indicia include, without limitation, weight loss, bleeding,<br>
difficulty in breathing, bone fractures, compromised immune system or fatigue.<br>
[00118] The administration of a non-pathogenic virus to a subject as disclosed<br>
herein can also elicit an anti-infectious disease immune response. As discussed<br>
above, an immune response can comprise an innate immune response, an adaptive<br>
immune response, or a combination thereof.<br>
[00119] The present invention also provides methods of protecting an animal from<br>
an infectious disease comprising administering to the animal an effective amount of<br>
a composition comprising a non-pathogenic virus. In some embodiments the non-<br>
pathogenic virus is inactivated by any methods or by methods disclosed herein.<br>
Based on the Examples described below it was observed that the administration of<br>
inactive non-pathogenic virus protected against an infectious agent (e.g. virus,<br>
fungus, or bacteria). In some embodiments, the non-pathogenic virus is an insect-<br>
specific virus (e.g. Baculaviridae family). The non-pathogenic virus can also be co-<br>
administered with other vaccines, anti-viral, anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, or<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
C. Therapeutic Compositions and Methods<br>
[00120] The present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions and<br>
methods for using the same. A non-pathogenic virus of the invention is prepared<br>
and formulated for safe and efficacious anti-tumor and/or anti-infectious disease<br>
and/or adjuvant activity, as described herein.<br>
[00121] The present invention also provides compositions that can be used to<br>
treat or prevent infectious disease and/or cancer. In some embodiments, the<br>
compositions comprise a non-pathogenic virus and peripheral blood mononudear<br>
cells (PBMCs). In some embodiments, the PBMCs are isolated from the animal or<br>
individual, contacted with the non-pathogenic virus ex vivo, and then re-administered<br>
to the animal or individual as a mixture or combination. In some embodiments, the<br>
PBMCs are isolated from a different animal or individual than is being treated or to<br>
whom the compositions of the present invention are being administered.<br>
[00122] In some embodiments, the composition comprises non-pathogenic virus<br>
and at least one tumor cell. The tumor cell can either be autologous or alfogenic to<br>
the individual or animal.<br>
[00123] in some embodiments, the composition comprises a non-pathogenic<br>
virus, at least one tumor cell, and at least one PBMC. In some embodiments the<br>
non-pathogenic virus is an inactive virus.<br>
C.1. Viral Inactivation<br>
[00124] In some embodiments, live non-pathogenic viruses used in the methods<br>
of the present invention are inactivated prior to administration to a subject Non-<br>
pathogenic viruses, as defined herein above, are incapable of replication in a<br>
mammalian host. Inactivation, which renders the virus non-replicative in its native<br>
host cell, can be performed as an additional safety measure.<br>
[00125] Viral inactivation can be accomplished by any suitable means, including but<br>
not limited to destruction of lipid or protein components of a viral coat, modification<br>
such that the virus is unrecognizable to a target cell, destruction of viral nucleic acid,<br>
and/or rendering of ihe virus as irreplicable. Representative methods for viral<br>
inactivation include but not limited to pasteurization, treatment with detergents (e.g.,<br>
Triton-X100®), alkylation with binary ethylenimine (BEI), photochemical inactivation,<br>
UV-light inactivation, radiation, physical disruption (e.g. sonication, electron beam);<br>
genetic inactivation and combinations thereof. See Rueda et al. (2000) Vaccine<br>
19:726-34 and Henzler &amp; Kaiser (1998) Nat Biotechnol 16:1077-9. In some<br>
embodiments, inactivation does not significantly reduce viral antigenicity and/or<br>
activity. Viral inactivation is assayed using standard methods for determining viral<br>
infectivity.<br>
[00126] "Genetic inactivation," as used herein, refers to the manipulation of the<br>
nucleic acids (e.g. genes) of the virus. The manipulation can include, for example,<br>
deletion of one or more genes, mutation of at least one gene; creation of<br>
temperature sensitive mutants, inactivation of a gene, and the like. Temperature<br>
sensitive mutants are mutants that at one temperature are permissive, while at<br>
another temperature it is restrictive (e.g. inhibits viral replication). In the case of a<br>
baculovirus this can be used to allow the virus to grow at room temperature (e.g.<br>
about 25°C) for propagation and preparation, but when administered to an animal the<br>
higher internal temperature of the animal will inactivate the virus. In some<br>
embodiments, the temperature sensitive mutant will be permissive at a temperature<br>
in the ranges of about 16-28°C, about 20-28°C, about 25-28°C, or about 27°C. In<br>
some embodiments, the restrictive temperature for a temperature sensitive mutant is<br>
about 30-45°C, about 32-40°C, about 35-38°C, about 37oC. In some embodiments<br>
the restrictive temperature is any temperature above about 28°C, about 29°C, about<br>
30°C, about 31 °C, about 32°C, about 33°C, about 34°C, about 35°C, about 36°C, or<br>
about 37°C. In some embodiments the temperature sensitive mutant is inactive<br>
inside an animal or an individual. In some embodiments, the temperature sensitive<br>
mutant is 100% less active, about 90% less active, about 80% less active, about<br>
70% less active, about 60% less active, about 50% less active, about 40% less<br>
active, about 30% less active, about 20% less active, or about 10% less active as<br>
compared to the wild-type virus at the restrictive temperature.<br>
[00127] Temperature sensitive mutants can have any gene mutated that reduces the<br>
activity of the virus at one temperature when compared to another temperature.<br>
Examples of genes or proteins that can be mutated include, but are not limited to<br>
Guanylyltransferase, RNA triphosphatase, ATPase, a protein kinase (e.g. PK-1), and<br>
the like. Examples of temperature sensitive mutants can be found in, for example,<br>
Jin et al., Journal of Virology, (1998), Vol. 72, pp.10011-10019, and McLachlin et a!.,<br>
Virology, (1998). Vol. 246, pp. 379-391, each of which are hereby incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
[00128] Pasteurization is a simple approach for inactivation if the viruses can<br>
withstand thermal treatment sufficient for inactivation. In some embodiments, the<br>
heating is performed for a minimally sufficient time period to minimize damage to<br>
viral proteins. Optionally, viral damage can be minimized by the use of stabilizers<br>
and sodium citrate, saccharose, and/or glycine.<br>
[00129] Alternately, chemical inactivation, for example mild pepsin processing at low<br>
pH values or exposure to detergents, can be used to disrupt the lipid bilayer and thus<br>
can be used for inactivating enveloped viruses, including baculovinjs. See U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 4,820,806 and 4,764,369. Aziridine binary ethylenimine is a potent<br>
alkylating agent that inactivates virus by selectively interacting with nucleophylic<br>
groups of nucleic acids but not proteins.<br>
[00130] In some embodiments of the invention, viral inactivation is achieved via a<br>
photochemical reaction. According to this approach, a radiation sensitizing chemical<br>
compound is added to a liquid suspension of non-pathogenic viruses, and the<br>
mixture is exposed to UV light or ionizing (y or X-ray) radiation.<br>
[00131] Psoralen, and derivatives thereof, and compounds with a linear tricyclic<br>
structure resembling psoralen, are capable of evoking photosensitization. Psoralens<br>
are bi-functional photoreactive molecules, which form covalent bonds with nucleic<br>
acids in the presence of long wavelength ultraviolet light Psoralen molecules<br>
intercalate into DNA duplexes and then photoreact to cross-link the individual<br>
strands of the DNA. See Hwang et ai. (1996) Biochem Biophys Res Commun<br>
219:191-7. The crosslinking renders the DNA unable to replicate or to be<br>
transcribed. Commercially available psoralen compounds include &amp;-<br>
methoxypsoralen (methoxsalen) and 4,5', 8 trimethyl psoralen (trioxaJen). The<br>
wavelengths most effective for photochemical Inactivation using psoralen are in the<br>
range between 320 nm and 380 nm, with maximum effectiveness between 33 nm<br>
and 360 nm. See Pathak, M (1974) in Sunlight and Man, eds. Pathak, M &amp;<br>
Fitzpatrick, T, University of Tokyo Press, Tokyo.<br>
[00132] Additional photosensitizing agents include halogenated psoralens,<br>
angelicins, khellins and coumarins, which each contain a halogen substituent and a<br>
water solubilization moiety, such as, quaternary ammonium ion or phosphonium Ion.<br>
It is believed that the substitution of halogen atoms, particularly bromine atoms, on<br>
psoralen molecules increases the binding constant of the sensitizer to DNA due to<br>
the hydrophobic nature of bromine. In some embodiments, brominated<br>
photosensitizing agents are used because only one photon of light is required to<br>
activate the brominated sensttizer, whereas two photons are required to effect DNA<br>
crosslinking using non-brominated psoralens. See, for example, U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,418,130.<br>
[00133] A representative method for photochemical inactivation is described in<br>
Example 11, which employs a combination of trioxalen and long wavelength UV<br>
illumination. See, for example, Weightman &amp; Banks (1999) J Viral Methods 81:179-<br>
82 and Gotten et al. (1992) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 89:6094-8.<br>
[00134] To preserve antigenic characteristics of the virus, psoralen inactivation of<br>
live virus can be performed In a non-oxidizing atmosphere. By excluding oxygen and<br>
other oxidizing species from the inactivation medium, degradation of antigens via<br>
irradiation with ultraviolet light is largely prevented. See U.S. Patent No. 5,106,619.<br>
Similarly, antioxidants/quenchers can be used to minimize free radicals and other<br>
reactive oxygen species that are generated by exposure to short wave length UV<br>
light, and to thereby minimize protein damage. See, for example, Marx et al. (1996)<br>
Photochem Photobiol 63:641-6.<br>
[00135] In some embodiments of the invention, viral inactivation comprises<br>
modification of viral genes, whereby the virus is impaired or unable to replication.<br>
For example, a virus can be genetically modified to include one or more<br>
temperature-sensitive mutations in viral essential genes. The virus is produced and<br>
grown in Sf9 or Tn5 cultures at the permissive temperature (e.g., 25°C). When the<br>
virus is introduced into a mammal subject during treatment, the temperature is non-<br>
permissive (e.g., 37°C) such that the temperature-sensitive genes would be poorly<br>
expressed, or the resultant gene products would have impaired function, and the<br>
virus would be crippled.<br>
[00136] Representative temperature-sensitive mutations that could be generated<br>
include genes that are required for viral infection. For example, temperature-<br>
sensitive mutations in the gene encoding PKIP, a protein which interacts with a virus-<br>
encoded protein kinase, and in regulators of viral late gene transcription. At the non-<br>
permissive temperature, virus bearing such mutations show defects in viral infection.<br>
See, for example, McLachlin et al. (1998) Virology 246:379 and Partington et al.<br>
(1990) Virology 175:91.<br>
100137] Virus inactivation can be assessed by demonstrating a loss in ability to<br>
replicate in a native host cell. Infectivity of a sample can be demonstrated using a<br>
standard plaque assay. When suitable methods to demonstrate infectivity of a<br>
particular virus are unknown, assessment of inactivation can rely on demonstrating<br>
inactivation of a model virus having similar biophysical and structural qualities. See<br>
Henzier &amp; Kaiser (1998) Nat Biotechnol 16:1077-9. To render a virus completely<br>
inactive, the inactivation methods used in accordance with the present invention can<br>
include sequential exposure to an inactivating stimulus.<br>
C.2. Carriers<br>
[00138] As described herein, a non-pathogenic virus can comprise a live virus, an<br>
inactivated vims, a viral particle, a viral occlusion body, a viral component, or<br>
combinations thereof. To facilitate delivery of a non-pathogenic virus to cancer cells<br>
in a subject, a composition that is administered to elicit an anti-cancer and/or an anti-<br>
infectious disease response in a subject comprises: (a) an effective amount of a non-<br>
pathogenic virus; and (b) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Where appropriate,<br>
two or more carriers can be used together.<br>
[00139] As used herein, the term "carrier" refers to a compound or a group of<br>
compounds that can be used to transport a vims, vims like particle, viral component,<br>
viral protein to or across a plasma membrane of a cell.<br>
[00140] Representative carriers for delivery of a non-pathogenic virus or viral<br>
component include, for example, liposomes, nanospheres (Manome et ah, 1994;<br>
Saltzman and Fung, 1997), a glycosaminoglycan (e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,106,866),<br>
fatty acids (e.g.. U.S. Patent No. 5,994,392), fatty emulsions (e.g., U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,651,991), lipids and lipid derivatives (e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,786,387), collagen<br>
(e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,922,356), polysaccharides and derivatives thereof (e.g., U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,688,931), nanosuspensions (e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,858,410),<br>
polymeric micelles or conjugates (e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,551,482, 5,714,166,<br>
5,510,103, 5,490,840, and 5,855,900), and polysomes (e.g., U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,922,545),<br>
[00141] For delivery of a viral component, the carrier can farther comprise a gene<br>
therapy vector, including, for example, a viral vector or a plasmid vector. Suitable<br>
viral vectors for gene expression include adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses<br>
(AAVs), retroviruses, pseudotyped retroviruses, herpes viruses, vaccinia viruses,<br>
and Semiliki forest virus. A carrier can also include, for example, a virus like particle,<br>
protein delivery vehicles including, for example, Pro-Ject (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.)<br>
and Profect (Targeting Systems), and Chariot™ (Active Motif), and the like.<br>
[00142] A carrier can be selected to effect sustained bioavailability of a non-<br>
pathogenic virus to a site in need of treatment. The term "sustained bioavaiiability"<br>
encompasses factors including but not limited to prolonged release of a non-<br>
pathogenic virus from a carrier, metabolic stability of a non-pathogenic virus,<br>
systemic transport of a composition comprising a non-pathogenic virus, and effective<br>
dose of a non-pathogenic virus.<br>
[00143] Representative compositions for sustained bioavailability cart include but are<br>
not limited to polymer matrices, including swelling and biodegradable polymer<br>
matrices, (U.S. Patent Nos. 6,335,035; 6,312,713; 6,296,842; 6,287,587; 6,267,981;<br>
6.262,127; and 6.221,958), polymer-coated microparticles (U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
6,120,787 and 6,090,925) a polyol;oil suspension (U.S. Patent No. 6,245,740),<br>
porous particles (U.S. Patent No. 6,238,705), latex/wax coated granules (U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,238,704), chitosan microcapsules, and microsphere emulsions (U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,190,700).<br>
C.3. Formulation, Dose and Administration<br>
[00144] Suitable formulations for administration of a composition of the invention to a<br>
subject include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which can<br>
contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, antibacterial and antifungal agents (e.g.,<br>
parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, an thimerosal), solutes that render<br>
the formulation isotonic with the bodily fluids of the intended recipient (e.g., sugars,<br>
salts, and polyalcohols), suspending agents and thickening agents. The<br>
formulations can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example<br>
sealed ampoules and vials, and can be stored in a frozen or freeze-dried<br>
(lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of sterile liquid carrier immediately<br>
prior to use.<br>
[00145] Compositions useful for injection into a host include sterile aqueous<br>
solutions or dispersions, and sterile powder for the preparation of sterile injectable<br>
solutions or dispersions. An injectable composition should be fluid to the extent that<br>
administration via a syringe is readily performed. Suitable solvents include water,<br>
ethanol, polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol), and<br>
mixtures thereof. Fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating<br>
such as lecithin and/or by minimization of particle size.<br>
[00146] A non-pathogenic virus of the present invention can be administered to a<br>
subject intratumorally, peritumorally, systemically, parenterally (e.g.. intravenous<br>
injection, intra-muscular injection, intra-arterial injection, and infusion techniques),<br>
orally, transdermally (topically), intranasally (inhalation), and intramucosally. A<br>
delivery method is selected based on considerations such as the type of the type of<br>
carrier or vector, therapeutic efficacy of the composition, location of target area, and<br>
the condition to be treated.<br>
[00147] As used herein, the term "protein delivery vehicle" refers to an agent(s) that<br>
facilitates the transport of a protein to or across the membrane of a cell.<br>
[00148] In some embodiments, a non-pathogenic virus is administered by direct<br>
injection into a tumor or into a peritumor site. The term "peritumor site" refers to a<br>
site less than about 15 cm from an outer edge of a tumor, less than about 10 cm<br>
from an outer edge of a tumor, less than about 5 cm from an outer edge of a tumor,<br>
less than about 1 cm from an outer edge of a tumor, or less than about 0.1 cm from<br>
an outer edge of a tumor. A non-pathogenic virus of the invention can be delivered<br>
to one or more tumor and/or peritumor sites. !n some embodiments, a non-<br>
pathogenic virus of the invention is administered at multiple sites within a tumor<br>
and/or surrounding a tumor.<br>
[00149] In some embodiments, wherein the cancer is a non-neoplastic growth a non-<br>
pathogenic virus is administered at a lesional or perilesional site. The term<br>
"perilesional site" refers to a site less than about 15 cm from an outer edge of a non-<br>
neoplastic growth, less than about 10 cm from an outer edge of a non-neoplastic<br>
growth, less than about 5 cm from an outer edge of a non-neoplastic growth, less<br>
than about 1 cm from an outer edge of a non-neoplastic growth, or less than about<br>
0.1 cm from an outer edge of a non-neoplastic growth. A non-pathogenic virus of the<br>
invention can be delivered to one or more lesional and/or perilesional sites. In some<br>
embodiments, a non-pathogenic virus of the invention Is administered at multiple<br>
sites within a non-neoplastic growth and/or surrounding a non-neoplastic growth.<br>
[00150] In some embodiments, wherein the compositions are being used to treat an<br>
infectious disease, a non-pathogenic virus is administered systemically. In some<br>
embodiments a non-pathogenic virus is administered locally to affected regions.<br>
[001S1] The present invention provides that an effective amount of a non-pathogenic<br>
virus is administered to a subject. The term "effective amount" is used herein to<br>
describe an amount of a non-pathogenic virus sufficient to elicit anti-cancer activity,<br>
including, for example, an anti-tumor activity and/or an anti-non-neoplastic growth<br>
activity. As disclosed herein, representative anti-cancer activities include but are not<br>
limited to cancer cell cytolysis, inhibition of cancer growth, inhibition of cancer<br>
metastasis, and/or cancer resistance. In some embodiments, an "effective amount"<br>
refers to the amount of a therapeutic that is effective in an in vitro assay in inhibiting<br>
cancer growth, inhibiting metastasis, inhibiting cancer resistance, inducing cell<br>
cytolysis, inducing cell death, and the like. In some embodiments, an "effective<br>
amount" inhibits cancer growth, inhibits metastasis, inhibits cancer resistance,<br>
induces cell cytolysis, induces cell death, or combinations thereof at least 10%, at<br>
least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at<br>
least 80%, at least 90%, at least 2-fo!d, at least 5-fold, at least 10-fold, or at least<br>
100-fold.'<br>
[00152] The term "effective amount" is used herein to describe an amount of a non-<br>
pathogenic virus sufficient to elicit anti-infectious disease activity. In some<br>
embodiments, an "effective amount" inhibits viral replication at least 10%, at least<br>
20%, at least 30%. at least 40%, at least 50%, .at least 60%, at least 70%, at least<br>
80%, at least 90%, at least 2-fold, at least 5-fold, at least 10-fold, or at least 100-fold,<br>
compared to a control.<br>
[00153] Actual dosage levels of active ingredients in a therapeutic composition of<br>
the invention can be varied so as to administer an amount of the composition that is<br>
effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular subject.<br>
Administration regimens can also be varied as required to elicit the desired activity.<br>
A single injection or multiple injections can be used. The selected dosage level and<br>
regimen will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the therapeutic<br>
composition, formulation, the route of administration, combination with other drugs or<br>
treatments, the disease or disorder to be treated, and the physical condition and<br>
prior medical history of the subject being treated. Determination and adjustment of<br>
an effective amount or dose, as well as evaluation of when and how to make such<br>
adjustments, are known to those of ordinary skill in the art of medicine.<br>
[00154] The dose of a non-pathogenic virus can be calculated by a variety of<br>
methods. For a live non-pathogenic virus the dose can be calculated as plaque-<br>
forming units. For an inactive non-pathogenic virus, which does not form plaques,<br>
the amount of virus administered to an individual can be measured in terms of PFU<br>
equivalents. As used herein, the term "PFU equivalent" refers to a quantity of non-<br>
pathogenic virus. A PFU equivalent is defined as the amount of virus resulting after<br>
1 PFU of a virus is inactivated.<br>
[00155] Another method of determining quantity of virus to be administered is based<br>
on the number of viral particles present in a sample. The particles can be counted<br>
by any method including, for example, electron microscopy. The non-pathogenic<br>
virus, including inactivated virus, can also be administered using an amount<br>
extrapolated from an amount effective in an in vitro assay. The in vitro assay can be<br>
any assay known to those skilled in the art for measuring anti-cancer or anti-<br>
infectious disease activity, including, but not limited to, assays that measures<br>
cytotoxicity, cell death, ability of cells to grow in soft-agar, and the like. In some<br>
embodiments, the dose is the amount that increases cytotoxicity or cell death by at<br>
least 20%, at (east 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at<br>
least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 99%, relative to a control. In some embodiments,<br>
the does is the amount of virus that decreases the ability of cells to grow in soft-agar<br>
by at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%,<br>
at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 99%, relative to a control.<br>

[00157] In some embodiments, compositions are tested in vitro or in vivo assays in<br>
order to determine an "effective amount." For example, in methods disclosed herein<br>
for causing cell death, assays suitable include, without limitation, in vitro cell viability<br>
assays, including the TUNEL assay or other fluorescent based assays such as Cell-<br>
Titer Blue (Promega Corp); assays that monitor DNA fragmentation; and cytochrome<br>
C release assays, soft-agar growth assays, contact inhibition assays, and tumor<br>
growth in nude mice; assays comprising injecting a test animal with a tumor<br>

administered with the VLPs. St Clair et al. describe the use of protein crystals to<br>
enhance humoral and cellular responses. (St. Clair, N. et al, Applied Biol. Sci.,<br>
96:9469-9474,1999).<br>
[00161] It will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art that following a review of<br>
the present disclosure, the therapeutic methods for administration of a non-<br>
pathogenic virus can be variably performed to elicit an anti-cancer response and/or<br>
an anti-infectious disease.response.<br>
[00162] In accordance with long-standing convention, the terms "a," "an," and the"<br>
are used to refer to one or more. The term "about", as used herein when referring to<br>
a measurable value, for example a peritumoral or perilesional distance, is meant to<br>
encompass variations of ±20% or ±10%, ±5%, ±1%, or +0.1% from the specified<br>
amount, as such variations are appropriate to perform a disclosed method or<br>
otherwise cany out the present invention. In some embodiments "about" is meant to<br>
encompass variations of ±10% from the specified amount.<br>
D1. Predicting In vivo Activity<br>
[00163] Predicting in vivo anti-tumor activity is often difficult and haphazard. The<br>
present invention provides methods for predicting in vivo anti-tumor activity. In<br>
some embodiments, the method comprises contacting a compound with tumor cells<br>
and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and measuring cell death of the tumor cells.<br>
In some embodiments, the compound is a non-pathogenic virus or a non-pathogenic<br>
insect-specific virus. Any method can be used to measure cell death including, for<br>
example, measuring apoptosis, necrosis, cell viability, and the like. Examples of<br>
tumor cells that can be used, include but are not limited to, are lung cancer cells (e.g.<br>
A549 cells, 3LL-HM cells), breast cancer cells (e.g. 4T1 cells; MT901 cells; MAT Bill<br>
cells), prostate cancer cells, colon cancer cells, skin cancer cells (e.g, B16<br>
melanoma cells), pancreas cancer cells, liver cancer ceils, brain cancer cells, bone<br>
cancer cells (e.g. MG-63 cells), stomach cancer cells, or esophageal cancer cells,<br>
among others.<br>
[00164] E.1 Release Assays<br>
[00165] Prior to release to the public of medicaments, governmental agencies, for<br>
example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), frequently require that stringent<br>
quality control be performed on such medicaments to ensure that the medicaments<br>
comprise the same ingredients as were contained in medicaments approved by that<br>
or other governmental agencies. Often, such quality control is performed using<br>
release assays—assays to ensure the medicaments meet regulatory guidelines.<br>
[00166] The present invention provides processes for preparing anti-cancer and anti-<br>
infectious disease compositions for release, in some embodiments the compositions<br>
comprise one or more non-pathogenic viruses. In some embodiments the non-<br>
pathogenic virus is an Autographa califomica nucleopolyhedrosis virus. In some<br>
embodiments the non-pathogenic virus comprises an inactivated virus, a viral<br>
particle, a virosome, a Virus Like Particle, a viral occlusion body, or a viral<br>
component. In some embodiments the processes comprise performing release<br>
assays on the compositions to ensure that the safety, toxicity and efficacy of the<br>
compositions meet proscribed guidelines.<br>
[00167] The processes for preparing anti-cancer and anti-infectious disease<br>
compositions comprise exposing the composition to a first inactivator effective to<br>
inactivate an active virus, exposing the composition to a second inactivator effective<br>
to inactivate an active virus, combining the composition with one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable earners or excipients, and confirming the inactivity of<br>
the inactivated virus, viral particle, virosome, Virus Like Particles, viral occlusion<br>
body, or viral component in an in vitro assay. In some embodiments the<br>
confirmation of the inactivity of said virus, viral particle, virosome, Virus Like<br>
Particles, viral occlusion body, or viral component is performed after each of the<br>
inactivating steps.<br>
[00168] In some embodiments the processes further comprise collecting a random<br>
portion of the composition for analysis of one or more of safety, efficacy, or toxicity.<br>
In some embodiments the safety and/or efficacy and/or efficacy of the random<br>
portion is compared to the safety and/or efficacy and/or efficacy of a second anti-<br>
cancer or anti-infectious disease composition. The comparison data is generated for<br>
review prior to release.<br>
[00169] In some embodiments the inactivity of the inactivated virus, viral particle,<br>
virosome. Virus Like Particles, viral occlusion body, or viral component is confirmed<br>
by plaque formation assay. In some embodiments the plaque formation assay is<br>
performed with Sf9 cells. In some embodiments the process further comprises<br>
counting the inactivated virus, viral particle, virosome, Virus Like Particles, viral<br>
occlusion body, or viral component. Counting may be performed by any method<br>
known to those of skill in the art. In some embodiments counting is performed using<br>
EM.<br>
[00170] The following examples are meant to illustrate the invention and are not to<br>
be construed to limit the invention in anyway. Those skilled in the art will recognize<br>
modifications that are within trie spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
Examples<br>
[00171] Example 1. Preparation of Recombinant Baculovirus<br>
[00172] The full-length sequence encoding human CCL21 (GenBank Accession No.<br>
NM 002989) was cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 (Pharmingen<br>
of San Diego, California) and co-transfected with BACULOGOLD® WT genomic<br>
DNA (Pharmingen of San Diego, California) using methods recommended by the<br>
vendor. The recombinant baculovirus obtained from this procedure was subcloned<br>
by plaque-purification on Sf9 insect ceils to yield several isolates expressing human<br>
CCL21. A clone was selected for its exceptional expression characteristics<br>
compared to the original virus. Amplification of this baculovirus isolate was<br>
performed at low multiplicity of infection (MOI) to generate high-titer, low passage<br>
stock for protein production. The baculovirus expressing human CCL21 was<br>
designated BV422. Additional recombinant baculovirus were similarly prepared. For<br>
example, baculovirus expressing intracellular Raf protein was prepared and<br>
designated BV762.<br>
[00173] Protein production and budded baculovirus production involved infection of<br>
suspended Trichoplusia ni (Tn5) cells in protein-free media at multiplicity of infection<br>
(MOI) of 2-10 for 48 hours. BV422 culture supematants, which included the<br>
recombinantly expressed CCL21, were collected by centrifugation, clarified by<br>
filtration and prepared for column purification.<br>
[00174] Example 2. Tumor Growth Inhibition in an Animal Model of Lung<br>
Cancer<br>
[00175] C57BL/6 mice at 9-11 weeks of age were allowed to acclimate for a<br>
minimum of 7 days prior to inoculation with tumor cells. Mice were inoculated s.c. at<br>
the right flank with 2 X 105 earty passage (
Tumor size was measured twice per week. When tumors reached 60-100 mm3<br>
(typically 7 days after tumor inoculation), mice were randomized into groups.<br>
Baculovirus-expressed CCL21 was administered intratumoraliy to tumor-bearing<br>
mice. Dose and administration regimens were varied to optimize tumor inhibition.<br>
When tumor volume in any group reached 3000 mm3 (typically 33-35 days after<br>
inoculation in mice of the control group), mice were sacrificed.<br>
[00176] As shown in Figure 1, intratumoral administration of baculovirus-expressed<br>
CCL21 resulted in growth delay of 3LL tumors. CCL21 dose was optimized to<br>
achieve complete inhibition of tumor growth. An administration regimen that<br>
included 2 or 3 injections at a relatively higher dose showed similar efficacy when<br>
compared to an administration regimen that included 6 injections at a relatively lower<br>
dose. Some tumor inhibition was also seen using a single dose.<br>
[00177] Example 3. Tumor Growth Inhibition in an Animal Model of Breast<br>
Cancer<br>
[00178] Balb/c mice at 9-11 weeks of age were allowed to acclimate for a minimum<br>
of 7 days prior to inoculation with tumor cells. Mice were inoculated s.c. at: the right<br>
flank with 2 X 105 4T1 cells. Tumor size was measured twice per week. When<br>
tumors reached 50-100 mm3 (typically 7 days after tumor inoculation), mice were<br>
randomized into groups. Baculovjrus was administered intratumoraliy to tumor-<br>
bearing mice. Dose was varied to determine an optimal effective dose. When tumor<br>
volume in any group reached 3000 mm3 (typically.33-35 days after inoculation in<br>
mice of the control group), the mice were sacrificed. As shown in Figure 2,<br>
intratumoral administration of CCL21 resulted in growth delay of 4T1 tumors.<br>
[00179] Example 4. Tumor Growth Inhibition in a Melanoma Model<br>
[00180] The mouse melanoma cell line, B16-BL6, is used to establish subcutaneous<br>
tumors in 6-8 week old pink-skinned female BDF-1 mice (Charles River Laboratories<br>
of Boston, Massachusetts). To produce cutaneous tumors, 106 B16-BL6 cells in 0.2<br>
ml media are injected into the upper back region of 6-6 week old female BDF-1 mice<br>
on day 0. Cell viability is assessed using trypan blue exclusion before and after cell<br>
injection. The number of dead cells before injection is typically not more than 10% of<br>
the total number of cells. By day 6, tumors are typically 5-10 mm in diameter.<br>
[00181] Baculovirus-expressed CCL21 are prepared as described in Example 1.<br>
Baculovirus are administered subcutaneously, at a site approximately 3 mm away<br>
from each tumor, on days 3 and 4. Tumor volume is measured daily for three<br>
weeks. Mice are. sacrificed when tumor volume reaches 4000 mm3.<br>
[00182] Example 5. Resistance to Tumor Re-challenge<br>
[001831 Mice bearing tumors were prepared and treated with Baculovirus as<br>
described above. Mice having complete tumor regression or in mice that did not<br>
have complete tumor regression had their tumors surgically removed 2 days after the<br>
final dose of Baculovirus were subjected to tumor rechallenge. Mice were<br>
anesthetized using 200 ml ketamine/xylazine mixture (4:1 ketaminetxylazine diluted<br>
10-fold in phosphate-buffered saline) injected intnaperitoneally, the tumor was<br>
resected, and the wound was closed with staples. One to four days following tumor<br>
resection, mice were rechallenged by subcutaneous administration of 2 X 105 4T1<br>
cells at a site other than the original tumor site. Rechallenge tumor volume was<br>
measured twice per week. In mice having complete tumor regression, the mice were<br>
regrouped evenly into two groups. One group was rechallenged with the same<br>
tumor cells at the opposite side of flank at 1X105 cells per mouse. The other group<br>
was challenged with different syngeneic tumor cells (B16F10) at the left flank at<br>
1X105 cells per mouse. Tumor development on the re-challenged site was<br>
monitored. Mice treated with Baculovirus were able to resist rechallenge with 3LL-.<br>
HM tumor cells, but were not resistant to the different syngeneic tumor cells.<br>
[00184] Example 6. Inhibition of Tumor Metastases<br>
[00185] Mice bearing tumors were prepared and treated with baculovirus as<br>
described in Example 3. Mice were sacrificed when the control group showed signs<br>
of severe sickness due to lung metastases. Typical indicators include laborious<br>
breathing, greasy fur. and weight loss. The lungs were harvested and preserved in<br>
Buoin's solution. The presence of lung metastases was determined. Figure 3 shows<br>
that baculovirus expressed CCL21 significantly inhibited tumor metastasis.<br>
[00186] Example 7. Anti-Tumor Activity of Baculovirus<br>
[00187] The anti-tumor activity of baculovirus-expressed hCCL21, as described in<br>
Examples 2-3 and 5-6, is attributable to baculovirus rather than to CCL21., As shown<br>
in Figure 6, filtered preparations of baculovirus-expressed CCL21 were insufficient to<br>
effect tumor remission in a 3LL tumor model. The concentration of CCL21 in any<br>
given sample was unchanged by filtration. Some but not all preparations of<br>
baculovirus-expressed CCL21 were similarly ineffective.<br>
[00188] In contrast to the variability observed in vivo, all CCL21 preparations were<br>
sufficient to induce chemotaxis of lymphocytes in vitro. See Table 1 and Figure 7.<br>
These results suggest that a high molecular'weight contaminating substance in<br>
baculovirus-expressed CCL21 was required for robust anti-tumor activity, but not for<br>
CCL21-induced chemotaxis in vitro.<br>
[00189] Baculovirus was found to be a contaminant of baculovirus-expnessed CCL21<br>
prepared as described in Example 1. Baculovirus-expressed CCL21 was used to<br>
prepare a Western Blot, which was probed with an antibody that specifically<br>
recognizes the baculoviral protein gp64. As shown in Figure 8, gp64 was detected in<br>
baculovirus-expressed CCL21 preparations, in addition, lots of baculovirus-<br>
expressed CCL21 that showed anti-tumor activity had relatively high titers of live<br>
virus, while inactive lots had relatively lower titers of live virus (Table 2).<br>
Table 2. Viral Titer Correlates with Anti-Tumor Activity of Baculovirus-<br>
Expressed CCL21 Preparations<br>
[00190] Figure 9 shows that intratumoral injection of purified live baculovirus, in the<br>
absence of CCL21, and at titers comparable to those seen in contaminated CCL21<br>
preparations, inhibits tumor growth as effectively as the baculovirus-contaminated<br>
CCL21 preparations.<br>
[00191] Example 8. Baculovirus-induced Cytotoxicity In vitro<br>
[00192] Baculovirus were prepared as described in Example 1. Uninfected Sf9 cells<br>
were used as a control. Following centrifugation, both the supematants and cellular<br>
pellets were recovered. For performance of the cytotoxicity assay, the samples were<br>
diluted 1:11 in growth media to an initial virus tfter of 5 X106 pfu/ml.<br>
[00193] A549 human epithelial lung cells were seeded in triplicate into 96-well tissue<br>
culture, plates and incubated with serial dilutions of supernatant or cells from<br>
baculovirus-infected or uninfected Sf9 cells. After 24 hours, the media were<br>
removed, and the cells were washed extensively with fresh media. Cell viability was<br>
determined 24 to 45 hours later by crystal violet staining, which was quantified by<br>
spectroscopy.<br>
[00194] As shown in Figure 10A, the cell pellet samples induced a greater cytotoxic<br>
response than the supernatant samples. Supernatant collected from uninfected cells<br>
did not induce cytotoxicity. Figure 10B shows that the cytotoxic response was<br>
significantly reduced when the baculovirus-expressed supernatant was filtered<br>
through a 0.2 jjm filter (to remove contaminating baculovirus), similar to the toss of in<br>
vivo response. The disclosed in vitro cytotoxicity can be used to predict in vivo anti-<br>
cancer activity. See also Figure 13.<br>
[00195] Example 9. Baculovirus Activates Dendritic Cell Maturation<br>
[00196] Addition of wild type baculovirus to dendritic cell (DC) cultures induced their<br>
maturation, as evidenced by increased cell surface expression of activation markers.<br>
As shown in Figures 11A and 11B, baculovirus activates mouse bone marrow-<br>
derived DCs and human monocyte-derived DCs.<br>
[00197] Mouse DCs were prepared from bone marrow according to standard<br>
methods. Briefly, bone marrow was isolated from female BaJb/c or C57BI/6 mice,<br>
6-8 weeks old, (Charles River Laboratories of Holister, California) and frozen (-8O0C)<br>
in heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum supplemented with 10% cell-culture grade<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a density of 2 X 107 cells/ml. Frozen cell aliquots were<br>
rapidly thawed and washed to remove DMSO. Cells were plated in 150 mm<br>
suspension culture dishes containing 20 ml supplemented RPMl media (Sigma-<br>
Aldrich of St. Louis, Missouri) containing 200 U/ml murine GM-CSF (PreproTech of<br>
Rocky Hill, New Jersey). On day 3 of culture, cells were again supplemented with<br>
murine GM-CSF, and on day 5, one-half of the culture volume was centrifuged to<br>
replace fresh medium containing GM-CSF. BMDC were harvested by gentie<br>
pipetting.<br>
[00198] Baculovirus and other control materials were added to the media on day 6.<br>
Cells were incubated an additional 18 hours prior to analysis of cells or supematants.<br>
BMDC were analyzed for cell surface markers by FACS and were characterized as<br>
immature on day 6 prior to addition of stimuli by detection of markers for DC<br>
immaturity, including CD11c, CD11b, H-2Kd, I-Ad(low), CD80(low)r and CD86(low).<br>
Following overnight incubation with various stimuli, cells were washed and double-<br>
stained using anti-CD11c and anti-CD86 or anti-I-A antibodies and then analyzed by<br>
flow cytometry. Cells were gated on the live CD11c+ population. Stimulation is<br>
expressed as the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) divided by MFI from stained<br>
cetls treated only with GM-CSF. Figure 11A shows that the expression of the DC<br>
activation marker CD86 and MHC class II (detected using anti-l-A antibodies) was<br>
increased in response to baculovirus. The levels of CD80 and CD40 were similarly<br>
elevated in response to baculovirus.<br>
[00199] Human DC were derived from peripheral blood monocytes purified from the<br>
buffy coats of healthy volunteers by using anti-CDi4 antibody-coated magnetic<br>
beads (Miltenyi Biotec of Auburn, California). Immature DC were harvested after 3-4<br>
days of culture with interleukin-4 and GM-CSF (each 1000 U/ml; available from<br>
PreproTech of Rocky Hill, New Jersey). Cultures were routinely &gt;90% CD 1a positive<br>
by FACS (Phanmingen of San Diego, California). FACS analysis of DC activation<br>
markers was assessed by gating on live CD1a+ cells. Figure 11B shows that<br>
baculovirus induced elevated levels of CD86 and HLA-DR++.<br>
[00200] Example 10. Baculovirus Activates CTL Induction In vivo<br>
[00201] Immunization of mice with baculovirus and a soluble protein antigen (HIV<br>
p24) induced a robust, antigen-specific CTL response. Spleens from immunized<br>
mice were harvested 2 weeks following the third immunization. Individual spleens<br>
were combined such that 5 spleens were included in each sample. Spleen cells<br>
from immunized mice were cultured in a 24-well dish at 5 X 106 ceils per well. Of<br>
these cells, 1 x 106 cells were sensitized with: (1) a synthetic p7g peptide, which is<br>
an H-2Kd restricted CTL epitope correspcfnding to amino acids 199-208 of H|V-<br>
1SF2p24gag; and (2) a pGagb peptide, which is an H-2Db restricted CTL epitope<br>
corresponding to amino acids 390-398 of HIV-1se2p55gag. The peptides were used<br>
at a concentration of 10mM for 1 hour at 37°C. Splenocytes were then washed and<br>
co-cultured with the remaining 4 X 108 untreated cells. The splenocytes were<br>
stimulated as a bulk culture in 2 ml of splenocyte culture medium: RPMI 1640<br>
(Sigma-Aldrich of St. Louis, Missouri) with 100 mM L-glutamine (Gibco of Grand<br>
island, New York) and a-Mem (Minimum Essential medium Alpha Medium with L-<br>
glutamine, deoxyrobonucleosides or ribonudeosides) (1:1), supplemented with 10%<br>
heat inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone of Logan, Utah), inactivated in a 56°C<br>
water bath for 30 minutes in 100 U/ml penicillin, 10 mg/ml streptomycin, 10 ml/L of<br>
100mM sodium pyruvate and 50mM 2-mercaptoethanol. In addition, 5% Rat T-Stim<br>
IL2 (Rat T-Stim: Collaborative Biomedical Products of Bedford, Massachusetts) was<br>
used as a source of IL2 and was added to the culture media just before the cells<br>
were cultured.<br>
[00202] After a stimulation period of 6-7 days, splenocytes were collected and used<br>
as effectors in a chromium release assay. Approximately 1 X 106 SV/Balb or MC57<br>
target oefls were incubated in 200 ml of medium containing 50 mCi of 51 Cr and with<br>
the correct peptide p7g, or a mismatched cell-target pair as the negative control, at a<br>
concentration of 1mM for 60 minutes and washed. Effector cells were cultured with 5<br>
x 103 target cells at various effector to target ratios in 200 ml of culture medium in 96-<br>
well round or V-bottom tissue culture plates for 4 hours. The average counts per<br>
minute from duplicate wells was used to calculate percent specific release. Figure<br>
12 shows that baculovirus induced cytolytic T cell responses.<br>
[00203] Example 11. Photochemical Inactivation of Baculovirus<br>
[00204] Two liter suspension cultures of Trichoplusia ni (Tn) cells are infected with<br>
baculovirus. Following incubation for 3 days at 28*C the infected cell suspension is<br>
harvested and clarified by centrifugation at 800 X g for 10 minutes. The liter of<br>
baculovirus in the harvested medium was determined by plaque assay in<br>
Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf) cells, for example as described by King &amp; Possee (1992)<br>
The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Manual. Chapman &amp; Hall,<br>
London.<br>
[00205] A stock solution of triaxalen is prepared at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Trioxalen is added to the infected ceil suspension at a<br>
concentration of about 5-10 mg/ml and dispersed within the cell suspension by gentle<br>
shaking. The cell suspension is then poured into a seamless', stainless steel tray<br>
(e.g., about 1 cm in depth) and placed on a rotating platform. A long wavelength<br>
(365 nm, 6W) UV lamp is placed directly above the tray at a distance of 1 cm from<br>
the liquid surface. Exposure to UV illumination is allowed to proceed for about 15<br>
minutes, or for a period sufficient for virus inactivatjon.<br>
[00206] To assess virus inactivation, the trioxalen/UV inactivated samples are<br>
titrated on insect cells. For example, aliquots are taken from the cell suspension,<br>
serially diluted, and used to inoculate Sf9 cell cultures. The medium is changed at<br>
about 16 hours post inoculation to minimize DMSO-induced cytotoxicity. The<br>
cultures are examined microscopically to assess cellular pathology 7 days post<br>
inoculation and, if negative, are passaged twice more to confirm virus inactivation.<br>
The cultures are also examined to identify cellular cytotoxicity.<br>
[00207] Example 12. in vitro Assay Predicts In vivo Anti-Tumor Efficacy<br>
[00208] Various lots of CCL21 were tested both in a cytotoxicity assay and in an in<br>
vivo mouse tumor model, both of which are described below. Cytotoxicity activity<br>
coefficient is described below. Active and inactive lots were determined by analysis<br>
of tumor size at the end of the in vivo experiment.<br>
[00209] Induced PBMC Cytotoxic Assay<br>
[00210] The induced PBMC Cytotoxic Assay measures the cytotoxic (or cytostatic)<br>
response of PBMCs induced by certain activating substances such as cytoktnes (IL-<br>
2 or b-IFN) or baculovirus (BV) against an adherent target cell line (A549 or MG-63<br>
cells), and uses a co-culture technique of effector cells (PBMCs) and target cells.<br>
After an incubation period the target cell viability is quantified by Alamar blue<br>
staining. Components used in the assay include:<br>

[00211] A549 Cells<br>
[00212] A549 human lung carcinoma cells were obtained from American Type<br>
Culture Collection at passage 76 (ATCC CCL 185). Cells were expanded and stocks<br>
frozen preserved at low passage. A Master stock of A549 cells was frozen and<br>
preserved in liquid nitrogen.<br>
[00213] A549 Working Culture<br>
[00214] A549 cells grow as an adherent monolayer and must be detached with a<br>
trypsln solution for subculture. Media was removed from each T-175 flask. The<br>
monolayers were washed twice with 10 to 15 ml PBS. Three to 5 ml STV were<br>
added to each flask. Each flask was then incubated for 3 to 4 minutes or until cells<br>
started to detach. Flasks were gently tapped to detach cells. Five ml of Growth<br>
Medium was added to each flask and cells were gently triturated with a pipette to<br>
prepare a single cell suspension. Cells were transferred to a 50 ml centrifuge tube<br>
containing fresh Growth medium and gently mixed. Various proportions (1:5,1:10 or<br>
1: 20, for 2. 3. and 4 day cultures respectively) of cell mixture were distributed into<br>
T175 culture flasks containing 40 ±/- 5 ml of fresh Growth Medium warmed to 37ftC.<br>
[00215] MG-63 Cells<br>
[00216] The MG-63 human osteosarcoma cell line was obtained from the American<br>
Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-1427). A master stock of MG-63 cells was<br>
frozen and preserved in liquid nitrogen.<br>
[00217] MG-63 Working Culture<br>
[00218] Working Stock cultures were split every 3 or 4 days. Confluent monolayers<br>
were split 1:6 on a 3 day schedule and 1:8 on a 4 day schedule.<br>
[00219] Subculture procedure:<br>
[00220] MG-63 cells grow as an adherent monolayer and must be detached with a<br>
trypsin solution for subculture. Media is aspirated from each T-175 flask and the<br>
monolayer washed twice with 10 to 15 ml PBS. Four ± 0.1 ml STV was added to<br>
each flask and then flasks then incubated at 37" ±2OC, 5 ±1 % CO2, for 3 to 5 minutes<br>
until cells start to detach. Flasks were gently tapped to detach cells.<br>
[00221] Cells were pipetted up and down in STV to obtain a uniform suspension and<br>
then transferred to a 50 ml centrifuge tube containing fresh Growth medium and<br>
gently mixed. Proportions (1:6 or 1:8) of cell mixture were dispensed into culture<br>
flasks containing 40 ±/-5 ml of fresh Growth medium warmed to 37oC.<br>
[00222] PBMC Cells<br>
[00223] PBMCs were obtained from unanimous donors.<br>
[00224] Preparation of A549 or MG-63 cells for PBMC Induced Cytotoxlc Assay<br>
[00225] Media was removed from the A549 or MG-63 Working Culture T-175 flask.<br>
The monolayers were washed twice with 10 to 15 ml PBS. Three to 5 ml STV were<br>
added to each flask and the flasks were then incubated for 5 minutes or until cells<br>
started to detach. Flasks were gently tapped to detach cells. Five ml of Growth<br>
Medium were added to each flask and cells gently triturated with a pipette to prepare<br>
a single cell suspension. Cells were transferred to a 50 ml conical tube and an<br>
additional 25m! Growth Media was added. The tube was inverted to mix cells,<br>
yielding a cell concentrate. Cell density was determined in the cell concentrate.<br>
Briefly, a 1:3 dilution of the cell suspension was counted using a model Z1 Coulter<br>
counter. For A549 cells the lower threshold of the counter was set to 8 microns and<br>
for MG-63 cells set to 8 microns.<br>
[00226] For A549 cells the cells were concentrated to 50,000 cells/ml in Growth<br>
Assay Medium. For MG-63 cells the cells were concentrated to 65,000 cells/ml in<br>
Growth Assay Medium. The total number of cells needed was calculated by<br>
multiplying the total volume of media needed by the seeding density. The volume of<br>
cell concentrate needed (C) was calculated by dividing the total number of cells<br>
needed by the cell density of concentrate. The volume of additional growth/assay<br>
media needed (GAM) was calculated by subtracting the volume of cell concentrate<br>
from the volume of media needed. The proper seeding density of target cells used<br>
for PBMC induced cytotoxic assay was determined by combining (C) and (GAM).<br>
[00227] The ceil suspension was prepared in a disposable Erlenmeyer flask or<br>
tissue culture glassware. Cells were added to assay plates within 15 minutes. One<br>
hundred ml of the suspension (5000 cells / well for A649 cells and 6500 cells / well for<br>
MG-63 cells) were added to each well. The plates were incubated with lids for 18 to<br>
24 hours in a humidified 37° ±2°C, 5 ±0.5% CO2 incubator.<br>
[00228] Initial Sample Preparation and Serial dilutions in transfer plates<br>
[00229] Initial Screening Assay<br>
[00230] In order to improve the chance of detecting inducers of PBMC cytotoxicity<br>
the samples were initially propped at a relatively high concentration. The sample<br>
concentration was reduced in subsequent assays depending on sample activity.<br>
[00231] Low concentration CCL21 Samples:<br>
[00232] Low protein concentration samples of CCL21 (below 3000 mg /ml) were<br>
diluted to between 400 and 600 mg/ml with PBS (without calcium or magnesium).<br>
FBS and l-glutamine were added to make the sample 10% FBS and 1% l-glutamine.<br>
Samples were loaded into the 1st well of a 96 well plate neat (240 ml volume).<br>
One:two serial dilutions were done in a 96 well transfer plate into PBS with 10% FBS<br>
and 1% l-glutamine.<br>
[00233] Samples that started out at a high concentration (of protein, or activity, or<br>
cells, or virus) were propped as described for low concentration protein samples or<br>
prepped into growth/ assay media directly. Samples were loaded into the 1st well of a<br>
96 well plate neat (240 //I volume). One two serial dilutions were done in a 96 well<br>
transfer plate into growth assay media.<br>
[00234] Baculovirus samples:<br>
[00235] BV samples were diluted from 1:2 to 1:10 in growth / assay media (GAM)<br>
and serially diluted as described above into GAM.<br>
[00236] b-lFH or IL-2:<br>
[00237] Final vial samples of b-IFN or IL-2 were reconstituted in the proper diluent<br>
(saline or water for injection). Reconstituted b-lFN was at 0.25 mg/ml - 13.9mM,<br>
reconstituted IL-2 was at 1.1 mg/ml = 64.7mM. A 200,000 lU/ml working stock of<br>
either cytokine was made by further diluting with growth assay media (GAM). The<br>
b-IFN lot 1FN-01-001 was diluted 1: 35.75 with GAM. The IL-2 lot MLAPM006 was<br>
diluted 1:91.75 with GAM. Subsequent dilutions to assay concentration were with<br>
GAM. IL-2 was diluted to 2000IU/ml for assay b-IFN was diluted to 2000 lU/ml for<br>
assay.<br>
[00238] High Concentration CCL21 Samples:<br>
[00239] CCL21 samples with concentrations above 3 mg /ml were diluted to assay<br>
concentration of 200 to 600 mg/ml with GAM.<br>
[00240] Transfer of sample dilutions to Target Cell (Assay) plates:<br>
[00241] The contents of the dilution plate were transferred to the assay (Cell) plate.<br>
The final sample concentration was ½ that of the original dilution plate. A propette<br>
with plate to plate transfer program for was used for the transfer. Assay plates were<br>
incubated while prepping the PBMCs.<br>
[00242] Toxiclty Control plate for direct cytotoxicity of test samples to target<br>
cells:<br>
[00243] Two identical transfer (dilution) plates were established, and media<br>
transferred to 2 Cell plates. To Plate 1 50mI of PBMC prep was added for induced<br>
cytotoxicity measurements. To the 2nd plate, 50mI PBMC prep media was added for<br>
measuring direct cytotoxicity of test samples.<br>
[00244] Isolating peripheral blood mononuclear ceils (PBMC) from Human<br>
Peripheral Blood<br>
[00245] A 1:10 dilution of bleach (3 liters), was prepared. All the tubes and pipettes<br>
contacting with blood were bleached over night. The beaker was drained and all<br>
Hems discarded in a sharps or biohazard container. The caps were removed from<br>
the 50 ml tubes before handling the blood (to prevent contaminating the caps with<br>
blood). The blood was added to 250ml disposable polycarbonate flask and diluted<br>
with an equal volume of HBSS. Approximately 17ml of ficoll-plaque solution per 50<br>
ml polystyrene tube was added 30 minutes before adding the blood. The blood was<br>
layered on the top of the ficoll-plaque solution without disturbing the ficoll layer. Four<br>
ml blood/HBSS was added for each 3 ml ficoll-plaque. (i.e. 17ml ficoll and 23 ml<br>
blood/HBSS per 50ml tube).<br>
[00246] Tubes were centrifuged at 1800 RPM (400 xg) for 30minutes at room temp.<br>
(Sorval GLC-2B centrifuge). As much of the top layer as possible was aspirated<br>
using a 25ml serological pipette, leaving about 5 ml on top of the second layer. A 5<br>
ml serological pipette was used to remove the rest of the first layer. The second<br>
layer, containing the B and T lymphocytes, was collected using a sterile 5ml<br>
serological pipette and placed into a new 50ml tube. The collection was diluted with<br>
3x the volume of RPMI with no additives. The resulting solution was centrifuged at<br>
900 rpm (100 x g) for 15-20 minutes. (Wash 1). The supernatant was removed with<br>
a serological pipette and the cells resuspended in 40 ml RPMI and centrifugation<br>
was repeated at 900 rpm (Wash 2). The supernatant was removed with a<br>
serological pipette and the cells resuspended in 40 ml PBMC prep media (RPMI with<br>
0.5% BSA). The total volume of the re-suspended cells was accurately recorded.<br>
The cells were counted with a Coulter counter to determine the cell density— a 1:5<br>
dilution of cell concentrate in PBMC prep media was used for the count).<br>
[00247] The re-suspension volume needed to attain proper ceil density was<br>
determined. For the Cytotoxic Assay the desired density was 2 x 106 cells /ml and<br>
for freezing of the PBMCs the desired density was 10 x 106 cells/ml. The final re-<br>
suspension volume was calculated by multiplying cell density by total volume and<br>
then dividing the product by the final desired cell density (2 or 10 x 106 cell/ml).<br>
[00248] Centrifugation was repeated at 900rpm with the remainder of the re-<br>
suspended cells. (Wash3). The supernatant was removed and resuspended in final<br>
re-suspend volume. The cell density was confirmed with a Coulter counter (a 1:10<br>
dilution of cell concentrate in PBMC prep media was used for the count).<br>
[00248] PBMC Prep for Assay<br>
[00250] For immediate use in assay, cells were resuspended in PBMC prep media.<br>
The ceils were further diluted 1:2 in PBMC prep Media to a final cell density of 1 x<br>
106 cell / ml. The cells were added to Assay plates with target cells 50 ml/well (50000<br>
PBMCs/well). PBMCs were added with a Multichannel pipette. Assay plates were<br>
incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 3 to 4 days.<br>
[00251] PBMC Prep for Freezing<br>
[00252] For freezing cells were resuspended in 90% FBS (heat inactivated) + 10%<br>
DMSO and frozen at a density of 10 x 106 cells/ml. The cells were aliquoted in 2ml<br>
sterile cryotubes and frozen in isopropyl alcohol in cryo-freezing containers in -70°C<br>
freezer. The final cell density was confirmed with a Coulter counter.<br>
[00253] Thawing frozen PBMCs for Assay<br>
[00254] Frozen aliquots of PBMCs were quickly thawed in 37°C water bath. Cells in<br>
were resuspended in 13ml RPMI 1640 in a conical centrifuge tube and then<br>
centrifuged at 900 rpm (100 x g) for 15-20 minutes. The supernatant was removed<br>
with a serological pipette and the cells were resuspended in 13 ml PBMC prep media<br>
(RPM! with 0.5% BSA). Cells were counted with a Coulter counter to determine the<br>
cell density - a 1:5 dilution of cell concentrate in PBMC prep media was performed<br>
for the count).<br>
[00255] The re-suspension volume needed to attain proper cell density was then<br>
determined. For the Cytotoxic Assay the desired cell density was 2 x 106 cells /ml.<br>
The final re-suspension volume was determined by muliplying the Cell density by the<br>
total volume and ten dividing the product by the final desired cell density (2 or 10 x<br>
106 cell/ml). Centrifugation was repeated at 900rpm with the remainder of the re-<br>
suspended ceils. The supernatant was removed and the cells resuspended in final<br>
re-suspend volume.<br>
[00256] The cell density was confirmed with a Coulter counter - a 1:10 dilution of cell<br>
concentrate in PBMC prep media was performed for the count). Cells were further<br>
diluted 1:2 in Growth Assay Media to a final cell density of 1 x 106 cell / ml. Cells-<br>
were then added to Assay plates with target cells 50 //I/well (50000 PBMCs/well).<br>
PBMCs were added with a Multichannel pipette. Assay plates were incubated at<br>
37°C and 5% CO2for 3 to 4 days.<br>
[00257] Staining of Assay plate with Alamar Blue<br>
[00258] After 3 to 4 days of incubation, the media was aspirated from the assay<br>
plates. One hundred mI/well Alamar Blue staining media (10% Alamar Blue in RPMI<br>
with 0.5% BSA) was added, and the plates incubated for 2 to 3 hours. The response<br>
was measured using either a spectrophotometer (Absorbance at 570nm - 630nm) or<br>
flourometrically (excitation at 530nm and Emission at 590nm).<br>
[00259] Assay ActivityThe assay activity was defined as the reference well<br>
response divided by the sample well with PBMC response. In most cases the<br>
reference well was the no PBMC control well for the sample at the same sample<br>
concentration as the PBMC well, usually at the highest sample concentration (the 1st<br>
well in the dilution series). In some instances when there was insufficient sample to<br>
run a no PBMC control plate the reference well is a PBS/growth media well with or<br>
without PBMCs.<br>
[00261] When enough sample was present for a no PBMC control plate, the activity<br>
was set as equal to the Direct Cytotox response / Induced Cytotox response. As<br>
shown in Figure 14, in vitro data correlates with in vivo data.<br>
[00263] Example 13. Anti-gp64 Monoclonal Antibodies Blocks Baculovirus<br>
Tumor Cell Killing<br>
[00264] Starting material of baculovirus (CA3) was treated with anti-gp64. Briefly, 1-<br>
500 mg of purified mouse anti-gp64 monoclonal antibody (clone 1.3A provided by Dr.<br>
Donald Jarvis, U. of WY) or Ig control was mixed with various infectious units of<br>
recombinant baculovirus in a controlled volume. The binding of antibody to virus was<br>
conducted at room temperature, in the dark for approximately 15 hours. Samples<br>
were refrigerated for 1-2 days prior to plaque or cytotoxicfty assay. Samples were<br>
tested in the cytotoxicity assay as described above. See Figure 15.<br>
[00265] Example 14. Inactivated Baculovlrus Induces PBMC-Medlated Tumor<br>
Cell Killing In vitro<br>
[00266] Starting material of baculovirus (CD3) was inactivated by treatment with<br>
trioxalen and UV light Baculovirus was photo-inactivated by psoralen and ultra-violet<br>
light (Weightman. S. A. and Banks, M. J. Virol. Met. 81:179-182 (1999)). Insect cell<br>
culture media containing baculovirus was transferred (3 mL, approximately 6E7 pfu)<br>
to a 6-well ceil culture plate (Costar). A stock solution of 4,5',8-trimethyl psoralen<br>
(trioxalen) was prepared at 2 mg/mL in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and added to<br>
each well to a final concentration of 100 mg/mL. The culture dish was then exposed<br>
to ultra-violet (365 nm) light for 15 minutes by placing a hand-held lamp (Model UVL-<br>
56, UVP, Upland, CA) 1.5 cm over the plate. Control samples included DMSO with<br>
no psoralen, as well as a non-irradiated control with psoralen. After irradiation,<br>
media was transferred to a 10 MWCO dialysis cartridge (Slidalyzer, Pierce) and<br>
dialysed against phosphate-buffered saline. All samples were assayed for plaque-<br>
forming activity on Sf-9 cells. Samples were tested in the cytotoxicity assay as<br>
described above, and results are set forth in Figure 16.<br>
[00267] Example 15. Tumor Cells are the Principle Target for Baculovirus<br>
[00268] Intact monolayers of A549 target cells were treated with baculovirus for 3<br>
hours and then washed 3 times with growth assay media. At the same time effector<br>
cells (PBMSc) were also treated with baculovirus for 3 hours and washed 3 times.<br>
Baculovirus treated and untreated target and effector cells were combined as<br>
follows: 1) Untreated target cells alone; 2) Untreated target and effector cells; 3)<br>
Baculovirus treated target cells and untreated PBMCs; and 4) Untreated target cells<br>
and baculovirus treated PBMCs.<br>
[00269] After 4 days incubation the target cell viability was measured as described in<br>
SOP. The cell viability measurement, as determined by Alamar Blue fluorescence,<br>
was the mean of 16 wells per group (experiment was performed in a 96 well format).<br>
Results are set forth in Figure 17.<br>
[00270] Example 16. Tumor Growth Inhibition in an Animal Model of Lung<br>
Cancer Using Baculovirus<br>
[00271] C57BL/6 mice at 8-10 weeks of age were allowed to acclimate for a<br>
minimum of 7 days prior to inoculation with tumor cells. Mice were inoculated s.c at<br>
the right flank with 2 X 105 early passage (
Tumor size was measured twice per week. When tumors reached 50-100 mm3<br>
(typically 7 days after tumor inoculation), mice were randomized into groups and<br>
received their first dose of Baculovirus intratumoraily on the same day. The dosing<br>
schedule was qd X 6 days. The mice were placed in four groups as follows: 1)<br>
Albumin negative control 25 mg/dose (0.5 mg/ml); 2) Live virus positive control (titer<br>
about 1X107/ml); 3) live virus negative control (titer about 800/ml); and 4) inactivated<br>
virus (titer about 800/ml). Tumors were measured twice a week for up to four<br>
weeks. When tumor volume reached 2500 mm3 or when any of the following<br>
symptoms were seen the mice were sacrificed. The symptoms were body weight<br>
loss is more than 20%, tumor ulceration areas is more than 30% of tumor surface<br>
area or less than 30% of tumor surface but has openings, bleeding or discharging,<br>
server difficulty in breath, or moribund.<br>
[00272] As shown in Figure t8 intratumoral administration of Baculovirus resulted in<br>
growth delay of 3LL tumors.<br>
[00273] Example 17. Protection from Infectious Agents In Vitro and In Vivo<br>
Using Baculovirus<br>
[00274] Live baculovirus has been shown to induce interferons (IFN) from murine<br>
and human cell lines and induces in vivo protection of mice from<br>
encephalornyocarditis virus infection. However, inactivation of the baculovirus by<br>
UV, for example, eliminates both infectivity and IFN-inducing activity. (Gronowski et<br>
a!.. J Virology, Dec. 1999, p. 9944-9951 Vol. 73, No. 12).<br>
[00275] To study the effect of baculovirus on infectious agents, cells were<br>
challenged in vivo and in vitro with Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV). As shown in<br>
Figure 19, cells or medium treated with Sf9 and baculovirus or with Sf9 and<br>
baculovirus media provided maximal protection against VSV in vitro. As shown in<br>
Figure 19, inactivated baculovirus protects in vivo and in vitro against pathogenic<br>
viral challenge.<br>
[00276] Example 18: Bystander Effect<br>
[00277] To Investigate whether the inhibition of tumor cells is only direct (i.e. that<br>
each cell must be specifically targeted by a non-pathogenic virus) infected tumor<br>
cells and non-infected tumor cells were mixed in different proportions.<br>
[00278] A549 or MG-63 cell lines or PBMCs, were exposed to an activating dose of<br>
baculovirus for 3 to 5 hours. After exposure to baculovirus the excess or non-binding<br>
virus was washed off from the responder cells. The washed BV treated cells were<br>
then mixed with non-treated responder cells in various proportions. For PBMCs the<br>
mixture of BV treated and non-treated ceils were added to non-treated A549 or MG-<br>
63 target cells. Likewise, the mixture of BV treated A549 or MG-63 target cells were<br>
added to non-treated PBMCs. Non-BV treated ceils were physically handled the<br>
same as BV treated cells.<br>
[00279] PBMCs were treated with BV only while the cells were kept in suspension<br>
while shaking in a CO2 incubator. The cells were washed by centrifugation, decanted<br>
and re-suspended (3 times) followed by mixing with non-treated PBMCs. The A549<br>
and MG-63 target cells were treated with BV in 2 ways. Either the intact monolayer<br>
was treated with BV followed by gentle washing in place with fresh growth media,<br>
then non-treated target cells were added to the assay plates, or while in suspension<br>
as described for the PBMCs.<br>
[00280] If the Baculovirus was removed from the A549 and MG-63 target cells for an<br>
extended time before the addition of PBMCs there was a rapid loss of the cytotoxic<br>
response in the cytoxicity assay. By 20 hours after removal of the baculovirus the<br>
cytotoxic response was entirely gone with the A549 cells and mostly gone for the<br>
MG-63 cells. (Data not shown)<br>
[00281] Washing of the baculovirus treated target cell monolayer in place, then<br>
mixing with non-treated cells and immediate addition of PBMCs results in a<br>
bystander effect for both A649 and MG-63 target cells.<br>
[00282] BV treatment of PBMCs or A549 cells in suspension followed by centrifugal<br>
washing (3 cycles of centrifugation, decant, re-suspend) effectively eliminated the<br>
cytotoxic response.<br>
[00283] BV treatment and centrifugal washing of MG-63 cells was less effective in<br>
removing the cytotoxic response with MG-63 target cells.<br>
[00284] PBMCs treated with BV in suspension while shaking followed by centrifugal<br>
washing seemed to result in a significant non-specific (in wells with 0% BV treated<br>
cells) stimulation of the cytotoxic response against MG-63 target cells but not A549<br>
cells.<br>
[00285] As seen in Figure 20, when the total cell volume was 20% infected cells and<br>
80% non-infected cells, cell death was observed at the maximal response.<br>
Therefore, the non-infected cells were killed by what is known by the bystander<br>
effect (i.e. being In the vicinity of targeted cells promotes the ceil death of non-<br>
targeted (infected) ceils).<br>
