				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of N-methyl-N-(l-naphthylmethyl)-6,6-dimethyl-2-hydroxyheptan-4-ynyl-1 -amine. The N-methyl-N-( 1 -naphthylmethyl)-6,6-dimethyl-2-hydroxyheptan-4-ynyl-l-amine prepared by the process of the present invention which has the formula-I given below is a key intermediate used in the synthesis of terbinafme [(E)-N-(6,6-dimethyl-2-hepten-4-ynyl)-N-methyl-l-naphthalenemethanamine] of the formula-II. Terbinafme is a fungistatic antimycotic. It blocks ergosterol synthesis by squalene epoxidase inhibition, effects fungicidally upon dermatophytes, yeasts, dimorphous fungi and micromycetes. It has a very good passage into adipose tissue (skin and nails).<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The compound of the formula-I is reported for the first time in Canadian patent no 2,185,599 and subsequently in US patent no 5,817,875. This compound is dehydrated under various conditions to get a mixture of E and Z-terbinafine in various ratios depending upon the conditions employed.<br>
According to the process disclosed in the above Canadian and US patents N-methyl-N-naphthylmethylamine of the formula-Ill is reacted with excess of epichlorohydrin in the presence of a base to get the epoxy compound of the formula-IV (Scheme-I). Surprisingly the epoxy compound of the formula-IV was not found to be reactive towards lithium tert-butylacetylene in an inert solvent like THE. To overcome this problem borontrifluoride-etherate was used in the reaction, which required -78°C. Also, the process requires butyl lithium in making lithium tert-butylacetylene.    After the usual water workup the<br><br>
compound of formula-I was isolated in crude form. The crude compound of the formula-I was purified by column chromatography to isolate it as an oil.<br><br>
The main drawback in this process is that it requires a Lewis acid like borontrifluoride-etherate, which is corrosive and requires special handling on a plant scale. Handling of n-butyl lithium in making the lithium tert-butylacetylene is not economically viable on commercial scale. Also, the reagent is highly flammable and requires special handling in transport as well as in use. Although the yield claimed in the above process is 79%, it required one column chromatography, which is not suitable on plant scale operations. All these things make the process not commercially attractive.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
During our sustained research on developing a commercially viable process for the preparation of the compound of the formula-I, we realized that avoidance of (i) reaction at a temperature as low as -78°C (ii) handling of n-butyl lithium (iii) handling of borontrifluoride-etherate and (iv) the usage of column chromatography would be beneficial. We also observed that the compound of the formula-I could be readily crystallized from a non-polar hydrocarbon solvent.<br><br>
Keeping in view of the difficulties in implementing the reported conditions for the preparation of the compound of the formula-I, we turned our attention towards developing simple conditions and reagents to make the compound of the formula-I.<br>
According to the literature (L. Brandsma &amp; H. D. Verkruijsse, Synthesis of acetylenes, allenes and cumulenes, Elsevier 1981, p 17-18) available on acetylenic compounds Grignard reagents derived from acetylenic compounds are reactive enough towards epoxides under normal conditions. Also preparation of these acetylenic Grignard reagents is easy and will not require any low temperature or hazardous conditions. Based on this information and on our realizing the avoidance of the above reactions conditions and reagents, we were successfiil in developing an improved process for the preparation of the compound of the formula-I.<br>
Therefore the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of the compound of the formula-I, which is a key intermediate for the preparation of terbinafine of the formula-II, which is simple, economical and commercially viable.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of the compound of the formula-I, which is a key intermediate for the preparation of terbinafine of the formula-ll avoiding the temperature as low as -78°C for the reaction.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of the compound of the formula-I which is a key intermediate for the preparation of terbinafine of the formula-II avoiding the use of n-butyl lithium in the reaction thereby making the process simple and user friendly.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of the compound of the formula-I, which is a key intermediate for the<br><br>
preparation of terbinafine of the formula-II avoiding the use of borontrifluoride-etherate thereby making the process further simple and user friendly.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of the compound of the formula-I, which is a key intermediate for the preparation of terbinafine of the formula-II avoiding the usage of column chromatography again making the process simple.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of the compound of the formula-I, which is a key intermediate for the preparation of terbinafine of the formula-II employing simple crystallization process using a non-polar hydrocarbon solvent to get a pure compound of the formula-I.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of the compound of the formula-I,<br><br>
I a key intermediate used in the preparation of terbinafine of the formula-II,<br><br>
which comprises:<br><br>
(i)       Preparing  3,3-dimethyl-l-butynylmagnesium  halide by  treating tert-butyl acetylene with lower alkyl magnesium halide at a temperature in the range of<br>
-5°C to 0°C (ii)       Adding the epoxy compound of the formula-IV<br><br>
to the resulting acetylenic Grignard reagent of step (i) at a temperature in the range of<br>
0°C to -30°C<br>
(iii) Slowly heating the resulting reaction mixture to the reflux temperature of the solvent employed in the reaction<br>
(iv)      Quenching the reaction mass with saturated ammonium chloride<br>
(v)      Filtering the reaction mass to remove the magnesium salts and<br>
(vi)     Distilling of the solvent and<br>
(vii) isolating the compound of the formula-I by simple crystallization from a non-polar hydrocarbon solvent.<br>
From the above defined process it would be observed that the process (i) avoids the usage of hazardous reagent like butyl lithium making the process user friendly, (ii) avoids the usage of borontrifluoride etherate, thereby making the process not only economical but also environment friendly pollutant (iii) avoids the usage of column chromatography thereby making the process commercially feasible and simplifying the purification of the compound of formula-I and (iv) isolating the compound of formula-I as a crystalline solid. Such a process for the preparation of compound of the formula I is not hitherto known and therefore it is a novel process. Accordingly the process developed and defined above is a novel process.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, 3,3.dimethyl-l-butynylmagnesium halide is prepared by treating tert-butylacetylene with lower alkylmagnesium halide in solvents preferably, ether such as THF, diethyl ether, 1,4-dioxane alone or in combination with non-polar solvent such as toluene, cyclohexane, heptane, hexane, etc.. The lower alkymagnesium halide required in the conversion of tert-butylacetylene into its magnesium derivative is methylmagnesium bromide or iodide, ethylmagnesium bromide or iodide, etc, preferably ethylmagnesium bromide. Temperature of the reaction can be between -5°C to 25°C. Addition of the compound of the formula-IV to 3,3-dimethyl-l-butynylmagnesium halide should be done at 0°Cto -20°C, preferably at -15°C to -20°C. After the addition of the compound of the formula-IV to 3,3-dimethyl-l-butynylmagnesium bromide the reaction mass should be slowly heated to reflux temperature (between 50°C -70°C). The rate of heating to reflux temperature should be in such a way that it takes at least 4-6hrs to reach reflux temperature.<br>
Workup of the reaction should be done by adding saturated ammonium chloride to the reaction mass, preferably at 0-30°C. The amount of saturated ammonium chloride should be on a molar basis to the amount of Grignard reagent used in the reaction, preferably 1.5 to 2.0 equivalents. This will avoid the water workup and the product can be directly isolated from the reaction mass by simple filtration and distillation of solvent.<br>
Purity of the crude compound of formula-I prepared according to the present invention was found to be 85 to 90% by HPLC. This is sufficiently pure enough for further conversion to terbinafine of formula-II. However, it can be crystallized from solvents like pentane, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, or a mixture of these solvents with diisopropyl ether. Isolated compound of the formula-I melted at 52°C.<br>
The invention is described in detail in the Examples given below which are provided only by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention further illustrated by the following example.<br><br>
