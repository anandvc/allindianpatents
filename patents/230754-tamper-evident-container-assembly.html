				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to an improved tamper evident closure assembly for use on containers employed for storing and transporting liquids such as water, juices, milk, and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND:<br>
Liquids such as water, milk, juices, petrol and other similar liquids are stored and transported in sealed containers. The possibility of tamper occurring prior to the product reaching a consumer cannot be ruled out and is a common problem faced by manufacturers. Tamper with edible products may prove hazardous to health. One of the common products susceptible to tamper is water. Water is stored in a container provided with a neck surrounding an aperture. The aperture is sealed using appropriate sealing methods. The container is loaded onto a dispenser by lifting and inverting the container and placing the neck onto a receptacle in the dispenser adapted to receive and hold the container in an inverted position.<br>
When the container is placed on the dispenser, a sharp device on the dispenser punctures a hole in the cap of the container allowing the water to be discharged through the aperture, through a tube or other passages formed in the receptacle and into a chamber in the dispenser where the water may be cooled or heated, if desired. The user may draw the water from the chamber through a stop cork or a valve.<br>
Thus, the common cap used for containers consists of a cover that is adapted to fit with the mouth of the container loaded with the liquid. The cap is provided with a central recessed portion which is relatively thin and adapted to be easily pierced by any sharp device. Such a cap is shown in Figure 1.<br>
A major disadvantage of the cap shown in figure 1 is that it can be easily separated from the neck of the container and replaced by any other identical closure device, permitting the contents of such containers to be easily tampered with, without any evidence whatsoever of tamper to the user.<br>
For these reasons, there is a need to provide a container assembly which limits the ability of a person to tamper with the contents of the container and if tampered, alerts the user by providing an evidence thereof.   Towards this end, the present invention<br><br><br>
provides an improved container assembly so designed that any unauthorized interference with the contents of the container after it is loaded by the manufacturer leaves behind visual evidence of tamper.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide an improved tamper evident container assembly for use on a container.<br>
Another object is to provide an improved container assembly comprising a cap and an improved dislodging member.<br>

The well of the cap as well as the plug may optionally be provided with threads so that the plug is screwed to the cap. Further, optionally, the plug may be provided with clips to engage with the well of the cap.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION;<br>
Accordingly, to fulfil its objects, the invention provides a tamper evident container assembly comprising a cap and a dislodging member wherein the means of tamper evidence is separated permanently into the cavity of the container after single use i.e once dislodged and said tamper evidence means cannot thereafter exit from the cavity of the container. Thus, presence of tamper evidence means in a container filled with a liquid alerts the user to the possibility of the contents of the container being tampered with.<br>
As used herein, the means of tamper evidence is a means or device whose presence in the container, especially a container containing a liquid alerts the user of tamper if any, with the contents of the container. An example of such a tamper evidence means may be a coloured material, a packet of colour or a plug or any other similar material.<br>
Storage condition denotes the condition wherein the cap is well fitted to the mouth of the container by the manufacturer (after the container has been filled) and the means of tamper evidence is attached to the cap away from the contents of the container. 'Fit' as used herein and in its broadest sense denotes that the means of tamper evidence fits into the cap snugly, irrespective of the manner of fitting to the cap.<br><br>
The dislodging member is a means that is capable of passing through the cap and dislodging the means of tamper evidence from the cap and enabling withdrawal of the contents of the container. The dislodging member may be such as a spindle assembly or a battery operated pump. Whatever be the dislodging member, its function is to dislodge the tamper evidence means from the cap into the cavity of the container. Optionally, it may carry a retainer that is capable of retaining with itself the means of tamper evidence after it dislodged or disengages the means of tamper evidence from the cap. Such a retainer may be a magnet or a simple annular groove depending on the means of tamper evidence.<br>
Use condition is the condition wherein the user employs the dislodging means to separate the means of tamper evidence from the cap and withdraws the contents of the container.<br>
After-use condition denotes the condition wherein the user has used the contents of the container and withdraws the dislodging member from the container. At such time, the means of tamper evidence is dropped into the cavity of the container. This may be achieved by dimensioning the means of tamper evidence such that it cannot exit the container at any time after being once dislodged from the cap. It is possible because the force required to dislodge the tamper evidence means from the cap and the force required to position it back to the cap of the container are different: the force required for the latter is more and usually absent. In the alternative, the container may be provided with means such as a lug, perhaps nearabout the neck of the cap which prevents exit of the means of tamper evidence from the cavity of the container.<br>
Thus, once the tamper evidence means is dislodged from the cap of the container, it cannot be restored to its original position i.e to fit back with the cap of the container. It would be left in the container. Further, a permanent recess would get created in the cap of the container on account of entry of the dislodging member, which again cannot be rectified otherwise than by the manufacturer.<br>
If an used container is refilled unauthqrisedly, such a refilled container would include the tamper evidence means in the cavity of the container and presence of tamper<br><br>
evidence means in the cavity would indicate to the consumer that the contents of the container have been tampered with.<br>
As an illustration of this principle is provided an embodiment illustrated by figures 2 to 6, although various other constructions may be possible employing the principle of the invention. The intention of the inventors is to include within the fold of this invention all such constructions that may be made by a skilled person and not depicted by the figures herein.<br>
Figures 2(a) and 2(b) depict a possible construction of a. cap of a container and a plug as a tamper evidence means used to close the cap of the container. As shown in figure 2(a) is a cap(20) and a means of tamper evidence(lO) to close the cap. The cap (20) consists of a disc (21) and a skirt (23) depending from the disc. A central well (25) may be disposed within the disc of the cap and may be provided with side walls (27). At least one end of the well may be open.<br>
Figure 2(b) shows the cap in inverted position wherein the plug (10) has closed the well (25) in the cap (20). The plug as shown consists of a basal disc (3) and plug walls (7) emerging from the disc. The interior of the plug is hollow and it has one open end. The plug is dimensioned to snugly fit into the well (25) of the cap (20). It may fit inside the cap or outside the cap or if the cap is double walled, within the walls.<br>
The plug and the cap may be made in different designs and modifications. An example of such a modification is the screw-on engagement system wherein the well of the cap as well as the plug are provided with threads so that the plug can be screwed to the cap. Another variation is the click-on system wherein the plug may be provided with clips to engage with the well of the cap. These modifications are shown in Figure 6.<br>
After a container is loaded, the cap is fitted onto the mouth of the container by a conventional capping equipment, with the plug fitted onto and closing the well of the cap as shown in figure 2(b) and 2(c)(i). The user thus receives a container which is sealed and contents loaded.<br><br>
At the time of consumption, the container is either inverted onto a dispensing equipment (not shown). The contents of the container may be withdrawn by an appropriate withdrawal means or a dislodging member, such as a spindle assembly or a battery-operated suction pump, as shown in figures 3-5.<br>
As shown in figure 3, the spindle assembly (30) comprises a basal portion (31) and an erect portion (33). If desired, the tip may be blunted (35). Further, the tip may be provided with an annular groove (37), dimensioned to accommodate and engage with the open end (9) of the plug (10). Providing such a groove would assist in retaining the plug with the spindle after the plug has been dislodged from the cap.<br>
This feature i.e. the annular groove may be totally absent if the intention is to allow the plug to float in the container after being dislodged from the cap of the container.<br>
As the spindle (30) is inserted into a container that has been capped, the spindle enters the well (25) of the top-cap (20). With the pressure applied on the top-cap (20), the plug (10) gets separated from the top-cap and engages with the annular groove (37) on the erect portion (33) of the spindle (30). The spindle is also provided with a cavity (36) and a means for to facilitate discharge of water by the user. With the separation of the plug from the top-cap, the contents of the container can be easily withdrawn by the user through a spout or other appropriate means. Figure 2(c)(ii) shows a spindle inserted into a cap of a container.<br>
In an embodiment shown in figures 4 and 5, a battery-operated pump (40) may be used as dislodging member to withdraw the contents from the container. Such a pump may comprise a housing (41) accommodating a battery and other necessary means for operation, and a tubular portion (43) emerging from the housing. The end of the tubular portion is provided with cavity (45) for dispensing liquid and pump means (not shown) to facilitate withdrawal of contents of the container. The tip (47) of the tubular portion may be blunted and optionally, provided with an annular groove (49) dimensioned to accommodate the open end of the plug. The annular groove may be omitted if the intention is to keep the plug floating in the cavity of the container.<br><br>
In use, the tip of the pump is placed on the well of the cap and forced in the direction of the cavity of the container, whereby the plug is disengaged from the cap and carried away by the tip of the dislodging member(if the retainer or annular groove is present), facilitating withdrawal of water by an user.<br>
Once the water is completely used up, the container is separated from the dispenser. At such time, the container is also separated from the dislodging member i.e the spindle or battery operated pump. As the container is separated from the dispenser, exit of the plug from the cavity of the container is prevented since the force required to restore it to its original position i.e to fit with the cap, is absent when the dislodging member is removed from the cavity of the container. Optionally, the cap of the container itself may be provided with means such as lug which prevent exit of the plug from the cavity of the container once dislodged from the cap.<br>
In addition to the above system, the cap is so designed that it can be taken out only at the manufacturing location with the help of the mechanical decapper.<br>
Evidence of tamper<br>
The cap is so dimensioned and designed that it can be fitted onto the mouth of the container only by a capping equipment. It cannot be separated manually from the mouth of the container. Since the cap cannot be taken out manually, the only way water can be refilled by any person would be by dislodging the plug. As illustrated above, the plug once dislodged is incapable of exit from the cavity of the container and will be present in the container, if reused, indicating that the container has been tampered with.<br>
In addition, the size of the top-cap, the plug, the spindle assembly and pump assembly are different from those available in the market.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
