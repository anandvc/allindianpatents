This application claims benefit of U. S. Provisional Patent Application 60/565, filed April 27, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety to the extent not inconsistent with the disclosure therein.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION: <br>
The present invention relates to a composite patterning device for generating a pattern on a substrate surface. The present invention also relates to methods of generating a pattern on a substrate surface and to method of making a composite patterning device<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The design and fabrication olmicrometer sized structures and devices have had an enormous impact on a number of important technologies including microelectronics, optoelectronics, microfluidics and microsensing. The ability to make micro-sized electronic devices, for example, has revolutionized the electronics field resulting in faster and higher performing electronic components requiring substantially less power. As these technologies continue to rapidly develop, it has become increasingly apparent that additional gains are to be realized by developing the ability to manipulate and organize matter on the scale of nanometers. Advances in nanoscience and technology promise to dramatically impact many areas of technology ranging from materials science to applied engineering to biotechnology.<br>
Fabrication of devices having nanoscale dimensions is not merely a natural extension of the concept of miniaturization, but a fundamentally different regime in which physical and chemical behavior deviates from larger scale systems. For example, the behavior of nanoscale assemblies of many materials is greatly influenced by their large interfacial volume, fractions and quantum mechanical effects due to electronic confinement. The ability to make structures having well-defined features on the scale of nanometers has opened up the possibility of making devices based on properties and processes only occurring at nanometer dimensions, such single-electron tunneling, Coulomb blockage and quantum size effect. The development of commercially practical methods of fabricating sub-micrometer sized structures from a wide range of materials, however, is critical to continued advances in nanoscience and technology.<br>
Photolithography is currently the most prevalent method of microfabrication, and nearly all integrated electronic circuits are made using this technique. In conventional projection mode photolithography, an optical image corresponding to a selected two dimensional pattern is generated using a photomask. The image is optically reduced and projected onto a thin film of photoresist spin coated onto a substrate. Alternatively, in Direct Write to Wafer photolithographic techniques, a photoresist is directly exposed to laser light, an electron beam or ion beam without the use of a photomask. Interaction between light, electrons and/or ions and molecules comprising the photoresist chemically alters selected regions of the photoresist in a manner enabling fabrication of structures having well defined physical dimensions. Photolithography is exceptionally well suited for generating two-dimensional distributions of features on flat surfaces. In addition, photolithography is capable of generating more complex three dimensional distributions of features on flat surfaces using additive fabrication methods involving formation of multilayer stacks.<br>
Recent advances in photolithography have extended its applicability to the manufacture of structures having dimensions in the submicron range. For example, nanolithographic techniques, such as deep UV projection mode lithography, soft X-ray lithography, electron beam lithography and scanning probe methods, have been successfully employed to fabricate structures with features on the order of 10s to 100s of nanometers. Although nanolithography provides viable methods of fabricating, structures and devices having nanometer dimensions, these methods have certain limitations that hinder their practical integration into commercial methods providing low cost, high volume processing of nanomaterials. First, nanoiithographic methods require elaborate and expensive steppers or writing tools to direct light, electrons and/or ions onto photoresist surfaces. Second, these methods are limited to patterning a very narrow range of specialized materials, and are poorly suited for introducing specific chemical functionalities into nanostructures. Third, conventional nanolithography is limited to fabrication of nanosized features on small areas of ultra-flat, rigid surfaces of inorganic substrates and, thus is less compatible with patterning on glass, carbon and plastic surfaces. Finally, fabrication of nanostructures comprising features having selectable lengths in three dimensions is difficult due to the limited depth of focus provided  by<br>
nanolithographic   methods,   and   typically   requires   labor   intensive   repetitive processing of multilayers.<br>
The practical limitations of photolithographic methods as applied to nanofabrication have stimulated substantial interest in developing alternative, non-photolithographic methods for fabricating nanoscale structures. In recent years, new techniques based on molding, contact printing and embossing collectively referred to as soft lithography have been developed,. These techniques use a conformable patterning device, such as a stamp, a mold or mask, having a transfer surface comprising a well defined relief pattern. Microsized and nanosized structures are formed by material processing involving conformal contact on a molecular scale between the substrate and the transfer surface of the patterning device. Patterning devices used in soft lithography typically comprise elastomeric materials, such as poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), and are commonly prepared by casting prepolymers against masters generated using conventional photolithography. The mechanical characteristics of the patterning devices are critical to the fabrication of mechanically robust patterns of transferred materials having good fidelity and placement accuracy.<br>
Soft lithographic methods capable of generating microsized and/or nanosized structures include nanotransfer printing, microtransfer molding, replica molding, micromolding in capillaries, near field phase shift lithography, and solvent assisted micromolding. Conventional soft lithographic contact printing methods, for example, have been used to generate patterns of seif assembled monolayers of gold having features with lateral dimensions as small as about 250 nm. Structures generated by soft lithography have been integrated into a range of devices including diodes, photoluminescent porous silican pixels, organic light emitting diodes and thin-film transistors. Other applications of this technology generally include the fabrication flexible electronic components, microelectromechanical systems, microanalytical systems and nanophotonic systems.<br>
Soft lithographic methods for making nanostructures provide a number of benefits important to fabricating nanoscale structures and devices. First, these methods are compatible with a wide range of substrates, such as flexible plastics,<br>
carbonaceous materials, ceramics, silicon and glasses, and tolerate a wide range of transfer materials, including metais, complex organic compounds, colloidal materials, suspensions, biological molecules, cells and salt solutions. Second, soft lithography is capable of generating features of transferred materials both on flat and contoured surfaces, and is capable of rapidly and effectively patterning large areas of substrate. Third, soft lithographic techniques are well-suited for nanofabrication of three dimensional structures characterized by features having selectably adjustable lengths in three-dimensions. Finally, soft lithography provides low cost methods which are potentially adaptable to existing commercial printing and molding techniques.<br>
Although conventional PDMS patterning devices are capable of establishing reproducible conformal contact with a variety of substrate materials and surface contours, use of these devices for making features in the sub-100 nm range are subject to problems associated with pressure induced deformations due to the low modulus (3MPa) and high compressibility (2.0 N/mm2) of conventional single layer PDMS stamps and molds. First, at aspect ratios less than about 0.3, conventional PDMS patterning devices having wide and shallow relief features fend to collapse upon contact with the surface of the substrate. Second, adjacent features of conventional single layer PDMS patterning devices having closely spaced (
Michei and coauthors report microcontact printing methods using a composite stamp composed of a thin bendable layer of metal, glass or polymer attached to an elastomeric layer having a transfer surface with a relief pattern. [Michel et al. Printing Meets Lithography; Soft Approaches to High Resolution<br>
Patterning, IBM J, Res. &amp; Dev.s Vol. 45, No. 5, pgs 697 - 719 (Sept 2001). These authors also describe a composite stamp design consisting of a rigid supporting layer and a polymer backing fayer comprising a first soft polymer layer attached to a second harder layer having a transfer surface with a relief pattern. The authors report that the disclosed composite stamp designs are useful for "large area, high-resolution printing applications with feature sizes as small as 80 nm."<br>
Odom and coauthors disclose a composite, two layer stamp design consisting of a thick (w 3 mm) backing layer of 184 PDMS attached to a thin (30 -40 microns), layer of h-PDMS having a transfer surface with relief patterns , [Odem et a!., Langmuir, Vol. 18, pgs 5314 - 5320 (2002). The composite stamp was used in this study to mold features having dimensions on the order of 100 nm using soft lithography phase shifting photolithography methods. The authors report that the disclosed composite stamp exhibits increase mechanical stability resulting in a reduction in sidewall buckling and sagging with respect to conventional low modulus, single layer PDMS stamps.<br>
Although use of conventional composite stamps and molds have improved to some degree the capabilities of soft lithography methods for generating features having dimensions in the sub-100 nm range, these techniques remain susceptible to a number of problems which hinder there effective commercial application for high throughput fabrication of micro-scale and nanoscale devices. First, some conventional composite stamp and mold designs have limited flexibility and, thus, do not make good conformal contact with contoured or rough surfaces. Second, relief patterns of conventional, multimaterial PDMS stamps are susceptible to undesirable shrinkage during thermal or ultraviolet curing, which distort the relief patterns on their transfer surfaces. Third, use of conventional composite stamps comprising multilayers having different thermal expansion coefficients can result in distortions in relief patterns and curvature of their transfer surfaces induced by changes in temperature. Fourth, use of stiff and/or brittle backing layers, such as glass and some metal layers, prevents easy incorporation of conventional composite stamps into preexisting commercial printer configurations, such as rolled and flexographic printer configurations. Finally, use of composite stamps having transfer surfaces comprising high modulus elastomeric materials impede formation<br>
of conformal contact between a transfer surface and a substrate surface necessary for high fidelity patterning,<br>
It will be appreciated from the foregoing that there is currently a need in the art for methods and devices for fabricating high resolution patterns of structures having features on the scale of 10s to 100s of nanometers. Specifically, soft lithography methods and patterning devices are needed which are capable of fabricating patterns of nanoscale structures having high fidelity, good mechanical robustness and good placement accuracy. In addition, patterning devices are needed that minimize pattern distortions, for example by reducing relief pattern shrinkage during thermal or ultraviolet curing and/or minimizing temperature induced distortions as compared to conventional patterning devices. Finally, soft lithography methods and devices are needed that are compatible with and can be easily integrated into preexisting high speed commercial printing and molding systems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides methods, devices and device components for fabricating patterns on substrate surfaces, particularly patterns comprising structures having microsized and/or nanosized features of selected lengths in one, two or three dimensions. Specifically, the present invention provides stamps, molds and photomasks used in soft lithography fabrication methods for generating high resolution patterns of structures on flat and contoured surfaces, including surfaces having a large radius of curvature on a wide variety of substrates, including flexible plastic substrates. It is an object of the present invention to provide methods and devices for fabricating three-dimensional structures having well defined physical dimensions, particularly structures comprising well defined features having physical dimensions on the order of 10s of nanometers to 1000s of nanometers. It is another object of the present invention to provide methods, devices and device components for fabricating patterns of structures characterized by high fidelity over large substrate surface areas and good placement accuracy. It is further an object of the present invention to provide composite patterning devices which exhibit better thermal stability and resistance to curing induced pattern distortion than conventional single layer or multilayer stamps, molds and photomasks. It is another<br>
object of the present invention to provide soft lithography methods, devices and device components that are compatible with existing high speed commercial printing, molding and embossing techniques, devices and systems.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides patterning devices comprising a plurality of polyrner layers each having selected mechanical properties, such as Young's Modulus and flexural rigidity, selected physical dimensions, such as thickness, surface area and relief pattern dimensions, and selected thermal properties, such as coefficients of thermal expansion, to provide high resolution patterning on a variety of substrate surfaces and surface morphologies. Patterning devices of this aspect of the present invention include multilayer polymer stamps, molds and photomasks useful for a variety of soft lithographic patterning applications including contact printing, molding and optical patterning, in one embodiment, discrete polymer layers having different mechanical properties, physical dimensions and thermal properties are combined and/or matched to provide patterning devices having cumulative mechanical and thermal properties providing enhanced pattern resolution and fidelity, and improved thermal stability over conventional soft lithography devices. In addition, patterning devices of the present invention comprising a combination of discrete polymer layers tolerate a wide variety of device configurations, positions and orientations without fracture which make them more easily integrated into existing commercial printing, molding and optical patterning systems than conventional single layer or multiple layer stamps, molds and photomasks.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a composite patterning comprising a first polymer layer having a low Young's modulus and a second polymer layer having a high Young's modulus. The first polymer layer comprises, a selected three-dimensional relief pattern having' at least one contact surface disposed thereon and has an internal surface opposite the contact surface. The second polymer layer has ,an external surface and an internal surface. First and second polymer layers are "arranged such that a force applied to the external surface of the second polymer layer is transmitted to the first polymer layer. For example, first and second polymer layers may be arranged such that a force applied to the externa! surface of the second layer is transmitted to at least a portion<br>
of the contact surface(s) of the first polymer layer. In an embodiment, the interna! surface of the first polymer layer is operationally coupled to the internal surface.of the second polymer layer. For example, the internal surface of the first polymer layer may be in physical contact with the internal surface of the second polymer layer. Alternatively, the first polymer layer and the second polymer layer may be connected by one or more connecting layers, such .as thin metal layers, polymer layers or ceramic layers, positioned between the internal surface of the first polymer layer and the interna! surface of the second polymer layer.<br>
Composite patterning devices of this aspect of the present invention are capable of establishing conformal contact between at least a portion of the contact -surface(s) of the first polymer layer and the substrate surface undergoing patterning. Optionally, the second polymer layer may be operationally coupled to an actuator, such as a stamping, printing or molding device, capable of providing an external force to the external side of the second polymer layer so as to bring the patterning device into conformai contact with the substrate surface undergoing patterning. Optionally, the substrate may be operationally coupled to an actuator, capable of bringing the substrate into conformal contact with the patterning device.<br>
Selection of the physical dimensions and Young's modulus of polymer layers in composite patterning devices of the present invention establishes the overall mechanical properties of the composite patterning device, such as the net flexural rigidity and conformabitity of the patterning device. In an embodiment of the present invention useful for soft lithographic contact printing and molding applications the first polymer layer is characterized by a Young's modulus selected over the range of about 1 MPa to about 10 MPa and a thickness selected over the range of about 1 micron to about 100 microns, and the second polymer layer is characterized by a Young's modulus selected over the range of about 1 GPa to about 10 GPa and a thickness selected over the range of about 10 microns to about 100 microns. Composite patterning devices of the present useful for soft lithographic.contact printing applications also include embodiments wherein the ratio of the thickness of the first polymer layer and the thickness of the second polymer layer is selected from the range of about 1 to about 10, preferably equal to about 5 for some  applications,     in one embodiment, the first polymer is an<br>
elastomeric layer, such as a PDMS or h-PDMS layer, the second polymer layer is a thermoplastic or thermoset layer, such as a polyimide layer, and the composite patterning device has a net flexural rigidity selected from the range of about 1 x 10"7 Nm to about 1 x10-5 Nm.<br>
Use of a low modulus first polymer layer, such as an elastomer layer, is beneficial in the present invention because it provides patterning devices having the capability to establish conformal contact with large areas (up to several m2) of smooth surfaces, flat surfaces, rough surfaces, particularly surfaces having roughness amplitudes up to about 1 micron, and contoured surfaces, preferably surfaces having radii of curvature up to about 25 microns. In addition, use of a low modulus first polymer layer allows conformal contact to be established between the contact surface(s) and large areas of substrate surface using relative low pressures (about 0.1 kN m-2to about 10 kN m-2) applied to the external surface of the second polymer layer. For example, a low modulus first polymer layer comprising a PDMS layer having a thickness greater than or equal to about 5 microns establishes reproducible conformal contact over substrate surface areas as large as 250 cm2 upon application of external pressures less than or equal to about 100 N m"2. in addition, incorporation of a low modulus first polymer layer into patterning devices of the present invention allows conformal contact to be established in a gradual and controlled manner, thus, avoiding the formation of trapped air pockets between the contact surface of the first layer and a substrate surface. Further, incorporation of a low modulus first polymer layer provides good release characteristics of contact surfaces from substrate surfaces and the surfaces of master relief patterns used to make composite patterning devices of the present invention.<br>
Use of a high modulus second polymer layer in patterning devices of the present invention is beneficial because it provides patterning devices having a net flexural rigidity large enough to minimize distortions of the relief pattern which may occur upon formation of conformal contact between the contact surface(s) and a substrate surface. First, incorporation of a high modulus second polymer layer into patterning devices of the present invention minimizes distortions of the relief pattern in planes parallel to a plane containing the contact surface, such as distortions characterized by the collapse of narrow relief features of patterns having high<br>
aspect ratios. Second, incorporation of a high modulus second polymer layer minimizes distortions of the relief pattern in planes which Intersect a plane containing the contact surface, such as distortions characterized by sagging of recessed regions of a relief pattern. This reduction in relief pattern distortion provided by incorporation of a high modulus second polymer layer allows patterns of small structures comprising well defined features having physical dimensions as small as 50 nanometers to be fabricated using patterning devices and methods of the present invention.<br>
Use of a high modulus second polymer layer in patterning devices of the present invention is also beneficial because it allows for easy handling and incorporation of patterning devices of the present invention into printing, embossing and molding machines. This attribute of the present invention facilitates mounting, remounting, orienting, maintaining and cleaning of the present patterning devices. Incorporation of a high modulus second polymer layer also improves the accuracy in which patterning devices of the present invention may be brought into contact with a selected region of a substrate surface by a factor of 25 with respect to conventional single layer PDMS stamps, molds and photomasks. For example, incorporation of a 25 micron thick second polymer layer having a Young's modulus equal to or greater than 5 GPa, such as a poiyimide layer, allows patterning devices of the present invention to be brought into contact with a substrate surface with a placement accuracy equal to about 1 micron over a substrate area equal to about 232 cm2. Further, use of a flexible and resilient, high modulus second polymer layer allows patterning devices of the present invention to be operated in a range of device configurations and easily integrated into conventional printing and molding systems. For example, use of a second polymer layer having a flexural rigidity of about 7 x 10-6 Nm allows integration of pattering devices of the present invention into conventional roller and fiexographic printing systems.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, a patterning device of the present invention comprises a unitary polymer layer. The unitary polymer layer comprises a three-dimensional relief pattern having at least one contact surface disposed thereon and a base having an externa! surface positioned opposite to the contact surface. The contact surface is oriented orthogonal to a layer alignment axis extending through<br>
the polymer layer, and the Young's modulus of the polymer layer varies continuously along the layer alignment axis from the contact surface to the external surface of the base. In one embodiment, the Young's modulus of the polymer layer varies continuously along the layer alignment axis from a low value at the contact surface to a high value at the mid point between the contact surface and the external surface along the layer alignment axis. In another embodiment the Young's modulus of the polymer layer varies continuously from a high modulus value at the mid point between the contact surface and the external surface along the layer alignment axis to a low modulus value at the external surface of the base. Optionally, the polymer layer may also have a substantially symmetrical distribution of the coefficients of thermal expansion about the center of the patterning device along the layer alignment axis. Variation of the Young's modulus in the polymer layer may be achieved by any means known in the art including methods wherein,, the extent of cross Sinking in the unitary polymer layer is selectively yariod to achieve control of the Young's modulus as a function of position along the layer alignment axis.<br>
Three-dimensional relief patterns useable in the present invention may comprise a singular continuous relief feature or a plurality of continuous and/or discrete relief features. In the present invention, selection of the physical dimensions of relief features or their arrangement in a relief pattern is made on the basis of the physical dimensions and relative arrangements of the structures to be generated on a substrate surface. Relief patterns useable in composite patterning devices of the present invention may comprise relief features having physical dimensions selected over the range of about 10 nanometers to about 10,000 nanometers, preferably selected over the range of about 50 nanometers to about 1000 nanometers for some applications. Relief patterns useable in the present invention may comprise symmetrical patterns of relief features or asymmetrical patterns of relief features. Three-dimensional relief patterns may occupy a wide range of areas, and relief areas selected over the range of about 10 cm2 to about 260 cm2 are preferred for some micro- and nanofabrication applications.<br>
In another embodiment,  a composite patterning device of the present invention further comprises a third polymer layer having an internal surface and an<br>
external surface, in this three layer embodiment, the first, second and third polymer layers are arranged such that a force applied to the external surface of the third polymer layer is transmitted to the first polymer layer. For example, first, second and third polymer layers may be arranged such that a force applied to the external surface of the third layer is transmitted to at least a portion of the contact surface(s) of the first polymer layer. In an embodiment, the external surface of the second polymer layer is operationally coupled to the internal surface of the third polymer layer. For example, the external surface of the second polymer layer may be in physical contact with the internal surface of the tnird polymer layer. Alternatively, the second polymer layer and the third polymer layer may be connected by one or more connecting layers, such as thin metal layers, polymer layers or ceramic layers, positioned between the external surface of the second polymer layer and the internal surface of the third polymer layer. Optionally, the third polymer layer may be operationally coupled to an actuator capable of providing an external force to the external side of the third polymer layer so as to bring the contact surface(s) of the patterning device into conformal contact with the substrate surface undergoing patterning. Incorporation of a third polymer layer may also provide a means of handing, positioning, orienting, mounting, cleaning and maintaining composite patterning devices of the present invention.<br>
Incorporation of a third polymer layer having a low young's modulus into composite patterning devices of the present invention is beneficial for some soft lithography applications. First, use of a low Young's modulus third polymer layer allows the force applied to the patterning device to be applied in a gradual and controlled manner, facilitating generation of conformal without formation of trapped air bubbles, Second, integration of a iow Young's modulus third polymer layer provides an effective means of uniformly distributing a force applied to the patterning device to the contact surface(s) of the first polymer layer. Uniform distribution of the force applied to the patterning device to the contact surface(s) promotes formation of conformal contact over large areas of the substrate surface and enhances the fidelity of patterns generated on a substrate surface. In addition, uniform distribution of the force applied to the patterning device to the contact surface(s) improves the overall efficiency and energy consumption of the patterning<br>
process.  An exemplary third polymer layer has a thickness which is several times thicker than the roughness and/or radius of curvature of the substrate surface.<br>
in another aspect, the present invention provides thermally stable composite patterning devices that undergo less thermal induced pattern distortion than conventional single layer and multiple layer stamps, molds and photomasks. Some materials having a low Young's modulus are also characterized by a large coefficient of thermal expansion. For example, PDMS has a Young's modulus of 3 MPa and a coefficient of thermal expansion equal to about 260 ppm. Increases or decreases of temperature, therefore, can result in substantial distortions in relief patterns comprising these materials, particularly for patterning devices having large area relief patterns. Relief pattern distortions caused by changes in temperature may be especially problematic for applications involving fabrication of patterns of structures having features with very small dimensions, such as submicron sized structures, over large areas of substrate<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, a plurality of layers having different mechanical properties and/or thermal expansion coefficients are combined and matched in a manner providing patterning devices exhibiting high thermal stability. In another aspect of the present invention, a plurality of layers are combined such that the net thermal expansion properties of the patterning device is matched to the thermal expansion properties of the substrate, preferably matched to with 10% for some applications. In the context of the present description, "high thermal stability" refers to patterning devices exhibiting minimal pattern distortions upon changes in temperature. Composite pattering devices of the present invention having high thermal stability exhibit reduced deformation of relief patterns and contact surfaces caused by stretching, bowing, buckling, expansion and compression Induced by changes in temperature, as compared to conventional single layer and multilayer stamps, molds and photomasks. In one embodiment, a high modulus second polymer layer having a low coefficient of thermal expansion, such as a polyimide layer, is operationally coupled to the internal surface of a low modulus first polymer layer having a large coefficient of thermal expansion, such as a PDMS layer or a h-PDMS layer. In this arrangement, integration of a second polymer layer having a high modulus and low coefficient of thermal expansion constrains expansion or<br>
contraction of the first polymer layer and, therefore, significantly decreases the extent of stretching or compression of the contact surface(s) and three-dimensional relief pattern induced by increases or decreases in temperature. in one embodiment of this aspect of the present invention, the second polymer layer has a coefficient of thermal expansion less than or equal to about 14.5 ppm and, optionally a thickness that is about five times larger than the thickness of the first layer.<br>
In the present invention, good thermal stability may also be achieved by incorporation of a discontinuous low modulus first layer operationally coupled to a high modulus second layer, preferably a high modulus layer having a low thermal expansion coefficient. In one embodiment, the discontinuous low modulus layer is a three dimensional relief pattern comprising a plurality of discrete relief features. Discrete relief features comprising the low modulus layer are not in contact with each other but are each operationally coupled to the high modulus layer. For example, the pattern of discrete relief features may comprise a pattern of individual islands of low modulus material on the internal surface of the high modulus layer. Incorporation of a first low modulus layer comprising a plurality of discrete relief features into composite patterning devices of the present invention is beneficial because it decreases the extent of the mismatch between thermal expansion properties of the low modulus and high modulus layers, in addition, use of a discontinuous low modulus layer decreases the net amount of material having a high coefficient of thermal expansion, which decreases the net extent of expansion or contraction induced by a change in temperature. In an exemplary embodiment, the discontinuous low modulus layer comprises an elastomer, such as PDMS or h-PDMS, and the high modulus layer comprises polyirnide.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention providing patterning devices having good thermal stability, a plurality of iayers are arranged so as to provide a substantially symmetrical distribution of coefficients of thermal expansion, thicknesses or both about the center of the patterning device along a layer alignment axis extending through the patterning device, for example a layer alignment axis positioned orthogonal to the contact surface. In an alternative embodiment also exhibiting good thermal stability, a temperature compensated<br>
patterning device of the present invention comprises a unitary polymer layer having a substantially symmetrical distribution of coefficients of thermal expansion about the center of the patterning device along a layer alignment axis extending through the patterning device, for example positioned orthogonal to the contact surface.<br>
The symmetrical distribution of coefficients of thermal expansion, thicknesses or both in these configurations provides a means of compensating for the thermal expansion or compression of one or more layers. The result of this compensation schemeis to minimize buckling, bowing, elongation and compression of the relief pattern induced by changes in temperature. Particularly, a symmetrical distribution of coefficients of thermal expansion and layer thicknesses generates opposing forces having approximately the same magnitude but opposite directions upon a change in temperature. Accordingly, this temperature compensation scheme is used to minimize the magnitude of forces generated upon a change in temperature which act on the contact surface, relief features and three-dimensional relief pattern of the first layer.<br>
An exemplary temperature compensated patterning device of the present invention comprises three layers having mechanical and physical properties selected to provide a substantially symmetrical distribution of thermal expansion coefficients about the center of the device. The first layer comprises a three-dimensional relief pattern having at least one contact surface disposed thereon and an internal surface positioned opposite the contact surface. The first layer also has a low Young's modulus, for example ranging from about 1 MPa to about 10 MPa. The second layer has an internal surface and an external surface, and a high Young's modulus, for example ranging from about 1 GPa to about 10 GPa. The third layer has an internal surface and an external surface. In this three layer embodiment, the first, second and third layers are arranged such that a force applied to the external surface of the third layer is transmitted to the contact surface of the first layer. The thicknesses and thermal expansion coefficients of the first and third layers may be selected to provide a substantially symmetrical distribution of the coefficients of thermal expansion about the center of the patterning device along a layer alignment axis extending through said patterning device, such as a<br>
layer alignment axis positioned orthogonal to a plane encompassing at least one contact surface.<br>
An exemplary three layer composite patterning device exhibiting high thermal stability comprises a PDMS first layer, a polyimide second layer and a PDMS third layer. In this embodiment, the thickness of first and third PDMS layers may be substantially equal, for example within 10% of each other, to provide a substantially symmetrical distribution of coefficients of thermal expansion about the center of the device along a layer alignment axis extending orthogonal to the contact surface. In this embodiment, pattern distortions across a 1 cm2 relief pattern less than 150 nanometers for a change in temperature of 1 K are observed for three layer patterning devices of the present invention having first and third PDMS layers comprising the same material, having thicknesses equal to about 5 microns and separated by an approximately 25 micron thick poiyimide layer. In an embodiment of the present invention having matched first and third layers providing a substantially symmetrical distribution of coefficients of thermal expansion, the ratio of the relief depth to the thickness of the first layer is kept small (e.g. less than or equal to 0.10) to avoid unwanted temperature induced thermal expansion or contraction corresponding to thermal coefficient mismatching in recessed regions of the relief pattern.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides composite patterning devices that undergo less pattern distortion caused by polymerization and curing during fabrication than conventional single layer and multiple layer stamps, photomasks and molds. Many polymers, such as PDMS, undergo a significant decrease in their physical dimensions upon polymerization. As relief patterns used in pattering devices are typically fabricated by initiating polymerization of a prepolymer in contact with a master relief surface, such as a master relief surface generated by conventional photolithography methods, this shrinkage may significantly distort the physical dimensions of relief patterns and contact surfaces of pattering devices comprising polymeric materials, particularly elastomers.<br>
The present invention  provides multilayer stamp designs that are  less susceptible to deformations caused by polymerization and curing during fabrication.<br>
Composite pattering devices of the present invention having decreased susceptibility to curing induced deformations of relief patterns and contact surfaces exhibit less stretching, bowing, buckling, expansion and compression induced by polymerization reactions during fabrication, as compared to conventional single layer and multilayer stamps, molds and photomasks. In one embodiment, a plurality of polymer layers having specific mechanical and thermal expansion characteristics are combined and/or matched in a manner decreasing the net extent of pattern distortion generated upon polymerization and curing during fabrication.<br>
[0035] A composite patterning device of the present invention having decreased sensitivity to curing induced deformations of relief patterns and contact surfaces further comprises third and fourth polymer layers, each have internal surfaces and external surfaces. In this four layer embodiment, the first, second, third and fourth polymer layers are arranged such that a force applied to the external surface of the fourth polymer layer is transmitted to the contact surface of the first polymer layer. For example, first, second, third and fourth polymer layers may be arranged such that a force applied to the external surface of the fourth layer is transmitted to at least a portion of the contact surfaces of the first polymer layer. In an embodiment, the external surface of the second polymer layer is operationally coupled to the internal surface of the third polymer layer and the external surface of the third polymer layer is operationally coupled to the internal surface of the fourth polymer layer. Improved resistance to curing and/or polymerization induced distortion may be provided by matching the thicknesses, coefficients of thermal expansion and Young's modulus of the first and third layers and by matching the thicknesses, coefficients of thermal expansion and Young's modulus of the second and fourth layers. The net resuft of this matched multilayer design is to decrease the extent of curing induced distortions by a factor of about 10 relative to conventional single layer or double layer stamps, molds and photomasks.<br>
Composite patterning devices of the present invention may be fully optically transmissive or partially optically transmissive, particularly with respect to electromagnetic radiation having wavelengths in the ultraviolet and/or visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Patterning devices which transmit visible light are preferred for some applications because they can be visually aligned with a<br>
substrate surface. Patterning devices of the present invention may transmit one or more patterns of electromagnetic radiation onto the substrate surface characterized by selected two dimensional distributions of intensities, wavelengths, polarization states or any combination of these. The intensities and wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation transmitted by patterning devices of the present invention may be controlled by introduction of materials into the polymer Jayers having selected absorption properties, scattering properties and/or reflection properties. In an exemplary embodiment, the patterning device is a partially transparent optical element characterized by a selected two dimensional distribution of absorption coefficients, extinction coefficients, reflectivities or any combination of these parameters. An advantage of this design is that it results in a selected two dimensional distribution of the intensities and wavelengths electromagnetic radiation transmitted to the substrate upon illumination by an optical source, such as a broad band lamp, atomic lamp, blackbody source or iaser.<br>

First polymer layer 110 also has a plurality of contact surfaces 130 positioned opposite to an internal surface135,- The present invention includes embodiments wherein contact surfaces 130 occupy a common plane and embodiments wherein contact surfaces 130 occupy more than one plane. Second polymer layer 120 has an internal surface 140 and an external surface 150. In the embodiment shown in Figure 1A, the internal surface 135 of first polymer layer 110 is positioned in contact with internal surface 140 of second polymer layer 120. Optionally, second polymer layer 120 is operationally connected to actuator 155 which is capable of directing a force (schematically shown as arrows 156) onto external surface 150.<br>
First polymer layer 110 and second polymer layer 120 may be coupled in any manner allowing a force exerted on external surface 150 to be transmitted effectively to contact surfaces 130. In exemplary embodiments, first polymer layer 110 and second polymer layer 120 are coupled via covalent bonding between the polymers comprising each layer. Alternatively, first polymer layer 110 and second polymer layer 120 may be coupled by attractive intermolecular forces between each layer, such as Van der Waals forces, dipole-dipole forces, hydrogen bonding and London forces. Alternatively, first polymer layer 110 and second polymer layer 120 may be coupled by an external layer alignment system, such as clamping, fastening and/or bolting systems. Alternatively, first polymer layer 110 and second polymer layer 120 may be coupled using one or more connecting layers (not shown in Fig. 1A), such as thin metal layers, positioned between internal surface 135 and internal surface 140. Coupling of first polymer layer 1.10 and second polymer layer 120 via strong covalent bonding and/or attractive intermolecular forces is preferred for some applications because is provides good mechanical rigidity to relief features 133 and<br>
recessed areas 134, and also provides an effective means of evenly distributing forces applied to external surface 150 to contact surfaces 130.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 1A, the composition, Young's modului and/or thicknesses along a layer alignment axis 160 positioned orthogonal to a plane including contact surfaces 130 of first polymer layer 110 are selected to provide mechanical properties of patterning device 100 that allow fabrication of high resolution patterns of microsized and/or nanosized structures which exhibit reduced pattern distortions. In addition, the Young's modului and/or thicknesses of first polymer layer 110 and second polymer layer 120 may also be selected to provide easy integration of the patterning device 100 into commercial printing and molding systems. In an exemplary embodiment, first polymer layer 110 comprises a PDMS layer having a thickness along the layer alignment axis 160 selected from the range of about 5 microns to about 10 microns. The thickness of first polymer layer 110 may alternatively be defined in terms of the shortest distance between contact surfaces 130 and internal surface 140 of second polymer layer 120. In an exemplary embodiment, second polymer layer 120 comprises a polyimide layer having a thickness along the layer alignment axis equal to about 25 microns. The thickness of second polymer layer 120 may alternatively be defined in terms of the shortest distance between the internal surface 140 and external surface 150 of second polymer layer 120.<br>
To fabricate patterns comprising one or more structures, the composite patterning device 100 and surface 185 of substrate 180 are brought into contact with each other, preferably contact establishing conformai contact between at least a portion of contact surfaces 130 and substrate surface 185. Conformai contact between these surfaces may be achieved by application of an external force (schematically represented by arrows 156) onto externa! surface 150 in a manner moving patterning device 100 into contact with substrate 180. Alternatively, an external force (schematically represented by arrows 190) may be applied to substrate 180 in a manner moving substrate 180 into contact with the patterning device 100, The present Invention also includes embodiments wherein conformai contact is established by a combination of these forces (156 and 190) and motions of substrate 180 and patterning device 100.<br>
Figure 1B is. a schematic showing a cross sectional view of another composite patterning device of the present invention exhibiting high thermal stability comprising two polymer layers. As shown in Fig. 1B, the composite patterning device 200 comprises a discontinuous first polymer layer 210 having a low Young's modulus operationally connected to second polymer layer 120 having a high Young's modulus. In this embodiment, discontinuous first polymer layer 210 comprises a three dimensional relief pattern 225 comprising a plurality of discrete relief features 233 separated by a plurality of recessed regions 234. As shown in Figure 1B, discrete relief features 233 do not contact each other but are each operationaily coupled to the second polymer layer 120.. Incorporation of a first polymer layer comprising a plurality of discrete reiief features into composite patterning devices of the present invention is beneficial because it decreases the extent of the mismatch between thermal expansion properties of the first and second polymer layers 210 and 120, and also decreases the net amount of material in the first polymer layer 210, which may comprise a material having a high coefficient of thermal expansion, such as PDMS<br>
Figure 1C is a schematic showing a cross sectional view of another composite patterning device of the present invention exhibiting high thermal stability comprising three polymer layers. The illustrated composite patterning device 300 further comprises third polymer layer 310 having an internal surface 315 and an external surface 320. in the embodiment illustrated in Figure 1C, the internal surface 315 of third polymer layer 310 is in contact with the external surface 150 of second polymer layer 120. Optionally, third poiymer layer 310 is operationally coupled to actuator 155 which is capable of directing a force (schematically shown as arrows 156) onto external surface 320.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 1C, the thickness 330 of third polymer layer 310 along layer alignment axis 160 is approximately equal to the thickness 340 of first polymer layer 110 along layer alignment axis 160, preferably within 10% for some applications. In this embodiment, selection of third poiymer layer 310 and first poiymer layer 110 having the same or similar (e.g. within 10%) coefficients of thermal expansion, such as both layers comprising PDMS layers, provides for high<br>
thermal stability and resistance to pattern distortions induced by changes in temperature. Particularly, this arrangement provides a substantially symmetrical distribution of the coefficients of thermal expansion about the center (indicated by center line axis 350) of patterning device 300 along layer alignment axis 160. A symmetrical distribution of the coefficients of thermal expansion provides for generation of opposing forces upon a change in temperature which minimizes the extent of stretching, bowing, buckling, expansion and compression of relief pattern 125, relief features 133 and contact surfaces 130.<br>
Figure 1D is a schematic showing a cross sectional view of a four layer composite patterning device of the present invention exhibiting good resistance to pattern deformations caused by polymerization and/or curing during fabrication. The illustrated composite patterning device 400 further comprises fourth polymer layer 410 having an internal surface 415 and an external surface 420. In the embodiment, illustrated in Figure 1D, the internal surface 415 of fourth polymer layer 410 is in contact with the external surface 320 of third polymer layer 310. Optionally, fourth polymer layer 410 is operationally connected to actuator 155 which is capable of directing a force (schematically shown as arrows 156) onto externa! surface 420.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 1D, the thickness 330 of third polymer layer 310 along layer alignment axis 160 is approximately equal to the thickness 340 of first polymer layer 110 along layer alignment axis 160, preferably within 10% for some applications, and the thickness 430 of fourth polymer layer 410 along layer alignment axis 160 is approximately equal to the thickness 440 of second polymer layer 120 along layer alignment axis 160, preferably within 10% for some applications. In this embodiment, selection of third polymer layer 310 and first polymer layer 110 having the same coefficients of thermal expansion and Young's modulus, such as both layers comprising PDMS layers, and selection of fourth polymer layer 410 and second polymer layer 120 having the same coefficients of thermal expansion and Young's modulus, such as both layers comprising polyimide layers, provides for good resistance to pattern distortions caused by polymerization and/or curing during fabrication. Particularly, this arrangement minimizes the extent<br>
of stretching, bowing, buckling, expansion and compression of relief pattern 125 and contact surfaces 130 during polymerization and/or curing.<br>
Surfaces of polymer layers including first, second third and fourth layers in the present invention may possess specific relief patterns, such as alignment channels and/or grooves, useful for providing proper alignment between layers. Alternatively, surfaces of polymer layers in the present invention may possess specific relief patterns, such as alignment channels and/or grooves, useful for providing proper alignment between a composite patterning device and an actuator such as a printing device, molding device or contact photolithography apparatus having complimentary (i.e. mating) channels and/or grooves. Alternatively, surfaces of polymer layers in the present invention may possess specific relief patterns, such as alignment channels and/or grooves, useful for providing proper alignment between a composite patterning device and substrate surface having complimentary (i.e. mating) channels and/or grooves. As will be understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, use of such "lock and key" alignment mechanisms, channels, grooves and systems are well known in the art of microfabrication, and may easily be integrated into the patterning devices of the present invention.<br>
Selection of the composition, physical dimensions and mechanical properties of polymer layers in composite patterning devices of the present invention depends largely on the material transfer method to be employed (e.g. printing, molding etc.) and the physical dimensions of the structures/patterns to be fabricated. In this sense, the composite patterning device specifications of the present invention may be regarded as selectably adjustable for a particular functional task or pattern/structure dimensions to be accomplished. For example, a two layer patterning device of the present invention useful for printing nanosized structures via soft lithographic methods may comprise an elastomeric first polymer layer having a thickness selected from the range of about 1 micron to about 5 microns, and a second polymer layer comprising a polyimide layer having a thickness less than or equal to about 25 microns. In contrast, a two layer patterning device of the present invention useful for micro-molding structures having dimensions ranging from about 10 microns to about 50 microns may comprise an elastomeric first polymer layer having a thickness selected from the range of about<br>
20 microns to about 60 microns, and a second polymer layer comprising a polyimide layer having a thickness selected over the range of about 25 microns to about 100 microns.<br>
Composite patterning devices of the present invention, such as stamps, molds and photomasks, may be made by any means known in the art of material science, soft lithography and photolithography. An exemplary patterning device of the present invention is prepared by fabricating a first polymer layer comprising an elastomer by casting and curing poiydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) prepolymer (Dow Coming Sylgard 184) against a master relief pattern consisting of patterned features of photoresist (Shipiey 1805) prepared by conventional photolithographic means. Master relief patterns useful in the present invention may be fabricated using conventional contact mode photolithography for features larger than about 2 microns or using electron beam lithography for features smaller than about 2 microns. In an exemplary method, PDMS (Sylgard 184 from Dow Corning) or h-PDMS (VDT-731, Gelest Corp) are mixed and degassed, poured over the masters and cured in an oven at about 80 degrees Celsius. Alternatively, curing of 184 PDMS may be performed at room temperature using extra amounts of curing agent. First polymer layers comprising PDMS or h-PDMS are preferably cured in the presence of the second high modulus layer, such as a polyimide layer, to reduce shrinkage induced by curing and/or polymerization. In one embodiment, the internal surface of the polyimide layer is roughened prior to being brought into contact with the PDMS prepolymer to enhance the strength of the binding of the PDMS first layer to the polyimide second layer upon curing of the PDMS prepolymer. Surface roughening of the polyimide layer may be achieved by any means known in the art including exposing the internal surface of the polyimide layer to a plasma.<br>
Fabrication and curing of the additional layers in composite patterning devices, for example high modulus second polymer layers, is preferably done simultaneously with preparation of the elastomeric first layer to minimize the extent of curing and/or polymerization induced shrinkage of the relief pattern and contact surfaces of the elastomeric first layer.    Alternatively, a  high  modulus second<br>
polymer layer, for example polyimide layer, may be attached to the first polymer layer using an adhesive or connecting layer, such as a thin metal layer.<br>
An exemplary master relief pattern was fabricated using a positive photoresist (S1818, Shipley,) and lift off resist (LOR1A; micron Chem.). In this exemplary method, test grade approximately 450 micron thick silicon wafers (Montco Silicon Technologies) were cleaned with acetone, iso-propanol and deionized water and then dried on a hotplate at 150 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes. LOR 1A resin was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds and then pre-baked oh a hot plate at 130 degrees C for five minutes. Next, the S1818 resin was spin coated at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds and backed on a hot plate for 110 degrees Celsius for five minutes. The resulting bilayer (approximately 1.7 microns thick) was exposed (□ = 365 nm, 16.5 mW/cm2) for 7 seconds with an optical contact aligner (Suss Microtech MJB3) using a chromium ion glass mask, and then developed (MF-319; Shipley) for 75 seconds. The development removed all the S1818 resist that was photoexposed. It also removed, in a roughly isotropic manner, the LOR 1A in both the exposed and unexposed regions. The result of this process is a pattern of S1818 on LOR 1A with regions of bare substrate in the exposed areas and slight undercuts at the edges of the patterns. Composite patterning devices comprising stamps were prepared from this master relief pattern using standard soft lithographic procedures of casting and curing PDMS against the master relief pattern. Figure 2A is a schematic showing an exemplary master relief pattern 461 and an exemplary patterning device 463 fabricated from this master relief pattern. Figure 2B shows a scanning electron microscopy image of the relief structure of an exemplary patterning device comprising a composite stamp made using the methods of the present invention.<br>
Figure 3A is a schematic diagram illustrating a method for making a composite patterning device of the present invention. As shown in processing step A of Figure 3A, the patterning device may be prepared by spin coating a prepolymer of PDMS on a master relief pattern comprising resin relief features on silicon. Optionally, the master relief pattern may be treated with a self assembled monolayer of material to minimize adhesion of the PDMS first layer to the master. As shown in processing step B of Figure 3A, the PDMS first layer may be fabricated<br>
by curing for a few hours using a hot plate and a curing temperature between about 60 and about 80 degrees Celsius. After curing, a thin film of titanium, gold or a combination of both may be deposed on the internal surface of the PDMS first layer via electron beam evaporation methods, as shown in processing step C of Figure 3A. A thin film of titanium, gold or mixture of both may also be deposed on the internal surface of the high modulus second polymer layer (see step C of Figure 3A). First and second layers are operationally coupled via coid welding the coated internal surfaces of the first and second layers, and the composite patterning device may be separated from the master relief pattern, as shown in processing step D and E of Figure 3A, respectively.<br>
Figure 3B shows an alternative method of fabricating a composite multilayer patterning device of the present invention. As shown In processing step A of Figure 3B, the internal surface of a high modulus second layer is coated with titanium, silicon oxide or a combination of both. The coated interna! side of the high modulus second layer is brought into contact with a master relief spin coated with a PDMS prepolymer and pressure is applied to the external surface of the high modulus second layer, as shown in processing step B of Figure 3B. This configuration allows the thickness of the layer of PDMS prepolymer to be selectably adjusted by spinning the master relief pattern and/or applying pressure to the external surface of the high modulus second layer with a flat or rocker based press. Upon achieving a desired thickness, the PDMS prepolymer is cured for a few hours in an oven using curing temperature ranging from about 60 to 80 degrees Celsius, thereby forming the PDMS first layer, as shown in processing step C of Figure 3B. Finally, the composite patterning device is separated from the master relief pattern. Optionally, this method includes the step of treating the master relief pattern with a self assembled monolayer of material to minimize adhesion of the PDMS first layer to the master.<br>

Examplel: Composite Stamps for Nanotransfer Printing<br>
The ability of the patterning devices of the present invention to provide composite stamps for nanotransfer printing applications was verified by experimental studies.    Specifically, it is a goal of the present invention to provide<br>
composite stamps capable of patterning large areas of a substrate surface with structures having selected lengths on the order of microns and 10's of nanometers. Further, it is a goal of the present invention to provide composite stamps for contact printing high resolution patterns exhibiting good fidelity and placement accuracy.<br>
To achieve the aforementioned goals, composite stamps were fabricated using the methods of the present invention and used to generate patterns comprising monolayers of gold on substrates via nanotransfer printing (nTP). Specifically, large area composites stamps were generated and tested, comprising a thin (5-10 micron) PDMS layer in contact with a 25 micron thick polyimide (Kapton ®, DuPont) backing layer. In addition, large area composites stamps were generated and tested, comprising additional PDMS and/or polyimide layers. In one embodiment, a second PDMS layer having thickness of about 10 millimeters was attached to the polyimide layer. In another embodiment, a second polyimide layer was provided that was separated from the first polyimide layer by a thin (approximately 4 micron) PDMS layer. Use of additional PDMS and/or polyimide layers facilitated handling of the. composite stamps and avoided curling after separation from the master relief pattern due shrinkage of the PDMS layer and/or mismatch of the coefficients of thermal expansion of the PDMS and polyimide layers.<br>
Figure 4A shows a schematic illustration of an exemplary composite stamp used in this study and Figure 4B shows a corresponding cross section scanning electron microscopy image. As shown in Figure 4B, the relief pattern of the composite stamp is coated with a thin layer of gold. The relief pattern of this composite stamp corresponds to the source/drain level of an active matrix circuit for electronic paper displays consisting of 256 interconnected transistors arranged in a square array of over an area of 16 cm by 16 cm.<br>
Distortions in composite stamps of the present invention were quantified by measuring with a microscope the misalignment at each transistor location between two successive prints, between one print and the stamp and the stamp used to print and between a stamp and its master relief pattern. Figures 5A and 5B show distortions that correspond to measurements of positions of features<br>
on a composite stamp compared to those on its master relief pattern. These results include corrections for overall translation and rotational misalignment and isotropic shrinkage (about 228 ppm for stamps cured at 80 degrees Celsius and about 60 ppm for those cured at room temperature). The residual distortions are close to the estimated accuracy (approximately 1 micron) of the measurement method. These distortions include cumulative effects of (i) fabricating and releasing the stamp from its master relief pattern and (ii) printing (wetting the stamp) on an uneven substrate (the master has some relief features approximately 9 microns thick).<br>
Another benefit of the composite stamp design of this example is its reduced tendency to sag mechanically in the recessed regions of the relief pattern, which can cause unwanted stamp-substrate contact that distorts a pattern transferred to a substrate surface. As an example, in the case of 60 micron wide lines separated by 60 microns (500 nanometer relief height), recessed areas of a regular single element PDMS stamp sag completely. In contrast, no sagging is observed for the same relief geometry on a composite stamp comprising four polymer layers: (1) 25 micron PDMS first layer, (2) 25 micron polyimide second layer, (3) 60 micron PDMS third layer, and (4) 25 micron polyimide fourth layer. Figs. 6A and 6B show top view optical micrographs that illustrate the reduced tendency for sagging of recessed areas in a composite stamp of the present invention. Figure 6A corresponds to a conventional single layer PDMS stamp and Figure 6B corresponds to a composite stamp of the present invention. The color uniformity in the recessed areas of the composite stamp (Figure 6B) suggests that the bowing is almost zero. Finite element modeling of the multilayer structure of the composite stamp indicates that the pofyimide layer efficiently reduces the tendency of the stamp for sagging when the residual PDMS layer is thin.<br>
Figure 7 shows the extent of shrinkage observed after curing a two layer stamp of the present invention comprising a thin PDMS layer in contact with a polyimide layer. As shown in Figure 7, composite stamps of the present invention undergo horizontal shrinkage equal to 0.2% or less and vertical shrinkage of 0.3% or less. The resistance to curing induced shrinkage provided by the composite stamp   designs   of the   present   invention   minimizes   distortions   of the  three-<br>
dimensional  relief pattern and  contact surfaces  and  provides  high  resolution patterns exhibiting good fidelity with respect to the master relief pattern.<br>
Figure 8 is a schematic illustration of a nanotransfer printing processes using a composite stamp of the present invention. As shown in Figure 8, the process begins with deposition of a gold coating on the surface of the composite stamp, thereby forming a discontinuous gold coating on the raised and recessed regions of the eiastomeric first layer. Contacting the stamp to a substrate that supports a self assembled monolayer (SAM) designed to bond to the gold (e.g. a thiol terminated SAM) leads to strong adhesion between the gold and the substrate. Removing the stamp, to which gold only weakly adheres, transfers the gold on the raised regions of the stamp to the substrate.<br>
Metal evaporation was performed with a Temescal electron beam system (BJD 1800) and deposition rates of 1 nm/s were employed. Pressures during evaporation were typically about 1 x 10-6.Tprr or less. A deposition rate monitor was installed in position such that the rates could be established and stabilized before exposing the stamps or substrates to the flux of metal. The printing was performed in open air shortly after deposition. The stamps typically come into intimate contact with the substrates without applied pressure other than the force of gravity. In some cases small pressure applied by hand was used to initiate contact along an edge, which then proceeded naturally across the stamp-substrate interface. After a few seconds, the stamp was removed from contact with substrate to complete the printing.<br>
Figures 9A-D show scanning electron micrographs of patterns of Ti/Au (2 nm / 20 nm) generated using composite stamps of the present invention. As illustrated in these figures, the methods and devices of the present invention are capable of generating a wide variety of patterns comprising structures having a range of physical dimensions. As shown in Figures 9A- D, the transferred Ti/Au patterns are largely free of cracks and other surface defects. Use of composite stamps of the present invention having a thickness less than 100 µm are preferred for some applications because the stress developed at the surface of the composite stamp when  bent (during handling or initiation of contact) is small relative to<br>
conventional PDMS stamps which are often substantially thicker (e.g. approximately 1 cm in thickness).<br>
Example 2:   Computer modeling of the Thermal Characteristics and Mechanical Properties of Composite Patterning Devices<br>
The susceptibility of multilayer patterning devices of the present invention to distortions induced by polymerization during fabrication and mechanical stresses was evaluated by computation simulations. Specifically, the extent of deformation induced by polymerization during fabrication and the weight driven deformation of recessed regions was calculated for a four layer composite patterning device. These studies verified that composite patterning devices of the present invention exhibit enhanced stability with respect to polymerization induced shrinkage and weight driven sagging.<br>
The extent of polymerization induced distortion was calculated and compared for two different composite pattern designs. First, a four layer composite patterning device 600, shown schematically in Figure 10, was evaluated comprising a first 5 micron thick PDMS polymer layer 610, a second 25 micron polyimide (Kapton ®) polymer layer 620, a third 5 micron thick PDMS polymer layer 630 and a fourth 25 micron polyimide (Kapton ®) polymer layer 640. Second, a two layer composite patterning device 700 shown schematically in Figure 11A was evaluated comprising a first 5 micron thick PDMS polymer layer 710, a second 25 micron polyimide (Kapton ®) polymer layer 720. A temperature change from 20 degrees Celsius to 80 degrees Celsius was used in both calculations. The Young's modulus and coefficient of thermal expansion of PDMS were assumed to be independent of temperature and equai to 3 MPa and 260 ppm, respectively. The Young's modulus and coefficient of thermal expansion of poiyimide were assumed to be independent of temperature and equal to 5.34 GPa and 14.5 ppm, respectively.<br>
Figure 10 shows the extent of distortion predicted during thermal induced polymerization calculated for the four layer composite patterning device 600. As shown in Figure 10, no curling of the four layer pattern device is observed<br>
upon polymerization. Figure 11A shows the extent of distortion during thermal induced polymerization calculated for the two layer composite patterning device 700. In contrast to the results for the four layer patterning device, polymerization induced curling is observed for the two layer pattering device. Figures 11B and 11C provide plots of the radius of curvature after polymerization as a function of the thickness of the PDMS layer and the curing temperature, respectively, for the two layer pattering device.<br>
The extent of vertical displacement of recessed regions of a four layer patterning device of the present invention was; also examined via computer simulations. As shown in Figure 12A, the composite patterning device evaluated comprised two h-PDMS layers and two poiyimide layers (Kapton ®). The thickness of the first h-PDMS layer was varied over the range of about 6 microns to about 200 microns. The thickness of the poiyimide second layer was held constant at 25 microns, the thickness of the h-PDMS third layer was held constant at 5 microns, and the thickness of the poiyimide fourth layer was held constant at 25 microns. Figure 12B shows a plot of the predicted vertical displacement in units of microns as a function of position along a recessed region about 90 microns in length. As shown In Figure 12B, distortions due to sagging less than about 0.2 microns is observed are observed for PDMS first layers having thicknesses equal to or less than 50 microns. In addition the extent of sagging observed for all embodiments examined was always less than about 0.1% of each the thickness evaluated. The results of these simulations suggest that four layer composite patterning devices of the present invention are unlikely to exhibit undesirable contact between recessed regions of the first layer and the substrate surface due to sagging of recessed regions of a relief pattern.<br>
Figs. 13A-C shows the results of a computational study of horizontal distortion due to thermal/chemical shrinkage during polymerization for a two layer composite stamp of the present invention. Figure 13A is a schematic illustrating a two layer composite stamp comprising a PDMS layer of variable thickness operationally coupled to a 25 micron Kapton layer. Figure 13B is a plot of the predicted horizontal distortion as a function of the thickness of the PDMS first layer<br>
in microns. Figure 13C is a plot of the predicted horizontal distortion as a function of the distance along the external surface of the PDMS first layer in millimeters. The modeling results suggest that the magnitude of distortions in planes parallel to the contact surfaces on the external surface of the PDMS first layer due to polymerization is directly proportional to the PDMS first layer thickness. In addition, the modeling results show that distortions in planes parallel to the contact surfaces on the external surface of the PDMS first layer due to polymerization are largely confined to the edges of the stamp when the thickness of the PDMS first layer is decreased.<br>
Example 3: Fiber Reinforced Composite Patterning Devices The present invention includes composite pattering devices comprising one or more composite polymer layers, including polymer layers having fiber materials providing beneficial mechanical, structural and/or thermal properties. Composite patterning devices of this aspect of the present invention include designs wherein fibers are integrated into and/or between polymer layers in geometries selected to provide a net flexural rigidity that minimizes distortion of the relief features of a relief pattern and which provide patterning devices capable of generating patterns exhibiting good fidelity and placement accuracy on substrate surfaces. Furthermore, composite patterning devices of this aspect of the present invention include designs wherein fibers are integrated into and/or between polymer layers in geometries selected to minimize expansion or contraction of polymer layers due changes in temperature and/or to facilitate physical manipulation of patterning devices of the present invention, for example by adding to the thickness of these devices.<br>
To evaluate verify the utility of integrated fiber materials in composite patterning devices of the present invention, a pattering device comprising a plurality of glass fiber reinforced polymer layers was designed. Figures 14A and 14B provide schematic diagrams illustrating a fiber reinforced composite stamp of the present invention. Figure 14A provides a cross sectional view and Figure 14B provides a perspective view. As shown in Figures 14A and 14B the fiber reinforced composite stamp 900 comprises a first layer 905 comprising PDMS and having a relief pattern<br>
with relief features of selected physical dimensions, a second layer 910 comprising a composite polymer having an array of fine glass fibers  in  a first selected orientation, a third layer 915 comprising a composite polymer having a mesh of larger glass fibers in a second selected orientation, a fourth layer 920 comprising a composite  polymer having  a  mesh  of large  glass fibers   in  a  third  selected orientation and a fifth layer 925 comprising a composite polymer having an array of fine glass fibers in a fourth selected orientation.  First layer 905 has a low Young's modulus and is capable of establishing conformal contact between its contact surface(s) and a range of surfaces including contoured, curved and rough surfaces: Second layer 910 is a composite polymer layer wherein the addition of an array of fine glass fibers in a selected orientation provides mechanical support to the roof of the relief features of first layer 905, thereby minimizing distortion of the relief pattern on first layer 905 upon formation of conformal contact with a substrate surface. Third and fourth layers 915 and 920 provide an overall thickness of the fiber reinforced composite stamp 900 such that it can be easily manipulated, cleaned and/or integrated into a stamping device,  incorporation of glass fibers into second, third, fourth and/or fifth layers 910, 915, 920 and 925 also provide a means of selecting the net flexural rigidity of the fiber reinforced composite stamp and provides a means of selecting the Young's modulus of individual layers in patterning devices of the present invention.    For example, selection of the composition, orientation, size and density of fibers in second, third, fourth and/or fifth layers 910, 915, 920 and 925 may provide a net flexural rigidity useful for generating patterns exhibiting good fidelity and placement accuracy on substrate surfaces.   Second, third, fourth and fifth layers 910, 915, 920 and 925 may comprise fiber reinforced composite layers of a polymer having a low Young's modus or polymer having a high Young's modus. Optionally, fiber reinforced composite stamp 900 may further comprise one or more additional high or low Young's modulus polymer layers, include additional composite polymer layers having fiber materials.<br>
Figure 14C provides a schematic diagram illustrating first 930, second 935, third 940 and fourth 945 selected orientations corresponding to second, third, fourth and fifth layers 910, 915, 920 and 925, respectively, of fiber reinforced composite stamp 900. As shown in Figure 14C, first selected orientation 930 provides an array of longitudinally aligned fine glass fibers in the second layer 910<br>
arranged along axes that are orthogonal to the longitudinally aligned fine glass fibers in the fourth selected orientation 945 of the fifth layer 925. Second and third selected orientations provide fiber meshes wherein two sets of fibers are aligned and interwoven along orthogonal axes. Additionally, fiber meshes corresponding to second and third selected orientations 935 and 940 provide fibers orientations that are orthogonal to each other, as shown in Figure 14C. Use of the fiber mesh orientations shown in Figure 14C minimizes anisotropy in the in plane mechanical properties of polymer layers and patterning devices of the present invention.<br>
Figure 15 provides an optical image of a composite polymer layer bonded to a PDMS layer. As shown in Figure 15, the composite polymer layer 971 comprises a glass fiber mesh and the PDMS layer 972 does not have any integrated fiber materials.<br>
Referring again to Figure 14A, the stamp design shown provides an arrangement of fiber reinforced layers that is symmetrical about design axis 960. Use of a second layer 910 and a fifth layer 925 having substantially the same thermal expansion coefficient and a third layer 915 and a fourth layer 920 having substantially the same thermal expansion coefficient provides a fiber reinforced composite stamp 900 having a substantially symmetrical, distribution of thermal expansion coefficients about layer alignment axis 980. This is particularly true if first layer is relatively thin compared to the sum of second, third, fourth and fifth layers, for example preferably less than 10% for some applications and more preferably less than 5% for some applications. As described above, use of device configurations in the present invention providing a substantially symmetrical distribution of thermal expansion coefficients about layer alignment axis 980 orthogonal to a plane containing the contact surface(s) is useful for providing thermally stable patterning devices that exhibit minimal pattern distortions induced by changes in temperature. Further more, this symmetrical arrangement minimizes relief pattern distortions induced during curing, for example pattern distortions caused of curling of polymer layers during curing.<br>
The use of fiber materials allows for integration of a wide range of materials   having   useful   mechanical   and   thermal   properties,   including   brittle<br>
material, Into patterning devices and polymer layers of the present invention in a manner that preserves their ability of to exhibit flexibility allowing for establishment of conformal contact with rough and contoured substrate surfaces, such as surfaces having a large radius of curvature. For example, SiO2 is a material that is very brittle in the bulk phase. However, use of SiO2 fibers, fiber arrays and fiber meshes that are relatively thin (e.g. have diameters less than about 20 microns) allow structural reinforcement of polymer layers and enhances net flexural rigidity while maintaining their ability to be flexed, stretched and deformed.   Furthermore, SiO2<br>
exhibits good adhesion to some	polymers, including PDMS.    Carbon fibers are<br>
another class of materia! that integration into polymer layers leads to substantially enhancement of flexural rigidity and Young's modulus while allowing for device flexibility useful for establishing good conformal contact with a range of surface morphologies.<br>
Any composition of fiber material and physical dimensions of fiber materials, may be used in fiber reinforced polymer layers of the present invention that provides patterning device and polymer layers exhibiting beneficial mechanical, structural and thermal properties. Fiber materials useful in the present composite patterning devices include, but are not limited to, fibers comprising glass including oxides such as SiO2, Al2O2, B2O3, CaO, MgO, ZnO, BaO, Li2O, TiO2, ZrO2. Fe2O3, F2, and Na3O / K2O, carbon,.polymers such as aramid fiber and dyneema, metals and ceramics or mixtures of these materials may be incorporated into patterning devices of the present invention. Fiber materials exhibiting good adhesion to the polymer comprising the layer it is integrated into are preferred materials for some applications. Fibers having lengths ranging from about 1 to about 100 microns are useful in fiber reinforced composite patterning devices of present invention, preferably about 5 to about 50 microns for some applications. Fibers having diameters ranging from about 0.5 microns to about 50 microns are useful in fiber reinforced composite patterning devices of present invention, preferably about 5 to about 10 microns for some applications,<br>
Composite layers in fiber reinforced patterning devices of the present invention may have any selected arrangement of fibers providing patterning devices with  useful   mechanical   and  thermal   properties.      Use  of fiber  arrangements<br>
characterized by a high fiber volume fraction, for example a fiber volume fraction greater than about 0.7, is useful in composite layers (e.g. layer 910 in Figure 14A) providing support to relief features and recessed areas, including roof support, to in relief patterns of low modulus layers having one or more contact surfaces. Use of fiber arrangements characterized by a lower fiber volume fraction, for example a fiber volume fraction less than about 0.5, is useful in composite layers (e.g. layers 915 and 920 in Figure 14A) providing a desirable net stamp thickness in order to maintain the flexibility of the fiber reinforced composite patterning device. As exemplified in the schematic diagrams shown in Figures 14A 14G, use of a plurality of composite layers having different selected fiber orientations is useful in for providing fiber reinforced composite patterning devices having isotropic mechanical properties with respect to deformation along axis that are orthogonal to a plane containing the contact surface.<br>
In addition to their in addition to their structural and mechanical properties, fiber materials for fiber reinforced composite patterning devices of the present invention may also be selected on the basis of their optical and/or thermal properties. Use of fibers having a refractive index equal to or similar to the polymer material in which it is integrated into (i.e. matched to within 10%) is useful for providing optically transparent composite polymer layers. For example, the index of refraction of SiO2 fiber can be tuned to match the index of refraction of PDMS (typically between 14. to 1.6) to make a highly transparent composite polymer layer. Matching refractive index of fiber and polymer materials in a given composite polymer layer is particularly useful for fiber reinforced composite photomasks of the present invention. In addition, selection of a fiber material having a thermal expansion coefficient equal to or similar to the polymer material in which it is integrated into (i.e. matched to within 10%) is useful for providing thermal stable fiber reinforced composite patterning devices.<br>
Example 4:    Composite Soft Conformal Photomask<br>
The present invention includes composite patterning devices comprising photomasks capable of establishing and maintaining conformal contact with the surface of a substrate undergoing processing with electromagnetic radiation.     An  advantage  of composite conformal  photomasks  of the  present<br>
invention is that they are able to conform to a wide range of substrate surface morphologies without significantly changing the optical properties, such as two dimensional transmission and absorption properties, of the photomask. This property of the present invention provides photomasks capable of transmitting electromagnetic radiation having well defined two dimensional spatial distributions of intensities, polarization states and/or wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation on selected areas of a substrate surface, thereby allowing fabrication of patterns on substrate exhibiting good fidelity and placement accuracy.<br>
Figure 16 provides a schematic diagram of a composite soft conformal photomask of the present invention. As shown in Figure 16, the composite soft conformal photomask 1000 comprises a first polymer layer 1005 having a low Young's modulus and having a contact surface 1010, a patterned layer photomasking layer 1015 comprising a plurality of optically transmissive 1017 and nontransmissive regions 1016, and a second polymer layer 1020 having high Young's modulus and an external surface 1025. In a useful embodiment, the first polymer layer comprises PDMS and the second polymer layer comprises polyimide. Transmissive regions 1017 at least partially transmit electromagnetic radiation exposed to external surface 1025 and nontransmissive regions 1016 at least partially attenuate the intensities of electromagnetic radiation exposed to external surface 1025, for example by reflecting, absorbing or scattering the electromagnetic radiation. In the embodiment shown in Figure 16, nontransmissive regions 1016 are reflective thin aluminum films in contact with a substantially transparent Ti/SiO2 layer. In this arrangement, substantially transparent regions between reflective thin aluminum films are transmissive regions.<br>
To provide patterning on a substrate surface, the composite soft conformal photomask 1000 is brought into contact with a substrate surface such that the contact surface 1010 of first polymer iayer 1005 establishes conformal contact with the substrate surface. Electromagnetic radiation having first two dimensional distributions of intensities, polarization states and/or wavelengths is directed onto external surface 1025 of second polymer layer 1020 of composite soft conformal photomask 1000. Reflection, absorption and/or scattering by nontransmissive  regions  1016  generates  transmitted  electromagnetic  radiation<br><br>
characterized by different two dimensional distributions of intensities, polarization states and/or wavelengths. This transmitted electromagnetic radiation interacts with the substrate surface and generates physically and/or chemically modified regions of the substrate surface. Patterns are fabricated either by removing at least a portion of the chemically and/or physically modified regions of the substrate or by removing at least a portion of the substrate that is not chemically and/or physically modified.<br>
Figure 17A shows an optical image of a composite soft conformal photomask of the present invention and Figure 17B shows an optical image of exposed and developed photo-resist patterns on a silicon substrate. As shown in Figure 17A, the composite soft conformal photomask 1100 has a 5 millimeter thick handle 1105 providing a border which allows easy manipulation, cleaning and integration of the photomask with other processing instrumentation. A comparison of Figures 17A and 17B demonstrate that patterns having high fidelity are generated using the composite soft conformal photomask.<br>
Figure 18 provides a process flow diagram illustrating a method of making a composite soft conformal photomask of the present invention. As shown in process step A of Figure 18, a thin aluminum layer is deposited onto the internal surface of a high Young's modulus polymer via electron beam evaporation. As shown in process step B of Figure 18, a layer of photoresist is deposited on the aluminum layer, for example by spin coating, and is patterned, for example using conventional photolithography. This patterning step generates a patterned photomasking layer comprising thin aluminum films having selected physical dimensions and positions. As shown in process step C of Figure 18, a thin film of Ti/SiO2 is deposited on the aluminum patterned photomasking layer and exposed regions of the internal surface of the high Young's modulus polymer layer. Use of a Ti/SiO2 layer is useful for promoting adhesion to a PDMS layer in subsequent processing steps. As shown in process step D of Figure 18, a substantially flat silicon substrate is treated with a nonstick self assembled monoiayer and a thin layer of PDMS is spin coated on top of the self assembled monolayer. Use of the self assembled monolayer in this aspect of the invention is important for preventing irreversible bonding of the PDMS layer to the silicon surface and to avoid damage<br>
of the PDMS layer upon separation from the silicon substrate. As shown in process step E of Figure 18, the Ti/SiO2 layer of the composite structure comprising high Young's modulus layer and the pattern photomasking layer is brought into contact with the PDMS-coated silicon substrate. A force is applied to the external surface of the high Young's modulus layer and the PDMS iayer is cured at a temperature between 60 - 80 degrees Celsius for a few hours. Finally, the PDMS layer is separated from the silicon substrate thereby forming the composite soft conformal photomask.<br>
Example 4:    Lock and Key Registration System Using Patterning Agent<br>
The present invention provides methods and pattering devices and/or substrate surfaces having specific relief patterns, such as alignment channels, troughs and/or grooves, useful for providing proper registration and alignment of patterning devices and substrate surfaces. Particularly, use of "lock and key" alignment systems comprising complimentary (i.e. mating) relief features and recessed regions is useful in the present invention because engagement of complementary features constrains the possible relative orientations of the contact surface of a patterning device and a substrate surface. The ability to constrain the relative orientation of these elements is particularly useful for fabricating devices and device arrays with good placement accuracy over large substrate areas.<br>
in one aspect, the present invention includes alignment systems using a patterning agent for establishing and maintaining a selected spatial alignment between the contact surface of a patterning device, such as the contact surface of a composite patterning device or the contact surface of a single layer patterning device, and a selected region of the substrate surface. In the context of this, description, the term "patterning agent" refers to one or more materials that are provided between at least a portion of the contact surface of a patterning devices and a substrate surface undergoing processing. In this aspect of the present invention, the patterning agent functions to facilitate proper alignment and engagement of complementary relief features and recessed regions in a manner resulting good registration of these elements. Patterning agents of the present-invention may provide functionality other than or in addition to facilitating proper<br>
alignment of a patterning device and a substrate surface. In one embodiment, patterning agents of the present invention comprise an optical filtering medium for a photomask of the present invention. In another embodiment, patterning agents comprise a transfer material that is molded onto a substrate surface, for example a prepolymer material that is molded into a  pattern embossed on the substrate surface upon exposure to electromagnetic radiation or upon increasing temperature, Patterning agents of the present invention may also provide a multifunctional character such as a combination of facilitating alignment of a contact surface of a patterning device and a substrate surface undergoing processing and providing optical filtering and/or a transfer material for patterning a substrate surface.<br>
In one embodiment, patterning agents of the present invention act as lubricants by reducing friction generated between a mating contact surface and substrate surface pair of an alignment system, such as a iock and key registration system. By reducing friction, the patterning agent allows the patterning device and the substrate to establish conformal contact and move relative to each other, thereby sampling a range of possible relative orientations. In this aspect of the present invention, additional mobility provided by the patterning agent allows the patterning device and substrate surface to realize a stabfe, selected relative orientation characterized by effective coupling between complementary relief , features and recessed regions on the mating surfaces. Effective patterning agents facilitate establishing correct registration without interfering with establishment of conformal contact Useful patterning agents include fluids, such as liquids and colloids, thin films and particulate materials. Exemplary patterning agents include Optical Brightener, Benetex OB-EP from Mayzo, Parker ink, Water soluble black wooden dye Powerder from Constantines Wood Center.<br>
Patterning devices of this aspect of the present invention have a contact surface having a plurality of recessed regions or relief features having shapes and physical dimensions that are complementary to recessed regions or relief features on a substrate surface undergoing processing. Patterning devices of this aspect of the present invention also have a means for introducing the patterning agent into a least a part of the region between the contact surface and the substrate<br>
surface. Means for introducing the patterning agent can be a fluidic channel, groove or may involve wetting the contact surface or substrate surface prior to establishing conformal contact, for example using a clipping system. To achieve registration, the patterning device and substrate surface are gradually brought into contact by establishing an appropriate force, for example a force directed orthogonal to a plane containing at least a portion of the contact surface. Optionally, alignment may involve movement of the mating surface of the patterning device and the substrate surface in other directions, for example by lateral movement of the surfaces.<br>
In another aspect, the patterning agent acts as the optical filtering<br>
medium for a conformable  photomask.     In this aspect of the invention,  the<br>
composition of the patterning agent is selected such it that it absorbs, scatters,<br>
reflects or otherwise modulates some property of electromagnetic radiation directed<br>
onto the photomask, thereby selectively adjusting the intensities, wavelengths and<br>
polarization   states  of  light transmitted   onto   a   substrate   surface   undergoing<br>
patterning,    In one embodiment, for example, the patterning agent is provided<br>
between a conformable photomask having a relief pattern and the external surface<br>
of a substrate. Conformal contact between the photomask and the external surface<br>
of the substrate generates a series of spaces occupied by the patterning agent that<br>
are defined by the relief features and recessed regions of the relief pattern. These<br>
spaces may comprise a series of channels, chambers, apertures, grooves, slits<br>
and/or passages positioned between the photomask and the external surface of the<br>
substrate. The shapes and physical dimensions of the relief features and recessed<br>
regions of the photomask determine optical thicknesses of the patterning agent<br>
present in the spaces between the photomask and the substrate surface. Selection<br>
of the relief pattern geometry and composition of the patterning agent, therefore,<br>
provides a means of modulating transmitted electromagnetic radiation to achieve<br>
selected two dimensional spatial distributions of the intensities, wavelengths and/or<br>
polarization states of light transmitted onto the substrate surface. This aspect of the<br>
invention is particularly useful for patterning substrate surfaces having a layer of<br>
photosensitive material deposited on their external surfaces.<br>
Advantages of this patterning approach of the present invention include (i) it is compatible with the types of composite patterning devices described throughout this application, (ii) the patterning agent can have low viscosity, which enables it to flow rapidly and effectively as the patterning device is brought into contact with the patterning agent (which helps to push most of the patterning agent out of the regions that correspond to raised areas on the patterning device), (iii) it lubricates the interface between the contact surface {or coated contact surface) and the substrate surface (or coated substrate surface), (iv) it does not alter the stretchability of the patterning device, which is an important characteristic, especially if the patterning device has to stretch to match the lock and key features (due to slight deformations in the substrate, for example) and (v) it can pattern conventional photoresists whose processing conditions and uses are well established for many important electronic and photonic applications.<br>
Figures 19A and 19B provide schematic diagrams showing alignment systems using a patterning agent for aligning a photomask and substrate. Referring to Figures 19A and 19B, the alignment system 1300 of the present invention comprises a conformable photomask 1305 having a contact surface 1306, a substrate 1310 with an external surface 1313 undergoing processing and a patterning agent 1315 disposed between the contact surface 1306 and external surface 1313. In the embodiment shown in Figures 19A and 19B, external surface 1313 undergoing processing is coated with a photosensitive layer 1314, such as a photoresist layer. In the design shown in Figure 19A, conformable photomask 1300 comprises a first polymer layer, for example a PDMS layer, having a plurality of recessed regions 1320 having shapes and physical dimensions that are complementary to relief features 1325 present on external surface 1313 undergoing processing. In the design shown in Figure 19B, conformable photomask 1300 comprises a first polymer layer, for example a PDMS layer, having a plurality of relief features 1340 having shapes and physical dimensions that are complementary to recessed regions 1345 present on external surface 1313 undergoing processing. Relief features and recessed regions of this aspect of the present invention may have any pair of complementary shapes including, but not limited  to,   having  shapes  selected  from  the  group  consisting  of pyramidal,<br><br>
cylindrical, polygonal, rectangular, square, conical, trapezoidal, triangular, spherical and any combination of these shapes.<br>
Optionally,   conformable   photomask   1305   may  further   comprise additional relief features 13Q8 and recessed regions 1307 having selected shapes and physical dimensions. As shown in Figures 19A and 19B, conformal contact of photomask  1305 and  external  surface  1313, generates a  plurality of spaces occupied by patterning agent 1315, because substrate 1310 is not provided with relief features and recessed regions complementary to additional relief features 1308 and recessed regions 1307. In one embodiment, patterning agent 1315 is a material that absorbs, reflects or scatters electromagnetic radiation directed onto photomask 1305 and, therefore, the shapes and physical dimensions of relief features 1308 and recessed regions 1307 establishes two dimensional spatial distributions     of    intensities,     wavelengths     and/or    polarization     states     of electromagnetic radiation transmitted to photosensitive layer 1314 on external surface 1313. In this manner, selected regions of photosensitive layer 1314 may be illuminated with selected intensities of electromagnetic radiation having selected wavelengths and polarization states, and selected regions of photosensitive layer 1314 may be shielded from exposure to electromagnetic radiation having selected wavelengths and polarization states. This aspect of the present invention is useful for patterning photosensitive layer 1314 by exposure to electromagnetic radiation characterized  by a selected two  dimensional  spatial distribution  of intensities capable   of   generating    chemically   and/or   physically   modified    regions    of photosensitive layer 1314 corresponding to a desired pattern.  In one embodiment, the photomask 1305 is a phase only photomask which is substantially transparent. In this embodiment, it only forms an amplitude photomask when the patterning agent is present between contact surface 1306 and external surface 1313<br>
In another embodiment, patterning agent 1315 is a transfer material for molding patterns onto the substrate surface. In this embodiment, therefore, the shapes and physical dimensions of relief features 1308 and recessed regions 1307 establishes features of a pattern that is embossed onto photosensitive layer 1314 on external surface 1313.  Embodiments of this aspect of the present invention, are<br>
also useful for patterning a substrate surface via molding patterns on external surface 1313 directly (i.e. without photosensitive layer 1314 present).<br>
Optionally, conformable photomask 1305 is a composite photomask further comprising additional polymer layers, such as high Young's modulus layers, composite polymer layers and low Young's modulus layers (not shown in Figures 19A and 19B), As discussed throughout the present application, patterning device of the present invention having one or more additional polymer layers provides beneficial mechanical and/or thermal properties. Patterning devices of this Example of the present invention, however, do not have to be composite patterning devices.<br>
To generate a pattern on the surface of substrate 1310, patterning agent 1315 is provided between the contact surface 1306 of conformable photomask 1305 and external surface 1313, and the contact surface 1306 and external surface 1313 are brought into conformal contact. Patterning agent 1315 lubricates the interface between the first poiymer layer of conformable photomask . 1305 and the photosensitive layer 1314 on external surface 1313. The decrease in friction caused by the presence of the patterning agent 1315 enables the contact surface 1306 to align with the external surface 1313 such that the relief features (1325 or 1340) to optimally engage with recessed regions (1320 or 1345). Optimal alignment is achieved by providing a gradual force that brings the mating surface together, such as a force directed along an axis orthogonal to the contact surface (schematically represented by arrows 1380). Optionally, contact surface 1306 and external surface 1313 may be moved laterally (along an axis parallel to axis 1390) to enhance establishing of optima! engagement of recessed regions (1320 or 1345) and relief features (1325 or 1340).<br>
The conformable photomask 1305 is illuminated with electromagnetic radiation, and transmits electromagnetic radiation having a selected two dimensional spatial distribution of intensities, wavelengths and/or polarization states to photosensitive layer 1314. For example, patterning agent 1315 present in the region between relief features 1308 and recessed regions 1307 and external surface 1313  may absorb, scatter or reflect incident electromagnetic radiation,<br>
thereby providing spatially resolved optica! filtering functionality. For example, in one embodiment patterning agent 1315 absorbs UV electromagnetic radiation, thus creating contrast for patterning the photosensitive layer 1314 with ultraviolet light. The transmitted electromagnetic radiation interacts with portions of photosensitive layer 1314 thereby generating patterns of chemically and/or physically modified regions. After exposure to sufficient electromagnetic radiation for a given application, conformable photomask 1305 and substrate 1310 are separated, and photosensitive layer 1314 is developed by either removing at least a portion of chemically and/or physically modified regions of photosensitive layer 1314 or by removing at least a portion of photosensitive layer 1314 that is not chemically and/or physically modified.<br>
Figure 20 provides a schematic diagram illustrating an exemplary patterning method of the present invention using a patterning agent that comprises an optical medium {or ink) of conformable photomask. As shown in Figure 20, a substrate having a photoresist layer on its external surface is provided. The photoresist layer is contacted with a patterning agent comprising an ink and a conformable photomask is brought into conformal contact with the substrate. As shown in Figure 20, the pattern agent is present in spaces defined by the relief pattern of the conformable photomask. The conformable photomask is illuminated with electromagnetic radiation, and the pattern agent modulates the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation transmitted to the photoresist layer. As illustrated in Figure 20, the conformable photomask is them removed and the photoresist layer is developed, thereby generating a pattern on the substrate surface defined by the optical thicknesses of pattern agent present between the photomask and substrate.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

26.	A method of making a composite patterning device, said method comprising the steps of:<br>
providing a master relief pattern having a selected three-dimensional relief pattern;<br>
contacting said master relief pattern with a prepolymer of a low modulus polymer selected from the range of 1 MPa to 10 MPa;<br>
contacting said  prepolymer material with  an  high  modulus  polymer layer selected from the range of 1 GPa to 10 GPa;<br>
polymerizing said prepolymer, thereby generating a low modulus polymer layer in contact with said high modulus polymer layer and in contact with said master<br><br>
relief pattern; said low modulus polymer layer having a three-dimensional relief pattern; and<br>
separating said low modulus polymer layer from said master relief pattern, thereby making said composite patterning device.<br>
27.     A composite patterning device as claimed in any of the preceding claims as and when used in a method of generating a pattern on a substrate surface.</td>
