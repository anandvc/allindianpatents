				<td>Amalgam spheres for energy-saving lamps and their production<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to amalgam spheres for introducing mercury into modern energy-<br>
saving lamps.<br>
Modern energy-saving lamps of the TFL (tube fluorescent lamp) or CFL type (compact<br>
fluorescent lamp) type belong to the group of low-pressure gas discharge lamps. They<br>
comprise a gas discharge bulb which is filled with a mixture of mercury vapour and<br>
argon and is coated on the inside with a fluorescent luminophore. The ultraviolet<br>
radiation emitted by the mercury during operation is converted by the luminophore<br>
coating into visible light by means of fluorescence. The lamps are therefore also<br>
referred to as fluorescent lamps.<br>
The mercury required for operation of the lamps was in the past introduced as liquid<br>
metal into the gas discharge bulbs. However, introduction of the mercury in the form of<br>
amalgam spheres into the gas discharge bulbs has been known for a long time. This<br>
makes the handling of the toxic mercury easier and increases the accuracy of metering.<br>
US 4,145,634 describes the use of amalgam pellets which contain 36 atom% of indium<br>
and, owing to the high mercury content, contain a large proportion of liquid even at<br>
room temperature. The pellets therefore tend to conglutinate when they come into<br>
contact with one another. This can be prevented by coating the pellets with suitable<br>
materials in powder form. Stable metal oxides (titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, silicon<br>
dioxide, magnesium oxide and aluminium oxide), graphite, glass powder, phosphors,<br>
borax, antimony oxide and metal powders which do not form an amalgam with mercury<br>
(aluminium, iron and chromium) are proposed.<br>
WO 94/18692 describes the use of pellets of zinc amalgam containing from 5 to 60% by<br>
weight, preferably from 40 to 60% by weight, of mercury. To produce spheroidal<br>
amalgam pellets, the process described in US 4,216,178, in which the molten amalgam<br>
is broken up into small droplets by means of a vibrationally excited discharge nozzle<br>
and cooled in a cooling medium to below the solidification temperature, is employed.<br>
The pellets are not coated as described in WO 94/18692.<br>
To produce amalgam spheres from the melt, the amalgam has to be heated to a<br>
temperature at which the amalgam is completely molten. In the case of a zinc amalgam,<br>
this is ensured reliably only at a temperature above 420°C. These high processing<br>
temperatures result in a high vapour pressure of mercury and make appropriate safety<br>
precautions necessary because of the toxicity of mercury.<br>
JP 2000251836 describes the use of amalgam pellets of tin amalgam for the production<br>
of fluorescent lamps. The tin amalgam preferably has only a low mercury content with a<br>
tin/mercury atom ratio of 90-80:10-20. This corresponds to a mercury content of from<br>
15.8 to 29.7% by weight. JP 2000251836 gives no information as to how spherical<br>
pellets are produced from the amalgam.<br>
A disadvantage of the tin amalgam described in JP 2000251836 is the low mercury<br>
content. This makes relatively large amalgam spheres necessary if a particular amount<br>
of mercury is to be introduced into the discharge lamps. Owing to the increasing<br>
miniaturization which is also being sought in the case of energy-saving lamps, this can<br>
lead to problems in the construction and manufacture of the lamps.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide amalgam spheres of tin amalgam<br>
which have a high mercury content and can be reliably stored and used in the<br>
production of energy-saving lamps without endangering human health.<br>
This object is achieved by amalgam spheres of a tin amalgam which has a mercury<br>
content in the range from 30 to 70% by weight. The amalgam spheres preferably have a<br>
mercury content of from 30 to 60% by weight and in particular from 40 to 55% by<br>
weight.<br>
The spheres can be produced from a melt of the amalgam by a process described in<br>
EP 1381485 Bl. For this purpose, the completely molten amalgam is introduced<br>
dropwise into a cooling medium having a temperature below the solidification<br>
temperature of the amalgam. The temperature of the cooling medium is preferably from<br>
10 to 20°C below the liquidus temperature of the amalgam. It is advantageous here that<br>
tin amalgams melt completely at temperatures below 230°C. The outlay for ensuring<br>
occupational hygiene in the production of tin amalgam spheres is therefore considerably<br>
lower than in the case of zinc amalgam spheres.<br>
As cooling medium, preference is given to using a mineral oil, an organic oil or a<br>
synthetic oil. A silicone oil has been found to be very useful. After formation of the<br>
amalgam spheres in the cooling medium, they are separated off from the cooling<br>
medium and degreased.<br>
Amalgam spheres having diameters in the range from 50 to 2000 µm, preferably from<br>
500 to 1500 µm, are suitable for the purposes of the invention.<br>
It has been found that liquid phases occur on the surface of the amalgam spheres which<br>
have been produced in this way, and the spheres therefore conglutinate during storage<br>
and handling if no countermeasures are taken. Conglutination can be prevented by, for<br>
example, storing and processing the amalgam spheres at temperatures below 8°C. For<br>
storage, a temperature of-18°C is preferred.<br>
The tendency of the amalgam spheres to conglutinate can be largely suppressed by<br>
coating the degreased spheres with a metal or alloy powder which forms an amalgam<br>
with mercury. The amalgamation of the metal powder forms a surface layer having a<br>
low mercury content on the spheres and since this no longer contains any liquid phases<br>
at the usual processing temperatures of the amalgam spheres, it reduces the tendency for<br>
conglutination compared to the untreated spheres.<br>
The metal or alloy powder used for the coating should not contain any particles having a<br>
particle diameter greater than 100 µm. Particles having larger particle diameters<br>
amalgamate only incompletely and lead to a rough surface of the spheres, which makes<br>
metering of the spheres more difficult. Preference is given to using a metal or alloy<br>
powder whose powder particles have a particle diameter of less than 80 µm. Particular<br>
preference is given to metal or alloy powders having an average particle diameter d50 in<br>
the range from 5 to 15 urn. Suitable metals have been found to be tin and zinc and<br>
alloys of tin or of zinc. Tin or a tin alloy are preferred. Good results have been obtained<br>
using alloys of tin with silver and copper, in particular the alloy SnAg3Cu0.5.<br>
To coat the amalgam spheres with the metal or alloy powder, the spheres can, for<br>
example, be placed in a rotating vessel and sprinkled with the metal or alloy powder<br>
while being continually mixed until conglutination of the spheres can no longer be<br>
observed. The amount of metal or alloy powder applied to the amalgam spheres is in the<br>
range from 1 to 10% by weight, preferably from 2 to 4% by weight, based on the weight<br>
of the amalgam spheres.<br>
A further reduction in the tendency for conglutination is obtained when the amalgam<br>
spheres are additionally coated with a powder of a metal oxide in an amount of from<br>
0.001 to 1% by weight, preferably from 0.01 to 0.5% by weight and in particular in an<br>
amount of 0.1% by weight, based on the weight of the amalgam spheres, after coating<br>
with the metal or alloy powder. The same procedure as for the application of the metal<br>
or alloy powder can be employed for this purpose. Suitable metal oxides for the coating<br>
are, for example, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, silicon oxide and aluminium oxide.<br>
Preference is given to using an aluminium oxide prepared by flame pyrolysis and<br>
having an average particle size of less than 5 µm, preferably less than 1 µm.<br>
The powder layers applied improve the handling of the amalgam spheres in automatic<br>
metering machines. The amalgam spheres can stay in such automatic metering<br>
machines for an average of up to 3 hours at room temperature before they are<br>
introduced into a fluorescent lamp. It has been found here that the amalgam spheres<br>
coated with metal or alloy powder and with metal oxide powder withstand the average<br>
residence time of 3 hours at temperatures of up to 40°C in the automatic metering<br>
machine without problems. If only one of the two layers is applied, some detachment of<br>
the layers applied occurs before the average residence time of 3 hours has elapsed.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following table. The table shows calculated values for<br>
the total mass (Sn+Hg) and the mass of mercury (Hg) of tin amalgam spheres as a<br>
function of the diameter of the spheres and for tin amalgams having mercury contents of<br>
from 20 to 50% by weight. In addition, the table shows the densities ? of the various<br>
amalgams as have been used for the calculations.<br>
When spheres of the same diameter are employed, the use of tin amalgam having high<br>
mercury contents enables significantly more mercury to be introduced into the gas<br>
discharge bulbs than when a tin amalgam having a low mercury content of only 20% by<br>
weight is used. Thus, amalgam spheres of SnHg50 containing 50% by weight of<br>
mercury contain about three times the mass of mercury as amalgam spheres of SnHg20<br>
containing only 20% by weight of mercury.<br>

<br>
Energy-saving lamps contain a gas filling of mercury vapour and argon in a gas<br>
discharge bulb. Amalgam spheres are used for filling the gas discharge bulb with<br>
mercury. A tin amalgam having a high proportion by weight of mercury in the range<br>
from 30 to 70% by weight is proposed. Owing to the high mercury content, the<br>
amalgam spheres have liquid amalgam phases on the surface. Coating of the spheres<br>
with a tin or tin alloy powder converts the liquid amalgam phases on the surface into a<br>
solid amalgam having a high tin content. This prevents conglutination of the amalgam<br>
spheres during storage and processing.<br>
