The present invention relates to liquid pharmaceutical compositions, in particular to depot formulations comprising somatostatin analogues and to a process for preparing said depot formulations.<br>
Depot formulations are typically administered parenteralty. Somatostatin depot formulations may be administered by injection subcutaneously or intramuscularly through a small gauge needle or placed into accessible tissue sites through a cannula. However parenteral administration may be very painful especially if repeated injections are necessary. Furthermore, there may be difficulties with depot formulations which are administered in liquid form and which form a solid implant in the body after injection. Often the solidifying process starts in the syringe before injection and causes needle clogging. Further, these depot formulations may comprise a polymer or a mixture of polymers that has to be dissolved in an organic solvent, e.g. they may comprise more than 50 % of an organic solvent. If the organic solvent remains in the solution for injection it might cause severe tissue irritation or necrosis at the site of implantation.<br>
EP 779 805 provides a pharmaceutical composition consisting of a soluble peptide salt which will form a gel upon contact with a body fluid, and up to 30% by weight of the composition of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The peptides described in EP 779805 are somatostatins or a somatostatin analogs, e.g. lanreotide.<br>
Surprisingly it has now been found that advantageous parenteral somatostatin depot formulations may be obtained with a composition comprising a salt of a somatostatin analogue and water having a pH from 3 to 7 without using a polymer and without using an organic solvent.<br>
The present invention provides in one aspect a pharmaceutical composition for parenteral administration comprising a somatostatin analogue salt of aspartate, e.g. mono- or diaspartate, glutamate, e.g. mono- or diglutamate, or succinate, e.g. mono- or disuccinate, lactate, acetate or citrate and water, forming a gelling depot after injection in contact with body fluid. The salt: base ratio of the somatostatin analogue salts may range from 0.1 to 2 and provides the solubility of the somatostatin analogue salt. The pharmaceutical<br><br>
cornposition has a pH between about 3.0 and 7.0, preferably from between 4.0 and 6.0 and more preferably from between about 4.0 and 5.0. Optionally the composition may comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer in an amount to stabilize the pH between about 3.0 and 7.0, preferably between about 4.0 and 6.0, most preferably between 4.0 and 5.0.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for parenterai administration comprising a somatostatin analogue salt of aspartate, e.g. mono- or diaspartate, glutamate, e.g. mono- or diglutamate, lactate, succinate, e.g. mono- or disuccinate, acetate or citrate, and water, having a pH between about 3.0 and 7.0, forming a gelling depot after injection in contact with body fluid.<br>
The composition having a pH between about 3.0 and 7.0 provides good solubility and therefore the composition of the invention may be stored over an extended period of time without precipitation. The composition is administered to the patient by injection wherein the composition will start to form a gelling depot after and not before interaction with patients body fluid. The gelling depot releases the somatostatin analogue salt of aspartate, lactate, succinate, acetate, glutamate or citrate within the patient over an extended period of time.<br>
In another aspect the invention provides a process for preparing a depot formulation by<br>
i) dissolving a somatostatin analogue salt of aspartate, e.g. mono- or diaspartate, lactate, succinate, e.g. mono- or disuccinate, acetate, glutamate, e.g. mono- or diglutamate or citrate in water,<br>
ii)       optionally adding a buffer to stabilize the pH of the solution, and optionally<br>
iii)       filling the solution into a syringe<br>

For compositions of the invention comprising the somatostatin salt of aspartate, lactate, succinate, acetate, glutamate or citrate satisfactory results are obtained on administration, e.g. parenteral administration, at dosages in the order of from about 0.1 to about 100 mg, preferably from about 3 to about 60 mg per injection per month or about 0.01 to about 4 mg preferably 0.1 to 1 mg per kg animal body weight per month, administered once or in divided doses. Suitable monthly dosages for patients are thus in the order of about 0.1 mg to about 80 mg of a somatostatin analogue salt of aspartate, lactate, succinate, acetate, glutamate or citrate.<br>
The present invention provides a simple pharmaceutical composition of somatostatin analogue salt of aspartate, e.g. mono- or diaspartate, lactate, succinate e.g. mono- or disuccinate, acetate, glutamate, e.g. mono- or diglutamate, or citrate in a saltrbase ratio ranging from 0.1 to .2 and water at a defined pH between 3.0 to 7.0, preferably between about 4.0 to 6.0, more preferably between about 4.0 to 5.0. The salt base ratio ranging from 0.1 to 2 provides the solubility of the somatostatin analogue salt at a given pH and the precipitation and depot formation after contact with body fluids and therefore environmental pH change. The pH may be stabilized by &amp; buffer. The process to prepare the composition is simple by adding water to the somatostatin analogue salt. At a pH between about 4.0 to 6.0 the composition shows good solubility and therefore precipitation, e.g. in a prefilled, syringe  -or needle clogging is avoided. No organic solvents that might cause severe side effects at the place of administration are used.<br>
