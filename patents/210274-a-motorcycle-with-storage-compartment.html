				<td> <br><br>
This  invention relates to a motorcycle with  storage compartment•<br>
In the known motorcycle, articles are usually stored in boxes provided on one or both sides of the vehicle at the rear of the vehicle. This construction detracts from the comforts of riding, particularly, for the pillion rider to whom such construction is a hindrance.<br>
Another kind of storage device provided for  the known motorcycle is compactly integrated with the body of the vehicle,  and  less cumbrous; however, this device is limited to storing small articles.<br>
None of the storage devices for the known motorcycle is<br>
spacious  enough to accommodate large  size  articles,<br>
such as, a crash-helmet.<br>
*<br>
The known scooters, on the other hand, have adequate storage space provided under the seat, for storage of even large size articles such as crash-helmets, without marring aesthetic appeal or ergonomics. in some cases, this  factor  is believed to have made the customer-<br><br>
choice of vehicle, between the motorcycle and scooter, tilt in favour of the latter, just because of storage space provisions being better in the case of the latter than in the case of the former -<br>
Storage space has ofteh been one of the governihg considerations, for the customer,  in choosing the scooter, instead of the motorcycle, despite the fact that persons opting for a scooter based on such considerations would otherwise have chosen the motorcycle for its proven stability, speed, highway riding qualities and comfort,<br>
*<br>
This invention, therefore, proposes a motorcycle which provides ample storage space and thus puts this vehicle on an equal footing with the scooter so far as storage facilities are concerned•<br>
The motorcycle proposed herein is  acceptable  from the viewpoint of aesthetics or "looks" which are traditionally  part of the vehicle.  The   storage compartment is also acceptable from the ergonomic standpoint.<br><br>
In the motorcycle with storage compartment, according to this invention, the said compartment is fixed to the space frame of the vehicle and is located between the handle bar of the vehicle and the rider's seat; a hinged lid provided for the compartment, for opening and closing the compartment? a fuel tank disposed beneath the compartment and also fixed to the space frame; and an inlet for the fuel tank, with a cap for opening and closing the inlet.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way    of example, and not by way of limitation, three of possible embodiments of the motorcycle proposed herein.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrating a view of one such embodiment<br>
Fig. 2 illustrating an orthographic view of the view<br>
* in Fig. 1 with the lid in the closed position<br>
Fig. 3 illustrating a view of the view in Fig. 2 with the lid in the opened position<br>
Fig. 4A illustrating a view of another embodiment with a cover provided for the fuel inlet and cap<br><br>
and<br>
Fig. 4B illustrating a view of yet another embodiment with the fuel inlet and cap provided at the side of the fuel tank.<br>
A  storage compartment 3 is fixed to the space  frame<br>
tubes  2A and 2B of the space frame of the motorcycle.<br>
The compartment 3 is located between the  handlebar  of<br>
the vehicle and the rider's seat S.<br>
• ■■ The  compartment 3 is provided with  a hinged  lid  3A,<br>
the location of the hinge being indicated by 3B so that<br>
the lid 3A can be opened away from the rider to provide<br>
access to the interior of the compartment 3.<br>
The  hinge can alternatively be provided  at  either<br>
side  of the lid at the location 3D or 3E so that  the<br>
*<br>
lid can be opened sidewards; however, it is preferred to have the hinge at the location 3B, since this is convenient in operation and use. The compartment and lid will be provided with a lock for security purposes.<br>
A  fuel tank 1 is disposed beneath the compartment 3.<br><br>
The tank 1 is also fixed to the tubes 2A and 2B of  the space  frame. The fuel tank is provided with  a  fuel inlet 1B and cap lA.<br>
According to one construction, the compartment and the tank are irremovably fixed to the space frame.<br>
According to another, alternative, construction, the compartment and the tank are detachably fixed to the space frame. This provision facilitates removal of-, the compartment and tank, whenever necessary, as for instance, for cleaning the compartment and tank, and for replacing the compartment and tank in position on the space frame -<br>
According to one construction, the fuel inlet and cap are disposed on the top of the fuel tank, as illustrated (Figs. 1 to 4 A)<br>
According to another construction, the fuel inlet and cap are disposed at the side of the fuel tank (Fig.4 B)<br>
According to yet another construction, the fuel .. .inlet and cap are provided with a cover 3C, adjacent the  lid<br><br>
(Pig.4 A). In such event, preferably, the surfaces of the lid 3A and the cover 30 are in alignment to provide a smooth, continuous contour for the said surfaces. The cover 30 protects the fuel inlet 1B and cap lA from dust and grime. The cover30 will be hinged to enable the same to be opened and closed over the inlet cap lA. The cover is provided with a lock. The interior of the compartment is provided with a plurality of sub-compartments .<br>
The term "motorcycle" used in this specification not only means a motorcycle properly so called but also a motorcycle behind or around the front portion of which a body is built to run on three or more wheels as, for instance, a vehicle in which the front portion of a motorcycle is provided while the rest of such vehicle accommodates seating arrangement for passengers. The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention to exclude any equivalents of the features illustrated and described but it is understood that various other embodiments of the motorcycle proposed<br>
herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of his invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
