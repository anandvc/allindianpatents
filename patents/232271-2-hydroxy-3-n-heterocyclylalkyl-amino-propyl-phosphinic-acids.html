Phosphinic Acid Derivatives<br>
The present invention relates to phosphinic acid derivatives as GABAB antagonists, their preparation, their use as pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
More particularly, the invention provides a compound of formula I<br>
wherein <br>
R	is (C3_5)alkyl, di(C1-4)alkoxymethyl, (C3_6)cycloalkyl(Ci_4)alkyl or benzyl optionally<br>
substituted. in the aromatic ring by one to three radicals selected from (C1-4)alkyl, (G1-6)alkoxy<br>
and halo,<br>
R.!	is hydrogen or hydroxy,<br>
R2	is a group of formula<br><br>
wherein Ra is (Cu)alkoxy, and R3 is hydrogen or (C1-4)alkyl, or a salt thereof<br>
On account of their amphoteric nature, the compounds of formula I can form both acid addition salts and salts with bases.'<br>
Depending on the presence of asymmetric carbon atoms (e.g. when R, is hydroxy), the compounds of formula I and their salts may be in the form of isomeric mixtures, especially of racemates, or in the form of pure isomers, especially of optical antipodes.<br><br>
Halo denotes fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides a process for the production of the compounds of formula I and their salts, which comprises, in a compound of formula II,<br><br>
wherein R and R2 are as defined above, R4 is a hydroxy-protecting group, R5 is hydrogen or protected hydroxy and R6 is R3 as defined above or an amino-protecting group, or in a salt thereof, freeing the hydroxy group by replacing the hydroxy-protecting group R4 by hydrogen and, where appropriate, freeing the hydroxy group R, from the protected hydroxy group R5, removing the amino-protecting group R6 and, if desired, converting a resulting compound into a different compound of formula I, separating a mixture of isomers into its components and/or converting a salt into the corresponding free compound or vice-versa.<br>
Suitable hydroxy-protecting and amino-protecting groups are well known from the literature. Also the steps of freeing the hydroxy groups and removing the amino-protecting groups can be effected in conventional manner.<br>
The subsequent conversion steps can be carried out in succession or simultaneously in accordance with methods known per se.<br>
Preferably, all the hydroxy- and amino-protecting groups are replaced by hydrogen in a single step by treatment with a tri-lower alkylsilyl halide, such as trimethylbromosilane, or with an acid, preferably a hydrohalic acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid, under hydrolytic conditions.<br>
The starting materials of formula II can be prepared for example by reacting in customary manner a compound of formula III<br><br><br>
wherein R, R4 and R5 are as defined above and X is halogen, preferably chlorine, bromine or iodine, with a compound of formula IV<br><br>
wherein R2 and R6 are as defined above.<br>
The compounds of formula HI and IV are known or may be produced in analogous manner to known procedures.<br>
The novel compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hereinafter referred to as the agents of the invention, have valuable GABAB~antagonistic properties. In particular, they exhibit effective binding to the GABAB-receptor and prove to be antagonists of GAB A (y-aminobutyric acid) at that receptor.<br>
The agents of the invention interact at the GABAg-receptor with IC50 values of approximately I0~sM (moles/1) and above in cerebral cortex membranes of rats. In contrast to GABAB-agonists such as baclofen, they do not potentiate the stimulation of adenylate cyclase by noradrenalin in sections of rat cerebral cortex, but act as an antagonist to the action of baclofen. The antagonism to baclofen can also be demonstrated in vitro in electrophysiological models, for example the penicillin-induced “epileptic” hippocampus section preparation, where baclofen in a concentration of 6 μM inhibits “epilepsy-like” discharges of pyramidal cells. The agents of the invention act as antagonists to baclofen at concentrations of from approximately 10 to approximately 100 μVL In vivo, the. antagonism can be demonstrated by iontophoresis of baclofen in the cerebral cortex of rats and by systemic administration of antagonists in doses of from 10 to 100 mg/kg. At doses of approximately 30 mg/kg, antagonism to the muscle-relaxing action of baclofen occurs, which is measured in the Rotarod model.<br><br>
The agents of the invention not only exhibit antagonism to baclofen, but also exhibit an independent<br>
action as antagonists to endogenous GAB A. Accordingly, the antagonists are active in conventional<br>
behavioural models which are characteristic of anti-depressive, anxiolytic and/or nootropic properties.<br>
It has been found that compounds of formula I are active on oral administration in the floating test<br>
according to Porsolt, in the Geller test, the delayed passive avoidance test (single-attempt<br>
it<br>
modification) in pre-test and post-test situations, in the two-chamber test and the complex labyrinth. Moreover, in studies on Rhesus monkeys an increased play instinct, curiosity, social grooming behaviour and a reduction in anxiety symptoms were observed.<br>
The agents of the invention are therefore suitable as nootropics, anti-depressants and anxiolytics, and for the treatment of symptoms of cerebral insufficiency, cognition deficits, depression, esp. emotional depression, Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, schizophrenia, or cognitive deficits, for example in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, or schizophrenia.<br>
Moreover it has been found that the agents of the invention have pronounced anti-absence properties in vivo.<br>
These properties can be demonstrated in a particular strain of rats on the basis of their pronounced inhibitory action on spontaneous “spike and wave” discharges in the animal model for absence epilepsy described in Vergnes et al. Neurosci. Lett. 33, 97-101 (1982). The agents of the invention are therefore suitable as active ingredients in anti-epileptic medicaments for the treatment of epilepsies of the “petit mal” type, both of spontaneous absence epilepsies, such as spontaneous absence epilepsies in children and young people, and atypical absences, such as absences of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and also of absences that occur as undesired side effects in the case of treatment with conventional “grand mal” anti-epileptics, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine or Vigabatrin® and anti-epileptics having the same or a similar activity profile.<br>
For the above-mentioned indications, the appropriate dosage will of course vary depending upon, for example, the compound employed, the host, the mode of administration and the nature and severity of the condition being treated. However, in general, satisfactory results in animals are indicated to be obtained at a daily dosage of from about 0.1 to about 100 mg/kg animal body weight. In larger mammals, for example humans, an indicated daily dosage is in the range from about 5 to about 500<br><br>
mg of an agent of the invention, conveniently administered, for example, in divided doses up to four times a day or in sustained release form.<br>
The agents of the invention may be administered by any conventional route, in particular enterally, preferably orally, for example in the form of tablets or capsules, or parenterally, for example in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions.<br>
In accordance with the foregoing, the present invention also provides an agent of the invention, for use as a pharmaceutical, e.g. for the treatment of cerebral insufficiency, depression, anxiety and epilepsy.<br>
The present invention furthermore provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an agent of the invention in association with at least one pharmaceutical carrier or diluent. Such compositions may be manufactured in conventional manner. Unit dosage forms contain, for example, from about 0.25 to about 150, preferably from 0.25 to about 25 mg of a compound according to the invention.<br>
Moreover the present invention provides the use of an agent of the invention, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of any condition mentioned above, e.g. epilepsy, cerebral insufficiency, depression and anxiety.<br>
In still a further aspect the present invention provides a method for the treatment of any condition mentioned above, e.g. epilepsy of the “petit mal” type, cerebral insufficiency, depression and anxiety, in a subject in need of such treatment, which comprises administering to such subject a therapeutically effective amount of an agent of the invention.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention.<br>
