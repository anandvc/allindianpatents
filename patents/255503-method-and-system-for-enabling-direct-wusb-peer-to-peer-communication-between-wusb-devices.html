FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the field of wireless networks. Further, this invention relates to medium access control for wireless personal area networks (WPAN) that are based on wireless mobile ad-hoc networks. Further, this invention relates to the medium access control (MAC) for wireless universal serial bus (WUSB). Specifically, this invention relates to the medium access control functionality of wireless universal serial bus host. Particularly, this invention relates to communication between WUSB Hosts and Devices; Peer to Peer communication between WUSB devices; and Peer to Peer communication between all types of WUSB devices by a WUSB protocol enhancement. More particularly, this invention encompasses a system and method for enabling Peer to Peer communication between wireless universal serial bus devices in wireless personal area networks based on ultra wide band (UWB) systems.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
The wireless personal area networks are defined to operate in the personal operating space, i.e. in a range of approximately 10 meters. The WiMedia Alliance (http://www.wimedia.org) is involved in defining standards for such wireless personal area networks. The Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology can provide data rates exceeding several hundreds of Mbps in this personal operating space. In wireless personal area networks, the medium is shared between all the devices for communication with each other. This necessitates a medium access control<br><br>
mechanism for the devices to manage medium access, broadly including how it may join the network, how it can transfer data at the required rate to another device, how the medium is best used, how to detect and resolve beacon collisions, etc.<br>
Medium access control for wireless personal area networks is designed in distributed manner. The medium access operations are distributed evenly across all devices in the network and all the devices share the load of managing medium access operations for each other. Figure 1 show the wireless personal area network, which is based on distributed approach and which does not have any centralized coordinator. It involves a decentralized WPAN, in which devices are light coordinator and there is no dedicated coordinator present. All devices cooperate and share information with each other to perform the medium access control tasks such as allowing a new device to join, allocation of channel time to a device to transmit data to another device, synchronization mechanisms etc. This is a Distributed WPAN system which is formed in an ad-hoc fashion. Each device periodically broadcasts the information about its neighbors and allocated channel time to its neighbors.<br>
The Distributed medium access control approach relies on a timing concept called the Superframe. Superframe has a fixed length in time and is divided into a number of time windows which are called time slots. Some of the time slots are used by the devices to send their beacons and the other are used by the devices to send the data. The slots in which beacon is sent are called beacon slots and<br><br>
the slots in which data is sent are called data slots. The length of a beacon period may be less than the length of a data period. The beacon slots may be distributed across the slots in the superframe or may appear together at the start of the superframe. In addition, the number of beacon slots may be fixed or variable leading to different configurations of Distributed Medium Access Control mechanisms.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the superframe structure, specified by the WiMedia MAC. It consists of several Medium Access Slots (As an example, the number is shown as 256). Some Medium Access Slots (MAS) constitute beacon period (comprising of beacon slots corresponding to multiple devices) and remaining MASs constitute data period (comprising of data slots that may be used by different devices in the network to transmit data to other devices in the network), employs a superframe duration of 65,536 micro-second with 256 MASs, and each MAS is of 256 microsecond duration. Information about superframe is being broadcasted by each device in its broadcasted beacons, so neighbors of that device can use that information for further processing. The start time of the superframe is determined by the beginning of the beacon period and defined as the beacon period start time (BPST).<br>
Devices that belong to the same beacon period shall utilize the same BPST for the superframe. However, some of the devices may define a different time as their BPST. In such case, 2 or more beacon groups may coexist for the device. MASs<br><br>
are numbered relative to this starting time. The devices shall transform the numbering of MASs of other beaconing periods into the time reference of their main beaconing period. A device can be part of several beaconing periods but has to select one beaconing period as its main beaconing period.<br>
MASs can be reserved through Distributed Reservation Protocol (DRP). The reservation can be of different reservation type like Hard, Soft, PCA (Prioritized Contention Access) or Private. All reservation type uses different access method to access the channel. Private reservation type does not define any access method; it is up to the implementation to use an access method in private reservation. Each device which is target of the reservation or owner of the reservation sends a DRP IE in their beacon.<br>
Private reservation is used by Wireless USB for its communication over WiMedia based UWB channel. Wireless USB being a central entity reserve private reservation in which other devices can work over the reservation.<br>
WiMedia MAC also defines a channel access method called Prioritized Contention Access (PCA). This can be used in reservation of type PCA or any unreserved time in superframe.<br>
Device uses 16 bit device address (DevAddr) as an addressing entity. Two type of addressing is defined by WiMedia MAC. Address called generated address is generated by the device randomly. If same address found in neighborhood being<br><br>
used by some other device then address will be generated again, this procedure is called address conflict resolution. Another type of address called Private address, which is not generated by the device, but assigned by some other mean. Wireless USB uses generated address for WUSB devices which is assigned by WUSB Host.<br>
USB is one of the most successful PC peripheral protocols. Wireless USB is a wireless extension of the USB protocol, which uses WiMedia common radio platform as physical medium. Today wireless USB can be used for different kind of applications like PC peripheral, consumer electronics, handheld device to device connection etc.<br>
Any WUSB node is generally defined as WUSB Host or as WUSB Device. WUSB Host is a coordinator of the WUSB topology and controls the functions of WUSB devices connected to it. Generally WUSB Host is part of PC or device which has enough memory and power capability. WUSB Host is responsible for managing the connections with device; any kind of communication; channel access mechanism; scheduling of traffic; interference mitigation; and WiMedia common radio platform related functionality. WUSB Host creates a private reservation according to WiMedia MAC, which is called WUSB Channel that is used for any WUSB related communications between the host and its devices. WUSB device connects to a WUSB Host for any communication. WUSB devices are generally categorized as small and mobile devices. WUSB devices have more than one communication pipes with WUSB Host for control and data transfers. It uses<br><br>
information provided by WUSB Host to interact with the host. WUSB device may or may not implement all functionality of WiMedia common radio platform. Physical interference can be managed by services provided by WiMedia common radio platform.<br>
According to current WUSB specification WUSB topology is a centralized topology, where WUSB Host is a central controlling entity. WUSB devices can connect to WUSB Host for any type of communication. WUSB host is always one of the partners in any communication in WUSB Channel. WUSB host also has the ability to send periodic broadcast messages to all the devices in the WUSB channel. Two WUSB devices cannot connect to each other in a Peer to Peer fashion.<br>
WUSB Hosts sends Micro-scheduled Management Command (MMC) in WUSB Channel periodically. MMC is control message from WUSB Host to WUSB devices around. MMC contains different type of information elements (IE) to perform different type of operations and to provide different information to devices. WUSB device uses information in MMC for connection establishment; channel time allocation for transmission and reception of data; and any other control and data operations.<br>
WUSB device initiates the connection with WUSB Host from the information provided by the WUSB Host in its MMC. WUSB Host provides the channel time of WUSB Channel for new device to send connection request message. WUSB<br><br>
Device and Host exchange messages for connection establishment and authentication. After successful negotiation device is considered to be in 'connected and authenticated' state. WUSB Host provides an address to the newly connected WUSB device from WiMedia MAC'S private address range.<br>
WUSB devices request the host for channel time when they want to communicate with the host. WUSB host reserves a portion of WUSB Channel time for this communication and labels this reservation as Channel Time Allocation (CTA). When a WUSB host wants to communicate with any device it allocates a CTA for the same. CTA are unidirectional in nature, i.e. only one direction of communication (host to device or device to host) can take place within a CTA. Exact time, duration and direction of the data transmission is allocated by WUSB Host, which is given via Device Transmit CTA (DtCTA) (device to host transmission) and Device Receive CTA (DrCTA) (host to device transmission). The information about the current CTA allocations in WUSB channel is sent by the WUSB host to all the devices as an IE containing various sub-blocks, one for each time allocation, in the MMC. Devices listen to those portions of the WUSB channel where they have CTAs allocated for them. Devices may require sending other kinds of control messages to the host. WUSB specification provides Device Notifications for such message exchange between the device and host.<br>
The present state of art in this field, has certain limitations, namely, there is no mechanism to communicate directly between two or more WUSB devices without the mediation of the WUSB Host. Communication between two devices in the<br><br>
current art can only take place in a split manner wherein the host mediates the communication between the originator and destination device. Firstly, source device communicates with the Host device by reserving some channel time. The host then communicates with the destination device in some other channel time thereby routing the original message to the destination. Current art has no method by which the source device and directly send message to the destination device without the above mentioned mediation of the WUSB host.<br>
Currently the mechanism, as defined in current art, can suffer from following limitations:<br>
—	There is no way in current art that a WUSB device can communicate with another WUSB device directly.<br>
—	There is no way to route any WUSB traffic between two devices<br>
—	There is no way to enable Peer to Peer communication between two WUSB devices without one of them implementing a WUSB Host like functionality, in essence, becoming a WUSB Host itself.<br>
—	There is no way a WUSB device can connect to more than one WUSB device.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the<br><br>
claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The present invention relates to a system that allows an improved medium access control in the decentralized Wireless Personal Area Networks based on mobile ad-hoc networks.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a mechanism for direct peer to peer communication between two WUSB devices. The invention provides a mechanism for establishing direct peer to peer communication between two WUSB devices. It provides a mechanism for reserving channel time for direct peer to peer communication between two WUSB devices.<br>
Also, the invention provides a mechanism where new kind of channel time allocation called the Peer Channel Time Allocation (PCTA) is introduced. It provides a mechanism where new kind of IE called the P2P IE is introduced.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a mechanism where new kind of WUSB notification messages called P2P Notifications is introduced.<br>
The subsequent subsections describe the invented objects to effect the invention:<br><br>
1.  Peer Channel Time Allocation (PCTA)<br>
PCTA is a proposed type of channel time allocation element. PCTA reserves WUSB channel time for Peer to Peer communication between two WUSB devices. The host is responsible for allocating the PCTA but is not involved in the communication within the PCTA time. During the PCTA time one device communicates with another device which is not a host. The method of communication, packet formats and message format exchanged by the devices within the PCTA time are implementation dependant as long as they are compliant to the WiMedia MAC over-the-air packet format. The direction of communication during PCTA time is from the transmitter WUSB device to the receiver WUSB device which is specified in the PCTA sent as part of the CTA IE in the MMC. For the reverse communication, another PCTA needs to be reserved by the receiver WUSB device wherein the direction of communication would be reversed. This is complaint to the channel time allocation provision of the WUSB specification. PCTA are allocated by the host to the devices on request just like other CTAs. The only difference between PCTA and other CTA is the fact that the host is not one of the involved communication partners in the communication during PCTA time.<br>
PCTA format is shown in Figure 3. PCTA have a format similar to the DtCTA and DrCTA in the WUSB specification. Host uses a block type code of 11B, which is a reserved value for a block code, in WUSB specification. Hence PCTA enabled hosts and devices are backward compatible and can co-operate with non PCTA enabled hosts and devices. The field wStart has the same meaning as with other<br><br>
CTA elements; it defines the start time for the PCTA with respect to the beginning of the MMC wherein the PCTA block appears. bDevicelD is the WUSB device ID of the transmitter device within the PCTA time. The remaining format of the PCTA is dependant on the sub type of the PCTA. PCTA can have several sub types, each of which is defined by a one byte subType field in the body of the PCTA. Currently the following sub types are defined:<br>
1.	P2P Sub Type: PCTA of this subtype have the format given in Figure 4. This subtype indicated that the PCTA time has been reserved for communication between two devices in a peer to peer fashion. bDevicelD is the WUSB device id of the transmitter device and bDevicelD2 is the WUSB device id of the receiver device.<br>
2.	Broadcast Sub Type: PCTA of this subtype have the format given in Figure 5. This subtype indicated that the PCTA time has been reserved for sending a broadcast by the device which has reserved the PCTA. bDevicelD is the WUSB device id of the transmitter device. All other devices which are interested in receiving the broadcast are welcome to listen in the PCTA time.<br>
WUSB specification requires dissemination of keys from the host to the devices to enable secure communication. PCTA communication can be secured by dissemination of appropriate keys from the host to both the devices. The devices then use the key given by the host to secure their transmissions over the air.<br>
The proposed system and method allows other sub types to be easily defined.<br><br>
New sub types can be defined for various operations that are considered useful by the implementers. Devices ignore those sub types which they do not recognize as valid. This allows for homogeneous co-existence and co-operation of devices from various vendors. In addition, this allows various vendors to implement specific proprietary improvements to their devices using sub types.<br>
2.  P2P Notifications<br>
Device Notification messages are special messages that are sent by the devices to the host using a contention access mechanism. The proposed method proposed new type of device notifications called P2P Notifications for the device to exchange PCTA related control messages with the host. The device informs the host about the specific type of PCTA required, the parameters of the reservation like the time, frequency, slots, etc. and the destination of the device via a P2P notification. The host may choose to reply to the device notifications using P2P lEs in the MMC. In essence, device notifications are used by the device to request, modify and terminate all types of Peer to Peer requests and reservations. The packet format of the P2P notifications is similar to the device notifications in the WUSB specification.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that many functionalities can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the P2P Notifications method as described above by varying the packet format, types and message sequences. Description of such combinations and variations is omitted but should be considered within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
3.   P2PIE<br>
Figure 6 illustrates the format of a P2P IE which is sent by the host in the MMC.<br>
P2P IE is used by the host to broadcast P2P related information in the MMC. This information includes replies to P2P notifications. By including a P2P IE the host can indicate that it is capable of supporting P2P communication via PCTA. P2P IE also has various sub types which are identified by a one byte field called sub type in the IE. Each sub type identifies one type of P2P message from the host. More sub types can easily be implemented to support more functionality or proprietary improvements. The basic format of the P2P IE is shown in Figure 6. The actual format of the P2P IE is dependant on the sub type parameter. Different sub types are used for putting different types of P2P information (like host capability advertisement, response to PCTA request, etc.) in the IE.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that much functionality can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the P2P IE method as described above by specifying more sub types and related parameters for the IE. Description of such combinations and variations is omitted but should be considered within the scope of the invention.<br>
The subsequent subsections describe the operations to effect the invention:<br><br>
1.	Announcement of P2P support<br>
—	WUSB Hosts that support P2P mechanism periodically include the P2P IE (with appropriate sub type) in the MMC to announce its capability to support P2P reservation.<br>
—	WUSB host that supports P2P mechanism periodically broadcasts information about all the sub types of messages it supports. This information can be a list of sub types or a complaint version number of P2P support.<br>
—	WUSB devices should make sure, by listening for P2P IE in the MMC, that the WUSB host has P2P support before sending P2P Notifications to the host.<br>
2.	PCTA Control<br>
—	PCTA control implies starting, stopping and modifying PCTA.<br>
—	PCTA can only be allocated by the Host and hence the devices should communicate all PCTA control messages with the host only.<br>
—	WUSB devices should use P2P Notifications for PCTA control messages.<br>
—	WUSB source device should specify the parameters for the PCTA reservation including the requirement for secure communication. In case secure communication is required, the host will disseminate keys to both the parties involved in the P2P communication in a particular PCTA.<br><br>
3.  Peer to Peer Communication<br>
—	All    direct Peer to Peer communication between WUSB devices takes place only in PCTA<br>
—	Each PCTA is unidirectional and communication should be directed from the transmitter to the receiver.<br>
—	For bi-directional communication, two PCTAs should be reserved.<br>
—	Security can also be provisioned in PCTA by using implementation specific mechanisms during the PCTA time.<br>
Using the embodiments of the invention, it is possible for WUSB devices to communicate with other WUSB devices in a Peer to Peer fashion.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>

WE CLAIM<br>
1.	A method for enabling WUSB peer to peer communication involving a WUSB<br>
device and a WUSB host comprising:<br>
(a)	announcing the P2P support by the WUSB host; and<br>
(b)	performing PCTA Control between the said host before performing Peer to Peer Communication.<br>
2.	A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein announcing the P2P support by the<br>
WUSB host comprise the steps of:<br>
(a)	periodically including the P2P IE in the MMC to announce its capability to support P2P reservation by the WUSB Hosts that support P2P mechanism;<br>
(b)	periodically broadcasting information about all the sub types of messages supported by the WUSB host that supports P2P mechanism where the information is a list of sub types or a complaint version number of P2P support; and<br>
(c)	listening for P2P IE in the MMC by WUSB and confirming that the WUSB host has P2P support before sending P2P Notifications to the host.<br>
3.	A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein performing PCTA Control comprise<br>
the step of:<br>
(a)	starting, stopping and modifying PCTA;<br>
(b)	allocating PCTA by the Host and hence communicating all PCTA control messages with the host;<br><br>
(c)	using P2P Notifications for PCTA control messages by the WUSB device;<br>
(d)	specifying the parameters for the PCTA reservation including the requirement for secure communication by the WUSB source device ; and<br>
(e)	disseminating keys by the host to both the parties involved in the P2P communication in a particular PCTA in case of secure communication.<br><br>
4.	A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein direct Peer to Peer communication between WUSB devices takes place in PCTA.<br>
5.	A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein if PCTA is unidirectional, communication is directed from the transmitter to the receiver and if bi-directiona, two PCTAs are reserved.<br>
6.	A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein PCTA reserves WUSB channel time for Peer to Peer communication between two WUSB devices and the direction of communication during PCTA time is from a transmitter WUSB device to a receiver WUSB device which is specified in the PCTA sent as part of the CTA EintheMMC.<br>
7.	A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein for the reverse communication, a separate PCTA is reserved by the receiver WUSB device wherein the direction of communication is reversed.<br><br>
8.	A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein P2P Notifications enables the device to exchange PCTA related control messages with the host where the device informs the host about the specific type of PCTA required, the parameters of the reservation and the destination of the device.<br>
9.	A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein P2P IE is used by the host to broadcast P2P related information in the MMC where the information includes replies to P2P notifications.<br>
10.	A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein P2P IE includes various sub types which are identified by a one byte field called sub type in the IE where each sub type identifies one type of P2P message from the host.<br>
11.	A system for enabling WUSB peer to peer communication involving a WUSB device and a WUSB host comprising:<br><br>
(a)	means for announcing the P2P support by the WUSB host; and<br>
(b)	means for performing PCTA Control between the said host before performing Peer to Peer Communication.<br>
12.	A method for enabling WUSB peer to peer communication involving a WUSB<br>
device and a WUSB host substantially described particularly with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
13. A system for enabling WUSB peer to peer communication involving a WUSB device and a WUSB host substantially described particularly with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
