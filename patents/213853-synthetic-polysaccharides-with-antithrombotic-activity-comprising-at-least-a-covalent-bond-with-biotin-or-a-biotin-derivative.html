COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10; Rule 13]<br>
"SYNTHETIC POLYSACCHARIDES WITH ANTITHROMBOTIC<br>
ACTIVITY COMPRISING AT LEAST A COVALENT BOND WITH<br>
BIOTIN OR A BIOTIN DERIVATIVE"<br>
AKZO NOBEL N.V. a French societe anonyme, having its Reg office at Velperweg 76,6824 BM in Arnhem ,<br>
The Netherlands<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to novel synthetic oligo- and polysaccharides exhibiting at least one covalent bond with biotin or a biotin derivative and having the anticoagulant and antithrombotic pharmacological activities of heparin.<br>
Heparin catalyses, in particular via antithrombin III (AT III), the inhibition of two enzymes which are involved in the blood coagulation cascade, namely factor Xa and factor Ila (or thrombin). Preparations comprising low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) comprise chains formed of 4 to 30 monosaccharides and have the property of acting more selectively with respect to factor Xa than with respect to thrombin.<br>
It is known that the inhibition of factor Xa requires attachment of heparin to AT III via  the antithrombin-binding domain (Domain-A) and that inhibition of factor Ila (thrombin) requires attachment to AT III, via  the Domain-A, and to thrombin via  a less well defined binding domain (Domain-T).<br>
Synthetic oligosaccharides corresponding to the Domain-A domain of heparin are known. They are disclosed, for example, in Patents EP 84 999 and EP 529 715, the patent application published under the<br><br>
number WO 99/36428 and the publication Bioorg.   Med. Chem.,   1998, 6,   1509-1516. These synthetic oligosaccharides have the property of selectively inhibiting, via  antithrombin III, factor Xa of the 5  coagulation without any activity with respect to<br>
thrombin. They display an antithrombotic activity in venous thrombosis.<br>
Synthetic oligosaccharides capable of inhibiting thrombin and factor Xa via  activation of 10 AT III have been disclosed in the patent applications published under the numbers WO 98/03554 and WO 99/36443.<br>
Novel biologically active sulphated and alkylated polysaccharide derivatives are disclosed in 15  these patent applications. They are in particular anticoagulants and antithrombotics. It has in particular been shown that these sulphated and alkylated polysaccharides can be powerful antithrombotics and anticoagulants depending upon the 2 0 arrangement of the alkyl groups and sulphate groups<br>
carried by the glucide backbone. More generally, it has been found that, by preparing polysaccharide sequences, it is possible to precisely adjust the activities of GAGs type in order to obtain very active products 25 exhibiting the anticoagulant and antithrombotic<br>
pharmacological properties of heparin. In comparison with heparin, they exhibit the advantage of having a specific structure and of not reacting with platelet<br><br>
factor 4, the cause of the thrombocytopenic effects of heparin.<br>
However, the use in human therapeutics of some products disclosed in the patent applications 5 published under the numbers WO 98/03554 and WO 99/36443 and in Patent EP 529 715 can prove to be problematic, in particular if these products have a long half-life. In the field of the prevention or treatment of thrombosis with the above products, the fluidity of the 10 blood has to be reestablished or maintained while preventing a haemorrhage from being brought about. This is because it is well known that a haemorrhage can be triggered in a patient under treatment for any accidental cause. It may also be 15 necessary to intervene surgically in a patient under antithrombotic treatment. Furthermore, during some surgical procedures, anticoagulants may be used at a high dose so as to prevent blood coagulation and it is necessary to neutralize them at the end of the 20 operation. It is therefore advantageous to have<br>
antithrombotic agents which can be neutralized in order to stop the anticoagulant activity at any time. In point of fact, the known synthetic oligosaccharides described above cannot be easily neutralized by the 25 known antidotes for heparin or LMWHs, including protamine sulphate.<br>
The present invention relates to novel synthetic; polysaccharides with a structure similar to<br><br>
that of the compounds disclosed in the patent applications published under the numbers WO 98/03554 and WO 99/36443 and in Patent EP52_9 715: the structures of the synthetic oligosaccharides which are 5 a subject-matter of the invention are modified in the sense that they exhibit a covalent bond with biotin (hexahydro-2-oxo-2H~thieno[3,4-d]imidazole-4-pentanoic acid) or with a biotin derivative. Surprisingly, it appears that the introduction of biotin or a biotin 10 derivative $oes not! modify the pharmacological activity df the polysaccharides. In fact, the novel polysaccharides which are a subject-matter of the invention have an antithrombotic activity comparable with that of the oligosaccharides of the prior art. 15 However, they additionally have the advantage of being able to be rapidly neutralized by a specific antidote in an emergency situation. This specific antidote is avidin (The Merck Index, Twelfth edition, 1996, M.N. 920, pages 151-152) or streptavidin, two tetrameric 20 proteins with respective masses equal to approximately 66 000 and 60 000 Da which have a very high affinity for biotin.<br>
Generally, the invention relates to synthetic polysaccharides with antithrombotic activity having at 25  least one covalent bond with biotin or a biotin derivative.<br>
Mention may be made, as biotin derivative, of the biotin derivatives shown in the Pierce catalogue,<br><br>
1999-2000, pages 62 to 81, for example 6-biotinamidohexanoate,<br><br>
or 6-(6-biotinamidohexanamido)hexanoate,<br>
5 <br>
or 2-biotinamidoethanethiol<br><br>
or the compounds of the following formulae:<br><br><br><br><br>

The compounds of the above formula (I) also comprise those in which one or more hydrogen or carbon atoms have been replaced by their radioactive isotope, 15  for example tritium or carbon-14. Such labelled compounds are of use in research, metabolic or pharmacokinetic studies and in biochemical assays, as ligands.<br>
The principle of the process for the 20 preparation of the compounds according to the invention involves the use of di- or oligosaccharide base synthons prepared as reported above in the literature. Reference will in particular be made to Patents or Patent Applications EP 300 099, EP 529 715, EP 621 282 25 and EP 649 854 and to the documents C. van Boeckel, M. Petitou, Angew.   Chem.   Int.   Ed.   Engl.,   1993, 32, 1671-1690. These synthons are subsequently coupled to one another so as to provide a fully protected<br><br>
equivalent of a polysaccharide according to the<br>
invention. This protected equivalent is subsequently<br>
converted into a compound according to the invention.<br>
One of the base synthons mentioned above<br>
5 comprises a specific protected functional group making<br>
possible the subsequent introduction of biotin or a<br>
biotin derivative, for example a latent amine<br>
functional group in the form of the azido group or<br>
protected in the form of the N-phthalimido group.<br>
10	In the coupling reactions mentioned above, a<br>
"donor" di- or oligosaccharide, activated on its anomeric carbon, reacts with an "acceptor" di- or oligosaccharide having a free hydroxyl.<br>
The present invention relates to a process 15  for the preparation of the compounds of formula (I), characterized in that: in a first stage, a fully protected equivalent of the desired polysaccharide (I), comprising a protected precursor of the Pe domain extended at its nonreducing end by a protected 20 precursor of the sulphated polysaccharide Po, is synthesized, one of these precursors comprises in particular a suitably protected amine functional group for the subsequent introduction of biotin or a biotin derivative; in a second stage, the negatively charged 25 groups are introduced and/or unmasked; in a third<br>
stage, the amine functional group is deprotected and then biotin or the biotin derivative is introduced.<br>
The synthesis of Pe is carried out according<br><br>
to the methods described in particular in the patent applications published under the numbers WO 98/03554 and WO 99/36443 and in the literature (cited above). The polysaccharide part which is the 5 precursor of Po is synthesized according to reactions well known to a person skilled in the art using the methods for the synthesis of oligosaccharides (G.J. Boons, Tetrahedron,   1996, 52, 1095-1121, WO 98/03554 and WO 99/36443) or an oligosaccharide when 10 an oligosaccharide which is a glycoside bond donor is coupled with an oligosaccharide which is a glycoside bond acceptor to result in another oligosaccharide, the size of which is equal to the sum of the sizes of the two reactive species. This sequence is repeated until 15  the desired compound of formula (I) is obtained. The nature and the profile of the charge of the final compound desired determine the nature of the chemical entities used in the various stages of the synthesis, according to rules well known to a person skilled in 20  the art. Reference may be made, for example, to<br>
C. van Boeckel and M. Petitou, Angew.   Chem.   Int.   Ed. Engl.,   1993,   32,   1671-1690, or to H. Paulsen, "Advances in selective chemical syntheses of complex oligosaccharides", Angew.   Chem.   Int.   Ed.   Engl.,   21, 25  155-173 (1982).<br>
The compounds of the invention are obtained from their fully protected polysaccharide precursors by using the following series of reactions:<br><br>
the alcohol functional groups which have to be converted into an O-sulpho group and the carboxylic acids are deprotected by removing the protective groups used during the preparation of 5      the backbone, then,<br>
the sulpho groups are subsequently introduced, the amine functional group which makes possible the introduction of biotin or the biotin derivative is deprotected, 10  -   biotin or the biotin derivative is introduced by a conventional amino/acid coupling reaction.<br>
The compounds of the invention can naturally be prepared by using various strategies known to a person skilled in the art for the synthesis of 15 oligosaccharides.<br>
The process described above is the preferred process of the invention. However, the compounds of formula (I) can be prepared by other methods well known in the chemistry of sugars, described, for example, in 20 Monosaccharides, their chemistry and their roles in natural products, P.M. Collins and R.J. Ferrier, J. Wiley &amp; Sons, 1995, and in G.J. Boons, Tetrahedron, 1996, 52,   1095-1121.-<br>
The pentasaccharides Pe can thus be obtained 25  from disaccharide synthons in the way described in the publication by C. van Boeckel and M. Petitou, Angew. Chem.   Int.   Ed.   Engl.,   1993, 32,   1671-1690.<br>
The protective groups used in the process for<br><br>
the preparation of the compounds (I) are those commonly<br>
used in the chemistry of sugars, for example in<br>
Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, T.W. Greene,<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1981.<br>
5	The protective groups are advantageously<br>
chosen, for example, from the acetyl, halomethyl, benzoyl, levulinyl, benzyl, substituted benzyl, optionally substituted trityl, tetrahydropyranyl, allyl, pentenyl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl (tBDMS) or 10  trimethylsilylethyl groups.<br>
The activating groups are those conventionally used in the chemistry of sugars according to, for example, G.J. Boons, Tetrahedron, 1996, 52,   1095-1121. These activating groups are 15 chosen, for example, from imidates, thioglycosides, pentenylglycosides, xanthates, phosphites or halides.<br>
As regards the way in which biotin is bonded to the oligosaccharide and the nature of the biotin derivative, the chemical literature offers other 20 possibilities which can be made use of by sets of<br>
protective groups well known to a person skilled in the art. Use will preferably be made of an amine functional group, or a thiol functional group, or a carboxylic acid functional group, or an aldehyde functional group, 25 which will be reacted with a biotin derivative<br>
comprising a reactive group of the activated ester, maleimide, iodoacetyl or primary amine type, the reaction taking place according to the conditions<br><br>
described in the literature (cf. Savage et al. , Avidin-Biotin Chemistry:   A Handbook;   Pierce Chemical Company, 1992) .<br>
The process described above makes it possible 5 to obtain the compounds of the invention in the form of salts. To obtain the corresponding acids, the compounds of the invention in the form of salts are brought into contact with a cation-exchange resin in the acid form. The compounds of the invention in the form of 10 acids can subsequently be neutralized with a base to obtain the desired salt. Any inorganic or organic base which gives pharmaceutically acceptable salts with the compounds of formula (I) can be used for the preparation of the salts of the compounds of formula 15  (I). Sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium<br>
hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide is preferably used as base. The sodium and calcium salts of the compounds of formula (I) are the preferred salts.<br>
The compounds according to the invention have 20 formed the subject of biochemical and pharmacological studies.<br>
The overall antithrombotic activity of these products and their neutralization has been studied in a venous thrombosis model composed of an injection of 25  tissue factor, followed by a stasis of the vena cava of rats, as described by J.-M. Herbert et al.,   Blood, 1998, 91,   4197-4205. In this model, inhibition of 60% of the thrombosis is obtained after intravenous<br><br>
injection of 0.1 to 30 mmol/kg of the compounds. The injection of avidin in a molar ratio of 1 to 1 000 greatly reduces the antithrombotic effect of these compounds, it being possible for the reduction obtained 5  to be greater than 50%. In the same way, the prohaemorrhagic activity of the compounds is neutralized by injection of avidin at the abovementioned doses. Likewise, the circulating activity of the oligosaccharides, measured by the anti-10 Xa activity and/or the anti-IIa activity, is neutralized by injection of avidin.<br>
Thus, another subject-matter of the present invention is a process employing avidin or streptavidin, characterized in that it makes it 15 possible to neutralize the polysaccharides according to the invention. Avidin or streptavidin can be used for the preparation of medicaments intended to neutralize the polysaccharides according to the present invention. By virtue of their biochemical and 20 pharmaceutical activity, the oligosaccharides of the present invention constitute highly advantageous medicaments. Their toxicity is entirely compatible with this use. They are also very stable and are thus particularly suitable for constituting the active 25 principle of patented pharmaceutical products.<br>
They can be used in various pathologies resulting from a modification of the homeostasis of the coagulation system appearing in particular during<br><br>
disorders of the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular system, such as thromboembolic disorders associated with atherosclerosis and diabetes, for example unstable angina, apoplexy, postangioplasty restenosis, 5 endarterectomy or the insertion of endovascular<br>
prostheses; or thromboembolic disorders associated with post-thrombolysis rethrombosis, with infarction, with dementia of ischaemic origin, with peripheral arterial diseases, with haemodialysis or with auricular 10 fibrillations, or during the use of vascular prostheses for aortocoronary bypasses. Furthermore, these products can be used for the treatment or prevention of thrombo¬embolic pathologies of venous origin, such as pulmonary embolisms. They can be used or to prevent or treat the 15  thrombotic complications observed, for example,<br>
following surgical operations, the growth of tumours or disturbances to coagulation induced by bacterial, viral or enzymatic activators. In the case of their use during the insertion of prostheses, the compounds of 20 the present invention can cover prostheses and thus<br>
render them haemocompatible. In particular, they can be attached to intravascular prostheses (stents). In this case, they can optionally be modified chemically by introduction at the nonreducing or reducing end of an 25 appropriate arm, as disclosed according to EP 649 854. The compounds of the present invention can also be used as adjuvants during endarterectomy carried out with porous balloons.<br><br>
The compounds according to the invention can be used in the preparation of medicaments intended for the treatment of the above diseases.<br>
According to another of its aspects, a 5  subject-matter of the present invention is thus a pharmaceutical composition comprising, as active principle, a synthetic polysaccharide according to the invention or one of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, optionally in combination with one or more inert 10 and appropriate excipients.<br>
The said excipients are chosen according to the desired pharmaceutical form and the desired administration method: oral, sublingual, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, transdermal, transmucosal, 15  local or rectal.<br>
The active principle can also be presented in<br>
the form of a complex with a cyclodextrin, for example<br>
a-, 3- or y-cyclodextrin, 2-hydroxypropyl-p-cyclodextrin<br>
or methyl-P-cyclodextrin.<br>
20	The active principle can also be released by<br>
a balloon comprising it or by an endovascular expander<br>
introduced into the blood vessels. The pharmacological<br>
effectiveness of the active principle is thus<br>
unaffected.<br>
25	In each dosage unit, the active principle is<br>
present in the amounts suited to the daily doses envisaged in order to obtain the desired prophylactic or therapeutic effect. Each dosage unit can comprise<br><br>
from 0.1 to 100 mg of active principle, preferably 0.5 to 50 mg. These doses of anticoagulant compounds might be neutralized by doses of avidin or streptavidin ranging from 1 to 1 000 mg by iv   (intravenous) 5 injection, bolus or infusion.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can also be used in combination with one or more other active principles of use in the desired therapy, such as, for example, antithrombotics, anticoagulants, 10 platelet aggregation inhibitors, such as, for example, dipyridamole, aspirin, ticlopidine or clopidogrel, or glycoprotein Ilb/IIIa complex antagonists.<br>
