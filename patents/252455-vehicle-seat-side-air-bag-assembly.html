VEHICLE SEAT SIDE AIR BAG ASSEMBLY BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a vehicle seat side air bag assembly having an air bag guide for guiding an air bag for deployment during use.<br>
2,	Background Art<br>
Vehicle seat components have previously included side air bag modules and conventionally include trim covers that have an air bag release seam through which an air bag upon deployment is projected outwardly from within the seat to provide occupant protection. See, for example, United States Patents 5,816,610 Higashiura et al.; 5,860,673 Hasegawa et al.; and 5,938,232 Kalandek et al. Different constructions have been utilized to permit passage of the air bag past foam seat padding when inflated by an inflator for movement from within the seat component outwardly through the trim cover release seam. For example. United States Patent 6,045,151 Wu discloses a seat pad having a slot through which the air bag moves from an air bag module to the release seam and also discloses a cloth sleeve that extends entirely about the associated air bag module and to the release seam. Also, United States Patents 6,237,934 Harrell et al and 6,588,838 Dick, Jr. et al., both of which are assigned to the assignee of the present invention, disclose air bag modules wherein the air bag module is located closely adjacent to the release seam to facilitate the air bag deployment.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
With reference to Figure 1 of the drawings, a vehicle seat generally indicated by 10 includes a seat bottom 12 for mounting on a vehicle floor and a seat back 14 mounted in a generally upstanding manner on the seat bottom with its angular position controlled in a conventional manner by a recliner generally indicated by 16. The seat back component 14 includes a side air bag assembly 17 that is constructed in accordance with the present invention and includes a side air bag module 18 operable to provide seat occupant protection as is hereinafter more fully described. While the side air bag module 18 is shown on the seat back 14, which is a usage for which it has particular utility, it is also possible for the side air bag module to be utilized with a seat bottom 12 even though the seat back usage is specifically disclosed. Also, as illustrated, the side air bag module 18 is located at an outboard lateral side or extremity of the seat to provide protection against adjacent vehicle structure, but it is also possible to have the side air bag module located at the inboard lateral side to provide protection against an adjacent vehicle occupant and to also have side air bag modules at both outboard and inboard locations for protection in both lateral directions. As shown in Figure 2, the seat back 14 includes a back panel 20 that is conventionally molded from plastic and also<br><br>
includes a front cushion 22 against which the seat occupant leans to provide back support and in which the side air bag module 18 is located.<br>
As illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5, the seat back component 14 includes a frame collectively identified by 24 and having a pair of frame members 26 (only one shown) at its opposite lateral sides. A foam seat pad 28 (Figures 4 and 5) is mounted on the frame 24 in any conventional manner and has opposite side extremities 30 (only one shown) spaced laterally from each other at the opposite lateral sides of the seat. A trim cover generally indicated by 32 extends over the seat pad 28 and includes an air bag deployment or release seam 34 adjacent the shown side extremity 30 of the seat pad which corresponds to an outboard location. The deployment seam 34 includes stitching 35 of trim cover portions to each other.<br>
The side air bag module 18 is located within the trim cover 32 mounted on the frame 24, specifically by a threaded connection 36 on the one side frame member 26 adjacent the air bag release seam 34 but in a spaced relationship from the release seam. The air bag module 18 includes an inflator 38 and a schematically illustrated air bag 40 which may be folded or rolled and, upon deployment, the air bag is inflated by the inflator and projected outwardly from the seat component through the air bag deployment seam 34 of the trim cover 32.<br>
The trim cover 32 may be made of cloth, vinyl or leather, etc. In some embodiments, the trim cover 32 within the back panel 20 includes an extension secured thereto by stitching and/or adhesive, etc. for securement to the seat component structure in any suitable manner. Such trim cover extensions can be made of any sufficiently strong and flexible material and can reduce the total cost of the trim cover without losing any aesthetic appeal since the back panel 20 hides the trim cover extension.<br>
As shown in Figures 3-5, the side air bag assembly 17 includes an air bag guide 42 which is made of a synthetic plastic and has an inner end 44 that is secured to the seat frame 24 at its side frame member 26 as is hereinafter more fully described. The air bag guide 42 also includes a tubular portion 46 that extends from<br><br>
its inner end 44 adjacent the air bag module toward the trim co\'er 32 at its deployment seam 34. The tubular portion 46 of the air bag guide 42 has an unsecured outer open end 48 adjacent the deployment seam 34 of the trim cover 32 to guide the air bag 40 upon its inflation to the trim cover deployment seam. In the embodiment of Figure 4, the foam seat pad 30 surrounds the seat frame member 26 and the air bag module 18 and the air bag guide 40 and has a slit 50 that extends from the open end 48 of the air bag guide tubular portion 46 to the deployment seam 34, In the embodiment of Figure 5, the foam seat pad 28 is located on the inboard and rear side of the air bag module 18 and the air bag guide 42, and the trim cover 32 is located on the outboard side of the air bag guide 42. In both embodiments and the other disclosed embodiments of the air bag guide 42, the tubular construction of the tubular portion 46 is maintained throughout the air bag deployment.<br>
The air bag guide 42 is made of a thermoplastic elastomer and may be a thermoplastic olefmic elastomer, a thermoplastic vulcanized elastomer or a styrene olefin.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 3, the air bag guide 42 is fabricated from a plastic sheet 52. This plastic sheet is folded adjacent the inner end 44 of the air bag guide to provide panels 54 as shov^n in Figures 4 and 5, and the panels 54 as shov^n in Figure 3 have connections 56 that secure the panels to each other to provide the tubular portion 46 extending from the air bag module to the outer open end 48. These connections 56 may be made by stitching, heat bonding, adhesive or in any other suitable way for maintaining the panel securement throughout the air bag deployment.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, the plastic sheet 52 may also have tabs 58 that are folded over at the connections 56 to provide strengthening of the securement of the panels to each other throughout the air bag deployment.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 7, the air bag guide 42 for high production can be economically molded to provide the previously described inner end 46 shown in Figure 3 and the tubular portion 46 shown in Figure 7.   This molding can be<br><br>
perforned by either injection molding or blow molding and the junctions 60 of the molded panels 54 of the tubular portion 46 may have thickened portions, rib, etc. to provide strengthening of the securement of the panels to each other throughout the air bag deployment.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 8, it is also possible for the air bag guide 42 to be molded as two components 42c that are secured to each other by the connections 56 of the tubular portion 42 and in a suitable way at the inner end of the air bag guide. These molded portions 42c may have a thickened construction, ribs etc. at the connections 56 of the tubular portion and at a suitable connection of the inner end of the air bag guide.<br>
In each embodiment illustrated in Figures 4-7, the inner end 44 of the air bag guide as specifically shown in Figures 4 and 5 receives the air bag module 18 with the threaded connection 36 extending through a suitable hole in one of the sides of the air bag guide to provide a clamping securement of the inner end to the seat frame member 26. Also, as shown in Figure 3, the inner end 44 of the air bag guide 42 includes an opening 62 through which at least one control wire 64 extends to the air bag module 18 to control its deployment.<br>
While embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it is not intended that these embodiments illustrate and describe all possible forms of the invention. Rather, the words used in the specification are words of description rather than limitation, and it is understood that various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
