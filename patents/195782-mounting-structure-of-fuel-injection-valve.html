BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a fuel injection apparatus which injects and supplies a fuel having an increased pressure by a fuel pump and stored within a fuel tank into a throttle body or an intake pipe connected to an engine via a fuel injection valve, and more particularly to a mounting structure of the fuel injection valve to the throttle body or the intake pipe. DESCRIPTION OF CONVENTIONAL ART A first embodiment of a conventional mounting structure of a fuel injection valve is shown in Fig. 2. In this case, in the description, upper, lower, left and right are defined in view of the drawings, and are used for making the description easy.<br>
A fuel injection valve J is structured such that a collar portion 50 and a seal ring shaft portion 51 connected to the collar portion 50 are continuously provided in a side of a leading end JA thereof to which an injection hole (not shown) is open so as to be directed to the left, and an O-ring groove 53 is provided in an O-ring shaft portion 52 provided in a side of a rear end JB.<br>
1A<br><br>
Further, a fuel injection valve insertion boss portion 57 is provided in an outer periphery of a throttle body 56 in which an intake passage 54 passes through an inner portion and the intake passage is opened and closed by a throttle valve 55, a seal ring insertion hole 58 is provided from a right end surface 57A toward an inner side of the intake passage 54, and an engagement step portion 58A in a side of a leading end of the seal ring insertion hole 58 is communicated with the intake passage 54 via a communication passage 59 having a diameter smaller than that of the seal ring insertion hole 58 .<br>
Reference numeral 60 denotes a fuel supply pipe in which a fuel supply passage 61 is pierced in an inner portion thereof. An O-ring insertion hole 62 is provided from a left end surface 60A thereof toward the fuel supply passage 61.<br>
The fuel supply passage 61 is communicated with a discharge passage of a fuel pump (not shown), and a fuel having a pressure increased by the fuel pump and stored within the fuel tank is supplied thereto.<br>
In this case, reference symbol 60B denotes a mounting collar portion extending from the fuel supply passage 61 to a side portion. A screw insertion hole 60C is pierced in the collar portion so as to extend through toward a left end surface 60B.<br>
2<br><br>
Then, the fuel injection valve J is mounted to the throttle body 56 in the following manner.<br>
First, a seal ring 63 formed in a rectangular ring shape and made of an elastic material is arranged in a compression state so as to face to the outer periphery of the seal ring shaft portion 51 in the side of the leading end JA of the fuel injection valve J and the left end surface 50A of the collar portion 50, and an O-ring 64 is arranged in a compression state within the O-ring groove 53 at the rear end JB of the fuel injection valve J. Further, a cushion ring 65 made of an elastic material and formed in a cylindrical shape is arranged in the outer periphery of the O-ring shaft portion 52, and a left end 65A of this cushion ring 65 is arranged so as to be brought into contact with a step portion JC provided in a side of the rear end JB of the fuel injection valve J.<br>
In such a state, the leading end JA of the fuel injection valve J is inserted into the seal ring insertion hole 58 of the throttle body 56 and the communication hole 59, and next, the O-ring insertion hole 62 of the fuel supply pipe 60 is arranged so that the rear end JB of the fuel injection valve J is inserted therein. Then, the left end surface 60A of the fuel supply pipe 60 is arranged on the engagement end surface 5 6A of the throttle body 56 so as to be brought into<br>
3<br><br>
contact therewith, a screw 66 is inserted into a screw insertion hole 60C under the state mentioned above, and the fuel supply pipe 60 is screwed and fixed to the throttle body 56 by the screw 66.<br>
In accordance with the structure mentioned above, the cushion ring 65 is compressed between the left end surface 60A of the fuel supply pipe 60 and the step portion JC of the fuel injection valve J in a longitudinal axial direction X-X of the fuel injection valve J, and a compression force of the cushion ring 65 presses the engagement step portion 58A of the throttle body 56 via the step portion JC of the fuel injection valve J and the seal ring 63 through the collar portion 50. Accordingly, the fuel injection valve J is positioned and fixed in the longitudinal axial direction X-X. In this case, air tightness of the fuel injection valve J at the leading end JA is achieved by an elastic deformation of the seal ring 63, and air tightness of the fuel injection valve J at the rear end JB is achieved by the O-ring 64.<br>
A second embodiment of the conventional mounting structure of the fuel injection valve is shown in Fig. 3.<br>
In this case, the same reference numerals are attached to the same structure portions as those in Fig. 2 .<br>
4 <br><br>
The fuel injection valve J is structured such that a first O-ring groove 70 is provided in the leading end JA thereof, and a second O-ring groove 71 is provided in the rear end JB.<br>
Further, an O-ring insertion hole 71 is provided from the right end surface 57A of the fuel injection valve insertion boss portion 57 provided in the throttle body 56 toward an inner side of the intake passage 54, and this O-ring insertion hole 71 is communicated with an inner side of the intake passage 54 via a through hole 72 so as to be open.<br>
Reference numeral 73 denotes a fuel supply pipe in which a fuel supply passage 74 is provided in an inner portion. A cylindrical supporting member 75 provided with an O-ring insertion hole 75A is firmly attached to the fuel supply pipe 73.<br>
Further, a first O-ring 76 is arranged in the first O-ring groove 70, and a second O-ring 77 is arranged in the second O-ring groove 7 1.<br>
Further, the leading end JA of the fuel injection valve J is arranged so as to be inserted into the O-ring insertion hole 71 of the fuel injection valve insertion boss portion 57, the rear end JB of the fuel injection valve J is arranged so as to be inserted into the O-ring insertion hole 75A of the supporting member 75, and an annular engagement groove JD provided in the rear<br>
5<br><br>
end JB of the fuel injection valve J and the supporting member 75 are engaged by a clip 78.<br>
Further, the fuel supply pipe 73 in which the rear end JB of the fuel injection valve J is attached in accordance with the above manner is screwed and fixed to the throttle body 56 via a supply pipe supporting member 79 by the screw 66.<br>
In accordance with the structure mentioned above, air tightness at the leading end JA of the fuel injection valve J is held by the first O-ring 76, air tightness at the rear end JB of the fuel injection valve J is held by the second O-ring 77, and a movement in the longitudinal axial direction X-X of the fuel injection valve J is inhibited by the clip 78.<br>
In accordance with the first embodiment of the conventional mounting structure of the fuel injection valve mentioned above, it is necessary to apply a compression force along the longitudinal axial direction X-X of the fuel injection valve J to the cushion ring 65, and accordingly it is necessary to collapse and deform the cushion ring 65 along the longitudinal axial direction X-X.<br>
In accordance with the structure mentioned above, a direction of fastening the screw 66 for screwing the fuel supply pipe 60 with the throttle body 56 is limited to a position along the longitudinal axial direction<br>
6<br><br>
X-X of the fuel injection valve J, a freedom for mounting the fuel supply pipe 60 is low, and a great problem is generated particularly at a time when the fuel injection valve is used in a motor cycle.<br>
Further, in accordance with the second embodiment in the conventional mounting structure of the fuel injection valve, a freedom of fastening direction for the screw 6 6 is increased, however, the clip 78 for inhibiting the fuel injection valve J from moving in the longitudinal axial direction is required, so that a number of the parts and a number of assembling man-hour are increased, and this structure is not preferable.<br>

16<br><br>
In this case, reference numeral 25 denotes a mounting arm portion extending to a side portion from the fuel supply pipe 20. Amounting hole 25A is pierced in this mounting arm portion 25.<br>
The mounting hole 25A in the present embodiment is pierced in a direction orthogonal to a longitudinal axial direction X-X of the fuel injection valve J.<br>
Next, a description will be given of a mounting of the fuel injection valve to the throttle body in accordance with the present invention.<br>
First, the first seal ring 4 is attached to the first supporting shaft portion 5 in a side of the leading end JA of the fuel injection valve J, and the second seal ring 9 is attached to the second supporting shaft portion 10 in a side of the rear end JB of the fuel injection valve J.<br>
In accordance with this structure, the inner diameter portion 4A of the first seal ring 4 is arranged in the first supporting shaft portion 5 in a compression state, and the inner diameter portion 9A of the second seal ring 9 is arranged in the second supporting shaft portion 10 in a compression state.<br>
Next, the fuel supply pipe 20 is arranged in the rear end JB of the fuel injection valve J, the second rear end side shaft portion 11 at the rear end JB of the fuel injection valve J is arranged so as to be<br>
17<br><br>
inserted into the second small diameter hole 23, and the second leading end side shaft portion 12 including the second seal ring 9 is arranged so as to be inserted into the second large diameter supporting hole 22.<br>
Next, the leading end JA of the fuel injection valve J in which the fuel injection supply pipe 20 is arranged in the rear end JB is arranged in the throttle body 1, the first leading end side shaft portion 6 provided in the leading end JA is inserted into the first small diameter hole 15, and the first rear end side shaft portion 7 provided with the first seal ring 4 is arranged so as to be inserted into the first large diameter supporting hole 14.<br>
Further, in such a state, the fuel supply pipe 20 is screwed and fixed to the throttle body 1 via the mounting hole 25A pierced in the mounting flange portion 25 of the fuel supply pipe 20 by the screw 66.<br>
In accordance with the mounting structure in the fuel injection valve in accordance with the present invention having the structure mentioned above, air tightness of the fuel injection valve J at the side of the leading end JA is achieved by the following<br>
manner .<br>
The first seal ring 4 is arranged between the	first<br>
supporting shaft portion 5 of the fuel injection	valve<br>
J and the first large diameter supporting hole	14 of<br>
18<br><br>
the throttle body 1 in the compression state, the inner diameter portion 4A of the first seal ring 4 is supported to the first supporting shaft portion 5 in the compression manner, and the outer diameter portion 4B of the first seal ring 4 is supported to the first large diameter supporting hole 14 in the compression manner. Accordingly, it is possible to hold the air tightness between the inner side of the intake passage 2 of the throttle body 1 and the atmospheric air.<br>
Further, the air tightness at the side of the rear end 7B of the fuel injection valve J is achieved by the following manner.<br>
The second seal ring 9 is arranged between the second supporting shaft portion 10 of the fuel injection valve J and the second large diameter supporting hole 22 of the fuel supply pipe 20 in the compression state, the inner diameter portion 9A of the second seal ring<br>
9	is supported to the second supporting shaft portion<br>
10	in the compression manner, and the outer diameter<br>
portion 9B of the second seal ring 9 is supported to<br>
the second large diameter supporting portion 22 in the<br>
compression manner, whereby it is possible to hold the<br>
air tightness between the fuel supply passage 21 and<br>
the atmospheric air.<br>
On the other hand, the fuel supply pipe 20 is screwed and fixed to the throttle body 1 via the screw<br>
19<br><br>
66<br>
In such a state, when the fuel, pressures of which is increased to a predetermined pressure (for example, 250 kpa to 300 kpa) within the fuel supply passage 21, is supplied to the fuel injection valve J, the rear end surface JC of the fuel injection valve J receives the fuel pressure, and the fuel injection valve J is pressed toward the side of the leading end JA in the longitudinal axial direction X-X.<br>
In accordance with this structure, the first targe diameter engagement step portion 8 of the fuel injection valve J presses the first seal ring 4 toward the leading end direction of the longitudinal axial direction X-X. In this structure, the first seal ring 4 is brought into contact with the third engagement step portion 16 of the throttle body 1, whereby the movement mentioned above stops in a state in which the first seal ring 4 is compressed slightly.,<br>
At this time, there is a case that the second seal ring 9 arranged in the side of the rear end JB of the fuel injection valve j is apart from the fourth engagement step portion 24 of the fuel supply pipe 20; however, since the inner dimeter portion 9A and the outer diameter portion 98 of the second seal ring 9 are held in the compression state to the second supporting shaft portion 10 and the second large<br>
20<br><br>
diameter supporting hole 22, the fuel within the fuel supply passage 21 does not leak out to the atmospheric , air .<br>
Further, during the operation of the engine, a positive pressure acts on the leading end surface JD of the fuel injection valve J due to a pulsation pressure generated within the intake passage 2, a blow back of the engine and the like, and the fuel injection valve J is pressed toward the side of the rear end JB in the longitudinal axial direction X-X.<br>
In accordance with this structure, the second large diameter engagement step portion 13 of the fuel injection valve J presses the second seal ring 9 toward the rear end direction in the longitudinal axial direction X-X, however, the second seal ring 9 is brought into contact with the fourth engagement step portion 24, whereby the movement mentioned above stops in a state in which the second seal ring 9 is slightly compressed.<br>
At this time, there is a case that the first seal ring 4 arranged in the side of the leading end 7A of the fuel injection valve J is apart from the third engagement step portion 16 of the throttle body 1, however, since the inner diameter portion 4A and the outer diameter portion 4B of the first seal ring 4 are held to the first supporting shaft portion 5 and the<br>
21<br><br>
first large diameter supporting hole 14 in the compression state, the intake passage 2 and the atmospheric air are still blocked.<br>
As described above, in accordance with the fuel injection valve on the basis of the present invention, since the movement of the fuel injection valve J to the side of the leading end 7A in the longitudinal axial direction X-X of the fuel injection valve J is restricted by the first seal ring 4, the first large diameter engagement step portion 8 and the third engagement step portion 16, and the movement to the side of the rear end JB is restricted by the second seal ring 9, the second large diameter engagement step portion 13 and the fourth engagement step portion 24, it is not necessary to use any positioning means for restricting the movement in the longitudinal axial direction X-X of the fuel injection valve J, in the fuel supply pipe 20 .<br>
In other words, it is not necessary to firmly fix the fuel supply pipe 20 to the throttle body 1 along the longitudinal axial direction of the fuel injection valve J.<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to screw and fix the fuel supply pipe 20 to the throttle body 1, for example, in the mounting direction orthogonal to the longitudinal axial direction X-X (this is shown in Fig.<br>
22<br><br>
1), and it is possible to largely improve a freedom of mounting property of the fuel supply pipe 2 0.<br>
In this case, an assembling order of the fuel injection valve J is not limited to the embodiment mentioned above.<br>
As described above, in accordance with the mounting structure of the fuel injection valve on the basis of the present invention, since the first seal ring arranged in the side of the leading end of the fuel injection valve is supported by the first supporting shaft portion of the fuel injection valve and the first large diameter supporting hole in the compression state in the inner and outer diameter portions, and is supported between the first large diameter engagement step portion of the fuel injection valve and the third engagement step portion of the throttle body in the longitudinal axial direction of the fuel injection valve, and the second seal ring arranged in the side of the rear end of the fuel injection valve is supported by the second supporting shaft portion of the fuel injection pipe and the second large diameter supporting hole of the fuel supply pipe in the compression state in the inner and outer diameter portions, and is supported between the second large diameter engagement step portion of the fuel injection valve and the fourth engagement step portion of the<br>
23<br><br>
fuel supply pipe in the longitudinal axial direction of the fuel injection valve, it is possible to securely hold the air tightness between the intake passage and the atmospheric air in the side of the leading end of the fuel injection valve, and the air tightness between the fuel supply passage and the atmospheric air in the side of the rear end of the fuel injection valve.<br>
Further, since the screw for fastening the fuel supply pipe to the throttle body is not necessarily firmly attached to the throttle body along the longitudinal axial direction of the fuel injection valve in the manner mentioned above, it is possible to widely improve the freedom of mounting the fuel supply pipe to the throttle body, and in particular the structure is preferably used in a motor cycle in which a mounting space portion is narrower than a four-wheel vehicle.<br>
Further, there is not required a restricting member such as a clip or the like for restricting the movement of the fuel injection valve with respect to the longitudinal axial direction.<br>
24<br><br>
