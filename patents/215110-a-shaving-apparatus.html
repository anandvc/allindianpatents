				<td>The invention relates to a shaving apparatus<br>
In replaceable shaving cartridges "and disposable razors, one-or more blades are secured in a plastic housing. The surface in front of the blade or blades is known as the guard, and the surface behind the blade or blades is known as the cap.<br>
The guard is often provided with a structure designed to engage and stretch the skin in front of the blades, and the cap is generally designed to slide over the skin and in some cases is provided with a water leachable lubricating strip.  Published PCT application WO 96/01171, which is hereby incorporated by reference, reviews the disclosure of various forms of guard, cap, and blades in various blade assemblies described in prior art patents. For example, Apprille et al. U.S. Patent No. 5,249,361 discloses a  two-part molded guard structure having an upper skin engaging portion of elastomeric material with a<br><br>
plurality of upwardly projecting protrusions formed thereon and a lower base portion of rigid plastic material that is anchored in the cartridge housing.<br>
Other guard structures are shown in Crook et al. U.S. Patent No. 5,191,712.  Miller et al. U.S. Patent-No. 5,056,222 describes shaving cartridges with spring-biased metal housing members that are located in front of the blades, contain water leachable materials that are exposed between metal webs, and have skin tensioning structures at different locations on the metal, housing member.<br><br>
The- invention features, in general, a shaving system that includes a housing, one or more blades mounted on the housing, a cap behind the blades on the housing, and a guard structure in front of the blades on the housing.  The guard structure includes flexible skin-engaging protrusions that engage .a user'-s skin, in front of the blades and a water leachable shaving aid composite positioned to deliver a shaving aid to the skin behind the flexible skin-engaging protrusions.  The shaving aid is thus desirably delivered in front of the blades without interfering with the ability of the flexible skin-engaging protrusions to engage the user's skin.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the'guard structure includes a backstop member that defines a blade exposure -for the first blade.  The flexible skin-engaging protrusions are in the form of flexible fins that extend generally parallel to the blades. The water leachable shaving aid composite has a skin-contacting surface that extends uninterrupted for substantially the length of the blades, and the fins extend above the skin-contacting surface.  The water leachable shaving aid composite includes a .water-insoluble polymer and a water-soluble polymer that provides the shaving aid. Preferably the shaving aid is a skin lubricant; other additives can be provided as desired.<br>
The guard, structure preferably includes a rigid base that is anchored in the housing, and the flexible skin-engaging protrusions (preferably fins) are mounted on the rigid base.  The water leachable shaving aid composite can also be mounted on the rigid base.  The backstop member can be mounted on the rigid base, can be formed on the same component as the rigid base or the housing, or can be formed of the same material as the flexible material component or<br>
as part of the flexible material component.  The rigid base, the flexible material component and the backstop member can be molded together, coextruded together, or formed separately and adhered together.  The water leachable shaving aid composite can be secured to the rigid base, the flexible material component or the housing by adhesive or mechanical interlock. Also, the guard structure can be made by three-color molding or three-color extrusion.<br>
Alternatively, the water leachable shaving aid can be contained within a cavity in the guard structure, and the guard structure can have channels extending from the shaving aid to a location behind flexible skin-engaging protrusions. Other protrusions; e.g., fin segments oriented at different angles with respect to said blades or nubs, can also be used.<br>
Preferably the flexible material component is made of elastomeric material such as a rubber (e.g., natural rubber, butyl rubber, nitrile rubber, styrene butadiene rubber) or a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) (e.g., styrene butadiene styrene (SBS) TPE, styrene ethylene butadiene styrene (SEES) TPE, polyester TPE, polyamide TPE, polyurethane TPE, polyolefin based TPE, and blends of any of these TPEs) .  Preferably the rigid base is made of a thermoplastic material, e.g., polystyrene; high-impact polystyrene, polypropylene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, polycarbonate, Noryl, or Nylons.<br>
Preferably the blades are spring-biased, and the cartridge is pivotally mounted with respect to a handle.<br>
In some preferred embodiments the water leachable shaving aid is directly mounted on the housing.  In some preferred embodiments there also is a backstop member that is directly mounted on the housing; . the backstop member can be integral with the housing or can be two-color molded with<br><br>
the housing:  The flexible skin-engaging protrusions can be directly connected to the housing by two-color injection molding.<br>
In another aspect, the invention features, in general, a shaving system including a housing, one or more blades mounted on the housing, a cap behind the blades on the housing, and a guard structure in front of the blades on the housing.  The guard structure includes a first water leachable shaving aid composite, and the cap includes a second water leachable shaving aid composite.  The first and second water leachable shaving aid composites have respective first and second wear indicators.  The first and second wear indicators preferably have different rates of change in appearance as a function of usage.<br>
Embodiments of the invention may achieve one or more of the following advantages. Additional amounts of shaving aid can be provided to the skin.  In addition, it is believed that.the embodiments of the invention will provide reduced nicks, improved closeness, and improved lubrication, and may also have improved comfort. - Also, when a razor is placed face down on a wet counter, there may.be less . tendency for the guard structure to stick on the counter surface.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a shaving apparatus with a housing,<br><br>
at  least one  blades mounted on said housing, a cap behind said<br>
blades on said housing, and a guard structure in front of said blades on said housing, said guard structure having a plurality of flexible skin-engaging protrusions to engage a user's skin in front of said blades, characterized in that a water leachable shaving aid composite is positioned to deliver a shaving aid to said skin behind said flexible skin-engaging protrusions and in front of said one or more blades.<br>
Other advantages and features of the invention will be apparent from the following description of preferred embodiments described with reference to the accompanying drawings therefore and from the claims.<br>

cavity 54 in back'stop member-55, and channels 56 extend from the shaving aid composite to a location behind flexible skin-engaging fins 58.  U.S. Serial No.  08/497,194, filed June 30, 1995, which is hereby incorporated by reference, describes cavity and channel configurations and materials that can be used.  Structure 50 also includes rigid base member 60 and flexible material component 62, which includes the fins.  Backstop member 55 can be made of the same material as component 62 or can be made of the same material as rigid base 60 and be formed integrally with it.<br>
The elastomeric protrusions (here fins) can have, different sizes and shapes, including those defined in U.S. Patent No. 5,191,712, which is hereby incorporated by reference.  In particular the protrusions can be in -the form of nubs or fin segments oriented at different angles with respect to the blades, e.g., in herring bone or checker board patterns.  The protrusions can also take the form of spaced fin segments that are arranged in rows oriented parallel to the blades or spaced fin segments that are arranged both parallel to and perpendicular to the blades.<br>
Rigid bases 22, 34, 44, 60 are preferably made of thermoplastic materials, e.g., polystyrene, high-impact polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) , polycarbonate, polyurethane, Nylon, and Noryl.  Flexible components 20, 32, 42 are preferably made from thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) or rubbers; examples include natural rubber, butyl rubber, nitrile rubber, styrene butadiene rubber, styrene butadiene styrene (SBS) TPEs, styrene ethylene butadiene styrene (SEES) TPEs (.e.g., Kraton) , polyester TPEs (e.g., Hytrel) , polyamide TPEs (Pebax) , polyurethane TPEs, polyolefin based TPEs, and blends of any of these TPEs (e.g., polyester/SEBS blend.<br><br>
Shaving aid composites 24, 36, 46, 52 preferably comprise a matrix of a water insoluble polymer and, dispersed within the matrix, a skin lubricating water-soluble polymer.  Alternatively, the shavinglaid composite may comprise a sheath of water-insoluble polymer (e.g., the cavity defining component in Fig. 5) that surrounds a core which includes a. skin-lubricating water-soluble polymer.<br>
Suitable water-insoluble polymers which can be used for the matrix (or sheath), include polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, butadiene styrene copolymer (e.g., medium and high impact polystyrene), polyacetal, . acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer and blends such as<br>
polypropylene/polystyrene blend, most preferably a high impact polystyrene (i.e., polystyrene-butadiene), such as Mobil 4324 (Mobil Corporation).<br>
Suitable skin lubricating water-soluble polymers include polyethylene oxide, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyacrylamide., hydroxypropyl cellulose, polyvinyl imidazoline, and polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate.  The more preferred water-soluble polymers are the polyethylene oxides generally known as POLYOX (available from Union Carbide Corporation) or ALKOX (available from Meisei Chemical Works, Kyota, Japan).  These polyethylene oxides will preferably have molecular weights of about 100,000 to 6 million, most preferably about 300,000 to 5 million.  The most preferred polyethylene oxide comprises a blend of about 40 to 80% of polyethylene oxide having an average molecular weight of about 5 million (e.g., POLYOX COAGULANT) and about 60 to 20% of polyethylene oxide having an average molecular weight of about 300,000 (e.g., POLYOX WSR-N-750) .  The polyethylene oxide blend may also advantageously contain up to about 10%<br><br>
by weight of a low molecular weight (i.e., MW
The shaving aid composite may also optionally include an inclusion complex of a skin-soothing agent with a cylcodextrin, low molecular weight water-soluble release enhancing agents such as polyethylene glycol (e.g., 1-10% by weight), water-swellable release enhancing agents such as cross-linked polyacrylics (e.g., 2-7% by weight), colorants, antioxidants, preservatives, microbicidal agents, beard softeners, astringents, depilatories, medicinal agents, conditioning agents, cooling agents, etc.<br>
Particular preferred embodiments include rigid bases of polypropylene, flexible components of an SEES based TPE available under the Kraton G trade designation or C-Flex trade designation, and a shaving aid composite of about 35% high impact polystyrene, about 55% polyethylene oxide, and about 10% polyethylene glycol.<br>
The guard structure can be manufactured by two-color injection molding.  The polypropylene rigid base is molded first at about 200-230°C mold temperature, and the SEES based TPE fin component is then molded on the polypropylene rigid base at around 200-230°C mold temperature.  Shaving aid composites are made by extruding the polyethylene oxide (PEO) blend using an Haake HBI system 90 at typicai^ processing conditions.<br>
Alternatively, the three components (or two of the three components) can be made by coextrusion or can be made separately and then adhered together with adhesive.<br>
In use, flexible fins 26, 38, 48, 58 engage the user's skin first, tending to stretch the skin and pull on the shaving stubble.  The flexible fins may dig into the skin, drawing hair out from the pore, and may repeatedly grab and release the stubble, holding the hair at a lower<br><br>
point with each contact.  The flexible fins may additionally act as a squeegee, removing excess fluid on the .face, and may also provide pleasant tactile sensations.<br>
Shaving aid composites 24, 36, 46, 52 apply a lubricant to the stretched skin and stubble prior to cutting by the blades.  Shaving aid composites 24, 36, 46 may change shape and wear away with repeated use. With the embodiments described in Figs. 2, 4, and 5 backstop members 28, 50 provide a permanent surface to define the exposure for the first blade regardless of the change in shape of the shaving aid composite 24 or 46 that may occur with repeated use. It is believed that the shaving systems with the improved guard structure as described will have reduced nicks, improved closeness, .and improved lubrication, and may also have improved comfort. Also, when a razor is placed face down on a wet counter, there may be less tendency for the guard structure to stick on the counter surface. The extra fill flow material permits additional fill flow, material to be used.<br>
Features and advantages of the invention are further<br>
illustrated by the following example of a guard structure,<br>
but the particular materials and amounts thereof as well as.<br>
other conditions .and details, should not be construed to<br>
limit this invention.	<br>
Example<br>
A guard structure was made of a rigid support of polypropylene (Amoco propylene 7635}, flexible fins and a backstop of SEES (GLS Elastalloy 6545), and a shaving aid composite of the following PEG blend:<br>
Polyethylene oxide (Union Carbide Polyox N750): 22%<br>
Polyethylene oxide (Union Carbide Polyox Coagulant): 33%<br>
High impact polystyrene (Mobil HIPS 4324):	33%<br>
Polyethylene glycol (Dow PEG 4500):<br><br>
Other additives:	2%<br>
A two color injection molding machine was used to make the rigid support,  the' flexible fins and flexible backstop.  The polypropylene part was molded first, and the .fins and<br>
*<br>
flexible backstop were then molded on the polypropylene support. The molding temperature for polypropylene was around 200-230°C, and the molding temperature for SEBS was around 200-220°C.   The PEO blend was extruded to the . necessary profile using a Haake HBI System 90 extruder at around 180-2"00°C. The extruded PEO blend was then cut to length, and then the shaving aid composite pieces were glued to the molded parts.<br>
Other embodiments of the invention are within the scope of the claims.<br>
For example, referring to Fig. 6, razor cartridge<br>
100 includes housing 102 on which are mounted guard<br>
structure 104, first and second spring biased blades 106,<br>
108, and cap lubricating strip 110. Guard structure 104<br>
includes rigid base 112 that is anchored in housing 102, and<br>
has flexible skin-engaging protrusions 114 that are mounted<br>
on base 112.  Water leachable shaving aid composite 116 and<br>
backstop member 118 are mounted on base 112.  Backstop<br>
member 118 defines a blade exposure for the first blade L06<br>
on the cartridge.	^    ' .<br>
Referring to Figs. .7 and'8, each .of razor cartridge 120. and cartridge 122 includes a housing 124 on which is mounted a respective guard structure 126, 127, first and second spring biased blades 106, 108, and a cap lubricating strip 110.  Each guard structure 126, 127 includes the front supporting portion 128.of housing 124 and a fin member 130, which is mounted on base' 131. Fin member 130 can be coextruded with base 131.  Alternatively, base 130 can be integrally formed as part of portion 128 of housing 124, and<br><br>
fin member 130 can be two-color molded with housing 124. Each guard structure 126, 127 also includes a water  leachable shaving aid composite 132, which is mounted on housing portion 128.  Guard structure 126 (Fig. 7) also includes backstop member 134, which is mounted on housing portion 128 and defines a blade exposure for the first blade 106 on the cartridge. Alternatively, backstop member 134 can be made as part of portion 128, in which case it would be rigid, or can be made of the same material as fin member 130, in which case backstop member 134 and fin member 130 could both be two-color molded.<br>
In any of the examples described, the water leachable shaving aid composite in front of the blades and the water leachable shaving aid composite behind the blades can have respective first and second colored usage indicators that change appearance with usage, and the first and second usage indicators can have different rates of appearance change as a function of usage.  U.S. Patents Nos. 3,879,844 and 5,340,581, and Published PCT Applications Nos. WO9604112 and WO9601172, which are hereby incorporated by reference, describe such usage indicators.   This can advantageously be used to define a window or range of time for the user to consider in assessing when a cartridge should be replaced.<br><br><br><br>
