DATA STREAM FILTERING APPARATUS &amp; METHOD<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for filtering streams of data packets in a shared. medium or point-to-multipoint communications system and a system incorporating the same.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
There are many known examples of communications network architectures which make use of shared medium communication between a transmitter and multiple receivers. Architectures include for example poirrt-to-multipoint optical networks and wireless networks, in particular for (but not limited to) telecommunications access networks. Whilst these architectures have many problems in common, they are described here in the context of Passive Optical Networks (PON's) in general and Gigabit Ethernet PON's (GEPON's) in particular.<br>
GEPON's have been proposed as a means of cost effectively providing fibre access to homes and businesses. In such a network, downstream traffic is broadcast to all nodes whereas a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocol is used to multiplex the upstream traffic onto the PON without collisions.<br>
One significant problem with a GEPON is that all downstream traffic is broadcast and hence visible to all end-nodes, which are likely to be unrelated home or business customers. A security mechanism is required which can filter traffic at the end node in order that each customer will only receive traffic destined for his end-node.<br>
A second problem with a GEPON is that, unlike a conventional Ethernet Access system based on point-to-point links, there are multiple customers associated with a single physical port at the headend. Thus, the headend Access Router or switch can no longer use physical port association as a means of differentiating customer traffic in order to enforce policies such as security, bandwidth allocation, access to particular .traffic types, etc. A<br><br>
different mechanism for differentiating customers' traffic is therefore required.<br>
One known approach to filtering downstream traffic destined for a specific Optical Network Unit (ONU) is to filter by MAC address. If each ONU has a single MAC address, and all Ethernet frames for that ONU use this address, then this provides the headend with a sufficient means of differentiation traffic for different customers. There are however several disadvantages to this approach. First, it is likely that the customer will have several Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) devices connected to a local network, each Ethernet device having its own distinct MAC address. Simple layer 2 bridging of traffic destined for these different CPE devices (e.g. PCs, Set Top Boxes etc) cannot therefore be used, forcing the use of a more complex solution such as layer 3 switching via a router. This solution is not however suitable for multicast traffic, such as multicast video, which uses a different multicast MAC address.<br>
A second known approach to tackling the problem is to allow the ONU to use several MAC addresses for its CPE devices, with the ONU bridging the traffic destined for these CPE devices. This however can create significant security problems, as a CPE device such as a PC on one ONU could relatively easily impersonate a device on another ONU and hence steal traffic destined for that ONU. In addition, a PC or Set Top Box could "tune-in" to multicast video traffic purchased by another customer on the PON. Furthermore, a mechanism is required by which the list of MAC addresses to be passed through an ONU can be populated. In any practical system, this mechanism must be automatic and therefore adds further complexity in the ONU.<br>
Both of the above approaches can work successfully if routing or security and multicast functions are built into the ONU, which is then owned and managed by the network provider. In such arrangements the ONU becomes a ."trusted" device performing filtering and policing functions, together with other functions such as routing, Network Address Translation (NAT) etc as necessary, under the control of the network operator. This is however an expensive solution, and does not fit the commercial and perhaps regulatory requirements of many operators who require a minimal-functionality ONU capable of providing an inexpensive, simple and clear demarcation point at the edge of their network.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the implementation of shared medium or point to multipoint communications systems. An important example of these is a passive optical network (PON).<br>
Fibre based access networks intended for delivery of high bandwidth services to end customers can be based on so-called Passive Optical Networks (PON's). Figure 1 shows a typical network configuration using a PON. In a PON a headend 101, which is typically located at the network operator's local point of presence or premises 10, is connected to a number of optical network units (ONU's) 111 via a fibre network 12 comprising, for example multiple optical fibre paths 122 linked by a passive optical coupler 121 to provide shared upstream communication and point-to-multipoint downstream communication. The network operator typically provides to the customer a number of services 104, 105, either locally from servers located on the operator's premises, or remotely using data links 107 to other sites. In a network using the Internet Protocol (IP) servers are linked to PON head ends via data routers 103. Typically, the operator will also require a billing and administration system 106 to regulate use of the network and charge customers for services used.<br>
On the customer premises 11, traffic received by the ONU 111 for a particular customer leaves the ONU on a customer premises port 116 which is connected into the customer premises network 112-115. Similarly, upstream traffic originating on the customer premises enters the ONU on the customer premises port 116 for onward transmission by the ONU. The customer premises network supports multiple terminal devices<br><br>
including, for example, Set Top Boxes (STBs) 114-115 for delivery of video services and Personal Computers (PCs) 113 for data services. Optionally, multiple customer premises devices can be interconnected and linked to a single ONU port using conventional networking equipment such as bridges and routers 112. Preferably, the ONU customer premises network port 116 uses a readily available data networking standard, such as Ethernet 100baseT.<br>
Some network operators require the ONU to be externally mounted to allow easy access by service technicians. In such circumstances it is particularly advantageous to minimise the size and complexity of the ONU.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a possible configuration of the PON itself in more detail. A single fibre connection 123 links the headend to a passive optical splitter 121 which divides the downstream optical power equally between a number of fibres 122, each of which terminates at an ONU 111, 111b-111n. Signals sent downstream from the headend arrive at a reduced power level at all ONUs. Each ONU converts 1113 the optical signal to an electrical signal and decodes the information. The information includes addressing information which identifies 1114 which components of the information flow are intended for a particular ONU. In the upstream direction, each ONU is allocated a time interval during which it is permitted to impress an optical signal on the upstream fibre. The signals from all ONU's are combined at the optical splitter 121 and pass over the common fibre link 123 to the headend 101. Signals sourced from any ONU propagate only to the headend. The upstream network may use separate fibre links and splitter, or may use the same network as the downstream direction but using a different optical wavelength, A.1, \2.<br>
In one possible arrangement, each ONU is granted permission to transmit by a control frame sent in the downstream direction, addressed to the MAC address of the ONU. At the end of the allotted slot, a second control frame withdraws permission to transmit. ONU's are polled in turn to allow each ONU to send any queued traffic during its allotted time slot. A more detailed description of such a method is to be found in co-pending patent application US 09/804,316 "Multiple Access System for Communications Network", the contents of which are filed herewith. This corresponds to PCT Application PCT/GB01/02395, the contents of which are also filed herewith.<br><br>
Preferably, traffic not intended for customer devices connected to a particular ONU is filtered out by the ONU, such that all traffic emerging on a particular customer interface is specifically directed to that customer. This not only reduces the traffic load on the customer premises network but also improves security since customers do not receive traffic intended for others.<br>
IEEE standard 802 allows groups of terminal devices conforming to the Ethernet standard to be grouped into a Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN). In a VLAN, a logically separate group of terminals is established within a larger group of terminals physically connected to the same LAN infrastructure. In a network not using VLAN's, terminals physically connected to the same segment of a LAN exchange information at layer 2, based on layer 2 (MAC) addressing information. Terminals grouped into a VLAN do not exchange information packets at layer 2 with other terminals connected to the same physical infrastructure which are not members of the same VLAN. Instead, information is exchanged between the segregated groups at layer 3 using IP or other higher layer forwarding. In Ethernet networks, VLANs are identified and distinguished by placing an additional address field, known as the VLAN tag, in the data frame following the MAC source and destination addresses but preceding the payload of the frame which, in turn, contains the source and destination addresses for the layer 3 protocol, for example, IP.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a MAC frame 30 containing a VLAN protocol and tag field 303, along with destination address 301, source address 302, frame length or type information 304, payload 305, and frame check sequence 306 fields. The VLAN tag itself is allocated 12 bits of the 'VLAN protocol ID and tag' field 303, thereby offering 4096 distinct values, some of which are reserved. This therefore supports approximately 4000 distinct VLAN's on a given LAN segment.<br>
In the present invention, a VLAN tag value, preferably unique, is assigned to each customer on the network segment. The headend networking equipment 101 is configured to add the correct tag to downstream traffic destined for a given customer. The ONU 111 can then be configured to forward to the customer premises port only those Ethernet frames carrying the correct VLAN tag. In this way, the ONU does not need to examine the destination MAC address field of each frame and compare it to a list of<br><br>
local addresses. Furthermore, complex functions associated with populating the address table are no longer needed. An example ONU block diagram is shown in Figure 4.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the ONU deletes the VLAN tag in downstream frames before forwarding them via the customer port 116 as part of the VLAN tag filter function 1117, so that the VLAN tag is not propagated into the customer premises network 11.<br>
Conveniently, the ONU can add the customer-specific VLAN tag to frames of upstream traffic originating on the customer premises. The headend networking equipment can then straightforwardly identify traffic from a given customer in order to provide network policy filtering, for example to limit the traffic from a particular customer to a contracted rate.<br>
In a practical network, it is highly desirable that the system should be 'plug and play', that is, no re-configuration of the ONU should be needed when attaching a new ONU to an existing system. Preferably, it should not be necessary to pre-configure an ONU for a particular VLAN tag. This invention provides a means whereby an unconfigured ONU can 'learn' its VLAN tag from the network without manual intervention at the customer premises.<br>
Firstly, the MAC address of the new ONU must become known to the system. This can be done by manual intervention at the headend, but preferably is performed automatically. Co-pending patent application US 09/804,316 "Multiple Access System for Communications Network", discloses a method for accomplishing this.<br>
Once the MAC address of a new ONU is known to the system, the ONU can be included in the normal polling loop and thus allocated an upstream transmission time slot in which to send its queued upstream traffic.<br>
Next, the headend of the system must determine the VLAN tag to be used for the new customer. Various strategies could be adopted by the network operator to generate a suitable VLAN tag value. For example, a set of VLAN values, corresponding to the maximum number of ONU's allowed on each PON, could be allocated to each headend PON port and an unused value could be selected from this list. In a practical network, it is likely that other items of headend networking equipment will need to be<br><br>
configured with the VLAN tag value. The VLAN tag must be unique at least within the PON to which the new customer is connected: that is, unique per controlling head-end. Conveniently, many PONs can be grouped based on the partitioning of the headend networking equipment and each customer within the PON group can be assigned a unique VLAN tag. Since the VLAN address space allows for up to around 4000 distinct VLAN's, at most 4000 customers can be grouped in this way.<br>
Referring now to Figure 5, once the ONU MAC address and the desired VLAN tag are known to the headend, the headend sends a frame addressed to the MAC address of the new ONU and carrying the VLAN tag to be used by the ONU to filter its local traffic and identify its upstream frames. On receipt 50 of such a VLAN notification' frame addressed to its own MAC address 51, an ONU reads the VLAN tag and saves the value locally 52.<br>
Preferably, though not necessarily, the VLAN tag specified in the VLAN notification frame is transmitted in the MAC header in the format and position specified for VLAN tags in the IEEE 802 standard, as illustrated in Figure 3. Alternatively, or in addition, the numerical value of the customer specific VLAN tag can be transmitted within the payload of the VLAN notification frame.<br>
On receiving any frame not addressed to its own MAC address 51, the ONU compares 53 the VLAN tag with the previously saved value. If the tags match, the frame is forwarded 54 via the local customer premises interface. If there is no match, the frame is discarded 55. Referring to Figure 4, these functions are performed in the ONU 111 by a local address detector 1115, a VLAN tag store 1116, and a VLAN tag filter 1117. Appropriate physical and MAC layer functionality is provided 1111-1114, 1118-1119 facing the upstream 122 and downstream 116 links to handle basic receipt and transmission of frames.<br>
Optionally, the saved VLAN tag value is inserted 1117a in upstream frames arriving on the local customer premises interface 116 before being forwarded on the PON during the ONU's active time slot.<br>
The VLAN tag value associated with a particular ONU can be changed as desired by the network operator by sending a new tag in a frame addressed to the MAC address of the ONU. Preferably, frames<br><br>
addressed to the MAC address of the ONU are not forwarded on the local customer premises interface.<br>
Advantageously, for security reasons, and in particular to prevent eavesdropping of PON traffic intended for other customers, frames arriving on the customer premises interface of the ONU addressed to the MAC address of the ONU do not cause the saved VLAN tag value to be updated.<br>
A reduced functionality ONU employing VLAN tags to filter downstream traffic is referred to as a Thin ONU".<br>
According to the Ethernet standard, frames contain a cyclic redundancy check which can be tested at the receiving end of the link to check for transmission errors. A frame containing errors is normally discarded, so that a corrupted VLAN notification frame would be lost. Optionally, to improve resilience to such transmission errors, multiple VLAN notification frames could be transmitted from the headend. Other improvements to the detail of this protocol, such as multiple transmissions coupled to a voting system, will be evident to those skilled in the art.<br>
Optionally, VLAN notification frames may be sent periodically to all active ONU's in case of corruption within the ONU itself. VLAN tags assigned to specific ONU's may also be changed dynamically at any time under headend control without materially affecting traffic throughput.<br>
In its simplest implementation, the Thin ONU possesses one network facing data port implementing the PON protocol and one customer facing port. In one preferred embodiment, the network-facing PON port uses a gigabit Ethernet PON protocol, such as that described in co-pending patent application US 09/804,316 "Multiple Access System for Communications Network". Preferably, the customer-facing. data port implements the Ethernet protocol. Preferably, this is an interface to the IEEE 100baseT standard.<br>
The basic system described above allocates a single VLAN to each customer. Some customers, particularly business customers, may require more than one logically separate network connection e.g. in order to implement multiple Virtual Private Networks (VPN's). For example, a business might wish to segregate its information services, using distinct<br><br>
services provider networks for voice and data services whilst using a common physical network connection. The basic system can be extended to allow operation under such circumstances by allocating more than one VLAN to an ONU, yet without a significant increase in ONU complexity.<br>
Suppose a business customer requires three distinct VPNs. Each VPN is allocated a distinct VLAN tag value from a numerically contiguous group, where the size of the group is an integer power of two (in this case, four) and the lowest tag value in the group is an integer multiple of the group size. Where four tags are needed at an ONU, a valid set of tag values would be, for example, 1000,1001,1002 and 1003, whereas the set 1001, 1002, 1003 and 1004 would be invalid (since the lowest member is not divisible by four). In the example cited, three tags would be allocated from the group of four available tag values.<br>
During the initialisation sequence, the ONU learns any one of its VLAN tags (in this case, any one of the four values allocated) in the same way as described above for the single VLAN case, and stores the value locally. To allow operation with multiple tags, the ONU is configured with the number of tags required. Optionally, this can be done by a management command during or following the initialisation process. The VLAN tag is transmitted as a binary number which, in the Ethernet standard, consists of 12 binary digits (bits). Frames arriving on the PON interface carrying the ONU MAC address in the destination address field are processed in the same way as for the single VLAN case. To allow operation with multiple tags, the ONU compares the VLAN tag in all other downstream frames (those not carrying the MAC address of the ONU) with the stored value, but the comparison process is modified to ignore mismatches in some of the least significant bits. The number of bits ignored is equal to the power to which the number two must be raised to equal the group size. Where four VLAN's are allocated to a single ONU, mismatches in the two least significant bits are ignored. Similarly, where eight VLAN's are allocated to a single ONU, mismatches in the three least significant bits are ignored. In this way, a frame tagged with any of the VLAN values from the contiguous set will be relayed through onto the customer premises interface.<br>
Whilst a particular method of associating VLAN tags with a given ONU has been described above, it will be apparent to the skilled person that other methods would be equally effective. Similarly, it is apparent that the<br><br>
multiple VLAN tags associated with a given ONU need not be contiguous. For example, in a multiple VLAN tag ONU, receipt of a frame addressed to the ONU may add the associated VLAN tag to the stored list rather than overwrite the previously stored VLAN tag. Stored VLAN tags could be removed from the list upon receipt of a frame addressed to the ONU, containing the VLAN tag to be rescinded together with some indication that the frame is to be interpreted as an instruction to remove rather than add a tag. For example one bit of the VLAN tag field could be used to distinguish between frames to add and remove VLAN tags from the stored list, or another bit or bits of the frame could be employed for this purpose.<br>
Preferably, in a multiple VLAN system, the VLAN tag is not removed by the ONU but is passed through onto the customer interface port to allow a downstream customer premises switch or router (figure 1) to separate VPN's according to the VLAN tag.<br>
In the upstream direction, traffic is assumed to arrive at the ONU customer port with VLAN tags attached in order to differentiate streams belonging to different VPN's. Preferably, to improve network security, the ONU will check that the VLAN tag already attached to an incoming frame on the customer port is a member of the set of tags allocated to that ONU. If the tag is valid, the ONU will then forward the frame onto the PON interface with the VLAN tag unchanged. If the tag is invalid the ONU may either discard the frame or change the most significant bits of the tag value to force it into the valid range. Preferably, upstream frames which arrive at the ONU untagged should be forwarded to the PON interface with the stored tag value (which was learnt during the initialisation process) inserted. Alternatively, untagged upstream frames could be discarded.<br>
Preferably, an ONU should be configurable for operation in either single VLAN or multiple VLAN modes. Optionally, an ONU will default to single VLAN mode. Preferably, configuration is performed by management messages during or following the initialisation process.<br>
The logical functions associated with the process described in this invention are significantly simpler than known alternative means for establishing a filtering function at the ONU and lend themselves to integration into a single application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Such an ASIC could also contain the MAC logic for both the PON interface and<br><br>
the local customer connection. The resulting reduction in ONU parts count leads potentially to lower cost and higher reliability.<br>
Reduced ONU complexity also allows operation at lower electrical power levels than the equivalent prior art. This is particularly significant when supplying services which require high availability, even during failure of local electrical power, when battery backup must be used to maintain service.<br>
Optionally, operating power for a Thin ONU can be supplied over a metallic data cable linking the ONU to other customer premises equipment, where the customer premises equipment (such as the bridge / router 112 illustrated in Figure 1) is equipped with a system to deliver power to remotely connected devices. A specific standard for delivery of operating power over a metallic Ethernet link is under development by IEEE standards group 802.<br>
Conveniently, powering of the Thin ONU over the metallic customer premises network connection allows optional backup batteries to be housed in a relatively benign environment within the customer premises, even when the ONU itself is externally mounted.<br>
Optionally, the Thin ONU can be mounted in a street cabinet. Electrical power can be derived from metallic connections to network based powering equipment, or carried over a metallic connection from the customer premises.<br>
This invention has been described with reference to VLAN tags as the method for differentiating customer traffic. However, as will be clear to anyone skilled in the art, other identification schemes could equally be applied including, for example, Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) as described in the Internet Engineering Task Force Request for Comment RFC 3032.<br>
Referring now to Figure 6, the filtering method can be applied at multiple points across a network, not just at the customer premises (i.e. the boundary of the operator's network). In particular, the network 12a may be hierarchically structured having multiple optical split points 121. By situating a packet filter 124 - having similar functionality to an ONU but supporting optical communication at both the upstream and downstream<br><br>
ports - at an intermediate point within the network, traffic to downstream portions of the network may be filtered prior to downward transmission. In this configuration it is desirable for the intermediate filter 124 to support forwarding of packets carrying any one of a plurality of VLAN tags, and to forward the VLAN tag downstream unchanged: packet differentiation between individual VLAN tags corresponding to individual customer networks may be performed at respective ONU's 111.<br>
Referring now to Figure 7, at the head end 101, a mapping 1015 between customer premises equipment addresses and VLAN tags must be maintained in order to allow the head end to set the appropriate value of the VLAN tag field before forwarding data received from the network 107 across the local network 12 to ONU's 112.<br>
This can be achieved by constructing and maintaining 1016 a stored mapping 1015 between, for example, Internet Protcol (IP) addresses associated with customer equipment and the Ethernet MAC addresses of the corresponding ONU and customer equipment itself. A VLAN tag can then be allocated by the head end to be associated with traffic to be directed to the customer equipment Ethernet address via the associated ONU. The VLAN tag is then sent over the shared medium 12 addressed 301 to the relevant ONU 112 and containing the allocated VLAN tag 303. Subsequently, data received from the network 107, or indeed from the local network, and addressed to that IP address is sent over the local network in Ethernet frames addressed to the corresponding Ethernet address and importantly having the VLAN tag field set to the previously allocated corresponding VLAN tag.<br>
In this way the head end effectively ensures that data addressed to a particular IP address is only made visible to the corresponding customer by adding 1014 the necessary VLAN tag and ensuring the ONU's are provisioned only to forward frames having the necessary tag. As a consequence, the ONU need only check that the received VLAN tag field has a currently allowed value, rather than maintain information on all IP and Ethernet addresses accessible via the ONU. This leads to a simple, cost-effective functionality in the ONU.<br>
To set up the VLAN tag mapping, the head end may receive requests from the ONU for a VLAN tag to be allocated (e.g. if an ONU receives upstream traffic from a newly-connected subscriber and the ONU<br><br>
identifles it has not yet been allocated a VLAN tag). In response, the head end allocates 1016 a new VLAN tag to the ONU and communicates this 1016 in a downstream frame addressed to the ONU.<br>
Where a previously allocated VLAN tag is no longer required, the ONU may forward a request, from the customer premises, requesting deallocation of the tag. The head end can then effect the deallocation.<br>
The invention can also be applied to other point to multipoint networks, including wireless networks.<br>
Any range or device value given herein may be extended or altered without losing the effect sought, as will be apparent to the skilled person for an understanding of the teachings herein.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
