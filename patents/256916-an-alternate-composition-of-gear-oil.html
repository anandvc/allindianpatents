				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a gear oil composition. This invention particularly relates to a composition of gear oil that mainly contains alkyl benzenes. In addition to alkyl benzenes, the composition also contains antioxidant, extreme pressure additive, antifoaming agent, pour point depressant, corrosion inhibitor, detergent-dispersant additive and lubricity additives, and has utility as a gear lubricant of VG46 grade for industrial and automotive application.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Gears transmitted rotary motion. Modern metallurgy has greatly increased the useful life of industrial and automotive gears. Operating capacity of a gear-set is limited by one of four types of failure, Wear, Scoring, Pitting, and Tooth breakage due to operating speed, load, lubricant characteristics and operating temperature. The severity of the conditions varies in its diverse application as marine turbines, rolling mill, automobile transmissions, and aircraft propeller gears, that an oil can withstand and acts only over a narrow range of contact that newly lubricated and relatively cool surfaces are constantly coming into action.<br>
Under the conditions of high pressure and considerable momentary temperature rise, a film must prevent damage to the tooth surface by abrasion or scuffing. In industrial applications, stability is of the greatest importance. In the case of oils used in a. common system for lubricating steam turbines and reduction gears, contact with water further increases the necessity for stability and demulsibility.<br>
The range of operating temperatures may impose limits on the allowable viscosity, particularly at low temperatures. From the known knowledge and experience, the following broad generalization on the influence of the properties of oil on its behavior of a gear lubricant can been drawn.<br>
(a)	for straight mineral oils, tooth friction and wear diminish with increase of<br>
viscosity.<br>
(b)	for the same viscosity, the coefficient of friction is lower with paraffin-base.<br>
(c)	refinement by an unsuitable process may increase both tooth friction and<br>
wear.<br>
(d) oil of low friction usually give the great protection against wear.<br>
As it is not possible to prevent lubricant losses to the environment. Ecological balance is of great concern or survival of living beings. Industry experts estimate that 70% to 80% of hydraulic fluids leave systems through leaks, spills, line breakage and fitting failure.<br>
No doubt petroleum based lubricants increase the capacity and speed of industry and other machines. It however leads to increase in temperature of environment and thus contributes to global warming. It damages living organisms including plants, animals and marine life for many years. The petroleum based lubricating oils are hydrocarbons consisting of naphthenes, paraffins, aromatics, polynuclear aromatics and unsaturates. Petroleum based lube oils, generally suffer from disadvantages such as high toxicity to the environment, poor biodegradability and inconsistent characteristics with change in crude oil composition. The other types of lubricants known as synthetic lubricants are designed for use in extreme conditions of temperature, pressure, radiation or chemical and have excellent lubricity and thermal stability. The synthetic lubricants are relatively costly, also toxic to environment.<br>

A patent filled by the inventors of the present invention disclosed the use of Heavy Alkyl Benzene alkaline earth metal sulfonates used as detergent-dispersant-anti rust additive in various types of lubricants (Patent application IPA number 1306/DEL/1998 &amp; 1307/DEL/1998 by A.K.Singh etal assigned to CSIR).<br>
The alkyl benzenes are mono, di and poly substituted alkyl aromatics having one benzene or toluene aromatic ring and straight or branched paraffinic chains,<br>
preferably mono and di alkyl benzene. Alkyl benzenes are produced as by-products during the preparation of, (1) linear alkyl benzene (LAB) in detergent industry, (2) heavy aromatic produced in catalytic reformer, and (3) naphtha or gas steam cracker liquid product. Alkyl benzene consists of substituted benzenes and no poly-aromatics/ condensed ring or olefinic compounds are present in the alkyl benzenes. It can be used as an alternate to mineral base stock of lubricants. It will reduce the hazard potential of the lubricants. It will provide required properties such as good gear oil properties, lubricity, load carrying, stability, anti-corrosion properties and more eco-friendliness.<br>
