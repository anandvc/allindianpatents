				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
MULTI-CARRIER COMMUNICATION APPARATUS AND PEAK POWER<br>
SUPPRESSION METHOD<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a multi-carrier<br>
communication apparatus to which an OFDM (Orthogonal<br>
Frequency Division Multiple) system is applied and a peak<br>
power suppression method for such a multi-carrier<br>
communication apparatus, and more particularly, to a<br>
multi-carrier communication apparatus and a peak power<br>
suppress ion method forsucha multi-carrier communication<br>
apparatus suitable for a mobile station apparatus such<br>
as a cellular phone and portable TV telephone set in a<br>
mobile unit communication system, a base station<br>
apparatus communicating with this mobile station<br>
apparatus and digital TV broadcasting or digital speech<br>
broadcasting transmission/reception apparatus.<br>
Background Art<br>
One of conventional multi-carrier communication<br>
apparatuses and peak power suppression methods for such<br>
multi-carrier communication apparatuses of this kind is<br>
described in Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication<br>
No.HEI 7-143098.<br>
FIG.1 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a conventional multi-carrier communication apparatus.<br><br>
Multi-carrier communication apparatus 11 shown in<br>
this FIG.1 comprises digital modulation section 12, S/P<br>
(Serial/Parallel)conversion section 13 and IFFT(inverse<br>
fast Fourier transform) section 14 on the transmitting<br>
side and FFT (fast Fourier transform) section 15, P/S<br>
(Parallel/Serial) conversion section 16 and digital<br>
demodulation section 17 on the receiving side.<br>
In such a configuration, digital modulation section<br>
12 on the transmitting side carries out digital modulation<br>
on transmission data according to a modulation system<br>
such as BPSK (Binariphase Phase Shift Keying) and 16QAM<br>
(Quadrature Amplitude Modulation), etc.<br>
The serial data after modulation is converted to<br>
parallel data (digital symbol) by S/P conversion section<br>
13, then this parallel data is subjected to an inverse<br>
fast Fourier transform processing by IFFT section 14 where<br>
this parallel data is superimposed on subcarriers of<br>
different phases and output as a transmission OFDM symbol<br>
signal which is continuous time-series data.<br>
On the other hand, on the receiving side, a reception<br>
OFDM symbol signal is subjected to a fast Fourier transform<br>
processing by FFT section 15, where data superimposed<br>
on subcarriers of different phases are separated, these<br>
separated parallel data are converted to serial data by<br>
P/S conversion section 16 and this serial data is<br>
digital-demodulated by digital demodulation section 17<br>
and output.<br>
However, since the conventional apparatus transmits<br><br>
transmission data converted to parallel data and<br>
superimposed on a plurality of subcarriers, there is no<br>
correlation between data on different subcarriers and<br>
for this reason if phases of these subcarriers overlap<br>
with one another, the OFDM symbol will have an extremely<br>
large signal amplitude.<br>
Thus, when a peak voltage of a signal increases<br>
during transmission and this peak voltage is amplified<br>
by an amplifier, the peak part of the signal is trimmed<br>
according to the upper limit gain of the amplifier.<br>
Using a large amplifier to prevent this will increase<br>
the size of the apparatus as a whole, which causes problems<br>
such as increasing the price of the apparatus, increasing<br>
power consumption and increasing heating.<br>
Methods of suppressing peak voltages include the<br>
one described in Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication<br>
No.HEI 7-143098 which sets an upper limit of voltages<br>
and simply cuts voltages that exceed the upper limit.<br>
However, simply cutting a peak voltage causes the signal<br>
to distort and widen its band, resulting in problems such<br>
as deteriorating an error rate during reception<br>
(deterioration of transmission characteristic) and<br>
increasing interference with signals and systems in<br>
neighboring bands due to increased unnecessary<br>
out-of-band emissions.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide<br><br>
a multi-carrier communication apparatus and a peak power<br>
suppression method for such a multi-carrier communication<br>
apparatus capable of suppressing a peak voltage of a signal<br>
with a simple apparatus configuration without<br>
deteriorating a transmission characteristic or<br>
increasing unnecessary emissions or increasing the size<br>
of the apparatus.<br>
This object can be attained by converting signals<br>
expressed with two values to signals expressed with three<br>
values, generating signals containing amplitude "0" in<br>
the subcarrier direction, thereby reducing the<br>
possibility that the phases of signals of subcarriers<br>
will overlap with one another, reducing the number of<br>
overlapping phases and thereby suppressing peak voltages<br>
of transmission signals.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
Noticing the fact that the peak amplitude of an<br>
entire signal reduces as a result of applying successive<br>
coding processing to signals to be sent in multi-carrier<br>
communications to generate signals containing amplitude<br>
"0" and thereby generate subcarriers not to be sent, the<br>
present inventor et al. has discovered that it is possible<br>
to suppress a peak voltage of a transmission signal during<br>
a multi-carrier communication by applying successive<br><br>
coding processing to the signal to be sent and sending<br>
the signal distributed by frequency area.<br>
With reference now to the attached drawings,<br>
embodiments of the present invention will be explained<br>
in detail below.<br>
(Embodiment 1)<br>
FIG.2 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a multi-carrier communication apparatus according to<br>
Embodiment 1 of the present invention.<br>
The multi-carrier communication apparatus<br>
according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention is<br>
mainly constructed of digital modulation section 101,<br>
S/P conversion section 102, mapping section 103, IFFT<br>
section 104, radio transmission section 105, antenna 106,<br>
radio reception section 107, FFT section 108, demapping<br>
section 109, P/S conversion section 110 and digital<br>
demodulation section 111.<br>
Mapping section 103 is constructed of pattern<br>
conversion section 151 and table storage section 152.<br>
On the other hand, demapping section 109 is constructed<br>
of pattern conversion section 161 and table storage<br>
section 162.<br>
In FIG.2, digital modulation section 101<br>
digital-modulates transmission data and outputs the<br>
modulated serial data to serial/parallel (S/P) conversion<br>
section 102. S/P conversion section 102 converts the<br>
serial data to parallel data and each data piece is assigned<br><br>
to a subcarrier and output to pattern conversion section<br>
151 of mapping section 103 as a symbol pattern before<br>
conversion.<br>
Pattern conversion section 151 converts a<br>
pre-conversion symbol pattern to a post-conversion symbol<br>
pattern and outputs this symbol pattern signal to IFFT<br>
section 104. Table storage section 152 stores<br>
information on the correspondence between pre-conversion<br>
symbol patterns and post-conversion symbol patterns and<br>
outputs the correspondence information according to a<br>
reference by pattern conversion section 151.<br>
IFFT section 104 performs an inverse fast Fourier<br>
transform on the post-conversion symbol pattern and<br>
outputs the transmission signal after the inverse fast<br>
Fourier transform to radio transmission section 105.<br>
Radio transmission section 105 converts the transmission<br>
signal from digital to analog, up-converts and sends the<br>
signal via antenna 106 as a radio signal.<br>
A radio signal received via antenna 106 is<br>
down-converted by radio reception section 107 , converted<br>
from analog to digital and output to FFT section 108.<br>
FFT section 108 carries out fast Fourier transform on<br>
the received signal into received symbol pattern data<br>
and outputs this received symbol pattern to pattern<br>
conversion section 161 of demapping section 109.<br>
Pattern conversion section 161 converts the<br>
received symbol pattern data to a pre-conversion symbol<br>
pattern and outputs to P/S conversion section 110. Table<br><br>
storage section 162 stores information on the<br>
correspondence between received symbol patterns and<br>
pre-conversion symbol patterns and outputs the<br>
correspondence information according to a reference by<br>
pattern conversion section 161.<br>
P/S conversion section 110 converts the<br>
pre-conversion symbol pattern from parallel to serial,<br>
unites signals of the respective subcarriers into serial<br>
data and outputs to digital demodulation section 111.<br>
Digital demodulation section 111 demodulates serial data<br>
and outputs reception data.<br>
Then, a transmission operation of the multi-carrier<br>
communication apparatus in the above-described<br>
configuration will be explained.<br>
Transmission data is subjected to BPSK modulation<br>
by digital modulation section 101 and subjected to<br>
serial-parallel conversion by S/P conversion section 102.<br>
This data is output to pattern conversion section 151<br>
as a pre-conversion symbol pattern.<br>
A pre-conversion symbol pattern is converted by<br>
pattern conversion section 151 from a symbol pattern<br>
taking two types of values " + 1" and "-1" to a symbol pattern<br>
taking three types of values " + 1", " -1" and "0" and output<br>
to IFFT section 104 as a post-conversion symbol pattern.<br>
The conversion operation will be explained in further<br>
detail later.<br>
A post-conversion symbol pattern is subjected to<br>
an inverse fast Fourier transform by IFFT section 104<br><br>
and the signal after inverse fast Fourier transform is<br>
output to radio transmission section 105. The signal<br>
after inverse fast Fourier transform is converted by radio<br>
transmission section 105 from digital to analog,<br>
up-converted and sent via antenna 106 as a radio signal.<br>
A received signal is subjected to a fast Fourier<br>
transform by FFT section 108 and then output to pattern<br>
conversion section 161 of demapping section 109. A<br>
post-conversion symbol pattern is converted by pattern<br>
conversion section 161 from a symbol pattern taking three<br>
types of values "+1", "-1" and "0" to a symbol pattern<br>
taking two types of values "+1" and "-1" and output to<br>
P/S conversion section 110 as a pre-conversion symbol<br>
pattern. The conversion operation will be explained in<br>
further detail later.<br>
The demapped symbol data is converted by P/S<br>
conversion section 110 to serial data and output to digital<br>
demodulation section 111. Digital demodulation section<br>
111 performs digital demodulation processing on the<br>
serial data to obtain reception data.<br>
Then, an OFDM symbol conversion operation at pattern<br>
conversion section 151 will be explained.<br>
Since each subcarrier on which each OFDM symbol is<br>
superimposed at IFFT section 104 has either a positive<br>
(+) or negative (-) value, it is known that there are<br>
2N combinations of IOFDM symbol patterns of OFDM signals<br>
made up of N subcarriers. Here, the positive (+) and<br>
negative (-) values are expressed as "+1" and "-1"<br><br>
respectively.<br>
The present invention selects r out of N subcarriers,<br>
modulates the r subcarriers and sends amplitude [0] for<br>
the rest (N-r) subcarriers (sends nothing). The number<br>
of patterns for selecting r out of N subcarriers is<br>
calculated with NCr.<br>
r subcarriers give either positive or negative<br>
values. In this case, there are NCr•2r ways of expression<br>
for 1 OFDM symbol. While each subcarrier of a<br>
conventional multi-carrier communication has either a<br>
positive or negative value, each subcarrier of the<br>
multi-carrier communication of the present invention can<br>
also take "0", and therefore there can be cases where<br>
there is a large signal space, that is, NCr•2r &gt; 2N.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to suppress peak power<br>
by selecting 2N out of NCr•2r symbols in ascending order<br>
of peak power and mapping them from conventional OFDM<br>
symbols to OFDM symbols according to the system of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Then, an example of OFDM symbol conversion will be<br>
explained using FIG.3 to FIG.5.<br>
Here, an example of converting an OFDM symbol made<br>
up of 4 subcarriers to a symbol pattern including amplitude<br>
"0" for one of the 4 subcarriers will be explained.<br>
FIG.3 illustrates pre-conversion OFDM symbol<br>
patterns made up of 4 subcarriers in BPSK modulation.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates post-conversion OFDM symbol patterns<br>
whose one of 4 subcarriers in BPSK modulation is in a<br><br>
state of amplitude "0".<br>
The conventional OFDM symbol patterns made up of<br>
4 subcarriers are constructed of 16 combination as shown<br>
in FIG.3. On the other hand, as shown in FIG.4, there<br>
are 32 combinations of new OFDM symbol patterns whose<br>
one subcarrier is in a state of amplitude "0". Inclusion<br>
of a state of amplitude "0" makes it possible to create<br>
new OFDM symbol patterns with smaller peak power than<br>
conventional OFDM symbol patterns and new OFDM symbol<br>
patterns with greater peak power than conventional OFDM<br>
symbol patterns.<br>
FIG.5 illustrates an example of a table of<br>
correspondence between pre-conversion symbol patterns<br>
and post-conversion symbol patterns in pattern conversion<br>
section 151. This example describes mapping where there<br>
is correspondence between PNl and PI, between PN2 and<br>
P3, ..., between PN16 and P31 in both symbol patterns for<br>
the sake of clarity. In FIG.5, f1 to f4 indicate<br>
subcarrier frequencies.<br>
In the correspondence table shown in FIG.5, OFDM<br>
symbol pattern PN1( + 1, +1, +1, +1) corresponds to OFDM<br>
symbol pattern P1(+1, +1, +1, 0). OFDM symbol pattern<br>
PN2 ( + 1, +1, +1, -1) corresponds to OFDM symbol pattern<br>
P3 (+1, -1, +1, 0). OFDM symbol pattern PN3 (+1, +1, -1,<br>
+1) corresponds to OFDM symbol pattern P5 (-1, +1, -1,<br>
0).<br>
In this way, through the above-described mapping<br>
operation, pattern conversion section 151 converts OFDM<br><br>
symbol patterns from PNl, PN2, PN3, •••, PN16 to symbol<br>
patterns Pi, P3, P5, •••, P31 which are symbol patterns<br>
with smaller peak power. These OFDM symbols with small<br>
peak power are output to IFFT section 104.<br>
On the other hand, pattern conversion section 161<br>
of demapping section 109 carries out processing opposite<br>
the processing by pattern conversion section 151 at<br>
mapping section 103. That is, pattern conversion section<br>
161 converts from a 3-value symbol pattern with "+l",<br>
"-1" and "0" to a 2-value symbol pattern with "+1" and<br>
"-1" using the correspondence table shown in FIG.5.<br>
The above-described mapping processing selects 16<br>
patterns from among 32 new OFDM symbol patterns in<br>
ascending order of peak power and converts from 16<br>
conventional OFDM symbol patterns, and can thereby<br>
further decrease peak power.<br>
Thus, the multi-carrier communication apparatus of<br>
this embodiment adopts a configuration of a transmission<br>
apparatus in which each OFDM symbol (first OFDM symbol<br>
group) converted to parallel after digital modulation<br>
is output to the mapping section, where, of a plurality<br>
of subcarriers fl to f4 on which the first OFDM symbol<br>
group is superimposed at the time of inverse fast Fourier<br>
transform, OFDM symbols superimposed on a predetermined<br>
number of subcarriers are set to "0", thereby the OFDM<br>
symbol space is expanded, as many OFDM symbols as symbols<br>
of the first OFDM symbol group are selected in ascending<br>
order of peak power, this selected OFDM symbol is<br><br>
associated with the first OFDM symbol group, the<br>
associated and selected OFDM symbols are output and these<br>
selected OFDM symbols are subjected to an inverse fast<br>
Fourier transform.<br>
That is, setting some of subcarriers f1to f4 to<br>
amplitude [ 0 ] increases the number of OFDM symbol patterns,<br>
that is, expands the signal space, and therefore if only<br>
a necessary number of symbol patterns are selected from<br>
among these symbol patterns in ascending order of peak<br>
power and used for transmission, symbol patterns with<br>
great peak power are not used with the result that it<br>
is possible to suppress peak voltages of signals with<br>
a simple apparatus configuration without deteriorating<br>
transmission characteristics nor increasing unnecessary<br>
out-of-band emissions nor increasing the size of the<br>
apparatus.<br>
Furthermore, the reception apparatus is constructed<br>
in such a way that reception OFDM symbols from the<br>
transmission apparatus subjected to an inverse fast<br>
Fourier transform are subjected to a fast Fourier<br>
transform, each OFDM symbol obtained by this transform<br>
is collated by the demapping section with first pattern<br>
data equivalent to the selected OFDM symbol at the<br>
transmission apparatus, the matched OFDM symbol in this<br>
collation is associated with the second pattern data<br>
equivalent to the first OFDM symbol group at the<br>
above-described transmitting means, the OFDM symbol<br>
obtained by this association is converted to serial data<br><br>
and this serial data is demodulated. This makes it<br>
possible to correctly demodulate an OFDM symbol from the<br>
transmission apparatus.<br>
Then, another example of mapping according to the<br>
present invention will be explained. Here, an operation<br>
of mapping a pre-conversion OFDM symbol made up of 5<br>
subcarriers to a post-conversion OFDM symbol made up of<br>
4 subcarriers will be explained.<br>
FIG.6 shows combinations of pre-conversion OFDM<br>
symbol patterns made up of 5 subcarriers. These<br>
pre-conversion OFDM symbol patterns consist of 32<br>
combinations.<br>
As described above, FIG.4 shows combinations of<br>
post-conversion OFDM symbols in a case where one out of<br>
four subcarriers can take an amplitude value of "0".<br>
These OFDM symbols consist of 32 combinations. Therefore,<br>
32 pre-conversion OFDM patterns having 5 subcarriers can<br>
have a one-to-one correspondence with the 32<br>
post-conversion OFDM patterns.<br>
That is, as shown in FIG.7, pre-conversion OFDM<br>
symbol pattern (+1, +1, +1, +1, +1) corresponds to<br>
post-conversion OFDM symbol pattern (+1, +1, +1, 0).<br>
Pre-conversion OFDM symbol pattern (+1, +1, +1, +1, -l)<br>
corresponds to post-conversion OFDM symbol pattern (+1,<br>
+ 1, -1, 0). Pre-conversion OFDM symbol pattern (+1, +1,<br>
+1, -1, +1) corresponds to post-conversion OFDM symbol<br>
pattern(+1, -1,+1, 0). Likewise, 3 2 pre-conversion OFDM<br>
symbol patterns have a one-to-one correspondence with<br><br>
32 post-conversion OFDM symbol patterns.<br>
Pattern conversion section 151 converts OFDM symbol<br>
patterns according to the correspondence table shown in<br>
FIG. 7 and converts a pre-conversion OFDM symbol made up<br>
of five subcarriers to a post-conversion OFDM symbol made<br>
up of four subcarriers.<br>
Ontheother and, whena post-conversion OFDM symbol<br>
made up of four subcarriers is demapped to a pre-conversion<br>
OFDM symbol made up of five subcarriers, pattern<br>
conversion section 161 of demapping section 109 converts<br>
symbol patterns according to the correspondence table<br>
shown in FIG. 7 and converts a post-conversion OFDM symbol<br>
made up of four subcarriers to a pre-conversion OFDM symbol<br>
made up of five subcarriers.<br>
According to such a mapping method, using symbol<br>
patterns including amplitude "0" for subcarriers<br>
suppresses peak power and at the same time increases the<br>
number of symbol patterns per 1 OFDM, that is, expands<br>
the signal space, and can thereby increase the amount<br>
of data per 1 OFDM and realize high-speed transmission.<br>
Thus, according to the multi-carrier communication<br>
apparatus of this embodiment, some subcarriers are set<br>
to amplitude [0], the number of symbol data patterns<br>
increases, that is, the symbol data space expands, and<br>
therefore symbol patterns with large peak power are not<br>
used. As a result, it is possible to suppress peak<br>
voltages of signals with a simple apparatus configuration<br>
without deteriorating the transmission characteristics<br><br>
or increasing the size of the apparatus.<br>
Furthermore, the multi-carrier communication<br>
apparatus of this embodiment carries out transmission<br>
with a first symbol string including a first symbol with<br>
at least one of the amplitudes of an in-phase component<br>
and quadrature component set to " 0", and can thereby carry<br>
out multi-carrier communications with suppressed peak<br>
power.<br>
Furthermore, the multi-carrier communication<br>
apparatus of this embodiment can easily collate the first<br>
and second symbol patterns and perform efficient<br>
demapping. This makes it possible to correctly<br>
demodulate symbol data of multi-carrier signals<br>
transmitted.<br>
Furthermore, the multi-carrier communication<br>
apparatus of this embodiment can easily collate the first<br>
and second symbol patterns and perform efficient mapping.<br>

FIG.8 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a multi-carrier communication apparatus according to<br>
Embodiment 2 of the present invention. However, the same<br>
components as those in Embodiment 1 are assigned the same<br>
reference numerals and detailed explanations thereof are<br>
omitted.<br>
According to this embodiment, demapping section 201<br>
is constructed of pattern collation section 251 that<br>
collates symbol patterns, table storage section 252 that<br><br>
stores a symbol pattern correspondence table,<br>
retransmission requesting section 253 that requests<br>
retransmission when no matched symbol patterns are found<br>
and pattern conversion section 254 that converts symbol<br>
patterns, and this embodiment will describe a case where<br>
retransmission is requested when some error is detected<br>
in the symbol data.<br>
An operation of the multi-carrier communication<br>
apparatus according to Embodiment 2 of the present<br>
invention will be explained using FIG.8 below.<br>
A radio signal is input to radio reception section<br>
107 via antenna 106, down-converted and analog/digital<br>
converted by radio reception section 107, subjected to<br>
a fast Fourier transform by FFT section 108 and output<br>
to pattern collation section 251 of the demapping section<br>
as reception OFDM symbol data.<br>
Pattern collation section 251 checks whether the<br>
reception OFDM symbol data is a symbol pattern or not<br>
with reference to the correspondence table in table<br>
storage section 252 and outputs the reception OFDM symbol<br>
to pattern conversion section 254 when any matched symbol<br>
pattern is found and instructs retransmission requesting<br>
section 253 to request for retransmission of the symbol<br>
when no matched symbol patterns are found.<br>
Retransmission requesting section 253 outputs a<br>
control signal requesting retransmission to digital<br>
modulation section 101 according to the instruction from<br>
pattern collation section 251. Furthermore, pattern<br><br>
conversion section 254 references the correspondence<br>
table and converts the reception OFDM symbol data to a<br>
pre-conversion OFDM symbol and outputs to P/S conversion<br>
section 110.<br>
Error detection at the multi-carrier communication<br>
apparatus in FIG.8 will be explained.<br>
A radio signal is input to radio reception section<br>
107 through antenna 106, down-converted and<br>
analog/digital converted by radio reception section 107,<br>
subjected to a fast Fourier transform by FFT section 108<br>
and output to pattern collation section 251 as received<br>
symbol data.<br>
Pattern collation section 251 checks whether the<br>
received symbol data is a symbol pattern that corresponds<br>
to (is used in) table storage section 252 or not. Since<br>
this reception OFDM symbol uses symbol patterns including<br>
amplitude "0" for subcarriers, there are more patterns<br>
than normal OFDM symbol patterns and there are also some<br>
unmatched (unused) symbol patterns.<br>
When there are no matched symbol patterns, it is<br>
decided that this symbol is not correct information and<br>
a symbol retransmission request is output to<br>
retransmission requesting section 253. When there is any<br>
matched symbol pattern, the reception OFDM symbol is<br>
output to pattern conversion section 254.<br>
A retransmission request instruction is output by<br>
retransmission requesting section 253 to digital<br>
modulation section 101 as a retransmission request signal<br><br>
and sent to the apparatus on the transmitting side together<br>
with transmission data. A radio signal resent by a<br>
retransmission request is output to demapping section<br>
201 as a reception OFDM symbol and it is rechecked whether<br>
the reception OFDM symbol is a symbol pattern supported<br>
in table storage section 252 or not.<br>
The reception OFDM symbol output to pattern<br>
conversion section 254 is converted to serial data by<br>
P/S conversion section 110 and demodulated to reception<br>
data by digital demodulation section 111.<br>
Thus, the multi-carrier communication apparatus of<br>
this embodiment can receive symbol data free of errors<br>
through retransmission even if errors occur in the<br>
received symbol data during transmission.<br>
(Embodiment 3)<br>
This embodiment will describe a case where error<br>
correction is performed when a reception OFDM symbol<br>
contains errors.<br>
FIG. 9 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a multi-carrier communication apparatus according to<br>
Embodiment 3 of the present invention. However, the same<br>
components as those in Embodiment 1 are assigned the same<br>
reference numerals and detailed explanations thereof are<br>
omitted.<br>
In the configuration shown in FIG.9, demapping<br>
section 301 is constructed of pattern collation section<br>
351 that checks symbol patterns with reference to a<br><br>
correspondence table, table storage section 352 that<br>
stores a symbol pattern correspondence table, error<br>
correcting section 353 that corrects erroneous symbol<br>
patterns and pattern conversion section 354 that converts<br>
symbol patterns according to the correspondence table.<br>
Pattern collation section 351 checks whether a<br>
reception OFDM symbol is a symbol pattern supported in<br>
the correspondence table stored in table storage section<br>
352 or not and outputs the reception OFDM symbol to pattern<br>
conversion section 354 when any matched symbol pattern<br>
is found and error correcting section 353 corrects errors<br>
of the symbol when no matched symbol patterns are found.<br>
Error correcting section 353 performs error correction<br>
by, for example, comparing an erroneous OFDM symbol<br>
pattern and a symbol pattern in the correspondence table<br>
stored in table storage section 352, selects the most<br>
resembling symbol pattern as the symbol pattern after<br>
error correction.<br>
Pattern conversion section 354 converts reception<br>
OFDM symbol data to a pre-conversion OFDM symbol and<br>
outputs to P/S conversion section 110.<br>
Error correction in a multi-carrier communication<br>
will be explained using FIG.9.<br>
A radio signal is input to radio reception section<br>
107 through antenna 106, down-converted and<br>
analog/digital converted by radio reception section 107,<br>
subjected to a fast Fourier transform by FFT section 108<br>
and output to pattern collation section 351 as received<br><br>
symbol data.<br>
Pattern collation section 351 checks whether the<br>
received symbol data is a symbol pattern supported in<br>
table storage section 352 or not. When the symbol pattern<br>
is not supported, it is decided that this symbol is not<br>
a correct symbol and output to error correcting section<br>
353. Error correcting section 353 selects a symbol<br>
pattern resembling the symbol pattern input as an error<br>
and outputs to pattern conversion section 354. When the<br>
collation result shows that the symbol pattern is<br>
supported, the reception OFDM symbol is output to pattern<br>
conversion section 354.<br>
The reception OFDM symbol output to pattern<br>
conversion section 354 is converted to serial data by<br>
P/S conversion section 110 and demodulated to reception<br>
data by digital demodulation section 111.<br>
Thus, the multi-carrier communication apparatus of<br>
this embodiment can receive symbol data free of errors<br>
by carrying out error correction even if errors occur<br>
in the received symbol data during transmission, etc.<br>
(Embodiment 4)<br>
FIG.10 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a multi-carrier communication apparatus according to<br>
Embodiment 4 of the present invention. However, the same<br>
components as those in Embodiment 1 are assigned the same<br>
reference numerals and detailed explanations thereof are<br>
omitted.<br><br>
In FIG.10, demapping section 401 is constructed of<br>
reception level measuring section 451, signal decision<br>
section 452, pattern conversion section 453 and table<br>
storage section 454.<br>
Reception level measuring section 451 measures the<br>
reception level of each subcarrier of the reception OFDM<br>
symbol output from FFT section 108 and outputs the result<br>
to signal decision section 452.<br>
Signal decision section 452 performs hard decision<br>
on the symbol according to the reception level of each<br>
subcarrier and outputs this hard decision result to<br>
pattern conversion section 453. Pattern conversion<br>
section 453 performs pattern conversion on the symbol<br>
pattern composed according to the hard decision result<br>
with reference to the correspondence table stored in table<br>
storage section 454. Pattern conversion section 453<br>
outputs the OFDM symbol pattern subjected to pattern<br>
conversion to P/S conversion section 110.<br>
Then, an operation of the multi-carrier<br>
communication apparatus according to Embodiment 4 will<br>
be explained.<br>
A radio signal sent from an apparatus on the<br>
transmitting side is down-converted by radio reception<br>
section 107, converted from analog to digital, subjected<br>
to a fast Fourier transform by FFT section 108 and output<br>
to reception level measuring section 451 as received<br>
symbol data.<br>
Reception level measuring section 451 measures the<br><br>
reception level of the symbol and outputs the result to<br>
signal decision section 452. Signal decision section 452<br>
performs hard decision on the received symbol data by<br>
comparing the reception level with a threshold and decides<br>
the symbol pattern. This symbol pattern is output to<br>
pattern conversion section 453 as post-conversion symbol<br>
data. This hard decision will be described later.<br>
The post-conversion symbol data is converted by<br>
pattern conversion section 453 to pre-conversion symbol<br>
data according to the correspondence table stored in table<br>
storage section 454. On the other hand, the<br>
pre-conversion symbol data is converted to parallel data<br>
by P/S conversion section 110 and demodulated to reception<br>
data by digital demodulation section 111.<br>
Next, an example of symbol pattern decision<br>
operation by signal decision section 452 will be explained.<br>
Here, a case will be explained where a decision is made<br>
on a symbol pattern having two values "+1" and "-1"<br>
converted to a symbol pattern having three values "+1",<br>
"-1" and "0" and at the same time a symbol pattern is<br>
(+1, -1, 0, -1).<br>
Signal decision section 452 decides a 3-value symbol<br>
pattern according to the reception level, and therefore<br>
decides three values using two thresholds of "1/3" and<br>
"-1/3 " as shown in FIG. 11. Thus, when the reception level<br>
is greater than threshold "1/3", the symbol pattern is<br>
decided to be "+1", when the reception level is smaller<br>
than threshold "-1/3", the symbol pattern is decided to<br><br>
be "-1" and when the reception level is smaller than<br>
threshold "1/3" and greater than "-1/3", the symbol<br>
pattern is decided to be "0"<br>
That is, the reception level of the symbol pattern<br>
of subcarrier f 1 is "1.1" which is greater than threshold<br>
"1/3", and therefore the symbol pattern is decided to<br>
be "+1". The reception level of the symbol pattern of<br>
subcarrier f2 is "-0.8" which is smaller than threshold<br>
"-1/3", and therefore the symbol pattern is decided to<br>
be "-1". The reception level of the symbol pattern of<br>
subcarrier f3 is "0.1" which is smaller than threshold<br>
"1/3" and greater than threshold "-1/3" and therefore<br>
the symbol pattern is decided to be "0". The reception<br>
level of the symbol pattern of subcarrier f4 is "-0.4"<br>
which is smaller than threshold "--1/3", and therefore<br>
the symbol pattern is decided to be " -1". Symbol patterns<br>
are decided in this way.<br>
Thus, performing hard decision on symbols of a symbol<br>
pattern based on the reception level with two thresholds<br>
makes it possible to decide a digital signal with three<br>
values. This allows accurate decision of a new symbol<br>
pattern with three values.<br>
Thus, the multi-carrier communication apparatus of<br>
this embodiment allows accurate decision of a symbol<br>
pattern including symbols with amplitude "0".<br>
Then, another example of symbol pattern decision<br>
operation by signal decision section 452 will be explained.<br>
Here, a case will be explained where a decision is made<br><br>
on a symbol pattern with two values " + 1" and " -1" converted<br>
to a symbol pattern with three values of "+1", "-1" and "0"<br>
and at the same time a symbol pattern is (+1, -1, 0, -1).<br>
In this decision, an apparatus on the transmitting<br>
side notifies symbol pattern information on the number<br>
of amplitude "0"s included in a symbol pattern. Signal<br>
decision section 452 makes a first decision assigning<br>
a value "0" to a symbol whose reception level is close<br>
to a value " 0" according to this symbol pattern information<br>
first. Then, signal decision section 452 only decides<br>
the polarity of the reception level for the remaining<br>
symbols and makes a second decision assigning values " + 1"<br>
and "-1". it is also possible to predetermine the number<br>
of amplitude "0"s included in the symbol pattern making<br>
notification of symbol pattern information unnecessary.<br>
More specifically, as shown in FIG. 12, when a symbol<br>
pattern of one of four subcarriers composing symbol<br>
patterns takes a value "0", that is, when the apparatus<br>
on the transmitting side sends a control signal indicating<br>
that there is one symbol taking the "0" value as symbol<br>
pattern information, f3 whose absolute value of the<br>
reception level is the smallest is decided to be "0".<br>
Since there is only one symbol pattern of a value<br>
"0", it is possible to decide the remaining subcarrier<br>
symbols based on the polarity of the reception level.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to decide fl as "+1", f2 as<br>
"-1" and f4 as "-1". Thus, a symbol pattern is decided<br>
by making a two-stage decision, that is, making a decision<br><br>
on the amplitude for known " 0" symbols and making a polarity-<br>
decision for other symbols. An amplitude decision here<br>
refers to a decision on a symbol absolute value or polarity<br>
and refers to a decision on "+1", "0" and "-1" in this<br>
case. Furthermore, a polarity decision simply refers to<br>
an act of deciding polarity.<br>
Likewise, when m out of n subcarrier symbols take<br>
values "0"s, the absolute values of reception levels are<br>
compared and M symbols in ascending order of those values<br>
are decided to be "0" and the remaining (n-m) symbols<br>
are decided to be " + 1" or "-1" depending on the polarity<br>
of the reception level. Symbol patterns are decided in<br>
this way.<br>
As shown above, the multi-carrier communication<br>
apparatus of this embodiment can accurately decide symbol<br>
patterns including symbols of amplitude "0" by a first<br>
decision and only needs to make a polarity decision to<br>
decide other symbols, making it possible to make a more<br>
accurate decision on symbol patterns.<br>
(Embodiment 5)<br>
This embodiment will describe a case where a<br>
plurality of OFDM symbol patterns are associated with<br>
conventional OFDM symbol patterns.<br>
FIG.13 illustrates an example of a table of<br>
correspondence between pre-conversion symbol patterns<br>
and post-conversion symbol patterns at pat tern conversion<br>
section 151 in FIG.2. This example describes mapping<br><br>
where there is correspondence between PN1 and P1or P2,<br>
between PN2 and P3 or P4, •••, between PN16 and P31 or P32<br>
in both symbol patterns forthesakeof clarity. In FIG. 13,<br>
f1 to f4 indicate subcarrier frequencies.<br>
In the correspondence table shown in FIG.13, OFDM<br>
symbol pattern PNl (+1, +1, +1, +1) corresponds to OFDM<br>
symbol pattern PI (+1, +1, + 1, 0) or P2 (+1, +1, -1, 0).<br>
OFDM symbol pattern PN2 (+1, +1, +1, -1) corresponds to<br>
OFDM symbol pattern P3 (+1, -1, +1, 0) or P4 (+1, -1,<br>
-1, 0). OFDM symbol pattern PN3 (+1, +1, -1, +1)<br>
corresponds to OFDM symbol pattern P5 (-1, +1, +1, 0)<br>
or P6 (-1, +1, -1, 0).<br>
In this way, through the above-described mapping<br>
operation, pattern conversion section 151 converts OFDM<br>
symbol patterns from PNl, PN2, PN3, •••, PN16 to symbol<br>
patterns Pi, P3, P5, P7, P9, Pll,-, P31 or P2, P4, P6,<br>
P8, P10, P12, •••, P32. These OFDM symbols are output to<br>
IFFT section 104.<br>
On the other hand, pattern conversion section 161<br>
of demapping section 109 in FIG.2 carries out processing<br>
opposite the processing by pattern conversion section<br>
151 at mapping section 103. That is, pattern conversion<br>
section 161 converts from a symbol pattern with three<br>
values " + 1", " -1" and " 0" to a symbol pattern with 2 values<br>
"+1" and "-1" using the correspondence table shown in<br>
FIG.13.<br>
For example, when subcarrier f3 of symbol pattern<br>
P1 (+1, +1, +1, 0) converted from symbol pattern PNl (+1,<br><br>
+ 1, +1, +1) is changed to P2 (+1, +1, -1, 0) due to influence<br>
of fading, etc., symbol P2 ( + 1, +1, -1, 0) is converted<br>
to symbol pattern PN1 (1, +1, +1, +1) and can be received<br>
as a correct symbol pattern.<br>
Thus, when errors occur in the transmitted symbol<br>
due to influence such as fading, the multi-carrier<br>
communication apparatus of this embodiment can receive<br>
a correct symbol by receiving it as one of a plurality<br>
of symbols corresponding to the transmitted data.<br>
A plurality of OFDM symbol patterns corresponding<br>
to conventional OFDM symbol patterns can also be<br>
associated with patterns whose Euclidean distance between<br>
symbols is smaller than that between other OFDM symbol<br>
patterns.<br>
In this case, by associating symbol patterns whose<br>
Euclidean distance is smaller with one conventional OFDM<br>
pattern, it is possible to distinguish from other symbols<br>
even if symbols change due to influences of the path such<br>
as fading.<br>
(Embodiment 6)<br>
This embodiment will describe a case where a<br>
conventional OFDM symbol pattern is associated with a<br>
plurality of OFDM symbol patterns and a plurality of<br>
corresponding OFDM symbol patterns is transmitted<br>
alternately.<br>
FIG.14 illustrates an example of a symbol pattern<br>
correspondence table before and after conversion by<br><br>
pattern conversion section 151 in FIG.2. This example<br>
describes mapping where there is correspondence between<br>
PNl and PI or P9, between PN2 and P3 or P11, •••, between<br>
PN16 and P31 or P24 in both symbol patterns for the sake<br>
of clarity. In FIG.14, f1 to f4 indicate subcarrier<br>
frequencies.<br>
In the correspondence table shown in FIG.14, OFDM<br>
symbol pattern PN1 (+1, +1, +1, +1) corresponds to OFDM<br>
symbol pattern P1 (+1, +1, +1, 0) or P9 (+1, +1, 0, +1).<br>
OFDM symbol pattern PN2 (+1, +1, +1, -1) corresponds to<br>
OFDM symbol pattern P3 (+1, -1, +1, 0) or Pll (+1, -1,<br>
0, +1). OFDM symbol pattern PN3 (+1, +1, -1, +1)<br>
corresponds to OFDM symbol pattern P5 (-1, +1, -1, 0)<br>
or P13 (-1, +1, 0, +1).<br>
In this way, through the above-described mapping<br>
operation, pattern conversion section 151 converts OFDM<br>
symbol patterns from PNl, PN2, PN3, •••, PN16 to symbol<br>
patterns PI, P3, P5, P7, •••, P32 and through the next symbol<br>
conversion operation, pattern conversion section 151<br>
converts OFDM symbol patterns from PNl, PN2, PN3, •••, PN16<br>
to symbol patterns P9, Pll, P13, P15, •••, P24. Then,<br>
pattern conversion section 151 outputs this OFDM symbol<br>
to IFFT section 104.<br>
On the other hand, pattern conversion section 161<br>
of demapping section 109 in FIG.2 carries out processing<br>
opposite the processing by pattern conversion section<br>
151 at mapping section 103. That is, pattern conversion<br>
section 161 converts from a symbol pattern wit 3 values<br><br>
" + 1", "-1" and "0" to a symbol pattern with 2 values " + l"<br>
and "-1" using the correspondence table shown in FIG.14.<br>
Thus, 16 conventional OFDM symbol patterns are<br>
converted to 16 patterns out of 32 new OFDM symbol patterns<br>
and sent and the received symbols are converted from the<br>
32 OFDM symbol patterns to 16 conventional OFDM symbol<br>
patterns. First, the corresponding symbol patterns are<br>
sent from among P1, P3, P5, P7, •••, P32 and then the<br>
corresponding symbol patterns are sent from among P9,<br>
P11, P13, P15, •••, P24 and then the corresponding symbol<br>
patterns are sent from among P1, P3, P5, P7, •••, P32.<br>
Thus, the multi-carrier communication apparatus of<br>
this embodiment sends symbols by alternately associating<br>
the symbols with different positions of subcarriers<br>
having amplitude "0" and the positions of subcarriers<br>
having "0" change among patterns to be sent consecutively,<br>
and therefore it is possible to reduce interference among<br>
symbols.<br>
By the way, the method of selecting symbol patterns<br>
to be sent out of a plurality of symbol patterns<br>
corresponding to the conventional OFDM symbol patterns<br>
is not limited to the above-described method.<br>
For example, it is also possible to select symbol<br>
patterns from among a plurality of symbol patterns<br>
corresponding to the conventional OFDM symbol patterns<br>
using random numbers and send those symbol patterns.<br>
(Embodiment 7)<br><br>
This embodiment will describe a case where a<br>
plurality of subcarriers with amplitude "0" is combined<br>
and used as a single pattern.<br>
FIG.15 illustrates new OFDM symbol patterns.<br>
This OFDM symbol pattern made up of 6 subcarriers<br>
consists of 64 symbol patterns and FIG.15 shows 16 out<br>
of 64 symbol patterns. This symbol pattern includes a<br>
set of two subcarriers having amplitude "0".<br>
FIG.16 illustrates an example of a table of<br>
correspondence before and after conversion by pattern<br>
conversion section 151. This example describes mapping<br>
where there is correspondence between PNl and P101,<br>
between PN2 and P102, •••, between PN16 and P116 in both<br>
symbol patterns for the sake of clarity. In FIG.16, f1<br>
to f6 indicate subcarrier frequencies.<br>
In the correspondence table shown in FIG.16, OFDM<br>
symbol pattern PNl (+1, +1, + 1, +1) corresponds to OFDM<br>
symbol pattern P101 (+1, +1, 0, +1, +1, 0). OFDM symbol<br>
pattern PN2 ( + 1, +1, +1, -1) corresponds to OFDM symbol<br>
pattern P102 (+1, +1, 0, +1, -1, 0). OFDM symbol pattern<br>
PN3 (+1, +1, -1, +1) corresponds to OFDM symbol pattern<br>
P103 (+1, +1, 0, -1, + 1, 0).<br>
These OFDM symbol patterns use a set of two<br>
subcarriers with amplitude "0". For example, there can<br>
be a symbol pattern with subcarriers fl and f4 having<br>
amplitude value "0", a symbol pattern with subcarriers<br>
f2 and f5 having amplitude value "0" and a symbol pattern<br>
with subcarriers f3 and f6 having amplitude value "0".<br><br>
In this way, through the above-described mapping<br>
operation, pattern conversion section 151 converts OFDM<br>
symbol patterns from PN1, PN2, PN3, •••, PN16 to symbol<br>
patterns P101, P102, P103, •••, P116. Then, pattern<br>
conversion section 151 outputs this OFDM symbol to IFFT<br>
section 104.<br>
On the other hand, pattern conversion section 161<br>
of demapping section 109 carries out processing opposite<br>
the processing by pattern conversion section 151 at<br>
mapping section 103. That is, pattern conversion section<br>
161 converts from a symbol pattern with 3 values "+1",<br>
"-1" and "0" to a symbol pattern with 2 values " + 1" and<br>
"-1" using the correspondence table shown in FIG.16.<br>
Thus, the multi-carrier communication apparatus of<br>
this embodiment converts 16 conventional OFDM symbol<br>
patterns to 16 new OFDM symbol patterns, send these symbol<br>
patterns and converts the received symbols from the 16<br>
OFDM symbol patterns to 16 conventional OFDM symbol<br>
patterns and sends any one of symbol patterns P101, P102,<br>
P103, P104, •••, P116.<br>
For example, when symbol pattern P101 (+1, +1, 0,<br>
+1, +1, 0) is sent, some subcarrier values are changed<br>
due to influences of the path and these are received on<br>
the receiving side with a symbol pattern of ( + 1, +1, 0,<br>
0, +1, 0), combinations of subcarriers whose amplitude<br>
is decided to be "0" are compared.<br>
The combination between subcarriers f 1 and f4 takes<br>
values "+1" and "0", the combination between subcarriers<br><br>
f3 and f6 takes values "0" and "0", and the multi-carrier<br>
communication apparatus decides the symbol pattern with<br>
the combination of subcarriers f 3 and f 6 having amplitude<br>
"0" as the most appropriate symbol pattern received.<br>
Thus, the multi-carrier communication apparatus of<br>
this embodiment combines a plurality of subcarriers with<br>
amplitude "0" and use them as a single pattern and even<br>
if the signal is changed under the influence from the<br>
path such as fading, the multi-carrier communication<br>
apparatus can carry out communications with few errors<br>
by deciding from the positions of a plurality of<br>
subcarriers with amplitude "0".<br>
Furthermore, the reception apparatus is constructed<br>
in such as way that a reception OFDM symbol subjected<br>
to an inverse fast Fourier transform from the transmission<br>
apparatus is subjected to a fast Fourier transform, each<br>
transformed OFDM symbol obtained is checked by the<br>
demapping section against first pattern data equivalent<br>
to the selected OFDM symbol at the transmission apparatus,<br>
the matched OFDM symbol as a result of this check is<br>
associated with second pattern data equal to the first<br>
OFDM symbol group in the above-described transmitting<br>
means, this associated OFDM symbol is converted to serial<br>
data and this serial data is demodulated. This makes it<br>
possible to correctly demodulate an OFDM symbol from the<br>
transmission apparatus.<br>
(Embodiment 8)<br><br>
This embodiment will describe a case where a<br>
Euclidean distance between patterns is widened according<br>
to the positions of subcarriers with amplitude "0".<br>
A Euclidean distance is used as a standard to decide<br>
symbol patterns in a multi-carrier communication. The<br>
Euclidean distance between a symbol of a subcarrier with<br>
amplitude "+1" and a symbol with amplitude "-1" is 2.<br>
On the other hand, the Euclidean distance between<br>
a symbol with amplitude "0" and a symbol with amplitude<br>
"+1" is 1, while the Euclidean distance between a symbol<br>
with amplitude "0" and a symbol with amplitude "-1" is<br>
1, and therefore using a symbol pattern including<br>
amplitude "0" decreases the Euclidean distance between<br>
symbols, making a distinction between signals difficult<br>
and worsening the transmission characteristic.<br>
Thus, the transmission characteristic is improved<br>
using only symbol patterns whose Euclidean distance is<br>
at least 2.<br>
FIG. 17 illustrates an example where two symbols with<br>
amplitude "0" are placed on 8 subcarriers according to<br>
Embodiment 8 of the present invention.<br>
"0" in FIG.17 denotes amplitude "0" and "x" denotes<br>
amplitude " + 1" or "-1".<br>
Group 1 in pattern group 1 is a symbol pattern with<br>
amplitude "0" placed on subcarriers f7 and f8.<br>
For a symbol pattern that belongs to group 1, there<br>
is a difference between amplitude " + 1" and amplitude "-1"<br>
on at least one subcarrier of symbols of f1, f2, f3, f4,<br><br>
f5 and f6, and therefore symbol patterns that belong to<br>
group 1 have mutual Euclidean distances of at least 2.<br>
A symbol pattern that belongs to group 2 is a symbol<br>
pattern with symbols with amplitude "0" placed on<br>
subcarriers f5 and f6.<br>
For a symbol pattern that belongs to group 2, there<br>
is a difference between amplitude " + 1" and amplitude "-1"<br>
on at least one subcarrier of symbols of f1, f2, f3, f4,<br>
f7 and f8, and therefore symbol patterns that belong to<br>
group 2 have mutual Euclidean distances of at least 2.<br>
Since a symbol pattern that belongs to group 1<br>
differs from a symbol pattern that belongs to group 2<br>
in subcarriers on which two symbols of amplitude "0" are<br>
placed, symbol patterns that belong to different groups<br>
have a mutual Euclidean distance of at least 2.<br>
Then, an example of conversion of symbol patterns<br>
will be explained.<br>
FIG.18 illustrates an example of a table of<br>
correspondence between symbol patterns before and after<br>
conversion by the pattern conversion section 151<br>
according to Embodiment 8 of the present invention.<br>
This example describes mapping where there is<br>
correspondence between PN1 and P101, between PN2 and P102,<br>
•••, between PN256 and P356 in both symbol patterns for<br>
the sake of clarity. In FIG.18, fl to f8 indicate<br>
subcarrier frequencies.<br>
In the correspondence table shown in FIG.18, OFDM<br>
symbol pattern PN1 (+1, +1, +1, +1, +1, +1, +1, +1)<br><br>
corresponds to OFDM symbol pattern P101 (+1, +1, +1, + 1,<br>
+ 1, +1, 0, 0). OFDM symbol pattern PN2 ( + 1, +1, +1, + 1,<br>
+ 1, +1, +1, -1) corresponds to OFDM symbol pattern P102<br>
( + 1, +1, +1, +1, +1, -1, 0, 0). OFDM symbol pattern PN3<br>
( + 1, +1, +1, +1, +1, +1, -1, +1) corresponds to OFDM symbol<br>
pattern P103 (+1, +1, +1, +1, -1, +1, 0, 0).<br>
In this way, through the above-described mapping<br>
operation, pattern conversion section 151 converts OFDM<br>
symbol patterns from PNl, PN2, PN3, •••, PN256 to symbol<br>
patterns P101, P102, P103, •••, P356. These OFDM symbols<br>
are output to IFFT section 104.<br>
On the other hand, pattern conversion section 161<br>
of demapping section 109 carries out processing opposite<br>
the processing by pattern conversion section 151 at<br>
mapping section 103. That is, pattern conversion section<br>
161 converts from a symbol pattern with 3 values "+1",<br>
"-1" and "0" to a symbol pattern with 2 values " + 1" and<br>
"-1" using the correspondence table shown in FIG.18.<br>
Thus, the multi-carrier communication apparatus of<br>
this embodiment converts 256 conventional OFDM symbol<br>
patterns to 256 new OFDM symbol patterns, sends these<br>
OFDM symbol patterns and converts the received 256 OFDM<br>
symbol patterns to 256 conventional OFDM symbol patterns<br>
and sends any one of symbol patterns P101, P102, P103,<br>
P104,•••, P356.<br>
Thus, the multi-carrier communication apparatus of<br>
this embodiment associates symbol patterns having mutual<br>
Euclidean distances of a predetermined value or greater<br><br>
with different conventional data patterns, and can<br>
thereby distinguish a symbol from other symbols even if<br>
symbols change due to influences of the path such as fading.<br>
(Embodiment 9)<br>
FIG.19 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a multi-carrier communication apparatus according to<br>
Embodiment 9 of the present invention.<br>
The multi-carrier communication apparatus<br>
according to Embodiment 9 of the present invention is<br>
constructed of mapping section 501, digital modulation<br>
section 502, S/P conversion section 503, IFFT section<br>
504, radio transmission section 505, antenna 506, radio<br>
reception section 507, FFT section 508, P/S conversion<br>
section 509, digital demodulation section 510 and<br>
demapping section 511.<br>
Furthermore, mapping section 501 is constructed of<br>
pattern conversion section 551 and table storage section<br>
552.<br>
Furthermore, demapping section 511 is constructed<br>
of pattern conversion section 561 and table storage<br>
section 562.<br>
In FIG.19, pattern conversion section 551 converts<br>
transmission data expressed with two values to<br>
transmission data expressed with three values and outputs<br>
this transmission data to digital modulation section 502.<br>
Table storage section 552 stores information on the<br>
correspondence between patterns of transmission data<br><br>
expressed with two values and patterns of transmission<br>
data expressed with three values and outputs the<br>
correspondence information according to a reference by-<br>
pattern conversion section 551.<br>
Digital modulation section 502 digital-modulates<br>
the transmission data output from mapping section 501<br>
and outputs the modulated transmission symbol string to<br>
S/P conversion section 503. S/P conversion section 503<br>
converts transmission symbols from serial to parallel<br>
and assigns the transmission symbols to their respective<br>
subcarriers and outputs to IFFT section 504.<br>
IFFT section 504 performs an inverse fast Fourier<br>
transform on the transmission symbol and outputs the<br>
transmission signal after the inverse fast Fourier<br>
transform to radio transmission section 505. Radio<br>
transmission section 505 converts the transmission signal<br>
from digital to analog, up-converts and sends it via<br>
antenna 506 as a radio signal.<br>
A radio signal received via antenna 506 is<br>
down-converted and converted from analog to digital by<br>
radio reception section 107 and output to FFT section<br>
508. FFT section 508 carries out a fast Fourier transform<br>
on the received signal and outputs the received symbol<br>
obtained to P/S conversion section 509.<br>
P/S conversion section 509 converts the received<br>
symbol from parallel to serial, unites signals of<br>
respective subcarriers into a received symbol string and<br>
outputs to digital demodulation section 510. Digital<br><br>
demodulation section 510 demodulates the received symbol<br>
string and outputs the reception data obtained to pattern<br>
conversion section 561.<br>
Pattern conversion section 561 converts reception<br>
data expressed with three values to reception data<br>
expressed with two values and outputs. Table storage<br>
section 562 stores information on the correspondence<br>
between the reception data expressed with two values and<br>
reception data expressed with three values and outputs<br>
the correspondence information according to a reference<br>
by pattern conversion section 561.<br>
Then, a transmission operation of the multi-carrier<br>
communication apparatus in the above-described<br>
configuration will be explained.<br>
Pattern conversion section 551 converts the<br>
transmission data from transmission data taking two types<br>
of values of "1" and "0" to transmission data taking three<br>
types of values of "1", "-1" and "0" based on the<br>
correspondence information stored in table storage<br>
section 552 and outputs the transmission data expressed<br>
with three values to digital modulation section 502. This<br>
conversion operation will be explained in further detail<br>
later.<br>
The transmission data output from pattern<br>
conversion section 551 is subjected to BPSK modulation<br>
by digital conversion section 502 and converted from<br>
serial to parallel by S/P conversion section 503. This<br>
data is superimposed on a plurality of subcarriers and<br><br>
output to IFFT section 504 as transmission symbols.<br>
IFFT section 504 performs an inverse fast Fourier<br>
transform on the transmission symbols and outputs the<br>
transmission signal after the inverse fast Fourier<br>
transform to radio transmission section 505. Radio<br>
transmission section 505 converts the signal after the<br>
inverse fast Fourier transform from digital to analog,<br>
up-converts and sends it via antenna 506 as a radio signal.<br>
A radio signal received via antenna 506 is<br>
down-converted by radio reception section 507, converted<br>
from analog to digital and output to FFT section 508.<br>
FFT section 508 carries out a fast Fourier transform<br>
on the received signal into a received symbol, P/S<br>
conversion section 509 converts this to a received symbol<br>
string and outputs to digital modulation section 510.<br>
The received symbol string is demodulated by digital<br>
modulation section 510 and the reception data obtained<br>
is output to pattern conversion section 561.<br>
Pattern conversion section 561 converts the<br>
reception data from a pattern taking three types of values<br>
" + 1", " -1" and " 0" to a pattern taking two types of values<br>
"1" and "0" and outputs as reception data expressed with<br>
two values. The conversion operation will be explained<br>
in further detail later.<br>
The transmission data conversion operation by<br>
pattern conversion section 551 will be explained below.<br>
FIG.20 illustrates an example of converting data<br>
expressed with two values to data expressed with three<br><br>
values.<br>
In FIG.20, the pre-conversion data is 4-bit data<br>
expressed with two values of "0" and "1" and<br>
post-conversion 3-value data is data expressed with three<br>
values of "+1", "0" and "-1".<br>
When 4-bit data "0, 0, 0, 0" is input, pattern<br>
conversion section 551 converts the 4-bit data to "+1,<br>
+ 1, +1, 0" based on the correspondence information stored<br>
in table storage section 552, for example, the<br>
correspondence information shown in FIG.20 and outputs<br>
to digital modulation section 502.<br>
Likewise, pattern conversion section 551 converts<br>
the 4-bit data "0, 0, 0, 1" input to " + 1, -1, +1, 0" based<br>
on the correspondence information stored in table storage<br>
section 552 and outputs to digital modulation section<br>
502.<br>
Digital modulation section 502 modulates discrete<br>
data to a signal whose amplitude takes continuous values.<br>
For example, when "+1" is input, digital modulation<br>
section 502 outputs a sine waveform with a predetermined<br>
frequency, predetermined amplitude and predetermined<br>
phase, and when " -1" is input, digital modulation section<br>
502 outputs a sine waveform with a predetermined frequency<br>
and predetermined amplitude with a cycle 180 degrees<br>
shifted from a predetermined phase, and when "0" is input,<br>
digital modulation section 502 outputs a sine waveform<br>
with amplitude "0".<br>
This embodiment converts input digital data<br><br>
expressed with two values to digital data expressed with<br>
three values, modulates the digital data and selects r<br>
out of N subcarriers, modulates the r subcarriers and<br>
sends amplitude [0] for the remaining (N-r) subcarriers<br>
(sends nothing). The number of patterns for selecting<br>
r out of N subcarriers is calculated with NCr-<br>
r subcarriers give either positive or negative<br>
values. In this case, it is understood that there can<br>
be NCr-2r ways of expression for 1 OFDM symbol. While<br>
each subcarrier of a conventional multi-carrier<br>
communication has either a positive or negative value,<br>
each subcarrier of the multi-carrier communication of<br>
the present invention can also take 0, and therefore there<br>
can also be cases where there is a large signal space,<br>
that is, NCr-2r &gt; 2N.<br>
Thus, with the multi-carrier communication<br>
apparatus of this embodiment, some of subcarriers have<br>
amplitude "0", the number of patterns of the symbol data<br>
increases, that is, the symbol data space expands, and<br>
therefore no symbol pattern with large peak power is used.<br>
As a result, it is possible to suppress peak voltages<br>
of signals with a simple apparatus configuration without<br>
deteriorating the transmission characteristic or<br>
increasing the size of the apparatus.<br>
Furthermore, the multi-carrier communication<br>
apparatus of this embodiment can easily collate the first<br>
and second data patterns and perform demapping<br>
efficiently. This makes it possible to correctly<br><br>
demodulate symbol data of a multi-carrier signal<br>
transmitted.<br>
Furthermore, the multi-carrier communication<br>
apparatus of this embodiment can easily collate the first<br>
and second data patterns, allowing efficient mapping.<br>
(Embodiment 10)<br>
FIG.21 shows a configuration of a multi-carrier<br>
communication apparatus according to Embodiment 10 of<br>
the present invention.<br>

any one of the mapping sections according to Embodiments<br>
1 to 8. Furthermore, demapping sections 615-1 to 615-n<br>
are constructed of any one of the demapping sections<br>
according to Embodiments 1 to 8.<br>
Digital modulation sections 601-1 to 601-n<br>
digital-modulate transmission data and output<br><br>
pre-conversion symbol patterns to mapping sections 602-1<br>
to 602-n.<br>
Mapping sections 602-1 to 602-n store information<br>
on the correspondence between pre-conversion symbol<br>
patterns and post-conversion symbol patterns and convert<br>
the pre-conversion symbol patterns output from digital<br>
modulation sections 601-1 to 601-n to post-conversion<br>
symbol patterns and output the post-conversion symbol<br>
patterns to spreading sections 603-1 to 603-n.<br>
Spreading sections 603-1 to 603-n multiply n<br>
post-conversion symbol patterns output from mapping<br>
sections 602-1 to 602-n by different spreading codes and<br>
output to adder 604.<br>
Adder 604 adds up n post-conversion symbol patterns<br>
output from spreading sections 603-1 to 603-n and outputs<br>
one transmission symbol pattern obtained to scramble code<br>
multiplication section 605.<br>
Scramble code multiplication section 605 multiplies<br>
the transmission symbol pattern output from adder 604<br>
by a scramble code which differs from one communication<br>
apparatus to another and outputs to S/P conversion section<br>
606.<br>
S/P conversion section 606 converts the<br>
transmission symbol pattern output from scramble code<br>
multiplication section 605 from serial to parallel and<br>
outputs the parallel data obtained to IFFT section 607.<br>
IFFT section 607 performs an inverse fast Fourier<br>
transform on the parallel data output from S/P conversion<br><br>
section 606 and outputs the transmission signal after<br>
the inverse fast Fourier transform to radio transmission<br>
section 608.<br>
Radio transmission section 608 converts the<br>
transmission signal from digital to analog, up-converts<br>
and sends it as a radio signal via antenna 609.<br>
Antenna 609 sends a transmission signal output from<br>
radio transmission section 608 and outputs a received<br>
radio signal to radio reception section 610 as a received<br>
signal.<br>
Radio reception section 610 down-converts the<br>
received signal and converts to an analog signal and<br>
outputs to FFT section 611.<br>
FFT section 611 performs a fast Fourier transform<br>
on the received signal and outputs to P/S conversion<br>
section 612.<br>
P/S conversion section 612 converts the received<br>
signal from parallel to serial, unites signals of<br>
subcarriers into serial data and outputs to scramble code<br>
multiplication section 613.<br>
Scramble code multiplication section 613 multiplies<br>
the serial data output from P/S conversion section 612<br>
by a scramble code which differs from one communication<br>
apparatus to another and outputs the received symbol<br>
pattern obtained to despreading sections 614-1 to 614-n.<br>
Despreading sections 614-1 to 614-n multiply the<br>
received symbol pattern output from scramble code<br>
multiplication section 613 by spreading codes, despread<br><br>
the received symbol patterns and output to demapping<br>
sections 615-1 to 615-n.<br>
Demapping sections 615-1 to 615-n store information<br>
on the correspondence between received symbol patterns<br>
and pre-conversion symbol patterns, convert the received<br>
symbol patterns output from despreading sections 614-1<br>
to 614-n to pre-conversion symbol patterns and output<br>
to digital demodulation sections 616-1 to 616-n.<br>
Digital demodulation sections 616-1 to 616-n<br>
demodulate the pre-conversion symbol patterns output from<br>
demapping sections 615-1 to 615-n and output the reception<br>
data.<br>
Then, an operation of the multi-carrier<br>
communication apparatus according to Embodiment 10 will<br>
be explained. First, a transmission operation will be<br>
explained.<br>
n transmission data pieces are digital-modulated<br>
by digital modulation sections 601-1 to 601-n, output<br>
to mapping sections 602-1 to 602-n as n pre-conversion<br>
symbol patterns, converted to n post-conversion symbol<br>
patterns by mapping sections 602-1 to 602-n and output<br>
to spreading sections 603-1 to 603-n.<br>
Spreading sections 603-1 to 603-n multiply n<br>
post-conversion symbol patterns by different spreading<br>
codes, added up by adder 604 and output to scramble code<br>
multiplication section 605 as a single transmission<br>
symbol pattern.<br>
The transmission symbol pattern is multiplied by<br><br>
scramble code multiplication section 605 by a scramble<br>
code which varies from one communication apparatus to<br>
another, converted from serial to parallel by S/P<br>
conversion section 606, subjected to an inverse Fourier<br>
transform by IFFT section 607 and output to radio<br>
transmission section608 as a transmission signal.<br>
Radio transmission section 608 converts the<br>
transmission signal from digital to analog, up-converts<br>
and sends it as a radio signal via antenna 609.<br>
Then, a reception operation will be explained.<br>
The radio signal is received via antenna 609,<br>
down-converted and converted to an analog signal by radio<br>
reception section 610, subjected to a fast Fourier<br>
transform by FFT section 611, converted from parallel<br>
to serial by P/S conversion section 612 and output to<br>
scramble code multiplication section 613 as a received<br>
symbol.<br>
The received symbol is multiplied by a scramble code<br>
which differs from one communication apparatus to another<br>
by scramble code multiplication section 613, output to<br>
despreading sections 614-1 to 614-n, multiplied by<br>
spreading codes by despreading sections 614-1 to 614-n<br>
and output to demapping sections 615-1 to 615-n as n<br>
received symbol patterns.<br>
n received symbol patterns are converted to<br>
pre-conversion symbol patterns by demapping sections<br>
615-1 to 615-n, demodulated by digital demodulation<br>
sections 616-1 to 616-n and output as reception data.<br><br>
Then, signal processing by the multi-carrier<br>
communication apparatus according to Embodiment 10 will<br>
be explained.<br>
FIG.22A, FIG.22B and FIG.22C illustrate examples<br>
of signal processing according to Embodiment 10 of the<br>
present invention.<br>
FIG.22A shows a symbol pattern including amplitude<br>
"0" obtained by subjecting a digital-modulated symbol<br>
pattern to mapping processing.<br>
FIG.22B shows a symbol pattern obtained by<br>
subjecting the symbol pattern shown in FIG.22A to time<br>
area spreading. This symbol pattern consists of 5 chip<br>
components through five-fold spreading.<br>
FIG.22C shows an example of the symbol pattern shown<br>
in FIG. 2 2B converted from serial to parallel, distributed<br>
to subcarriers and multiplexed.<br>
Thus, the multi-carrier communication apparatus<br>
according to this embodiment applies spreading processing<br>
to symbols converted to symbol patterns including<br>
amplitude "0", sends the spread symbols, and therefore<br>
no symbol patterns with large peak power are used. As<br>
a result, it is possible to suppress peak voltages of<br>
signals and increase the frequency utilization efficiency<br>
without deteriorating transmission characteristics or<br>

FIG.23 shows a configuration of a multi-carrier<br><br>
communication apparatus according to Embodiment 11 of<br>
the present invention. However, the same components as<br>
those in FIG.21 are assigned the same reference numerals<br>
and detailed explanations thereof will be omitted.<br>
The multi-carrier communication apparatus in<br>
FIG.23 comprises interleave section 651, deinterleave<br>
section 652, and differs in that it carries out interleave<br>
on transmission symbols subjected to spreading processing<br>
chip by chip and performs deinterleave on signals<br>
subjected to parallel-serial conversion into received<br>
symbols after scramble code multiplication chip by chip.<br>
In FIG.23, adder 604 adds up n post-conversion<br>
symbol patterns output from spreading sections 603-1 to<br>
603-n and outputs the single transmission symbol pattern<br>
obtained to interleave section 651.<br>
Interleave section 651 performs interleave on the<br>
transmission symbol output from adder 604 on a spreading<br>
code chip basis and outputs the interleaved transmission<br>
symbol to scramble code multiplication section 605.<br>
Scramble code multiplication section 605<br>
multiplies the transmission symbol pattern output from<br>
interleave section 651 by a scramble code which differs<br>
from one communication apparatus to another and outputs<br>
to S/P conversion section 606.<br>
Scramble code multiplication section 613<br>
multiplies the serial data output from P/S conversion<br>
section 612 by a scramble code which differs from one<br>
communication apparatus to another and outputs the<br><br>
received symbol pattern obtained to deinterleave section<br>
652.<br>
Deinterleave section 652 performs deinterleave on<br>
the received symbol pattern output from scramble code<br>
multiplication section 613 on a spreading code chip basis<br>
and outputs the deinterleaved received symbol pattern<br>
to despreading sections 614-1 to 614-n.<br>
Despreading sections 614-1 to 614-n multiply the<br>
received symbol pattern output from deinterleave section<br>
652 by the respective spreading codes to despread the<br>
received symbol pattern and output to demapping sections<br>
615-1 to 615-n.<br>
Thus, the multi-carrier communication apparatus of<br>
this embodiment performs chip-by-chip interleave on<br>
symbols subjected to spreading processing, sends the<br>
interleaved symbols and performs chip-by-chip interleave<br>
on the received symbols, and can thereby spread symbols<br>
chip by chip on the time axis in the case of time interleave<br>
and spread symbols on the frequency axis in the case of<br>
frequency interleave, thus providing communications<br>
resistant to burst errors.<br>
Furthermore, the multi-carrier communication<br>
apparatus of this embodiment can also perform interleave<br>
on a transmission symbol multiplied by a scramble code.<br>
In this case, interleave section 651 performs<br>
interleave processing on a transmission symbol output<br>
from scramble code multiplication section 605 and outputs<br>
to S/P conversion section 606. Furthermore,<br><br>
deinterleave section 652 performs deinterleave<br>
processing on the serial data output from S/P conversion<br>
section 612 and outputs the received symbol obtained to<br>
scramble code multiplication section 613.<br>
(Embodiment 12)<br>
FIG.24 shows a configuration of a multi-carrier<br>
communication apparatus according to Embodiment 12 of<br>
the present invention. However, the same components as<br>
those in FIG.21 are assigned the same reference numerals<br>
and detailed explanations thereof will be omitted.<br>
The multi-carrier communication apparatus in FIG. 24<br>
comprises n spreading sections 701-1 to 701-n, adder 702,<br>
mapping section 703, demapping section 7 11, n despreading<br>
sections 712-1 to 712-n, and differs in that a transmission<br>
symbol obtained by applying spreading processing and<br>
addition processing and then multiplexing is mapped and<br>
that a demapped received symbol is subjected to<br>
despreading processing.<br>
In FIG.24, digital modulation sections 601-1 to<br>
601-n digital-modulate transmission data and output the<br>
pre-conversion symbol patterns to spreading sections<br>
701-1 to 701-n.<br>
Spreading sections 701-1 to 701-n multiply n<br>
pre-conversion symbol patterns output from digital<br>
modulation sections 601-1 to 601-n by different spreading<br>
codes and output to adder 702.<br>
Adder 702 adds up n post-conversion symbol patterns<br><br>
output from spreading sections 701-1 to 701-n and outputs<br>
a single transmission symbol pattern obtained to mapping<br>
section 703.<br>
Mapping section 703 stores information on the<br>
correspondence between pre-conversion symbol patterns<br>
and post-conversion symbol patterns, converts the<br>
pre-conversion symbol patterns output from adder 702 to<br>
their respective post-conversion symbol patterns and<br>
outputs the post-conversion symbol patterns to scramble<br>
code multiplication section 605.<br>
Scramble code multiplication sect ion 605 multiplies<br>
the transmission symbol pattern output from mapping<br>
section 703 by a scramble code which differs from one<br>
communication apparatus to another and outputs to S/P<br>
conversion section 606.<br>
Thus, the multi-carrier communication apparatus of<br>
this embodiment converts symbol patterns after spreading<br>
processing to symbol patterns including amplitude "0"<br>
and sends the converted symbol patterns, and therefore<br>
no symbol patterns with large peak power are used. As<br>
a result, it is possible to suppress peak voltages of<br>
signals and increase the frequency utilization efficiency<br>
with a simple apparatus configuration without<br>
deteriorating transmission characteristics or<br>
increasing the size of the apparatus.<br>

code multiplied here is the same spreading code used for<br>
the symbol pattern output from the same S/P conversion<br>
section and spreading codes which differ from one S/P<br>
conversion to another are used.<br>
Adders 803-1 to 803-4 add up n post-conversion symbol<br>
patterns output from spreading sections 802-1 to 802-n<br>
and output the transmission symbol patterns obtained to<br>
scramble code multiplication section 804.<br>
Scramble code multiplication section 804 multiplies<br>
the transmission symbol patterns output from adders 803-1<br>
to 803-4 by different scramble codes and outputs to IFFT<br>
section 607.<br>
IFFT section 607 performs an inverse fast Fourier<br>
transform on the transmission symbol patterns output from<br>
scramble code multiplication section 804 and outputs the<br>
transmission signal after the inverse fast Fourier<br>
transform to radio transmission section 608.<br>

Thus, the multi-carrier communication apparatus of<br>
this embodiment applies spreading processing to symbols<br>
converted to symbol patterns including amplitude "0",<br>
sends the converted symbols, and therefore no symbol<br>

numerals and detailed explanations thereof will be<br>
omitted.<br>
The multi-carrier communication apparatus in FIG. 2 7<br>
comprises n spreading sections 901-1 to 901-n, n<br>
despreading sections 911-1 to 911-n, n S/P conversion<br>
sections 902-1 to 902-n and spreading sections 903-1 to<br>
903-n, and differs from FIG.25 in that spreading<br>
processing is applied to mapped symbol patterns including<br>
"0" and the spread symbol patterns are subjected to<br>
serial-parallel conversion.<br>
In FIG.27, mapping sections 602-1 to 602-n store<br>
information on the correspondence between pre-conversion<br>
symbol patterns and post-conversion symbol patterns,<br>
convert the pre-conversion symbol patterns output from<br>

post-conversion symbol patterns output from mapping<br>
sections 602-1 to 602-n by spreading codes and output<br>
to S/P conversion sections 902-1 to 902-n.<br>
S/P conversion sections 902-1 to 902-n convert the<br>
post-conversion symbol patterns output from spreading<br>
sections 901-1 to 901-n from serial to parallel and output<br>
the parallel series symbol patterns obtained to spreading<br>
sections 903-1 to 903-n.<br>

parallel series symbol patterns output from S/P<br>
conversion sections 902-1 to 902-n by different spreading<br>
codes and output to adders 803-1 to 803-4. The spreading<br>
code multiplied here is the same spreading code used for<br>
the symbol pattern output from the same S/P conversion<br>
section and spreading codes which differ from one S/P<br>
conversion to another are used.<br>
The spreading codes multiplied at spreading<br>
sections 903-1 to 903-n are different from spreading codes<br>
multiplied at spreading sections 901-1 to 901-n.<br>

patterns output from spreading sections 903-1 to 903-n<br>
and output the transmission symbol patterns obtained to<br>
scramble code multiplication section 804.<br>
Scramble codemultiplie at ion section 811 multiplies<br>
the parallel data output from FFT section 611 by scramble<br>
codes multiplied during transmission and outputs the<br>
received symbol patterns obtained to despreading sections<br>
911-1 to 911-n.<br>

Despreading sections 913-1 to 913-n multiply the<br>
received symbol patterns output from P/S conversion<br>
sections 912-1 to 912-n by spreading codes and output<br>
to demapping section 615-1 to 615-n.<br>

sections 813-1 to 813-n to pre-conversion symbol patterns<br>
and output to digital demodulation sections 616-1 to<br>

Thus, the multi-carrier communication apparatus of<br>
this embodiment performs spreading processing on symbols<br>
converted to symbol patterns including amplitude [0] and<br>
sends the spread symbol patterns, and therefore no symbol<br>
patterns with large peak power are used. Furthermore,<br>
multiplying spread signals using codes which differ from<br>
one communication apparatus to another allows a plurality<br>
of transmitters to send signals using a same band. As<br>
a result, it is possible to suppress peak voltages of<br>
signals and increase the frequency utilization efficiency<br>
without deteriorating the transmission characteristics<br>
or increasing the size of the apparatus.<br>
Furthermore, the multi-carrier communication<br>
apparatus of this embodiment can also rearrange<br>
transmission signals in order of subcarriers or in order<br>
of transmission times in chip units.<br>
FIG.28A, FIG.28B, FIG.28C, FIG.28D and FIG.28E<br><br>
illustrate examples of signal processing of Embodiment<br>
14 of the present invention.<br>
FIG.28A illustrates a symbol pattern including<br>
amplitude "0" obtained by performing mapping processing<br>
on the digital-modulated symbol pattern.<br>
FIG.28B illustrates a symbol pattern obtained by<br>
performing time area spreading on the symbol pattern shown<br>
in FIG.28A. FIG.28C shows a symbol pattern obtained by<br>
performing frequency area spreading on the symbol pattern<br>
shown in FIG.28A.<br>
The multi-carrier communication apparatus of<br>
Embodiment 14 of the present invention performs time area<br>
spreading and frequency area spreading, generates symbol<br>
patterns spread two-dimensionally using the time axis<br>
and carrier frequency axis shown in FIG.2 8D and canperform<br>
chip-by-chip interleave on these symbol patterns<br>
two-dimensionally using the time axis and carrier<br>
frequency axis.<br>
FIG.28E shows symbol patterns subjected to the<br>
above-described interleave.<br>
Thus, by performing chip-by-chip interleave<br>
two-dimensionally using the time axis and carrier<br>
frequency axis, it is possible to spread symbols on the<br>
time axis and frequency axis chip by chip, and therefore<br>
it is possible to provide communications resistant to<br>
burst errors and frequency selective fading.<br>
Above-described Embodiments 1 to 14 have described<br>
cases where values "+1" and "-1" obtained when data is<br><br>
BPSK-modulated are converted to three values of " + 1",<br>
"-1" and "0", but the present invention is not limited<br>
to this and it is also possible to perform QPSK modulation,<br>
etc. on the data and convert two values of " + 1" and "-1"<br>
to three values of "+1", "-1" and "0" for one or both<br>
of the in-phase component and quadrature component.<br>
For example, mapping is performed so that a signal<br>
point layout of normal QPSK modulation shown in FIG.29A<br>
becomes a signal point layout of normal BPSK modulation<br>
shown in FIG.29B. In this case, a decision in the case<br>
of BPSK modulation is performed on the in-phase component<br>
and quadrature component. That is, for the in-phase<br>
component and quadrature component of each subcarrier<br>
component, a 3-value decision is made on the amplitude<br>
or the amplitude is decided to be "0" for only a necessary<br>
number of subcarriers and a polarity decision is made<br>
on the remaining subcarriers. In this way, as in the case<br>
of BPSK modulation, the number of symbol patterns per<br>
1 OFDM increases, that is, the signal space expands, and<br>
therefore it is also possible to reduce peak power using<br>
patterns with small peak power and perform high-speed<br>
transmission by increasing the amount of data per 1 OFDM.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is not limited<br>
to this and it is also possible to perform 16QAM, etc.<br>
on data and convert three values of "+3", " + 1", "-1" and<br>
"-3" to five values of " + 3", " + 1", "-1", "-3" and "0"<br>
for one or both of the in-phase component and quadrature<br>
component.<br><br>
For example, mapping is performed so that a signal<br>
point layout of normal 16QAM shown in FIG.30A becomes<br>
a signal point layout of 16QAM shown in FIG.30B. In this<br>
case, for the in-phase component and quadrature component<br>
of each subcarrier component, the amplitude is decided<br>
to be "0" for a necessary number of subcarriers and a<br>
4-value decision is made on the remaining subcarriers.<br>
In this way, as in the case of BPSK modulation, the number<br>
of symbol patterns per 1 OFDM increases, that is, the<br>
signal space expands, and therefore it is possible to<br>
increase the amount of data per 1 OFDM and perform<br>
high-speed transmission.<br>
Above-described Embodiments 1 to 14 have described<br>
cases where each subcarrier component is decided one by<br>
one through an amplitude decision, but the present<br>
invention is also applicable to a case where a decision<br>
is made on an entire symbol pattern (e.g., components<br>
for all 4 subcarriers in the case of a symbol pattern<br>
with 4 subcarriers) through maximum likelihood series<br>
estimation.<br>
For example, channel estimation is performed using<br>
known signals such as pilot symbols and the channel<br>
estimated value obtained is multiplied on each symbol<br>
pattern to generate a replica signal of a received symbol<br>
pattern. Then, the replica signal is compared with the<br>
received symbol pattern and the most resembling replica<br>
signal is decided to be the symbol pattern transmitted.<br>
Whether a replica signal is most resembling or not is<br><br>
decided using a method, for example, of comparing the<br>
replica signal with the received symbol pattern for each<br>
subcarrier component, finding the difference and<br>
determining the symbol pattern corresponding to the<br>
replica signal with the smallest total difference as the<br>
symbol pattern transmitted.<br>
In this case, it is possible to decide symbol<br>
patterns all together and decide symbol patterns more<br>
accurately.<br>
Above-described Embodiments 1 to 14 have described<br>
cases where the apparatuses on the transmitting side and<br>
on the receiving side are installed on the same apparatus,<br>
but the transmitting side apparatus and receiving side<br>
apparatus need not necessarily be installed on the same<br>
apparatus as far as the present invention has a<br>
configuration that the multi-carrier communication<br>
apparatus including the mapping section according to the<br>
present invention is installed in the apparatus on the<br>
transmitting side and the multi-carrier communication<br>
apparatus including the demapping section according to<br>
the present invention is installed in the apparatus on<br>
the receiving side.<br>
The multi-carrier communication apparatus of<br>
above-described Embodiments 1 to 14 can be installed in<br>
a communication terminal apparatus or base station<br>
apparatus.<br>
The present invention is not limited to<br>
above-described Embodiments 1 to 14 but can be implemented<br><br>
with various modifications. For example, the number of<br>
thresholds or the number of subcarriers in<br>
above-described Embodiments 1 to 14 are not limited to<br>
particular values.<br>
Above-described Embodiments 12 to 14 can also<br>
perform chip interleave processing on spread symbol<br>
strings. In this case, symbol strings subject to chip<br>
interleave need only to be subjected to spreading code<br>
processing and chip interleave can be realized by<br>
providing an interleave section between the spreading<br>
section and the IFFT section of the multi-carrier<br>
communication apparatus of above-described Embodiments<br>
12 to 14.<br>
Furthermore, in above-described Embodiments 12 to<br>
14, the multi-carrier communication apparatus can also<br>
include a plurality of interleave sections and perform<br>
chip interleave on each symbol string subjected to<br>
spreading processing prior to multiplexing.<br>
Likewise, above-described Embodiments 12 to 14 can<br>
perform chip deinterleave processing on a spread symbol<br>
string. In this case, the symbol string subject to chip<br>
deinterleave needs only to be subjected to spreading code<br>
processing and it is possible to perform chip deinterleave<br>
by providing a deinterleave section between the FFT<br>
section and despreading section of the multi-carrier<br>
communication apparatus of above-described Embodiments<br>
12 to 14.<br>
Furthermore, the multi-carrier communication<br><br>
apparatus of above-described Embodiments 12 to 14 can<br>
also include a plurality of deinterleave sections and<br>
perform chip deinterleave for each symbol string<br>
subjected to spreading processing prior to multiplexing.<br>
The multi-carrier communication apparatus of the<br>
present invention adopts a configuration comprising a<br>
reception section that receives a multi-carrier signal<br>
mapped to subcarriers with a first symbol string including<br>

present invention adopts a configuration with the<br>
demapping section demapping a multi-carrier signal mapped<br>
to subcarriers with a first symbol string including a<br>
first symbol to a second symbol string excluding the<br>
above-described first symbol in predetermined symbol<br>
units and demodulating the demapped symbol pattern to<br>
obtain reception data.<br>
The multi-carrier communication apparatus of the<br>
present invention adopts a configuration with the<br>
demapping section demodulating a multi-carrier signal<br>
mapped to subcarriers with a first symbol string including<br>
a first symbol and converting the demodulated first data<br>
expressed with three discrete values to second data<br>
expressed with two discrete values.<br>
These configurations cause some of subcarriers to<br><br>
be set to amplitude "0", increasing the number of patterns<br>
of symbol data, that is, expanding the symbol data space,<br>
and therefore no symbol patterns with large peak power<br>
are used. As a result, it is possible to suppress peak<br>
voltages of signals with a simple apparatus configuration<br>
without deteriorating the transmission characteristics<br>
or increasing the size of the apparatus.<br>
The multi-carrier communication apparatus of the<br>
present invention adopts a configuration with the<br>
demapping section comprising a storage section that<br>
stores a table of correspondence between a first symbol<br>
string and second symbol string and a collation section<br>
that checks a received symbol string against the<br>
above-described table.<br>
This configuration makes it possible to simply<br>
collate between the first and second symbol patterns and<br>
perform efficient demapping. This makes it possible to<br>
correctly demodulate symbol data of transmitted<br>
multi-carrier signals.<br>
The multi-carrier communication apparatus of the<br>
present invention adopts a configuration with the<br>
demapping section comprising a storage section that<br>
stores a table of correspondence between a second data<br>
pattern expressed with two discrete values and a first<br>
data pattern expressed with three discrete values.<br>

present invention adopts a configuration comprising a<br>

transmitting side for retransmission when the received<br>
symbol string cannot be associated with any patterns in<br>

even if the received symbol data includes errors during<br>
transmission, etc.<br>

correction even if the received symbol data includes<br>
errors during transmission, etc.<br>
