				<td>AN INFLATABLE UTERINE DEVICE TO CONTROL UTERINE BLEEDING<br>
The present invention relates to an Inflatable uterine device to control<br>
uterine bleeding. Uterine bleeding can be caused by post-partum hemorrhages<br>
following childbirth. Severe uterine bleedings can be a serious problem<br>
due to the large loss of blood. Hemorrhage is one of the major causes of<br>
maternal mortality. The invention relates also to a method for producing the<br>
uterine device.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
A device used for stanching uterine bleeding comprising an expandable<br>
balloon and a tubular handle connected therewith for the insertion of the balloon<br>
into the uterine cavity is disclosed in US6024753. The device further includes<br>
a hose for connecting the balloon to a fluid source. The hose is connected<br>
to a pump, which is controlled by a control unit. Both the pump and the<br>
control unit will require well-trained personnel and will involve high costs for<br>
producing and for operating the device, which is a drawback in several instances.<br>
A similar device is disclosed in US4552557. The pressure of an inflatable<br>
portion is measured by a pressure gauge. The device in one embodiment<br>
will allow accumulated blood or mucosal debris present in the uterus to<br>
be drained.<br>
In the devices disclosed in US6024753 and US4552557 an inflatable<br>
balloon is used. The balloon is formed by a material that will allow the balloon<br>
to expand and to fill the uterine cavity completely when inflated. The requirements<br>
on the material result in a high cost for producing the device. The<br>
pump and pressure measuring means will involve further costs and possible<br>
problems handling the equipment.<br>
A further drawback is that the devices may include air. Such embedded<br>
air has to be removed, so as not to risk that air embolism will occur if the balloon<br>
ruptures. The removal of air involves further costs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a device for controlling<br>
or stanching uterine bleedings that is without the drawbacks mentioned<br>
above. The device according to the invention can be produced at a very low<br>
cost and can be used under very primitive conditions. No pump or similar device<br>
is necessary to provide the required pressure for inflating the balloon and<br>
for exerting sufficient pressure on uterine blood vessels to curtail bleeding.<br>
According to the invention the fluid source comprises a container with<br>
an opening that will allow filling of a fluid, preferably water, into the container<br>
and through the hose into the balloon. Preferably, the opening is formed as a<br>
funnel, so as to facilitate the filling of fluid.<br>
The hose close to the container or the container itself is provided with<br>
suspension means. The suspension means can be used to suspend the device<br>
at such a height in relation to the balloon that the pressure in the balloon<br>
will reach a sufficient level. Normally, the surface of fluid in the container will<br>
be kept at least 1 m above the balloon. A1m long hose corresponds to a<br>
pressure in the balloon of about 70 mm Hg, which in most circumstances will<br>
be sufficient.<br>
The length of the hose will normally be no more than 3 meters, thus restricting<br>
the maximum pressure that can be obtained from the water pressure<br>
to about 220 mm Hg (29,3 kPa). At this pressure neither the tissue in the uterine<br>
cavity nor the uterus itself can be damaged. A working pressure of approximately<br>
70 mm Hg would be a normal pressure. The hose may be provided<br>
with markings over a section or the complete length. The markings indicate<br>
the pressure in the balloon when the container is lifted. The hose may<br>
also be provided with a more detailed scale that can be used if a pressure<br>
clamp is used to raise the pressure in the system.<br>
The device, comprising the container, the hose and the balloon, according<br>
to the present invention can all be in an integral form and no connectors<br>
or similar devices are required to be present. When inflated the balloon<br>
will fill the uterine cavity and exert a sufficient pressure on the surrounding<br>
tissue to curtail bleeding.<br>
Different methods can be used for producing the device according to<br>
the invention. In one embodiment two sheets that are welded together in the<br>
appropriate shape form the device. The sheets are fed from two rolls to a<br>
welding and cutting device. Preferably, side edges of the device are welded<br>
and cut in one step. The cut out device is then either folded to an appropriate<br>
shape and size or rolled into a roll. The device is sterilised and wrapped in a<br>
package. If folded the device preferably is disposed on a sheet or plate that<br>
will function as a base plate when the device is unpacked. As a result of this<br>
producing method no air will be present within the device. As no cavities with<br>
air will be present in the device it is ensured that no air embolism occurs during<br>
use of the device.<br>
The package may include a clamp or similar device that can be used to<br>
close the container and/or to raise the pressure in the balloon. In the latter<br>
case the clamp can be moved over the hose from the container towards the<br>
balloon and may include rolls or other rotating means.<br>
The balloon has a size when inflated that is sufficient to fill the uterus of<br>
most women. Preferably a non-resilient material is used. A major advantage<br>
of using a non-resiiient material is that the pressure in the area of filling the<br>
device, a filling pressure, will equal to a working pressure of the device. Thus,<br>
there will be no need for measuring the pressure of the balloon when it is located<br>
in the uterus.<br>
The term non-resilient should be understood to include materials that<br>
are completely without resilience and materials that will have a low degree of<br>
resilience and a substantially linear relation between expansion and pressure<br>
increase. When a non-resilient material is used the volume of the inflated balloon<br>
is at least 0,3 litre. In prior art devices the resilient material will cause a<br>
resistance when the pressure is increased. Therefore, the pressure normally<br>
has to be measured within the uterus.<br>
It is possible to produce the device at very low costs. Biocompatible but<br>
low-cost materials can be used, because it is not required that the material is<br>
resilient. Large amounts of the device can be distributed in developing countries<br>
to save many lives.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, it can be seen that a device according to the invention<br>
comprises three main sections. It should also be noted that the device is<br>
shown in a configuration when delivered and ready for use. A balloon 10 constitutes<br>
the part of the device that is designed to fit in the human uterus. The<br>
balloon 10 is circular or approximately circular and completely fiat in a non-<br>
inflated condition. In an inflated condition (not shown) it will assume a some-<br>
what flattened but spherical shape. The volume of the balloon 10 in the inflated<br>
condition is between 0,3 litre and 2,5 litres, corresponding to a diameter<br>
of about 0,13 m to about 0,20 m. An appropriate size is achieved with a diameter<br>
of 0,155 m resulting in a maximum volume of about 1,5 litre. A balloon<br>
of that size will for most women exert a sufficient pressure, even if the balloon<br>
is not fully inflated. As an alternative two sizes of the balloon are provided. A<br>
smaller sized balloon will hold from about 0,31 to about 1,51, and a larger<br>
sized balloon will hold from about 11 to about 2,51.<br>
A balloon that is not fully inflated will adapt to the form of the uterus<br>
more closely and the shape of the balloon is of less importance. By using thin<br>
films the balloon can fill small and irregularly shaped cavities. Other sizes of<br>
the balloon may be provided for specific conditions such as when a differently<br>
sized uterus is to be treated. The design of the device and the thin material<br>
used will allow the use of more than one balloon if necessary.<br>
An annular flap 35 can be provided on the edge of the balloon opposite<br>
to the connection between the hose and the balloon. The flap 35 can receive<br>
a tip of an introducing member, for instance as the one shown in Fig. 10.<br>
The balloon is integral with a hose 11 extending from the balloon to a<br>
container 12. The length of the hose 11 from a first end connected to the balloon<br>
to a second end connected to the container 12 will be sufficient to give<br>
the required pressure when the container 12 is filled with water and raised.<br>
The container is designed to be filled with a liquid, such as water, and has<br>
one open end where water can be filled and an opposite end, which is integrally<br>
connected to the hose. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1 the open end<br>
is shaped as a funnel 13, so as to facilitate the filling of water. The funnel<br>
shaped opening 13 will allow water to be poured into the container.<br>
The container 12 is provided with a suspension means to facilitate the<br>
suspension thereof in a raised position. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1 a<br>
longitudinal pocket 14 extending from a lower part of the container 12 to the<br>
funnel shaped opening 13 is used. The pocket is formed to receive a vertical<br>
rod or pin and is open in one end and closed in the other end. The open end<br>
is located at the lower part of the container 12. Fig. 9 shows an example of<br>
the use of the suspension means. Also a recess 15 formed between the<br>
pocket 14 and the funnel shaped opening 13 can be used as a suspension<br>
means.<br>
At an appropriate distance from the balloon 10 the hose 11 is provided<br>
with a scale 16 that can be used when an increased pressure is required. The<br>
use of the scale is further described with reference to Fig. 9 and the enlarged<br>
section.<br>
In a preferred embodiment two sheets that are welded together form<br>
the device. A space between the sheets formed by welding seams can be<br>
filled with a liquid such as water as disclosed above. The complete device is<br>
mounted on a plate or sheet 23 that will hold the device and facilitate the handling<br>
thereof when the device is to be used. The plate 23 can be made from<br>
paper only or from a plastic film coated paper sheet.<br>
An example of a production line for the manufacturing thereof is shown<br>
in Fig. 2. A plastic film is rolled on a first roll 17 and forms an upper film 18. A<br>
corresponding plastic film is rolled on a second roll 19 and forms a lower film<br>
20. The plastic film can be made from different plastic materials with appropriate<br>
properties. The material should allow a combined cutting and welding<br>
process and should also be biocompatible. Suitable materials are polypropylene,<br>
polymers such as ethylene methacrylic acid copolymer (EMA) and Eth-<br>
ylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA). At least the balloon is formed by thin films of a<br>
rigid or non-flexible material that are welded together.<br>
The upper film 18 and the lower film 20 are conveyed over a working<br>
table 21 to a welding and cutting device 22. The films are welded together<br>
along the contour lines forming the device as shown in Fig. 1. There are no<br>
welded seams in the funnel shaped opening 13 and in the opening of the<br>
pocket 14. In a preferred embodiment the seams are welded and the device<br>
is cut out at the same time.<br>
The welding and cutting device 22 can include a press form or a similar<br>
device that moves up and down as shown at arrow A, or a laser that welds<br>
and cuts in one step. Also other welding techniques, such as RF-heat-welding<br>
can be used.<br>
As can be seen in Fig. 3 the films 18, 20 are so wide that two devices<br>
fit beside each other. The films can be even wider, so as to allow three or<br>
more devices to be welded and cut at the same time.<br>
In connection with or after the welding and cutting steps the device is<br>
mounted on the plate or sheet 23, which can be formed by paper or a plastic<br>
material. The sheet 23 is fed from a third roll 31 below the working table 21. In<br>
a preferred embodiment the device is attached to the plate 23 in the welding<br>
seams along the contour of the device. It is then a simple measure to release<br>
the device section by section from the plate 23 when the device is used.<br>
In an alternative embodiment the sheet 23 engages the two films before<br>
the welding and cutting device 22. Thereby the films will adhere to the<br>
sheet 23 during the cutting and welding step. The complete device including<br>
the plate 23 is then wrapped into a package. A cutting device 30 moving up<br>
and down as shown at arrow B in Fig. 2 cuts the plates into suitable sizes.<br>
The cutting device can also be a rotating device or a laser device or any other<br>
appropriate device.<br>
The device is sterilised with an appropriate method. Among the sterilization<br>
technologies currently available, ethylene oxide (EtO) gas can be mentioned.<br>
It is also possible to use other methods, such as gamma radiation and<br>
electron-beam radiation. Normally, the device is sterilised in the package.<br>
Fig. 4 is a cross sectional view of the complete device including the<br>
plate 23 wrapped in a package. It should be noted that the extension of the<br>
device in the vertical direction is exaggerated to facilitate the understanding of<br>
the invention. A plastic covering film 24 is wrapped over the device and attached<br>
to the plate 23 to form a sealed and sterile package. Three sections of<br>
the hose 11 and the balloon 10 are discernible as separate hollow spaces.<br>
These hollow spaces will be inflated when a liquid is poured into the container<br>
12. Welded seams 24 are formed where the device is attached to the plate<br>
23.<br>
Dashed lines in Fig. 5 indicate folding lines where the device can be<br>
folded to assume the shape shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. The device is folded<br>
twice towards the centre of the device and the plate 23 will form a protective<br>
cover. By folding the device as shown an extremely compact package will be<br>
achieved. The size can be as small as a few millimetres thick, 350 mm long<br>
and 185 mm wide. A package of that size can be stored and distributed at<br>
very low costs, which in most cases, such as for use in developing countries,<br>
is advantageous.<br>
It is also possible to roll the device to form a product roll. Fig. 8 shows a<br>
product roll 34 where the sheet 23 forms a protective exterior of the roll.<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates schematically the device in use. It should be assumed<br>
that the balloon is located within the uterus. The container 12 is suspended<br>
on a vertical rod 26 extending from a base plate 27. The longitudinal pocket<br>
14 is used for suspending the device. A liquid such as water has been poured<br>
into the container through the funnel shaped opening. An assumed water<br>
level is indicated at 28 and is located at a height of h above the balloon. As<br>
discussed above h should be in the interval of 1-3 m. The length of the hose<br>
is from about 1,0 m to about 3,0 m and preferably from about 1,5 m to 2,5 m.<br>
A suitable lower distance h=1,0 m corresponds to a pressure of about 70 mm<br>
Hg. If air may enter the space between the films during or after the manufacturing<br>
of the device a priming step is taken before the device is used.<br>
If it is desirable to increase the pressure in the balloon further a clamping<br>
element 29 can be mounted on the hose 11, preferably in the area of the<br>
scale 16. The clamping element 29 comprises in the shown embodiment two<br>
cylinders or wheels 32 bearing against each other. The cylinders 32 can be<br>
moved apart, so as to allow the hose to be inserted there between. The cylinders<br>
32 are then pressed against each other as shown in the enlarged detail<br>
view in Fig. 9. In another embodiment (not shown) one cylinder rotates<br>
against an abutment.<br>
By moving the clamping element 29 in the direction of arrow C liquid<br>
within the hose will be forced toward the balloon where the pressure will rise.<br>
The increased pressure within the balloon will contribute to provide a sufficient<br>
pressure on uterine blood vessels to curtail bleeding. The position of the<br>
clamp 29 in relation to the scale will indicate the pressure in lower part of the<br>
hose and in the balloon.<br>
The clamping element 29 can also be used to close the container. It is<br>
then possible to increase the working pressure by enclosing the container 12<br>
in a cuff or similar device. The pressure of the cuff is increased in a conventional<br>
manner and will lead to a corresponding increase of the working pressure.<br>
An advantage of using a non-resilient material is that the pressure that<br>
can be observed in the cuff will be equal to the working pressure of the balloon<br>
and the complete device.<br>
Fig. 10 shows an introducing member 36 that can be used to introduce<br>
the balloon into the uterus. In the embodiment shown the introducing member<br>
comprises an elongated handle 37. The handle is in one end provided with a<br>
head having two extending rounded sections 38 and between said sections a<br>
rounded tip 39. The rounded tip has a size that will allow it to be inserted in<br>
the annular flap 35, when the balloon is to be introduced into the uterus. The<br>
two side sections 38 extend beyond the rounded tip and will ensure that no<br>
damage is caused to the uterus.<br>
The introducing member can be rigid and be made from a plastic material.<br>
It is also possible to form it in paper from the sheet 23. In that case the<br>
introducing member is punched. In another embodiment the introducing<br>
member is formed by a gel that will dissolve in contact with blood and other<br>
body fluids.<br>
In the alternative embodiment shown in Fig. 11 the introducing member<br>
36 comprises a handle 37 with two sticks 40 extending in parallel from the<br>
handle. One of the sticks is arranged on one side of the flat balloon and then<br>
inserted through the annular flap 35 while the other stick extends on the opposite<br>
side of the balloon. With this arrangement it is possible to wind the<br>
empty flattened balloon around the introducing member and then to introduce<br>
it in the uterus.<br>
Normally, the balloon is introduced into the uterus empty and then a<br>
smaller amount of liquid is filled into the balloon. When the balloon is inflated<br>
by the liquid the introducing member can be withdrawn leaving the balloon in<br>
the uterus. Then a suitable amount of liquid is filled into the container 12 and<br>
the container is raised to an appropriate height over the balloon.<br>
In one embodiment the material and the thickness of the hose are chosen<br>
so as to withstand a pressure lower than a pressure where any tissue is<br>
damaged. When the clamping element is used and the pressure is increased<br>
over what can be obtained by positioning the container at a maximum distance<br>
from the balloon the limited strength of the material will ensure that the<br>
pressure is not increased to an injurious level. At higher pressures the hose,<br>
or any other part of the device exposed to the pressure, will rupture. It may be<br>
appropriate to provide the hose with a specific rupture section 33 that will be<br>
an indication of fracture. The section can be formed with a weakened material<br>
or as a thinner part.<br>
In an embodiment where all elements of the device are integrally connected<br>
to each other the device can be produced, stored and transported very<br>
efficiently. The storage and transport will be simplified also as a result of the<br>
thin and compact design. No separate parts or connectors have to be used,<br>
unless a clamping device is included. This design will facilitate in maintaining<br>
the device under sterile condition also during troublesome circumstances.<br>

14. A method as claimed in claim 11, also comprising the steps of feeding a<br>
sheet (23) from a third roll (31) below said lower film (20), adhering the joined<br>
upper film (18) and lower film (20) to said sheet (23) and cutting the sheet<br>
(23) to form a plate including said inflatable balloon (10), said container (12)<br>
and said hose (11).<br>
15. A method as claimed in claim 14, also comprising the steps of folding<br>
twice opposite side edges of said plate towards each other and enclosing<br>
said upper film (18) and said lower film (20) between sides of said sheet (23).<br>
16. A method as claimed in claim 14, also comprising the step of rolling the<br>
plate into a product roll (34), the sheet (23) forming the outside of the product<br>
roll.<br>
17. A method as claimed in claim 11, also comprising the step of feeding a<br>
sheet (23) from a third roll (31) below said lower film (20), joining said upper<br>
film (18) and said lower film (20) and adhering the films to the sheet (23) simultaneously.<br>
An inflatable uterine device to control uterine bleeding, comprising an<br>
inflatable balloon (10) and a hose (11) connecting the balloon to a fluid<br>
source. The fluid source comprises an open container (12). A first end of the<br>
hose can be integrally connected to the inflatable balloon and a second end<br>
of the hose can be integrally connected to the container. A suspension<br>
means (14; 15) is provided at the second end of the hose.<br>
The device is produced by feeding an upper film (18) from a first roll<br>
(17), feeding a lower film (20) from a second roll (19) and joining the films<br>
along contour lines forming an inflatable balloon (10), a container (12) and a<br>
hose (11) connecting the balloon to the container in an open fluid path. The<br>
films are cut outside said contour lines.</td>
