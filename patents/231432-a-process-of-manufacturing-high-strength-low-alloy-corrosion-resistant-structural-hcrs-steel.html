				<td>Introduction to the Field of Invention:<br>
This invention relates to a method for the preparation of high strength Sow alloy corrosion resistant<br>
structurai steel, which is code named as HRCS, which have strength simiiar to that of some of the<br>
existing commercial grades but at lower cost.<br>
Prior Art and Drawbacks:<br>
It is already known to prepare low alloy corrosion resistant steels, which are hot rolled to provide<br>
necessary mechanical properties.<br>
As per the known practice, high strength superior corrosion resistant steel is prepared containing<br>
phosphorus, copper, nickel as well as chromium as alloying elements. Present commercial<br>
grades suffer from the three major drawbacks.<br>
a.	These are very expensive and the cost of preparation is to be seriously monitored.<br>
b.	Greater care for homogenization during production is necessary as the specification caiis for<br>
maintaining larger number of elements in specific range.<br>
c.	These have lower bend formability due to the presence of chromium carbides.<br>
Other drawback, which can also be found in the present practice, is the presence of nickel and<br>
chromium in the alloy. This increases the carbon content/carbon equivalent, in turn affects the<br>
weidability characteristics of the steel. Moreover, the presence of high prosperous limits their<br>
section thickness to 12 mm. max.<br>
A further drawback in present practice is that the steels are generally of killed variety.<br>
Objects of the Invention:<br>
ft is therefore a primary object of the present invention to propose a method for the preparation of<br>
a cost effective high strength corrosion resistant structural steel with proper alloy compositions.<br>
It is another object of this invention to propose such a method by which it is possible to prepare<br>
satisfactory high strength tow alloy corrosion resistant structurai steel.<br><br>
It is a further object of this invention to propose such a method by which it is possible to obtain<br>
high strength low alloy corrosion resistant: structural steel, which we will have satisfactory bend<br>
formability and ductility as well better than the commercially available grades.<br>
It is a still further object of this invention to propose such a process, which will avoid the presence<br>
of or the use of nickel and chromium in the alloy composition.<br>
It is yet another object of this invention to propose such a process by which it is possible to make<br>
the steel either as semi killed or killed condition depending upon the facilities. This is possible by<br>
limiting the silicon content in the composition, which is specified in the presently available<br>
commercial grades in the range of 0.25 to 0.75% by weight.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to ensure that the proposed process is suitable for<br>
preparing semi-killed steel and killed steel. This is more important particularly because as steel<br>
melting shop having ingot casting facilities and yield of killed steel from liquid is inversely about<br>
15% lower by weight compared to semi-killed steel.<br>
it is yet another object of this invention to propose such a process, which will be economical and<br>
significantly reduce the cost because it can be prepared by semi killed form than the killed form<br>
and the preparation of semi killed steel increases the product yield.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose such a process which will reduce a<br>
number of elements specified in the preparation of steel composition and more particularly, which<br>
will avoid nickel, chromium and silicon and concentrate mostly with respect to carbon,<br>
manganese, sulphur, phosphorus and copper.<br>
These and other objects of the invention will be more apparent from the following paragraphs.<br>
Brief Statement of the invention:<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a process for the manufacture of alloy steel of the<br>
invention consists of first making a low carbon steel by the basic open hearth process at a<br>
temperature in the range of 1640±15° C, where after, the heat is tapped in a ladle in which<br>
weighed quantities of ferro-alloy and copper are added when the ladle is 1/3 of 2/a full, there after,<br>
homogenization of the steel with nitrogen and chemical analysis of the molten steel is carried out<br>
such that the final composition exhibits a chemical composition as below.<br><br><br>
Al content upto 0,015 may be added to the steel<br>
It is ensured that the addition of iron, silicon and aluminium are adjusted depending upon<br>
oxidation level of steel and the nitrogen alloying has been used to minimize segregation of<br>
phosphorus at grain boundaries keeping the minimum ratio of phosphorus to nitrogen to<br>
overcome this problem at 10.<br>
During ingot casting of 8 tonnes weight, a small amount of Al is preferably added in the mould<br>
depending upon the metal behaviour during teeming and the ingots are stripped with a track time<br>
of at least two hours followed by heating and soaking at a temperature of 1250° C, the soaking<br>
time being not less than 1 and 1/2 times the track time.<br>
in this process, excessive oxidation is avoided to reduce hot shortness and the rolled bioom/billet,<br>
after heating, is rolled in light or heavy structural milI depending upon the section thickness.<br>
We have found that atleast 80 parts per million of nitrogen is to be added to add about 0.1% of<br>
phosphorus to avoid segregation at the grain boundaries.<br>
Further Details of the Process of Manufacture:<br>
The process of manufacture consists of making of low carbon steel in the twin open hearth<br>
furnace followed by tapping the steel at temperature of 1640±15° C. The heat is tapped in the<br>
ladle where weighted quantity of ferro-alloys and copper are added when the ladle is 1/3 to 2/3 full.<br>
This follows homogenization with nitrogen and chemical analysis of the molten steel to meet the<br>
specific composition requirements. The presence of nitrogen in the range of 100 to 150 ppm<br>
(depending upon Phosphorus addition) is essential to avoid segregation of phosphorous at the<br>
grain boundaries in the finished product.<br>
The addition of Fe. Si and Al shall be adjusted depending upon the oxidation level of the final<br>
bath. During ingot casting of 8 tonnes weight, a small amount of Al may be added in the mould<br>
depending upon the metal behavior during teeming.<br><br>
The ingot are stripped with a track time of at least 2 hours followed by soaking at a temperature of<br>
1250° C with the time duration not less than 1% times the track time. The oxygen content in the<br>
atmosphere is to be maintained to ≤0.5% to void excessive oxidation, which may lead to hot<br>
shortness due to excessive oxidation. It is found that in the other commerciai grade containing P,<br>
Cu, Ni, Cr and Si as additions, the scale is scky and requires extra efforts to remove but no such<br>
problem arises in this case. However a special emphasis should be given for removal of the<br>
scale. The rolled bioom/billet after heating is rolled in light/heavy structural miil depending<br>
upon the section size.<br>
After rolling, the product is tested for mechanical properties and metallographic features.<br>
Electron micro probe analysis shows that the phosphorous is uniformly distributed in the steel and<br>
no segregation was observed at the grain boundaries. Laboratory experience also shows that if<br>
bend formability is better than IT, then also this segregation is minimum. The micro structure<br>
consist of mainly ferrite with about 10-12% of pearlite. The grain size of the steel was ASTM 8<br>
and finer.<br>
in the accompanying tables, we have stated the obvious properties of the known commercial<br>
products art as well as a properties of the invented steel.<br>
Table 1 clearly states the chemical composition of the low alloy corrosion resistant structural steel<br>
as per the invention.<br>
Table 2 clearly states the mechanical properties of hot rolled low alloy corrosion resistant steel of<br>
the commercial grades, which are as stated earlier, only killed variety.<br>
Table 3 clearly states the chemical compositions of the product of the invention with reference to<br>
heat 1 and heat 2 attention is invited to the extensive work details discussed herein below.<br>
Table 4 clearly states the mechanical properties of the rolled product of the invention.<br>
The Details of the Extensive Laboratory Wort:<br>
Extensive laboratory work was done to achieve high strength with minimum corrosion index of 6<br>
(as per ASTM G 101), subsequently two semi killed 250 tonne heats were made at commercial<br>
Plant. The heats were made in twin hearth and cast to ingots of 8 tons. The hot ingots were<br>
initially rolled to blooms and then to channels of 300 and 600 mm as well as angles of<br><br>
65 x 65 x 6 mm. Similarly, four killed heats were made in the laboratory and rolled to 6 mm<br>
plates in two stages of rolling. In this investigation, a ratio of P to N has been found to be 10 (min)<br>
to avoid P segregation. Based upon the mechanical tests and metallurgical investigations,<br>
a Cu -P steei is recommended for use by railways for manufacture of rolling stocks.<br>
We also state below the chemical composition and mechanical properties in a brief manner.<br>
Further the product range of the steel of the invention can be used joists channel, angles and<br>
other shapes.<br>
