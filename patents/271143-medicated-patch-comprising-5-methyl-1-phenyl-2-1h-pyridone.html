Effects of the Invention [0007]<br>
In the medicated patch including 5-methyl-l-phenyl-2-(lH)-pyridone of the present invention, the solubility of the active component<br>
(5-methyl-l-phenyl-2-(lH)-pyridone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) in the base material is improved by selecting and using a suitable dissolving agent depending on the base material (an aqueous base material or a rubber-type base material) to be used. Therefore, the skin permeability of the active component is high, the active component may be retained in an amount sufficient for exhibiting medicinal effect in the base material, and the medicinal effect is sustained for a long time period.<br>
Furthermore, the medicated patch including 5-methyl-l-phenyl-2-(lH)-pyridone of the present invention has preferable adhesion, flexibility and/or aggregability for medicated patches by selecting a suitable dissolving agent according to the base material, and combining the dissolving agent with a specific base material component.<br>

[0038]<br>
Hereinafter, the usefulness of the present invention will be described with referring to Examples and Test Examples, but the present invention is not limited by these. Unless otherwise mentioned, the part is based on mass.<br>
Examples [0039] Example 1<br>
Sodium polyacrylate (5 parts), acrylic acid starch (2.5 parts), carboxymethylcellulose sodium (1 part) and concentrated glycerin (30 parts) were mixed (liquid A).    5-Methyl-l-phenyl-2-(lH)-pyridone (2 parts or 3 parts) as an active component and tartaric acid (1 part) and water (54.13 parts or 53.16 parts) were mixed (liquid B).    Peppermint oil (1 part, dissolving agent) was dissolved in a surfactant (0.3 part) (liquid C).    Liquids B and C were added to liquid A, and a polyacrylic acid copolymerized emulsion (3 parts) and an aluminum hydroxide gel (0.04 part) were added and stirred evenly.    This mixture (percutaneously absorbable preparation) was flatted on a polyethylene film (liner) to form a percutaneously absorbable preparation layer, and the layer was coated with polyester nonwoven fabric (substrate).    This was cut into a desired size to give a medicated patch of Example 1 including 5-methyl-l-phenyl-2-(lH)-pyridone by 2% or 3%. [0040] Example 2<br>
Polyisobutylene (10 parts), a styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer (25 parts), dibutylhydroxytoluene (0.5 part), liquid paraffin (39.5 parts), a petrolatum resin (17 parts) were mixed at 140°C (liquid A).    5-methyl-l-phenyl-2-(lH)-pyridone (3 parts) as an active component was evenly mixed into propylene glycol (5 parts) (dissolving agent).<br>
Liquid A was heated to 120°C, and liquid B was added to liquid A and mixed.   This mixture (percutaneously absorbable preparation) was flatted on polyester nonwoven fabric (substrate) to form a percutaneously absorbable preparation layer, which was coated with a polyester film (liner), cooled to room temperature and then cut into a desired size to give a medicated patch of Example 2 including 5-methyl-l-phenyl-2-(lH)-pyridone by 3%. [0041]<br>
Test Example 1: in vitro skin permeability test 1) Test method<br>
Under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, the abdomen of a male Wistar rat (7-week old) was shaved, the skin was excised, and the lipid on the dermis of the skin was carefully removed.   The skin was adhered the dermis-side down on a vertical diffusion cell in which water at 37°C had been circulated in advance, and the 2%-medicated patch produced in Example 1, which was punched out by a diameter of 1 cm, was adhered on the center portion of the skin and fixed by clipping with a dome-shaped cell.    The receiver liquid, which had been warmed in an isothermal bath at 37°C, was then put into the dermis-side, an L-shaped tube was attached to a sampling port and fixed, and a certain amount of receiver solution was further added.    The receiver solution was stirred with a magnetic stirrer, a certain amount of receiver solution was taken over time, and the same amount of receiver solution was supplied.   The amount of the active component (5-methyl-l-phenyl-2-(lH)-pyridone) in the collected sample was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using the following conditions to calculate the accumulated skin permeation amount and skin permeation rate of 5-methyl-l-phenyl-2-(lH)-pyridone.    The results are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. <hplc conditions><br>
Column: CAPCELL PAK C,8 5 urn 4.6 x 150 mm Column temperature: 40°C Flow rate: 1 mL/min Detection wavelength: 318 nm Injection amount: 10 µL<br>
Mobile phase: acetonitrile:methanol:50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 2.7) = 225:100:675 (9:4:27) 2) Results (1) Accumulated skin permeation amount of 5-methyl-l-phenyl-2-(lH)-pyridone<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, at 12 hours after adhesion to the skin, only about 20% of the active component (5-methyl-l-phenyl-2-(lH)-pyridone) remained in the medicated patch<br>
of Example 1.   In other word, about 90% of the active component in total was released to (permeated) the skin from the medicated patch of Example 1 over 24 hours.<br>
From this fact, it was found that the medicated patch including 5-methyl-l-phenyl-2-(lH)-pyridone of the present invention was excellent in skin permeability of the active component and sustentation of its medicinal effect. (2) Skin permeation rate of 5-methyl-l-phenyl-2-(lH)-pyridone<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the skin permeation rate of the active component (5-methyl-l-phenyl-2-(lH)-pyridone) of the medicated patch of Example 1 was as very fast as 0.1 mg/cm2/h or more within 3 hours after adhesion to the skin.<br>
From this fact, it was found that the medicated patch including 5-methyl-l-phenyl-2-(lH)-pyridone of the present invention was excellent in immediate effectivity. [0042] Test Example 2: Treatment test on hypertrophic scar<br>
1)	Test method<br>
Swine (18-week old/Duroc strain/sexuality female) in which hypertrophic scar had been formed by cutting at a swinery were divided into three groups including a control group, a base material group and a 3%-medicated patch group.    The medicated patch of Example 1 and a medicated patch which was similar to Example 1 except that 5-methyl-l-phenyl-2-(lH)-pyridone was removed from the percutaneously absorbable preparation layer were each adhered on the hypertrophic scar site of the swine in the 3%-medicated patch group and the base material group once a day for 24 hours, from 25 days after formation of the incised wound.<br>
After 9 weeks, the thickness of the isolated skin (scared skin) on the hypertrophic scar site and the thickness of the normal isolated skin of the swine in each group were measured using a digital scale.<br>
A static analysis was performed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test for the obtained thicknesses of the scared skin and normal skin of the swine in the three groups. The results are shown in Fig. 3.<br>
In Fig. 3, ** represents p 
2)	Results<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, in the group of the medicated patch to which the medicated patch of the present invention including 5-methyl-l-phenyl-2-(lH)-pyridone and the dissolving agent in combination in the percutaneously absorbable preparation layer was used, the thickness of the scared skin was decreased (recovered) to about the thickness of<br>
the normal skin, whereas the thickness of the scared skin was decreased little in the base material group in which the percutaneously absorbable preparation layer did not include the combination.<br>
From the above-mentioned result, it was found that the medicated patch including 5-methyl-l-phenyl-2-(lH)-pyridone of the present invention was effective in the prophylaxis and treatment of hypertrophic scars using swine as models.<br>
Since such result could be obtained in the skin of swine, which have a similar skin structure to that of humans, the medicated patch including<br>
5-methyl-l-phenyl-2-(lH)-pyridone of the present invention may be considered to be similarly effective for the prophylaxis and treatment of hypertrophic scars in humans.<br>
Furthermore, from the result of the above-mentioned hypertrophic scar test, the medicated patch including 5-methyl-l-phenyl-2-(lH)-pyridone of the present invention may be considered to be similarly effective for the prophylaxis and treatment of other skin diseases such as keloid, contact dermatitis, infectious verruca (wart), pustulosis palmaris et plantaris or fibrous skin disease to which 5-methyl-l-phenyl-2(lH)-pyridone is effective as a treatment drug.<br>
