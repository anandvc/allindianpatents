The invention relates to a pneumatically operated valve cleaning and testing machine for reuse particularly for LPG cylinders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
One of the major replacement expenses for the oil industry is due to replacement of defective valves generated at plants. On an average atleast 1% of the valves are replaced in a bottling plant of LPG. Various attempts has been made to reduce the cost of such replacement of valves.<br>
As a development research it has been identified the various causes of failure and explore the possibility of salvaging the defective valves by rectifying the defects in a co.-3:t- effective and safe manner so that the life of the valves are extended.<br>
The result of the research has identified to the following major causes of failure of the valves.<br><br>
1)	Heavy deposits of dirt on the valve spindle gasket resulting in an uneven contact with the valve seat thereby causing leakage.<br>
2)	Depression of the spindle gasket after prolonged usage thereby preventing a leak proof seal of the gasket against the seat.<br>
3)	Weakening of the valve spring with reduced spring force in some cases which result in inadequate pressure of the gasket against the valve seat, thus resulting in leakage.<br>
4)	Due to the failure of the spring and dimensional error due to wear and tear of the valve housing, the valve pin gets stuck frequently.<br>
Out of the above four categories the failure due to heavy deposits of dirt on the valve spindle is about 50 to 60%. The replacement cost of the vlves can be considerably reduced by servicing the dirt accumulated defective valves.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore the main object of the invention is to provide a phe/.umatically operated valve cleaning and testing machine to extend the valve life and thereby achieving enormous savings to the oil industry.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a pneumatically operated valve cleaning and testing machine for retrieval of valves in which the valves are tested for leakage and safety. The valves are also checked if the valve threads are worn out causing a leakage.<br><br>
According to the present invention there is provided a pneumatically operated valve cleaning: and testing machine comprising a valve manifold with a plurality of bungs in which a plurality of defective valves to be retrieved are screw mounted* a plurality of injection nozzles s.r&amp; positioned on said valves to be retrieved, said nozzles being connected to a. kerosene container and an air supply valve said valve manifold being connected to said kerosene container through a. low pressure leak check valve for pneumatically cleaning and testing the valves to be retrieved.<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to the nan limiting exemplary embodiments of the invention represented in the accompanying drawing :<br><br>
Figure  1  shows  schematically the apparatus  for cleaning<br>
and testing valves. Figure  2  shows  the  pneumatic  circuit  for  cleaning  and<br>
low pressure test, Figure 3 shows   the pneumatic circuit for high pressure<br>
test. DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The defective valves to be retrieved are screw mounted on the bungs of the manifold (8) at hand tight. The injection nozzle jets (15) is positioned on the valves by closing the aligning sheet (16) and clamping it rigid with the lock knob (17). Figure 1 shows the aligning sheet (16) with four injection/jet nozzle (15).<br>
Operating the button kerosene ON off valve (1) activates the Pneumatic Valve Retrieval apparatus. The pneumatic suply is branched to gas stop valve (3) and timer (5). The gas stop valve (3) controls the flow of kerosene from the container (9) to the injection nozzle (15) through the shuttle valve (4). The timer ( 5 )controls the operating time of the gas stop valve (3) i.e. 10 to 15 seconds. After the lapse of the stipulated time, the timer/puts in the kerosene ON valve (1) to OFF mode.<br><br>
This kerosene ensures the loosening of the dirt particles from the inside of the defective valve.<br>
The kerosene wash is followed by high pressure air flushing for effective cleaning.<br>
Operating the button on air supply valve (2) the pneumatic supply is branched to the injection nozzle (15) and timer (6). The high-pressure air supply flows through the shuttle valve (4) and the injection nozzle (15) into the defective valve and flushes the dirt. The timer (6) holds the reset supply air for 15 seconds. On lapse of the stipulated time the timer puts the air supply valve (2) to OFF mode.<br>
This operation ensures the complete flushing of the dirt particle. For better result this operation can be performed twice or thrice.<br>
The cleaned defective valves are checked for leak at normal pneumatic pressure. By operating the leak check (LP) valve (7) the pneumatic supply is forced into the valve manifold, the leak detector (not shown) placed on the cleaned Valve indicates whether the valve is leaky (bubbles observed) or good (no bubbles). The good valves are segregated.<br><br>
The segregated good valves from normal pressure leak test<br>
2 are subjected to leak test at high-pressure (17.5Kg/cm ). The<br>
good  valves  segregated  are  fixed  tightly  on  the  valve<br>
holder  (14). The high pressure leak check valve (10) is then<br>
activated.  This  activates  the  to/fro movement of the piston<br>
in the big cylinder of the pneumatic booster (11). This piston<br>
movement intensifies  the regulator (12) of the air supply in<br>
the small cylinder of the booster (11) to high pressure output<br>
which amounts to 17.5 kg/cm  in the pressure gauge (13). The<br>
high pneumatic presure generated  is forced through the valve<br>
holder  (14).  The  leak detector placed on the valve indicates<br>
whether  the  valve  is  leaky  (bubbles  observed)  or  good  (no<br>
bubbles) .<br>
This  operation  certifies  the  quality  of  the  retrieved valve. The sound valves can be taken up for use.<br>
The life of the retrieved valves can be further enhanced by replacing the '0' ring.<br>
The Leak Detector is to detect pin leak only. KEORSENE should be used as the detecting medium.<br><br>
