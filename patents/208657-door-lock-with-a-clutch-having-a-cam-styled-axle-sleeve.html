For more particular understanding of the actions, please refer to Figs. 8-8c, in raising the handles 11, 21, the second rotation axle 28 is moved, and the cross shaped axle 23 linked up therewith too, thereby the dead bolt 3 stretches out of the door 5; meantime, the second rotation axle 28 rotates the cam-styled axle sleeve 16 to rotate the lowest point of the gradually bevel surface of the engaging<br><br>
edge 163 of the cam-styled axle sleeve 16 to where the abutting block 83 is, there is no impedance now, the abutting block 83 is resiliently sent forth downwardly to place one end thereof on the engaging edge 163. When the handles 11, 21 are released to retrieve the engaging edge 163 to their original positions, the abutting block 83 gradually engages the cam-styled axle sleeve 16 along the gradually bevel surface of the engaging edge 163 to retract it for positioning, thereby the second rotation axle 28 is separated from the cam-styled axle sleeve 16. In such a situation, the door 5 can not be opened no matter how the handle 11 is rotated outside of the house; however, by pressing the handle 21 of the inner lock part 2, it can not only open the door 5, but also as shown in Fig. 9, the handle 21 may move the flange 173 of the rotating ring 17 to fiirther move the abutting block 83 upwards, so that the cam-styled axle sleeve 16 is not engaged by it and is forwarded to engage with the second rotation axle 28.<br>
Referring to Figs. 10-12, to avoid damage of the handles 11, 21 by overly large retrieving spring force after raising or down pressing, this embodiment is provided on the housing 20 of the inner lock part 2 near the axle seat 24 with the engaging seat 29 which is engaged thereon with the spring 291, the other end of the spring 291 is engaged with the axle seat 24, so that the axle seat 24 can be rebounded after is pulled. This can reduce the resilient force of the handles 11, 21 when in retrieving after they are raised and pressed down.<br>
And more, the locking member 12 can bring the abutting block 83 upwardly to separate from the cam-styled axle sleeve 16 by insertion of a key into the key hole 121, so that the cam-styled axle sleeve 16 can be forwarded to engage with the second rotation axle 28 to open the door 5 from outside of the house.<br>
To achieve the object of theft proofing, this embodiment is provided on the<br><br>
lectric circuit device 801 on the housing 10 of the outer lock part 1 with an alarm evice 18 (as shown in Fig. 4), and the lock core rod 122 of the locking member 12 5 provided thereon with a contact member 124 which can contact the alarm device 8 when the key is inserted into the key hole 121 to rotate the locking member 12 nd make a loud alarm, at this time, a correct code must be input to remove the larm.<br>
When a code is input for getting in the house, if the times of wrong inputting lat the householder set is reached, the alarm device 18 makes alarm too, and the isplay lamp 71 on the control panel 7 also continuously displays the message of /rongness until the householder clears off the message.<br>
