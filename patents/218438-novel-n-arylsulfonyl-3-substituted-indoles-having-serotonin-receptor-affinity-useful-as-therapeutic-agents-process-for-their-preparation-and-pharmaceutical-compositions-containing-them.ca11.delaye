The present invention also relates to the process for preparing the compounds of general formula (I), their derivatives, their analogs, their tautomeric forms, their stereoisomers, their geometric forms, their N-oxides, their polymorphs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, their pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, the novel intermediates involved therein and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions containing them.<br>
The compounds of the general formula (I) of this invention are 5-HT (Serotonin) ligands e.g. agonists or antagonists. Thus, compounds of general formula (I) of this invention are useful for treating diseases wherein modulation of 5-HT (Serotonin) activity is desired.   Specifically, the compounds of this invention are useful in the<br><br>
treatment and / or prophylaxis of psychosis, paraphrenia, psychotic depression, mania, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorders, anxiety, migraine headache, depression, drug addiction, convulsive disorders, personality disorders, hypertension, autism, postÂ¬traumatic stress syndrome, alcoholism, panic attacks, obsessive-compulsive disorders and sleep disorders. The compounds of general formula (I) of this invention are also useful to treat psychotic, affective, vegetative and psychomotor symptoms of schizophrenia and the extrapyramidal motor side effects of other antipsychotic drugs.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) of this invention are also useful to treat neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer"s disease, Parkinsonism and Huntington"s chorea and chemotherapy-induced vomiting. The compounds of general formula (I) of this invention are also useful in modulation of eating behavior and thus are useful in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with excess weight. Background of the Invention<br>
Many diseases of the central nervous system are influenced by the adrenergic, the dopaminergic and the serotenergic neurotransmitter systems. Serotonin has been implicated in a number of diseases and conditions, which originate in the central nervous system. These include diseases and conditions related to sleeping, eating, perceiving pain, controlling body temperature, controlling blood pressure, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and other bodily states. (References: Fuller, R. W., Drugs Acting on Serotonergic Neuronal Systems, Biology of Serotonergic Transmission, John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. (1982), 221-247; Boullin D. J., Serotonin in Mental abnormalities (1978), 1, 316; Barchas J. et. al., Serotonin and Behavior (1973)). Serotonin also plays an important role in the peripheral systems, such as the gastrointestinal system, where it has been found to mediate a variety of contractile, secretory and electrophysiologic effects.<br>
Due to the broad distribution of serotonin within the body, there is lot of interest and use, in the drugs that affect serotonergic systems. Particularly, preferred are the compounds which have receptor specific agonism and/or antagonism for the treatment of a wide range of disorders, including anxiety, depression, hypertension, migraine, obesity, compulsive disorders, schizophrenia, autism, neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer"s disease, Parkinsonism and Huntington"s chorea and chemotherapy-induced vomiting (References: Gershon M. D. et. al., The peripheral actions of 5-Hydroxytryptamine (1989), 246; Saxena P. R. et. al., Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology (1990), supplement 7, 15).<br><br>
The major classes of serotonin receptors (5-HTV7) contain fourteen to eighteen separate receptors that have been formally classified (References: Glennon et al, Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews (1990), 14, 35 and Hoyer D. et al, Pharmacol. Rev. (1994), 46, 157-203). Recently discovered information regarding sub-type identity, distribution, structure and function suggests that it is possible to identify novel, sub-type specific agents having improved therapeutic profiles with lesser side effects. The 5-HT6 receptor was identified in 1993 (References: Monsma et al, Mol. Pharmacol. (1993), 43, 320-327 and Ruat M. et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. (1993), 193, 269-276). Several antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics bind to the 5-HT6 receptor with high affinity and this binding may be a factor in their profile of activities (References: Roth et al, J. Pharm. Exp. Therapeut. (1994), 268, 1403-1410; Sleight et al, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents (1998), 8, 1217-1224; Bourson et al, Brit. J. Pharmacol. (1998), 125, 1562-1566; Boess et al, Mol. Pharmacol., 1998, 54, 577-583; Sleight et al, Brit. J. Pharmacol. (1998), 124, 556-562). In addition, 5-HT6 receptor has been linked to generalized stress and anxiety states (Reference: Yoshioka et al, Life Sciences (1998), 17/18,1473-1477). Together these studies and observations suggest that compounds that antagonize the 5-HT6 receptor will be useful in treating various disorders of the central nervous system.<br>

1-Benzenesulfonyl-1 H-indol-3-ylmethanol (D 51)<br>
In a three necked round bottom flask equipped with pressure equalizing funnel, 1-Benzenesulfonyl-1H-indole-3-carboxaldehyde (D1, 2.86 g, 0.01 mole) and dichloromethane (8 ml_) were taken. Sodiumborohydride (0.005 - 0.01 mole) was added slowly at room temperature and the reaction mixture was stirred well for next 3-4 hours. After the completion of reaction (TLC, 3-5 hours), the product was isolated by distillation under reduced pressure. The residue was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 25 ml_). The combined organic extracts were washed with water, followed by brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The organic layer was evaporated under vacuum. The residue was generally an oily liquid, which was isolated and purified by<br><br>
flash chromatography (silica gel, EtOAc/Hexane, 2/8) to afford the title compound, which was identified by IR, NMR and mass spectral analyses.<br>

A solution of 5-Chloro-3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-ylmethyl)-2-phenyl-1 H-indole (D172, 2.63 g, 0.01 moles) in THF (25 mL) was cooled to -78 Â°C. To this well-stirred solution, n-butyl lithium (0.7 g, 0.011 moles, 4.4 mL of 2.5 M solution in hexanes) was added slowly maintaining the temperature below -70 Â°C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 minutes, and benzenesulfonyl chloride (1.94 g, 0.011 moles) was added slowly maintaining the temperature below -70 Â°C over 10 minutes. The reaction mixture was stirred for another 1 hour, after which the reaction was allowed to come to 25 Â°C gradually and stirred for 1 hour. After the completion of reaction (TLC), the reaction mixture was quenched using ice- cold water (100 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (20 mL x 3). The combined organic extracts were washed with water and brine and dried over sodium sulfate. Volatile impurities were distilled off under reduced pressure to obtain the crude residue. The residue obtained was purified by flash chromatography (silica gel, EtOAc/TEA, 9.9/0.1) to afford the compound, which was identified by IR, NMR and mass spectral analyses as the title compound.
