				<td>A METHOD FOR ESTABLISHING A PUSH-TO-TALK (FIT)<br>
COMMUNICATION SESSION IN A WIRELESS<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AND A MOBILE STATION<br>
Cross-reference(s) to Related Application(s)<br>
The present application claims priority from provisional application serial no.<br>
60/533,842, entitled "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PROVIDING PUSH-TO-<br>
TALK SERVICES IN A CELLULAR COMMUNICATION SYSTEM," filed December<br>
31, 2003, which is commonly owned and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to cellular communication systems, and, in<br>
particular, to provision of Push-To-Talk communication services in an interconnect<br>
cellular communication system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Recently it has been proposed to add dispatch capabilities to Code Division<br>
Multiple Access (CDMA) communications systems, such as a cdma2000 communication<br>
system. Unlike the interconnect services provided by today's cellular systems, dispatch<br>
services have been traditionally provided by two-way radio systems. Traditional dispatch<br>
services typically allow for instant access by a mobile station originating a call to a target<br>
mobile station. For example, a dispatch group call service enables a user to communicate<br>
with a group of people simultaneously and instantaneously, typically by depressing a<br>
Push-To-Talk (PTT) key. Using a cellular system, such a call could not occur<br>
instantaneously since either telephone numbers would need to be dialed for a three-way<br>
call or arrangements would need to be made to setup a conference call. A dispatch point-<br>
to-point call service enables a user to communicate with another user quickly and<br>
spontaneously, again typically by depressing a PTT key. This feature is ideal for two<br>
people who are working together but are unable to speak with one another directly such<br>
as two people working in concert but in different parts of a building. Where a wireless<br>
telephone call may be more appropriate for a conversation, short messages between two<br>
people as they work are better facilitated by the dispatch point-to-point call service.<br>
Low delay is a critical factor in any dispatch call. For example, setup delay that is<br>
acceptable for a typical interconnect voice call can be unacceptable for dispatch services<br>
which rely on a very fast connection being made to the called party. Accordingly,<br>
dispatch services provide an instant access call setup. However, a problem in<br>
implementing a dispatch system in a cellular communication system is that the average<br>
time that it takes a user to navigate a phone book appearing on a display screen of a<br>
cellular phone, select an entry, and then set up a PTT phone call is anything but<br>
instantaneous.<br>
In the proposals for implementation of dispatch in a CDMA system, it typically<br>
takes approximately 3-4 seconds to initiate a PTT phone call by a user of an originating<br>
cellular phone, that is, to depress a PTT key after getting to the cellular phone's phone<br>
book. Upon the user selecting an entry and depressing the FIT key, the cellular phone<br>
conveys a call origination message to the infrastructure identifying one or more cellular<br>
phones or a talkgroup associated with the selected entry. In response to receiving the call<br>
origination message, the infrastructure conveys a paging message to the one or more<br>
identified cellular phones or to one or more cellular phones associated with the identified<br>
talkgroup. In response to receiving the page, each called cellular phone wakes up and<br>
conveys a page response back to the infrastructure. A PTT phone call is then set up. This<br>
process of waking up a called cellular phone and establishing a PTT phone call may take<br>
another 3-4 seconds. In addition, the user of the originating cellular phone is not<br>
permitted to speak until receiving a Talk Permit Tone (TPT), which is not conveyed to<br>
the user until traffic channels are established between the infrastructure and the one or<br>
more called cellular phones. As a result, 9-10 seconds may expire between a time that the<br>
user of the originating cellular phone determines to initiate a PTT phone call and a time<br>
that the user is permitted to speak.<br>
Therefore, a need exists for a method and apparatus that reduces a delay before<br>
conversation may be initiated in a PTT phone call in a cellular communication system.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
To address the need for a method and an apparatus that reduces a delay before<br>
conversation is initiated in a PTT phone call, a communication system is provided that<br>
provides, in association with an originating mobile station (MS), a 'wake up' list of other<br>
mobile stations (MSs) that may be awakened prior to the originating MS requesting to set<br>
up a PTT call. To further reduce the delay, the user may begin speaking prior to<br>
completion of the call setup. The speech is stored and is conveyed to a called MS when<br>
the call is setup. If the call does not get setup or a user of the called MS is not present,<br>
the stored speech may be conveyed to the called MS as a voice message. The stored<br>
speech, or new speech, may also be used as an announcement of a call instead of the<br>
typical "beep" or "chirp."<br>
Generally, an embodiment of the present invention encompasses a method for<br>
establishing a Push-To-Talk (PTT) communication session in a wireless communication<br>
system. The method includes receiving a request to wake up a mobile station, in response<br>
to receiving the request to wake up a mobile station, waking up the mobile station, and<br>
receiving a request to set up a PTT communication session with the mobile station,<br>
wherein the request to set up a PTT communication session is received after receipt of the<br>
request to wake up the mobile station.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a method for<br>
establishing a PTT communication session in a wireless communication system. The<br>
method includes receiving a request from a user of a mobile station to set up a PTT<br>
communication session, receiving speech from the user of the mobile station prior to<br>
completion of the set up of the communication session, storing the received speech to<br>
produce stored speech, and, when set up of the communication session is completed,<br>
conveying the stored speech.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a method for<br>
establishing a PTT communication session in a wireless communication system. The<br>
method includes receiving a request from a user of a first mobile station to set up a PTT<br>
communication session, receiving speech from the user, and conveying the received<br>
speech as an alert to a second mobile station.<br>
. Still another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a control switch<br>
comprising a processor that receives a request to wake up a mobile station, in response to<br>
receiving the request to wake up a mobile station, wakes up the mobile station, and<br>
receives a request to set up a PTT communication session with the mobile station,<br>
wherein the request to wake up a mobile station is received prior to receipt of the request<br>
to set up a PTT communication session with the mobile station.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a mobile station<br>
that receives an indication from a user of the mobile station of the user's desire to initiate<br>
a PTT communication session, in response to receiving the indication, conveys a request<br>
to wake up another mobile station, and subsequent to receiving the indication from the<br>
user of the user's desire to initiate a Push-To-Talk (PTT) communication session, and<br>
receives an instruction from the user to set up a PTT communication session.<br>
Still another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a mobile station<br>
that receives a request from a user of the mobile station to set up a PTT communication<br>
session, receives speech from the user of the mobile station prior to completion of the set<br>
up of the communication session, stores the received speech to produce stored speech<br>
and, when set up of the communication session is completed, and conveys the stored<br>
speech.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a mobile station<br>
that receives a request from a user of the mobile station to set up a PTT communication<br>
session, receives speech from the user, and conveys the received speech as an alert to<br>
another mobile station.<br>
The present invention may be more fully described with reference to FIGs. 1-6B.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a wireless communication system 100 in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Communication system 100 includes multiple<br>
Base Station Systems (BSSs) 110, 1.20, 130 (three shown). Each BSS of the multiple<br>
BSSs 110, 120, 130 includes a respective Base Transceiver Station (BTS) 112, 122, 132<br>
that is operably coupled to a respective Base Station Controller (BSC) 114, 124, 134.<br>
Each BSS of the multiple BSSs 110, 120, 130 is operably coupled to a respective Packet<br>
Data Service Node (PDSN) of multiple PDSNs 116, 126, 136. Although not shown,<br>
communication system 100 may further include a Packet Control Function (PCF) or a<br>
Packet Control Unit (PCU) included in each BSC 114, 124, 134 or interposed between<br>
each such BSC and a respective PDSN 116, 126, 136. Each BSS of the multiple BSSs<br>
110, 120, 130 is further coupled to a respective Mobile Switching Center (MSC) of<br>
multiple MSCs 118, 128, 138. However, those who are of ordinary skill in the art realize<br>
that one or more of BSSs 110, 120, and 130 may share a PDSN and/or an MSC, rather<br>
than being coupled to a separate PDSN and MSC, without departing from the spirit and<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
Communication system 100 further comprises multiple mobile stations (MSs)<br>
102, 103, 104 (three shown) that are each a member of a talkgroup 105. Each MS of the<br>
multiple MSs 102-104 is in wireless communication with a respective BSS of the<br>
multiple BSSs 110, 120, 130. Each BSS 110, 120, 130 provides communications<br>
services to a respective MS 102-104 via a respective air interface 106, 107, 108 that<br>
includes a forward link and a reverse link. Each forward link includes a paging channel,<br>
at least one forward link control channel, and at least one forward link traffic channel.<br>
Each reverse link includes a reverse link- access channel, at least one reverse link control<br>
channel, and at least one reverse link traffic channel.<br>
Each MSC 118, 128, 138 further connects to a public network, such as a Public<br>
Land Mobile Network (PLMN) or a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) 160,<br>
thereby providing a circuit switched network for a communication session involving any<br>
one or more of MSs 102-104. Each PDSN 116, 126, 136 further connects to an Internet<br>
Protocol (IP) network 140, thereby providing a packet switched network for a<br>
communication session involving any one or more of MSs 102-104. Communication<br>
system 100 further includes a Location Database 142, an Active Directory 144, a Packet<br>
Data Control Switch 146, and a Presence Server 148 that are each operably coupled to IP<br>
network 140. Through IP network 140, each PDSN 116, 126, 136, and thereby each BSS<br>
110, 120, 130 and MS 102-104, is able to access Location Database 142, Active Directory<br>
144, and Packet Data Control Switch 146. Communication system 100 further includes<br>
an external IP network 170, such as the Internet, that is operably coupled to IP network<br>
140. BSSs 110, 120, and 130, PDSNs 116, 126, and 136, MSCs 118, 128, and 138, IP<br>
network 140, Location Database 142, Active Directory 144, and Packet Data Control<br>
Switch 146 are collectively referred to herein as an infrastructure ISO of communication<br>
system 100.<br>
Location Database 142 maintains a record of a mobile identifier (mobile ID)<br>
associated with each MS 102-104 active in communication system 100 and further<br>
maintains and tracks provisioning and mobility information with respect to each such<br>
MS, including registration of the MS when the MS activates in communication system<br>
100. Among the information maintained in Location Database 142 is a location of each<br>
MS 102-104 active in communication system 100, such as a BSS serving the MS.<br>
Location Database 142 may be implemented in a Home Location Register (HLR) or a<br>
Visited Location Register (VLR) as known in the art, or a combination of a HLR and a<br>
VLR, or a combination of one or more HLRs and/or VLRs.<br>
Active Directory 144, also known as a Group Call Registry ("GCR"), comprises a<br>
database system containing the talkgroup, or user group, data. Active Directory 144<br>
maintains a definition of all talkgroups, such as talkgroup 105, in the system 100,<br>
including a talkgroup identifier (talkgroup ID) that is uniquely associated with each<br>
talkgroup and, in association with the talkgroup ID, a list of mobile identifiers (mobile<br>
IDs) that are uniquely associated with MSs, such as MSs 102-104, that are members of<br>
the talkgroup. When an inquiry to Active Directory 144 specifies a talkgroup identifier,<br>
that is, requests a definition of a specified talkgroup, in response the directory provides a<br>
list of mobile IDs associated with the members of the specified talkgroup. For example,<br>
in response to an inquiry specifying a talkgroup ID associated with talkgroup 105, Active<br>
Directory 144 may provide the mobile IDs associated with MSs 102-104.<br>
Packet Data Control Switch 146 comprises a Push-to-Talk (FIT) server that<br>
implements group call logic. Preferably, Packet Data Control Switch 146 operates as<br>
described in U.S. patent application serial no. 09/721,329, filed November 22, 2000, and<br>
entitled "System and Method of Servicing Mobile Communications with a Proxy<br>
Switch," which application is assigned to the assignee of the present application and is<br>
hereby incorporated herein in its entirety. Packet Data Control Switch 146 detects a<br>
group call initiation by a respective member of a talkgroup, such as one of MSs 102-104<br>
with respect to talkgroup 105, and automatically attempts to connect all of the members<br>
of the group in a group call.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of Packet Data Control Switch 146 in accordance with<br>
an embodiment of the present invention. Packet Data Control Switch 146 includes a<br>
processor 202, such as one or more microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal<br>
processors (DSPs), combinations thereof or such other devices known to those having<br>
ordinary skill in the art. Packet Data Control Switch 146 further includes at least one<br>
memory device 204 associated with processor 202, such as random access memory<br>
(RAM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and/or read only memory (ROM) or<br>
equivalents thereof, that store data and programs, such as group call programs, that may<br>
be executed by the processor and that allow the Packet Data Control Switch to perform all<br>
functions necessary to operate in communication system 100.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a mobile station (MS), such as MSs 102-104, in<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Each MS of the multiple MSs<br>
102-104 includes a user interface 302 coupled to a processor 306, such as one or more<br>
microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors (DSPs), combinations thereof<br>
or such other devices known to those having ordinary skill in the art. Each MS further<br>
includes at least one memory device 308 associated with processor 306, such as random<br>
access memory (RAM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and/or road only<br>
memory (ROM) or equivalents thereof, that store data and programs that may be executed<br>
by the processor and that allow the MS to perform all functions necessary to operate in<br>
communication system 100.<br>
User interface 302 provides a user of the MS with the capability of interacting<br>
with the MS, including inputting instructions into the MS. In one embodiment of the<br>
present invention, user interface 302 includes a display screen 304 and a keypad that<br>
includes multiple keys, including a Push-to-Talk (PTT) key, that may be used by a user of<br>
the MS to input instructions into the MS. In another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, display screen 304 comprises a touch screen that is able to determine a position<br>
(i.e., an X-coordinate and a Y-coordinate) of a user's touch on the touch screen and<br>
convey the position data to processor 306. Based on the position data, processor 306 then<br>
translates the user's touch into an instruction. Preferably, display screen 304 may display<br>
a "keypad" screen that comprises multiple softkeys, such as softkeys corresponding to<br>
keys on a conventional cellular telephone keypad and further including a PTT softkey.<br>
The at least one memory device 308 maintains a mobile ID that is uniquely<br>
associated with the MS. The at least one memory device 308 further maintains a phone<br>
book comprising identifiers associated with MSs and/or talkgroups, such as mobile<br>
identifiers (mobile IDs) that are each uniquely associated with an MS and talkgroup<br>
identifiers (mobile IDs) that arc each uniquely associated with a talkgroup, that may be<br>
engaged in a PTT communication session. The mobile IDs may be preprogrammed into<br>
the at least one memory device 308 or may be added to the at least one memory device by<br>
a user of the MS. When the MS is a member of a talkgroup, such as talkgroup 105, the at<br>
least one memory device 308 may further store, in association with the talkgroup, a<br>
talkgroup ID and an associated list of mobile IDs, wherein each mobile ID in the list of<br>
mobile IDs corresponds to an MS that is a member of the talkgroup.<br>
Communication system 100 further maintains a 'wake up list' in association with<br>
each MS of the multiple MSs 102-104 included in the communication system. Each<br>
wake up list may be stored in the at least one memory device 308 of a corresponding MS<br>
or may be stored in infrastructure ISO, and in particular in the at least one memory device<br>
204 of Packet Data Control Switch 146. In one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
each wake up list comprises a list of mobile IDs associated with each MS that may be<br>
awakened by communication system 100 in response to receipt, by infrastructure 150, of<br>
a wake up request from the corresponding MS. In another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, each wake up list may comprise a list of talkgroup IDs associated with<br>
talkgroups whose members may be awakened by communication system 100 in response<br>
to receipt, by infrastructure 150, of a wake up request from the corresponding MS. In yet<br>
another embodiment of the present invention, each wake up list may comprise a list of a<br>
combination of mobile IDs and talkgroup IDs. When the wake up list is stored in<br>
infrastructure 150, the wake up list further comprises the mobile ID of the MS<br>
corresponding to the wake up list.<br>
Preferably, communication system 100 is a Code Division Multiple Access<br>
(CDMA) communication system, in which communication channels of a forward link or<br>
a reverse link, such as access channels, control channels, paging channels, and traffic<br>
channels, comprise orthogonal codes, such as Walsh Codes, that are transmitted in a same<br>
frequency bandwidth. However, those who are of ordinary skill in the art realize that<br>
communication system 100 may operate in accordance with any wireless<br>
telecommunication system, such as but not limited to a Global System for Mobile<br>
Communications (GSM) communication system, a Universal Mobile Telecommunication<br>
System (UMTS) communication system, a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)<br>
communication system, a Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) communication<br>
system, or an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDM) communication<br>
system.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 4, a logic flow diagram 400 is provided that illustrates an<br>
establishment of a Push-to-Talk (PIT) call in accordance with various embodiments of<br>
the present invention. A PTT call may be set up by any MS 102-104 in communication<br>
system 100 with any other MS or user, or any group of MSs or users, in the<br>
communication system. For example, any PTT-capable MS 102-104 in communication<br>
system 100 may set up a PTT call with any other PTT-capable MS in the communication<br>
system. By way of another example, any member of a talkgroup, such any one of MSs<br>
102-104 with respect to talkgroup 105, may originate a PIT call with any one or more of<br>
the other members of the talkgroup.<br>
Logic flow diagram 400 begins (402) when a first, originating MS, such as MS<br>
102, conveys (404) a 'wake up request* to infrastructure 150. The wake up request<br>
comprises a request to wake up at least a second MS, such as one or more of MSs 103<br>
and 104, in communication system 100. Originating MS 102 conveys the wake up<br>
request to infrastructure 150 prior to a user of MS 102 conveying, to the infrastructure, a<br>
request to set up a Push-To-Talk (PIT) communication session.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, originating MS 102 conveys the<br>
wake up request in response to receiving an indication from a user of the originating MS<br>
of the user's desire to initiate a PTT communication session. Those who are of ordinary<br>
skill in the art realize that a variety of actions of the user of MS 102 may be construed to<br>
be an indication of the user's desire to initiate a PTT communication session. For<br>
example, originating MS 102 may convey the wake up request in response to the user<br>
instructing MS 102 to open the phone book maintained in the at least one memory device<br>
308 of the originating MS 102. By way of another example, originating MS 102 may<br>
convey the wake up request in response to receiving a power up instruction from the user<br>
of the MS, such as when a user of the MS opens a clamshell-design MS or depresses a<br>
power up key in user interface 302.<br>
In response to receiving (406) the wake up request, infrastructure 150, and in<br>
particular control switch 146, wakes up (408) at least one MS 103, 104 included in the<br>
wake up list associated with originating MS to produce at least one awakened MS. When<br>
the 'wake up list' is maintained in the originating MS, the MS may convey the wake up<br>
list to infrastructure 150 as part of the 'wake up request.' When the 'wake up list' is<br>
maintained in infrastructure 150, the wake up request may include a mobile ID associated<br>
with originating MS 102 and may request that system 100 wake up all MSs associated<br>
with the 'wake up list' corresponding to the originating MS's mobile ID.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, step 408 may then comprise the<br>
following steps. In response to receiving the wake up request, control switch 146<br>
determines a location of each MS 103, 104 associated with the wake up list by reference<br>
to Location Database 142. Control switch 146 then instructs each BSS 120,130 servicing<br>
an MS associated with the 'wake up list' to broadcast a paging message to the 'wake up<br>
list' MS(s) serviced by the BSS. In response to receiving the instruction from control<br>
switch 146, each BSS 120,130 serving an MS associated with the wake up list broadcasts<br>
a paging message via a paging channel in a respective air interface 107,108.<br>
Each paging message broadcast by a BSS 120, 130 identifies each MS that is<br>
associated with the wake up list and serviced by the BSS. In one embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the paging message may include the mobile IDs associated with each<br>
such MS. In another embodiment of the present invention, when the wake up list<br>
comprises all members of a talkgroup, such as talkgroup 105, the paging message may<br>
comprise a talkgroup ID associated with the talkgroup in addition to, or instead of, the<br>
mobile IDs. In response to receiving the paging message, each MS 103, 104 determines<br>
that it is an intended recipient of the paging message, wakes up, and conveys a paging<br>
response back to control switch 146 indicating that the MS is awake.<br>
If the user has not already so instructed originating MS 102, the user may then<br>
instruct originating MS 102 to open the phone book comprising MSs and/or talkgroups<br>
that may be engaged in a FIT communication session. The instruction may be input into<br>
originating MS 102 concurrent with infrastructure 150 waking up the MSs 103, 104<br>
associated with the wake up list. In response to receiving the instruction from the user,<br>
originating MS 102 retrieves the phone book from the one or more memory devices 308<br>
of the MS and displays the phone book on display screen 304 of user interface 302. The<br>
user of originating MS 102 may then select one or more MSs and/or talkgroups from the<br>
displayed phone book and instructs MS 102, by depressing an appropriate key or touching<br>
an appropriate softkey in user interface 302 of the MS, to set up a PTT communication<br>
session with the selected one or more MSs and/or talkgroups. In response to receiving<br>
the instruction, originating MS 102 conveys (410) a request, such as a call origination<br>
message, to infrastructure 150 to set up a PTT communication session with the selected<br>
one or more MSs and/or talkgroups.<br>
In response to receiving (412) the request to set up the PTT communication<br>
session, communication system 100 proceeds to set up (414) the requested PTT<br>
communication session. The procedure for setting up a PTT communication session is<br>
well-known in the art and will not be described in detail here, except that when the set up<br>
procedure engaged in by communication system 100 includes an MS 103, 104 that is<br>
associated with the wake up list, the communication system need not engage in a process<br>
of waking up the called MS as the called MS has already been awakened, or is in the<br>
process of being awakened, by infrastructure 150 in response to the receipt by the<br>
infrastructure of the wake up request As a result, communication system 100 provides<br>
for an expedited set up of the PTT communication session.<br>
As part of the call setup procedure, communication system 100 establishes a<br>
traffic channel in air interface 106 between originating MS 102 and infrastructure 150 for<br>
conveyance of voice traffic. Further, as part of the call setup procedure, infrastructure<br>
150 further establishes a traffic channel between infrastructure 150 and each of the at<br>
least one awakened and called MS 103, 104 in a respective air interface 107, 108<br>
associated with the MS. In response to the establishment of the traffic channels in the air<br>
interface 106 corresponding to MS 102 and an air interface 107, 108 corresponding to the<br>
at least one called MS 103, 104, the user of originating MS 102 is then notified (416) that<br>
he or she may commence speaking. Logic flow diagram 400 then ends (418).<br>
Preferably, originating MS notifies the user that he or she may commence<br>
speaking by playing a Talk Permit Tone (TPT) to the user of originating MS 102. In one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, upon establishing a traffic channel to at least one<br>
called MS 103, 104, infrastructure 150, in particular control switch 146, conveys the TPT<br>
to originating MS 102 and the originating MS plays the TPT to the user of the MS. In<br>
another embodiment of the present invention, upon establishing a traffic channel to at<br>
least one called MS 103, 104, infrastructure 150, in particular control switch 146, conveys<br>
an instruction to play a TPT to the originating MS. In response to receiving the<br>
instruction, originating MS 102 retrieves a digitally stored TPT from the at least one<br>
memory device 308 of the MS and converts the TPT to an audio signal that is then played<br>
to the user of the MS. Upon receiving the TPT, the user of originating MS may then<br>
begin speaking by first depressing a PTT key, or touching a PTT softkey, of the MS's<br>
user interface 302.<br>
¦ By providing a 'wake up list' of MSs, such as MSs 103 and 104, that may be<br>
awakened by communication system 100 prior to an originating MS requesting to set up<br>
the PTT communication session, an amount of time incurred in setting up a PTT<br>
communication session and the delay before a user of the originating MS may begin to<br>
speak is reduced. As the MSs on the 'wake up list' are awakened prior to an originating<br>
MS requesting to set up the PTT communication session, communication system 100<br>
need not engage in a process of waking up such called MSs in response to the receipt by<br>
infrastructure 150 of the request to set up the PTT communication session. As a result,<br>
communication system 100 provides for an expedited set up of the PTT communication<br>
session. Since the setup delay and the time that the user may first begin speaking are<br>
important marketing features of a PTT communication system, any reduction of setup<br>
delay and time until a user may begin speaking increases the marketability of PTT<br>
services offered by an operator of a communication system, such as communication<br>
system 100.<br>
To further reduce the delay between a time that a user of an originating MS, such<br>
as MS 102, requests to set up a PTT communication session and the time that the user<br>
may then begin to speak, communication stem 100 may further permit the user to begin<br>
speaking prior to completion of the setup of the PTT communication session, or call.<br>
Referring now to FIGs. 5A and 5B, a logic flow diagram 500 is provided that illustrates<br>
an establishment of a Push-to-Talk (FIT) communication session in accordance with<br>
another embodiment of the present invention. Logic flow diagram 500 begins (502)<br>
when user of a first, originating MS, such as MS 102, depresses a PTT key or touches a<br>
PTT softkey of user interface 302 of the MS. In response to the user depressing or<br>
touching the PTT key or softkey, MS 102 (504) conveys a request to the infrastructure to<br>
set up a PTT communication session and further reserves a floor of the communication<br>
session being set up until such a reservation is terminated, for example, when the user of<br>
MS 102 determines to relinquish the floor by releasing the PTT key or when<br>
infrastructure 100 terminates the user's reservation. Unless otherwise specified herein,<br>
each function performed by any one of MSs 102-104 is performed by a respective<br>
processor 306 of the MS.<br>
In response to receiving the request, communication system 100 proceeds to set<br>
up the requested PTT communication session by allocating traffic channels in air<br>
interface in air interface 106 between originating MS 102 and infrastructure 150 for<br>
conveyance of voice traffic. Further, as part of the call setup procedure, infrastructure<br>
150 pages each called MS, such as MS 103, that is, a 'cailee.' Upon receiving a page<br>
response from a paged MS, that is, MS 103, infrastructure 150 further establishes a traffic<br>
channel between the infrastructure and the responding MS 103 in a corresponding air<br>
interface 107. When the setup of a PTT communication session with the called MS is<br>
complete, infrastructure 150 so informs originating MS 102, preferably by conveying a<br>
setup complete message to the MS.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, communication system 100 may<br>
permit the user of originating MS to begin speaking while the PTT call is being setup. In<br>
such an embodiment, while the call setup is in progress (506), MS 102 notifies (508) the<br>
user that that he or she may commence speaking. For example, MS 102 may notify the<br>
user that a call setup is in progress or MS 102 may merely notify the user that the user<br>
may begin talking, for example by playing a conventional notification such as a Talk<br>
Permit Tone (TPT). Preferably, the notification may be stored in the at least one memory<br>
device 308 of MS 102 and is retrieved from the at least one memory device by the MS<br>
and played to the user.<br>
Upon receiving the notification that he or she may begin talking, the user of<br>
originating MS 102 may then begin (510) speaking and may continue speaking until the<br>
user's reservation of the floor of the communication session is terminated (514), for<br>
example, by the user releasing the PTT key or softkey or by infrastructure 150 terminating<br>
the user's reservation of the floor. When the user of MS 102 begins speaking prior to<br>
completion of the setup of the communication session, MS 102 stores (512) the user's<br>
speech in a speech buffer 310 included in the at least one memory device 308 of the MS.<br>
When, at step 510, the user of MS 102 began speaking prior to completion of call<br>
setup and, at step 514, the user's reservation of the floor of the communication session is;<br>
tenninated, MS 102 then determines (516) whether the call setup is complete. When, at<br>
step 516, MS 102 determines that the setup is complete, the MS notifies (518) the user of<br>
the MS that the call setup is complete, preferably by displaying an audio and/or visual<br>
cue, via user interface 302 of the MS, corresponding to a call setup complete message that<br>
is stored in the at least one memory device 308 of tihe MS. hifrastructure 150 further<br>
determines (520) whether the user of the called MS, that is, MS 103? is present and so<br>
informs MS 102. In one embodiment of the present invention, infrastructure 150 may<br>
determine whether the user of the called MS is present based on whether the called MS is<br>
registered in system 100, for example, by reference to Location Database 142 or by<br>
reference to a Presence Server (not shown) located in infrastructure 150 and coupled to IP<br>
network 140. In another embodiment of the present invention, infrastructure 150. may-<br>
determine whether the user of called MS 103 is present based on whether1 the user of the<br>
called MS has answered the call.<br>
When the PTT communication session is set up and the user of the called MS is<br>
present, infrastructure 150 informs MS 102, and MS 102 notifies (522) the user of MS<br>
102 of the presence of the called party, preferably by displaying an audio and/or visual<br>
cue that is stored in the in the at least one memory device 308 of MS 102 and displayed<br>
via user interface 302 of the MS. The speech stored in buffer 310 of MS 102 is then<br>
conveyed (524) by MS 102 to MS 103 and the communication session proceeds as a<br>
conventional PTT communication session, wherein the user of MS 102 may continue<br>
speaking (526) until MS 102's reservation of the floor of the communication session is<br>
terminated. Logic flow 500 .then ends (554).<br>
When, at step 516, MS 102 determines that the call setup is complete and, at step<br>
520, infrastructure 150 determines that the user of the called MS, that is, MS 103, is not<br>
present, MS 102 notifies (528) the user of MS 102 that the called party is not present and<br>
prompts the user of MS 102 to leave a voice message for the called MS, such as one or<br>
more of a voice message comprising the speech stored in buffer 310 or a voice message<br>
comprising new speech. Preferably, the notification and prompt are stored in the at least<br>
one memory device 308 of MS 102 and displayed by MS 102 via user interface 302 of the<br>
MS.<br>
In response to the notification and prompt, the user may terminate (530) the call or<br>
may convey (532) any speech stored in buffer 310 of MS 102 or new speech as a voice<br>
message by selecting an appropriate icon, key, or softkey in user interface 302 of the MS.<br>
In response to receiving an instruction to convey the stored speech to the called MS as a<br>
voice mail message, originating MS 102 conveys the speech stored in buffer 310of MS<br>
102 to a memory location in infrastructure 150 at is associated with MS 103, where the<br>
stored speech is recorded as a voice message for MS 103. In response to receiving an.<br>
instruction to convey a new speech message to the called MS as a voice mail message, ¦:<br>
originating MS 102 prompts the user of the originating MS for a hew speech message via<br>
an audio and/or visual prompt that is stored in the at least one memory device 308 of<br>
originating MS 102 and is displayed on display screen 304 of user interface 302 of the<br>
MS. In response to the prompt, the user of originating MS 102 inputs into the MS, and<br>
the originating MS receives from the user, a new speech message. Originating MS 102<br>
then conveys the new speech message to the memory location in infrastructure 150 at is<br>
associated with MS 103, where the stored speech is recorded as a voice message for MS<br>
103. Logic flow 500 then ends (554).<br>
When, at step 516, MS 102 determines that the call setup is not complete, and<br>
infrastructure 105 determines (534) that a predetermined time period has not yet expired<br>
and/or a predetermined number of unsuccessful attempts to set up the call have not yet<br>
occurred, such as a predetermined number of unsuccessful attempts to page called MS<br>
103 or a predetermined number of unsuccessful attempts to establish traffic channels to<br>
called MS 103, communication system 100, and in particular originating MS 102, notifies<br>
(536) the user of MS 102 that a call setup is in progress. Communication system 100,<br>
preferably originating MS 102 or control switch 146 via MS 102, also inquires (538) of<br>
the user of MS 102, via a text message or an icon displayed on display screen 304 of user<br>
interface 302 of MS 102 and that is stored in the at least one memory device 308 of the<br>
MS, as to whether to terminate and/or continue efforts to set up the call.<br>
In response to the inquiry, originating MS 102 may receive (540), from the user of<br>
the MS, an instruction to terminate efforts to set up the call or to continue efforts to set up<br>
the call, or may receive no response, which may be interpreted as an instruction to<br>
continue to set up the call. When the user does not elect, at step 540, to terminate efforts<br>
to set up the call, that is, when the user elects to continue with efforts to set up the call or<br>
fails to elect to terminate efforts to set up the call, logic flow diagram 500 proceeds to<br>
step 516. When the user elects, at step 540, to terminate efforts to set up the call, MS 102<br>
prompts (542) the user of MS 102 to leave a voice message, such as one of more of a<br>
voice message comprising the speech stored in buffer 310 of MS 102 or a voice message<br>
comprising new speech, for the called party. Preferably the prompt is stored in the at<br>
least one memory device 308 of MS 102 and displayed by MS 102 via user interface 302<br>
of the MS.<br>
Upon determining, at step 516, that the call setup is not complete, and after, at<br>
step 534, expiration of the predetermined time period and/or after occurrence of the<br>
predetermined number of unsuccessful attempts to set up the call, infrastructure 150 may<br>
terminate (546) the efforts to establish the call, for example, may cease paging called MS<br>
103 or may cease attempting to establish traffic channels to the MS. In response to<br>
tenninating efforts to establish the call, infrastructure 150 informs MS 102 of a<br>
connection failure. MS 102, in turn, notifies (548) the user of the MS of the connection<br>
failure and prompts (550) the user to leave a voice message for the called party, such as a<br>
voice message comprising the speech stored in buffer 310 or a voice message comprising<br>
new speech. Preferably the notification and prompt are stored in the at least one memory<br>
device 308 of MS 102 and displayed by the MS via user interface 302 of the MS.<br>
In response to the prompt at step 542 or step 550, the user of MS 102 may convey<br>
(544, 552) the speech stored in buffer 310 of MS 102 or new speech as a voice message<br>
by selecting an appropriate icon, key, or softkey in user interface 302 of the MS. In<br>
response to receiving an instruction to convey the stored speech to the called MS, that is,<br>
MS 103, as a voice mail message, originating MS 102 conveys the speech stored in buffer<br>
'310 of MS 102 to a memory location in infrastructure 150 at is associated with MS 103,<br>
where the stored speech is recorded as a voice message for MS 103. In response to<br>
receiving an instruction to convey a new speech message to the called MS as a voice mail<br>
message, originating MS 102 prompts the user of the originating MS for a new speech<br>
message via an audio and/or visual prompt that is stored in the at least one memory<br>
device 308 of originating MS 102 and is displayed on display screen 304 of user interface<br>
302 of the MS. In response to the prompt for a new speech message, the user of<br>
i<br>
originating MS 102 inputs into the MS, and MS 102 receives from the user, a new speech<br>
message. Originating MS 102 then conveys the new speech message to the memory<br>
location in rnfrastructure 150 that is associated with MS 103, where the stored speech is<br>
recorded as a voice message for MS 103. Logic flow 500 then ends (554).<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, communication system 100<br>
the user of originating MS might not begin speaking until the PTT call is setup. In such<br>
an embodiment, when, at step 506, the call is set up, infrastructure 150 determines (520)<br>
whether the user-of the called MS, such as MS 103, is present and so informs MS 102.<br>
When the PTT communication session is set up and the user of the'called MS is present,<br>
logic flow diagram 500 then proceeds to step 522 as is described above. When the PTT<br>
communication session is set up and the user of the called MS is not present, logic flow<br>
diagram 500 then proceeds to step 528 as is described above.<br>
By pennitting the user of originating. MS 102 to begin speaking prior to<br>
completion of the setup of the call, a delay between a time that the user of the originating<br>
MS determines to initiate a PTT phone call and the time that the user may then begin to<br>
speak is reduced. Since the user may be permitted to begin speaking prior to completion<br>
of the setup of the call, the speech input by the user into originating MS 102 is stored in a<br>
buffer 310 of the MS. When the call is setup and the user of the called MS, such as MS<br>
103, is present, the stored speech is then conveyed to the called MS. Since speech<br>
compression algorithms compress a length of speech received by an originating mobile<br>
station such (hat it consumes, and is transmitted in, a shorter interval than the spoken<br>
interval, which speech is then decompressed by a receiving mobile station to fill the<br>
original spoken interval, the stored speech may be conveyed to called MS 103,<br>
decompressed, and played out with minimal disruption to the subsequent conversation. If<br>
attempts to set up the call are unsuccessful and the call is not set up or the call is set up<br>
but the user of called MS 103 is not present or determines to not accept the call, the<br>
stored speech may then be conveyed to the called MS as a voice message.<br>
The stored speech, or new speech, may also be used as an alert that is played to a<br>
user of a called MS. That is, typically, when a called MS, such as MS 103 or MS 104, is<br>
woken up by infrastructure 150 and a traffic channel is established to the called MS as<br>
part of a PTT communication session, a "beep" or a "chirp" is played by the called MS to<br>
a user of the called MS. However, in another embodiment of the present invention, when<br>
a called MS 103, 104 is woken up by infrastructure 150 and a' traffic channel is.<br>
established to the called MS, an announcement comprising a spoken message from<br>
originating MS 102 may be conveyed to a user of the called MS. By providing an<br>
announcement comprising a spoken message from the originating MS to a user of the<br>
called MS, can choose to ignore the call, queue the call without listening to the audio<br>
message, queue the call after listening to the audio message, or answer the call.<br>
FIG. 6 is a logic flow diagram 600 of a method executed by communication<br>
system 100 in conveying a voice alert to a called MS in accordance with another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Similar to logic flow diagram 500, logic flow<br>
diagram 600 begins when user of a first, originating MS, such as MS 102, depresses a<br>
PTT key or touches a PTT softkey of user interface 302 of the MS. In response to the<br>
user depressing or touching the PTT key or softkey, MS 102 (604) conveys a request to<br>
the infrastructure to set up a PTT session and further reserves a floor of the<br>
communication session being set up until the floor reservation is terminated, for example,<br>
when the user of MS 102 determines to relinquish the floor by releasing the PTT key or<br>
when infrastructure 100 tenninates the user's reservation.<br>
In response to receiving the request, communication system 100 proceeds to set<br>
up the requested PTT communication session by allocating traffic channels in air<br>
interface in air interface 106 between originating MS 102 and infrastructure 150 for<br>
conveyance of voice traffic. Further, as part of the call setup procedure, infrastructure<br>
150 pages each called MS, such as MS 103, that is, a 'callee,' and upon receiving a page<br>
response from the MS, further establishes a traffic channel between infrastructure 150 and<br>
the responding MS 103 in a corresponding air interface 107. When the setup of a PTT<br>
communication session with the called MS is complete, infrastructure 150 so informs<br>
originating MS 102, preferably by conveying a setup complete message to the MS.<br>
Similar to logic flow diagram 500, in one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
communication system 100 may permit the user of originating MS to begin speaking<br>
while the PTT call is being setup. In such an embodiment, while the call setup is in<br>
progress (606), MS 102 notifies (608) the user that that he or she may commence<br>
speaking. ¦ Upon receiving the notification that he or she may begin talking, the user of<br>
originating MS may then begin (610) speaking and may continue speaking until the user's<br>
reservation of the floor of the communication session is terminated (614), for example, by<br>
the user releasing the PTT key or softkey or by infrastructure 150 terminating the user's<br>
reservation of the floor. When the user of MS 102 begins speaking prior to completion of<br>
the setup of the communication session, MS 102 stores (612) the user's speech in a<br>
speech buffer 310 included in the at least one memory device 308 of the MS.<br>
When, at step 610, the user of MS 102 began speaking prior to completion of call<br>
setup and, at step 614, the user's reservation of the floor of the communication session is<br>
terminated, MS 102 then determines (616) whether the call setup is complete. When, at<br>
step 616, MS 102 determines that the setup is complete, the MS notifies (618) the user of<br>
the MS that the call setup is complete, preferably by displaying an audio and/or visual<br>
cue, via user interface 302 of the MS, corresponding to a call setup complete message that<br>
is stored in the at least one memory device 308 of the MS. Infrastructure 150 further<br>
determines (620) whether the user of the called MS, such as MS 103, is present and so<br>
informs MS 102.<br>
When, at step 616, infrastructure 150 determines that the PTT communication<br>
session is set up and further determines, at step 620, mat the user of called MS 103 is<br>
present, MS 102 conveys (622) the speech stored in buffer 310 to MS 103, and called MS<br>
103 plays (624) the received speech to the user of MS 103 as an announcement, that is, as<br>
an alert In response to receiving the alert, the user of MS 103 may choose to ignore the<br>
call, queue the call without listening to the audio message, queue the call after listening to<br>
the audio message, or answer the call. MS 103 then conveys (626) the user's response to<br>
the alert to originating MS 102 via infrastructure 150 and logic flow 600 ends (660).<br>
When the PTT communication session is set up and the user of the called MS is not<br>
present, MS 102 notifies (628) the user of the MS that the callee is not present and that<br>
the alert has been successfully sent, and logic flow 600 ends (660).<br>
When, at step 616, infrastructure 150 determines that the PTT communication<br>
session is not set up, MS 102 notifies (630) the user of MS 102 that a call setup is in<br>
progress. When attempts to complete the call are terminated (632) prior to the call being<br>
setup, for example, upon expiration of a predetermined time period or after a<br>
predetermined number of unsuccessful setup attempts, the user of originating MS 102 is<br>
notified (634) that an alert has been successfully sent to called MS 103 and logic flow<br>
600 ends (660). When, at step 632, the call is setup prior to such termination, the speech<br>
stored in buffer 310 is conveyed (636) to called MS 103, and called MS 103 plays (638)<br>
the received speech to the user of MS 103 as an announcement, that is, an alert Again, in<br>
response to receiving the alert, the user of MS 103 may choose to ignore the call, queue<br>
the call without listening to the audio message, queue the call after listening to the audio<br>
message, or answer the call. MS 103 then conveys (640) the user's response to the alert<br>
to originating MS 102 via infrastructure 150 and logic flow 600 the ends (660).<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the user of originating MS 102<br>
might not begin speaking until the call is set up. In such an embodiment, when the call is<br>
set up (606), infrastructure 150 determines (642) whether the user of the called MS, such<br>
as MS 103, is present and so informs MS 102. When the PTT communication session is<br>
set up and the user of the called MS is not present, the user of originating MS 102 is<br>
notified (644) that the user of called MS 103 is not present and that an alert has been<br>
successfully sent to the called MS. Logic flow 600 then ends (660).<br>
When, at step 606, the PTT communication session is set up and the user of the<br>
called MS is present, MS 102 notifies (646, 648) the user of MS 102 that the user of<br>
called MS 103 is present and that he or she may commence speaking. Upon receiving the<br>
notification that he or she may begin talking, the user of originating MS 102 may then<br>
begin (650) speaking. MS 102 conveys (652) the speech input into MS 102 by the user of<br>
the MS to called MS 103, and called MS 103 plays (654) the received speech to the user<br>
of MS 103 as an announcement, that is, an alert. Again, in response to receiving the alert,<br>
the user of MS 103 may choose to ignore the call, queue the call without listening to the<br>
audio message, queue the call after listening to the audio message, or answer the call. MS<br>
103 then conveys (656) the user's response to the alert to originating MS 102 via<br>
infrastructure 150 and logic flow 600 ends (660).<br>
By using the received speech as an announcement of a call instead of the "beep"<br>
or "chirp" is typically used to announce a call to a user of the called MS, the user of the<br>
called MS is provided information that allows the user to determine whether to ignore the<br>
call, queue the call without listening to the audio message, queue the call after listening to<br>
the audio message, or answer the call. Thus a user of the called MS is provided greater<br>
information on which to make a decision as to whether to accept a call and further<br>
whether to incur the costs associated with engaging in a wireless communication via a<br>
mobile station, which costs may be billed based on an amount of airtime consumed by the<br>
user.<br>
