CROSS-REFFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/909,116 filed on March 30, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>

[0004]	A typical multiple speed automatic transmission uses a<br>
combination of friction clutches, planetary gear arrangements and fixed<br>
interconnections to achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical<br>
arrangement of the planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging,<br>
cost and desired speed ratios.<br>

Attorney Docket No. P001128-PTT-DLT<br>
[0005]	While current automatic transmissions achieve their intended<br>
purpose, the need for new and improved transmission configurations which<br>
exhibit improved performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency,<br>
responsiveness and smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced<br>
size and weight, is essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an<br>
improved, cost-effective, compact multiple speed automatic transmission.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0024] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0025] At the outset, it should be appreciated that in the particular<br>
example provided, the eight speed automatic transmission of the present<br>
invention has an arrangement of permanent mechanical connections between<br>
the elements of the four planetary gear sets. A first component or element of a<br>
first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to first component or element of a<br>
second planetary gear set. A third component or element of a first planetary gear<br>
set is permanently coupled to third component or element of a third planetary<br>
gear set. A second component or element of the second planetary gear set is<br>
permanently coupled to a second component or element of the third planetary<br>
gear set. A second component or element of a third planetary gear set is<br>
permanently coupled to a second component or element of a fourth planetary<br>
gear set.<br>
[0026] Referring now to FIG. 1, a first embodiment of an eight speed<br>
automatic transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever<br>
diagram is a schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device<br>
7<br><br>
Attorney Docket No, P001128-PTT-DLT<br>
such as an automatic transmission. Each individual lever represents a planetary<br>
gear set wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary gear<br>
set are each represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three<br>
nodes: one for the sun gear, one for the planet gear carrier, and one for the ring<br>
gear. The relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to<br>
represent the ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gear set. These lever ratios, in<br>
turn, are used to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to achieve an<br>
appropriate ratio and ratio progression. Mechanical couplings or<br>
interconnections between the nodes of the various planetary gear sets are<br>
illustrated by thin, horizontal lines and torque transmitting devices such as<br>
clutches and brakes are presented as interleaved fingers. If the device is a<br>
brake, one set of the fingers is grounded. Further explanation of the format,<br>
purpose, and use of lever diagrams can be found in SAE paper 810102, "The<br>
Lever Analogy: A New Tool in Transmission Analysis"<br>
by Benford and Leising, which is hereby fully incorporated by reference.<br>
[0027] The automatic transmission 10 includes an input shaft or<br>
member 12, an output shaft or member 22, a first planetary gear set 14 having<br>
three nodes: a first node 14A, a second node 14B and a third node 14C, a<br>
second planetary gear set 16 having three nodes: a first node 16A, a second<br>
node 16B and a third node 16C, a third planetary gear set 18 having three nodes:<br>
a first node 18A, a second node 18B and a third node 18C, and a fourth<br>
planetary gear set 20 having three nodes: a first node 20A, a second node 20B<br>
and a third node 20C. The first node 14A of the first planetary gear set 14 is<br>
8<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001128-PTT-DLT<br>
coupled to the first node 16A of the second planetary gear set 16. The third node<br>
14C of the first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to the third node 18C of the third<br>

[0028] The input shaft or member 12 is coupled to the third node 16C<br>
of the second planetary gear set 16. The output shaft or member 22 is coupled<br>
to the third node 20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A first clutch 26<br>
selectively connects the third node 16C of the second planetary gear set 16 to<br>
the third node 14C of the first planetary gear set 14. A second clutch 28<br>
selectively connects the first node 14A of the first planetary gear set 14 to the<br>
third node 14C of the first planetary gear set 14 and a third clutch 30 selectively<br>
connects the second node 148 of the first planetary gear set 14 to the third node<br>
20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A first brake 32 selectively connects the<br>
first node 18A of the third planetary gear set 18 to ground and a second brake 34<br>
selectively connects the first node 20A of the fourth planetary gear set 20 to<br>
ground.<br>

layout of the first embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 according to<br>
the present invention. In FIG. 2, the numbering from the lever diagram of FIG. 1<br>
is carried over. The clutches, brakes and couplings are correspondingly<br>
presented whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now appear as<br>
components of planetary gear sets such a sun gears, ring gears, planet gears<br>

Attorney Docket No. P001128-PTT-DLT<br>
and planet gear carriers. More specifically, the first planetary gear set 14<br>
includes a first sun gear 14A, a first ring gear 14C, and a first planet carrier 14B<br>
that includes a plurality of planet gears 14D rotatably disposed thereon. The<br>
second planetary gear set 16 includes a second sun gear 16A, a second ring<br>
gear 16B, and a second planet carrier 16C that includes a plurality of planet<br>
gears 16D rotatably disposed thereon. The third planetary gear set 18 includes<br>
a third sun gear 18C, a third ring gear ISA, and a third planet carrier IBB that<br>

planetary gear set 20 includes a fourth sun gear 20A, a fourth ring gear 20B, and<br>
a fourth planet carrier 20C that includes a plurality of planet gears 20D rotatably<br>
disposed thereon.<br>
[0030] The input shaft or member 12 is coupled to and directly drives<br>
the second planet carrier 16C. A first shaft or interconnecting member 42<br>
couples the second ring gear 16B to the third planet carrier 18B. A second shaft<br>
or interconnecting member 44 couples the second sun gear 16A to the first sun<br>
gear 14A. A third shaft or interconnecting member 46 interconnects the first ring<br>
gear 14C with the third sun gear 18C. A fourth shaft or interconnecting member<br>
48 couples the third planet carrier 18B to the fourth ring gear 20B. The first<br>
clutch 26 selectively couples the second planet carrier 16C to the third<br>
interconnecting member 46. The second clutch 28 selectively couples the first<br>
ring gear 14C to the first sun gear 14A and the third clutch 30 selectively couples<br>
the first planet carrier 14B to the output shaft or member 22. A fifth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 50 couples the first brake 32 to the third ring gear 18A.<br>
10<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001128-PTT-DLT<br>
The first brake 32 selectively couples the third ring gear 18A to ground. A sixth<br>
shaft or interconnecting member 52 couples the fourth sun gear 20A to the<br>
second brake 34. The second brake 34 selectively couples the fourth sun gear<br>
20A to ground. The output shaft or member 22 is coupled to and driven by the<br>
fourth planet carrier 20C.<br>
[0031] Referring now to FIG.s 2 and 3, the operation of the first<br>
embodiment of the eight speed automatic transmission 10 will be described. It<br>
will be appreciated that the automatic transmission 10 is capable of transmitting<br>
torque from the input shaft or member 12 to the output shaft or member 22 in<br>
eight forward speed or torque ratios and one reverse speed or torque ratio.<br>
Each fon/vard and reverse speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of<br>
one or more of the clutches or brakes as will be explained below. FIG. 3 is a<br>
truth table presenting the various combinations of clutches and brakes that are<br>
activated or engaged to achieve the various gear states. Actual numerical gear<br>
ratios of the various gear states are also presented although it should be<br>
appreciated that these numerical values are exemplary only and that they may<br>
be adjusted over significant ranges to accommodate various applications and<br>
operational criteria of the automatic transmission 10.<br>
[0032] To establish ratios, three clutching elements are engaged for<br>
each gear state. The engaged clutches are represented by an "X" in each<br>
respective row. For example, to establish reverse gear, the first brake 32, the<br>
second brake 34, and the third clutch 30 are engaged or activated. The first<br>
brake 32 grounds the third ring gear 18A and the second brake 34 grounds the<br>
11<br><br>

fourth sun gear 20A. The third clutch 30 connects the first planet carrier 14B to<br>
the fourth planet carrier 20C. Likewise, the eight fonA/ard ratios are achieved<br>
through different combinations of clutch engagement as per Figure 3.<br>
[0033] Turning now to FIG. 4, a lever diagram for a second<br>
embodiment of an eight speed automatic transmission 100 is illustrated. The<br>
automatic transmission 100 includes an input shaft or member 112, a first<br>
planetary gear set 114 having three nodes: a first node 114A, a second node<br>

[0036] The input shaft or member 112 is coupled to and directly drives<br>
the first planet carrier 114B. A first shaft or interconnecting member 142 couples<br>
the second planet carrier gear 116B to the third planet carrier 118B. A second<br>
shaft or interconnecting member 144 couples the second sun gear 116A to the<br>
first sun gear 114A. A third shaft or interconnecting member 146 couples the first<br>
ring gear 114C to the third sun gear 118C. A fourth shaft or interconnecting<br>
member 148 couples the third planet carrier 1188 to the fourth ring gear 120B. A<br>
fifth shaft or interconnecting member 149 couples the fourth sun gear 120A to the<br>
first clutch 126 and to the second clutch 128. The first clutch 126 selectively<br>
couples the first planet carrier 114B to the fourth sun gear 120A and the second<br>
clutch 128 selectively couples the third interconnecting member 146 and the third<br>
sun gear 118C to the fourth sun gear 120A. A sixth shaft or interconnecting<br>
member 150 couples the first brake 132 to the second ring gear 116C. The first<br>
brake 132 selectively couples the second ring gear 116C to ground. A seventh<br>
shaft or interconnecting member 152 couples the second sun gear 116A to the<br>
second brake 134. The second brake 134 selectively couples the second sun<br>
gear 116A to ground. The output shaft or member 122 is coupled to and driven<br>
by the fourth planet carrier 120C and is coupled to the third clutch 130. The third<br>
clutch 130 selectively couples the third ring gear 118A to the output shaft or<br>
member 122.<br>
[0037] Referring now to FIGS. 5 and 6, the operation of the second<br>
embodiment of the eight speed automatic transmission 100 will be described. It<br>
will be appreciated that the automatic transmission 100 is capable of transmitting<br>
14<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001128-PTT-DLT<br>
torque from the input shaft or member 112 to the output shaft or member 122 in<br>
eight fonA/ard speed or torque ratios and one reverse speed or torque ratio.<br>
Each forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of<br>
one or more of the clutches or brakes as will be explained below. FIG. 6 is a<br>
truth table presenting the various combinations of clutches and brakes that are<br>
activated or engaged to achieve the various gear states. Actual numerical gear<br>
ratios of the various gear states are also presented although it should be<br>
appreciated that these numerical values are exemplary only and that they may<br>
be adjusted over significant ranges to accommodate various applications and<br>
operational criteria of the automatic transmission 100.<br>
[0038] To establish ratios, three clutching elements are engaged for<br>
each gear state. The engaged clutches or brakes are represented by an "X" in<br>
each respective row. For example, to establish reverse gear, the first brake 132,<br>
the second brake 134, and the third clutch 130 are engaged or activated. The<br>
first brake 132 grounds the second ring gear 116C and the second brake 134<br>
grounds the second sun gear 116A and the first sun gear 114A the third clutch<br>
130 connects the third ring gear 118A to the output shaft or member 122.<br>
Likewise, the eight fonA/ard ratios are achieved through different combinations of<br>
clutch engagement as per Figure 6.<br>
[0039] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the eight speed automatic transmission 100 assumes, first of<br>
all, that all clutches and brakes not specifically referenced in a given gear state<br>
are inactive or disengaged and, second of all, that during gear shifts, i.e., *<br>
15<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001128-PTT-DLT<br>
changes of gear state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or brake<br>
engaged or activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
[0040] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
