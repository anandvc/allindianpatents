				<td>RECOMBINANT ALPHA-FETOPROTEIN, METHOD AND MEANS FOR<br>
PREPARATION THEREOF, COMPOSITIONS ON THE BASE THEREOF AND<br>
USE THEREOF<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to the microbiological and medical industry, genetic<br>
engineering, biotechnology. A recombinant alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) according to the<br>
instant invention, retaining the activity of a human AFP, obtained from serum, is<br>
intended for use in oncology, immunotherapy, cosmetology.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is the main component of embryonic blood serum of<br>
mammals, which is synthesized by embryonal liver and yolk sac during perinatal<br>
development. Immediately after birth, the level of AFP in the serum sharply decreases<br>
and its expression became undetectable in healthy adult individuals (Deutsch H.F.,<br>
1991, Adv. Canc. Res. 56, 253 - 312). The synthesis of AFP is renewed upon malignant<br>
development of liver tumors and germinogenic teratoblastomas and could be detectable<br>
to a lesser degree in the case of chemical and mechanical damage to the liver,<br>
accompanied by regeneration, for example, during acute viral hepatitis or cirrhosis<br>
(Mizejewsky G.J., 2002, Expert Rev. Anticancer. Ther. 2: 89-115).<br>
Human AFP is a glycoprotein consisting of 590 amino acids and comprising<br>
about 4% of a carbohydrate component (Morinaga T., et al., 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sci., U.S.A., 80, 4604-4608; Pucci P. et al., 1991, Biochemistry 30, 5061-5066). One of<br>
the main properties of AFP is the noncovalent sorption of different low-molecular<br>
chemical substances, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, steroidal hormones, metals,<br>
retinoids, hydrophobic antibiotics and others (Aussel S. &amp; Masseyeff R., 1994,<br>
Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 119: 1122-1127; Deutsch H.F., 1994, J. Tumor<br>
Marker Oncol., 9: 11-14). In early stages of embryonic development, AFP replaces<br>
albumin as a transport vehicle for fatty acids and other low-molecular substances<br>
(Deutsch H.F., 1991, Adv. Canc. Res. 56, 253-312).<br>
AFP molecule consists of three globular structural domains bounded by 15<br>
interchain disulfide bonds, which significantly increases the complexity of the process<br>
of assembly of a tertiary structure of a protein (Morinaga T., et al., 1983, Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 80, 4604-4608; Pucci P., et al., 1991, Biochemistry 30, 5061-5066).<br>
Furthermore, an important structural element of an AFP molecule is the carbohydrate<br>
component, which provides correct reception and functioning of the molecule (Deutsch<br>
H.F., 1991, Adv. Cane. Res. 56, 253-312).<br>
In addition to a polypeptide chain consisting of 590 amino acid residues, the<br>
structure of the molecule of a serum embryonic AFP or that one secreted by<br>
hepatocarcinoma cells includes one oligosaccharide group linked to asparagin according<br>
to the N-type glycosylation (Yamashita K. et al., 1993, Cancer Res. 53:2970-2975). The<br>
structure of an oligosaccharide AFP chain is heterogeneous and depends on different<br>
factors: the stage of development of hepatocarcinoma or the stage of development of the<br>
embryo. Oligosaccharides affect structural properties of an AFP molecule, could be<br>
included in the content of antigenic determinants and receptor-binding centers (Deutsch<br>
H.F., 1991, Adv. Cane. Res. 56, 253-312). As distinctive from serum AFP, recombinant<br>
AFP expressed in bacterial cells is not glycosylated, which is a characteristic distinction<br>
of the product characterized in the works of Murgita (US patents 6,331,611; 6,627,440;<br>
6,416,734) and, consequently, has structural and functional properties distinguishing it<br>
from a serum analog and also from the recombinant AFP expressed in yeast systems. It<br>
is known that during expression of heterologic proteins in yeasts, their glycosylation is<br>
carried out in respect to the same amino acid residues as in the serum analog, but the<br>
structure of the oligosaccharides themselves significantly differ in respect to makeup,<br>
length and branching of the chain, which also predetermines certain distinctions in the<br>
structural and functional properties of corresponding proteins (Hard K. et al., 1998,<br>
FEES Lett. 248:111).<br>
AFP may be selectively absorbed by cells expressing specific AFP receptors<br>
(AFPR), such as embryonic cells, stem cells, activated immune cells, cancer cells or<br>
cells transformed by certain types of retroviruses (Uriel J. et al., 1989, in Jizejewsky<br>
G.I., Jakobson H.I. (eds): Biological Properties of Alpha-Fetoprotein. Boca Raton, CRC<br>
Press, vol. 2:103-117). Normal mature cells lose the ability to absorb AFP and do not<br>
express specific AFPR. In view of this property of AFP, methods have been proposed<br>
for the therapeutic use of AFP for the purpose of targeting delivering of cytostatics and<br>
other substances, suppressing the growth of cancer cells, to a tumor (Deutsch H.F.,<br>
1994, J. Tumor Marker Oncol. 9: 11-14; Tsukada Y. et al., 1994, J. Tumor Marker<br>
Oncol. 9: 99-103).<br>
AFP has a number of functional properties, which at present are being<br>
intensively studied. The classical concept of AFP as an analog of embryonic serum<br>
albumin, is at present supplemented by data concerning the capability of AFP to carry<br>
out the regulation of the growth, development and programmed death of cells<br>
(Mizejewsky G.J., 2002, Expert Rev. Anticancer. Ther. 2: 89-115). In particular, it was<br>
shown that a recombinant AFP, similarly to a serum and cultural analog, is capable of<br>
suppressing the growth of estrogen-dependent tumoral and normal tissues (Bennett J.A.<br>
et al., 1997, Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 45, 169-179; Bennet J.A. et al., 1998, Clinical<br>
Cancer Research, 4, 2877-2884). Recently, it was established that the oncosuppressive<br>
activity of AFP is carried out in accordance with the mechanism of triggering apoptosis,<br>
which is characterized by typical morphological changes, the arrest of growth, by<br>
cytotoxicity and DNA fragmentation (Semenkova L.N., 1997, Tumor Biol. 18, 261-274;<br>
Dudich E.I., et al., 1998, Tumor Biol. 19, 30-40; Dudich E.I., et al., 1999, Eur. J.<br>
Biochem. 266: 1-13; Semenkova L., et al., 2003, Eur.; J. Biochem. 70: 4388-4399).<br>
Earlier studies showed the capability of AFP to regulate differentiation and<br>
activation of immune cells. In particular, AFP is capable to suppress immune cells<br>
activated with allo- or autoantigens and to inhibit various cytokine gene expression<br>
(Yamashita K., et al., 1993, Cancer Res. 53, 2970-2975; patent US No. 5,965,528). On<br>
the other hand, AFP induces pronounced stimulation of the growth of immature bone<br>
marrow cells, stem cells and embryonic cells (Dudich E.I., et al., 1998, Tumor Biol. 19,<br>
30-40; Patent US No. 6, 627, 440).<br>
These properties of AFP, and also increased selectivity of absorption of AFP by<br>
cancer cells in vivo (Uriel J., et al., 1989, in Mizejewsky G.I., Jakobson H.I. ,eds:<br>
Biological Properties of Alpha-Fetoprotein. Boca Raton, CRC Press, vol. 2:103-117),<br>
revealed the base for its use in medicine as a therapeutic preparation in the treatment of<br>
autoimmune (Patent US No. 5,965,528) and oncological diseases (Patent US No.<br>
6,416,734; Mizejewsky G.J., 2002, Expert Rev. Anticancer. Ther. 2: 89-115).<br>
Furthermore, traditionally AFP is used as an oncoembryonic marker for early diagnosis<br>
of oncological diseases and pathologies of embryonical development (Deutsch H.F.,<br>
1991, Adv. Cane. Res. 56, 253-312). However, the use of natural AFP as a drug is<br>
technologically impossible because of raw material deficiency.<br>
Traditionally, a source for the obtainment of AFP is the blood serum of pregnant<br>
women, funic embryonal serum or ascitic fluid of cancer patients. Obviously, none of<br>
these sources are acceptable for the production of a protein substance for medical<br>
purpose because, in the first place, there is extremely limited access to the source of raw<br>
material and the content of AFP therein is low, and in the second place, there is the<br>
ever-growing risk of infection with viruses or prions.<br>
Earlier data were published relating to the expression and purification of<br>
recombinant AFP (rAFP) in different microorganisms (Yamamoto R., et al., 1990, Life<br>
Sciences, 46:1679-1686; Nishi S., et al., 1988, J. Biochem. 104: 968-972; Patent US<br>
5,206,153; Patent US 6,331,611). Thus, the intracellular production of human rAFP was<br>
carried out in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Yamamoto R., et al., 1990, Life Sciences,<br>
46:1679-1686; Patent US 5,206,153) and Escherichia coli (Patent US 6,331,611;<br>
Boismenu R., et al., 1997, Protein Expression and Purification. 10:10-26). It was shown<br>
that recombinant AFP, expressed in Escherichia coli, retains the immunoregulatory and<br>
oncosuppressive activity of the embryonic analog (Boismenu R., et al., 1997, Protein<br>
Expression and Purification. 10:10-26; Bennett J.A., et al., 1997, Breast Cancer Res.<br>
Treat. 45, 169-179). The main drawback of these expression systems is the incapability<br>
to secrete heterologic protein and the extremely low level of its production.<br>
Furthermore, the obtainment of the desired product from a biomass of recombinant<br>
strain-producers required that additional procedures of denaturation and renaturation be<br>
carried out, which resulted in a significant reduction of the yield of the product and, as a<br>
consequence, a substantial increase of its cost. Also, in the case of use of bacterial<br>
expression systems, the problem of contamination of the product with the<br>
lipopolysaccharides of the shell, which have known endotoxic activity, is also<br>
important.<br>
The technical solution most similar to the instant invention is the strain-producer<br>
of human AFP that is described in the references (Yamamoto R., et al., 1990, Life<br>
Sciences, 46:1679-1686; Patent US 5,206,153). In these sources yeast strain-producer<br>
Saccharomyces cerevisiae with intracellular production of human AFP is disclosed, the<br>
amino acid sequence of which comprises an additional section corresponding to the<br>
signal peptide of rat AFP. This invention identifies the product of secretion of a yeast<br>
strain, which product has the properties of a mature human AFP and has the original<br>
sequence SEQ ID NO:2, which corresponds to the sequence of a mature human AFP.<br>
This specificity distinguishes the product described in the instant invention over the<br>
earlier disclosed (Yamamoto R., et al., 1990, Life Sciences, 46:1679-1686; Patent US<br>
5,206,153). Furthermore, a drawback of this strain described in the cited references is<br>
the absence of mechanisms for intracellular assembly and secretion of AFP into a<br>
cultural liquid, which significantly raises the cost, makes the process of preparing a<br>
purified recombinant AFP in preparative amounts more complex and provides an<br>
extremely low level of production of AFP. Furthermore, the authors of the cited work<br>
(Yamamoto R., et al., 1990, Life Sciences, 46:1679-1686; Patent Us 5,206,153)<br>
obtained a modified recombinant AFP, the sequence of which also comprises signal and<br>
linker peptide, which limits the possibility for its medical use because of modification<br>
of the structure of the protein, resulting in a change of the immunological specificity<br>
and, as a result thereof, in an increase of the risk of immunoreactive pathology with<br>
intravenous or subcutaneous administration.<br>
In the case of heterological secretion production with yeast cells of proteins, for<br>
which the correct folding takes place with the formation of disulfide bonds (among<br>
them AFP), of importance is the level of production of yeast disulfidisomerase (Pdi)<br>
with cells of a producer (Shusta E.V., et al., 1998, Nat. Biotechnol. 16: 773-777).<br>
Furthermore, action synergic with this enzyme is provided by an increased amount of<br>
the shaperon-like yeast protein BiP (Robinson A.S., et al., 1996, J. Biol. Chem. 271:<br>
10017-10022).<br>
In spite of the fact that yeasts are traditionally considered to be organisms free of<br>
secreted proteinases (Chung B.H. &amp; Park K.S., 1998, Biotechnol. Bioeng. 57:245-249),<br>
for a number of proteins, including - for HSA, their degradation in the course of<br>
culturing yeasts is shown, which is related to the presence of still unidentified<br>
proteinases associated with the cell (Chung B.H. &amp; Park K.S., 1998, Biotechnol.<br>
Bioeng. 57:245-249; Kang H.A., et al., 2000, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 53: 575-<br>
582). All of the listed factors require that they be taken into account during the creation<br>
of a yeast producer of AFP, effectively secreted in a cultural liquid.<br>
Taking the drawbacks of the methods existing at present for the preparation of a<br>
recombinant AFP into account, it becomes obvious that there is a need for further<br>
improvement of the technology of the systems for expression and secretion of<br>
recombinant AFP, in particular the development of new recombinant strains having the<br>
capability for higher expression of a heterological protein with the provision for<br>
intracellular assembly of a native tertiary structure and subsequent secretion of the<br>
desired product into a cultural liquid.<br>
Thus, the requirement for the development of industrially applicable methods of<br>
preparing AFP, which in respect to its properties would be identical or similar to human<br>
serum AFP and thus would make it possible to use it in those fields where human serum<br>
AFP is traditionally used, objectively follows from the state of the art.<br>
The achievement of the stated object is possible by the creation of a new strain<br>
of microorganisms, which could produce in a cultural medium a polypeptide identical or<br>
similar to human serum AFP in respect to its properties.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In order to prepare a recombinant AFP, the properties of which would be<br>
identical or similar to the properties of a human serum AFP, it was necessary to develop<br>
a strain-producer providing for synthesis and production of AFP in a secreted soluble<br>
form.<br>
The strain-producer was obtained with the use of genetic engineering methods<br>
by transforming a parent strain with a plasmid, which comprised a DNA sequence<br>
encoding a protein having the activity of a mature human AFP.<br>
A recombinant secreted AFP produced in a yeast system of expression has<br>
properties identical or similar to the properties of a mature human AFP, which are<br>
determined in an immunologic analysis and by its capability to suppress the growth of<br>
cells of B-cell lymphoma Raji and other human cellular lines sensitive to apoptogenic<br>
action in a culture in vitro. This provides for an identical mechanism of action of the<br>
obtained AFP and a mature human serum AFP, obtained by a traditional method and<br>
having an amino acid sequence presented as SEQ ID NO:2. The conditions for carrying<br>
out the method of preparing AFP according to the instant invention provides for the<br>
assembly of a polypeptide with minimum defects as compared with native human AFP.<br>
The proximity of the properties of human recombinant AFP, produced in yeasts,<br>
and human serum AFP is provided by the inclusion of an expression cassette,<br>
comprising a DNA sequence encoding a mature human AFP, in the composition of the<br>
plasmid, in that the process of isolation does not require the denaturation-renaturation<br>
step, and at the same time provides for glycosylation of the obtained polypeptide, and<br>
also folding of the molecule and formation of disulfide bonds. Recombinant human<br>
AFP produced in a secreted form in a yeast system of expression differs from the<br>
recombinant analog produced in a proeukaryotic system of expression in that it is<br>
glycosylated according to the N-type, while a recombinant bacterial AFP described in<br>
patents (Murgita R.A. US Patents 6,331,611; 6,627,440; 6,416,734) is not glycosylated.<br>
Human recombinant AFP produced in a secreted form in a yeast system of expression<br>
differs from the serum analog by the composition and structure of the oligosaccharide<br>
chain, which is determined by the yeast strain and composition of the sugars included in<br>
the nutrient medium.<br>
In order to obtain a high yield of the secreted protein with the required activity<br>
from a host cell, several additional genes were added to the plasmid encoding the AFP<br>
gene, the additional genes providing a high level of gene transcription, folding of the<br>
proteins in the process of secretion and the correct formation of disulfide bonds.<br>
As a result, a pKX plasmid was obtained having the capability of transforming<br>
cells for the expression and secretion of AFP.<br>
A eukaryotic producer cell having the capability of secreting recombinant alphafetoprotein<br>
was obtained with the aid of the aforesaid plasmid.<br>
In a preferable variant a recipient strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae YBS723 was<br>
used as the initial cell, this strain being transformed by pKX plasmid to obtain a strainproducer<br>
Saccharomyces cerevisiae YBS723/pKX, deposited in the Russian Collection<br>
of Industrial Microorganisms (VKPM) under No. Y-3115.<br>
During the cultivation of a transformed strain, AFP is secreted into a medium<br>
from which it may be isolated in a pure form with the use of traditional biochemical<br>
methods.<br>
An isolated AFP obtained from transformed cells is used in the content of a<br>
pharmaceutical composition inhibiting the growth of tumor cells, which comprises the<br>
obtained AFP and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients.<br>
An isolated AFP is used in the makeup of a synergic composition, inhibiting the<br>
growth of tumor cells, which comprises the obtained AFP and chemotherapeutic<br>
preparations and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients.<br>
With use of the isolated AFP, a pharmaceutical composition on the base thereof<br>
or comprising its synergic composition, a method for treating cancer or preventing its<br>
development has been developed, which presumes the administration to a patient of an<br>
effective amount of AFP, pharmaceutical composition or synergic composition.<br>
Since the obtained AFP is similar in respect to properties to human serum AFP,<br>
the obtained AFP is used in the makeup of a synergic composition having an<br>
immunosuppressive and immunoregulating action, wherein the composition comprises<br>
AFP and cyclosporin C and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients.<br>
A method for treating autoimmune diseases and correcting the immune status<br>
has been developed with use of the isolated AFP or aforesaid synergic composition, the<br>
method comprising administering to a patient an effective amount of an AFP or a<br>
synergic composition with cyclosporin C.<br>
In view of the capability of AFP to stimulate growth of stem cells, the inventors<br>
have proposed a pharmaceutical composition stimulating the growth of stem cells, the<br>
composition comprising the obtained AFP and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and<br>
excipients, and a synergic composition stimulating the growth of stem cells is also<br>
proposed, this composition comprising the obtained AFP and derivatives of vitamins A,<br>
E, D, antioxidants, steroid hormones, isoflavones of vegetative origin with<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients.<br>
A method for stimulating the growth of stem cells in vitro is proposed with use<br>
of the isolated AFP, the aforesaid pharmaceutical or synergistic composition, the<br>
method comprising acting on cells with an effective amount of AFP or corresponding<br>
compositions.<br>
Furthermore, a method for stimulating the growth of stem cells in vivo is<br>
proposed, the method comprising administering to a patient an effective amount of AFP<br>
or the aforesaid pharmaceutical or synergistic composition.<br>
A cosmetic composition for rejuvenating skin and preventing aging of the skin is<br>
proposed on the basis of functional activity of isolated AFP, the composition<br>
comprising the obtained AFP with carriers and excipients acceptable in cosmetology<br>
and, optionally, derivatives of vitamins A, E, D, antioxidants, steroid hormones,<br>
isoflavones of vegetative origin.<br>
A method of using the obtained cosmetic composition for rejuvenating the skin<br>
and preventing aging of the skin is proposed within the frame of the instant invention,<br>
the method comprising applying the composition onto the skin of an individual.<br>

The list of sequences comprises sequences SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO:2,<br>
which are respectively the nucleotide sequence of an expression cassette comprising the<br>
encoding sequence of a human alpha-fetoprotein in the composition of a pKX plasmid<br>
and the amino acid sequence of a mature human AFP.<br>
The nucleotide sequence of an expression cassette comprises a promoter region<br>
of GAL1 yeast gene, a pre-pro region of secretion of MFal yeast gene, the encoding<br>
sequence of a human alpha-fetoprotein gene and a field of termination of transcription<br>
of a CYC1 yeast gene. This expression cassette is included in the composition of the<br>
pKX plasmid encoding the sequence of a mature human alpha-fetoprotein in a yeast<br>
strain-producer of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae YBS723/pKX system.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In order to realize the instant invention, the main technical object was the<br>
creation of a strain of yeast-producer of AFP, capable of effectively secreting the<br>
desired protein into a cultural liquid. This object is solved by constructing a<br>
recombinant DNA pKX plasmid encoding the regulated synthesis of human AFP and<br>
the strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae YBS723/pKX providing the synthesis and<br>
production of AFP in a secreted dissolved form with a level of expression not less than<br>
10 mg/1. The high level of synthesis of the desired protein in secreted dissolved form is<br>
provided in that the pKX plasmid comprises a promoter of the GALl gene with<br>
simultaneous amplification of the KAR2 gene (Robinson A.S., et al., 1996, J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 271:10017-10022), encoding a chaperon heavy chain binding protein BiP. In the<br>
genome of the strain of the recipient, there is amplification of the PD11 gene (Robinson<br>
A.S., et al., 1996, J. Biol. Chem. 271:10017-10022), encoding a disulfidisomerase<br>
enzyme, which participates in the formation of disulfide bonds during the secretory<br>
process of the proteins.<br>
The recombinant plasmid DNA comprises a human AFP gene under the control<br>
of a GALl promoter gene, providing a high level of transcription of the gene, and a<br>
KAR2 gene, encoding a chaperon heavy chain binding protein BiP, participating in<br>
folding proteins during the secretory process for the proteins, and providing a high level<br>
of production of the desired protein into the cultural liquid. Furthermore, in order to<br>
provide the correct formation of disulfide bonds and the formation of a native tertiary<br>
structure of the protein, a PS 11 gene encoding disulfideisomerase is used.<br>
A recombinant pKX plasmid DNA (Fig. 1), encoding a human AFP gene, is<br>
characterized by the following features:<br>
- it is an expression plasmid for the effective secretion of human AFP;<br>
- it has a size of 13301 bp;<br>
- it comprises a fragment encoding the amino acid sequence of a mature human<br>
alpha-fetoprotein SEQ ID NO:2;<br>
- it comprises a fragment of the bacterial plasmid pUCIS; a region of initiation<br>
of a 2-um yeast plasmid; a selective yeast marker PGK1; a KAR2 yeast gene encoding<br>
a chaperon heavy chain binding protein BiP; a PD11 gene encoding a disulfidisomerase<br>
enzime; an expression cassette with an AFP genome;<br>
- in the structure of the expression cassette presented by the nucleotide sequence<br>
SEQ ID NO:1 is included: a promoter region of GALl yeast gene; a pre-pro region of<br>
secretion of MFal yeast gene; a region encoding a mature human AFP; a field of<br>
termination of transcription of a CYC1 yeast gene. When this plasmid is introduced into<br>
a cell, a high level of transcription of the AFP gene is achieved due to the use of a<br>
highly effective GAL1 promoter. The introduction of a pre-pro region of secretion of<br>
MFal provides for the correct secretory processing of AFP accompanied by the<br>
effective secretion of the protein with the expected amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:2,<br>
if the encoding region will correspond to the DNA sequence encoding a mature human<br>
AFP in a cultural liquid;<br>
- a significant distinction of the proposed plasmid construction is that an afp<br>
gene is under the control of a highly effective GAL1 promoter, and in order to provide<br>
the correct formation of disulfide bonds and the formation of a native tertiary structure<br>
of the protein, PD11 and KAR2 genes are used.<br>
Any eukaryotic cell susceptible to such a transformation with the indicated<br>
plasmid may be transformed with the aid of the created plasmid. The selection of the<br>
cell is not critical since the methods and steps of transformation are well-known to those<br>
skilled in the art. However, depending on the type of cell and the conditions for<br>
culturing the obtained transformant, the level of expression of AFP may vary, but the<br>
fact of expression of the required peptide will take place under condition of successful<br>
transformation of the parent cell.<br>
A recipient strain YBS723 of the genotype pgkl/pgkl is used to obtain the strain<br>
Saccharomyces cerevisiae YBS723/pKX. The homozygosis of pgkl/pgkl makes this<br>
strain incapable of growth in all mediums containing any single source of carbon within<br>
the norm digestible by yeasts S. cerevisiae. The homozygosis of galSO: :PD1 l/gal80:<br>
:PD11 results in a change of regulation of the promoter of the GAL1 gene with<br>
simultaneous amplification in the genome of the PD11 gene encoding the<br>
disulfidisomerase enzyme and participating in the formation of disulfide bonds during<br>
the secretory process of the proteins.<br>
The YBS723 strain is transformed by the pKX plasmid according to the method<br>
(Ito H., et al., 1983, J. Bacteriol. 153:163-168). Transformants were selected according<br>
to the capability to grow on a full-value yeast medium (bactopeptone - 20 g/1, yeast<br>
extract - 10 g/1, bactoagar - 20 g/1) comprising 2% glucose as a source of carbon. One<br>
of such clones is designated as YBS723/pKX.<br>
The obtained diploid yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae YBS723/pKX is<br>
characterized by the following features:<br>
Genetic features: Genotype pgkl/pgkl galSO: :PDll/gal80: :PD11;<br>
Morphological features: Vegetative cells of a 48-hour culture grown on a solid<br>
nutrient medium with 2% glucose as the only source of carbon have an oval form, cell<br>
size of 3.6 x 7.1 u,m, the protoplasma is homogenous, reproduction is by gemmation.<br>
When growing on a solid medium comprising a yeast extract and peptone (YEP) at<br>
30°C after 72 hours of growth, the columns have the following appearance:<br>
1) on a YEP medium with glucose - a white color column with a smooth edge,<br>
shining surface, cone-shaped profile, cream-like consistency;<br>
2) on a YEP medium with starch - a white color column with a patterned edge,<br>
dull surface, lens-like profile and grain consistency;<br>
3) on a YEP medium with molasses - a white color column with a dull wrinkled<br>
surface, patterned edge, convex profile and cream-like consistency.<br>
Growth in a liquid medium - on a YEP medium with starch at 32°C during the<br>
first 24 hours of culturing - a cloudy liquid, white residue, does not cake, does not form<br>
parietal films.<br>
Physicochemical features: Facultative anaerobe. Temperature of growth - 23-<br>
33°C (optimum - 31°C). pH of culturing - 3.8-6.7 (optimum - 5.0). Highest level of<br>
secretion of AFP is observed at pH 6.8-7.0.<br>
Assimilation of carbon sources: ferments glucose, galactose, fructose, maltose,<br>
saccharose, dextrine, starch.<br>
Assimilation of nitrogen sources: assimilates amino acids, urea, ammonium<br>
sulphate, ammonium nitrate.<br>
Distinctive specificities: in the case of culturing on a rich medium with starch<br>
(2%), zones of fading starch surrounded by a dark rim after incubation of dish at +4°C<br>
for 24 h.<br>
Pathogenicity: the strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae YBS723/pKX is not<br>
pathogenic.<br>
Method of storage: The strain is stored on an agarized rich medium with glucose<br>
for 3 months at +4°C.<br>
The obtained strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae YBS723/pKX - producer of AFP<br>
in a secreted form is deposited in the Russian Collection of Industrial Microorganisms<br>
(VKPM) under No. Y-3115.<br>
The cell strain producer of recombinant AFP proposed by the Applicants has a<br>
number of advantages over already existing prototypes:<br>
- production of the desired product is carried out in a secreted form into a<br>
cultural liquid;<br>
- the amino acid sequence of the final product corresponds to the sequence of a<br>
mature human AFP - SEQ ID NO:2;<br>
- similar to the serum embryonal analog, rAFP, produced by the strain producer<br>
Saccharomyces cerevisiae YBS723/pKX, is glycosylated;<br>
- the yield of the desired product is significantly increased due to an increase of<br>
expression of the gene encoding the disulfidisomerase enzyme PD11 providing for the<br>
formation of disulfide bonds and the KAR2 gene encoding shaperon heavy chain<br>
binding protein BiP providing for correct assembly of the protein and secretion of the<br>
desired product into the cultural medium.<br>
It is completely obvious that the sequence encoding the DNA may comprise<br>
replacements related to degeneration of the genetic code, and also some replacements,<br>
insertions, deletions, which as a whole do not result in the obtainment of inactive forms<br>
of the fetoprotein. Possible variations are known to those skilled in the art. The obtained<br>
polypeptide may also include within the frame of the amino acid sequence conservative<br>
amino acid replacements presuming the replacement of one amino acid with another<br>
having similar properties. However, within the limits of the claimed features of the<br>
instant invention there are only those polypeptides which have primary, secondary and<br>
tertiary structure, that does not disturb the required activity of the obtained polypeptide,<br>
in particular - to have properties identical or similar to the properties of a mature human<br>
AFP, determined in an immunological analysis and in accordance with its capability to<br>
suppress the growth of cells of a B-cellular lymphoma Raji in a culture in vitro.<br>
The indexes of functional activity, at which it is regarded that the obtained<br>
polypeptide will have the properties of a mature human serum AFP are determined<br>
according to the immunological reaction and according to its capability of inhibiting in<br>
vitro the growth of cells of the B-cellular lymphoma Raji at a level not less than 10% of<br>
the activity of a mature human serumal AFP cells of the B-cellular lymphoma Raji at a<br>
level not less than 10% of the activity of a mature human serum AFP.<br>
In the case of practical use of the obtained polypeptide within the makeup of a<br>
composition, traditional additional components are used, such as excipients, diluents,<br>
preservatives, buffer solutions, physiological solution, a 0.9% solution of sodium<br>
chloride, technological additives used during the production of drug forms, etc.<br>
Compositions may be fluid (solutions, suspensions, creams, emulsions, etc.), solid<br>
(lyophilizated powder, reconstituted prior to use, an adsorbed preparation on a carrier,<br>
etc.), serving for parenteral, oral, intravenous, intramuscular, etc. administration or for<br>
external use. Wherein, the compositions for external use may comprise additives<br>
promoting the absorption and diffusion of the active substance in tissue.<br>
The synergic compositions of the instant invention provide for the presence in<br>
the composition of another active substance, wherein in the case where two active<br>
substances are present at the same time, one of which is the AFP according to the<br>
instant invention, the effect of their action is reliably higher than in the case where<br>
each substance is used separately.<br>
It is quite obvious that synergic compositions are one of the preferable variants<br>
of embodiment of the invention, since to one skilled in the art the variant of<br>
administering each active component separately is obvious. For example, in the case of<br>
anticancer therapy, each preparation of an active component may be administered<br>
separately and together simultaneously, with separation by time or by different manners<br>
of administration. The concrete selection depends on the state of the patient, the<br>
seriousness of the illness, prior treatment, etc.<br>
The selection of the therapeutic dosages for treatment may be any dose in a wide<br>
range from 0.001-10 mg/kg of a patient's weight, with the proviso that the required<br>
therapeutic effect is obtained. It corresponds to the traditional dosages of human AFP,<br>
since the obtained AFP will have properties that are similar or close in respect to<br>
activity. The limiting dosages of AFP according to the invention correspond to the<br>
dosages of human AFP, since they have a similar amino acid sequence, which is not<br>
recognized by a normal immune system of a human as "foreign."<br>
The instant invention is illustrated by the following examples, which are not of a<br>
restrictive character, but are intended to demonstrate embodiment of the invention and<br>
realization of the best variant of the embodiment.<br>
Example 1<br>
Isolation of sum RNA and construction of intermediate recombinant plasmid<br>
DNApTrcafp<br>
The total mRNA was isolated from the cellular line of human hepatoma HepG2<br>
with the aid of Trizol Reagent (Gibco BRL, USA) in accordance with a method of the<br>
producer. The cDNA was obtained using First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (MBI<br>
Fermentas) in the presence of primers oligo (dT)ig or<br>
GAAGTAATTTAAACTCCCAAAGC (3R), complementary to the 3'-end of the gene<br>
afp. Amplification of the obtained matrix for subsequent cloning was carried out in the<br>
presence of primers:<br>
CTTCAATCGATATGACACTGCATAGAAATG (Cla)<br>
CTTCCAAGCTTAAACTCCCAAAGCAG (Hind),<br>
the first of which corresponds to the 5'-sequence of mature protein gene (singled<br>
out by dark print) and comprises the recognition site for restrictase Cla I, while the<br>
second is complementary to the 3'-end section of the gene (singled out by dark print)<br>
and comprises a recognition site for Hind III. Amplification of the gene was carried out<br>
in a volume of 100 ul. The reaction mixture comprised 10 ng of cDNA, 30 pM of each<br>
of primers (1) and (2), a mixture of dNTP (0.2 mM of each), 10 mM of Tris-HCl, pH<br>
8.8, 10 mM of KC1, 2.5 mM of MgSO4, 2.5 unit Pfu DNA-polymerases (Stratagene<br>
firm) and 1 unit Taq DNA-polymerase (Fermentas firm). There were 25 cycles carried<br>
out according to the scheme: 95°C/40 sec, 39°C/40 sec, 72°C/1 min. The products of<br>
the reaction were analyzed by electroforesis in a 1% agarous gel; strips of a length of<br>
about 1790 bp were cut, DNA was extracted from the gel, treated with restrictases Clal<br>
and Hindlll and cloned into the plasmid pTrcTEGF, earlier obtained on the base of the<br>
vector pTrc99A (Amann E., et al., 1988, Gene, 69, 301-315), and treated with those<br>
same restrictases. As a result the plasmid pTrcafp was obtained; its structure was<br>
confirmed by restrictase analysis, using restrictases Cla I and Hind III, in respect to<br>
which cloning was carried out, and also Spe I, Mun I, Sec I and Sty I, the recognition<br>
sites of which are inside the AFP gene, and by determination of the nucleotide sequence<br>
of the DNA section cloned with the aid of PCR. Sequencing was carried out according<br>
to the method and with use of the Cycle ReaderTM DNA Sequencing Kit (Fermentas,<br>
Lithuania).<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of synthetic cDNA, encoding a human AFP gene<br>
In order to obtain a synthesized AFP gene, 36 oligonucleotides having a length<br>
of 62-68 b were chemically synthesized. On the basis of these oligonucleotides six<br>
double-chain fragments were obtained by the method of polymerase chain reaction,<br>
each of which was cloned to a vector pUC18. The primary structure of all the cloned<br>
fragments was confirmed by sequencing. Fragments with the correct nucleotide<br>
structure were then sequentially collected into a desired gene by the method of<br>
restriction/ligation in the form of a fragment of the plasmid pUC18. In a similar manner<br>
a cDNA was obtained for expression of modified forms of AFP, comprising deletion,<br>
mutation or added amino acid residues.<br>
Example 3<br>
Construction of a recombinant plasmid DNA pKX<br>
The plasmid pTrcafp was used as a matrix for PCR in the presence of primers:<br>
CAACCCTCGAGTTAAACTCCCAAAGC<br>
CCAACCCATGGCTAAGAGAACACTGCATAGAAA-TG.<br>
Restriction sites Ncol and Xhol (underlined) are set in the sequence of primers.<br>
The DNA fragment obtained as a result of amplification after treatment with<br>
endonucleases of restriction NcoI/XhoI were cloned onto vector pUC18/GALl-pp,<br>
comprising a promoter GAL1 and pre-pro region of secretion MFccl. As a result the<br>
plasmid pUC18/GALl-pp/afp was obtained. In order exclude possible errors of PCR<br>
the NcoI/XhoI fragment of the plasmid was sequenced. The Hindlll/Xhol fragment of<br>
the plasmid pUC18/GALl-pp/afp, comprising the promoter GAL1, pre-pro region of<br>
secretion of MFccl and encoding part of the human AFP gene (Fig. 2) were transferred<br>
to the Hindlll/XhoI bireplicon (yeast - E. coli) vector pPDX. As a result the plasmid<br>
pPDX/GALl-pp/afp was obtained. The Clal/XhoI fragment of the plasmid<br>
pPDX/GALl-pp/afp was transferred to Clal/XhoI vector of pPK, differing from pPDX<br>
by the presence of the KAR2 gene. The plasmid obtained as a result is named pKX<br>
(Fig. 1). In a similar manner the plasmid pKX-1 was obtained, comprising the synthetic<br>
human AFP gene consisting of the most widely used yeast codons (Fig. 3). The plasmid<br>
pKX-1 differs from pKX in that it comprises the synthetic gene of a mature human<br>
AFP.<br>
Example 4<br>
Obtainment of a strain-producer of human AFP<br>
In order to obtain the strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae YBS723/pKX, the<br>
recipient strain YBS723 was transformed by the plasmid pKX in accordance with the<br>
method (Ito H., et al., 1983, J. Bacteriol. 153: 163-168). The transformants were<br>
selected by the capability to grow on a full-value yeast medium (bactopepton - 20 g/1,<br>
yeast extract - 10 g/1, bactoagar - 20 g/1), comprising 2% glucose as the source of<br>
carbon. One of such clones is designated YBS723/pKX.<br>
Example 5<br>
Determination of productivity of strain-producer of human AFP Saccharomyces<br>
cerevisiae YBS723/pKX<br>
Cells of the strain-producer YBS723/pKX were grown in vials at 26°C on a<br>
rocker (250 rpm) on a medium of the following composition: glucose - 2%, glycerine -<br>
1.5%, yeast extract - 1%, peptone - 2%, distilled water. The pH of the medium was<br>
maintained at 7.0 by the addition of 0.1 M of a phosphate buffer. The initial liter of the<br>
cells was 5x106. Samples were taken after 72 hours of growth of the culture after<br>
transition to the stationary phase of growth at a titer of 7-8x108. A sample of the cultural<br>
liquid was obtained after centrifugation of the culture at 10 000 rpm for 1 min and was<br>
used in the following analyses. Samples of the CL were analyzed by electrophoresis in a<br>
12.5% polyacrylamide gel with sodium dodecyl sulphate. The gels were colored<br>
Coomassie R-250 (Fig. 4) and scanned to determine the total protein and relative<br>
content of the AFP specific protein. According to the data of electrophoresis and<br>
scanning, the total content of AFP in the CL is about 10-25% of the total protein, but<br>
there is partial intracellular degradation of the protein. The relative content of AFP in<br>
the CL was determined by the method of immunoblotting in the presence of polyclonal<br>
antibodies to AFP (Fig. 4). Also, the quantitative content of AFP in the cultural liquid<br>
was determined by the method of immunoenzymatic analysis (IEA), with use of a set of<br>
monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to human AFP. According to the IEA data, the<br>
average content of AFP in the CL in liquid mediums reached 5 mg/1.<br>
Example 6<br>
Determination of productivity of strain-producer of human AFP Saccharomyces<br>
cerevisiae YBS723/pKX in high-density mediums<br>
Feed-batch culturing of the strain YBS723/pKX was carried out in a fermenter<br>
at 26°C and pH 7.0 (automatic maintenance). The content of dissolved oxygen dO was<br>
maintained &gt;20%. During fermentation, replenishment with a medium of the following<br>
composition was carried out: yeast extract - 30 g/1, peptone - 60 g/1, glucose - 100 g/1.<br>
The rate of feeding the replenishment was such as to provide a rate of growth of the<br>
culture u=0.03. After achievement of OD50, equal to 280 optical units, the content of<br>
AFP in the CL was analyzed. The relative and total content of AFP in the CL of high<br>
density cultures of YBS723/pKX was determined as described above in example 4. In<br>
the case of culturing in high density mediums, the content of rAFP in the CL according<br>
to IFA data reached 70 mg/1.<br>
Example 7<br>
Isolation and characterization of recombinant human AFP from CL of a strainproducer<br>
YBS723/pKX<br>
Isolation of rAFP from the CL of the strain-producer YBS723/pKX was carried<br>
out as described earlier (Dudich et al., 1999, Biochemistry, 38:10406-10414) with slight<br>
changes. The cultural liquid was concentrated from 3 1 to 200 ml by ultrafiltration on a<br>
concentrating cell "Millipore" and dialyzed against 0.005M Tris-HCl, a pH 7.5, 0.1M<br>
NaCl buffer, 4°C, then centrifuged for 0.5 hours at 10 000 rpm.<br>
Ion exchange chromatography. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation<br>
was applied onto an ion exchange column DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia, 27 x<br>
4 cm), balanced with 0.01M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1M NaCl. The components not bond<br>
to sorbent were washed from the column with a starting buffer, while the elution of the<br>
desired product was carried out by 0.2 M of NaCl in a Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5 at a rate<br>
of 1 ml/min.<br>
Affinity chromatography. The fractions comprising rAFP were combined, the<br>
concentration of NaCl was brought to 0.5M and applied to an affinity column with<br>
Sepharose CL-4B conjugated with polyclonal anti-AFP rabbit antibodies, which was<br>
balanced with 0.05M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 0.5M NaCl. After the output of the proteins<br>
not bonded to the antibodies of the proteins, the adsorbed rAFP was eluted with 0.005M<br>
HC1. The peak of the output of the material upon achievement of pH from 5.0 to 3.5<br>
was determined by absorption at 280 nm. The solution of rAFP was neutralized to pH<br>
7.5 by the addition of a 2M solution of Tris-HCl, pH 7.5.<br>
Gel chromatography. Further purification of rAFP was carried out by gel<br>
chromatography on a column with Sephacryl S-200 (1.8 x 70 cm) in a 0.1 M phosphate<br>
buffer, pH 7.0; 0.15M NaCl, at a rate of 0.5 ml/min. The solution of purified rAFP was<br>
concentrated in a cell "Amicon" (membrane YM-30) under the pressure of nitrogen.<br>
Analysis of samples. The identification and purity of the obtained rAFP<br>
preparation were controlled by methods of gel electrophoresis according to Lammly in<br>
12.5% SDS-PAGE with p-mercaptoethanol with subsequent coloring by Copmassie<br>
(Fig. 4A), Western-blot-analysis on a PVDF-membrane with a titer of primary<br>
antibodies 1:500 and secondary 1:5000, dot-blot on a Hybond ECL-nitrocellulose<br>
membrane (Fig. 4B), IFA.<br>
Determination of the concentration of the protein in the solutions was carried<br>
out in accordance with the Bredford method, using a standard solution of embryonal<br>
AFP as the control, and also spectrophotometrically at 278 nm, taking the coefficient of<br>
extinction EI«/OI 2?s nm = 0.53 into account.<br>
Example 8<br>
Determination of biological activity ofrecombinant human AFP in vitro<br>
The functional activity of rAFP and the modified forms thereof were determined<br>
according to its capability of suppressing the growth of cells of B-cellular lymphoma<br>
Raji in the culture in vitro, as earlier described (Semenkova L.N., 1997, Tumor Biol. 18,<br>
261-274; Dudich E.I., et al., 1998, Tumor Biol. 19, 30-40). Preliminarily washed by a<br>
fresh medium, Raji cells were placed into each cell of a 96-alveolar plate according to<br>
5xl03 in 0.1 ml of a medium RPMI-1640 in the presence of a 10% fetal calf serum, then<br>
different doses of AFP were added for 12 hours. Proliferation of the cells was measured<br>
by a standard method by the introduction of [H3]-thymidine during the last 4 hours of<br>
culturing. For comparison, the dose-dependent reactivity was studied for two samples<br>
of AFP of embryonal origin embrAFP and yeast rAFP (Fig. 5). It is evident that both<br>
preparations manifest an expressed cytostatic activity in respect to these cells.<br>
Similarly, in order to determine the activity of preparations on the base of AFP in vitro,<br>
any other lines of cancer cells may be used that are sensitive to the suppressive action of<br>
AFP, such as human hepatocarcinoma HepG2, breast cancer MCF-7, prostate cancer<br>
LnCap, myeloblastoma U-937 and others (Semenkova L.N., 1997, Tumor Biol. 18, 261-<br>
274; Dudich E.I., et al., 1998, Tumor Biol. 19, 30-40).<br>
Example 9<br>
Use ofrecombinantAFP as anticancer preparation<br>
Anticancer preparations on the base of rAFP and of modified forms thereof may<br>
be used for inhibition of the growth of malignant neoplasms, such as primary or<br>
metastatic cancer of the liver, blood cancer (leucosis, myeloblastoma, lymphoma),<br>
breast cancer, prostate cancer. In order to determine the sensitivity of this type of tumor<br>
cells to AFP, it is possible to use different methods both in vitro and also in vivo. The<br>
method of determining activity in vitro is described in the preceding example 8. In<br>
order to determine the oncosuppressive action of preparations on the base of AFP in<br>
vivo, models on animals may be used, for example with use of Nude mice with<br>
subcutaneously or intraperitoneally implanted human lines of cancer cells, such as Raji,<br>
HepG2, LnCap, MCF-7 and others. For example, cells of B-cellular lymphoma Raji<br>
were administered subcutaneously in an amount of 1-5 x 106 per mouse. Administration<br>
of the AFP and derivatives thereof was begun 7 days prior to implantation of tumor<br>
cells intraperitoneally or intravenously in an amount of 1-10 mg/kg. The physiological<br>
buffered solution (PBS) was used as a control. The size of the tumor was evaluated by<br>
daily measurements with the aid of a micrometer.<br>

(Table Removed)<br><br>
The method of administering preparations on the base of yeast rAFP or<br>
derivatives thereof may also comprise therein the administration of chemotherapeutic<br>
preparations simultaneously or sequentially. The following may be presented as<br>
examples of such chemotherapeutic preparations: doxorubicin, vincristine, fluorourascil,<br>
metatrexate, actinomycin D, mitomycin C, tamoxifen, flutamid, vincristine, vinblastine,<br>
cyclosporin, retinoids, carotenoids, and others. Usually, a chemotherapeutic preparation<br>
may be administered in standard doses or in suboptimum doses, below the usual<br>
therapeutic. The effect of the combined action of rAFP and doxorubicin (A) and rAFP<br>
and all-trans-Retinoic acid (tRA) is presented as an example in Fig. 6. In the case of<br>
simultaneous administration of the preparations, synergic oncosuppressive action in the<br>
case of use of suboptimum doses is observed.<br>
Example 9<br>
Use ofrecombinantAFPfor stimulation of the growth of stem cells<br>
The primary culture of embryonal fibroblasts of the lung and human retina was<br>
obtained by treating with a 0.2% trypsin solution corresponding tissues of 5 - 10 week<br>
embryos obtained after legal abortions. The cells were cultured in an RPMI-1640<br>
medium in the presence of a 10% calf fetal serum (CFS). The cytostatic activity of AFP<br>
was measured as earlier described (Semenkova L.N., 1997, Tumor Biol. 18, 261 - 274;<br>
Dudich E.I., et al., 1998, Tumor Biol. 19, 30 - 40). Cells in an amount of 4xl04 in a<br>
0.15 ml medium were intensively washed with a fresh medium and placed in each cell<br>
of a 96-lune plate, then different doses of AFP were added and cultured 24 hours.<br>
Proliferation of the cells was measured by a standard method by the inclusion of [H3]-<br>
thymidine during the last four hours of culturing.<br>
The dosage dependence of the effect of AFP on cellular growth was also studied<br>
for the primary culture of human embryonal fibroblasts. AFP had a stimulating effect<br>
on these cells, reaching 50 - 90% in respect to the control (Fig. 7).<br>
Example 10<br>
Use ofrecombinant AFP in cosmetology<br>
In view of the fact that AFP has the capability to stimulate the growth of stem<br>
cells and is a growth factor for embryonal cells, its possible use is proposed for the<br>
preparation of cosmetic masks, creams and lotions. rAFP may be used as an excipient<br>
for liposome, microsome and nanosome. In view of the fact that AFP is capable of<br>
binding hydrophobic ligands, in particular, fat-soluble vitamins, steroids, isoflavinoids,<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acids (Deutsch H.F., 1991, Adv. Cane. Res. 56, 253-312); Aussel<br>
C. &amp; Masseyeff R., 1994 , Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 119: 1122-1127; Deutsch<br>
H.F., 1994, J. Tumor Marker Oncol. 9: 11-14), the combined use of rAFP with fatsoluble<br>
vitamins, such as derivatives of retinoids, carotenoids, tokoferol, vitamin D,<br>
with steroids such as derivatives of estrogens and androgens, is shown. Estradiol and<br>
others may be used as an example of such steroids.<br>
