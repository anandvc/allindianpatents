COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"MULTI-FUNCTIONAL VEHICLE EQUIPPED WITH FIRE FIGHTING EQUIPMENT AND EQUIPMENT FOR FREEING, RESCUING AND TRANSPORTING INJURED ENTRAPPED PERSONS"<br>
GEORGE SIOUTIS, a Greek citizen of 91 Voriou Ipirou, GR-165 62 Ano Glifada, Greece,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to multi-functional vehicle equipped with fire fighting equipment and equipment for freeing, rescuing and transporting injured entrapped persons.<br>
The invention is referring to the field of the art of the fire-fighting vehicles, the rescue vehicles and the ambulances, proposing specifically the construction of a vehicle which, with the properly disposed equipment and ergonomy, can combine and accomplish all three missions, that is fire fighting, freeing and rescuing injured entrapped persons and subsequently transporting those persons, which have become injured mainly as a consequence of a car accident. According to a preferred embodiment, the proposed vehicle replaces at least three conventionally independent vehicles, i.e. one fire fighting, one rescue vehicle with equipment suitable for freeing entrapped persons and two ambulances, having an illustratively proposed crew of only three persons.<br>
THE PRIORART<br>
The vehicle proposed in the present invention has not been disclosed in the prior art. The vehicles which are being used today for the accomplishment of the abovementioned operations (fire fighting, freeing-rescuing and transporting injured persons) are independent vehicles that usually are under the command of different services; the result is that, often, the accomplishment of their mission is not possible, as by way of example is the case with car accidents, which is a de facto complicated mission.<br>
It would have been possible to significantly reduce the immense material losses and most importantly losses of human lives involved in car accidents, if there weren"t objective difficulties of the organisations that undertake the mission of dealing with the accident after it has occurred, such difficulties being centered at the lack of specialised units located at crucial points of national and regional road networks, such units being equipped with sufficient and proper human resources and equipment, so as to accomplish the scope of an ambulance equipped with proper rescuing and fire fighting means.<br>
The composition of such properly organised units, • although it would contribute decisively to the reduction of casualties, is not possible until today, because of the excessively high cost, since for every such station is needed an oversupply of special vehicles and a big number of employees. The difficulties arising as a result of the current situation are daily and<br>
2<br><br>
they consist in the loss of valuable time, which is by way of example due to the delayed arrival of an ambulance which in any case has the limited capability of transporting only two injured persons, whilst in a car accident, two persons is usually the minimum of the involved injured, or due to the delayed arrival of a vehicle with rescuing equipment, having as crew firemen of general duties and insufficient training for the rescuing of entrapped people. Furthermore, such vehicles of the prior art are usually equipped with improper equipment and thereby are incapable of handling complex situations arising from the broadly varying conditions encountered in road accidents.<br>
There is a broad patent literature referring to vehicles adapted to be used in either one of the operations of fire-fighting, rescue or salvation and first aid or ambulance. By way of example EP 0 417 615 of Binz GmbH &amp; Co describes an ambulance which is equipped so as to be enabled to provide enhanced medical care to transported patients, but is restricted to the mere function of an ambulance. On the other hand EP 0 308 136 of Cleveland County Council refers to emergency vehicles such as those operated by fire brigades, which can carry alternative equipmeht so as to cope adequately with different eventualities, but which is not however capable of transporting patients or injured.<br>
In the same way GB 2 159 777 of Rosenbauer Konrad KG, US 5 785 372 of Glatzmeier Alfred et al, US 5 467 827 of  Mcloughlin John, DE- 38 02 187 of Rosenbaner Int. GmbH and DE-U-86 04 097 of CST MBH disclose various alternative improvements in fire fighting vehicles, without however including the possibility of these vehicles acting as rescue and/or ambulance vehicles.<br>
Finally ES 2 114 776 or CH 481 651 disclose rescue vehicles, which are however incapable of transporting patients.<br>
It is obvious that none of the vehicles disclosed in the hereinabove cited patent literature can be adapted to be used in effectively handling of a car accident, wherein it is often required to perform the combination of three functions. i.e. of fire- fighting, freeing entrapped persons and finally having the capacity of transporting a plurality of injured persons.<br>
It thereby is the object of the present invention to effectively overcome the disadvantages and deficiencies of the prior art, by proposing the design and construction of a single vehicle which will be capable of covering the overall needs of an incident; since it will combine the possibilities of a fire fighting vehicle with special rescuing equipment including equipment for freeing entrapped persons and further including a sufficient number of positions for the transportation of the injured persons, for instance, having a capacity equivalent to two<br>
3<br><br>
ambulances, thereby the proposed vehicle being capable of effectively coping with a road accident involving the occurrence of fire, entrapped persons and plurality of injured persons to provide with first aid and transport to hospital.<br>
The invention offers, amongst others, the following: important advantages:<br>
A.	Expertise, since personnel of only three persons who are employed in<br>
accomplishment of the particular special object of the invention, will in time obtain valuable<br>
experience in the usage of the proper instruments, so as to find and use in each particular case<br>
the advisable and secure means of intervention, taking into consideration that no incident is<br>
identical with another.<br>
B.	The financial burden is substantially reduced because of the usage of only one<br>
vehicle and a diminished number of employees for every incident.<br>
C.	The vehicle can be used also for other kinds of incidents, such as air accidents,<br>
natural calamities, etc.<br>
D.	The problem of the co-ordination of a minimum number of two independent<br>
    authorities which are conventionally involved in dealing with the accident, thereby resulting to<br>
elimination of the delays which may have tragic consequences, In this way the additional effect of minimization of the required administrative cost is also noticeable.<br>
E.	The invention, recapitulating the above-mentioned advantages, eliminates .all the<br>
current technical-economic difficulties in advantage of the society and the economy.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring now to the accompanying drawings, we will describe the invention as disclosed in the illustratively preferred embodiment depicted therein.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a common motor truck carrying a frame, is possible to be used for the mounting and the connection of a hyper-construction, in order for the above-mentioned motor track to be transformed to the special multi functional vehicle for the fire fighting, freeing, rescuing and injured parsons" transportation, which is suggested especially for the effective handling of car accidents.<br>
For the mounting and connecting of the hyper-construction onto the longitudinally extending parallel beams of IT section Al that are composing the frame of the motor truck (Fig. 1), is used the sub-frame depicted in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, which includes a pair of longitudinally extending parallel beams A2 of II section, and an arrangement of an illustrative plurality of parallel interconnecting transverse beams A3 which are perpendicularly disposed upon beams A2 and have a T cross-section. The circumference —me thereby formed rectangle is fastened with angular bars A4 (Fig.8) which are extending in a parallel direction to the beams A2.<br>
Subsequently, onto the sub-frame that has been shaped in this way and is seated onto the frame of the motor truck, is constructed the framework of the hyper-construction-cabin. As shown in Fig. 9, the above-mentioned cabin is constituted by an arrangement of, vertically and horizontally, cimferentially extending intercornnecting beams A5. The frame, in the ceiling of the hyper-construction is being formed using similar mtercornnecting beams A6. Interconnecting beams of similar configuration are used in building of the chamber of the fire extinguishers, of the interior of the equipment lockers and in building of the supporting structure of a special stretcher with which the vehicle is equipped.<br>
The hyper-construction framework, which is assembled in the above mentioned manner with interconnected, welded concave beams of various cross sections and dimensions, and with the usage of additional reinforcing elements (angles, etc.), is coated with sheet metal covering, whilst an additional metal layer is being laid on the floor, ceiling and circumference            thereby formed compartments, wherein proper doors of the various compartments are also being provided. The compartment for the transportation of patients - injured persons is preferably sound and heat insulated with a layer of insulating material which is subsequently being covered with a layer of polyester or other appropriate material in the interior of the<br><br><br>
6<br>
compartment, in order to permit a liquid cleansing and disinfecting, whilst the floor of the , same compartment is shaped with special, hermetically bound tiles.<br>
The hyper-construction, thus shaped, is seated and connected onto the frame of the motor track through the above-described sub-frame and it is characterised by the fact that it is divided in autonomous, independent compartments, wherein each one of these compartments and the whole of the hyper-construction have an ergonomic design with the appropriate arrangement of their equipment. According to the preferred, illustrative embodiment of the invention, the above-mentioned compartments are the following:<br>
-	Compartment B for injured persons and patients, with entrances Bl at the back side of the vehicle and B2 at the right side thereof (Fig. 4).<br>
-	Compartment C for the fire fighting equipment with entrances CI at the right side (Fig. 4) and C2 at the left side thereof (Fig. 2), wherein the relative doors illustratively have the configuration of a foldable screen roll. .<br>
-	Compartment D, E for installation of equipment for freeing and rescuing entrapped people with doors Dl, El at the left side of the vehicle (Fig. 2).<br>
-	Compartment F for the storage of cleansing liquids and disinfectants, gloves, cloths, etc. with a door Fl at the left side of the vehicle (Fig. 2).<br>
-	Compartment G for the storage of equipment used in the compartment-B for injured persons and patients, such as blankets, stretchers, etc., with entrances Gl (Fig.4) and G2 (Fig.2) at the right and left side thereof respectively.<br>
With the above or other similar dimensioning and ergonomic disposition, the design process of the proposed muiti functional vehicle for fire fighting, freeing, rescuing entrapped persons and transportation of the injured places a special importance in the sufficiency of the equipment and the complementary - auxiliary solutions that are given through it, in order to insure that in every case the intervention of the vehicle will be successful.<br>
In the fire fighting compartment C, the interior part of which is visible at Figs. 3, 5, 6, 13, 14, 15, 16, is located a pair of fire extinguishers of chemical powder, appropriate for the extinguishing of fires of the type A, B, C, these extinguishers being indicated with numerals C3, C4 (Fig. 5), wheeled onto wheels C5, C6, rolling on fixedly mounted guides C7, C8, and having Hie possibility to be extracted through the right and left doors CI, C2 respective^. The fire extinguishers are of the fast securing type, each one disposes of an independent launching tube with a suggested length of the order of 10 m.<br>
7<br><br>
7<br>
With these fire extinguishers it is possible to effectively deal "with any fire manifestation of at least three private motor cars, the extinguishers also being used preventively or as a matter of precaution in case of fuel leakage. Furthermore, in the fire-fighting compartment C are located, suspended and secured, crow bars of special edge shaping and an axe.<br>
The area of the successive compartments for the equipment for freeing and rescuing entrapped persons, D, E and the adjacent extreme rear storage area F, as represented in Fig. 10 or 12, are included in a longitudinal rectangular parallelepiped shell 10 and in the interior thereof, which is visible in Figs. 3, 14, 16, is included the following preferably disposed arrangement of equipment:<br>

circular cross section, which can rotate and be securely (Fig. 19) folded onto the right<br>
side of the interior walls of the cabin, thereby freeing the area, when there is no need to<br>
use the stretcher base B9. The bases of this stretcher are rotatable around axial pins B25,<br>
which pass through special brackets B24 mounted onto the walls of the cabin (Fig. 19),.<br>
whilst maintenance of the same at the open position is implemented with a proper small<br>
pin onto the upper part of the bases. The stretcher is seated (nested) onto an elastic layer<br>
B31, thereby exhibiting the possibility of absorbing a significant part of the vibrations<br>
which are being transmitted by the vehicle. The arrangement is safely locked through the<br>
security pins B30.<br>
4.  The foldable stretcher with belt, seated onto the base B9, which is of commercially available type.<br>
