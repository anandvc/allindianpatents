DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for the protection of electrolysis cells of the mercury cathode type against internal short-circuits which may occur between the anode structure and the liquid mercury cathode (amalgam) due to variations of the amalgam level caused by the accumulation of foreign matter, especially iron particles, or deviations of the amalgam stream caused by corrosion of the cell bottom surface, or malfunction of the mercury recirculation pump.<br>
According to the present invention, whenever the gap between the mercury cathode and the anodes is decreased below a safety limit in correspondence of any region of the active surface, and the local current intensity thereby reaches a dangerous level, an electromechanical system (motorised device) controlled by a computer processing voltage and current data is provided to carry out the automated raising of one or more anode rows. Moreover, in order to minimise the energy consumption directly related to the interelectrodic gap, the electromechanical system of the invention, controlled by a computer processing voltage and current data, will provide for lowering of one or more anode rows to restore the interelectrodic gap at a minimum pre-established safety level.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART In a typical  horizontal cathode mercury cell of the type  illustrated, for example, in figures 1 and 2, several types of anode adjusting devices have been applied in the past such as those herein described:<br>
2<br>
-  MULTIPLE LEVERS: this system, also called "gull wings" type, is a fully movable apparatus consisting in a rectangular frame and three double levers, one along the longitudinal axis and two along the transversal axis of the cell, each lever being equipped with two arms. In this case, the movement of the frame is a combination of the shifting of both longitudinal and transversal lever systems. Such apparatus is complex, expensive and suitable only for large-size frames supporting three or four anode rows moving all together, with a consequently low efficiency in energy saving as localised gap control is not made possible.<br>
- FOUR JACKSCREWS: this system consists in a frame equipped with four jackscrews positioned at the corners of the frame and two gear motors each driving two jackscrews. Also in this case the system, due to the cost, is conveniently applied only to large size frames bearing three or four anode rows and consequently is a low efficiency system as above explained.<br>
- TORSION BAR: this system consists in a rectangular frame with two shafts assembled under the two shorter sides. The two shafts are rotated by means of a gear motor acting, by means of a wormscrew, on two arms each connected to one shaft Having each shaft two plates welded at the ends bearing on four supporting columns, as the shafts rotate a shifting of the entire apparatus is originated. This system cannot guarantee a very precise control of the lifting velocity.<br>
-   PINIONS AND CHAINS: this system comprises a frame secured to four threaded   rods  and vertically shifted   by means of four pinions rotating<br>
3<br>
thereon, all connected by a chain, one of which being powered by a gear motor. This system cannot allow the necessary precision of the movements due to the loosening and wearing of the chains in time.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a motorised device suitable for adjusting the anodes so as to prevent short-circuits in mercury cathode electrolytic cells as well as to break eventual short-circuits before damaging of the anode structures occurs.<br>
It is another object of the invention to substantially reduce the energy consumption directly related to the extent of the interelectrodic gap, providing means for adjusting the distance of one or more anode rows from the liquid mercury cathode in order to bring the interelectrodic gap down to a minimum pre-determined safety level.<br>
It is another object of the invention to overcome the drawbacks of the above described systems of the prior art, providing a new motorised device suitable for adjusting the anodes, having following main features and advantages:<br>
-    low cost<br>
-    simplified and strong mechanical structure<br>
-    precision of shifting<br>
-    optimised shifting velocity<br>
-    easier assembly<br>
-    single anode row shifting<br>
4<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a motorised device suitable for adjusting the anodes with an optimized interelectrodic gap control efficiency thanks to the possibility of single anode row shifting and of the easy computer controlled operation on the basis of current and voltage measurements.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A typical cathode mercury cell is illustrated in figures 1, 2 and 3, wherein: Figure 1 is a schematic plan-view showing the anode rows arrangement. Figure 2 is the longitudinal side-view showing the mercury recirculation route, and<br>
Figure 3 is the transversal cross-section of the motorised device of the invention.<br>
The celt is generally equipped with a multiplicity of anode rows, each consisting of one to three single anodes. Figures 1 and 3 show a cathode mercury cell equipped with 16 anode rows, each consisting of 3 anodes. The current load is fed to the cell through copper bus-bar lines 11, raising from the bottom of the adjacent cell and connected to each anode row by means of copper flexibles 12, fixed to the copper stems 13 of the three anodes.<br>
In the inlet end-box 14 the mercury, acting as the liquid cathode, is distributed over the entire width of the cell and flows over the cell bottom 9, assembled with the proper slope, toward the outlet end-box 15. At the inlet end-box also brine, for instance sodium or potassium chloride brine, is fed to the cell.<br>
5<br>
The following description makes reference to the case of sodium chloride brine electrolysis, but it is clearly to be understood that the same considerations may apply for other electrolytes, such as for instance potassium chloride brine.<br>
In the cell, chlorine gas is produced at the anodes while the mercury-sodium amalgam is formed at the cathode. Chlorine, collected in the gas space between the brine and the flexible cell cover 16, is discharged above the brine level from the inlet end-box. The mercury-sodium amalgam, formed in the cell and collected in the outlet end- box, flows through line 17 to the decomposer 18 where the reaction between the amalgam and demineralised water, fed to the decomposer through nozzle 21, takes place, producing caustic soda and hydrogen which leave the cell separately from the top of the decomposer through nozzles 19 and 20. The mercury, stripped from sodium and collected at the decomposer bottom, is pumped back to the inlet end-box by means of pump 22 through line 23. The depleted brine, with some dissolved chlorine, leaves the cell from the outlet end-box. Figure 3 shows a detailed transversal cross-section of the above described cathode mercury cell wherein an embodiment of the a motorised device of the invention   is represented.<br>
Figure 4 shows the plan-view of the embodiment of fig. 3. Figure 5 represents the cross-section A-A of figure 4   showing additional details.<br>
Figures 3, 4 and 5 show the anode adjusting device as essentially consisting of two parts:<br>
6<br>
The first part, fixed to the main frame 8, comprises the lever system<br>
composed of support bearings 5, lever arms 6 and 7 and two shafts 24, as<br>
well as the jackscrew 3 and the gear motor 4. The main frame 8 is supported<br>
on cell bottom 9 by means of columns 25 including the plates 26 which<br>
insulate the main frame from the cell bottom, also equipped with threaded<br>
rods 27 in order to adjust the level of the main frame.<br>
The second part is composed of the movable frame (or sub-frame) 1 carrying<br>
the three anodes 2 of one single row.<br>
The two parts are connected by the four hinges 10 each consisting in a fork<br>
with a threaded rod and two nuts, in order to have adjustable connections in<br>
the vertical direction to the sub-frame 1 which is provided with holes bigger<br>
than the threaded rods of the hinges 10, so as to allow the regulation also in<br>
the horizontal direction.<br>
The components of the system (main frame, levers, sub-frame) can be made<br>
of carbon steel, protected with epoxy paint, except for the threaded parts<br>
which can be provided with a galvanic coating and protected with grease.<br>
The above components can be manufactured using standard profiles, while<br>
gear motors, jackscrews, support bearings and hinges are commercially<br>
available. This allows the low cost production of the motorised frame of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The functioning of the motorised device of the invention may be summarised<br>
as follows. When the centralised control system sends the input to rise or<br>
lower the anodes of one row , the motor 4 is actuated and acts on the<br>
7<br>
jackscrew 3 through the gearbox. The jackscrew shifts the two longer arms of levers 6, connected by a joint to the threaded bar of the jackscrew, in the vertical direction. Each lever 6 is welded to one of the two shafts 24, fixed to the main frame by means of two support bearings 5. Each shaft 24 together with the two support bearings 5 thus becomes one of the two fulcra of the double lever system.<br>
The rotation of the two lever arms 6 and, consequently, of the two shafts 24, allows the rotation of the four shorter lever arms 7 which raise or lower the sub-frame 1 to which the anodes are suspended.<br>
The ratio between the shifting up or down of the jackscrew threaded bar and that of the anodes is determined by the ratio between the lengths of the longer lever arms 6 and the shorter lever arms 7. This ratio is preferably 3/1 to 4/1.<br>
The raising or lowering movement depends from the direction of rotation of the motor, established by the centralised control system. The instantaneous shifting speed is constant depending from the rotation speed of the motor and from the gear ratio, while the total shifting is a function of the frequency of the impulses given by the control centralised control to the motor. The instantaneous shifting speed of the sub-frame 1 (i.e. of the anodes) can advantageously range from 0.3 mm/s to 0.6 mm/s. The total shifting of the anodes preferably ranges from 30 to 50 mm.<br>
8<br>

Throughout the description and claims of the specification the word "comprise' and variation of the word, such as "comprising" and "comprises" is not intended to exclude other additives, components, integers or steps.<br>
