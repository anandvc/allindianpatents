THE PATENT ACT, 1970<br>
(39 of 1970)<br>
&amp;<br>
THE PATENT RULES, 2003<br>
PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
"CLUTCHES"<br>
HIGH TECHNOLOGY TRASMISSION SYSTEMS (I) PVT. LTD .<br>
An Indian Company<br>
of K-226, MIDC Waluj, Aurangabad-431 136,<br>
Maharashtra, India.<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION DESCRIBES THE INVENTION<br>
 <br>
This invention relates to clutches.<br>
Particularly, this invention relates to clutches mounted on engine crank shafts. Still particularly, this invention relates to wet clutches currently used on engines for three wheelers and like vehicles or otherwise.<br>
A clutch is a subcomponent of an engine's transmission designed to allow engagement or disengagement of the engine to the gearbox or whatever apparatus is being driven.<br>
A wet clutch is a clutch immersed in a lubricating fluid, which keeps the clutch surfaces clean and reduces temperatures. This improves performance and prolongs the life of the clutch. Therefore a Wet Clutch is one that contains many plates that are in the oil spray of the transmission and the oil gets between the plates. The plates on wet clutches have a tendency to stick together when the engine is allowed to stand.<br>
Wet clutches mounted on engine crankshafts of engines have many constraints in their smooth functioning. Particularly, in the cost of mass production of these clutch assemblies heavy tooling maintenance cost is sustained. Moreover, the prolonged life of the clutch is also questionable because of limitations in the manufacture of the components required in the assembly and the consistency in quality.<br>
Problems arise because all the components used are mainly sheet metal parts formed, machined &amp; heat treated. Controlling the distortion of sheet metal component in heat treatment becomes very critical affecting the performance<br>
2<br>
 <br>
&amp; reliability. During the engagement of clutch the clutch box which is not guided properly, as per the clearances maintained for free movement wobbles in dynamic condition leading to unpredictable clutch characteristics.<br>
The current design of components even after introduction of CNC machining leads to heavy misalignments in assembly. Distortion of the clutch box components during heat treatment further entails maintaining larger clearances between the mating components i.e. shaft, driven plates. Current design demands for an Engine gear (Twin Gear) which is again left as a floating component on the shaft. This leads to reduced component life, higher wear, and vibration causing clutch failures. An exploded view of the clutch assembly of the prior art is annexed hereto and marked as figure 1 of the accompanying drawings.<br>
In figure 1 the following reference numerals represent the components mentioned alongside:<br>
Reference numeral   Description of component<br>
1.	Complete clutch assy.<br>
2.	Clutch box<br>
3.	Cup spring clutch<br>
4.	Spring clutch<br>
5.	Clutch shaft<br>
6.	Brass shim clutch (Washer)<br>
7.	Engine gear assy.<br>
8.	Driven plate assy.<br>
3<br>
 <br>
9.	Core plate<br>
10.	Driving plate<br>
11.	Driving plate<br>
12.	Outer clutch plate<br>
13.	Circlip clutch (lock ring)<br>
14.	Ring clutch box<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a clutch assembly which eliminates the constraints and limitations of the prior art assemblies.<br>
The power flow in the clutch according to this invention is reversed compared to any other clutch mounted after the primary reduction (on Gear Box Input Shaft) as in the prior art.<br>
The exploded view of the clutch assembly in accordance with this invention is shown in figure 2 of the accompanying drawings.<br>
Referring to figure 2 the following reference numerals refer to the components mentioned along side:<br>
All the power from the Engine crank shaft is first transferred to Clutch Hub (5) having Metal insert (6) moulded inside. Then it is transferred to Plate Clutches (9) and through clamping force and friction, goes to friction plates (8), to Clutch Housing (1) &amp; from there to the Gear (2) and is transferred to gearbox. The clamp loads are generated by Springs (10) and disengagement and engagement is affected by pushing the holder plate (11) which in turn<br>
4<br>
 <br>
pushes the Wheel Clutch (7) in turn creating gap between the friction plate and plate clutches thereby disengaging the clutch.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, several of the components are aluminum cast components which enable the components to have improved quality and less deterioration.<br>
While considerable emphasis has been placed herein on the specific structure of the preferred embodiment, it will be appreciated that many alterations can be made and that many modifications can be made in the preferred embodiment without departing from the principles of the invention. These and other changes in the preferred embodiment as well as other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the disclosure herein, whereby it is to be distinctly understood that the foregoing descriptive matter is to be interpreted merely as illustrative of the invention and not as a limitation.<br>
