				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention generally relates to network provisioning for networks such as mobile core networks and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and more particularly to dimensioning and admission control in such networks.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Network provisioning generally relates to resource allocation and management in a network and often includes issues such as admission control and/or dimensioning of the network.<br>
A substantial tendency is that the number of network nodes that form a network is growing fast, resulting in a large, complex network structure and virtual topology. In parallel with this tendency, the traffic volume between the network nodes is also growing continuously and is often difficult to predict. Traffic between nodes is also hard to measure because of the large number of nodes and traffic trunks. Therefore, the calculation of the traffic matrix is very complicated. In most of the cases it is not even possible to calculate the traffic matrix. Furthermore, the degree of traffic changes, requiring reconfiguration of the network, is also very hard to forecast.<br>
The area of resource management includes some currently open problems. To achieve good network utilization, the best possible characterization of the customer's traffic flows is required. Supporting a variety of customer applications typically requires a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the network provider and the customer, specifying the Quality of Service (QoS) and bandwidth requirements. Currently there are two ways to define the SLA and exercise admission control, namely the trunk-based (customer-pipe) model and the hose-based model, which both are static models.<br>
Admission control is an essential component of any network provisioning architecture, and is generally a question of controlling the number of connections that utilize a given set of resources in a communication network, thereby ensuring that admitted connections<br><br>
of Service (QoS)<br>
have access to the resources that are required to fulfil their Quality<br>
requirements. On the link level, admission control normally serves to restrict the number of connections simultaneously present on a transport link in the network. This means that new connections may be rejected in order to protect connections that are already admitted for transport over the link.<br><br>

The issue of connection admission control is generally quite networks such as Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Private Networks (VPNs) and similar communication networks the find an efficient admission control strategy that works and at the practical requirements such as limited complexity and high accuracy.<br><br>
network is to to specify the ir. This model,<br>
Trunk model<br>
A simple service model, or traffic provisioning model, for a transport emulate the private line service. This would require a client nodp bandwidth requirement between every possible source-destination pair the trunk model, is depicted in Fig. 1.<br><br>
When a transport network is based on the trunk model, then a mesh of trunks is created, each trunk extending from one customer endpoint to another. A customer endpoint must maintain a logical interface for each of its trunks. In the context of a UMTS core transport network for example, the customer endpoint is typically a Media Gateway (MGW) or equivalent node.<br><br>
For the trunk model it is normally expected to give the point-to-point<br><br>
traffic demands.<br><br>
In other words, the specification of the traffic matrix is needed. This miodel enables the network provider to utilize the network in the best way, since the known traffic matrix<br><br>
and routing strategy exactly determine the required link capacities. On the other hand, a critical part of this model is that the communication pattern between the end-points is very difficult to describe. It is a justified assumption that the network provider has very limited information about the traffic matrix, and the customer is unable to exactly predict and define the loads between the nodes. Consequently, in case of an unknown traffic matrix, the application of the trunk or customer-pipe model is quite limited, especially in the VPN context. Another problem with this model is the significant management complexity. In each node, incoming and outgoing traffic description parameters have to be defined for each associated node to define the required capacities in relation to the associated nodes. In case of a full mesh logical network, the sum of parameters to be configured is proportional to the square of the number N of nodes in the considered network or part of the network.<br>

the hose model, which is another traffic provisioning model, a customer specifies a of endpoints to be connected. The connectivity between endpoints in the network is fied by a hose, comprising:<br><br>

The network must be dimensioned for the distribution, winch may cause significant overdimensioning in the n viewpoint of management complexity, the hose model requires parameters than the trunk model. Since only the aggregated i traffic volumes have to be defined in each node, the number of configured is proportional to the number of nodes in the network.<br><br>

Measurement Based Admission Control<br>
Yet another type of traffic provisioning model is Measurement<br>
Control (MB AC). In particular, drop-based MB AC, winch is an example of end<br>
measurement based admission control, is known from references<br>
MBAC, a node measures the network performance to guide the<br>
decisions. For example, the data receiver monitors the user plane<br>
remote site and detects dropped packets by comparing the Real-time<br>
(RTF) sequence numbers. A dropped packet is an indication of con<br>
backbone and RTF provides a mechanism to detect dropped or<br>
packets. The node admits a new call only if the loss rate towards<br>
question is below a given threshold value. Given that the queuing de<br>
be quite small, the quality of service is measured strictly in terms of packet loss<br><br>
in multiple-fault ocks further calls<br>
Admission control decisions in the case of measurement-based provisioning are always based on the actual performance of the network, so all unexpected situations<br>
are handled properly. For example, if congestion occurs on a link situations then packet loss is measured in the data receiver, winch bl until the congestion disappears.<br><br>
However, may not be network of applications<br>
measurement-based admission control has the drawback that proper QoS guaranteed if the drop requirement is strict, for example in the backbone UMTS system. Tins may prevent the use of drop-based MB AC in many<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The    invention    proposes    cluster-based    provisioning,    winch implementations basically requires only minor modification to the design and preferably no new functionality in the routers.<br><br>
in    preferred network node<br><br>

A basic idea is to partition the network or at least part of the network clusters or logical resource domains. Each such cluster hence includes nodes. At the bottom level we have the network nodes, winch are parti clusters, winch in turn may be divided into so-called super clusters i forth for any number of ingher levels. In a basic scenario, however, structure comprises network nodes partitioned into basic clusters, wit] clusters.<br><br>
The idea then is to perform cluster-based provisioning of the network, including at least the intra-cluster level and the inter-cluster level, with the configuration and application of one or more novel node-to-cluster traffic limitations on<br>
the inter-cluster<br>
level. Tins provisioning strategy applies well to large-scale networks, and the clustering makes it possible to define the node-to-cluster limitations and find an appropriate equilibrium between management complexity and overprovisioning.<br><br>
SLAs in flexible • network traffic in<br>
The proposed service model allows us to configure service level definitions such as the the VPN context - based on the concept of site/node clusters - in a more 'ay than the pure hose and trunk models. By defining a cluster as a set of ites/nodes, we can differentiate between intra-cluster traffic and inter-cluster the service level definition (e.g. SLAs).<br><br>
The selection allocatioi<br>
of traffic provisioning model, also commonly referred to as bandwidth or admission control model, is preferably based on the available information about the traffic distribution. As a simple rule of thumb, for "known" traffic, it may be beneficial to use a trunk or trunk-like model, winle for "unknown" traffic a hose or hose-like model can be applied.<br>
We can use trunk and hose models for intra-cluster provisioning. Trunk provisioning witinn a cluster normally means that die service level definitions (e.g. SLAs) include point-to-point limitations between each node pair in the cluster. Hose provisioning for intra-clusier traffic normally means that the total traffic to any other nodes/sites in the same cluster is limited at each node/site.<br>

If external clusters are considered as if they were a single entity, then we could use so-called chster-based trunk or hose modeling for inter-cluster provisioning. Trunk provisioning in the context of inter-cluster traffic may for example be applied such that bandwidth for traffic aggregates to each cluster from each site/node and/or from er to each site/node is being limited. Hose provisioning for inter-cluster ng may for example be applied to impose bandwidth limitations for the total<br>

traffic provisioning model may be used. Tins implies that a traffic provisioning<br>
sometimes referred to as an admission control model, can be selected<br>
for each cluster in the network if desired, thus providing a ingher degree<br>
compared to prior art network provisioning. Tins is normally performed<br>

Similarly, for the description of the inter-cluster traffic (the clusters) a so-called cluster-based hose, trunk or other traffic provisi be used in the network (or for each group of clusters), preferably d available information about the traffic. Tins means that cluster-! type   characterization   may   be   applied   to   inter-cluster   traffi characterization of inter-cluster traffic typically means that the total<br><br>

Primarily,  static  traffic  provisioning  models  are  considered.  For plying the concept of trunk and/or hose models to intra-cluster and inter-makes it possible to simplify traffic characterization and management without significantly degrading the bandwidth efficiency of the network.<br>
Selecting between trunk and hose models for intra-cluster provisioning and between cluster-based trunk and hose models for inter-cluster provisioning gives the following basic comb nations:<br>
Intra-trunk, inter-trunk: In tins case, the trunk model is used both inside the clusters and between the clusters.<br>
Intra-hose, inter-trunk: Inside clusters, hose-based provisioning is used, and between clusters the cluster-based trunk model is used.<br>
Intra-trunk, inter-hose: Inside clusters the trunk model is used, and for inter-cluster traffic the cluster-based hose model is used.<br>
\ Intra-hose, inter-hose: In tins case, hose-model-based provisioning is<br>
used both inside the clusters and between the clusters.<br>
As previou y mentioned, the novel provisioning strategy is preferably based on a logical divi on of the network into clusters, and a differentiation between inter-cluster andintra-cl Ister traffic.<br><br>
Infra-cluster traffic<br>
Consider a given cluster Q and a node « sitting in that cluster. Th<br>
give the infra-cluster traffic of tins node, for example in the follow<br>
ways.<br>
Intra-trunk:   In tins case we exactly limit the amount of traffic of u inQ.<br><br>

onfigurations are made in each concerned node.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
One of the benefits  of cluster-based provisioning is that  the  required traffic information in the service level definition such as Ihe SLA can be adjusted to the<br><br>

traffic information available. In a network with a number N of node bandwidth elements to be specified at a node is 2 for the traditiona 2(N- 1) for the traditional trunk model, assuming that there may both in-bound and out-going traffic. Naturally, the number of li reduced by a factor 2 if a single entry is employed for both directi cluster-based provisioning method, the number of bandwidth 1 between these two extremes. Given that there are M clusters (N  M them have the same size (N/M 1), the number of traffic limitation traffic in a node is 2(N/M- 1) for the trunk model and 2 for the ho number of limitations for inter-cluster traffic is 2(M' - 1) for the the hose model. Thus, for the four combinations of the intra-provisioning, the total number of traffic limitations is as follows:<br>
•	ultra-trunk and inter-trunk: 2M+ 2N/M- 4.<br>
•	intra-hose and inter-trunk: 2M<br>
•	infra-trunk and inter-hose: 2N/M.<br>
•	infra-hose and inter-hose: 4.<br><br>
For the specific example of N = 9 nodes and M = 3 clusters, the size N/M = 3 nodes, and the total number of traffic limitations is then e infra-trunk and inter-trunk case, 6 for the infra-hose and inter-frun infra-trunk and inter-hose, and finally 4 for the infra-hose and inter-hc<br><br>
f each cluster is [ual to 8 for the case, 6 for the e case.<br><br>
for a bandwidth bandwidth value. In the number of /hen a cluster is than in<br>

If clusters are identified based on DP prefixes, the configuration entrj limitation normally includes a list of IP address prefixes and a such a case, the configuration complexity not only depends or bandwidth values but also on the number of IP address prefixes, mapped to a single IP prefix, the configuration is clearly less cases when a cluster is defined by a number of disjoint IP prefixes.<br><br>
Definit on of clusters may for example follow the rules below:<br>
A cluster is preferably defined by a set of IP addresses. Tins set can be a single IP subnet or a set of IP subnets. Naturally, other connectionless networks than IP-based networks can be used, with a corresponding cluster definition.<br>
There could be multiple overlapping layers of clusters. In other words, one node may be part of multiple clusters.<br>
A resource cluster is normally not restricted to be mapped to a single part of the network. It may contain multiple network parts. In most cases, a cluster includes nodes in proximity, but cases when a cluster includes disjoint network parts are not excluded.<br>
Resources are preferably provisioned statically.<br>
The cluster-based provisioning generally relates to resource allocation and/or network management,   and   preferably  includes   admission   control   and/or   link   capacity<br><br>

The optmal selection of clusters and the corresponding dimensioning is a complex task, winch makes the application of a support tool advantageous. For example, the selectioi/configuration of the clusters may be defined as an optimization task, in winch the objective function has two components: a) minimizing the number of CAC entries/parameters and b) maximizing the bandwidth efficiency. Alternatively, the selection of clusters is preferably chosen such that bandwidth efficiency is better than a predef ned value and the number of CAC configuration parameters is less than a predefined critical value. Note that we then normally assume that the acinevable utilization increases if the number of configuration parameters increases. Note that not<br><br>
just the number of CAC entries/parameters but also the number definition of clusters affects management complexity.<br><br>

For example, the number of configuration parameters can be minimised resulting overprovisioning compared to pure trunk provisioning is threshold   percentage   (say   50%).   Another   alternative   is   to overprovisioning with a fixed number of configuration parameters (sa each node).<br><br>

The tool then preferably includes an algorithm that performs tins given that the requirements on cluster definitions, such as mmiber inerarchy  levels,  maximum number of CAC  entries/parameters bandwidth efficiency are specified.<br><br>

gn tool preferably supports any combination of the above possibilities.<br><br>
Dimensioning is preferably based on an off-line traffic-engineering tool to dimension the network according to the proposed provisioning model. As mentioned above, the cluster selection procedure finds the given number of clusters and splits the nodes betweer them, for example with respect to a well-defined optimization task such as minimizing the number of CAC entries/parameters. Alternatively, clusters are configured more or less directly in accordance with network topology or other similar factors.<br>
In case of hose modeling, the dimensioning should preferably be based on global optimization taking into account all topology information and routing at the same time to provide the best bandwidth efficiency. In case of both hose and trunk model shortest path roui ing may be used.<br><br>
In a pre<br>
erred embodiment, the dimensioning algorithm calculates the required link<br>
capacities based on the determined inter-cluster and infra-cluster traffic limitations/configurations, and is preferably performed by a dimensioning tool that optimize required traffic values by linear programming.<br><br>
the nove Typicall traffic m designin<br>
The dimensioning task based on intra- and inter-cluster provisioning models requires node-to-cluster constraints/limitations for computing the required capacities.<br>
, the network dimensioning does not assume the knowledge of the actual<br>
itrix, but only assumes some side constraints on the traffic matrix and aims at<br>
a network that is able to carry any traffic that meets the given side<br>
constrain! s<br><br>

The side constraints typically express what we know in advance what we can measure. In addition to the traditional hose and trunk li also limit the traffic between a node in a given cluster and an arbitral y another cluster or a set of other clusters. Similarly to the traditional are normally used for describing the traffic, one for the outgoing the incoming traffic.<br><br>
In the following, a mere illustrative example of how the links capacities required by the cluster based bandwidth reservation method can be computed vrill be described. •The proposed algorithm is an extension of the method proposed in [71<br>
We are given a network represented by a directed graph G = (V, E). The set V of vertices denotes the set of nodes of the network, winle the physical links are represented by the set E of edges. In tins example, it is also assumed that we are given the actual routing between any pair of nodes. Tins would basically be done by giving a for each pair of nodes u and v.<br>
However, we use a more general way to give the routing. For each pair of nodes u and v we introduce the flow function ruv : E - [0, 1], where ruv(e) denotes the portion of the traffic between u and v that goes on the link e. In tins way, we can handle the single path routing (by setting ruv(e) to 1 on the edges of the path between u and v and to 0 on the other edges) and the shared routing as well. Once the routing is given, a given traffic matrix determines the load on the links. If tw denotes Ihe amount of the traffic from u to v then the traffic of a certain link e is:<br>
The approach suggested by the invention does not assume knowledge of the actual traffic matrix, but only assumes a set of side constraints, and the network is preferably<br><br>
dimensioned in such a way that the capacity will be sufficient for any traffic matrix that meets the side constraints. The invention preferably employs cluster-based side constraints to describe the real traffic in a more exact manner to avoid the unnecessary overdim msioning.<br><br>
The side<br><br>
constraints can be classified as follows.<br><br>
Trunk Parameter. Here we know the maximum amount of the traffic from a certain given node u to another one v. We denote the maximal value with Tu_v. Tins constraint can be formalized as follows.<br><br><br><br>
Hose Parameter. In case of the traditional hose traffic description we limit the traffic originated from and directed to a certain node u, denoted by Tu_,v and TV-.u respectively. In mathematical formulae it means:<br>
and<br><br>
Cluster Bcsed Parameter. Here we limit the traffic between a node u and an arbitrary set S of ncdes (regarded as one or more other clusters). Similarly to the previous case, two values used for describing the traffic, one for the outgoing and another one for the incoming traffic, Tu_s and TSUJ respectively. In mathematical formulae:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Note that all the above constraints are linear making it possible to s optimization problems that use these constraints. Our capacity res based on a clustering of the nodes. Thus, the set of the nodes is pre; into k disjoint subsets called clusters, i.e. V = Ct u €2 u...u Ck whenever <br>
The idea is to differentiate between the intra-cluster and the inter previously outlined, in both cases there are two natural possibilities.<br><br>

Intra-hose: In tins case we limit only the sum of the outgoing traffic of node u that goes to the other nodes in the same cluster, and the sum of the incoming traffic of node u that comes from the other nodes in ttye same cluster, by using the parameters Tu_,ck and Tck_u.<br><br>

Inter-trunk: In tins case, we limit the amount of traffic of node u to each of a first set of other clusters and the amount of traffic of node u from each of a second set of other clusters, e.g. by using the parameters Tu_q and TCj-u for each j * k. Note that is generally a weaker description than the traditional point-to-point trunks. The first set of other clusters and the second set of other clusters are typically equal to each other, but may differ from each other.<br>
Inter-hosi<br>
In tins case, for each node u we limit only the sum of the outgoing traffic that goes to (any node in) any other cluster, and the sum of the incoming traffic that comes from (any node in) any other cluster than Q, by using the parameters Tu_w\ck and Tv\ck-u, respectively.<br>
The inter-model, based hos<br>

trunk limitations normally correspond to what is called a cluster-based trunk the inter-hose limitations normally correspond to what is called a cluster-model.<br><br>
As we carry any dimension maximum maximize constraint! efficiently package [<br>
ied, our aim is to dimension the network in such a way that it is able to possible traffic scenario that meets our preconditions. Thus we may each individual link considering the worst-case scenario. To compute tins traffic of a link e, the traffic matrix tuv that meets our preconditions and the traffic value (1) should be found. As the objective function (1) and the (2), (3), and (4) are linear functions, the value of (1) can be maximized by any linear programming method, e.g. the simple lp_solve software 8], Of course we have to repeat tins process for each edge e 6 E in order to<br><br>
get the total necessary bandwidth.<br><br>
Note, that ruv(e) is zero for most of the u,v pairs, so the size of the re to solve can be largely reduced by omitting each variable tuv who route does not use the edge e. It is also possible to omit the constr affect any remaining variables.<br>

It has been shown that the choice of routing may have a signific bandwidth efficiency, both in trunk and hose dimensioning, dimensioning the best choice is when the traffic is routed via the leas tree routing (i.e. when the traffic is routed via a spanning tree performance for hose dimensioning. In the cluster-based provisioning the clustering divides the network into two levels, winch motivates th<br>
the effect of multi-level routing solutions. Applying for example shorlfest-path and tree routing, gives the following additional routing scenarios:<br><br>

where the cluster definition may be a list of IP subnets, and a cluster is defined as a set ofMGWs.<br>

A possible cluster definition for an illustrative core transport network is shown in Fig. 7. It should be understood that more than two levels, i.e. the underlying nodes and the clusters, can be included in the logical network representation. In the example of Fig. 7, w(s have optional super-clusters indicated by ellipses. Note that sites can also be considered as clusters.<br><br>

In general, Virtual Private Networks (WNs) play an important ro business mainly because they provide great flexibility for customers networks. Solutions are also developed to attract customers with limited infrastructure for network management. Offering simple and : management models for customers is also considered as an important providers. Simplicity for the customer, however, often means incr effort and less efficient network utilization for the network operator hand,  reduced  network  efficiency  and  more  management operational costs and yield more expensive services.<br><br>

As previously mentioned, hose and trunk resource provisionin examples of resolutions of the conflict between efficient backb flexible bandwidth model. In the customer-pipe model, winch is model, point-to-point traffic demands are specified between ea allowing the operator to independently reserve bandwidth between Tins model enables the VPN provider to utilize the network in the known traffic matrix determines exactly the required link ca information is also known. The critical part of tins model is that pattern between the end-points is very difficult to estimate. Custon to exactly predict and define traffic loads between the sites, specify the complete site-to-site traffic matrix for the Service Level Even if the estimation of the traffic matrix is supported by tools, i the proper bandwidth requirement due to traffic fluctuations.<br>
Another drawback of the customer-pipe model is the complexity of<br><br>
trunks. Resource reservations needs to be configured in each source node to each sink<br>
node, including policing configuration for the provider and shaping/admission control configuration for the customer. If a full mesh logical network is assumed between the customer's sites then the sum of parameters to be configured is proportional to the square of the number of nodes in the VPN. Therefore, configuration complexity may become the main drawback of (he trunk model in case of large-scale networks.<br>
The hose model takes a more pragmatic approach by requiring only the specification of the aggregated incoming and the aggregated outgoing traffic volumes at each node. These traffic parameters can be specified either according to the physical capacity of the link to the provider's network or based on measurements. Winchever approach is used, the estimation of traffic demand is easier and more precise compared to the customer-pipe model. Configuring hose parameters requires much less effort from both customers and providers man configuration of trunks. Only one incoming and one outgoing hose parameter should be configured in each source node. Thus, the number of configuration parameters is proportional to the number of VPN sites. These properties make the hose model definitely attractive for customers. On the other hand, the application of the hose model has a great impact on resource provisioning in the VPN backbone. Network dimensioning based on partial information on the traffic demands yields overdimensioning compared to trunk model, if the same service performance is required in both cases. Furthermore, the required overprovisioning increase! significantly with the size of the network, regarding both the number of nodes and the number of links.<br><br>

By  dividing   the  network  into   multi-node   clusters,  performing   cluster-based provisioning of the network on at least two levels and using cluster-based traffic 0n we can find an appropriate equilibrium between management complexity in the same or similar manner as previously described.

In other words, bandwidth limitations figured for a set of sites, winch may be a single site, a cluster or even lusters.

Thus, the configuration complexity not only depe of bandwidth values but may also depend on the number of IP a already indicated before. When a cluster is mapped to a single configuration is clearly less cumbersome than in the case when it inc disjoint prefixes. Therefore, if clusters are already defined at the then the addressing plan should preferably take them into account.<br><br>
VPNs are normally implemented with some kind of tunneling usually also assumes that the IP addressing of the VPN is in addressing of the IP backbone.

Returning to the responsibilities of the VPN provider. Besides th policing, whose management complexity is similar to that of shap control at the customer, the VPN provider has to check if the backb<br><br>
configuration of ng and admission ne links can cope<br><br>
with the traffic limited by ingress policers. In tins respect, the cluster-based method is somewhat similar to hose provisioning in that more complex calculations are needed to fulfill tins task due to the current lack of a resource reservation protocol supporting hose-based and clusters-based reservations. Checking network resources against trunk-<br><br>
based n source requests is normally easier since all resource reservation protocols, such as aggregate RSVP or future NSIS protocol for routed IP VPNs and RSVP-TE for MPLS VPNs, support trunk reservations. The provider may also manage the task of optimizing routing, as previously described, so that the actually used network resources are minimized. Thus, it is desirable for the VPN provider to try to solve the optimization task with requirements or restrictions on minimum bandwidth efficiency, maximum number of bandwidth limitations and maximum number of IP prefixes. Preferaby, the basic link capacity algorithm described above is implemented in a network design tool by the VPN provider for calculating the necessary link capacities for traffic given by the selected cluster-based description, making it possible to design congestion-free networks.<br>
The applicability and limitations of the proposed methodology and the effect of different routing strategies and fault tolerance have been examined by simulating several t st scenarios for VPN networks. In the following, we will briefly present a limited b t yet illustrative selection of these simulations.<br>
Performance study<br>
In the simulations, the AT&amp;T reference backbone network with its publicly available topology Iwas used as a basis for the performance analysis. We mainly considered only the part of the network made up of the Gateway nodes, backbone nodes connected with N QC48 and N OC192 links, to obtain our test network comprising 25 sites connecte with 44 links.<br>
First, we compare the proposed cluster based provisioning for the different variants without considering routing optimization and protection methods. We then study how routing optimization can be used to improve the bandwidth efficiency. Finally, we mention tie effect of protection methods on the results.<br><br>

The comparison of the provi here based on shortest path routing and assumes that no protei applied. The capacity of required links and the management com measures characterizing the performance of the methods, so we cal evaluation. The studied network scenario is based on the 25 node mentioned, and a pre-calculated traffic matrix. We performed di possible number of clusters (from 1 to 25). From now on we use th for the cluster-based provisioning variants for short reference:<br><br>

Fig. 12 presents the average number of bandwidth limitations per si related to management complexity. Note, that although the pu: provisioning is not displayed explicitly, their results can be seen in are equivalent to specific cases of the cluster-based methods: If th then method 'hf and *hh' is equivalent to hose model and m correspond to trunk model. If each site is in a separate cluster (i.e. clusters in the AT&amp;T network) then Tib' and 'th1 corresponds to "hf is the trunk model.<br>
Results for all of the four variants of the cluster-based method are between the results of hose and trunk provisioning, regarding both link capacity and management<br><br>
complexity. The figures also inghlight the trade-off between bandwidth efficiency and management complexity. To compare the variants, the real question is the necessary management complexity using a clustering that provides a certain targeted overprovisioning. The management complexity - overprovisioning scatterplot in Fig. 13 ccmpares the variant from tins point view. The dots represent the management comp exity and overprovisioning values for the above cluster configurations. It can be seen that method "hf is the best in tins sense on the AT&amp;T network: it requires the least management complexity for any fixed overprovisioning. For example, by allowing 40% («tra bandwidth in the backbone over the requirement of the trunk model, the needol configuration parameters in a site decreases from 25 to 5. Note that the hose model would require 160% extra bandwidth with a single parameter in each site.<br>
The reason why hose provisioning is better than trunk provisioning on the intra-cluster level is that link capacities inside the cluster are not very sensitive to the provisioning method, but trunk model needs much more configuration parameters than hose. The small difference in capacities is because the topology of a cluster is typically close to a tree, winch is the optimal scenario for the hose model, due to the sparse topology of the example AT&amp;T backbone network.<br>
For inter-cluster provisioning, trunk provisioning significantly overperforms the hose method because traffic to different clusters typically go via different paths. Thus, ignoring the destination clusters in the SLAs (i.e. using hose provisioning for inter-cluster traffic) means that the worst case traffic towards each cluster is the sum of all inter-cluster traffic as opposed to the trunk model where only the traffic of the specific destination cluster need to be considered.<br>
In the f blowing, the main focus will be on the performance of tins intra-hose, inter-trunk variant from different aspects.<br><br>
Similar tests were made for the other methods as well, and the results confirmed the expectation that using tree routing where hose dimensioning is applied and shortest path routing in network segments dimensioned based on trunk model are the best choices regarding the routing. Thus, there is a best routing type for each of our cluster-based methods, as follows:<br>
•	routing 'tt' for method 'hh'<br>
•	routing 'ts' for method 'ht'<br>
•	routing 'st' for method 'th'<br>
•	routing -'ss' for method 'tt'.<br>
Tins confirmed the notion that performance such as bandwidth efficiency can be increased if routing is adjusted to the selected provisioning method.<br>
We also investigated how the four methods perform with their best routing. With regard to management complexity as the function of overprovisioning at different dimensioning methods with optimal routing, the situation is very similar to that of using shortest path routing for each method. The most important difference is that one can not state that method 'ht' is the overall best, because it has been found that if the overprovisioning factor is 50% or ingher, some 'th' and 'hh' configurations requires less management complexity to acineve the same overprovisioning, though the difference is almost negligible.<br>
One may suspect that the efficiency of routing strategies is sensitive to the underlying topology. To investigate tins, the proposed methods were also tested on randomly generated network topologies. First random topologies with the same number of nodes and links as the AT&amp;T network were analyzed. The average link capacities of 10 different random graphs were computed for each of the four methods with their best routing, and it was found that there is no significant difference between the random<br><br>
Similar tests were made for the other methods as well, and the results confirmed expectation that using tree routing where hose dimensioning is applied and short path routing in network segments dimensioned based on trunk model are the b choices regarding the routing. Thus, there is a best routing type for each of our clust jased methods, as follows:<br>
•	routing 'tt1 for method lib'<br>
•	routing 'ts1 for method 'ht1<br>
•	routing 'st1 for method 'thf<br>
•	routing 'ss1 for method 'tt1.<br>
tins confirmed the notion that performance such as bandwidth efficiency can increased if routing is adjusted to the selected provisioning method.<br>
We also investigated how the four methods perform with their best routing. W regard to management complexity as the function of overprovisioning at diffen dimensioning methods with optimal routing, the situation is very similar to mat i sing shortest path routing for each method. The most important difference is that o can not state that method 'ht' is the overall best, because it has been found that if 1 c verprovisioning factor is 50% or ingher, some 'th1 and 'hh' configurations requires 1 management complexity to acineve the same overprovisioning, though the differen in almost negligible.<br>

The effect of link density of the network were also investiga topologies with the same number of nodes (it was 25 in our varying the average degree of the nodes (or equivalently varying ti in the network). The average link capacities of 10 different ran different average node degree from 2.5 to 7.5 in 0.5 steps were o minimal management complexity providing an overdimensioning ft was determined. Fig. 15 shows that method Tit' still performs the link density, but its performance gets worse and approaches the number of link in the network increases. Note that the curve because there is no configuration of that method winch could overprovisioning at any network density.<br><br>
Another important question is how the provisioning methods seal size. So, tins is the next step in the evaluation of the cluster-methods.

methods Tit' and 'tt' are linear winch indicates that the number of parameters to be configured increases proportionally to the number of nodes, the difference is that the 'ht1 method provides smaller complexity. In contrast to them, the curve of the 'th1 method is increases rapidly at ingher number of network nodes suggesting that the method should typically not be used in large networks.<br>
In backbone networks one of the most important requirement is fault tolerance. Tins fact motivated some tests to examine how much overprovisioning is needed to provide certain fault tolerance using traditional dimensioning methods and the proposed cluster based i schemes. Tunneling techniques used for VPNs can be different. The major difference regarding protection methods is if the backbone is a routed IP network or an MPLS-based network.<br>
If the VPN backbone is a routed IP network, then the route of packets is normally determined based on the actual content of the routing tables. As a result of a link<br><br>
failure, protoco<br><br>
the routing tables of the affected routers will be then updated by routing s. When all routing tables are updated based on the changed link state<br><br>
uiformapon, the packets are routed via the shortest path considering only the remaining links. Tins process may take a few minutes. It also means that the protection path of a given flow depends on the failed link.<br>
If the VPN backbone is an MPLS network, then the advanced failure handling features of MPLS can be used. One of the techniques for protection in MPLS is using backup label switched paths. In other words, two LSPs are usually set up between each pair of sites, a primary and a secondary. When all links are up then the primary LSP is used for communication. Whenever a link along the path of the primary LSP fails, traffic is rerouted to the secondary LSP. To ensure that the secondary LSP can be used in case of any failure along the path of the primary LSP, the two LSPs must be disjoint. As LSPs are set up before the actual link failure, the protection path of a given flow is independent of winch link is failed. An advantage of tins technique is the much faster<br><br>
fail-over time than IP routing. Note that fast re-route is another protection in MPLS networks, winch is often used in combination w It has even faster fail-over time than switcinng over to the backup L local detour between the nodes connected by the failed link.<br>
The effect of protection methods in routed IP networks and in MP LSPs was also examined, assuming shared protection for single link failures. In other words, network dimensioning was performed in such will support the rerouted traffic in case of any link or any node fails, time. In the case of a link failure the topology of the network and th change. When a node fails, then all of its links are removed from the traffic is also removed from the traffic matrix.<br>

protection is based on Edmonds1 algorithm that chooses the primary and secondary<br><br>
paths such that the summed costs of the two paths will be minimal, so the shortest path and the primary path could be different.<br>
summary, the cluster-based provisioning method makes it possible to define point-nt(cluster) SLAs between VPN providers and customers. The proposed dimensioning algorithm calculates, preferably using linear programming, link capacities such that none of the links could get congested even at worst case traffic distribution constrained by point-to-cluster traffic limitations at network edges and assuming that routing is known in advance. The congestion-free network design allows the VPN customer to use non-adaptive real-time services over the VPN, winch would be degraded in case of congestion. The dimensioning algorithm is clearly an inevitable tool for the VPN provider offering cluster-based SLAs and QoS guarantees, because the task bf checking the availability of network resources manually is complex and no IP based resource reservation protocol supports it.<br><br>
Based on<br>

the studied network examples, it can be concluded that the best among the variants of the cluster-based-provisioning, winch needs the least number of nfigurajtion parameters to acineve the same overprovisioning target, was the one hose-like limitations for ultra-cluster traffic and trunk-like limitations for er traffic. Tins variant remained the best irrespectively of the network with and without protection and for optimized routing too.<br>
It proved to be the best compromise between hose and trunk model. In the studied 25-node network, using five clusters decreased the number of bandwidth limitations per node froni 24 to 5, and increased the required link bandwidth by 40% without route optimization compared to trunk model. At the same network, the extra capacity needed by the hose model was 160%.<br>
Route optimization further decreased the overdimensioning of the cluster-based provisioning, in the above example of rive clusters from 40% to 25%. A two-level<br><br>

Tolerance for single failures in a routed IP network required 135% the trunk model. By using cluster-based provisioning with five clus capacity increased with another 35%  (with  170%  compared protection).

11.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said step of partitioning a<br>
number of said network nodes (1,2, 3, 4,5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) into clusters (A, B, Bl, B2,<br>
C1, C2) comprises the step of defining said clusters based on at least one of:<br>
-	traffic distribution between nodes;<br>
-	subnet address planning;<br>
-	network topology;<br>
minimization of the number of admission control parameters in the nodes; and maximization of bandwidth efficiency.<br>
12.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein an admission control unit<br>
(220) exercises cluster-based admission control on at least two levels, including intra-<br>
cluster admission control and inter-cluster admission control, based on the traffic<br>
limitations in said cluster-based service-level definition.<br>
13.	A system for resource allocation and management in a communication<br>
network having a set of network nodes (1,2, 3, 4,5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) for implementing the method claimed in claim 1, said system comprising:<br>
-a cluster selection unit (122) for partitioning a number of said network nodes into clusters (A, B, Bl, B2, C1, C2), each cluster having at least two nodes;<br>
-a service level definition unit (126; 214) for defining traffic limitations on at least two levels, including intra-cluster level and inter-cluster level, said traffic limitations including at least one node-to-cluster traffic limitation for inter-cluster traffic; and<br>
