				<td>MANUAL SEA WEED ALGAE JUICE EXTRACTOR<br><br>
Field of  Invention<br><br>
This invention generally relates to Manual Sea Weed Algae Juice Extractor used for the purpose of extracting juice from Sea Weed Algae named Kappaphycus alvarezii without Electric Power. This extractor can also be run by hydraulic unit.<br><br>
This invention is mainly concentrated on the extraction of juice from the Sea Weed Algae named Kappaphycus alvarezii without Electric Power as well as increase the productivity. Though this invention is explained with respect to the extraction of juice from the Sea Weed Algae named Kappaphycus alvarezii, this invention will also be useful in extraction of juice from Sea Weed Algae such as Gracilaria edulis, Gracilaria arcuata etc and in various applications where in extraction is required.<br><br>
To fabricate the Manual Sea Weed Algae Juice Extractor the components required are Power press set up with male die, female die, Column with spring. Filter, Collector and other fabrication items. Hydraulic unit in case the extractor is run using hydraulic power.<br><br>
Prior Art<br><br>
Prior to this invention after cultivating the Sea Weed Algae, it is directly supplied to the manufacturers, and then the manufacture extracts the juice from SeaWeed Algae and uses that juice in their products. This Process increases extra work load for getting less quantity of Sea Weed Algae juice.<br><br>
Hence to avoid the above problem, this invention i.e. Manual Sea Weed Algae Juice Extractor Machine, which can be easily installed at the farming place itself so that the juice can be extracted quickly before it gets dry, by this process the quantity and quality of juice extracted will be increased as well as the fanner will get good selling price.<br><br>
Accordingly what is needed; in the art is an improvement that overcomes the above-mentioned deficiencies of the prior art.<br><br>
It is to be noted that the prior art descriptions give in detail information of the technology, method, process and system known in the art. It explains the deficiency in the related art and the object of the invention being to overcome or surmount the problem associated with the prior art. This forms the essential feature and the object of the invention.                                                                       <br><br>
Summary of Invention<br><br>
The inventors have made great effort to provide a system, which meet the requirement of the industry and overcome the problem associated in the prior art. The first aspect and feature of the present invention is to provide a system, which is unique, rugged, efficient and economical.<br><br>
Brief Description of Drawings<br><br>
The accompanying drawings are intended to provide further understanding of invention and are incorporated in and constitute a part of invention. The drawings illustrate an embodiment of invention and together with the description illustrate principle of invention.<br><br>
The drawings should not be taken as implying any necessary limitation on the essential scope of invention. The drawings are given by way of non-limitative example to explain the nature of the invention.<br><br>
For a more complete understanding of the instant invention reference is now made to the following description taken in conjunction with accompanying drawings.<br><br>
The various feature of novelty which characterize the invention are pointed out specifically in the claims which a part of description. For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantage, specific objects by its use, reference should be made to the drawings and descriptive matter is which there are illustrated and described preferred embodiments of invention.<br><br>
