DESCRIPTION<br>
LIQUID TANK, VIEWING DEVICE FOR UNDER-LIQUID OBSERVATION, AND<br>
OPTICAL FILM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to liquid tanks, viewing<br>
devices for under-liquid observation, and optical films. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to: a liquid tank<br>
such as an aquarium tank and a tank with a liquid volume meter,<br>
suitably used as a container the inside of which is viewed through<br>
a transparent wall; a viewing device for under-liquid observation<br>
suitably used as a viewing device for underwater observation;<br>
and an optical film for the liquid tank or the viewing device.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
The liquid tank includes an aquarium or observation<br>
container, and particularly tanks for raising and breeding fishes<br>
and the like thereinside are common. Such tanks are usually<br>
composed of a transparent material. In an aquarium tank<br>
containing water 21 as shewn in Fig. 9, for example, ambient<br>
light is reflected on the external and internal (outer and inner<br>
surfaces) of an observer-side transparent plate (the transparent<br>
wall 11) , and this makes it difficult for the observer to clearly<br>
view the inside of the tank and also to photograph it clearly<br>
because strobe 1 ight is reflected. With a view to clearly observe<br>
aquarium or food fishes raised or bred in the tank from the outside,<br>
modifications and improvements have been made not only for the<br>
tank itself such as a viewing window and a transparent wall but<br>
for maintenance tools installed on the tank, including an air<br>
pump and a cleaning tool.<br>
[0003]<br>
For example, as a way of more clearly viewing underwater<br>
 <br>
objects, it is commonly known that an anti-reflection thin film<br>
is coated on the external surface of a glass or acrylic resin<br>
transparent wall constituting a tank, or alternatively, an<br>
anti-reflection film is attached to it, thereby preventing<br>
reflection of ambient light on the external surface of the wall<br>
(hereinafter, also referred to as "external<br>
surface-reflection").<br>
[0004]<br>
With regard to a technology for preventing reflection on<br>
an interface between a content of the tank and the internal surface<br>
(the interior of the tank) of the wall (hereinafter, also referred<br>
to as "internal surface-reflection") in addition to the external<br>
surface-reflection, for example, Patent Document 1 discloses<br>
that at least an observer-side one of the transparent walls<br>
constituting the tank has an anti-reflection function on its<br>
both surface.<br>
[0005]<br>
Examples of the liquid tank also include a tank equipped<br>
with a window (viewing window) used as a liquid volume meter<br>
and through which objects present in the liquid can be viewed.<br>
Also in such a tank, reflection on the external and internal<br>
surfaces of the viewing window occurs in the matter of the<br>
above-described tank, so that an observer has a difficulty in<br>
accurately measuring the volume of the liquid.<br>
[0006]<br>
In the tank inside which fishes are raised and bred, there<br>
is required to minimize or completely prevent adhesion of algae<br>
to the wall surface, thereby maintaining the wall surface clean<br>
and keeping the fishes in captivity healthy. As a technology<br>
of achieving it, for example, Patent Document 2 discloses a film<br>
for lining a water tank, provided with a tacky layer having the<br>
transparency and water resistance on one surface of a transparent<br>
resin film, further a release sheet or a sheet of paper on the<br>
surface thereof and a peeling off means for peeling at least<br>
one end of the release sheet or paper.<br>
 <br>
[0007]<br>
Similarly in the liquid tanks, the clear under-liquid<br>
observation is difficult also in viewing devices for under-liquid<br>
observation, including goggles andaquascopes. In goggles, for<br>
example, reflection on a lens surface might occur.<br>
[0008]<br>
As a technology of preventing such surface reflection,<br>
a "moth-eye structure", a kind of nanostructure, is known in<br>
the field of optical materials. The moth-eye structure includes<br>
a great number of nanometer-sized conical protrusions formed<br>
on a transparent substrate surface, for example. As disclosed<br>
in Patent Documents 3 to 6, the moth-eye structure allows<br>
continuous change of the refractive index from air to the<br>
transparent substrate, so that incident light does not recognize<br>
the interface as an optical surface, and as a result, reflection<br>
of the light can be significantly decreased.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
[0010]<br>
When optical films having a surface with a nanostructure<br>
such as a moth-eye structure are used under water or another<br>
liquid of the tank, under-liquid life such as microorganism and<br>
 <br>
algae tend to adhere to the film surface. This might look like<br>
stains and deteriorate the appearance, and further lead to a<br>
reduction in transmittance. For example, when a moth-eye<br>
structure 16 is used, a stain 31 such as underwater life is fixed<br>
to the features (the moth-eye structure 16) as illustrated in<br>
Fig. 10, and this stain is very difficult to remove, for example,<br>
even by washing with a cloth and the like because a fiber 32<br>
of the cloth is generally much larger than the structure 16.<br>
Also in a viewing window-including tank or a viewing device each<br>
including the optical film, stains are easy to adhere to the<br>
film but it is difficult to remove them therefrom. When the<br>
technology disclosed in Patent Document 2 is employed as a measure<br>
against this stain, the release sheet or the sheet of paper for<br>
preventing this stain is disposed on the moth-eye structure,<br>
so that the anti-reflection function derived from the moth-eye<br>
structure can not be exhibited. Further, ambient light is<br>
reflected on the interface between media with different<br>
refractive indexes, i.e., water and the release sheet or the<br>
paper, and the viewing is significantly deteriorated as a result.<br>
Thus in the use of the nanostructure such as a moth-eye structure<br>
for the purpose of preventing the surface reflection on an<br>
aquarium or observation container, the film with the<br>
nanostructure is required to prevent the surface reflection and<br>
further suppress the stains that are generated due to the content<br>
of the container and to allow easy removal of the stains. Also<br>
in the use of the nanostructure such as a moth-eye structure<br>
for anti-surface reflection of the viewing device, the film with<br>
the nanostructure is required to prevent the surface reflection<br>
and further suppress the stains from adhering to a transparent<br>
window of the viewing device and to allow easy removal of the<br>
stains.<br>
[0011]<br>
The technology of Patent Document 1 does not suffer from<br>
such a problem relating to the stains peculiar to the<br>
nanostructure because instead of the nanostructure, the<br>
 <br>
multi-layer anti-reflection film is used. However, this<br>
multi-layer structure leads to poor wavelength dispersion<br>
characteristic of the anti-reflection film to cause coloring<br>
of reflected light. Further, unlike the film with the moth-eye<br>
structure, the multilayer anti-reflection film can not decrease<br>
the reflectance to such a level that almost no surface reflection<br>
occurs. When disposed on the internal surface of a transparent<br>
wall or the external surface of a transparent window, for example,<br>
the multi-layer anti-reflection film is readily damaged by hit<br>
of fishes to the wall or window. That is, the multi-layer<br>
anti-reflection film usually has poor durability. As mentioned<br>
above, in the use of the multi-layer anti-reflection film for<br>
the purpose of anti-surface reflection, the film is required<br>
to provide further improved visibility by suppressing the<br>
coloring and reducing the reflectance and to show enhanced<br>
durability. The multi-layer anti-reflection film is an<br>
expensive material and requires complicated production steps,<br>
and therefore it might be lack in versatility.<br>
[0012]<br>
The present invention is devised considering the<br>
aforementioned situations. An object of the present invention<br>
is to provide a liquid tank, a viewing device for under-liquid<br>
observation, and an optical film, each excellent in visibility<br>
and durability and being easy to clean.<br>
[0013]<br>
The present inventors made various investigations on a<br>
liquid tank excellent in visibility and durability and easy to<br>
clean, and noted a moth-eye structure. The inventors found that<br>
the following effects can be achieved when not only the moth-eye<br>
structure but also a protective layer covering it are disposed<br>
on the internal surface of a transparent wall constituting the<br>
tank. First, the surface reflection, especially the internal<br>
surface-reflection, can be markedly decreased while the coloring<br>
is suppressed. Secondly, the durability on the internal surface<br>
of the tank is improved. Finally, the internal surface of the<br>
 <br>
tank can be readily cleaned. Thus, the present inventors have<br>
found the solution of the aforementioned problems and arrived<br>
at the present invention,<br>
[0014]<br>
The present invention is a liquid tank: having a transparent<br>
wall, including, on an internal surface of the wall,<br>
a first moth-eye layer having a moth-eye structure,<br>
and<br>
a protective layer covering the moth-eye structure, in<br>
this order from the wall side. This liquid tank is excellent<br>
in visibility and durability and easy to clean. Further, the<br>
liquid tank can be produced at a much lower cost than in use<br>
of other anti-reflection films such as a multi-layer<br>
anti-reflection film.<br>
[0015]<br>
The liquid tank of the present invention may or may not<br>
include other components as long as it essentially includes the<br>
above-mentioned components, and the configuration thereof is<br>
not especially limited.<br>
The following will mention preferable embodiments of the<br>
liquid tank of the present invention in detail. The following<br>
embodiments may be appropriately employed in combination.<br>
[0016]<br>
With a view to significantly decrease the external<br>
surface-reflection and further improve the visibility, it is<br>
preferable that the liquid tank further includes, on an external<br>
surface of the wall, a second moth-eye layer having a moth-eye<br>
structure, and the second moth-eye layer being disposed in a<br>
region facing the first moth-eye layer.<br>
[0017]<br>
For further improvement in durability, it is preferable<br>
that the protective layer contains a fluorine-containing resin.<br>
The fluorine-containing resin generally has a refractive index<br>
of about 1. 3 to 1. 4, so that the refractive index of the protective<br>
layer containing such a resin can be readily made substantially<br>
 <br>
equivalent to that of water. That is, according to this, the<br>
liquid tank of the present invention can be suitably used as<br>
a water tank.<br>
[0013]<br>
It is preferable that the protective layer has a refractive<br>
index substantially equivalent to that of a liquid to be stored<br>
in the tank. According to this, the effects of the present<br>
invention can be more surely exhibited.<br>

index substantially equivalent to that of water. According to<br>
this, the liquid tank of the present invention can be suitably<br>
used as a water tank.<br>
[0020]<br>
It is preferable that the protective layer has a refractive<br>
index smaller than that of each of the transparent wall and the<br>
first moth-eye layer. According to this, the transparent wall<br>
and the first moth-eye layer can be composed of the respective<br>
appropriate materials, and the refractive index of a liquid to<br>
be stored in the tank can be readily made substantially equivalent<br>
to that of the protective layer.<br>

to an internal surface of a liquid tank having a transparent<br>
wall, the film including a moth-eye layer having a moth-eye<br>
structure and a protective layer covering the moth-eye structure<br>

present invention"} . The liquid tank of the present invention<br>
can be easily and inexpensively provided by attaching the first<br>
optical film of the present invention to the internal surface<br>
of the transparent wall.<br>
 <br>
[0023]<br>

visibility and durability and easy to clean. Further, the<br>
viewing device including such layers can be produced at a much<br>
lower cost than in use of other anti-reflection films such as<br>
a multi-layer anti-reflection film.<br>
[0030]<br>

EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0044]<br>
The liquid tank and the first optical film of the present<br>
invention can provide a liquid tank excellent in visibility and<br>
durability and easy to clean. More specifically, the use of<br>
the liquid tank and the first optical film of the present invention<br>
allows a marked decrease in coloring and an improvement in<br>
durability of the internal surface of the liquid tank, and further<br>
allows easily cleaning the internal surface of the tank. Further,<br>
the refractive index of the protective layer can be easily made<br>
substantially equivalent to that of a liquid to be stored in<br>
the tank. As a result, the reflection on the surfaces,<br>
particularly on the internal surface of the tank can be markedly<br>
decreased. Inaddition, the protective layer andair are usually<br>
different in refractive index, so that the liquid level in the<br>
tank can be readily determined by being viewed from the outside<br>
through the transparent wall.<br>

observation excellent in visibility and durability and easy to<br>
clean. More specifically, the use of the viewing device and<br>
the second optical film of the present invention allows a marked<br>
decrease in coloring and an improvement in durability of the<br>
external surface of the viewing device, and further allows easily<br>
cleaning the external surface of the device. Further, the<br>
refractive index of the protective layer can be easily made<br>
substantially equivalent to that of a liquid to be in contact<br>
with the device. As a result, the reflection of ambient light<br>
on the surfaces, particularly on the external surface, of the<br>
device can be markedly decreased.<br>

BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0047]<br>
The present invention will be explained in more detail<br>
below on the basis of Embodiments, with reference to accompanying<br>
drawings. The present invention, however, is not limited to<br>
these Embodiments.<br>
[0048]<br>
In the present description, when one member has a<br>
refractive index substantially equivalent to that of another<br>
member, the refractive indices thereof is not necessarily<br>
completely the same and may be substantially the same to such<br>
a degree that the effects of the present invention are exhibited.<br>
[0049]<br>
In the present description, the refractive index is<br>
expressed as a value measured at a wavelength of 589 nm (D ray)<br>
at a room temperature (25°C).<br>
[0050]<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
The liquid tank of Embodiment 1 has a transparent wall,<br>
and on the internal surface of the wall, a first moth-eye layer<br>
 <br>
having a moth-eye structure and a protective layer covering the<br>
moth-eye structure are disposed in this order from the wall side.<br>
[0051]<br>
Inside the tank of the present Embodiment, a material<br>
containing at least a liquid is stored. An observer views the<br>
content of the tank, such as under-liquid objects (e.g., living<br>
creatures) , the liquid level, the liquid itself from the outside<br>
through the transparent wall. Thus, the tank of the present<br>
Embodiment is suitably used as an aquarium or observation tank,<br>
including a water tank and a tank with a viewing window.<br>
[0052]<br>
According to the tank of the present Embodiment, the first<br>
moth-eye layer having a moth-eye structure allows markedly<br>
reducing light reflection on the interface between the first<br>
moth-eye layer and the protective layer (e.g., a reflectance<br>
of 0.1 % or lower). The transparent wall and the liquid<br>
(hereinafter, also referred to as a "content liquid") to be stored<br>
in the tank are usually different in refractive index. The<br>
material for the first moth-eye layer can be appropriately<br>
selected from those having a refractive index substantially<br>
equivalent to that of the transparent wall. The material for<br>
the protective layer can be appropriately selected from those<br>
having a refractive index substantially equivalent to that of<br>
the content liquid. Specifically, the first moth-eye layer<br>
ensures the refractive index compatibility with the transparent<br>
wall, and the protective layer ensures that with the content<br>
liquid. As a result, the refractive index can be continuously<br>
changed from the content liquid to the transparent wall, so that<br>
the internal-surface reflection in a region below the liquid<br>
level can be markedly decreased (e.g., a reflectance of 0.1%<br>
or lower).<br>
[0053]<br>
Patent Document 6 discloses a reflection preventing film<br>
that includes a transparent layer composed of hardened matter<br>
of an ionizing radiation-setting resin composition. On one<br>
 <br>
surface of the transparent layer, a structure provided with a<br>
projecting and recessing part on which count less fine project ions<br>
and recessions are formed with a pitch shorter than the wavelength<br>
of light. Further, a layer (coating layer 4) composed of a resin<br>
composition and having a refractive index lower than that of<br>
the transparent layer is laminated on the fine projections and<br>
recessions. It is also disclosed that the material with a<br>
refractive index of 1.3 to 1.4 is used for the surface layer<br>
4. However, reflection of about 2% occurs on the interface<br>
between air (refractive index of 1) and this surface layer 4<br>
(refractive index of 1,35}. for example, when the layer 4 has<br>
a refractive index of 1.35. Thus, this anti-reflection film<br>
is poor in the effect of reducing unnecessary reflection.<br>
[0054]<br>
The anti-reflection mechanism derived from the moth-eye<br>
structure excludes A/4 conditions unlike in the use of the<br>
multi-layer anti-reflection film, and therefore coloring can<br>
be almost completely prevented.<br>
[0055]<br>
The liquid tank includes the protective layer covering<br>
the moth-eye structure in addition to the first moth-eye layer,<br>
and materials excellent in durability can be appropriately<br>
determined as a material for the protective layer. Accordingly,<br>
the durability of the internal surface of the tank can be improved.<br>
[0056]<br>
Since the moth-eye structure is covered by the protective<br>
layer, adherence of stains to the moth-eye structure, from which<br>
the stains are difficult to remove, can be prevented. The shape<br>
of a portion to be in contact with the content liquid (surface<br>
shape) of the protective layer is not especially limited, and<br>
therefore the surface can be formed to be more flat than the<br>
moth-eye structure. Even when adhered to the protective layer,<br>
the stains can be readily removed therefrom.<br>
[0057]<br>
The refractive index of the protective layer, which is<br>
 <br>
substantially equal to that of the content liquid, is usually<br>
different from that of air. In the region below the content<br>
liquid level, the reflective indices of the respective members<br>
are made substantially equal to each other. In the region above<br>
the level (generally the region exposed to air) , the refractive<br>
indices of the respective members are not matched and as a result<br>
of this, the internal surface-reflection occurs . Based on this<br>
difference in occurrence of the internal-surface reflection<br>
between the regions below and above the content liquid, the<br>
position (level) of the content liquid can be readily determined<br>
by being viewed from the outside through the transparent wall.<br>
[0058]<br>
The moth-eye structure of the present invention can be<br>
formed, for example, by coating a UV-curable resin on a base<br>
film or a mold surface, pressing the film against the mold, and<br>
curing the resin coating by UV radiation through the base film.<br>
This allows producing the liquid tank dramatically inexpensively<br>
in comparison to use of other anti-reflection films such as a<br>
multi-layer film (multi-layer anti-reflection film) requiring<br>
expensive processes involving two or more coating processes,<br>
deposition processes, and the like.<br>
[0059]<br>
It is preferable that the liquid tank includes, on the<br>
external surface of the transparent wall, a secondmoth-eye layer<br>
having a moth-eye structure, and the second moth-eye layer is<br>
disposed in a region facing the f irst moth-eye layer. This second<br>
moth-eye layer allows markedly reducing the external<br>
surface-reflection (e.g., a reflectance of 0.1% or lower) . As<br>
a result of this, the reflection on the region where the first<br>
and secondmoth-eye layers overlap with each other can be further<br>
decreased. The first and second moth-eye layers are disposed<br>
so as to overlap with each other in the viewing direction.<br>
Between the first and secondmoth-eye layers, the shape, size,<br>
and location thereof may be the same or different but preferably<br>
the same.<br>
 <br>
[0060]<br>
The location of the first and second moth-eye layers and<br>
the protective layer is not especially limited as long as they<br>
can be viewed from an observer. Examples thereof include a side<br>
surface, an upper surface, and a bottom surface of the tank.<br>
The first and second moth-eye layers and the protective layer<br>
may be formed over the entire or part of the transparent wall,<br>
but preferably formed on at least part through which the observer<br>
views the content of the tank. Specifically, when the liquid<br>
tank of the present Embodiment is used in an application where<br>
the viewing direction is predetermined, the first and second<br>
moth-eye layers and the protective layer may be disposed only<br>
on the transparent wall facing the observer, not on all the walls .<br>
[0061]<br>
The moth-eye structure is not especially limited as long<br>
as it includes a large number of nanometer-sized protrusions.<br>
Specifically, the moth-eye structure includes, but is not<br>
especially limited to, a large number of protrusions each having<br>
a height (depth) of 1 nm or larger and smaller than 1 µm ( = 1000<br>
nm) . More specifically, the moth-eye structure preferably<br>
includes protrusions whose pitch (a distance between tops of<br>
adjacent ones of the protrusions) and height are each smaller<br>
than a visible light wavelength (380 nm to 780 nm), and more<br>
preferably includes substantially conical protrusions each of<br>
which has a pitch of 50 nm to 300 nm and a height of 50 nm to<br>
300 nm. The thickness of each of the first and second moth-eye<br>
layers is generally, but not limited to, about 1 µm to 30 µm.<br>
[0062]<br>
This surface structure is typically called "moth-eye<br>
structure" and a film with this structure is known as an ultra-low<br>
reflection film allowing a reflectance of 0.1% or lower for<br>
visible light, for example. Fig. 8 is an explanation view of<br>
a moth-eye structure (the view for explaining the principle of<br>
continuous refractive index change from the surface and the<br>
marked reflection decrease on the interface). Fig. 8(a) is a<br>
 <br>
schematic view showing a cross-sect ion of the moth-eye structure.<br>
Fig. 8 (b) shows refractive index change in the moth-eye structure.<br>
Fig. 8 shows the case where the moth-eye structure is exposed<br>
to air. The moth-eye structure-including film typically has<br>
protrusions 19 smaller than a visible light wavelength (380 run<br>
to 780 nm) as shown in Fig. 8(a), and as shown in Fig. 8(b),<br>
the interface refractive index can be regarded to gradually and<br>
continuously increase from the refractive index of the medium<br>
(air) on the film surface (refractive index of air is 1.0) to<br>
a value equivalent to the refractive index of a material<br>
constituting the film (for example, a refractive index of a resin<br>
is ordinarily about 1.5). As a result, no refractive index<br>
interface substantially exists, and the reflectance on the<br>
interface is significantly decreased.<br>
[0063]<br>
The moth-eye structure can be formed by nanoimprint,<br>
including UV nanoimprint and thermal imprinting. Particularly<br>
preferably, an aluminum substrate with nanometer-sized cavities<br>
formed on its surface by anodization is used as a mold. More<br>
specifically, the mold with nanometer-sized cavities can be<br>
prepared by cut-polishing an outer circumference surface of a<br>
conical or cylindrical aluminum tube formed by extruding, and<br>
alternately repeating, for example, three times, anodization<br>
and etching for the cut-polished aluminum surface (outer<br>
circumference surface). According to this method involving<br>
anodizing, nanometer-sized recesses can be formed in a random<br>
placement and in a uniform distribution, and seamless<br>
nanostructures needed for continuous production can be formed<br>
on a columnar or cylindrical mold roller surface. Accordingly,<br>
the seamless nanostructures can be continuously transferred to<br>
a workpiece (for example, a UV-curable or thermocurable resin<br>
film).<br>
[0064]<br>
The materials for the first and second moth-eye layers<br>
are not especially limited. It is preferable that the refractive<br>
 <br>
index of each of the first and second moth-eye layers is<br>
substantially equivalent to that of the transparent wall. More<br>
specifically, the difference in refractive index between the<br>
transparent wall and the first and second moth-eye layers is<br>
preferably 0.05 (more preferably 0.03) or smaller, and in this<br>
case, the reflection on the both interfaces can be hardly<br>
recognized,<br>
[0065]<br>
The other optical characteristics of the first and second<br>
moth-eye layers are not especially limited and may be the same<br>
as those of common moth- eye films . The first and second moth-eye<br>
layers are preferably transparent to such a degree that an<br>
observer can view the content of the tank. More specifically,<br>
it is preferable that: the light transmittance is 90% (more<br>
preferably 95%) or higher; the haze is preferably 10% (more<br>
preferably 1%) or lower; the refractive index is 1.45 to 1.55<br>
(more preferably 1.47 to 1.53).<br>
[0066]<br>
In view of readily preparing the first and second moth-eye<br>
layers by the above-mentioned nanoimprint, resins that can be<br>
cured by energy beams, e.g., electromagnetic waves such as UV<br>
light and visible light or thermocurable resins are preferably<br>
used as the material for the first and second moth-eye layers.<br>
[0067]<br>
Each of the first and second moth-eye layers may be (1)<br>
formed on the transparent wall with a base film therebetween<br>
or may be (2) directly formed on the transparent wall.<br>
[0068]<br>
According to the embodiment (1), an optical film including<br>
the moth-eye structure-containing layer and the protective layer<br>
covering the moth-eye structure; and an optical film having a<br>
moth-eye structure-including layer can be preferably used.<br>
Specifically, mass-produced films formed by nanoimprint can be<br>
used, which allows an improvement in productivity of the liquid<br>
tank of the present Embodiment.<br>
 <br>
[0069]<br>
Another Embodiment of the present invention provides such<br>
an optical film. The present Embodiment provides an optical<br>
film (film for the tank internal surface) attached to the internal<br>
surface of the liquid tank of Embodiment 1, i.e., the liquid<br>
tank having a transparent wall, the optical film including a<br>
moth-eye layer having a moth-eye structure (the above-mentioned<br>
first moth-eye layer) and a protective layer covering the<br>
moth-eye structure (the moth-eye structure of the<br>
above-mentioned first moth-eye layer).<br>
<br>
[0070]<br>
The base film is a base for supporting a material (for<br>
example, a UV-curable or thermocurable resin) for the (first<br>
and/or second) moth-eye layer during the production steps. It<br>
is preferable that the base film has transparency, and<br>
resistances to water and solvent (liquid). The base film<br>
preferably has a refractive index substantially equivalent to<br>
that of each of the first and second moth-eye layers and the<br>
transparent wall. More specifically, the difference in<br>
refractive index among them is preferably 0.05 or smaller (more<br>
preferably 0.03 or smaller), and in this case, the reflection<br>
on the both interfaces can be hardly recognized. From the same<br>
viewpoint, the difference in refractive index between adjacent<br>
ones of these members is preferably 0.05 or smaller (more<br>
preferably 0.03 or smaller).<br>
[0071]<br>
The other optical characteristics of the base film are<br>
not especially limited and may be the same as those of a base<br>
for common optical films. The base film is preferably<br>
transparent to such a degree that an observer can recognize the<br>
contents of the tank. More specifically, it is preferable that<br>
the base film has a light transmittance of 90% (more preferably<br>
95%) or higher, a haze of 10% (preferably 1%) or lower, and a<br>
refractive index of 1. 55 to 1. 45 (more preferably 1. 53 to 1. 47) .<br>
[0072]<br>
 <br>
The optical film of the present Embodiment is preferably<br>
a transparent film with transparency, waterproof property, and<br>
resistances to water and solvent (liquid). The optical<br>
characteristics of the entire optical film of the present<br>
Embodiment are not especially limited. The optical film is<br>
preferably transparent to such a degree that an observer can<br>
recognize the contents of the tank. More specifically, it is<br>
preferable that the optical film has a light transmittance of<br>
90% (more preferably S5%) or higher and a haze of 10% (more<br>
preferably 1%) or lower.<br>
[0073]<br>
Specific examples of the base film include ZEONOR by ZEON<br>
Corp., ARTON by JSR Corp., COC and TPX each by Mitsui Chemicals,<br>
Inc. Olefin films are preferably used as the base film. The<br>
thickness of the base film is generally, but not limited to,<br>
about 30 µm to 100 µm.<br>
[0074]<br>
According to the embodiment (1), it is preferable that<br>
the optical film of the present Embodiment has an adhesive paste<br>
on a (first or second) moth-eye layer-free-side surface of the<br>
base film. The adhesive paste (adhesive) is used for attaching<br>
the optical film of the present Embodiment to the interior of<br>
the tank easily, and preferably has transparency and water<br>
resistance. Specifically, the adhesive paste can be disposed<br>
by coating an acrylic adhesive and the like on a single surface<br>
of the base film by a publicly known method, and the thickness<br>
of the paste can be appropriately determined. According to the<br>
embodiment (1) , the optical film of the present Embodiment may<br>
further include an easy-peelable laminate film on the adhesive<br>
paste.<br>
[0075]<br>
The embodiment (2) excludes use of the members such as<br>
the base film and the adhesive paste, which permits a reduction<br>
in cost of the liquid tank of the present Embodiment. Neither<br>
reflection nor reduction in light transmittance caused by the<br>
 <br>
base film and the adhesive paste occur, resulting in further<br>
improvement in visibility of the liquid tank. The embodiment<br>
(2) can be achieved by, for example, coating a UV-curable or<br>
thermocurable resin directly on a transparent wall and then<br>
transferring moth-eye structures of a soft mold to the resin<br>
coating by the above nanoimprint.<br>
[0076]<br>
It is preferable that the protective layer has a refractive<br>
index substantially equivalent to that of a liquid (content<br>
liquid) to be stored in the tank. According to this, the effects<br>
of the present Embodiment can be more surely exhibited. More<br>
specifically, the difference in refractive index between the<br>
protective layer and the content liquid is 0 . 05 (more preferably<br>
0.03) or smaller. In this case, the reflection on the interface<br>
between the protective layer and the content liquid can be hardly<br>
recognized. The refractive index of the protective layer is<br>
preferably within a range of the refractive index of the content<br>
liquid ±0.05 (more preferably ± 0.03).<br>
[0077]<br>
It is preferable that the protective layer has a refractive<br>
index substantially equivalent to that of water. According to<br>
this, the liquid tank of the present Embodiment can be preferably<br>
used as a tank for storing water, i.e., as a water tank. More<br>
specifically, the difference in refraetive index between the<br>
protective layer and water is 0.05 (more preferably 0.03) or<br>
smaller. In this case, the reflection on the interface between<br>
the protective layer and the water can be hardly recognized.<br>
[0078]<br>
The refractive index of water is about 1.33, and so it<br>
is preferable that the protective layer has a refractive index<br>
of 1. 2 8 to 1. 38 (more preferably 1. 3 to 1. 36) in view of suitably<br>
using the liquid tank of the present invention as a water tank.<br>
[0079]<br>
According to the present Embodiment, the transparent<br>
members having a refractive index of about 1.5 such as a glass<br>
 <br>
or transparent resin material can be preferably used as a material<br>
for the transparent wall. Further, transparent members having<br>
a refractive index of about 1.5 such as a transparent resin<br>
material can be suitably used as a material for the first moth-eye<br>
layer. These transparent members each have a refractive index<br>
higher than that of the content liquid (e.g., 1.33 of water<br>
refractive index), generally. With a view to form the<br>
transparent wall and the first moth-eye layer by the respective<br>
optimum materials and to easily make the refractive index of<br>
the content liquid substantially equivalent to that of the<br>
protective layer, it is preferable that the protective layer<br>
has a refractive index smaller than that each of the transparent<br>
wall and the moth-eye layer.<br>
[0080]<br>
The other optical characteristics of the protective layer<br>
are not especially limited. The optical film is preferably<br>
transparent to such a degree that an observer can recognize the<br>
contents of the liquid tank. More specif ically, it is preferable<br>
that: the light transmittance is 90% (more preferably 95%) or<br>
higher; and the haze is preferably 10% (more preferably 1%) or<br>
lower.<br>
[0081]<br>
It is preferable the protective layer contains a<br>
fluorine-containing resin. According to this, the protective<br>
layer can more surely protect the moth-eye structure, which is<br>
commonly poor in durability, and as a result, the durability<br>
of the liquid tank of Embodiment 1 can be more improved. Since<br>
the refractive index of the fluorine-containing resin is<br>
generally about 1. 3 to 1. 4, the refractive index of the protective<br>
layer containing a fluorine-containing resin can be easily made<br>
substantially equal to that of water. That is, according to<br>
this, the liquid tank of the present Embodiment can be preferably<br>
used as a water tank. The protective layer can be formed by<br>
coating a material for the protective layer on the first moth-eye<br>
layer by a common coating method (including, spray, spin coating,<br>
 <br>
die coating, slit coating, and the like) , and drying the coating<br>
if necessary.<br>
[0082]<br>
The fluorine-containing resin is a resin including a<br>
carbon-fluorine bond, and the resin itself has water repellency.<br>
CYTOP CTX BGSAby ASAHI Glass Co. , Ltd. , is mentioned as a specific<br>
example of the fluorine-containing resin. The thickness of the<br>
protective layer is generally, but not limited to, about 1 urn<br>
to 5 µm.<br>
[0083]<br>
The adhesion of the protective layer possibly deteriorates<br>
when a resin material (a polymer material) is used for the first<br>
moth-eye layer and a fluorine-containing resin material<br>
(fluorine resin material) is coated on the first moth-eye layer<br>
as a material for the protective layer. In view of this, it<br>
is preferable that prior to the coating of the protective layer<br>
material, the first moth-eye layer surface is treated with a<br>
primer.<br>
[0084]<br>
The flatness of the protective layer surface is not<br>
especially limited as long as it is more flat than the moth-eye<br>
structure of the first moth-eye layer. It is preferable that<br>
the protective layer surface is flat to such a degree that stains<br>
on the surface can be removed by a common washing way (e.g.,<br>
wiping or rubbing) with a common tool (e.g., cloth or brush).<br>
There is no problem in that the protective layer surface has<br>
a flatness that is allowed when the protective layer is composed<br>
of a resin material by a common coating method such as spraying,<br>
spin coating, die coating, and slit coating.<br>
[0085]<br>
The transparent wall is transparent to such a degree that<br>
an observer can view the under-liquid objects therethrough, and<br>
can be composed of a material commonly used in typical water<br>
tanks or viewing windows. More specifically, it is preferable<br>
that the transparent wall has a light transmittance of 90% (more<br>
 <br>
preferably 95%) or higher and a haze of 10% (more preferably<br>
1%) or lower. The refractive index of the transparent wall is<br>
preferably, but not limited to, substantially equivalent to that<br>
of the base film of the moth-eye layer or the resin constituting<br>
the moth-eye structure. According to this, the effects of the<br>
present Embodiment can be sufficiently exhibited.<br>
[0086]<br>
Examples of the material for the transparent wall include,<br>
but not limited to, various glass materials and transparent resin<br>
(e.g., acrylic resin) materials. Such materials include those<br>
generally used for water tanks or viewing windows.<br>
[0037]<br>
The transparent wall constitutes the entire or part of<br>
the liquid tank of the present Embodiment. Specifically, the<br>
transparent wall may be a transparent window.<br>
[0088]<br>
As long as the liquid tank is a container (appreciation<br>
or observation container) the interior of which is viewed from<br>
the outside, the application thereof is not especially limited.<br>
Particularly preferable are aquarium tanks in which fishes are<br>
raised and bred and tanks having as a liquid volume meter a window<br>
(viewing window) through which the content is viewed.<br>
[0089]<br>
The liquid (the content liquid) stored in the tank is in<br>
contact with at least part of the protective layer, preferably.<br>
The kind and refractive index of the content liquid can be<br>
appropriately determined according to the application of the<br>
tank and are not especially limited. Preferably, the content<br>
liquid is water. The content of the tank is not especially<br>
limited to liquid materials and include underwater life such<br>
as fishes and microorganism, and ornamentals.<br>
[0090]<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
The viewing device for under-liquid observation of<br>
Embodiment 2 includes a transparent window, and on the external<br>
 <br>
surface of the window, a first moth-eye layer having a moth-eye<br>
structure and a protective layer covering the moth-eye structure<br>
are disposed in this order from the window side.<br>
[0091]<br>
The external surface of the transparent window means a<br>
surface on the side opposite to the observer side.<br>
[0092]<br>
Thus, in Embodiment 2, the first moth-eye layer and the<br>
protective layer mentioned in Embodiment 1 are applied to a<br>
viewing device for under-liquid observation. Embodiment 2 is<br>
mentioned below mainly with reference to embodiments and effects<br>
different from those in Embodiment 1, and the same contents are<br>
omitted.<br>
[0093]<br>
The viewing device of the present Embodiment is used with<br>
at least the transparent window being in contact with liquid.<br>
Through this transparent window, the observer views under-liquid<br>
objects.<br>
[0094]<br>
The viewing device of the present Embodiment includes the<br>
first moth-eye layer having a moth-eye structure, so that the<br>
reflection on the interface between the first moth-eye layer<br>
and the protective layer can be markedly decreased (e.g., a<br>
reflectance of 0.1 % or lower) . The transparent window and the<br>
liquid in contact with the viewing device (transparent window)<br>
(hereinafter, also referred to simply "liquid") are usually<br>
different in refractive index. The material for the first<br>
moth-eye layer can be appropriately selected from those having<br>
a refractive index equivalent to that of the transparent window.<br>
The material for the protective layer can be appropriately<br>
selected from those having a refractive index substantially<br>
equivalent to that of the liquid. Specifically, the first<br>
moth-eye layer ensures the refractive index compatibility with<br>
the transparent window, and the protective layer ensures that<br>
with the liquid. As a result, the refractive index can be<br>
 <br>
continuously changed from the liquid to the transparent wall,<br>
so that reflection of ambient light on the external surface of<br>
the window can be markedly decreased (e.g., a reflectance of<br>
.<br>
[0095]<br>
For the same reasons as in Embodiment 1 the viewing device<br>
of Embodiment 2 can exhibit the following effects:<br>
[0096]<br>
coloring can be almost completely suppressed;<br>
[0097]<br>
the durability of the external surface of the transparent<br>
window can be improved; and<br>
[0098]<br>
adhesion of stains to the moth-eye structure can be<br>
prevented. Moreover, the shape of the liquid-contacting<br>
portion (surface) of the protective layer is not especially<br>
limited, so that it can be made more flat than the moth-eye<br>
structure. Therefore, even when adhered to the protective layer,<br>
the stains can be readily removed therefrom.<br>
[0099]<br>
Further, it is possible to produce the liquid tank<br>
dramatically inexpensively in comparison to the case where other<br>
anti-reflection films such as a multi-layer film (multi-layer<br>
anti-reflection film) are used.<br>
[0100]<br>
It is preferable that the viewing device includes, on the<br>
internal surface of the transparent window, a second moth-eye<br>
layer having a moth-eye structure, and the second moth-eye layer<br>
is disposed in a region facing the first moth-eye layer.<br>
[0101]<br>
The internal surface of the transparent window means a<br>
surface on the observer side.<br>
[0102]<br>
This second moth-eye layer allows markedly reducing<br>
reflection of ambient light on the window internal surface (e.g.,<br>
 <br>
a reflectance of 0.1% or less). As a result of this, the<br>
reflection on the region where the first and second moth-eye<br>
layers overlap with each other can be further decreased. The<br>
first and second moth-eye layers are disposed so as to overlap<br>
with each other in the viewing direction. Between the first<br>
and second moth-eye layers, the shape, size, and location thereof<br>
may be the same or different but preferably the same,<br>
[0103]<br>
The location of the first and second moth-eye layers and<br>
the protective layer is not especially limited as long as they<br>
can be viewed from an observer. The first and second moth-eye<br>
layers and the protective layer may be formed over the entire<br>
or part of the transparent window, but preferably at least on<br>
a portion through which the user views the observation objects.<br>
It is preferable that the first and second moth-eye layers and<br>
the protective layer are disposed over the entire (surface) of<br>
the transparent window in order to improve the visibility in<br>
a range as wide as possible.<br>
[0104]<br>
The materials for the first and second moth-eye layers<br>
are not especially limited. It is preferable that the refractive<br>
index of each of the first and second moth-eye layers is<br>
substantially equivalent to that of the transparent window.<br>
More specifically, the difference in refractive index between<br>
the transparent wall and the first and second moth-eye layers<br>
is preferably 0.05 (more preferably 0.03) or smaller, and in<br>
this case, the reflection on the both interfaces can be hardly<br>
recognized.<br>
[0105]<br>
The other optical characteristics of the first and second<br>
moth-eye layers are not especially limited and may be the same<br>
as those of common moth-eye films. The first and second moth-eye<br>
layers are preferably transparent to such a degree that the user<br>
can view the observation objects. More specifically, it is<br>
preferable that: the light transmittance is 90% (more preferably<br>
 <br>
95%) or higher; the haze is preferably 10% (more preferably 1%)<br>
or lower; the refractive index is 1.45 to 1.55 (more preferably<br>
1.47 to 1.53) .<br>
[0106]<br>
Each of the first and second moth-eye layers may be (1)<br>
formed on the transparent window with a base film therebetween<br>
or may be (2) directly formed en the transparent window, from<br>
the same viewpoint as in Embodiment 1.<br>
[0107]<br>
Another Embodiment of the present invention provides such<br>
an optical film. The present Embodiment provides an optical<br>
film attached to the external surface of the viewing device of<br>
Embodiment 2, i.e., the viewing device having a transparent<br>
window, the optical film including a moth-eye layer having a<br>
moth-eye structure (the above-mentioned first moth-eye layer)<br>
and a protective layer covering the moth-eye structure (the<br>
moth-eye structure of the above-mentioned first moth-eye layer) .<br>
[0108]<br>
The base film is preferably transparent to such a degree<br>
that the user can view the under-liquid objects. More<br>
specifically, it is preferable that the base film has a light<br>
transmittance of 90% (more preferably 95%) or higher, a haze<br>
of 10% (more preferably 1%) or lower, and a refractive index<br>
of 1.45 to 1.55 (more preferably 1.47 to 1.53).<br>
[0109]<br>
The optical film of the present Embodiment is preferably<br>
a transparent film with transparency, waterproof property, and<br>
resistances to water and solvent (liquid). The optical<br>
characteristics of the entire optical film of the present<br>
Embodiment are not especially limited. The optical film is<br>
preferably transparent to such a degree that the user can view<br>
the under-liquid objects. More specifically, it is preferable<br>
that the optical film has a light transmittance of 90% (more<br>
preferably 95%) or higher and a haze of 10% (more preferably<br>
1%) or lower.<br>
 <br>
[0110]<br>
According to the embodiment (1), it is preferable that<br>
the optical film of the present Embodiment has an adhesive paste<br>
on a (first cr second) moth-eye layer-free-side surface of the<br>
base film, from the same viewpoint as in Embodiment 1. The<br>
adhesive paste (adhesive) is used for attaching the optical film<br>
of the present Embodiment to the viewing device readily, and<br>
preferably has transparency and water resistance.<br>
[0111]<br>
It is that the protective layer has a refractive index<br>
substantially equivalent to that of a liquid to be in contact<br>
with the device. According to this, the effects of the present<br>
Embodiment can be more surely exhibited. More specifically,<br>
the difference in refractive index between the protective layer<br>
and the liquid is 0.05 (more preferably 0.03) or smaller. In<br>
this case, the reflection on the interface between the protective<br>
layer and the liquid can be hardly recognized. The refractive<br>
index of the protective layer is preferably within a range of<br>
the refractive index of liquid to be in contact with the viewing<br>
device + 0.05 (more preferably ± 0.03).<br>
[0112]<br>
The protective layer has a refractive index substantially<br>
equivalent to that of water. According to this, the viewing<br>
device of the present Embodiment can be preferably used as a<br>
device for observing underwater objects, i.e., a device for<br>
underwater observation. More specifically, the difference in<br>
refractive index between the protective layer and water is 0.05<br>
(more preferably 0. 03) or smaller. In this case, the reflection<br>
on the interface between the protective layer and the water can<br>
be hardly recognized.<br>
[0113]<br>
The refractive index of water is about 1.33, and so it<br>
is preferable that the protective layer has a refractive index<br>
of 1.2 8 to 1.38 (more preferably 1. 3 to 1.36) in view of suitably<br>
using the viewing device of the present Embodiment as a device<br>
 <br>
for underwater observation.<br>
[0114]<br>
According to the present Embodiment, the transparent<br>
members having a refractive index of about 1.5 such as a glass<br>
or transparent resin material can be preferably used as a material<br>
for the transparent window. Further, transparent members<br>
having a refractive index of about 1.5 such as a transparent<br>
resin material can be suitably used for the first moth-eye layer.<br>
These transparent members each have a refractive index larger<br>
than that of the liquid (e.g., 1.33 of water refractive index) ,<br>
generally. With a view to form the transparent window and the<br>
first moth-eye layer by the respective optimum materials and<br>
to easily make the refractive index of the content liquid<br>
equivalent to that of the protective layer, it is preferable<br>
that the protective layer has a refractive index smaller than<br>
that of each of the transparent window and the first moth-eye<br>
layer (transparent window).<br>
[0115]<br>
The other optical characteristics of the protective layer<br>
is not especially limited. The protective layer is preferably<br>
transparent to such a degree that the user can view the<br>
under-liquid objects. More specifically, it is preferable<br>
that: the light transmittance is 90% (more preferably 95%) or<br>
higher; and the haze is preferably 10% (more preferably 1%) or<br>
lower.<br>
[0116]<br>
It is preferable the protective layer contains a<br>
fluorine-containing resin. According to this, the protective<br>
layer can more surely protect the moth-eye structure, which is<br>
commonly poor in durability, and as a result, the durability<br>
of the viewing device of Embodiment 2 can be more improved. Since<br>
the refractive index of the fluorine-containing resin is<br>
generally about 1. 3 to 1. 4, the refractive index of the protective<br>
layer containing a fluorine-containing resin can be easily made<br>
equal to that of water. That is, according to this, the viewing<br>
 <br>
device of the present Embodiment can be preferably used as a<br>
device for underwater observation.<br>
[0117]<br>
The transparent window is transparent to such a degree<br>
that the user can view the under-liquid objects therethrough,<br>
and can be formed of a lens or a transparent plate commonly used<br>
in typical goggles or aquascopes. More specifically, it is<br>
preferable that the transparent window has a light transmittance<br>
of 90% (more preferably 95%) or higher and a haze of 10% (more<br>
preferably 1%) or lower. The refractive index of the transparent<br>
window is preferably, but net limited to, substantially<br>
equivalent to that of the base film of the moth-eye layer or<br>
the resin constituting the moth-eye structure. According to<br>
this, the effects of the present Embodiment can be sufficiently<br>
exhibited.<br>
[0118]<br>
Examples of the material for the transparent window include,<br>
but not limited to, various glass materials and transparent resin<br>
(e.g., acrylic resin) materials. Such materials include those<br>
generally used for goggles or aquascopes.<br>
[0119]<br>
The transparent window constitutes the entire or part of<br>
the viewing device of the present Embodiment.<br>
[0120]<br>
As long as the user can view the under-liquid objects<br>
through the transparent window of the viewing device, the<br>
application of the device is not especially limited.<br>
Particularly preferable are a device for observing under-liquid<br>
objects from above the liquid level and a goggle. The former<br>
device preferably includes aquascopes. In the former device,<br>
the transparent window may be a transparent plate, and in the<br>
latter one, the transparent window may be a transparent lens.<br>
The viewing device may be a window or wall for underwater<br>
observation with which ships, in-water facilities, and the like<br>
are provided.<br>
 <br>
[0121]<br>
The kind and refractive index of the liquid are not<br>
especially limited andmay be appropriately determined according<br>
to applications of the viewing device. Water, seawater,<br>
solvents, and the like are mentioned.<br>
[0122]<br>
Example 1<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic view showing a liquid tank of Example<br>
1. Fig. 1(a) is an overall cross-sectional view of the tank.<br>
Fig. 1(b) is an enlarged view of a region (side surf ace) surrounded<br>
by the broken line of Fig. 1(a) . Fig. 2 is a cross-sectional<br>
view schematically showing a moth-eye layer of the liquid tank<br>
of Example 1. Fig. 3 is a cross-sectional view schematically<br>
showing the moth-eye layer and a protective layer in the liquid<br>
tank of Example 1.<br>
The present Example relates to an embodiment in which the<br>
liquid tank of the present invention is used as a water tank.<br>
The water tank of the present Example has a multi-layer structure,<br>
as shown in Fig. 1, composed of: a transparent wall 11 constituting<br>
a container storing a content liquid, or water 21; a moth-eye<br>
layer (moth-eye film) 12 attached to the external surface<br>
(hereinafter, also referred to as an "A surface") of the<br>
transparent wall 11, which faces an observer 23; a moth-eye layer<br>
(moth-eye film) 13 attached to the internal surface (hereinafter,<br>
also referred to as a "B surface") of the wall 11; and a protective<br>
layer 14 coating the moth-eye layer 13. The transparent wall<br>
11	is composed of a transparent glass plate. The moth-eye layer<br>
12	has a moth-eye structure. The moth-eye layer 13 has a moth-eye<br>
structure and faces the moth-eye layer 12 . The protective layer<br>
14 is composed of a fluorine-containing resin (fluorine resin) .<br>
The transparent wall 11 has a refractive index of about 1.5.<br>
The protective layer 14 has a refractive index of 1.28 to 1.38.<br>
The water 21 has a refractive index of 1.33.<br>
[0123]<br>
The moth-eye layer 12 can prevent a mismatch in refractive<br>
 <br>
index between air outside the water tank (refractive index of<br>
1) and the transparent wall 11. Also on the internal side of<br>
the wall 11, the refractive index matching between the water<br>
21 and the transparent wall 11 can be achieved. As a result,<br>
the observer 23 feels as if no wail of the water tank exists<br>
and experiences a feeling of being inside the tank. Further,<br>
when the water tank is photographed from the outside by strobe<br>
photography, the strobe light is not reflected on the refractive<br>
index interface. This can obviate the need of moving the camera<br>
close to the tank. Thus, the matching in refractive index can<br>
be achieved well when the moth-eye structure is formed on the<br>
B surface. On the other hand, the moth-eye structure has a<br>
surface very excellent in biocompatibility, so that underwater<br>
life easily adhere to the surface or stains on the surface are<br>
difficult to remove. This problem can be solved by coating a<br>
material whose refractive index is almost equivalent to that<br>
of the water 21 on the B surface of the moth-eye layer 13. As<br>
a result, the refractive index matching between the water 21<br>
and the transparent glass wall 11 is achieved, and adhesion of<br>
stains including underwater life can be minimized. Even if once<br>
adhered to the wall 11, the stains can be easily removed therefrom<br>
with a commercially available cloth and the like. Moreover,<br>
the fluorine-containing resin layer protects the surface of the<br>
moth-eye layer 13 (the moth-eye structure), which is poor in<br>
durability, whereby the water tank can be used as a durable<br>
aquarium or observation tank. Since the refractive index of<br>
the fluorine-containing resin is generally about 1.3 to 1.4,<br>
the refractive index of the protective layer 14 containing a<br>
fluorine-containing resin can be easily made substantially equal<br>
to that of the water 21.<br>
[0124]<br>
The moth-eye structure 16, with which the moth-eye layers<br>
12 and 13 are provided, has protrusions. It is preferable that<br>
the protrusions are formed with a pitch of 50 nm to 300 nm and<br>
a height of 50 nm to 300 nm. The moth-eye layers 12 and 13 are<br>
 <br>
each made of a material whose refractive index is substantially<br>
equivalent to that of the material for the transparent wall 11<br>
of a glass or resin material.<br>
[0125]<br>
In the present Example, CYTOP CTX809A (produced by ASAHI<br>
Glass Co., LLd.) is used as the fluorine-containing resin<br>
material (fluorine coating material) for the protective layer<br>
14. This resin is coated on the moth-eye layer 13 to form a<br>
layer with 0.5 um in thickness. CYTOP CTX809A has a refractive<br>
index of 1.34, which is almost equivalent to that of water, or<br>
1.33. Although in the single use of the moth-eye layer 13 the<br>
stains still easily adhere to the internal wall of the tank,<br>
the fluorine resin coating on the internal wall of the tank<br>
suppresses the stain adhesion and makes it easier to remove the<br>
stains from the wall. The adhesion between the moth-eye layer<br>
13 and the protective layer 14 might be insufficient when the<br>
moth-eye layer 13 is composed of a polymer material and thereon<br>
the fluorine-resin coating is formed. In view of this, it is<br>
preferable that the moth-eye layer 13 surface is treated with<br>
a primer prior to the formation of the fluorine-resin coating.<br>
In this Example, a primer (CT-P10, by ASAHI Glass Co., Ltd.)<br>
exclusively for CYTOP CTX809A can be used.<br>
[0126]<br>
Between the transparent wall 11 and each of the moth-eye<br>
layers 12 and 13, there are provided a base film 15 and an adhesive<br>
paste 17 disposed on the transparent wall 11-side main surface<br>
of the base film 15 as illustrated in Fig. 2. Thus each of the<br>
moth-eye layers 12 and 13 is formed by subjecting to<br>
nanoimprinting a film of a UV-curable resin and the like formed<br>
on the base film 15 and then attached to the transparent wall<br>
11 with the adhesive paste 17. The moth-eye structure 16 of<br>
the layer 13 is coated with the protective layer 14 of a<br>
fluorine-containing resin (fluorine resin) as illustrated in<br>
Fig. 3. As mentioned above, attached is an optical film (film<br>
for the tank internal surface) composed of the protective layer<br>
 <br>
14, the moth-eye layer 13, the base film 15, and the adhesive<br>
paste 17 to the internal surface of the transparent wall 11;<br>
and to the external surface thereof, an optical film (film for<br>
the tank external surface) composed of the moth-eye layer 12,<br>
the base film 15, and the adhesive paste 17 is attached. When<br>
a moth-eye layer is disposed on the B surface side, the moth-eye<br>
layer 13, which is located on the internal side of the tank,<br>
preferably includes a material with excellent solvent resistance<br>
because it is under the presence of a solvent (solution) such<br>
as water. The base film 15 preferably is a film with transparency,<br>
water resistance, and solvent (liquid) resistance.<br>
Specifically, olefin films, including the above-mentioned<br>
commercially available ones, are suitably used. The refractive<br>
index of the base film 15 is preferably designed to be<br>
substantially equivalent to that of the transparent wall 11.<br>
[0127]<br>
Fig. 4 is an explanation view of refractive index change<br>
in the liquid tank of Example 1. Fig. 4(a) is a side<br>
cross-sectional view of the tank. Fig. 4 (b) is a graph showing<br>
refractive index change on a side surface of the tank. In the<br>
tank of the present Example, as shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b),<br>
the moth-eye layers 12 and 13 are disposed at a portion facing<br>
the observer of the A and B surfaces of the transparent wall<br>
11 respectively whereby the refractive index matching can be<br>
ensured with the solution (the water 21) being charged in the<br>
tank. Particularly the refractive index matching on the B<br>
surface side is achieved using a fluorine-containing material<br>
with a low refractive index for the protective layer 14. Thus,<br>
the protective layer 14 can be coated successfully while a<br>
mismatch of the refractive index on the interface between the<br>
water and the resin layer is minimized. Further, the treatment<br>
for the refractive index matching with the solution (the water<br>
21) and the moth-eye structure enable the refractive index to<br>
continuously change from air 22 (the refractive index is 1) to<br>
the water 21 (the refractive index is 1.33), and as a result,<br>
 <br>
the portion facing the observer of the wall 11 behaves as if<br>
no interface existed. Reflected light on this portion have a<br>
very flat wavelength dispersion characteristic and is less<br>
colored. Thus the coloring hardly occurs because the moth-eye<br>
structure requires no A/4 conditions unlike the multi-layer film<br>
and because the refractive index continuously changes from the<br>
surface of the moth-eye structure to the inside thereof. The<br>
reflectance on the moth-eye structure surface can be extremely<br>
decreased because the light does not recognize the moth-eye<br>
structure surface as a refractive index interface. Moreover,<br>
the fluorine-containing resin layer (with a refractive index<br>
substantially equivalent to that of the solvent (e.g., 1.33 when<br>
the solvent is water) ) is disposed on the B surface, which can<br>
ease the poor resistance to stains such as underwater life and<br>
the difficulty in removal of the stains of the nanostructure<br>
(nanometer-sized protrusions) of the moth-eye structure and<br>
which can dramatically increase the durability of the B surface.<br>
[0128]<br>
Example 2<br>
Fig. 5 is a schematic view showing the liquid tank of Example<br>
2. Fig. 5(a) is an overall cross-sectional view of the tank.<br>
Fig. 5(b) is an enlarged view of a region (side surface) surrounded<br>
by the broken line of Fig. 5(a).<br>
The present Example employs exactly the principle of<br>
Example 1, but the films for the tank internal surface and for<br>
the tank external surface are each disposed on part of the tank<br>
by patterning. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 5, the moth-eye<br>
layer 12 on the A surface, and the moth-eye layer 13 and the<br>
protective layer 14 on the B surface, each of which is disposed<br>
on the transparent wall 11 with the base film and the adhesive<br>
paste therebetween, are patterned into the same planar shape.<br>
As a result, the observer 23 feels as if no transparent wall<br>
11 existed at the pattern portion and he could enter the tank.<br>
Thus the display effects like this can be obtained.<br>
[0129]<br>
 <br>
The pattern shape includes, but not limited to, a circular<br>
or square shape in consideration of the viewing window shape.<br>
Alternatively, thelayers arepatternedtoexpress some character<br>
or logo for advertisement, for example. When the layers are<br>
patterned to express some character, it looks as if no interface<br>
exists on the layer-provided portion, but therearound, light<br>
reflection occurs. This difference between the two portions<br>
brings higher display effects.<br>
[0130]<br>
Example 3<br>
Fig. 6 is a perspective view schematically showing a liquid<br>
tank of Example 3. Fig. 7 is an explanation view of refractive<br>
index change in the liquid tank of Example 3. Fig. 7(a) is a<br>
cross-sectional view of a liquid volume meter portion of the<br>
liquidtank. Fig. 7(b) is a graph showing refractive index change<br>
in the liquid volume meter portion.<br>
In the present Example, the liquid tank of the present<br>
invention is applied to a tank equipped with a viewing window<br>
as a liquid volume meter through which the liquid level can be<br>
determined. A liquid volume meter 18 is disposed at part of<br>
the tank, as shown in Fig. 6. The films for tank internal and<br>
external surfaces are each attached to the liquid volume meter<br>
portion, similarly to Example 1. More specif ically, the liquid<br>
volume meter portion of the tank of the present Example has a<br>
multi-layer structure composed of: a transparent wall 11; a<br>
moth-eye layer 12 attached to the external surface (A surface)<br>
of the transparent wall 11 and having a moth-eye structure; a<br>
moth-eye layer 13 attached to the internal surface (B surface)<br>
of the wall 11 and disposed in a region facing the moth-eye layer<br>
12; and the protective layer 14 coating the moth-eye layer 13<br>
and composed of a fluorine-containing resin (fluorine resin).<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates that the level of the content liquid (the<br>
water 21) reaches a certain level of the liquid volume meter<br>

The B surface allows refractive index matching below the<br>
liquid level (the water 21 level) , but does not allow it thereabove,<br>
i.e. , at the portion exposing to air 22, as shown in Fig. 7 (b) .<br>
Specifically, the reflection is suppressed in the region below<br>
the liquid level where the refractive index is matched, and on<br>
the other hand, the reflection occurs in the region thereabove<br>
where the refractive index is mismatched. This difference in<br>
occurrence of the reflection makes it easy to determine the height<br>
of the liquid level. The A surface is also provided with the<br>
moth-eye structure, so that the external-surface reflection can<br>
be almost completely prevented and as a result, the liquid level<br>
height can be more easily determined.<br>
[0132]<br>
When the protective layer 14 is not disposed on the moth-eye<br>
layer 13, the moth-eye structure is directly exposed to air above<br>
the liquid level. This region also continuously changes the<br>
refractive index to diminish the reflected light. As a result,<br>
the internal-surface reflection is suppressed both above and<br>
below the liquid level, and the interface between the liquid<br>
and air becomes unclear. In contrast to this, when the protective<br>
layer 14 is disposed on the moth-eye layer 13, the light reflection<br>
occurs on the interface between the air 22 and the protective<br>
layer 14 above the liquid level. Thus, the liquid level can<br>
be clearly determined as mentioned above.<br>
[0133]<br>
When the liquid volume meter is not equipped with the films<br>
for tank internal and external surfaces, the mismatch of the<br>
refractive index occurs both above and below the liquid level.<br>
The degree of the mismatch is different between the two regions,<br>
resulting in a difference in reflectance therebetween. In this<br>
case, therefore, the liquid level is not so clearly viewed as<br>
in the liquid volume meter of Example 3, although barely<br>
determined.<br>
[0134]<br>
As mentioned above, in Examples 1 to 3, the matching of<br>
 <br>
refractive index on the side surface of the transparent wall<br>
of the tank can be achieved with the moth-eye structure and the<br>
resin with a low refractive index. The light reflection can<br>
be suppressed as much as possible, and thus objects (aquarium<br>
fishes, liquid level, and the like) inside the tank can be clearly<br>
observed.<br>

Example 4<br>
Fig. 11 is a cross-sectional view schematically showing<br>
a viewing device for under-liquid observation of Example 4 . Fig.<br>
12 is an explanation view of refractive index change in the viewing<br>
device of Example 4. Fig. 12(a) is a cross-sectional view of<br>
the device. Fig. 12(b) is a graph showing refractive index change<br>
in the device. Figs. 13 and 14 are cross-sectional views each<br>
schematically the device of Example 4 in accordance with a<br>
modified example.<br>
In the present Example, the viewing device of the present<br>
invention is applied to a device through which a user views<br>
under-liquid objects above the liquid level. The device of the<br>
present Example has the followingmulti-layer structure composed<br>
of: a transparent plate-like base (transparent window) 24;<br>
a moth-eye layer 12 attached to the surface exposed to air (the<br>
top) of the base 24 and having a moth-eye structure; a moth-eye<br>
layer 13 attached to the liquid (water)-side surface (the bottom)<br>
of the base 24 and disposed in a region facing the moth-eye layer<br>
12; and a protective layer 14 of a fluorine-containing resin<br>
(fluorine resin) coating the moth-eye layer 13. The base 24<br>
is made of a glass or resin material and the like, and has a<br>
refractive index of about 1.5. The device of the present Example<br>
is used with the protective layer 14 being in contact with the<br>
liquid and the moth-eye layer 12 being in contact with the<br>
atmosphere. Accordingly, it is preferable that the respective<br>
members of the present Example are made of materials with a<br>
specific gravity lower than that of the liquid.<br>
[0136]<br>
 <br>
In the present Example, the moth-eye films are attached<br>
to the respective surfaces of the base 24, and on the moth-eye<br>
film that is to be exposed to liquid, the protective layer 14<br>
of a resin with a low refractive index is disposed. When this<br>
device is floated on the surface of the liquid, as shown in Fig.<br>
12, the both surface allow the refractive index matching, and<br>
the refractive index continuously changes from air (refractive<br>
index of 1) to water 21 (refractive index of 1.33} . Thus the<br>
refractive index mismatch on the liquid surface can be solved.<br>
As a result, underwater objects can be clearly viewed from above<br>
the liquid level. Further, since this Example employs the<br>
fluorine resin as a material for the protective layer 14,<br>
similarly to Examples 1 to 3, the device can suppress from being<br>
contaminated by the liquid and can achieve the refractive index<br>
matching also on the bottom thereof.<br>
[0137]<br>
A float 25 with a lower specific gravity than that of the<br>
liquid may be disposed around the device of the present Example<br>
(for example, around the base 24), as shown in Fig. 13. This<br>
allows using materials with a higher specific gravity than that<br>
of the liquid for the members such as the base 24.<br>
[0138]<br>
The device of the present Example may be equipped with<br>
a light-shielding cylindrical member 26 as shown in Fig. 14 to<br>
be used as an aquascope. One opening of the cylindrical member<br>
26 is closed with a transparent portion such as the base 24.<br>
This can suppress incident of ambient light into the transparent<br>
portion so that observation objects can be more clearly viewed.<br>
Further, the gravity of the cylindrical member 26 can be made<br>
lower than that of the liquid, whereby materials with a specific<br>
gravity higher than that of the liquid can be used for the members<br>
such as the base 24.<br>
[0139]<br>
The application of the device of the present Example is<br>
not especially limited. The device may be used for underwater<br>
 <br>
or undersea observation, or alternatively, for viewing an<br>
indicator inside an apparatus containing a solvent or checking<br>
behavior of such an apparatus.<br>
[0140]<br>
Example 5<br>
Fig. 15 is a cross-sectional view schematically showing<br>
a viewing device for under-liquid observation of Example 5. Fig.<br>
16 is an explanation view of refractive index change in the device<br>
of Example5. Fig. 16(a) is a cross-sectional view of the device.<br>
Fig. 16(b) is a graph showing refractive index change in the<br>
device.<br>
In the present Example, the viewing device of the present<br>
invention is applied to goggles. The lens part of the goggles<br>
of the present Example has the following multi-layer structure<br>
composed of a transparent base (transparent window) 27; a<br>
moth-eye layer 12 attached to the internal surface of the base<br>
27 (the user 27-side surface) and having a moth-eye structure;<br>
amoth-eye layer 13 attachedto the liquid (water 21) -side surface<br>
(the external surface) thereof and disposed in a region facing<br>
the moth-eye layer 12; and the protective layer 14 of a<br>
fluorine-containing resin (fluorine resin) coating the moth-eye<br>
layer 13. The base 27 is composed of a glass or resin material,<br>
and the like, and has a refractive index of about 1. 5. The goggles<br>
of the present Example are used with the protective layer 14<br>
being in contact with the liquid and the moth-eye layer 12 being<br>
with air.<br>
[0141]<br>
In the present Example, the moth-eye films are attached<br>
to the respective surfaces of the base 27, and on the moth-eye<br>
film that is to be exposed to liquid, the protective layer 14<br>
of a resin with a low refractive index is disposed. In underwater<br>
observation by means of the goggles of the present Example, as<br>
shown in Fig. 16, the both surface can achieve the matching of<br>
the refractive index, and the refractive index can be<br>
continuously changed from the water 21 (the refractive index<br>
 <br>
is 1.33) to air (the refractive index of 1), finally to just<br>
in front of user's (observer's) eyes. The user can view objects<br>
present in the water naturally and clearly like fishes do.<br>
[0142]<br>
The moth-eye layer 12 surface may be provided with a<br>
water-shedding treatment to such a degree that the moth-eye<br>
structure does not completely lose its undulated pattern,<br>
although the above effects can be exhibited without the treatment.<br>
This allows easy removal of water from the lens inner surface.<br>
[0143]<br>
The moth-eye layer 12 surface may be provided with<br>
hydrophilicity. In this case, even when water enters the inside<br>
of the lens part and comes in contact with the moth-eye layer<br>
12, the water can be spread over the layer 12 surface to form<br>
a water film thereon. Thus, fogging of the goggles can be<br>
suppressed.<br>
[0144]<br>
The goggles of the present Example may be those for athletic<br>
use, hobby use, or fishing industries, and the application<br>
thereof is not especially limited.<br>
[0145]<br>
Also in Examples 4 and 5, a base film and an adhesive paste<br>
are disposed in this order on the base 24 or 27-side main surface<br>
of each of the moth-eye layers 12 and 13, similarly to Examples<br>
1 to 3. Thus, the optical film composed of the protective layer<br>
14, the moth-eye layer 13, the base film, and the adhesive paste<br>
is attached to the bottom of the base 24 or the external surface<br>
of the base 27, and on the top of the base 24 or the internal<br>
surface of the base 27, the optical film composed of the moth-eye<br>
layer 12, the base film, and the adhesive paste is attached.<br>
[0146]<br>
