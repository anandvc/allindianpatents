				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to female terminal fitting.<br>
Generally, a female terminal fitting has a shape narrow and long in forward and backward directions and includes a tubular portion, into which a mating male tab is insertable, at its front part and a barrel portion to be connected with an end of a wire at its rear part. In a female terminal fitting disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2006-12741, a contact piece in the form of a leaf spring and separate from the tubular portion is inserted in the tubular portion. The contact piece includes a contact main body curved substantially in U-shape, and has a contact portion with a male tab on the top of a convex surface of this contact main body. The male tab inserted into the tubular portion is electrically connected with the female terminal fitting while being resiliently sandwiched between the contact portion of the contact piece and a receiving pad provided in the tubular portion. The contact piece further includes a holding portion integrally connected to the opposite widthwise end edges of the contact main body, and engaging pieces projecting outward from the opposite widthwise sides of the holding portion. The engaging pieces are engaged and supported in engaging holes penetrating the opposite side walls of the tubular portion. In this way, the contact piece is held in the tubular portion.<br>
Since the male tab and the contact portion are only held in point or line contact, if the wire connected with the female terminal fitting is shaken, the tubular portion shakes following a shaking movement of the wire and, accordingly, the male tab inserted in the tubular portion shakes about the center of axis thereof and, eventually, undergoes a rolling movement in the tubular portion in some cases. As a result, there is a possibility of impairing the contact reliability of the male tab and the female terminal fitting.<br>
The present invention was developed in view of the above situation and an object thereof is to prevent the contact reliability of a male tab and a female terminal fitting from being impaired.<br>
This object is solved according to the invention by the features of the independent claim 1. Preferred embodiments of the invention are subject of the dependent claims.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a female terminal fitting, comprising:<br>
a tubular portion into which a male tab is at least partly insertable through a tab insertion opening formed at one end, and<br>
a contact piece arranged at least partly inside the tubular portion and adapted to sandwich the male tab together with one or more receiving pads provided in the tubular portion,<br>
wherein the contact piece includes:<br>
a resiliently deformable contact main body that is curved in thickness direction in such a manner as to come closer to the receiving pads and can resiliently come into contact with a widthwise intermediate part of the male tab at a contact position of the convex surface of this curve, and<br>
one or more shake preventing portions formed along an inserting direction of the male tab at the lateral side(s) of the contact main body and adapted to prevent the male tab from shaking about the center of axis thereof by coming into contact with the widthwise end(s) of the male tab.<br>
When the male tab is inserted to a substantially proper depth in the tubular portion, the widthwise intermediate part of the male tab resiliency touches the contact main body of the contact piece at the contact position, whereas the widthwise end(s) of the male tab can come into contact with the one or more shake preventing portions of the contact piece substantially along the inserting direction of the male tab. Even if a wire connected with this female terminal fitting is shaken in this state, the male tab is prevented from shaking about the center of axis thereof by the contact of the widthwise end (s) thereof with the one or more shake preventing portions, wherefore the relative position of the male tab in the tubular portion can be substantially immovably held. As a result, shaking movements or rolling movements of the male tab in the tubular portion can be suppressed, thereby improving the contact reliability of the male tab and the female terminal fitting.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, there is provided a female terminal fitting, comprising:<br>
a tubular portion into which a male tab is insertable through a tab insertion opening formed at one end, and<br>
a plate-shaped contact piece arranged inside the tubular portion and adapted to sandwich the male tab together with receiving pads provided in the tubular portion,<br>
wherein the contact piece includes:<br>
a resiliently deformable contact main body that is curved in thickness direction in such a manner as to come closer to the receiving pads and can resiliently come into contact with a widthwise middle part of the plate surface of the male tab at a contact position of the convex surface of this curve, and<br>
shake preventing portions formed along an inserting direction of the male tab at the opposite sides of the contact main body and adapted to prevent the male tab from shaking about the center of axis thereof by coming into contact with the opposite widthwise ends of the plate surface of the male tab. When the male tab is inserted to a proper depth in the tubular portion, the widthwise middle part of the plate surface of the male tab resiliently touches the contact main body of the contact piece at the contact position, whereas the opposite widthwise ends of the plate surface of the male tab can come into contact with the shake preventing portions of the contact piece along the inserting direction of the male tab. Even if a wire connected with this female terminal fitting is shaken in this state, the male tab is prevented from shaking about the center of axis thereof by the contact of the opposite widthwise ends of the plate surface thereof with the shake preventing portions, wherefore the relative position of the male tab in the tubular portion can be substantially immovably held. As a result, shaking movements or rolling movements of the male tab in the tubular portion can be suppressed, thereby improving the contact reliability of the male tab and the female terminal fitting.<br>
Preferably, the shake preventing portions are formed to substantially extend at least in an area from the tab insertion opening to the contact position.<br>
Since the shake preventing portions are formed to substantially extend at least in the area from the tab insertion opening to the contact position and<br>
arranged at positions corresponding to the contact position, the contact reliability can be further improved and shaking movements of the male tab in or about longitudinal direction (inserting direction of the male tab) can be effectively suppressed.<br>
Further preferably, the contact piece further includes one or more supporting portions standing up substantially in the thickness direction of the shake preventing portions and adapted to prevent loose movements of the contact piece in the tubular portion by the contact of the upper or outer ends thereof with the inner surface of the tubular portion.<br>
If the contact piece itself loosely moves in the tubular portion when the wire is shaken, there is a possibility that an effect of suppressing shaking movements of the male tab by the shake preventing portions cannot be sufficiently obtained. However, according to the above, the effect of suppressing shaking movements of the male tab can be securely fulfilled since the supporting portions standing up or project substantially in the thickness direction of the shake preventing portions prevent loose movements of the contact piece in the tubular portion by coming into contact with the inner surface of the tubular portion.<br>
Still further preferably, the contact piece is separate from the tubular portion, and preferably held at least partly in the tubular portion by the engagement of one or more engaging portions provided at edges of the shake preventing portions located at or near the widthwise ends of the contact piece and one or more engagement receiving portions provided at the side wall(s), preferably the substantially opposite side walls, of the tubular portion.<br>
The thickness of the contact piece can be easily set at least partly thinner than that of the tubular portion since the contact piece is separate from the tubular portion. Accordingly, even in such a situation where the thickness of the tubular portion needs to be increased in order to cope with thick wires for large current, smooth deformations of the contact piece can be ensured by thinning the contact piece. Particularly, if the wire is thicker, a vibration force of the wire is largely transmitted to the female terminal fitting, making it more likely to impair the contact reliability with the male tab. Therefore, it is preferable to suppress shaking movements or rolling movements of the male tab by the shake preventing portions.<br>
Most preferably, the contact position is so set as to be distanced from contact surfaces of the shake preventing portions with the male tab in height direction when the contact main body is not connected with the male tab.<br>
Since the contact position of the contact main body is so set as to be distanced from the contact surfaces of the shake preventing portions with the male tab in height direction when the contact main body is not in contact or connection with the male tab, a contact pressure of the contact main body with the male tab can be set to a proper value so that the shake preventing portions normally do not strongly press the male tab, wherefore the insertion resistance of the male tab can be so set as not to be particularly large.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, one or more pressing portions are formed projecting substantially toward the base plate to prevent an excessive deformation of a contact main body of a contact piece, wherein the pressing portions are preferably formed by applying forces to areas of one or more side portions of the tubular portion between cuts made<br>
substantially in forward and backward directions to deform these areas preferably substantially into wave-like or pointed or rounded shapes.<br>
Preferably, the contact main body is wavily curved as a whole.<br>
Further preferably, the shake preventing portion comprises a hanging portion extending substantially toward the base plate by being bent at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially at a right angle from the corresponding lateral edge of the front end of the contact main body.<br>
Most preferably, the shake preventing portion further comprises a shake preventing body bulging outward substantially in transverse direction by being bent at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially at a right angle at the bottom end of the hanging portion, whereby the shake preventing portion preferably has a substantially L-shaped cross section.<br>

One preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to the accompanying drawings. This embodiment is a female terminal fitting 10 connectable with a male tab 80, and can be at least partly accommodated into an unillustrated connector housing preferably while being connected with an end of a wire. In the following description, a left side in FIG. 3 is a front side concerning forward and backward directions FBD and reference is made to FIG. 2 concerning vertical direction.<br>
The female terminal fitting 10 is made of an electrically conductive plate made preferably of metal. In order to cope with an unillustrated thick wire for large current, a relatively thick plate material is used. This female terminal fitting 10 includes a base plate 11 substantially in the form of a flat plate extending in forward and backward directions FBD, a substantially tubular portion 12 preferably bent into a substantially rectangular or polygonal tubular shape (box shape) at or near a front part of the base plate 11 while at least partly including a front part of the base plate 11, and a wire connection portion preferably comprising at least one barrel portion 13 curved from the lateral portion (preferably opposite left and/or right sides) of a rear part of the base plate 11 while at least partly including the rear part of the base plate 11. The wire connection portion is to be connected to the wire preferably by the barrel portion 13 being crimped or bent or folded into connection with the wire by<br>
being wound at least partly around a core section exposed at or near the end of the wire from the lateral (left and/or right) side(s).<br>
The female terminal fitting 10 also includes one or more reinforcing plates 14 standing up from or near the (preferably substantially opposite) lateral edge(s) of the base plate 11 in an intermediate part of the base plate 11 and preferably having the front ends thereof connected with the base plate 11 and the rear ends thereof connected with the wire connection portion (preferably the barrel portion 13). A specified (predetermined or predeterminable) rigidity is ensured in an area between the tubular portion 12 and the barrel portions 13 by the one or more reinforcing plates 14. On the other hand, the upper ends of the reinforcing plates 14 at least partly are cut off to form stress absorbing portions 15 for substantially preventing or reducing the transmission of bending stresses particularly resulting from the crimp connection with the wire by the barrel portion 13 toward the tubular portion 12. The stress absorbing portions 15 are formed by cutting or recessing the upper or distal ends of the reinforcing plates 14 at a side toward the barrel portion 13 so as to be slightly lower or to have a shorter projecting length than the upper or distal ends of the reinforcing plates 14 at a side toward the tubular portion 12, and are recesses formed in at least one, preferably in both lateral (left and right) reinforcing plates 14. By providing such stress absorbing portions 15, a deformation of the tubular portion 12 following the crimp connection with the wire can be prevented or its likelyhood reduced<br>
The front part of the base plate 11 is wide in transverse direction TD (or in a direction at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially normal to the forward and backward directions FBD), the rear part thereof is<br>
narrower than the front part, and the intermediate part thereof preferably is gradually or stepwise narrowed from the rear end of the front part toward the front end of the rear end. A (preferably substantially rectangular) locking hole 16 is formed to penetrate or recess an intermediate part (preferably a substantially middle part) of the front part of the base plate 11 in thickness direction THD as shown in FIG. 2. Further, one or more receiving pads 17 are formed at the (preferably substantially opposite) lateral (left and/or right) side(s) of the locking hole 16 in or at the front part of the base plate 11. The one or more receiving pads 17 preferably are in the form of ribs or embossings extending substantially in forward and backward directions FBD preferably substantially in parallel with each other, and caused to project into the tubular portion 12 preferably by embossing the lower outer surface of the base plate 11.<br>
As shown in FIG, 2, the tubular portion 12 is comprised of the aforementioned base plate 11, a pair of lateral (left and right) side plates 18 standing up or projecting from or near the opposite lateral edges of the front part of the base plate 11, and one or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and/or right) facing plates 19 extending inward from at least one of the upper or distal ends of the opposite side plates 18 to substantially face the base plate 11, and preferably is integrally or unitarily formed by bending. A tab insertion opening 12A into which the male tab 80 is at least partly insertable from front and which preferably has a substantially laterally longer rectangular shape is formed in the front surface of the tubular portion 12. The opposite side plates 18 preferably are bent at substantially right angles at or near the opposite lateral edges of the base plate 11, preferably wherein the inner surfaces thereof<br>
are connected substantially at substantially right angles to the inner surface of the base plate 11 and/or the outer surfaces thereof are connected to the outer surface of the base plate 11 via substantially quarter circular or rounded sections. Similarly, the opposite facing plates 19 preferably are bent at substantially right angles at the upper ends of the opposite side plates 18, wherein the inner surfaces thereof are connected substantially at right angles to the inner surfaced of the side plates 18 and/or the outer surfaces thereof are connected to the outer surfaces of the side plates 18 via substantially quarter circular or rounded sections. The substantially opposite facing plates 19 preferably are identically shaped and/or sized, and a slit 21 extending substantially in forward and backward directions FBD is defined between the facing edges thereof. Thus, the end edges of the facing plates 19 are opposed to each other substantially in parallel with the slit 21 located therebetween.<br>
Further, one or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and/or right) pressing portions 22 are formed by applying forces to areas of the facing plates 19 between cuts made substantially in forward and backward directions FBD to deform these areas preferably substantially into wave-like or pointed or rounded shapes projecting substantially toward the base plate 11. The pressing portions 22 function to prevent an excessive deformation of a contact main body 31 of a contact piece 30 to be described later. Further, the facing portions 19 are formed with one or more engaging holes or recesses 23 (corresponding to preferred engagement receiving portions) penetrating or recessing in thickness direction TD and/or extending from the facing plates 19 to the side plates 18 connected to the facing plates 19 as shown in FIGS. 1 and 3. One or more engaging pieces 36 (corresponding to preferred engaging portions) of the<br>
contact piece 30 to be described later are at least partly passed through and/or engaged with the engaging holes 23 of the tubular portion 12. It should be noted that a pair of engaging holes 23 preferably are formed in each side plate 18 of the tubular portion 12 while being spaced apart in forward and backward directions FBD, i.e. preferably a total of two pairs of engaging holes 23 are provided.<br>
The contact piece 30 preferably separate from the tubular portion 12 is arranged at a position near the facing plates 19 in the tubular portion 12. A tab insertion path 50 through which the male tab 50 is at least partly insertable is defined between the contact piece 30 and the receiving pads 17. The contact piece 30 preferably is at least partly thinner than the tubular portion 12 and includes the strip-shaped contact main body 31 extending substantially in forward and backward directions FBD and preferably substantially in the form of a leaf spring that can be resiliency brought into contact with a widthwise intermediate part (preferably a widthwise substantially middle part) of the plate surface (upper surface in the shown case) of the male tab 80 as shown in FIGS. 7 to 9, and one or more substantially non-resilient shake preventing portions 32 connected or connectable to the (preferably substantially opposite) widthwise lateral edge(s) of the contact main body 31 and adapted to prevent the male tab 80 from shaking particularly about the center of axis thereof by coming into contact with the (preferably substantially opposite) widthwise end(s) of the plate surface (upper surface in the shown case) of the male tab 80.<br>
The contact main body 31 preferably is wavily curved as a whole (when see in a direction at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially normal to the forward and backward directions FBD, see FIG. 3), an<br>
intermediate part (preferably a substantially middle part) in its extending direction is closest to the receiving pads 17 and a contact portion 33 with the male tab 80 is formed on the top of this intermediate or middle part. The convex surface or distal end portion of the contact portion 33 can be held substantially in line contact with the male tab 80 and serves as a preferred contact position. The aforementioned pressing portions 22 are arranged at a distance to and/or substantially in parallel with the opposite widthwise ends of the plate surface of the contact main body 31 when the contact main body 31 is in its natural state. When the contact piece 30 is at least partly mounted into the tubular portion 12, a clearance (tab insertion path 50) smaller than the thickness of the male tab 80 is defined between the contact position of the contact portion 33 and the receiving pads 17 before the male tab 80 is at least partly inserted, and this clearance is widened as the male tab 80 is at least partly inserted.<br>
One or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and/or right) shake preventing portions 32 are formed integrally or unitarily connected with the (preferably substantially opposite) widthwise edge(s) of the contact main body 31 and preferably is/are substantially in the form of wings as a whole. More specifically, each shake preventing portion 32 is comprised of a hanging portion 34 extending substantially toward the base plate 11 by being bent at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially at a right angle from the corresponding lateral edge of the front end of the contact main body 31 and a shake preventing body 35 bulging outward substantially in width direction or transverse direction TD by being bent at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially at a right angle at the bottom end of the hanging portion 34, thereby preferably substantially having an L-shaped cross section. The<br>
hanging portions 34 extend substantially in forward and backward directions FBD, and the opposite front and rear ends thereof preferably are substantially aligned at the same positions as the opposite front and rear ends of the contact main body 31. The hanging length of the hanging portions 34 preferably is set smaller than the depth of the curve of the contact main body 31.<br>
The shake preventing bodies 35 likewise extend substantially in forward and backward directions FBD, preferably have substantially the same length in forward and backward direction FBD as the hanging portions 34, and preferably are substantially transversely symmetrical with respect to a central axis CA of the contact piece 30 and/or of the terminal fitting 10. A distance between the projecting edges of the left and right shake preventing bodies 35 preferably is set substantially equal to or slightly smaller than the inner width of the tubular portion 12, The lower surfaces of the shake preventing bodies 35 serve as contact surfaces that can be brought substantially into surface contact with the plate surface of the male tab 80. When the contact piece 30 is at least partly mounted into the tubular portion 12, a clearance equal to or slightly larger than the thickness of the male tab 80 is defined between these contact surfaces and the inner surface of the base plate 11 (specifically the receiving pads 17). When the contact main body 31 is in its natural state, the contact surfaces of the shake preventing bodies 35 are located lower (toward the base plate 11) than the contact position of the contact main body 31 in height direction, and most part of the contact main body 31 projects from the contact position when viewed sideways.<br>
At lateral edges of the shape preventing portions 35 located at the widthwise ends of the contact piece 30, one or more, preferably a total of two<br>
pairs of lateral (left and/or right) engaging pieces 36 are formed to bulge out substantially laterally outward at positions substantially corresponding to the engaging holes 23. The engaging pieces 36 are at least partly insertable into the engaging holes 23 from the inner side, and the contact piece 30 is so held in the tubular portion 12 as not to make any loose movements by the engagement of the engaging pieces 36 and the engaging holes 23. In this way, the contact piece 30 is mounted into the tubular portion 12.<br>
The (preferably substantially opposite ends of each) shake preventing body 35 in longitudinal direction (forward and backward directions FBD) are bent up at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially at right angles substantially toward the facing plate 19, thereby forming one or more supporting portions 37 for preventing loose movements of the contact piece 30 itself in the tubular portion 12 by the contact of the upper ends thereof with the inner surfaces of the facing plates 19 when the contact piece 30 is at least partly mounted into the tubular portion 12. The supporting portions 37 preferably are substantially rectangular in front view, and preferably a total of two pairs of front and rear supporting portions 37 are provided at or on the respective shake preventing bodies 35. The standing distance of the supporting portions 37 preferably is substantially equal to the hanging distance of the hanging portions 34. The shake preventing bodies 35 are substantially immovably held in position by such supporting portions 37, and the aforementioned contact surfaces are kept at substantially horizontal positions.<br>
Next, the assembling procedure and functions of the female terminal fitting 10 according to this embodiment are described. First, the contact piece 30 is arranged inside a flat conductive (preferably metal) piece to become the<br>
tubular portion 12, and this metal piece is bent in width direction or transverse direction TD in this state to form the substantially tubular portion 12. As the side plates 18 of the tubular portion 12 are bent to stand, the engaging pieces 36 of the contact piece 30 are at least partly inserted into the engaging holes 23 of the tubular portion 12. In this way, the contact piece 30 is engaged with and held in the tubular portion 12, the contact portion 33 of the contact main body 31 moves closer to the receiving pads 17, the shake preventing bodies 35 come to be arranged substantially horizontally along an inserting direction ID of the male tab 80, and the leading ends of the supporting portions 37 come into contact with the inner surfaces of the tubular portion 12 (facing plates 19). Further, the wire connection portion (preferably the barrel portion 13) is connected (preferably crimped or bent or folded into connection) with an end of a wire, whereby the female terminal fitting 10 is electrically connected with the wire.<br>
Subsequently, the female terminal fitting 10 connected with the wire is at least partly inserted into a cavity of the unillustrated connector housing. When the female terminal fitting 10 is inserted to a substantially proper depth, a resin locking portion formed at an inner wall of the cavity is resiliency at least partly fitted into the locking hole 16 of the tubular portion 12, with the result that the female terminal fitting 10 is retained in the connector housing. If the above connector housing is connected with a mating connector housing accommodating a male terminal fitting in this state, the male tab 80 at least partly enters the tubular portion 12 in the inserting direction ID through the tab insertion opening 12A and pushes the contact main body 31 of the contact piece 30 in a direction at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably<br>
substantially normal to the inserting direction ID (laterally or up) to resiliency deform it as shown in FIGS. 5 and 6. In this way, the male tab 80 is supported in the tubular portion 12 while being held between the contact portion 33 of the contact main body 31 and the receiving pads 17, thereby being electrically connected with the female terminal fitting 10. When the male tab 80 is substantially properly inserted into the tubular portion 12, the upper surface of the male tab 80 is in proximity to the contact surface(s) of the one or more shake preventing bodies 35 while defining a very small clearance or lightly in contact with the contact surfaces of the shake preventing bodies 35.<br>
If the wire is shaken in a direction intersecting with the longitudinal direction thereof with the female and male terminal fittings connected in the above manner, the tubular portion 12 may be accordingly displaced. However, even if the tubular portion 12 is displaced, following a shaking movement of the wire, the male tab 80 has the opposite widthwise ends of the upper surface thereof pressed by the one or more shake preventing portions 32 and has the (preferably substantially opposite) widthwise end(s) of the lower or innerwardly oriented surface thereof pressed by the receiving pads 17, thereby being prevented from making a shaking movement about the center of axis CA thereof. Therefore, there is no likelihood of largely changing a relative position of the male tab 80 in the tubular portion 12.<br>
As described above, according to this embodiment, the connection reliability of the male tab 80 and the female terminal fitting 10 can be improved since shaking movements of the male tab 80 in the tubular portion 12 are prevented by the one or more shake preventing portions 32 of the contact piece 30. Further, shaking movements of the male tab 80 along or about the<br><br>
longitudinal direction (forward and backward directions FBD) can also be reliably suppressed since these shake preventing portions 32 are formed at the (preferably substantially opposite) side(s) of the contact main body 31 to have substantially the same length as the contact main body 31.<br>
Further, the shaking movements of the male tab 80 can be reliably suppressed since the shake preventing portions 32 are prevented from being relatively displaced in the tubular portion 12 by the one or more, preferably the pair of front supporting portions 37 and/or the one or more, preferably the pair of rear supporting portions 37. In this case, since the contact piece 30 preferably is separate from the tubular portion 12, the thickness of the contact piece 30 can be set to a desired value regardless of the thickness of the tubular portion 12 Accordingly, smooth resilient deformations of the contact main body 31 can be guaranteed preferably by at least partly thinning the contact main body 31<br>
Further, since the contact position of the contact main body 31 is located at such a position distanced from the contact surfaces of the shake preventing portions 35 in height direction when the contact main body 31 is in its natural state, i.e. the contact main body 31 is not in contact with the male tab 80, a contact pressure of the contact main body 31 with the male tab 80 can be set to a proper value so that the contact surfaces of the shake preventing portions 35 and the upper surface of the male tab 80 are not strongly in contact with each other. As a result, an increase in the insertion resistance of the male tab 80 can be suppressed<br>
Accordingly, to improve the contact reliability of a male tab and a female terminal fitting, a female terminal fitting 10 is provided with a tubular portion 12<br>
into which a male tab 80 is at least partly insertable through a tab insertion opening 12A formed at or near the front end, and a (preferably substantially plate-shaped) contact piece 30 arranged at least partly inside the tubular portion 12 and adapted to sandwich the male tab 80 together with one or more receiving pads 17 provided in the tubular portion 12. The contact piece 30 includes a resiliently deformable contact main body 31 that is curved in thickness direction TD in such a manner as to come closer to the receiving pads 17 and can resiliently come into contact with an intermediate part (preferably a widthwise substantially middle part) of the plate surface of the male tab 80 at a contact position of the convex surface of this curve, and one or more shake preventing portions 32 formed along an inserting direction ID of the male tab 80 at the (preferably substantially opposite) sides of the contact main body 31 and adapted to prevent the male tab 80 from shaking about the center of axis CA thereof by coming into contact with the (preferably substantially opposite) widthwise end(s) of the plate surface of the male tab 80. Other Embodiments&gt;<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above described and illustrated embodiment. For example, the following embodiments are also embraced by the technical scope of the present invention. Beside the following embodiments, various changes can be made without departing from the spirit of the present invention.<br>
(1) Although the shake preventing portions are so formed at the opposite sides of the contact main body as to have substantially the same length as the contact main body in the foregoing embodiment, the shake preventing portions may be formed at least at the (preferably substantially<br>
opposite) side(s) of the contact portion of the contact main body or at least in an area from the tab insertion opening to the contact position according to the present invention.<br>
(2)	Although the shake preventing portions are so held in the tubular<br>
portion as not to make any loose movements by the supporting portions in the<br>
foregoing embodiment, they may be fixed in the tubular portion by the close<br>
engagement of the engaging pieces with the engaging holes according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
(3)	Although the contact piece is separate from the tubular portion in<br>
the foregoing embodiment, it may be integral or unitary to the tubular portion<br>
according to the present invention. For example, the contact piece may be an<br>
angled member pointing upward or inward and folded backward at the front end<br>
of the base plate of the tubular portion.<br>
(4)	Although the contact main body is described to have a wavy<br>
shape in the foregoing embodiment, the contact main body may be shaped to<br>
have a bent or curved form with only one inwardly oriented convex or bent<br>
portion (i.e. only having one distal end) according to the present invention.<br><br><br><br>
