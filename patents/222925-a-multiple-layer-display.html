				<td>A MULTIPLE LAYER DISPLAY<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to the field of electronic information display, and particularly to a<br>
multiple layer display.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In-car navigation systems and in-car entertainment systems are available as an<br>
accessory in new cars, or, are available separately for retrofit, commonly called after<br>
market sales. The displays for the systems are placed in or on top of the car dash<br>
board. Since the displays are typically of the wide-viewing angle colour liquid crystal<br>
type, both the front passenger and the driver may see the display. The display may be<br>
supplied, with information so that it forms part of the car's navigation system or part<br>
of the entertainment system at any one time. If an in-car entertainment system is<br>
fitted in view of the driver, the video component such as television and DVD must be<br>
disabled whilst the car is in motion, so not to distract the driver who is responsible for<br>
the safety of the vehicle. This is federally mandated safety requirement in many<br>
countries and is somewhat of a disadvantage as it is desirable for the front passenger,<br>
and only the front passenger, to view in-car entertainment. In practice many owners<br>
disable this safety feature resulting in potentially fatal distraction for the driver.<br>
However, it is also useful for the driver to view the in-car navigation system whilst the<br>
vehicle.is moving. With present systems this would interrupt the passenger's<br>
entertainment. A potential solution would be to supply separate displays to the<br>
passenger and driver, however this is increases expense and takes up almost double<br>
the area restricting design flexibility of the dash board control canter and reducing the<br>
space available for peripheral devices and storage space.<br>
Long aeroplane flights are particularly boring for passengers. Airlines have attempted<br>
to alleviate this boredom by including-projector systems on the aeroplanes to supply<br>
information about the journey and entertainment. However with a single projector<br>
system the entertainment is the same for each passenger, and there is no accounting<br>
for individual taste or interest. This problem has been alleviated in-some aeroplanes<br>
with separate displays for each passenger, however a display for each passenger<br>
-\-<br>
generally increases expense requires individual displays to be quite small, and can add<br>
significant weight to the plane increasing costs for airlines.<br>
It is the object of the present invention specifically to allow a passenger to view full<br>
entertainment features such as television and movies on the same display device that a<br>
driver can view navigation information without conflict between images and thus to<br>
reduce components, reduce complexity, reduce driver distraction, and increase<br>
passenger enjoyment. To do this one requires to control the viewing angle of a<br>
display. There exist various methods to do this.<br>
Certain environments such as kiosks or ATM's require privacy. Privacy film or filters<br>
are common in the market place which reduce the viewing angle in which the viewer<br>
can only, see the displayed images within a certain angle - typically directly in front of<br>
the display. A simple solution for a privacy screen is to laminate a view control film<br>
onto a screen. 3M are well known for producing these products which control the<br>
position from where the display can be viewed. The two most common types of<br>
privacy film axe light control film and blur film. Light control film acts like Venetian,<br>
blinds. If the observer were to stand at 60 to the front of these blinds the view would<br>
be blocked by the sides of the 'louvers'. However when the observer stands directly in<br>
front of the 'blinds' the display is viewable. Holographic diffusion film works by<br>
dispersing the incident light at particular angles and transmitting it at all other angles.<br>
The display appearance- changes from translucent to transparent depending on the<br>
viewing angle.<br>
A prismatic film or 'image directing film' can be used to direct the image displayed<br>
on a display device. The film rakes the image created by a flat panel display and<br>
redirects it to the optimum viewing angle, generally through refraction.<br>
Parallax barrier methods and lenticular lenses can also be used to direct light. .<br>
Viewing angle can also be controlled by the liquid crystal itself. Viewing angle, which<br>
is in the same direction as the maximum contrast, can be controlled by the liquid<br>
crystal cell structure itself. The contrast ratio is defined as the ratio of maximum<br>
luminance to the minimum luminance. Since the retardation experienced by the ray<br>
traversing at the midlayer tilt angle is the lowest in this direction in a normally black<br>
panel, the luminance in this direction is lower resulting in a lower contrast ratio. Both<br>
the azimuth and tilt of this angle can be controlled by changing the azimuth and tilt<br>
angle on the alignment layers respectively. See Liquid Crystal Displays by Ernst<br>
Lueder, Wily / SID series in display technology incorporated herein by way of<br>
reference.<br>
At present there exist methods to produce displays where several imaging planes are<br>
stacked with set distances between them. These imaging planes may also be stacked<br>
as. closely as possible. In a preferred embodiment these displays consist of a high-<br>
brightened backlight, and multiple image planes including but limited to a background<br>
image panel and a front image plane, which are parallel and physically separate and<br>
generally are laminated to form a stack. There are generally colour filter stripes, and<br>
a matrix on each display which. defined the borders of the pixels and a method of<br>
eliminated moire interference. The following discussion applies to all image planes<br>
that are addressed by passive or active matrices or have filters arranged in any<br>
periodic pattern but not limited to those described above.<br>
The viewing angle of liquid crystal displays can be controlled by the orientation of the<br>
liquid crystal molecules with respect to the glass substrates that form the display.<br>
Optimum viewing angle here means the direction a viewers looks in where the display<br>
contrast, the ratio between the luminance of the light and dark states of the display, is<br>
at a maximum. Orientation here is denned as a three-tuple where each element gives<br>
the magnitude of the angle between the x, y and z axes respectively where the x, y and<br>
z axes are aligned parallel with the horizontal, vertical and normal directions of the<br>
display respectively.<br>
It has previously been considered undesirable for displays to have a narrow viewing<br>
angle because this prohibits multiple users from viewing the same image. However in<br>
the case, of a car navigation and entertainment system it would be desirable for the<br>
driver to be able to see navigation information, and only navigation information and<br>
the passenger to see entertainment, and only entertainment. For safety, space and cost<br>
constraints it would be useful for both passengers to have different images views from<br>
the same display.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly in a first aspect of the present invention may broadly be said to consist in<br>
a. multi view display for viewing different images at specified viewing angles<br>
comprising a multi view display comprising:<br>
i) a display layer for the display of images;<br>
ii) an un-braiding viewing angle manipulation means which manipulates<br>
the viewing angle of the images displayed on said display layer;<br>
such that when at least two images are be interlaced and displayed on said display<br>
layer, each constituent image of the interlaced image is presented at the viewing angle .<br>
or viewing angles as determined by the un-braiding viewing angle manipulation<br>
means.<br>
Preferably two images will be presented to the viewer or viewers at different viewing<br>
angles using the present invention. Those images are interlaced and displayed on the<br>
display layer. The images are. interlaced in such a way that the un-braiding viewing<br>
angle manipulation means separates out or 'unbraids' the constituent images in said<br>
interlaced image and presents said constituent images at different viewing angles.<br>
Using this technique, the observer will see one of the constituent images from one<br>
viewing angle and other constituent images from other viewing angles. While this<br>
specification refers to the presentation of two images this should not be seen as<br>
limiting. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that greater numbers of images can be<br>
interlaced and subsequently displayed to various viewing angles.<br>
The term viewing angle manipulation means should be interpreted to mean any device<br>
used to direct light in certain directions or prevent light from proceeding in certain<br>
directions, this includes wide angle diffusers, privacy film, image or optical directing<br>
The term un-braiding viewing angle manipulation means is preferably an adapted<br>
viewing angle manipulation means such as a privacy film, image directing film or<br>
compensation film. Typically this will involve interlacing at least two viewing angle<br>
manipulation means which direct light at different angles. For example by interlacing<br>
two image directing films of which have different refraction angles to each other, the<br>
film will be capable (when applied to an interlaced image, which is interlaced<br>
consistently with the interlaced image directing films) of directing images to two<br>
different viewing angles.<br>
The term viewing angle as used here in should be interpreted as relating to the angle<br>
at which images displayed on a display device or pixel are viewable some a wide<br>
,viewin angles may close to 100% or 180 degrees. Typically narrower viewing angles<br>
will be used to narrow the angles from which images can be viewed.<br>
Throughout this specification reference is made to privacy film or image directing<br>
film or other viewing angle manipulation means. However this should not be seen as<br>
limiting. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that any means of directing images to<br>
viewing angles can be used with the present invention.<br>
In; the present invention, the unbraiding viewing angle manipulation means has the<br>
ability to present images displayed on the display device to different viewing angles.<br>
This can be achieved by interlacing two different image directing films each of which<br>
is designed to present images to a viewing angles angle which is different to the other<br>
interlaced privacy film.<br>
The interlacing of images and their display needs to be consistent with the un-braiding<br>
viewing angle manipulation means used. In the case of two images which are<br>
interlaced, two optical viewing films with different viewing angles to each other will<br>
be used with corresponding interlacing between the unbraiding viewing angle<br>
manipulation means and the interlaced image displayed.<br>
Preferably each of the at least two interlaced images are presented to a different<br>
viewing angles than the other image(s).<br>
Accordingly in a further aspect of the present invention may broadly be said to consist<br>
in a nrulti view display for viewing different images at specified viewing angles<br>
comprising a multi view display comprising,<br>
an adapted display layer for the display of images wherein said adapted<br>
display layer comprises, at least two different specified viewing angle pixels<br>
which are interlaced,<br>
such that when at least two images are interlaced and displayed on said adapted<br>
display layer, each constituent image of the interlaced image is presented to the<br>
viewing angle or viewing angles as determined by the viewing angle of the interlaced<br>
specified viewing angle pixels.<br>
The term 'specified viewing angle pixel' as used herein should be interpreted to<br>
include a pixel which is produced to have a defined viewing angle; that is the contrast<br>
ratio of the pixel is optimal for a certain scope of viewing angle. The control of<br>
viewing angle of a pixel is found commonly in the market. For example displays<br>
which are intended to be located higher than the intended viewer have a viewing angle<br>
pointing down.<br>
Different specified viewing angle pixels which have different viewing angles are<br>
interlaced within the adapted display layer. Preferably two images will be presented to<br>
the viewer or viewers. Those images are interlaced and displayed on the adapted<br>
display layer. The images are interlaced in such a way that the specified viewing angle<br>
pixels separate out or 'unbraids' the constituent images the interlaced image displayed<br>
on the adapted display layer and presents the constituent images at different viewing<br>
angles. Using this technique, the observer will see one of the constituent images from<br>
one viewing angle and the other constituent image from another viewing angle.<br>
Accordingly in a further aspect of the present invention may broadly be said to consist<br>
in a multi view display for viewing different images at specified viewing angles<br>
comprising a multi view display comprising:<br>
i) an adapted display layer for. the display of images wherein said<br>
adapted display layer comprises:<br>
ii) at least two different specified viewing angle pixels which are<br>
interlaced<br>
iii) an un-braiding viewing angle manipulation means;<br>
such that when at least two images are interlaced and displayed on said adapted<br>
display layer, each constituent image of the interlaced image is presented to the<br>
viewing angle or viewing angles as determined by the viewing angle of the interlaced<br>
specified viewing angle pixels in combination with the unbraiding viewing angle<br>
manipulation means.<br>
In this embodiment the combination of a manipulation means preferably an interlaced<br>
privacy film or light directing means is used in combination with interlaced specified<br>
viewing angle pixels. The combination of these mechanisms allows greater control of<br>
the viewing angle to which images are presented.<br>
Accordingly in a further aspect of the present invention may be broadly said to consist<br>
in a multi-layer multi view display for displaying different images at specified<br>
viewing angles comprising:<br>
i) at least two display layers for the display of images, said display layers<br>
being substantially planar and at least in part overlapping, wherein<br>
display layer(s) overlapping another display layer are selectively<br>
transparent;<br>
ii) an un-braiding viewing angle manipulation means acting upon at least<br>
one of the display layers and thereby manipulating the viewing angle<br>
of images displayed on the display layer(s) behind it;<br>
such that when at least two images are be interlaced and a display layer<br>
which the un-braiding viewing angle manipulation means is acting upon,<br>
each constituent image of the interlaced image displayed on said layer(s)<br>
(which the un-braiding. viewing angle manipulation means is acting upon)<br>
is presented at the viewing angle or viewing angles as determined by the<br>
. un-braiding viewing angle manipulation means.<br>
In.one preferred embodiment of the present invention the display device is made up of<br>
a two layered multi-layer display, being backlit, with each, layer being selectively<br>
transparent. In between those layers an interlaced lens with a triangle strip pattern<br>
with particular viewing angles acting as a viewing angle manipulation means acts on<br>
the rear most layer. The interlaced lens allows the constituent images of an interlaced<br>
image displayed on the rear screen to be seen from the viewing angles specified by the<br>
interlaced lens.<br>
A conventional non-layered, non-compensated colour liquid crystal display, contrast<br>
ratio decreases until to a crossover point at which the image, inverts when viewed<br>
from outside the optimal viewing angle. This results in images being "washed out"<br>
and beyond the cut-off point these colours invert completely with black changing to<br>
white.<br>
In the multi-layered setup used in. a multi view display as described here-in the<br>
display is required to be transparent. Hence in a real life scenario - the multi-layered<br>
multi view display is used in a car - if the driver was looking at the rear image layer<br>
with a viewing direction of about 60 degrees in the plane perpendicular to the floor<br>
and parallel with the horizontal and with the front image layer with an optimal<br>
viewing direction of -60 degrees in said plane then the driver will be able to see the<br>
image on the rear image layer and not on the from image layer. Conversely, the<br>
passenger, sitting to the other side of the display, can see only information from the<br>
front image layer. Hence the passenger can view entertainment only and the drive can<br>
view navigation only. Thus limited viewing angle, which was previously considered<br>
as a disadvantage in the industry, combined with multiple layered displays can be<br>
used to multiplex images to multiple viewers which is an unexpected advantage.<br>
Accordingly in a further aspect of the present invention may be broadly said to consist<br>
in a multi-layer nvulti view display for displaying different images at specified<br>
viewing angles comprising:<br>
at least two display layers for the display of images, said display layers being .<br>
substantially planar and at least in part overlapping, wherein display layer(s)<br>
overlapping another display layer are selectively transparent;<br>
where in at. least one of the display layers is an adapted display layer comprising<br>
pixels which are specified viewing angle pixels;<br>
such that images displayed on the at least one adapted display layer will be<br>
presented to the viewing angle of the specified viewing angle pixels.<br>
Preferably the images displayed on the at least one adapted display layer have a<br>
different viewing angle to the images displayed on the other (non-adapted) display<br>
layer(s).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the display device is made up of a<br>
two layered multi-layer display, being backlit, with each layer being selectively<br>
transparent. Both display layers are adapted display layers, having specified viewing<br>
angle pixels where the viewing angle of each of the two layers is opposite such that a<br>
viewer from the left will see the. image displayed one layer and a observer from the<br>
right will see the image displayed on the other layer.<br>
Accordingly in a further aspect of the present invention may be. broadly said to consist<br>
in a multi-layer multi view display for displaying different images at specified<br>
viewing angles comprising:<br>
i) at least two display layers for the display of images, said display layers<br>
being substantially planar and at least in part overlapping, wherein<br>
display layer(s) that are overlapping another display layer are<br>
selectively transparent,<br>
ii) a viewing angle manipulation means with a wide viewing angle acting<br>
upon at least one display and being located behind at least one display,<br>
such that images displayed upon display layers that the viewing angle manipulation<br>
means is acting on are presented to the viewing angle determined by the viewing<br>
angle manipulation means.<br>
In a preferred embodiment two display layers are overlapped and transparent and are<br>
backlit The front layer has a narrow viewing angle to the left (from the viewer's<br>
perspective) behind this is a further narrow viewing angle display but acting upon it is<br>
a wide angle diffusion refractor. Hence the images displayed on the rear layer are<br>
viewable from a wide viewing angle and the images displayed on the front layer are<br>
viewed only from the left (and are viewed as being layered on top of images displayed<br>
on the back layer), The diffusing refractor will assist in overcoming the moire<br>
interference arising as a result of layering two like substrates.<br>
Accordingly in a further aspect of the present invention may be broadly said to consist<br>
in a multi-layer multi view display for displaying different images at specified<br>
viewing angles comprising:<br>
at least two display layers for the display of images, said display layers<br>
being substantially planar and at least in part overlapping, wherein display<br>
layer(s) that are overlapping another display layer are selectively<br>
transparent,<br>
wherein at least one of the display layers is an adapted display layer<br>
comprising of at least two different specified viewing angle pixels which<br>
are interlaced, and all layers to the rear of that adapted display layer (if<br>
any) are adapted display layers<br>
and also comprising at least one an un-braiding viewing angle<br>
manipulation means acting upon the adapted the display layer(s) behind it,<br>
such that when at least two images are interlaced and displayed on said adapted<br>
display layer, each constituent image of the interlaced image is presented to the<br>
viewing angle as- determined by the viewing angle of the interlaced specified viewing<br>
angle pixels in combination with the unbraiding viewing angle manipulation means.<br>
Preferably the multi view display is adapted to receive images from a CPU or other<br>
image transferring device such as a DVD or video playback.<br>
Accordingly a further aspect of the present invention comprises a method of operating<br>
a multi view display said multi view display having at least two viewing angles<br>
characterised by the steps of displaying each images intended for each viewing to the<br>
display layer which presents that image to the intended viewing angle.<br>
Accordingly a further aspect of the present invention comprises display software<br>
adapted to facilitate the display of images using multi view display said multi view<br>
display having at least two viewing angles said display software being adapted to<br>
execute the steps of transmitting each images intended for each viewing to the display<br>
layer which presents that image to the intended viewing angle:<br>
Accordingly a further aspect of the present invention comprises a method of operating<br>
a multi view display said multi view display comprising at least two multi layered<br>
display layers characterised by the steps of:<br>
. i) displaying interlaced images on display layers on which, an un-braiding<br>
viewing angle manipulation means acts<br>
ii) displaying non-interlaced images on any display layers (if any) on<br>
which no un-braiding viewing angle manipulation means acts.<br>
Accordingly a further aspect- of the present invention comprises display software<br>
adapted to facilitate the display of images using a multi view display said multi view<br>
display comprising at least two multi layered display layers, said display software<br>
being adapted to execute the steps of:<br>
i) transmitting interlaced images to display layer(s), said display layer(s)<br>
having an un-braiding viewing angle manipulation means acting upon<br>
it (them), said interlaced image being acted upon by said un-braiding<br>
viewing angle manipulation means to present the constituent images of<br>
the interlaced image to differing viewing angles, and<br>
ii) transmitting (non-interlaced) image data to display layers (if any) on<br>
which no unbraiding viewing angle manipulation means acts said<br>
image data being used by said display components to display a images<br>
to the viewing angle inherent to said display layer.<br>
The display layer used in the invention specified in this can be any kind of display<br>
device capable of meeting the needs of the embodiment - such as interlacing of pixels<br>
or transparency in the case of a multi layered embodiment such display device can be<br>
an. Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), an Organic Light Emitting Diode Display (OLED)<br>
or any other type of display.<br>
Reference throughout this specification is made the present invention as applying to<br>

that other types of display and imaging systems may be used in conjunction with the<br>
invention, not necessarily being video screens such as but not limited to hand held or<br>
arcade video games, desktop computers, security monitors, process control system<br>
monitors.<br>

BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
In a first preferred embodiment a single layer display is used to at least two different<br>
images or display contents each image/display-content being presented to a different<br>
viewingangle to the images/display-content.<br>
Figure one illustrates single layer multi view display used as an in-car<br>
navigation/entertainment device. A viewer (1) looking at the display (5) in the<br>
direction shown sees a movie being played (3), whilst a second viewer (2) looking at<br>
the display in the direction shown sees the image of a navigation system (4). In this<br>
embodiment the display layer (5) is adapted such that it comprises interlaced pixels of<br>
two different viewing angles. The movie is displayed on pixels of one viewing angle<br>
and the navigation images are displayed on pixels of the other viewing angle.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment a multi-layered multi view device is used to display<br>
at least two' different images or display contents each image/display-content being<br>
presented to a different viewing angle to the images/display-content.<br>
Figure two illustrates a combined in-car navigation and entertainment display* A first<br>
layer with optimum viewing direction (6) is placed substantially collinear and as close<br>
to a second layer with an optimum viewing direction (8). In most cases there will be a<br>
diffusion layer (9) to abate moire interference. The displays can be back lit using<br>
either direct viewlamps or a light pipe (10). A viewer viewing at an angle (6) will see<br>
image (3), and a viewer looking in direction (8) will see image (4).<br>
In a further preferred embodiment a multi-layered multi view device is used to display<br>
layered images to. one viewer and a single image to another viewer.<br>
Figure three illustrates a multi layered multi view device. An image (15) is displayed on the<br>
first layer (13) with an optimum viewing direction (30) and an image (14) is displayed<br>
on a second layer (11) through a viewing angle enhancer (12) which expands the<br>
viewing angle (31) of second layer (11) with an optimum viewing angle of (31), such<br>
that a viewer (17) inline with the viewing angle of the first layer (30) would see a<br>
combined image (19) with the image (14) from the second layer (11) would appear at<br>
distance behind the image (IS) from the first layer (13) and such that a second<br>
simultaneous viewer (16) outside the viewing angle (30) of the fist layer would see an<br>
image (18) only represented by the second layer. (11).<br>
In a further preferred embodiment a multi-layered multi view device is used in<br>
combination with an interlaced optical film or lens<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a diagrammatic view of the multi-layered privacy embodiment<br>
where image (25) is displayed on the first layer (22) and multiple images (23, 24) are<br>
displayed on the back layer (20) such that the images are interlaced to match a lens<br>
stripe pattern (21) allowing a viewer (29) in position inline with pattern (32) matching<br>
the image (23) on the rear layer (20) would see a composite image (29) compromising<br>
the foreground image (25) in front of a background image (23) that is aligned with the<br>
viewers (27) position, while allowing a second simultaneous viewer in position inline<br>
with a pattern (33) matching the image (24) on the rear layer (20) would see a<br>
composite image (28) compromising the foreground image (25) in front of a<br>
background image (24) that is aligned with the viewer's position. •<br>
