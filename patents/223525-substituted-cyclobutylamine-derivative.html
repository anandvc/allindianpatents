This invention relates to an antibacterial compound useful for a medicament, a veterinary drug, a drug for fisheries or an dntibacterial preservative, and to an antibacterial agent and an antibacterial preparation, which contain the compound.<br>
Since the discovery of norfloxacin, antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics after administration of quinolone antibacterial agents have been improved, and many compounds are now used in the clinical field as chemotherapeutic agents which are effective in almost systemic infectious diseases.<br>
In recent years, generation of bacteria having low sensitivity to quinolone synthetic antibacterial agents has been increasing in the field of clinics.  For example, like the case of Staphylococcus aureus   (MRSA) which is non-sensitive to )3-lactam antibiotics, a case has been increasing in which a bacterium originally resistant to drugs other than quinolone antibacterial agents becomes low-sensitive to quinolone antibacterial agents too.  In consequence, development of a drug having further high efficacy has been called for in the field of clinics.  On the other hand, it has been revealed that quinolone synthetic antibacterial agents cause a side effect in which severe convulsion is<br><br>
induced when a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug is simultaneously used, as well as other side effects such as phototoxicity and the like, so that development of a quinolone synthetic antibacterial agent having higher safety has also been called for in the field.<br>

Ten minutes thereafter, the ice bath was detached and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours.  After evaporation of the solvent under a reduced pressure, the thus obtained residue was mixed with 30 ml of 80% ethanol and 3 ml of triethylamine and heated under reflux for 2 hours.  After evaporation of the solvent under a reduced pressure, the thus obtained residue was mixed with ethyl acetate and saturated sodium bicarbonate aqueous solution to effect separation of layers.  The organic layer was washed with saturated brine, the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate and then the organic layers were combined and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate.
