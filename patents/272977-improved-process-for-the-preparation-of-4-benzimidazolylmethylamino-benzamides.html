				<td>IMPROVED PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE SALTS OF 4-(BENZIMIDAZOLYLMETHYLAMINO)-BENZAMIDES<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
1.	TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to a process for preparing a salt of an optionally substituted 4-(benzimidazol-2-ylmethylamino)-benzamidine, wherein<br>
(a)	an optionally correspondingly substituted diaminobenzene is condensed with 2-[4-(l,2,4-oxadiazol-5-on-3-yl)-phenylamino]-acetic acid and<br>
(b)	i) the product thus obtained is hydrogenated,<br>
ii) optionally the amidino group is carbonylated without isolating the intermediate product of the hydrogenation beforehand.<br>
2.	PRIOR ART<br>
Substituted (4-benzimidazol-2-ylmethylamino)-benzamidines, particularly l-methyl-2-[N-[4-(N-n-hexyloxycarbonylamidino)phenyl]-amino-methyl]-benzimidazol-5-yl-carboxylic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide are already known from International Patent Application WO 98/37075 as active substances with a thrombin-inhibiting and thrombin time prolonging activity.<br>
The main types of indication for the compound of chemical formula I are the postoperative prevention of deep vein thrombosis and the prevention of stroke (prevention of stroke due to atrial fibrillation, SPAF for short).<br>
In WO 98/37075 it is proposed that the substituted (4-benzimidazol-2-ylmethylamino)-benzamidines be prepared by reacting the corresponding substituted (4-benzimidazol-2-ylmethylamino)-benzonitriles with ammonia. This process is highly complex from the point of view of production technology and results in a high loading of acids that have to be disposed of.<br>
The aim of the present invention was to indicate an alternative method of preparing the substituted (4-benzimidazol-2-ylmethylamino)-benzamidines, by which this technologically complex step could be avoided.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Surprisingly it has now been found that the salts of the substituted 4-(benzimidazol-2-ylmethylamino)-benzamidines can be produced in high yields and using inexpensive adjuvants if<br>
(a)	an optionally correspondingly substituted diaminobenzene is condensed with 2-[4-(l,2,4-oxadiazol-5-on-3-yl)-phenylamino]-acetic acid and<br>
(b)	i) the product thus obtained is hydrogenated,<br>
ii) optionally the amidino group is carbonylated, without isolating the intermediate product of the hydrogenation beforehand and<br>
iii) without prior isolation of the intermediate product of the carbonylation the desired salt is isolated.<br>

The catalyst is filtered off, the filter is washed with THF/water (7:3) and the filtrate is clarified with active charcoal. The charcoal is filtered off and the filter is washed with THF and water. The filtrate thus obtained is reacted further directly in step b)ii).<br>
(C) The optional subsequent carbonylation in step (b)ii), in order to obtain from a compound of formula (I), wherein R3 denotes hydrogen, a compound of formula (I) wherein R3 has a meaning other than hydrogen, without intermediate isolation of the hydrogenation product, is carried out by direct reaction of the compound of formula (I) obtained in step (b)i), wherein R3 denotes hydrogen, with a carbonylation agent R3-X, where R3 has the meanings given above with the exception of hydrogen and X denotes a leaving group.

The base used may conveniently be an alkali metal carbonate such as for example potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate, an alkali metal hydrogen carbonate such as for example sodium hydrogen carbonate or potassium hydrogen carbonate or a tertiary amine such as for example triethylamine. Preferably potassium carbonate is used. The reaction may for example be carried out in mixtures of water and acetone, water and dioxane or water and THF; a water/THF mixture is preferred.<br>
After the reaction has ended a clear two-phase mixture may be formed by heating the suspension, e.g. to approx. 50Â°C, so that the aqueous phase, which contains a large proportion of the inorganic constituents, can be separated off. Then a change of solvent may take place. Suitable solvents include for example ketones or esters such as MIBK, butyl acetate, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, isopropyl acetate or isobutyl acetate. Preferably MIBK or butyl acetate are used; butyl acetate is particularly preferred.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of step (b)ii) the product of step (b)i) (= the filtrate from the hydrogenation) is combined at ambient temperature with an aqueous potassium carbonate solution. Then the carbonylation agent, for example n-hexyl chloroformate, is metered in at a temperature of 10 - 20Â°C. The suspension is heated to 50Â°C during which time a clear two-phase mixture is formed. Depending on the results of the conversion check carried out further carbonylation agent is optionally metered in at approx. 50Â°C until the reaction of the educt is complete. Then the THF is distilled off and replaced by butyl acetate. The organic phase is repeatedly washed with water with heating to 50 - 70Â°C, in order to eliminate polar impurities. Any residual moisture remaining is subsequently removed by azeotropic distillation.<br>
(D) Then before the precipitation of the salt in step (b)iii) a change of solvent may take place. For this, the organic solvent used previously, such as butyl acetate, is distilled off<br>
and replaced by the solvent for the salt precipitation. Suitable solvents for the partial step (b)iii) include for example ketones such as for example acetone or MIBK, ethers such as for example THF, esters such as for example ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate or butyl acetate or alcohols such as for example methanol, ethanol or isopropanol.

In a preferred embodiment of step (b)iii), after a change of solvent to a mixture of acetone and ethanol, at a temperature of approx. 30 - 36Â°C a solution of the corresponding acid, e.g. methanesulphonic acid, in acetone is slowly added to the product of step (b)ii) (= carbonylation solution) in the presence of seed crystals. The suspension is stirred, and the precipitated product is isolated by filtration, washed with acetone and dried under suitable conditions.<br>

The inert diluents used may be both protic solvents - such as e.g. alcohols, and/or water -or aprotic polar solvents such as e.g. ethers and/or amides or lactams and/or mixtures thereof. Water may optionally be added to all the solvents. Protic solvents used are preferably water or branched or unbranched C1- C8 alkanols or mixtures thereof. Particularly preferably, water or lower alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and isopropanol or mixtures thereof are used. Most particularly preferably, ethanol is used as reaction medium, and this may optionally contain water. Isopropanol, optionally together with water, may also be used. The most suitable solvent is water, however. Suitable<br>
aprotic solvents are polar ethers such as for example tetrahydrofuran or dimethoxy-ethylether or amides such as for example dimethylformamide, or lactams such as for example N-methylpyrrolidone.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment ethyl bromoacetate is metered into a suspension of 2-[4-(l,2,4-oxadiazol-5-on-3-yl)-aniline and sodium carbonate in water/isopropanol or preferably in water/ethanol and stirred at 35-45Â°C. The cooled suspension is suction filtered, washed with water and ethanol in several batches and dried.<br>
The saponification is preferably carried out in a protic solvent with an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, particularly with lithium, sodium or potassium hydroxide.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment 2-[4-(l,2,4-oxadiazol-5-on-3-yl)-phenylamino]-acetic acid ester is suspended in water or preferably in water/ethanol and slowly combined with an aqueous solution of NaOH at ambient temperature.

After 15 min stirring diethyl carbonate or preferably dimethyl carbonate is added dropwise. After 2-4 hours reaction time the mixture is cooled<br>
and ethanol is distilled off at 120 mbar and 40Â°C. The residue is taken up in water and after heating adjusted to pH 10-12 using semi-cone, sodium hydroxide solution, then to pH
