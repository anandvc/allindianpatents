				<td>A Method and Apparatus for Realizing Beam Forming in CDMA System<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention belongs to the field of mobile communication, and relates to an apparatus for realizing beam forming in CDMA system and method thereof, Specifically, to an apparatus for realizing beam forming by using smart antenna technique in CDMA mobile communication.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In recent years, CDMA mobile communication system has been developed greatly and employed widely, whose most typical examples are CDMA 95, CDMA 2000 mobile communication systems commonly used currently in commerce. Compared with mobile communication systems with other mechanisms (such as the time division multiple access TDMA system, the frequency division multiple access FDMA system), the CDMA system has advantages in capacity and service quality. However, because users of CDMA system share one single wideband channel, the common channel interference (CO) among respective users will be resulted, which limits the capacity of the CDMA system. Furthermore, the rapidly increasing number of mobile communication users and continuously increasing demand on quality of mobile telecommunication require the cells to remain high talking quality while having a great capacity. On the respects of lowering the interference of the system and improving the capacity, the method commonly used is to use the technique of sectoring the cell, too many of sectors, however, will bring about too much handoff load to the system, and will generate pilot frequency pollution, therefore, the existing base station equipments commonly employ there or six sectors. In dense urban area, it is sometimes necessary to further improve the capacity and performance of the system on the basis of the sector base station. When in such situation, some other techniques are needed, such as the multi-carrier technique, the smart antenna<br>
technique.<br>
The smart antenna technique is a new kind of mobile communication techniques, including the fixed multi-beam system and the adaptive multi-beam system. The multi-beam handoff system is a system which adds a handoff logic to the fixed multi-beam system so as to facilitate the handoffs among the beam systems. In some documents, the fixed multi-beam system and the multi-beam handoff system are called by a joint name as fixed beam system, the same is true in the present invention.<br>
The smart antenna system controls the direction of the beams by using antenna array, and is capable of tracking the changes of the signals. Compared with all direction antennas and sector antennas, the smart antenna system can improve the gains of antennas via narrow beams, therefore can improve the reception quality of signals greatly.<br>
Theoretically speaking, the smart antenna system with N antenna meta can bring the gain of 10 LogN dB in the condition of adding white Gauss (AWGN) channel, so with the same array transmission power, the smart antenna system can increase the cover area of a base station, for example, when the path loss index n=4.5, and 8 meta array is used, the number of the base stations needed to cover this area will be decreased by 60% compared with the number of base stations using the common antenna system. While maintaining the same cover area, the smart antenna system can improve the performance of the base station system, decrease the transmission power of the meta, and increase the cost benefits of the base station.<br>
The adaptive antenna system forms the transmission and reception beams of the user signals by adopting a certain adaptive rule. Though it has great flexibility and has good performance gains, the system is complicated in realization, and is very difficult to be updated to the smart antenna system based on the existing system.<br>
Since the fixed beam system in the smart antenna system can further divide the sectors via the narrow beams, the capacity of the smart antenna system is greatly increased compared to the none smart antenna system with sectors. For example, Fig.l is<br>
a schematic view of a common CDMA base station system with sectors. In Fig.2, each sector in Fig.l is further divided into multiple beams which share one pilot, so the interference and handoff are reduced, and the capacity of the system is increased.<br>
The fixed beam-forming network can use either the digital beam-forming technique or the analog beam-forming technique.<br>
The smart antenna has incomparable advantages in aspects of eliminating interference, enlarging cover area of cells, decreasing system costs, and improving system capacity.<br>
The fixed beam smart antenna system is relatively suitable to be realized in the existing CDMA systems, such as CDMA 95 , CDMA 2000 and WCDMA systems, while the adaptive beam antenna system is comparatively compatible to be realized in the new CDMA systems, such as TD-SCDMA system. The adaptive beam smart antenna system requires more complicated algorithm and correction technique than the fixed beam smart antenna system does.<br>
When using the fixed beam system in CDMA system, it not only needs to form multiple fixed narrow beams for carrying the service information of users, but also the sector beams covering the whole sector, which is used for transmitting the common information of users, such as the information of the pilot channel, the paging channel and the synchronization channel.<br>
Currently, many realizable schemes have been proposed in this research area.<br>
One scheme is to transmit the common information when all the fixed beams are transmitting the traffic channels. However, the pilot channel of each beam, whose vector sum is the strength of the pilot channel of any point in the space, is correlated. When adding the vectors of each beam together to form the pilot channel, the overlays between beams will result in bad addition in some area, and the so-called coverage blind area, where when the mobile stations enter, the talking quality will be decreased greatly, and the call will be even disconnected.<br>
Another scheme is that besides the radio frequency channels and the antennas for generating the fixed narrow beams, another one or group of radio frequency channels and antennas are added to generate beams covering the whole sector for transmitting the common information (such as information of the pilot channel, the paging channel and the synchronization channel). However, this method needs additional high power radio frequencyelements and transmission antennas, which will increase the realization cost of the system. In addition, because the pilot channels and the traffic channels pass different radio frequency links in this method, a complicated correction technique will be needed to overcome the problem of time and phrase offsets of the pilot channels and the traffic channels due to the variations of time and temperature. The US patent No.6094165 disclosed such a scheme as generating a fixed beam covering the sector by using an additional array antenna.<br>
There is still another scheme in which a certain frequency offset exists between each fixed beam, so as to reduce the bad addition between the beams when synthesizing pilot channels. The related content of it can refer to the US patent No.US2002/0072393, in which the proposed frequency offset is 30~120Hz, that is, if each sector has 3 beams as commonly used, the carrier offset of this part will reach ±30~120Hz, IS-97 (the minimum testing createia for the performance of base station in CDMA95 and CDMA2000) prescribes that the TX frequency tolerance of the base station should

Detailed Description of Embodiments<br>
The devices and method of the present invention are realized according to the following schemes respectively:<br>
The device of smart antenna beam-forming used in CDMA system is as follows:<br>
The fixed beam-forming network can employ either the digital beam-forming technique, or the analog beam-forming technique. Therefore, according to the different techniques for forming beams, the device of smart antenna fixed beam-forming used in CDMA system can be divided into analog beam-forming device and digital beam-forming device.<br>
In which, the device of smart antenna analog fixed beam-forming used in CDMA system comprises in a forward signal flow, at least a base band system, an optical transceiver system, a transceiver (TRX) system, an analog fixed beam-forming network (such as Butler array), a power amplifier, a radio frequency front end (transmission filter) and an antenna system. And according to the signal flow in reverse direction, it at least includes an antenna system, a radio frequency front end (reception filter), a low noise amplifier, an analog fixed beam-forming network (such as Butler array), a transceiver (TRX) system, an optical transceiver and a base band system.<br>
When the device of analog fixed beam-forming transmits forward signals, in order to avoid the multiple beams forming the common channels counteracting one another, first, the different beams are made to have different time delays in the base band system, so that even when the different beams carry the same information, they will not correlate with one another, then each of the different beams pass its corresponding optical transceiver system through the optical transceiver system, after which, the beams pass the<br>
analog fixed beam-forming network, and are amplified, filtered and transmitted by antennas, and finally are formed to be beams in different directions in space.<br>
The analog fixed beam-forming device only needs to correct the analog fixed beam-forming network (such as Butler array), the power amplifier, the radio frequency front end (transmission filter), the feedback and the antenna system, and the radio frequency cables therebetween. The radio frequency cables of the transceiver system and those between the transceivers and the analog fixed beam-forming network do not need correction. Therefore, the correction of analog fixed beam-forming device is relatively easy.<br>
The analog fixed beam-forming network in the analog fixed beam-forming device can employ either Butler array, or other types of array. For example, the Blass array or the electromagnetic lens of Luneberg or Rotman type can also be used as beam-forming equipments.<br>
The smart antenna digital fixed beam-forming device used in CDMA system comprises in a forward signal flow, at least a base band system, a digital fixed beam-forming part, an optical transceiver, a transceiver system (TRX), a power amplifier, radio frequency front end (transmission filter) and an antenna system. While according to signal flow in reverse direction, it at least includes an antenna system, radio frequency front end (reception filter), a low noise amplifier, a transceiver (TRX) system, an optical transceiver, a digital fixed beam-forming part, and a base band system.<br>
When the digital fixed beam-forming device transmitting forward signals, in order to avoid the multiple beams forming the common channels counteracting one another, first, the different beams are made to have different time delays in the base band system, that is, to ensure the different beams not correlate with one another even when they carry the same information, then, the different beams pass the digital fixed beam-forming network to acquire different space directions, after which, each of the different beams pass its corresponding transceiver system and is amplified, filtered and transmitted by antennas,<br>
and finally, the beams are formed to be beams with different directions in space.<br>
The digital fixed beam-forming device needs to correct the transceiver system, the power amplifier, radio frequency front end (transmission filter), the feedback and the antenna system, as well as the radio frequency cables therebetween.<br>
The method of smart antenna beam-forming used in CDMA system of the present invention is as follows:<br>
Step one. in the base band, the base band signals of each fixed beam are reflected to the sectors of the base band chips.<br>
In this step, the base band signals of each fixed beam not only can be reflected to different sectors of the base band chips, but also can be reflected to the same sector of different base band chips, both of which can realize the same function.. For example, in the case of reflecting fixed beams to the same sector of different base band chips, if three chips are used, the three beams of the first sector are reflected to the same a sector of the three chips respectively, the three beams of the second sector to the same ß sector, and the three beams of the third sector to the same  sector. In this step, when transmitting in a traffic channel of a user, the transmitting can be made only within certain fixed beam where the user locates, that is, the base band signals of the fixed beams for this user are reflected to one certain corresponding sector of the base band chips.<br>
if the user locates among several beams, one or several narrow beams can be selected according to strengths of several user signals of beams received to transmit service data of the user, that is, the base band signals of the user is reflected to one or several corresponding sectors of the base band chips.<br>
In this step, when transmitting the common channel of users, the information of the common channel should be transmitted in every fixed beam, that is, the information of the common channel should be reflected to each sector of the base band chips.<br>
Step two, the base band signals of each fixed beam reflected to the corresponding sectors of the corresponding base band chips are made to have different time delays. This<br>
step is also accomplished in the base band chips, and of course, it can also be accomplished by the digital logic components after the base band chips, that is, be accomplished in the base band.<br>
The volume of the time delay should meet the criterion of making the output signals of each sector of the base band chips not correlate with one another when transmitting the common channel information.<br>
The object of this step is to make the base band signals of all the fixed beams forming the common channel of the whole sector not correlate with one another, therefore the problem that the beams in some area correlate with and counteract one another or are greatly reduced due to the correlating addition of the space vectors of the respective beams is solved.<br>
The method of multiple antenna beam-forming used in CDMA system is also adaptable to multiple antenna analog fixed beam-forming device of CD AM system, and multiple antenna digital fixed beam-forming device of CDMA system.<br>
In connection with appended drawings the embodiments of the technical schemes of the present invention will be further described below in detail:<br>
Fig.l shows a schematic view of structure of a sector celluar mobile telecommunication system. Due to the limitation of mobile frequency resource, the mobile telecommunication system with celluar structure is acknowledged and widely used as the networking form of land mobile telecommunication base station system. According to the difference of traffic in the coverage area, the celluar base station can employ all direction base station, and also can employ sector base station. In fig.l, the base station 100 and 101 is a base station system with a structure of three sectors, and each sector has a coverage area of 120°. The actual system can appropriately change the size and quantity of sectors according to the quantity of traffic.<br>
Fig.2 shows a schematic view of structure of a sector celluar mobile telecommunication system employing the smart antenna system. Compared with the<br>
sector none smart antenna celluar mobile system, this system can improve its capacity and reduce the number of the base stations. In drawings, 200 refers to a three sector base station employing the smart antenna system, 201 refers to a neighboring base station of 200 with one single sector employing the smart antenna system. Each base station sector includes several pre-generated fixed beams. Taking sector 210 of the base station 200 for example, 222,224,226 are fixed beams, a certain extent of overlay is required between two neighboring fixed beams so as to avoid blind coverage area, thereby to ensure that the beams can cover the whole sector. In actual system design, the number of the fixed beams in each sector can be set freely according to the quantity of the traffic and the size of the sector. When user 230 moves in sector 210, the base station selects, after comparing the reception signals from fixed beams 222,224 and 226, one beam with the best signal quality or several beams with relatively good quality as reception beams, in the latter case, the signals of the selected beams are combined together. The time delay of the base band is adjusted in order to make the time delays output by the base band different, so that the beams will not correlate with one another even when they output the same signals, thereby the time delays of fixed beams 222,224 and 226 at the end of antennas are also different, thus, the problem that the signals of beams in some area are very weak due to the correlating addition of the beams can be avoided, and a sector beam covering the whole sector can be formed, as shown in fig.220. This sector beam is mainly for but not limited to transmitting the common information of users, such as the pilot information, and of course, it can also transmit traffic information and receive user information. When the user moves around the boundaries between sectors 210,211 and 212, the base stations 200 and 201 support the handoff function between sectors, with operation principle similar to that of the sector none smart antenna system.<br>
For the present invention, fig.3 is a block diagram of an embodiment of the base band system, fig.4A is a block diagram of the sector smart antenna system employing the analog fixed beam-forming network (such as Bulter array), flg.4B is a block diagram of<br>
the sector smart antenna system employing digital fixed beam-forming architecture. It is well known that, in CDMA system, the pseudo random code used in pilot spreading spectrum has characters of good self-related and correlated, that is, the self-related value of the pseudo random code itself is very high. However, when the pseudo random code is related to another pseudo random code which is equal to or has one more chip than itself, its related value is very low, almost near to zero. To employ this character of CDMA system, the beams at the end of the antennas can be made to have different time delays when transmitting the common information so that they will not correlate with one another when forming the common channel beams (when the correlation value is near to zero, the beams will not correlate with one another naturally), therefore, the problem that the fixed beams correlate with and counteract one another when composing beams for covering the whole sector is avoided. For example, we can design beam 224 as the normal pilot offset of sector 210, and design the normal offset as<br>
t224, the time of beam 226 is 1□5 chips ahead of beam 224 □ and the time of beam 222 is 1□5 chips later than beam 224. If a concrete time   t is chosen from 1□5<br>
chips,    the transmission time offset of beam 226 is   t226 =t224- t    □ and the<br>
transmission time offset of beam 222 is   222-224<br>
In which, the time of each chip is different a little in different CDMA systems. In CDMA95 and CDMA2000, the time of one chip is equivalent to l/1.2288MHz=0.814us□in TD□SCDMA, it is equivalent to l/1.28MHz=0.78us□ in WCDMA, it is equivalent to l/3.84MHz=0.26us. The time of five chips is equivalent to be five times as the time of one chip□for example, in CDMA95 and CDMA2000, the time of 5 chips is equivalent to 4.07us.<br>
In fig.4A,4B, the corresponding base band outputs of beams 226, 224 and 222 are made to be 301, 302 and 303 respectively by employing the analog fixed beam forming network or the digital fixed beam-forming technique. Because the time<br>
delays (ns level) of the radio frequency link from the outputs 301, 302, 303 of the base band 300 to the antenna system 460 can be ignored compared to the time delay of chip level(us level), the time offsets corresponding to the outputs 301, 302,<br>
303 of the base band 300 can be considered as  t 301= t226 = t- = t302 -t □<br>
t302 = t224 = t302 □ t303 = t222 = t224 + t = t302 + tt that is, with reference to the output<br>
302 of the base band 300, the output 301 of the base band system 300 is   ahead of the output 302 of the base band system 300□nd the output 303 of the base band<br>
system 300 is   t later than the output 302 of the base band system 300, in which<br>
t  is one certain time delay selected from 1□5 chips as mentioned above. The relative offset of output time between outputs 301, 302, 303 of the base band system 300 can be accomplished in the base band chip, and of course, can also be accomplished in the digital logic component after the base band chip. This will be described in detain below with reference to fig.3.<br>
Fig.3 is a block diagram of the base band system, which only shows the block diagram of the base band system 300 of sector 210 in the base station 200. It is supposed that the base band system of sector 210 is composed of base band chips<br>
310,	320, 330 and a base band logic 305. This is only one concrete example of<br>
embodiments, and in reality, the number of the base band chips can range from one<br>
to many. The outputs 331, 332, 333 of the base band chip 330 correspond to the<br>
outputs of three sectors  αi  ß  in the base band chip 330 respectively, the outputs of 321, 322, 323 of the base band chip 320 correspond to the outputs of<br>
three sectors  αi  ß     in the base band chip 320 respectively, and the outputs of<br>
311,	312, 313 of the base band chip 310 correspond to the outputs of three sectors<br>
αi  ß  in the base band chip 310 respectively. Because the base band chips 330, 320, 310 are step-connected together, the outputs 331, 332, 333 of sector<br>
αi  ß   of the base band chip 330 are step-connected to the inputs of sector<br>
αi  ß  	of the base band chip 320 respectively □ the output 321, 322, 323 of<br>
sector	αi  ß     of the base band chip 320 are step-connected to the inputs of<br>
sector	αi  ß     of the base band chip 310 respectively, that is, the sector<br>
αi  ß     of the base band chips 330, 320, 310 are step-connected together correspondingly.<br>
In said step one of the present invention, with reference to fig.4A,4B, by employing the analog fixed beam-forming network or the digital fixed beam-forming technique, the outputs of the base band system 300 respectively corresponding to the three beams 226, 224 and 222 are made to be 301, 302 and<br>
303 , which correspond to the outputs 311,312 and 313 of sectors     αi  ß     of the base band chip 310 respectively, thereby the base band signals 301, 302, 303 of<br>
fixed beams 226, 224 and 222 are reflected to sectors  αi  ß     of the base band<br>
chip respectively.<br>
In this step, when transmitting in a traffic channel of a user, the transmitting can be made only within certain fixed beam where the user locates, that is, the base band signals of the fixed beams for this user are reflected to one certain corresponding sector of the base band chips.   For example, the traffic channel of a user can be transmitted in the fixed beam 226, its corresponding base band output is 301, and correspondingly, it is reflected to the sector  α   of the base band chips. Surely, if the user locates among several beams, one or several narrow beams can be selected according to strengths of several user signals of beams received to transmit service data of the user, that is, the base band signals of the user is reflected to one or several corresponding sectors of the base band chips.<br>
In this step, if what is transmitted is the common channel of users, this channel<br>
information should be transmitted in every fixed beam, that is, the information of the common channel should be reflected to every sector of the base band chips. Said step two of the present invention, in which base band signals reflected from the fixed beams to the corresponding sectors of the base band chips are made to have different time delays, can be accomplished both in the base band chips and by the digital logic components after the base band chips.<br>
In the situation that the time delay is accomplished in the base band chips, the base band logic 305 is dispensable. As described above, the time delay of the<br>
outputs 301, 302 and 303 of the base band 300 can be  t301 = t302 -t,<br>
t303 = 302      t in which,   t   is one certain time delay selected from 1~5 chips as recited in the above paragraphs, its time precision may be between 1 to 2 chips, for example, it may be one chip, or one and a half chip. Without base band logic 305, at this time, the time offsets of the outputs 311, 312, 313 of the base band chip 310 are consisted with that of the outputs 301, 302, 303 of the base band 300 respectively. Suppose the processing time delay of the base band chips is  , then time offsets of the outputs 321, 322 and 323 of the base band chip 320<br>
aret321 =t302-t- t322 =t302-   and  t323 =t302 + t -   respectively □ and the time offsets of the outputs 331, 332, 333 of the base band chip 330 are t331=t302-t  t332=t302-2   and  t333=t302+t-2   respectively.<br>
The method for performing time delay by the base band logic 305 is similar to the method for performing time adjustment in chips. But, when performing time delay by the base band logic 305, the output time offset of base band chips can only be delayed, but not advanced, moreover, the processing time delay of the base band logic 305 itself also need to be considered. Performing time delay by the base band logic 305 is also in the range of protection of the present invention.<br>
The volume of the time delay should meet the criterion of making the signals<br>
at the output end of each sector of the base band not correlate with one another when transmitting the common channel information.<br>
The purpose of this step is to make the base band signals of the fixed beams forming the common channel of the whole sector not correlate with one another, therefore solving the problem that signals in some area will correlate with and counteract one another or be reduced greatly due to the correlating addition of the beam space vectors when forming the common channel.<br>
It should be noted specially that: the "sector" referred in said step one as the fixed beams reflected to the corresponding "sectors" of the base band chips and the "sector" referred in said step two as forming the common channel of the whole "sector" have different meanings. The former refers to the corresponding sectors in the base band chips, herein is the area covered by the narrow beams, such as 222, 224, 226 shown in fig.2□the latter refers to 220, the area covered by the common channel composed by all the fixed beams.<br>
The method of the present invention of multiple antenna common beam-forming used in CDMA system is also adaptable to the multiple antenna analog fixed beam-forming device of CDMA system and the multiple antenna digital fixed beam-forming device of CDMA system.<br>
Fig.4A shows the smart antenna analog fixed beam-forming device used in CDMA system which comprises a base band system 300, an optical transceiver system composed of an optical interface board 400 close to the base band system and an optical interface board 432 close to the transceiver TRX, and an optical fiber 410 between optical interface board 400 and 432, a transceiver (TRX) system composed of 434, 436 and 438, an analog fixed beam-forming network (such as Butler array) 440, radio frequency links 450 including a power amplifier, a radio frequency front end (transmission filter, reception filter), a low noise amplifier and a feedback line etc., and an antenna system 460. Because the analog fixed<br>
beam-forming network only needs to correct the analog fixed beam-forming network 440, radio frequency link 450 between the analog fixed beam-forming network 440 to the antenna system 460, the antenna system 460, and the radio frequency cables therebetween, the analog fixed beam-forming network 440, antenna system 460 and the radio frequency link 450 between them can be placed on the tower or the holding pole 430, so as to make the radio frequency cables therebetween as short as possible. Thus, the correction becomes easy, and the loss generated in power amplifier outputting power is reduced, therefore the coverage area is increased. The radio frequency cables of the transceiver system 434, 436 and 438 and the radio frequency cables between the above transceiver system to the analog fixed beam-forming network 440 do not need correction.<br>
The outputs 301, 302 and 303 of the base band 300 in the analog fixed beam-forming device 4A pass the optical transceiver system composed of the optical interface board 400 close to the base band system, the optical fiber 410 and the nearby optical interface board 432 of the transceiver TRX, then pass the TRX0, TRX1, TRX2 of transceiver (TRX) system 434,436 and 438, and pass the analog fixed beam-forming network 440, and are finally reflected to beams 226, 224, 222 respectively. The beams formed by the common channel is equivalent to beam 220 added by the fixed beams 226, 224, 222.<br>
Fig.4B shows the smart antenna digital fixed beam-forming device used in CDMA system, which comprises a base band system 300, a digital fixed beam-forming network 470, an optical transceiver system composed of an optical interface board 400 close to the base band system and an optical interface board 432 close to the transceiver TRX, and an optical fiber 410 between the optical interface boards 400 and 432, a transceiver (TRX) system 434, 436 and 438, radio frequency links 450 including a power amplifier, a radio frequency front end (transmission filter, reception filter), a low noise amplifier and a feedback line etc., radio<br>
frequency cables between transceivers 434, 436 and 438 and radio frequency links 450, and an antenna system 460. In the digital fixed beam-forming device, the radio frequency cables of the transceivers (TRX) 434, 436 and 438, the radio frequency links 450 including the power amplifier, the radio frequency front end (transmission filter, reception filter ), the low noise amplifier and the feedback line etc., the radio frequency cables between transceivers 434, 436 and 438 and radio frequency links 450, and the antenna system 460 as well as the the radio frequency cables therebetween.<br>
The outputs 301, 302 and 303 of the base band 300 in the digital fixed beam-forming device 4B are reflected to the beams 226, 224, 222 respectively after passing the digital fixed beam-forming network 470.The beams formed by the common channel is equivalent to beam 220 added by the fixed beams 226, 224, 222.<br>
The smart antenna fixed beam system can further divide the sectors via the narrow beams, by which, compared with the sector none smart antenna system, the capacity of the system is greatly improved. The sharing of one pilot among several beams helps to reduce the interference and frequent handoffs, therefore, the capacity of the system is improved. As shown in fig.2, the single beam sector in fig.l is divided into a sector with 3 beams sharing one pilot, so the capacity of the system is 200□ □ 3 00□D of the original single beam sector.<br>
Fig. 5 is the flowchart for selecting narrow band fixed beams for receiving and transmitting user signals in the sector smart antenna system, which presents an operation flowchart for selecting beams according to the method of comparing the reception signal strength of users. First, receive user signals by all the beams, then compare the strength of reception user signals of each beam, select one or several beams which have the strongest user signals, then receive/transmit the signals. As shown in fig.2, when user 230 moves in sector 210, the base station selects, by comparing the reception signals of the fixed beams 222, 224 and 226, one beam<br>
with the best signal quality or several beams with comparatively good signal quality as reception beams, then combines the signals of each beam together.<br>
Although the present invention takes the situation where 3 antennas generate 3 beams in each sector as a preferred enbodiment, any system formed according to the principle of the present invention by employing more than one antenna and beam for each sector falls into the protection of the present invention.<br>
