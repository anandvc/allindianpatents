METHOD FOR ELECTRODEPOSITION OP BRONZES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention concerns a method for electrodeposition of bronzes, with which the substrate to be coated is plated in an acid electrolyte that contains at least tin and copper ions, an alkylsulfonic acid and a wetting agent, and the preparation of such an electrolyte,<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Methods for deposition of tin and tin alloys on the basis of various types of electrolytes are known from the prior art and are already widely used in practice. Methods for deposition of tin and/or tin alloys from cyanide electrolytes are very common. Such electrolytes, however, are highly toxic, which makes their use problematic from the environmental standpoint, so that for some years there has been a push to develop cyanide-free electrolytes, for example electrolytes based on pyrophosphates or bxalates, which operate in a pH region of 5-9. However, such methods have both economic and technical disadvantages, of which the relatively slow deposition rates may be mentioned here.<br>
For these reasons development is currently going mostly in the direction of making available methods for deposition of tin and/or tin alloys from acid electrolytes, since, for one thing, divalent tin can be very easily reduced to metallic tin in acid electrolytes, which leads to better deposition rates while having qualitatively equivalent coatings, and for another the disadvantageous effect of alkaline electrolytes on substrates, for example ceramic structural elements, is prevented by this.<br>
Thus, acid electrolytes and methods" for deposition of qualitatively high grade tin or tin alloys with a higher<br><br>
deposition rate are known from EP 1 111 097 A2 and US 6,176,996 Bl. These are electrolytes that contain at least two divalent metal salts of an organic sulfonic acid and from which are deposited solderable and corrosion resistant coatings that can be used, for example, as substitutes for lead-containing solderable coatings in electronics for manufacture of circuit boards, etc,<br>
However, such methods have their limits in the deposition of tin-copper alloys with high copper contents, such as the so-called "true" bronzes, which have a copper content of at least 10%. For example, due to the high difference of potential between tin and copper higher rates of oxidation of the divalent tin can occur, due to which it very easily becomes oxidized to tetravalent tin in acid electrolytes. However, in  this form tin can no longer be electrolytically deposited in  an acid and thus is withdrawn from the process, which leads to uneven deposition of the two metals and to a decrease of .the deposition rate. In addition, oxidation to tetravalent tin leads to increased sludge formation, which can prevent stable operation and long lifetime of the acid electrolyte. Moreover, because of such contaminated of a firmly bonding and pore-free coating is no longer guaranteed.<br>
Because of such technical process disadvantages, there is currently no large area of use for electrolytically deposited bronze coatings. Occasionally bronze coatings are used in the jewelry industry as a substitute for expensive silver or allergy-triggering nickel. In the same way methods for electrodeposition of bronzes are also gaining importance in some technical fields, for example in electronics for coating electronic components or in mechanical engineering and/or in process technology for coating bearing overlays and friction layers. However, in this case' chiefly white bronzes or the<br><br>
so-called "false bronzes," whose copper content can be kept quite low due to process conditions, are deposited as nickel substitutes.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, the invention is based on the task of providing a method for deposition of bronzes that, in contrast to the methods known from the prior art, enables uniform deposition of at least tin and copper side by side from an acid electrolyte at considerably higher deposition rates. Moreover, with this method firmly bonding and pore-free bronze coatings with high copper contents as well as various decorative and mechanical properties are said to be deposited.<br>
In addition, an acid electrolyte that can have a high content of divalent copper ions, is stable with respect to oxidation-caused sludge formation, and is both economical and environmentally friendly when used over a long period of time, is to be made available.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The task is solved in accordance with the invention by a method of the kind mentioned at the start, which is characterized by the fact that an aromatic, honlonic wetting agent is added to the electrolyte.<br>
With this invention a method for electrodeposition of bronzes is made available, where an anode of a copper-tin alloy and a cathode are connected to the substrate that is to be coated by means of an electrolyte, and coating takes place by passing a direct current through them. In addition, with the invention an electrolyte that is usable in particular for this method and the coatings that are obtainable by this method are made available.<br><br>
Through the method in accordance with the invention the disadvantages known in the prior art are remedied with the offering of a new electrolyte composition.and in this way considerably better deposition-results are achieved. Moreover, the conduct of the method is made to be simpler and more economical. This, too, is chiefly based on the advantageous composition of the electrolyte. For example, the method is carried out at room temperature, or between 17 and 25°C, and the substrate to be coated is plated in a highly acid environment at a pH 
wetting agent. By increasing the metal content this rate can be raised up to 7 A/dm2 in rack operation and even up to 120 A/dm2 for continuous plants. Thus, usable current densities in a range from 0.1-120 A/dm2 are reached in each case according to plant type.<br>
Surprisingly, the wetting of the surfaces to be plated, above all those of more complex substrates, is considerably improved in particular through the addition of at least one nonionic wetting agent to the electrolyte this advantageously has the result that not only are the considerably higher deposition rates achieved through the use of the method in accordance with the invention, but moreover the coatings produced by the method are uniform and qualitatively high grade, have very good adhesion and are generally pore-free.<br><br>
Another advantage of the nonionic wetting agent that is used is that because of the advantageous wetting properties the electrolyte and/or the substrate in the .electrolyte need to be agitated only a little or even not at all, in order to achieve the desired deposition results, so that additional devices for agitation of the electrolyte can be omitted. In addition, because of the advantageous use of the aromatic nonionic wetting agent, electrolyte residues drain from the plated substrate better when it is removed from the electrolyte, which leads to reduced entrainment losses and thus to lower process costs.<br>
The addition of 2-40 g/L of one or more aromatic nonionic wetting agents is especially advantageous, with beta-naphthol ethoxylate and/or nonylphenol ethoxylate are especially preferred.  Also preferred is sulfopropylated polyalkoxylated naphthol, potassium salt.<br>
The proposed method is therefore advantageously economical and environmentally friendly compared to the cyanide processes<br>
The additional or 'alternative use of one or more anionic and/or aliphatic nonionic wetting'agent that is known from the prior art is also optionally possible,' provided these wetting agents support or even enhance the advantageous effects of the aromatic nonionic wetting agent.  In this regard polyethylene glycols and/or anionic surfactants are preferably added to the electrolyte as anionic and/or aliphatic nonionic wetting agents. Additional exemplary aliphatic nonionic wetting agents include aliphatic fatty alcohol ethoxylates, with compounds having from 13 to 15 carbon atoms (C-13 to C-15) being especially preferred.  In one embodiment, the fatty alcohol ethoxylate is incorporated in a concentration of, for example, about 0.1-to 10 g/L; preferably about 0.5 to about 5 g/L. These compounds work as<br><br>
emulsifiers for the degradation products of the nonionic wetting agent, and improve uniformity and brightness in combination with the wetting agent and brightener system.<br>
It has also been discovered that substituted dithioglycols act advantageously as wetting agents and brighteners.  These compounds provide a source of sulphur which has a positive effect on copper plating. Therefore, certain embodiments of the invention include substituted dithioglycols, such as, for example, those selected from the group consisting of:<br>

In one embodiment, the substituted dithioglycol in incorporated in a concentration'of about 5 to about 100 mg/L; preferably about 10 to about 50 mg/L.<br><br>
As already mentioned above, the method in accordance with the invention is characterized in particular by the special composition of the electrolyte. It contains essentially tin and copper, ions, an alkylsulfonic acid and an aromatic nonionic wetting agent  In addition, stabilizers and/or complexing agents, anionic: and/or nonionic, aliphatic and/or substituted dithioglycol wetting agents, oxidation inhibitors, brighteners, and other metal salts can optionally be contained in the electrolyte.<br>
The metals that are primarily added to the electrolyte for deposition of bronzes in accordance with the invention -tin and copper - can first and foremost be in the form of salts of alkylsulfonic acids, preferably as methanesulfonates, or as salts of mineral acids, preferably as sulfates. Tin methanesulfonate is especially preferably used as tin salt in the electrolyte preferably in an amount of 5-195 g/L of electrolyte, preferably 11-175 g/L of electrolyte. This corresponds to a use of 2-75 g/L, preferably 4-57 g/L divalent tin ions. Copper v methanesulfonate is especially preferably used in the electrolyte as the copper salt, which is advantageously added to the electrolyte in an amount of 8-280 g/L of electrolyte, preferably 16-260 g/L of electrolyte. This corresponds to the use of 2-70 g/L, preferably 4-65 g/L divalent copper ions.<br>
Since the deposition is clearly higher in an acid environment, an acid, preferably a mineral and/or an alkylsulfonic acid, is added to the electrolyte in amounts of 140-382 g/L of electrolyte, preferably 175-245 g/L of electrolyte. The use of methanesulfonic acid turned out to be especially advantageous, 'since for one thing this produces advantageous solubility of metal salts and for another, because of its acid strength, it produces'or facilitates the<br><br>
adjustment of the pH needed for the process. In addition, methanesulfonic acid has the advantageous property of contributing considerably to the stability of the bath.<br>
In accordance with an additional characteristic of the invention at least one additional metal and/or chloride is added to the electrolyte. Advantageously, the metals are in the form of their soluble salts. In particular, the addition of zinc and/or bismuth has a considerable effect on the properties of the deposited coatings. The metals zinc and/or bismuth added to the electrolyte can namely be in the form of salts of alkylsulfonic acids, preferably as methanesulfonates or as salts of mineral acids, preferably as sulfates. Zinc sulfate is especially preferably uses in the electrolytes as zinc salt, and is advantageously added in an amount of 0-25 g/L of electrolyte, preferably 15-20 g/L of electrolyte. Bismuth methane sulfate is especially preferably used in the<br><br>
electrolyte as bismuth salt and is advantageously added to the electrolyte in an amount of 0-5 g/L of electrolyte, preferably 0.05-0.2 g/L of electrolyte.<br>
In addition, various additives, for example stabilizers and/or complexing agents, oxidation,inhibitors and brighteners, that are usually used in acid electrolytes for deposition of tin alloys can be added to the electrolyte.<br>
In particular, the use of suitable compounds for stabilizing the electrolyte is an important condition for rapid as well as qualitative high grade deposition of bronzes. Gluconates are advantageously added to the electrolyte and stabilizers and/or complexihg agents. Here in the method in accordance with the invention the preferred use of sodium gluconate turned out to be especially advantageous. The concentration of the stabilizers and/or complexing agents is 0-50 g/L of electrolyte, preferably 20-30 g/L of electrolyte. Compounds from the class of the<br><br>
dihydroxybenzenes, for example mono- or polyhydroxyphenyl compounds like pyrocatechol or phenolsulfonic acid are preferably used as oxidation inhibitors. The concentration of oxidation inhibitors is 0-5 g/L of electrolyte.  Sodium hypophosphite is optionally used as an additional oxidation inhibitor.  In one embodiment, the electrolyte contains hydroquinone as oxidation inhibitor.<br>
The conduct of the method in accordance with the invention enables the deposition of bronzes onto various substrates. For example, all of the usual methods for making electronic components can be used. In the same way especially hard and wear-resistant bronze coatings can be deposited on materials like bearings, etc. to the method in accordance with the invention. The method in accordance with the invention is advantageously also used in the fields of decorative coating of, for example, fixtures and jewelry, etc., where the deposition of multi-component alloys that contain tin, copper, zinc and bismuth is particularly advantageous in these areas.      ,<br>
A really special advantage is that the so-called "true" bronzes that have a copper content &gt;60% can be deposited with the method in accordance with the invention, where the copper content can be up to 95 wt% in each according to the desired properties. In addition, the ratio of the amount of copper to the amount of tin in the electrolyte has a considerable effect of properties like hardness and color of the bronze coatings. For instance, at a tin/copper ratio of 40/60 silver-colored coatings, the so-called white bronzes, which are relatively soft, are deposited. At a tin/copper ratio of 20/80 yellow gold colored coatings result, the so-called yellow bronzes, and at a tin/copper ratio of 10/90 red gold' colored coatings are formed, the so-called red bronzes.  As illustrated in the examples below, the invention is effective<br><br>
for forming white bronze deposits having a tin/copper weight ratio of about 40/60 or less, yellow bronze deposits having a tin/copper weight ratio of about 20/80 or less, and even red bronze deposits having a tin/copper weight ratio of about 10/90 or less.<br>
Moreover, the deposition of high-tin white bronzes with a copper content = 10% is also possible.<br>
In each case according to the desired appearance of the bronze coatings additives such as brighteners are added to the electrolyte, in addition to it having a varying copper content. Advantageously, the electrolyte contains brighteners from the class of the aromatic carbonyl compounds and/or a a-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The concentration of brighteners is 0-5 g/L of electrolyte.<br>
