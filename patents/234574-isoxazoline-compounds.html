In the framework of this application, alkyl defines straight or branched saturated<br>
hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, for example methyl, ethyl,<br>
propyl, butyl, 1-methylpropyl, 1,1-dimethylethyl, pentyl, hexyl; or alkyl defines cyclic<br>
saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, for example<br>
cyclopropyl, methylcyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. Halo is<br>
generic to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. Alkyl radicals being optionally substituted<br>
with one or more halo atoms are for example polyhaloalkyl radicals, for example<br>
difluoromethyl and trifluoromethyl.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts are defined to comprise the therapeutically active<br>
non-toxic acid addition salts forms that the compounds according to Formula (I) are<br>
able to form. Said salts can be obtained by treating the base form of the compounds<br>
according to Formula (I) with appropriate acids, for example inorganic acids, for<br>
example hydrohalic acid, in particular hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric<br>
acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid ; organic acids, for example acetic acid,<br>
hydroxyacetic acid, propanoic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid,<br>
succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid,<br>
methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic<br>
acid, cyclamic acid, salicyclic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid and pamoic acid.<br>
The compounds according to Formula (I) containing acidic protons may also be<br>
converted into their therapeutically active non-toxic metal or amine addition salts forms<br>
by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salts<br>
forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkaline and earth alkaline metal<br>
salts, in particular lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium salts, salts with<br>
organic bases, e.g. the benzathine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, hybramine salts, and salts<br>
with amino acids, for example arginine and lysine.<br>
Conversely, said salts forms can be converted into the free forms by treatment with an<br>
appropriate base or acid.<br>
The term addition salt as used in the framework of this application also comprises the<br>
solvates that the compounds according to Formula (I) as well as the salts thereof, are<br>
able to form. Such solvates are, for example, hydrates and alcoholates.<br>
The N-oxide forms of the compounds according to Formula (I) are meant to comprise<br>
those compounds of Formula (I) wherein one or several nitrogen atoms are oxidized to<br>
the so-called N-oxide, particularly those N-oxides wherein one or more nitrogens of the<br>
piperazinyl radical are N-oxidized.<br>
The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used hereinbefore defines all the<br>
possible isomeric forms that the compounds of Formula (I) may possess. Unless<br>
otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the<br>
mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all<br>
diastereomers and enantiomers of the basic molecular structure. More in particular,<br>
stereogenic centers may have the R- or S-configuration; substituents on bivalent cyclic<br>
(partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or trans-configuration.<br>
Compounds encompassing double bonds can have an E or Z-stereochemistry at said<br>
double bond. Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of Formula (I) are<br>
obviously intended to be embraced within the scope of this invention.<br>
Following CAS nomenclature conventions, when two stereogenic centers of known<br>
absolute configuration are present in a molecule, an R or S descriptor is assigned (based<br>
on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog sequence rule) to the lowest-numbered chiral center, the<br>
reference center. The configuration of the second stereogenic center is indicated using<br>
relative descriptors [R*,R* J or [R*,S*], where R* is always specified as the reference<br>
center and [R*S*] indicates centers with the same chirality and [R*,S*] indicates<br>
centers of unlike chirality. For example, if the lowest-numbered chiral center in the<br>
molecule has an 5 configuration and the second center is R, the stereo descriptor would<br>
be specified as S-[R*,S*]. If "a" and "(3" are used : the position of the highest priority<br>
substituent on the asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system having the lowest ring<br>
number, is arbitrarily always in the "a" position of the mean plane determined by the<br>
ring system. The position of the highest priority substituent on the other asymmetric<br>
carbon atom in the ring system (hydrogen atom in compounds of Formula® ) relative<br>
to the position of the highest priority substituent on the reference atom is denominated<br>
"a", if it is on the same side of the mean plane determined by the ring system, or "B", if<br>
it is on the other side of the mean plane determined by the ring system.<br>
Compounds of Formula (I) and some of the intermediates have at least two stereogenic<br>
centers in their structure, respectively denoted a and b in Formula (I). Due to the<br>
synthetic pathway followed for the synthesis of the tricyclic system, the configuration<br>
of those two asymmetric centers a and b is predetermined, so that the relative<br>
configuration of center a is S* and of center b is R*.<br>
The invention also comprises derivative compounds (usually called "pro-drugs") of the<br>
pharmacologically-active compounds according to the invention, which are degraded in<br>
vivo to yield the compounds according to the invention. Pro-drugs are usually (but not<br>
always) of lower potency at the target receptor than the compounds to which they are<br>
degraded. Pro-drugs are particularly useful when the desired compound has chemical<br>
or physical properties that make its administration difficult or inefficient. For example,<br>
the desired compound may be only poorly soluble, it may be poorly transported across<br>
the mucosal epithelium, or it may have an undesirably short plasma half-life. Further<br>
discussion on pro-drugs may be found in Stella, V. J. et al., "Prodrugs", Drug Delivery<br>
Systems, 1985, pp. 112-176, and Drugs, 1985,29, pp. 455-473.<br>
Pro-drugs forms of the pharmacologically-active compounds according to the invention<br>
will generally be compounds according to Formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof and the<br>
N-oxide form thereof, having an acid group which is esterified or amidated. Included<br>
in such esterified acid groups are groups of the formula -COOR*, where Rx is a<br>
Chalky], phenyl, benzyl or one of the following groups :<br>
Amidated groups include groups of the formula - CONRyRz, wherein Ry is H,<br>
l, phenyl or benzyl and Rz is -OH, H, Chalky!, phenyl or benzyl.<br>
Compounds according to the invention having an amino group may be derivatised with<br>
a ketone or an aldehyde such as formaldehyde to form a Mannich base. This base will<br>
hydrolyze with first order kinetics in aqueous solution.<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) as prepared in the processes described below may be<br>
synthesized in the form of racemic mixtures of enantiomers that can be separated from<br>
one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of<br>
Formula (I) may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by<br>
reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently<br>
separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are<br>
liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric<br>
forms of the compounds of Formula (I) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral<br>
stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from<br>
the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting<br>
materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific<br>
stereoisomer is desired, said compound would be synthesized by stereospecific<br>
methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically<br>
pure starting materials.<br>
The compounds according to the invention have surprisingly been shown to have<br>
selective serotonine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor activity in combination with additional<br>
cc2-adrenoceptor antagonist activity and show a strong anti-depressant and/or anxiolytic<br>
activity and/or a body weight control activity without being sedative. Also, in view of<br>
their selective serotonine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor as well as a2-adrenoceptor<br>
antagonist activity, compounds according to the invention are also suitable for<br>
treatment and/or prophylaxis in diseases where either one of the activities alone or the<br>

combination with antidepressants, anxiolytics and/or antipsychotics for attenuation of<br>
stress-induced hyperthermia.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the<br>
compounds according to the invention and one or more other compounds selected from<br>
the group of antidepressants, anxiolytics and antipsychotics as well as to the use of such<br>
a composition for the manufacture of a medicament to improve efficacy and/or onset of<br>
action in the treatment of depression and/or anxiety.<br>
In vitro receptor and neurotransmitter transporter binding and signal-transduction<br>
studies can be used to evaluate the a2-adrenoceptor antagonism activity and serotonine<br>
(5-HT) reuptake inhibitor activity of the present compounds. As indices for central<br>
penetration and potency to block the a2-adrenoceptors and serotonin transporters,<br>
respectively, ex vivo a2-adrenoceptor and serotonin transporter occupancy can be used.<br>
As indices of (X2-adrenoceptor antagonism in vivo, the reversal of the loss of righting<br>
reflex, observed in rats after subcutaneous injection or oral dosage of the compound<br>
before intravenous medetomidine administration in rats can be used (medetomidinetest).<br>
As indices of serotonine (5-HT) reuptake inhibition activity, the inhibition of<br>
head-twitches and excitation in rats, observed after subcutaneous injection or oral<br>
dosage of the compound before subcutaneous p-chloroamphetamine administration in<br>
rats can be used (pCA-test).<br>
The invention also relates to a composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier and, as active ingredient, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound<br>
according to the invention. The compounds of the invention or any subgroup thereof<br>
may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As<br>
appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for<br>
systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt<br>
form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms<br>
depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical<br>
compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, in particular, for<br>
administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, by parenteral injection or by inhalation.<br>
For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual<br>
pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils,<br>
alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups,<br>
elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin,<br>
diluents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders,<br>
pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules<br>
represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms in which case solid<br>
pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the<br>
carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other<br>
ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for<br>
example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose<br>
solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also<br>
be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like<br>
may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations that are intended to be<br>
converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable<br>
for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration<br>
enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable<br>
additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a<br>
significant deleterious effect on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the<br>
administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions.<br>
These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch,<br>
as a spot-on, as an ointment.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical<br>
compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage.<br>
Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary<br>
dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated<br>
to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required<br>
pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including<br>
scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, suppositories,<br>
injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can generally be prepared by a succession<br>
of steps, each of which is known to the skilled person.<br>
In particular, the compounds according to Formula (I) with a Pir-radical according to<br>
Formula (Ila) can be prepared by a nucleophilic substitution reaction with a substituted<br>
piperazine according to Formula (V) on an intermediate of Formula (IV). These<br>
reactions may be carried out in a reaction inert solvent such as dioxane,<br>
methylisobutylketone or N,N'-dimethylformamide, in the presence of a suitable base<br>
such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate or triethylamine, or even without a<br>
base, using in this latter case excess of reagent of Formula (V). Convenient reaction<br>
temperatures range between 100°C and 150°C.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In compound (IV), L represents any suitable reactive leaving group, in particular halo,<br>
such as chloro, bromo or iodo or sulfonyloxy, such as methylsulphonyloxy or<br>
4-methylbenzenesulfonyloxy.<br>
The compounds according to Formula (I) with a Pir-radical according to Formula (Ha)<br>
can also be prepared by a 2-step reaction scheme in which an intermediate of Formula<br>
(IV) is first reacted with a substituted piperazine according to Formula (VII) after<br>
which the R3-radical is introduced into the molecule. Reaction conditions are similar to<br>
those described above for compounds of Formula (VI).<br>
 (Figure Removed)<br>
In compound (IV), L represents any suitable reactive leaving group, in particular halo,<br>
such as chloro, bromo or iodo or sulfonyloxy, such as methylsulphonyloxy or<br>
4-methylbenzenesulfonyloxy.<br>
In intermediate compound (VII), one of the nitrogen function may also be protected,<br>
e.g. by a tert-butyloxycarbonyl-group.<br>
(step 2)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In compound (IX), L represents any suitable reactive leaving group, in particular halo,<br>
such as chloro, bromo or iodo or sulfonyloxy, such as methylsulphonyloxy or<br>
4-methylbenzenesulfonyloxy. Also R3"CHO may be used as compound (IX).<br>
The compounds according to Formula (I) with a Pir-radical according to Formula (Ha)<br>
can also be prepared by a 2-step reaction scheme in which an intermediate of Formula<br>
(VET) is reacted with an acid according to Formula (X), followed by a subsequent<br>
reduction of the carbonyl-function of intermediate (XI). Reactions of step 1 may be<br>
carried out in a reaction inert solvent, such as chloroform, dichloromethane,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide or a mixture thereof, using any of methods known<br>
to a person skilled in the art using condensation reagents such as<br>
l,l'-carbonyldiimidazole, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or by previous<br>
transformation of carboxylic acid of Formula (X) into its corresponding acid chloride.<br>
Reactions shown in step 2 can be performed using a suitable reducing agent, such as<br>
lithium-aluminum hydride or aluminum hydride, in a suitable solvent, for example<br>
tetrahydrofuran. Generally, these reactions are run at a temperature ranging between<br>
-20°C and room temperature.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In intermediate compounds (XI) and (XII), the A-group represents an optionally<br>
substituted aromatic homocyclic or heterocyclic ring system including a partially or<br>
completely hydrogenated hydrocarbon chain of maximum 5 atoms long of which one<br>
or more carbon atoms may be replaced by one or more atoms selected from the group<br>
of oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, with which the ring system is attached to the Pir<br>
radical that has been defined above.<br>
The substituents R1 and R2 may be changed or interconverted into each other by<br>
methods well known in the art, such as demethylation, acylation, esterification,<br>
amination and amidation.<br>
The starting materials and some of the intermediates are compounds that are either<br>
commercially available or may be prepared according to conventional reaction<br>
procedures generally known in the art. For example, intermediates of Formula (IV) in<br>
which X=O may be prepared according to the following reaction scheme (Scheme 1):<br>
Scheme 1<br>
In intermediate compound (XIV), L represents any suitable reactive leaving group, in<br>
particular halo, such as chloro, bromo or iodo or sulfonyloxy, such as<br>
methylsulphonyloxy or4-methylbenzenesulfonyloxy. Furthermore, Alk in intermediate<br>
compound (XIV) represents any C1-6alkyl-group, in particular an ethyl-group and m is<br>
defined as in Formula (I).<br>
Intermediates according to Formula (IV) in which X=NH may also be prepared in an<br>
equivalent manner according to above step 1, provided that the intermediate compound<br>
(Xin) is replaced by its amine-analog (XVI), preferably with the amine group protected<br>
with e.g. a COCFa- group. The alkylation step may be carried out in a reaction inert<br>
solvent, for example, tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide, in the presence of a<br>
strong base, such as sodium or potassium hydride, and the addition of a crown-ether,<br>
such as 18-crown-6 or 15-crown-5. Convenient reaction temperatures range between<br>
room temperature and 60°C.<br>
Intermediates of Formula (XVII) are converted to oximes of Formula (XVIQ) using artknown<br>
techniques, such as using hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the presence of<br>
NaHCO3 or pyridine in a reaction inert solvent, for example ethanol. Intermediate<br>
(XVIII) is oxidized to its nitril oxide and undergoes in situ an intramolecular<br>
cycloaddition, yielding compound of Formula (XIX). This oxidation can be carried out<br>
using a sodium hypochlorite solution in the presence of triethylamine in an inert solvent<br>
such as dichloromethane at room temperature. Oxidation can also be performed using<br>
Chloramine-T (N-chloro-4-methyl-benzenesulfonamide, sodium salt), stirring and<br>
heating in a solvent such as refluxing ethanol. At this stage the two stereocenters a and<br>
b of Formula (I) are formed.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Preparation of a compound of Formula (XX) can be achieved using procedures known<br>
in the art, for instance by reduction of the carbonyl compound of Formula (XIX) in the<br>
presence of a suitable reducing agent, for example, sodiumborohydride in a suitable<br>
solvent, such as water, an alcohol, tetrahydrofuran or a mixture thereof, generally at<br>
room temperature.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Intermediate of Formula (IV) can be prepared from intermediate of Formula (XX)<br>
using standard techniques. Thus, reaction with methanesulfonyl chloride or<br>
4-methyIbenzenesulfonyl chloride in the presence of a base, such as triethylamine, in a<br>
reaction inert solvent, for example dichloromethane, at reaction temperatures ranging<br>
between 0°C and room temperature, yields the corresponding sulfonyloxy derivative<br>
intermediate (IV). The corresponding halo-derivative can also be prepared, e.g. treating<br>
intermediate of Formula (XX) with triphenylphosphine, in the presence of<br>
tetrachloromethane, in a reaction inert solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, stirring and<br>
refluxing the mixture.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
It is evident that in the foregoing and in the following reactions, the reaction products<br>
may be isolated from the reaction medium and, if necessary, further purified according<br>
to methodologies generally known in the art such as extraction, crystallization and<br>
chromatography. It is further evident that reaction products that exist in more than one<br>
enantiomeric form, may be isolated from their mixture by known techniques, in<br>
particular preparative chromatography, such as preparative HPLC. Typically,<br>
intermediate compounds (IV) and final compounds according to Formula (I) may be<br>
separated into their enantiomeric forms.<br>
Compounds according to the invention in which X=CHz may be prepared according to<br>
the following reaction scheme (Scheme 2) in which an intermediary compound<br>
according to Formula (V) is first N-alkylated with a dihaloderivative of Formula (XX)<br>
using standard techniques, in the presence or absence of a base and in an inert reaction<br>
solvent, such as chloroform, dichloromethane or 1,2-dichloroethane, and at reaction<br>
temperatures ranging between room temperature and SOT, yielding an intermediate of<br>
Formula (XXI). An aldehyde of Formula (XXEf) was reacted with rerr-butylamine in an<br>
aprotic solvent such as toluene, stirring and heating at reflux temperature with removal<br>
of water using a standard device, such as a Dean-Stark water separator, yielding an<br>
imine of Formula (XXTV). C-alkylation of intermediary compound of Formula (XXIV)<br>
with intermediate of Formula (XXI) can be achieved in the presence of an alkyl-lithium<br>
derivative, such as n-butyllithium, under an inert atmosphere and in a dry inert solvent,<br>
such as tetrahydrofuran, at low temperatures ranging between -78°C and 0°C, yielding<br>
an intermediate of Formula (XXV). The intermediate compound of Formula (XXVI)<br>
may be prepared by reaction of compound of Formula (XXV) with hydroxylamine, in<br>
the presence of a base such as sodium bicarbonate, in a solvent such as a lower alkylalcohol<br>
like ethanol, generally at room temperature. Finally, the oxidation of the oxime<br>
derivative of Formula (XXVI) to its nitril oxide and subsequent in situ cycloaddition to<br>
give compound of Formula (XXVII), may be achieved by similar standard techniques<br>
such as those described above for intermediate of Formula (XVIII) to give compounds<br>
of Formula (XIX).<br>

Example Cl : Binding experiment for qadrenergic receptor subtypes and for<br>
5-HT transporter<br>
General<br>
The interaction of the compounds of Formula (I) with ha2-receptors and H5-HTtransporters<br>
was assessed in in vitro radioligand binding experiments. In general, a low<br>
concentration of a radioligand with a high binding affinity for a particular receptor or<br>
transporter is incubated with a sample of a tissue preparation enriched in a particular<br>
receptor or transporter or with a preparation of cells expressing cloned human receptors<br>
in a buffered medium. During the incubation, the radioligand binds to the receptor or<br>
transporter. When equilibrium of binding is reached, the receptor bound radioactivity<br>
is separated from the non-bound radioactivity, and the receptor- or transporter-bound<br>
activity is counted. The interaction of the test compounds with the receptor is assessed<br>
in competition binding experiments. Various concentrations of the test compound are<br>
added to the incubation mixture containing the receptor- or transporter preparation and<br>
the radioligand. The test compound in proportion to its binding affinity and its<br>
concentration inhibits binding of the radioligand. The radioligand used for hcx2A&gt;<br>
hcc2B and ha-2C receptor binding was [3Hj-raulwolscine and for the h5-HT transporter<br>
was [3H]paroxetine.<br>
Cell culture and membrane preparation.<br>
CHO cells, stabile transfected with human adrenergic-cx2A-, -WIB or OL-IC receptor cDNA,<br>
were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM)/Nutrient mixture<br>
Ham's F12 (ratio l:l)(Gibco, Gent-Belgium) supplemented with 10 % heat inactivated<br>
fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Merelbeke-Belgium) and antibiotics (100 lU/ml<br>
penicillin G, 100 /ig/ml streptomycin sulphate, 110 g/ml pyruvic acid and 100 jig/ml<br>
L-glutamine). One day before collection, cells were induced with 5 mM<br>
sodiumbutyrate. Upon 80-90 % of confluence, cells were scraped in phosphate<br>
buffered saline without Ca2"1" and Mg2+ and collected by centrifugation at 1500 x g for<br>
10 min. The cells were homogenised in Tris-HCl 50 mM using an Ultraturrax<br>
homogenizer and centrifuged for 10 min at 23,500 x g. The pellet was washed once by<br>
resuspension and rehomogenization and the final pellet was resuspended in Tris-HCl,<br>
divided in 1 ml aliquots and stored at -70°C.<br>
Binding experiment for cfe-adrenergic receptor subtypes<br>
Membranes were thawed and re-homogenized in incubation buffer (glycylglycine 25<br>
mM, pH 8.0). In a total volume of 500 n\, 2-10 /ig protein was incubated with<br>
[3H]raulwolscine (NET-722) (New England Nuclear, USA) (1 nM final concentration)<br>
with or without competitor for 60 min at 25°C followed by rapid filtration over GF/B<br>
filter using a Filtermatel96 harvester (Packard, Meriden, CT). Filters were rinsed<br>
extensively with ice-cold rinsing buffer (Tris-HCl 50 mM pH 7.4). Filter-bound<br>
radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting in a Topcount (Packard,<br>
Meriden, CT) and results were expressed as counts per minute (cpm). Non-specific<br>
binding was determined in the presence of 1 M oxymetazoline for h(X2A- and<br>
receptors and 1 /iM spiroxatrine for hccac receptors.<br>
Binding experiment for 5-HT transporter<br>
Human platelet membranes (Oceanix Biosciences Corporation, Hanover, MD, USA)<br>
were thawed, diluted in buffer (Tris-HCl 50 mM, 120 mM NaCl and 5 mM KC1) and<br>
quickly (max 3 s) homogenised with an Ultraturrax homogenizer. In a total volume of<br>
250 uL, 50-100 ug protein was incubated with [3H]paroxetine (NET-869) (New<br>
England Nuclear, USA) (0.5 nM final concentration) with or without competitor for 60<br>
min at 25 °C . Incubation was stopped by rapid filtration of the incubation mixture over<br>
GF/B filters, pre-wetted with 0.1 % polyethyleneamine, using a Filtermatel96 harvester<br>
(Packard, Meriden, CT). Filters were rinsed extensively with ice-cold buffer and<br>
radioactivity on the filters was counted in a Topcount liquid scintillation counter<br>
(Packard, Meriden, CT). Data were expressed as cpm. Imipramine (at 1 p.M final<br>
concentration) was used to determine the non-specific binding.<br>
Data analysis and results<br>
Data from assays in the presence of compound were calculated as a percentage of total<br>
binding measured in the absence of test compound. Inhibition curves, plotting percent<br>
of total binding versus the log value of the concentration of the test compound, were<br>
automatically generated, and sigmoidal inhibition curves were fitted using non-linear<br>
regression. The pICso values of test compounds were derived from individual curves.<br>
All compounds according to formula (I) produced an inhibition at least at the htt2A site<br>
(but often also at the htt2B and ha2C sites) and simultaneously at the 5-HT transporter<br>
site of more than 50 % (pICso) at a test concentration ranging between<br>
1(H-6 M and 10~9 M in a concentration-dependent manner. For a selected number of<br>
compounds, covering most of the various embodiments of Formula (I), the results of<br>
the in vitro studies are given in Table 6.<br>

(5-HT) reuptake inhibition activity.<br>
A. Medetomidine-test<br>
The onset and end of medetomidine (0.10 mg/kg, i.v.)-induced loss of righting was<br>
recorded in overnight-starved Wiga male rats (200-250 g). The intensity of the loss of<br>
righting was scored: 0 = normal behaviour, 1 = slight ataxia, 2 = pronounced ataxia,<br>
3 = loss of righting for a period  5 min.<br>
Under standard conditions, test compound or solvent was administered (s.c. or p.o.) 1 h<br>
before medetomidine. Criterion for drug-induced antagonism: (1) antagonism of loss<br>
of righting: duration = 0 min (1.4% false positive controls; n = 74) (2) reversal of<br>
ataxia: score 
righting reflex over a period longer than 120 min (0% false positives). Centrally acting<br>
tti-adrenoceptor antagonists or behavioural stimulants antagonise the loss of righting ;<br>
sedative compounds may result in prolongation.<br>
The following observations were made : onset of loss of righting (min), end of loss of<br>
righting (min) and intensity of loss of righting (score 0-4). The observations were<br>
performed at 1 h following s.c. (solutions) or p.o. (suspensions) administration,<br>
respectively. Starting dose was 10 mg/kg (References : Berger, U.V., Grzanna, R.,<br>

151-153(1978)).<br>
B. pCA-test<br>
Male Wiga rats were used (body weight: 200 ± 20 g). One hour after administration of<br>
test compound or solvent, a solution of pCA was injected subcutaneously (5 mg/kg ; 10<br>
ml/kg). Forty-five minutes after the pCA injection, head-twitches (HTW) are counted<br>
and the excitation (EXC) were scored over three successive 5 min intervals (starting 45,<br>
50 and 55 minutes after pCA-administration. The scores were given by a trained<br>
observator according to the intensity scale: 0 = absent or doubtful, 1 = present,<br>
2 = pronounced, 3 = maximal. For statistical analysis, the head-twitches counted during<br>
the 15-min observation time were cumulated. For the other phenomena, the median<br>
value of the three 5-min-intervals was used.<br>
Standard observations were performed at 1 h following s.c.or p.o. administration. The<br>
starting dose was in general 10 mg/kg. Doses were initially given to 2 animals. When<br>
both animals show activity for at least one of the observations, the compound was<br>
considered active and testing was repeated at a 4 times lower dose. When activity was<br>
found in only one out of the two animals, an additional animal was tested. When<br>
activity was found in this additional animal, the compound was also considered to be<br>
active and testing was repeated at a 4 times lower dose. In all other cases the<br>
compound was considered inactive at the particular time-route-dose (Reference :<br>

Results<br>
A large number of compounds according to the invention showed a central activity<br>
(minimal effective dose) both in the medetomidine test and in the pCA-test of less than<br>
or equal to 10 mg/kg.<br>
Example C3 : r3SS1GTPyS binding assay<br>
Membranes of the hccaA adrenoceptor expressing CHO cell line were thawed and rehomogenised<br>
in 20 mM Hepes buffer. The incubation medium consisted of: 20 mM<br>
Hepes buffer, pH 7.5,1 jiM GDP, 3 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.25 nM [35S]GTPyS<br>
and 10 u.g protein per well of a 96-well plate. Antagonists and the reference agonist<br>
noradrenaline (3 pM) were added 20 min before the[35S]GTPyS. The incubation (20<br>
min, 37°C) was ended by rapid filtration through GF/B filters and binding quantified by<br>
liquid scintillation counting.<br>
Results<br>
All compounds according to the invention evaluated in the GTPyS binding assay did<br>
not show significant increases of [35S]GTPyS binding to the ha2A receptor up to 10<br>
uM. All compounds evaluated in the assay were able to inhibit noradrenaline-induced<br>
increases of [35S]GTPyS binding, thereby showing their antagonistic nature at this<br>
receptor.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
