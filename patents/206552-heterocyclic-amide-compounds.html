It is known that certain 1-benzylamino-, 1-benzylideneamino- and 1-benzoylaminoimidazoles have pharmacological properties (cf. EP-A-283 857). Use of the substances specified therein as pesticides is, however, not described.<br>
The invention now provides novel compounds of the formula (I)<br><br>

in which<br>
R1 and R2 independently of one another represent hydrogen, alkyl, alkoxyalkyl, alkylthioalkyl, represent optionally substituted cycloalkyl, represent optionally substituted heterocyclyl or, together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached, represent an optionally substituted mono-or bicyclic, carbocyclic or heterocyclic group.<br>
R3 and R4      independently of one another represent aryl or hetaryl, each optionally<br>
substituted. It has additionally been found that the novel compounds of the formula (I) are obtained if compounds of the formula (II)<br><br>

Using, for example, l-amino-4,5-dimethyl-2-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)imidazole and 4-ethylbenzoyl chloride as starting materials, the course of reaction in the process of the invention may be depicted by the following formula scheme:<br><br><br><br>
A general definition of the compounds to be used as starting materials for carrying out the process of the invention is given by the formulae (II) and (HI).<br>
The compounds of the formula (II) are novel with the exception of l-amino-2-phenylimidazole, l-amino-2-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazole, l-amino-2-(4-methoxy-phenyl)imidazole and l-amino-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)imidazole.<br>

As carboxylic-acid-activating reagent (coupling reagent) use is made in the process of the invention of all those suitable for preparing an amide linkage (cf. e.g.: Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie, Volume 15/2; Bodanszky et al., Peptide Synthesis 2nd ed. (Wiley &amp; Sons, New York 1976) or Gross, Meienhofer, The Peptides: Analysis Synthesis, Biology (Academic Press, New York 1979). It is preferred to employ the following methods: active ester method with pentachlorophenol (Pep) and pentafluorophenol (Pfp), N-hydroxysuccinimide, N-hydroxy-5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboxamide (HONB), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) or 3-hydroxy-4-oxo-3,4-dihydro-l,2,3-benzotriazine as alcohol component, coupling with carbodiimides such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) by the DCC additive process, or with n-propanephosphonic anhydride (PPA) and mixed-anhydride method using pivaloyl chloride, ethyl (EEDQ) and isobutyl (DDQ) chloroformate or coupling with phosphonium reagents, such as benzotriazol-l-yloxytris(dimethylaminophosphonium) hexafluorophosphate (BOP), bis(2-oxo-3-oxazolidinyl)phosphonium chloride (BOP-Cl), or with phosphonic ester reagents, such as diethyl cyanophosphonate (DEPC) and diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA) or uronium reagents, such as 2-(lH-benzotriazol-l-yl)-l,l,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU).<br>
As basic reaction auxiliaries for carrying out the process of the invention it is possible to use all suitable acid binders such as amines, especially tertiary amines, and also alkali metal compounds and alkaline earth metal compounds.<br>
Examples thereof that may be mentioned include the hydroxides, oxides and carbonates of lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and barium, and also other basic compounds such as amidine bases or guanidine bases such as 7-methyl-l,5,7-triazabi-cyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (MTBD), diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonene (DBN), diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undecene (DBU), cyclohexyltetra-butylguanidine (CyTBG), cyclohexyltetramethylguanidine (CyTMG), N,N,N,N-tetramethyl-l,8-naphthalenediamine, pentamethylpiperidine, tertiary amines such as triethylamine,   trimethylamine,   tribenzylamine,   triisopropylamine,    tributylamine,<br><br>

The reaction temperatures in the process of the invention may be varied within a relatively large range. It is normal to operate at temperatures between -20°C and 80°C, preferably at temperatures between 0°C and 50°C.<br>
The process of the invention is generally carried out under atmospheric pressure. It is, however, also possible to operate under increased or reduced pressure.<br>
For carrying out the process of the invention the particular requisite starting materials are used generally in approximately equimolar amounts. It is, however, also possible to use one of the two components used in each case in a relatively large excess. It may also be advantageous to operate with 2 or more equivalents of the compound of the formula (HI). In this case the product is predominantly a bisbenzoylated derivative, which in a second step is hydrolytically cleaved to the monobenzoylated derivative. Workup in the processes of the invention takes place in each case in accordance with customary methods (cf. Preparation Examples).<br>
It has also been found that the novel compounds of the formula (I) are obtained if compounds of the formula (VI)<br><br>

Chem. Res. (S) 1999, 620).<br><br>

Plant parts are to be understood as meaning all parts and organs of plants above and below the ground, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material, and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, offshoots and seeds.<br>
The treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active compounds is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on the surroundings, environment or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for<br><br>
example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, also by applying one or more coats.<br>
The active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound and microencapsulations in polymeric substances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is to say liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is to say emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam-formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to employ for example organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Essentially, suitable liquid solvents are: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and also their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, and also water.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are:<br>
for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as highly disperse silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, and also synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize<br><br>
cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam-formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates and also protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are: for example lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, as well as natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the formulations. Other additives can be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be used as such or in their formulations, including mixtures with known fungicides, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides or insecticides, so as, for example, to broaden the spectrum of action or prevent resistances developing. In many cases here, synergistic effects are obtained, i.e. the activity of the mixture is greater than the activity of the individual components.<br>

devices 39A &amp; 39B. Fine particles of spent catalyst and coked adsorbent carried along with hydrocarbon vapors to the reactor 38 are separated using cyclones 40A &amp; 40B.The diplegs of 39A, 39B, 40A &amp; 40B are terminated close to spent catalyst and coked adsorbent bed interface in stripper cum separator 37. As described above, spent catalyst and coked adsorbent mixture collected in stripper cum separator 37 is separated in to two layers 62 &amp; 63 and taken to respective regenerators 44, &amp; 54 for regeneration/reactivation. The cycle of regeneration, feed contaminants removal, cracking reaction followed by gas-catalyst-adsorbent separation and then separation of spent catalyst from coked adsorbent is continued. Though it is not shown in Fig 2, riser 35 employed in the present invention may also be located externally. In such situation, the cyclones are connected to the riser 35 top and the diplegs of these cyclones are connected to stripper cum separator 37 at the interface of catalyst-adsorbent bed.<br>
The present invention also includes recycling of coked adsorbent 63 separated in stripper cum separator 37 directly to riser entry 32 without under going regeneration step via recycle adsorbent stand pipe 60(A) and slide valve 61 is used to control coked adsorbent flow to riser entry 32. Other wise, instead of oxygen containing gas or air, steam is used in adsorbent regenerator 54 for the purpose of keeping fluidization conditions required. This provision is very helpful when calcined petroleum coke is used as an adsorbent. Though not indicated in Fig.2 there is a provision for adding or withdrawing adsorbent and catalyst to/from catalyst regenerator 44 and adsorbent regenerator 54<br>
Fig 3 illustrates the FCC apparatus of the present invention wherein stripper cum separator (7) is employed to perform dual functions, firstly as a conventional stripper and secondly as a separator device to separate catalyst from adsorbent using steam (6) as a stripping/fluidizing media. The superficial velocity of steam in stripper cum separator (7) is maintained in such a way that two distinctly different layers (depending upon the particle size/density of catalyst and adsorbent) i.e. a layer of catalyst and another layer of adsorbent (33 and 32) are formed in stripper cum separator (7).<br><br><br></td>
