				<td>ANNULAR SEALING ASSEMBLY, IN PARTICULAR FOR WHEEL HUBS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an annular seal assembly of the type intended to protect the rolling bearings of a wheel hub from external contaminants, such as water, dust, mud, with which the wheel hub is constantly in contact during the operative life.<br>
In particular, the sealing assembly of the invention is suitable for advantageously equipping a hub bearing unit of a known type, whose hub and spindle functions are performed by the rings of a rolling bearing, which are appropriately flanged so as to receive on one side a wheel of a vehicle and on the other be fastened to the upright of a vehicle suspension.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is known that, in automotive applications, the rolling bearings, in particular those present in wheel hubs, and more in particular those forming the hub bearing unit of the aforesaid type, are continuously exposed, in use, to the contact with high quantities of contaminants: therefore, in such applications, the sealing assemblies used to protect the bearings (incorporated  in  the  bearings  themselves  or,  more<br>
<br>
frequently, belonging to the hub-bearing unit) in addition to the purpose of withholding the lubricant oil or grease within the bearing, above all have the purpose of preventing external contaminants from entering inside the wheel hub and/or the bearing.<br>
Unfortunately, contaminants such as dust and mud, also if blocked by the sealing assembly, tend to blend with the grease lubricating the sealing lips and wear the latter off until they loose their entire sealing capacity. To overcome such drawback, the sealing assemblies known for the described applications present a main radial sealing lip and, more outwards, a dust lip for preserving the main lip from the contact with contaminants.<br>
However, to avoid a rapid wear thereof, the anti-dust lips are usually designed so as to fit with the sealing surface on which the main lip cooperates by interference, with very low interference or even with minor clearance. In this way, however, the lubricant grease possibly placed between the two lips is easily lost outwards and the external contaminants, also if in minimum amount, may come into contact with the main sealing lip and cause consequent wear of the same.<br>
A solution of the problem consists in shaping the<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
anti-dust lip so as to "pump" the contaminants outwards. However, such solution is no longer satisfying in view of the longer life required by the members.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a sealing assembly for demanding applications, for example vehicle wheel hubs, which is capable of ensuring, also in the presence of high doses of external contaminants and preserving, at the same time, a low production cost, a high sealing efficiency and, above all, which is capable of maintaining such high efficiency essentially unvaried also with the progressive wear of the sealing lip.<br>
According to the invention, it is therefore provided a sealing assembly insertable between two relatively rotating members to fluid-tightly seal a compartment defined between said members from an external environment to the compartment itself, as defined in claim 1.<br>
In particular, the sealing assembly comprises a first annular shield presenting an axial sleeve portion for the mounting angularly integral with one of said members, and a flange portion which radially extends from a first end of the sleeve portion; and a sealing member made of elastomeric material presenting an annular root<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
portion which overhangingly and radially extends from a peripheral edge of the flange portion and a first axially sealing annular lip, as well as a second radially sealing annular lip, said lips overhangingly and axially extending on the opposite side of the first end of the sleeve portion, from a same side as a thinned end of the root portion and being reciprocally and divergingly arranged to form in radial section a V-shape having a vertex facing towards the root portion and an axis parallel to the sleeve portion.<br>
The lips present respective V-shaped sealing edges and the first lip also presents a radial seat facing the opposite side of the second lip and accommodating a toroidal spring applying on the first lip an offset radial stress to an elastic hinge defined by the thinned end of the root portion and having centre of rotation arranged on a line crossing the sealing edge of the first lip and forming with a radial plane an angle y in the range from 20° to 60°.<br>
Furthermore, the sealing lips may be slidingly coupled with respective sealing surfaces of a second and third annular shields selectively arrangeable coaxial with the fi.rst shield and having similar dimensions, so that both the second and the third shield can be coupled<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
to a same said first shield.<br>
According to a feature of the invention, finally, the centre of application of said offset radial stress on the first lip is offset also with respect to said V-shaped sealing edge of the first lip, being arranged, with respect to the same, radially displaced closer to the sleeve portion of the first shield.<br>
In this way, the external contaminants can reach the first lip, which forms the main sealing lip, only very difficultly and after a relative long working time because they are withheld by the second lip; furthermore, the wear of the latter does not have direct consequences on.the sealing capacity of the sealing assembly entirely remitted to the first lip, also because the first lip, thanks to its particular geometry, is capable of maintaining a constant and unaltered sealing action also facing relatively high wear of the same.<br>
In practice, the first lip of the sealing assembly of the invention makes, given some differences related to the specific application for which it is intended, a seal similar, according to the characteristics of the sealing edge, to that which can be obtained in sealing assemblies made according to the teachings of EP0980999, which, however,  are  intended  for  an  entirely  different<br>
 <br>
application, i.e. for assembly between a diesel or petrol engine vehicle crankshaft and the crankcase and/or the oil sump, for withholding the oil, i.e. for application in a "clean" environment and at relative high speeds.<br>
According to the invention, instead, a variant of such technology is now applied to a completely different field ("dirty" environment and relatively slow speeds).<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Furthei features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent in the description of the following non-limitative embodiment thereof, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which<br>
-	figure 1 shows an elevational view, in longitudinal radial section, of a first configuration of a sealing assembly made according to the invention;<br>
-	figure 2 shows an elevational view, in longitudinal radial section, of a second configuration of a sealing assembly made according to the invention; and<br>
-	figure 3 schematically shows a hub bearing unit provided with the sealing assemblies in figures 1 and 2.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
With reference to figures from 1 to 3, number 1<br>
 <br>
indicates a sealing assembly insertable in a compartment 2 defined between two relatively rotating members 3,4, in particular the inner 3 and outer 4 rings of a hub bearing unit 5 (figure 3) for vehicles, to isolate the compartment 2 from the outside environment.<br>
The sealing assembly 1 comprises a first annular shield 10 presenting an axial sleeve portion 11 for angularly and integrally mounting with one of said members, in the case in point with the outer ring 4, and a flange portion 12 which radially extends from a first end 13 of the sleeve portion 11.<br>
The sealing assembly 1 further comprises a sealing member 15 integrally carried by the shield 10 and made of elastomeric material (for example a natural or synthetic rubber) presenting an annular root portion 16 which radially and overhangingly protrudes from a peripheral edge 18 of the flange portion 10, a first axial sealing annular lip 20 and a second radial sealing axial lip 21.<br>
Lips 20 and 21 axially and overhangingly extend on the opposite side of end 13 of the sleeve portion 11, from a same side as a thinned end 23 of the root portion 16 and are reciprocally and divergingly arranged to form in radial section a V-shape having a vertex facing towards the root portion 16 and an axis parallel to the<br>
 <br>
sleeve portion 11.<br>
Each of the lips 20,21 presents respective V-shaped sealing edges 30,31 and lip 20 also presents a radial seat 32 facing the opposite side of lip 21 and accommodating a toroidal spring 33 mounted so as to apply on lip 20 a radial stress, indicated by the arrow in figures 1 and 2, offset to an elastic hinge defined by the thinned end 23 of the root portion 16 and having centre of rotation R arranged on a line T crossing the sealing edge 30 of lip 2 0 (indicated by a dash-dotted line in figure 1) and forming with a radial plane an angle y   in the range from 20° to 60°.<br>
According to a feature of the invention, the sealing lips 20,21 are slidingly engageable, by means of V-shaped edges 30,31, with respective sealing surfaces 40,41 of either a second annular shield -580 (figure 1) or a third annular shield -580' (figure 2), both selectively arrangeable coaxial with the shield 10 and having similar dimensions.<br>
The centre of application, indicated by C in figures 1 and 2, of the mentioned offset radial stress applied by the spring 33 on the lip 20 is, according to a further feature of the invention, offsetly arranged with an offset equal to "e", also with respect to the V-shaped<br>
 <br>
sealing edge 30 of the lip/ 20, in the sense that it is arranged in a displaced position radially closer to the sleeve portion 11 of the first shield 10 with respect to the sealing edge 30. By effect of the doubly offset position of point C with respect both to point R and edge 30, the pure axial component of the stress applied by the spring 33 to the lip 20 does not cross the edge 30; consequently, an oblique resultant forming an angle with the sleeve portion 11 will cross the same in use.<br>
The lips 20,21 are delimited towards the thinned end 23 of the annular root portion 16, and on the opposite side, by respective annular grooves  50,51 having semicircular profile in radial section, which equally delimit and define the thinned end 23; the centre of rotation R of the elastic hinge defined by such tapered end 23 of the annular root portion 16 is chosen so as to be found at the intersection of opposite lines tangent to the profile of the grooves 50,51, schematically indicated in figure 2 by broken lines.<br>
The sealing member 15 further presents a third lip 60, shaped as an anti-dust lip, which extends in direction opposite to lip 20 and on the same side as lip 21, overhangingly from the root portion 16; the latter extending also overhangingly and obliquely with respect<br>
 <br>
to the flange portion 12, from the edge 18, in the same direction as the second lip 21 so that, in radial direction, the root portion 16 and the lips 20, 21 and 60 essentially form an X-shape, having the centre of rotation R for the lip 20 essentially arranged in the middle of the X-shape.<br>
With reference to figures 1 and 2, the first shield 10 may be coupled, according to an aspect of the invention, either with a second annular shield 80, forming a sealing assembly of configuration la (figure 1) , or with a third annular shield 80' forming a sealing assembly of configuration lb (figure 2).<br>
Both shields 80 and 80' each present in radial section an essentially L-shape comprising a sleeve portion 81 for an assembly angularly integral with the other of said members, in the case in point the inner ring 3, and a flange portion 82,82', arranged in use facing and opposite the respective sleeve 11 and flange 12 portions of the first shield 10.<br>
The lips 20 and 21, as it is schematically shown off-scale in figures 1 and 2 (in which lips 20,21 are shown in undeformed configuration), slidingly cooperate with a predetermined interference, respectively, with the flange portion 82,82'  and the sleeve portion 81 of,<br>
 <br>
selectively, either the second shield 80 or the third shield 80' .<br>
In both cases, the sleeve portion 81 of the shield 80,80' presents on the opposite side of the respective flange portion 82,82', an edge 85 folded towards the flange portion 12 of the first shield 10, shaped so as to form in use a centrifuge element or flinger of contaminants possibly present in the environment outside the space 2 and dimensioned so as to shield the third anti-dust lip 60 towards said outer environment, so as to protect it.<br>
The flange portion 82 of the second shield 8 0 includes, on the side opposite the first shield 10, an essentially flat metallic armature 90 carrying a magnetic elastomeric ring 91 defining a phonic wheel.<br>
Conversely, the flange portion 82' of the third shield 80' is defined by a coined metallic armature 92 presenting a U-shaped fold at the sleeve portion 81 and a L-shaped fold at its peripheral edge, so as to present the same axial dimensions as the flange portion 82 of the second shield 80, so that the second and third shields can both either be coupled to the same first shield 10.<br>
Thanks to the structure described in detail, by performing a mathematical and geometrical breakdown of<br>
 <br>
the forces acting on lip 20 it is possible to demonstrate that the load S (figure 2) acting on the sealing edge 30 is oblique and essentially independent of the width of the area actually in contact between the edge 30 and the surface 40, both of minor axial variations of positions of the edge 30, whereby the sealing action is maintained essentially constant also with the progressive wear of the lip 20.<br>
