				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the wireless communication technology. Further, this invention relates to the security of mobile communication devices. More particularly, the invention relates to a method for stolen mobile phone tracking using missed call information.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
The present technologies for the purpose relate to stolen mobile tracking systems and how the stolen mobile information is shared between some predefined set of mobile numbers using Short message or email transmission. Current technologies use short message service or email services in order to intimate newly changed SIM card information and current IMSI, old MSISDN number and IMSI along with cell &amp; location information. However there are chances for the new inserted SIM card to be void of currency. In that case the such technologies do not serve the purpose.<br>
In order to better comprehend the current technologies, US patent numbered US 5862472 entitled “Circuit for indicating loss of portable telephone and control method thereof is incorporated hereunder by reference. The said patent describes a circuit and method for a portable telephone which prevents a finder from exploiting the interests of the owner if the telephone becomes lost. The<br><br>
method contemplates the steps of: generating an audible alarm and a first message requesting input of a predetermined password when one of a predetermined time period elapses and a number of outgoing calls exceeds a predetermined number after an alarm function is enabled; detecting whether the predetermined password is input, and stopping generation of the alarm and the first message when the predetermined password is input; generating a second message indicating how an owner of the portable telephone can be contacted and activating a loss mode of the portable telephone when the predetermined password is not input; and automatically dialing a telephone number corresponding to the owner when a predetermined key on the portable telephone is input after the loss mode is activated. However, the authentication process is carried out by password entry and not by comparing IMSI number. The mobile phone in the patent publication does not automatically dial the owner's number, but waits for the user to dial any number to initiate dialing of the owner's number. Also, this patent publication does not describe the transmission of mobile location.<br>
Another US patent numbered US20030087627 titled “Wireless device temporary recovery mode services and functionality”, describes a method where a lost or stolen wireless device is restricted by the activation of a temporary recovery mode service by their service provider pursuant to a call from the subscriber on another phone. The temporary recovery mode service permits the user to select any one of a plurality of possible temporary recovery mode options. Preferably, the temporary recovery mode options limit or entirely restrict further expense incurred by the use of the wireless device until it is found and the recovery service is<br><br>
deactivated. Exemplary temporary recovery mode options include allowing the missing wireless device, e.g., to only receive calls, to allow local outgoing calls only, etc. Another temporary recovery mode option allows full functionality only until the monthly plan allotment of free minutes is used up, and then automatically disables use of the wireless device, or then automatically allows only calls to be received, only local calls to be made, only calls to certain telephone numbers to be made, etc. However, the wireless device in the patent publication does not automatically send user information to the owner. Moreover, the authentication is done with the service provider and not within the lost device using IMSI number<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the proposed invention is to introduce a method for mobile phone tracking using missed call information, which is novel.<br>
Another object of the proposed invention is to provide a mobile tracking method without the new user getting informed of the reduction in currency as in the short message mobile tracking method.<br>
The proposed invention relates to tracking of stolen mobile from the information received from the missed call. The technique enables owner to track his lost mobile device. The mobile device has a provision to store the IMSI number of the original SIM card, and a set of predefined mobile numbers. In case the mobile is<br><br>
lost or stolen, and the SIM card is changed, the tracking feature compares the IMSI number of the new card with the pre stored IMSI number When there is a mismatch, the mobile device automatically sends missed calls to the stored numbers. The recipient device decodes the received missed call to retrieve the new MSISDN and location information of the lost device. This enables the owner to trace the lost mobile device.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method of tracking stolen mobile phone through missed call information comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	enabling stolen mobile tracker feature;<br>
(b)	generating the missed call on mobile originated side; and<br>
(c)	handling the missed call to track the mobile on mobile terminated side.<br>
Enabling the stolen mobile tracker feature involves powering on the mobile and enabling the stolen mobile tracker application. Enabling the stolen mobile tracker feature involves getting the predefined numbers from the user also it involves storing the SIM, MSISDN, IMSI and the predefined numbers to the internal non¬volatile memory. Enabling the stolen mobile tracker feature involves the user setting passwords for the protection of the tracking application and also involves checking whether the inserted SIM is the same with which the SMTF is enabled and is done as soon as the mobile is switched on.<br>
Generating the missed call on mobile originating side involves forwarding the mobile tracking short message with the old MSISDN, new MSISDN, old IMSI, new<br><br>
IMSI and current cell ID information if the inserted SIM is not the same with which the SMTF is enabled. Generating the missed call on mobile originating side involves forming the user-user information IEI and filling the user-user information IEI in a call set up message with the stolen mobile tracking information and also involves triggering the missed call using the generated call set up message to the pre-defined set of numbers.<br>
Handling the missed call to track the mobile on mobile terminated side involves receiving the call set up indication with stolen mobile tracking information in user-user information. Handling the missed call to track the mobile on mobile terminated side involves decoding the short message information passed in user-user information and informing the mobile location information to the user. Handling the missed call to track the mobile on mobile terminated side involves passing the short message information to the Ul for display of SMTF information.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1  shows the flow chart depicting the various steps  involved while registering the feature of the present invention.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows a flow chart with the various steps used for the generation of Missed Call on Mobile Originating side.<br>
Figure 3 shows the flow chart with the various steps at the mobile terminating side while receiving the information.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The proposed invention relates to tracking of stolen mobile from the information received from the automatically generated missed call of the lost handset. With the new approach, the mobile tracking information can be passed to the pre-<br><br>
defined set of numbers by just giving a missed call internally without the knowledge of the current user.<br>
Figure 1 shows the flow chart depicting the various steps involved while registering the feature. The user can enable the stolen mobile tracking application as soon as the mobile is switched on wherein the user will be provided with the option of entering the set of numbers to which the missed call should be made. The user can also store the SIM, MSISDN, and IMSI to the internal non-volatile memory and can protect the tracking application with a password.<br>
Referring to Figure 2 it shows a flow chart with the various steps used for the generation of Missed Call on Mobile Originating side. As soon as the mobile is switched on, the system checks whether the inserted SIM is the same with which the SMTF is enabled. If it is the same, then no further tracking procedure is enabled otherwise the mobile tracking short message will be formed with the old MSISDN, new MSISDN, old IMSI, new IMSI and current cell ID information. Then with the stolen mobile tracking information it forms the user-user information I El and fills the user-user information IEI in a call set up message. Later on it triggers the missed call using the generated call set up message to the pre-defined set of numbers.<br><br>
Figure 3 shows the flow chart with the various steps at the mobile terminating side while receiving the information. It receives the call set up indication with stolen mobile tracking information in user-user information. It decodes the short message information passed in user-user information and inform the mobile location information to the user. Mobile location information will be coded in a proper format so that destined UE can also decode the information in the same format. It passes the short message information to the Ul for display of SMTF information.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the, present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br>

The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The proposed invention relates to tracking of stolen mobile from the information received from the automatically generated missed call of the lost handset. With the new approach, the mobile tracking information can be passed to the pre-<br><br>
defined set of numbers by just giving a missed call internally without the knowledge of the current user.<br>
Figure 1 shows the flow chart depicting the various steps involved while registering the feature. The user can enable the stolen mobile tracking application as soon as the mobile is switched on wherein the user will be provided with the option of entering the set of numbers to which the missed call should be made. The user can also store the SIM, MSISDN, and IMSI to the internal non-volatile memory and can protect the tracking application with a password.<br>
Referring to Figure 2 it shows a flow chart with the various steps used for the generation of Missed Call on Mobile Originating side. As soon as the mobile is switched on, the system checks whether the inserted SIM is the same with which the SMTF is enabled. If it is the same, then no further tracking procedure is enabled otherwise the mobile tracking short message will be formed with the old MSISDN, new MSISDN, old IMSI, new IMSI and current cell ID information. Then with the stolen mobile tracking information it forms the user-user information I El and fills the user-user information IEI in a call set up message. Later on it triggers the missed call using the generated call set up message to the pre-defined set of numbers.<br><br>
Figure 3 shows the flow chart with the various steps at the mobile terminating side while receiving the information. It receives the call set up indication with stolen mobile tracking information in user-user information. It decodes the short message information passed in user-user information and inform the mobile location information to the user. Mobile location information will be coded in a proper format so that destined UE can also decode the information in the same format. It passes the short message information to the Ul for display of SMTF information.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the, present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br>
