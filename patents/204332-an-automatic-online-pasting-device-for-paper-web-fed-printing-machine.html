DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS THEREOF<br>
The present invention discloses a n automatic online pasting device for a web fed printing machine.<br>
An automatic on line pasting device comprises of a wheel assembly (1) having atleast a first wheel (1a) and a second wheel (1b) wherein preferably, the first wheel (1a) is relatively larger than the second wheel (1b). The wheel assembly (1) is mounted on a main clamp (2) in inclined position preferably with first wheel (1a) on the upper side, using bush and bearing in the centre of both the wheels such that the first wheel (1a) is set in light pressure contact with the second wheel (1b). The second wheel (1b) is driven by the first wheel (1a) wherein the first wheel (1a) is driven by the friction contact of the web paper (15) being fed from<br><br>
the printing machine (not shown). An adhesive (4) is supplied to the second wheel (1b) with the help of an adhesive supply tube (3) provided above the second wheel (1b). As the second wheel (1b) receives the drop of adhesive (4) continuously, and is driven by the first wheel (1a), the transfer of adhesive takes place from the second wheel (1b) to the first wheel (1a) and automatically to the web paper (15) which is set in contact with the first wheel (1a).<br>
Walls (5) are provided on either side of said wheel assembly (1) so that the adhesive (4) does not splash on the web paper (15). An over flow drain tray (6) is provided at the bottom of the said wheel assembly (1) having an outlet (7). A vertical clamp (8) is connected to the wheel assembly (1) by means of a threaded bolt (9) which is integral part of wheel assembly (1) along with the spring (10). The threaded bolt (9) is mounted through the vertical clamp (8) at lower end with nut (11) on the end.<br>
A grub screw (12) is provided on upper side of the said vertical clamp (8) for mounting and fixing the said wheel assembly (1) on the existing bars of the web fed printing machine (not shown). A slide (13) is provided below the said wheel assembly to fix the position and avoid the play.<br>
An in built recess tank (14) is below the smaller wheel such that the smaller wheel is partly dipped in the tank with adhesive (4) which ensures the supply of adhesive (4) to the second wheel (1b), in case of the supply of adhesive from the adhesive supply tube (3) trips.<br><br>
