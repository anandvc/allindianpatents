METHOD FOR REQUESTING DOMAIN TRANSFER AND<br>
TERMINAL AND SERVER THEREOF<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Solution<br>
The present application claims the priority benefits of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/765,212 filed on February 6, 2006 and Korean Patent Applications Nos.<br>
10-2006-0116575 and 10-2006-0135622 respectively filed on November 23, 2006 and<br>
December 27,2006 in Republic of Korea. The entire contents of these applications are<br>
herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>
The present invention relates to a Voice Call Continuity (VCC), and more par-<br>
ticularly, to requesting a domain transfer in the VCC.<br>
In general, a Voice Call Continuity (VCC) refers to a type of application, namely, a<br>
home IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) application which is capable of transporting<br>
voice calls between a CS (Circuit Switching) domain and an IMS domain. The VCC<br>
provides functions of voice call originations, voice call terminations, a domain<br>
selection and a domain transfer from the CS domain to the IMS domain or vice versa.<br>
Here, the domain transfer refers to transferring access legs for voice calls toward a user<br>
equipment (UE) (i.e., a terminal) from the CS domain to the IMS domain or vice versa<br>
during an active session. The access leg denotes a call control leg between a VCC UE<br>
and a Domain Transfer Function (DTF) of an VCC application (server).<br>
Through the domain transfer procedures, a service continuity for one or more voice<br>
calls/sessions is provided between the IMS domain and the CS domain while the VCC<br>
UE maintains the one or more voice calls/sessions.<br>
Generally, a domain transfer for a certain voice call/session from the CS domain to<br>
the IMS domain or vice versa is initiated only when a DTF is positioned on a signal<br>
path of the voice call/session setup. For this, positioning of the DTF on the way of the<br>
signal path of the voice call/session setup is referred to as anchoring in IMS or<br>
anchoring.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a general architecture of a network for providing a VCC service.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 1, a VCC UE 10 denotes all types of terminals which support<br>
the VCC service. The VCC UE can access CS and PS (packet switching) domains.<br>
That is, when accessing the CS domain, the VCC UE uses a UE-CS (not shown)<br>
provided therein, whereas the VCC UE uses a UE-IMS (not shown) provided therein<br>
when accessing the PS domain.<br>
A VCC application 30 is an application server for providing the VCC service, and is<br><br>
constituted with entities which perform a series of functions. The series of functions<br>
majrinclude functions required to setup voice calls toward the VCC UE, and functions<br>
required to switch an access leg of the VCC UE between the CS domain and the IMS<br>
domain while maintaining (performing) an active session. For instance, the series of<br>
functions can be a Domain Transfer Function 30a, a Domain Selection Function 30d, a<br>
CS Adaptation Function 30b, and a CAMEL Service Application 30c. Detailed ca-<br>
pabilities and operations for the series of functions are described in 3GPP TS 23.206<br>
V1.2.0.<br>
Generally, the CS domain entities include a Visited Mobile Switching Center<br>
(VMSC), a Gateway MSC (GMSC), a gsmSCF, and the like. The IMS domain entities<br>
include a P-CSCF, a S-CSCF, a I-CSCF and a Media Gateway Control Function<br>
(MGCF).<br>
Fig. 2 is a signal flowchart among each component of a network (e.g., the network<br>
shown in Fig. 1) in a case where a domain transfer occurs between the IMS domain<br>
and CS domain. Hereinafter, domain transfer procedures in a VCC service according to<br>
a background art will be explained with reference to Fig. 2.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, it is just a VCC UE which initiates a domain transfer in a VCC.<br>
That is, the VCC UE establishes a voice call (or session) over the CS domain or IMS<br>
domain with a network, and then may decide whether or not to initiate a domain<br>
transfer by moving (or transferring) from one domain to another domain. By doing<br>
this, the established voice call (so-called "ongoing call"), may continue on the way of<br>
handing over (i.e., domain transfer) from the CS domain to the IMS domain or vice<br>
verse. Here, for initiating (performing) a domain transfer for the voice call from one<br>
domain (e.g., IMS domain) to another domain (e.g., CS domain), the VCC UE may<br>
initiate the domain transfer based on previously-stored information. Here, the in-<br>
formation previously stored in the VCC UE may include radio conditions of a CS<br>
network to access, operator policy, user preferences, and the like.<br>
Procedures (1) ~ (4) of initiating, by the VCC UE, a domain transfer from a CS<br>
domain to an IMS domain according to the background art are as follows:<br>
(1)	The VCC UE may decide to initiate a domain transfer for a voice call which has<br>
been originated and is ongoing toward the CS domain, namely, an outgoing call.<br>
(2)	When the VCC UE sends an INVITE message to a VCC application, a Domain<br>
Transfer Function (DTF) in the VCC application establishes an IMS session leg for the<br>
voice call over the IMS domain.<br>
(3)	After the IMS session leg is established between the DTF and the IMS domain,<br>
the DTF routs the ongoing session to the IMS domain.<br>
(4)	After routing the ongoing session to the IMS domain, a CS session leg is<br>
released.<br><br>
Thus, the domain transfer for the voice call is initiated from the CS domain to the<br>
_MS domain through the procedures of (1) ~ (4).<br>
For the domain transfer in the VCC, only the VCC UE can initiate the domain<br>
transfer in the current VCC by taking into account certain criteria (e.g., user<br>
preferences, operator policies, etc.). Therefore, according to the background art, there<br>
is no way for the network (e.g., VCC application) to initiate a domain transfer based<br>
upon a current network state, a data load of a specific node, a sustainable QoS (Quality<br>
of Service), or the location of the VCC UE.<br>
Further, the network may want to reduce traffic or stop the flow of traffic over a<br>
specific domain during a certain time duration for maintenance or upgrading of the<br>
network. In this case, according to the background art, there is no method for the<br>
network to allow (or request) the VCC UE to initiate the domain transfer for a current<br>
call over a specific domain (i.e., over the CS domain or IMS domain).<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to request, by a network (e.g.,<br>
VCC application), a terminal (e.g., VCC UE) to initiate a domain transfer according to<br>
a network state or other reasons.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a method and device for<br>
requesting a domain transfer, which address the limitations and disadvantages<br>
associated with the background art<br>
To achieve these and other objects according to the present invention, there is<br>

related information, to determine whether to initiate a domain transfer of a call based<br>
on the evaluation result, and to selectively initiate the domain transfer based on the de-<br>

present invention.<br>
The present invention is applied to a Voice Call Continuity (VCC) in 3GPP(3rd<br>
Generation Partnership Project) , but it may be applicable to other communication<br>
fields.<br>
Substantially in the present invention, first, a network server (e.g., VCC application<br>
server) transfers to one or more UEs (i.e., terminal(s)) a message which includes in-<br>
formation related to a domain transfer request (this information is also referred to as<br>
domain transfer related information). The domain transfer related information can<br>
include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: domain transfer level in-<br>
formation (information regarding a level (or class) of a domain transfer request),<br>
network state information (information regarding a network state or the like),<br>
evaluation information (information regarding an evaluation (or analysis) of a domain<br>
transfer request made by an external node or internal module of the network server or<br><br>
the like), etc. The message including the domain transfer related information can<br>
include other information, and can be a message for other purpose.<br>
Second, the UE receives the message including the domain transfer related in-<br>
formation from the network server, and decides whether or not to initiate (perform) the<br>
domain transfer with respect to a call (e.g., an ongoing call or any subsequent call)<br>
based upon the information. The UE according to the present invention decides<br>
whether or not to initiate the domain transfer with respect to the calls based upon the<br>
domain transfer related information alone, or upon the domain transfer related in-<br>
formation with at least one of operator policy and user preferences. However,<br>
considering all of the operator policy, user preferences that the UE itself has as well as<br>
the received domain transfer related information is preferred.<br>
Hereinafter, terms preferably used to describe the present invention will be defined.<br>
A UE according to the present invention may include all types of terminals which<br>
can be used for the VCC service. For instance, the UE according to the present<br>
invention comprehensively includes mobile communications terminals (e.g., UEs,<br>
mobile phones, cellular phones, DMB phones, DVB-H phones, PDAs, PTT, etc.),<br>
digital TV sets, GPS navigation devices, portable game machines, MP3, other home<br>
appliances, and the like.<br>
User preferences denotes information (or parameter) for defining information<br>
related to a domain selection (or domain transfer) which indicates what domain the UE<br>
user prefers to use for ongoing calls (e.g., incoming or outgoing calls) when the UE (or<br>
terminal) is available over both the CS domain and IMS domain.<br>
Operator policy denotes information related to a network state or a network<br>
management. The operator policy may frequently be updated depending on the<br>
network state or for the network management. The updated operator policy may<br>
include information for requesting a domain transfer for ongoing calls (or subsequent<br>
calls), and/or information on a domain preferred by the network for the domain<br>
transfer.<br>
An ongoing call denotes a call in progress between a UE and a VCC application,<br>
which includes all of the incoming or outgoing calls. The present invention is<br>
applicable to ongoing calls, but is not limited thereto and can be applied to subsequent<br>
calls.<br>
A 'V3 interface' used in the present invention preferably denotes an interface for a<br>
mutual information transfer between a UE and a VCC application. For instance, the V3<br>
interface is shown as 20 in Fig. 1 as an example. The V3 interface may be include a Ut<br>
interface, and an OMA DM (device management). That is, an information transfer<br>
from the UE to the VCC application can be achieved by use of the Ut interface,<br>
whereas an information transfer from the VCC application to the UE can be achieved<br><br>
by use of the DM using a DM method. As another example, the V3 interface method<br>
may include an unstructured supplementary service data (USSD) method. The Ut<br>
interface, the DM method and the USSD method are known in the art. A protocol of<br>
the V3 interface may exemplarily be a HTTP, which has a XML format.<br>
Hereinafter, constructions and operations of the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawing.<br>
Fig. 3 is a signal flowchart between a UE 100 and a VCC application 300 for<br>
requesting a domain transfer for a call in accordance with one embodiment of the<br>
present invention. This method can be implemented in the network architecture of Fig.<br>
1 or in other suitable architecture. For instance, the UE 100 and the VCC application<br>
200 of Fig. 3 can be respectively the UE 10 and the VCC application 30 of Fig. 1.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, a call is currently in progress (i.e., ongoing call) between the<br>
UE 100 and the VCC application 300 over the CS domain or IMS domain (S1). Here,<br>
it is assumed in Fig. 3 the ongoing call is in progress over the CS domain. The ongoing<br>
call may denote a call which has been initiated in the CS domain, but it may also be a<br>
call which was initiated in the IMS domain and has been transferred to the CS domain.<br>
During the ongoing call in progress between the UE 100 and the VCC application<br>
300, the VCC application 300 (i.e., a type of network server) receives from an external<br>
node (e.g., a node that controls operator policy, a node that controls mobility<br>
management, etc.) a request (or signal, information, or the like) for requesting a<br>
domain transfer from a current domain (e.g., the CS domain) to another domain (e.g.,<br>
the IMS domain) with respect to a call placed by a specific user (i.e., a user of the UE)<br>
(S2). As a variation, the VCC application 30 can receive this request from an internal<br>
module (e.g., 30a, 30b, 30c, 30d, or other in Fig. 1) of the VCC application 300.<br>
The domain transfer request made by the network (e.g., from the external node or<br>
internal module) in step S2 may be made by several reasons, for example, maintenance<br>
of a network, traffic load of a specific node in the network, control related to operator<br>
policy, or the like. The domain transfer request may be specifically made to apply to<br>
one (single) terminal which a certain VCC subscriber is using, or to a certain group<br>
(e.g., other VCC subscribers) of terminals, or may be non-specifically made to apply to<br>
multiple subscribers (e.g., terminals used by the multiple subscribers).<br>
In step S2, as mentioned above, the domain transfer request may not only be<br>
transmitted from the network (i.e., the external node) to the VCC application 300, but<br>
can also be made (triggered) based upon a specific internal state of the VCC ap-<br>
plication 300. For instance, in order to regulate or maintain a traffic with respect to the<br>
VCC application 300, or perform the operator policy related to the domain transfer, for<br>
example, a certain entity or module)(e.g., a domain transfer function module, a domain<br><br>
selection function module, etc.) provided in the VCC application, 300 may transmit a<br>
domain transfer request to a processing unit (e.g., a controller) constructed in the VCC<br>
application 300 for processing the domain transfer request signal. When the VCC ap-<br>
plication 300 receives the domain transfer request (or signal) from the network (e.g.,<br>
the external node) or its internal component (e.g., a certain entity therein), the VCC ap-<br>
plication 300 performs an analysis or evaluation of the domain transfer request (S3).<br>
Information obtained from this evaluation can be referred to as evaluation information,<br>
which can be included in the message sent from the VCC application to the UE in S4<br>
to be discussed later.<br>
In Step S3, for instance, the VCC application 300 evaluates the domain transfer<br>
request under a previously defined condition, e.g., radio attachment state of the<br>
terminal, media type of the ongoing call, etc. (i.e., it checks whether the requested<br>
domain transfer is appropriate for the ongoing call of the UE 300 from the VCC ap-<br>
plication side). Here, the previously defined condition denotes information related to<br>
the domain transfer, the information stored in a certain entity provided in the VCC ap-<br>
plication or a certain external entity. In other words, the VCC application 300 analyzes<br>
or evaluates whether or not a message including domain transfer related information<br>
should be generated and/or transmitted to the UE according to the domain transfer<br>
request. Here, the domain transfer request may be specific for a terminal which a<br>
certain subscriber is using or for terminals which a certain group of subscribers are<br>
using.<br>
Then in step S4, the message including the domain transfer related information is<br>
sent from the VCC application 300 to one or more UEs 100. The domain transfer<br>
related information includes domain transfer level information, and can further include<br>
at least one of network state information and evaluation information. The domain<br>
transfer related information is now discussed in more detail.<br>
In step S3, when the VCC application 300 evaluates the domain transfer request, it<br>
decides (or evaluates) what level (or class) the domain transfer request should be<br>
assigned to and generates the domain transfer level information indicating the level of<br>
domain transfer request The levels of the domain transfer request, for example, may<br>
be classified into first to third levels (or classes). Examples of these levels (domain<br>
transfer level information) can be as follows, but the invention is not limited thereto:<br>
•A first level of domain transfer request, which is so-called "shall be" (must be), is<br>
to request that the domain transfer shall be (must be) performed (e.g., if not, the call<br>
will be disconnected in a short time);<br>
•A second level of domain transfer request, which is so-called "should be" (should<br>
preferably be), is to request that the domain transfer should be performed (e.g., if not,<br>
the call will risk being disconnected due to resources shortage, etc.); and<br><br>
•A third level of domain transfer request, which is so-called "requested" (can be), is<br>
to request the domain transfer be performed by a selection of the UE based upon a<br>
traffic load, for example (e.g., for load balancing, but up to the UE).<br>
These levels of the domain transfer request can be represented by using different<br>
values of a parameter for indicating the levels of the domain transfer request, by using<br>
different parameters corresponding to different levels, by using a type of indicator, or<br>
by using other ways.<br>
Accordingly, the domain transfer related information sent from the VCC application<br>
300 to the UE(s) in step S4 includes the domain transfer level information which<br>
indicates a level of domain transfer request, which can be, e.g., one of the first to third<br>
levels discussed above.<br>
As a variation, the message sent from the VCC application to the UE(s) in step S4<br>
can include a request to initiate a domain transfer, without including the above domain<br>
transfer level information. Also, one of different or dedicated messages corresponding<br>
respectively to different levels of the domain transfer request can be sent from the<br>
VCC application server to the UE(s). For instance, there may be messages dedicated to<br>
indicate different levels of a domain transfer request. Also, there may be other levels of<br>
the domain transfer request, for the domain transfer level information.<br>
Also as mentioned above, the domain transfer related information (S4) may include<br>
associated information regarding the domain transfer request made by the network that<br>
the VCC application has evaluated in step S3, and information related to the<br>
evaluation. That is, the domain transfer related information can include the evaluation<br>
information. Also, the domain transfer related information can include other in-<br>
formation (e.g., the network state information regarding the network state, etc.).<br>
Also the domain transfer related information or the message including the domain<br>
transfer related information can be included or combined with a message for other<br>
purpose, and/or can share the signaling space with other functionality.<br>
In Step S4, the VCC application 300 transmits the message including the domain<br>
transfer related information to the UE 100, which can occur via a VCC UE - VCC ap-<br>
plication server reference point, i.e., a V3 interface (e.g., V3 interface 20), or using a<br>
unicast method. As a variation, the message including the domain transfer related in-<br>
formation can be simultaneously sent from the VCC application 300 to a plurality of<br>
UEs, e.g., via a multicasting method or a broadcasting method.<br>
After receiving the message including the domain transfer related information from<br>
the VCC application 300, the UE 100 (or each UE) evaluates (or analyzes) the in-<br>
formation included in the message (S5). The UE 100 then sends a response message<br>
(e.g., Ack message) to the VCC application 300 in response to the received message<br>
(S6).. Here, the response message may include information indicating the decision of<br><br>
the VCC application (and/or UE) with respect to the domain transfer request, For<br>
example, the decision on the domain transfer request may indicate an acceptance or<br>
rejection of the domain transfer request made by the VCC application. Step S6 may be<br>
performed between steps S4 and S5, and can be an optional step.<br>
The UE 100 selectively performs (initiates) a domain transfer of the call (e.g.,<br>
ongoing call) by taking into account the information related to the domain transfer<br>
request which has been evaluated in step S5 (S7). Here, when deciding whether or not<br>
to initiate the domain transfer of the call, the UE can take into account, as a factor<br>
which affects the decision, the information related to the domain transfer request (i.e.,<br>
the domain transfer related information included in the message, as a first factor)<br>
together with other factors that the UE has already contained. Examples of the other<br>
factors can be, but are not limited to, user preferences as a second factor) and operator<br>
policy as a third factor). Also, priority (level) among these factors (e.g., the first,<br>
second and third factors) for making the decision on the domain transfer may be<br>
defined according to a user's setup or an operator's setup. For instance, if the first and<br>
third factors conflict with each other (e.g., the first factor indicates that the domain<br>
transfer should be initiated, whereas the third factor does not), then the UE 100 may<br>
decide to follow the first factor according to the setup.<br>
In one example, in step S5, the UE 100 can decide whether or not to initiate a<br>
domain transfer for the current call based on the domain transfer related information<br>
and at least one of the operator policy and user preferences.<br>
Meanwhile, the reference point between the UE 100 and the VCC application 300<br>
can be implemented by use of interfaces or protocols which have been defined, and<br>
also be implemented by defining new interfaces. For example, the reference point may<br>
be implemented by use of an IMS-based signaling, or by the combination of other<br>
interfaces.<br>
In the above example of Fig. 3, the call is an ongoing call (e.g., an outgoing or<br>
incoming call), but the invention is equally applicable to any subsequent call. For<br>
instance, the UE 100 can receive the domain transfer related information from the<br>
VCC application 300 in S4. Then the UE 100 can store this information and then<br>
evaluate it later for a domain transfer of any subsequent call, as desired.<br>
Hereinafter, constructions and operations of the UE 100 (i.e. a terminal) and the<br>
VCC application 300 (i.e., VCC application server) according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention will be explained.<br>
The UE 100 according to the present invention may include a primary hardware<br>
construction which is required to process a message including domain transfer related<br>
information.<br>
For instance, as shown in Fig. 4, the UE 100 according to the present invention<br><br>
comprises a receiver 43 adapted to receive a domain transfer request message (or a<br>
message) including information (domain transfer related information) related to the<br>
domain transfer request from the VCC application, a transmitter 41 adapted to send<br>
(transmit) a response message (e.g., Ack message) with respect to the received domain<br>
transfer request message, a memory or storage unit 42 for storing the received domain<br>
transfer related information and other information such as operator policy, user<br>
preferences, etc., and a VCC enabler 46 adapted to evaluate (or analyze) the domain<br>
transfer related information included in the domain transfer request message (and any<br>
other information as desired) to decide whether or not the domain transfer of an<br>
ongoing call should be initiated (performed), to add (or include) information obtained<br>
by the decision (e.g., acceptance or rejection) to the response message, and to se-<br>
lectively attempt to initiate the domain transfer according to the decision. Here, the<br>
VCC enabler 46 may be a controller as a type of controlling unit for analyzing the<br>
domain transfer related information in order to attempt to initiate the domain transfer.<br>
The UE 100 may also include other components such as a Ut interface unit 47, a DM<br>
unit 48, an input unit 44, and a display unit 45. All components of the UE 100 are op-<br>
eratively coupled.<br>
As aforementioned, the operations and functions of each component of the UE<br>
which includes technical features of the present invention have been explained.<br>
Besides, other basic components of the UE for receiving a VCC service are obvious to<br>
those skilled in the art, and the explanation thereof is thus omitted.<br>
The VCC application 300 according to the present invention comprises a receiver<br>
for receiving domain a domain transfer request (transfer request information)from a<br>
network (e.g., an external node) due to a change in operator policy with respect to the<br>
domain transfer according to the network state or for the network maintenance or for<br>
some other reason, and receiving a response message (i.e., Ack message) transferred<br>
from the UE 100, an evaluating unit for evaluating (or analyzing) the received domain<br>
transfer request by comparing it with previously stored conditions, a message generator<br>
for generating a message including domain transfer related information based upon the<br>
evaluated domain transfer request, and a transmitter for sending the generated message<br>
to the UE(s) 100. Here, since the message including the domain transfer related in-<br>
formation is generated by the evaluating unit and the message generator for the<br>
purpose of requesting the domain transfer, the evaluating unit and the message<br>
generator may be implemented as a type of controller which is capable of performing<br>
the combined functions of both the evaluating unit and the message generator.<br>
The present invention has been explained with reference to embodiments illustrated<br>
in the drawings, which, however, are just exemplary. It will also be apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present<br><br>
invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is<br>
intended that the present invention cover modifications and variations of this invention<br>
provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
As described above, the present invention is advantageous because it allows the<br>
network server (e.g., the VCC application) to request the domain transfer from the UE<br>
according to the network state or if necessary. In addition, the present invention allows<br>
the network server to supply the UE with relevant information (domain transfer related<br>
information) needed for the UE to make a proper informed decision about whether or<br>
not to initiate the domain transfer for its call.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention allows the network server to request the domain<br>
transfer from the UE according to the network state or for the network maintenance.<br>
Accordingly, the UE does not initiate the domain transfer for the calls unnecessarily<br>
and can initiate the domain transfer only when the network can perform/complete the<br>
domain transfer. As a result, the present invention can effectively prevent deterioration<br>
of Quality of Service (QoS) or wasting of signaling or radio resources.<br><br>
