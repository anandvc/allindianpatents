DYE MIXTURES OF FIBER-REACTIVE AZO DYES'AND USETHEREOF This invention relates to the technical field of fiber-reactive azo dyes.<br>
Mixed fiber-reactive azo dyes and their use for dyeing hydroxyl- and carboxamido-containing material in black shades are known for example from the documents US 5,445,654. US 5,611,821, KR 94-2560, Sho 58-160362 and EP-A-0 870 807. However, they have certain application defects, such as for example an overly large dependence of the color yield on varying dyeing parameters in the dyeing process or an insufficient or unlevel color build-up on cotton (good color build-up results from the ability of a dye to provide a proportionally stronger dyeing when used in higher concentrations in the dyebath), or an excessive salt dependence of the dyeings. Consequences of these defects can be poor reproducibilities for the dyeings that are obtainable. The documents WO 98/42784, WO 98/42785, WO 93/18224 and US 5,330,539 disclose dyes and dye mixtures which can be dyed in the presence of small amounts of salt, but which provide only very weak dyeings in the absence of salt.<br>
Since it is commercially as well as environmentally necessary to reduce the salt content of dyeing effluent, there is a need for reactive dyes which provide dyeings of high color strength in the presence of small amounts of salt or even in the absence of electrolyte salts.<br>
The present invention, then, provides dye mixtures which provide dyeings of high color strength in the presence of only very low levels or even in the absence of electrolyte salts.<br>
The invention accordingly provides dye mixtures comprising one or more, such as two or three, preferably 1 or 2, dyes of the hereinbelow indicated and defined general formula (I)<br><br>

Dyes of the general formula (14) and (15) are likewise obtainable via standard synthetic methods or are in some instances formed during the synthesis of dyes of the general formula (I). They are customarily used as shading components.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention can be present as a preparation in solid or liquid (dissolved) form. In solid form, they contain, to the extent necessary, the electrolyte salts customary in the case of water-soluble and especially fiber-reactive dyes, such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride and sodium sulfate, and may further contain the auxiliaries customary in commercial dyes, such as buffer substances capable of setting a pH in aqueous solution between 3 and 7, such as sodium acetate, sodium citrate, sodium borate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium dihydrogenphosphate and disodium hydrogenphosphate, dyeing auxiliaries, dustproofing agents and small amounts of siccatives; when they are present in a liquid, aqueous solution (including a content of thickeners of the type customary in<br><br>
17<br>
print pastes), they may also contain substances which ensure a long life for these preparations, for example mold preventatives.<br>
In solid form, the dye mixtures according to the invention are generally present as powders or granules which contain electrolyte salt and which will hereinbelow generally be referred to as a preparation with or without one or more of the abovementioned auxiliaries. In the preparations, the dye mixture is present at 20 to 90% by weight, based on the preparation containing it. The buffer substances are generally present in a total amount of up to 10% by weight, based on the preparation.<br>
When the dye mixtures according to the invention are present in an aqueous solution, the total dye content of these aqueous solutions is up to about 50% by weight, for example between 5 and 50%, the electrolyte salt content of these aqueous solutions preferably being below 10% by weight, based on the aqueous solution; the aqueous solutions (liquid preparations) can contain the aforementioned buffer substances in an amount which is generally up to 5% by weight and preferably up to 2% by weight.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention are preparable in a conventional manner, as by mechanically mixing the individual dyes, whether in the form of their dye powders or granules or their as-synthesized solutions or in the form of aqueous solutions of the individual dyes generally, which may additionally contain customary auxiliaries, or by conventional diazotization and coupling of suitable mixtures of diazo and coupling components in the desired amount ratios.<br>

18<br><br>
where M, Y, n and D2 are each as defined above.<br>
The dye mixture according to the invention is isolated in a conventional manner by salting out for example with sodium chloride or potassium chloride or by spray drying.<br>
Dye mixtures which as well as p-chloroethylsulfonyl or p-thiosulfatoethylsulfonyl or p-sulfatoethylsulfonyl groups also contain vinylsulfonyl groups as reactive radicals can be synthesized not only starting from appropriately substituted vinylsulfonylanilines or naphthylamines but also by reaction of a dye mixture where Z is p-chloroethyl, p-thiosulfatcethyl or p-sulfatoethyl with an amount of alkali required for the desired fraction and converting the p-substituted ethylsulfonyl groups mentioned into vinylsulfonyl groups. This conversion is effected in a manner familiar to one skilled in the art.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention have useful application properties. They are used for dyeing or printing hydroxyl- and/or carboxamido-containing materials, for example in the form of sheetlike structures, such as paper and leather or of films, for example composed of polyamide, or in bulk, as for example polyamide and polyurethane, but especially for dyeing and printing these materials in fiber form.<br>
Similarly, the as-synthesized solutions of the dye mixtures according to the invention can be used directly as a liquid preparation for dyeing, if appropriate after addition of a buffer substance and if appropriate after concentration or dilution.<br>
The present invention thus also provides for the use of the dye mixtures according to the invention for dyeing or printing these materials, or rather processes for dyeing or printing these materials in a conventional manner, by using a dye mixture according<br><br>
19<br>
to the invention or its individual components (dyes) individually together as a colorant. The materials are preferably employed in the form of fiber materials, especially in the form of textile fibers, such as woven fabrics or yarns, as in the form of hanks or wound packages.<br>
Hydroxyl-containing materials are those of natural or synthetic origin, for example cellulose fiber materials or their regenerated products and polyvinyl alcohols. Cellulose fiber materials are preferably cotton, but also other vegetable fibers, such as linen, hemp, jute and ramie fibers; regenerated cellulose fibers are for example staple viscose and filament viscose and also chemically modified cellulose fibers, such as aminated cellulose fibers or fibers as described for example in WO 96/37641 and WO 96/37642 and also in EP-A-0 538 785 and EP-A-0 692 559.<br>
Carboxamido-containing materials are for example synthetic and natural polyamides and polyurethanes, especially in the form of fibers, for example wool and other animal hairs, silk, leather, nylon-6,6, nylon-6, nylon-11 and nylon-4.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention can be applied to and fixed on the substrates mentioned, especially the fiber materials mentioned, by the application techniques known for water-soluble dyes and especially for fiber-reactive dyes. For instance, on cellulose fibers they produce by the exhaust method from a long liquor and also from a short liquor, for example in a liquor to goods ratio of 5 : 1 to 100 :1, preferably 6 : 1 to 30 :1, using various acid-binding agents and optionally neutral salts as far as necessary, such as sodium chloride or sodium sulfate, dyeings having very good color yields. Application is preferably from an aqueous bath at temperatures between 40 and 105°Cf optionally at a temperature of up to 130°C under superatmospheric pressure, but preferably at 30 to 95°C, especially 45 to 65°C, in the presence or absence of customary dyeing auxiliaries. One possible procedure here is to introduce the material into the bath and to gradually heat the bath to the desired dyeing temperature and complete the dyeing process at that temperature. The neutral salts which accelerate the exhaustion of the dyes may also if desired only be added to the bath after the actual dyeing temperature has been reached.<br><br>
20<br>
Padding processes likewise provide excellent color yields and a very good color build-up on cellulose fibers, the dyes being fixable in a conventional manner by batching at room temperature or elevated temperature, for example at up to 60°C, or in a continuous manner, for example by means of a pad-dry-pad steam process, by steaming or using dry heat.<br>
Similarly, the customary printing processes for cellulose fibers, which can be carried out in one step, for example by printing with a print paste containing sodium bicarbonate or some other acid-binding agent and by subsequent steaming at 100 to 103°C, or in two steps, for example by printing with a neutral to weak acidic print color and then fixing either by passing the printed material through hot electrolyte-containing alkaline bath or by overpadding with an alkaline electrolyte-containing padding liquor and subsequent batching of the alkali-overpadded material or subsequent steaming or subsequent dry heat treatment of the alkali-overpadded material, produce strong prints with well-defined contours and a clear white ground. The outcome of the prints is little affected, if at all, by variations in the fixing conditions.<br>
When fixing by means of dry heat in accordance with the customary thermofix processes, hot air at 120 to 200°C is used. In addition to the customary steam at 101 to 103°C, it is also possible to use superheated steam and high-pressure steam at temperatures of up to 160°C.<br>
The acid-binding agents which effect the fixation of the dye mixtures according to the invention on the cellulose fibers are for example water-soluble basic salts of alkali metals and likewise alkaline earth metals of inorganic or organic acids or compounds which liberate alkali in the heat, and also alkali metal silicates. Especially suitable are the alkali metal hydroxides and alkali metal salts of weak to medium inorganic or organic acids, the preferred alkali metal compounds being the sodium and potassium compounds. Such acid-binding agents are for example sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium formate, sodium dihydrogenphosphate, disodium hydrogenphosphate, sodium trichloroacetate, trisodium phosphate waterglass or mixtures thereof, for example mixtures of aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and waterglass.<br><br>
21<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention are notable for outstanding color strength when applied to the cellulose fiber materials by dyeing or printing in the presence of no or very small amounts of alkali or alkaline earth metal compounds. For instance, no electrolyte salt is required for a shallow depth of shade, not more than 5 g/l of electrolyte salt is required for a medium depth of shade and not more than 10 g/l of electrolyte salt is required for deep shades.<br>
According to the invention, a shallow depth of shade refers to the use of 2% by weight of dye based on the substrate to be dyed, a medium depth of shade refers to the use of 2 to 4% by weight based on the substrate to be dyed and a deep shade refers to the use of 4 to 10% by weight of dye based on the substrate to be dyed.<br>
The dyeing and prints obtainable with the dye mixtures according to the invention possess bright shades; more particularly, the dyeings and prints on cellulose fiber materials possess good lightfastness and especially good wetfastnesses, such as fastness to washing, milling, water, seawater, crossdyeing and acidic and alkaline perspiration, also good fastness to pleating, hotpressing and rubbing. Furthermore, the cellulose dyeings obtained following the customary aftertreatment of rinsing to remove unfixed dye portions exhibit excellent wetfastnesses, in particular since unfixed dye portions are easily washed off because of their good solubility in cold water.<br>
Furthermore, the dye mixtures according to the invention can also be used for the fiber-reactive dyeing of wool. Moreover, wool which has been given a nonfelting or low-felting finish (cf. for example H. Rath, Lehrbuch der Textilchemie, Springer-Veriag, 3rd edition (1972), pages 295-299, especially finished by the Hercosett process (page 298); J. Soc. Dyers and Colourists 1972, 93-99, and 1975, 33-44), can be dyed to very good fastness properties. The process of dyeing on wool is here carried out in a conventional manner from an acidic medium, For instance, acetic acid and/or ammonium sulfate or acetic acid and ammonium sulfate or sodium acetate can be added to the dyebath to obtain the desired pH. To obtain a dyeing of acceptable levelness, it is advisable to add a customary leveling agent, for example a leveling agent based on a reaction product of cyanuric chloride with three times the molar amount of an aminobenzenesulfonic acid and/or of an<br><br>
22<br>
aminonaphthalenesulfonic acid or on the basis of a reaction product of for example stearylamine with ethylene oxide. For instance, the dye mixture according to the invention is preferably subjected to the exhaust process initially from an acidic dyebath having a pH of about 3.5 to 5.5 under pH control and the pH is then, toward the end of the dyeing time, shifted into the neutral and optionally weakly alkaline range up to a pH of 8.5 to bring about, especially for very deep dyeings, the full reactive bond between the dyes of the dye mixtures according to the invention and the fiber. At the same time, the dye portion not reactively bound is removed.<br>
The procedure described herein also applies to the production of dyeings on fiber materials composed of other natural polyamides or of synthetic polyamides and polyurethanes. In general, the material to be dyed is introduced into the bath at a temperature of about 40°C, agitated therein for some time, the dyebath is then adjusted to the desired weakly acidic, preferably weakly acetic acid, pH and the actual dyeing is carried out at a temperature between 60 and 98°C. However, the dyeings can also be carried out at the boil or in sealed dyeing apparatus at temperatures of up to 106°C. Since the water solubility of the dye mixtures according to the invention is very good, they can also be used with advantage in customary continuous dyeing processes. The color strength of the dye mixtures according to the invention is very high.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention dye the materials mentioned, preferably fiber materials, in navy to jet black shades having good fastness properties.<br>
The examples hereinbelow serve to illustrate the invention. Parts and percentages are by weight, unless otherwise stated. Parts by weight relate to parts by volume as the kilogram relative to the liter. The compounds described in the examples in terms of a formula are indicated in the form of the sodium salts, since they are generally prepared and isolated in the form of their salts, preferably lithium, sodium or potassium salts, and used for dyeing in the form of their salts. The starting compounds described in the examples hereinbelow, especially the table examples, can be used in the synthesis in the form of the free acid or likewise in the form of their salts, preferably alkali metal salts, such as sodium or potassium salts.<br><br>

Example 1<br>
80 parts of an electrolyte-containing dye powder containing the navy disazo dye of<br>
the formula (IA)<br><br>
in a 70% fraction and 20 parts of an electrolyte-containing dye powder containing the orange-colored monoazo dye of the formula (HA) in a 75% fraction are mechanically mixed with each other.<br><br>
The resulting dye mixture according to the invention provides black dyeings and prints, on cotton for example, under the dyeing conditions customary for reactive dyes.<br>
Example 2<br>
75 parts of an electrolyte-containing dye powder containing the navy disazo dye of the formula (IA) in a 70% fraction and 25 parts of an electrolyte-containing dye powder containing the orange-coloured monoazo dye of the formula (MB)<br><br><br>
24<br>
in a 75% fraction are dissolved in 700 parts of water and the resulting dye solution is adjusted to pH 5.5-6.5. Evaporation of this dye solution provides a dye mixture which provides black dyeings and prints on cotton under the dyeing conditions customary for reactive dyes.<br>
Example 3<br>
a)	281 parts of 4-(p-sulfatoethylsulfony!)aniline are suspended in 650 parts of ice-<br>
water and 180 parts of 30% hydrochloric acid and diazotized by dropwise addition of<br>
173 parts of 40% sodium nitrite solution. 319 parts of 1-amino-8-naphthol-3,6-<br>
disulfonic acid were added and coupled in a first step at pH 1 to 1.3 at below 20°C to<br>
form a red monoazo dye conforming to the general formula (14). The stated pH range<br>
is set and maintained during the coupling reaction by addition of a total of about 140<br>
parts of sodium bicarbonate.<br>
b)	In a second, separate reaction vessel, 500 parts of 4-amino-N-(3-((p-sulfatoethyl)-<br>
sulfonyl)-phenyl)-benzamide are suspended in 2750 parts of ice-water, adjusted to<br>
pH 6.5 - 7 with about 90 parts of sodium carbonate and admixed with 217 parts of<br>
40% sodium nitrite solution. This suspension is added dropwise to a mixture of 780<br>
parts of ice, 630 parts of ice-water and 450 parts of concentrated hydrochloric acid.<br>
After subsequent stirring at 5-10°C for 2 hours, the excess nitrite is reduced with<br>
amidosulfonic acid and the resulting diazp. suspension is pumped into the solution of<br>
the red monoazo dye of a). This reaction mixture is then admixed with 76 parts of<br>
2-hydroxynaphthalene-3,6-disulfonicacid.<br>
The batch was then readjusted to pH 5 - 6 with sodium carbonate at below 25°C and the 85 :15 mixture of the dyes (IB) and (IIC) formed after the coupling reaction has ended is isolated by spray drying.<br>
Alternatively, the dye solution obtained can also be buffered at pH 5.5 - 6 by addition<br>
of a phosphate buffer and be adjusted by further dilution or concentration to provide a<br>
liquid brand of defined strength.<br>
The resulting dye mixture according to the invention dyes cotton in navy to black<br>
shades.<br><br><br>

The table examples hereinbelow describe further inventive mixtures of the dyes of<br>
the general formulae (I) and (II), each recited in the form of the sodium salts. The<br>
mixing ratios are indicated in percent by weight. The dye mixtures provide navy to jet<br>
black dyeings, on cotton for example, by the dyeing methods customary for reactive<br>
dyes.<br><br>

The dyebath is entered with 100 g of a cotton fabric. The temperature of the dyebath is first maintained at 25°C for 10 minutes, then raised over 30 minutes to the final temperature (40-60°C) and maintained at that level for a further 60-90 minutes.<br><br>
35<br>
Thereafter, the dyed material is rinsed initially with tap water for 2 minutes and then with ion-free water for 5 minutes. The dyed material is neutralized at 40°C in 1000 parts of an aqueous solution containing 1 part of 50% acetic acid for 10 minutes. It is subsequently rinsed with ion-free water at 70°C and thereafter soaked off at the boil with a detergent for 15 minutes, rinsed once more and dried. This gives a strong navy to gray dyeing having very good fastness properties.<br>
