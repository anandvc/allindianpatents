This invention relates to a flexible modular system, which would help attach various modules to a main carrying system. The carrying systems can be either a bag, back-pack, jackets, bullet proof vests, vests in general and the like. Hiis modular system will be known as L. A. T. L S. modular system.<br>
The present invention also relates to a tactical combat vest using the flexible modular system. The vest of the present invention is designed for present day combat scenarios and is designed to ad^t to changes in equipment, ammo, weaponry as well as re-size for correct fit. The vest has an adjustable collar waist belt and/or an adjustable pre-defined rifle positioning system.<br>
The present day changes requires modular systems from furniture to houses, including requirements in the army and other security related services. Modem battle requirements can change suddenly and dramatically, thus weaponry and associated gear also changes. To acconmiodate these changes various modules, which are simple, come handy in connecting with the main system.<br>
Further, the MiUtary and specialized law «iforcement vmits, such as security personnel, police etc, require specialized vest which can carry many essential items that are required to be carried by tiiem on a regular basis.<br>
Tactical vests often have various pockets and straps for carrying various tactical gears. However, the known tactical gears have fixed pockets for particular items and as such the user will not be able to adjust the same according to his needs. Further, the known tactical gears caimot be re-sized at all.<br>
To overcome the above disadvantages, the present invention also proposes a tactical combat vest, in which the positioning of tiie items that are to be carried can be adjxisted according the user. Further, the tactical vest of the present invention can be re-sized for correct fit.<br><br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a flexible modular system which can be attached to a main system and which will help to carry many items that are required by the user.<br>
A fiirther object of the present invention is to provide a flexible modular system which is compact and as well as cost effective and also very easy to use.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a vest in which modular pouches can be added as and when they are needed and also the user can position wherever he feels handy and comfortable.<br>
This invention thus provides a modular system comprising a base wherein at least one horizontal webbing loop is sewn at regular, predetermined intervals by bar tacking, detachable modules provided with vertical webbing loop with necessary means to enable placing of the same.<br>
In a further embodiment, the vertical webbing loop is provided with additional stiffening support for further strength. The means for placing the detachable modules can either be buttons or Velcro tapes. The detachable modules also are provided with horizontal loops.<br>
This invention also provides a tactical vest comprising a tactical mesh vest along with a padded, adjustable and detachable waist belt, the back of the waist belt being provided with t£^es running across the belt horizontally at regular into^als, the said tapes having bar tacked at predetermined intervals, tiie mesh vest is provided with a sleeve at the bottom to receive the said belt, the said sleeve conceals a flat internal pocket, the shoulder area of the vest being padded for load canying comfort, at least three detachable pouches for carrying items required by the user, holster for carrying pistol or the like, and an universal rifle sling.<br><br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings,<br>
wherein:<br>
Fig. 1  shows the arrangement of the modular system of the present invention along with<br>
the vertical webbing provided in the detachable modules. Fig. 2. is a front elevational view of the jacket of the present invention; Fig. 3   is a back elevational view of the jacket of the present invention; Fig. 4   is a front view including the detachable pouches.<br>
Horizontal webbing loops 1 are sewn at regular intervals by bar tacking 2, to either a base 3, or the main support system (not shown in the drawings). These webbings 2 are placed at regular intervals leaving a gap of the width of the vertical webbing 4 in the detachable module plus some clearance. This creates a flexible, light and fails proof system for attaching modules.<br>
The detachable modules themselves have vertical webbing(s) 4, which is/are additionally stiffened. At the end, these webbing pieces have means such as either a button or Velcro so as to enable the same to be placed on the main support system. The modules also have horizontal webbing loops 5 sewn at regular intervals.<br>
The module can be linked anywhere on the base or on the main support system by linking the vertical webbing loops 5 through the horizontal loops 1, start with the vertical going through the horizontal on the base or on the main system, then through the horizontal on the module and then again onto the main and then button up or afRx with Velcro.<br>
The system is quite rugged, can take loads and abuse, repeated use without failing in the field. Since there are no complicated parts chances of failure is quite small.<br>
The entire surface of the main carry system can be pre sewn with the horizontal webbing to create a flexible system to attach any modiile that has been designed as per this system.<br><br>
Tactical Mesh Vest with padded adjustable and detachable waist belt. The belt itself is made with the main fabric and webbing with adjustable S R buckle, extra webbing is looped back and held by elasticized bands. The back of the waist belt has bar tacked t^es running across the belt horizontally at regiilar intervals and bar tacked at regular intervals. The intervals of tape and bar tacking have to be very precise for the modular concept to work. This system is known as the L.A.T.LS. system.<br>
The main vest is made with 210D mesh with a sleeve at the bottom to receive the waist belt. The sleeve also conceals a flat internal pockets. The vest locks onto the waist belt using the L.A.T.I.S. system. The vest is additionally connected to the waist belt using two ladder lock buckles and tapes. This system makes the L.A.T.I.S. a universal size that fits one and all. Extra t^)e is stored under elasticized bands. It also means that if one is wearing more layers or less the vest can be adjusted instantly to fit properly with comfort. The shoulder area of the vest is also padded (6 mm PE Foam) for load carrying comfort.<br>
Further the t^)e and bar tack system is deployed in the front of the vest as well to receive all sorts of modxilar components that has been designed for this vest. The vest has a single S R buckle for closure at the stemum,<br>
Magazines Pouch - Designed to take in most rifle magazines, the vest comes with three numbers of these pouches for carrying extra loaded magazines. The pouch has a deep pocket that has been properly reinforced for long life, shaped so that the magazine held securely but easy to withdraw for fast action. The pouch has Velcro as well as button closure with a deep top c£^ for keeping the magazine securely.<br>
The back system is also part of the L.A.T.I.S. system. Tapes run horizontally that have been bar tacked to match the vest. Additionally vertical t^es that have been doubled and reinforced with flexible fiber sheet with two heavy duty buttons at the end.<br><br>
The vertical t^es slip in through the vest first at whatever location the user wants it to be in, then slip in through one of the t^)es in the back of the pouch, and then back again to the jacket and so on until the buttons are snapped shut. This fool proof system ensures that heavy objects can be carried with great comfort and ease with assurance of reaching for the right item as and when needed. All components of the L.A.T.LS jacket are with the same system.<br>
Grenade Pouch - designed to take in a standard grenade. The vest comes with two such pouches to carry two grenades with an L.A.T.LS system.<br>
Frog Bayonet - made with reinforced webbing, snap button knife closure and two button system at the back to lock onto waist belt or the tactical vest.<br>
Pistol friction holster - Designed to take in most pistols that are deployed among Indian forces. The holster connects to the vest and fit on the thigh with two wide webbing belts that are adjustable. The pistol can be kept xmder friction or backed by a Velcro loop, L.A.T.I.S system connects the holster to the vest.<br>
Compass Pouch - padded single compartment to receive a compass with an L.A.T.I.S system.<br>
Butt pack - large butt back with twin runner closure with additional compression tapes running vertically on the pack. Large enough to take in additional clothing, ration, m^s, etc.<br>
Water bottle Pouch - designed to take in standard mess tin and water bottle with a yoke system and S R buckle to retain the bottle along with sxiitable top fl^. The back is an L.A.T.I.S system.<br>
Multi purpose pouch - this pouch can either take in additional water bottle or any other item like a Radio, GPS etc. The back is an L.A.T.I.S system.<br><br>
Haversack - a large ergonomically designed pack with an internal frame, three large front pouches and one large lid pouch with internal m£^ case.<br>
Recon Pack - a small pack that is usefiil for small trip hat need speed and agility.<br>
Rifle Sling - a universal rifle sling with two ultra strong clips, a padded movable patch for carry comfort and a system that ensxire that the rifle caimot be snatched easily^ The user can drop the rifle at any time without fear of dropping the rifle; it says where it should stay for easy reach.<br>
