Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to cell selection in a wireless communication system,<br>
and more particularly, to interrupting use of a frequency layer convergence scheme<br>
which favors the selection of a cell on a preferred frequency of a joined point-<br>
to-multipoint service.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	Recently, mobile communication systems have developed remarkably, but for high<br>
capacity data communication services, the performance of mobile communication<br>
systems cannot match that of existing wired communication systems. Accordingly,<br>
technical developments for IMT-2000, which is a communication system allowing<br>
high capacity data communications, are being made and standardization of such<br>
technology is being actively pursued among various companies and organizations.<br>
[3]	A universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS) is a third generation mobile<br>
communication system that has evolved from a European standard known as Global<br>
System for Mobile communications (GSM). The UMTS aims to provide improved<br>
mobile communication service based on a GSM core network and wideband code<br>
division multiple access (W-CDMA) wireless connection technology.<br>
[4]	In December 1998, ETSI of Europe, ARTB/TTC of Japan, T1 of the United States,<br>
and TTA of Korea formed a Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for creating<br>
the detailed specifications of the UMTS technology.<br>
[5]	Within the 3GPP, in order to achieve rapid and efficient technical development of<br>
the UMTS, five technical specification groups (TSG) have been created for performing<br>
the standardization of the UMTS by considering the independent nature of the network<br>
elements and their operations.<br>
[6]	Each TSG develops, approves, and manages the standard specification within a<br>
related region. Among these groups, the radio access network (RAN) group<br>
(TSG-RAN) develops the standards for the functions, requirements, and interface of<br>
the UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN), which is a new radio access<br>
network for supporting W-CDMA access technology in the UMTS.<br>
[7]	Figure 1 illustrates an exemplary basic structure of a general UMTS network. As<br>
shown in Figure 1, the UMTS is roughly divided into a mobile terminal (or user<br>
equipment: UE) 10, a UTRAN 100, and a core network (CN) 200.<br>
[8]	The UTRAN 100 includes one or more radio network sub-systems (RNS) 110,120.<br><br>
Each RNS 110,120 includes a radio network controller (RNC) 111, and a plurality of<br>
base stations or Node-Bs 112,113 managed by the RNC 111. The RNC 111 handles<br>
the assigning and managing of radio resources, and operates as an access point with<br>
respect to the core network 200.<br>
[9]	The Node-Bs 112,113 receive information sent by the physical layer of the<br>
terminal through an uplink, and transmit data to the terminal through a downlink. The<br>
Node-Bs 112,113, thus, operate as access points of the UTRAN 100 for the terminal.<br>
[10]	A primary function of the UTRAN 100 is forming and maintaining a radio access<br>
bearer (RAB) to allow communication between the terminal and the core network 200.<br>
The core network 200 applies end-to-end quality of service (QoS) requirements to the<br>
RAB, and the RAB supports the QoS requirements set by the core network 200. As the<br>
UTRAN 100 forms and maintains the RAB, the QoS requirements of end-to-end are<br>
satisfied. The RAB service can be further divided into an Iu bearer service and a radio<br>
bearer service. The Iu bearer service supports a reliable transmission of user data<br>
between boundary nodes of the UTRAN 100 and the core network 200.<br>
[11]	The core network 200 includes a mobile switching center (MSC) 210 and a gateway<br>
mobile switching center (GMSC) 220 connected together for supporting a circuit<br>
switched (CS) service, and a serving GPRS support node (SGSN) 230 and a gateway<br>
GPRS support node 240 connected together for supporting a packet switched (PS)<br>
service.<br>
[12]	The services provided to a specific terminal are roughly divided into the circuit<br>
switched (CS) services and the packet switched (PS) services. For example, a general<br>
voice conversation service is a circuit switched service, while a Web browsing service<br>
via an Internet connection is classified as a packet switched (PS) service.<br>
[13]	For supporting circuit switched services, the RNCs 111 are connected to the MSC<br>
210 of me core network 200, and me MSC 210 is connected to the GMSC 220 that<br>
manages the connection with other networks.<br>
[14]	For supporting packet switched services, the RNCs 111 are connected to the SGSN<br>
230 and the GGSN 240 of the core network 200. The SGSN 230 supports the packet<br>
communications going toward the RNCs 111, and the GGSN 240 manages the<br>
connection with other packet switched networks, such as the Internet.<br>
[15]	Various types of interfaces exist between network components to allow the network<br>
components to transmit and receive information to and from each other for mutual<br>
communication therebetween. An interface between the RNC 111 and the core<br>
network 200 is defined as an Iu interface. In particular, the Iu interface between the<br>
RNCs 111 and the core network 200 for packet switched systems is defined as "Iu-PS,"<br>
and the Iu interface between the RNCs 111 and the core network 200 for circuit<br>
switched systems is defined as "Iu-CS."<br><br>
[16]	Figure 2 illustrates a structure of a radio interface protocol between the terminal and<br>
the UTRAN according to the 3GPP radio access network standards.<br>
[17]	As shown in Figure 2, the radio interface protocol has horizontal layers comprising<br>
a physical layer, a data link layer, and a network layer, and has vertical planes<br>
comprising a user plane (U-plane) for transmitting user data and a control plane<br>
(C-plane) for transmitting control information.<br>
[ 18]	The user plane is a region that handles traffic information of the user, such as voice<br>
or Internet protocol (EP) packets, whiles the control plane is a region that handles<br>
control information for an interface of a network, maintenance and management of a<br>
call, and the like.	<br>
[19]	The protocol layers in Figure 2 can be divided into a first layer (LI), a second layer<br>
(L2), and a third layer (L3) based on three lower layers of an open system inter-<br>
connection (OSI) standard model. Each layer will be described in more detail as<br>
follows.<br>
[20]	The first layer (L1), namely, the physical layer, provides an information transfer<br>
service to an upper layer by using various radio transmission techniques. The physical<br>
layer is connected to an upper layer called a medium access control (MAC) layer, via a<br>
transport channel. The MAC layer and the physical layer send and receive data with<br>
one another via the transport channel.<br>
[21]	The second layer (L2) includes a MAC layer, a radio link control (RLC) layer, a<br>
broadcast/multicast control (BMC) layer, and a packet data convergence protocol<br>
(PDCP) layer.<br>
[22]	The MAC layer provides an allocation service of the MAC parameters for<br>
allocation and re-allocation of radio resources. The MAC layer is connected to an<br>
upper layer called the radio link control (RLC) layer, via a logical channel.<br>
[23]	Various logical channels are provided according to the kind of transmitted in-<br>
formation. In general, when information of the control plane is transmitted, a control<br>
channel is used. When information of the user plane is transmitted, a traffic channel is<br>
used. A logical channel may be a common channel or a dedicated channel depending<br>
on whether the logical channel is shared. Logical channels include a dedicated traffic<br>
channel (DTCH), a dedicated control channel (DCCH), a common traffic channel<br>
(CTCH), a common control channel (CCCH), a broadcast control channel (BCCH) and<br>
a paging control channel (PCCH) or a. Shared Channel Control Channel (SHCCH). The<br>
BCCH provides information including information utilized by a terminal to access a<br>
system. The PCCH is used by the UTRAN to access a terminal.<br>
[24]	A Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS or "MBMS service") refers to a<br>
method of providing streaming or background services to a plurality of UEs using a<br>
downlink-dedicated MBMS radio bearer that utilizes at least one of point-to-multipoint<br><br>
and point-to-point radio bearer. One MBMS service includes one or more sessions and<br>
MBMS data is transmitted to the plurality of terminals through the MBMS radio bearer<br>
only while the session is ongoing.<br>
[25]	As the name implies, an MBMS may be carried out in a broadcast mode or a<br>
multicast mode. The broadcast mode is for transmitting multimedia data to all UEs<br>
within a broadcast area, for example the domain where the broadcast is available. The<br>
multicast mode is for transmitting multimedia data to a specific UE group within a<br>
multicast area, for example the domain where the multicast service is available.<br>
[26]	For purposes of MBMS, additional traffic and control channels exist. For example,<br>
an MCCH (MBMS point-to-multipoint Control Channel) is used for transmitting<br>
MBMS control information while an MTCH (MBMS point-to-multipoint Traffic<br>
Channel) is used for transmitting MBMS service data.<br>
[27]	The different logical channels that exist are listed below:<br>
Control Channel (CCH) 	j	 Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH)<br>
	 Paging Control Channel (PCCH)<br>
	 Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH)<br>
	 Common Control Channel (CCCH)<br>
	 Shared Channel Control Channel (SHCCH)<br>
	MBMS point-to-multipoint Control Channel (MCCH)<br>
Traffic Channel (TCH) 		 Dedicated Traffic Channel (DTCH)<br>
	 Common Traffic Channel (CTCH)<br>
'	 MBMS point-to-multipoint Traffic Channel (MTCH)<br>
[28]	The MAC layer is connected to the physical layer by transport channels and can be<br>
divided into a MAC-b sub-layer, a MAC-d sub-layer, a MAC-c/sh sub-layer, and a<br>
MAC-hs sub-layer according to the type of transport channel to be managed.<br>
[29]	The MAC-b sub-layer manages a BCH (Broadcast Channel), which is a transport<br>
channel handling the broadcasting of system information. The MAC-d sub-layer<br>
manages a dedicated channel (DCH), which is a dedicated transport channel for a<br>
specific terminal. Accordingly, the.MAC-d sub-layer of the UTRAN is located in a<br>
serving radio network controller (SRNC) that manages a corresponding terminal, and<br>
one MAC-d sub-layer also exists within each terminal (UE).<br>
[30]	The MAC-c/sh sub-layer manages a common transport channel, such as a forward<br>
access channel (FACH) or a downlink shared channel (DSCH), which is shared by a<br>
plurality of terminals, or in the uplink the Radio Access Channel (RACH). In the<br><br>
UTRAN, the MAC-c/sh sub-layer is located in a controlling radio network controller<br>
(CRNC). As the MAC-c/sh sub-layer manages the channel being shared by all<br>
terminals within a cell region, a single MAC-c/sh sub-layer exists for each cell region.<br>
Also, one MAC-c/sh sublayer exists in each terminal (UE). Referring to Figure 3,<br>
possible mapping between the logical channels and the transport channels from a UE<br>
perspective is shown. Referring to Figure 4, possible mapping between the logical<br>
channels and the transport channels from a UTRAN perspective is shown.<br>
[31]	The RLC layer supports reliable data transmissions, and performs a segmentation<br>
and concatenation function on a plurality of RLC service data units (RLC SDUs)<br>
delivered from an upper layer. When the RLC layer receives the RLC SDUs from the<br>
upper layer, the RLC layer adjusts the size of each RLC SDU in an appropriate manner<br>
upon considering processing capacity, and then creates certain data units with header<br>
information added thereto. The created data units are called protocol data units<br>
(PDUs), which are then transferred to the MAC layer via a logical channel. The RLC<br>
layer includes a RLC buffer for storing the RLC SDUs and/or the RLC PDUs.<br>
[32]	The BMC layer schedules a cell broadcast message (referred to as a 'CB message',<br>
hereinafter) received from the core network, and broadcasts the CB messages to<br>
terminals located in a specific cell(s). The BMC layer of the UTRAN generates a<br>
broadcast/multicast control (BMC) message by adding information, such as a message<br>
ID (identification), a serial number, and a coding scheme to the CB message received<br>
from the upper layer, and transfers the BMC message to the RLC layer. The BMC<br>
messages are transferred from the RLC layer to the MAC layer through a logical<br>
channel, i.e., the CTCH (Common Traffic Channel). The CTCH is mapped to a<br>
transport channel, i.e., a FACH, which is mapped to a physical channel, i.e., a S-<br>
CCPCH (Secondary Common Control Physical Channel).<br>
[33]	The PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) layer, as a higher layer of the RLC<br>
layer, allows the data transmitted through a network protocol, such as an IPv4 or IPv6,<br>
to be effectively transmitted on a radio interface with a relatively small bandwidth. To<br>
achieve this, the PDCP layer reduces unnecessary control information used in a wired<br>
network, a function called header compression.<br>
[34]	A radio resource control (RRC) layer is located at a lowermost portion of the L3<br>
layer. The RRC layer is defined only in the control plane, and handles the control of<br>
logical channels, transport channels, and physical channels with respect to setup, re-<br>
configuration, and release or cancellation of radio bearers (RBs). The radio bearer<br>
service refers to a service provided by the second layer (L2) for data transmission<br>
between the terminal and the UTRAN. In general, the setup of the radio bearer refers<br>
to the process of defining the characteristics of a protocol layer and a channel required<br>
for providing a specific data service, as well as respectively setting detailed parameters<br><br>
and operation methods.<br>
[35]	The RLC layer can belong to the user plane or to the control plane depending upon<br>
the type of layer connected at the upper layer of the RLC layer. That is, if the RLC<br>
layer receives data from the RRC layer, the RLC layer belongs to the control plane.<br>
Otherwise, the RLC layer belongs to the user plane.<br>
[36]	The different possibilities that exist for the mapping between the radio bearers and<br>
the transport channels are not always possible. The UE/UTRAN deduces the possible<br>
mapping depending on the UE state and the procedure that the UE/UTRAN is<br>
executing. The different states and modes are explained in more detail below.<br>
[37]	The different transport channels ares mapped onto different physical channels. For<br>
example, the RACH transport channel is mapped on a given PRACH, the DCH can be<br>
mapped on the DPCH, the FACH and the PCH can be mapped on the S-CCPCH, the<br>
DSCH is mapped on the PDSCH and so on. The configuration of the physical channels<br>
is given by an RRC signaling exchange between the RNC and the UE.<br>
[38]	The RRC mode refers to whether mere exists a logical connection between the RRC<br>
of the terminal and the RRC of the UTRAN. If there is a connection, the terminal is<br>
said to be in RRC connected mode. If there is no connection, the terminal is said to be<br>
in idle mode. Because an RRC connection exists for terminals in RRC connected<br>
mode, the UTRAN can determine the existence of a particular terminal within the unit<br>
of cells, for example which cell or set of cells the RRC connected mode terminal is in,<br>
and which physical channel the UE is listening to. Thus, the terminal can be effectively<br>
controlled.<br>
[39]	In contrast, the UTRAN cannot determine the existence of a terminal in idle mode.<br>
The existence of idle mode terminals can only be determined by the core network.<br>
Specifically, the core network can only detect the existence of idle mode terminals<br>
within a region that is larger than a cell, such as a location or a routing area. Therefore,<br>
the existence of idle mode terminals is determined within large regions. In order to<br>
receive mobile communication services such as voice or data, the idle mode terminal<br>
must move or change into the RRC connected mode. The possible transitions between<br>
modes and states are shown in Figure 5.<br>
[40]	A UE in RRC connected mode can. be in different states, such as a CELL_FACH<br>
state, a CELLJPCH state, a CELLJDCH state or a URA_PCH state. Depending on the<br>
states, the UE listens to different channels. For example a UE in CELLJDCH state will<br>
try to listen (amongst others) to DCH type of transport channels, which comprises<br>
DTCH and DCCH transport channels, and which can be mapped to a certain DPCH.<br>
The UE in CELL_FACH state will listen to several FACH transport channels which<br>
are mapped to a certain S-CCPCH physical channel. The UE in PCH state will listen to<br>
the PICH channel and to the PCH channel, which is mapped to a certain S-CCPCH<br><br>
physical channel.<br>
[41]	The UE also carries out different actions depending on the state. For example, based<br>
on different conditions, a UE in CELL_FACH will start a CELL Update procedure<br>
each time the UE changes from the coverage of one cell into the coverage of another<br>
cell. The UE starts the CELL Update procedure by sending to the NodeB a Cell Update<br>
message to indicate that the UE has changed its location. The UE will then start<br>
listening to the FACH. This procedure is additionally used when the UE comes from<br>
any other state to CELL_FACH state aud the UE has no C-RNTI available, such as<br>
when the UE comes from the CELL _PCH state or CELL_DCH state, or when the UE<br>
in CELL_FACH state was out of coverage.<br>
[42]	In the CELL_DCH state, the UE is granted dedicated radio resources, and may ad-<br>
ditionally use shared radio resources. This allows the UE to have a high data rate and<br>
efficient data exchange. However, the radio resources are limited. It is the re-<br>
sponsibility of the UTRAN to allocate the radio resources amongst the UEs such that<br>
they are efficiently used and ensure that the different UEs obtain the quality of service<br>
required.<br>
[43]	A UE in CELL_FACH state has no dedicated radio resources attributed, and can<br>
only communicate with the UTRAN via shared channels. Thus, the UE consumes few<br>
radio resources. However, the data rate available is very limited. Also, the UE needs to<br>
permanently monitor the shared channels. Thus, UE battery consumption is increased<br>
in the case where the UE is not transmitting.<br>
[44]	A UE in CELL_PCH/URA_PCH state only monitors the paging channel at<br>
dedicated occasions, and therefore minimizes the battery consumption. However, if the<br>
network wishes to access the UE, it must first indicate this desire on the paging<br>
occasion. The network may then access the UE, but only if the UE has replied to the<br>
paging. Furthermore, the UE can only access the network after performing a Cell Upd<br>
ate procedure which introduces additional delays when the UE wants to send data to<br>
the UTRAN.<br>
[45]	Main system information is sent on the BCCH logical channel, which is mapped on<br>
the P-CCPCH (Primary Common Conlrol Physical Channel). Specific system in-<br>
formation blocks can be sent on the FACH channel. When the system information is<br>
sent on the FACH, the UE receives the configuration of the FACH either on the BCCH<br>
that is received on the P-CCPCH or on a dedicated channel. The P-CCPCH is sent<br>
using the same scrambling code as a P -CPICH (Primary Common Pilot Channel),<br>
which is the primary scrambling code of the cell.<br>
[46]	Each channel uses a spreading code as commonly done in WCDMA (Wideband<br>
Code Division Multiple Access) systems. Each code is characterized by its spreading<br>
factor (SF), which corresponds to the length of the code. For a given spreading factor,<br><br>
the number of orthogonal codes is equal to the length of the code. For each spreading<br>
factor, the given set of orthogonal codes, as specified in the UMTS system, are<br>
numbered from 0 to SF-1. Each code can thus be identified by giving its length (i.e.<br>
spreading factor) and the number of the: code. The spreading code that is used by the P-<br>
CCPCH is always of a fixed spreading factor 256 and the number is the number 1. The<br>
UE knows about the primary scrambling code either by information sent from the<br>
network on system information of neighboring cells that the UE has read, by messages<br>
that the UE has received on the DCCH channel, or by searching for the P-CPICH,<br>
which is sent using the fixed SF 256 and the spreading code number 0, and which<br>
transmits a fixed pattern.<br>
[47]	The system information comprises information on neighboring cells, configuration<br>
of the RACH and FACH transport channels, and the configuration of MCCH, which is<br>
a channel dedicated for MBMS service. When the UE has selected a cell (in<br>
CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH or URA_FCH state), the UE verifies that it has valid<br>
system information.<br>
[48]	The system information is organized in SIBs (system information blocks), a MTB<br>
(Master information block) and scheduling blocks. The MTB is sent very frequently<br>
and provides timing information of the scheduling blocks and the different SIBs. For<br>
SIBs that are linked to a value tag, the MIB also contains information on the last<br>
version of a part of the SIBs. SIBs that are not linked to a value tag are linked to an<br>
expiration timer. The SIBs linked to an expiration timer become invalid and need to be<br>
reread if the time of the last reading of the SIB is larger than an expiration timer value.<br>
The SIBs linked to a value tag are only valid if they have the same value tag as a value<br>
tag broadcast in the MIB. Each block has an area scope of validity, such as a Cell, a<br>
PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) or an equivalent PLMN, which signifies on<br>
which cells the SIB is valid. A SIB with the area scope "Cell" is valid only for the cell<br>
in which it has been read. A SIB with the area scope "PLMN" is valid in the whole<br>
PLMN. A SIB with the area scope "equivalent PLMN" is valid in the whole PLMN<br>
and equivalent PLMN.<br>
[49]	According to the 3GPP standard, a UE in CELL_PCH, URAJPCH or CELLJFACH<br>
state, or in idle mode shall constantly try to select/reselect a suitable cell (for non-<br>
emergency calls) or acceptable cell (for emergency calls). In idle mode, when the UE<br>
has selected a cell, the UE is commonly referred to as "camping" on the cell. In RRC<br>
connected mode, when the UE is in CELL_PCH, URA_PCH, or CELL_FACH state,<br>
the UE is simply referred to as having "selected" a cell.<br>
[50]	To facilitate the cell reseleetion, the network transmits in the system information<br>
lists of neighboring cells. The lists of neighboring cells identify available cells the UE<br>
should measure and compare to the cell the UE has currently selected or the cell the<br><br>
UE camps on. The available cells may be on the same frequency, on other frequencies<br>
or on other Radio Access Technologies (RATs) such as GSM. The list of cells, and<br>
evtl. cells that the UE discovers itself are used as candidates for the cell reselection.<br>
[51]	One part of the cell selection/reselection process is based on measurements of the<br>
quality of the different cells that are part of the neighboring cell list that are candidates<br>
for cell reselection. A cell may or may :aot be part of a hierarchical cell structure<br>
(HCS). This is defined in the system information of the given cell. In case of the hi-<br>
erarchical cell structure, each cell has a given priority. Depending on whether the cell<br>
is part of the hierarchical cell structure or not, the cell selection procedure changes.<br>
[52]	To decide which of the candidate cells to reselect, the UE measures the quality of<br>
the neighboring cells. The UE uses a given formula to establish a ranking criteria R of<br>
all candidate cells. The formula is based on measurements on the CPICH/P-CCPCH<br>
and on information received in the system information of the candidate cell. The<br>
criterion R corresponds to a positive or negative value. The R value may be calculated<br>
by the following, wherein R is the R value for the serving cell R is the R value for<br>
neighboring cells:<br><br>
[53]	The signaled value Qoffrnbms is only applied to those cells (serving or<br>
neighboring) belonging to an MBMS Preferred Frequency (i.e., where a frequency<br>
convergence scheme is applied). Qmeas gives the quality value of the received signal<br>
derived from the averaged CPICH Ec/No or CPICH RSCP for FDD cells, from the<br>
averaged P-CCPCH RSCP for TDD cells and from the averaged received signal level<br>
for GSM cells. For FDD cells, the measurement that is used to derive the quality value<br>
is indicated in System Information.<br>
[54]	The parameters Qhyst, Qoffsets,n, Qoffmbms, TEMP_OFFSET and<br>
PENALTY_TIME are signaled on System information. The timer T is started and<br>
stopped for each cell depending on the radio quality of the cell.<br><br>
[55]	If a hierarchical cell structure (HCS) is used, then a criteria H is defined. The H<br>
criterion is a positive or negative value and is calculated based on information sent in<br>
the system information and on measurements from the CPICH/P-CPCCH of the<br>
candidate cell. In the hierarchical cell structure, a cell may have a different priority.<br>
The H criterion is calculated according to the following formula:<br><br>
[56]	TO and LN, Q and Q are defined similarly to the above definition. The aim<br>
n	meas,s	meas.n<br>
of such a cell structure is to cover in the same area users that have a low mobility as<br>
well as users with a high mobility. To optimize capacity, small-sized cells are preferred<br>
to accommodate as many cells as possible. Accordingly, this enables having a<br>
maximum number of users in a given area.<br>
[57]	However, for users that move quickly, it is preferable to have large-sized cells to<br>
reduce the number of cell changes as the UE moves. To distinguish between large-<br>
sized and small-sized cells, different priorities are attributed to the cell. The UE tends<br>
to select cells with the highest priority. This generally corresponds to small-sized cells,<br>
except when the UE is moving quickly. The H criterion is used in the 3GPP standard to<br>
take into account the priority. However, when the UE detects that it is moving quickly<br>
(i.e. by detecting that the UE reselects cells often), the UE ceases using the H criteria<br>
and no longer takes into account the priority level of the cell. The UE is then said to be<br>
in a "high mobility state".<br>
[58]	A selection criterion S checks whether the received quality of the candidate cell is<br>
sufficient. To do so the, UE measures Q , which expresses the E/N of the CPICH<br>
qualmeas	c 0<br>
of the candidate cell (only for FDD cells). The UE also measures Q	, which<br>
rxlevmeas<br>
evaluates the RSCP (Received Signal Code Power) of the CPICH of the candidate cell<br>
for FDD cells and the P-CCPCH of the candidate cell for TDD cells. The UE uses<br>
these values in an algorithm, together with information received in the system in-<br>
formation of the candidate cell, to calculate the S value. If the S value is higher than 0,<br>
the selection criterion S of the cell is fulfilled. Otherwise, it is not fulfilled.<br>
[59]	Apart from the criteria R, H and S explained above, other criteria might determine<br>
which cell the UE can select. The information on these criteria is given to the UE as<br>
"cell access restrictions", which are broadcast in the system information.<br>
[60]	One type of cell access restriction may be "barred cells." Each UE uses a parameter<br>
called "Access Class", which gives a kind of priority to the UE. The access classes that<br>
exist are in the range of 0 to 15. For each of the access classes in the system in-<br>
formation, it can be indicated whether a cell is barred or not. A cell can also be barred<br><br>
in general.<br>
[61]	Another type of cell access restriction is when a cell is "reserved for operator use".<br>
In the system information, it can be indicated whether a cell is reserved for operator<br>
use or not. Depending on whether the UE class is an operator class or not, and whether<br>
the UE is in an emergency call or not, the UE can reselect a cell which is reserved for<br>
operator use or not.<br>
[62]	Moreover, access to the cell may be restricted because it is "reserved for future<br>
extension". In the system information, it can be indicated whether a cell is reserved for<br>
future extension or not.<br>
[63]	Access to the cell may be restricted due to a PLMN. Each cell belongs to one or<br>
several PLMNs. When a UE is powered on, it selects a PLMN and can only change the<br>
selected PLMN by specific signaling. When the UE selects/reselects a cell, it checks<br>
whether the selected PLMN corresponds to the PLMN of the cell. A UE can use a list<br>
of "equivalent PLMNs", wherein an "equivalent PLMN" is treated as if it was equal to<br>
the selected PLMN. A UE that is not trying to do an emergency call can only select/<br>
reselect cells that belong to the selected PLMN or an equivalent PLMN of the selected<br>
PLMN.<br>
[64]	An "intra-frequency cell re-selection indicator" is also sent in the system in-<br>
formation to disallow the UE when the cell the UE has selected is barred from re-<br>
selecting another cell on the same frequency.<br>
[65]	Accordingly, the above "cell access restriction" attributes limit the number of<br>
candidate cells the UE can consider for cell selection/reselection. Referring to Figure 6,<br>
a decision process for cell reselection is illustrated.<br>
[66]	A major task of the RNC is radio resource management (RRM). Different RRC<br>
states, transport channels and physical channels with multiple parameters are available<br>
in the UMTS standard to optimize use of available radio resources.<br>
[67]	A basic method for RRM purposes is the RRC state transition between<br>
CELL_FACH, CELL_DCH, CELL_PCH and URA_PCH states. Combined with these<br>
states, when different frequencies are available for communication, the RNC can<br>
generally control the number of UEs using a given frequency. However, as described<br>
above, in CELL_FACH state, CELL_PCH state and URAJPCH state, the UEs can<br>
initiate, based on the measurements and the different rules, the transition from a cell in<br>
a given frequency to a cell in another frequency. The transition is either based on<br>
normal measurement and cell selection/reselection rules or based on a frequency layer<br>
convergence scheme.<br>
[68]	When the UE is moved from the CELL„DCH state to another state, the UE selects a<br>
cell to camp on or connect to. In general, the UE considers cells on all frequencies,<br>
except if the RNC indicates a preferred frequency in an information element (IE)<br><br>
"Frequency Info". In such a case, the UE preferably selects a cell on the preferred<br>
frequency if a suitable cell on the preferred frequency exists.<br>
[69]	When the UE is in CELL_FACH state, the RNC may prompt the UE to select a cell<br>
on another frequency as the preferred frequency by sending a message including the IE<br>
"Frequency Info" to the UE. The UE will then try to select a cell on the preferred<br>
frequency.<br>
[70]	The 3GPP system can provide multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS).<br>
The 3GPP TSG SA (Service and System Aspect) defines various network elements and<br>
their functions required for supporting MBMS services. A cell broadcast service<br>
provided by the prior art is limited to a service in which text type short messages are<br>
broadcast to a certain area. The MBMS service, however, is a more advanced service<br>
that multicasts multimedia data to terminals (UEs) that have subscribed to the cor-<br>
responding service in addition to broadcasting multimedia data.<br>
[71]	The MBMS service is a downward-dedicated service that provides a streaming or<br>
background service to a plurality of terminals by using a common or dedicated<br>
downward channel. The MBMS service is divided into a broadcast mode and a<br>
multicast mode. The MBMS broadcast mode facilitates transmitting multimedia data to<br>
every user located in a broadcast area, whereas the MBMS multicast mode facilitates<br>
transmitting multimedia data to a specific user group located in a multicast area. The<br>
broadcast area signifies a broadcast service available area and the multicast area<br>
signifies a multicast service available area.<br>
[72]	Figure 7 illustrates a process of providing a particular MBMS service, by using the<br>
multicast mode. The procedure can be split into two types of actions, those that are<br>
transparent and those that are not transparent to the UTRAN.<br>
[73]	The transparent actions are described in the following. A user desiring to receive<br>
the MBMS service, first needs to subscribe in order to be allowed to receive MBMS<br>
services, to receive information on MBMS services, and to join a certain set of MBMS<br>
services. A service announcement provides the terminal with a list of services to be<br>
provided and other related information. The user can then join these services. By<br>
joining, the user indicates that the user wants to receive information linked to services<br>
that the user has subscribed to and becomes part of a multicast service group. When a<br>
user is no longer interested in a given MBMS service, the user leaves the service, i.e.,<br>
the user is no longer part of the multicast service group. These actions can be taken by<br>
using any means of communication, i.e., the actions may be done using SMS (Short<br>
Messaging Service), or by Internet access. These actions do not have to necessarily be<br>
done using the UMTS system.<br>
[74]	In order to receive a service for which the user is in a multicast group the following<br>
actions that are not transparent to the UTRAN are executed. The SGSN informs the<br><br>
RNC about a session start. Then the RNC notifies the UEs of the multicast group that a<br>
given service has started in order to initiate reception of the given service. After having<br>
broadcast the necessary UE actions and eventually the configuration of the PtM bearers<br>
for the given service the transmission of the data starts. When the session stops, the<br>
SGSN indicates the stopped session to the RNC. The RNC in turn initiates a session<br>
stop. The transmission of the service from the SGSN means for the RNC to provide a<br>
bearer service for conveying the data of the MBMS service.<br>
[75]	After the notification procedure, other procedures can be initiated between the UE<br>
and the RNC and the SGSN to enable data transmission, such as RRC connection es-<br>
tablishment, connection establishment towards the PS domain, frequency layer<br>
convergence, and counting.<br>
[76]	Reception of an MBMS service may be performed in parallel to the reception of<br>
other services, such as a voice or video call on the CS domain, SMS transfer on the CS<br>
or PS domain, data transfer on the PS domain, or any signaling related to the UTRAN<br>
or PS or CS domain.<br>
[77]	Contrary to the multicast service, for broadcast services, as shown in Figure 8, only<br>
the announcement of the service must be done in a transparent manner. No sub-<br>
scription or joining is needed. Afterwards, the actions that are transparent to the RNC<br>
are the same as for multicast services.<br>
[78]	Referring to Figure 9, a typical session sequence from a UTRAN perspective is il-<br>
lustrated. As shown, the SGSN informs the RNC about a session start (step 1). The<br>
RNC may then perform a counting procedure, which triggers some UEs to establish a<br>
connection to the PS domain (step 2). Consequently, the establishment of an RRC<br>
connection for the UEs is initiated. This allows the RNC to estimate the number of<br>
UEs in a given cell that are interested in the service. When the UE has established the<br>
PS connection, the SGSN initiates the Iu linking procedure, which provides the list of<br>
multicast services the UE has joined to the RNC.<br>
[79]	For UEs that have an RRC connection established, and which are interested in the<br>
given MBMS service but are not connected to the PS domain, the RNC sends a<br>
specific message to the UEs triggering them to establish a PS connection (step 3).<br>
When the UE has established the PS connection, the SGSN initiates the Iu linking<br>
procedure, which provides the list of multicast services the UE has joined to the RNC.<br>
For UEs that are not in a CELL_DCH state, a frequency layer convergence scheme<br>
allows the RNC to trigger the UEs to change the frequency to which they listen (step<br>
4).<br>
[80]	Depending on the Radio Resource Management (RRM) scheme, the RNC es-<br>
tablishes point-to-multipoint (PtM) or point-to-point (PtP) radio bearers for delivering<br>
the MBMS service (step 5a or 5b). Tine RNC delivers data received from the SGSN to<br><br>
the UEs that are part of the multicast group. After the transmission of the data, the<br>
SGSN informs the RNC about the end of the sessions (step 6). The RNC then releases<br>
the PtP or PtM radio bearers used for transmitting the MBMS data (step 7a or 7b).<br>
[81]	Generally, for UEs in an RRC connected state, two possibilities exist. The UE will<br>
either have a connection established with the PS domain (PMM connected) or the UE<br>
will have no connection established with the PS domain (PMM idle mode). When there<br>
is no connection established with the PS domain, the UE will normally have a<br>
connection with the CS domain. Otherwise, the UE is not in an RRC connected mode.<br>
[82]	For MBMS, two additional control channels are introduced. They are the MCCH<br>
and the MICH (MBMS Notification Indicator Channel). As explained above, the<br>
MCCH is mapped on the FACH. The MICH is a new physical channel and is used to<br>
notify users to read the MCCH channel. The MICH is designed to allow the UEs to<br>
perform a DRX (Discontinuous Reception) scheme. DRX allows the reduction of<br>
battery consumption for UEs while allowing the UEs to still be aware of any service<br>
for which a session is starting. The MICH may be used to inform the UE of a change in<br>
a frequency convergence scheme, change of a configuration of a point-to-multipoint<br>
(PtM) bearer, switch between the PtM bearer and a point-to-point (PtP) bearer, etc.,<br>
which all require the MCCH to be read,.<br>
[83]	[083] The MCCH channel periodically transmits information regarding active<br>
services, MTCH configuration, frequency convergence, etc. The UE reads the MCCH<br>
information to receive the subscribed services based on different triggers. For example,<br>
the UE may be triggered after cell selection/reselection, when the UE is notified of a<br>
given service on the MICH, or when the UE is notified via the DCCH channel. The<br>
configuration of the MCCH channel is broadcast in the system information. The MICH<br>
configuration (i.e. spreading code, scrambling code, spreading factor and other in-<br>
formation) is either fixed in the standard, or given in the system information.<br>
[84]	The UMTS standard allows use of different frequency bands for data transmission.<br>
A frequency band in UMTS is in general specified by a UARFCN (UTRA Absolute<br>
Radio Frequency Channel Number), which defines the frequency band used. A given<br>
PLMN can use different frequencies.<br>
[85]	When a network uses different frequencies, the UEs in a given area select one of the<br>
frequencies based on the quality measured on the frequency. The UEs may also select<br>
the frequency based on other parameters given in the system information as explained<br>
above. To balance the load carried by the different frequencies, the UEs are distributed<br>
among the different frequencies. If a given MBMS service is then transmitted on a PtM<br>
radio bearer to reach UEs in all frequencies, the transmission must be done in all<br>
frequencies.<br>
[86]	To increase efficiency, it is advantageous to transmit data on one frequency only<br><br>
and have all UEs interested in a given service reselect a cell in that frequency. Ac-<br>
cordingly, this functionality is called "frequency convergence". The frequency layer to<br>
which the UEs should reselect is called a PFL (Preferred Frequency Layer). As shown<br>
in Figure 9, a typical MBMS session contains a period of "frequency convergence"<br>
(step 4).<br>
[87]	When the frequency convergence process is used for a given service, information<br>
regarding the preferred frequency for each service is transmitted in messages either on<br>
the MCCH or the system information. To trigger the reselection to the other frequency,<br>
different possibilities exist. One possibility is to force the UE to select a cell on the<br>
preferred frequency and to forbid all cells on other frequencies from participating in<br>
cell reselection/cell selection.<br>
[88]	Another possibility is to change the requirements for cell reselection. This may be<br>
done by adding an offset to the R criteria, S criteria or H criteria in one of the formulas<br>
needed to determine whether cell selection should be done. The offset may be added<br>
for the cells on the preferred frequency or for all cells on the non-preferred<br>
frequencies. Other possibilities can be envisaged for having the UE reselect a preferred<br>
frequency.<br>
[89]	For the hierarchical cell structure, the UE preferably reselects the cell with the<br>
highest priority. If a frequency convergence scheme is used, it is implied that the UE<br>
must be allowed to select a cell on the preferred frequency, disregarding the priority of<br>
the preferred frequency. Accordingly, use of the frequency convergence scheme may<br>
imply that the hierarchical cell structure should no longer be used.<br>
[90]	A PRACH channel is an uplink channel shared amongst different UEs. When a UE<br>
wants to send data in the uplink on a PRACH channel, a special mechanism exists to<br>
avoid having different UEs transmit at the same time. This mechanism is called<br>
"collision avoidance," and is implemented in the UMTS system based on a slotted<br>
Aloha system. The transmission of a message on the PRACH. channel is described in<br>
Figure 10.<br>
[91]	Before transmitting on the PRACH channel, the UE transmits a preamble to the<br>
NodeB. The preamble comprises a code (signature) the UE chooses randomly amongst<br>
the available signatures and transmits it on a special physical channel called a RACH<br>
sub-channel. The UE repeats this transmission several times until it receives a positive<br>
or negative acknowledgement indicator or a given number of retransmissions are<br>
exceeded. The NodeB listens to all sub-channels and tries to detect the given signatures<br>
transmitted by the UEs wanting to access the channel. When the NodeB has received<br>
the signature, it acknowledges the reception on a special physical channel (AICH) by<br>
transmitting a code for indicating to the UE whether the UE is granted access to the<br>
PRACH channel or not. Accordingly, the simultaneous transmission of several UEs on<br><br>
the PRACH channel is avoided.<br>
[92]	When a UE receives a Not Acknowledged message (NACK) or when the UE does<br>
not receive any Acknowledged message (ACK) or NACK on the AICH channel, the<br>
UE determines whether it is allowed to restart the collision avoidance process. If<br>
another collision avoidance process is allowed according to a fixed algorithm, the UE<br>
determines the time to wait before the next collision avoidance process is started.<br>
When the UE receives the ACK after a collision avoidance process, i.e. when the UE is<br>
granted access to the PRACH, the UE transmits a block set on the PRACH channel.<br>
[93]	As described above, a frequency convergence scheme optimizes the use of radio<br>
resources by concentrating all UEs interested in a given service onto a given<br>
frequency. As a result, some UEs may select a cell on a preferred frequency because<br>
they are subscribed to a given MBMS service even though the UEs would not select a<br>
cell on the preferred frequency if they were not joined to the MBMS service.<br>
[94]	A UE selecting a cell on the "preferred frequency" of an MBMS service to receive<br>
the MBMS service potentially has a worse quality of service. This is because po-<br>
tentially many UEs will select the cell or cells on the preferred frequency to receive a<br>
given MBMS service on the preferred frequency. Consequently, the load of the cell or<br>
cells on the frequency is increased. Also, the radio quality of the selected cell on the<br>
preferred frequency may be worse than the radio quality of another frequency.<br>
[95]	When a UE wants to establish a call or transmit data in the uplink, depending on the<br>
state/mode the UE is in, the UE needs to perform different actions according to the<br>
current standard, as shown in Table 1.<br>
[96] <br>
[97]	As described above, a UE using a frequency convergence scheme because it is<br><br>
joined to an MBMS service will potentially have problems transmitting data on the<br>
PRACH channel because of an overloaded cell or bad radio quality. Therefore, a<br>
special mechanism is needed to overcome these problems.<br>
[98]	The frequency convergence mechanism may also conflict with information on<br>
preferred frequencies sent by the RNC at transition from CELL_DCH to CELL_FACH<br>
or when the RNC indicates to a UE in a CELLJFACH state to reselect a cell in a given<br>
frequency. Accordingly, the efficiency of the system is potentially reduced because<br>
active UEs cannot be kept on a separate frequency.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[99]	The present invention is directed to interrupting use of a frequency layer<br>
convergence scheme that favors selection of a cell on a preferred frequency layer of a<br>
joined point-to-multipoint service.<br>
[100]	Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the de-<br>
scription which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be<br>
learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the<br>
invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the<br>
written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.<br>
[101]	To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the<br>
present invention, as embodied and broadly described, the present invention is<br>
embodied in a method for selecting a cell by a mobile terminal in a wireless com-<br>
munication system, the method comprising joining a point-to-multipoint service having<br>
a preferred frequency, using a frequency layer convergence scheme for selecting the<br>
cell, wherein the frequency layer convergence scheme favors the selection of the cell<br>
on the preferred frequency, and interrupting the use of the frequency layer convergence<br>
scheme upon an occurrence of a trigger. Preferably, the point-to-multipoint service is<br>
an MBMS service.<br>
[ 102]	In one aspect of the invention, the trigger for interrupting the use of the frequency<br>
layer convergence scheme is based on a procedure initiated with a network that fails<br>
while using the frequency layer convergence scheme. Preferably, the procedure with<br>
the network comprises establishing a connection with a core network (CN) domain.<br>
The CN domain is at least one of a packet switched (PS) domain and a circuit switched<br>
(CS) domain.<br>
[103]	In another aspect of the invention, the procedure with the network comprises at<br>
least one of a PRACH access procedure, a radio resource control (RRC) procedure for<br>
transmitting information to the network, a medium access control (MAC) procedure<br>
for transmitting data to the network, and a procedure for selecting a cell on a given<br><br>
frequency according to an order received from the network.<br>
[104]	In a further aspect of the invention, the trigger for interrupting the use of the<br>
frequency layer convergence scheme comprises receiving a message for initiating a re-<br>
configuration procedure. Alternatively, the trigger for interrupting the use of the<br>
frequency layer convergence scheme comprises initiating a procedure selecting a cell<br>
on a given frequency according to an order received from a network.<br>
[105]	Preferably, interrupting the use of the frequency layer convergence scheme<br>
continues until a timer expires. The timer is started when the frequency layer<br>
convergence scheme is first interrupted, a procedure initiated with a network<br>
comprising a PRACH access procedure fails, a procedure initiated with a network<br>
comprising a medium access control (MAC) procedure for transmitting data to the<br>
network fails, or a procedure initiated with a network comprising a procedure for<br>
selecting a cell on a given frequency according to an order received from the network<br>
fails.<br>
[106]	A value for duration of the timer is received in a system information message from<br>
a network. Alternatively, a value for duration of the timer is a fixed value.<br>
[107]	Preferably, the method further comprises selecting a cell on a frequency other than<br>
the preferred frequency. Moreover, the: method further comprises initiating a procedure<br>
with a network and continuing to interrupt the use of the frequency layer convergence<br>
scheme until the procedure initiated with the network ends. Also, the method further<br>
comprises initiating a procedure with a network, and releasing a connection with a core<br>
network (CN) domain when the procedure initiated with the network ends.<br>
[108]	In another embodiment of the present invention, a mobile terminal for selecting a<br>
cell in a wireless communication system comprises means for joining a point-<br>
to-multipoint service having a preferred frequency, means for using a frequency layer<br>
convergence scheme for selecting the cell, wherein the frequency layer convergence<br>
scheme favors the selection of the cell on the preferred frequency, and means for in-<br>
terrupting the use of the frequency layer convergence scheme upon an occurrence of a<br>
trigger. Preferably, the point-to-multipoint service is an MBMS service.<br>
[109]	In one aspect of the invention, the trigger for interrupting the use of the frequency<br>
layer convergence scheme is based on a procedure initiated with a network that fails<br>
while using the frequency layer convergence scheme. Preferably, the procedure with<br>
the network comprises establishing a connection with a core network (CN) domain.<br>
The CN domain is at least one of a packet switched (PS) domain and a circuit switched<br>
(CS) domain.<br>
[110]	In another aspect of the invention, the procedure with the network comprises at<br>
least one of a PRACH access procedure, a radio resource control (RRC) procedure for<br>
transmitting information to the network, a medium access control (MAC) procedure<br><br>
for transmitting data to the network, and a procedure for selecting a cell on a given<br>
frequency according to an order received from the network.<br>
[111]	In a further aspect of the invention, the trigger for interrupting the use of the<br>
frequency, layer convergence scheme comprises receiving a message initiating a recon-<br>
figuration procedure. Alternatively, the trigger for interrupting the use of the frequency<br>
layer convergence scheme comprises initiating a procedure for selecting a cell on a<br>
given frequency according to an order received from a network.<br>
[112]	Preferably, interrupting the Use of the frequency layer convergence scheme<br>
continues .until a timer expires. The timer is started when the frequency layer<br>
convergence scheme is first interrupted., a procedure initiated with a network<br>
comprising a PRACH access procedure fails, a procedure initiated with a network<br>
comprising a medium access control (1VIAC) procedure for transmitting data to the<br>
network fails, or a procedure initiated with a network comprising a procedure for<br>
selecting a cell on a given frequency according to an order received from the network<br>
fails.<br>
[113]	A value for duration of the timer is received in a system information message from<br>
a network. Alternatively, a value for duration of the timer is a fixed value.<br>
[114]	Preferably, the mobile terminal further comprises means for selecting a cell on a<br>
frequency other than the preferred frequency.. Moreover, the mobile terminal further<br>
comprises means for initiating a procedure with a network and means.for continuing to<br>
interrupt the use of the frequency layer convergence scheme until the procedure<br>
initiated with the network ends. Also, the mobile terminal further comprises means for<br>
initiating a procedure with a network and means for releasing a connection with a core<br>
. network (CN) domain when the procedure initiated with the network ends. ...<br>
[115]	It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
[129]	The present invention relates to a UE having joined a service for which a "preferred<br>
frequency" is defined but should not use a "frequency layer convergence" scheme<br>
under certain circumstances. For example, the frequency layer convergence scheme<br>
should not be used when the UE tries to establish a new call, or when the UE fails to<br>
access the network on the preferred frequency while using a method favoring a<br>
preferred frequency of a joined MBMS service.<br>
[130]	Several methods exist for determining whether the UE should stop applying a<br>
method favoring the selection of a cell on a given "preferred frequency". Preferably,<br>
when the frequency layer convergence scheme is interrupted for the preferred<br>
frequency, it should be interrupted for any service for which the preferred frequency is<br>
the given frequency.<br>
[131]	In accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention, the UE stops using<br>
the frequency layer convergence scheme when certain conditions occur as a result of<br>
using the frequency convergence scheme. Preferably, during a PRACH access<br>
procedure, when the UE receives in a MAC layer notification that a collision<br>
avoidance process has failed in a physical layer, or when the UE receives a NACK on<br>
the AICH channel or receives no response at all from a NodeB, or when a MAC<br>
procedure for transmitting data on the preferred frequency fails as a result of the UE<br>
using the frequency layer convergence scheme, the UE ceases to use the scheme.<br>
[132]	In accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention, the UE stops<br>
using the frequency layer convergence scheme when the UE must perform a specific<br><br>
procedure, such as when the UE tries to perform an emergency call. Another specific<br>
procedure is when the NAS (Non-Access Stratum) layers indicate to the AS (Access<br>
Stratum) layer of the UE to establish a connection with a CN domain for a specific<br>
reason, such as Originating Conversational Call, Originating Streaming Call,<br>
Originating Interactive Call, Originating Background Call, Originating Subscribed<br>
Traffic Call, Terminating Conversational Call, Terminating Streaming Call,<br>
Terminating Interactive Call, Terminating Background Call, Emergency Call, Inter-<br>
RAT cell re-selection, Inter-RAT cell change order, Registration, Detach, Originating<br>
High Priority Signaling, Originating Low Priority Signaling, Call Re-establishment,<br>
Terminating High Priority Signaling, Teraiinating Low Priority Signaling,<br>
Terminating-cause unknown, or any subset of these reasons.<br>
[133]	In accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention, the UE stops using<br>
the frequency layer convergence scheme when the UE is asked to select a cell on a<br>
given frequency, either in CELL_FACH state, in CELLJPCH state, in URA_PCH state<br>
or in idle mode.<br>
[134]	When the UE stops using the frequency layer convergence scheme for one of the<br>
above reasons, it becomes necessary to also define a method for restarting the<br>
frequency layer convergence scheme again. Preferably, a trigger for restarting the<br>
frequency layer convergence scheme may be when the procedure that triggered the<br>
stoppage of the frequency layer convergence scheme is finished successfully or unsuc-<br>
cessfully. Alternatively, at a point when use of the frequency layer convergence<br>
scheme is stopped, the UE may start a timer such T	. At the end of a time<br>
freq_conv_int<br>
period of the timer, use of the frequency layer convergence scheme is restarted. Ac-<br>
cordingly, this limits interruption of the use of the frequency layer convergence<br>
scheme. Preferably, the timer is broadcast on the system information of the cell.<br>
[135]	Referring to Figure 11, a method for executing an emergency call by a UE with<br>
respect to a frequency layer convergence scheme is illustrated. Initially, the UE in a<br>
CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH,.URA_PCH or idle mode begins using a frequency layer<br>
convergence scheme (step 1). This allows the UE to reselect a preferred frequency.<br>
Subsequently, when NAS indicates to the AS that a connection to a CN domain must<br>
be established, a specific cause value is given to the UE (step 2).<br>
[136]	Based on the cause value, the UE may stop use of the frequency layer convergence<br>
scheme (step 3). Accordingly, when the UE stops using the frequency layer<br>
convergence scheme, the UE changes; the way it evaluates the neighboring cells. When<br>
the UE needs to establish a connection to a core network domain when the UE is in an<br>
idle mode, CELL_FACH, CELLJPCH or URA_PCH state, it is implied that the UE<br>
must transmit a message, such as Cell Update, RRC Connection Request and/or Initial<br>
Direct transfer, on the PRACH channel to the NodeB (step 4).<br><br>
[137]	When the current cell or cells on the current frequency are loaded, the PRACH<br>
channel access may fail on the current Itequency (step 5). Eventually, the UE will<br>
reselect a cell on another frequency as the preferred frequency since the frequency<br>
layer convergence scheme is no longer used (step 6). After the cell reselection, access<br>
to the PRACH will have a higher chance of succeeding because the best cell is chosen<br>
(step7).<br>
[138]	After the call is finished, the connection to the GN domain is released (step 8). The<br>
UE will then restart use of the frequency layer convergence scheme if it is still applied<br>
(step 9).<br>
. [139]	Referring to Figure 12, a method for stopping frequency layer convergence by a UE<br>
based on a timer is illustrated. Initially, the UE in a CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH,<br>
URA_PCH or idle mode begins using a frequency layer convergence scheme (step 1).<br>
This allows the UE to reselect a preferred frequency.<br>
[140]	Subsequently, any one of a number of events may occur (step 2). For example, the<br>
NAS may indicate to the AS that a connection to a CN domain must be established and<br>
gives a specific cause value to the UE. Or an RRC procedure is started which requires<br>
transmission in the uplink. Also, the transmission of data in the uplink may be started.<br>
Or the UE may be ordered to select a cell on a given preferred frequency.<br>
[141]	Accordingly, the UE ceases use of the frequency layer convergence scheme. When<br>
the UE stops using the frequency layer convergence scheme, the UE will change the<br>
way it evaluates the neighboring cells. Also, upon stopping the use of the scheme, the<br>
UE starts a timer T	(step 3). The duration of the timer may be a fixed value, or<br>
freq_convjnt<br>
the UE may utilize a value read in the system information.<br>
[142]	The UE then transmits data on the PRACH channel to the NodeB (step 4). When<br>
the current cell or cells on the current frequency are loaded, the PRACH channel<br>
access may fail on the current frequency (step 5).<br>
[143]	An alternative to starting the timer T	in step 3 is to start it once the first<br>
fteq_cotiv_int<br>
PRACH access procedure has failed (step 6). The PRACH access procedure may fail<br>
due to a reception of a NACK, no reception of a response message, or when a retry<br>
mechanism in the MAC layer has timed out, such that there is no more retransmission.<br>
The duration of the timer may be a fixed value, or the UE may utilize a value read in<br>
the system information.<br>
[144]	Eventually, the UE will reselect a cell on another frequency as the preferred<br>
frequency since the method for frequency layer convergence scheme is no longer used<br>
(step 7). After the cell reselection, access to the PRACH will have a higher chance of<br>
success because the best cell is chosen (step 8).<br>
[145]	When the timer T	expires and after the call has ended, the connection to the<br>
freq_conv_int<br>
CN domain is released (step 9). The UE will then restart use of the frequency layer<br><br>
convergence scheme if it is still applied (step 10).<br>
[146]	Accordingly, the present invention ensures a UE having joined an MBMS service,<br>
will have the same or similar chance of success in establishing a new call/emergency<br>
call or transmitting data, as the same UE not having joined an MBMS service.<br>
[147]	Although the present invention is described in the context of mobile com-<br>
munication, the present invention may also be used in any wireless communication<br>
systems using mobile devices, such as PDAs and laptop computers equipped with<br>
wireless communication capabilities. Moreover, the use of certain terms to describe the<br>
present invention should not limit the scope of the present invention to a certain type of<br>
wireless communication system. The present invention is also applicable to other<br>
wireless communication systems using different air interfaces and/or physical layers,<br>
for example, TDMA, CDMA, FDMA, WCDMA, etc.<br>

of manufacture using standard programming and/or engineering techniques to produce<br>
software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof. The term "article of<br>
manufacture" as used herein refers to code or logic implemented in hardware logic<br>
