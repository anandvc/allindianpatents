				<td>Description<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing 1-alkyl-3-phenyluracils of the<br>
formula I <br>
where the variables are as defined below:	<br>
R1 is C1-C6-alkyl;<br>
R2 and R3 independently of one another are<br>
hydrogen, C1-C6-alkyl or C1-C6-haloalkyl;<br>
R4 and R5 independently of one another are<br>
hydrogen, halogen, cyano, C1-C6-alkyl or C1-C6-haloalkyi;<br>
R6 and R7 independently of one another are<br>
hydrogen, C1-C6-alkyl, C1-C6-alkoxy, C3-C6-alkenyI, C3-C6-alkynyl, C3-C6-<br>
cycloalkyl, C3-C6-cycloalkenyl, phenyl or benzyl;<br>
by reacting 3-phenyluracils of the formula II<br>
where the variables R2 to R7 are as defined above<br>
and alkylating agents of the formula III<br>
R1-L1	IN,<br>
where R1 is as defined above, and<br>
L1 is halogen, hydrogensulfate, C1-C6-alkyl sulfate, C1-C6-alkyl carbonate, C1-C6-<br><br>
alkylsulfonyloxy, C1-C6-haloalkylsulfonyloxy or phenylsulfonyloxy,<br>
where the phenyl ring may carry one or more substituents from the group<br>
consisting of halogen, nitro, C1-C6-alkyl and C1-C6-haloalkyl;<br>
wherein during the entire reaction the pH is kept in a range from 1 to 6 by adding base<br>
a little at a time.<br>
1-Alkyl-3-phenyluracils of the general formula I are known in principle from<br>
WO 01/83459. They can be prepared as taught in WO 01/83459.<br>
N-alkylations at the free uracil nitrogen atom by reacting a uracil compound with an<br>
alkylating agent are described, for example, in US 4,943,309.<br>
Furthermore, the preparation of 1-alkyl-3-phenyluracils having a sulfamide side-chain is<br>
described in PCT/EP/04/013615.<br>
However, these procedures have the disadvantage that, owing to the fact that the<br>
sulfamide side chain can be alkylated easily, side reactions such as, for example,<br>
alkylation at the sulfonamide nitrogen atom or formation of dialkylated products occur.<br>
Correspondingly, it is already known to alkylate sulfuric acid diamides in a simple<br>
manner using sulfuric acid diesters or arenesulfonic acid esters in the presence of a<br>
base (for example R. Sowada, J. Prakt. Chem. 25, 88,1964).<br>
Furthermore, for trisubstituted sulfuric acid diamides, the formation of tetrasubstituted<br>
sulfuric acid diamides is known (for example B. Unterhalt, E. Seebach, Arch. Pharm.<br>
314,51,1981).<br>
It is also possible to alkylate sulfuric acid diamides where the amide function already<br>
carries an acyl radical (for example K. C. C. Bancroft et al., J. Heterocycl. Chem. 15,<br>
1521, 1978; A. Martinez et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 9, 21, 3133, 1999).<br>
Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a simple and economical<br>
process for preparing 1-alkyl-3-phenyluracils of the formula I which suppresses<br>
unwanted side reactions, such as, for example, the formation of diaikylated side<br>
products, and which, at the same time, allows high yields and a product of value of high<br>
purity to be obtained.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that this object is achieved by a process where<br><br>
3-phenyluracils of the formula II<br><br>
where the variables R2 to R7 are as defined above<br>
and alkylating agents of the formula III<br>
R1-L1	III,<br>
where R1 is as defined above and<br>
L1 is a nucleophilically displaceable leaving group<br>
are reacted with one another,<br>
wherein during the entire reaction the pH is kept in a range from 1 to 6 by adding base<br>
a little at a time.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for preparing 1-alkyl-3-<br>
phenyluracils of the formula I which comprises the reaction of 3-phenyluracils of the<br>
formula II and alkylating agents of the formula III, wherein during the entire reaction the<br>
pH is kept in a range from 1 to 6 by adding base a little at a time.<br>
The process according to the invention affords 1-alkyl-3-phenyiuracils of the formula I<br>
in high yields and high purities.<br>
This is surprising with a view to the fact that the 3-phenyluracil of the formula II<br>
employed has, both at the uracil ring and in the side chain, a reactive NH group which<br>
can be alkylated.<br>
Thus, the person skilled in the art would expect a large number of side reactions, for<br>
example the formation of corresponding N-alkylsulfonamides or mixtures of<br>
N-alkylsulfonamides or N-alkyl-substituted uracils including the formation of oligomers<br>
or polymers.<br>
Depending on the substitution pattern, the 1-alkyl-3-phenyluracils of the formula I may<br>
contain one or more centers of chirality, in which case they are present as enantiomers<br>
or diastereomer mixtures. Thus, the invention provides a process for preparing both the<br>
pure enantiomers or diastereomers and their mixtures.<br><br>
The 1-alkyl-3-phenyluracils of the formula I may also be present in the form of their<br>
agriculturally useful salts, the type of salt generally being immaterial. Sultable are, in<br>
general, the salts of those cations or the acid addition salts of those acids whose<br>
cations and anions, respectively, have no adverse effect on the herbicidal action of the<br>
compounds I.<br>
Sultable cations are in particular ions of the alkali metals, preferably lithium, sodium<br>
and potassium, of the alkaline earth metals, preferably calcium and magnesium, and of<br>
the transition metals, preferably manganese, copper, zinc and iron, and also<br>
ammonium, where, if desired, one to four hydrogen atoms may be replaced by C1-C4-<br>
alkyl, hydroxy-C1-C4alkyl, C1-C4alkoxy-C1-C4-alkyl, hydroxy-C1-C4alkoxy-C1-C4alkyl,<br>
phenyl or benzyl, preferably ammonium, dimethylammonium, diisopropylammonium,<br>
tetramethylammonium, tetrabutylammonium, 2-(2-hydroxyeth-1 -oxy)eth-1 -<br>
ylammonium, di(2-hydroxyeth-1-yl)ammonium, trimethylbenzylammonium, furthermore<br>
phosphonium ions, sulfonium ions, preferably tri(C1-C4-alkyI)sulfonium, and<br>
sulfoxonium ions, preferably tri(C1-C4-alkyl)sulfoxonium.<br>
Anions of useful acid addition salts are primarily chloride, bromide, fluoride, hydrogen<br>
sulfate, sulfate, dihydrogenphosphate, hydrogenphosphate, nitrate,<br>
hydrogencarbonate, carbonate, hexafluorosilicate, hexafluorophosphate, benzoate and<br>
the anions of C1-C4-alkanoic acids, preferably formate, acetate, propionate and<br>
butyrate.<br>
The organic moieties mentioned for the substituents R1 - R7 or as radicals on phenyl<br>
rings are collective terms for individual enumerations of the individual group members.<br>
All hydrocarbon chains, i.e. all alky!, haloalkyl, alkoxy, alkenyl and alkynyl moieties, can<br>
be straight chain or branched. Unless indicated otherwise, halogenated substituents<br>
preferably carry one to five identical or different halogen atoms. Halogen means in<br>

a range of from 2 to 6;<br>
very preferably from 3 to 6;<br>

"Adding base a little at a time" means that the addition of base during the reaction is in<br>
individual portions, i.e. in at least 2 portions, or in more than 2 up to many portions, or<br>
continuously.<br>
In particular embodiments of the process according to the invention, the pH can, during<br>
the reaction, be kept by different means by adding base a little at a time in the range<br>
from 1 to 6, these embodiments being particular embodiments of the process according<br>
to the invention, both on their own and in combination:<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention, at the beginning<br>
of the reaction, the pH is adjusted to between 1 and 6 and then, during the reaction,<br>
kept constant at the value adjusted at the beginning.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention, the pH<br>
adjusted to between 1 and 6 during the beginning of the reaction is continuously<br>
changed to another pH in the range from 1 to 6 during the reaction.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention, the<br>
continuous change of the pH during the reaction is repeated, where this repetition may<br>
be carried out as many times as desired.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention, the pH is<br>
initially, during the beginning of the reaction, adjusted to between 1 and 6 and initially<br>
kept constant at the adjusted value. After partial reaction, this is then changed to a<br>
different pH in the range of from 1 to 6, which is then again kept constant at the newly<br>
adjusted value. This newly adjusted pH can then, after partial reaction, again be<br>
changed to a different pH in the range of from 1 to 6, i.e. the adjusted pH in the range<br>
of from 1 to 6 can, after partial reaction, be changed as many times as desired. This<br>
means that the pH adjusted to between 1 and 6 during the beginning of the reaction is<br>
changed one or more times, in each case after partial reaction, to a different pH in the<br>
range of from 1 to 6, the respective changed pH being kept constant until the next<br>

desired and/or be repeated as often as desired.<br>
The pH adjusted during the beginning of the reaction to between 1 and 6 may be<br>
higher than the pH value adjusted by the pH change or than the pH values adjusted by<br><br>
the pH changes.<br>
Furthermore, the pH adjusted during the beginning of the reaction to between 1 and 6<br>
may be lower than the pH value adjusted by the pH change or than the pH values<br>
adjusted by the pH changes.<br>
In addition, the pH adjusted during the beginning of the reaction to between 1 and 6<br>
may be in between the pH values adjusted by the pH changes.<br>
Particularly preferably, the pH adjusted during the beginning of the reaction to between<br>
1 and 6 is higher than the pH value adjusted by the pH change or than the pH values<br>
adjusted by the pH changes.<br>

by periodic or continuous measurement of the pH.<br>

formula III and the base can be brought into contact in any way per se, the base being<br>

vessel and reacted separately, simultaneously or successively, the base being added a<br>
little at a time.<br>
Preferably, the 3-phenyiuracils of the formula II and the alkylating agents of the formula<br>
III are initially charged in a reaction vessel, if appropriate with the desired solvent, and<br>
the desired reaction conditions are then established by adding base a little at a time.<br>
However, it is also possible to introduce into the reaction vessel the major amount or<br>
total amount of 3-phenyluracils of the formula II and the alkylating agents of the formula<br>
III, if appropriate in a solvent, and establishing the desired reaction conditions by<br>
adding base a little at a time.<br>

3-phenyluracils I can then be taken up in a water-immiscible organic solvent, any<br>
impurities are then extracted using water which, if appropriate, is acidified, the product<br>
is dried and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. For further purification, it<br>
is possible to use customary processes such as crystallization, precipitation or<br>
chromatography.<br><br>

and the mixture was heated at 40°C. A pH of 5.3-5.5 was then established in the<br>
reaction mixture by addition of aqueous 10% strength NaOH solution.<br>
The mixture was stirred at 40°C for 1 h, during which time further aqueous 10%<br>
