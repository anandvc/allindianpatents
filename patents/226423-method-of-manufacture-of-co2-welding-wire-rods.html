				<td>The invention relates to a method of manufacture of CO2<br>
welding wire rods by direct drawing from improved wire rod<br>
materials.<br>
CO2 welding wire rod is used as a filler material for<br>
continuous welding by inert gas welding process in manufacturing<br>
industries.<br>
Carbon dioxide (CO2) welding wires are used for continuous<br>
welding in fabrication of structural components. Higher<br>
productivity levels, requirements of semi-skilled labour, and<br>
good weld quality has made CO2 welding the most sought after<br>
metal joining process, particularly in developing countries.<br>
Till recently the production of a CO2 wires of 1.2mm<br>
diameter were being produced by direct drawing from 5.5mm<br>
diameter wire rods.<br>
Major requirement of the industry of CO2 wires were 1.2mm<br>
diameter and was being met by TISCO. Meanwhile there was a<br>
substantial shift in the requirement of wire size by the end<br>
users. The growing automobile sector required more of 0.8mm<br>
wires in place of 1.2mm diameter wire for sheet metal and small<br>
component welding.<br><br>
With the present technology it is not possible to direct<br>
draw CO2 wire from 5.5mm to 0.8mm diameter and additional process<br>
steps of annealing and pickling is required by the wire drawers<br>
thus increasing the cost.<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention is to<br>
produce 0.8mm diameter CO2 wires by direct drawing without the<br>
additional operation of annealing and pickling.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to develop an<br>
improved material with modification of chemistry producing direct<br>
draw quality wire rods of 1.2mm and 0.8mm.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a<br>
method of manufacture of CO2 welding wire rods by direct drawing<br>
from improved wire rod materials comprising the following steps:<br>
i) low carbon-high manganese is processed at the wire rod<br>
mill with rolling parameters having Laying heat temperature<br>
(LHT) conveyor speed and mill speed to obtain a time ferrite<br>
containing microstructure and suitable mechanical property;<br>
ii) the conveyor speed is fixed based on continuous cooling<br>
experiments carried out in a thermal simulator;<br>
iii) transformation start temperature is 817°C and the finish<br>
temperature is 560°C which is then cooled under a cooling rate<br>
of 0.4°C/sec and a conveyor speed of 0.15m/sec of 0.175m/sec;<br>
iv) wire rods of diameter of 5.5mm is then direct drawn to<br>
1.8mm or 0.8mm diameter without any intermediate operations<br>
of annealing and pickling.<br><br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further<br>
advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the<br>
following description made with reference to the non limiting<br>
embodiments of the invention represented in the accompanying<br>
drawings:<br>
Figure 1 shows graphically the experiment results of trans-<br>
formation start and finish temperatures.<br>
Figure 2 shows microstructure at 3500 magnification.<br>
The improved material has been developed based on the following<br>
criteria:<br>
Producing steel with consistently low carbon (0.07-0.09%C)<br>
by adding low carbon silico-mzanganese, which is cheaper<br>
alternative to low carbon ferro-manganese.<br>
Eliminate re-blow in LD converter to keep N2 ppm for 0.8mm<br>
diameter wire.<br>
Control WRM processing parameters (laying head temperature,<br>
conveyor speed, and mill speed) properly to obtain a time<br>
ferrite containing mcirostructure and suitable (UTS 575 MPa)<br>
mechanical properties with minimum variation.<br><br>
For drawing to 1.2mm diameter wires, the rod chemistry<br>
should have a relatively leaner chemistry (C% = 0.07-0.09,<br>
Mn%l.40-1.50, N2 
reduction of area (RA) &gt; 78% , and a non-adherent scale.<br>
The specification of CO2, wire rod is given in Table 1.<br>
Table 1: Specification of CO2 welding wire rod<br><br>
It is important to note that nitrogen is responsible for<br>
strain ageing during drawing and hardens the stock material.<br>
For 0.8mm diameter it is essential to have a lower nitrogen<br>
level with uniform microstructure and properties over the length<br>
of the coil. The UTS should preferably less than 525MPa with<br>
RA over 78%. With the advent of more automobile industries,<br>
the requirement of 0.8mm diameter wires is expected to rise.<br>
Accordingly, the rod rolling parameters (laying head temperature<br>
mill speed, and conveyor speed) required to be adjusted to<br>
achieve the final properties.<br><br>
The experimental work was related to the following specific<br>
areas.<br>
Generation of continuous cooling curves for<br>
identification of transformation temperature and assessment<br>
of final microstructure using Gleeble 150<br>
Heat balance calculation for steelmaking at LD1 using low<br>
carbon silico manganese.<br>
Strain Ageing index (SAI) determination with different<br>
nitrogen levels.<br>
Commercial heat making at LDI and rolling at WRM.<br><br>
Mechanical property evaluation.<br>
Drawing at customers end.<br>
The rolling parameters that include laying head temperature (LHT)<br>
and conveyor speed were fixed based on continuous cooling<br>
experiments carried out in a thermal simulator, Gleeble - 1500.<br>
A large number of Experiments (Fig-1) suggested that the<br>
transformation start temperature was 817°C and the finish<br>
temperature was 560°C when cooled under a cooling rate of<br>
0.4°C/sec. The cooling rate of 0.4°C/sec relates to the retarded<br>
Stelmor effect with conveyor speed corresponding to 0.15m/sec.<br>
The WRM parameters were fine-tuned to obtain the desired ASTM<br>
grain size of 9-10 and ferrite fraction of 90% or higher.<br><br>
The Stelmor cooling was made effected by increasing the<br>
mill speed to 78m/sec with a conveyor speed of 0.15-0.175m/sec.<br>
By doing so, the volume fraction pearlite revolved around 10%.<br>
The interlammelar spacing of: the pearlite was extremely fine<br>
and could be resolved at 3500 magnificant (Fig.2) using SEM.<br>
Microstructure, mechanical and corrosion properties of wire<br>
rod:<br>
With close control of rolling parameters, a consistent<br>
microstructure with low pearlite content and fine ferrite grain<br>
size is obtained. A suitable microstructure for direct drawing<br>
draw wire rods should have 9-11% fine pearlite and ferrite<br>
grain size of 10-12µm. Large deviation in the rolling conditions<br>
bring about marked difference in the micro-structual<br>
characteristicsm which is subsequently reflected in the<br>
mechanical properties of the wire rod. By adopting proper rolling<br>
conditions the USTS obtained in most cases 525MPa,<br>
El.% ~ 38, and RA% ~ 78. The properties that have been obtained<br>
in wires for direct drawing application are given in the<br>
following table:<br><br><br>
Evaluation of Strain Ageing Index (SAI):<br>
During drawing the temperature of the wire rod rises to<br>
100-150°C due to frictionai contact with surface of the dies,<br>
it is well established that interstitial elements like carbon<br>
and nitrogen tend to cause dynamic strain ageing and eventually<br>
increases the strength of the semi-drawn rod and affects further<br>
drawing. Tensle tests were carried out to determine the SAI<br>
of the wire rods with different nitrogen content between 42<br>
ppm to 74 ppm. This was done to study the effect of nitrogen<br>
on drawability as a result of strain ageing.<br><br>
It has been established that a low carbon-high manganese<br>
chemistry for CO2 welding wire rods can be made using low<br>
carbon ( ~ 1%C) silico manganese ferro-alloy.<br>
Commercial heats are being processed with nitrogen content<br>
consistently blow 70 ppm for 1.2 mm diameter wires and below<br>
50 ppm for 0.8 mm diameter wires.<br>
For producing 0.8 mm diameter wires, the wire rods are being<br>
processed with close control in chemistry, cleanliness and<br>
microstructure. Rods with nitrogen less than 50 ppm, UTS of<br>
around 515 MPa and RA% of 80 make suitable wire rods for direct<br>
drawing.<br>
With proper monitoring of parameters (LHT=800-820°C,<br>
CS=0.15-0.17m/min, MS-105%) at wire rod mill (WRM) the<br>
microstructure and mechanical properties have been found<br>
satisfactory for direct drawing application. Wide deviation<br>
in parameters causes property variation within the coil and<br>
from one coil to another and renders it unsuitable for direct<br>
draw application.<br>
Direct drawing trials on several heats (M37785, M37961 and<br>
M38562) were tired at customer end and was found suitable. Wires<br>
of 0.8 mm diameter and 1.2 mm diameter were drawn from 5.5 mm<br>
wire rods.<br>
The invention described hereinabove is in relation to the<br>
non-limited embodiments defined by the accompanying claims.<br><br>
