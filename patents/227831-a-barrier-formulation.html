				<td>IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO ORGANIC MATERIAL<br>
The invention relates to an improved barrier formulation and a method for its manufacture.<br>
Barrier creams or lotions are useful in a number of applications. For.example, barrier creams or lotions can be useful where protective clothing cannot be used or is not appropriate. This is to solve the problems of contact dermatitis and hospital acquired infection.<br>
Contact dermatitis can arise for workers in certain environments such as hairdressing, health care etc. It is generally caused by substances that come into contact with the skin. A substance that causes allergic contact dermatitis is called an "allergen". If a person is allergic to an allergen, then contact between that allergen and the person's skin can produce itching and blisters (allergic contact dermatitis). Allergic contact dermatitis is not usually caused by irritants such as acid, alkali, solvents, strong soap or detergent. However some chemicals are both irritants and allergens. Examples of known allergens include nickel, rubber, para-phenylene-diamine hair dye, neomycin, chromates, and plant products.<br>
The problem with existing barrier formulations is that they do not last particularly long before losing their properties and have to be frequently re-applied. Therefore they do not provide complete protection against allergens. A way of ameliorating this problem has been sought.<br>
Hospital acquired infection (HAI) is a major cause for concern in the clinical setting. In the UK, it is estimated that approximately 9% of in-patients have a HAI at any one time, which equates to at least 300,000 infections per annum (National Audit Office, "The Management and Control of Hospital Acquired Infection in acute NHS Trusts in England', London: Stationery Office 2000). The costs associated with treating HAI are difficult to measure, however results from a recent study undertaken by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the<br>
Central Public Health Laboratory, suggest that HAI may be costing the NHS as much as £1 billion per year (ibid). It is not possible to prevent all HAIs, however, the National Audit Office report suggests that HAIs could be reduced by up to 15% through better application of existing knowledge and realistic and effective infection control practices (ibid).<br>
Hand hygiene is one of the basic components of any infection control program and is possibly the most important factor in preventing HAI. Indeed, outbreaks originating from a common source have been traced to contaminated hands of health care workers (HCW) (Boyce JM, Potter-Bynoe G, Opal SM et al "A Common-Source Outbreak of Staphylococcus epidermidis Infections among Patients undergoing Cardiac Surgery Journal of Infectious Diseases 1990; 161: 493-499). In a recent survey, it was demonstrated that HCW understand the importance of hand hygiene as a means of preventing infection and are in favour of interventions that make hand hygiene easier (Harris AD, Samore MH, Nafziger R et al "A Survey on Hand Washing Practices and Opinions of Healthcare Workers" Journal of Hospital Infection 2000; 45:318-21). However, studies have also consistently demonstrated that HCW frequently do not wash their hands and compliance rates are low (Pittet D, Mourouga P, Perneger TV "Compliance with Handwashing in a Teaching Hospital" Ann Intern Med 1999; 130:126-130).<br>
The recent EPIC evidence based guidelines on hand hygiene, commissioned by the Department of Health (Pratt RJ, Pellowe C, Loveday HP et al "The EPIC Project: Developing National Evidence-Based Guidelines for Preventing Healthcare Associated Infections, Phase I: Guidelines for Preventing Hospital Acquired Infections' Journal of Hospital Infection 2001; 47 (suppl): Sl-82) recommends that formal hand washing with soap and water should be undertaken by HCW when hands are visibly soiled or contaminated, and alcohol-glycerol hand rub used between patients. These methods of hand hygiene require adequate cleansing facilities, including suitably located sinks and gel dispensers of sufficient numbers, which may not always be present within the clinical setting. In view of the lack of<br>
compliance with hand hygiene and despite many initiatives, new ways of ameliorating this problem have been sought.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a bander formulation which comprises an emulsion having at least an oil phase comprising a silicone compound and an aqueous phase, the viscosity of the formulation being 20 Pascal second (20000) cps or less, and the formulation further comprising an active ingredient, and one or more of an emollient, an excipient, a thickener, an emulsifier, a • neutralising agent, a preservative, and water.<br>

The formulation may further comprise a fragrance. The formulation may further comprise an emulsifier. The emulsifier may be selected from one or more stearate derivatives, for example glyceryl monostearate. The formulation may further comprise a neutralising agent. The neutralising agent may be selected from one or more of triethanolamine, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. The formulation may further comprise water.<br>
In the method of the invention, the water phase may be added to the oil phase to obtain an oil-in-water emulsion, in which oil phase droplets are surrounded by water. It has been found that the formulation according to the invention has greater efficacy when it is in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion.<br>
The addition of a neutralising agent to the mixture of oil phase and water phase is critical since the agent can only neutralise following the emulsification. This reaction not only adjusts the pH but also the viscosity of the finished product. It is particularly important when the formulation contains a carbomer as a thickener because the carbomer needs to be neutralised. A carbomer is a homopolymer of<br>
acrylic acid crosslinked with an allyl ether of pentaerythritol, and ally! ether of sucrose, or an allyl ether of propylene.<br>
A suitable neutralising agent for use in the method of the invention is an alkaline agent Hie neutralising agent may be triethanolamine, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide.<br>

A 2cm2 area was designated on the left hand of each volunteer and 50 ul of Staphylococcus epidermidis NCTC 9865 at a concentration of approximately 1 x 104 cfu/mL was applied and allowed to dry. S. epidermidis NCTC 9865 was selected as an indicator microorganism as it produces a red pigment when grown on nutrient agar.<br>
At 1 hour, each 2cm2 section was swabbed and cultured directly onto nutrient agar (Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, UK). Three volunteers then washed their hands thoroughly with either soap and water, 4% chlorhexidine gluconate or 70% isopropanol. All plates were incubated at 37°C in air for 48 hours. This process was repeated over a four-hour period at hourly intervals and on two consecutive days. The mean numbers of viable S. epidermidis NCTC 9865, recovered from the hands of the volunteers are shown in Table 4.<br>
TABLE 4<br>
(Table 4 Removed)<br>
Colony forming units of 5. epidermidis NCTC 9865 recovered from a 2cm2 area of skin on the hands of volunteers.<br><br>
The results show that the formulation of Example 2 retained its antibacterial activity over a 4-hour period when challenged with between 3.2 x 102 and 4.4 x 102 cfu of S. epidermidis NCTC 9865. Three applications of soap and water, and 4% chlorhexidine gluconate to the hands during the study period did not affect the bactericidal activity of the formulation. Following a third application of 70% isopropanol, 13 cfu of S. epidermidis NCTC 9865 was recovered at 4 hours from one volunteer, however this still represented a 3.1 x 102 cfu reduction in viable microorganisms compared to the loading inoculum.<br>
The results of this preliminary investigation demonstrate the usefulness of the formulation according to the invention as an effective anti-microbial barrier cream.<br>
EXAMPLES A barrier formulation having the ingredients listed hi Table 5 was prepared as follows.<br>
(Table 5 Removed)<br>
Silicon fluid 200/100 CS is a dimethicone.<br>
The ingredients of phase A were melted together at temperature 65-80°C until clear. The ingredients of phase C were mixed together using a Silverson High Shear Mixer. Phase B was added to phase A and stirred until dissolved. Phase C was then added to phase A. Phase D was then added and mixed using a Silverson High Shear Mixer.<br>
EXAMPLE6<br>
The anti-microbial efficacy of the formulation of Example 5 was assessed in the clinical setting.<br>
The acceptability of the formulation of Example 5 by health care workers (HCW) was investigated. In vitro and in vivo assessment of the formulation was undertaken in accordance with European standards currently used for assessing hygienic and surgical rubs and washes (prEN 12054 and prEN 12791).<br>
METHODS<br>
Health care -worker recruitment<br>
•   HCW were recruited from two acute neurosurgical wards, a radiology<br>
department and two intensive care units within the University Hospital<br>
Birmingham NHS trust, UK.<br>
Study design<br>
1)	Ethical committee approval was obtained from South Birmingham Ethics<br>
Research Council prior to commencement of the study.<br>
2)	Computerised randomisation of HCW into study and control groups was<br>
performed.<br>
3)	All HCW washed their hands with non-medicated soap and water for 30<br>
seconds and dried hands with sterile paper towels.<br>
4)	A 4cm area of palm of the dominant hand of each HCW was sampled with a<br>
swab moistened with 0.9% (w/v) sterile saline for baseline microbial counts.<br>
5)	The study group then applied 0.5 ml of the formulation to their hands as<br>
recommended by manufacturer. The control group did not apply the<br>
formulation.<br>
6)	After 1 minute a 4cm area from non-dominant hand was sampled as described<br>
previously.<br>
7)	HCW continued their work as normal. Other hand disinfectants, including<br>
alcohol hand rubs and chlorhexidine gluconate were not used during the study<br>
period. Any hand washes containing triclosan were removed from study areas<br>
one week prior to commencement of the study. However, during the study,<br>
HCW continued to wash their hands with non-medicated soap and water as per<br>
normal clinical practice.<br><br>
8)	After 1 hour and 3 hours further microbiological samples were taken from<br>
different areas of the palms of the dominant and non-dominant hand<br>
respectively as described previously.<br>
9)	Data on the number of times hands were washed with soap and the duration<br>
gloves were worn were collected with a standardised questionnaire.<br>
10)	HCW who had to use hand disinfection (alcohol/chlorhexidine) during the<br>
study due to clinical circumstance were not included in the evaluation<br>
11)	Acceptability of the formulation by HCW in the study group was investigated<br>
with a standardised questionnaire.<br>
Standardised questionnaires<br>
HCW completed a standardised questionnaire at 1 and 3 hrs to indicate the following:<br>
1.	Number of times gloves were worn<br>
2.	Total time gloves were worn<br>
3.	Number of times hands were washed with non-medicated soap and water<br>
In addition, HCW comprising the study group completed a further standardised questionnaire at 3 hrs which asked:<br>
1.	Did you experience any discomfort on your hands whilst wearing the<br>
formulation?<br>
2.	How did the formulation feel on your hands (good, acceptable, unacceptable)?<br>
3.	Did the presence of the formulation on your hands compromise manipulation<br>
technique?<br>
4.	Would you use the formulation as a part of your routine hand hygiene regime?<br>
5.	Overall comments?<br>
Quantitative microbial analysis<br>
•	Swabs taken at time 0,1 minute, 1 hour and 3 hours, were broken into 1 ml of<br>
neutralising Letheen broth (Merck, Germany) and vortexed for 30 seconds.<br>
Two x 0.5ml volumes of the sample were mixed thoroughly with 2 xlSml of<br>
cooled molten yeast extract agar (BioMerieux, UK) in a Petri dish. Culture<br>
plates were incubated at 37°C in air for 24 hours.<br>
•	Colony forming units (CPU) were determined and results expressed as mean<br>
CPU.<br>
•	The percentage reductions of mean CPU from the baseline bacterial counts<br>
were also determined.<br>
Statistical analysis<br>
•	Means were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test and p values of equal<br>
to, or less than 0.05 were considered significant.<br>
prEN 12054 andprEN 12791 (European standards for assessing Hygienic and Surgical hand rubs and washes)<br>
•	In vitro antibacterial efficacy of the formulation was assessed for anti<br>
microbial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Enterococcus<br>
hiraeATCC 10541, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442 and Escherichia<br>
coli NCTC 10536 in accordance with prEN 12054. In vivo anti-microbial<br>
activity of the formulation was compared with 60% (v/v) n-propane (gold<br>
standard) in accordance with prEN 1279. Twenty laboratory volunteers participated in the assessment of the formulation in accordance to prEN 12791.<br>
Reassessment of antimicrobial activity ofthe formulation after 4 months The formulation used for assessment of antimicrobial activity in accordance with prEN 12054 was allowed to stand at room temperature for 4-months. The antimicrobial efficacy of V was then reassessed in accordance with prEN 12054.<br>
RESULTS<br>
Health care -worker recruitment<br>
•	One hundred and two HCW were recruited into the study. Fifty two HCW<br>
were randomised into the study arm, and 50 in the control arm.<br>
•	The recruited HCW were nurses (65), auxiliaries (13), medical personnel (7),<br>
physio- or occupational therapists (9), radiographers (6) and porters (2).<br>
Quantitative and statistical analysis<br>
•	The mean CPU obtained from the hands of HCW in the study and control<br>
arms are given in Figure 1. There was no significant difference in baseline<br>
mean CFU counts (p= 0.054), However significant reductions in mean CPU<br>
counts in the study arm after 1 minute (pO.OOOl), 1 hour (pO.OOOl) and 3<br>
hours (p
Table 6. Percentage reduction in mean CFU on the hands of HCW in the control and study arms at 1 minute, 1 hour and 3 hours compared to baseline mean CFU counts.<br><br>
(Table 6 Removed)<br>
•	The number of times hands were washed and duration gloves were worn did<br>
not differ significantly between the study group and controls (Figures 2 and 3).<br>
(hand washing at 1 hour p=0.092 and 3 hours p=0.43; Wearing of gloves after<br>
1 hourp=0.47 and 3 hours p=0.13).<br>
Acceptability of the formulation by HCW<br>
•	None of the 52 HCW experienced any adverse reaction/skin irritation during<br>
the study period; 50 out of 52 (97%) reported that the formulation absorbed<br>
well into the hands and felt good/acceptable; all 52 HCW confirmed that the<br>
formulation did not compromise manipulation techniques; 49 out of 52 (94%)<br>
reported that they would use the formulation as a part of their daily hand<br>
hygiene regime. No adverse reactions to the formulation were reported during<br>
the study period.<br>
prEN12054<br>
•	The formulation demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against<br>
Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), Enterococcus hirae (ATCC 10541) and<br>
Escherichia coli (NCTC 10536) hi accordance with prEN 12054. The<br>
formulation demonstrated no antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas<br>
aeruginosa ATCC 15442 over the 10 min assessment period.<br>
prEN 12791<br>
There was a significantly higher mean reduction factor after 3 minutes (immediate) in the bacterial counts on the fingertips of 20 volunteers following application of 60% propanol compared with the formulation<br>
(p<o.oool there was no significant difference in the mean reduction factors of bacterial counts following hours></o.oool>
Reassessment of antimicrobial activity qf the formulation after 4 months<br>
•	There was no significant difference in the antibacterial activity of the<br>
formulation in accordance with prEN 12054 following 4-months standing at<br>
room temperature (p= 0.155).<br>
CONCLUSIONS<br>
•	The mean bacterial count on the palms of the hands of HCW is reduced<br>
following application of the formulation.<br>
•	The bacterial counts on the palms of the hands of HCW remained significantly<br>
lower than those on the palms of HCW who did not apply the formulation for<br>
up to 3-hours in the routine clinical situation.<br>
•	There was no significant difference between the number of times hands were<br>
washed and duration gloves were worn between study and control groups.<br>
These results suggest that hand washing and wearing of gloves did not<br>
significantly account for differences observed hi microbial loads on the hands<br>
of HCW who applied the formulation and those who did not. Furthermore, the<br>
results suggest that handwashing did not significantly reduce the activity of<br>
the formulation during the study period.<br><br>
•	the formulation was well accepted by HCW. the formulation absorbed well<br>
into the skin leaving it feeling well conditioned and did not compromise<br>
manipulation techniques in clinical practice. The majority of HCW reported<br>
that they would use the formulation as a part of their daily hand hygiene<br>
regime.<br>
•	In addition, several HCW who continued to use the formulation following the<br>
clinical evaluation reported improvements in the condition of their skin and a<br>
reduction in the presence of eczema and psoriasis (data not shown).<br>
•	the formulation demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against<br>
Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), Enterococcus hirae (ATCC 10541) and<br>
Escherichia coli (NCTC 10536) in accordance with prEN 12054. The<br>
formulation did not demonstrate antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442 and therefore did not conform to prEN 12054. Many strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are naturally resistant to many antimicrobials including triclosan and widespread, uncontrolled continued use of the formulation alone, may select for resistant strains in the clinical setting. Further in vitro testing of the formulation revealed that the preparation had rapid antimicrobial activity against microoraganisms not included in prEN 12054. Microorganisms included Propionibacterium acnes NCTC 797, Acinetobacter sp (wild strain) and Campylovbacter jejuni (wild strain). Assessment of the formulation in accordance with prEN 12791 demonstrated that alcoholic hand disinfection results in a significantly higher immediate reduction in the bacterial flora on the fingertips of HCW with no significant difference in counts over time (3-hours). the formulation did not therefore conform to prEN12791.<br>
There was no significant difference in antimicrobial activity of the formulation following repeat testing after standing at room temperature for 4-months. These results suggest that the formulation retains antibacterial activity for at least 4-months at room temperature.<br>
the formulation may be a beneficial adjunct to current hand hygiene practices / guidelines and may facilitate in reducing cross-infection. Further in view of the formulation demonstrating rapid bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus, the formulation finds use in the treatment and/or prevention and in particular the reduction of hospital acquired infections such as Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
A 48 hour irritancy test of three barrier formulations detailed in Table 7 was performed on health care workers.<br>
Table 7<br>
(Table 7 Removed)<br>
26 male and female volunteers were recruited from a test panel. The mean age of the 26 subjects was 46 years, range 23-62 years. All subjects were healthy volunteers who had been given a medical examination before joining the trail. All volunteers were within the age range 18-65 years, and were healthy with no significant concurrent illnesses.<br>
A number of exclusion criteria were used to select the volunteers for the study. These criteria are as follows:<br>
*	Pregnant or lactating females at the start of the study or females of reproductive<br>
age who did not agree to take contraceptive measures to avoid becoming pregnant<br>
during the study<br>
*	Subjects who had used any systemic or topical medication likely to interfere with<br>
the study<br>
*	Subjects who had used an experimental drug within 30 days or the study<br>
*	Subjects who had taken part in a study involving the test sites (skin of the lower<br>
back) within 8 weeks of the study<br>
*	Subjects with a history of, or evidence of alcohol or drug abuse.<br>
Ethical approval for the study was obtained. All subjects gave their consent before starting the study.<br>
O.lg of each of the formulations was applied to the lower part of the back between the lower coastal margin and the iliac crest, avoiding the area over the vertebral column using 12mm aluminium Finn chambers on Scanport® tape. The three test chambers were applied vertically in a single column of the chambers to one side of the back. Site number 1 was the upper test chamber and site number 3 was the lower test chamber.<br>
The test materials were in continuous contact with the skin over a 48 hour period. After this period the test chambers were removed and the sites assessed using the following schedule:<br>
(Table  Removed)<br>
The test sites were assessed visually for erythema at 24 and 48 hours, using a 0-6 ranking scale as follows:<br>
Erythema<br>
0	= no reaction<br>
0.5 = slight, patchy erythema<br>
1	= slight uniform erythema<br>
2	= moderate, uniform erythema<br>
3	- strong erythema<br>
4	= strong erythema, spreading outside patch<br>
5	= strong erythema, spreading outside patch with either swelling or vesiculation<br>
6	= severe reaction with erosion<br>
If in addition to erythema other clinical signs of cutaneous irritation are observed the following letters were appended to the numerical score as follows:<br>
OE-Oedema<br>
V = Vesiculation<br>
S = Scaling<br>
C = Cracking or crazing<br>
SC = Scabbing<br>
P = Papules<br>
SO = Reaction spreading outside area of application<br>
G - Glazing<br>
BS = Burning or Stinging reported by volunteer<br>
The skin tolerance was detennined by the number of grade 2 or greater skin reactions recorded. The following classification was used:<br><br>
(Table  Removed)<br>
The results of the study are provided below in Tables 8 to 10.<br>

Summary of Results<br>
Results are expressed as the number of subjects reacting with a grade 1 or grade<br>
greater than 2 erythema<br><br>
(Table 10 Removed)<br>
The results therefore indicate that the formulation containing 2% Triclosan was tolerated well by most but not all subjects under the test conditions. The formulations containing 1% Chlorhexidine or 1% Tea Tree Oil were both well tolerated.<br>
EXAMPLE8<br>
A further study investigated the effects of a barrier formulation of the invention containing 0.5% Triclosan against bacteria generally found on farms, and the safety of the formulation in relation to milk quality. In particular the study was intended to determine whether when the formulation is applied to the hands of the milker and the teats of cows after milking, there is any effect on the incidence of mastitis hi lactating dairy cows.<br>
In the study the effect of the formulation on cow teat sores was also investigated. Teat sores can be caused by Pseudocowpox or Bovine Herpes 2 viral infections. Spread of infections can be a problem with regard to viral infections.<br>
The formulation was applied to teat sores. The sores showed a more rapid recovery than previously expected. The study found that using the formulation on teats led to the teats becoming softer and more supple. In addition the spread of infection (both mastitis and teat lesions (warts and sores/ulcers)) between cows was reduced.<br>
Contagious mastitis (Staphlococcus aureus) showed a marked downturn in the study. Staphlococcus aureus spreads via contact with milkers' hands and milking clusters. Cows identified as carriers were treated with antibiotics and had their teats wiped with the formulation pre and post milking. The study reported a reduction in overall somatic cell count (a rise in somatic cell count is often an indicator of sub-clinical infection with Staph aureus) and individual somatic cell count levels which may indicate that the formulation is helping to prevent the spread of Staphlococcus aureus.<br>
hi addition bacterial isolates from swabs of teats treated with the formulation, and milkers' hands, were found to be negative. This is therefore an indicator of the bactericidal activity of the formulation.<br>
Further the use of the formulation on open wounds had remarkable results where conventional antibiotic preparations had failed.<br>
Milkers who used the formulation on their hands regularly, for example before every milking - on hands and also on latex gloves, after morning/lunch breaks, and before any AI procedures, reported that the formulation reduced "pick up" of dirt and odour from the farm. In addition they reported that then* hands were washed clean more easily than previously. Further the milkers indicated that their skin became more supple and softer to touch with a reduction in cracked skin and "ground in" dirt. Infections of cuts and scratches were also reported by milkers to be reduced.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
