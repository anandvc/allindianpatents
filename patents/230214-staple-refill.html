				<td>STAPLE REFILL<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a staple refill in<br>
which a sheet-like connected staple wound in a roll shape<br>
is stored.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
For example, as disclosed in Japanese patent<br>
Application Laid-Open No. H9-136271 (Patent Reference 1),<br>
the conventional staple refill in which the sheet-like<br>
connected staple wound in a roll shape is stored has a<br>
refill which is detachably attached to a stapler main body<br>
or a cartridge provided in the stapler main body. The<br>
refill includes a storage portion in which the sheet-like<br>
connected staple is stored, a discharge port which<br>
discharges the sheet-like connected staple stored in the<br>
storage portion, and a delivery passage which delivers a<br>
leading end portion of the sheet-like connected staple<br>
stored in the storage portion to the discharge port. The<br>
delivery passage is formed in a substantially linear shape,<br>
and is formed along a lower surface in the storage portion.<br>
A metal backward movement preventing member which is formed<br>
independently of the refill is attached to an upper portion<br>
of the delivery passage. In the sheet-like connected<br>
staple, many linear staples are arrange in a crosswise<br>
direction while being in contact with one another, and a<br><br>
bonding agent is applied to an upper surface to couple the<br>
staples in a band shape. Further, the sheet-like connected<br>
staple are caused to adhere in the center of the upper<br>
surfaces in the lengthwise direction by an adhesive tape,<br>
which prevents the linear staple from being separated. The<br>
sheet-like connected staple is wound in a roll shape while<br>
the upper surface faces the outside, and the sheet-like<br>
connected staple is stored in the staple refill.<br>
In the conventional staple refill in which the sheet-<br>
like connected staple wound in a roll shape is stored, the<br>
sheet-like connected staple is stored in the storage<br>
portion of the refill such that a leading end portion of<br>
the sheet-like connected staple is located in a lower<br>
portion of the storage portion, and the leading end portion<br>
of the sheet-like connected staple is linearly stretched<br>
along the lower surface of the storage portion and the<br>
delivery passage. When the leading end portion of the<br>
sheet-like connected staple is delivered from the discharge<br>
port by feeding means such as a feeding pawl or a feeding<br>
roller provided in the stapler main body or the like, the<br>
whole sheet-like connected staple is placed on a drawn-<br>
forth portion which is linearly drawn. Therefore, there is<br>
a problem that a weight of the sheet-like connected staple<br>
is applied to the feeding means as a load. In drawing<br>
forth the sheet-like connected staple, because the whole<br>
sheet-like connected staple is moved forward, the sheet-<br>
like connected staple abuts on an' inner surface of the<br><br>
storage portion, and the larger-than designed load is<br>
applied to the feeding means due to friction action, which<br>
results in the problem that it is difficult for the feeding<br>
means to feed the leading end portion of the sheet-like<br>
connected staple.<br>
In the conventional staple refill, the backward<br>
movement preventing member slides on the drawn-forth<br>
portion which is linearly drawn. When the sheet-like<br>
connected staple is drawn forth on the discharge port side,<br>
the backward movement preventing member is bent in the<br>
discharge port, and the drawing-forth of the sheet-like<br>
connected staple is not obstructed. On the contrary, when<br>
the sheet-like connected staple is drawn back toward the<br>
storage portion side, the backward movement preventing<br>
member is latched in a connecting recess portion between<br>
the staples of the sheet-like connected staple, which<br>
prevents the drawing-back of the sheet-like connected<br>
staple. Thus, the backward movement preventing member<br>
always slides on the sheet-like connected staple. However,<br>
when contact pressure is excessively strong in the slide,<br>
the load applied onto the feeding means for feeding the<br>
sheet-like connected staple is increased. On the other<br>
hand, when the contact; pressure is excessively weak in the<br>
slide, drawing-back resistance of the sheet-like connected<br>
staple is decreased. Therefore, there is the problem that<br>
the backward movement; preventing member is difficult to<br>
adjust.<br><br>
The feeding means is pressed to latch the lower<br>
surface of the sheet-like connected staple, and the sheet-<br>
like connected staple is fed forward. As described above,<br>
the bonding agent is applied to the upper surface and the<br>
adhesive tape adheres to the center of the upper surface<br>
toward the lengthwise direction. In the conventional<br>
staple refill, the backward movement preventing member<br>
slides on the upper surface of the sheet-like connected<br>
staple to which the bonding agent is applied. Therefore,<br>
the backward movement preventing member does not behave<br>
well in some cases because the backward movement preventing<br>
member slips. Further, the backward movement preventing<br>
members slide on both sides of the sheet-like connected<br>
staple across the adhesive tape, and there is a possibility<br>
that the sheet-like connected staple is bent when one of<br>
the backward movement preventing members does not behave<br>
well. There is also the problem that both the backward<br>
movement preventing members are difficult to adjust so as<br>
to behave well in the same manner. Further, because the<br>
backward movement preventing member is produced<br>
independently of the refill, the a labor hour is required<br>
to attach the backward movement preventing member to the<br>
refill, and the adjustment is required in the attachment of<br>
the backward movement preventing member as described above.<br>
Therefore, there is the problem that the backward movement<br>
preventing member cannot easily be installed in the refill.<br>
In the conventional staple refill, because the backward<br><br>
movement preventing member made of a metal material is<br>
installed, it is necessary to separate the backward<br>
movement preventing member into each material in disposal,<br>
which results in the problem that the disposal of the<br>
backward movement preventing member becomes troublesome.<br>
In the conventional staple refill, when the sheet-<br>
like connected staple wound in a roll shape is stored in<br>
the storage portion of the refill, the whole outer surface<br>
of the sheet-like connected staple is stored while being in<br>
contact with a bottom surface of the storage portion. When<br>
the sheet-like connected staple is drawn toward the<br>
discharge port side, because the whole outer surface of the<br>
sheet-like connected staple is rotated while sliding on the<br>
bottom surface of the storage portion, the frictional<br>
resistance is increased, which results in the problem that<br>
the load applied onto the feeding means for feeding the<br>
sheet-like connected staple becomes large.<br>
In the conventional staple refill, the sheet-like<br>
connected staple wound in a roll shape is stored in the<br>
storage portion of the refill, and the sheet-like connected<br>
staple is oscillated in the storage portion during<br>
transportation, which results in the possibility that the<br>
sheet-like connected staple wound in a roll shape is<br>
released. Further, in the opaque refill, the inside of the<br>
refill cannot be seen, which results in the problem that a<br>
state of the sheet-like connected staple and a remaining<br>
amount of sheet-like connected staple cannot be confirmed.<br><br>
In view of the foregoing, a first object of the<br>
invention is to provide a staple refill, in which the<br>
sheet-like connected staple wound in a roll shape can be<br>
stored in the storage portion of the staple refill while<br>
the leading end portion of the sheet-like connected staple<br>
is located in the upper portion of the storage portion and<br>
the load applied onto the feeding means of the stapler main<br>
body can be decreased because the sheet-like connected<br>
staple is not placed on the drawn-forth portion which is<br>
drawn and fed. A second object of the invention is to<br>
provide a staple refill, in which the delivery passage is<br>
curved upward from the discharge port toward the inside of<br>
the storage portion, the backward movement preventing<br>
member is formed in the delivery passage, the backward<br>
movement preventing member is inclined downward to weaken<br>
the latching force when the sheet-like connected staple is<br>
fed, and the backward movement preventing member is<br>
inclined upward to strengthen the latching force when the<br>
sheet-like connected staple is drawn back, and thereby the<br>
adjustment of the backward movement preventing member is<br>
not required.<br>
A third object of the invention is to provide a<br>
staple refill, in which the backward movement preventing<br>
member slides not on the upper surface of the sheet-like<br>
connected staple where the bonding agent is applied and the<br>
adhesive tape adheres, but on the lower surface of the<br>
sheet-like connected staple with which the feeding means of<br><br>
the stapler main body is made in contact, the sheet-like<br>
connected staple can securely be latched, the backward<br>
movement preventing member car. slide in the center of the<br>
sheet-like connected staple, and thereby the possibility<br>
that the sheet-like connected staple is fed while being<br>
bent is eliminated. A Eourth object of the invention is to<br>
provide a staple refill, in which because the backward<br>
movement preventing member is integrated with the staple<br>
refill, the labor hour for attaching the backward movement<br>
preventing member to the staple refill is eliminated, and<br>
the staple refill can easily be assembled.<br>
A fifth object of the invention is to provide a<br>
staple refill, in which a projection strip slidinq on the<br>
outer surface of the sheet-like connected staple wound in a<br>
roll shape is provided in the storage portion of the staple<br>
refill, a contact area with the outer surface of the sheet-<br>
like connected staple is lessened to decrease the<br>
frictional resistance, and thereby the rotation of the<br>
sheet-like connected staple can be smoothed. A sixth<br>
object of the invention is to provide a staple refill in<br>
which there is formed an opening that can be utilized in<br>
order to press the sheet-like connected staple stored in<br>
the storage portion of the staple refill so as not to move<br>
and that allows for confirmation of the inside the storage<br>
portion.<br>

of the upper wall 6.<br>
The upper wall 6 includes an upper semi-cylindrical<br>
wall 11, a vertical wall 12 whose upper end is coupled to a<br>
front end of the upper semi-cylindrical wall 11, a curved<br>
wall 13 whose one end is coupled to a lower end of the<br>
vertical wall 12, and a horizontal wall 15 whose rear end<br>
is coupled to the other end of the curved wall 13. The<br>
left wall 7 and the right wall 9 include circular walls 7a<br>
and 9a and lower walls 7b and 9b respectively. The lower<br>
walls 7b and 9b, which extend substantially in a horizontal<br><br>
direction, are coupled to lower ends of the circular walls<br>
7a and 9a respectively. The lower walls 7b and 9b are<br>
projected downward from the horizontal wall 15. Latch<br>
holes 14 and 14 are formed in the lower walls 7b and 9b.<br>
A grip arm 18 extending backward is formed in the<br>
upper portion of the upper semi-cylindrical wall 11. A rib<br>
19 reinforcing the curved wall 13 is formed in the upper<br>
surface of the curved wall 13. The opening 8 is formed in<br>
the rear portion of the upper semi-cylindrical wall 11.<br>
Further, the guide projection strip 20 guiding the sheet-<br>
like connected staple S is provided in the inner surface of<br>
the upper wall 6 of the upper case 3, i.e., in the inner<br>
surfaces of the upper semi-cylindrical wall 11, the<br>
vertical wall 12, the curved wall 13, and the horizontal<br>
wall 15.<br>
As shown in Figs. 3 a.nd 4, similarly to the upper<br>
case 3, the lower case 5 is integrally formed by a<br>
synthetic resin, and includes a lower wall 21. The lower<br>
wall 21 includes an arc wall 22 and a linear wall 23. The<br>
arc wall 22 is formed in a quarter arc shape, and the rear<br>
end of the linear wall 23 is coupled to the front end of<br>
the arc wall 22. The mound-shaped guide projection 25 is<br>
formed in the linear wall 23. One surface 26 (on the side<br>
of the discharge port 4 6) of the guide projection (guide<br>
projection portion) 25 is curved such that a substantially<br>
constant gap is formed with a lower surface 13a of the<br>
curved wall 13 of the upper case 3. The other surface 27<br><br>
(on the side of the storage portion 40) of the guide<br>
projection 25 is curved such that an arc is formed like the<br>
arc wall 22. A top portion 29 of the guide projection 25<br>
is formed in a semi-circular shape.<br>
A notch portion 30 is formed in a substantially<br>
intermediate portion of the guide projection 25. The pawl-<br>
shaped backward movement preventing member 31 is integrally<br>
provided in the linear wall 23. The backward movement<br>
preventing member 31 is located in the notch portion 30,<br>
and is projected from the curved one surface 26. In the<br>
linear wall 23, a substantially U-shaped notch recessed<br>
portion 32 is formed in the front portion, and the rear<br>
portion extends beyond the arc wall 22. The guide band<br>
(projection strip) 35 guiding the sheet-like connected<br>
staple S is projected in the inner surface of the lower<br>
wall 21 of the lower case 5, i.e., in the inner surfaces of<br>
the arc wall 22, the guide projection 25, and the linear<br>
wall 23. Latch pawls 3 6 and 36 are formed on both sides of<br>
the lower wall 21, and the latch pawls 36 and 36 are<br>
detachably latched in latch holes 14 and 14 of the upper<br>
case 3.<br>
In the staple refill 1, when the lower case 5 is<br>
fitted between the lower wall 7b of the left wall 7 and the<br>
lower wall 9b of the right wall 9 of the upper case 3, the<br>
latch pawls 36 and 36 of the lower case 5 is latched in the<br>
latch holes 14 and 14 of the upper case 3 to assemble the<br>
refill 2. In the assembly, as shown in Fig. 3, the sheet-<br><br>
like connected staple S is placed in the lower case 5, when<br>
the sheet-like connected staple S is stored in the upper<br>
case 3 such that the leading end portion S1 of the sheet-<br>
like connected staple S wound counterclockwise is located<br>
in the upper portion of the upper case 3.<br>
In the refill 2, the cylindrical storage chamber 4 0<br>
is formed by the upper semi-cylindrical wall 11 and<br>
vertical wall 12 of the upper wall 6, the arc wall 22 and<br>
the other surface (on the side of the storage portion 40)<br>
27 of the guide projection (guide projection portion) 25 of<br>
the lower case 5, and the left wall 7 and right wall 9.<br>
The sheet-like connected staple S is positioned on the<br>
lowest linear wall 23 by the arc wall 22 of the lower case<br>
5 and the other surface 27 of the guide projection 25.<br>
In the refill 2, the second guide passage 42 curved<br>
smoothly upward is formed by the lower surface 13a of the<br>
curved wall 13 of the upper case 3, one surface (on the<br>
side of the discharge port 46) 26 of the guide projection<br>
25 of the lower case 5, the left wall 7 and right wall 9.<br>
The second guide passage 42 is upwardly curved toward the<br>
side of the storage portion 40, and is communicated with<br>
the storage portion 40. In the refill 2, the substantially<br>
linear first guide passage 43 is formed by a lower surface<br>
15a of the horizontal wall 15 of the upper case 3, an upper<br>
surface 23a of the linear wall 23 of the lower case 5, the<br>
left wall 7 and right wall 9. That is, the delivery<br>
passage 45 is formed by the first guide passage 43 and the<br><br>
second guide passage 42. The discharge port 46 is formed<br>
at the front end of the delivery passage 45, and the sheet-<br>
like connected staple S is sequentially discharged from the<br>
leading end portion S1.<br>
The delivery passage 45 includes the upper guide<br>
surface 47 guiding the upper surface S2 of the sheet-like<br>
connected staple S and the lower guide surface 48 guiding<br>
the lower surface S3 of the sheet-like connected staple S.<br>
The upper guide surface 47 is formed by the lower surface<br>
15a of the horizontal wall 15 of the upper case 3 and the<br>
lower surface 13a of the curved wall 13 of the upper case<br>
3. The lower guide surface 48 is formed by the upper<br>
surface 23a of the linear wall 23 of the lower case 5 and<br>
one surface (on the side of the discharge port 46) 26 of<br>
the guide projection 2 5. On the upper guide surface 47 of<br>
the delivery passage 45, the two guide projection strips 20<br>
are provided along a moving direction of the sheet-like<br>
connected staple S. The guide projection strip 20 is a<br>
strip-shaped projection portion which is slightly projected<br>
from the upper guide surface 47 toward the side of the<br>
sheet-like connected staple S. The guide projection strip<br>
20 decreases a contact area between the upper guide surface<br>
47 and the sheet-like connected staple S to decrease slide<br>
resistance in moving the sheet-like connected staple S, and<br>
thereby the sheet-like connected staple S is smoothly drawn<br>
forth. The notch recessed portion 32 is provided at a<br>
position facing the horizontal wall 15 of the upper guide<br><br>
surface 47 of the lower guide surface 48. The notch<br>
recessed portion 32 is a portion which brings a feeding<br>
pawl (feeding roller) of the stapler main body 50 into<br>
contact with the lower surface S3 of the sheet-like<br>
connected staple S. The sheet-like connected staple S is<br>
drawn from the storage portion 40 by the notch recessed<br>
portion 32, and is delivered to the discharge port 46.<br>
The backward movement preventing member 31 is<br>
projected toward the inside of the second guide passage 42,<br>
and a leading edge 31a extends to a neighborhood of the<br>
lower surface 13a of the curved wall 13. The backward<br>
movement preventing member 31 can be bent due to elasticity<br>
of the synthetic resin material. The leading edge 31a of<br>
the backward movement preventing member 31 slides on the<br>
lower surface S3 of the sheet-like connected staple S to<br>
latch the connecting recess portion between the staples of<br>
the sheet-like connected staple S, which prevents the<br>
backward movement of the sheet-like connected staple S<br>
towards the side of the storage portion 40. The shape of<br>
the backward movement preventing member 31 is not<br>
particularly limited. For example, the backward movement<br>
preventing member 31 can obliquely be provided as shown in<br>
Fig. 6A, the backward movement preventing member 31 can be<br>
provided in a substantially L-shape as shown in Fig. 6B,<br>
and the backward movement preventing member 31 can be<br>
provided in a substantially n--shape as shown in Fig. 6C.<br>
As described above, the backwaxd movement preventing member<br><br>
31 is formed in a pawl shape, and the leading edge 31a<br>
strongly presses the sheet-like connected staple S<br>
(particularly drawn-forth portion S5) against the side of<br>
the lower surface 12a of the curved wall 13 during<br>
transportation. Therefore, there is no possibility that<br>
the sheet-like connected staple S is drawn from the staple<br>
refill 1 due to the excessive shock or the like. In the<br>
case where the staple refill 1 is set, the portion<br>
projected from the lower wall 21 is returned into the<br>
refill, which rotates the backward movement preventing<br>
member 31 counterclockwise. The rotation of the sheet-like<br>
connected staple S slightly retreats the leading edge 31a<br>
of the backward movement preventing member 31 from the<br>
lower surface 13a of the curved wall 13 to decrease the<br>
pressing force to the sheet-like connected staple S.<br>
Therefore, moving resistance of the sheet-like connected<br>
staple S toward the feeding direction is decreased to<br>
perform the staple feeding more smoothly.<br>
A leading tape (not shown) provided in the leading<br>
end portion S1 of the sheet-like connected staple S is<br>
drawn from the discharge port 46. When the leading tape is<br>
pulled, the sheet-like connected staple S provided in the<br>
storage chamber 40 of the staple refill 1 is rotated and<br>
the leading edge of the leading tape is located at the<br>
discharge port 46. The staple refill 1 is attached to the<br>
cartridge 51 which is detachably mounted to the stapler<br>
main body 50, and the cartridge 51 is mounted to the<br><br>
stapler main body 50. When . the stapler main body 50 is<br>
driven, the leading end portion S1 of the sheet-like<br>
connected staple S is intermittently drawn toward the<br>
driver side by feeding means (for example, feeding pawl and<br>
feeding roller). A roll winding portion S4 of the sheet-<br>
like connected staple S is not placed on a drawn-forth<br>
portion S5, which decreases a load on the feeding means.<br>
The whole outer surfaces of the roll winding portion S4 of<br>
the sheet-like connected staple S do not come into contact<br>
with the inner surface of the storage chamber (storage<br>
portion) 40, but a part of the roll winding portion S4<br>
comes into contact with the guide projection strip 20<br>
and/or the guide band (projection strip) 35, so that the<br>
contact area is small. Therefore, frictional resistance is<br>
decreased, which further decreases the load on the feeding<br>
means.<br>
When the leading end portion S1 of the sheet-like<br>
connected staple S is drawn by the feeding means of the<br>
stapler main body 50, as shown, in Fig. 8A, the drawn-forth<br>
portion S5 is brought into close contact with the upper<br>
guide surface (the lower surface 13a of the curved wall 13)<br>
of the delivery passage 45, and the leading edge 31a of the<br>
backward movement preventing member 31 slides slightly on<br>
the drawn-forth portion S5 of the sheet-like connected<br>
staple S. Therefore, the sheet-like connected staple S can<br>
securely be delivered while little load is applied onto the<br>
feeding means. When the leading end portion S1 of the<br><br>
sheet-like connected staple S is returned by a weight of<br>
the roll winding portion S4 in the storage portion 40, as<br>
shown in Fig. 8B, the drawn-forth portion S5 comes into<br>
close contact with one surface 26 of the guide projection<br>
25,	and the leading edge 31a,, projected from one surface<br>
26,	of the backward movement preventing member 31 securely<br>
latches the sheet-like connected staple S.<br>
In the staple refill 1, the roll winding portion S4<br>
is decreased as the sheet-like connected staple S is drawn.<br>
As shown in Fig. 8C, the sheet-like connected staple S is<br>
delivered to the delivery passage 4 5 after the drawn-forth<br>
portion S5 of the sheet-like connected staple S is lifted<br>
by the top portion 29 of the guide projection 25, so that<br>
the staple refill 1 also functions as described above. The<br>
top portion 29 of the guide projection 25 is formed in a<br>
semi-circular shape, so that the guide projection 25 can<br>
smoothly guide the sheet-like connected staple S.<br>
Thus, the staple refill 1 can store the sheet-like<br>
connected staple S wound in a roll shape in the storage<br>
portion 40 of the refill 2 while the leading end portion S1<br>
is placed in the upper portion of the storage portion 40,<br>
and the roll winding portion S4 is not placed on the drawn-<br>
forth portion S5 when the sheet-like connected staple S is<br>
delivered from the discharge port 46. Therefore, the load<br>
applied onto the feeding means is decreased.<br>
In the conventional staple refill, a backward<br>
movement preventing member slides on a linearly extended<br><br>
portion of the sheet-like connected staple, and it is<br>
difficult to adjust contact pressure of the backward<br>
movement preventing memoer in the slide. On the contrary,<br>
in the staple refill 1, s1nce the curved delivery passage<br>
45 is utilized as described above, the drawing-forth of the<br>
sheet-like connected staple differs from the drawing-back<br>
of the sheet-like connected staple in the latching force of<br>
the backward movement preventing member 31, and the<br>
latching force of the backward movement preventing member<br>
31 is increased in drawing back the sheet-like connected<br>
staple rather than in drawing forth the sheet-like<br>
connected staple. Therefore, it is not necessary to adjust<br>
the contact pressure of the backward movement preventing<br>
member 31.<br>
In the staple refill 1, s1milarly to the feeding<br>
means of the stapler main body 50, the backward movement<br>
preventing member 31 is pressed to latch the lower surface<br>
S3 of the sheet-like connected staple S, where a bonding<br>
agent is not applied and a bonding tape does not adhere in<br>
a lengthwise direction. Therefore, the backward movement<br>
of the sheet-like connected staple S can securely be<br>
prevented, and the backward movement preventing member 31<br>
can be arranged substantially in the center of the lower<br>
surface S3, so that the sheet-like connected staple S can<br>
be latched in a well-balanced manner.<br>
In the staple refill 1, s1nce the backward movement<br>
preventing member 31 is integrally formed, it is not<br><br>
necessary to install the backward movement preventing<br>
member made of a metal material in the refill unlike the<br>
conventional staple refill. Therefore, the assembly of the<br>
staple refill 1 can eas1ly be performed, and weight<br>
reduction and cost reduction of the refill 2 can be<br>
achieved. Further, disposal of the staple refill 1 is easy<br>
to perform because it is not necessary to separate the<br>
staple refill 1 into each material.<br>
In the refill 2, s1nce the opening 8 is formed in the<br>
rear portion of the upper semi-cylindrical wall 11 as<br>
described above, the sheet-like connected staple S stored<br>
in the storage chamber 10 can be fixed so as not to move<br>
during the transportation by mounting a press1ng member<br>
such as a cushion material from the opening 8 in packaging<br>
the staple refill 1, which allows the leading edge pos1tion<br>
of the sheet-like connected staple S not to be shifted. In<br>
the usage of the staple refill 1, a state such as a<br>
remaining amount of sheet-like connected staple S can also<br>
be confirmed by utilizing the opening 8.<br>
In the staple refill 1, the backward movement<br>
preventing member 31 is integrated with the lower wall 21<br>
of the lower case 5. Alternatively, as shown in Figs. 9<br>
and 10, substantially L-shaped engaging projections 53 and<br>
53 are formed on both s1des of a plate-shaped lower wall 52<br>
of a lower case 57, and both ends of an insertion plate 56<br>
including backward movement preventing members 55, which<br>
are formed substantially in an inverse U-shape and<br><br><br>
separately formed by a synthetic res1n, are engaged to the<br>
engaging projections 53 and 53, and the backward movement<br>
preventing member 55 may be provided in the lower wall 52<br>
of the lower case 57. The backward movement preventing<br>
members 55, which are formed substantially in an inverse U-<br>
shape, are projected from long holes 60 formed in one<br>
curved surface 59 of a substantially mound-shaped guide<br>
projection 58, and the backward movement preventing members<br>
55 press the sheet-like connected staple S.<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
In the staple refill according to the invention, the<br>
leading end portion of the sheet-like connected staple<br>
wound in a roll shape can be stored in the storage portion<br>
of the refill while the leading end portion is placed in<br>
the upper portion of the storage portion, and the sheet-<br>
like connected staple is not placed on the drawn-forth<br>
portion when the sheet-like connected staple is drawn to be<br>
delivered. Therefore, the staple refill of the invention<br>
has the effect that the load applied onto the feeding means<br>
is decreased. Further, in the staple refill according to<br>
the invention, the delivery passage is curved upward from<br>
the discharge port toward the ins1de of the storage<br>
portion, and the backward movement preventing member is<br>
provided in the curved delivery passage. Therefore, the<br>
latching force can be weakened in drawing forth the sheet-<br>
like connected staple, and the latching force can be<br>
strengthened in drawing back the sheet-like connected<br><br>
staple, so that the staple refill of the invention has the<br>
effect that the adjustment of the backward movement<br>
preventing member is no: required.<br>
In the staple refill according to the invention, the<br>
backward movement preventing member slides not on the upper<br>
surface where the bonding agent is applied and the bonding<br>
tape adheres, but on the lower surface of the sheet-like<br>
connected staple on the same s1de as the feeding means.<br>
Therefore, the backward movement preventing member is<br>
difficult to slide, so that the staple refill of the<br>
invention has the effect that the sheet-like connected<br>
staple can securely be latched. Further, s1nce the<br>
backward movement preventing member can slide in the center<br>
of the lower surface of the sheet-like connected staple, so<br>
that the backward movement preventing member can be latched<br>
in a well-balanced mariner in the sheet-like connected<br>
staple. Therefore, the staple refill of the invention has<br>
the effect that the poss1bility of the bending of the<br>
sheet-like connected staple can extremely be decreased.<br>
Furthermore, in the staple refill according to the<br>
invention, s1nce the backward movement preventing member is<br>
integrated with the refill, it is not necessary to install<br>
the backward movement preventing member in the refill, so<br>
that the staple refill of the invention has the effect that<br>
the assembly of the staple refill can eas1ly be performed.<br>
In the staple refill acccurding to the invention, the<br>
projection strip sliding on the outer surface of the sheet-<br><br>
like connected staple wound in a roll shape is provided in<br>
the inner surface of the storage portion, and the whole<br>
outer surfaces of the sheet-like connected staple do not<br>
come into contact with the bottom surface of the storage<br>
portion, but a part of the outer surface comes into contact<br>
with the bottom surface, so that the contact area is small.<br>
Therefore, the staple refill of the invention has the<br>
effect that the sheet-lice connected staple can smoothly be<br>
rotated.<br>
In the staple refill according to the invention, the<br>
opening communicated with the storage portion is formed in<br>
the refill, so that the staple refill of the invention has<br>
the effects that the press1ng member such as the cushion<br>
material can be mounted by utilizing the opening in<br>
packaging the staple refill such that the sheet-like<br>
connected staple stored in the storage portion does not<br>
move during the transportation, the leading edge pos1tion<br>
of the sheet-like connected staple cannot be shifted, and a<br>
state such as a remaining amount of sheet-like connected<br>
staple can be confirmed by utilizing the opening.<br>
