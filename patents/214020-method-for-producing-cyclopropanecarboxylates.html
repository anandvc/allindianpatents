The present invention relates to a method for producing cyclopropanecarboxylates.<br><br>
As a method for producing cyclopropanecarboxylic acid ester, there has been disclosed a transesterification method in which cyclopropanecarboxylic acid ester compounds having various alcohol residues have been produced by using sodium alkoxide or Ti alkoxide as a catalyst from a cyclopropanecarboxylic acid ester having a lower alcohol residue and a desired alcohol (GB Patent 15582/76, DE Patent 2822472, GB Patent 2005269).<br>
However, said sodium alkoxide catalyst has problems in that it affects stereochemistry such as cis-trans ratio of the resulting ester compounds, and these methods are not always satisfactory for industrial production due to a large amount of by-products formed during the reaction.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing desired cyclopropanecarboxylic acid<br><br>
esters by transesterification with a corresponding monohydroxy compound in good yield.<br>
The present invention provides: a method for producing cyclopropanecarboxylate of the formula (3):<br><br>
wherein R1 R2 R3 R4 and R5 each independently represent: a hydrogen atom, halogen atom, an optionally substituted alkyl group, an optionally substituted alkenyl group, an optionally substituted aralkyl group or an optionally substituted aryl group; and R^ represents:<br>
an optionally substituted alkyl group, an optionally substituted aralkyl group, or an optionally substituted aryl group, which comprises: reacting a cyclopropanecarboxylate of the formula (1)<br><br><br>
R6 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms or an optionally substituted phenyl group, with a monohydroxy compound of the formula (2):<br>
R7OH	(2)<br>
wherein R7 is the same as defined above, in the presence of a lanthanoid metal alkoxide.<br>
Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
In the present invention at least one lanthanoid metal alkoxide selected from alkoxide compounds of La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu can be used. Lanthanum alkoxide or Samarium alkoxide, which is industrially readily available, is preferably used.<br>
The lanthanoid metal alkoxide of the present invention include multimers in addition to monomers depending on the kind of metal species and alkyl groups, and these multimers can also be used in the present invention.<br>
Examples of the lanthanoid metal alkoxide include a compound of the formula (4):<br>
Ln(OR8) (GR9) (0R10)	(4)<br>
wherein, Ln represents a lanthanoid metal element, R8 R9 and R10 are the same or different and independently represent an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms.<br>
The alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms for R%<br><br>
R9 and R10 may independently represent a straight, branched or cyclic alkyl group, and may bond together at their terminals to form a divalent or trivalent alkoxide residue.<br>
Examples thereof include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-octyl, n-nonyl, n-decyl, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and the like.<br>
As the alkoxide group, methoxide, ethoxide, n-propoxide, i-propoxide, butoxide and the like are preferred since preparation thereof is easy. n-Propoxide, i-propoxide and butoxide are more preferred because of solubility, and i-propoxide is most preferred because of preparation cost, advantageous production operation, and the like.<br>
These lanthanoid metal alkoxide can be obtained by known preparation methods.<br>
The monohydroxy compound (2) can be allowed to react with the above-described lanthanoid metal alkoxide and then the resulting can be used in reacting the cyclopropanecarboxylate of the formula (1) with the monohydroxy compound (2).<br>
An amount of a lanthanoid metal alkoxide is not particularly restricted but may be catalytic, and is usually in the range of 0.001 to 200 mol %, preferably 0.1 to 10 mol % based on cyclopropanecarboxylate (1).<br><br>

Unreacted monohydroxy compound (2) can be recovered by, for example, an operation such as distillation and the like after termination of the reaction.<br>
The reaction of cyclopropanecarboxylate (1) with a monohydroxy compound ( 2 ) in the presence of a lanthanoid metal alkoxide is usually carried out under an inert gas atmosphere such as argon, nitrogen and the like.<br>
The reaction may be carried out at atomospheric pressure, increased pressure or reduced pressure, preferably at atmospheric pressure or reduced pressure.<br>
The reaction is preferably conducted while removing<br><br>
an alcohol derived from cyclopropanecarboxylate (1) out of the reaction system continuously by a method such as distillation and the like when the resulting alcohol has a lower boiling point.<br>
The reaction can be carried out without solvent or in an inert solvent, and examples of the solvent include halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane and the like, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, octane, nonane and the like, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene and the like, ether solvents such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, and the like.<br>
An alcohol derived from cyclopropanecarboxylate (1) may be continuously removed by adding a solvent that forms an azeotrope with the alcohol.<br>
The reaction temperature is not particularly<br>
restricted, and is usually in the range of 20 to 200°C.<br>
The alkoxide of the lanthanoid metal can be removed<br>
from cyclopropanecarboxylates (3) produced, for example, by<br>
extraction, washing with water or acidic water, and the like,<br>
and the desired product can be readily separated from the<br>
reaction mixture by a conventional operation such as<br>
evaporation, and may be further purified by distillation and<br>
the like, if necessary.<br><br>
The present invention can provide cyclopropanecarboxylates (3) readily in good yield, and it is advantageous as an industrial production method thereof.<br>
