				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 2- aryl propionic acid . Particularly this invention relates to the improved process for conversion of aryl olefins having the general formula 1 of the drawing accompanying this specification wherein R1 may be aryl, substituted aryl, napthyl or substituted napthyl, R2,R3, R4 and R5 may independently be hydrogen , alkyl aryl, arylalkyl, cycloaliphatic with or without substituents , to the corresponding 2- aryl propionic acid of the formula II of the drawing accompanying the specification using a heterogenous ruthenium, cobalt or nickel catalyst system.<br>
A majority of the 2- aryl propionic acid are well known non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs. The conventional synthesis of ibuprofen   involves six steps which use hazardous chemicals like sodium cyanide and the waste material produced require down stream treatments for disposal. Recently Hoechst Celanese Corporation has feveloped a novel environmentally benign three step catalytic route for the synthesis of ibuprofen in which carbonylation of para isobutyl phenyl ethanol is the key step. In the processes described in the patented literature the catalysts used were mainly Pd( PPh3)2Cl2: or PdCl2 or Pd( Oac)2 along with excess phosphine ligands ( EP 0, 400 892 A3, EP 0, 284.3 10 AI) which gave lower reaction rates ( TOP = 25-35 h -1) and lower selectivity to ibuprofen (56-69%) under mild conditions (130° C, 1000 psig). Higher selectivity ( &gt; 95 %) was obtained only at very high pressure of 2000 to 4500 psig and the rates still remained low. Us patent 5,536874 and the publication J. chem.. Tech. Biotechnol 1997, 70, 83-91 describes the carbonylation of p- IBPE (ibuprofen) in a two phase system wherein one phase in an aqueous medium which contains a water<br>
soluble palladium complex and an acid promoter. These processes also have disadvantages such as low reaction rates (TOF= 0.1 to 0.4 h-1) and lower ibuprolen selectivity (59-74%) under mild reaction conditions (90°C, 450 to 900 psig). The patents, EP 387 502 (1990)and EP 361 021 (1990) report the ysc of homogeneous Nickel catalysts but only in the presence of corrossive iodide promoters and gives low reaction rates and selectivity under even high pressure conditions. Another major problem assocoated with all these processes is the difficulty of catalyst separation and recycle.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have observed that the use of a new catalyst system comprising of a heterogeneous ruthenium, cobalt or nickel catalyst, a phosphine ligand, a protonic acid and a halidc source provide an improved catalyst system for the carbonylation of compounds  of general formula I to corresponding 2-arylpropionic acids. The use of such a catalyst system gives high reaction rates and high selectivity to 2-arylpropionic acids under mild reaction conditions with easy separation of and efficient recycle of the catalyst Another added advantage of this catalyst system is the low cost of the metals.<br>
The object of the present invention therefore is to provide an improved process for the preparation of 2-aryl propionic acids by the carbonylation of corresponding alcohols.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of 2- aryl propionic acid which comprises reacting an alcohol having the general formula 1 of the drawing accompanying this specification , wherein RI may be aryl, substituted aryl, napthyl or substituted napthyl, R2, R3, R4 and R5 may independently be hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, aryl alkyl, cyclo aliphatic with or without substituents, a halide source selected from the group consisting of halide salts or hydrohalic acid in the range of 5 to 500 moles a protonic acid such as herein described in the range of 5 to 500moles, water in the concentration range of 1 to 6 %(v/v) , hetrogenous ruthenium, cobalt or nickel catalyst wherein the concentration of metal   is 1 mole of metal for 500 to 50000 moles of alcohol and a phosphine ligand in the range of 20 to 50 moles in an organic solvent such as herein described in the carbon monoxide atmosphere in an autoclave at a temperature ranging between 30 to 130° C, for a period ranging between 50 to 1500 psig, cooling the reaction mixture to ambient temperature, flushing the autoclave with nitrogen , separating the catalyst, removing the solvent by conventional methods and isolating the 2- aryl propionic acid of the formula II of of the drawing accompanying the specification wherein R1 , R2, R3, R4 and R5 has the same meaning as defined above.<br>

triphenyl phosphine: 0.08165g p-toluene sulphonic acid : 1.065g LiCl: 0.2365g H2O: 1.2mL Methyl ethyl kctonc: 21.5mL<br>
The contents of the autoclave were flushed with nitrogen and then many times with carbon monoxide. Thereafter, the contents were heated to 115°C. After the temperature is attained, the autoclave was pressurised to 800 psig with carbon monoxide, stirring started and it was observed that gas absorption commenced immediately. For synthesis of ibuprofen, the pressure in the autoclave was maintained constant using carbon monoxide and the progress of the reaction was monitored by observing the pressure drop and by liquid sampling. The reaction was continued until the pressure drop was too low. The reactor was then cooled and the liquid phase analysed by gas chromatography.<br>
The GC analysis showed TOP of 245 h"1 and 99% conversion of p-lBPE with ibuprofcn selectivity of 99 %. The catalyst was filtered out and the solvent evaporated and the reaction mixture re-dissolved in toluene. The precipitated solid portion, which is a mixture of LiCl and lithium salt of p-tolucnc sulphonic acid was filtered out. The filtrate is treated with saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate two-three times and the aqueous phase is separated to obtain the sodium salt of ibuprofen, which on hydrolysis with acid and extraction with dichloromethane, evaporation and vacuum distillation gives the pure product.<br>
