The compounds represented by formula I are capable of forming acid addition salts, particularly pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I include those of inorganic acids, for example, hydrohalic acids such as hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid or hydroiodic acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid; and organic acids, for example aliphatic monocarboxylic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid, aliphatic hydroxy acids such as lactic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid or malic acid, dicarboxylic acids such as maleic acid or succinic acid, aromatic carboxylic acids such as benzoic acid, p-chlorobenzoic acid, diphenylacetic acid or triphenylacetic acid, aromatic hydroxy acids such as o-hydroxybenzoic acid, p---:-  ' !        hydroxybenzoic acid, l-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acid or 3-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acid, and sulfonic acids such as methanesulfonic acid or benzenesulfonic acid.<br><br>
These salts may be prepared from compounds of formula I by known salt-forming procedures.<br>
Compounds of formula I which contain acidic, e.g. carboxyl, groups, are also capable of forming salts with bases, in particular pharmaceutically acceptable bases such as those well known in the art; suitable such salts include metal salts, particularly alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts such as sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium salts, or salts with ammonia or pharmaceutically acceptable organic amines or heterocyclic bases such as ethanolamines, benzylamines or pyridine. These salts may be prepared from compounds of formula I by known salt-forming procedures.<br>
The compounds of formula I in free or salt form may exist in stereoisomeric forms according to the orientation of moieties attached to the cycloaliphatic ring. The invention embraces both individual such stereoisomers, i.e. cis and trans isomers, as well as mixtures thereof. Where R1 or R2 contain an asymmetric carbon atom, the compounds of formula I in free or salt form exist in individual optically active isomeric forms or as mixtures thereof, e.g. as racemic or diastereomeric mixtures. The invention embraces both individual optically active R and S isomers as well as mixtures, e.g. racemic or diastereomeric mixtures, thereof.<br>
Specific especially preferred compounds of formula I are those described hereinafter in the Examples.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of compounds of formula I<br>
in free or salt form which comprises<br>
(i)	(A) reacting a compound of formula II<br><br>
optionally in protected form, where R1 is as hereinbefore defined and L is a leaving atom or group, for example halogen or an aliphatic or aromatic sulfonyloxy group such as trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy, with a compound of formula EH<br><br>
optionally in protected form, where R2 is as hereinbefore defined and X is a leaving atom or group which is reactive with L in formula H to form a direct bond between R2 and the indicated naphthyridine ring, followed by deprotection if required;<br>
(B)	reacting a compound of formula I, where R2 is cycloalkyl substituted by a Ci-C8-alkoxycarbonyl group, to convert the alkoxycarbonyl group into a carboxy group;<br>
(C)	for the preparation of compounds of formula I where R2 is a cycloaliphatic group substituted by carboxy-C1-C8-alkoxy, hydrolysing a compound of formula I where R2 is a cycloaliphatic group substituted by C1-C8-alkoxycarbonyl-C1-C8alkoxy; or<br>
(D)	for the preparation of compounds of formula I when R1 is phenyl substituted by<br>
-SO-C1-C8-alkyl, oxidising a compound of formula I where R1 is phenyl substituted<br>
by C1-C8-alkylthio; and<br>
(ii)        recovering the product in free or salt form.<br>
Where L in formula II is an aromatic sulfonyloxy group, X may be, for example, a group YM- where Y is halogen such as iodine and M is a metal such as zinc or magnesium.<br>
Process variant (A) may be effected using known procedures for reaction of leaving atoms or groups or analogously, for example as hereinafter described in the Examples. Where X in formula Etl is YM-, the compound YMR2 may be formed in situ by reaction of the metal M and the halide YR2; where M is zinc, this in situ reaction is conveniently effected in the presence of dibromoethane and a trialkylsilyl halide, preferably in a solvent, e.g. an ether such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), convenient reaction temperatures being from 25 to 50 °C. Reaction of the compound of formula II with YMR2 may be effected in the presence of a transition metal catalyst, particularly a palladium-ketone complex catalyst, l,l'-bis(diphenyl-phosphino)ferrocene and a quaternary ammonium halide such as tetrabutylammonium iodide, conveniently in a solvent, e.g. a mixture of an ether such as THF and N-methyl-pyrrolidone(NMP), convenient reaction temperatures being from 25 to 50 °C. Where it is desired to minimise the possibility of reaction of functional groups other tteftnrhose<br><br>
participating in the desired reaction, such functional groups may be protected by-conventional protecting groups.<br>
Process variant (B) may be effected using known procedures for conversion of alkoxycarbonyl groups to carboxy groups, e.g. hydrolysis with an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide, or analogously such as hereinafter described in the Examples.<br>
Process variant (C) may be effected using art known procedures for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids, e.g. using trifluoroacetic acid, or analogously such as hereinafter described in the Examples.<br>
Process variant (D) may be effected using art known procedures for the oxidation of sulfanyl groups to sulfinyl groups, e.g. using ozone or hydrogen peroxide, or analogously such as hereinafter described in the Examples.<br>
Compounds of formula II may be prepared as described in W09 8/18796 or analogously, for example as hereinafter described in the Examples. Compounds of formula III may be prepared by known procedures, for example in situ as described hereinbefore and (in the Examples) hereinafter.<br>
Where reference is made herein to protected functional groups or to protecting groups, the protecting groups may be chosen in accordance with the nature of the functional group, for example as described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, T.W. Greene and P.G.M. -   Wuts, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, Second Edition, 1991, which reference also describes procedures suitable for replacement of the protecting groups by hydrogen.<br>
Compounds of formula I in free form may be converted into salt form, and vice versa, in a conventional manner. The compounds in free or salt form can be obtained in the form of hydrates or solvates containing a solvent used for crystallization. Compounds of formula I can be recovered from reaction mixtures and purified in a conventional manner.  Isomers, such as enantiomers, may be obtained in a conventional manner, e.g. by fractional crystallization or asymmetric synthesis from correspondingly asymmetrically substituted, e.g. optically active, starting materials.<br><br>
Compounds of formula I in free or salt form are useful as pharmaceuticals. Accordingly the invention also provides a compound of formula I in free or salt form for use as a pharmaceutical. The compounds of formula I in free or salt form, hereinafter referred to alternatively as "AGENTS OF THE INVENTION", exhibit cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoenzyme inhibiting activity, selective for type 4 isoenzyme. AGENTS OF THE INVENTION possess anti-inflammatory, anti-airways hyperreactivity and bronchodilator properties. They further possess immunosuppressive and TNFot secretion inhibitory activities. The pharmacological activities may be demonstrated in test methods, for example as follows:<br>
PDE4 Isoenzyme inhibition assay<br>
Cloning: GATEWAY flanked PDE4 cDNA constructs containing the coding regions of the three isoenzymes, human PDE4A, human PDE4B, and human PDE4D are generated by PCR and transposed into the GATEWAY shuttle vector pDONOR-201. In addition a 6-histidine tag is introduced by PCR onto the carboxyl terminal end of each of the constructs to facilitate protein purification. Following sequence verification, the PDE4 constructs are transposed into the GATEWAY expression vector pDEST-8. Positive recombinants are selected and transposed into £. coli strain DHlOBac and bacmid produced transfected into SF21 cells using Bac-To-Bac (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Positive transfections are selected and used to generate high titer viral stocks for use in protein expression.<br>
PDE4 Expression: Sf21 cells are grown to a density of 2 X 106 cells/ml and infected with human PDE4A, PDE4B or PDE4D3 containing baculovirus to a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1 for 72 hours. The infected cells are harvested by centrifugation at 1,400 g for 4 minutes at 4°C and the cell pellets are frozen at -80°C.'Sf21 (Spodoptera frugiperda 21) insect cells are routinely maintained at densities between 3 X 105 and 3 X 106 cells/ml in SF00 Serum Free Medium (Invitorgen Life Technologies). Sf21 cells (1X109) are resuspended in 100 ml cold (4°C) Lysis Buffer (50 mM Na2HP04, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole). Cells are incubated on ice for 30 minutes then centrifuged at 15,000 g for 20 minutes at 4DC.<br>
PDE4 Purification: The 6 Histidine-tagged PDE4 proteins are isolated from crude cell lysates . by a batch-wise Ni-NTA purification strategy (QIAGEN). N-NTA resin is first pre-rinsed to remove ethanol preservative and equilibrated with Lysis Buffer. Cell lysate is added, (10 ml<br><br>
50% Ni-NTA slurry resin per 50 ml lysate), and gently rotated on a mixer at 4°C for 1-2 hours. The sample is then centrifuged at 1,000 g for 5 minutes at 4°C using Denley benchtop centrifuge. The supernatant is removed and the resin is washed 3 times with 50 ml ice cold Wash Buffer (50 mM Na2HP04, 300 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole) followed by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 5 min at 4°C. The 6His-tagged protein is eluted from the resin with 3x 5 ml ice cold Elution Buffer (50 mM NaH2P04, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole) and collected by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 5 minutes at 4°C. The supernatants are then pooled before buffer exchange and concentration using a VivaScience 20 ml 5K 0.2 pM Concentrator. Samples are aliquoted and stored at -20°C.<br>
SDS-PAGE Electrophoresis: Purified PDE4 samples are analysed by SDS-PAGE using 8-16% gradient mini-gels (Novex) and samples are denatured at 100°C in reducing sample buffer (62 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 3% SDS, 5% D-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromophenol blue) for 3 min prior to loading. Novex SeeBlue pre-stained MW standards are also loaded. Gels are run at a constant 25 mA. Gels are stained with GelCode Colloidal Coomassie G-250 Blue Stain Reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's procedure.<br>
Western Blot Analysis: Samples are analysed on Novex 8-16% gradient gels as described above. The gel is then wet blotted onto Millipore Immobilon-P PVDF membrane using the tank transfer method with 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 192 mM Glycine, 15% methanol transfer buffer at 80 mA for 16h. Immunoprobing is carried out in TTBS buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 0.9% (vv/v) NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) casein) with an anti-6his monoclonal antibody (QIAGEN) at 1:1000 dilution, An anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate is used as the secondary antibody (Sigma A9919) at 1:10000 dilution and proteins visualised with BCIP/NBT substrate prepared from tablets (Sigma) according to the manufacturers procedure.<br>
PDE4 Assay: The assay is based on Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA) technology. Enzyme is diluted with enzyme dilution buffer (lOmM Tris-HCl, pH7.5 containing ImM EDTA) in order to obtain between 10-30% total substrate hydrolysis during the assay. The enzymatic reaction is started by adding 10 pi diluted enzyme to 80 pi substrate (0.1 pCi [3H]-cAMP, 1 pM cAMP) and 10 pi inhibitor solution in a 96-well microtiter plate. After 30-60 minutes incubation at room temperature the reaction is stopped :.by adding 50pl PDE SPA beads (20 mg/ml). After.30 minutes the plate is centrifuged (3000 g,1 10 minutes) and counted (Packard TopCount).<br><br>
Inhibitor stock solutions are prepared in 100% dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and diluted with DMSO/water to achieve 10 concentrations to cover the range of 0-100% inhibition. The concentration of DMSO is kept constant at 1% (v/v) throughout the assay.<br>
The concentration at which 50% inhibition occurs (IC50) is determined from inhibition -concentration curves in a conventional manner. Within the PDE4 isoenzyme group, AGENTS OF THE INVENTION generally exhibit selectivity for inhibition of PDE4D isoenzyme relative to PDE4A, PDE4B and PDE4C. The compounds of Examples 1, 3, 10, 12, 14 and 15 haveIC5o values of 38, 9, 25, 21, 57 and 9 nM respectively for inhibition of PDE4D in the above assay.<br>
Having regard to their inhibition of binding of PDE4, AGENTS OF THE INVENTION are useful in the treatment of conditions mediated by PDE4, particularly inflammatory conditions. Treatment in accordance with the invention may be symptomatic or prophylactic.<br>
Accordingly, AGENTS OF THE INVENTION are useful in the treatment of inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases, resulting, for example, in reduction of tissue damage, bronchial hyperreactivity, remodelling or disease progression. Inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include asthma of whatever type or genesis including both intrinsic (non-allergic) asthma and extrinsic (allergic) asthma, mild asthma, moderate asthma, severe asthma, bronchitic asthma, exercise-induced asthma, occupational asthma and asthma induced following bacterial or viral infection. Treatment of asthma is also to be understood as embracing treatment of subjects, e.g. of less than 4 or 5 years of age, exhibiting wheezing symptoms and diagnosed or diagnosable as "wheezy infants", an established patient category of major medical concern and now often identified as incipient or early-phase asthmatics.  (For convenience this particular asthmatic condition is referred to as "wheezy-infant syndrome".)<br>
Prophylactic efficacy in the treatment of asthma will be evidenced by reduced frequency or severity of symptomatic attack, e.g. of acute asthmatic or bronchoconstrictor attack, improvement in lung function or improved airways hyperreactivity. It may further be evidenced by reduced requirement for other, symptomatic therapy, i.e. therapy for or intended to restrict or abort symptomatic attack when it occurs, for example anti-: inflammatory (e.g. corticosteroid) or bronchodilatory. Prophylactic benefit in asthma may in particular be apparent in subjects prone to "morning dipping". "Morning dipping" is a<br><br>
recognised asthmatic syndrome, common to a substantial percentage of asthmatics and characterised by asthma attack, e.g. between the hours of about 4 to 6 am, i.e. at a time normally substantially distant form any previously administered symptomatic asthma therapy.<br>

Example 15 : 4-[8-(3-Methylsulfanyl-phenyl)-[l,7]naphthyridin-6-yl]-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid<br>
Lithium hydroxide (168 mg, 1.76 mmol) in water (1.7 ml) is added to a solution of 4-[8-(3-methylsulfanyI-phenyl)-[l,7]naphthyridin-6-yl]-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid ethyl ester (650 mg, 1.6 mmol) in THF (3.2 ml) under argon. Methanol is added to maintain solution (4 ml) and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 5 hours. The mixture is evaporated to dryness then partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. The aqueous layer is acidified to pH 2 then extracted into ethylacetate and dried over magnesium sulfate. Evaporation gives a green gum which is reevaporated from methanol then DCM / diethylether to give a yellow/green foam. The foam is triturated with 3:1 hexanerdiethyl ether, 2:1<br><br>
hexanerdiethylether, ethylacetate/hexane/ether mixtures and finally 5:1 diethylethenethanol to yield an off-white solid. This is then recrystallised from ethanol to yield the title compound. M.p 177.6-178.2°C, MS (AP+) 379.05<br>

Example 16: 4-[8-(3'Methanesulfinyl-phenyl)-[l,7]naphthyridin-6-yl]-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid<br>
A solution of 4-[8-(3-Methanesulfanyl-phenyl)-[l,7]naphthyridin-6-yl]-cyclohexane-carboxylic acid (30 mg, 0.079 mmol) in THF (1.4 ml) is cooled in a salt/ice bath and oxone (14.5 mg, 0.024 mmol) in water (0.5 ml) is added. After 15 minutes the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and after a further 30 minutes more oxone (14.5 mg is added). The mixture is diluted with ethyl acetate/water and the aqueous layer extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers are washed with brine then dried over magnesium sulfate. Filtration followed by evaporation yields a foam consisting of title compound and 4-[8-(3-Methanesulfonyl-phenyl)-[l,7]naphthyridin-6-yl]-cyclohexane-carboxylic acid. MS (AP+) 395.87<br>
