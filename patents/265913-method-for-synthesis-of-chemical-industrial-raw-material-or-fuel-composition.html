Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method for synthesizing an organic compound useful as a chemical industry raw material and fuel composition or a mixture thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
Presently, oxo process comprising synthesizing normal aldehyde by oxidation of normal paraffin and hydrogenatmg the obtained aldehyde is the mainstream of methods for synthesizing industrial linear alcohol. However, as the price of naphtha, raw material of normal paraffin, is escalating, the profitability is decreasing. Besides the oxo method, a method using methanol (alcohol) and synthetic gas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen) as raw materials is known. However, as carbon monoxide which is harmful is used m the method and that it is a high-pressure reaction, the plant is of a large scale and the profitability is not good. Further, Ziegler method comprising oligomerizing ethylene by trialkylaliominum, forming a long-chain aluminum alkoxide by air-oxidation, and hydrolyzing the resultant to obtain a long-chain primary alcohol is used. With that method, only alcohol having even numbers of carbon atoms having a distribution of 2 - 28 carbon atoms can be obtained. Moreover, a method for synthesizing 1-propanol from methanol and ethanol by Guerbet method has been proposed, while the yield is not good, as the reaction conditions are specific and thus not suitable for practical use. Furthermore, alcohol is also<br>
synthesized from plants such as copra oil (oleochemical) , while only alcohol having 8 or 16 carbon atoms can be obtained, and for alcohol having other numbers of atoms, it is necessary to depend on naphtha.<br>
As a method for synthesizing higher alcohol from methanol and ethanol, a method using ununiformed catalysts such as MgO can be exemplified (see nonpatent documents 1-5, patent documents 1-4), while these methods are not suitable for industrialization as they are many side reaction products, or the reaction conditions are specific. Further, as a method for synthesizing butanol from ethanol, a method using oxidative products of alkaline-earth metals as catalysts (see nonpatent document 6) , a method using zeolite substituted with alkaline metal (see nonpatent document 7) , a method using a mixture of metal oxidative products (see nonpatent document 8) can be exemplified. As for a method for manufacturing butadiene from ethanol, a method using a metal oxidative product or a mixture thereof (see nonpatent documents 9-11), a method using a sepiolite catalyst which is a cellular acicular clay can be exemplified. However, these methods are not industrially suitable as the catalysts are difficult to prepare, or that the reaction temperature is high.<br>
On the other hand, a method for synthesizing butanol, butadiene, or fuel compositions by using a hydroxyapatite catalyst(see patent documents 7, 8) has been proposed, while as it is a method using only ethanol as raw material, organic compounds that can be synthesized were limited. In other words, as ethanol is a material having 2 carbon atoms, it is not suitable for synthesizing organic compounds having odd numbers of carbon<br>
atoms, and particularly, alcohol having odd numbers of carbon atoms cannot be synthesized.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Object to be solved by the Invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a novel method for manufacturing various organic compounds from 2 or more kinds of alcohol or from 1 kind of alcohol having 3 or more carbon atoms. Particularly, it is to provide a method for synthesizing linear alcohol or branched-chain alcohol in good yield, by using 2 or more kinds of alcohols.<br>
Means to Solve the Object<br>
The present inventors made a study for manufacturing organic compounds to be used as a chemical industry raw material, and found out that by using hydroxyapatite or hydrotalcite as a catalyst, various organic compounds can be manufactured from<br>
2	or more kinds of alcohol, or from 1 kind of alcohol having<br>
3	or more carbon atoms. The present invention has been thus completed.<br>
Further, the present inventors made a keen study for synthesizing linear alcohols, under conditions that almost all of the alcohols synthesized by using alcohol raw material were branched-cham alcohols, and that it was estimated to be extremely difficult to synthesize linear alcohols. As a result, they found out that by allowing ethanol and linear alcohol other than ethanol to contact hydroxyapatite or hydrotalcite, a linear alcohol can be synthesized m good yield. Currently, ethanol is synthesized through the conversion of sugars obtained from sugarcanes, beets, etc., by a fermentation method. Recently, a technique for synthesizing ethanol from biomass, agricultural and forestry residues, has been established, and a striking increase in the production of ethanol can be expected in future. Further, as the production cost of ethanol is becoming comparable or less than the crude oil, it is an important object to synthesize chemical industry raw materials using ethanol as a raw material. The process of the present invention uses ethanol derived from plants as a raw material, and the reaction proceeds easily at normal pressure.  Thus,<br>
comparing with the conventional synthesizing method using fossil or mineral resource, which emit carbon dioxide and promote global heating, as a raw material, it is an important synthesizing method for global environment.<br>
Further, the present inventors found out that by allowing methanol and alcohol having 3 or more carbon atoms to contact hydroxyapatite or hydrotalcite, a branched-cham alcohol can be synthesized in good yield.<br>

the linear alcohol is 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, or unsaturated alcohols thereof.<br>

Further, the present invention relates to ("13") a method for synthesizing 1 or more kinds of organic compounds comprising allowing 2 or more kinds of alcohol to contact hydrotalcite; ("14") the method according to "13", comprising allowing ethanol and linear alcohol other than ethanol to contact hydrotalcite to synthesize a linear alcohol having 3 or more carbon atoms; ("15") the method according to "14", wherein the linear alcohol other than ethanol is methanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, or unsaturated alcohols thereof.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
As for a method for synthesizing an organic compound of the present invention (first synthesizing method), it is not particularly limited as long as it is a method comprising allowing 2 or more kinds of alcohols to contact hydroxyapatite (except those supporting metal catalysts or metal ion catalysts acting on alcohol) . Examples of organic compounds synthesized by the method for synthesizing of the present invention include:<br>
paraffins, olefins, dienes, trienes, alcohols, ethers, ketones, aldehydes, and esters. Specific examples include: ethane, ethylene, acetaldehyde, propylene, propanol, acetone, butene, 1,3-butadiene,  1-butanol,  3-butene-l-ol,  t-crotylalcohol, c-crotylalcohol, diethylether, butyraldehyde,  2-butanone, t-crotonealdehyde, c-crotonaldehyde, 1-pentanol, 2-pentanol, 2-pentanone, butylethylether, 1-hexanol, 2-ethyl-l-butanol, hexanal,    1-heptanol,    2-ethyl-l-propanol,    octanol, 2-ethyl-l-hexanol,  octanol,  and nonanol.   These organic compounds having 2 or more carbon atoms can be used as a chemical industry raw material, and among these, a mixture of organic compounds having 4 or more carbon atoms can be used as a fuel composition.<br>
As for a raw material alcohol used m the first synthesizing method of the present invention, it is 2 or more kinds of alcohol, and it may be 2 kinds of alcohol, or 3 or more kinds of alcohol. Further, raw material alcohol may be a linear alcohol or branched-chain alcohol, and may be a saturated alcohol or unsaturated alcohol. Further, the number of carbon atoms is not particularly limited, but it is preferred to be an alcohol having 1-22 carbon atoms, from the point of view of easiness to obtain.<br>
Further, it is preferred that at least 1 kind of alcohol of the raw material alcohol, is methanol or ethanol. By using methanol or ethanol for at least 1 kind of alcohol, organic compounds can be synthesized in good yield.<br>
Particularly, according to a method allowing ethanol and linear alcohol other than ethanol to contact hydroxyapatite, it is possible to synthesize a liner alcohol having 3 or more atoms in good yield. The yield is for example, 3C-mol% or more, and preferably 5C-mol% or more. C-mol denotes the number of carbon atoms of the synthesized alcohol/the number of carbon atoms of raw material alcohol used. As for the linear alcohol other than ethanol, from the view point of easiness to obtain or cost, a saturated or unsaturated alcohol having 1-22 carbon atoms IS preferred, and a saturated or unsaturated alcohol having 1-8 carbon atoms is more preferred. Specific examples include methanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, and unsaturated alcohol thereof. Further, the amount used (mixing ratio) of ethanol and linear alcohol other than ethanol is not particularly limited, while m order to synthesize linear alcohol more efficiently, it is preferred that the mixing ratio is approximately equimolar (about 1 : 0.9-1.1) when the conversion rates of the two alcohols are almost the same. When the conversion rates of the two alcohols are different, it is preferred to mix a larger amount of alcohol with the lower conversion rate. Specifically, when using ethanol and 1-propanol, it is particularly preferred to use ethanol m an amount of about 0.9 - 1.1 (molar ratio) per 1 portion of 1-propanol.<br>
According to a method comprising allowing methanol and alcohol having 3 or more carbon atoms to contact hydroxyapatite, it is possible to synthesize a branched-chain alcohol in good yield. As for the above alcohol having 3 or more carbon atoms.<br>
from the view point of easiness to obtain or cost, a saturated or unsaturated alcohol having 3-22 carbon atoms is preferred, and a saturated or unsaturated alcohol having 3-8 carbon atoms is more preferred.   Specific examples include propanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, heptanol, octanol, and unsaturated alcohol thereof. Among these, linear alcohol is preferred, and specific examples include 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, and unsaturated alcohol thereof.  Further, the amount used (mixing ratio) of methanol and alcohol having 3 or more carbon atoms is not particularly limited, while it is preferred to use 0. 9 or more (molar ratio) of methanol per 1 alcohol having 3 or more carbon atoms, from the view point that a branched-cham alcohol is synthesized in good yield.<br>
Further, as for a method for synthesizing an organic compound of the present invention (second synthesizing method) , it is not particularly limited as long as it is a method allowing 1 kind of alcohol having 3 or more carbon atoms to contact hydroxyapatite (except those supporting metal catalysts or metal ion catalysts acting on alcohol). Examples of organic compounds synthesized by the synthesizing method of the present invention include, similarly as the above first synthesizing method, paraffins, olefins, dienes, trienes, alcohols, ethers, ketones, aldehydes, and esters. Among these, each organic compound having 2 or more carbon atoms can be used as chemical industry raw material. Further, a mixture of organic compounds having 4 or more carbon atoms can be used as a fuel composition.<br>
As for the above alcohol having 3 or more carbon atoms,<br>
it may be a linear alcohol or branched-cham alcohol, and it may be a saturated alcohol or unsaturated alcohol. Further, the number of carbon atoms is not particularly limited, while from the view point of easiness to obtain or cost, a saturated or unsaturated alcohol having 3-22 carbon atoms is preferred, and a saturated or unsaturated alcohol having 3-8 carbon atoms IS more preferred. Specific examples include propanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, heptanol, octanol, and unsaturated alcohol thereof. Among these, linear alcohol is preferred, and specific examples include 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, and unsaturated alcohol thereof.<br>
Hydroxyapatite used in the synthesizing method of the present invention (first and second synthesizing methods) is one kind of calcium phosphate, and is generally indicated by the stoichiometric composition Caio (PO4)e (OH) 2. However, it can form an apatite structure, showing a property of hydroxyapatite, even it is a hydroxyapatite with a non-stoichiometric composition wherein the Ca/P molar ratio does not reach 1.67. Such synthesized hydroxyapatite with a Ca/P molar ratio of approximately 1.4 - 1.8 is also encompassed within the hydroxyapatite of the present invention. Particularly, m a method for synthesizing an organic compound of the present invention, a hydroxyapatite with a Ca/P molar ratio of 1.60 - 1.80 is preferred. The hydroxyapatite may be in any form including granule, sphere, pellet, and honeycomb.<br>
Further, the hydroxyapatite used in the synthesizing<br>
method of the present invention does not encompass those supporting metal catalysts or metal ion catalysts acting on alcohol. Examples of metal catalyst or metal ion catalyst acting on alcohol include metals or metal ions described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 5-305238.<br>
The hydroxyapatite used in the synthesizing method of the present invention may support in advance 1 kind of raw material alcohol such as methanol or ethanol. In other words, before conducting the synthesizing reaction of organic compounds, it is possible to allow hydroxyapatite to react with 1 kind of raw material alcohol, and to use alcohol-supported hydroxyapatite, wherein hydroxyapatite is supporting alcohol. The absorption peak derived from alcohol of the alcohol-supported hydroxyapatite can be observed by infrared spectroscopy. By using the alcohol-supported hydroxyapatite, distribution of reaction products can be controlled. In other words, many products derived from supported alcohol can be synthesized.<br>
In the synthesizing method of the present invention, at least one compound selected from the group consisting of metal oxidative product, zeolite, silica light, clay mineral of the family of kaolin, clay mineral of the family of pyrophyllite, clay mineral of the family of smectite, hydrotalcite, sepiolite, calcium silicate, calcium fluoride, calcium sulfate, apatite fluoride, magnesium hydroxide, chitm, lithium phosphate, aluminum phosphate, and magnesium phosphate, can be mixed to the above hydroxyapatite for controlling the reaction. 2 or more of these compounds can be used in combination.<br>
In the present invention, when synthesizing an organic compound useful as a chemical industry raw material, m order to increase the selectivity of desired organic compounds, the size, surface area, reaction conditions (contact time, reaction temperature, pressure, etc.) of granules used can be appropriately selected.<br>
As for a reaction form in the present invention, it may be a batch method or a sequential method, while a continuous method is preferred from the view point of industrial economic efficiency. Further, a reactor in any form including a fixed bed, a moving bed, a fluidized bed or a slurry bed can be used. Moreover, it may be a liquid phase reaction or a gas phase reaction, and the reaction may be conducted at normal pressure, under pressure, or reduced pressure. In case of a gas phase reaction, a mixed alcohol gas alone may be m contact with hydroxyapatite, or it may be m contact with hydroxyapatite together with an inert carrier gas such as nitrogen or helium. By allowing to contact together with a carrier gas, unnecessary retention of raw material and products may be suppressed, and the reaction may be conducted more efficiently. At that time, in order to maintain the catalyst activity, reactive gas such as hydrogen, hydrocarbon, and water may be accompanied in the carrier gas. Further, in order to prevent that carbons are precipitated on the surface of hydroxyapatite, which may decrease the alcohol conversion rate and change the nature of reactions, it is preferred that a regeneration treatment wherein the hydroxyapatite is heated under oxygen atmosphere, is periodically conducted. In other words, it is preferred that a catalyst regeneration apparatus that is capable of conducting<br>
a regeneration treatment as above-mentioned is provided on the reactor.<br>
It is not possible to determine categorically the contact time of alcohol and hydroxyapatite as it affects also the reaction temperature. Generally, in case of a gas phase reaction by a continuous method, the contact time is about 0.1 - 20 sec, and preferably about 0.4 - 5 sec. Further, the reaction temperature is generally 100 - 700°C, and preferably 200 - 600°C. Particularly, when synthesizing in good yield a linear alcohol by using ethanol and linear alcohol other than ethanol, the reaction temperature is preferably 250 - 450°C, and more preferably 300 - 450°C. Further, when synthesizing a branched-cham alcohol in good yield by using methanol and alcohol having 3 or more carbon atoms, the reaction temperature is preferably 250 - 500°C, and more preferably 300 - 450°C.<br>
When conducting a gas phase reaction with 2 or more kinds of alcohol, it is preferred to vaporize the alcohol-mixed solution, and it is preferred to vaporize rapidly, without allowing the reaction of 2 or more kinds of alcohol to be conducted. Therefore, as for the vaporizing temperature, a temperature that is higher than the boiling point of the alcohol having the higher boiling point, and at which the alcohol with the lower boiling point does not react is preferred. Specifically, the preferred temperature is, in case of methanol and ethanol, 150 - 200°C, and in case of ethanol and 1-octanol, 200 - 250°C.<br>
As the boiling points of 2 or more kinds of alcohol are<br>
different, 1 kind of alcohol having been vaporized may be firstly introduced to form a complex catalyst supporting alcohol, and then the other alcohol m form or liquid or gas may be introduced to start the reaction (liquid phase reaction, gas phase reaction) . When using methanol or ethanol, it is preferred to firstly introduce methanol or ethanol having a low boiling point, and to form a complex catalyst supporting methanol or ethanol. Generally, the order of alcohol to be introduced may be determined according to the boiling point as in the above, while when using ethanol, it is preferred to introduce ethanol in the first order.<br>
A mixture of organic compounds thus obtained, may be used as a fuel composition etc. directly in form of mixture. Alternatively, a desired organic compound may be separated or purified according to a conventional separation or purification method, for example by rectification, microporous membrane separation, extraction, or adsorption.<br>
Further, as for a method for synthesizing an organic compound of the present invention (third synthesizing method) , it is not particularly limited as long as it is a method allowing 2 or more kinds of alcohol to contact hydrotalcite. Organic compounds synthesized by the synthesizing method of the present invention, are similar to the above case using hydroxyapatite, and various organic compounds may be synthesized m good yield. Particularly, when ethanol and linear alcohol other than ethanol is used, a linear alcohol having 3 or more carbon atoms can be synthesized in good yield.<br>
Hydrotalcite used in the present invention is a clay mineral having a composition of Mg6Al2 (OH) 16CO3' 4H2O. Similarly to the above-mentioned hydroxyapatite, it may support alcohol beforehand.<br>
Raw material alcohol or synthesizing method is similar to that of the above first or second synthesizing method, and thus the detailed explanation is abbreviated.<br>
The present invention will be explained in more detail in the following by referring to the Examples, while the technical scope of the present invention shall not be limited to these exemplifications.<br>
Examples<br>
[First Synthesizing Method] [Example 1-1] (Catalyst)<br>
As for a catalyst used in the Example, a hydroxyapatite prepared by a common method was used. In the Table, "HAPl" denotes a hydroxyapatite which Ca/P molar ratio is 1.66, "HAP2" denotes a hydroxyapatite which Ca/P molar ratio is 1.64, and "HAP3" denotes a hydroxyapatite which Ca/P molar ratio is 1.61. As for a catalyst used in the comparative example, as Mg(0H)2, MgO reagent (Wako Pure Chemicals) boiled and hydrated in distilled water (see Ueda, W.; Kuwabara, T.; Ohshida, T.; Morikawa, Y. A Low-pressure Guerbet Reaction over Magnesium Oxide Catalyst. J. Chem. Soc, Chem. Commun., 1990, 1558-1559), as for Zr02, a reference catalyst of Catalyst (JRC-ZRO-5), and<br>
as for others, reagents from Wako Pure Chemicals were used, respectively.<br>
(Evaluation of catalyst property)<br>
A fixed bed gas flow catalytic reactor (Ohkura Riken) was used as a reactor. 0.2 - 4 cc of hydroxyapatite was filled in a silica reaction tube with a diameter of 5 mm. As a pretreatment, thermal dehydration treatment was conducted for 30 min under a carrier gas atmosphere (1% Ar/He base; flow 112 ml/mm) at 500°C. Following the pretreatment, mixed alcohol gas diluted with helium (alcohol concentration 20 vol%) was introduced so that GHSV becomes 500 - 10000 (1/h) to allow reaction at normal pressure. For the reaction temperature, a sampling was conducted every 50°C from 100-500°C. A gas chromatography mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used for the identification of the components of the reaction gas, and a gas chromatography (GC) (detector: FID) was used for the measurement of the alcohol conversion rate and the selectivity of the synthetic gas, to quantify the amount of each component from the peak surface value of each component. For each test, the yield of organic compounds having 2 or more carbon atoms (C2+), organic compounds having 4 or more carbon atoms (C4+), alcohol (linear and branched-cham) , and linear alcohol were measured. The results are shown m Tables 1 - 4 . In the Tables, "n-C" denotes normal alcohol, "b-C" denotes branched chain alcohol, and "C=" denotes unsaturated alcohol.<br>
(Organic compounds having 2 or more carbon atoms) (C2+))<br>
Yield of organic compounds of C2 or more in various combinations of raw material alcohols is shown m Table 1.<br>
[Table   1]<br><br>
(Table Removed) <br>
(Organic compounds having 4 or more carbon atoms) (C4+))<br>
Yield of organic compounds of C4 or more in various combinations of raw material alcohols is shown in Table 2. [Table 2]<br><br>
(Table Removed) <br><br>
(alcohols (linear ana brancned-cham))<br>
Yield of alcohols (linear and branched-chain) m various combinations of raw material alcohols is shown m Table 3.<br>
[Table  3]<br><br>
(Table Removed) <br>
(Linear alcohol)<br>
Yield of linear alcohol m various combinations of raw material alcohols is shown in Table 4 . Yield of linear alcohol in Table 4 shows the yield of linear alcohol synthesized directly from 2 kinds of raw material alcohols. For example, when methanol (CI) and ethanol (C2) are used as raw materials, yield of 1-propanol IS shown. When ethanol (C2) and 1-propanol (C3) are used as raw materials, yield of 1-pentanol (C5) is shown.<br>
[Table   4]<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
As it is clear from Tables 1 and 2, according to the synthesizing method of the present invention, organic compounds useful as a chemical industry raw material can be synthesized in good yield. Further, as it is clear from Tables 3 and 4, when ethanol and linear alcohol other than ethanol are used, liner alcohol is synthesized in good yield. When methanol and alcohol having 3 or more carbon atoms are used, branched-chain alcohol is synthesized in good yield.<br>
[Example 1-2]<br>
Ethanol and 1-propanol were used as raw material alcohols, and by changing the mixing ratio, reaction was conducted similarly as Example 1-1. Yield of alcohol against the reaction temperature is shown in Figs. 1-3.<br>
As it is clear from Figs. 1-3, kinds of alcohol produced vary depending on the mixing ratio (molar ratio) . When the mixing ratio is 1:1, 1-pentanol which is a linear alcohol is synthesized the most. Therefore, when synthesizing linear alcohol having odd number of carbon atoms, such as 1-pentanol, when the converting ratio of raw material alcohol is almost equal, it is preferred that the mixing ratio is about 1:1.<br>
[Second synthesizing method] [Example 2] (Catalysts)<br>
The same catalysts as Example 1 were used.<br>
(Estimation of Catalyst properties)<br>
Reaction was conducted similarly as Example 1, except for<br>
using 1 kind of alcohol having 3 or more carbon atoms as raw material alcohol. For each test, yield of organic compounds of C2 or more, organic compounds of C4 or more, alcohol (linear and branched-cham) , and linear alcohol were measured. The results are shown in Tables 5-7. Linear alcohol was not produced in any of the Examples or Comparative Examples. (Organic compounds having 2 or more carbon atoms (C2+))<br>
Yield of organic compounds of 02 or more for each raw material alcohol is shown m Table 5.<br>
[Table 5]<br><br>
(Table Removed) <br>
 (Organic compounds having 4 or more carbon atoms (C4+))<br>
Yield of organic compounds of C4 or more for each raw material alcohol is shown in Table 6.<br>
[Table 6]<br><br>
(Table Removed) <br>
 (Alcohol (linear and branched-cham)<br>
Yield of alcohol (linear and branched-cham) for each raw material alcohol is shown in Table 7.<br>
[Table 7]<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
As it is clear from Tables 5-7, according to the synthesizing method of the present invention, organic compounds useful as a chemical industry raw material can be synthesized in good yield.<br>
[Third synthesizing method] [Example 3] (Catalyst)<br>
Hydrotalcite (Wako Pure Chemicals) was used as a catalyst.<br>
(Estimation of Catalyst properties)<br>
Reaction was conducted similarly as Example 1, except for using hydrotalcite instead of hydroxyapatite. For each test, yield of organic compounds of C2 or more (02 + ) , organic compounds of C4 or more (C4 + ) , alcohol (linear and branched-cham) , and linear alcohol were measured. The results are shown in Table 8.<br>
[Table 8]<br><br>
(Table Removed) <br>
As It is clear from Table 8, according to the synthesizing method of the present invention, organic compounds useful as a chemical industry raw material can be synthesized in good yield.<br>
[Reference Example]<br>
Hydroxyapatite  (HAPl)  was exposed to about 7 vol%<br>
ethanol/He mixed gas for 1 hour m a reactor, and then emission was conducted. The inner state of the reactor after 1 hour of exposure to the mixed gas and the following 30 min of emission was measured by in situ FT-IR with a diffuse reflection method. The results are shown in Figs 4 and 5. In Fig. 4, the upper spectrum shows the state after 1 hour exposure to the mixed gas, and the lower spectrum shows the state after 30 mm emission. As it IS clear from Figs. 4 and 5, it can be observed that ethanol is absorbed and supported by hydroxyapatite.<br>
Industrxal Applicability<br>

Particularly, when using 2 or more kinds of alcohols, linear alcohol or branched-cham alcohol can be synthesized in good yield.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
