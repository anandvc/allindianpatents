				<td>The present invention provides a process for the preparation of a new polymeric composition which exhibits catalytic activity similar to hydrolytic enzymes especially -chymotrypsin. The process of the present invention involves reacting vinyl monomers comprising functional groups present in the active site of a-chymotrypsin. The functional groups are brought together by complexation with a metal ion and an appropriate print molecule. The complex is then immobilized by polymerization in the presence of a cross-linker and a U.V. sensitive monomer. The resulting composition exhibits hydrolytic activity similar to -chymotrypsin &quot;and is useful for the conversion of esters and amides to. the corresponding alcohols and amines. The composition offers additional advantages such as enhanced catalytic activity due to improved accessibility in the high surface area .polymeric catalyst, stability at elevated temperatures, ease of recovery from the reaction mixture, ability to withstand pH variations and ability to switch on-off the catalytic activity by photoregulation.</td>

				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of polymer useful for the conversion of esters and amides to corresponding alcohols and'amines.<br>
Catalytic activity of hydrolytic enzymes in the hydrolysis of esters and amides is characterized by high reaction rates and high selectivity/ However, they undergo irreversible deactivation at higher temperatures, due to pH variations, shear etc. Since the enzymes are expensive, it is desirable to use them for repeated applications. But this is rendered difficult as the enzymes often lose their - catalytic activity during . their recovery from the reaction media. These disadvantages limit their industrial applications. One of the means to get around this problem,  is to  immobilize the enzymes on suitable polymeric supports- These approaches however cannot completely overcome the limitations of the enzymes. Also the   efficacy is limited by the extent of 'immobilization that could be achieved.<br>
Prior- art in this area describes polymers which in solution act as catalysts for the hydrolysis of esters and amides (R.Breslow. , Science/ 218, 53.2, 1982, J.Nh Lehn. ,. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.- Engl . 27," 90, 1988, V.T. D'Souza, K. Hanabusa, T.O'Leavy, R.C. Gad-wood and MvL. Bender., Biochem. .Biophys. Res. Commun.<br><br>
129, '727,  1988, H.J. Van den Berg and  G.  Challa  in Syntheses  and Separations using  Functional  Polymers.<br><br>
Ed. B.C. Sherrington and P. Hodge, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Chichester, 227, 1988). Unfortunately these polymers have very low activity and are difficult to recover from the reaction system.<br>
Highly crosslinked polymers have also been used as catalysts for hydrolysis (A. Leonhardt and K. Mosbach., React. Polym. 6, 285 1987, B. Sellergren and K.J. Shea., Tetrahedron : Asymm 5, 1403, 1994, D.K. Robinson and K. Mosbach., J. Chem. Soc. "Chem. Commun. 969, 1989). These catalysts do not exhibit -chymo-trypsin like catalytic activity nor do they contain all the functional groups involved in the active site of -chymotrypsin.<br>
It is a principal object of the present invention to provide a new polymer composition which is useful for the conversion of esters and ami'des to the corresponding alcohols and amines and which overcomes the disadvantages inherent in the polymers hitherto used in the prior art.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a polymer composition for the above mentioned purposes which eliminates the difficulties associated with low reactivity, and problems associated with the recovery of the polymer from.the reaction media and offer high<br><br>
catalytic   activity . and" selectivity for the  hydrolysis reactions.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a polymer composition which -offers additional advantages such as enhanced activity due to improved accessibility, stability at higher temperatures, ability to withstand pH variations and enable switching on-off the activity of the polymer in response to a particular stimulus especially light.<br>
As a result of our sustained research, we have been, able to ascertain that the activity of a polymer composition can be signi'ficantly enhanced when the functional groups present in the polymers are brought - in close proximity'by complexation in the presence of metal ion and a print molecule and are immobilized in . place by polymerization in .the -presence of a crosslinker on the internal surface of macroporous polymers. ' -<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of polymer useful for the conversion of esters and amides to corresponding alcohols and amines which comprises<br>
(a) forming a complex between a transition metal ion, a vinyl monomer with a hydroxyl group in the pendant chain,. a vinyl -monomer with a carboxyl group in the pendant chain, and a vinyl monomer with an imidazole group in the pendant chain and a print molecule "having a size and structure similar to the ester or amide substrate to be hydrolyzed and which can complex with the metal" ion in an<br><br>
organic solvent, (b)  immobilizing  the  complex on an  inert  support  by<br>
polymerizing  the  vinyl monomer either  thermally  at  a<br>
temperature of 55 to 80 C or in presence of UV light at a<br>
-	o    .<br>
temperature  in the range^of 4 to 40 C with  conventional<br>
crosslinking monomer to obtain polymer.<br>
In our copending application No. 109.5/Del/95 we have described and claimed a process for the conversion of esters and amides into their corresponding alcohols, and amines employing the polymer composition prepared by the process of the  present invention.<br>

The inert atmosphere can be maintained using inert gases such as nitrogen or argon. The polymerization of the complex is carried out on the inner surface of a porous bead.<br>
The inert polymer support used for the immobilization of the complex may be selected from poly (glycidyl methacrylate-ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate), poly (methylmethacrylate - ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate) , poly (styrene-divinylbenzene), poly (trimethylol propane trimethacrylate - glycidyl methacrylate), poly<br><br>

size range of 35-150 u.<br>
The composition is brought in contact with the ester or amide to be hydrolyzed, in a mixed solvent system, at ambient temperature, in the presence or absence of U.V. light so as to bring about hydrolysis of the amide or alcohol till the reaction is complete.<br>
.The hydrolysis of the amide and ester can be carried out in mixed solvent systems comprising ethanol-buffer, acetonitrile-buffer, dioxane-buffer. The composition of the organic solvent in the mixture can be in the range 10% to 50% and a preferable range is from 20% to 40%.

complex .<br>
2.5 gm of this complex was taken in a glass test tube. To it 2 gm 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 0.5 ml ethylene glycol dimethacrylate and 0.8 ml t-butyl hydroperoxide were added. The test tube was purged with nitrogen for 10 minutes and then immersed in a<br><br>
water bath maintained at 65oC. The polymerization was carried out for 16 hours. The polymer was isolated in the form of a cylindrical rod by breaking the test tube, The rod was then cut into discs of 0.09-0.11 cm thickness on a lathe. The yield obtained was 4 gm.<br>
These discs were- dipped into  a 1% ~2,2'  bipyri-<br>
dyl   solution  in methanol  for  12 hours   to  remove<br>
