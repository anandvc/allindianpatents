The present invention relates to a method of binding multiple stacked papers in one set using a non-metallic binding piece and device thereof.<br>
Technical Field of the Invention [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a method for binding papers without utilizing a metallic staple and a device thereof. Background Art [0002]<br>
A simple device called a stapler has mainly been used when binding papers together in rather thin stacks. The stapler device binds papers together into a set by inserting a metallic binding staple formed to have a C-shaped cross section into the papers and that bends after the front ends penetrate in a substantially orthogonal direction.<br>
Patent document 1: JP2002-210675 A<br>
Patent document 2: JP2003-236267 A Disclosure of the Invention Problems to be solved by the Invention [0003]<br>
Although staplers with this structure are widely used, the metallic binding staple causes problems. For example the binding staple remains attached when attempting to shred unwanted papers in a shredder so that the shredder blade is damaged after shearing the metallic binding staple. The troublesome task of removing the binding staple each time is therefore necessary. Moreover, attempting to remove the binding staple might damage fingernails or the binding staple might puncture the finger causing injury. [0004]<br>
The metallic binding staple is also a problem when processing unwanted papers for recycling. This situation has created a strong need for a method for binding paper without using a metallic staple. [0005]<br>
In view of these problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for binding papers without utilizing a<br><br>
metallic staple and device thereof<br>
Means for solving the Problem<br>
[0006]<br>
To achieve the above object, a binding method of the present invention is a method of binding multiple stacked papers in one set using a non-metallic binding piece, including the steps of: using a cutting blade for holding the binding piece by surrounding an outer edge of the binding piece with front and rear side plates for restraining movement perpendicular to a longitudinal direction of the binding piece and left and right side plates for holding both longitudinal ends of the binding piece, and penetrating the multiple stacked papers by using the cutting blade which a part of the cutting blade for forming a C-shaped cutting line on the papers is formed in part of the left and right side plates; curving or bending the papers along the cutting lines in the shearing direction of the cutting blade by the penetration step; and forcing both ends of the binding piece to penetrate the papers by utilizing spaces generated by the curvature or bend.<br>
[0007]<br>
The binding piece is preferably made of paper or plastic. The cutting blade typically comprises a first blade for forming a cutting line perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the binding piece, and a second blade for forming a cutting line extending in the longitudinal direction of the binding piece. Here, the first blade is preferably shaped like a triangular flat plate having pointed front ends.<br>
[0008]<br>
The binding device of the present invention includes the cutting blade used in any of above mentioned methods. Effects of the Invention<br>
The cutting blade  of  the present  invention	is a<br>
cutting blade for a rectangular non-metallic binding	piece<br>
comprising: a rectangular flat top plate having a	short<br>
side    substantially   equal   to   the   short	side<br><br>
of the binding piece and a long side which than the long side of the binding piece; and two pairs of side plates perpendicular to the top plate, wherein, of the two pairs of side plates, one pair of the side plates have first blades for forming cutting lines perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the binding piece, and the other pair of side plates are respectively composed of a short part, and long parts which protrude from both ends of the short part and have second blades for forming cutting lines extending in the longitudinal direction of the binding piece from one of both ends of the cutting lines by the first blades.<br>
Another cutting blade of the present invention is a cutting blade for a rectangular non-metallic binding piece comprising: two pairs of blade parts having one pair of blade parts which have first blades for forming cutting lines perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the binding piece, and the other pair of blade parts which have second blades for forming cutting lines extending in the longitudinal direction of the binding piece from both ends of the cutting lines by the first blades, wherein the two pairs of blade parts are so formed that, when the binding piece is curved or bent, they surround an outer edge of the binding piece to temporarily hold the binding piece.<br>
Yet another cutting blade of the present invention is a cutting blade for a rectangular non-metallic binding piece comprising: a rectangular flat top plate having a short side which is substantially equal to the short side of the binding piece and a long side which is shorter than the long side of the binding piece; and two pairs of side plates perpendicular to the top plate, wherein , of one pair of the two pairs of side plates, only one side plate has a first blade for forming a cutting line perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the binding piece, and the other pair of side plates are respectively composed of a short part and a long part which protrudes from one end of the short part and has a second blade for forming a cutting line extending in the longitudinal direction of the binding piece from one of both ends of the cutting line by the first blade.<br>
Still another cutting blade of the present invention is a cutting blade for a rectangular non-metallic binding piece comprising: a blade part having a first blade for forming a cutting line perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the binding piece; a plate part partially<br><br>
facing the blade part; and a pair of blade parts having second blades for forming cutting lines in the longitudinal direction of the binding piece extending from both ends of the cutting line by the first blade, wherein the blade parts are so formed that, when the binding piece is curved or bent, they surround an outer edge of the binding piece to temporarily hold the binding piece.<br>
Furthermore, the binding device of the present invention is a binding device for a rectangular non-metallic binding piece comprising: a cutting blade provided with a pair of blade parts which have first blades for forming cutting lines perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the binding piece and a pair of blade parts which have second blades for forming cutting lines extending in the longitudinal direction of the binding piece form both ends of the cutting lines by the first blades and a support plate rising and lowering independently from the cutting blade for pressing the binding piece.<br>
[0009]<br>
The invention is capable of binding papers together without utilizing the metallic staple. The binding piece of this invention can be made wider than the metallic staple and can also be prepared in different colors so that documents can be clearly identified by the difference in colors among binding pieces.

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention [0011]<br>
The embodiment of the present invention will next be described below in detail based on the examples.  Figs. 1 and 2 show the structure of the cutting blade 1A for different paper types for implementing this invention.  Fig. 3 is a drawing for describing a method of binding papers by using of the cutting blade 1A. [0012]<br>
The cutting blade 1A shown in the figures is formed of a flat rectangular top plate 2, left and right side plates 3 and front and rear side plates 4, and four side plates 3, 4 extending perpendicular to the top plate 3. The cutting blade 1A cuts one unit 5 of the rectangular binding pieces 5...5 as shown in Fig. 3 (a) along a connection part 5A represented by a broken line and holds the cut binding piece, and then allows both ends 6 of the cut binding piece 5 to penetrate the papers 7 to bind the papers<br>
The arrow in Fig. 3 (a) represents the longitudinal direction of the binding piece.  The examples in Figs. I through Fig. 3, utilize binding highly strong and rigid pieces 5 as well as paper pieces with excellent strength and elasticity, or thin plastic pieces.  Regardless of which material is utilized, the connection part 5A of the binding pieces 5...5 is made extremely thin and so can be easily cut. [0013]<br>
The cutting blade 1A in the figures is connected to a raising and lowering mechanism not shown and during the binding operation, the cutting blade 1A lowers and then rises to the original position. An opening is formed at the center of the top plate 2 of the cutting blade 1A and a flat plate-shaped support plate 9 which is somewhat smaller than the top plate 2 (refer to Fig. 3(b)) is connected to a front end of an elevating shaft 8 penetrating the opening. The support plate 9 rises or lowers independently of the cutting blade 1A according to the rising or lowering of the support plate 9. [0014]<br>
The top plate 2 is shaped like a rectangle corresponding to the shape of the binding piece 5 and has short sides nearly equal to the short sides of the binding piece 5 and long sides smaller than the long sides of the binding piece 5. The binding piece 5 is held by the curving or bending of long sides. (The long sides are curved in Fig. 3(b).) [0015]<br>
The front and rear side plates 4 are each formed of a short part 4a on the base end side and long parts 4b, 4c protruding from both ends of the short part 4a, which form an inverted U. Tapered planes 10, 11 are formed on the inner surfaces on the respective front end sides of the short part 4a and long parts 4b, 4c, to form the cutting blade (refer to Fig. 2(b)). A tapered plane 10 is a part for cutting the connection part 5A of the binding piece 5. The tapered plane 11 is a part for forming cuts in the papers 7 and based on the tapered plane 11, the cutting lines 7a, 7a are formed in the longitudinal direction of the binding piece 5 (refer to Fig. 1 (b) ) .<br>
The left and right side plates 3 each are formed of a main body 3a and a triangular front end 3b.  Two tapered planes 12a, 12b along oblique sides of the triangle are formed on an inner surface of each front end 3b to form the cutting blade (Fig. 2 (b) ) . The two tapered planes 12a, 12b meet together to form an inclined ridge line 13. [0017]<br>
Figs. 3(b) to 3(e) are drawings describing the operating sequence of the cutting blade 1A in Fig. 1.  The papers 7 made up of multiple stacked papers are placed on holding plates 14, 14 and face the cutting blade 1A. [0018]<br>
In this state, the binding pieces 5...5 connected to each other as shown in Fig. 3(a) are sent to the cutting blade 1A in a cross direction in Fig. 1 and, the cutting blade 1A is then lowered together with the support plate 9. The connection part 5A of the binding pieces 5...5 is in this way severed by the tapered planes 10 of the cutting blade 1A in a state where a single binding piece 5 is curved or bent. The binding piece 5 is held by a lower surface of the support plate 9 and inner peripheral surface of the side plates 3a, 4a (Fig. 3 (b) ) . The binding piece 5 might possibly fall, however, since the cutting blade 1A lowers with great force so the binding piece 5 never actually falls. [0019]<br>
When the cutting blade 1A is lowered in this manner, the front ends 3a of the left and right side plates of the cutting blade 1A stick into the papers 7 and the tapered planes 12a, 12b form straight cutting lines 7b on the papers 7 (Fig. l(b)). Although these cutting lines 7b extend as the cutting blade 1A lowers, when the cutting blade 1A lowers further, the tapered planes 11 of the front and rear side plates 4 form other cutting lines 7a perpendicular to the cutting lines 7b. Both ends 7c of the papers 7 located on the inner side of the cutting lines 7b are pressed down (Fig. 3 (c) ) as the cutting lines 7a are formed. The binding piece 5 in this way passes through the cutting lines 7b on the papers.<br><br>
The cutting blade IA is then raised. At this time, the support plate 9 is pressed downwards and time, the holding plates 14, 14 are at the same time pressed upwards (Fig. 3 (d) ) . The binding piece 5 therefore extends from side to side due to the elasticity and rigidity of the binding piece 5 and so that a document made up of multiple of sheets is bound by the binding piece 5 (Fig. 3(e)). [0021]<br>
Although the papers are bound only due to the elasticity and rigidity of the binding piece 5 in the above description, the pressure receiving plates 15, 15 as well as the holding plates 14, 14 are preferably disposed on the lower side of the papers as shown in Fig. 4(b) in order to make the attachment surface of the binding piece 5 flatter in order to enhance the appearance.  In this example, since the papers and binding piece 5 are pressed by the support plate 9 and pressure receiving plates 15, the binding piece 5 is reliably deformed to possess a C-shaped cross section.  The lower surface of the papers 7 is also made flat (Fig. 4(e)) by moving the pressure receiving plates 15, 15 outwards in the final stage. [0022]<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, adhesive or bonding (hereafter, collectively referred to as adhesive) is preferably applied to a lower surface 5B of the binding piece 5 of somewhat weak elasticity and rigidity, and the binding piece 5 then bent and adhered or glued (hereafter, collectively referred to as adhered) to the papers. [0023]<br>
Fig. 5 shows the operation when the adhesive is applied to the lower surface 5B of the binding piece 5.  Although the operational content is generally same as these in Fig. 3, in this example, the holding plates 14, 14 are finally moved toward the inside and the binding piece 5 is folded back to depress the (adhesive) coated surface (Fig. 5(d)).  The folded binding piece 5 is in this way adhered to the lower surface of the papers 7 so that the papers are reliably bound together (Fig. 5 (e) ) ) . [0024]<br>
Fig. 6 is a drawing further showing another cutting blade IB.<br>
his example, one of the left and right side plates 3, 3 in Fig. I as well as the support plate 9 are omitted. In other words, the cutting blade IB has a rectangular top plate 2, L-shaped front and rear side plates 16, 16, a left side plate 17 and a right side plate 18. The front and rear side plates 16 are each formed of a short part 16a on the base end side and a long part 16b protruding from one end of the short part 16a which are in the shape of L, and the tapered planes 10, 11 are respectively formed at a front end of the short part 16a and a front end of the long part 16b. The left side plate 17 has the same structure as the left and right side plates 3 in Fig. 1 and the right side plate 18 is a rectangular plate and serves to lock the base end 6b of the binding piece 5. [0025]<br>
Fig. 7 is a drawing showing operation of the cutting blade IB shown in Fig. 6. In this example, in addition to the holding plates 14, 14 for holding the lower surface of the papers 7, a sliding plate 19 is provided for sliding an upper surface of the papers 7. After the front end 6a of the binding piece 5 passes a cutting line by lowering the cutting blade IB (Fig. 7(b)), a right side holding plate 14a is first of all moved to the left to flatten the bent papers 7 (Ml in Fig. 7 (c) ) . [0026]<br>
Next, the left side holding plate 14 is moved to right (M2 in Fig. 7(c)) and a short time later the sliding plate 19 is also moved to right (M3 in Fig. 7(c)). Due to the right movement of the left side holding plate 14, the binding piece 5 is slightly caught, and by then moving the sliding plate 19 to the right, the binding piece is reliably bent to bind the papers (Fig. 7 (d) ) . The adhesive may also be applied to the lower surface 5B of the binding piece 5 in this example. [0027]<br>
Fig. 8 is a perspective view showing another cutting blade 1C. A feature of this example is that the cutting blade 1C is used from the lower surface toward the upper surface of the papers 7. The cutting blade 1C is formed of a flat plate-like top plate 2, left and right side plates 3, 3, and front and rear side plates<br>
4 and unlike the cutting blade in Fig. 1 is provided with rectangular openings 20 on the left and right side plates 3, 3. The front and rear side plates 4, 4 possess no short part on the base end side and are provided with only the long parts 4b, 4c. Therefore, even through there is a tapered plane 11, there is no tapered plane 10 for cutting the binding pieces 5...5. [0028]<br>
Fig. 9 is a drawing describing the operating states of the cutting blade 1C. In this example, prior to the operation of the cutting blade 1C, a step for making one binding piece 5 unit and a step of pressing the binding piece 5 onto the upper surface of the papers 7 are required. To implement these steps, a pressing plate 21 and upper holding plates 22, 22 are disposed on the upper surface of the papers 7 (Fig. 9 (a) ) . [0029]<br>
In the state shown in Fig. 9 (a) , the cutting blade 1C is moved from the lower surface toward the upper surface of the papers 7 (Figs. 9(b) to 9(c)). After the cutting blade 1C forms a cutting line in the papers and then penetrates the papers 7, both ends 6, 6 of the binding piece 5 pass through the opening 20 (Fig. 9(c)). Then, when the cutting blade 1C is lowered, both ends 6, 6 of the binding piece 5 are guided through the opening 20 of the cutting blade 1C to move to the lower surface of the papers 7 (Fig. 9(d) ) . By then moving the left and right holding plates 14, 14 to the inside, both ends of the binding piece 5 are folded back to in this way reliably bind the papers (Fig. 9 (e) ) . Adhesive may also be applied to the lower surface 5B of the binding piece 5 in this example. [0030]<br>
Fig. 10 is a perspective view showing another cutting blade ID. Although the cutting blade ID has the same structure as the cutting blade 1A shown in Fig. 1, the inner faces of the front ends of the left and right side plates 3, 3 are formed in a cutting edge shape 19 having a triangular cross section. The cutting edge shapes 19 each are formed from a ridge line 19a, a front end line 19b and a base end line 19c so as to have a triangular cross section, the front end lines 19b, 19b form a first cutting line 7b on the papers,<br>
the oblique lines 19d of the triangular cross section form a second cutting line la. [0031]<br>
Figs. 11 (a) to 11 (d) are drawings showing the operating states of the cutting blade ID and correspond to Figs. 3(b) to 3(e). A guide member 23 for guiding the raising and lowering of the cutting blade ID is shown in Fig. 11, and needless to say, the guide member 23 is also provided for other examples. In this example, since the cutting edge shape 19 functions to prevent the binding piece 5from slipping, the binding piece 5 will never fall even when the speed of the cutting blade ID is slow or there is little friction between both ends 6, 6 of the binding piece 5 and the inner surface of the cutting blade. [0032]<br>
Although examples of the present invention have been specifically described, the present invention is not limited to these specific descriptions.  For example, in the above mentioned figures, the binding piece 5 is curved in an arch shape, however, a bent section may also be preferably formed on the binding piece 5 so as to have a U-shaped cross section. [0033]<br>
Although each cutting blade forms a substantially C-shaped cutting line, the present invention is not limited to this.  A substantially arc-shape cutting line may also of course be formed. Also in this case, an arc shaped like a right parentheses mark "(" and an arc shaped like a right parentheses mark") " may also be formed at both ends of the binding piece so as to face opposite each other, or only one of the arcs may be formed.  When the substantially arc-shaped cutting line is formed, both ends of the binding piece are preferably formed in an arc shape. [0034]<br>
A microcapsule adhesive which exhibits adhesive force only after particles are destructed due to pressure may also be used as the adhesive. Industrial Applicability [0035]<br>
The present invention provides a method for binding papers without utilizing any metallic staple and device thereof, and the binding piece such as of paper can be made larger than the metallic staple in width and prepared in different colors, so that each paper can be clearly identified by its unique color from among other bound papers .<br><br><br><br><br>
