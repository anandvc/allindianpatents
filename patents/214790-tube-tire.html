BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a tube tire including a tire mounted around the outer periphery of a rim and a tube contained in a space defined by the rim and the tire.<br>
Description of Background Art<br>
Tube tires, making use of the excellent airtightness of tubes, are generally mounted on wheels with wire spokes which are extensively used for motorcycles or bicycles.<br>
When a radial load is applied to a wheel mounted with a tube tire, the tire and the tube are deformed by the load, and in some cases, particularly in the case where the tire rides over a rigid obstacle such as a rock or the vehicle is jumped and grounded upon off-road operation, there occurs a rim striking phenomenon in which the tube is forcibly clamped between the largely deformed tire and a metal made rim and thereby opposing areas of the inner wall surface of the tube are brought in press-contact with each other. When the opposing areas of the inner wall surface of the tube are brought in press-contact with each other by such a rim striking phenomenon, there often occurs a so called shock puncture in which the press-contact portion is pierced. In particular, as the opposing areas of the wall surface of the tube are in<br><br>
presa-contact with each other, a portion near the rim (hereinafter, referred to as "a rim striking portion") is applied with a local load from the metal rim.<br>
A tube tire to avoid such an inconvenience has been proposed in Japanese Patent La id-open No. Hei_5--2 01213, in which a damper formed in a crescent-shape in cross suction is interposed between the inner surface of a tread portion of the tire and the outer surface of the tube for preventing damage to the tube due to the rim striking phenomenon by the damper.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
A rim R, to be mounted on a wheel used for a motorcycle, is connected to a hub (not shown) via wire spokes S.  A tube tire T composed of a tire 1 and a tube 2 contained in the tire 1 is mounted on the rim R. The tube 2 has a peripheral wall 4 formed in an annular shape in cross-section, and the peripheral wall 4 is composed of an air chamber side peripheral wall 4i positioned radially inwardly and a sealant chamber side peripheral wall 4o positioned radially outwardly.   A pair of connection portions for connecting the air chamber side peripheral wall 4i of the peripheral wall 4 to the sealant chamber side peripheral wall 4O thereof are connected to each other by a bulkhead 5 formed integrally therewith. A pair of double wall portions 4d, 4d, each being formed in a hollow shape, are provided at rim striking portions of the air chamber side peripheral wall 4i, that is, portions of the air chamber side peripheral wall 4i to be brought in press-contact with the rim R while putting the tire 1<br><br>
therebetween when a radial load is applied to the tire 1. An air chamber 3 formed in an approximately circular shape in cross section, which is defined by the air chamber side peripheral wall 4i and the bulkhead 5, is filled with air. A sealant chamber 7, formed in an approximately arcuate shape in cross section, is defined by the sealant chamber side peripheral wall 4o and the bulkhead 5 and is filled with a known liquid sealant. Each of the internal spaces of a pair of the double wall portions 4d, 4d is also filled with a known liquid sealant.<br>
The rim R includes an annular rim main body 11 extending in the circumferential direction of the tube tire T and a pair of flange portions 12, 12 extending radially outwardly from both the radial ends of the rim main body 11 and holding the inner periphery of the tire 1. An air valve 6 for filling the air chamber 3 with air is formed in the tube 2 and passes through an air valve mounting portion 13 formed at a position in the circumferential direction of the rim main body 11 and is fixed by nuts 14, 15.<br>
Since the sealant chamber 7 of the tube 2 is held in a shape following the inner surface of the tire 1 by air pressure within the air chamber 3, the sealant 8 filled in the sealant chamber 7 can be prevented from being shifted on the outer peripheral side of the tube 2 even when the sealant 8 is applied with a centrifugal force due to the rotation of the wheel. Accordingly, even when the tube 2 is pierced with a nail or the like in the radial or sideward direction, the pieced portion is immediately buried with the sealant 8 to be thus repaired, so that it is possible to retard the leakage of air from the air chamber 3. Additionally, since the sealant 8 is held in the sealant chamber 7 and is not allowed to flow on the air chamber 3 side, it does not block the air valve 6 or a pressure gauge touched with the air valve 6.<br><br>
Next, a process of manufacturing the tube 2 will be described.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the tube 2 is manufactured in accordance with manufacturing steps including a material kneading step, a tube material extrusion molding step, a cutting step, an air valve mounting step, a piecing step, a joining step, a first vulcanizing step, a sealant filling step, a raw rubber sheet sticking step, a second vulcanizing step, and an inspection step.<br>
First, a raw rubber is kneaded at the material kneading step and is extrusion-molded at the tube material extrusion molding step, to form a tube material 2' made of the raw rubber. The tube material 2' is continuously<br>
«<br>
extrusion-molded from a nozzle of an extrusion molding machine and includes a peripheral wall 4 formed in a circular shape in a transverse cross section and a bulkhead 5 connecting two points positioned along the diameter of the peripheral wall 4. The peripheral wall 4 is divided into an air chamber side peripheral wall 4i and a sealant chamber side peripheral wall 4o with respect to the portions connected to the bulkhead 5, and a pair of double wall portions 4d, 4d are integrally formed on the air chamber side peripheral wall 4i.<br>
The tube material 2' is cut into a specified length at the subsequent cutting step, and an air valve 6 is mounted at a suitable position of the air chamber side peripheral wall 4i at the air valve mounting step. And, at the piercing step, the sealant chamber side peripheral wall 4o of the tube material 2' and the outer walls of the double wall portions 4d, 4d are pierced to form sealant filling holes 41, ..., 4,.<br>
Both the end portions of the tube material 2' are joined to each other at the subsequent joining step, and at the first vulcanizing step, the tube material 2' is inserted in a heating die, and the air chamber side peripheral wall 4i and the sealant chamber side peripheral<br><br>
chamber 4o are brought in close-contact with the heating die and the bulkhead 5 is also brought in close-contact with the sealant chamber side peripheral wall 4o by supplying a heated air or a high temperature steam into the air chamber 3 from the air valve 6. In such a state, vulcanization is performed by heating the heating die.<br>
At the subsequent sealant filling step, the sealant<br>
-I<br>
8 is supplied from the sealant filling holes 41, ..., 41 to fill the sealant chamber 7 and the internal spaces of the double wall portions 4d, 4d. At this time, by expanding the air chamber 3 by the supply of air from the air valve 6 prior to the filling of the sealant 8, the bulkhead 5 is brought in close-contact with the sealant chamber side peripheral wall 4o to perfectly discharge the air in the sealant chamber 7 and the inner walls of the double wall portions 4d, 4d are brought in close-contact with the outer walls thereof to perfectly discharge the air in the internal spaces thereof. In such a state, the filling of the sealant 8 is started. The starting of the filling of the sealant 8 in the state that the air in the sealant chamber 7 and the internal spaces of the double wall portions 4d, 4d is perfectly discharged, it is possible to effectively prevent the entrapment of the air in the sealant 8 and hence to fill the sealant chamber 7 and the internal spaces of the double wall portions 4d, 4d with only the sealant 8. Additionally,  since the air is supplied into the air chamber 3 using the air valve 6, it is possible to eliminate the need for the provision of an air filling hole in the air chamber side peripheral wall 4i.<br>
A raw rubber sheet 19 is stuck on the .peripheral wall 4 so as to cover the sealant filling holes 41, ..., 41 at the raw rubber sheet sticking step, and then the sealant filling holes 41, ..., 4, are blocked by local vulcanization of the vicinity of the raw rubber sheet 19 at the second vulcanization step, to finish the tube 2.<br><br>
Since the sealant filling holes 41, ..., 41 are blocked using the raw rubber sheet 19 being the same material as that of the tube material 2 ' , it is possible to improve the strength of the blocking portion,  and hence to effectively prevent the leakage of the sealant 8. Thus, the finished tube 2 is inspected at the inspection step, to complete the manufacturing steps.<br>
-i<br>
Next, the function of the first embodiment will be described. As shown in Fig. 3, when the tube tire T rides over an obstacle 20 on a road surface and is applied with a shock load, part of the tire 1 and the tube 2 are compressed in the radial direction by the load. At this time, the tire 1 and the tube 2 are clamped between the flange portions 12, 12 of the rim R projecting radially outwardly and the obstacle 20,  so that the opposing portions of the inner wall surface of the tube 2 are brought in press-contact with each other. However, since the rim striking portions of the tube 2 , which are most susceptible to damages, are provided with the double wall portions 4d, 4d, the thickness of the tube 2 is increased at these portions. This makes it possible to effectively prevent damage of the tube 2 due to the rim striking phenomenon.<br>
Furthermore, since the internal spaces of the double wall portions 4d, 4d are filled with the sealant 8, they are compressed in the vicinity of the ground portion of the tire 1, it is possible to further effectively prevent damage of the tube 2 due the rim striking phenomenon by a shock absorbing effect of the sealant 8 generated when it is moved upwardly. Additionally, even if the double wall portions 4d, 4d are damaged by the rim striking<br>
phenomenon, the sealant 8 filled in the internal spaces acts to bury the damaged portion so as to repair it, thereby retarding the leakage of the air from the air chamber 3 .<br>
Accordingly, with a simple structure in which the<br><br>
double wall portions 4d, 4d are formed at the rim striking portions of the tube 2 and the internal spaces thereof are filled with the sealant 8, it is possible to avoid the generation of the shock puncture, without a large increase in weight as well as a large increase in manufacturing cost of the tube tire T.<br>
A second embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Fig. 4. In a tube 2 in the second embodiment, each of double wall portions 4d, 4d is a simple double layer having no internal spaces and not being filled with a sealant B. According to this embodiment, the effect of preventing damage of the tube 2 by the sealant 8 cannot be obtained. However, since the thickness of the tube 2 is increased at the double wall portions 4d, 4d, it is possible to prevent damage of the tube 2 due to the rim striking phenomenon. Also, if the thickness of the rim striking portion is simply increased, the step portion where the thickness is changed receives stress concentration and is easily cracked. However, in this embodiment, since the rim striking portions are provided with the double wall portions 4d, 4d, the outer and inner walls of the double wall portions 4d are relatively movable and are thereby increased in flexibility, so that it is possible to relax the stress concentration, and hence to prevent the generation of cracking.<br>
A third embodiment: will be described with, reference to Fig. 5. In a tube 2 in the third embodiment, raw rubber sheets 21, 21 are each joined on the outer surfaces of the rim striking portions of the tube 2, to form double wall portions 4d. The raw rubber sheets 21, 21 are each joined on the tube?. prior to the first vulcanization step of -the manufacturing steps shown in Fig., 2, that is, when the tube material 2' is in a raw rubber state, and are integrated with the tube material 2' at the first vulcanization step. In the third embodiment, the rim<br><br>
striking portions of the tube 2 are reinforced by the raw rubber sheets 21, 21, so that it is possible to effectively prevent the generation of shock puncture. Furthermore, the double wall portions 4d, 4d can be simply provided only by sticking the raw rubber sheets 21, 21 on the existing tube 2.<br>
For example, in the embodiments, the tube 2 having the sealant chamber 7 filled with the sealant 8 has been exemplified. However, the present invention is applicable to the tube 2 without any sealant chamber 7.<br>
According to the present invention, since double wall portions are provided at rim striking portions of a tube, which are brought in press-contact with a rim while putting a tire therebetween when a radial load is applied to the tire, it is possible to effectively prevent damage and thereby the puncture of the tube which is forcibly clamped between the tire applied with a large lead and the rim. If the tube is damaged, since the boundary between the double wall portions is cracked, the possibility of breakage of 'the air chamber side peripheral wall can be reduced. Furthermore, such effect can be obtained with a simple structure in which only the double wall portions are formed at parts of the tube, to thereby suppress an increase in weight as well as in manufacturing cost as compared with the conventional tube.<br>
According to the present invention, since each of the double wall portions is a hollow structure, it is possible to relax the stress concentration by the increased flexibility of the double wall portions, and hence to further effectively prevent damage to the tube.<br>
According to the present invention, since the internal spaces of the double wall portions are filled with a sealant, if the double wall portions are damaged the damaged portion is repaired with the sealant, resulting in the increased durability of the tube.<br>
According to the present invention, since the double<br><br>
wall portions are each formed by . sticking raw rubber sheets on the outer surface of the tube, it is possible to enhance the strength of the tube by the double wall portions and prevent the generation of shock puncture, and to provide the double wall portions with a simple structure in which only the rubber sheet is stuck on the existing tube.<br>
Hereinafter, a fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs, .6-8.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, a rim R to be mounted on a wheel used for a motorcycle is connected to a hub (not shown) via wire spokes S. A tube tire T composed of a tire 101 and a tube 102 contained in the tire 101 is mounted on the rim R. The tube 102 has a peripheral wall 104 formed in an annular shape in cross section The peripheral wall 104 is composed of an outer peripheral wall 104o positioned radially outward and an inner peripheral wall 104i positioned radially inward. A pair of connection portions for connecting the outer peripheral wall l04o to the inner peripheral wall 104i are connected to each other by an outer bulkhead 105o and an inner bulkhead 105i formed integrally therewith.<br>
An air chamber 103 filled with air is formed into an approximately circular shape in cross section and defined between the outer bulkhead 105o and the inner bulkhead 105i, An outer sealant chamber 107o is formed into an approximately arcuate shape in cross section and is defined between the outer peripheral wall 104o and the outer bulkhead 105o. An inner sealant chamber 107i is formed into an approximately arcuate shape in cross section and is defined between the inner peripheral wall 104i and the inner bulkhead 1051. Each of the sealant chambers 107o, 107i is filled with a known liquid sealant 108.<br>
The rim R includes an annular rim main body 111<br><br>
extending in the circumferential, direction of the tube tire T and a pair of flange portions 112, 112 extending radially outwardly from both the radial ends of the rim main body lll for holding the inner periphery of the tire 101. The base portion of an air valve 106 for filling the air chamber 103 with air is formed in the tube 102 and is supported on a raw rubber made air valve mounting portion 116 joined to pass through the inner peripheral wall 104i and the innor bulkhead 105i. The air valve 106 passes through the air valve mounting partion 116 formed at a position in the circumferential direction of the rim main body 111 and is fixed by nuts 114, 115.<br>
Since the outer sealant chamber 107o and the inner sealant chamber 107 i of the tube 102 are held in shapes following the inner surface of the tire 101 by the air pressure of the air chamber 103, the sealant 108 filled in each of the outer and inner sealant chambers 107o, 107i can be prevented from being shifted on. the outer peripheral side of the tube 102 even when the sealant 108 is applied with a centrifugal force due to the rotation of the wheel. As a result, even when the tube 102 is pierced with a nail or the like, the pieced portion is immediately buried with the sealant 108 to be thus repaired, so that the leakage of air from the air chamber 103 can be retarded. Further, since the outer and inner sealant chambers 107o, 107 i cover not only the outer peripheral side but also the inner peripheral side of the tube 102, even when any portion of the tube 102 is pierced, the pierced portion can be repaired with the sealant 108. In addition, .since the sealant 108 is held in both the sealant chambers 107o, 107i and is not allowed to flow on the air chamber 103 side, it does not block the air valve 106 or a pressure gauge in contact with the air valve 106.<br>
Next, a process of manufacturing the tube 102 will be described. As shown in Fig. 7, the tube 102 is manufactured in accordance with manufacturing steps<br><br>
including a material kneading Btep, a tubo material extrusion molding step, a cutting step, an air valve mounting step, a piecing step, a joining step, a first vulcanizing step, a sealant filling step, a raw rubber sheet sticking step, a second vulcanizing step, and an inspection step.<br>
First, a.raw rubber kneaded at the material kneading step is extrusion-molded at the tube material extrusion molding step, to form a tube material 102' made of the raw rubber. The tube material 102' is continuously extrusion-molded from a nozzle of an extrusion molding machine includes a peripheral wall 104 formed in a circular shape in transverse cross section and an outer bulkhead 105o and an inner bulkhead 105i connecting two points positioned along the diameter of the peripheral wall 104. The peripheral wall 104 is divided into an outer peripheral wall 104o and an inner peripheral wall 104i with respect to the portions connected.to both the bulkheads 105o, 105i. The tube material 102' having a complex sectional shape can be easily manufactured by such extrusion molding.<br>
The tuba material 102' is cut into a specified length during a subsequent cutting step, and a raw rubber made air valve mounting portion 116 covering the base portion of an air valve 106 is joined in such a manner as to pass through the inner peripheral wall 104i and the outer peripheral wall 105i at the air valve mounting step. At the piercing step, the outer peripheral wall 104o and the inner peripheral wall 104i of the tube material 102' are pierced to form sealant filling holes 1041, ..., 104r<br>
Both the end portions of the tube material 102' are joined to each other by a splicer at the subsequent joining step, and at the first vulcanizing step, the tube material 102' is inserted in a heating die, and the outer and the inner peripheral walls 104o, 104i are brought in close-contact with the heating die and the outer and inner<br><br>
bulkheads 105o, 1051 are respectively brought in close-contact with the outer and inner peripheral walls 1040, 104i by supplying a heated air or a high temperature steam into the air chamber 103 from the air valve 106. In such a state, vulcanization is performed by heating the heating die.. At this time, the rubber made air valve mounting portion 116 covering the base portion of the air valve 106 is perfectly integrated with the tube material<br>
102'.<br>
At the subsequent sealant filling step, the sealant 108 is supplied from the sealant filling holes 1041, ..., 1041 to fill the outer and inner sealant chambers 107o, 107i. At this time, by expanding the air chamber 103 by supply of an air from the air valve 106 prior—to the filling of the sealant 108, the outer and inner bulkheads 105o, 105i are respectively brought in close-contact with the outer and inner peripheral walls 104o,, 104i to perfectly discharge the air in the outer and inner sealant chambers 107o, 107i. In such a state, the filling of the sealant 108 is started. The starting of the filling of the sealant 108 in the state that the air in both the sealant chambers 107o, 1071 is perfectly discharged, it is possible to effectively prevent the entrapment of the air in the sealant 108 and hence to fill the sealant chambers 107o, 107i with only the sealant .108. In addition, since the air is supplied into the air chamber 103 using the air valve 106, it is possible to eliminate the need of the provision of an air filling hole in the outer and inner peripheral walls 104o, 104i.<br>
Raw rubber sheets 119, 119. are stuck on the peripheral wall 104 so as to cover the sealant filling holes 1041, ..., 104, at the raw rubber sheet sticking step, and then the sealant filling holes 1041, ..., 104, are blocked by local vulcanization of the vicinity of the raw rubber sheets 119, 119 at the second vulcanization step, to finish the tube 102. Since the sealant filling<br><br>
holes 104,, ..., 104, are blocked using the raw rubber sheets 119, 119 being the same material as that of the tube material 102', it is possible to improve the strength of the blocking portion, and hence to effectively prevent the leakage of the sealant 108. Thus, the finished tube 102 is inspected at the inspection step, to complete the manufacturing steps.<br>
Next, the function of the fourth embodiment will be described. As shown in Fig. 8, when the tube tire T rides over an obstacle 120 on a road surface and is applied with a shock load, part of the tire 101 and the tube 102 are compressed in the radial direction by the load. At this time, the tire 101 and the tube 102 are clamped between the flange portions 112, 112 of the rim R projecting radially outwardly from the obstacle 120, so that the opposing portions of the inner wall surface of the tube 102 are brought in press-contact with each other. However, since the tube 102, clamped by the tire 101, has a sufficient wall thickness and elasticity due to the four-layeredf structure of the outer peripheral wall 104o, outer bulkhead 105o, inner bulkhead 1051 and inner peripheral wall 1041, so that it is possible to effectively prevent damages of the tube 102 due to the rim striking the obstacle 120.<br>
Further, when the outer and inner sealant chambers 107o, 107i filled with the sealant 108 are compressed in the vicinity of the ground portion of the tire 101, the sealant 108 exhibits a shock absorbing effect while moving upwardly within the tube 102, to thereby further effectively prevent damages of the tube 102 due to rim striking. Additionally, even if the tube 102 is damaged by rim striking, the damaged portion is repaired by the sealant 108 filled in the outer and inner sealant chaimbers 107o, 107i, so that the leakage of the air from the air chamber 103can be prevented.<br>
Accordingly, with such a simple structure in which<br><br>
the outer and inner sealant chambers 107o, I07i are formed in the tube 102 and filled with the sealant 108, it is possible to avoid the generation of a shock puncture, without the largely increased weight as well an the largely increased manufacturing cost of the tube tire T.<br>
According to the present invention, since the outer and inner sealant chambers filled with the sealant are defined so as to cover the entire circumference of the tube, even when any portion of the tube is pierced, the pierced portion can be repaired with the sealant to prevent the leakage of air. Also, in the case where the tube is forcibly clamped by the tire applied with a large load and the rim, since the tube has a sufficient wall thickness and elasticity by the four layered structure of the outer peripheral wall, outer bulkhead, inner bulkhead, and inner peripheral wall, so that it is possible to effectively prevent damages of the tube 102 due to rim striking. Even if the tube is damaged by rim striking, the damaged portion can be repaired with the sealant. In addition, the simple structure, in which the outer and inner sealant chambers are formed in the tube and are filled with 'the sealant, does not Increase the weight and the manufacturing cost.<br>
According to the present invention, since the tube integrally including the outer and inner peripheral walls and the outer and inner bulkheads are formed by extrusion molding, it is possible to easily manufacture the tube.<br>
A fifth embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in Figs. 9 to 11 wherein a tube tire T composed of a tire 201 and a tube 202 contained in the tire 201 is mounted on a rim R of a wheel for a motorcycle. The tube 202 has a peripheral wall 204 formed in an annular shape in cross section, and the peripheral wall 204 is composed of an air chamber side peripheral wall 2041 positioned radially inwardly and a sealant chamber side peripheral wall 204o positioned radially<br><br>
outwardly. A pair of connection portions for connecting the air chamber side peripheral wall 2041 of the peripheral wall 204 to the sealant chamber side peripheral wall 204o thereof are connected to each other by a bulkhead 205 formed integrally therewith. An air chamber 203, formed into an approximately circular shape in cross section and defined between the air chamber side peripheral will 2041 and the bulkhead 205, is filled with air. A uealant chamber 207 is formed into an approximately arcuate shape in cross section and defined between the nealant chamber side peripheral wall 204o and the bulkhead 206 is filled with a known liquid sealant 206.<br>
The rim R includes an annular rim main body 211 extending in the circumferential direction of the tube tire T and a pair of flange portions 212, 212 extending radially outwardly from both the radial ends of the rim main body 211 and holding the inner periphery, of the tire 201. An air valve 206 for filling the air chamber 203 with air is formed in the tube 202 and passes through an air .valve mounting portion 213 formed at a position in the circumferential direction of the rim main body 211 and is fixed by nuts 214, 215.<br>
A mousse 216 made of rubber foam or the like is interposed between the inner surface of the tire 201 and the outer surface of the tube 202. The mousse 216 mounted in the tire 201 is opened at a portion opposed to the rim main body 211, and the tube 202 is mounted in the mousse 216 through the opening portion. The mousse 216 is formed to be thin at a portion corresponding to a trend surface of the tire 201 and to be thick at the remaining portion, that is, a portion applied with a large load by rim striking.<br>
Since the sealant chamber 207 of the tube 202 is held in a shape following the inner surface of the tire 201 by an air pressure of the air chamber 203, the stialant: 208<br><br>
circular shape in traniiverse cross section and a bulkhead 205 connecting two points positioned along the diameter of the peripheral wall 204. The peripheral wall 204 is divided into an air chamber side peripheral wall 204i and a sealant chamber side peripheral wall 204o with respect to the portions connected to the bulkhead 205.<br>
The tube material 202' is cut into a specified length at the subsequent cutting step, and an air valve 206 is mounted at a suitable position on the air chamber side peripheral wall 204i at the air valve mounting step. At the piercing step, the sealant chamber side peripheral wall 204o of the tube material 202' is pierced to form sealant filling holes 2041, ..., 2041<br>
Both the end portions of the tube material 202' are joined to each other at the subsequent joining step, and at the first vulcanizing step, the tube material 202' is inserted in a heating die, and the air chamber side peripheral wall 204i and the sealant chamber side peripheral chamber 204o are brought in close contact with the heating'die and the bulkhead 205 is also brought in close contact with the sealant chamber side peripheral wall 204o by supplying a heated air or a high temperature steam into the air chamber 203 from the air valve 206. In such a state, vulcanisation is performed by heating the heating die.<br>
At the subsequent sealant filling step, the soalant 8 is supplied from the sealant filling holes 204 ..., 204, to fill the sealant chamber 207. At this time, by expanding the air chamber 203 by a supply of from the air valve 206 prior to the filling of the sealant 208, the bulkhead 205 is brought in close-contact with the sealant chamber side peripheral wall 204o to perfectly discharge the air in the sealant chamber 207. In such a state, the filling of the sealant 208 is started. The starting of the filling of the sealant 208 in the state wherein the air in the sealant chamber 207 is perfectly discharged, it<br><br>
filled in the sealant chamber 207 can be prevented from being shifted on the outer peripheral side of the tube 202 even when the sealant 208 is applied with a centrifugal force due to the rotation of the wheel. Also, if the tire 201 is pierced with a nail or the like, the leading end of the nail or the like does not easily reach the tube 202 by the presence of the mousse 216, to reduce the possibility that the tube 202 is damaged by the nail or the like. Even when the tube 202 is pierced with a nail or the like in the radial or sideward direction, the pieced portion is immediately buried with the sealant 208 to be thus repaired, so that the leakage of air from the air chamber 203 can be retarded. If the air in the air chamber 203 leaks due to puncture of the tube 202, since the shape of the tire 201 can be kept somewhat by the rigidity of the mousse 216, the operation of the vehicle can be continued until a repair shop is located.<br>
Additionally, since the sealant 208 is held in the sealant chamber 207 and is not allowed to flow on the air chamber 203 'side, it does not block the air valve 206 or a pressure gauge connected to the air valve 206.<br>
A process of manufacturing the tube 202 will be described. As shown in Fig. 10, the tube 202 is manufactured in accordance with manufacturing steps including a material kneading step, a tube material extrusion molding step, a cutting step, an air valve mounting step, a piecing step, a joining step, a first vulcanizing step, a sealant filling step, a raw rubber sheet sticking step, a second vulcanizing stop, and an inspection step.<br>
First, a raw rubber kneaded at the material kneading step is extrusion-molded at the tube material extrusion molding step, to form a tube material 202' made of the raw rubber. The tube material 202' is continuously extrusion-molded from a nozzle of an extrusion molding machine and includes a peripheral wall 204 formed in a<br><br>
12 (a) shows a state in which the tube 202 is mounted in the tire 201 and the air chamber 203 is not yet filled with air, that is, a tube free state in which the tube 202 is not expanded. In such a state, a gap is present between the outer surface of the tube 202 and the inner surface of the tire 201. Fig. 12 (b) shows a tube expanded state in which the air chamber 203 of the tube 202 is filled with an air through the air valve 206. In such a state, the outer surface of the tube 202 is brought in close-contact with the inner surface of the tire 201 by expansion of the air chamber 203, with a result that the gap disappears.<br>
incidentally, when the tube 202 in the tube free state is inserted from the opening of the tire 201, if the tube 202 is a small-size, it can be easily inserted. However, with respect to such a small-size tube 202, a sectional expansion ratio R of the tube 202 is required to be set at a large value for the purpose of bringing the outer surface of the tube 202 in close-contact with the inner surface of the tire 201 by expanding the tube 202 in the tire 201. The sectional expansion ratio R is given by an equation of R - B/A, where A 10 a cross section of the tube 202 in the tube free state [area of a hatching portion in Fig. 12(a)], and B is a cross section of the tube 202 in the tube expanded state [area B of a hatching portion in Pig. 12(b)].<br>
When the sectional expansion ratio R is set at a large value as described above, the tension of the bulkhead 205 of the tube 202 becomes larger upon expansion of the tube 202, and the bulkhead 205 is applied with loads which are directed toward the tube free state by its elasticity as shown by arrows f of Fig. 12(b).<br>
As shown in Fig. 12(c), in the case where the sealant chamber 207 is pierced at two positions a, b by nails or the like penetrating the tire 201 and the tube 202, if the wheel is in a rotating state, the bulkhead 205 is biased<br><br>
is possible to effectively prevent the entrapment of the air in the sealant 208 and hence to fill the sealant chamber 207 with only the sealant 208. Additionally, since the air is supplied into the air chamber 203 using the air valve 206, it is possible to eliminate the need for the provision of an air filling hole in the air chamber side peripheral wall 204i,<br>
A raw rubber sheet 219 is stuck on the peripheral wall 204 so as to cover the sealant filling holes 2041, ..., 2041 at the raw rubber sheet sticking step, and then the sealant filling holes 2041, ..., 2041, are blocked by local vulcanization of the vicinity of the raw rubber sheet 219 at the second vulcanization step, to finiah the tube 202. Since the sealant filling holes 204,, ..., 204, are blocked using the raw rubber sheet 219 being the same material as that of the tube material 202', it is possible to improve the strength of the blocking portion, and hence to effectively prevent the leakage of the sealant 208. Thus, the finished tube 202 is inspected at the inspection step, to complete the manufacturing steps.<br>
Next, the function of the embodiment will be described. As shown in Fig. 11, when the tube tire T rides over an obstacle 220 on a road surface and is applied with a shock load, part of the tire 201 and the tube 202 are: compressed in the radial direction by the load. At this time, the tire 201 and the tube 202 are clamped between the flange portions 212, 212 of the rim R projecting radially outward and the obstacle 220. However, since the elastic mousse 216 is interposed between the tire 201 and the tube 202, the load applied to the tube 202 is dispersed and reduced, to thereby effectively prevent damage of the tube 202 due to rim striking.<br>
Figs. 12(a) to 12(c) are views illustrating the function of the tube tire T in this embodiment ort the assumption that the tube tire T has no mousse 216. Fig.<br><br>
on the sealant chamber 207 side by a centrifugal force to prevent the air in the air chamber 203 from flowing into the sealant chamber 207 through the pierced portion b. However, if the wheel is stopped in rotation and the centrifugal force disappears, the bulkhead 205 applied with a large tension is contracted on the air chamber 203 side, so that the air in the air chamber 203 flows into the sealant chamber 207 and is mixed with the sealant 208. The sealant 208 thus mixed with the air is obstructed from reaching the pierced portions a, b, or it is made poor in flowability, resulting in a degraded sealing performance thereof.<br>
In the tube tire T in this embodiment, however, since the tube 202 in the tube free state is inserted in the mousse 216 previously mounted in the tire 201 and then expanded, it is possible to reduce the sectional expansion ratio R of the tube 202 and hence to solve the above-described inconvenience The reason for this is that since the mousse 216 is elastically deformed more easily, than the tire 201, if the dimension of the tube 202 in the tube free state is set at a large value, the tube 202 in the tube free state can be easily inserted in the mousse 216 by elastically deforming the opening of the mousse 216. As a result, since the dimension of the tube 202 in the tube free state can be thus set at a large value, the expanded amount, that is, the sectional expansion ratio R of the tube 202 can be reduced.<br>
According to the present invention, the tube tire includes a tube having a peripheral wall formed in a circular shape in cross section, wherein the interior of the peripheral wall is partitioned by the bulkhead so that the air chamber to be filled with air is defined between the air chamber side peripheral wall constituting a half circumference of the peripheral wall and the bulkhead and the sealant chamber to be filled with a sealant is defined between the sealant chamber side peripheral wall<br><br>
constituting the remaining half circumference of said peripheral wall and the bulkhead.<br>
Accordingly, even when the tube is pierced by a nail or the like penetrating the tire, the pierced portion can be immediately repaired with the sealant to thereby prevent the leakage of an air from the air chamber. Further, according to the present invention, since the buffer is interposed between the tire and the tube, a nail or the like pierced in the tire does not easily reach the tube by the presence of the buffer, and also even when the tube is forcibly clamped between the tire and the tube by the rim striking phenomenon, a load applied with the tube can be reduced by the effect of the buffer, to thereby prevent the generation of shock puncture. Also, if the air in the air chamber leaks from the air chamber due to damage to the tube, since the outer shape of the tire can be maintained by the rigidity of the buffer, the operation of the wheel .can be continued until a repair shop is located. Additionally, a large-size tube can be assembled in the buffer previously mounted in the tire because the buffer is elastically deformed. This is effective to reduce the sectional expansion ratio of the tube, and hence to enhance the sealing performance of the sealant.<br>
The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.<br><br><br>
