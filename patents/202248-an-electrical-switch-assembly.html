				<td>The electrical switch assembly according to the invention comprises two actuators positioned one above the other and share a common terminal for energising two independent apparatuses.<br>
Accordingly the invention provides an electrical switch assembly for energising two apparatuses independently comprising an insulating body with a make and brake contact terminal for connecting to one of said apparatuses, a fulcrum contact terminal for connecting to the other apparatus, a common terminal between the said make and brake contact terminal and said fulcrum contact terminal for connecting to the supply line, the said common terminal having a make and brake contact point and a fulcrum contact point, first and second contact members each having a first end and a second end, first and second actuators each having a slidable actuating head, the first contact member being located between the said make and brake contact terminal and the fulcrum contact point of the said common terminal with the first end resting on the make and brake contact terminal and the second end extends beyond the fulcrum point of the said common terminal and held between the fulcrum contact point of the common terminal and the slidable actuating head of the said first actuator and the second contacting member being located between the make and brake contact point of the said common terminal and the said fulcrum contact terminal with the first end resting on the make and brake contact point of the said common terminal and the second end extends beyond the said fulcrum contact terminal and held between the said fulcrum contact terminal and the sliding actuator head of the said second actuator; allowing energising and de-energising the apparatuses indepently by the said actuators.<br><br>
The conducting members may preferably have a curved second end for reducing effort for operation of the actuator.<br>
Preferably the switch assembly according to the invention may be provided with means for fixing on a panel or in an enclosure.<br>
The switch assembly according to the invention is described with reference to the accompanying drawings :<br>
Fig.lA and IB show a typical conventional electrical switch in ON and OFF positions respectively.<br>
Rgure 2 shows the electrical switch assembly according to the invention.<br>
The typical conventional electrical switch shown in fig.lA and IB comprises an insulating body (B) with a make and brake contact terminal (1) and a fulcrum contact terminal (2). A contact member (3) having a first end (4) and a second end (5) is seated between the make and brake contact terminal (1) and the fulcrum contact terminal (2) with the second end (5) extending beyond the fulcrum contact terminal (2). An actuator (7) with a spring loaded actuator head (6) is provided for making and braking the contact between the make and brake contact terminal (1) and the fulcrum terminal (2). The second end (5) of the contact member (3) is held between the fulcrum contact terminal (2) and the actuator head (6)<br><br>
so that by sliding the actuator head (6) on the second end (5) of the contact member (3) the connection between the flat contact terminal and fulcrum contact terminal is made or broken as shown in figures 1A and IB,<br>
The actuator head (6) is made to slide forward to the extended portion on the second end (5) of the contact member (3) when the actuator is moved from ON position to OFF position and the actuator head is made to slide backwards when the actuator is moved from ON position to OFF position.<br>
The invention provides a switch assembly as shown in figure 2, comprising two actuators (7, 7) positioned one beside the other. The switch assembly according to the invention comprises an insulating body (B) with a common terminal (8) between a make and brake contact terminal (1) and a fulcrum contact terminal (2). The common terminal (8) is provided with a make and brake contact point (9) and a fulcrum contact point (10). A contact member (3) having a first end (4) and second end (5) is located between the make and brake contact terminal (1) and the fulcrum contact point (10) of the common terminal (8) with the second end (5) extending beyond the fulcrum contact point (10) of the common terminal (8).<br>
Another contact member (3") having a first end (4) and second end (5") is located between the make and brake contact point (9) of the common terminal (8) and the fulcrum contact terminal (2) with the second end (5") extending beyond the fulcrum contact terminal (2). The contact member (3) is held between the fulcrum point   (10) of the common<br><br>
terminal (8) and a slidable spring loaded actuating head (6) of an actuator (7). The second contact member (3 ) is held between a slidable spring loaded actuating head (6 ) of a second actuator (7 ) and the fulcrum contact terminal (2). When the actuators (7, 7) are operated their actuating heads (6, 6") slide over the contact members (3, 3") tilting the contact members (3, 3") on the fulcrums to make and brake connection between the contact terminal (1) and the common terminal (8) and the connection between the fulcrum terminal (2) and the common terminal (8). The supply line (SL) is connected to the common terminal (8) and the two apparatuses (LO^ LO2) are connected to the make and brake contact terminal (1) and fulcrum terminal (2) respectively. The apparatuses (LA, LO2) may be operated independently by operating the respective actuators (7,7).<br>
Preferably the second end (5, 5") of the contact members may be provided with a small curvature for more efficient operation. In a preferred embodiment of the switch assembly at least a portion of the conducting parts are provided with a layer of silver. The switch assembly may be housed in housing making the connecting terminal and the actuators accessible. It can also be mounted on a panel for mounting on a flat surface.<br>
The switch assembly according to the invention is cost effective and has lesser number of components.<br><br><br>
