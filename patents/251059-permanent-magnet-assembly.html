it is to be performed<br><br>
PERMANENT MAGNET ASSEMBLY<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to magnets, and more particularly to permanent magnet assemblies adapted to provide a time-varying magnetic field to an annular region.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Permanent magnets have been used for many years and for many purposes. However, new applications of permanent magnets are driving the development of increasingly sophisticated permanent magnet assemblies. A permanent magnet assembly that can produce a high amplitude magnetic field intensity across a gap is of particular interest, especially in applications of magnetocaloric materials. Magnetocaloric materials near a transition from a ferromagnetic state to a paramagnetic state will warm when magnetized and cool when demagnetized. An apparatus that applies a time-varying magnetic field to magnetocaloric materials can be used to provide heating or cooling, for example in a magnetic refrigerator.<br>
A magnet assembly that produces a magnetic field intensity across a gap can be used to apply a time-varying magnetic field to magnetocaloric materials by moving the magnetocaloric materials in and out of the gap. This can be accomplished, for example, by moving the magnetocaloric materials relative to a stationary magnetic assembly, or by moving a magnet assembly relative to stationary magnetocaloric materials.<br>
Movement of magnetocaloric material relative to a magnet assembly can be accomplished through rotational or translational motion. One approach (the “rotating magnet” approach) is to arrange magnetocaloric material in a stationary annular (ring-shaped) structure, and then to rotate a permanent magnet assembly around the ring. Another approach (the “rotating bed” approach) is to arrange magnetocaloric material in an annular<br>
-1-<br><br>
structure partially surrounded by a stationary permanent magnet assembly, and then to rotate the annular structure containing the magnetocaloric material. Thus, a permanent magnet assembly specially adapted to provide a time-varying magnetic field to an annular region is of interest, for applications including, but not limited to, magnetic refrigeration.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A permanent magnet assembly according to the present invention is adapted to generate a strong magnetic field across an air gap and to provide a time-varying magnetic field to an annular region having a central axis while minimizing the volume, mass, and fabrication cost of such an assembly. A permanent magnet assembly according to the invention can be especially well suited for a rotating bed or rotating magnet magnetic refrigerator.<br>
For example, a permanent magnet assembly according to the invention can allow constant access to the air gap or annular region from one side. This can enable components of a magnetic refrigerator, such as beds containing magnetocaloric material and heat transfer fluid plumbing, to be stationary and positioned within the air gap or annular region while the magnet assembly rotates. Alternatively, the magnet assembly can be made stationary, while components of a magnetic refrigerator, such as beds containing magnetocaloric material and heat transfer fluid plumbing, rotate within the annular region.<br>
A permanent magnet assembly according to the invention includes a plurality of magnet blocks made of sintered magnet material, each magnet block having its own magnetic field vector. The magnet blocks are positioned to direct the path of flux lines within the assembly along a loop that spans the incorporated air gap.<br>
To reduce fabrication costs, a permanent magnet assembly according to the invention can use magnet blocks in as close to their as-sintered form as possible, to minimize the number of cutting and grinding operations and reduce the amount of scrap material, by reducing the need for<br>
-2-<br><br>
precisely machined permanent magnets. Some or all of the permanent magnet portions of such a magnet assembly can be arc-shaped with a rectangular cross section or generally rectangular in shape, in either case with an orthogonal magnetization vector to minimize production costs. This geometry can be especially well suited to the manufacture of sintered NdFeB magnets by current pressing methods, and the relatively low number of magnet mating surfaces can reduce the number of precision grinding operations that might otherwise be required.<br>
A permanent magnet assembly according to the invention can include one or more features to optimize the assembly for a particular application. A permanent magnet assembly according to the invention can include one or more pole pieces, for example to focus and concentrate magnetic flux into the air gap. A permanent magnet assembly according to the invention can include one or more blocking magnets, for example to concentrate flux or minimize stray flux. A permanent magnet assembly according to the invention may include a flux containment jacket or one or more flux containment sheaths, for example to minimize flux loss outside the flux loop.<br>
Precisely machined structures used in a magnet assembly according to the invention, for example pole pieces that surround a gap at high magnetic field, may have surfaces that benefit from close tolerances to allow these surfaces to nest closely together with other components of a magnetic refrigerator, such as containers of magnetocaloric materials. By forming any structures requiring precise machining, such as pole pieces, of magnetically permeable material, and operatively coupling those precisely machined structures to rectangular permanent magnet portions, any precision machining of permanent magnet material can be reduced or avoided.<br>
A permanent magnet assembly according to the invention can provide axial gap flux (magnetic flux through the air gap in a direction parallel to the central axis of an annular region). In such a permanent magnet assembly providing axial gap flux, either an interior flux return path (located<br>
-3-<br><br>
inside the annular region) or an exterior flux path (located outside the annular region) can be used.<br>
Alternatively, such a permanent magnet assembly can provide radial gap flux (magnetic flux through the air gap in a direction normal to the central axis of an annular region). In such a permanent magnet assembly providing radial gap flux, either an upper flux return path (located above the annular region) or a lower flux path (located below the annular region) can be used.<br>
A preferred embodiment of a permanent magnet assembly according to the present invention provides axial gap flux with an exterior flux return path, and includes straight-segment configuration features. This preferred embodiment includes two upper radial permanent magnets, two lower radial permanent magnets, two central axial permanent magnets, with two upper axial permanent magnets and two lower axial permanent magnets surrounding an air gap, arranged to form a magnetic loop to subject the air gap to a high axial magnetic field. The preferred embodiment may include upper and lower circumferential blocking magnets and upper and lower radial blocking magnets that can improve the field generation characteristics without greatly increasing the cost, although this is not required.<br>
An alternative permanent magnet assembly according to the invention provides axial gap flux with an exterior flux return path, and includes arc-shaped curved block magnets having a rectangular cross-section. This alternative permanent magnet assembly includes an arc-shaped central axial permanent magnet, arc-shaped upper and lower radial permanent magnets, and arc-shaped upper and lower axial permanent magnets surrounding an arc-shaped air gap, arranged to form a magnetic loop to subject the air gap to a high axial magnetic field.<br>
A different permanent magnet assembly according to the invention has two air gaps at high magnetic field with axial gap flux, an interior flux return path, and primarily straight configuration features. This permanent magnet assembly includes a central axial permanent magnet, first and second upper radial permanent magnets, first and second lower radial permanent magnets, a first upper axial permanent magnet and a first lower axial<br>
-4-<br><br>
permanent magnet surrounding a first air gap, and a second upper axial permanent magnet and a second lower axial permanent magnet surrounding a second air gap, arranged to form two magnetic loops to subject the two air gaps to a high axial magnetic field.<br>
Another permanent magnet assembly according to the invention provides radial gap flux with a lower flux return path, and includes arc-shaped curved block magnets having a rectangular cross section. This permanent magnet assembly includes an arc-shaped central radial magnet, interior and exterior arc-shaped axial magnets, and interior and exterior arc-shaped radial magnets surrounding an arc-shaped air gap, arranged to form a magnetic loop to subject the air gap to a high radial magnetic field.<br>
A permanent magnet assembly according to the invention can be of particular interest for use in a magnetic refrigeration device. Exemplary magnetic refrigeration devices that use rotational motion are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,526,759 and 6,668,560, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference.<br>
Further objects, features, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to the drawings, Figs. 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 provide perspective views of three-dimensional permanent magnet assemblies that include permanent magnet portions. For ease of fabrication, each permanent magnet portion is formed as a polyhedral solid having multiple faces, as an arc-shaped solid having a rectangular or square cross-section, or as a slight variation of those shapes using a minimal number of straight cuts. Each permanent magnet portion is magnetized, with a direction of magnetization (the magnetization vector) that is often either substantially parallel or substantially perpendicular (normal) relative to a particular face of that permanent magnet portion. By way of example, a typical bar magnet having a North end and a South end has a magnetization vector that is substantially parallel to the four faces along the length of the bar magnet, and substantially normal to the two opposing faces at the ends.<br>
To fully describe the structures of the various embodiments of a permanent magnet assembly disclosed here, the drawings should show the<br>
-7-<br><br>
directions of the magnetization vectors of the permanent magnet portions. Thus, in the drawings herein, each exposed face of a permanent magnet portion includes a mark that indicates the primary direction of the magnetization vector of that permanent magnet portion relative to that face whenever it is practical to do so.<br>
For example, a face of a permanent magnet portion that lies approximately parallel to the magnetization vector in that permanent magnet portion will be referred to herein as a "flux parallel" face. An arrow on a face of a permanent magnet portion means that face is a flux parallel face, and that the magnetization vector in that permanent magnet portion is pointed in the direction of the arrow. On such a flux parallel face, by convention and not as a limitation, the point of the arrow may be considered the North end of the magnetization vector and the tail of the arrow may be considered the South end of the magnetization vector.<br>
Similarly, an X on a face of a permanent magnet portion means that the magnetization vector in that permanent magnet portion is pointed into that permanent magnet portion. A convenient way to remember this is to think of the X as the feathers on the tail of an arrow going into the face. By convention and not as a limitation, a face of a permanent magnet portion bearing an X may be considered the South end of that permanent magnet portion. If the magnetization vector is approximately normal to that face, the face will be referred to herein as a “flux entry” face. If the magnetization vector is at an acute (less than about 90 degree) angle to that face, the face will be referred to herein as a “partial flux entry” face. The term “at least a partial flux entry face” herein includes both flux entry faces and partial flux entry faces.<br>
Further, an O with a dot in the center on a face of a permanent magnet portion indicates that the magnetic vector is pointed out of that permanent magnet portion. This can be remembered by thinking of the O with a dot in the center as representing the point of an arrow emerging from the face. By convention and not as a limitation, a face of a permanent magnet portion bearing an O with a dot in the center may be considered the North end<br>
-8-<br><br>
of that permanent magnet portion. If the magnetization vector is approximately normal to that face, the face will be referred to herein as a “flux exit”face. If the magnetization vector is at an acute (less than about 90 degree) angle to that face, the face will be referred to herein as a “partial flux exit” face. The term “at least a partial flux exit face” herein includes both flux exit faces and partial flux exit faces.<br>
Further, it should be understood that the depicted direction of the magnetization vector of any particular permanent magnet portion is the magnetization vector of that permanent magnet portion in isolation. The direction of magnetic flux will, of course, shift when that permanent magnet portion is coupled with other permanent magnet portions having different magnetization vectors to form a composite permanent magnet assembly.<br>
Finally, the cross-sectional views of Figs. 3, 5, 7, 9, and 10-14 include cross-sections of permanent magnet portions. In the permanent magnet portions shown in these figures, the magnetization vectors are approximately parallel to the plane of the cross-section, and each cross-section of a permanent magnet portion bears an arrow indicating the direction of the magnetization vector in that portion. By convention and not as a limitation, the point of the arrow may be considered the North end of the magnetization vector and the tail of the arrow may be considered the South end of the magnetization vector.<br>
By way of example, applying the convention described above to a typical bar magnet formed as an elongated rectangular block having a North end and a South end, the four faces along the length of the bar magnet would all be flux parallel faces bearing arrows pointing from the South to the North end, the end face at the North end would be a flux exit face bearing an O with a dot in the center, and the end face at the South end would be a flux entry face bearing an X.<br>
Of course, as long as all the arrows in a drawing are treated the same way, the above-described convention could be reversed whereby the arrow point would indicate the South end, the arrow tail would indicate the<br>
-9-<br><br>
North end, an X would indicate a magnetic vector pointing out of a face, and an O with a dot in it would indicate a magnetic vector pointing into a face.<br>
The permanent magnet portions, including blocking magnets, of the various embodiments of a permanent magnet assembly according to the invention disclosed herein can be formed of any suitable permanent magnet material, for example of the type sold by Sumitomo Special Metals of Japan under the trademark Neomax 50, or a combination of suitable materials.<br>
The magnetically permeable portions, such as pole pieces, flux containment jackets, or flux containment sheaths, can be formed of any suitable magnetically permeable material, for example a structural alloy such as low-carbon steel that has the ability to carry flux, or a specifically permeable material intended for use in magnetics such as the material sold by High Temp Metals of California, USA under the trademark Permendur 2V, or a combination of suitable materials.<br>
Turning now to the drawings, Fig. 1 is a top perspective view of a preferred embodiment of a permanent magnet assembly according to the invention, indicated generally at 20. The permanent magnet assembly 20 surrounds an air gap at high magnetic field 21 having a rectangular cross section 22. The permanent magnet assembly 20 is adapted to rotate about an axis of rotation 23, whereby the air gap 21 sweeps an annular region 24 having a rectangular cross section 22. A portion of the annular region 24 is shown in dotted lines in Fig. 1.<br>
The air gap 21 of the permanent magnet assembly 20 corresponds to a straight-segment approximation of a portion of the annular region 24, covering an arc length of approximately 120 degrees. Although the cross-section of the air gap 21 is preferably rectangular, this is not necessary, and other shapes may be used. Similarly, the arc length may be greater than or less than 120 degrees.<br>
The permanent magnet assembly 20 is said to have axial gap flux, since the direction of magnetic flux through the air gap 21 is parallel to the axis of rotation 23. The permanent magnet assembly 20 is also said to have an external flux return path, since the magnetic flux returns through a path<br>
-10-<br><br>
outside the radius of the air gap 21 (from the axis of rotation 23) after crossing the air gap 21. The permanent magnet assembly 20 may be said to have straight-segment configuration features, since it is formed of blocks having straight sides only with no curved surfaces.<br>
The permanent magnet assembly 20 is preferably made entirely from rectangular blocks of sintered material with no more than one diagonal cut. With such a construction, any pre-assembly grinding operations are performed on flat surfaces, thereby simplifying the manufacturing process.<br>
The permanent magnet assembly 20 includes a first upper radial magnet portion 30, formed as a six faced polyhedral solid and having a magnetization vector extending substantially in a radial direction (normal to the axis of rotation 23). The upper exposed face 31 of the upper radial magnet portion is preferably trapezoidal in shape. The upper exposed face 31 is bounded by a major parallel edge 32, a minor parallel edge 33, an outside edge 34, and an inside edge 35. The upper radial magnet portion 30 has a second trapezoidal face (hidden in Fig. 1) directly below, opposite, and parallel to the upper exposed face 31, having approximately the same trapezoidal shape as the upper exposed face 31. The upper exposed face 31 and the parallel second trapezoidal face are both flux parallel faces.<br>
The upper radial magnet portion 30 has an inside lateral face (hidden in Fig. 1), approximately rectangular in shape and extending downward from the inside edge 35 of the upper exposed face 31 to the corresponding edge of the parallel second trapezoidal face. Opposite the inside lateral face, the upper radial magnet portion 30 has an outside lateral face (hidden in Fig. 1), approximately rectangular in shape and extending downward from the outside edge 34 of its upper exposed face 31 to the corresponding edge of the parallel second trapezoidal face.<br>
The upper radial magnet portion has an inside radial face (hidden in Fig. 1), approximately rectangular in shape and extending downward from the minor parallel edge 33 of the upper exposed face 31 to the corresponding edge of the parallel second trapezoidal face. Opposite the inside radial face, the upper radial magnet portion 30 has an outside radial face (hidden in Fig.<br>
-11-<br><br>
1), approximately rectangular in shape and extending downward from the major parallel edge 32 of its upper exposed face 31 to the corresponding edge of the parallel second trapezoidal face. As perhaps best shown in Fig. 3, the outside radial face is a flux entry face, and the inside radial face is a flux exit face.<br>
The permanent magnet assembly 20 includes a second upper radial magnet portion 36 having an inside edge 37. The upper exposed face of the second upper radial magnet portion 36 is a trapezoid, and is shaped as a mirror image (along its inside edge 37) of the upper exposed face 31 of the first upper radial magnet portion 30. Like the first upper radial magnet portion, the second upper radial magnet portion 36 has a second trapezoidal face (hidden in Fig. 1) directly below, opposite, and parallel to its upper exposed face.<br>
Like the first upper radial magnet portion 30, the second upper radial magnet portion 36 has an inside lateral face, an outside lateral face, an inside radial face, and an outside radial face, all of which are hidden in Fig. 1 and shaped generally like the corresponding faces of the upper radial magnet portion 30. Like the corresponding faces of the upper radial magnet portion 30, the outside radial face of the second upper radial magnet portion is a flux entry face, and its inside radial face is a flux exit face.<br>
The first upper radial magnet portion 30 is preferably, but not necessarily, formed by cutting off a corner of a permanent magnet shaped as a rectangular block, using a single cut along the line that becomes the inside edge 35 of the first upper radial magnet portion 30. Similarly, the second upper radial magnet portion 36 is preferably, but not necessarily, formed by cutting off a corner of a permanent magnet shaped as a rectangular block, using a single cut along the line that becomes the inside edge 37 of the second upper radial magnet portion 36.<br>
The permanent magnet assembly 20 also includes a first upper axial magnet portion 40 and a second upper axial magnet portion 41, each formed as a six faced polyhedral solid and having a magnetization vector extending substantially parallel to the axis of rotation 23. The upper exposed face 42 of<br>
-12-<br><br>
the second upper axial magnet portion 41 is preferably trapezoidal in shape. The upper exposed face 42 is bounded by a major parallel edge 43, a minor parallel edge 44, an outside edge 45, and an inside edge 46. The upper axial magnet portion 41 has a second trapezoidal face (hidden in Fig. 1) directly below, opposite, and parallel to the upper exposed face 42, having approximately the same trapezoidal shape as the upper exposed face 42. The upper exposed face 42 is a flux entry face, and the parallel second trapezoidal face is a flux exit face.<br>
The upper axial magnet portion 41 has an inside lateral face (hidden in Fig. 1), approximately rectangular in shape and extending downward from the inside edge 46 of the upper exposed face 42 to the corresponding edge of the parallel second trapezoidal face. Opposite the inside lateral face, the upper axial magnet portion 41 has an outside lateral face (hidden in Fig. 1), approximately rectangular in shape and extending downward from the outside edge 45 of its upper exposed face 42 to the corresponding edge of the parallel second trapezoidal face.<br>
The upper axial magnet portion 41 has an inside radial face (hidden in Fig. 1), approximately rectangular in shape and extending downward from the minor parallel edge 44 of the upper exposed face 42 to the corresponding edge of the parallel second trapezoidal face. Opposite the inside radial face, the upper axial magnet portion 41 has an outside radial face (hidden in Fig. 1), approximately rectangular in shape and extending downward from the major parallel edge 43 of its upper exposed face 42 to the corresponding edge of the parallel second trapezoidal face.<br>
The first upper axial magnet portion 40 has a trapezoidal upper exposed face shaped as a mirror image of the upper exposed face 42 of the second upper axial magnet portion 41 (along its inside edge 46). Like the second upper axial magnet portion, the first upper axial magnet portion 40 has a second trapezoidal face (hidden in Fig. 1) directly below, opposite, and parallel to its upper exposed face.<br>
Like the second upper axial magnet portion 41, the first upper radial magnet portion 40 has an inside lateral face, an outside lateral face, an inside<br>
-13-<br><br>
radial face, and an outside radial face, all of which are hidden in Fig. 1 and shaped generally like the corresponding faces of the second upper axial magnet portion 41. Like the corresponding faces of the second upper axial magnet portion 41, the trapezoidal upper exposed face of the first upper axial magnet portion 40 is a flux entry face, and its parallel second trapezoidal face is a flux exit face.<br>
The second upper axial magnet portion 41 is preferably, but not necessarily, formed by cutting off a corner of a permanent magnet shaped as a rectangular block, using a single cut along the line that becomes the inside edge 46 of the second upper axial magnet portion 41. Similarly, the first upper axial magnet portion 40 is preferably, but not necessarily, formed by cutting off a corner of a permanent magnet shaped as a rectangular block, using a single cut along the line that becomes the inside lateral face of the first upper axial magnet portion 40.<br>
The permanent magnet assembly 20 preferably includes a first upper circumferential blocking magnet portion 50 and a second upper circumferential blocking magnet portion 51, each formed as a six faced rectangular block and having a magnetization vector extending substantially circumferentially (normal to a radius extending from the axis of rotation 23). The exposed outside lateral faces of the first upper circumferential blocking magnet portion 50 and second upper circumferential blocking magnet portion 51 are flux entry faces.<br>
The first upper circumferential blocking magnet portion 50 and the second upper circumferential blocking magnet portion 51 each have an inside lateral face (hidden in Fig. 1), approximately rectangular in shape and extending downward from the inside edges 52 of those upper circumferential blocking magnet portions. The hidden inside lateral faces of the first upper circumferential blocking magnet portion 50 and second upper circumferential blocking magnet portion 51 are flux exit faces.<br>
The first upper circumferential blocking magnet portion 50 and the second upper circumferential blocking magnet portion 51 are preferably, but<br>

The permanent magnet assembly 90 has two ends, each end surrounding an air gap at high magnetic field 21 having a rectangular cross section, where both air gaps experience the same direction of magnetic flux. Although the cross-sections of the air gaps 21 are preferably rectangular, this is not necessary, and other shapes may be used.

As perhaps best seen in Fig. 7, the permanent magnet assembly 90 is said to have axial gap flux, since the direction of magnetic flux through the air gaps 21 is substantially parallel to the axis of rotation 23. The permanent magnet assembly 90 is also said to have an internal flux return path, since the magnetic flux returns through a central path surrounding the axis of rotation 23 after crossing the air gap 21.

The first and second lateral faces of the upper radial magnet portions 93 and 98 are all flux parallel faces.<br>
The upper portion of the permanent magnet assembly 90 includes a first upper axial magnet portion 99 adjacent to the first upper radial magnet<br>

portion 93, and a second upper axial magnet portion 100 adjacent to the second upper radial magnet portion 98, each upper axial magnet portion preferably formed of a rectangular block permanent magnet having a magnetization vector parallel to the axis of rotation 23.<br>
Each of the upper axial magnet portions 99 and 100 has an exposed upper face, preferably rectangular or square in shape. Each upper axial magnet portion has a hidden lower face (hidden in Fig. 6) directly below, opposite, and parallel to the exposed upper face, having approximately the same square or rectangular shape as the exposed upper face.

central permeable slab 92 surrounding the axis of rotation 23. Like the upper portion, the lower portion of the permanent magnet assembly 90 includes a first lower radial magnet portion 103 and a second lower radial magnet portion 104 on the sides of the central permeable slab 92. The lower radial magnet portions 103 and 104 are located directly below the corresponding first upper radial magnet portion 93 and second upper radial magnet portion 98.<br>
As perhaps best shown in Fig. 7, the magnetization vectors in the lower radial magnet portions 103 and 104 point in directions opposite to the magnetization vectors in the corresponding upper radial magnet portions 93 and 98. Thus, the inside radial faces of the lower radial magnet portions 103 and 104 are flux exit faces and the outside radial faces are flux entry faces.<br>
The lower portion of the permanent magnet assembly 90 includes a first lower axial magnet portion 105 adjacent to the first lower radial magnet portion 103, and a second lower axial magnet portion 106 adjacent to the second lower radial magnet portion 104. The lower axial magnet portions 105 and 106 are directly below the corresponding upper axial magnet portions of the upper portion of the permanent magnet assembly 90, having approximately the same square or rectangular shape, and preferably formed of a rectangular block permanent magnet.<br>
The lower axial magnet portions 105 and 106 each have a magnetization vector parallel to the axis of rotation 23 and pointing in the same direction as the magnetization vectors in the corresponding upper axial magnet portions 99 and 100. Thus, the upper face of each of the lower axial magnet portions 105 and 106 is a flux entry face, and the lower face of each of the lower axial magnet portions 105 and 106 is a flux exit face.<br>
Corresponding to the first upper radial blocking magnet portion 101, the lower portion of the permanent magnet assembly 90 preferably includes a first lower radial blocking magnet portion 107 adjacent to the first lower axial magnet portion 105.

-26-<br><br>
As perhaps best shown in Fig. 7, each lower radial blocking magnet portion is preferably formed of a rectangular block permanent magnet having a radial magnetization vector (normal to the axis of rotation 23). The inside radial faces of the lower radial blocking magnet portions 107 and 108 are flux entry faces, and the outside radial faces of the lower radial blocking magnet portions 107 and 108 are flux exit faces.<br>
The permanent magnet assembly 90 preferably includes one or more lateral blocking magnet portions 109, each formed of a rectangular block permanent magnet. As best shown in Fig. 6, the lateral blocking magnet portions 109 preferably cover the lateral faces of the upper and lower radial magnet portions and central permeable slabs, and the junctions therebetween.<br>
The magnetization vectors of the lateral blocking magnet portions 109 are radial (normal to the axis of rotation 23) at the center of the lateral blocking magnet portions 109. The hidden inside faces of the upper blocking magnet portions are flux exit faces, and the exposed outside faces of the upper blocking magnet portions are flux entry faces. Conversely, the hidden inside faces of the lower blocking magnet portions are flux entry faces, and the exposed outside faces of the upper blocking magnet portions are flux exit faces.<br>
FIG. 7 is a cross-sectional view of the permanent magnet assembly of Fig. 6 taken along the line 7-7 thereof. The cross-sectional view of Fig. 7 shows how a first magnetic flux loop is formed by the lower axial magnet portion 105, the lower radial magnet portion 103, the central axial magnet portion 91, the upper radial magnet portion 93, the upper axial magnet portion 99, and a first air gap at high magnetic field 21. A second magnetic flux loop is formed by the lower axial magnet portion 106, the lower radial magnet portion 104, the central axial magnet portion 91, the upper radial magnet portion 98, the upper axial magnet portion 100, and a second air gap at high magnetic field 21.<br>
Although not required, the lateral blocking magnet portions 109 prevent stray field from leaking into the nearby low field regions on each side<br>
-27-<br><br>
of the permanent magnet assembly 90 (offset 90 degrees from the air gaps at high magnetic field 21). This also helps to ensure a sharp field decay away from the air gaps at high magnetic field 21 by forcing any stray flux outside the diameter of the annular region swept by rotation of the permanent magnet assembly 109.<br>
Fig. 8 is a perspective view of another embodiment of a permanent magnet assembly 110 according to the invention. The permanent magnet assembly 110 surrounds an air gap at high magnetic field 21 having a rectangular cross section. Although the cross-section of the air gap 21 is preferably rectangular, this is not necessary, and other shapes may be used.<br>
Like the permanent magnet assemblies 20, 70, and 90 of Figs. 1-7, the permanent magnet assembly 110 of Fig. 8 is adapted to rotate about an axis of rotation 23, whereby the air gap 21 sweeps an annular region having a rectangular cross section (not shown in Fig. 8). The air gap 21 of the permanent magnet assembly 110 covers an arc length of approximately 120 degrees, although this is not required and the arc length may be greater than or less than 120 degrees.<br>
As perhaps best seen in Fig. 9, the permanent magnet assembly 110 is said to have radial gap flux, since the direction of magnetic flux through the air gap 21 is substantially normal (perpendicular) to the axis of rotation 23. The permanent magnet assembly 110 is also said to have a lower flux return path, since the magnetic flux returns through a path below the air gap 21 after crossing the air gap 21. The permanent magnet assembly 110 may be said to have curved configuration features, since it is formed of blocks having curved surfaces.<br>
It has been observed through modeling that a permanent magnet assembly with radial gap flux, such as the permanent magnet assembly 110, may suffer in flux density per unit mass compared to a permanent magnet assembly having axial gap flux. This is presumed to be the result of focusing flux lines in the air gap to be as close together as possible, and therefore parallel, while also requiring the flux lines to be tangent to the curved magnet surface everywhere they cross into the air gap. This conflict of interests result<br>
-28-<br><br>
in a distortion of the flux lines leading to flux leakage, field cancellation, and field non-uniformity. These negative effects can be countered by minimizing the ratio of the radial width of the air gap to the distance of the air gap from the central axis of the annular region.<br>
The permanent magnet assembly 110 includes an exterior radial magnet portion 111 formed as an arc-shaped solid having six faces, a rectangular or square cross-section, and a radial magnetization vector extending substantially normal to the axis of rotation 23.

The inside radial face (hidden in Fig. 8) of the exterior radial magnet portion 111 is the face nearest to the axis of rotation and normal to a radius extending from the axis of rotation. The outside radial face (also hidden in Fig. 8) of the exterior radial magnet portion 111 is the face farthest from the axis of rotation and normal to a radius extending from the axis of rotation. The inside radial face of the exterior radial magnet portion 111 is a flux exit face, and the outside radial face of the exterior radial magnet portion 111 is a flux entry face.<br>

The permanent magnet assembly 110 includes an exterior axial magnet portion 112 formed as an arc-shaped solid having six faces, a rectangular or square cross-section, and an axial magnetization vector extending substantially parallel to the axis of rotation 23. The exterior axial magnet portion 112 can be formed of a single piece or multiple pieces.<br>
The inside radial face (hidden in Fig. 8) of the exterior axial magnet portion 112 is the face nearest to the axis of rotation and normal to a radius extending from the axis of rotation. The outside radial face (partially exposed<br>

Fig. 9 is a cross-sectional view of the permanent magnet assembly 110 of Fig. 8 taken along the line 9-9 thereof. The cross-sectional view of Fig. 9 shows how a magnetic flux loop is formed by the interior radial magnet portion 117, the interior axial magnet portion 116, the central radial magnet portion 113, the exterior axial magnet portion 112, the exterior radial magnet portion 111, and the air gap at high magnetic field 21.<br>
Although not required, the permanent magnet assembly 110 preferably includes the exterior pole piece 118 and interior pole piece 119 surrounding the air gap at high magnetic field 21 to guide and concentrate the magnetic flux through the air gap at high magnetic field 21.<br>
Although not required, the permanent magnet assembly 110 preferably includes the exterior sheath 121, interior sheath 122, and lower sheath 123 to reduce flux leakage from the assembly.<br>
-33-<br><br>
As perhaps best shown in Fig. 9, the interior axial magnet 116 and interior radial magnet 117 on the near side of the air gap 21 from the axis of rotation 23 preferably have a greater cross-sectional area than the exterior axial magnet 112 and exterior radial magnet 111 on the far side of the air gap 21 to help equalize their relative volumes and flux capacity, and thereby prevent over-saturation and flux leakage on the inner radius side. Similarly, the interior pole piece 119 preferably has a greater cross-sectional area than the exterior pole piece 118 on the far side of the air gap 21 to help equalize their relative volumes and flux capacity.<br>
Fig. 10 is a cross-sectional view of a permanent magnet assembly according to the invention 130 having a simple array construction. The cross-sectional view of Fig. 10 shows how a magnetic flux loop is formed by the lower gap field parallel magnet 135, the lower gap field normal magnet 134, the central gap field parallel magnet 133, the upper gap field normal magnet<br>
132,	the upper gap field parallel magnet 131, and the air gap at high magnetic field 21.<br>
FIG. 11 is a cross-sectional view of a permanent magnet assembly 140 according to the invention having a simple array construction with a simple flux containment jacket. The cross-sectional view of Fig. 11 shows how a magnetic flux loop is formed by the lower gap field parallel magnet 135, the lower gap field normal magnet 134, the central gap field parallel magnet<br>
133,	the upper gap field normal magnet 132, the upper gap field parallel magnet 131, and the air gap at high magnetic field 21.<br>
The permanent magnet assembly 140 includes a simple flux containment jacket 141 used to minimize stray flux. The simple flux containment jacket 141 is a magnetically permeable, stray flux containment jacket, made of a magnetically permeable material such as low-carbon steel, Vanadium Cobalt Iron alloy, or some other highly permeable alloy.<br>
Fig. 12 is a cross-sectional view of a permanent magnet assembly according to the invention 145 having a simple array construction with multiple flux containment sheaths. The cross-sectional view of Fig. 12 shows how a magnetic flux loop is formed by the lower gap field parallel magnet 135, the<br>
-34-<br><br>
lower gap field normal magnet 134, the central gap field parallel magnet 133, the upper gap field normal magnet 132, the upper gap field parallel magnet 131, and the air gap at high magnetic field 21.<br>
The permanent magnet assembly 145 includes multiple flux containment sheaths used to minimize stray flux, including an upper containment sheath 146, a central containment sheath 147, and a lower containment sheath 148. Each flux containment sheath may include one or more chamfers 149. Compared to the simple flux containment jacket 141 of Fig. 11, the use of multiple flux containment sheaths shown in Fig. 12 is better suited to redirect stray flux into the magnetic circuit; however, it also increases the difficulty of manufacturing and assembly.<br>
FIG. 13 is a cross-sectional view of a permanent magnet assembly according to the invention 150 having a simple array construction with tapered pole pieces. The cross-sectional view of Fig. 13 shows how a magnetic flux loop is formed by the lower gap field parallel magnet 135, the lower gap field normal magnet 134, the central gap field parallel magnet 133, the upper gap field normal magnet 132, the upper gap field parallel magnet 131, and the air gap at high magnetic field 21.<br>
The permanent magnet assembly 150 includes pole pieces surrounding the air gap at high magnetic field 21, including an upper gap pole piece 151 and a lower gap pole piece 152. Each pole piece may include one or more chamfers or tapers 153. Compared to the simple array construction of Fig. 10, the use of tapered magnetically permeable pole pieces surrounding the air gap 21 can allow for flux densities within the magnetic circuit eclipsing the saturation flux density of the sintered magnet compound being used, thereby achieving a higher magnetic field in the air gap for a given mass of the assembly. However, assembly cost and scrap material would likely increase from the introduction of a non-rectilinear magnet block to the circuit<br>
Fig. 14 is a cross-sectional view of a permanent magnet assembly according to the invention having a simple array construction with magnetic blocking poles. The cross-sectional view of Fig. 14 shows how a magnetic flux loop is formed by the lower gap field parallel magnet 135, the lower gap<br>
-35-<br><br>
field normal magnet 134, the central gap field parallel magnet 133, the upper gap field normal magnet 132, the upper gap field parallel magnet 131, and the air gap at high magnetic field 21.<br>
The permanent magnet assembly 155 includes blocking magnets, including an upper gap field normal blocking magnet 156 and a lower gap field normal blocking magnet 157. Compared to the simple array construction of Fig. 10, the use of blocking magnets can provide a higher magnetic field in the air gap, but at an increased cost due to the additional magnets and assembly required.<br>
Fig. 15 is a perspective view of another embodiment of a permanent magnet assembly 160 according to the invention. The permanent magnet assembly 160 has an interior flux return path, and provides axial gap flux through two V-shaped air gaps 184 and 185 at high magnetic field having a rectangular cross section, where both air gaps 184 and 185 experience the same direction of magnetic flux. Although the cross-sections of the air gaps 184 and 185 are preferably rectangular, this is not necessary, and other shapes may be used.<br>
The permanent magnet assembly 160 of Fig. 15 is adapted to rotate about an axis of rotation 23, whereby the air gaps 184 and 185 sweep an annular region having a rectangular cross section (not shown in Fig. 15). The air gaps 184 and 184 of the permanent magnet assembly 160 each cover an arc length of approximately 60 degrees, for a total arc coverage of 120 degrees, although this is not required and the total arc length may be greater than or less than 120 degrees. The permanent magnet assembly 160 may be especially useful in rotating magnet applications which benefit from minimization of the rotational moment of inertia.<br>
As perhaps best seen in Fig. 16, the permanent magnet assembly 160 is said to have axial gap flux, since the direction of magnetic flux through the air gaps 184 and 185 is substantially parallel to the axis of rotation 23. The permanent magnet assembly 160 is also said to have an internal flux return path, since the magnetic flux returns through a central path surrounding the axis of rotation 23 after crossing the air gaps 184 and 185. The<br>
-36-<br><br>
permanent magnet assembly 160 includes mostly rectangular blocks, with some exceptions. The major radial magnets 163,186, 177, and 178 are formed as solids having a pentagonal cross-section, and can be formed, for example, from a rectangular block with two straight cuts. The axial gap magnets 188,176, 180, and 183 are formed as solids having a V-shaped cross-section, and can be formed from a rectangular block with four straight cuts. The axial gap magnets 188,176, 180, and 183 could also be formed as arc-shaped solids having a rectangular cross-section instead of being V-shaped. The central axial magnet 161 is preferably formed as a disk magnet with two flattened side edges , although other shapes could be used such as a rectangular or hexagonal block.<br>
The permanent magnet assembly 160 includes a central axial magnet portion 161 formed of a disk magnet having flattened upper and lower faces, with a magnetization vector parallel to the axis of rotation 23. The central axial magnet portion 161 preferably includes flattened lateral edges on each side, although this is not required. As perhaps best shown in Fig. 16, the upper face of the central axial magnet 161 is a flux exit face, and the lower face of the central axial magnet 161 is a flux entry face.<br>
The central axial magnet portion 161 provides a return path for the lines of magnetic flux through the air gaps 184 and 185. The central axial magnet portion 161 is preferably shaped and interiorly positioned at a sufficient distance from the air gaps 184 and 185 to prevent shunting of the gap flux into the flux return path.<br>
The upper portion of the permanent magnet assembly 160 preferably includes a central permeable slab 162, for example a block of low-carbon steel, surrounding the axis of rotation 23, although this is not required. The central permeable slab 162 serves to neutralize repulsive magnetic forces in the center of the assembly resulting from the adjacent permanent magnet<br>
portions.<br>
The upper portion of the permanent magnet assembly 160 includes a first upper major radial permanent magnet portion 163 and a second upper major radial magnet permanent portion 186 adjacent to the central permeable<br>
-37-<br><br>
slab 162, each upper major radial magnet portion preferably formed as a polyhedral solid having a pentagonal cross-section and a radial magnetization vector (normal to the axis of rotation 23). The permanent magnet assembly 160 includes similar lower major radial permanent magnet portions 177 and 178.<br>
Each of the upper major radial magnet portions 163 and 186 has an exposed upper face, preferably pentagonal in shape, and having an inside radial edge 164, a first lateral edge 165, a second lateral edge 166, a first outside radial edge 167, and a second outside radial edge 168. The first outside radial edge 167 and the second outside radial edge 168 meet at a point 169. Each upper major radial magnet portion has a hidden lower face (hidden in Fig. 15) directly below, opposite, and parallel to the exposed upper face, having approximately the same pentagonal shape as the exposed upper face. The upper exposed faces and the parallel hidden lower faces of the upper major radial magnet portions are all flux parallel faces.<br>
Each upper major radial magnet portion 163 and 186 has an inside radial face (hidden in Fig. 15), approximately rectangular in shape and extending downward from the inside radial edge 164 of the upper exposed face to the corresponding edge of the parallel hidden lower face.<br>
Opposite the inside radial face, each upper major radial magnet portion 163 and 186 has first and second outside radial faces (hidden in Fig. 15), approximately rectangular in shape and extending downward from the first and second outside radial edges 167 and 168, respectively, of the upper exposed face to the corresponding edges of the parallel hidden lower face.<br>
Each major radial permanent magnet portion is preferably formed, for example, with two straight cuts from a rectangular block permanent magnet. When formed in this manner, as perhaps best shown in Fig. 16, the inside radial faces of the upper major radial magnet portions 163 and 186 are flux entry faces. When formed in this manner, the magnetic flux lines exit at an angle from the first and second outside radial faces of each of the upper major radial magnet portions 163 and 186, so those faces are at least partially flux exit faces.<br>
-38-<br><br>
Alternatively, each major radial permanent magnet portion can be formed, for example, by joining two pieces along a line from the major radial magnet point 169 to the midpoint of the major radial magnet inside radial edge 164, possibly including a permeable slab at the junction between the two pieces. When formed in this manner, it is possible to align the magnetic vectors in each of the two pieces so that the magnetic flux lines exit perpendicularly from the first and second outside radial faces of the upper major radial magnet portions 163 and 186, so those faces are flux exit faces. When formed in this manner with the magnetic vectors in the two pieces so aligned, the inside radial face of the upper major radial magnet portion is at least partially a flux entry face since the lines of magnetic flux are at an angle to the inside radial faces.<br>
The permanent magnet assembly 160 preferably includes four upper minor radial permanent magnet portions 187, one upper minor radial permanent magnet portion 187 positioned adjacent to each of the first and second outside radial faces of each of the upper radial magnet portions 163 and 186, although this is not required. Each minor radial permanent magnet portion 187 can be formed, for example, as a rectangular block permanent magnet.<br>
If used, each upper minor radial permanent magnet portion 187 includes an inside radial face (not shown in Fig. 15) magnetically coupled to an outside radial face of an adjacent upper major radial magnet portion. Each upper minor radial permanent magnet portion 187 also includes an outside radial face (not shown in Fig. 15) opposite and substantially parallel to its inside radial face. As perhaps best shown in Fig. 16, the inside radial faces of the upper minor radial magnet portions 187 are flux entry faces, and the outside radial faces of each of the upper minor radial magnet portions 187 are flux exit faces.<br>
The upper portion of the permanent magnet assembly 160 includes a first upper axial permanent magnet portion 188 magnetically coupled to its adjacent upper minor radial permanent magnet portions 187, and a second upper axial permanent magnet portion 176 magnetically coupled to its<br>
-39-<br><br>
adjacent upper minor radial permanent magnet portions 187. Each upper axial permanent magnet portion is preferably formed as a V-shaped polyhedral solid and an axial magnetization vector (parallel to the axis of rotation 23). The permanent magnet assembly 160 includes similar lower axial permanent magnet portions 180 and 183.<br>
Each of the upper axial magnet portions 176 and 188 has an exposed upper face, preferably V-shaped, having two lateral edges 170 on each side, a first inside radial edge 189 and a second inside radial edge 190 which meet at an inside point 191, and a first outside radial edge 171 and a second outside radial edge 172 which meet at an outside point 173. Each upper axial permanent magnet portion can be formed, for example, of two pieces, where each piece is formed from a rectangular block permanent magnet with a single straight cut, and then joining the two pieces along their cut faces (along a line between the inside point 191 and the outside point 173) to form a V.<br>
Each upper axial magnet portion 176 and 188 has a hidden lower face (hidden in Fig. 15) directly below, opposite, and parallel to its exposed upper face, having approximately the same V-shape as the exposed upper face. The upper exposed face of the upper axial magnet portions 176 and<br>
188	are flux entry faces, and the lower faces of the upper axial magnet portions are flux exit faces.<br>
Each upper axial magnet portion 176 and 188 has a first inside radial face and a second inside radial face (hidden in Fig. 15), approximately rectangular in shape and extending downward from the first inside radial edge 189 and second inside radial edge 190, respectively, of the upper exposed face to the corresponding edge of the parallel hidden lower face.<br>
Opposite the first and second inside radial faces, each upper axial magnet portion 176 and 188 has first and second outside radial faces (hidden in Fig. 15), approximately rectangular in shape and extending downward from the first outside radial edge 171 and second outside radial edges 172, respectively, of the upper exposed face to the corresponding edges of the parallel hidden lower face.<br>
-40-<br><br>
Each upper axial magnet portion 176 and 188 also has first and second lateral faces (hidden in Fig. 15), approximately rectangular in shape and extending downward from the lateral edges 170 of the upper exposed face to the corresponding edges of the parallel hidden lower face. The inside radial faces, the outside radial faces, and the lateral faces of the upper axial magnet portions 176 and 188 are all flux parallel faces.<br>
Each upper axial magnet portion 176 and 188 is preferably at least partially surrounded by one or more upper lateral blocking magnets 174 and/or upper radial blocking magnets 175. The upper lateral blocking magnets 174 and/or upper radial blocking magnets 175, if used, are each preferably formed of a rectangular block magnet.<br>
If used, each upper lateral blocking magnet 174 preferably has an inside lateral face (not shown in Fig. 15) which is magnetically coupled to a lateral face of its adjacent upper axial magnet. Portions of the inside lateral face of each upper lateral blocking magnet 174 can also be magnetically coupled to portions of a lateral face of an adjacent upper minor radial magnet, although this is not required. The inside lateral face of each upper lateral blocking magnet 174 is opposite and substantially parallel to an exposed outside lateral face. The outside lateral face of each upper lateral blocking magnet 174 is a flux entry face, and the inside lateral face of each upper lateral blocking magnet is a flux exit face.<br>
If used, each upper radial blocking magnet 175 preferably has an inside radial face (not shown in Fig. 15) which is magnetically coupled to an outside radial face of its adjacent upper axial magnet Portions of the inside radial face of each upper radial blocking magnet 175 can also be magnetically coupled to portions of an adjacent upper lateral blocking magnet, although this is not required. The inside radial face of each upper radial blocking magnet 175 is opposite and substantially parallel to an exposed outside radial face. The outside radial face of each upper radial blocking magnet 175 is a flux entry face, and the inside radial face of each upper radial blocking magnet is a flux exit face.<br>
-41-<br><br>
The lower portion of the permanent magnet assembly 160 is similar to the upper portion of the permanent magnet assembly 160, with appropriate reversals of the magnetization vectors in the magnet portions. Like the upper portion, the lower portion of the permanent magnet assembly 160 includes a central permeable slab 162 surrounding the axis of rotation 23. Like the upper portion, the lower portion of the permanent magnet assembly 160 includes a first lower major radial magnet portion 177 and a second lower major radial magnet portion 178 on the sides of the central permeable slab 162. The lower major radial magnet portions 177 and 178 are located directly below the corresponding upper major radial magnet portions 163 and 186, respectively.<br>
As perhaps best shown in Fig. 16, the magnetization vectors in the lower major radial magnet portions 177 and 178 point in directions opposite to the magnetization vectors in the corresponding upper major radial magnet portions 163 and 186. Thus, the inside radial faces of the lower major radial magnet portions 177 and 178 are flux exit faces and the outside radial faces are flux entry faces. In the cross-section of Fig. 16, the magnetization vectors in the radial magnet portions 163, 186, 177, and 178 are not exactly parallel to the plane of the page, because the cross section is taken at the angle of the line 16-16 in Fig. 15, but the arrows in Fig. 16 show the general direction of the magnetization vectors.<br>
The lower portion of the permanent magnet assembly 160 preferably includes lower minor radial magnet portions 179 adjacent to the first major lower radial magnet portions 177 and 178. If used, the lower minor radial magnet portions 179 are directly below the corresponding upper minor radial magnet portions 187 of the upper portion of the permanent magnet assembly 160, having approximately the same square or rectangular shape, and preferably formed of a rectangular block permanent magnet but with opposite magnetic vectors.<br>
The lower portion of the permanent magnet assembly 160 includes a first lower axial permanent magnet portion 180 and a second lower axial permanent magnet portion 183, each magnetically coupled to its adjacent<br>
-42-<br><br>
lower minor radial permanent magnet portions 187. The first and second lower axial magnet portions 180 and 183 are directly below the corresponding first and second upper axial magnet portions 188 and 176, respectively, of the upper portion of the permanent magnet assembly 160, having approximately the same V-shape, and preferably formed in the same fashion. As perhaps best shown in Fig. 16, the magnetization vectors of the lower axial magnet portions 180 and 183 and the upper axial magnet portions 188 and 176 are all axial (parallel to the axis of rotation 23), and all in the same direction.<br>
Each lower axial magnet portion 180 and 183 is preferably at least partially surrounded by one or more lower lateral blocking magnets 181 and/or lower radial blocking magnets 182. If used, the lower lateral blocking magnets 181 are directly below the corresponding upper lateral blocking magnets 174 of the upper portion of the permanent magnet assembly 160, having approximately the same square or rectangular shape, and preferably formed of a rectangular block permanent magnet, but with opposite magnetic vectors. If used, the lower radial blocking magnets 182 are directly below the corresponding upper radial blocking magnets 175 of the upper portion of the permanent magnet assembly 160, having approximately the same square or rectangular shape, and preferably formed of a rectangular block permanent magnet, but with opposite magnetic vectors.<br>
Fig. 16 is a cross-sectional view of the permanent magnet assembly of Fig. 15 taken along the line 16-16 thereof. The cross-sectional view of Fig. 16 shows how a first magnetic flux loop is formed by the first lower axial magnet portion 180, the lower minor radial magnet portions 179, the first lower major radial magnet portion 177, the central axial magnet 161, the first upper major radial magnet portion 163, the upper minor radial magnet portions 187, the first upper axial magnet portion 188, and a first air gap at high magnetic field 184. A second magnetic flux loop is formed by the second lower axial magnet portion 183, the lower minor radial magnet portions 179, the second lower major radial magnet portion 178, the central axial magnet 161, the second upper major radial magnet portion 186, the upper minor<br>
-43-<br><br>
radial magnet portions 187, the second upper axial magnet portion 176, and a second air gap at high magnetic field 185.<br>
Although not required, the lateral blocking magnet portions 174 and 181, and the radial blocking magnet portions 175 and 182, concentrate the magnetic flux through the gaps 184 and 185, and help reduce stray field leaking into the nearby low field regions on each side of the permanent magnet assembly 160 (offset 90 degrees from the air gaps at high magnetic field 184 and 185). This also helps to ensure a sharp field decay away from the air gaps at high magnetic field 184 and 185 by forcing any stray flux outside the diameter of the annular region swept by rotation of the permanent magnet assembly 109.<br>
There are various possibilities with regard to alternative embodiments and applications of a permanent magnet assembly according to the invention. Although the exemplary embodiments of the present invention refer to specific materials, other materials known to those skilled in the art as having suitable properties can be appropriately substituted.<br>
A variety of structures can be used in a permanent magnet assembly according to the invention. For example, the permanent magnets shown in the illustrative embodiments herein may each comprise a single permanent magnet, or one or more of these permanent magnet sections may be a composite structure comprised of one or more multiple permanent magnets and one or more sections of magnetically permeable material.<br>
For example, one or more rectangular permanent magnet sections may be operatively coupled to an arc-shaped pole piece to obtain a structure which is the equivalent of an arc-shaped permanent magnet section. The permanent magnets shown in the illustrative embodiments may also include one or more sections of magnetically impermeable material, for example to provide structural support, containment, or protection.<br>
The flow of magnetic flux through a permanent magnet assembly according to the invention can be directed in a variety of ways as known to those skilled in the art Although the permanent magnet sections shown in the illustrative embodiments herein may be magnetically coupled through<br>
-44-<br><br>
direct contact, magnetic coupling of two permanent magnets can also be achieved using a section of magnetically permeable material to join the two permanent magnets. Similarly, magnetic coupling of a permanent magnet section and a section formed of magnetically permeable material, such as a pole piece or sheath, can be accomplished through direct contact or indirectly using a section of magnetic material. As used in this disclosure and in the claims, the phrase “magnetically coupled” means to connect, directly or indirectly via magnetically permeable material so that at least a portion of the magnetic flux flows between two points.<br>
Although the illustrative embodiments may show pole pieces, blocking magnets, flux containment jackets, or flux containment sheaths formed as unitary structures, these structures may be comprised of individual sections which are operatively coupled together. For example, individual sections can be placed in direct contact or they can be joined with magnetically permeable material.<br>
Similarly, the relative dimensions, shapes, and positions of the permanent magnet sections, pole pieces, blocking magnets, flux containment jackets, or flux containment sheaths can be optimized for a particular application. For example, these structures can include one or more chamfers or filled-in corners to optimize flux return while minimizing stray flux, assembly weight, and rotational moment of inertia.<br>
Although the exemplary embodiments of the present invention herein may show permanent magnet sections or portions positioned adjacent to an air gap without any intermediate components, this is not required. For example, one or more pole faces formed of magnetically permeable material may be positioned between the permanent magnet sections or portions and the air gap in order to direct or concentrate the magnetic flux through the air gap. Pole faces formed of magnetically permeable material may be especially useful to provide an air gap having precise dimensions, as precise machining of magnetically permeable material is generally preferred to precise machining of permanent magnet material.<br>
-45-<br><br>
Although the surfaces of faces surrounding the air gap at high magnetic field, such as pole faces, are shown herein as essentially planar, this is not required and other shapes may be used. For example, some applications of a permanent magnet assembly according to the invention could include pole faces having concave or convex shapes. Thus, the cross-section of the air gap at high magnetic field can include, but not be limited to, a rectangle (including but not limited to a square), a parallelogram, a trapezoid, a circle, an oval, or near)y any other shape or combination of shapes.<br>
Although particular structures and portions of the embodiments described herein are referred to using the terms “upper,” “lower,” “Vertical,” and “horizontal,” and the like, it is understood that those terms are used in reference to the exemplary orientations shown in the drawings herein. It is understood that a permanent magnet assembly according to the invention can be used in any orientation, and the use of a particular term such as “vertical” or “horizontal” is used to describe the relationship between particular structures and portions of the embodiments described herein and not to limit those structures or portions of the embodiments to any particular orientation or frame of reference.<br>
The exemplary embodiments herein are described as being adapted to rotate about an axis whereby the permanent magnet assembly provides a gap at high magnetic field that sweeps an annular region, to thereby apply a time-varying magnetic field to the annular region. By rotating the permanent magnet assembly, a time-varying magnetic field can be applied to a structure located within the annular region, such as a ring of beds containing magnetocaloric materials. In this fashion, a rotating permanent magnet assembly according to the invention can be combined with stationary magnetocaloric materials for use in a rotating magnet magnetic refrigerator.<br>
However, it should be understood that a permanent magnet according to the invention can also be used in a stationary configuration, wherein an annular structure, such as a ring of beds containing magnetocaloric materials, is adapted to rotate relative to the permanent<br>
-46-<br><br>
magnet assembly. In this fashion, a stationary permanent magnet assembly according to the invention can be combined with rotating magnetocaloric materials for use in a rotating bed magnetic refrigerator.<br>
Of course, a permanent magnet assembly according to the invention can also be used in a configuration in which both the permanent magnet assembly and the magnetocaloric materials rotate, in opposite directions or in the same direction at different angular velocities. Similarly, a permanent magnet assembly according to the invention can be used in a configuration in which either or both of the permanent magnet assembly or the magnetocaloric materials oscillate back and forth or otherwise move relative to each other.<br>
It is understood that the invention is not limited to the particular embodiments described herein, but embraces all such modified forms thereof as come within the scope of the following claims.<br>
