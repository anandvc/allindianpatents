				<td>System, method and apparatus for Federated Single<br>
Sign-On services<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to Single Sign-On services that can be offered for a plurality of users. More particularly,, the invention pertains to means, system and methods for offering Single Sign-On web-based services for a plurality of users that are subscribers of Mobile Network Operator networks.<br>
BACKGROUND	<br>
[0002] The advent of web services has brought with them a new service that allows users to access said web services in an easy and convenient manner, the so-called Single Sign-On (SSO). The current SSO principle states that users shall be able to authenticate once and shall be given access to all' their subscribed services that accept such level of authentication. This principle focuses on end-user convenience while leaving open the capabilities of terminals and networks when implementing the SSO. Thus, the current trends address two approaches for carrying out the SSO principle.<br>
[0003] In a first approach, namely a "terminal-centric" approach, the user authenticates once to the terminal that in turn automatically tracks a service-oriented network access and transparently presents, that is, without further user involvement, the appropriate credentials to the service-oriented network that requests such credentials.<br>
[0004] In a second approach, namely a "network-centric" approach, the user authenticates once to an Authentication<br>
Provider (AP) in a network that in turn handles the appropriate credentials for the services.<br>
[0005] The so-called "network-centric" approach is suitable when domain trust relationships exist among authentication providers and service providers, whereas the terminal-centric approach is useful when such relationships do not exist and the "terminal can track the authentication towards disparate domains or services.<br>
[0006] It is also possible to combine both approaches. A network operator may issue credentials such as digital certificates, short-time certificates, or temporary tickets or tokens that may be stored in the terminal or in an accessible read/write card. These are further used by the user upon authentication or authorization procedures.<br>
[0007] Conventional cellular operators use authentication services to grant subscribers accesses to voice and data services provided by such operators. As cellular operators move up in the value chain, they could leverage their mutual trust relationship with their own subscribers in order to play a new role of Authentication Providers for their respective subscriber population in emerging business models in which service domain and authentication services belong to different administrative entities. In this respect, an operator that is able to provide both accesses, namely IP connectivity and services, might additionally offer to its subscribers an "access authentication SSO" so that an authentication performed at the access level might be valid as authentication in a service domain. This is a relevant starting point for further disclosing the objects of the present invention.<br>
[0008] More precisely, the relationship between a service domain and an authentication provider,  as well as the<br>
services that a user may be offered, must be taken into account for discussing advantages and disadvantages of the above approaches. Generally speaking, an Authentication Provider may belong to the same administrative domain as the Service Provider offering the service, or may be delegated to an external trusted party or to a distributed federation.<br>
[0009] A primary object of the present invention is the support of Single Sign-On (SSO) services for subscribers of-a Federation-of Mobile Network Operators (MNO), subscribers who are users of different Service Providers (SP) . Said SSO services are supported in such a manner that users, Federation of Mobile Network Operators, ' and Service Providers holding agreements with at least one member of such Federation, all get additional advantages and value added, services from a given architectural and business reference model in accordance with this invention.<br>
[0010]   More specifically, the users have the advantage<br>
of the SSO service for accessing any service at any Service<br>
Provider  (SP) within the reference model agreement. The<br>
Mobile Network Operators  (MNO)  may obtain revenues by<br>
offering SSO services, in particular authentication and<br>
authorization,  to  third  parties  as  well  as  keeping<br>
subscribers loyalty by adding value to their respective<br>
mobile subscriptions. Eventually, the Service Providers may<br>
experience an increase of potential users, namely mobile<br>
subscribers, with a simpler and much safer authentication<br>
and authorization mechanisms minimizing the support for<br>
different such mechanisms depending on the different nature<br>
of users.  In this scenario Authentication Provider and<br>
Service  Provider  belong  to  different  administrative<br>
domains. At the same time, these distributed advantages<br>
favor an increase of a so-called mobile commerce  (m-<br>
commerce), which can be regarded as a further object of the present invention.<br>
RELATED ART<br>
[0011] The "network-centric" approach, as above described, seems to be more suitable for scenarios involving users of Service Providers who- are also subscribers of Mobile Network Operators, the latter wanting to play the role of Authentication Providers. However, the closest known prior art is herein discussed with reference to SSO services in a generic network-centric approach independently of the type of the network acting as Authentication Provider.<br>
[0012] For instance, U.S. Patent Application Publication US 2002/0010776 Al to Lerner describes methods and systems for providing a Single Sign-On (SSO) distributed application services integration for authentication and authorization services. The relevant teaching in this application starts when a first indication from a user, who is pointing a browser of a first application, is received at a central server coupled to the user terminal. Then, a cookie file corresponding to the user is also received at the central server from the browser of the first application. The central server, then, updates the cookie file received from the browser.<br>
[0013] A cookie file is a data segment of variable length and typically including hundreds of bytes. These cookies are written, read and modified by an application interface library resident in each affiliated web server, whether local to the central server or residing in a remote partner's site. More specifically, the updating of a received cookie file includes the comparison of the cookie<br>
file with some predetermined parameters and the eventual modification of the cookie file based on this comparison.<br>
[0014] When a second indication from the user is received at the central server indicating that the user is pointing the server to a second application, the central server provides this updated cookie file to the second application.<br>
[0015]   This patent application  states  that the above application interface library, which is responsible for writing,  reading  and  modifying  the  cookie  files,  is configured  for  also  authenticating  users  among  other applications. Consequently, one of ordinary skill in the art would readily recognize that authentication data and corresponding functions for all the users reside in each affiliated web server, at local or remote partner's sites, what is an additional disadvantage for administration. Specifically,  particular  actions  are  taken  at '  any application in an affiliated web server, which browser is pointed by the user, with regard to the authentication of such user even though the user has got the benefit of an SSO service. Thus, one may see this mechanism as an example of a scenario wherein Authentication Provider and Service Provider belong to the same administrative domain.<br>
[0016] The above teaching does not seem to be applicable for large telecommunication systems comprising a Federation of Mobile Network Operators, a plurality of different Service Providers that have likely signed agreements with at least one member of the Federation, and a huge amount of potential users who are mobile subscribers of any member of the Federation.<br>
[0017] Moreover, given that the subscriber authentication data and algorithms are quite sensitive information, the<br>
MNO are very reluctant to spread this information through entities outside their own premises.<br>
[0018] Another significant instance of methods and system for Single Sign-On user access is described in the European patent application EP-1089516 to Grandcolas et al. wherein users may gain access to multiple web servers.<br>
[0019]   This  application  describes  how  a  user  is authenticated at a first web server that allows the user to select a second web server offering a desirable service. When the user effectively selects the second web server, the first web server constructs an encrypted authentication token,  and transmits it to the second web server.  The second web server authenticates the received token and allows the user to have a session at this second web server.  Both  first  and  second  web  server  share,  in accordance with this application, a sub-domain. That is, the scenario in this application is an instance where the Authentication Provider, namely the first web server, and the Service' Provider, namely the second web server, both belong to the same administrative domain.<br>
[0020] Thereby, the teaching in this application cannot be applied to scenarios where Authentication Provider and Service Provider belong to different administrative domains. That is, the first web server in this application, the Authentication Provider, is the first contact for the user accessing the second web server where the service is offered.<br>
[0021] Consequently, this approach does not seem to be convenient for commercial use in scenarios where the Authentication Provider and Service Provider belong to different administrative domains. In such scenarios a user directly accesses  a  Service Provider that requests an<br>
Authentication Authority to authenticate the user and, once such authentication has been successfully carried out, the Authentication Authority authorizes the Service Provider to offer the selected service for that user.<br>
[0022] A known solution nowadays, representative of a scenario where Authentication Provider and Service Provider belong to different administrative and commercial domains is the Microsoft ® .NET Passport product (as described in http://www.passport.com and hereinafter simply referred to as ".NET Passport"). This product is intended to build up a broader Internet trust network with a common set of technical and operational guidelines open" to any organization supporting the corresponding standards.<br>
[0023] However, this approach does not solve the problem of building up a Federation of Mobile Network Operators to be responsible for the Authentication of its own mobile subscribers accessing Service Providers that are associated to at least one member of such Federation. Moreover, an approach like the .NET Passport, which is intended to become a very large Internet authentication system, is a close solution based on a centralized authentication authority not offering any advantageous deal to the Mobile Network Operators and subscribers.<br>
[0024] Thereby, an important object of the present invention is the provision of a system, means and methods for building up a Federation of Mobile Network Operators (MN0) acting as an authentication authority towards associated Service Providers (SP) offering Single Sign-On (SS0) services to the subscribers of any MNO in the Federation. It is another object of the present invention that the Federation acting as an authentication authority thus accomplishes security and privacy related requirements at a same or higher level than those currently used by<br>
Mobile Network Operators. It is a further object of the present  invention  to  establish  an  architectural  and business  reference model  in regard to  actors,  roles, relationships and basic use cases in conformity with the system, means and methods of the above objects.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0025] The above objects, among other things, are accomplished in accordance with the invention by the provision of a system, method and apparatus for providing Single Sign-On services to a user accessing selected Service Providers, the user having subscription with a first mobile network operator.<br>
[0026] The telecommunication system comprising a first mobile network that belongs to a first mobile network operator, at least one second mobile network that belongs to a second mobile network operator, and at least one of a plurality of Service Providers for providing services to subscribers of said mobile network operators once the subscribers have been authenticated for the at least one Service Provider by an authentication authority-<br>
[0027] In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, the first mobile network operator and the at least one second mobile network operator both conform or belong to a cellular Federation of mobile network operators that acts as the authentication authority.<br>
[0028] Moreover, the system comprises an Authentication Provider belonging to the first mobile network as the only member of the Federation entitled to authenticate the user toward the at least one Service Provider; and an Authentication Broker belonging to a second mobile network and arranged to act as the entry point to the Federation<br>
from those Service Providers having an agreement with the second mobile network operator for such purpose. Herein, an agreement of this type is referred to as an "entry point" agreement.<br>
[0029]  That is,  the telecommunication system comprises means, for redirecting a user accessing a Service Provider,<br>
the user having a subscription with a first mobile network operator, toward an Authentication Broker of a second mobile network operator having such agreement with the Service Provider, and means for redirecting the user accessing the Authentication Broker toward an Authentication Provider of the user's Home first mobile network operator. In addition, the telecommunication system comprises means for performing a user's Home resolution at the Authentication Broker for allowing the Service Provider to request validation of an authentication assertion for that user from the Authentication Provider belonging to the first mobile network.<br>
[0030]   In particular, the telecommunication system allows<br>
the Authentication Provider of the first mobile network<br>
operator to be directly accessed,  without involving an<br>
Authentication Broker, from those Service Providers having<br>
such agreement with the first mobile network operator. To<br>
this end, the telecommunication system further comprises<br>
means for redirecting a user accessing a Service Provider<br>
toward an Authentication Provider of the user's Home first<br>
mobile network, without involving an Authentication Broker,<br>
the Service Provider having such agreement with the Home<br>
first mobile  network operator.  Moreover,  such  Service<br>
Provider  may  request  validation  of  an  authentication<br>
assertion for that user from said Authentication Provider<br>
without involving an Authentication Broker.<br>
[0031] Generally, the above system comprises means for issuing a Single Sign-On authentication request from a user accessing a Service Provider toward an Authentication Provider in the cellular Federation responsible for authenticating the user for that Service Provider, the user being a subscriber of the cellular Federation, and means for presenting a received authentication artifact to the Service Provider.<br>
[0032] A method is also proposed by the present invention for providing Single Sign-On services to a user accessing selected Service Providers, the user having subscription with a first mobile network operator, and each selected Service Provider being associated with a second mobile network operator. This method comprises the steps of:<br>
(a)	establishing an authentication trust relationship between the first and the second mobile network operators, thus forming a Federation of mobile network operators;<br>
(b)	redirecting an access request generated by said user from the selected Service Provider toward the cellular network of said. first mobile network operator;<br>
(c)	generating at an Authentication Provider of said first mobile network operator, where the user's access request is redirected, an authentication assertion valid for said user accessing said Service Provider, and returning an artifact for said assertion back to said user;<br>
(d)	requesting verification of said authentication assertion, included in the artifact presented by the  user,  from  the  Service  Provider  to  the<br>
Authentication  Provider  of  said  first  mobile network operator; and<br>
(e) accepting service access to the user upon receipt of a successful verification response at the Service Provider.<br>
[0033] In both, the above telecommunication system and method, a user is identified between an Authentication Provider and a Service Provider with a shared identity, independently of the authentication identity used between the user and the Authentication Provider in the cellular Federation, and independently of the user identity used between the user and the Service Provider.<br>
[0034]  Within  the  telecommunication  system  and  also taking  active part  in the above method,  there  is  an Authentication Broker comprising first interfacing means for communicating with a user having subscription with a first mobile network operator, and second interfacing means for communicating with a Service Provider associated with a second mobile network operator. These first and second interfacing means can be regarded as forming a broker channel for enabling the Authentication Broker to redirect the user to the user's Home network, and to resolve the user's Home network for the Service Provider, respectively. Such Authentication Broker may comprise a Web Front End that includes the above first and second interfacing means with user and Service Provider, respectively. In addition, the Authentication Broker further comprises storage for all the Authentication Providers in the cellular Federation on a per mobile network operator basis, each mobile network operator included in the cellular Federation, and means for retrieving from storage user's Home related addressing data. Moreover, the Authentication Broker Web Front End , further   comprises . means   for  offering  Public  Key<br>
Infrastructure services to those Service Providers associated with the mobile network operator owning the Authentication Broker in order to accomplish the security and privacy requirements of the cellular Federation, thus accomplishing another object of the present invention.<br>
[0035] Also within the telecommunication system and taking active part in the above method,  there  is  an<br>
Authentication Provider comprising a front channel and a<br>
back channel.<br>
[0036] The front channel of this Authentication Provider includes a Web Front End that comprises first interfacing means for-enabling an authentication session between a user and said Authentication Provider. This front channel further comprises a Session Manager and storage for handling session status for the user, and a Front End Authentication server for carrying ' out a specific authentication mechanism for the user.<br>
[0037] The back channel of this Authentication Provider includes a Protocol Binding that comprises second interfacing means for exchanging information related to user authentication assertion between said Authentication Provider and a Service Provider that the user is accessing. This back channel further comprises a Security Assertion Mark-up Language engine for generating an authentication assertion for a user, and storage for authentication assertions. In addition, there is also provided inter-working means between front channel and back channel for generating and storing an authentication assertion for a user.<br>
[0038] As a further advantage of having the above system, method, and apparatus, namely the Authentication Broker and the Authentication Provider, there is provided a method of<br>
doing  business  wherein  at  least  two  mobile  network operators conform to or are otherwise part of a Federation of  mobile  network  operators,   thus  establishing  an authentication trust relationship in the Federation for supporting Single Sign-On services.  The Federation acts as an authentication authority toward those Service Providers offering  services  to  subscribers of  mobile  network operators included in the Federation, each Service Provider being associated with a federated mobile network operator for accessing such Federation. In this method for doing business, each mobile network operator contributes with its own network and the services provided by its associated Service   Providers,   each   network   comprising   an Authentication Provider for authenticating subscribers of such network and an Authentication Broker for redirecting the  associated  Service  Providers  to an Authentication Provider responsible for authenticating a given user in the Federation.  Moreover,  each  Service  Provider  in  this business  method  is  arranged for  offering  services  to subscribers of any mobile network operator included in the Federation. The Service Provider may access the Federation through a well known Authentication Broker of a mobile network operator having such agreement with the Service Provider  and  thus  having  an  authentication  trust relationship with the Federation.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0053] The following describes currently preferred embodiments of means, methods and system for building up a<br>
Federation of Mobile Network Operators (MNO) acting as an authentication authority towards associated Service Providers (SP) offering services to the subscribers of any MNO in the Federation. These preferred embodiments are described in conformity with an architectural and business reference model provided by the invention in terms of actors, roles, relationships and basic use cases.<br>
[0054] In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a cellular Federation for Single sign-On (FSSQ) services. The Fig. 1 presents the architectural and business reference model described above in terms of actors, roles, relationships and some exemplary use cases in respect of a first Federation (FSSO-1).<br>
[0055] Actors in the reference model in Fig. 1 are Users (User@MNO-A, User@MN0-C), Service Providers (SP-1, SP-2) and subscribers Home Site, the latter being Mobile Network Operators (MNO-A, MNO-B, MNO-C) holding the subscriber subscriptions. For the purpose of the present invention, a User is a mobile subscriber provided with a Subscriber Identity Module or with a WAP Identity Module (SIM/WIM) and with a web/wap browser; a Service Provider is the target where a service requested by a User resides"; and a Home Site is a Mobile Network Operator holding the subscription of the User.<br>
[0056] Roles played in the reference model in Fig. 1 are Users (User@MNO-A, User@MN0-C) , Destination site, Authentication Broker  (AB)  and Authentication Provider<br>
(AP) . A User is in this context a Client requesting a service from an SP; a Destination Site is a site capable of . delivering a given service to a Client, in general an SP though an MNO may also play this role for some services; an Authentication Broker (1, 2) is a member of the Federation (FSSO-1) intended for acting as the entrance point to the<br>
Federation for associated SP' s (SP-1, SP-2); and an Authentication Provider (4, 5, 6) is a member of the Federation (FSSO-1) intended for owning user data and the only one able to authenticate and provide user information to the Destination Site. In particular, an SP (SP-1, SP-2) always accesses (S-100, S-200) the Federation through its associated AB (1, 2). For the sake of simplicity, SP's are not considered members of the Federation, being thus referred to as associated entities.<br>
[0057]  From a business perspective, each particular MNO (MNO-A, MNO-B, MNO-C)  does not only contribute to the Federation with its own cellular network but also with a number of associated SP's (SP-1, SP-2) with which it has signed particular agreements. These associated SP's may always access  (S-100, S-200) to the. Federation via the Authentication Broker (1, 2) of a particular MNO (MNO-A, MNO-B) with which each SP (SP-1, SP-2) has signed such agreement. This is particularly important, because cellular operators may want to keep established business agreements with SP's after joining or building a Federation (FSSO-1, FSSO-2). Furthermore, a network operator can leverage the services of respective SP's in markets where they have strong positions, which would be the case for a cellular multinational federation where service providers tend to sign Service Level Agreements (SLA) with local operators.<br>
[0058] The rationale behind this reference model from a business perspective relies on the fact that it gives equal opportunity to cellular operators when building or joining the Federation, because a federation member always plays the role of - authentication provider towards its own subscribers. Additionally, though not necessarily, a federation member may also play the role of authentication<br>
broker  towards  subscribers  from other members  of  the Federation for its associated SP's.<br>
[0059] More specifically, an Authentication Broker (1, 2) is responsible for resolving the user's Home Site. That is, the AB is in charge of providing an associated SP with enough information to enable the exchange of user data between the MNO holding the subscription of a user and the SP. Once the user's Home Site has been resolved, the AB is able to redirect the user to the user's Home Site. In addition and optionally, an AB may offer Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) services to its associated SP's in order to accomplish security and privacy requirements characteristic of the Mobile Network Operators.<br>
[0060]  Different relationships in the reference model in Fig. 1 deserve particular explanations prior to further describing architectural entities and interfaces, and the rationale behind currently preferred embodiments. In this respect,  a user  (User@MN0-A)  (User@MNO-C)  has a trust relationship  (R-110,  R-120)  (R-320)  with his Home Site (MNO-A)  (MNO-C) . When the user is registered with an SP (SP-1) (SP-2), there is a direct trust relationship (R-110) (R-120, R-320) as well between both the user (User@MNO-A) (User@MNO-C) and the SP (SP-1)  (SP-2) . For the sake of clarity and in order to simplify the relationships between SP's and the Federation, it has been considered that each SP (SP-1)  (SP-2) has a single trust relationship (S-100) (S-200) with one and only one federation member, namely an AB (1)  (2), of a Mobile Network Operator (MNO-A)  (MNO-B) with which the SP has signed a business agreement.<br>
[0061] Therefore, when a user (User@MNO-A, User@MNO-C) wants to use a cellular SSO service at a given SP (SP-1, SP-2), the SP automatically redirects the user's request via the SP's entrance point to the cellular .federation,<br>
namely an AB (1, 2) , to a site in the federation, namely an AP (4, 6), that can properly handle the user's request. This avoids the SP making complex decisions as to where the user should be redirected. This also substantially simplifies the interaction between an SP and the Federation, minimizing impacts on the SP's and thus increasing their willingness to associate with the Federation. In a more general and actual scenario an SP (SP-2) may have a trust relationship with different federations like, for example, a cellular federation (FSSO-1) and an e-bank federation (FSSO-2).<br>
[0062]   In another embodiment of the present invention, an<br>
SP (SP-1) associated with a particular MNO (MNO-A) does not<br>
need go through an AB (1) of such MNO for accessing the AP<br>
(4)  in the MNO holding the subscription for the user<br>
(User@MN0-A) who has requested a service in such SP (SP-1).<br>
This is especially advantageous for a trust relationship<br>
(R-110) between a MNO (MNO-A) and an associated SP (SP-1),<br>
and,  in  particular,  it  optimizes  network  access  and<br>
performance.<br>
[0063] Notwithstanding this another embodiment, and generally speaking, all Home Sites that want to play the role of Authentication Broker have a trust relationship with all the federation members because they also are members of the Federation. As explained above, an SP is able to redirect all users to its entry point, namely a cellular operator (MNO) or a Home Site, within the cellular Federation. Therefore, the Authentication Broker (AB) needs to know about all federated Home Sites.<br>
[0064] .However, an AB does not normally know the users of each Home Site of the Federation, since this requires each AB being able to populate all users of the Federation, what requires  the  provision  of  additional means  for  users<br>
capacity and availability control. Nevertheless, by reading throughout the currently preferred embodiments described in accordance with the invention, it will be appreciated that a unique or reduced number of AB (1, 2) provided with these additional means for users capacity and availability control, as well as with database facilities for a huge amount of subscribers, may be suitable for a certain type of cellular Federation. For example, such Cellular Federation might be a Federation comprising a plurality of national MNO's belonging to a global corporation with facilities spread across the world.<br>
[0065] Two main representative use cases may be described with reference to the scenario presented in Fig. 1 and for which more precise details are further explained in exemplary embodiments from an architectural point of view.<br>
[0066]  A first use case may be  a user  (User@MN0-A) accessing a certain Service Provider (SP-1), such as for instance a Bookstore Service Provider, wherein the Service Provider  (SP-1)  is  associated  with  the  cellular  SSO Federation (FSSO-1) through a particular mobile network operator such as MNO-A. As shown in Fig. 2, the process followed to authenticate such user and to authorize such service starts when a subscriber of an MNO-A (User@MNO-A) requests access (C-21) to a Bookstore Service Provider (SP-1). Given that this SP has a business agreement with MNO-A, and thereby with the cellular Federation that MNO-A belongs to (FSSO-1) , the SP-1 redirects (C-22) the request to the MNO-A Home site. Upon reception at the MNO-A Home Site of the user's request for accessing the SP service (C-23), the user presents his own MNO-A identity, for example with a cookie. At this point two possible embodiments, already commented  upon,  may be  applicable.  More  particularly, either  the  MNO-A  acting  as  an  Authentication  Broker<br>
internally determines that MNO-A is also the Authentication Provider for that user, or else AB and AP at the MNO-A are both involved as in a more general use case, as described hereafter.<br>
[0067]   Provided that the user had not been authenticated yet at MNO-A, the authentication procedure is performed. If the user was already authenticated, he presents a cookie to MNO-A for allowing MNO-A to check the status of a given user's session.   The authentication is not specific for each SP unless the SP requests a specific authentication mechanism  to  be  performed.  MNO-A  creates  (C-24)  an authentication  assertion  for  that  user  specifically addressed to the SP. Then, an artifact referring to the user's  authentication  assertion  likely including  other authentication information is sent back (C-25) to the user. Artifacts are of one time usage and only valid for the specific SP they are addressed to. The user on its own presents  (C-26) this artifact to the SP-1. The SP then verifies that the source of the artifact is valid and requests   (C-27)   the  referred  user's  authentication assertion to the Home site (MNO-A) . The MNO-A sends back (C-28) the complete user's assertion with the required user data including at least authentication information. The SP-1 thus  analyses  the user's  assertion and trusts  the authentication performed by the user's Home Site (MNO-A). Eventually,  the SP-1 informs  (C-29) the user about the service access acceptance.<br>
[0068] A second use case may be a user (User@MNO-A) accessing a certain Service Provider (SP-2), such as for instance a Travel Agency Service Provider. Said Service Provider (SP-2) is thus associated with the cellular SSO Federation (FSSO-1) through a particular cellular operator such as MNO-B, whereas the user is a subscriber of another<br>
cellular operator (MNO-A) also member of the Federation. As shown in Fig. 3, the process followed to authenticate such user and to authorize such service starts when a subscriber of an MNO-A  (User@MNO-A)  requests  access  (C-21)  to  a Service Provider like a Travel Agency Service Provider (SP-2) for example. This SP-2 has a business agreement with MNO-B to offer SSO services to its users and to the users of the other members of the cellular Federation (MNO-A, MNO-C). When the SP-2 receives (C-21) the user's request for SSO, the SP-2 redirects (C-22) the request to the MNO-B site, since said MNO-B is the single point of entrance for this SP to the Federation. Thus, MNO-B plays the role of Authentication Broker in this use case and receives (C-33) a user's redirection from the SP-2. For the sake of SP simplicity, the SP does not know all home sites of the Federation and therefore no information about the user's Home Site is passed in the redirection message. Next, the MNO-B requests (C-34) the user's Home Site name. It has been considered in this reference model that the user identity is only known at his Home Site. An alternative is the  sharing  of  user  identities  within  the  cellular Federation, however, this leads to the need of huge central directories with corresponding management tasks.<br>
[0069] In response to request (C-34) the user answers back (C-35) with his Home domain name to MNO-B site, namely to the current Authentication Broker (2). Then, the Authentication Broker (AB) redirects (C-36) the user to his Home Site, that is, MNO-A. Following this, the user requests access (C-23) for the SP-2 to his Home Site. In like manner to the previous use case, if the user is not authenticated yet at MNO-A, the authentication procedure is performed (C-24) and an artifact referring to the user's assertion with the authentication information is sent back (C-25) to the user. At this point, the user is able to<br>
present (C-26) this artifact to the SP-2. Then, the SP-2 must verify the source of the artifact and resolve the user's home. The SP-2 requests (C-37) this information from the AB (2). The AB (2) sends back (C-38) the user's Home resolution response so that the SP-2 can contact (C-27) the user's Home Site (MNO-A) to get the referred user's assertion. MNO-A sends back (C-28) the complete user's assertion with the required user data including at least authentication information. Then, the SP-2 analyses the user's assertion and trusts the authentication performed by the user's Home Site. Eventually, the SP-2 allows (C-29) the user to access the service.<br>
[0070] After having presented an overview of the architectural and business reference model in terms of actors, roles, trust relationships, and some exemplary use cases, illustrated in Fig. 1 to Fig. 3, further detailed embodiments may be introduced in respect of a preferred architecture suitable for supporting Federated Single Sign-On (FSSO) services at each Mobile Network Operator (MNO) included in a Federation of a plurality of MNO's.<br>
[0071] Such architecture is described with reference to the external interfaces between Federation members, Service Providers and Users. These interfaces include an interface between a User, or rather a User Equipment (UE) , and the Authentication Broker (hereinafter UE-AB i/f); another interface between the User or UE and the Authentication Provider (hereinafter UE-AP i/f); another interface between the Service Provider and the Authentication Provider (hereinafter SP-AP i/f); and another interface between the Service Provider and the Authentication Broker (hereinafter SP-AB i/f).<br>
[0072]  These interfaces, or combinations thereof, provide channels for communicating between the different entities<br>
involved, internal and external to the Federation. These channels, depicted in Fig. 4, provide the bases for a suitable architecture.<br>
. [0073] Thus, the UE-AB i/f allows the AB to redirect the user to the AP responsible for his authentication. This interface supports such redirection, for example, by the user providing the AP name to the AB and the AB translating it to an entrance point in the AP site. Anyone skilled in the art would easily appreciate other approaches or techniques to achieve a similar result. This communication interface is part of the so-called "Broker Channel (AB) " (1, 2) in the Home Site.<br>
[0074] The UE-AP i/f supports an authentication session between both actors, the User and the Authentication 1 Provider (4, 5, 6). Once authenticated, the User is redirected to the SP with a sort of token or credentials. This communication interface is referred to as the "Front Channel (AP)" (4') in the Home Site.<br>
[0075] The SP-AP i/f is mainly used to exchange user information like authentication, attributes, authorization, and assertions. This communication is transparent to the user, and hereinafter referred to as the "Back Channel (AP)" (4") in the Home Site.<br>
[0076] The SP-AB i/f supports the establishment of the back channel wherein, for example, the AB translates the source ID contained in the artifact to an entrance point in the user's AP or PKI support. This interface is also part of the so-called "Broker Channel (AB)" (1, 2) in the Home Site.<br>
[0077] Thus, Fig. 4 also shows functional components that an MNO may support in order to become an AP and an AB in an<br><br>
F-SSO solution. As shown in this drawing, the architecture can be regarded as comprising a Front Channel,  a Back Channel and a Broker Channel view. Thus, an Authentication Provider (4, 5, 6) may be regarded as comprising a Front Channel (4') and a Back Channel (4"). The Front Channel is intended for controlling the authentication of a user and for managing a master session between the user and the AP. A significant amount of the control logic needed to deploy the F-SSO service is located in the entities of the front channel. The Back Channel is intended for handling a direct communication between the SP and the AP for exchanging user information.  The  Broker  Channel  is  responsible  for supporting the address resolution needs of the SP and the user.<br>
[0078] Regarding the aforementioned master session, additional detailed considerations have to be introduced regarding sessions handling. In this respect, when a user requests an F-SSO service, several sessions need to be created and maintained as follows:<br>
-	A Master session between the user and the AP. Once	the AP authenticates a user, the AP creates-- a session	and leaves an encrypted cookie in the user's browser	for subsequent authentication queries.<br>
-	A Service session between the user and the SP in order to be able to make use of services offered at the SP. Cookies might also be used for this session management.<br>
[0079] The AP needs to keep track of the Service sessions established between users and each SP. For this reason, in accordance with an aspect of the present invention and as shown in Fig. 4, the AP comprises an SSO Session Manager (41) that, being preferably located at the Front Channel, inter-works with the Back Channel and is interconnected<br>
with an A? Web Front End (42) located at the Front Channel as well. Moreover, the AP includes a Session Database (43) for storing and maintaining such information, the Session Database preferably being located at the Front Channel and 5  interconnected with the SSO Session Manager (41).<br>
[0080] Prior to the introduction of a more detailed description of currently preferred embodiments for the use cases presented above and depicted with reference to Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the different user identifiers that the ) different actors handle in this architectural model will be described.<br>
[0081] In this respect, users must present an unambiguous identity to their Authentication Provider for performing an SSO service request, a so-called "single sign-on authentication identity" (hereinafter referred to as SSO_auth_ID) , and which may have at least any of the following formats for the purpose of the present invention:<br>
-	MSISDN/IMSI,  which pertains to access to and from a mobile phone<br>
-	User@domain or user@realm, e.g. <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f782849285b79a9998d994989a">[email&#160;protected]</a><br>
-	Username (string of characters)<br>
[0082] The Authentication Provider (AP) may administer a plurality of the SSO_auth_ID' s for each user, but needs to define a so-called "Main Single Sign-On Identity" (hereinafter referred to as SSO_MAIN_ID) for each user that correlates the plurality of SSO_auth_ID's. This SSO_MAIN_ID is intended for operator purposes, more specifically for the AP, and its format is left up to the operator, that is, it may or may not match an SSO_auth_ID pertaining to the user.<br>
[0083]  On the other hand, Internet related users have a wide variety of user identities with different service<br>
providers. Users may wish to keep current diverse identities per service provider to access accounts at each site. For the purpose of the present invention such identity is referred to as "service provider user identity" (hereinafter SP_user_ID) and represents the identity of a user at a given Service Provider (SP). This SP_user_ID has meaning only between an owning user and a given SP.<br>
[0084]  The previous paragraphs describe the SSO_MAIN_ID<br>
of a user as a correlating key to at least one SSO_auth_ID<br>
that uniquely authenticates a user at the user's home<br>
operator, namely at an AP, and describe the SP_user_ID that<br>
identifies the user at a given Service Provider.  In a<br>
generic scenario the SSO_MAIN_ID, the SSO_auth_ID, and the<br>
SP_user_ID do not match each other, and a user does not<br>
wish to furnish either identity to other actors. In this<br>
case, .the user may be known to the SP and to the AP with an<br>
identity  that  is  shared  between  both,  the  so-called<br>
SHARED_ID.  This  SHARED_ID may either be  permanent  or<br>
temporary depending on the specific scenario considered.<br>
This identity can be considered an opaque handling used by<br>
the SP and the AP for referring to the same user.<br>
•<br>
[0085]  Thus, in accordance with an aspect of the present<br>
invention,  an  Authentication  Provider  correlates  the<br>
SSO_auth_ID,  SSO_MAIN_ID and SHARED_ID whereas a Service<br>
provider correlates SP_user_ID and SHARED_ID. An exemplary<br>
relationship between these identities is shown in Fig. 10<br>
in a non-restrictive manner. The way these identities are<br>
administered by the different actors, as well as how these<br>
identities are linked to each other,  is not described<br>
further for purposes of the present invention.<br>
[0086] In accordance with the architectural model described above and illustrated in Fig. 4, further detailed embodiments are provided for particular aspects of the use<br><br>
cases described above with reference to sequences in Fig. 2 and 3 respectively. As already mentioned for these use cases, when a user requests (C-23) an SSO Authentication to his Home Site for accessing an SP, different actions may be ~&gt; required depending on whether or not the user had been previously authenticated.<br>
[0087] Thus, by including three sequenced sets of actions (Sequence I, II, and III) respectively depicted in Fig. 5A to Fig. 5C, the embodiment in Fig. 6 describes the details of the use case in Fig. 2 under the architectural model in Fig. 4, wherein the user accessing an SP has not been authenticated yet by his Home network.<br>
[0088]  The  mechanism in  Fig.  6  starts • when  a  user accesses (C-21) an SP, and is redirected (C-22)" to his Home Site. Then, the first sequence (I) in Fig. 5A shows the user issuing an SSO Authentication http request  (C-23') from his own web server. The user identification could be done by means of an encrypted cookie (C-23") , if there is one stored in the user's web agent from a previous SSO session that took place in the past. The encryption of the cookie is recommended to avoid revealing the user identity, SSO_MAIN_ID,  in case someone else obtains such cookie, either by physically accessing the computer used for the SSO session or by means of scripts intended to steal cookies from web browsers. Since the cookie is generated and encrypted by the AP, and later on, decrypted also by the AP,  the encryption algorithm and key management is completely left up to the AP. The user web browser does not need understand the cookie content. In order to secure this process and to prevent stealing cookies in the network path to the web server, the connection might always be done over an https. The user identity to be stored in that cookie should be the one selected as SSO_MAIN_ID.  It would be<br>
convenient to use an identity other than the MSISDN or the IMSI for privacy reasons.<br>
[0089] More specifically, the user web browser is directed to the Web Front End (42) (hereinafter Web F/E) located at the AP Front Channel. The first time the user accesses it, a plug-in is automatically downloaded with the software that implements the client side of the authentication web service, such as a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) client. Subsequently, the Web F/E interfaces (C-500) the SSO Session Manager • (41) to determine if there is an active session associated with the relevant IMSI, or with other user identity used for a similar purpose. In the present case, there will not be any session . active at this point, since the user was not previously authenticated.<br>
[0090] The process in Fig. 6 continues with the second sequence (II)" as shown in Fig. 5B wherein the SSO Session Manager (41) informs (C-501) the Web F/E that there is no active Session. Thus, the user is informed that his authentication is required (C-502) . When the user gets to the Web F/E in the AP Front Channel, he may choose (C-503) to be authenticated via the SIM card, among the different authentication mechanisms available for the user, and then the SOAP client invokes such service. Notice that the SOAP client might be downloaded after the user has chosen this authentication mechanism instead of before, without affecting the scope of the invention. When the user wants to be authenticated with the SIM card, it is assumed that the identity to be presented (C-505) to the Web F/E is the IMSI, stored in the SIM. The IMSI should preferably be sent in the SOAP request assuming that the dialog is carried over a secure connection, namely https, without risking security requirements. The SSO Session Manager is contacted<br>
(C-506) again and, detecting that the user does not have an active session established, it acts as a RADIUS client and requests access (C-507, C-508) to an Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server (44) . Provided that a SIM-based authentication had been selected, the IMSI is used as applicable identity and is encapsulated in an Attribute Value Pair (AVP) of an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) and in the User-Name AVP.<br>
[0091] At this stage, and depending on the authentication mechanism to use, the AAA server (44) may request (C-509, C-510) the provision of an Authentication Challenge to a Back End Authentication Server (72) (hereinafter "B/E Auth. Server"). This "B/E Auth. Server" is preferably reached via RADIUS messages which routing might be done in terms of the realm part of a Network Access Identifier (NAI) . The SSO Session Manager thus acting as a RADIUS client can modify such NAI realm. Once the "B/E Auth. Server" receives the access request message including the user authentication identity and credentials in EAP APV, the "B/E Auth. Server" may require further credentials (C-510 to C-517), this process involving more EAP roundtrips.<br>
[0092] Once the AAA server (44) has successfully authenticated the user, it sends an Access Accept message back (C-518) to the SSO Session Manager. The SSO Session Manager (41) must create now an entry for that user in the session database, including the SSO_auth__ID and the SSO_MAIN_ID. If the SSO Session Manager does not know the SSO_MAIN_ID yet, it queries (C-519) an Identity Manager (70) by providing the SSO_auth_ID as the look-up key for that user. Additional advantages may be encountered by having a Common Directory Service (hereinafter referred to as CDS) for storing SSO_MAIN_ID's, and for providing them (C-522) to the SSO Session Manager at a request via the<br>
Identity Manager (C-520, C-521). At this point, the SSO Session Manager (41) creates an entry, namely a session, for that user in the Session Database (43) by including the particular SSO_auth_JD used during such user authentication and the SSO_MAIN_ID. Once this entry has been created in the SSO Session Manager, additional logic in the Web F/E not shown in Fig. 5B must maintain the session state between subsequent http requests, for example by sending a cookie to the user web browser.<br>
[0093] It will be appreciated that during this authentication process there has been no relationship with the AP Back Channel and no assertions have yet been generated. Only a new session has been created for a given user, including the SSO_MAIN_ID, the SSO_auth_ID, a selected authentication mechanism, and addressing information like an IP address, or an MSISDN belonging to the user.<br>
[0094] Following sequence II, the process in Fig. 6 continues with the third sequence (III) as shown in Fig. 5C. The SSO Session Manager (41), after having a valid session for a given user, fetches (C-550, C-551) from the Identity Manager (70) the identity of that user for the corresponding Service Provider (SP) , namely a SHARED_ID. This SP is the one that originated the initial request, by . redirecting the user to his Home Authentication Provider (AP). Though not shown in Fig. 5C, this SHARED_ID and the corresponding SP, for which such identity is used, are stored in the Session Database (43) associated with the master session entry for that user.<br>
[0095] Once the above identity mapping has been done, the SSO Session Manager (41) invokes (C-552) a service in a Security Assertion Mark-up Language (SAML) engine (45), in order to generate an authentication assertion for the given<br>
SHARED^ID and for the. given Service Provider. The assertion includes other relevant data, such as the date and time when  the  authentication  process  took  place,,  and  the associated security strength of the concrete authentication mechanism. The assertion is stored (C-553) in the Assertion Database (46),    likely indexed by an assertion reference. Thus, the assertion is given an "assertion reference" to uniquely identify it later on. The assertion reference is encoded in an authentication Artifact at the SAML engine, which is returned (C-554) to the SSO Session Manager for further submission via the AP Web F/E (C-555) to the user (C-25).<br>
[0096] Such artifact is preferably returned to the user encoded as a part of the URL, namely a parameter. At the same time, the user web browser is redirected back to the original URL that was sent to the SP. Actually, this information came as a parameter in the URL received at the first redirection from the SP to the AP. Therefore, the original URL that came from the SP, the target resource, should have been stored at the AP Web F/E.<br>
[0097] Thereafter, the user presents the artifact (C-26) to the originally contacted SP. The SP takes the artifact, and after decoding, extracts the assertion reference and the identity of the  AP that issued the assertion. Thp SP uses this information to establish a SAML dialog (C-27) with the AP Back Channel (4") , and requests the original assertion, by presenting the artifact in the SAML assertion request message. When the SAML engine (45) in the AP Back Channel receives the request for an assertion (C-27), it fetches the assertion (C-556, C-557) from the Assertion Database (46), digitally signs it, and sends it back to the SP (C-28) .<br>
[0098] The SP then checks the validity of the assertion, preferably by making use of its own Public Key-Infrastructure (PKI) or, in a more generic case further explained, by making use of the PKI of a trusted authentication broker.<br>
[0099] Once the assertion has been proved valid at the SP and the origin has been found to be trusted, the SP can proceed to parse the assertion content and enforce his local policies according to the authentication facts included in the assertion. Finally, the user is informed (C-29) of the service access acceptance.<br>
[0100] It will be appreciated that the above description in respect of Fig. 6, with preferred embodiments explained in Fig. 5A to 5C, provide architectural details for the use case previously presented in respect of Fig. 2. These architectural details are intended to be understood in an explanatory and non-restrictive manner.<br>
[0101] By including the three sequenced sets of actions (Sequence I, II, and III) respectively depicted in Fig. 5A to Fig. 5C, embodiments in Fig. 7A and 7B also describe details of the use case in Fig. 2, under the architectural model in Fig. 4, wherein the user accessing an SP has already been authenticated by his Home network. More specifically, Fig. 7A presents an isolated authentication of a user before an Authentication Provider at his Home network, whereas Fig. 7B presents the actions carried out when the user accesses an SP, and once redirected to his Home network the user is found to be already authenticated and having a valid session still alive.<br>
[0102] The mechanism in Fig. 7A directly starts with the first sequence (I) shown in Fig. 5A wherein the user issues an SSO Authentication http request (C-23') from his own web<br>
server followed, if available, by a user identification with an encrypted cookie (C-23") sent towards the Web F/E at the AP Front Channel as in the corresponding sequence shown in respect of the use case in Fig. 6. Afterwards, the i  Web F/E interfaces (C-500) the SSO Session Manager (41) to check if there is an active session associated with that user. The sequence flow follows with the second sequence (II) shown in Fig. 5B wherein the authentication procedure, as  likely selected by the  user,  is  carried  out.  In particular, once the SSO Session Manager (41) has created a session for the user in the Session Database (43), in fact by  including  the particular  SSO_auth_ID used  and  the SSO_MAIN_ID, the SSO Session Manager informs the AP Web F/E wherein additional logic not shown  in Fig. 5B maintains the session state for subsequent http requests. Eventually, as shown in Fig.  7A the AP Web F/E acknowledges  (C-70)  a successful Sign-On towards the user web browser.<br>
[0103] This user already authenticated may request (C-21) a service access to an SP. This SP, under the assumptions stated above for the use case in Fig. 2 wherein an Authentication Broker is not needed, redirects (C-22) the user to his Home Site. Then, following the sequence in Fig. 5A, the user accesses once more the given AP Web F/E (42) from which an indication is issued toward the SSO Session Manager (41) to check whether or not a valid session is still alive. Next, the SSO Session Manager (41) likely in co-operation with a Session Database (43) finds out that a session already exists for that user. Then, as shown in the third sequence (III) depicted in Fig. 5C, the SSO Session Manager (41) fetches (C-550, C-551) a SHARED_ID to.be used for that SP, orders (C-552, C-553, C-554) the generation and storage of an assertion for said SHARED_ID and its inclusion in an authentication artifact. The artifact is returned via the Web F/E (C-555) to the user (C-25) and<br>
presented (C-26) as in the use case before to the SP. The SP then checks the original assertion (C-27, C-556, C-557, C-28) with the AP Back Channel (4"), and eventually offers (C-29) service access  acceptance  to  the user.<br>
[0104] Detailed embodiments for the use case in Fig. 2 have been described in the preceding paragraphs distinguishing a first behavior in Fig. 6, where the user accesses an SP without having been authenticated yet, from a second behavior in Fig. 7A and 7B where the user is first authenticated and then given service acceptance.<br>
[0105] In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the use case previously explained with reference to Fig. 3 is now further described in respect of the architectural model shown in Fig. 4. In particular, embodiments derived from the inclusion of an Authentication Broker and corresponding new interfaces are differentiated.<br>
[0106] Thus, as illustrated in Fig. 3, a second use case occurs when a user (User@MN0-A) accesses a certain Service Provider (SP-2) that is associated with a cellular SSO Federation (FSSO-1) through a particular cellular operator such as MNO-B, whereas the user is a subscriber of another cellular operator (MNO-A) which is also a member of the Federation. In this second use case an Authentication Broker (AB) is needed in accordance with an aspect of the present invention for receiving the redirection from the SP (SP-2), resolving the user's Home Site, and redirecting to the MNO where the user belongs.<br>
[0107] In this respect, Fig. 8 shows the actions to be carried out between the user and the AB before redirecting said user to an appropriate Authentication Provider (AP) at the user's Home Site. More specifically, Fig. 8 shows these actions  with  reference  to  the  architectural  model<br>
illustrated in Fig. 4 whereas Fig. 3 does not take into account all particular devices that an AB might comprise. Thus, when a user issues an Authentication request for the SP-2 (C-33) toward the Authentication Broker (AB) as in    Fig. 3, there is actually a http redirection received in an AB Web F/E (21) at a Broker Channel (2) as Fig. 8 shows. Then, a user's Home Site name is requested from the AB Web F/E (C-34, C-35). This request may be done, for instance, by presenting a web page to the user with ail the AP's in    the Federation, wherein the user only has to click on the logo of his Home operator. Next, a URI for the user's Home Site  is  obtained  (C-84,  C-85)  from an Authentication Provider (AP) Database (22) . Eventually, the AB Web F/E (21) redirects (C-36) the user's http to the appropriate AP at his Home Site. The AB may leave a cookie in the web browser of the user in order to avoid further user's Home related queries in successive iterations. The flow sequence goes on with an SSO Authentication request (C-23, C-23', C-23") toward the AP Web F/E (42) as described above in respect of use cases illustrated in Fig. 6 or Fig. 7A and 7B.<br>
[0108]   Fig. 9 shows the actions to be.carried out between a Service Provider and an AB for a user's Home resolution in order to find where the assertion should be validated. More  specifically,  Fig.  9  shows  these  actions  with reference to the architectural model illustrated in Fig. 4, whereas Fig. 3 does not take into account all particular devices that an AB might comprise. After the user has presented . (C-26)  the  artifact  to  the  SP  (SP-2)  as illustrated in Fig. 3 and 9, a user's Home resolution is requested (C-37) to the AB. Such request is received at the AB Web F/E (21) at the Broker Channel (2). Then, the AB Web F/E (21) requests (C-91, C-92) from an AP Database (22) a URI of the AP at the Home Site that is sent back (C-38) to<br>
the SP. The SP, by using preferably DNS techniques, resolves the Home URI and eventually validates (C-27, C-28) the authentication assertion, which was previously obtained (C-23,  C-24,  C-25)  as  shown  in  Fig.  3  or,  more<br>
   specifically, as described above in' respect of use cases illustrated in Fig. 6 or Fig. 7A and 7B. The validation of the authentication assertion (C-27, C-28) is issued from the SP (SP-2) toward the SAML engine (45) likely via a Protocol Binding (47), which is advantageously interposed<br>
   between the SAML engine and the SP. This Protocol Binding<br>
(47) component is arranged for untying an XML instance from<br>
a transport protocol, like httms for example, and passing<br>
it over the SAML engine. The SP is thus entitled to make<br>
any type of query as defined in SAML standards.<br>
[0109] With regard to the check of validity of the assertion in this latest use case, the SP does not need to implement all the PKI complexity, and neither do it for locally installing certificates from all Authentication Providers in the Federation, but just the certificate of its trusted entity in said Federation, namely the certificate of the AP hosting this Authentication Broker.<br>
[0110] Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the disclosed concept, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as has been specifically described.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
