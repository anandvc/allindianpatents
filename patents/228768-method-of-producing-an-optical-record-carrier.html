				<td>The invention relates to a method of producing an optical record carrier.<br>
The invention relates more particvularly to a method of recording in a track on an optical<br>
information carrier a first channel signal representing a main information signal, a second channel signal representing a cue information signal and a third channel signal representing a sub information signal, said main information signal comprising at least one programme item and said cue information signal comprising for said at least one programme item an indication of its location in said track, the recording method comprising the steps of<br>
-	receiving the main information signal, the cue information signal and the sub information<br>
signal,<br>
-	encoding the main information signal, resulting in said first channel signal,<br>
-	encoding the cue information signal, resulting in said second channel signal,<br>
-	encoding the sub information signal by generating sub information packs comprising data<br>
from said sub information signal plus data for error detection and correction thereof,<br>
resulting in said third channel signal,<br>
-	writing the first channel signal in a main information area of said track on the information<br>
carrier,<br>
-	writing the second channel signal and the third channel signal in a lead-in area of said track<br>
preceding the main information area.<br>
The invention further relates to a recording apparatus for carrying out this method of recording, an optical information carrier obtained by such a recording method and a reproduction apparatus for reproducing information from such an information carrier.<br>
Such an optical information carrier is described in [doc. 1]: CEI/IEC publication 908, and [doc. 2]: amendment 60A(Netherlands)80 to that publication. When a sub information signal is recorded as prescribed in [doc. 1] and [doc. 2], the sub information signal is prepared for recording using an encoder as depicted in figure 1. Such an encoder forms sub information packs comprising data from the sub information signal and data for error detection and correction thereof. The data is organised in six-bit units, referred to as symbols. The encoder comprises cross-connections to change<br><br>
the sequence of the symbols within a sub information pack in a predescribed way and it comprises storage elements to delay the individual symbols in a predescribed way, such that the signal which is written to the information carrier, the third channel signal, comprises the sub information packs in interleaved form. To reproduce the sub information signal from a third channel signal that has been recorded in this way on an information carrier, the reproduction apparatus incorporates a decoder that comprises storage elements to balance the delay of the individual symbols being read and cross-connections to restore the original sequence of the symbols, thus repealing the interleaving of the recorded sub information packs.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method of recording as described in the preamble which enables a simplified way of decoding the third channel signal, recorded in the lead-in area of a track on the optical information carrier, to recover the sub information signal. Further objects of the invention are to provide a recording apparatus which applies this method of recording, an optical information carrier recorded on such a recording apparatus and a reproduction apparatus for reproducing information from such an information carrier.<br>
The method of recording according to the present invention is<br>
characterized in that said sub information packs are generated in substantially non-interleaved form and included in that form in said third channel signal. When said third channel signal is recprded on an optical information carrier as prescribed in [doc. 2], the sub information signal is encoded such that sub information packs are generated comprising data from the sub information signal plus data for error detection and correction thereof, the sequence of the symbols in a sub information pack is changed and the individual symbols are delayed. For reproduction of the sub information signal from such an information carrier, a complex decoder as described in the prior art must be incorporated in the reproduction apparatus. To allow the use of a simplified decoder in a reproduction apparatus which reproduces the sub information signal from the lead-in area, the present invention prescribes that sub information packs are included in non-interleaved form in the third channel signal.<br>
If a method of recording is applied which comprises the step of<br>
interleaving sub information packs according to the prior art, an embodiment of the invention is characterized in that said encoding step further comprises a step in which said sub information packs are post-interleaved after said interleaving step, so as to generate the said<br><br>
sub information packs in substantially non-interleaved form. This embodiment is particularly useful for upgrading those implementations of the prior art recording method in which the comprised steps cannot be changed but new steps can be added. The disadvantage of an extra step in the recording method is outbalanced by the advantage of the upgrading: to enable a simplified way of decoding.<br>
An embodiment of the invention may further be characterized in that said step of encoding the sub information signal comprises the steps of<br>
-	generating first codewords indicating sub information packs being substantially<br>
non-interleaved,<br>
-	including a first codeword in sub information packs that are generated in substantially<br>
non-interleaved form. This codeword may assist a reproduction apparatus in recognising sub<br>
information packs that can be decoded using a simplified decoder.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention is adapted to record a first sub information signal in non-interleaved form as described hereinbefore, plus a second sub information signal, and is characterized in that the recording method comprises the steps of<br>
-	encoding said second sub information signal by generating second sub information packs<br>
comprising data from said second sub information signal plus data for error detection and<br>
correction thereof, and by interleaving said second sub information packs, - inserting said<br>
interleaved second sub information packs in said third channel signal. Thus, this method<br>
provides sub information packs recorded for simplified decoding plus sub information packs<br>
recorded according to the prior art. This is useful if the two sub information signals are<br>
targetted at different types of decoders, i.e. different types of reproduction apparatus. For<br>
instance, if the two sub information signals carry substantially the same information, both a<br>
simplified decoder and a decoder according to the prior art find recorded on the information<br>
carrier sub information packs that it can decode, so that both types of decoders can<br>
reproduce the substantially same information.<br>
The method for recording a first plus a second sub information signal may further be characterized in that the recording method comprises the steps of<br>
-	generating first and second codewords, the first codewords indicating sub information packs<br>
being substantially non-interleaved, the second codewords indicating sub information packs<br>
being substantially interleaved,<br>
-	including a first codeword in sub information packs that are generated in substantially<br>
non-interleaved form and carried in that form in said third channel signal, and including a<br>
second codeword in sub information packs that are generated in substantially interleaved<br><br>
form and carried in that form in said third channel signal. The codeword may assist a reproduction apparatus in recognising sub information packs that can be decoded by the type of decoder comprised in the reproduction apparatus. Sub information packs labelled with a first codeword can be decoded by a simplified decoder and packs labelled with a second codeword can be decoded by a decoder according to the prior art. It is noted here that a codeword may carry more information than the mere indication of whether or not packs are interleaved; it may, for instance, also indicate the type of information carried in the pack. Therefore, a multitude of first codewords and a multitude of second codewords may be used. In each sub information pack, one and only one codeword is included; one from a multitude of first codewords or one from a multitude of second codewords.<br>
An embodiment of the invention may further be characterized in that said first mentioned sub information signal comprises packets carrying coded text. The coded text may comprise different information categories, such as a track list, information about the performing artists and the album title. Further, codes within the coded-text packets and commands packets that provide links to particular information categories may provide means for interactive selection from a menu-type of text presentation. It is particularly useful to provide these packets carrying coded text in the lead-in area of the information carrier, as this allows the decoding and presentation of the text prior to the reproduction of the main information signal that is recorded in the main information area.<br>
A further refinement of the latter embodiment may be characterized in that said step of generating codewords is adapted to generating codewords that further mark those sub information packs in which at least part of a packet carrying coded text is comprised. Thus, the codeword comprised in a sub information pack also identifies the type of information carried in that pack. This is useful, during reproduction, for providing the appropriate data to different types of data decoders, such as a text decoder, a MIDI-data decoder, etcetera.<br>
For recording on an optical information carrier such as a CD or CDV disc, each of the described recording methods may be applied, further characterized in that said third channel signal is recorded in a sub information channel which is formed by at least one of the subcode channels R-W as defined in [doc. 1]. A method for recording a sub information signal in the subcode channels R-W on CD can be deduced from the description in [doc. 2]. The method disclosed in the present invention, however, enables a simplified way of decoding the third channel signal, recorded in the lead-in area of a track.<br>
An optical information carrier having a first channel signal recorded in a<br><br>
main information area of a track on the information carrier and having second and third channel signals recorded in a lead-in area of said track preceding said main information area, said first channel signal representing a main information signal comprising at least one programme item, said second channel signal representing a cue information signal comprising for said at least one programme item an indication of its location on said track, said third channel signal representing a sub information signal carrying sub information packs comprising data from said sub information signal plus data for error detection and correction thereof is characterized according to the present invention in that said sub information packs are carried in substantially non-interleaved form in said recorded third channel signal. When said third channel signal has been recorded on an optical information carrier as prescribed in [doc. 2], the sub information packs are comprised such that the sequence of the symbols in a sub information pack has been changed and the individual symbols have been delayed. To reproduce the sub information signal from such an information carrier, a complex decoder as described in the prior art must be incorporated in the reproduction apparatus. To allow the use of a simplified decoder in a reproduction apparatus which reproduces the sub information packs from the lead-in area, the present invention prescribes that those sub information packs are comprised in non-interleaved form in the third channel signal.<br>
A further embodiment of the optical information carrier according to the invention is characterized in that second sub information packs, comprising data from a second sub information signal plus data for error detection and correction thereof, are included in substantially interleaved form in said recorded third channel signal. Thus, this information carrier carries sub information packs fit for simplified decoding plus sub information packs fit for decoding according to the prior art. This allows the information carrier to be suitable for reproduction on different types of reproduction apparatus incorporating different types of decoders.<br>
A further refinement of this embodiment is characterized in that a first codeword is included in sub information packs that are carried in substantially non-interleaved form in said recorded third channel signal and in that a second codeword is included in sub information packs that are carried in substantially interleaved form in said recorded third channel signal. The codeword may assist a reproduction apparatus in recognising sub information packs that can be decoded by the type of decoder comprised in the reproduction apparatus. Sub information packs labelled with a first codeword can be decoded by a simplified decoder and packs labelled with a second codeword can be decoded by a decoder according to the prior art.<br><br>
A recording apparatus for recording in a track on an optical information carrier a first channel signal representing a main information signal, a second channel signal representing a cue information signal and a third channel signal representing a sub information signal, said main information signal comprising at least one programme item and said cue information signal comprising for said at least one programme item an indication of its location on said track, the recording apparatus comprising<br>
-	means for receiving the main information signal, the cue information signal and the sub<br>
information signal,<br>
-	means for encoding the main information signal, providing said first channel signal,<br>
- means for encoding the cue information signal, providing said second channel signal,<br>
-	means for encoding the sub information signal by generating sub information packs<br>
comprising data from said sub information signal plus data for error detection and correction<br>
thereof, providing said third channel signal,<br>
-	means for writing the first channel signal in a main information area of said track on the<br>
information carrier and for writing the second channel signal and the third channel signal in a<br>
lead-in area of said track preceding the main information area, is characterized according to<br>
the present invention, characterized in that said means for encoding the sub information<br>
signal are adapted to generate said sub information packs in substantially non-interleaved<br>
form and to provide said third channel signal carrying sub information packs in that form.<br>
When the sub information signal is encoded as prescribed in [doc. 2], sub information packs<br>
are generated comprising data from the sub information signal plus data for error detection<br>
and correction thereof, the sequence of the symbols in a sub information pack is changed and<br>
the individual symbols are delayed. For reproduction of the sub information signal from such<br>
an information carrier, a complex decoder as described in the prior art must be incorporated<br>
in the reproduction apparatus. To allow the use of a simplified decoder in a reproduction<br>
apparatus which reproduces the sub information packs from the lead-in area, the present<br>
invention prescribes that the sub information encoder comprised in the recording apparatus<br>
generates sub information packs in non-interleaved form.<br>
A further embodiment of the recording apparatus according to the invention is adapted to record a first sub information signal in non-interleaved form as described hereinbefore, plus a second sub information signal, and is characterized in that the recording apparatus comprises<br>
-	means for encoding said second sub information signal by generating second sub<br>
information packs comprising data from said second sub information signal plus data for<br><br>
error detection and correction thereof and by interleaving said second sub information packs,<br>
-	means for inserting said interleaved second sub information packs in said third channel<br>
signal. Thus, this recording apparatus records sub information packs that are suitable for<br>
simplified decoding plus sub information packs that are suitable for decoding by a decoder<br>
according to the prior art. This is useful if the two sub information signals are targetted at<br>
different types of decoders, i.e. different types of reproduction apparatus. The recording<br>
apparatus need not comprise means for receiving the second sub information signal if that<br>
second signal is substantially the same as the first sub information signal. Thus, the same<br>
information may be recorded for different types of decoders, i.e. for simplified decoding as<br>
well as for decoding according to the prior art.<br>
A reproduction apparatus for reproducing information from a track on an optical information carrier, the apparatus being provided with<br>
-	reading means for reading a first channel signal representing a main information signal<br>
recorded in a main information area of said track, a second channel signal representing a cue<br>
information signal and a third channel signal representing a sub information signal, said<br>
second and third channel signals having been recorded in a lead-in area of said track<br>
preceding said main information area,<br>
-	means for decoding the first channel signal to recover said main information signal,<br>
-	means for decoding the second channel signal to recover said cue information signal,<br>
-	means for decoding the third channel signal to recover said sub information signal, said<br>
means comprising means for error detection and correction, so as to correct errors that may<br>
be present in said third channel signal, is characterized according to the present invention in<br>
that said means for decoding the third channel signal are devoid of means for de-interleaving.<br>
Thus, the decoder is simplified with respect to the prior art decoder in that the storage<br>
elements for balancing the delay of the individual symbols and the cross-connections for<br>
restoring the original sequence of the symbols are omitted.<br>
An embodiment of a reproduction apparatus according to the present invention is characterized in that said means for decoding said third channel signal comprises<br>
-	means for recovering said codeword from a sub information pack,<br>
-	means for comparing said codeword to first codewords indicating sub information packs<br>
being substantially non-interleaved,<br>
-	switching means being adapted to enable the supply of said sub information signal to the<br>
output in response to recognising said codeword as being a first codeword and being adapted<br>
to disable the supply of said sub information signal to the output in response to recognising<br><br>
said codeword as not being a first codeword. Thus, the decoder recognises which sub information packs can be decoded successfully and which cannot. If the decoder would not examine the codeword, it would have to rely solely on the error detection to identify packs that it cannot decode, at the risk of erronously accepting an interleaved pack that, by chance, produces no errors or only a few.<br>
A reproduction apparatus for reproducing information from a track on an optical information carrier, the apparatus being provided with<br>
-	reading means for reading a first channel signal representing a main information signal<br>
recorded in a main information area of said track, a second channel signal representing a cue<br>
information signal and a third channel signal representing a sub information signal, said<br>
second and third channel signals having been recorded in a lead-in area of said track<br>
preceding said main information area,<br>
-	means for decoding the first channel signal to recover said main information signal,<br>
-	means for decoding the second channel signal to recover said cue information signal,<br>
-	means for decoding the third channel signal to recover said sub information signal, said<br>
means comprising means for de-interleaving said third channel signal, so as to obtain a<br>
de-interleaved third channel signal, said decoding means further comprising error correction<br>
means for error detection and correction, so as to correct errors that may be present in said<br>
third channel signal, is characterized according to the present invention in that said means for<br>
decoding comprise switching means being adapted to provide said third channel signal to said<br>
error correction means in response to the presence of a first control signal and to provide<br>
said de-interleaved third channel signal to said error correction means in response to the<br>
presence of a second control signal. Thus, this decoder is capable of decoding interleaved<br>
packs and of decoding non-interleaved packs. The said control signals determine which type<br>
of decoding is in operation.<br>
An embodiment of the decoder may comprise a decoder according to the prior art, supplemented with a switch that supplies to the error detector either the packs that are provided to the input of the de-interleaver, thus bypassing the de-interleaver, or the packs that are provided by the output of the de-interleaver.<br>
Another embodiment of the decoder may comprise a decoder according to the prior art, preceded by an interleaver similar to the one described in [doc. 2] for use during recording, plus a switch that supplies to the prior art decoder either the packs that are provided to the input of the interleaver, thus bypassing the interleaver, or the packs that are provided by the output of the interleaver.<br><br>
Both embodiments supply the same signal at the output of the error detector, except that the latter embodiment exhibits a constant extra delay when non-interleaved packs are being decoded.<br>
A further embodiment of a reproduction apparatus according to the<br>
present invention is characterized in that it further comprises means for generating said first control signal in correlation with reading the lead-in area of said track and said second control signal in correlation with reading the main information area of said track. Thus, the decoder will apply de-interleaving when it reads the main information area and it will not apply de-interleaving when it reads the lead-in area. It is noted here, that according to the prior art sub information packs shall be interleaved, irrespective of the area in which they are recorded. This invention discloses sub information packs being recorded in non-interleaved form in the lead-in area.<br>
Another embodiment of a reproduction apparatus according to the present invention is characterized in that said means for decoding the third channel signal being adapted to reconstruct, from the data comprised in said sub information packs, packets carrying coded text. Thus, the decoder does or does not apply de-interleaving, depending on the codeword. If the decoder would not examine the codeword, it would have to apply error detection both before and after de-interleaving to decide whether or not de-interleaving is required, at the risk of taking a wrong decision.<br>
An embodiment of a reproduction apparatus according to the invention may further be characterized in that said means for decoding the third channel signal being adapted to reconstruct, from the data comprised in said sub information packs, packets carrying coded text. The coded text may comprise different information categories, such as a track list, information about the performing artists and the album title, and the reproduction apparatus may enable a listener to select which to display, for instance, from a menu-type of text presentation. Further information may be retrieved from the packets, for instance for making the presentation on the display more attractive, like colour attribute codes and coded graphics. The reproducing apparatus may incorporate various types of display, because information supporting presentation on different types of displays may be provided in the code-text packets.<br>
It is particularly useful to read these packets carrying coded text from the lead-in area of the information carrier, as this allows the decoding and presentation of the text prior to the reproduction of the main information signal that is recorded in the main information area. Thus, a listener may, for instance, select which tracks to play before the actual playback has<br><br>
started. A reproduction apparatus may store the coded-text packets, read from the lead-in area, in e.g. a RAM-type of memory incorporated in the apparatus, so that it can reproduce the information from the packets also during playback of the main information signal.<br>
A further refinement of the latter embodiment may be characterized in that said means for decoding the third channel signal being adapted to<br>
-	comparing said codeword to codewords identifying sub information packs that comprise at<br>
least part of a packet carrying coded text,<br>
-	reconstructing packets carrying coded text from data comprised in those sub information<br>
packs that are recognised as comprising at least part of a packet carrying coded text,<br>
-	providing said packets carrying coded text to means adapted to decoding and displaying<br>
text. Thus, the decoder can identify from the codeword the type of information carried in the<br>
sub information pack. This is useful for providing the appropriate data to different types of<br>
data decoders, such as a text decoder, a MIDI-data decoder, etcetera.<br>
It is noted here that a system, information carrier and reproduction<br>
arrangement for conveying packets carrying coded text via a sub channel on an information carrier are known from the European patent application EP 0 325 325. That patent application, however, does not disclose packets carrying textual information being recorded in the lead-in area of a track on an information carrier. Further, the present invention discloses a method of recording that enables a simplified way of decoding the information during reproduction.<br>

It is noted here that the same sub information signal may be supplied to both inputs 46a and 46b of switching means 46. Thus, the same information may be recorded in interleaved form as well as in non-interleaved form. Consequently, the recording apparatus need not comprise an input for receiving a second sub information signal.<br>
