accelerator padel (1) is connected to an incoming pneumatic air line (4) and an<br>
outgoing pneumatic air line (5) by means of a throttle valve. At the starting point,<br>
the driver will start a D.C. motor (6) with the help of pluralities of batteries (7).<br>
The rotation of D.C. motor (6) will start rotation of a air compressor (8). The air<br>
compressor are rigidly fixed to a beam (36). The air compressor (8) will cater<br>
pneumatic air via a air purifier (32) to a plurality of air reservoirs/tanks (9,10,11)<br>
disposed at right side, at rear end and left side of the car. These three tanks<br>
(9,10,11) are interconnected each other by means of steel re-inforce flexible pipe.<br>
Each tank is provided with a pressure gauge (39) and safety valve (40) and one<br>
exhaust nipple (34) and operable at 450-500 PSI.<br>
For starting the car, the driver press the accelerator (1) which will discharge the<br>
compressed air through line 5 and this compressed air enters into one air-<br>
5<br><br>
distributor (12). This air distributor (12) provided with a plurality of air inlet and<br>
outlet channel and outgoing compressed air of air distributor enters into inlet<br>
pipe of pneumatic air cylinder (13) and also reversed flow of air into the pneumatic<br>
air cylinder (13) maintain a hermonic motion . This creates a to and fro motion of<br>
the piston (14) of the air cylinder. The piston is connected with a first end of a tie<br>
bar (15) and the second end of the tie rod (15) is connected at a peripheral point<br>
of a pinion (17). The to and fro motion of the piston rod (14) creates a rotation of<br>
the pinion (17). This pinion (17) rotates another second pinion (19) and also<br>
transmit rotational speed of the rear wheels (20) through a differencial box (21).<br>
From the second pinion (19) power is transmitted to a central rod (22). The<br>
central rod (22) is made of three parts, and coupled (37) at two different joint.<br>
The second end of the central rod (22) is connected to a third pinion (23). The<br>
pinion (23) is coupled to fourth pinion (24) which is connected to the crank shaft<br>
of an air engine (26) and a fly wheel (25). So power is transmitted from the rear<br>
end to front end by means of the central rod (22). One gear box (28) is<br>
connected to the crank shaft (27). The rotation of crank shaft (27) provides power<br>
to the gear box (28). The other cylinder of the air engine is used to generate<br>
compressed air and these compressed air cater to the three air tanks (9,10,11)<br>
via an air purifier (32) to compensate<br>
6<br><br>
the loss in the system. The gear box (27) is connected to a differencial gear box<br>
(21) to control the speed of the car.<br>
The batteries (7) are connected to a dynamo (29) for auto charging during running<br>
condition. The car is also provided one I.C. engine (30) and a separate air<br>
compressor (31) as an auxiliary unit for emergency purpose. The air compressor<br>
(31) is connected to tanks (9,10,11) via one air valve.<br>
The clutch (3) is connected with the gear box for controlling of speed.The brake<br>
(2) arrangement is as per conventional method by using brake oil to control the<br>
speed. A plurality of air exhaust (33) are provided in the vehicle for cooling the<br>
environement of the rider or may be allowed to exit in open air.<br>
