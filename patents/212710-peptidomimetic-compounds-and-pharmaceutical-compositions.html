				<td>Peptidomimetic Protease Inhibitors<br>
This invention is directed to peptidomimetic compounds and intermediates thereto, their preparation including stereoselective synthetic processes to intermediates, pharmaceutical compositions containing the peptidomimetic compounds, and the use of the peptidomimetic compounds or compositions thereof as protease inhibitors, particularly as serine protease inhibitors, and more particularly as hepatitis C virus ("HCV") NS3 protease inhibitors. The peptidomimetic compounds, as HCV NS3 protease inhibitors, are particularly useful in interfering with the life cycle of the hepatitis C virus and in treating or preventing an HCV infection or physiological conditions associated therewith. The present invention is also directed to methods of combination therapy for inhibiting HCV replication in cells, or for treating or preventing an HCV infection in patients using the peptidomimetic compounds or pharmaceutical compositions, or kits and pharmaceutical packs therefor. According to the present invention included as pharmaceutical compositions are those comprising an inhibitor of HCV serine protease in combination with an interferon having anti-HCV activity; an inhibitor of HCV serine protease in combination with a compound, other than an interferon, having anti-HCV activity; or an inhibitor of HCV serine protease in combination with both an interferon having anti-HCV activity and a compound, other than an interferon, having anti-HCV activity. Further the present invention is directed to stereoselective methods for preparing chiral bicycloprolinate intermediates useful in the synthesis of the peptidomimetic compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Infection by the HCV is a compelling human medical problem and is now recognized as the causative agent for most cases of non-A, non-B hepatitis.<br>
The HCV is thought to infect chronically 3% of the world's population [A. Alberti et al., "Natural History of Hepatitis C," J. Hepatology. 31, (Suppl. 1), 17-24 (1999)]. In the United States alone the infection rate is 1.8% or 3.9 million people [MJ. Alter, "Hepatitis C Virus Infection in the United States," J. Hepatology. 31, (Suppl. 1), 88-91 (1999)]. Of all patients infected over 70% develop a chronic infection that is believed to be a major cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. [D. Lavanchy, "Global Surveillance and Control of Hepatitis C," J. Viral Hepatitis, 6, 35-47 (1999)]<br>
The replication of the HCV encompasses genomic encoding a polyprotein of 3010-3033 amino acids [Q.-L. Choo, et al., "Genetic Organization and Diversity of the Hepatitis C Virus", Proc. Nail. Acad. Sci. USA, 88.2451-2455 (1991); N. Kato et al., "Molecular Cloning of the<br><br>
2<br>
Human Hepatitis C Virus Genome From Japanese Patients with Non-A, Non-B Hepatitis", Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 82, 9524-9528 (1990); A. Takamizawa et al., "Structure and Organization of the Hepatitis C Virus Genome Isolated From Human Carriers", J. Virol., 65,1105-1113 (1991)]. The HCV nonstructural (NS) proteins are presumed to provide the essential catalytic machinery for viral replication. The NS proteins are derived by proteolytic cleavage of the polyprotein [R. Bartenschlager et al., "Nonstructural Protein 3 of the Hepatitis C Virus Encodes a Serine-Type Proteinase Required for Cleavage at the NS3/4 and NS4/5 Junctions", J. Virol., 67, 3835-3844 (1993); A. Grakoui et al. "Characterization of the Hepatitis C Virus-Encoded Serine Proteinase: Determination of Proteinase-Dependent Polyprotein Cleavage Sites", J. Virol., 62, 2832-2843 (1993); A. Grakoui et al., Expression and Identification of Hepatitis C Virus Polyprotein Cleavage Products", J. Virol.. 6J, 1385-1395 (1993); L. Tomei et al., "NS3 is a serine protease required for processing of hepatitis C virus polyprotein", J. Virol.. 67.4017-4026 (1993)]. In fact, it is the first 181 amino acids of NS3 (residues 1027-1207 of the viral polyprotein) have been shown to contain the serine protease domain of NS3 that processes all four downstream sites of the HCV polyprotein [C. Lin et al., "Hepatitis C Virus NS3 Serine Proteinase: Traits-Cleavage Requirements and Processing Kinetics", J. Virol.. 68, 8147-8157 (1994)].<br>
The HCV NS protein 3 (NS3) contains a serine protease activity that helps in the processing of the majority of the viral enzymes, and thus is considered essential for viral replication and infectivity. The essentiality of the NS3 protease was inferred from the fact that mutations in the yellow fever virus NS3 protease decreases viral infectivity [T.J. Chambers et al., "Evidence that the N-terminal Domain of Nonstructural Protein NS3 From Yellow Fever Virus is a Serine Protease Responsible for Site-Specific Cleavages in the Viral Polyprotein", Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 87, 8898-8902 (1990)]. More recently, it was demonstrated that mutations at the active site of the HCV NS3 protease could completely abolish the HCV infection in a chimpanzee model [CM. Rice et al. "Hepatitis C virus-encoded enzymatic activities and conserved RNA elements in the 3'-nontranslated region are essential for virus replication in vivo." J. Virol.. 74(4) 2046-51 (2000)]. The HCV NS3 serine protease is also considered essential for viral replication as it and its associated cofactor, NS4A., help in the processing of all of the viral enzymes. This processing appears to be analogous to that carried out by the human immunodeficiency virus ("HIV") aspartyl protease. In addition, the demonstrated use of HTV protease inhibitors as potent antiviral agents in man demonstrates that interrupting a protease protein processing stage in the viral life cycle does result in therapeutically active agents. Consequently, the protease enzyme is an attractive target for drug discovery.<br><br>

Several potential HCV protease inhibitors have been described. PCT Publications Numbers WO 00/09558, WO 00/09543, WO 99/64442, WO 99/07733, WO 99/07734, WO 99/50230, WO98/46630, WO 98/17679 and WO 97/43310, United States Patent No. 5,990,276, M. Llinas-Brunet et al., Bioore, Med. Chem, Lett., 8,1713-1718 (1998), W. Han et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 10, 711-713 (2000), R. Dunsdon et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett.. 20,1571-1579 (2000), M. Llinas-Brunet et al, Bioorg. Med. Chsm. Lett.. 10,2267-2270 (2000), and S. LaPlante et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett- K&gt;, 2271-2274 (2000) each describe potential HCV NS3 protease inhibitors. Unfortunately, there are no serine protease inhibitors available currently as anti-HCV agents.<br>
In fact, there are no anti-HCV therapies except interferon-a, interferon-a/ribavirin combination and more recently pegylated inteferon-a. The sustained response rates for the interferon-a therapies and interferon-oc/ribavirin however tend to be low (
In view of the current situation regarding anti-HCV therapeutics, it is clear that there is a need for more effective and better tolerated therapies.<br>
Furthermore, synthesis of complex peptidomimetic compounds has long been hampered by the nonstereoselective nature of most synthetic organic processes. It is well known that the therapeutic activity of enantiomers of peptidomimetic compounds varies widely. It is therefore of great benefit to provide such stereospecific synthetic processes.<br>
Previous attempts to synthesize chirally specific bicycloprolinate intermediates, useful in the synthesis of the present therapeutic peptidomimetic protease inhibitors have suffered from being non enatioselective, or diasteroselective, or long encompassing synthetic pathways, or being unsuitable for preparing large quantities of product. Thus, there is also a need for a means of<br><br>
4<br>
preparing large quantities of bicycloprolinates in a diastereoselective manner and enantiomerically enriched form.<br>

In such solid dosage forms, the compound of the invention is admixed with at least one inert customary excipient (or carrier) such as sodium citrate or dicalchim phosphate or (a) fillers or extenders, as for example, starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol and silicic acid, (b) binders, as for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alignates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose and acacia, (c) humectants, as for example, glycerol, (d) disintegrating agents, as for example, agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, algiiiic acid, certain complex silicates and sodium carbonate, (e) solution retarders, as for example paraffin, (f) absorption accelerators, as for example, quaternary ammonium compounds, (g) wetting agents, as for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, (h) adsorbents, as for example, kaolin and bentonite, (i) lubricants, as for example, talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, (j) opacifying agents, (k) buffering agents , and agents which release the compound(s) of the invention in a certain part of the intestinal tract in a delayed manner.<br>
Actual dosage levels of active iingredient(s) in the compositions of the invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of active ingredient(s) that is (are) effective to obtain a desired therapeutic response for a particular composition and method of administration for a patient. A selected dosage level for any particular patient therefore depends upon a variety of factors including the desired therapeutic effect, on the route of administration, on the desired duration of treatment, the etiology and severity of the disease, the patient's condition, weight, sex, diet and age, the type and potency of each active ingredient, rates of absorbtion, metabolism and/or excretion and other factors.<br>
Total daily dose of the compounds of this invention administered to a patient in single or divided doses may be in amounts, for example, of from about 0.001 to about 100 mg/kg body<br><br>
270<br>
weight daily and preferably 0.01 to 10 nig/kg/day. For example, in an adult, the doses are generally from about 0.01 to about 100, preferably about 0.01 to about 10, mg/kg.body weight per day by inhalation, from about 0.01 to about 100, preferably 0.1 to 70, more especially 0.5 to 10, mg/kg body weight per day by oral administration, and from about 0.01 to about 50, preferably 0.01 to 10, mg/kg body weight per day by intravenous administration. The percentage of active ingredient in a composition may be varied, though it should constitute a proportion such that a suitable dosage shall be obtained. Dosage unit compositions may contain such amounts of such submultiples thereof as may be used to make up the daily dose. Obviously, several unit dosage forms may be administered at about the same time. A dosage may be administered as frequently as necessary in order to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. Some patients may respond rapidly to a higher or lower dose and may find much weaker maintenance doses adequate. For other patients, it may be necessary to have long-term treatments at the rate of 1 to 4 doses per day, in accordance with the physiological requirements of each particular patient. It goes without saying that, for other patients, it will be necessary to prescribe not more than one or two doses per day.<br>
The formulations can be prepared in unit dosage form by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier that constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>
The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials with elastomeric stoppers, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.<br>
Compounds within the scope of the present invention exhibit marked pharmacological activities according to tests described in the literature and below, which tests results are believed to correlate to pharmacological activity in humans and other mammals.<br>
IN VITRO ENZYME ASSAY PROCEDURE Inhibition of HCV NS3 Serine Protease<br>
HCV NS3 protease domain was expressed and purified as described previously (Vertex, PCT publication WO98/17679; which is incorporated herein by reference). The chromogenic peptide substrate, EDVVAbuC-p-nitroanilide, and the NS4A cofactor fragment<br><br>
271<br>
(-KKGSWIVGRIVLSGK-) for NS3 protease was custom synthesized by American Peptide Com (Ca). The compounds of this invention were tested for their ability to inhibit HCV NS3 protease activity using a spectrophotometric assay with EDWAbuC-p-nitroanilide as substrate. The assay was run in a 96-well microtiter plate using a SpectraMax 250 reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with kinetic capability. Cleavage of EDVVAbuC-p-nitroanilide (500 pM) substrate by purified HCV NS3 protease (0.5 JIM) was performed at 30°C in the buffer containing 30 uM NS4A fragment, 46 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 92 mM NaCl, 18% glycerol, 5 mM DTT, and 7.5% DMSO in the absence or presence of the testing compound. The reaction was monitored for pNA (p-nitroaniline) release at 405 nm.<br>
The determination of the kinetic parameters including Vmax, Km and V^/Km is performed under the conditions as described above. Ki values are calculated from rate vs. [inhibitor] plots, at fixed concentrations of enzyme and substrate, by a nonlinear least squares fit of the data to the equation of Morrison for tight binding competitive inhibition [J. F. Morrison, Biochim. Biophvs. Acta.. 185, 269-286 (1969)]. The Prism program (GraphPad Software, Inc.) is used for this procedure.<br>
The HCV serine protease inhibitors disclosed herein can be used in combination with other molecules that directly exhibit or indirectly elicit anti-HCV activity either prophylactically in patients at risk for contracting HCV infection, or to treat patients that are already infected. The term "anti-HCV activity" refers to the capacity of a molecule, when present, to completely inhibit or reduce accumulation of HCV virions compared to HCV virion accumulation in the absence of such molecule, and/or the capacity of a molecule to reduce or ameliorate conditions or symptoms associated with HCV infection or pathogenesis in patients. Molecules having anti-HCV activity include those that disrupt one of more steps in HCV infection or replication, as well as those that evoke immunomodulating and antiproliferative actions in host cells. Molecules having anti-HCV activity can inhibit HCV-specific replicative events such as, but not limited to, HCV-directed nucleic acid or protein synthesis. Stages of HCV replication at which molecules having anti-HCV activity can act include cell entry (e.g., attachment; penetration); uncoating and release of the HCV genome; replication of the HCV genome (e.g., replication of either strand of the viral RNA genome; transcription of viral messenger RNA); translation of HCV proteins; posttranslational modification of HCV proteins (e.g., proteolytic cleavage; grycosylation); Litracellular transport of viral proteins; assembly of virion components; and release of viral particles (e.g., budding). Classes of molecules having anti-viral activity include, but are not limited to, soluble receptor decoys and antireceptor antibodies; ion channel blockers, capsid stabilizers, and fusion protein inhibitors; inhibitors of viral polymerases, reverse transcriptase, helicase, primase, or integrase;<br><br>
272<br>
antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes; immunomodulating and imrnunostimulating agents, including cytokines such as interferons, as well as peptide agonists, steroids, and classic drugs such as levamisole; inhibitors of regulatory proteins; protease inhibitors; assembly protein inhibitors; and antiviral antibodies and cytotoxic lymphocytes. The term "anti-HCV effective amount" or "pharmaceutically effective amount" refers to an amount of a compound, or combination of compounds as disclosed herein, effective in reducing or ameliorating conditions or symptoms associated with HCV infection or associated pathogenesis in patients, or in reducing viral levels in \ntro or in vivo. In vitro applications include the Replicon Assay system, described below, where such amounts axe effective in reducing HCV replicon RNA accumulation and/or the accumulation of proteins encoded by genes contained therein.<br>
Compounds having anti-HCV activity contemplated for use in the compositions and methods of combination therapy disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, immunomodulatory molecules, including imrnunostimulatory cytokines, and other compounds known to have HCV antiviral activity, such as various antiviral nucleosides and nucleotides.<br>

Future options for the management of hepatitis C. Seminars in Liver Disease 19,103-112 (1999)); Interfeukin 12 (Davis, G.L., Nelson, D.R. &amp; Reyes, G.R. Future options for the management of hepatitis C, SemUiars in Liver Disease 19,103-112 (1999)); Ribavirin; and compounds that enhance the development of a type 1 helper T cell response (Davis, G-L., Nelson, D.R, &amp; Reyes, G.R. Future options for the management of hepatitis C. Seminars in Liver Disease 19,103-112 (1999)). Interferons may ameliorate viral infections by exerting direct antiviral effects and/or by modifying the immune response to infection. The antiviral effects of interferons are often<br><br>
273<br>
mediated through inhibition of viral penetration or uncrating, synthesis of viral RNA, translation of viral proteins, and/or viral assembly and release.<br>

Synthetic methods for the preparation of nucleosides and nudeotides useful in the present invention are well known in the ait as disclosed in Ada Biochim. Pol,<br>
43,25-36 (1996); Swed. Nucleosides Nudeotides 15, 361-378 (1996); Synthesis 12,1465-1479 (1995); Carbohyd. Chem. 27, 242-276 (1995); Chem. Nucleosides Nudeotides 3,421-535 (1994); Ann. Reports in Med. Chem., Academic Press; and Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs 4, 95-115 (1995).<br>
The chemical reactions described in the references cited above are generally disclosed in terms of their broadest application to the preparation of the compounds of this invention. Occasionally, the reactions may not be applicable as described to each compound included within the scope of compounds disclosed herein. The compounds for which this occurs will be readily recognized by those skilled in the art. In all such cases, either the reactions can be successfully performed by conventional modifications known to those skilled in the art, e.g., by appropriate protection of interfering groups, by changing to alternative conventional reagents, by routine modification of reaction conditions, and the like, or other reactions disclosed herein or otherwise conventional will be applicable to the preparation of the corresponding compounds of this invention. In all preparative methods, all starting materials are known or readily preparable from known starting materials.<br>
While nucleoside analogs are generally employed as antiviral agents as is, nudeotides (nucleoside phosphates) must sometimes have to be converted to nucleosides in order to facilitate their transport across cell membranes. An example of a chemically modified nucleotide capable of entering cells is S-l-3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyI<br>
cytosine (HPMPC, Gilead Sciences). Nucleoside and nucleotide compounds of this invention that are acids can form salts. Examples include salts with alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, potassium, calcium, or magnesium, or with organic bases or<br><br>
277<br>
basic quaternary ammonium salts.<br>
Immunomodulators and immunostimulants useful in the combination therapy methods of the present invention can be administered in amounts lower than those conventional in the art. For example, interferon alpha is typically administered to humans for the treatment of HCV infections in an amount of from about 1 x 3O6 units/person three times per week to about 10 x 106 units/person three times per week (Simon et al., Hepatology 25: 445-448 (1997)). In the methods and compositions of the present invention, this dose can be in the range of from about 0. 1 x 106 units/person three times per week to about 7. 5 x 106 units/person three times per week; more preferably from about 0. 5 x 106 units/person three times per week to about 5 x 106 units/person three times per week; most preferably from about 1 x 106 units/person three times per week to about 3 x 106 units/person three times per week. Due to the enhanced hepatitis C virus antiviral effectiveness of immunomodulators and immunostimulants in the presence of the HCV serine protease inhibitors of the present invention, reduced amounts of these immunomodulators/immunostimulants can be employed in the methods and compositions disclosed herein. Similarly, due to the enhanced hepatitis C virus antiviral effectiveness of the present HCV serine protease inhibitors in the presence of immunomodulators and immunostimulants, reduced amounts of these HCV serine protease inhibitors can be employed in the methods and compositions disclosed herein. Such reduced amounts can be determined by routine monitoring of hepatitis C virus titers in infected patients undergoing therapy. This can be carried out by, for example, monitoring HCV RNA in patients' serum by slot-blot, dot-blot, or RT-PCR techniques, or by measurement of HCV surface or other antigens. Patients can be similarly monitored during combination therapy employing the HCV serine protease inhibitors disclosed herein and other compounds having anti-HCV activity, for example nucleoside and/or nucleotide antiviral agents, to determine the lowest effective doses of each when used in combination.<br>
In the methods of combination therapy disclosed herein, nucleoside or nucleotide antiviral compounds, or mixtures thereof, can be administered to humans in an amount in the range of from about 0.1 mg/pers on/day to about 500 mg/person/day; preferably from about 10 mg/person/day to about 300 mg/person/day; more preferably from about 25 mg/person/day to about 200 mg/person/day; even more preferably from about 50 mg/person/day to about 150 mg/person/day; and most preferably in the range of from about 1 mg/person/day to about 50 mg/person/day.<br>
Doses of compounds can be administered to a patient in a single dose or in proportionate multiple subdoses. In the latter case, dosage unit compositions can contain such amounts of<br><br>
278<br>
submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. Multiple doses per day can also increase the total daily dose should this be desired by the person prescribing the drug.<br>
The regimen for treating a patient suffering from a HCV infection with the compounds and/or compositions of the present invention is selected in accordance with a variety of factors, including the age, weight, sex, diet, and medical condition of the patient, the severity of the infection, the route of administration, pharmacological considerations such as the activity, efficacy, pharmacokineric, and toxicology profiles of the particular compounds employed, and whether a drug delivery system is utilized. Administration of the drug combinations disclosed herein should generally be continued over a period of several weeks to several months or years until virus titers reach acceptable levels, indicating that infection has been controlled or eradicated. Patients undergoing treatment with the drug combinations disclosed herein can be routinely monitored by measuring hepatitis viral RNA in patients' serum by slot-blot, dot-blot, or RT-PCR techniques, or by measurement of hepatitis C viral antigens, such as surface antigens, in serum to determine the effectiveness of therapy. Continuous analysis of the data obtained by these methods permits modification of the treatment regimen during therapy so that optimal amounts of each component in the<br>
combination are administered, and so that the duration of treatment can be determined as well. Thus, the treatment regimen/dosing schedule can be rationally modified over the course of therapy so that the lowest amounts of each of the antiviral compounds used in combination which<br>
together exhibit satisfactory anti-hepatitis C virus effectiveness are administered, and so that<br>

administration of such antiviral compounds in combination is continued only so long as is necessary to successfully treat the infection.<br>
The present invention encompasses the use of the HCV serine protease inhibitors disclosed herein in various combinations with the foregoing and similar types of compounds having anti-HCV activity to treat or prevent HCV infections in patients. For example, one or more HCV serine protease inhibitors can be used in combination with: one or more interferons or interferon derivatives having anti-HCV activity; one or more non-interferon compounds having anti-HCV activity; or one or more interferons or interferon derivatives having anti-HCV activity and one or more non-interferon compounds having anti-HCV activity. When used in combination to treat or prevent HCV infection in a human patient, any of the presently disclosed HCV serine protease inhibitors and foregoing compounds having anti-HCV activity can be present in a pharmaceutically or anti-HCV effective amount. By virtue of their additive or synergistic effects, when used in the combinations described above, each can also be present in a subclinical pharmaceutically effective or anti-HCV effective amount, i.e., an amount that, if used alone,<br><br>
279<br>
provides reduced pharmaceutical effectiveness in completely inhibiting or reducing the accumulation of HCV virions and/or reducing or ameliorating conditions or symptoms associated with HCV infection or pathogenesis in patients compared to such HCV serine protease inhibitors and compounds having anti-HCV activity when used in pharmaceutically effective amounts. In addition, the present invention encompasses the use of combinations of HCV serine protease inhibitors and compounds having anti-HCV activity as described above to treat or prevent HCV infections, where one or more of these inhibitors or compounds is present in a pharmaceutically effective amount, and the other(s) is(are) present in a subclinical pharmaceutically effective or anti-HCV effective amount(s) owing to their additive or synergistic effects. As used herein, the term "additive effect" describes the combined effect of two (or more) pharmaceutically active agents that is equal to the sum of the effect of each agent given alone. A syngergistic effect is one in which the combined effect of two (or more) pharmaceutically active agents is greater than the sum of the effect of each agent given alone.<br>
Example 42<br>
Current standard therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is treatment with the immunomodulator alpha-interferon (Chronic Hepatitis C: Current Disease Management, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, 1999). This therapy is ineffective in most HCV patients, who show either no response or a relapse even after prolonged interferon therapy. Additionally, there are severe side effects associated with interferon therapy.<br>
In view of the pressing need for new, more effective antiviral drugs to treat HCV infected patients, the present inventors have developed a series of compounds that inhibit the serine protease of HCV (a complex of HCV viral proteins NS3 and NS4A). These compounds can be used alone, together with one another, and in combination with other classes of compunds to treat or prevent HCV infection. This example describes the testing of three representative HCV serine protease inhibitors, i.e., Compound CU, Compound EP, and Compound EC, alone and in combination with individual members of a set of interferons (interferon alpha-2B (Schering-Plough), interferon alpha-2A (PBL Biomedical Laboratories, New Brunswick, NJ), interferon beta (Research Diagnostics Inc, Flanders, NJ), and ovine-interferon tau (Research Diagnostics Inc, Flanders, NJ)) in an HCV subgenomic RNA replicon assay (Replicon Assay) to determine if the two compounds act in concert to diminish HCV RNA accumulation. The Replicon Assay measures the amount of HCV subgenomic RNA (replicon RNA) remaining in replicon cells (Lohmann et at Science 285:110-113 (1999)) after two days of drug treatment relative to the<br><br>
280<br>
amount of replicon RNA in untreated cells, m this assay, the potency of compounds as HCV antiviral drugs is directly proportional to the level of inhibition of replicon. RNA accumulation.<br>
The two drugs are tested in combinations in the in vitro Replicon Assay system to determine whether, when used together, they exhibit additive or synergistic anti-HCV activity. The Replicon Assay is employed as a surrogate model for in vitro HCV infection to evaluate the combined effects of the immunomodulator, for example interferon-alpha 2B ((Intron A); Schering Plough), and the HCV serine protease inhibitor, for example Compound CU. As shown below, the results demonstrate that there is a clear synergistic anti-HCV effect of these two types of drugs as measured using formal mathematical determinations of synergy to analyze their capacity to reduce HCV RNA levels in the Replicon Assay.<br>
The Replicon Assay<br>
The Replicon Assay employing a cell line containing the self-replicating HCV subgenomic RNA (replicon) is described in Lohmann et al. Science 285:110-113 (1999). The Genbank accession number for the sequence of the replicon used in the experiments described herein is listed in this reference as AJ242654. This paper discloses methods for in vitro transcription of RNA from the replicon cDNA, transfection of the replicon RNA into Huh7 cells by electroporation, and selection of cells containing the replicon RNA using the antibiotic G418. Huh7 cells are a hepatoma cell line obtained from Dr. William Mason at Fox Chase Cancer Research Center (Philadelphia). These cells are publicly available from Fox Chase, and have been extensively described in the scientific literature (Nakabayashi et al. Cancer Res. 42:3858-3863 (1982)). In the experiments described herein, all of the template DNA is removed from the in vitro transcribed replicon RNA preparation prior to electroporation of this RNA into Huh7 cells by multiple treatment with DNase (three sequential treatments).<br>
The Replicon Assay is performed as described in detail below. Briefly, Replicon cells are placed in 96 well trays at a density of 10,000 cells per well and incubated 37°C. The cells are incubated in DMEM (Dulbecco's Minimal Essential Media) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine scrum, glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and the antibiotic G418 (0.25 mg/ml). After overnight incubation, the medium is replaced with DMEM containing 2% fetal bovine serum and various concentrations of the serine protease inhibitor, such as Compound CU, and/or an interferon such as interferon-alpha 2B (Intron A, Schering Plough). Each compound is tested at six to eight different concentrations. For one extreme of the range of concentrations, high concentrations of the compounds that will result in almost complete inhibition of replicon RNA<br><br>
281<br>
accumulation after two days of treatment are selected. From these starting concentrations, serial dilutions are made so that the concentration ranges tested in the Replicon Assay include concentrations at which the compounds are highly effective, as well as concentrations at which there is no significant effect. Each HCV serine protease inhibitor concentration is tested without any added interferon, as well as with the addiition of six to eight different interferon doses. Similarly, interferon is tested without any added HCV serine protease inhibitor. After a 48-hour incubation with the compounds, the medium is removed from the plates, and total cellular RNA is extracted from the cells using the RNeasy-96 kit manufactured by Qiagen Inc. (Valencia, CA). This RNA is then analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR, or TaqMan® (Applied Biosystems, Foster City CA). The TaqMan® RT-PCR target is the neomycin resistance gene in the replicon RNA. The plates are configured so that there are 5 replicates of each drug treatment sample, and 16 replicates of the untreated samples! This permits greater statistical confidence in the quantitative RT-PCR data.<br>
Analysis of the Replicon Assay data yields two values that are useful in assessing the potency of potential HCV antiviral agents. Ait each compound concentration tested, the level of inhibition in replicon RNA accumulation caused by the compound during two days of treatment relative to the amount of replicon RNA in untreated cells is determined. This is reported as percent inhibition. When a series of data points generated by treatments of cells at a range of<br>
concentrations has been obtained, IC50 values, i.e., the compound concentration at which HCV<br>
!i<br>
replicon RNA accumulation is diminished 50% by the compound, are generated. Through repeated testing of the HCV serine protease inhibitors in the Replicon Assay, it is determined that the IC50 has a percent coefficient of variation (%CV or 100% x standard deviation in the IC5o/mean IC50) of about 20%. The IC50 is the value used to rank individual compounds tested in this assay based on their potency as HCV antiviral agents. Simple IC50 determinations are inadequate to assess the utility of compounds used in combination. The most effective analysis of the array of data generated using all the combinations of different interferons and serine protease inhibitors requires evaluation of the percent inhibitions as shown in Table 7 using mathematical methods described below that are designed to determine if combination treatments are agonistic, additive, or synergistic.<br>
Details of the Replicon Assay are as follows:<br>
Procedure for Quantitative Analysis of HCV Replicon RNA in the HCV Replicon Assay Usinc TanMan®® RT-PCR<br><br>
282<br>
The Replicon Assay is used to measure the capacity of potential HCV antiviral compounds to inhibit the accumulation of a HCV subgenomic RNA replicon molecule in a Huh7 cell line (Lohmann et al. Replication of Subgenomic Hepatitis C Virus RNAs in a Hepatoma Cell Line. Science 285, 110-113 (1999)). This assay comprises three operational components : (1) Replicon cell maintenance, assay plate set up, and compound application; (2) Extraction of total cellular RNA from replicon cells; and (3) Real time RT-PCR (TaqMan®) to measure the mount of replicon RNA in each sample. The Replicon Assay requires at least 4 days to perform; however, the process can be interrupted and samples frozen between steps. Each assay component is described below.<br>
1. Replicon cell maintenance, assay plate setup, and compound application<br>
1.1	Replicon cell line maintenance<br>
The cell line used in the Replicon Assay is produced as described in Lohmann et al. (Replication of Subgenomic Hepatitis C Virus RNAs in a Hepatoma Cell Line. Science 285,110-113 (1999)). After 150 cm2 cell culture flasks (Costar) containing Replicon cells are incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 and become confluent, the cells are diluted 1:10, v/v, into fresh 150 cm2 cell culture flasks. The medium is DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), IX non-essential amino acids (NEAA), IX Glutamine (Glu), and 0.25 mg/ml G418. Three serial passages are performed, each time allowing the cells to become confluent, followed by dilution of the cells into fresh 150 cm2 cell culture flasks. These cells, referred to as "original cells," are then aliquoted and stored for future use in the Replicon Assay. TaqMan -based analysis is performed to determine the number of HCV replicon genomes per cell, which reveals the presence of-150 copies of the replicon per cell. This is based on the ratio of copies of replicon RNA to two times the copies of the human apoB gene (number of haploid genomes).<br>
1.1.1     Original cells are stored in liquid N2. For cells used in the Replicon Assay, after 20 serial passages, cells are abandoned, and a fresh lot is revived from liquid N2 storage.<br>
1.2	Plating of cells in 96-well trays for the Replicon Assay<br>
1.2.1.   For preparation of 96-well plates, a 75% confluent 75 cm2 flask of replicon-containing cells are trypsinized, and resuspended in 10 ml Medium A. Trypsinization is performed by removing the medium, adding 1 ml of trypsin-EDTA 0.25%, w/v, and then removing the trypsin-EDTA. After 5-10 minutes the cells release from the flask and are resuspended in medium.<br><br>
283<br>
1.2.2.	Cells are counted using a hemacytometer, and the cell concentration is adjusted to 105<br>
cells/ ml.<br>
1.2.3.	Each well is seeded with a 100 (.il cell suspension using an Impact2 multi-channel pipette<br>
(Matrix), never plating more than four 96-well plates from a single cell suspension.<br>
1.2.4.	96-well plates are incubated at 37°C overnight.<br>
1.3.      Compound dilution and application to replicon cell trays<br>
1.3.1.	HCV serine protease inhibitor compounds are dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to<br>
a final concentration of 20 mM. Interferons are suspended in phosphate buffered saline<br>
solution containing 0.1 % w/v bovine serum albumin.<br>
1.3.2.	The 20 mM compound solution is diluted to lmM with DMSO.<br>
1.3.3.	50 ul of compound dissolved in DMSO are added to 10 ml Medium B (the compound<br>
concentration is 5 mM, and the DMSO concentration is now 0.5%), or 20 ul of 1 mM<br>
compound and 30 Hi DMSO are added to 10 ml Medium B (compound concentration is 2<br>
HM.)<br>
1.3.4.	Compound dilution to final concentration is completed by mixing compound/Medium B<br>
solution with Medium C (contains 0.5% DMSO). Serial one to five dilutions of the<br>
compound are made with Medium C in a 2 ml polypropylene 96-well block to obtain the<br>
desired final concentrations of compound.<br>
1.3-5.   The cell plate is removed from the 37°C incubator and labeled on the top right corner of the lid and the right side of the base. The medium is poured off of the 96-well plates.<br>
1.3.6.	100 \il compound/medium solutions from each well of the 96-well dilution block are<br>
added to the 96-well cell plate using an Impact2 Pipette.<br>
1.3.7.	100 ul medium C are added to all the untreated wells according to Table 3 for testing<br>
compounds at either 1, 3, or 6 different concentrations. "Untx" refers to mock-treated<br>
cells (DMSO added at the same concentration as in treated cells); "Con ."refers to<br>
compound concentration.<br>

2. Extraction of total cellular RNA from renlicon cells<br>
2J     Introduction<br>
The goal of the procedure is to extract RNA from in vitro tissue culture samples so that the viral or ccllulaj RNA is quantitatively recovered and pure enough to be analyzed by quantitative HCV RT-PCR assay.<br>
To permit detection of variations in the efficiency of the RNA extraction, standard amounts of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), an RNA virus with some similarity to HCV, are added to each cell sample before RNA extraction. Thus, the level of BVDV RNA detected in the final multiplex RT-PCR reaction should be consistent among all wells within the variability limits<br><br>
286<br>
associated with the Replicon Assay. This RNA extraction efficiency internal control is discussed further in the TaqMan® section, below.<br>
The RNA extraction approach used is the RNeasy-96 method manufactured by Qiagen Inc. (Valencia, CA). This method employs 96 silica-based mini-columns that are positioned in an array compatible with 96-well tissue culture operations. The RNA extraction technology is a modification of the Boom method, in which all cellular proteins and Ducleic acid, including nucleases, are first denatured with a strong chaotropic salt (guanidinium thiocyanate). In this environment, nucleic acids have a strong affinity for silica, the material in the mini-column discs; however, proteins and other contaminants do not bind to silica, and pass through the columns. After washing the columns with chaotropic/ethanol solutions, the samples are partially dried, and the nucleic acid is then released from the column in a small volume of water.<br>
To reduce variability in recovering HCV RNA, care is taken with the column washing and partial drying conditions. The presence of a small amount of ethanol on a column will contaminate the final RNA and interfere with the RT-PCR detection system. Caution is required in all phases of this procedure because the starting samples may be biohazardous, the chaotropic salt is highly caustic, and as a thiocyanate, it can generate poisonous cyanide gas if allowed to come in contact with acidic environments.<br><br><br>

3. TanMan® RT-FCR and Date Analysis<br>
25<br>
3.1       Introduction: Real-time quantitative RT-PCR is used to measure the amount of HCV<br>
replicon RNA in each sample. This technology is also referred to as thePCR-based 5' nuclease assay, and TaqMan®. The analytic instrument is the Applied BJosystems 7700 Prism Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). This instrument is essentially a time-30      multiplexed laser-induced fluorescence spectrograph coupled with a thermal cycler. It monitors the accumulation of PCR ampKcon in each weil of a 96-well sample tray throughout the course of the PCR process.<br>
3.2.      Use of BVDV Internal Control: As mentioned in the previous section, an internal 35     positive control is incorporated into every sample. This serves as a measure of RNA extraction<br><br>
290<br>
efficiency, and shows if the sample contains contaminants that inhibit TaqMan® PCR. BVDV is mixed with the chaotropic cell lysis buffer prior to applying the lysis buffer to the cells. Although the positive control is in every sample, the BVDV internal positive control assay is only performed when the HCV replicon RNA assay data fall outside of expected limits, suggesting that there could be a problem with the samples. The 7700 is capable of simultaneously monitoring the accumulation of two different PCR amplicons in the same tube by using detection probes labeled with two different fluorescent reporter dyes ("multiplexing")- Specific criteria that elicit a TaqMan  analysis for the BVDV internal positive control of a sample plate are described in the section on data analysis (3.6).<br>
3.3       HCV Replicon RNA TaqMan® probe and primers. Because of the expected genetic stability and general lack of RNA secondary structure in the neomycin resistance gene (neo) encoded in the replicon, primers and a probe that bind in that region are employed. This segment of the replicon RNA extends from bases 342-1193 of the 8001 base pair replicon (SEQ ID NO: 1):<br><br><br>

If there is a significant deviation from protocol, reagent failure or mishap, or ABI7700 run failure, data can be discarded. For rejection of any data points from an apparently normal run, then one or more of these criteria must be met. The standard deviation of percentage inhibition should be less than 30% in active compounds. The %CV of HCV copy number should be less than 30%. The standard deviation of HCV Ct of all samples should be less than 0.5; this is usually about 0.1 to 0.3 in most samples. If the HCV Ct standard deviation is more than 0.5, then go back to the raw data table, and check the<br><br>
296<br>
Ct numbers of 5 replicates. If the Ct number of any one well is 2 Ct different from the average Ct number of 5 replicates, then this well should omitted from the analysis. If more than 3 wells (not on same column) have unusual Ct numbers, then the BVDV TaqMan® internal control assay should be carried out. If the BVDV data show irregularity, then the compound should be tested again.<br>
3.6.5.         IC50 calculation: Copy and paste the data of average inhibition and standard deviation into a sigmoid dose response with a variable slope calculator that uses non-linear regression methods. Using this tool, calculate the IC50 by using both of two methods: fixing the top at 100% inhibition only, or fixing the top at 100% inhibition and the bottom at 0% inhibition. The method that gives the clearest fit is then reported for each compound. The most reliable IC50 comes from the calculation having the lowest standard error. If IC50S calculated from these two curve fit options show more than one fold difference, or if the IC50 SD is greater than the IC50, the compound should be tested again at adjusted concentrations.<br>
Calculation of the Effect of HCV Serine Protease Inhibitors in Combination with Interferons<br>
30      Then no interaction or Lowe additivity is defined by the following relationship, where the combination of concentration D1 of INF and D2 of HSPI produces the effect E.<br>
The effect of a HCV serine protease inhibitor (HSPI) and an interferon in combination can be assessed in the Replicon Assay by generating a dose response curve for the HSPI in the presence of various levels of interferon, or by determining a dose response curve for an interferon in the presence of various levels of HSPI. The goal is to assess whether there is more or less inhibition of viral RNA accumulation than would be expected if the two drugs produce additive effects on the RNA. More specifically, the additivity definition of Lowe ((1928) Die Quantitation Probleme der Pharmakologic, Ergebn. PhysioL, 27, 47-187) is used. This is defined as follows. Let DE,INF be the concentration of interferon that results in effect E, and let DE,HSPI be the concentration of protease inhibitor that results in effect E.<br><br><br>
297<br>
The degree of synergy or antagonism is expressed in terms of iso-effect curves or Isobols. The combination (D1,D2) is a point on a graph where the axes are the concentrations of interferon and HSPI (Fig. 2). All such combinations that produce an effect level E form the E effect Isobol. It is necessarily the case that (DE,INF,0) and (0, DE,HSPI) are points on the Isobol. The Isobols are straight lines connecting points (DE^.O) and (0, DE,HSPI) when the additivity relationship (1) is satisfied.<br>
Concave-up Isobols indicate synergy, and concave-down Isobols indicate antagonism. Following the guidelines of Berenbaum, M. C. ((1985) The expected effect of a combination of agents: the general solution. J. Tlieor. Biol, 114,413-431), and Greco, Park and Rustom ((1990) Application of a New Approach for the Quantitation of Drug Synergisra to the Combination of cis-Diamminedichloroplatinum and 1-fi-D-Arabinofuranosylcytosine, Cancer Research, 50,5318-5327), add a term to (1) to account for synergy or antagonism. The equation defines a response surface that can be fit to the percent control values at all treatment combinations. Contour plots from this fitted response surface are the Isobols.<br>
The concentrations that give a specified level of activity E alone are given by (3)<br><br>
The response surface model assumes a sigmoidal dose response for each compound defined by (2).<br><br>
To satisfy the model of Greco et al (1990), the combined action of the drugs must then satisfy equation (4) for every combination of drugs that produces response level E.<br><br><br>
298<br>
The parameter a measures the amount of interaction. A zero value of alpha means no interaction or additivity since the equation reduces to (1) when a = 0. Given IC50S, Hill slopes (m), maximum value (Emax), and minimum value (B), this equation can be solved to give the effect that results from any treatment combination [INF] and [HSPTJ. Therefore, this equation defines a response surface. Given an experiment where [INF] and [HSPI] are varied, the parameters can be chosen using nonlinear weighted least squares regression. The parameter a can be related to a synergy measure S (Hewlett, P. S. (1969) Measurement of potencies of drug mixtures. Biometrics, 25, 477-487), which is taken directly from the Isobols at a 50% effect. S is the ratio, of the distance from the origin to the Isobol defining additivity, to the distance from the origin to Isobol of the fitted data, along the line at 45 degrees from the axes. (S=ON/OM see Figure 3). The relationship is a = 4(S2 - S).<br>
The method discussed in Greco et al. (1990), above, for fitting the response surface and determining synergy parameter a with its significance level is followed in assessing the degree of synergy in a series of experiments testing HSPIs in combination with several different interferons. However, there is a need to weight observations with lower counts more than those with higher counts. The counts relate directly to the percent control, which is the effect E. Using methods described in Carroll, RJ. and Rupert, D. ((1988) (Transformation and Weighting in RegressiontChaprnzn and Hall, New York), the well to well variability can be seen to increase with the square of the mean percent control value. Therefore, the observations are weighted by one over the fitted percent control value (E) squared. The variance and weighting used to analyze these experiments is consistent with variability relationships observed by researchers investigating methods for analyzing Radioligand assays (Finney, D. J., (1976), Radioligand Assay, Biometrics, 32,721-740, and Dudley, R. A. Edwards, P., Ekins, R.P., McKinzie, I. G. M., Raab, G.M., Rodbard, D. and Rodgers, R.P.C. (1985), Guidelines for Immunoassay Data Processing, Clinical Chemistry, 31/8, 1264-1271).<br>
Results<br>
30	In an initial experiment, HCV serine protease inhibitor Compound CU is tested over a<br>
concentration range from 3 (iM to 0.0123 uM, i.e., a,244-fold range. The interferon-alpha 2B concentrations vary from 30 units per sample to 0.0096 units per sample, i.e., a 3125-fold range. As shown in Table 7, when used as a single drug treatment, Compound CU exhibits an IC50 of 0.48 uM, and the interferon IC50 is 2. IS' U. Within the precision of the Replicon Assay, which is<br><br>

25<br>
30<br><br>

approximately 20%, addition of interferon-alpha 2B results in an increase in the inhibition of replicon RNA accumulation in a dose-dependent manner.   For example, treatment of cells with 0.333 fiM Compound CU results in 28% inhibition of replicon RNA accumulation. Treatment of cells with a combination of 0.333 jiM Compound CU, which is 71% of the IC50 dose (0.469 joM) and 0.24 U of interferon-alpha 2B, which is 11% of the interferon-alpha 2B IC50 (2.05 uM) results in a 49% inhibition of replicon RNA accumulation. Thus, 71% of one IC50 dose in combination with 11% of the other results in 49% inhibition of replicon RNA accumulation. Using an intuitive approach to determining if a combination treatment is synergistic or additive or antagonistic, one could predict that if effect of combination treatment were only additive, one would expect the combined fractions of the two IC50 doses needed to obtain a 49% inhibition of replicon RNA accumulation to be 98%.   Our experimental results demonstrate that the level of inhibition of replicon RNA accumulation is achieved using 71% plus 11%, i.e. 82% of the IC50 dose rather than 98%, as predicted for additive effects of combination treatment. Thus at these concentrations of compounds, the effect appears to be synergistic because smaller fractional doses of the IC50 dose of each compound are used to obtain 49% inhibition of HCV replicon RNA than would be required of either compound alone, where 98% of the IC50 doses would be needed. The results of this combination treatment are shown in Table 8 and graphically in Figure 1.<br><br>

These initial results, derived as stated earlier via use of the in vitro Replicon Assay and a simple additivity analysis of the data generated by that assay, demonstrate that combination treatment of replicon cells with an HCV serine protease inhibitor and an interferon yields at least an additive antiviral effect, and likely a synergistic antiviral effect<br>
The foregoing data have been reanalyzed using the formal mathematical tools described above to determine if the relationship between HCV serine protease inhibitor CU and interferon alpha-2B is synergeistic, additive, or antagomstic. The reanalyzed data are shown numerically in Table 8, and graphically in Figure 4.<br>
Table 8 summarizes further results obtained in the Replicon Assay after treatment of replicon-containing cells for 48 hours with various HCV serine protease inhibitors of the present invention and several different interferons, individually or in combination. We point out that the standard deviation of values measured for inhibition of HCV replicon RNA in the Replicon Assay is -20%. Compounds are tested over a broad concentration range and at lower compound concentrations that cause no significant inhibition of HCV replicon RNA concentration. Because of the ~20% standard deviation of the assay, some data points will generate negative numbers. Negative inhibition numbers indicate in a particular experiment there is on average more HCV replicon RNA molecules in the compound treated samples than in the mock treated samples.<br><br>

As shown in Figures 4-13, which graphically depict the data in Table 8 plotted using the above-described mathematical method for measuring synergy, the Isobol curves for all combinations of HCV serine proteae inhibitors and interferons tested are concave-up, indicating that the antiviral effect of the treatments in the Replicon Assay is synergistic. These results are tabulated in Table 9, which shows relative levels of synergy for combination treatment and IC50 values for antiviral compounds used individually. The key elements in Table 9 are the a values, and the p-values for the determinations. The a term is a measure of the maximum inflection of the Isobols for each combination treatment. An a value of zero indicates additivity, a negative value indicates antagonism, and as is the case in the combination treatments with the HCV serine protease inhibitors and interferons shown above, a value greater than one indicates synergy. The larger the a parameter, the greater the synergy. As shown in Table 9 for the combinations of HCV serine protease inhibitors and interferons, even ignoring significance levels in each experiment, a t test based on the 9 experiments for the average alpha value being 0 (no interaction) has a p-value of 0.00014, indicating that the results are highly significant.<br>
The calculation of synergy based on the method of Greco Rustom ((1990) Application of a New Approach for the Quantitation of Drug Synergism to the Combination of cis-Diamminedichloroplatinum and 1-B-D-Arabinofuranosylcytosine, Cancer Research, 50, 5318-5327) used in this analysis is an ideal tool for evaluation of the kind of experimental data that can be generated using the HCV Replicon Assay. There are other methods that are applied to studies of antiviral compounds such as Pritchard and Shipman (Prichard, M.N., and Shipman, C. Jr., (1990) "A three-dimensional model to analyze drug-drug interactions (review)," Antiviral Res. 14: 181-206). Application of their synergy calculation method to the data shown in Table 8 also indicates combination treatment of the replicon cells with an HCV serine protease inhibitor and interferon will result in a synergistic inhibition of HCV replicon RNA accumulation (data not shown).<br><br>

Another measure for evaluating the synergistic nature of anti-HCV drug treatment using the present HCV serine protease inhibitors and interferons is to use the same methods described above to evaluate the current standard combination therapy for HCV, i.e., interferon alpha-2B in combination with Ribavirin in the Replicon Assay. The last line of Table 9 shows that the a parameter for a mixture of interferon alpha-2B and Ribavirin is a negative number, indicating that there is a small amount of antagonism between these two drugs. This further emphasizes the significance of the combination treatments disclosed herein employing the present HCV serine protease inhibitors in combination with interferons in that these treatments clearly produce synergy, while the standard combination therapy in use for HCV (interferon alpha-2B in combination with Ribavirin) is not synergistic in the Replicon Assay.<br>
The foregoing comparison of combination treatments employing the present HCV serine protease inhibitors plus interferons versus Ribavirin plus interferon in the Replicon Assay clearly indicates that the former are synergistic, while the latter is not. The experimental results obtained using the Replicon Assay indicate that a much lower dose of interferon would be efficacious if the<br><br>

interferon is used in combination with a HCV serine protease inhibitor than is needed when interferon alpha-2B is used in combination with Ribavirin. The Replicon Assay is a useful model system in which to test potential anti-HCV compounds, and is currently widely relied upon as an effective predictor of compound anti-HCV activity. Note, for example, Blight et al. (2000) Efficient Initiation of HCV RNA Replication in Cell Culture. Science 8; 290:1972-1974, and Chung et al. (2001) Hepatitis C virus replication is directly inhibited by IFN-a in a full-length binary expression system. Proc. Nat Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 98(17):9847-52. Ribavirin alone is marginally effective in reducing the accumulation of HCV replicon RNA in the Replicon Assay (Table 8, Experiment 10 and last line of Table 9). This result is in apparent conflict with in vivo studies where, when used by itself, Ribavirin has no significant therapeutic value for the treatment of HCV. In contrast, in the Replicon Assay, correcting for cytotoxicity as discussed below, Ribavirin has an IC50 of 145 \JM. This result can be explained by recognizing that the Replicon Assay permits evaluation of high Ribavirin concentrations that would not be possible in human therapy due to in vivo cytotoxicity (Chutaputti A. (2000) Adverse effects and other safety aspects of the hepatitis C antivirals. Journal of'Gastroenterology and Hepatology. 15 Suppl:E 156-63). This evaluation necessarily requires assessment of the cytotoxicity of Ribavirin. Such toxicity occurs in patients and in cellular assays (Shiffman M. L., Verbeke S. B., Kimball P. M. (2000) Alpha interferon combined with ribavirin potentiates proliferative suppression but not cytokine production in mitogenically stimulated human lymphocytes. Antiviral Research. 48(2):91-9). In the experiments disclosed herein, Ribavirin cytotoxicity in the Replicon Assay is observed and measured in two ways. In both the XTT metabolic assay to determine replicon cell viability (Roehm N.W., Rodgers G. H,, Hatfield S. M., Glasebrook A. L. (1991) An improved colorimetric assay for cell proliferation and viability utilizing the tetrazolium salt XTT. Journal of Immunol Methods. 142(2):257-65) and in the TaqMan® quantitative RT-PCR assay that measures glyceraldehyde-3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA levels in treated versus untreated cells in the Replicon Assay (Brink N., Szamel M., Young A.R., Wittern K.P., Bergemann J. (2000) Comparative quantification of IL-lbeta, IL-10, IL-lOr, TKFalpha and IL-7 mRNA levels in UV-irradiated human skin in vivo. Inflamation Research. 49(6):290-6), significant Ribavirin-induced cytotoxicity is observed, but is corrected for as follows. It is-assumed that the level of GAPDH mRNA, which is a constitutively expressed housekeeping gene, is the same in all viable cells. It is known from measurements of GAPDH mRNA levels in cells treated with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D that the half life of GAPDH mRNA is only a few hours (data not shown). Thus, it is postulated, as done by others using TaqMan  technology to determine the levels of particular mRNAs in human cells, that GAPDH mRNA levels are<br><br>
309<br>
proportional to viable cell numbers (VCN) in any given sample, with the relationship of VCN= 2A(40-QGAPDH IDRNA)- The VCN is computed for each of the Replicon Assay sample wells, and then we divide the HCV Replicon RNA copy number for a specific well by the VCN for that well. Once computed, this ratio is used instead of the HCV copy number to compute inhibition ("Avg. Inh using ratio"; Fig 14.A). Without correcting the Replicon Assay data for this cytotoxicity, such cytotoxicity is read as false positive inhibition of HCV RNA replicon accumulation. In the Replicon Assay, it is assumed that the measured inhibition of HCV RNA replicon accumulation is the sum of the actual inhibition of HCV RNA replicon accumulation and the apparent inhibition of HCV RNA replicon accumulation due to cytoxicity. It is furthermore assumed that, based on the close correlation of the XTT and TaqMan® GAPPH mRNA measures of cytotoxicity, the inhibition of accumulation of GAPDH mRNA caused by compounds tested in the Replicon Assay is a reliable measure of apparent inhibition of HCV RNA replicon accumulation due to cytoxicity. Thus, the true anti-HCV activity of a compound in the Replicon Assay corrected for general cytotoxicity can be estimated by dividing the number of HCV replicon RNA molecules measured in each sample by the VCN, thus normalizing to the number of viable cells in each sample. Using this method, Fig. 14.A shows an estimate of true Ribavirin anti-HCV activity in the Replicon Assay ("Avg. Inh using ratio")- The estimate of the IC50 for Ribavirin is best calculated using this method. In Fig. 14.A, "Avg. Inh original" shows the uncorrected IC50 for Ribavirin, which is approximately 80 ULM, whereas the corrected IC50 value calculated from the "Avg. Inh using ratio" curve is approximately 145 [iM. Note that the difference between corrected and measured inhibition of HCV RNA replicon accumulation as a result of interferon alpha-2B treatment (Fig. I4.B) is insignificant in view of the -20% %CV of the Replicon Assay. Like interferon alpha-2B, the HCV serine protease inhibitors tested in the present example exhibit no significant cytotoxicity at the concentrations employed. This is determined using XTT assays, in which the TC50 values for the various compounds are: CU=64.7 uM , EP&gt;10 pM, and EC&gt;50 u.M. These TC50 values are 20-140 fold greater than the IC50 values shown in Table 9. Thus, cytotoxicity of these compounds has no significant effect on HCV RNA accumulation in the Replicon Assay within the precision of the assay because such cytotoxicity occurs only at HCV serine protease inhibitor concentrations significantly greater than those tested in the Replicon Assay.<br>
Conclusions Regarding the Efficacy of HCV Serine Protease Inhibitors and Interferons. Individually and in Combination<br>
The anti-HCV activities of the present HCV serine protease inhibitors and various interferons when used alone in the HCV Replicon Assay are shown in the columns and lines of<br><br>
310<br>
the individual experiments making up Table 8 that employ only one antiviral agent. Table 9 lists the IC50 values measured for each antiviral compound when tested alone. The foregoing results, derived via use of the in vitro Replicon Assay, also demonstrate that combination treatment of replicon cells with HCV serine protease inhibitors of the present invention and various interferons yields synergistic antiviral effects. It is fully expected that these effects will translate into in vivo effectiveness.<br>
Combination therapy employing HCV serine protease inhibitors of the present invention possesses several major advantages over single drug therapy. First, by making treatment possible with lower doses of the individual drugs than would be possible if used alone, one would expect a reduction in toxicity and side effects associated with treatment. This is especially important in the case of interferon therapy, where the side effects are severe, and have been shown to be proportional to the dose administered to patients. The foregoing data indicate that a dose of HCV serine protease inhibitor such as CU at the IC95 level could be combined with a dose of interferon alpha, for example at the IC50 level, and the result would be much more effective therapy than could be achieved with the HCV serine protease inhibitor alone without the adverse side effects caused by high doses of interferon alpha. A second major benefit of combination therapy is that because the two drugs act independently, there is less chance of development of mutant HCV strains that resist treatment. Development of resistance is a major concern with RNA viruses like HCV. Because of their high rate of mutation, such viruses can rapidly adapt to environmental stresses. A third benefit of combination therapy may be reduced cost, due to the need for lower amounts of therapeutic agents required for effective treatment.<br>
Additional immunomodulators that can be employed in the methods disclosed herein include, for example, alpha interferon 2A, consensus interferon, tau interferon, interferon + Ribavirin (Rebatron), pegylated interferon, and promoters of interferon gene expression. It is fully anticipated that the anti-HCV activity of these compounds will be improved when used in combination with HCV serine protease inhibitors such as those disclosed herein. As interferons are known to be active in vivo and in the Replicon Assay, it is expected that the present HCV serine protease inhibitors will also be active in vivo, and more importantly, be capable of eliciting synergistic activity when used in combination with interferons, immune system stimulators thereof, or other compounds having HCV antiviral activity that act by a mechanism other than inhibition of the HCV serine protease.<br>
The best current therapy for HCV employs interferon alpha and the nucleoside analog Ribavirin. This treatment is only marginally effective, and results in significant side effects that diminish patient compliance (Chronic Hepatitis C: Current Disease Management, U.S.<br><br>
311<br>
Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, 1999). Additionally, in transplant patients, it is not clear the Ribavirin-interferon combination works, and may in fact be worse than interferon alone (Chronic Hepatitis C: Current Disease Management, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, 1999).<br>
The results presented above demonstrate a synergistic combination effect when interferons are used with a new class of HCV antivirals, the serine protease inhibitors of the present invention. We fully expect that the in vitro results disclosed herein will lead to more effective treatment of HCV patients than is currently possible using interferon alone. Sub-therapeutic doses of interferon could mobilize the patient's immune system to better fight the virus, and the serine protease inhibitor could attack the virus directly, dealing the virus a two-pronged attack via different mechanisms of action. Treatment of HCV infection could thus be achieved at reduced cost to the patient in terms of both diminished side effects and lower payments for necessary pharmaceutical agents as less of both drugs would be needed for effective HCV antiviral therapy.<br>
