				<td>METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR DETERMINING A MOTION<br>
VECTOR FOR ENCODING A PIXEL, SET<br>
FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
The present invention relates to method and system for determining a<br>
motion vector for encoding a pixel set, and pertains generally to video processing, and<br>
more particularly to a method and system of encoding video data.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Encoding of digital video data is generally performed in order to compress the<br>
amount of data needed to represent a video stream. It is known in the art to encode a frame one<br>
set of pixels at a time. For example, each macroblock of a frame can be encoded by comparing<br>
the macroblock's pixels to the pixels of other macroblocks of a frame that has been previously<br>
displayed, or decoded. Once a set of pixels in the previous frame that corresponds closely to the<br>
set of pixels being encoded is found, a motion vector pointing to that set of pixels is identified.<br>
Once a motion vector to the set of pixels is identified, any information difference between the<br>
two sets of pixels can be quantified and efficiently compressed.<br>
Known methods of encoding will correlate the set of pixels being encoded<br>
to sets of pixels in the previous frame or a portion of the previous frame until a<br>
correlation threshold is met. Once the correlation threshold is met, it is known that a<br>
pixel set in a previous frame that corresponds sufficiently close to the pixel set being<br>
encoded has been found. In one such technique disclosed in United States Patent<br>
5,872,604 (Ogura), a conventional motion detection search is made in one search area and<br>
a second search is performed in a larger area. The searches are performed in parallel<br>
without one search being dependent on the other. Due to the large amount of data<br>
associated with video streams, and video frames, the encoding process can be a very time-<br>
consuming process. Therefore, a system or method capable of more efficiently encoding<br>
pixels sets would be useful.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a method of<br>
determining a motion vector for a pixel set being encoded, said method comprising the<br>
steps of:<br>
selecting a first search window of a first frame of video data, the first search window<br>
having a first window size;<br>
determining if a pixel set associated with the first search window meets a first correlation<br>
requirement with respect to the pixel set being encoded;<br>
determining a motion vector for the pixel set being encoded when any pixel set associated<br>
with the first search window meets the first correlation requirement; and<br>
when no pixel set associated with the first search window meets the first correlation<br>
requirement:<br>
selecting a second search window of the first frame of video data, the second<br>
search window having a second window size larger than the first window size;<br>
determining if a pixel set associated with the second search window meets a<br>
second correlation requirement with respect to the pixel set being encoded, the<br>
second correlation requirement being different from the first correlation<br>
requirement; and<br>
determining a motion vector for the pixel set being encoded when any pixel set<br>
associated with the second search window meets the second correlation<br>
requirement.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
[0004] Figure 1 illustrates, in block diagram form, the graphical representation of a<br>
reference frame of video data in accordance with the present disclosure;<br>
[0005] Figure 2 illustrates, in flow diagram form, a method in accordance with the<br>
present disclosure; and<br>
[0006] Figure 3 illustrates, in block diagram form, a system for implementing specific<br>
embodiments of the present disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES<br>
[0007] In accordance with the specific embodiment of the present disclosure, a first<br>
window is selected in a reference frame of video data. The first window contains one or more<br>
pixel sets, each that are to be correlated with a pixel set being encoded to determine a correlation<br>
factor. In addition, a first threshold value is determined for the first search window. The first<br>
threshold value is the value to which correlation factors are compared. For example, if a<br>
correlation factor between a specific pixel set of the first search window and the pixel set being<br>
encoded meets the first threshold value, a successful match between the two pixel sets has been<br>
found, and a corresponding motion vector can be assigned to the pixel set being encoded.<br>
[0008] If none of the pixel sets within the first window meet the first threshold value,<br>
a second search window within the first frame is selected. A second threshold value different<br>
than the first threshold value, is determined for the second search window. Typically, the second<br>
threshold value will be less stringent than the first threshold value. The correlation factors for<br>
the pixel sets of the second search window that are correlated to the pixel set being encoded are<br>
compared to the second threshold value. By using multiple search windows with varying<br>
threshold values, a more efficient encoding process can be obtained. For example, by setting the<br>
first search window to be relatively small, a faster match can be expected while maintaining a<br>
high correlation level. This provides a decoder system a mechanism to set a trade off between<br>
processing power of an encode process, and the desired quality of the encode process. Figures 1<br>
through 4 further illustrate specific embodiments of the present disclosure.<br>
[0009] Figure 1 illustrates frames F1 102 and F2 104. Frame Fl 102 represents a<br>
reference frame with respect to the frame F2 104 that is being encoded. Frame Fl 102 is a<br>
reference frame in that the pixel data associated with frame Fl will be available, and used, at the<br>
time that pixel sets of frame F2 104 are being encoded or decoded. Therefore, during the<br>
encoding process each pixel set, such as a macroblock or a block, of frame F2 104 will be<br>
compared against a portion of Frame Fl 102 to determine whether a substantially similar set of<br>
pixels resides within Frame Fl 102. A specific embodiment of the present disclosure will be<br>
further discussed with reference to the method of Figure 2 and frame data of FIG. 1.<br>
[0010] At step 201 a first search window size and location is determined. For<br>
example, referring to Figure 1, the search window 111 is defined. The search window 111<br>
represents an area of frame Fl 102 that has one or more pixel sets that will be correlated to<br>
macroblock F2/52. Note that F2/52 refers to the macroblock at macroblock location 52 in frame<br>
F2 104, which is the macroblock being encoded. It will be further appreciated, that within<br>
specific search windows, the searches are not constrained by specific pixel sets, such as<br>
macroblock boundaries. In other words, the pixel sets identified within a search window can<br>
reside across encoding pixel set boundaries. In one embodiment, the first search window 111<br>
contains a single pixel set to be searched. In other embodiments, multiple pixel sets are<br>
contained with the first search window.<br>
[0011] It will be appreciated that the location of the first search window is generally<br>
be based upon a predicted motion vector. It will be appreciated that there are many method of<br>
predicting motion vectors, and how the initial location of the first search window is determined<br>
can be determined by a variety of methods.<br>
[0012] At step 202 of Figure 2, a correlation threshold is set for the first window. As<br>
the pixel set being encoded is correlated to the pixel sets of the first window a correlation factor<br>
is determined. This correlation factor is compared to the correlation threshold of the first<br>
window to determine when a successful match between the pixel sets has been found. Generally,<br>
the correlation threshold for the first window would be set relatively high, compared to other<br>
correlation thresholds, because the number of pixels sets within the first window is relatively<br>
small. Because of the relatively small number pixel sets anticipated within the first window, a<br>
somewhat higher correlation factor can be used without affecting performance.<br>
[0013] At step 203, a search window pixel set is determined. With respect to Figure<br>
1 a single search window pixel set may be present. Regardless, one pixel set within the search<br>
window will be identified.<br>
[0014] At step 204, a correlation factor is determined between the pixel set being<br>
encoded and the search window pixel set. The correlation factor can be determined using any of<br>
a variety of correlation techniques. Such techniques can be as simple as subtracting one pixel set<br>
from the other to determine a difference between the pixel sets. Other techniques can be more<br>
complicated. For example, where the pixel set information represents spatial data, the correlation<br>
technique can perform a mathematical transform to convert the data to non-spatial pixel set data.<br>
For example, sub-sampling techniques and/or techniques that operate on frequency domain data<br>
can be used. Furthermore, it will be appreciated, that each application of the step 204, in the loop<br>
formed by steps 204-205-211-210, can apply the same correlation technique or different<br>
correlation techniques. For example, the first search window location can use a different<br>
correlation technique than a subsequent search window.<br>
[0015] At step 205, a determination is made whether or not the correlation factor<br>
meets the correlation threshold identified in step 202. If the correlation factor does meet the <br>
correlation threshold the flow proceeds to step 206 where a motion vector is used corresponding<br>
to the search window pixel set. If at step 205 the correlation factor does not meet the correlation<br>
threshold, the flow proceeds to step 211. Note that in an embodiment where the current window<br>
is to be the last window searched, the correlation threshold can be set so that it will never be met.<br>
This would allow the pixel set with the best correlation factor to be selected at step 221.<br>
[0016] At step 211a determination is made whether or not more search window pixel<br>
sets exist in the current search window. If so, the flow proceeds to step 210, otherwise the flow<br>
proceeds to step 209.<br>
[0017] At step 210, a next search window pixel set is determined within the current<br>
window. Once the next search window pixel set is determined the flow proceeds to step 204. A<br>
loop including steps 204, 205, 211, and 210 continues until all of the search window pixel sets<br>
within the current window have been correlated to the pixel set being encoded, or until a<br>
successful correlation has occurred.<br>
[0018] When no more search window pixel sets exist in the current search window<br>
the flow proceeds from step 211 to step 209. At step 209, a determination is made whether or<br>
not more search windows are to be identified. If not, the flow proceeds from step 209 to step 221<br>
where the method of FIG. 2 selects the best pixel set location and/or terminates without a<br>
successful correlation being found. However, if additional search windows are to be identified,<br>
the flow proceeds to step 208.<br>
[0019] At step 208, a next search window size and location is determined. Referring<br>
to Figure 1, a search window 112 is the next search window identified.<br>
[0020] Step 207, a correlation threshold is set for the next search window 112.<br>
Again, with reference to Figure 1, a new correlation threshold value would be set for the window<br>
size 112. Because the window size 112 contains more pixel sets than the search window 111a<br>
less stringent correlation factor will be tolerated. In other words, to avoid a long encode time, a<br>
tradeoff in the quality of correlation is allowed.<br>
[0021] At step 203, a new search window pixel set is identified. It will be<br>
appreciated that where the first search window 111 is a subset of the new search window 112, the<br>
correlation factors associated with the pixel sets of the first search window can be maintained,<br>
without re-correlating, and compared to the new threshold value. By saving the correlation<br>
factors for the first search window only the search window pixel sets that are unique to the<br>
second search window 112 would have to be correlated, thereby saving processing time.<br>
[0022] Again in the manner previously described, the steps 204, 205, 211, and 210<br>
will be repeated until either all of the search window pixel sets have been correlated against the<br>
pixel set being encoded, or a successful pixel set correlation has occurred.<br>
[0023] In the manner described, a plurality of search windows, i.e., search windows<br>
111, 112, and 113, can each be searched for pixels sets meeting different correlation threshold<br>
values. In this manner, tradeoffs between picture quality and the amount of processing time<br>
expected to be potentially spent can be dynamically maintained. It will be appreciated, that this<br>
is an advantage over the prior art, which would identify a single window and a single threshold<br>
value.<br>
[0024] Figure 3 illustrates a system in accordance with a specific embodiment of the<br>
present disclosure. Specifically, Figure 3 illustrates a system 300 having a data processor 310,<br>
and a memory 320. In operation, the data processor 310 accesses the memory 300 to execute<br>
program instructions 322 and to manipulate video data 324. For example, the video data 324<br>
would generally include the video frame data of frames F1 202 and F2 204 of Figure 1.<br><br><br>
Likewise, the video processor 310 would generally comprise an instruction execution unit for<br>
implementing the instructions. In addition, the data processor 310 can include co-processors<br>
312, which can include specific hardware accelerators and/or microcode engines, capable of<br>
implementing some or all of the encoding process described herein. In will be further<br>
appreciated, that the information processor 300 of Figure 3 can be part of a general purpose<br>
computer, special purpose computer, or integrated as a portion of a larger system.<br>

made to the accompanying drawings which for a part thereof, and in which is shown by way of<br>
