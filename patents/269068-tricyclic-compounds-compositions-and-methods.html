Rheumatoid arthritis is considered a chronic autoimmune and inflammatory disease producing inflamed joints, which eventually swell, become painful, and experience degradation of cartilage, bone, and ligaments of the joint. A result of rheumatoid arthritis is deformity, instability, and stiffness of the joint and scarring within the joint. The joints deteriorate at a highly variable rate. Many factors, including genetic predisposition, may influence the pattern of the disease. People with rheumatoid arthritis may have a mild course, occasional flare-ups with long periods of remission without disease, or a steadily progressive disease, which may be slow or rapid. Rheumatoid arthritis may start suddenly, with many joints becoming inflamed at the same time. More often, it starts subtly, gradually affecting different joints. Usually, the inflammation is symmetric, with joints on both sides of the body affected. Typically, the small joints in the fingers, toes, hands, feet, wrists, elbows, and ankles become inflamed first, followed by the knees and hips.<br>
Pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis is typically somatic nociceptive joint pain. Swollen wrists can pinch a nerve and result in numbness or tingling due to carpal tunnel syndrome. Cysts may develop behind affected knees, can rupture, causing pain and swelling in the lower legs.<br>

Suitable modified release formulations for the purposes of the invention are described in US Patent No. 6,106,864. Details of other suitable release technologies such as high energy dispersions and osmotic and coated particles are to be found in Pharmaceutical Technology On-line, 25(2), 1-14, by Verma et al (2001).<br>
Dose ranges for oral administration also include from 0.1 mg to 80 mg, 15 mg to 80 mg, 0.1 mg to 25 mg.<br>
Parenteral Administration<br>
The compounds or salts of the invention may also be administered directly into the blood stream, into muscle, or into an internal organ. Example 2 could be administered into the blood stream. Suitable means for parenteral administration include intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intraventricular,<br>
intraurethral, intrastemal, intracranial, intramuscular, intrasynovial and subcutaneous. Suitable devices for parenteral administration include needle (including microneedle) injectors, needle-free injectors and infusion techniques.<br>
-Parenteral formulations are typically aqueous solutions which may contain excipients such as salts, carbohydrates and buffering agents (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), but, for some applications, they may be more suitably formulated as a sterile nonaqueous solution or as a dried form to be used in conjunction with a suitable vehicle such as sterile, pyrogen-free water.<br>
The preparation of parenteral formulation under sterile conditions, for example by lyophilisation, may readily be accomplished using standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The solubility of compounds of the present invention and salts thereof used in the preparation of parenteral solutions may be increased by the use of appropriate formulation techniques, such as the incorporation of solubility-enhancing agents.<br>
Formulations for parenteral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release. Thus compounds of the invention may be formulated as a suspension or as a solid, semi-solid, or thixotropic liquid for administration as an implanted depot providing modified release of the active compound. Examples of such formulations include drug-coated stents and semi-solids and suspensions comprising drug-loaded poly(dl-lactic-coglycolic)acid (PGLA) microspheres.<br>
Topical Administration<br>
The compounds or salts of the invention may also be administered topically, (intra)dermally, or transdermal^ to the skin or mucosa. Example 1 could be administered to the skin. Typical formulations for this purpose include gels, hydrogels, lotions, solutions, creams, ointments, dusting powders, dressings, foams, films, skin patches, wafers, impiants, sponges, fibres, bandages and microemulsions. Liposomes may also be used. Typical carriers include alcohol, water, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, glycerin, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol. Penetration enhancers may be incorporated - see, for example, J Pharm Sci, 88 (10), 955-958, by Finnin and Morgan (October 1999).<br>
Other means of topical administration include delivery by electroporation, iontophoresis, phonophoresis, sonophoresis and microneedle or needle-free (e.g. Powderject™, B/oject™, etc.) injection.<br>
Formulations for topical administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
Inhaled/lntranasal A d ministration<br>
The compounds or salts of the invention can also be administered intranasally or by inhalation, typically in the form of a dry powder (either alone, as a mixture, for example, in a dry blend with lactose, or as a mixed component particle, for example, mixed with phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine) from a dry powder inhaler, as an aerosol spray from a pressurised container, pump, spray, atomiser (preferably an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist), or nebuliser, with or without the use of a suitable propellant, such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane, or as nasal drops. For intranasal use, the powder may comprise a bioadhesive agent, for example, chitosan or cyclodextrin.<br>
The pressurized container, pump, spray, atomizer, or nebuliser contains a solution or suspension of the compound(s) of the invention comprising, for example, ethanol, aqueous ethanol, or a suitable alternative agent for dispersing, solubilising, or extending release of the active, a propellant(s) as solvent and an optional surfactant, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, or an oligolactic acid.<br>
Prior to use in a dry powder or suspension formulation, the drug product is micronised to a size suitable for delivery by inhalation (typically less than 5 microns). This may be achieved by any appropriate comminuting method, such as spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling, supercritical fluid processing to form nanoparticles, high pressure homogenisation, or spray drying.<br>
Capsules (made, for example, from gelatin or hydroxypropylmethvlce!iulose)i blisters and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of the compound of the invention, a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch and a performance modifier such as L-leucine, mannitol, or magnesium stearate. The lactose may be anhydrous or in the form of the monohydrate, preferably the latter.<br>
Other suitable excipients include dextran, glucose, maltose, sorbitol, xylitol, fructose, sucrose and trehalose.<br>
A suitable solution formulation for use in an atomiser using eJectrohydrodynamics may comprise a compound of the present invention, propylene glycol, sterile water, ethanol and sodium chloride. Alternative solvents which may be used instead of propylene glycol include glycerol and polyethylene glycol.<br>
Formulations for inhaled/intranasal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release using, for example, PGLA. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled targeted and-programmed release.<br>
In the case of dry powder inhalers and aerosols, the dosage unit is determined by means of a valve which delivers a metered amount. Units in accordance with the invention are typically arranged to administer a metered dose or "puff' which may be administered in a single dose or, more usually, as divided doses throughout the day.<br>
Dose ranges for inhaled administration range from 2 mg to less or 1 mg to less.<br>
Combination<br>
The compounds or salts of the invention may be administered in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents, such as a drug. The compound of the present invention or salt thereof may be administered at the same time or different time as one or mere other therapeutic agents.<br>
For example, "in combination" includes: simultaneous administration of a combination of compound or salt of the invention and a therapeutic agent to a subject, when such components are formulated together into a single dosage form which releases said components at substantially the same time to said subject; substantially simultaneous administration of a combination of compound or salt of the invention and a therapeutic agent to a subject in need of treatment, when such components are formulated apart from each other into separate dosage forms which are taken at substantially the same time by said subject, whereupon said components are released at substantially the same time to said subject; sequential administration of a combination of compound or salt of the invention and a therapeutic agent to a subject, when such components are formulated apart from each other into separate dosage forms which are taken at consecutive times by said subject with a significant time interval between each<br>
administration, whereupon said components are released at substantially different times to said subject; and sequential administration of such combination of compound or salt of the invention and a therapeutic agent to a subject, when such components are formulated together into^a singie dosage form which releases said components in a controlled manner whereupon they are concurrently, consecutively, and/or overlappingly administered at the same and/or different times by said subject, where each part may be administered by either the same or different route.<br>

The (S)-4α-benzyl-7-bromo-2-ethoxy-3,4,4α,9-tetrahydrophenanthrene (1270 g; 3.2 moles; 85 area %, which may be prepared as described in Preparation 1) was dissolved in toluene (6.45 L). The ethylene glycol (898 mL; 16.1 moles) and p-toluenesulfonic acid (6.1 g; 0.03 moles) were added and the reaction heated to reflux. Solvent (1 L) was distilled from the mixture and replaced with fresh toluene (11). This dosjistiliation process was repeated twice more. More p-toluenesu!fonic acid (6.1 g) was added each time fresh toluene was added.   During the reaction, two intermediates (detected by LC) were formed as the substrate was converted into product. The end point of the reaction was an equilibrium point between the two intermediates and the product. Once the endpoint was reached, the mixture was cooled to ambient temperature. The mixture was washed with 0.5 M NaOH (2 L). The phases separated quickly and both were dark with a small rag layer. The mixture was washed, w'th water (2 L). The phases separated very slowly. The mixture was dried by azeotropic distillation. Methanol (4 L) was added to the mixture and solvent (4 L) was distilled from the mixture. The methanol addition and solvent distillation were repeated twice more. Methanol was added to the mixture and precipitation occurred a few minutes later. More methanol (4 L) was added to the mixture and then brought to reflux. After 30 minutes, the mixture was cooled to<br>
0°C. The mixture was filtered and the solid was washed with chilled methanol (2 X 2L). The solid was dried in a vacuum oven at 65°C. The title compound (882 g; 98 area %) was obtained as a beige solid. 1H NMR (DMSO) δ ppm: 1.71 (m, 2H), 2.06 (m, 2H), 2.31 (dd, 1H), 2.39 (m,-.1H), 2.68 (d, 1H), 2.77 (m, 1H), 2.86 (del, 1H), 3.36 (d, 1H), 3.86 (m, 4H), 5.45 (m, 1H), 6.50 (m, 2H), 7.00 (m, 4H), 7.37 (66, 1H), 7.44 (d, 1H).<br>

The 1.6 M n-butyl lithium in hexane (2270 ml_; 2.27 moles) was added at a rate such that the temperature was maintained below -60°C. The mixture held an additional 15 minutes after the addition. Carbon dioxide (108 g; 2.45 moles) was added while the temperature. was maintained below -60°C. The mixture held an additional 15 minutes after the addition. The mixture was warmed to ambient temperature. Solvent (7 L) was distilled from the mixture at atmospheric pressure. DMF (7 L) was added to the mixture. The mixture was cooled to ambient temperature. Methyl iodide (152 ml_; 2.45 moles) was added and the mixture was held until the reaction was completed (~1 hour). The mixture was heated to 70°C and solvent was distilled by gradually reducing the pressure to 70 mmHg. Once distillation had ceased, the mixture was cooled to room temperature. Water (6.5 L) was slowly added to the mixture to precipitate the product. The mixture was filtered and the solid washed with water (3 X). The solid was dried on the filter. The crude product (736 g; 74 area %) was obtained as a beige solid. The product was purified by chromatography. 463 g of product was recovered from the chromatography.

Conversion of Example 2 into Example 1<br>
The Caco-2 cell monolayer is an in vitro tissue culture model of the intestinal epithelium. These cells are of human colonic origin and become polarized, fully differentiated enterocytes in 2-3 weeks. Once differentiated, these cells have tight junctions and express various biochemical processes such as active efflux transporters including P-glycoprotein (P-gp). With this model, it is possible to determine the apparent permeability (Papp) of a compound across the polarized Caco-2 cell monolayer.<br>
An A→B Assay is performed with Caco-2 eel! monolayers to determine compound PapP from A chamber to B chamber. This Papp is representative of luminal (gut) to serosal (blood) compound transport across intestinal epithelium that may be seen during intestinal absorption.<br>
Example 2 did not significantly traverse a Caco-2 cell monolayer (A→B, Papp = 1.15e'6 cm/sec), whereas application of Example 2 to the apical compartment resulted in a significant elevation of Example 1 in both the apical and basolateral compartments.<br>
The data indicates a mechanism involving dephosphorylation of Example 2 to Example<br>
1 via membrane-bound alkaline phosphatases located in the intestinal epithelia,<br>
followed by absorption of Example 1 across the Caco-2 cell monolayer (A→B, Papp =<br>
57.5e"6 cm/sec).	<br>
Oral dosing of Example 2 (30 and 200 mg/kg) in portal vein-cannulated rats resulted in the detection of Example 1, but not Example 2, in portal vein plasma samples over a four-hour time period. These results indicated the occurrence of intestinal first-pass hydrolysis of Example 2 to Example 1 and selective intestinal absorption of Example 1.<br>
Example 2 demonstrates enhanced solubility and intrinsic dissolution, which results in an improved oral absorption profile in rats via increased exposure (1.61 ug*hr/mL [vs. 0.46 ug-hr/mL for Example 1]) and Cmax (0.59 ug/mL [vs. 0.13 ug/ml_ for Example 1]), as well as decreased time to Cmax (0.8 hr [vs. 1.5 hr for Example 1]) in dogs. The bioavailability of Example 2 was improved compared with Example 1 in rats (F = 59% for Example 2; F = 17% for Example 1).<br>

GRFP: Glucocorticoid receptor binding<br>
The glucocorticoid receptor fluorescence polarization ligand binding (GRFP) assay is used to evaluate direct binding of testing compounds to full-length glucocorticoid (GR) protein. Reagents for this assay are purchased from Invitrogen in a test kit. A fluorescent labeled GR ligand is used as a fluorescent tracer and test compounds compete with the fluorescent tracer for GR binding. The change in polarization value in the presence of test compounds is due to binding of test compounds to GR and is used to determine IC50 and relative binding affinity of test compounds for GR.<br>
IL-6 IC50 and % Inhibition<br>
Human A549 lung epithelial cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were cultured in Kaighn's F-12K medium with penicillin-streptomycin (10 U/mL) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (all from Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). A549 cells were plated at a density of 30,000 cells/well in 96-well plates and incubated overnight at 37°C and with 5% CO2. The cells were serum-starved by replacing the growth medium with serum-free Kaighn's F-12K medium with penicillin-streptomycin (10 U/mL) and, again, incubating overnight at 37°C and with 5% C02. On the third day, the medium was replaced with fresh serum-free medium and the cells were incubated with or without compound (vehicle was DMSO at 0.1% maximum concentration) for approximately 1 hour and then stimulated with 1 ng/mL recombinant human IL-13 (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 20 hours at 37°C and with 5% C02. Cell supernatants were collected for determination of IL-6 levels using MSD (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD) 96-well Single Spot plates as per the manufacturer's instructions. Plates were read with an MSD Sector Imager 6000. Prednisolone (1 µM) was used as a maximal inhibitor and defined the 100% inhibition control. Vehicle was used to define the 0% inhibition control. Percent inhibition for each compound concentration, relative to thess controls, was calculated using Excel (Microsoft. Redmond.

Cells were differentiated to a monocyte/macrophage phenotype with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 20 ng/mL, overnight. The cells were then centrifuged, the medium aspirated, the cells resuspended in an equal volume of fresh RPMI 1640 medium with glutamine and penicillin-streptomycin and fetal bovine serum as listed above, and incubated for 48 hours at 37°C and with 5% CO2. Following recovery, the cells were scraped, counted, and plated in accordance to the experimental design prior to stimulation with LPS, as described below.<br>
U937-cells-were differentiated and plated at a density of 200,000 cells/well in- 96 well plates. Cells were incubated with or without compound (vehicle was DMSO at 1% maximum concentration) for approximately one hour and then stimulated with 100 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS), E. coli serotype 0111 :B4 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for four hours at 37°C and with 5% CO2. Cell supematants were collected for determination of TNFα levels using an in-house sandwich-type ELISA, Mouse anti-human TNFα monoclonal antibody (clone 28401.111) and biotinylated goat anti-human TNFα (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were used as the capture and detection antibodies, respectively. Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and K-Blue Substrate/Red Stop (Neogen, Lexington, KY) were used as the detection system. Absorbance was measured at 650 nm. TNFα concentrations were interpolated from a human TNFα recombinant protein (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) standard curve using a four parameter logistics model by Magelled 4,11 data analysis software (Tecan, Durham, NC). Prednisolone (1 µM) was used as a maximal inhibitor and defined the 100% inhibition control. Vehicle was used to define the 0% inhibition control. Percent inhibition for each concentration of compound, relative to these controls, was calculated using Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA), IC50 values were generated using LabStats Fit Curve V4.R7.MO data analysis software (Pfizer Sandwich Laboratories, UK and Tessella Support Services pic, Abingdon UK).<br>
EX VIVO HUMAN WHOLE BLOOD<br>
This study compares the inhibition of IL-1ß, IFNγ,, IL-6, and TNFα production in ex vivo LPS-stimulated human whole blood by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) ligands Comparator A, Example 1, and prednisolone.<br>
Venous blood from human donors was collected as 10 ml aliquots in tubes containing sodium heparin (BD Vacutainer from Becton Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NY). Blood was added to sterile polystyrene round bottom 96-well tissue culture plates {Coming Costar) at 100 /µl/well, omitting the outside wells. Media (RPMI Medium 1640 with L-glutamine, Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) was added to the blood in 90 µl aliquots for a total volume of 190 µl. Outside wells were filled with 200 µl of media. Blood was placed in a humidified 37°C incubator with 5% CO2 while compounds were prepared (nearly 60 minutes).<br>
Compounds were prepared from 10 mM stock solutions in dirnethylsulfoxide-(DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich). Stock compound was diluted serially 1/3 in DMSO (i.e. 5 µl compound + 10 µl DMSO), followed by diluting each serial dilution 1/167 into vehicle solution (2% DMSO, 30% ethanol (AAPER Alcohol and Chemical Company), and 68% phosphate buffered saline (Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline without calcium chloride without magnesium chloride, Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad CA). Compound or vehicle was added to blood in 10 µl aliquots as triplicates. The final concentration of each prednisolone and Example 1 in the assay ranged from 1000 nM to 0.457 nM. Comparator A concentrations ranged from 3000 nM to 1.4 nM. Final DMSO and ethanol concentrations in the assay, were 0.1% and 1.5%. The samples were gently triturated twice to mix and replaced in the incubator. LPS stock (E. coli serotype 0111 :B4, Sigma-Aldrich), stored in aliquots of 100 µg/ml in RPMI at-20°C, was diluted 1/50 in RPMI to<br>
make a working stock solution After 60 minutes of incubatioin 10 µl of the prepared'<br>
LPS working stock was added to the blood to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml, omitting wells to be used as negative control. The samples were again gently triturated and the plates incubated overnight for 22 hours. Following incubation, the blood was centrifuged at 1500 x g for 5 minutes and the plasma removed to either freeze at -20°C or assay for cytokine release.<br>
IL-1ß, IFNγ,,IL-6, and TNFα protein levels were measured using Meso Scale assay kits (Meso Scale Discovery, Gathersburg, MD). Reagents were allowed to come to room temperature. Meso Scale plates were blocked with 30 µl of human plasma/serum assay diluent with gentle shaking for 60 minutes at room temperature. Plates were washed 3x with wash buffer (PBS, Invitrogen Corporation, with 0.05% Tween-20, Sigma-Aldrich). Calibrators for standard curves were prepared in human plasma sem assay diluent as a 1/5 serial dilution to achieve final concenteration <br>
ranging from 50000 µg/ml to 3.2 µg/ml. Samples and calibrators were added at 20 µ/well, then incubated at room temperature with gentle shaking for 90 minutes. Plates were again washed 3 times with wash buffer. Detection antibody was diluted in human plasma/serum antibody ,diluent to 1 µg/ml and added to the plate at 20 µl/well. Plates were incubated as before for 60 minutes and washed again. Read Buffer T (4x) was diluted 1:1 with mqH2O to 2 times concentration and 150 µl added to each well. Plates were analyzed on the SECTOR Imager 6000 (Meso Scale Discovery) to generate raw signal values.<br>
IL-1ß, IFNγ,, IL-6, and TNFα sample values were verified to be within the calibrator standard curves. Individual values were compared to positive and negative controls (vehicle treated blood with LPS and vehicle treated blood without LPS, respectively) to generate % inhibition. Triplicate values were averaged for each donor. The values for two donors were averaged (only one donor was used for IL-1 (3) and graphed using 4-parameter fit curves in the GraFit 5.0.11 application.<br>

In the traditional rnCIA model, male DBA/J mice were immunized with 50 µg chick type II collagen (cCII) in complete Freund's adjuvant and then boosted 21 days later with 50 µg cCII in incomplete Freund's adjuvant  Treatment with compounds was initiated on the morning of the boost and continued for 56 days. The effectiveness of treatment was measured by disease incidence (i.e., number of mice showing any sign of disease) and disease severity, both of which were measured twice a week.<br>
In the therapeutic rnCIA model, induction of disease incidence and severity was<br>
synchronized via LPS stimulation. Male DBA/J mice were immunized with 100 ug of<br>
bovine type II collagen (bCII) on day 0. All mice received an intraperitoneal injection of<br>
20 j.ig of LPS on day 28 and disease was allowed to develop through day 34. At day 34,<br>
all mice had disease (incidence = 100%) with an average severity score of seven.<br>
Dosing of compounds was initiated in the therapeutic mode on day 34 and continued<br>
through day 49. Different treatments were compared by measuring the decrease in<br>
incidence (i.e., resoMion of disease) and the decrease in severity of paw swelling over<br>
.- time.	<br>
Definition of rnCIA severity scores (maximal score of 12/mouse)<br>

Example 1 had scores less than 2 for rnCIA (ED80) and less than 1 for rnCIA (ED50).<br>
TNFα and Osteocalcin (OC) Suppression<br>
The compounds were weighed and suspended in a vehicle of 0.5% methylcellulcse/0.025% tween 20 (Sigmq-Aldrich, St. Lc&gt;.;;3: MO). Compound<br><br>
suspensions were homogenized using a Polytron PT-3100 tissue homogenizer to create a very fine suspension and were then sonicated for 10 minutes using a water bath sonicator. Aliquots of each suspension were made for daily dosing at 0.2 ml/dose. Swiss Webster female mice, 10-12 weeks old, 28-29 grams, (Taconic, Germantown, NY) were used in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and in accordance with NIH guidelines on laboratory animal welfare. Mice were acclimated in the Pfizer animal facility for three to seven days prior to being utilized in a study. Prednisolone and compounds were administered by oral gavage for<br>
     a toatal of  28 days.  Each treatment group contained 5-10 micer To establish a dosing<br>
regimen for the studies, a pilot pharmacodynamic time course experiment was conducted to quantify TNFα repression after a single ED8o dose. Compounds which suppressed TNFα were dosed QD, while compounds which did not suppress TNFα &gt;50% out to 24h were dosed BID.<br>
Body weights were measured on the first and last day of each experiment. Blood samples were obtained after three weeks of dosing for a steady-state pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis.    To assess compound effects on LPS-induced TNFα, all mice received an intraperitoneal injection of LPS (Salmonella typhosa, L-7895; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,) 2.5 hr after the last dose on day 28. Mice were sacrificed 90 minutes after LPS administration. Serum samples were quantified for osteocalcin and TNFα using the multiplex assays (Linco Research, Inc, St. Charles, MO; Luminex 100, Austin  TX . Samples.were diluted l.20.and.the assay was run according to manufacturer's instructions. The osteocalcin standard was purchased separately (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA). Mice were fasted for 4 hours before serum was collected for TNFα, and osteocalcin levels. For each experiment, outliers were detected by calculating the number of standard deviations from the mean of the group. If the value being examined was more than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean, it was excluded from the rest of the calculations.<br>
Percent inhibnition values  were then calculated for each mouse using the means of the vehicle and 10 mg/kg prednisolone control groups. The individual mouse percent inhibition values were fit to a four-parameter logistic model using the dose mean for each group. Since all four parameters were estimated and the lower plateau was not fixed at 0% and the upper plateau was not fixed at 100%, the ED50 and ED80 values<br>
were calculated by using an inverse calibration formula for a response equal to 50% or 80% inhibition or activation.<br>
ED50 and ED80 values are the doses (in mg/kg) required to result in a 50% or 80% effect, respectively, on a particular endpoint. ED50 and ED80 values were obtained for the various endpoints using a four-parameter logistic fit. For compounds which were tested multiple times, ED50 and ED80 values were obtained using four-parameter logistic fits of the combined data from multiple experiments. For compounds which did not achieve an 80% effect, the ED80 value is designated as &gt;10 mg/kg or &gt;20 mg/kg, depending on the highest dose tested. <br>
House dust mite mode! of asthma<br>
Mice were treated with three doses of Example 1 (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg, p.o., b.i.d.) or prednisolone (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg, p.o., b.i.d.). Separate groups of animals were treated with the respective vehicles, and no effect inflammatory cell influx into house dust mite-induced BAL inflammatory cell influx was demonstrated.<br>
Example 1 mitigated cell infiltration into BAL fluid dose-dependently. Evaluation of BAL fluid cell types using flow cytometry showed significant reductions in eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes and T-cells. In comparison, prednisolone conferred similar reductions in BAL fluid cell infiltration at similar doses (data not shown).<br>

DISSOCIATION INDEX <br>
A dissociation index (Dl) was chosen as a measurement to quantify the dissociation of compounds relative to that of prednisolone in terms of biomarkers of antiinflammatory efficacy and side-effects. Dissociation indices were calculated using clinically relevant biomarkers that could be utilized in early clinical development. Serum<br>
osteocalcin and LPS-induced serum TNFα are accepted clinically as predictive for bone formation and anti-inflammatory efficacy, respectively.<br>
The dissociation index was based on the following tenets:<br>
1)	Dissociation required a dose-margin between biomarkers of inflammation and side-<br>
effects and was defined by the formula:<br>
Dl       = Side-effect endpoint<br>
Anti-inflammatory endpoint<br>
For example:	Dl       = osteocalcin supprepression (OC) ED50 (or EAUC50}<br>
TNFα supprepression(TNFα)ED50 (or EAUC50):<br>
2)	The Dl of a compound can be considered relative to that observed with prednisolone,<br>
its clinical comparator. The corrected or normalized Di was defined as compound Dl<br>
divided by prednisolone Dl.<br>
DISSOCIATION INDEX (ED50and ED80]<br>
(Table removed) <br>
Example 1, Comparator I, Comparator J had a Dl greater than 5 for OC/TNFα (ED50). Example 1 and Comparator J had a Dl greater than 4 for OC/TNFα (ED80).<br>
 CORRECTED DISSOCIATION INDEX (ED50and ED80) BASED ON PREDNISOLONE<br>
(Table removed) <br>
Example 1, Comparator I, Comparator J had a corrected D1 greater than 5 for OC/TNFα (ED5o). Example 1 had a corrected D1 greater than 1.50 for OC/TNFα (ED80).<br>
EAUC50 AND EAUC80<br>
Drug exposure, defined as drug plasma concentrations integrated over time (AUC), was used to make pharmacodynamic comparisons between prednisolone and Example 1. Due to the short half-lives of prednisolone and Example 1 in the mouse, AUC(0-4 hr) values accounted for more than 95% of the AUC(0-24 hr) values. Due to blood volume sampling limitations in mice, AUC(0-4 hr) values were used to make pharmacodynamic comparisons.<br>

Cortical Bone Histomorphometry to determine BFR<br>
During the in-life portion of each study, mice received two intraperitoneal (i.p.)<br>
injections (20 mg/kg, 100 ml/mouse) of calcein (C-0875; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)<br>
on days 1 and 26 for bene histomorphometry measurements. Calcein incorporates into<br>
the bone mineral and allows measurement of bone formation rate. Calcein was<br>
dissolved in 2% sodium bicarbonate.    During the tissue harvest, the left tibiae were<br>
excised and cleaned for cortical histomorphometry measurements. After all skin and<br>
muscle were removed, tibiae were placed in 70% ethanol (4°C) in the dark for a<br>
minimum of"24 hours.	<br>
Ground transverse sections were used for histomorphometric analysis of cortical bone. Bones were sectioned using a low-speed saw (Isomet, Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL) equipped with a diamond wafer blade. The end of each tibia was removed proximal to tibia-fibula synostosis and a 75 mm cross-section was cut. Using a roughened glass plate and a cork, sections were ground to -25 mm until transparent and all labels were distinguishable under a fluorescent microscope. Sections were dehydrated using the following solutions for a minimum of two minutes each: 1) 70% ethanol, 2) 95% ethanol, 3) 100% ethanol, 4) 50/50 ethanol/xylene, and 5) xylene (twice) (#534056; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Sections were mounted using Eukitt Quick Mounting Medium (#03989, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) after which coverslip was applied. Using the Osteomeasure Bone Analysis Program (Osteometries, Inc., Decatur, Georgia), bone formation rate was calculated by tracing the 1st and 3rd fluorescent labels and the inner and outer perimeter of the bone.   Bone formation rate was calculated by the following equation: (Inter-label width/Label interval) * (Labeled perimeter/Bone perimeter). At least five samples were measured from each treatment group in each study.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
