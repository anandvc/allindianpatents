				<td>Field of the present invention<br>
The present invention relates to oligonucleotide primers comprising SEQ ID NOs. 1 to 21, specific for Salmonella enterotoxin gene (stn) gene, useful for rapid and specific screening of Salmonella. The present invention also relates to a process for the rapid and specific detection of Salmonella enterotoxin gene (stn) gene in a subject for the presence of parasite Salmonella using oligonucleotide primers comprising SEQ ID NOs. 1 to 21 for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), said process comprising steps of preparing DNA template of the gene, amplifying the template using the primers by PCR, running the PCR products on gel, and detecting the parasite.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Salmonella species are facultative, intracellular parasites that invade the mucous membrane of the epithelial cells and are transmitted to humans mainly through water, meat, eggs and poultry products. Salmonella infection is the most frequent food-borne gastrointestinal disease transmitted from animals to humans. Typhoid fever still remains endemic in many developing countries and non-typhoidal salmonellosis also is a major food-borne disease worldwide and is estimated to be responsible for the deaths of more than 500 people each year, with costs of $1 billion to $1.5 billion annually in the United States alone (Threlfall 1996; Mead et al. "Food-related illness and death in the United States," Emerg Infect Dis., 1999, 5:607 25.) These figures in India are not fully documented but expected to be much higher. To prevent Salmonella infection, good monitoring and screening programs are required. Detection of Salmonella by conventional bacteriological methods are time consuming and usually requires 5 to days. Therefore, efforts have been made by many workers to reduce time required and to increase the sensitivity of the methods to detect Salmonella (Notermans et al. 1997; Ferretti et al., "Twelve-hour PCR-based method for detection of Salmonella spp. in food," Appl Environ Microbiol., 2001, 67:977 8; Carli et al., "Detection of salmonellae in chicken feces by a combination of tetrathionate broth enrichment, capillary PCR, and capillary gel electrophoresis," J Clin Microbiol., 2001, 39:1871 6).<br>
Increased public awareness of the health related and economic impact of food-borne contamination and illness has resulted in greater efforts to develop more sensitive methods of pathogenic detection and identification. Advances in molecular biology technology, particularly the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), have allowed more reliable microbial identification and surveillance. PCR has also become a valuable tool for investigating food-borne outbreaks and identification of etiological agents responsible for the microbial epidemics. PCR techniques have provided<br><br>
increased sensitivity, allowed more rapid processing times and enhanced the detection of bacterial pathogens. In addition to analysis of foods, PCR has also been /Successfully applied for the detection and identification of pathogenic micro organisms in clinical and environmental samples (Simon 1999; White, 1992). Enterotoxigenicity has been recognized as one of the distinct pathological attributes of diarrhoea inducing bacteria. Salmonella serotypes, which are known for their association with gastroenteritis and diarrhoea in humans and animals, have also been shown to produce enterotoxin. The stn gene is located at approximately 89 minutes on the Salmonella lyphimurium chromosome and the presence of an intact stn gene contributes significantly to the overall virulence of Salmonella. We present here the use of stn gene as a detection marker for Salmonella. Objects of the present invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to develop primers for the detection of parasite salmonella enterotoxin gene (stn)<br>
Another main object of the present invention is to develop a rapid and efficient process for the detection of Parasite Salmonella enterotoxin gene (stn) Yet another main object of the present invention is to develop a process for the detection of Parasite Salmonella from food, biological samples, etc. Summary of the invention<br>

Methodology<br>
Protocol consists of three main steps:.<br>
• Preparation of template DNA<br>
• Polymerase Chain reaction<br>
• Visualization of the product on agarose gel<br>
DNA isolation for PCR: The cell pellet from 1 ml of the liquid culture or a single<br>
colony on the agar medium was suspended in 100 ul of sterilized Millipore water and<br>
incubated in a dry bath at 100°C for 5 min. The mixture was immediately transferred<br>
to ice bath and left for 3 min. The resultant cell lysate was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for<br>
3 min. and 2 ul of the supernatant was directly used in a 20ul PCR reaction.<br>
Wherever felt necessary, the assay was performed by using isolated chromosomal<br>
DNA. For isolation of pure chromosomal DNA, the cultures were grown for 6 hr. in<br>
nutrient broth and DNA isolated by GES method (Pitcher et a/., 1989). lOng of DNA<br>
was normally used in a 20ul reaction assay<br>
Template preparation from blood: DNA isolation kit (M/S Bio Basic, Canada) was<br>
used for the isolation of DNA from blood, (fig 2)<br>
Template preparation from water: For isolation of DNA from water-borne bacteria,<br>
1 ml of the sample was centrifuged at 7000 r.p.m for 3 min. in a 5 ml eppendorf tube,<br>
supernatant discarded and 10u.l of autoclaved Millipore water added to each tube. The<br>
resultant suspension was vortexed, incubated in a dry bath at 100°C for 5 min. and the<br>
whole volume used in a 20ul PCR reaction.<br>
Enrichment: In case of blood 250ul aliquots of the samples were inoculated into 5ml<br>
liquid medium and for water 1 ml aliquots inoculated into 1 ml of double strength<br>
Brain Heart Infusion Broth (HiMedia, India) and incubated at 37°C for 5h. The cell<br>
