Method for synthesising heterocyclic compounds<br><br>
Scheme 1<br>
In the process, the isothiocyanate of the formula II is initially reacted with the primary amine of the formula III to give the thiourea of the formula IV. Subsequently, the thiourea of the formula IV is converted to the heterocycle of the formula I using a base and a sulfonyl chloride.<br>
The construction of basic heterocyclic structures is one of the most important synthetic steps in organic chemistry. The resulting heterocyclic compounds are of great significance, inter alia, as intermediates in the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients and active crop protection ingredients or else directly as such active ingredients. In addition, the rapid synthesis, which is particularly important in the preparation of screening substances, of analogs which are sometimes quite diverse in structural terms places high demands on synthesis planning. Central building blocks which allow direct access to a multitude of diverse heterocycles under similar or ideally identical reaction conditions are therefore particularly valuable and of great significance, in particular for robot-assisted syntheses.<br>
The synthesis of heterocycles starting from thioureas has been known for some time. However, the methods have limitations in the substrate selection or disadvantages in reaction control, workup, by-product removal or in the cost of reagents. For instance, 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-arylthioureas can be cyclized by heavy metal derivatives such as mercury(ll) oxide or<br><br>
lead oxide to give oxazolidin-2-ylidenarylamines (Jen, et al., J. Med. Chem. 1975 (18), 90). Acid catalysis of the same reactants affords the corresponding arylthiazolidin-2-ylidenamines (Jen, et al., J. Med. Chem. 1975 (18), 90). However, the use of heavy metals is disadvantageous, since they are unwanted in the product, even only in traces. The acid-catalyzed conversion to the thiazolidine again proceeds satisfactorily only at elevated temperature and in the presence of high acid concentrations. These drastic conditions are not tolerated by some functionalities such as esters, nitriles or ketals.<br>
Syntheses starting from 1-(2-aminoethyl)-3-arylthioureas to imidazolidin-2-ylidenaryl derivatives succeed in the presence of methyl iodide (Synthesis 1974, 41-42) or carbodiimide derivatives (Synthesis 1977, 864). A disadvantage in the case of methyl iodide is the competing reaction which occurs on other nucleophilic centers in the molecule and its danger potential in the event of unintentional release. In the case of carbodiimide derivatives, the removal of the ureas formed is frequently problematic and time-consuming. More recent carbodiimide derivatives such as EDC (N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride) or solid phase-bound DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide), used in a relatively large amount, are again very expensive.<br>
The synthesis method of the present invention leads, starting from isothiocyanates and amino alcohols, amino mercaptans and diamines, via the thioureas formed as intermediates, to the desired heterocycles of variable ring size, by cyclizing the intermediate derivatives in the presence of sulfonyl chloride and of a base. These reagents are inexpensive, easy to handle and require no drastic reaction conditions, and their subsequent products are easy to remove by simple washings, so that this synthetic process is suitable, for example, for reactions on the gram and kilogram scale. However, it can also be employed for parallel and robot syntheses which are usually carried out on the milligram scale, especially owing to the simple reaction control. Of particular interest for these synthetic methods which are generally employed on a relatively small scale is the use of polymer-bound sulfonyl chloride, which enables the isolation of the reaction products by filtration and evaporation steps which are simple from an apparatus point of view.<br>
In the literature, a similar process method is to be found quite specifically<br><br>
for the reaction of phenyl or methyl isothiocyanates with 2-hydroxyethyl-amines to give oxazolidin- or thiazolidin-2-ylidenamines (Tetrahedron Letters 40 (1999), 8201; Tetrahedron 57 (2001), 7137; Bull. Korean Chem. Soc. 2002 (23), 19).<br>
It has now been possible to show, surprisingly, that under these conditions, not only can five-membered rings such as oxazolidines or thiazolidines be formed, but also that ring size and degree of substitution are much more flexible and the synthesis method is not restricted to the use of 2-hydroxy-ethylamines. The restriction to thiourea intermediates which bear at least one aryl substituent on one of the thiourea nitrogens, results in the ring closure proceeding very selectively and affording, with the loss of the thiourea sulfur, generally only one cyclization product.<br>
The present invention thus relates to a process for preparing heterocycles of the formula I<br><br><br>

Scheme 2<br>
a)	reacting an aromatic isothiocyanate of the formula Ha with a primary<br>
amine of the formula Ilia to give thiourea of the formula IVa, and<br>

where, in the compounds of the formulae lla, Ilia and IVa, Ar, X, n and R1 to R4 are each as defined in formula la and R6      is   phenyl   which   is   unsubstituted   or   substituted   by   methyl, trifluoromethyl, F, CI or Br.<br>
The compounds of the formula la are encompassed by the compounds of the formula 1; similarly the compounds of the formulae lla, Ilia, and IVa are encompassed by the compounds of the formulae II, III, and IV.<br>
Process step a) may be effected continuously or batchwise. The reaction of the isothiocyanate of the formula II with the primary amine of the formula III<br><br>
may be carried out in the presence of a solvent or diluent, or without the addition of a solvent. Preference is given to carrying it out in the presence of a solvent. It is possible to use various solvents, for example aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example methylene chloride, esters, for example ethyl acetate, alcohols or ethers. Preference is given to using ethers as the solvent, for example tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or ethylene glycol ethers such as ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, especially when the overall reaction is carried out as a one-pot reaction. It is also possible to use mixtures of two or more solvents. The temperature for the reaction in process step a) is preferably from 0°C to the boiling point of the solvent used, more preferably from 20°C to 60°C, for example about room temperature. The isothiocyanate of the formula II and the primary amine of the formula III are used, for example, in a molar ratio of from 1 : 1.1 to 1 : 0.9, preferably in about equimolar amounts. However, it is also possible to use an excess of the amine of the formula III, for example when X is NR5, in order to prevent side reactions.<br>
Process step b) may be effected continuously or batchwise. In general, the conversion of the thiourea of the formula IV to the compound of the formula I may be carried out in the presence of a solvent or diluent. It is possible to use various solvents, for example esters or ethers, preferably ethers, for example tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or ethylene glycol ethers such as ethylene glycol dimethyl ether. The solvent used may also, for example, be water. It is also possible to use mixtures of two or more solvents, for example mixtures of water and one or more organic solvents, for example mixtures of water and one of the ethers mentioned. The reaction may proceed as a monophasic reaction or as a biphasic reaction. The temperature for the reaction in process step b) is preferably from 0°C to 35°C, more preferably about room temperature. The thiourea of the formula IV and the sulfonyl chloride R6SO2CI are used, for example, in a molar ratio of from 1 : 1.4 to 1 : 0.9, preferably in a ratio of from 1 : 1 to 1 : 1.2, for example in the ratio of about 1 : 1.1. When polyer-bound sulfonyl chloride is used, the ratio may be from 1:1 to 1:4, preferably from 1:1.5 to 2.5. The molar ratio of the thiourea of the formula IV to the base in process step b) is, for example, from 1 : 4 to 1 : 1, preferably in a ratio of from 1 : 3 to 1 : 2, for example in the ratio of about 1 : 2.5. The base used in process step b) may be various inorganic or organic compounds, for example basic alkali metal compounds or alkaline earth metal compounds, in particular the metal hydroxides, or amines or ammonium hydroxides. Preference is given<br><br>
to using basic sodium compounds or potassium compounds as the base, for example sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate. It is advantageous to use an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, for example having a hydroxide concentration of the solution of from 0.1 to 10 molar, preferably about 1 molar.<br>
The reaction mixture may be worked up after each of the two process steps a) and b). However, the compounds of the formula I by the process according to the invention may also be synthesized in a one-pot reaction without isolating the thiourea of the formula IV formed in step a), and a workup carried out only after the completion of both process steps. The products are worked up and, if desired, purified by the customary methods such as extraction, filtration, pH separation, chromatography or crystallization and the customary dryings.<br>
The starting compounds of the formulae II and III are commercially available or can be prepared according to, or in a similar manner to, processes which are described in the literature and familiar to those skilled in the art. The starting compounds may also contain functional groups in protected form or in the form of precursors, and these may then be converted to the desired groups in the compounds of the formula I prepared by the process according to the invention. Appropriate protecting group techniques are known to those skilled in the art. For example, in compounds of the formula III in which X is NR5, the NHR5 group may be protected by an acetyl, trifluoroacetyl or trityl group and be deprotected before carrying out process step b).<br>

position or 2-position. Naphthyl radicals may likewise be unsubstituted or mono- or polysubstituted, for example mono-, di-, tri-, tetra- or pentasubstituted, by identical or different radicals. Where a naphthyl radical is substituted, it preferably bears one or two identical or different substituents.<br>
Heteroaryl radicals are aromatic ring compounds in which 1, 2, 3 or 4 ring atoms are oxygen atoms, sulfur atoms or nitrogen atoms, for example 1, 2 or 3 nitrogen atoms, 1 or 2 oxygen atoms, 1 or 2 sulfur atoms or a combination of different hetero atoms. The heteroaryl radicals may be mono- or bicyclic. The heteroaryl radicals may be bonded via all positions, for example via the 1-position, 2-position, 3-position, 4-position, 5-position, 6-position, 7-position or 8-position. Heteroaryl radicals may be unsubstituted or mono- or polysubstituted, for example mono-, di- or trisubstituted, by identical or different radicals.<br><br>
Preferred heteroaryl radicals are monocyclic aromatic ring compounds; particular preference is given to five-membered heteroaryl radicals, for example thiophene and isoxazole.<br>
When groups, substituents or variables can be present more than once in the compounds of the formula I, la, II, Ila, III, Ilia, IV or IVa, they may all each independently be as defined above and may each be identical or<br>
different.<br>
The present invention further provides a process for preparing a compound of the formula I<br><br><br><br><br>
where<br>
Ar, X, n, R1 to R4 and R6 are each as defined above.<br>
All  definitions  and  illustrations  of the  above-described  process  apply<br>
correspondingly for this process.<br>
The compounds of the formula I obtainable by the process according to the invention are valuable intermediates, for example for the preparation of active pharmaceutical ingredients such as clonidine and its analogs, or are themselves active pharmaceutical ingredients. For example, the applications WO 03101984 and WO 03053434 describe compounds which may be prepared by means of the process described here, and which are suitable as NHE inhibitors, in particular NHE3 inhibitors, for example for treating respiratory disorders and snoring, and also for improving the respiratory drive, or for treating acute or chronic disorders which are induced by ischemic and/or reperfusion events or by proliferative or by fibrotic events.<br>
