[002]        The present invention  is  related  to U.S.  nonprovisional  patent  applications "Compositions and Methods for the Inhibition of Phospholipase A2" filed December 22, 2006 (Express Mail No.: EV 902583388 US) and "Compositions and Methods for Synthesizing Heterocyclic Therapeutic Compounds" filed December 22, 2006 (Express Mail No.: EV 902583374 US),.both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[003] The present invention relates to compositions and methods for the treatment and prevention of disease in a mammal. In particular, the invention relates to medicaments comprising various novel substituted dipeptide derived nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salt derivatives. The compounds of the invention may optionally be administered with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, another biologically active agent or a combination thereof.<br>
Background<br>
[004] Approximately 40% of the world's population lives in areas where a significant risk of contracting malaria exists. Each year, 300-500 million people suffer from acute malaria, and 0.5-2.5 million die from the disease. Although malaria has been widely eradicated in many parts<br>
of the world, the global number of cases continues to rise. The most important reason for this alarming situation is the rapid spread of malaria parasites that are resistant to antimalarial drugs, especially chloroquine, which is by far the most frequently used.<br>
(005] The research and development of new antimalarial drugs has been largely neglected since thel970s owing to the end of colonialism, changes in the areas of military engagement, and the restricted market potential. Currently, few drugs against the malaria liver stage parasites are available. Because of technical difficulties, low yield and the complexity of the setting necessary to produce liver stage parasites, no new drags are assessed systematically against these stages. Nevertheless, liver stages are a strong potential for drug targeting because; a) they possess a more complex and distinct metabolism than their blood stage counterpart, and b) they precede the pathogenic blood stage and thus offer prophylactic possibilities against malaria. Thus, the evaluation of new drugs against the liver stage offers new therapeutic horizons.<br>
[0061 An additional observation is mat some antimalarial compounds, for example, chloroquine also exhibit anti-HTV-l activity. (See, for example, Savarino A, Gennero L, Chen HC, Serrano D, Malavasi F, Boelaert JR, Sperber K. Anti-HIV effects of chloroquine: mechanisms of inhibition and spectrum of activity. AIDS 2001 Nov 23;15(17):2221-9; Savarino A, Gennero L, Sperber K, Boelaert JR. The anti-KV-l activity of chloroquine. J Clin Virol 2001 Feb;20(3):131-5.<br>
[007] Thus, the need in society exists for new therapeutics, which demonstrate advantageous clinical efficacy for the treatment and/or prevention of malaria, as well as for drugs that may be useful for the treatment and/or prevention of HIV infection and/or AIDS.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[008] The present invention relates to compounds and methods for synthesizing compounds, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which are efficacious for the treatment and/or prevention of disease in an individual In one aspect, the invention relates to dipeptide derived heterocyclic compounds synthesized using the methods of the invention.<br>
1009]        In   additional   aspects,   the  invention  relates   to  pharmaceutical   compositions<br>
comprising effective amounts of said compounds, and to therapeutic methods comprising their administration to an individual in need thereof for the treatment and/or prevention of a disease.<br>

[0079] The term "rate controlling polymer" as used herein includes hydrophilic polymers, hydrophobic polymers or mixtures of hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic polymers that are capable of retarding the release of the compounds in vivo. In addition, many of the same polymers can be utilized to create an enteric coating of a drug, drug suspension, or drug matrix.

(0083] The controlled release preparation according to the invention preferably can be manufactured by blending the compounds with the controlled release polymer(s) and auxiliary excipients followed by direct compression. Other methods for manufacturing the preparation include melt granulation. Preferred melt granulation techniques include melt granulation together with the rate controlling polvmer(s) and diluents) followed by compression of the granules and melt granulation with subsequent blending with the rate controlling polymer(s) and diluents followed by compression of the blend. As desired prior to compression, the blend and/or granulate can be screened and/or mixed with auxiliary agents until an easily flowable homogeneous mixture is obtained.<br>
[0084] Oral dosage forms of the controlled release preparation according to the invention can be in the form of tablets, coated tablets, enterically coated tablets or can be multiparticulate, such as in the form of pellets or mini-tablets.

For instance, the compounds can be compressed into a dosage form containing a rate controlling polymer, such as HPMC, or mixture of polymers which when wet will swell to form a hydrogel. The rate of release from this dosage form is controlled both by diffusion from the swollen tablet mass and by erosion of the tablet surface over time. The rate of release may be controlled both by the amount of polymer per tablet and by the inherent viscosities of the polymers used.<br>

[00101]    Examples<br>
[00102]     To expand further the skeletal diversity attainable with peptide substrates, a variety of<br>
compounds were synthesized and densely functionalized from, for example, a dipeptide-derived l,3,5-triazepan-2,6-diane scaffold. These compounds were found to be active by screening a small "prospecting" library against the malaria liver stage (LS).<br>
[00103] Interest in designing and evaluating the dipeptide-derived l,3,5-triazepan-2,6-dione scaffold stems from the remarkable biological activities exhibited by molecules with diazepine and triazepine skeletons. In particular seven-membered cyclic ureas have attracted much attention in recent years with application in the development of HTV-protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitors, Factor Xa inhibitors, beta-lactamases inhibitors, phospholipase C inhibitors, and chemokine receptor antagonists.<br>
[00104] With reference to Figure 2,1,3,5-triazcpan-2,6-diones 4 are constructed in only four steps by cyclization of simple activated dipeptide derivatives, and the approach benefits from the considerable diversity of commercial alpha-amino acids. The cyclization strategy parallels the previously reported approach to the preparation of enantiopure macrocyclic oligoureas. Succinimidyl carbamates 2 were prepared from Boc-dipeptides 1 as previously described for TV-protected alpha- and beta-amino acids. Selective removal of the Boc group by treatment of crude 2 with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) afforded 3 which cyclized to 4 in the presence of diisopropylethylamine (DIEA). The cyclization proceeded rapidly with concomitant release of N-hydroxysuccinimide and formation of the TFA salt of DEEA. These byproducts were removed by either rccrystallization of crude 4, liquid-liquid extraction or polymer supported sequestration (PSS) with tris-(2-aminoethyl)amine polystyrene (PS-triamine). Alternatively polymer-supported-DIEA (PS-DIEA) was found to be very effective in promoting cyclization and simultaneously removing byproducts.<br>
[00105] A set of 18 monocyclic to tetracyclic l,3,5-triazepin-2,6-diones 4 was synthesized by this approach in moderate to high overall yield starting from a variety of dipeptide sequences (Table 1).<br>

100107] Carbamates 2a-n and 2p bearing a tertiary amide AT-terminal to gXbb residue (R3 # H) were expected to give an equilibrium mixture between trans and cis isomers (a 1:1 ratio was observed for 2a by lH-NMR in CD3CN) and as a result readily cyclized to 4 (entries 1-15). In contrast, cyclization of precursors 2 with a secondary amide W-terminal to gXbb (R3» H, entries 16 and 17) gave 4 together with various proportion of the corresponding 14-membercd ring cyclodimer.<br>
[001081 X-ray diffraction and 'H NMR studies of representative members of the library, revealed that the l,3,5-triazepan-2,6-dione ring system in compounds 4 generally adopts a rigid non planar conformation (the values for the mean angle between the amide and urea planes is close to 120° with side chains R2 and R4 in pseudo-equatorial position (Figure 3).<br>
[00109] Further functionalization and diversification of parent scaffolds 4 was achieved by alkylation of urea nitrogens (Figure 4). Treatment of scaffold 4 with NaH (5 equiv) and various electrophiles (3 equiv) afforded dialkylated cyclo-ureas (e.g. 6 and 7) in good yield and purities following liquid/liquid extraction and PSS of excess electrophile with Af-(2-mercaptoethyl)aminomethyl-PS. Interestingly, in the presence of KF/AI2O3 or NaH (2 equiv.) cyclo{Xaa-gSar-CO) 4a, 4c and cyclo(Phe-gPro-CO) 4i were converted to 8 and 9 monoalkylated at the gem-diamino urea nitrogen with good to excellent selectivities (8:6 and 9:7 in the range 80:20 to 100:0). Crystal structures of dialkylated and monoalkylated derivatives 7 and 9(1), respectively, show a rearrangement of the ring geometry with R1 side-chain now pointing in quasi axial orientation (Figure 5).<br>
[00110) Invasion of host hepatocytes by sporozoites represent an early step in the life cycle of the malaria parasite. Malaria liver stages hold great promise for drug targeting because 0 they possess a more complex and distinct metabolism than their blood stage counterpart and ft) they precede the pathogenic blood stage, thus offering prophylaxis possibilities against malaria. However, very few drugs against LS parasites are available and most of them like primaquine display severe side-effects or loose efficiency due to the development of parasite resistance.<br>
[00111] Seventeen different 1, 3, 5-triazepan-2,6-diones were randomly selected and were first tested at different doses for toxicity on primary mouse hepatocyte culture. From these, nine<br>
were shown to be toxic at all doses tested (6, 25-100 ug/ml) and two at high doses(over 50 µg/ml). The non toxic remaining six molecules were thus tested to evaluate their effets on sporozoite invasion and development in hepatocytes. Four of these 4J, 7a, 5q and 11 had no significant effect on liver parasites (Fig. 5 A, 5C and data not shown). In contrast, two molecules, 4b and 8a, were shown to inhibit significantly and repeatedly LS development (Fig. 5A and 5B), 4b being the most potent<br>
[00112] We have presented the design and the construction of a 32 members small library of dipeptide derived 1, 3, 5-triazcpin-2,6-diones which led to the identification of two molecules active against the malaria liver stages exempt of toxicity on mouse hepatocytes. Studies aimed at increasing the structural diversity of the library by integrating a more comprehesive set of peptide precursors (including side-chain and stereochemical diversity) and appending processes are undergoing and should help for the rapid identification of more potent molecules to the underexplored stage of malaria.<br>
