				<td>Selective insecticides based on haloalkvlnicotinic acid derivatives, anthranilic acid diamides, or phthalic acid diamides and safeners<br>
The invention relates to selective insecticidally and/or acaricidally effective compound combinations comprising, firstly, haloalkylnicotinic acid derivatives, phthalic acid diamides or anthranilic acid diamides and, secondly, at least one crop plant compatibility-improving compound, and to their use for the selective control of insects and/or spider mites in various crops of useful plants.<br>
It is known that certain haloalkylnicotinic acid derivatives have insecticidal properties (EP-A<br>
0 580 374, JP-A 7-010841, JP-A 7-025853, JP-A 10-101648, JP-A 10-195072, JP-A 11-180957, JP-A<br>

99/59993, WO 00/35912, WO 00/35913, WO 01/09104, WO 01/14373, WO 01/47918, WO<br>
01/70692, WO 02/12229, WO 03/028458, WO 03/028459, WO 03/043990, WO 03/044013, WO<br>
03/097604, WO 03/097605).<br>
Furthermore, it is known that certain anthranilic acid diamides have insecticidal properties (WO<br>
01/70671, WO 02/094791, WO 03/015519, WO 03/016284, WO 03/015518, WO 03/024222, WO<br>
03/016282, WO 03/016283, WO 03/062226, WO 03/027099).<br>
Also   known  as  compounds  having   insecticidal   properties  are  phthalic  acid   diamides  (cf.<br>
EP-A-0919542, EP-A-1 006 107, WO 01/00 575, WO 01/00599, WO 01/46 124, JP-A 2001-33<br>
5559, WO 01/02354, WO 01/21 576, WO 02/08 8074, WO 02/08 8075, WO 02/09 4765, WO<br>
02/09 4766, WO 02/06 2807).<br>
The general formulae and definitions described in these publications and the individual compounds<br>
described therein are expressly incorporated herein by way of reference.<br>
It is also known that mixtures of phthalic acid diamides and further bioactive compounds have an<br>
insecticidal and/or acaricidal action (WO 02/087 334). However, the activity of these mixtures is not<br>
always optimal.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that certain haloalkylnicotinic acid derivatives, phthalic acid diamides or anthranilic acid amides, when used together with the crop plant compatibility-improving compounds (safeners/antidotes) described below, are very efficient in preventing damage to the crop plants and can be used particularly advantageously as broadly active combination preparations for the selective control of insects.<br>
The invention provides selective insecticidal and/or acaricidal compositions comprising an effective amount of an active compound combination comprising, as components,<br>
(a)        (1)       at least one haloalkylnicotinic acid derivative of the formula (I)<br>

Specifically, particular mention may be made of the following compounds of the formula (IV-a):<br>
(Table Remove) <br><br>
The crop plant compatibility-improving compounds [component b)] which are most preferred are cloquintocet-mexyl, fenchlorazole-ethyl, isoxadifen-ethyl, mefenpyr-diethyl, furilazole, fenclorim, cumyluron, dymron, dimepiperate and the compounds IV-e-5 and FV-e-ll, cloquintocet-mexyl and mefenpyr-diethyl being especially preferred. Special preference is furthermore given to isoxadifen-ethyl and IV-e-5.<br>
Examples of selective insecticidal and/or acaricidal combinations according to the invention of in each case one active compound of the formula (I) and in each case one of the safeners defined above are listed in the table below.<br>
Table 11	Examples of combinations according to the invention(Table Remove) <br><br>
The compounds of the general formula (IV-a) to be used as safeners are known and/or can be<br>
prepared by processes known per se (cf. WO 91/07874, WO 95/07897).<br>
The compounds of the general formula (FV-b) to be used as safeners are known and/or can be<br>
prepared by processes known per se (cf. EP-A 0 191 736).<br>
The compounds of the general formula (FV-c) to be used as safeners are known and/or can be<br>
prepared by processes known per se (cf. DE-A 22 18 097, DE-A 23 50 547).<br>
The compounds of the general formula (IV-d) to be used as safeners are known and/or can be<br>
prepared by processes known per se (cf. DE-A 196 21 522, US 6,235,680).<br>
The compounds of the general formula (IV-e) to be used as safeners are known and/or can be<br>
prepared by processes known per se (cf. WO 99/66795, US 6,251,827).<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the active compound combinations, defined above, of haloalkylnicotinic acid derivatives of the general formula (I), phthalic acid diamides of the formula (II) or anthranilamides of the formula (III) and safeners (antidotes) of group (b) listed above have very good insecticidal and/or acaricidal activity, are very well tolerated by useful plants and can be used in various crops for the selective control of insects.<br>
Here, it has to be considered to be entirely surprising that the compounds of group (b) listed above are in some cases capable of increasing the insecticidal and/or acaricidal activity of the haloalkylnicotinic acid derivatives of the general formula (I), the phthalic acid diamides of the<br>
general formula (II) or the anthranilamides of the general formula (III) such that a synergistic effect is observed.<br>
The combinations of active compounds can generally be used, for example, for the following plants:<br>
Dicotyledonous crops of the genera; Gossypium, Glycine, Beta, Daucus, Phaseolus, Pisum, Solanum,<br>
Linum, Ipomoea, Vicia, Nicotiana, Lycopersicon, Arachis, Brassica, Lactuca, Cucumis, Cuburbita,<br>
Helianthus.<br>
Monocotyledonous crops of the genera: Oryza, Zea, Triticum, Hordeum, Avena, Secale, Sorghum,<br>
Panicum, Saccharum, Ananas, Asparagus, Allium.<br>
However, the use of the combination of active compounds is by no means limited to these genera but equally also extends to other plants.<br>
The advantageous effect of the crop plant compatibility of the combinations of active compounds is particularly strongly pronounced at certain concentration ratios. However, the weight ratios of the active compounds in the combinations of active compounds can be varied within relatively wide ranges, hi general, 0.001 to 1000 parts by weight, preferably 0.01 to 100 parts by weight, particularly preferably 0.05 to 10 parts by weight and most preferably 0.07 to 1.5 parts by weight of one of the crop plant compatibility-improving compounds (antidotes/safeners) mentioned above under (b) are present per part by weight of active compound of the formula (I) or (II) or (HI).<br>
The active compounds or combinations of active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspoemulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compounds and microencapsulations in polymeric materials.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surface-active agents, that is, emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to use for example organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Suitable liquid solvents are mainly: aromatics, such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example mineral oil fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols, such as butanol or glycol and ethers and esters<br>
thereof, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide, and water.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are:<br>
for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates; suitable as solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, and synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, corn cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable as emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulfonates, alkyl sulfates, arylsulfonates and protein hydrolysates; suitable as dispersants are: for example lignosulfite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, and natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Other possible additives are mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations in general comprise between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The combinations of active compounds are generally applied in the form of ready-to-use formulations. However, the active compounds contained in the combinations of active compounds may also be applied in the form of individual formulations which are mixed upon use, that is, in the form of tank mixes.<br>
The combinations of active compounds, as such or in their formulations, may furthermore also be used as a mixture with other known herbicides, again with ready-to-use formulations or tank mixes being possible. A mixture with other known active compounds, such as fungicides, insecticides,<br>
acaricides, nematicides, attractants, sterilants, bactericides, bird repellents, growth substances, plant nutrients and soil conditioners is also possible. It may furthermore be advantageous for specific applications, in particular for the post-emergence method, to incorporate into the formulations plant-compatible mineral or vegetable oils (for example the commercial product "Rako Binol") or ammonium salts, such as, for example, ammonium sulfate or ammonium thiocyanate, as further additives.<br>
The combinations of active compounds can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or the use forms which can be prepared from these formulations by further dilution, such as ready-to-use solutions, suspensions, emulsions, powders, pastes and granules. Application is effected in the customary manner, for example by watering, spraying, atomizing, dusting or broadcasting.<br>
The application rates of the combination of active compounds can be varied within a certain range; they depend, inter alia, on the weather and the soil factors. In general, the application rates are from 0.005 to 5 kg per ha, preferably from 0.01 to 2 kg per ha, particularly preferably from 0.05 to 1.0 kg per ha.<br>
The combinations of active compounds can be applied before and after emergence of the plants, i.e. by the pre-emergence and the post-emergence method.<br>
Depending on their properties, the safeners to be used can be employed for pretreating the seed of the crop plant (seed dressing) or be incorporated into the seed furrows before sowing or, together with the herbicide, be applied before or after emergence of the plants.<br>
The combinations of active compounds are suitable for controlling animal pests, preferably arthropods and nematodes, in particular insects and arachnids, encountered in agriculture, animal health in forests, in stored-product and material protection and in the hygiene sector. They are effective against normally sensitive and resistant species and against all or individual stages of development. The abovementioned pests include:<br>

When used as insecticides, the combinations of active compounds can furthermore be present, in their commercial formulations and in the use forms prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with synergists. Synergists are compounds which enhance the activity of the active compounds, without it being necessary for the added synergist to be active for its part.<br>
The content of active compounds of the use forms prepared from the commercial formulations may vary within wide ranges. The concentration of active compounds of the use forms may be from 0.0000001 to 95% by weight of active compound and is preferably from 0.0001 to 1% by weight.<br>
Application is carried out in a customary manner adapted to the use forms.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to treat all plants and parts of plants. Plants are to be understood here as meaning all plants and plant populations such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant cultivars which can or cannot be protected by plant breeder's certificates. Parts of plants are to be understood as meaning all above-ground and below-ground parts and organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stems, trunks,<br>
flowers, fruit-bodies, fruits and seeds and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. Parts of plants also include harvested plants and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example seedlings, tubers, rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.<br>
The treatment of the plants and parts of plants according to the invention with the active compounds is carried out directly or by action on their environment, habitat or storage area according to customary treatment methods, for example by dipping, spraying, evaporating, atomizing, broadcasting, brushing-on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, furthermore by one- or multi-layer coating.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant varieties, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding methods, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant varieties obtained by genetic engineering, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetic Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant varieties which are in each case commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant varieties, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions which can be used according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant varieties (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which are preferred and to be treated according to the invention include all plants which, in the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparts particularly advantageous useful traits to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a<br>
higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defense of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), corn, soybeans, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to corn, soybeans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits that are particularly emphasized are the increased defense of the plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CrylllA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulfonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are com varieties, cotton varieties, soybean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD CARD® (for example corn, cotton, soyabeans), KnockOut® (for example corn), StarLink® (for example corn), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are corn varieties, cotton varieties and soybean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example corn, cotton, soybean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulfonylureas, for example corn). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example corn). Of course, these statements also apply to plant varieties having these or still-to-be-developed genetic traits, which plants will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with the active compound mixtures. The preferred ranges stated above for the mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>
Formula for calculating the kill rate of a combination of two active compounds<br>
The expected activity for a given combination of two active compounds can be calculated (cf. Colby, S.R.; "Calculating Synergistic and Antagonistic Responses of Herbicide Combinations", Weeds 15, pages 20-22, 1967):<br>
if<br>
X =	the kill rate, expressed in % of the untreated control, when employing active<br>
compound A at an application rate of m ppm,<br>
Y =	the kill rate, expressed in % of the untreated control, when employing active<br>
compound B at an application rate of n ppm,<br>
E =	the kill rate, expressed in % of the untreated control, when employing active<br>
compounds A and B at application rates of m and n ppm,<br>
y v v<br>
then	E = X + Y -<br>
100<br>
If the actual insecticidal kill rate is higher than the calculated one, the kill of the combination is superadditive, i.e. a synergistic effect is present. In this case, the kill rate that is actually observed has to be higher than the value, calculated using the formula above, for the expected kill rate (E).<br>
