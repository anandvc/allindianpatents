DATA TRANSMISSION METHOD USING MAPPING ON<br>
SIGNAL CONSTELLATION<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a wireless communication, and more particularly, to<br>
a data transmission method which can obtain diversity gain by using mapping on<br>
signal constellation in a wireless communication system.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	Requirements for communication services have been rapidly increased as various<br>
multimedia services and high-quality services appear. A variety of wireless com-<br>
munication technologies have been studied in various technical fields so as to meet<br>
such requirements.<br>
[3]	Diversity technique is known as a technique for securing the reliability in com-<br>
munication system. By transmitting same data through multiple paths, data can reliably<br>
be reconstructed since data through some path can be reliable although data through<br>
the other paths are erroneous. An advantage of the diversity technique is to stably<br>
transmit and/or receive data through multiple paths independent of each other.<br>
[4]	Examples of the diversity technique include frequency diversity, time diversity and<br>
spatial diversity. The spatial diversity employs multiple transmit antennas.<br>
[5]	Since the spatial diversity is adapted on the condition that channel between transmit<br>
antenna and receive antenna is not varied at the time of transmission, inter-symbol in-<br>
terference (ISI) can be caused due to fast fading.<br>
[6]	Space-time code (STC) has been developed to obtain spatial diversity gain. When a<br>
transmitter uses the STC, a maximum likelihood (ML) receiver can achieve optimal<br>
performance. But it is not easy to implement the ML receiver in the actual com-<br>
munication system since the complexity of the ML receiver exponentially increases as<br>
number of transmit antennas and modulation order increases. A minimum means-<br>
square error (MMSE) receiver can implement easier than the ML receiver. But the<br>
MMSE receiver has to store channel information in a buffer since the STC is decoded<br>
by using cumulative combining technique. Also, the performance of the STC can be<br>
deteriorated in time-varying channel highly influenced by Doppler effect.<br>
[7]	A hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) technique in which forward error<br>
correction (FEC) and automatic repeat request (ARQ) are combined is known as<br>
another example for enhancing the reliability in communication system. The HARQ<br>
enhances the reliability by re-transmitting data when the data include decodable errors.<br>
An example of the HARQ is described in D. Chase, Code Combining: A maximum-<br><br>
likelihood decoding approach for combining an arbitrary number of noisy packets,<br>
IEEE Trans. on Commun., Vol. 33, pp. 593-607, May, 1985.<br>
[8]	In general, the HARQ can be classified into Type 1, Type II, and Type III. In Type I<br>
HARQ, a receiver discard s data from which an error is detected and a transmitter re-<br>
transmits the data. In Type II HARQ, a receiver does not discard data from which an<br>
error is detected. The receiver combines the erroneous data with re-transmitted data.<br>
The erroneous data and the re-transmitted data may have different code rates or<br>
modulation schemes. In Type HI HARQ, a transmitter re-transmits data which is self-<br>
decodable.<br>
[9]	In addition, the HARQ can be classified into chase combining and IR (Incremental<br>
Redundancy). The chase combining is a modified scheme of Type I HARQ. A receiver<br>
does not discard data from which an error is detected and combines the erroneous data<br>
with re-transmitted data. In chase combining, the erroneous data and the re-transmitted<br>
includes same information bits. In IR, a transmitter re-transmits data which in-<br>
crementally includes additional redundant information.<br>
[10]	Examples of the HARQ are described in S. Lin, D. J. Costello, M. J. Miller,<br>
Automatic repeat request error control schemes, IEEE Communications Magazine,<br>
Vol. 22. No. 12, pp. 5-17, Dec. 1984 and D. Chase, Code Combining: A maximum-<br>
likelihood decoding approach for combining an arbitrary number of noisy packets,<br>
IEEE Trans, on Commun., Vol. 33, pp. 593-607, May, 1985.<br>
[11]	Although the HARQ employs re-transmission of data, there is no spatial diversity<br>
gain when one transmit antenna is used. In multiple antenna system, the HARQ can<br>
obtain spatial diversity gain to enhance reliability of data. However, in slow fading the<br>
HARQ may have no gain since channel state is almost not varied when re-transmission<br>
occurs. In fast fading, ISI may be caused due to the spatial diversity.<br>
[12]	Therefore, there is a need for a method of enhancing the reliability of data in<br>
multiple antenna system.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[13]	An advantage of some aspects of the invention is that it provides a data<br>
transmission method in which remapping between data symbols is performed.<br>
[14]	Another advantage of some aspects of the invention is that it provides a data<br>
transmission method using an HARQ in which data symbol is re-transmitted after<br>
remapped on signal constellation.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[15]	According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided a data transmission<br>
method including performing a bit remapping on signal constellation to form a<br><br>
plurality of data symbols, modulating the plurality of data symbols, and transmitting<br>
the modulated data symbols.<br>
[16]	According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a data transmission<br>
method using an HARQ (Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request) including transmitting a<br>
transmission symbol, receiving a re-transmission request signal for the transmission<br>
symbol, and transmitting a re-transmission symbol obtained by remapping the<br>
transmission symbol in response to the re-transmission request signal.<br>
[17]	According to still another aspect of the invention, there is provided a transmitter<br>
including an antenna, an adaptive mapper configured to rearranges a plurality of data<br>
symbols by bits on a signal constellation, and a modulator configured to modulate the<br>
rearranged data symbols to form transmission symbols to be transmitted through the<br>
antenna.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
[18]	It is possible to obtain space-time diversity gain without additional complexity. This<br>
configuration can be easily embodied because a known receiver can be used.<br>
[19]	It is possible to obtain additional diversity gain by re-transmitting symbols<br>
remapped spatially and temporally and also to enhance the performance of HARQ by<br>
minimizing the number of retransmission.<br>
[20]	It is also possible to obtain diversity gain by averagely enhancing the channel re-<br>
liability of bits by remapping. By performing the bit mapping on the signal con-<br>
stellation every time of transmission in consideration of time and/or space mul-<br>
tiplexing, it is possible to obtain mapping diversity. Spatial diversity gain is obtained<br>
by changing transmit antenna.<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[86]	The following techniques can be used in a variety of communication systems. Com-<br>
munications systems are widely spread to provide a variety of communication services<br>
such as voices, packets, and data. The techniques according to exemplary embodiments<br>
of the invention can be used for a downlink and an uplink. In general, the term<br>
'downlink' means a communication directed from a base station to a user equipment<br>
and the term "uplink' means a communication directed from a user equipment to a base<br>
station. The base station (BS) means a fixed station communicating with a user<br>
equipment, and can be called other terms such as a node-B, a BTS (Base Transceiver<br><br>
System), and an access point. The user equipment (UE) can be fixed or movable, and<br>
can be called other terms such as a mobile station (MS), a user terminal (UT), a<br>
subscriber station (SS), and a wireless device.<br>
[87]	A communication system may have a single transmit antenna as well as multiple<br>
transmit antennas. The communication system may be one of a multiple-input<br>
multiple-output (MIMO) system, a multiple-input single-output (MISO) system, a<br>
single-input single-output (SISO) system, and a single-input multiple-output (SLMO)<br>
system. The MIMO system uses multiple transmit antennas and multiple receiving<br>
antennas. The MISO system uses multiple transmit antennas and a single receiving<br>
antenna. The SISO system uses a single transmit antenna and a single receiving<br>
antenna. The SIMO system uses a single transmit antenna and multiple receiving<br>
antennas.<br>
[88]	The multiple access modulation system is not limited and may employ a single<br>
carrier modulation system such as a known code division multiple access (CDMA) or a<br>
multiple carrier modulation system such as OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division<br>
Multiplexing)/OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access).<br>
[891<br>
[90]	I. MAPPING IN OPEN-LOOP TRANSMISSION DIVERSITY<br>
[91]	Here, open loop means that re-transmission is not performed and the transmission<br>
diversity system transmits at least one data symbol through a transmit antenna.<br>
[92]	FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a communication system according to an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the invention.<br>
[93]	Referring to FIG. 1, a communication system includes a transmitter 10 and a<br>
receiver 20. In downlink, the transmitter 10 may be a part of a base station and the<br>
receiver 20 may be a part of a user equipment. In uplink, the transmitter 10 may be part<br>
of a user equipment and the receiver 20 may be a part of a base station. A base station<br>
may include plural receivers and plural transmitters. A user equipment may include<br>
plural receivers and plural transmitters.<br>
[94]	The transmitter 10 includes a channel encoder 11, an adaptive mapper 12, and a<br>
spatial encoder 15. The transmitter 10 includes Nt (where Nt&gt;l) transmit antennas<br>
19-1,..., 19-Nt.<br>
[95]	The channel encoder 11 receives a stream of information bits and encodes the series<br>
of information bits by the use of a predetermined coding method to form coded data.<br>
The information bits include texts, voices, images, and other data. Symbols including<br>
the coded data are hereinafter referred to as coded symbols.<br>
[96]	The adaptive mapper 12 maps the coded symbols into data symbols representing<br>
positions on a signal constellation. The data symbols are an output of the adaptive<br>
mapper 12 and can be expressed a set of bit sequences representing complex values on<br><br>
the signal constellation depending on the modulation scheme. The modulation scheme<br>
performed by the adaptive mapper 12 is not particularly limited and may be an m-PSK<br>
(m-Phase Shift Keying) scheme or an m-WAM (m-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)<br>
scheme. For example, the m-PSK may be one of BPSK, QPSK, and 8-PSK. The m-<br>
QAM may be one of 16-QAM, 64-Qam, and 256-QAM. An operation of the adaptive<br>
mapper 12 will be described later in association with a data transmission method.<br>
[97]	The spatial encoder 15 allocates the data symbols output from the adaptive mapper<br>
12 to the transmit antennas 19-1, ..., 19-Nt. The spatial encoder 15 serves to convert<br>
the serial data symbols into parallel data corresponding to the transmit antennas 19-1,<br>
..., 19-Nt. The spatial encoder 15 processes the data symbols by the use of the space-<br>
time coding scheme and allocates the processed data symbols to the transmit antennas<br>
19-1,..., 19-Nt.<br>
[98]	The modulators 16-1, ..., 16-Nt modulate the parallel data by the use of a multiple<br>
access modulation scheme to form transmission symbols. One packet may include one<br>
or plural transmission symbols. The transmission symbols are transmitted through the<br>
transmit antennas 19-1,..., 19-Nt.<br>
[99]	In the OFDM scheme, the modulators 16-1,..., 16-Nt perform an IFFT (Inverse<br>
Fast Fourier Transform) process. In this case, one data symbol is loaded into one<br>
subcarrier and the transmission symbols transmitted through plural carrier waves<br>
include plural data symbols. In the OFDM scheme, the transmission symbol can be<br>
said as an OFDM symbol.<br>
[100]	The receiver 20 includes a spatial decoder 22, a demapper 23, and a channel<br>
decoder 24. The receiver 20 includes Nr (where Nr&gt;l) receiving antennas 29-1,<br>
29-Nr.<br>
[101]	The signals received by the receiving antennas 29-1, ..., 29-Nr are demodulated by<br>
the modulators 21-1,..., 21-Nr and are input to the spatial decoder 22. The data<br>
symbols output from the spatial decoder 22 are input to the demapper 23 and are<br>
demapped into coded data. The channel decoder 24 decodes the coded data to re-<br>
construct the original data by the use of a predetermined decoding method.<br>
[102]	Hereinafter, S nm represents a data symbol transmiited through the n-fh time slot and<br><br>
the m-th transmit antenna. The time slot means a time interval for which one symbol is<br>
transmitted. denotes bit sequences i to i+3 constituting the cor-<br>
responding data symbol. However, this is only an example. The data symbol may<br>
include bit sequences representing complex values on a signal constellation and the<br>
number of bits of the data symbol may be 4 or more, or 4 or less.<br>
[103]	FIG. 2 is a signal constellation diagram illustrating a bit error rate in a constellation<br>
mapping. This signal constellation diagram is based on a gray mapping signal con-<br>
stellation diagram in the 16-QAM scheme. At least one bit is mapped to one symbol on<br><br>
the signal constellation. Examples of the constellation mapping scheme can include<br>
BPSK, QPSK, and 16-QAM and the number of bits mapped to one symbol varies<br>
depending on the types. A symbol is transmitted through an I (In-phase) channel and a<br>
Q (Quadrature) channel.<br>
[104]	Referring to FIG. 2, a signal constellation is composed of a set of two partitions.<br>
That is, the signal constellation can be divided into first and second partitions in which<br>
the bit values at one position are equal to each other and the bit values at the other<br>
positions are different from each other. The signal constellation can be divided into<br>
two partitions of which only the first bit values from the left end are different from<br>
each other, two partitions of which only the second bit values are different from each<br>
other, two partitions of which only the third bit values are different from each other,<br>
and two partitions of which only the fourth bit values are different from each other.<br>
The sets of partitions are different depending on the bit positions, which is because<br>
inter-symbol distances are different.<br>
[105]	FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating an inter-symbol distance in a signal constellation<br>
diagram shown in FIG. 2.<br>
[106]	Referring to FIG. 3, the inter-symbol distance varies when the first bit and the<br>
second bit are different from each other, and the inter-symbol distance does not vary<br>
when the third bit and the fourth bit are different from each other. The variation in<br>
inter-symbol distance means that the probability of the bit error at the respective bit<br>
positions varies.<br>
[ 107]	One symbol composed of at least one bit has an error rate varying depending on the<br>
bit positions. This fact can be utilized in a multiple antenna system. When the symbol<br>
is rearranged and transmitted in consideration of a spatial diversity gain using the<br>
multiple antennas and a time diversity gain using a time delay, it is possible to obtain<br>
an additional diversity gain. That is, by transmitting plural bits constituting one symbol<br>
through paths temporally and/or spatially different from the original path, it is possible<br>
to enhance the channel reliability of the bits constituting a data symbol as a whole.<br>
[108]	FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating an example of an adaptive mapping scheme. Here,<br>
the number of transmit antennas is 2 (Nt=2) and the data symbols through two time<br>
slots are expressed using the 16-QAM scheme. In this case, the transmission diversity<br>
can be obtained by the mapping and the time delay. The left side shows the data<br>
symbols C ki by the use of a conventional mapping scheme and the right side shows the<br>
data symbols S ki by the use of an adaptive mapping scheme. C ki and S ki denote a data<br>
symbol transmitted through the i-th time slot in the k-th transmit antenna.<br>
[109]	Referring to FIG. 4, S11 is constructed by swapping bit b2 with bit b14 of S2 2 and<br>
swapping bit b4 with bit b of S2 1 . S12 is constructed by swapping bit b10 with bit b6 of<br>
S2 1 and swapping bit b12 with bit b16 of S2 2 . S2 1 is constructed by swapping bit b6<br><br>
with bit b10 of S12 and swapping bit b8 with bit b4 of S11 . S2 2 is constructed by<br>
swapping bit b14 with bit b2 of S11 and swapping bit b16 with bit b12 of S12 . Ac-<br>
cordingly, bits (b1 , b3) of S11 are transmitted through the same paths (through the same<br>
antennas and the same time slots) as bits (b1 , b3 ) of C11 at the same positions even by<br>
the adaptive mapping process, but bit b4 of C11 is shifted to S2 1 and is transmitted<br>
through a transmit antenna different from the original path. In addition, bit b2 of C11 is<br>
shifted to S2 2 and is transmitted through a transmit antenna and a time slot different<br>
from the original path. 4 bits [b1 , b2 , b3 , b4 } of C11 using a conventional mapping<br>
scheme are transmitted through transmit antennas and/or time slots different depending<br>
on the bits by using the adaptive mapping scheme.<br>
[110]	The adaptive mapper performs a remapping process on the bits constituting the<br>
signal constellation in different data symbols. Here, the remapping process means that<br>
the bits of the data symbols are swapped and/or replaced, but does not necessarily<br>
mean that the data symbols are mapped and a new mapping process is performed<br>
thereon. The optimal mapping method of swapping and replacing the bits of the<br>
symbols by the use of a signal constellation rearranging method can be desired<br>
depending on the number of antennas, the modulation order, the time slots, and the<br>
channel conditions.<br>
[111]	The number of bits temporally and spatially swapped with each other is exemplified<br>
as two per data symbol, but the number of bits swapped with each other is not limited.<br>
The bits may be swapped with each other bit by bit or by three or more bits. The<br>
swapping method is not limited to the shown example, but may be different depending<br>
on the signal constellation diagram.<br>
[112]	The number of data symbols which are transmitted for two time slots through two<br>
transmit antennas is 4 and the bits of the data symbols are spatially and/or temporally<br>
rearranged. The rearrangement means to swap and/or replace the bits with each other<br>
and may include omission and/or addition of the bits. The spatial rearrangement means<br>
to rearrange the data symbols with respect to the transmit antennas and, for example,<br>
may be to rearrange S11 and S2 1 . The spatial rearrangement means to rearrange the<br>
data symbols with respect to the time slots and, for example, may be to rearrange S<br>
and S2 1<br><br>
[113]	The data symbols can be spatially and temporally rearranged every time slot. Al-<br>
ternatively, the rearrangement may be performed only once.<br>
[114]	The criterion for determining the rearrangement method is not limited, and may be<br>
different every transmission. The rearrangement of the bits of the data symbols may be<br>
different depending on the number of antennas, the modulation orders, the time slots,<br>
and the channel conditions. Alternatively, the bits may be rearranged by a fixed<br>
method regardless of the channel conditions.<br><br>
[115]	The criterion for determining the remapping method may be determined and<br>
transmitted to the receiver by the transmitter in an open loop manner. Alternatively, the<br>
criterion may be determined and fed back to the transmitter by the receiver in a closed<br>
loop manner.<br>
[116]	When the data symbols are spatially rearranged, the signal constellation positions of<br>
the data symbols are changed. Accordingly, the signal constellation mapping is<br>
changed. That is, in the invention, the diversity is implemented by performing the<br>
signal constellation mapping spatially and temporally different on the data symbols<br>
every transmission. This is referred to as mapping diversity.<br>
[117]	The diversity gain is obtained by averagely enhancing the channel reliability of the<br>
bits of the data symbols. That is, by performing the bit mapping on the signal con-<br>
stellation every transmission in consideration of the spatial and temporal multiplexing,<br>
it is possible to secure the mapping diversity due to the variation in channel.<br>
[118]	FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating another example of the adaptive mapping scheme.<br>
[119]	Referring to FIG. 5, the left side shows a conventional mapping scheme and the<br>
right side shows an adaptive mapping scheme.<br><br>
means that it is replaced with its complement. S11 is constructed by swapping bit b<br>
with bit b14 of S12 and replacing it with its complement, and swapping bit b with bit b<br>
8 of S2 1 and replacing it with its complement. S 12 is constructed by swapping bit b<br>
with bit b6 of S2 1 and replacing it with its complement, and swapping bit b12 with bit b<br>
16 of S2 2and replacing it with its complement. S2 1 is constructed by swapping bit b6<br>
with bit b10 of S12 and replacing it with its complement, and swapping bit b8 with bit b4<br>
of S11 and replacing it with its complement. S2 2 is constructed by swapping bit b14<br>
with bit b2 of S11 and replacing it with its complement, and swapping bit b16 with bit b<br>
12 of S12 and replacing it with its complement. Here, the bits spatially and temporally<br>
swapped with each other are replaced, but other bits not swapped may be replaced.<br>
[120]	FIG. 6 is a diagram illustrating an example of an adaptive mapping scheme on<br>
STBC (Space-Time Block Code).<br>
[121]	Referring to FIG. 6, Alamouti STBC in a system having two transmit antennas is<br>
shown in Table 1 as well known in the art.<br>
[122]	Table 1<br><br>
[123]	It is possible to greatly reduce the complexity of the receiver by using the Alamouti<br><br>
code. Here, S1* and S2 * are complex conjugates of S1 and S2 . The transmission<br>
symbols S1 and S2 are temporally or spatially rearranged and the result thereof is<br>
transmitted through the STBC.<br>
[124]	The left side shows a conventional mapping scheme and the right side shows an<br>
adaptive mapping scheme. S1 is constructed by swapping bit b2 with bit b5 of S2 ,<br>
swapping bit b3 with bit b6 of S2 , and exchanging the positions of four bits. S2 is<br>
constructed by swapping the bits with bits of S1 and exchanging the positions of four<br>
bits. That is, also in the STBC, the signal constellation mapping on the data symbols to<br>
be transmitted can be changed to obtain diversity gain.<br>
[125]	FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating another example of the adaptive mapping scheme on<br>
the STBC.<br>
[126]	Referring to FIG. 7, the left side shows a conventional mapping scheme and the<br>
right side shows an adaptive mapping scheme. S1 is constructed by swapping and<br>
replacing bit b2 with bit b5 of S2 , swapping and replacing bit b3 with bit b6 of S2 , and<br>
exchanging the positions of four bits. S is constructed by swapping and replacing the<br>
bits with the bits of S1 and exchanging the positions of four bits.<br>
[127]	Here, the STBC system having two antennas has been described, but the technical<br>
spirit of the invention can be applied to a system having three or more antennas<br>
without any change. The technical spirit of the invention can be applied to a space-time<br>
trellis code (STTC) as well as the STBC system.<br>
[128]	It has been described that one data symbol is transmitted through one time slot, but<br>
plural data symbols may be transmitted through one time slot. One data symbol is<br>
modulated into one transmission symbol when one data symbol is transmitted through<br>
one time slot. In a system employing multiple subcarriers, since one data symbol is<br>
loaded into one subcarrier, plural data symbols are modulated into one transmission<br>
symbol and the transmission symbol can be said to include plural data symbols. In this<br>
case, the data symbols can be spatially and temporally rearranged and the plural data<br>
symbols transmitted through one time slot can be rearranged. In addition, the plural<br>
data symbols constituting one packet can be rearranged. Accordingly, the technical<br>
spirit of the invention includes cases where at least two data symbols different from<br>
each other are remapped by subcarriers, times, and spaces.<br>
[129]	FIG. 8 is a block diagram illustrating a transmitter according to an embodiment of<br>
the invention.<br>
[130]	Referring to FIG. 8, a transmitter 70 includes a channel encoder 71, an adaptive<br>
mapper 72, and a modulator 73. The transmitter 70 further includes one antenna 79.<br>
[131]	The adaptive mapper 72 can enhance the diversity gain by remapping the data<br>
symbol S1 transmitted through the first time slot Tl and the data symbol S2 transmitted<br>
through the second time slot T2 relative to each other. That is, it is possible to<br><br>
temporally remap the data symbols.<br>
[132]	In another example, plural data symbols may be transmitted through one time slot.<br>
For example, in a packet transmitting system, plural data symbols may be included in<br>
one packet. In this case, the data symbols transmitted through one time slot can be<br>
remapped relative to each other.<br>
[133]	The adaptive mapper employing a space-time multiplexing process performs a<br>
remapping process on the bits of the data symbols to be output from the mapper using<br>
swapping and/or replacement, depending on the mapping method, the channel en-<br>
vironment, the number of transmit antennas, and the time slots. By transmitting the<br>
remapped data symbols, it is possible to obtain an additional diversity gain, in addition<br>
to the space and time diversity gains. A receiver can perform final decoding process by<br>
swapping only the positions of soft-decision bits output from a demapper.<br>
[134]	The adaptive mapper can secure the additional diversity gain while obtaining the<br>
space and time diversity gains without any additional complexity. The adaptive mapper<br>
can be embodied without modifying the structure of a general receiver such as an<br>
MMSE receiver or a ZF (Zero-Forcing) receiver. In addition, it is possible to obtain an<br>
additional diversity gain even in a channel environment in which the space-time coding<br>
technique and the cyclic delay diversity technique may be deteriorated.<br>
[135]<br>
[136]	II. MAPPING IN CYCLIC DELAY DEVIERSITY<br>
[137]	FIG. 9 is a block diagram illustrating a transmitter according to another<br>
embodiment of the invention. This is a transmitter using a cyclic delay diversity<br>
technique.<br>
[138]	Referring to FIG. 9, a transmitter 50 includes a channel encoder 51, an adaptive<br>
mapper 52, a spatial encoder 55, IFFT units 56-1, ..., 56-Nt, and delay units 57-1, ...,<br>
57-(Nt-l). The transmitter 50 uses the IFFT units 56-1, ..., 56-Nt as an OFDM<br>
modulator. The transmitter 50 using the cyclic delay diversity transmits the data<br>
symbols through plural transmit antennas 59-1,..., 59-Nt so as to have like or different<br>
power and different cyclic delays. In such a cyclic delay diversity, a signal transmitted<br>
through the plural transmit antennas is similar to a signal transmitted to a receiver<br>
through multiple paths, thereby greatly reducing the complexity in the receiver's<br>
detection of the signal.<br>
[139]	Information bits become data symbols while passing through the channel encoder<br>
51 and the adaptive mapper 52. The data symbols pass through the spatial encoder 55<br>
and are converted into transmission symbols in the IFFT process of the IFFT units<br>
56-1,..., 56-Nt. The delay units 57-1,..., 57-(Nt-l) cyclically delay the transmission<br>
symbols. A CP (Cyclic Prefix) is inserted into the delayed transmission symbols by the<br>
CP insertion units 58-1,..., 58-Nt) and the transmission symbols are transmitted<br><br>
through the transmit antennas 59-1,..., 59-Nt.<br>
[140]	The delay times ∆1 , ..., ∆Nt-1 delayed by the delay units 57-1, ..., 57-(Nt-l) may<br>
have a constant value or may have different values by users. The delay times ∆1 , ..., ∆Nt-1<br>
may be adjusted by receiving the corresponding information from a receiver in a<br>
feedback manner.<br>
[141]	The adaptive mapper 52 rearranges the data symbols temporally, spatially, and by<br>
subcarriers to obtain a diversity gain. The rearranged data symbols are modulated into<br>
the transmission symbols and the transmission symbols are cyclically delayed, thereby<br>
obtaining the multiplexing diversity gain.<br>
[142]	FIG. 10 is a diagram illustrating an example of an adaptive mapping. Here, one<br>
symbol S is cyclically delayed through four transmit antennas (Nt=4) and then<br>
transmitted. The data symbols transmitted through the transmit antennas are S1 , S1 (∆ 1),<br>
S (∆ 1), and S (∆ 1). The data symbol S1 is not delayed, but S1 (∆ 1) is cyclically delayed<br>
by ∆1 . bk(i) denotes the i-th bit of a symbol transmitted through the k-th transmit<br>
antenna. The left side shows a data symbol C1 using a conventional mapping scheme<br>
and the right side shows a data symbol S using the adaptive mapping scheme. CKi and<br>
Sk1 denote data symbols which is transmitted through the i-th time slot in the k-th<br>
transmit antenna.<br>
[143]	Referring to FIG. 10, bits (b1 (1), b3 (1)) of the data symbol S1 are transmitted through<br>
the same path (the same transmit antenna) as bits (b1 (1), b3 (1)) equal thereto in position<br>
even by the use of the adaptive mapping, but bit b4 (1) is shifted to S1 (∆2), is cyclically<br>
delayed, and is transmitted through a different transmit antenna. Bit b2 (1) of C1 is<br>
shifted to S1 (∆ 3) and is subjected to a cyclic delay and a transmit antenna different<br>
from the original path. That is, Cl={b1 (1). b2 (1), b3 (1), b4 (1)} using the conventional<br>
mapping is rearranged in S1 , S1 (∆ 1), S1 (∆ 2), S1 (∆3) by bits using the adaptive mapping<br>
and is transmitted through transmit antennas and/or cyclic delays different from each<br>
other.<br>
[144]	The number of bits swapped in each data symbol is exemplified as two per data<br>
symbol, but the number of bits to be swapped is not limited. One bit may be swapped<br>
or three or more bits may be swapped.<br>
[145]	It has been shown that the data symbols are spatially rearranged using one time slot,<br>
but the data symbols may be temporally and spatially rearranged using two or more<br>
time slots.<br>
[ 146]	FIG. 11 is a diagram illustrating another example of the adaptive mapping.<br>
[147]	Referring to FIG. 11, the left side shows a conventional mapping scheme and the<br>
right side shows an adaptive mapping scheme. By spatially swapping and replacing the<br>
bits at the level of bit, it is possible to obtain an additional diversity gain.<br>
[148]	The bits spatially swapped with each other are subjected to replacement herein, but<br><br>
the bits not swapped may be subjected to replacement. The swapping and replacement<br>
may be performed using two or more time slots.<br>
[149]	In the examples shown in FIGs. 10 and 11, one data symbol is cyclically delayed<br>
and transmitted through the multiple transmit antennas. At this time, the transmission<br>
rate is 1. A plurality of data symbols can be transmitted through a plurality of transmit<br>
antennas. For example, four data symbols of S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4 can be cyclically delayed<br>
and transmitted through four transmit antennas. At this time, the transmission rate is 4.<br>
[150]	FIG. 12 is a diagram illustrating an example of the adaptive mapping scheme in a<br>
system supporting multiple transmission rates. Here, four data symbols S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4 <br>
are cyclically delayed and transmitted through four transmit antennas (Nt=4). The<br>
data symbols transmitted through the transmit antennas become S1 , S2 (∆1 ), S3 (∆2 ), and<br>
S4 (∆3 ). Data symbol S1 is not delayed and S (∆1 ) is cyclically delayed by time delay A .<br>
The left side shows the data symbols C1 , C2 (∆1 ), C3 (∆2 ), and C4 (∆3) using a con-<br>
ventional mapping scheme and the right side shows the data symbols S1 , S2 (∆1 ), S3 (∆2),<br>
and S4 (∆3) using the adaptive mapping scheme.<br>
[151]	Referring to FIG. 12, bits (b1 , b3 ) of S1 are transmitted through the same paths (the<br>
same antennas) as bits (b1 , b3 ) of C at the same positions even by using the adaptive<br>
mapping scheme, but bit b4 of C1 is shifted to S3 (∆2 ), is cyclically delayed, and is<br>
transmitted through a different transmit antenna. In addition, bit b2 of C1 is shifted to S4 <br>
(∆3 ) and is subjected to the cyclic delay and the transmission through a transmit<br>
antenna different from the original path. That is, unlike C1 ={b1 , b2 , b3 , b4 }, the data<br>
symbols are rearranged in S1 , S2 (∆1 ), S3 (∆2), and S (∆3) by the use of the adaptive<br>
mapping scheme and are transmitted through transmit antennas and/or cyclic delays<br>
different from each other.<br>
[152]	The number of bits swapped in each data symbol is exemplified as two per data<br>
symbol, but the number of bits to be swapped is not limited. One bit may be swapped<br>
or three or more bits may be swapped.<br>
[153]	It has been described that the data symbols are spatially rearranged using one time<br>
slot, but the data symbols may be temporally and spatially rearranged using two or<br>
more time slots.<br>
[154]	FIG. 13 is a diagram illustrating another example of the adaptive mapping.<br>
[155]	Referring to FIG. 13, the left side shows a conventional mapping scheme and the<br>
right side shows an adaptive mapping scheme. By spatially swapping and replacing the<br>
bits at the level of bit, it is possible to obtain an additional diversity gain.<br>
[156]	The bits spatially swapped with each other are subjected to replacement herein, but<br>
the bits not swapped may be subjected to replacement. The swapping and replacement<br>
may be performed using two or more time slots.<br>
[157]	The swapping and replacement by bits are only an example. The rearrangement<br><br>
using the swapping and/or replacement by bits of the data symbols may be performed<br>
in various methods.<br>
[158J	FIG. 14 is a block diagram illustrating a transmitter according to another<br>
embodiment of the invention. Here, the delay units of the transmitter 50 shown in FIG.<br>
9 are moved to a frequency domain.<br>
[159]	Referring to FIG. 14, phase delay units 67-1,..., 67-(Nt-l) are disposed between<br>
the spatial encoder 65 and the IFFT unit 68-1, ..., 68-Nt and serve to cyclically delay<br>
the phases of the symbols.<br>
[160]	The phase delay units 67-1,..., 67-(Nt-l) in the frequency domain are equivalent to<br>
the delay unit 57-1, ..., 57-(Nt-l) in the time domain of the transmitter 50 shown in<br>
FIG. 9. The time delay in the time domain and the phase delay in the frequency domain<br>
have duality with each other.<br>
[161]	It is possible to secure the time and/or spatial diversity gain by the use of the<br>
remapped data symbols. A receiver can swap the positions relative to the soft-decision<br>
bit output from a demapper by the use of the arrangement method at the time of<br>
transmission and can perform the final decoding. Since conventional receivers such as<br>
linear receivers can be used without any change, additional complexity is not required.<br>
[162]<br>
[163]	in. HARQ for Single Codeword<br>
[164]	FIG. 15 is a block diagram illustrating a communication system according to an<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
[165]	Referring to FIG. 15, a communication system includes a transmitter 100 and a<br>
receiver 200. The communication system can support an HARQ (Hybrid Automatic<br>
Repeat Request). Here, the transmitter 100 and the receiver 200 may be transceivers<br>
having both a transmitting function and a receiving function. However, in order to<br>
clarify the description of data re-transmission, one transceiver taking charge of data<br>
transmission and/or re-transmission is referred to as the transmitter 100 and the other<br>
transceiver receiving data and requesting for re-transmission is referred to as the<br>
receiver 200.<br>
[166]	The transmitter 100 includes one channel encoder 110 and one adaptive mapper 120<br>
and thus can process one codeword at a time, which is referred to as a single codeword<br>
(SCW) scheme.<br>
[167]	The transmitter 100 includes a channel encoder 110, an adaptive mapper 120, a<br>
spatial encoder 130, a controller 150, and a receiving circuit 180. The transmitter 100<br>
further includes Nt (where Nt&gt;l) transmit antennas 190-1,..., 190-Nt.<br>
[168]	The channel encoder 110 receives and encodes a series of information bits by the<br>
use of a predetermined coding method to form coded data.<br>
[169]	The adaptive mapper 120 modulates the coded data by the use of a predetermined<br><br>
modulation scheme to provide data symbols. The adaptive mapper 120 maps the coded<br>
data onto data symbols representing positions on a signal constellation. The adaptive<br>
mapper 120 can adaptively map the coded data in response to a re-transmission request<br>
signal from the controller 150. The modulation scheme performed by the adaptive<br>
mapper 120 is not limited, and may be an m-PSK (m-Phase Shift Keying) scheme or<br>
an m-QAM (m-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) scheme. The m-QAM may be one<br>
of 16-QAM, 64-QAM, and 256-QAM. An operation of the adaptive mapper 120 will<br>
be described later along with a data transmission method.<br>
[170]	The spatial encoder 130 processes the data symbols output from the adaptive<br>
mapper 120 by the use of the MIMO pre-processing method. The modulators 140-1,<br>
..., 140-Nt modulate the symbols output from the spatial encoder 130 and transmits the<br>
modulated symbols through the transmit antennas 190-1, ..., 190-Nt. A set of symbols<br>
output from the modulators 140-1, ..., 140-Nt and transmitted during a period (or in<br>
one time slot) is referred to as a transmission symbol. In the OFDM system, the<br>
modulators 140-1,..., 140-Nt can perform the IFFT (Inverse Fast Fourier Transform)<br>
process. In this case, one data symbol is loaded in to one subcarrier and the<br>
transmission symbol transmitted by the plural carrier waves includes the plural data<br>
symbols. In the OFDM system, the transmission symbol is an OFDM symbol.<br>
[171]	The receiving circuit 180 receives the signals transmitted from the receiver 200<br>
through the transmit antennas (190-1,..., 190-Nt). The receiving circuit 180 digitalizes<br>
the received signals and sends the digitalized signals to the controller 150.<br>
[172]	The controller 150 controls the entire operations of the transmitter 100. The<br>
controller 150 extracts information from the signals received by the receiving circuit<br>
180. The operation of extracting the information includes usual demodulating and<br>
decoding operations. The extracted information can include a re-transmission request<br>
signal. The controller 150 controls the adaptive mapper 120 to prepare a re-<br>
transmission symbol in response to the re-transmission request signal.<br>
[173]	The information extracted from the signals received by the receiving circuit 180<br>
includes CQU (Channel Quality Information). The CQI may be information on a<br>
channel environment from the receiver 200 to the transmitter 100 or may be index in-<br>
formation on the modulation and coding scheme. By the use of the CQI, the controller<br>
150 controls the channel encoder 110 or the adaptive mapper 120 to adaptively change<br>
a coding scheme of the channel encoder 110 or a mapping scheme of the adaptive<br>
mapper 120.<br>
[174]	On the other hand, the receiver 200 includes a spatial decoder 220, a demapper<br>
2320, a channel decoder 250, an error detector 260, a controller 270, and a transmitting<br>
circuit 280. The receiver 200 further includes Nr (where Nr&gt;l) receiving antennas<br>
290-1, ...,290-Nr.<br><br>
[175]	The signals received by the receiving antennas 290-1, ..., 290-Nr are demodulated<br>
by the demodulators 210-1,..., 210-Nr and are input to the spatial decoder 220. The<br>
spatial decoder 220 processes the demodulated signals by the use of an MIMO post-<br>
processing method in response to the MIMO control signal sent from the controller<br>
270. The MIMO control signal controls the decoding process on the basis of the space-<br>
time coding scheme of the receiver 100. The MIMO control signal can be set in<br>
advance in a memory (not shown) of the controller 270. Alternatively, the MIMO<br>
control signal may be received from the transmitter 100.<br>
[176]	The demapper 230 demaps the data symbols onto coded data in accordance with a<br>
demapping signal from the controller 270. The demapping control signal used to<br>
control the demapper 230 on the basis of the mapping scheme of the adaptive mapper<br>
120 of the transmitter 100. The demapping control signal can be set in advance in the<br>
memory of the controller 270. Alternatively, the demapping control signal may be<br>
received from the transmitter 100.<br>
[177]	The receiver 200 includes a combiner 240 that combines the re-transmitted symbols<br>
with the previous symbols. That is, in an HARQ system with a chase combining<br>
scheme or an incremental redundancy (IR) scheme, the combiner 240 combines the<br>
previous symbols with the re-transmitted symbols. As the combining method, an<br>
equal-gain combining method of weighting the previous data and the re-transmitted<br>
data in the same way and combining them by the use of their average values may be<br>
used. Alternatively, a maximal ratio combining (MRC) method of weighting the data<br>
in the different ways may be used. The combining method is not limited and a variety<br>
of methods may be used.<br>
[178]	However, this general inventive concept is not limited to the chase combining<br>
scheme or the IR scheme, but may be applied to the HARQ system for performing the<br>
channel decoding process by the use of only the re-transmitted symbols without being<br>
combined with the previous symbols. In this case, the combiner 240 may be omitted<br>
from the receiver 200, as indicated by a dotted line in the figure.<br>
[179]	The channel decoder 250 decodes the coded data by the use of the predetermined<br>
decoding method. The error detector 260 detects whether any error exists in the<br>
decoded data bits by the use of a cyclic redundancy checking (CRC) process.<br>
[180]	The controller 270 controls the entire operations of the receiver 200 and sends the<br>
re-transmission request signal to the transmitting circuit 280. Accordingly, the<br>
controller 270 can perform a general channel encoding process, a modulation process,<br>
and the like. The controller 270 receives the detection result from the error detector<br>
260 and determines whether the re-transmission of the symbols should be requested<br>
for. The controller 270 generates a positive acknowledgement (ACK) signal when no<br>
error is detected, and generates a negative acknowledgement (NACK) signal when an<br><br>
error is detected. The NACK signal may serve as a re-transmission request signal.<br>
[181]	The controller 270 measures the channel quality from the received signals and<br>
sends a CQI signal. A feedback signal such as a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or a bit<br>
error rate associated with the channel quality is fed back to the transmitter 100. In<br>
order to measure the channel quality, the transmission symbol transmitted from the<br>
transmitter 100 may further include a pilot symbol. The transmitting circuit 280<br>
receives the re-transmission request signal from the controller 270 and transmits the re-<br>
transmission request signal through the receiving antennas 290-1, ..., 290-Nr.<br>
[182]	FIG. 16 is a flowchart illustrating a data transmission method using the com-<br>
munication system shown in FIG. 15.<br>
[183]	It is assumed that the number of transmit antennas is 4 (Nt=4) and Skn denotes the<br>
n-th data symbol re-transmitted through the k-th transmit antenna, {ii ii+1 qi+2 qi+3}<br>
denotes a bit sequence of i to i+3 of the corresponding data symbol. Here, i and q<br>
denote a bit of the data symbol but do not define the order or details. The data symbol<br>
may include a bit sequence representing complex values on a signal constellation and<br>
the number of bits representing the data symbol may be 4 or more bits, or 4 or less bits.<br>
The data symbol is modulated into a transmission symbol by the modulators 140-1,<br>
140-Nt and the transmission symbol is transmitted. In order to clarify the description,<br>
one transmission symbol is assumed to be obtained from one data symbol, but the<br>
transmission symbol may include a group of data symbols.<br>
[184]	Referring to FIG. 16, the transmitter 100 transmits the data symbols S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4 <br>
(S110). The data symbol S is transmitted through the first antenna 190-1, the data<br>
symbol S is transmitted through the second antenna 190-2, the data symbol S is<br>
transmitted through the third antenna 190-3, and the data symbol S4 is transmitted<br>
through the fourth antenna 190-4.<br>
[185]	The receiver 200 performs a channel decoding process on the received data symbols<br>
S1, S2 , S3 , and S4 and checks an error (S120). When no error is detected, the receiver<br>
200 transmits an ACK signal to the transmitter 100 and waits for the transmission of a<br>
next symbol. However, it is assumed that the receiver 200 detects an error and<br>
transmits a NACK signal as the re-transmission request signal (S130).<br>
[186]	When receiving the NACK signal, the transmitter 100 transmits the re-transmission<br>
symbols S11 ,S2 1 ,S3 1 ,and S4 1 (S140). The re-transmission symbol S11 is transmitted<br>
through the first antenna 190-1, the re-transmission symbol S2 1 is transmitted through<br>
the second antenna 190-2, the re-transmission symbol S3 1 is transmitted through the<br>
third antenna 190-3, and the re-transmission symbol S4 1 is transmitted through the<br>
fourth antenna 190-4. When receiving the NACK signal, the controller 150 spatially<br>
remaps the data symbols S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4 by the use of the adaptive mapper 120 to<br>
construct the re-transmission symbols S11 , S2 1 , S3 1 , and S4 1. The spatial remapping<br><br>
method used for the re-transmission may be particularly limited, which will be<br>
described later.<br>
[187]	The receiver 200 performs a space-time decoding process and a channel decoding<br>
process on the received re-transmission symbols S11 , S2 1 , S3 1 , and S4 1 to check an<br>
error (S150). At this time, the combiner 240 can combine the re-transmission symbols<br>
S11 , S2 1 , S3 1 , and S4 1 with the previous symbols S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4 . In a general chase<br>
combining scheme, log-likelihood ratio (LLR) values of the re-transmission symbols<br>
and the LLR values of the previous symbols are added, thereby combining the re-<br>
transmission symbols and the previous symbols with each other.<br>
[188]	The receiver 200 transmits the ACK signal to the transmitter 100 when no error is<br>
detected, and waits for a next symbol. However, it is assumed that the receiver 200<br>
detects an error and transmits the NACK signal as the re-transmission request signal<br>
(S160).<br>
[189]	When receiving the NACK signal, the transmitter 100 transmits again the remapped<br>
re-transmission symbols S12 , S2 2 , S3 2 , and S4 2 (S170). There-transmission symbol S12<br>
is transmitted through the first antenna 190-1, the re-transmission symbol S2 2 is<br>
transmitted through the second antenna 190-2, the re-transmission symbol S3 2 is<br>
transmitted through the third antenna 190-3, and the re-transmission symbol S4 2 is<br>
transmitted through the fourth antenna 190-4. The adaptive mapper 120 spatially<br>
remaps the data symbols S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4 to construct the re-transmission symbols S12 ,<br>
S2 2,S3 2,and S4 2.<br>
[ 190]	The receiver 200 performs a space-time decoding process and a channel decoding<br>
process on the received re-transmission symbols S12 , S2 2 , S3 2 , and S4 2 to check an<br>
error (S180). At this time, the combiner 240 can combine the re-transmission symbols<br>
S12 , S2 2 , S3 2 , and S4 2 with the previous symbols S1 , S2 , S3 ,S4 , S11 , S2 1 , S3 1 ,S4 1.<br>
[191]	The receiver 200 transmits the ACK signal or the NACK signal to the transmitter<br>
100 as the error detection result (S190). When the ACK signal is transmitted, the re-<br>
transmission of the corresponding symbols is ended. The repeat request in response to<br>
the NACK signal can be performed by n times (where n&gt; 1) which is a predetermined<br>
number of times. When an error is detected from the n-th re-transmission, it is possible<br>
to reset the re-transmission process and to start the transmission of the next symbols.<br>
Alternatively, the current symbols may be transmitted completely again.<br>
[192]	The re-transmission symbols are formed by remapping the data symbols S1 , S2 , S3 , <br>
and S4 . The remapping of the data symbols is a remapping on a signal constellation.<br>
The remapping of the data symbols is to rearrange the bits of the data symbols each<br>
other. The rearrangement includes the replacement and/or swapping of the bits.<br>
[ 193]	FIG. 17 is a diagram illustrating the arrangement of the re-transmission symbols<br>
according to an embodiment of the invention.<br><br>
[194]	Referring to FIG. 17, the re-transmission symbol is formed by performing a bit<br>
remapping process on a signal constellation to the data symbols. At the first re-<br>
transmission T2, the re-transmission symbols S11 and S4 1 are constructed by swapping<br>
the bits (i, i) of SI with the bits (i, i) of S4 and rearranging the bits in the symbols.<br>
The re-transmission symbols S2 1 and S 31 are constructed by swapping the bits (q , q )<br>
of S with the bits (q , q ) of S and rearranging the bits in the symbols. That is, the re-<br>
transmission symbols S , S , S , and S are constructed by spatially swapping the<br>
bits of the data symbols S , S , S , and S with each other and rearranging the bits in the<br>
symbols.<br>
[195]	At the second re-transmission T3, the re-transmission symbols S andS are<br>
constructed by swapping the bits (q , q ) of S with the bits (q , q ) of S and re-<br>
arranging the bits in the symbols. The re-transmission symbols S and S are<br>
constructed by swapping the bits (q , q ) of S with the bits (q , q ) of S and re-<br>
arranging the bits in the symbols. That is, the re-transmission symbols S , S , S ",<br>
and S are constructed by spatially swapping the bits of the data symbols S , S , S ,<br>
and S with each other and rearranging the bits in the symbols.<br>
4<br>
[ 196]	The number of bits to be spatially swapped is exemplified as two, but the number of<br>
bits to be swapped is not limited. One bit may be swapped or three or more bits may be<br>
swapped.<br>
[197]	The bits of the data symbols are spatially swapped with each other at the first re-<br>
transmission T2, and the bits of the data symbols are newly spatially swapped with<br>
each other and retransmitted at the second re-transmission T3. It is possible to obtain<br>
an additional diversity gain by the swapping of the bits of the data symbols.<br>
[198]	Although the second re-transmission has been described, re-transmission symbols<br>
obtained by spatially remapping the data symbols can be re-transmitted at the third or<br>
subsequent re-transmission.<br>
[199]	FIG. 18 is a diagram illustrating an arrangement of re-transmission symbols<br>
according to another embodiment of the invention.<br>
[200]	Referring to FIG. 18, the re-transmission symbols S ,S ,S ,and S are<br>
constructed by spatially swapping the bits of the data symbols S , S , S , and S with<br>
each other and rearranging the bits in the symbols, at the first re-transmission T2.<br>
[201]	At the second re-transmission T3, the bits in the data symbols S , S , S , and S can<br>
be swapped with each other. That is, the re-transmission symbols S , S , S ", and S<br>
are constructed by swapping the bits of the data symbols S , S , S , and S with each<br>
other and replacing the LSB (Least Significant Bit) and the MSB (Most Significant<br>
Bit) with their complements. The replacement is not limited to the LSB and the MSB,<br>
but the replacement with complements may be performed independent of the LSB and<br>
the MSB. Alternatively, the intermediate bits may be replaced with the complements.<br><br>
[202]	At the first re-transmission T2, the data symbols are spatially swapped with each<br>
other and then are re-transmitted. At the second re-transmission T3, the data symbols<br>
are spatially replaced and then are re-transmitted. It is possible to obtain an additional<br>
diversity gain by remapping the data symbols.<br>
[203]	FIG. 19 is a diagram illustrating an arrangement of the re-transmission symbols<br>
according to another embodiment of the invention.<br>
[204]	Referring to FIG. 19, at the first re-transmission T2, the re-transmission symbols S<br>
 S ', S , and S are constructed by remapping the data symbols S , S , S , and S .<br>
That is, the re-transmission symbols S ',S \ S ',and S ' are constructed by spatially<br>
swapping the bits in the data symbols S , S , S , and S with each other, rearranging the<br>
bits, and then replacing the LSB and the MSB with their complements.<br>
2	2	2<br>
[205]	At the second re-transmission T3, the re-transmission symbols S , S , S , and S<br>
12	3	4<br>
are constructed by spatially swapping the bits in the data symbols S , S , S , and S<br>
with each other, rearranging the bits, and then replacing the intermediate bits with their<br>
2	2	2	2<br>
complements. That is, the new re-transmission symbols S , S , S , and S are<br>
constructed by replacing the bits other than the replaced bits of the first re-transmission<br>
symbols S ', S ', S \ and S with their complements. The data symbols are spatially<br>
replaced and re-transmitted at the first re-transmission T2, and the data symbols are<br>
newly spatially replaced and re-transmitted at the second re-transmission T3.<br>
[206]	FIG. 20 is a diagram illustrating an arrangement of the re-transmission symbols<br>
according to another embodiment of the invention.<br>
[207]	Referring to FIG. 20, at the first re-transmission T2, the re-transmission symbols S<br>
, S , S , and S are constructed by spatially swapping the bits in the data symbols S<br>
, S , S . and S with each other, rearranging the bits, and then replacing the LSB and<br>
the MSB with their complements.<br>
[208]	At the second re-transmission T3, the bits of the data symbols are swapped with<br>
each other. That is, the second re-transmission symbols S 2, S 2, S 2, and S 2 are<br>
12	3	4<br>
constructed by spatially swapping the bits of the data symbols S , S , S , and S and re-<br>
arranging the positions of the bits.<br>
[209]	At the first re-transmission T2, the data symbols are spatially swapped with each<br>
other and then are re-transmitted. At the second re-transmission T3, the data symbols<br>
are spatially replaced and then are re-transmitted. It is possible to obtain an additional<br>
diversity gain by remapping the data symbols using the swapping and replacement.<br>
[210]	FIG. 21 is a diagram illustrating an arrangement of the re-transmission symbols<br>
according to another embodiment of the invention.<br>
[211]	Referring to FIG. 21, the re-trans mission symbols are constructed by swapping the<br>
data symbols with each other. The re-transmission symbols S ' and S are<br>
constructed by swapping the bits (i, i) of S with the bits (i, i) of S . The bits (q , q )<br><br>
and (i, i) of the re-transmission symbol S ' are crossed each other. The bits (q , q )<br>
and (i, i ) of the re-transmission symbol S ' are crossed each other. The re-<br>
transmission symbols S ' and S 'are constructed by swapping the bits (i;, y of S3 <br>
with the bits (i, i) of S . The bits (q , q ) and (i, i) of the re-transmission symbol S '<br>
784	5678	j-&gt;<br>
are crossed each other. The bits (q , q ) and (i, i ) of the re-transmission symbol S4 <br>
are crossed each other.<br>
[212]	The bit rearrangement of the data symbols may be performed in various methods.<br>
The re-transmission symbols can be constructed by remapping the data symbols<br>
spatially, temporally, or by subcarriers. The re-transmission symbols may be remapped<br>
every re-transmission. Alternatively, the remapping may be performed for only one re-<br>
transmission. A different remapping method or the same remapping method may be<br>
used for each remapping.<br>
[213]	The criterion for determining the remapping method is not limited. For example, the<br>
controller 150 may determined the remapping method in an open loop scheme,<br>
properly depending on the situations. The maximum Doppler frequency, the delay<br>
spread, and the like can be considered as variables for determining the remapping<br>
method. In another example, the controller 150 may receive the CQI signal and may<br>
determine the remapping method, depending on the channel quality fed back in the<br>
closed loop scheme.<br>
[214]	Since the re-transmission symbols are constructed by remapping the data symbols,<br>
such a case is called a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) system of Type I or a<br>
chase combining scheme in which the entire symbols are re-transmitted. However, the<br>
technical spirit of the invention can be applied to the HARQ system of the IR scheme.<br>
That is, in the IR scheme, the entire symbols are not re-transmitted, but only redundant<br>
symbols are re-transmitted. In this case, by spatially remapping and then transmitting<br>
the redundant symbols, it is possible to secure the additional re-transmission gain.<br>
[215]	FIG. 22 is a diagram illustrating a data transmission method according to another<br>
embodiment of the invention. This is the HARQ scheme using the STBC. It is assumed<br>
that the number of transmit antennas is 2 (Nt=2) and the data symbols are S and S for<br>
1	2<br>
the respective antennas.<br>
[216]	Referring to FIG. 22, first, the data symbol S is transmitted through the first<br>
antenna 190-1 and the data symbol S is transmitted through the second antenna 190-2.<br>
[217]	When an error is detected from the transmission symbols and thus the NACK signal<br>
is transmitted, re-transmission symbol -S * is transmitted through the first antenna<br>
190-1 and re-transmission symbol S * is transmitted through the second antenna 190-2,<br>
at the first re-transmission T2.<br>
[218]	When an error is detected from the re-transmission symbols and the NACK signal is<br>
transmitted, re-transmission symbols S ' and S ' are constructed by remapping the data<br><br>
symbols S and S , at the second re-transmission T3. At the second re-transmission T3,<br><br>
the re-transmission symbol S ' is transmitted through the first antenna 190-1 and the re-<br>
transmission symbol S ' is transmitted through the second antenna 190-2.<br>
[219]	When an error is detected again and the NACK signal is transmitted, new re-<br>
transmission symbols S '* and S '* are constructed by remapping the re-transmission<br>
symbols S * and -S \ at the third re-transmission T4. At the third re-transmission T4,<br>
the re-transmission symbol -S ' is transmitted through the first antenna 190-1 and the<br>
re-transmission symbol S '* is transmitted through the second antenna 190-2.<br>
[220]	Here, the system having two antennas has been described, but the technical spirit of<br>
the invention can be applied to a system having three or more antennas without any<br>
change. The technical spirit of the invention can be applied to a space-time trellis code<br>
system as well as the STBC system.<br>
[221]	FIG. 23 is a graph illustrating a simulation result by SNR VS. BER (Bit Error Rate)<br>
and FIG. 24 is a graph illustrating a simulation result by SNR VS. FER (Frame Error<br>
Rate). For the purpose of the simulation, the chase combining scheme is used as the re-<br>
transmission scheme in the 3GPP downlink and 16-QAM scheme and a 1/2 turbo code<br>
system are used. It is assumed that the number of antennas is 2 and a user speed is 100<br>
km/h.<br>
[222]	Referring to FIGs. 23 and 24, it can be seen that the advantage of the invention is<br>
more excellent in the channel environment having high mobility than the conventional<br>
art.<br>
[223]	FIG. 25 is a graph illustrating a simulation result by SNR VS. BER and FIG. 26 is a<br>
graph illustrating a simulation result by SNR VS. FER. In FIGs. 25 and 26, it is<br>
assumed that the user speeds are 30 km/h and 150 km/h, unlike FIGs. 23 and 24.<br>
[224]	Referring to FIGs. 25 and 26, it can be seen that the advantage of the invention is<br>
more excellent than that of the conventional art and the performance is more improved<br>
with an increase in moving speed.<br>
[225]	Even in the environment having high mobility, that is, in the channel having high<br>
time selectivity, it is possible to prevent the deterioration of data by compensating for<br>
the diversity gain.<br>
[226]	FIG. 27 is a block diagram illustrating a transmitter according to an embodiment of<br>
the invention. In this case, an HARQ system using a cyclic delay diversity technique<br>
can be used.<br>
[227]	Referring to FIG. 27, a transmitter 300 includes a channel encoder 310, an adaptive<br>
mapper 320, a spatial encoder 330, a controller 350, and a receiving circuit 380. The<br>
transmitter 300 further includes IFFT units 340-1,..., 340-Nt as the OFDM<br>
modulators.<br>
[228]	Information bits become data symbols while passing through the channel encoder<br><br>
310 and the adaptive mapper 320. The data symbols pass through the spatial encoder<br>
330 and are converted into transmission symbols by the IFFT process of the IFFT units<br>
340-1,..., 340-Nt. A CP (Cyclic Prefix) is inserted into the transmission symbols by<br>
the CP insertion units 345-1, ..., 345-Nt and the transmission symbols are transmitted<br>
through the transmit antennas 390-1, ..., 390-Nt. The delay units 370-1,..., 370-(Nt-l)<br>
are disposed between the IFFT units 340-1,..., 340-Nt and the CP insertion units<br>
345-1,..., 345-Nt, and cyclically delay the transmission symbols.<br>
[229]	The transmitter 300 is different from the transmitter 100 shown in FIG. 15, in that<br>
the delay units 370-1, ..., 370-(Nt-l) are added between the modulators 340-1,<br>
340-Nt and the transmit antennas 390-1, ..., 390-Nt. The other operation is equal to<br>
those of the example shown in FIG. 15.<br>
[230]	The delay units 370-1, ..., 370-(Nt-1) cyclically delay the transmission symbols<br>
transmitted through the transmit antennas 390-1, ..., 390-Nt. The delay times Dl, ...,<br>
DNt-1 delayed by the delay units 370-1, ..., 370-(Nt-l) may be different depending on<br>
the users and can be adjusted by receiving the corresponding information from the<br>
receiver in a feedback manner.<br>
[231]	FIG. 28 is a diagram illustrating the re-trans mission symbols used in the transmitter<br>
of FIG. 27.<br>
[232]	Referring to FIG. 28, at the first time Tl, a data symbol S is modulated into the<br>
transmission symbol and the transmission symbol is cyclically delayed and repeatedly<br>
transmitted through all the transmit antennas 390-1, ..., 390-Nt. When an error is<br>
detected from the transmitted symbols and the NACK signal is transmitted, a re-<br>
transmission symbol S is constructed by remapping the data symbol S by the use of<br>
the adaptive mapper 320 at the first re-transmission T2. The re-transmission symbol S<br>
is modulated to a transmission symbol and the transmission symbol is cyclically<br>
delayed and transmitted through the transmit antennas 390-1, ..., 390-Nt.<br>
[233]	When an error is detected from the re-transmission symbol S and the NACK<br>
signal is transmitted, the re-transmission symbol S remapped by the adaptive mapper<br>
320 is cyclically delayed and transmitted through all the transmit antennas 390-1, ...,<br>
390-Nt at the second re-transmission T3.<br>
[234]	In another example, the delay units 370-1,..., 370-(Nt-l) and the CP insertion units<br>
345-1, ..., 345-Nt are replaced in position with each other. That is, the CP can be<br>
inserted after the symbols are delayed, or the symbols may be delayed after the CP is<br>
inserted.<br>
[235]	FIG. 29 is a block diagram illustrating a transmitter according to another<br>
embodiment of the invention. In the transmitter 400, the delay units of the transmitter<br>
300 of FIG. 27 are shifted to the frequency domain.<br>
[236]	Referring to FIG. 29, phase delay units 470-1, ..., 470-(Nt-l) are disposed between<br><br>
the spatial encoder 430 and the IFFT units 440-1,..., 440-Nt and serve to cyclically<br>
delay the phases of the symbols. The phase delay units 470-1,..., 470-(Nt-l) in the<br>
frequency domain are equivalent to the delay unit 370-1,..., 370-(Nt-l) in the time<br>
domain of the transmitter 300 shown in FIG. 27. The time delay in the time domain<br>
and the phase delay in the frequency domain have duality with each other.<br>
[237]	FIG. 30 is a diagram illustrating a transmitter and re-transmission symbols<br>
according to an embodiment of the invention.<br>
[238]	Referring to FIG. 30, a transmitter 500 includes a channel encoder 510, an adaptive<br>
mapper 520, a modulator 530, a controller 550, and a receiving circuit 560. The<br>
transmitter 500 includes one antenna 590.<br>
[239]	The data symbols output from the adaptive mapper 520 are modulated into<br>
transmission symbols by the modulator 530. Accordingly, the transmission symbols<br>
can include plural data symbols. In this case, one transmission symbol constitutes one<br>
packet. Here, three data symbols S , S , and S^ are included in one transmission<br>
symbol. However, this is only an example, and plural data symbols may be included in<br>
one transmission symbol, depending on the number of subcarriers.<br>
[240]	The operation of the transmitter 500 is as follows. First, three data symbols S , S ,<br>
and S are transmitted at the first transmission Tl. When an error is detected from the<br>
3<br>
transmitted symbols and the NACK signal is transmitted, the re-transmission symbols<br>
S , S , and S remapped by the adaptive mapper 520 are transmitted at the first re-<br>
transmission T2. The re-transmission symbols can be constructed by remapping the<br>
three data symbols. When an error is detected from the re-transmission symbols and<br>
the NACK signal is transmitted, the re-transmission symbols S 2, S , and S<br>
12	3<br>
remapped by the adaptive mapper 520 are transmitted at the second re-transmission<br>
T3. The new re-transmission symbols can be constructed by remapping the three data<br>
symbols.<br>
[241]	The diversity is embodied by remapping the data symbols. The remapping process<br>
includes the rearrangement of the bits of two or more data symbols different from each<br>
other. This process includes the rearrangement of the data symbols transmitted through<br>
one time slot, as well as temporally and spatially.<br>
[242]	It is possible to secure an additional diversity gain while obtaining the space-time<br>
diversity gain from the corresponding channel by the use of the adaptive mapper<br>
without an increase in complexity. The invention can be applied without changing the<br>
structure of the known receiver. By transmitting the symbols temporally remapped at<br>
the time of re-transmission, it is possible to additionally secure the diversity gain,<br>
thereby minimizing the repeat request and enhancing the communication quality.<br>

[245]	FIG. 31 is a block diagram illustrating a communication system according to an<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
[246]	Referring to FIG. 31, a communication system includes a transmitter 600 and a<br>
receiver 700. The transmitter 600 N (where N&gt;1) channel encoders 610-1,..., 610-N,<br>
N adaptive mappers 620-1,..., 620-N, a spatial encoder 630, a controller 650, and a<br>
receiving circuit 680. The transmitter 650 includes Nt (where Nt&gt;l) transmit antennas<br>
190-1,..., 190-Nt. A technique of processing various codewords different in coding<br>
rate and coding scheme from each other by the use of the plural channel encoders<br>
610-1,..., 610-N and the adaptive mappers 620-1,..., 620-N is called a multi<br>
codeword (MCW) technique.<br>
[247]	The channel encoders 610-1,..., 610-N receive N information bits different from<br>
each other in parallel and encode the information bits in accordance with a pre-<br>
determined coding method to form coded data. The coded data are the codewords. The<br>
coding methods applied to the information bits are independent of each other and<br>
different coding methods can be applied thereto.<br>
[248]	The adaptive mappers 620-1,..., 620-N modulate the coded data of the information<br>
bit streams by the use of the predetermined modulation scheme to provide data<br>
symbols. The coded data are mapped to the symbols representing amplitudes and<br>
positions in a phase constellation by the adaptive mappers 620-1,..., 620-N. The<br>
adaptive mappers 620-1,..., 620-N can adaptively modulate the coded data in response<br>
to the re-transmission request signal from the controller 650.<br>
[249]	The spatial encoder 630 process the plural data symbols by the use of the space-<br>
time coding scheme so as to transmit the data symbols through plural transmit antennas<br>
690-1, ...,690-N.<br>
[250]	The modulators 640-1,..., 640-N modulate the symbols output from the spatial<br>
encoder 130 by the use of the multiple access modulation scheme and transmit the<br>
modulated symbols through the transmit antennas 690-1, ..., 690-N. The receiving<br>
circuit 680 receives the signals from the receiver 700 through the transmit antennas<br>
690-1,..., 690-N. The controller 650 controls the whole operation of the transmitter<br>
600. The controller 650 sends the re-transmission request signal transmitted from the<br>
receiving circuit 680 to the adaptive mappers 620-1,..., 620-N so as to prepare the re-<br>
transmission symbols. The information extracted from the signals received from the<br>
receiving circuit 680 includes the CQI. The controller 650 can adaptively change the<br>
coding method of the channel encoders 610-1,..., 610-N and the mapping method of<br>
the adaptive mappers 620-1, ..., 620-N by the use of the CQI.<br>
[251]	On the other hand, the receiver 700 includes a spatial decoder 720, demappers<br>
730-1,..., 730-M, channel decoders 750-1,..., 750-M, error detectors 760-1,...,<br>
760-M, a controller 770, and a transmitting circuit 780. The receiver 200 includes Mt<br><br>
(where Mt&gt;l) antennas 790-1, ..., 790-Mt.<br>
[252]	The signals received through the antennas 790-1, ..., 790-Mt are demodulated by<br>
the demodulators 710-1, ...,710-M and are input to the spatial decoder 720. The<br>
spatial decoder 720 reconstructs the transmission symbols in accordance with a<br>
decoding control signal from the controller 770. The demappers 730-1,..., 730-M<br>
demap the modulated symbols onto the coded data in accordance with a demapping<br>
control signal from the controller 70. The receiver 700 further includes combiners<br>
740-1,..., 740-M that combine the re-transmitted symbols with the previous symbols.<br>
As indicated by the dotted line, the combiners 740-1,..., 740-M may be omitted from<br>
the receiver 200 that performs the channel decoding process by the use of only the re-<br>
transmitted symbols without combination with the previous symbols.<br>
[253]	The channel decoders 7 5 0-1, ..., 7 50-M decode the coded data by the use of the<br>
predetermined decoding method. The error detectors 760-1,..., 760-M detect whether<br>
an error exists in the decoded data bits by the CRC check. The controller 770 controls<br>
the whole operation of the receiver 700 and sends the re-transmission request signal<br>
and the like to the transmitting circuit 780. The controller 770 receives the error<br>
detection result from the error detectors 760-1, 760-M and determines whether the re-<br>
transmission should be requested for. When an error is not detected, the controller 770<br>
generates the ACK signal and when an error is detected, the controller 770 generates<br>
the NACK signal. The ACK signal or the NACK signal serves as the re-transmission<br>
request signal. The transmitting circuit 780 receives the re-transmission request signal<br>
from the controller 770 and transmits the antennas 790-1,..., 790-M.<br>
[254]	It is assumed that the number of transmit antennas is 2 (N=2) and the data symbols<br>
are S and S for the respective antennas. In addition, in another example including<br>
four transmit antennas, it is assumed that the data symbols are S , S , S , and S . The<br>
subscripts of the data symbols S , S , S , and S denote the transmit antenna and<br>
the superscripts denote the numbers of times of re-transmission. It is assumed for the<br>
purpose of easy description that the transmission is performed symbol by symbol, but<br>
may be performed in the unit of symbol group. Alternatively, the transmission may be<br>
performed in the unit of the whole data block or a part thereof, or in the unit of the<br>
whole data packet or a part thereof.<br>
[255]	FIG. 32 is a flowchart illustrating an HARQ method using the communication<br>
system of FIG. 31.<br>
[256]	Referring to FIG. 32, the transmitter 600 transmits S and S (, S , S ) (S610). The<br>
symbol S is transmitted through the first antenna 690-1 and the symbol S is<br>
transmitted through the second antenna 690-2. When the number of antennas is 4, the<br>
symbol S is transmitted through the third antenna 690-3 and the symbol S is<br>
transmitted through the fourth antenna 690-4.<br><br>
[257]	The receiver 700 performs the space-time decoding process on the received<br>
symbols S1 and S2 (, S3 , S4 ) and performs the channel decoding process thereon to<br>
check an error (S620). When no error is detected, the receiver 700 transmits the ACK<br>
signal to the transmitter 600 and waits for the transmission of next transmission<br>
symbols. However, it is assumed here that the receiver 700 detects an error and<br>
transmits the NACK signal as the re-transmission request signal (S630).<br>
[258]	When receiving the NACK signal, the transmitter 600 transmits the re-transmission<br>
symbols S11 and S2 1 (, S3 1 , S4 1 ) (S640). The re-transmission symbol S is transmitted<br>
through the first antenna 690-1 and the re-transmission symbol S2 1 is transmitted<br>
through the second antenna 690-2. When the number of antennas is 4, the re-<br>
transmission symbol S3 1 is transmitted through the third antenna 690-3 and the re-<br>
transmission symbol S4 1 is transmitted through the fourth antenna 690-4. When<br>
receiving the NACK signal, the controller 650 constructs the re-transmission symbols<br>
S11 and S2 1 (, S3 1 , S4 1') by spatially remapping the data symbols S11 and S2 1 (, S3 1 , S4 1<br>
) by the use of the adaptive mappers 620-1,..., 620-N. Various methods can be used<br>
as the spatial remapping method used at the time of re-transmission and will be<br>
described later.<br>
[259]	The receiver 700 performs the space-time decoding process on the received re-<br>
transmission symbols S11 and S2 1 (, S3 1 , S4 1) and performs the channel decoding<br>
process thereon to check an error (S650). When no error is detected, the receiver 700<br>
transmits the ACK signal to the transmitter 600 and waits for the transmission of next<br>
transmission symbols. However, it is assumed here that the receiver 700 detects an<br>
error and transmits the NACK signal as the re-transmission request signal (S660).<br>
[260]	When receiving the NACK signal, the transmitter 600 transmits the re-transmission<br>
symbols S1 2 and S2 2 (, S3 2 , S4 2 ) (S770). The re-transmission symbol S is transmitted<br>
through the first antenna 690-1 and the re-transmission symbol S is transmitted<br>
through the second antenna 690-2. When the number of antennas is 4, the re-<br>
transmission symbol S is transmitted through the third antenna 690-3 and the re-<br>
transmission symbol S is transmitted through the fourth antenna 690-4. The adaptive<br><br>
mappers 620-1, ..., 620-N constructs the re-transmission symbols S11 and S2 1 (, S3 1 , S4 1<br>
) by spatially remapping the data symbols S1 and S2 (, S3 , S4 ).<br>
[261]	The receiver 700 performs the space-time decoding process on the received re-<br>
transmission symbols S12 and S2 2 and performs the channel decoding process thereon<br>
to check an error (S680).<br>
[262]	The receiver 700 transmits the ACK signal or the NACK signal to the transmitter<br>
600 in accordance with the error detection result (S690). When the ACK signal is<br>
transmitted, the re-transmission of the corresponding symbols is ended. The repeat<br>
request using the NACK signal can be performed up to a predetermined number of<br><br>
times, which is n (where n&gt;l). When an error is detected from the n-th re-transmission,<br>
the re-transmission process is reset and the transmission of next symbols can be<br>
started. Alternatively, the transmission of the current symbols can be started again.<br>
[263]	For clarity, it is assumed that the data symbols in case of two transmit antennas are<br>
S1 ={a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 } and S2 ={b1 , b2 , b3 , b4 , b5 , b6 } and the additional transmission symbols<br>
in case of four transmit antennas are S3 ={c1 , c2 } and S4 ={d1 , d2 , d3, d4 }. Here, a, b, c,<br>
and d denote bit data constituting the transmission symbols and the subscript represents<br>
any bit data, but does not define the order or details. The data symbols are modulated<br>
symbols modulated by the use of the rn-PSK or m-QAM. The data symbols S1 , S2 , S3 <br>
and S4 include four bit data, but they are only an example and the number of bit data<br>
included in the transmission symbol can be changed variously.<br>
[264]	The re-transmission symbols are constructed by remapping the data bits of the data<br>
symbols S and S or the data bits of the data symbols S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4 . Since the<br>
transmission symbols are the modulated symbols, the remapping of the bit data of the<br>
transmission symbols can be said to be the remapping on a signal constellation. The<br>
remapping of the bit data can include the swapping or replacement of the bit data.<br>
Hereinafter, the remapping in the unit of bit is described, but the remapping may be<br>
performed in the unit of symbol in the packet transmission of transmitting plural<br>
symbols.<br>
[265]	FIG. 33 is a diagram illustrating an arrangement of the re-transmission symbols for<br>
two transmit antennas and FIG. 34 is a diagram illustrating an arrangement of the re-<br>
transmission symbols for four transmit antennas. The re-transmission symbols can be<br>
constructed by swapping the bit data of the transmission symbols with each other.<br>
[266]	Referring to FIG. 33, at the first re-transmission T2 subsequent to the first<br>
transmission Tl, the re-transmission symbols S ' and S are constructed by swapping<br>
the bit data (a , a ) of S and the bit data (b , b ) of S with each other and rearranging<br>
the bit data in the respective symbols.<br>
[267]	Referring to FIG. 34, at the first re-transmission T2 subsequent to the first<br>
transmission Tl, the re-transmission symbols S11 and S2 1 are constructed by swapping<br>
the bit data (a1 , a4 ) of S1 and the bit data (b1 , b6 ) of S2 with each other and rearranging<br>
the bit data in the respective symbols. The re-transmission symbols S and S are<br>
constructed by swapping the bit data (c ) of S and the bit data (a ) of S with each<br>
other and rearranging the bit data in the respective symbols. That is, the re-<br>
transmission symbols S11 , S2 1 , S3 1 , and S4 1 are constructed by spatially swapping the<br>
bit data of the data symbols S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4 with each other and rearranging the bit<br>
data in the symbols.<br>
[268]	Specifically, at the second re-transmission T3, the re-transmission symbols S12 and<br>
S3 2 are constructed by swapping the bit data (a4 ) of S1 and the bit data (c2) of S3 with<br><br>
each other. The re-transmission symbols S2 2 and S4 2 are constructed by swapping the<br>
bit data (b1 , b4 ) of S2 and the bit data (d2 , d3 ) of S4 with each other. That is, the re-<br>
transmission symbols S12, S2 2, S3 2, and S4 2 can be constructed by spatially swapping<br>
the bit data of the data symbols S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4 with each other.<br>
[269]	The number of bit data spatially swapped with each other can be set equal to or<br>
smaller than (the number of bits/2) of the symbol having the smaller number of bits of<br>
two symbols to be swapped. This is intended to secure the minimum spatial diversity<br>
for the data transmitted by the use of the respective symbols. However, the number of<br>
bits is not limited thereto, and the number of bit data to be swapped and the order or<br>
method for the swapping is not limited.<br>
[2701	At the first re-transmission T2, the bit data of the data symbols are spatially<br>
swapped with each other and then are re-transmitted. At the second re-transmission T3,<br>
the bit data of the data symbols are newly spatially swapped with each other and then<br>
are re-transmitted. It is possible to obtain the diversity gain by swapping the bit data of<br>
the data symbols. Although the second re-transmission has been described here, the re-<br>
transmission symbols which are obtained by spatially remapping the data symbols can<br>
be re-transmitted at the third or subsequent re-transmission.<br>
[271]	FIG. 35 is a diagram illustrating an arrangement of the re-transmission symbols for<br>
two transmit antennas and FIG. 36 is a diagram illustrating an arrangement of the re-<br>
transmission symbols for four transmit antennas.<br>
[272]	Referring to FIG. 35, at the first re-transmission T2, the re-transmission symbols S<br>
and S are constructed by spatially swapping the bit data of the data symbols S and<br>
S2 and rearranging the bit data in the symbols, similarly to the re-transmission symbols<br>
at the first transmission shown in FIG. 33.<br>
[273]	At the second re-transmission T3, the bit data of the data symbols S and S can be<br>
replaced with their complements. That is, the re-transmission symbols S 2 and S 2 are<br>
constructed by swapping the bit data of the data symbols S and S with each other and<br>
then replacing the LSB and the MSB with their complements.<br>
[274]	Referring to FIG. 36, at the first re-transmission T2, the re-transmission symbols S<br>
S11 , S2 1 , S3 1 , and S4 1 are constructed by spatially swapping the bit data of the data<br>
symbols S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4 with each other and rearranging the bit data in the symbols,<br>
similarly to the re-transmission symbols at the first transmission shown in FIG. 34. At<br>
the second re-transmission T3, the LSB and the MSB of the data symbols S1 , S2 , S3 , and <br>
S4 can be replaced wim their complements.<br>
[275]	The replacement of the bit data is not limited to the LSB and the MSB, but the re-<br>
placement with complements may be performed independent of the LSB and the MSB.<br>
Alternatively, the bit data of predetermined positions may be replaced with their<br>
complements.<br><br>
[276]	Generally, the LSB and the MSB are set in the indication data such as the TFCI in-<br>
formation and the CQI information and the LSB and the MSB can be defined in<br>
different ways, depending on the mapping schemes used in the communication system.<br>
The bit strongest against the channel variation is the defined as the MSB and the bit<br>
weakest to the channel variation is defined as the LSB. Specifically, at the initial<br>
transmission Tl, a1, b1 , c1 and d1 are defined as the MSB, and a4 , b6 , c2 and d4 are<br>
defined as the LSB.<br>
[277]	It is possible to obtain the diversity gain by the swapping and replacement of the bit<br>
data in the data symbols.<br>
[278]	FIG. 37 is a diagram illustrating an arrangement of the re-transmission symbols for<br>
two transmit antennas and FIG. 38 is a diagram illustrating an arrangement of the re-<br>
transmission symbols for four transmit antennas.<br>
[279]	Referring to FIG. 37, at the first re-transmission T2, the re-transmission symbols S11<br>
and S2 1 are constructed by spatially swapping the bit data of the data symbols S1 and<br>
S2 , rearranging the bit data, and then replacing the LSB and the MSB with their<br>
complements.<br>
[280]	At the second re-transmission T3, the re-transmission symbols S12 and S2 2 are<br>
constructed by spatially swapping the bit data of the data symbols S1 and S2 with each<br>
other, rearranging the bit data, and then replacing the intermediate bit data with their<br>
complements. That is, the re-transmission symbols S12 and S2 2 are constructed by<br>
replacing the bit data other than the replaced bit data of the first re-transmission<br>
symbols S11 and S2 1 with their complements.<br>
[281]	Referring to FIG. 38, at the first re-transmission T2, the re-transmission symbols S11,<br>

other than the replaced bit data of the first re-transmission symbols S11 , S2 1 , S3 1 , and S4 1<br>

each other. That is, the re-transmission symbols S12 and S2 2 are constructed by<br>
spatially swapping the bit data of the data symbols S1 and S2 with each other and re-<br>
arranging the positions of the bit data in the symbols.<br>
[286]	Referring to FIG. 40, at the first re-transmission T2, the re-transmission symbols S11,<br>

symbols S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4 with each other, rearranging the positions of the bit data, and<br>

[288]	FIG. 41 is a diagram illustrating an arrangement of the re-transmission symbols for<br>
two transmit antennas and FIG. 42 is a diagram illustrating an arrangement of the re-<br>
transmission symbols for four transmit antennas.<br>
[289]	Referring to FIG. 41, the re-transmission symbols are constructed by swapping the<br>
bit data of the data symbols with each other. The re-transmission symbols S11 and S2 1<br>
are constructed by swapping the bit data (a1 , a2) of S1 and the bit data (b3 , b5 ) of S2 with<br>

[290]	Referring to FIG. 42, similarly to FIG. 41, the re-transmission symbols S11 and S2 1<br>
are constructed by swapping the bit data (a1 , a2) of S1 and the bit data (b3 , b5 ) of S2 with<br>
each other so that the bits are arranged to cross each other. The re-transmission<br>
symbols S3 1 and S4 1 are constructed by swapping the bit data (c1 ) of S3 and the bit data<br>
(d3 ) of S4 with each other so that the bit data of S 'are arranged to cross each other.<br>
[291]	The swapping, replacement, and arrangement of the bit data in the symbols can be<br>
performed in various ways.<br>
[292]	FIG. 43 is a diagram illustrating an arrangement of the re-transmission symbols for<br><br>
two transmit antennas and FIG. 44 is a diagram illustrating an arrangement of the re-<br>
transmission symbols for four transmit antennas.<br>
[293]	Referring to FIGs. 43 and 44, the re-trans mission symbols are constructed by<br>
swapping the bit data of the data symbols with each other. In this embodiment, only<br>
the transmission symbol for the second antenna 109-2 is re-transmitted and the<br>
transmission symbols for the other antennas are transmitted along with new data at the<br>
second transmission T2. The re-transmission is performed using a changed modulation<br>
scheme. At this time, it is preferable that the symbol from which an error is detected at<br>
the first transmission is transmitted using a modulation scheme with a low coding rate<br>
so as to enhance the transmission reliability. On the other hand, in a closed-loop<br>
multiple codeword system supporting the AMC, the controller 650 determines the<br>
MCS level (the coding rate and/or the modulation order) on the basis of the CQI in-<br>
formation fed back from the receiver and uses a new modulation scheme for the<br>
symbols at the time of re-transmission. In an open-loop multiple codeword system, the<br>
controller can determine that all the symbols to be re-transmitted are modulated using a<br>
modulation scheme with relatively high transmission reliability.<br>
[294]	Referring to FIG. 43, the 16-QAM and the 64-QAM are applied to the symbols S<br>
and S , respectively, at the first transmission Tl, but the 64-QAM and the QPSK are<br>
applied to the symbols at the time of re-transmission T2. When a symbol modulated<br>
using the 64-QAM has been transmitted through the second antenna 690-2 but an error<br>
is detected due to the poor channel condition, the symbol is modulated and transmitted<br>
using the 16-QAM to enhance the transmission reliability at the time of re-<br>
transmission. On the contrary, when the first transmission through the first antenna<br>
690-1 is successful and the channel condition of the corresponding channel is<br>
determined as being better on the basis of feedback information, new symbol data are<br>
transmitted using the 65-QAM as a different modulation scheme at the second<br>
transmission T2. In the open loop system, the first antenna 690-1 may perform the re-<br>
transmission by using the 16-QAM without any change, similarly to the first transmissi<br>
on.<br>
[295]	Referring to FIG. 44, the 16-QAM, the 64-QAM, the QPSK, and the 16-QAM are<br>
applied to the symbols S , S , S and S , respectively, at the first transmission Tl, but<br>
the 64-QAM, the 16-QAM, the 16-QAM, and the 16-QAM are applied to the symbols<br>
at the time of re-transmission T2. Here, only the data symbols through the second<br>
antenna 690-2 is re-transmitted. Specifically, the data symbols are re-transmitted using<br>
the 16-QAM with a coding rate lower than the 64-QAM. The first antenna 690-1 and<br>
the third antenna 690-3 succeeds in initial transmission and use the modulation<br>
schemes with a high coding rate at the second transmission. The fourth antenna 690-4<br>
is maintained in modulation scheme without any change.<br><br>
[296]	FIG. 45 is a diagram illustrating a data transmission method using the QARQ<br>
according to an embodiment of the invention. It is assumed here that the number of<br>
transmit antennas is 2 (N=2) and the data symbols for the antennas are SI and S2 .<br>
[297]	Referring to FIG. 45, the STBC is used as the space-time coding scheme. The<br>
Alamouti STBC is shown in Table 1. The data symbol S is transmitted through the<br>
first antenna 690-1 and the data symbol S is transmitted through the second antenna<br>
690-2.<br>
[298]	When an error is detected from the transmitted symbols and the NACK signal is<br>
transmitted, the re-transmission symbol -s is transmitted through the first antenna<br>
690-1 and the re-transmission symbol s is transmitted through the second antenna<br>
690-2, at the first re-transmission T2.<br>
[299]	When an error is detected from the re-transmitted symbols and the NCAK signal is<br>
transmitted, the re-transmission symbols S ' and S ' are constructed by remapping the<br>
data symbols S and S . The re-transmission symbols S ' and S ' can be constructed by<br>
swapping the bit data of the data symbols S and S with each other.<br>
[300]	At the second re-transmission T3, the re-transmission symbol S ' is transmitted<br>
through the first antenna 690-1 and the re-transmission symbol S ' is transmitted<br>
through the second antenna 690-2.<br>
[301]	When an error is detected again and the NACK signal is transmitted, the re-<br>
transmission symbols S ' and -S ' are constructed by remapping the re-transmission<br>
symbols S and -S . The re-transmission symbols S '* and -S ' can be constructed by<br>
swapping the bit data of the re-transmission symbols S and -S with each other. At<br>
*<br>
the third re-transmission T4, the re-transmission symbol -s ' is transmitted through the<br>
first antenna 690-1 and the re-transmission symbol s '* is transmitted through the<br>
second antenna 690-2.<br>
[302]	Here, the system having two antennas has been described, but the technical spirit of<br>
the invention can be applied to a system having three or more antennas without any<br>
change. The technical spirit of the invention can be applied to STTC as well as STBC.<br>
In this case, a multiple codeword system is assumed. Accordingly, different coding<br>
rates and/or modulation schemes can be further used for the respective symbols, in<br>
addition to a predetermined space-time coding technique.<br>

embodiment of the invention. FIG. 47 is a diagram illustrating the re-transmission<br>
symbols. This may be a transmitter using a cyclic delay diversity technique.<br>
[304]	Referring to FIGs. 46 and 47, the transmitter 800 includes channel encoders 810-1,<br>
..., 810-N, adaptive mappers 820-1,..., 820-N, a spatial encoder 830, a controller 850,<br>
and a receiving circuit 880. The transmitter 800 includes Nt (where Nt&gt;l) antennas<br>
890-1,..., 890-Nt and modulators 840-1, ..., 840-Nt.<br><br>
[305]	The embodiment of FIG. 46 is different from the embodiment of FIG. 31, in that<br>
delay units 870-1,..., 870-(Nt-l) are additionally disposed between the modulators<br>
840-1,..., 840-Nt and the antennas 890-1,..., 890-Nt. The other operations are similar<br>
to those of the embodiment of FIG. 31. The delay units 870-1,..., 870-(Nt-l) serve to<br>
cyclically delay the data symbols to be transmitted through the antennas 890-1,...,<br>
890-Nt. The times (?1,..., 7N-1) delayed by the delay units 870-1,..., 870-(NM) may<br>
have different values depending on the users and can be adjusted by the corresponding<br>
information fed back from the receiver.<br>
[306]	The operations of the transmitter 800 are as follows. First, at the first transmission<br>
Tl, the data symbol Sj is cyclically delayed and repeatedly transmitted through all the<br>
antennas 890-1,..., 890-Nt. When an error is detected from the transmitted symbol and<br>
the NACK signal is transmitted, the re-transmission symbol S ' remapped by the<br>
adaptive mapper 820 is cyclically delayed and transmitted through all the antennas<br>
890-1,..., 890-Nt at the first re-transmission T2. The re-transmission symbol S ' is<br>
constructed by remapping the cyclically delayed data symbol S . When an error is<br>
detected from the re-transmission symbol S ' and the NACK signal is transmitted, the<br>
re-transmission symbol S 2 remapped by the adaptive mappers 820-1,..., 820-N is<br>
cyclically delayed and transmitted through all the antennas 890-1,..., 890-Nt at the<br>
second re-transmission T3.<br>
[307]	In the cyclic delay diversity, the spatial diversity is embodied by transmitting the<br>
same data through the plural antennas and the frequency diversity is embodied by the<br>
use of the time delay. It is possible to secure an additional re-transmission gain by<br>
remapping the re-transmission symbols.<br>
[308]	FIG. 48 is a block diagram illustrating an example of the transmitter using an<br>
OFDM scheme. Here, the modulator of FIG. 46 is embodied in the OFDM scheme.<br>
[309]	Referring to FIG. 48, the symbols output from a spatial encoder 911 is converted<br>
into time domain samples by IFFT units 912-1, ..., 912-Nt. A CP is inserted into the<br>
samples by CP insertion units 916-1, ..., 916-Nt and the samples are transmitted<br>
through the antennas 919-1,..., 919-Nt. Delays units 915-1,..., 915-(Nt-l) are<br>
disposed between the IFFT units 912-1,..., 912-Nt and the CP insertion units 916-1,<br>
..., 916-Nt and serve to cyclically delay the samples.<br>
[310]	In anomer example, the positions of the delay units 915-1,..., 915-(Nt-l) and the<br>
CP insertion units 916-1,..., 916-Nt can be interchanged. That is, the CP can be<br>
inserted after the symbols are delayed, but the symbols may be delayed after the CP is<br>
inserted.<br>
[311]	FIG. 49 is a block diagram illustrating another example of the transmitter using the<br>
OFDM scheme. Here, the delay units of FIG. 46 are shifted to the frequency domain.<br>
[312]	Referring to FIG. 49, phase delay units 922-1,..., 922-(Nt-l) are disposed between<br><br>
a spatial encoder 921 and IFFT units 923-1, ..., 923-Nt and serve to cyclically delay<br>
the phases of the symbols. The time delay in the time domain and the phase delay in<br>
the frequency domain have duality.<br>
[313]	FIG. 50 is a block diagram illustrating a transmitter according to an embodiment of<br>
the invention. FIG. 51 is a diagram illustrating the re-transmission symbols.<br>
[314]	Referring to FIGs. 50 and 51, the transmitter 930 includes channel encoders 931-1,<br>
...,931-N, adaptive mappers 932-1, ..., 932-N, a parallel-serial converter 933, a<br>
modulator 934, a controller 935, and a receiving circuit 938. The transmitter 930<br>
includes one antenna 939.<br>
[315]	The operations of the transmitter 930 are as follows. First, the adaptive mappers<br>
932-1,..., 932-N outputs the plural data symbols in response to the multiple<br>
codewords output from the channel encoders 932-1,..., 932-N. The data symbols are<br>
converted into serial signals by the parallel-serial converter 933.<br>
[316]	Here, it is assumed that three data symbols S , S and S are converted into serial<br>
signals. The data symbols S . S and S are transmitted at the first transmission Tl. For<br>
example, the data symbols may be transmitted at a time. In this case, a packet<br>
transmission is performed and the data symbols S , S and S constitute one packet. In<br>
another example, the plural data symbols may be sequentially transmitted through one<br>
time slot. The number of symbols to be transmitted is not limited and may be two or<br>
more. Here, since the multiple codeword system is assumed, different coding rates<br>
and/or modulation schemes may be used for the symbols. For example, the coding rate<br>
of 1/2 and the QPSK may be used for S and S , and the coding rate of 3/4 and the<br>
16-QAM may be used for S .<br>
[317]	When an error is detected from the transmitted symbol and the NACK signal is<br>
transmitted, the re-transmission symbols S , S and S remapped by the adaptive<br>
mappers 932-1, ..., 932-N are transmitted at the first re-transmission T2. The re-<br>
transmission symbols S11 , S2 1 and S3 1 can be constructed by swapping the bit data of<br>
the data symbols S11 , S2 1 and S3 1 . When an error is detected from the re-transmission<br>
symbols and the NACK signal is ransmitted, the re-transmission symbols S12 , S2 2 and<br>
S3 2 remapped by the adaptive mappers 932-1,..., 932-N are transmitted at the second<br>
re-transmission T3. In this case, different coding rates and/or modulation schemes can<br>
be applied to the symbols to be re-transmitted on the basis of the feedback information.<br>
[318]	The swapping, replacement, crossing, change in modulation scheme, and delay for<br>
the re-transmission symbols can be considered when an error is detected from all the<br>
initially transmitted symbols and when an error is detected from a part of the initially<br>
transmitted symbols. When an error is detected from all the initially transmitted<br>
symbols, the bit rearrangement is performed on the symbols to be re-transmitted.<br>
However, when an error is detected from a part of the symbols, the bit rearrangement<br><br>
is performed on the symbols to be re-transmitted and the new symbols to be<br>
transmitted through antennas without an error.<br>
[319]	The above-mentioned re-transmission symbols may be remapped every re-<br>
transmission or may be remapped only once. A different remapping method or the<br>
same remapping method may be used every remapping.<br>
[320]	The criterion for determining the remapping method is not limited. For example, the<br>
remapping method can be determined properly depending on the situations in the open-<br>
loop system. The maximum Doppler frequency, the delay spread, and the like can be<br>
considered as the variable for determining the remapping method. In another example,<br>
the remapping method can be determined depending on the channel quality fed back in<br>
the closed-loop system along with the CQI signal.<br>
[321]	FIG. 52 is a flowchart illustrating a process of performing the HARQ of the chase<br>
combining scheme in the multiple codeword multiple antenna system.<br>
[322]	Referring to FIG. 52, when an error is detected from a specific symbol of symbols<br>
(or streams or packets) transmitted at the first transmission Tl and the NACK signal is<br>
received, the same symbols as the corresponding symbol is re-transmitted. At this time,<br>
the symbol is adaptively mapped and re-transmitted so that the data bits of the cor-<br>
responding symbol are swapped, replaced, and crossed with the data bits of the other<br>
symbols.<br>
[323]	The receiver calculates the LLR values of the coded bits by the use of the<br>
demapping method which is used for the re-transmission and which is determined in<br>
advance in cooperation with the transmitter, and combines the calculated LLR values<br>
with the LLR values of the coded bits received previously, thereby enhancing the<br>
transmission reliability of data.<br>
[324]	FIG. 53 is a flowchart illustrating a procedure of performing the HARQ of the IR<br>
scheme in the multiple codeword multiple antenna system.<br>
[325]	Referring to FIG. 53, when an error is detected from a specific symbol of symbols<br>
(or streams or packets) transmitted at the first transmission Tl, the partial IR scheme of<br>
transmitting systematic bits and punctured parity bits at the time of re-transmission<br>
may be used. Alternatively, the full IR scheme of additionally transmitting the parity<br>
bits at the time of re-transmission may be used. At this time, the transmission symbols<br>
are not re-transmitted but redundant symbols are re-transmitted. It is possible to secure<br>
the addition re-transmission gain by spatially remapping and transmitting the<br>
redundant symbols.<br>
[326]	FIG. 54 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an HARQ using multiple antennas in a<br>
multiple user environment<br>
[327]	Referring to FIG. 54, when the symbols transmitted through one or more transmit<br>
antennas are transmitted to receiver 1 and receiver 2 and an error is detected from the<br><br>
symbol transmitted to a specific receiver, it is possible to secure the additional HARQ<br>
gain, by performing the rearrangement on a signal constellation such as the swapping,<br>
replacement, transition, and change in modulation scheme of the symbols in the<br>
adaptive mapper and re-transmitting the symbols.<br>
[328]	The symbols transmitted through different antennas are considered at the time of<br>
mapping the re-transmission symbols. Accordingly, by embodying the mapping<br>
diversity using the remapping of the symbols, it is possible to secure the additional re-<br>
transmission gain.<br>
[329]	The re-transmission is performed using a mapping method suitable for the channel<br>
environment. Specifically, in performing the re-transmission due to the transmission<br>
error in the multiple codeword system, the diversity gain can be secured additionally<br>
by spatially remapping the symbols for each codeword, thereby minimizing the request<br>
for re-transmission and enhancing the communication quality.<br>
[330]<br>
[331]	VI. HARQ USING OPTIMAL MAPPING RULE<br>
[332]	FIG. 55 is a flowchart illustrating a data transmission method according to an<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
[333]	Referring to FIG. 55, the transmitter transmits a transmission block S (S110). The<br>
transmission block is of an NtxNb matrix type and is a data block that is mapped onto<br>
the signal constellation by the adaptive mapper 120. Nt denotes the number of transmit<br>
antennas and Nb denotes the number of index bits corresponding to the modulation<br>
scheme. In an M-QAM scheme, Nb=log M and Nb=4 in the 16-QAM scheme. The su-<br>
perscript of the transmission block S denotes the number of re-transmissions. For<br>
example, S denotes a transmission block at the first transmission, and S denotes a<br>
transmission block at the first re-trans mission. When the transmit antennas use the<br>
same modulation scheme, the k-th row of S is one data symbol and can be expressed<br>
by the bits of the I axis and the Q axis as shown<br>
[334]	MathFigure 1<br><br>
[335]	where i and q are bits representing the I axis and the Q axis on the signal con-<br>
stellation.<br>
[336]	The I axis and the Q axis does not limit the positions, but one axis is the I axis when<br>
the other axis is the Q axis. In the 16-QAm (Nb=4) and the 2x2 MIMO system (Nt=2),<br>
the transmission block is a 2x4 matrix and can be expressed by Equation 2.<br>
[337]	MathFigure 2<br><br><br>
[338]	The receiver detects an error from the received transmission block S (S720). When<br>
an error is not detected, the receiver transmits the ACK signal and waits for the<br>
transmission of a next transmission block. However, it is assumed here that the<br>
receiver detects an error and transmits the NACK signal as the re-transmission request<br>
signal (S730).<br>
[339]	When receiving the NACK signal, the transmitter transmits the re-transmission<br>
block S (740). When receiving the NACK signal, the adaptive mapper remaps the<br>
transmission block S by bits and/or spatially to construct the re-transmission block S .<br>
The remapping method used for the re-transmission is various, which will be described<br>
later.<br>
[340]	The receiver detects an error from the received re-transmission block SI (S750).<br>
[341]	When not detecting an error, the receiver 200 transmits the ACK signal to the<br>
transmitter and waits for the transmission of a next symbol. However, it is assumed<br>
here that the receiver detects an error and transmits the NACK signal as the re-<br>
transmission request signal (S760).<br>
[342]	When receiving the NACK signal, the transmitter transmits the remapped re-<br>
2	0<br>
transmission block S (S770). The adaptive mapper remaps the transmission block S<br>
by bits and/or spatially to construct the re-transmission block S .<br>
[343]	The receiver detects an error from the received re-transmission block S (S780). The<br>
receiver 200 transmits the ACK signal or the NACK signal to the transmitter in<br>
accordance with the error detection result (S790). When the ACK signal is transmitted,<br>
the re-transmission of the corresponding transmission block is ended. The request for<br>
re-transmission using the NACK signal can be repeated up to the n-th (where n&gt;l)<br>
times which is a predetermined number of times. When an error is detected due to the<br>
n-th re-transmission, the re-transmission process can be reset and the transmission of a<br>
next transmission block can be started. Alternatively, the current transmission block<br>
can be transmitted again.<br>
[344]	FIG. 56 is a diagram illustrating transmission blocks corresponding to multiple<br>
antennas.<br>
[345]	Referring to FIG. 56, TO denotes the first transmission, Tl denotes the second<br>
transmission, that is, the first re-transmission, and Tn denotes the (n+l)-th<br>
transmission, that is, the n-th re-transmission. The transmission block S is a<br>
transmission block at the first transmission, S is a transmission block at the first re-<br>
transmission, and Sn is a transmission block at the n-th re-transmission.<br><br><br>
[346]	The optimized remapping of the bits is necessary for the re-transmission. In the data<br>
transmission method according to the invention, roughly two advantages can be<br>
obtained. First, each bit position has unique bit importance due to the characteristic of<br>
the QAM scheme. When the remapping is performed by bits, the positions on the<br>
signal constellation are changed. Accordingly, it can be said that the signal con-<br>
stellation mapping varies. It is called mapping diversity to embody diversity by<br>
varying the signal constellation mapping. The mapping diversity is obtained by<br>
swapping the bits of the data symbols or inverting the bits at the time of re-<br>
transmission,. Second, it is possible to obtain the spatial diversity by shuffling the<br>
antennas at the time of re-transmission in the multiple antenna system. When the<br>
antennas use the same modulation scheme, the mapping diversity gain and the spatial<br>
diversity gain are independent of each other. The horizontal rearrangement scheme for<br>
obtaining the mapping diversity is referred to as a bit swapping and inversion (BSI)<br>
scheme and the vertical rearrangement scheme for obtaining the spatial diversity is<br>
referred to as a bit shuffling between antennas (BSA) scheme.<br>
[347]	The BSI scheme is first described.<br>
[348]	FIG. 57 is a diagram illustrating a signal constellation of the M-QAM scheme.<br>
[349]	Referring to FIG. 57, since the variation between antennas is not considered in the<br>
BSI scheme, only one column of the transmission block can be considered. M signal<br>
positions exist in total and the number of index bits is Nb=log M.<br>
[350]	When the minimum distance between the signal constellation positions is D as only<br>
one of the I axis and the Q axis is viewed, position D(c) of a transmission signal c on<br>
one axis is expressed by Equation 3.<br>
[351]	MathFigure 3<br><br>
[352]	As only the I axis is viewed, a priori probability of the transmission signal c is A(c)<br>
and the transmission information is<br><br>
. d1 is the MSB and dNb/2 is the LSB. The position of the MSB or the LSB can be<br>
changed. For example, d may be the LSB and d may be the MSB.<br>
[353]	When a received signal is y, the LLR value of the d bit is expressed as shown.<br>
[354]	MathFigure 4<br><br><br>
[357]	For example, in the 16-QAM scheme, the result shown in Table 2 can be obtained<br>
by using Equation 4 for the I axis. N denotes a noise spread.<br>
[358]	Table 2<br><br>
[359]	Referring to Table 2, the average of the LLR values received at the time of<br>
transmission is higher in d as the MSB than in d as the LSB. This means that the<br>
transmission of the same information through the LSB position causes more bit errors<br>
than the transmission of the same information through the MSB. Accordingly, by<br>
transmitting the bits, which have been transmitted through the LSB position at the first<br>
transmission, through the MSB position at the re-transmission, it is possible to enhance<br>
the link performance as a whole. That is, by performing the swapping of bits at the<br>
time of re-transmission, it is possible to reduce the difference in LLR between the bits.<br>
[360]	However, it is not possible to reduce the difference in absolute LLR value between<br>
the symbols only by the use of the bit swapping. The bit inversion is necessary to<br>
reduce the difference in absolute LLR value between the symbols in case of (1,0) and<br>
(1,1) in Table 2. When the LSB is inversely mapped and transmitted by the bit<br>
inversion at the time of re-transmission, (1,1) and (1,0) can be received as the opposite<br>
LLR values. In the 16-QAM scheme, since two different absolute LLR values exist at<br><br>
the MSB, it is possible to reduce the difference in absolute LLR value between the<br>
symbols by performing the transmission using one inversion of the first transmission.<br>
Here, only the bits relevant to the I axis are described, but the above-mentioned<br>
technique can be applied to the bits relevant to the Q axis in the same way.<br>
[361]	In the optimal BSI, the absolute value of the combined LLR received at the re-<br>
transmission is constant at all the bit positions and in all the symbols. In the 16-QAM<br>
scheme and the 2x2 MIMO system, the optimal BSI can be obtained by using four BSI<br>
schemes in total of two types of bit swapping and two types of bit inversion. That is, as<br>
for the transmission block transmitted first, the transmission block having been<br>
subjected to the bit swapping is transmitted at the first re-transmission, the<br>
transmission block having been subjected to the bit inversion on the LSB is transmitted<br>
at the second re-transmission, and the transmission block having been subjected to the<br>
bit swapping and the bit inversion is transmitted at the third re-transmission. This can<br>
be expressed as shown<br><br>
denotes the inversion of a bit.<br>
[367]	Table 3 shows a variation of the combined LLR values when the re-transmission is<br>
performed using the BSI set.<br><br><br>
[368]	Table 3<br>
[369]	The same absolute LLR value can be obtained from the all the bit positions and all<br>
the symbols by four times of transmission.<br>
[370]	The magnitude of the optimal BSI set is 4 or more in the modulation schemes of<br>
16-QAM or greater. The difference in absolute LLR value between the bits is reduced<br>
by the bit swapping and the absolute value difference in received LLR value between<br>
the symbols is reduced by the bit inversion. Since no greatest common divisor of the<br>
absolute values of the received LLR values exist in any M-QAM scheme, bits should<br>
be transmitted through all the bit positions at the re-transmission and should be<br>
transmitted by proper inversion so as to reduce the difference between the symbols.<br>
[371]	Since (Nb/2) bit positions in total exist relative to the I axis in the M-QAM scheme<br>
and any bit should experience all the positions through the re-transmission, (Nb/2) bit<br>
swapping operations should be performed in total. The bit inversion process for<br>
reducing the absolute value difference of the received LLR between the symbols is<br>
determined on the basis of what kinds of absolute values of the received LLR values<br>
the bit positions have. Particularly, in an expression using the binary system, the<br>
necessary number of inversion operations is determined depending on the bit position<br>
having the greatest number of kinds among the bit positions. The bit located at the<br>
MSB position always has the most kinds of absolute values of the received LLR<br>
values. In the 16-QAM scheme, since the MSB has two kinds of absolute values of the<br>
received LLR values and the LSB has one kind relative to the I axis, two inversion<br>
operations are necessary. In the M-QAM scheme, since the bits at the MSB position<br>
relative to the I axis have<br>
√M/2<br>
kinds of absolute values of the received LLR values which are the most kinds, the<br><br>
absolute value difference of the received LLR values between the symbols can be<br>
reduced by the<br>
√M/2<br>
inversion operations in minimum. Accordingly, the minimum number of transmissions<br>
N for obtaining the optimal BSI in an arbitrary modulation method M-QAM can be<br>
opt<br>
expressed by Equation 6.<br>
[372]	MathFigure 6<br><br>
[373J ' FIG. 58 is a diagram illustrating a BSI set depending on the M-QAM scheme.<br>
[374]	Referring to FIG. 58, the optimal BSI set for the M-QAM scheme includes a<br>
combination of the swapping of bits using (Nb/2) cyclic shifts and<br>
√M/2<br>
inversions. This is true of the I axis, but is also true of the Q axis. The cyclic shift<br>
means a scheme of shifting the bits one by one and the remaining bit is disposed again<br>
at the first position. The cyclic shift is proposed because an arbitrary transmission bit<br>
should be transmitted through all the transmission bit positions. The invention is not<br>
limited to the cyclic shift, but may employ various methods. However, the arbitrary<br>
transmission bit should not be re-transmitted through the once transmitted position.<br>
[375]	The inversion process includes inverting the bits other than the leftmost bit in the<br>
transmission block formed through all the cyclic shifts bit by bit and finally inverting<br>
all the bits other than the leftmost bit. The leftmost bit is a bit that is transmitted to a<br>
position corresponding to the MSB, and the leftmost position is a bit position having<br>
the most kinds of absolute LLR values. Accordingly, the difference in absolute LLR<br>
value between the symbols for the leftmost bit is reduced by the inversion process.<br>
Since the leftmost bit circulates by the cyclic shift, the process of reducing the<br>
difference in absolute LLR value between the symbols is consequently performed on<br>
all the bits.<br>
[376]	When the re-transmission is performed the number of times smaller than the<br>
number of times of the optimum BSI, the bit swapping is first performed and then the<br>
inversion is performed. Referring to an example of Equation 5, when it is assumed that<br>
the re-transmission is performed only once, the use of the transmission block such as S<br>
or S having been subjected to the swapping of the bit positions after the first<br>
transmission is more preferable than the use of the transmission block such as S<br>
having been subjected to the process of reducing the difference in absolute LLR value<br><br>
between the symbols.<br>
[377]<br>
[378]	Now, the BSA scheme will be described.<br>
[379]	In order to optimize the BSA scheme, the time diversity and/or the spatial diversity<br>
should be maximized at the time of re-transmission. In general, the spatial diversity is<br>
obtained by transmitting the same symbol through plural antennas and the time<br>
diversity is obtained by repeatedly transmitting the same symbol through different time<br>
slots. In such a scheme, since the time difference for transmitting the same symbol is<br>
not great, the transmission performance tends to depend on the spatial diversity.<br>
However, since the time interval between the re-transmissions in the HARQ is several<br>
ms which is much greater than the interval in the unit of symbols, the re-transmission<br>
channels may be different from each other. By changing the transmit antennas by bits<br>
at the time of re-transmission, it is possible to obtain higher diversity.<br>
[380]	For clarity, a 2x2 MIMO system using the 16-QAM scheme is assumed. The<br>
transmission block expressed by Equation 2 is considered at the first transmission.<br>
Regarding the transmission block S to be first re-transmitted, which can be defined by<br>
the BSA scheme, the following five scheme combinations can be considered.<br>
[381]	Equation 7 shows the BSA scheme for four bits. All the bits to be transmitted<br>
through the transmit antennas are swapped.<br>
[382]	MathFigure 7<br><br>
[383]	Equation 8 shows the BSA scheme for three bits. One bit in die I axis and two bits<br>
in the Q axis are swapped. Alternatively, two bits in the I axis and one bit in the Q axis<br>
may be swapped.<br>
[384]	MathFigure 8<br><br>
[385]	Equation 9 shows the BSA scheme for two bits. One bit in the I axis and one bit in<br>
the Q axis are swapped.<br>
[386]	MathFigure 9<br><br>
[387]	Equation 10 shows the BSA scheme for two bits. Two bits in the Q axis are<br><br>
swapped. Alternatively, two bits in the I axis are swapped.<br>
[388]	MathFigure 10<br><br>
[389]	Equation 11 expresses the BSA scheme for one bit. One bit in the Q axis is<br>
swapped. Alternatively, one bit in the I axis is swapped.<br>
[390]	MathFigure 11<br><br>
[391]	The above-mentioned combinations are all associated with the selection of the I<br>
axis and the Q axis. The bit position in the I axis or the bit position in the Q axis to be<br>
swapped can be changed.<br>
[392]	Since the I axis and the Q axis are independent of each other, the respective<br>
transmission blocks have two I-axis symbols and two Q-axis symbols. The first<br>
transmission block S and the first re-transmission block S1 have a time difference of<br>
several ms. Accordingly, when the speed is great, the transmission blocks may<br>
experience channel responses independent of each other. When the BSA scheme in the<br>
unit of symbols is embodied as expressed by Equation 7, each of the four symbols can<br>
experience two channel conditions.<br>
[393]	The number of channel conditions experienced by the symbols is defined as a<br>
diversity order (DO). The transmission block S expressed by Equation 7 is 2, which is<br>
equal to the DO obtained by using the same transmission matrixes every time (that is,<br>
S =S ). This means that the BSA in the unit of symbols does not provide a large<br>
advantage in performance. In the transmission block S expressed by Equation 8, two<br>
bits in the Q axis are swapped and one bit in the I axis is swapped. In this method,<br>
since two I symbols experience three channel conditions and two Q symbols<br>
experience two channel conditions, DO=(3+2)/2=2.5. In the transmission block S<br>
expressed by Equation 9, one bit in the I axis and one bit in the Q axis are swapped. In<br>
this method, the DO is 3 in maximum in consideration of one re-transmission. In the<br>
transmission block S expressed by Equation 10, only two bits in the Q axis are<br>
swapped. In this method, since all the symbols experience only two channel<br>
conditions, the DO is 2. When the speed of the user equipment decreases and thus a<br>
correlation in channel response between the re-transmissions, DO is lowered to 2 or<br>
less. In the transmission block S1 expressed by Equation 11, only one bit in the Q axis<br>
is swapped. In this method, since two Q symbols experience three channel conditions<br><br>
and two Q symbols experience two channel conditions by means of the time diversity,<br>
DO is 2.5. When the speed of the user equipment decreases, this method is lower in<br>
performance than the method expressed by Equation 8 in which three bits are swapped.<br>
[394]	FIG. 59 illustrates a simulation result in which the BSA schemes are compared with<br>
each other at a user equipment speed of 120 km/h. FIG. 60 illustrates a simulation<br>
result in which the BSA schemes are compared with each other at a user equipment<br>
speed of 30 km/h. The schemes expressed by Equations 7 to 10 are compared in the<br>
simulations and the link performance is expressed by FER (Frame Error Rate) Vs.<br>
SNR. It is checked what influence the BSA scheme has on the link performance, by<br>
considering only the bit swapping between the antennas without considering the BSI<br>
scheme.<br>
[395]	Referring to FIGs. 59 and 60, when the speed of the user equipment is great (120<br>
km/h), the performance is enhanced with an increase in DO. When the speed of the<br>
user equipment is small (30 km/h), the temporal dependency on channel response<br>
between the re-transmissions is great and thus the scheme expressed by Equation 10 in<br>
which two bits in the Q axis are swapped is less in performance than the scheme<br>
expressed by Equation 7 in which the swapping is performed in the unit of symbols. In<br>
addition, the scheme expressed by Equation 11 in which only one bit is swapped is less<br>
in performance than the scheme expressed by quation 8 in which three bits are<br>
swapped.<br>
[396]	FIG. 61 is a diagram illustrating an example of the BSA scheme with an arbitrary<br>
number of antennas.<br>
[397]	Referring to FIG. 61, in order to allow the I symbol and the Q symbol to experience<br>
the maximum DO, it is necessary to transmit the bit information of the symbols<br>
through different antennas at the time of re-transmission. The bits can be cyclically<br>
shifted through the arbitrary number of antennas of 2 or more. In the 16-QAM scheme,<br>
when only one bit of the bits of the I symbol and the Q symbol is cyclically shifted, all<br>
the symbols can obtain the DO of 3 and thus the maximum performance can be<br>
expected.<br>
[398]	FIG. 62 is a diagram illustrating another example of the BSA scheme with an<br>
arbitrary number of antennas and an M-QAM modulation scheme.<br>
[399]	Referring to FIG. 62, the respective columns can be transmitted with different<br>
degrees of shift. In the modulation scheme higher than the 16-QAM scheme, the<br>
maximum diversity can be expected by performing a multi-step cyclic shift process.<br>
The bits of the I symbol and the Q symbol are cyclically shifted with different degrees<br>
of shift depending on the positions of the bits. For example, the degree of shift of the<br>
second bit of the I symbol may be set to 1 and the degree of shift of the third bit of the<br>
I symbol may be set to 2. The bits of one symbol can be transmitted through different<br><br>
antennas. Accordingly, when the number of bits (Nb/2) of the I symbol or the Q<br>
symbol is greater than the number of transmit antennas Nt, it is possible to obtain<br>
additional diversity of (Nb/2) in maximum. The degree of shift may be transmitted<br>
through the downlink or may be a value determined in advance by the transmitter and<br>
the receiver.<br>
[400]	It is considered that the re-transmission is performed two or more times. Since a<br>
relatively large time difference can exist between the re-transmissions, the channel<br>
responses between the re-transmissions are independent of each other. At this time, the<br>
previous BSA scheme does not affect the determination of the BSA scheme every re-<br>
transmission. Accordingly, the BSA scheme shown in FIG. 62 can be used as the BSA<br>
scheme for the second or subsequent re-transmission without any change, regardless of<br>
the previous BSA scheme. However, when the speed of the user equipment decreases,<br>
the previous BSA and the current BSA may have some correlation. Accordingly, by<br>
changing the degree of shift of the respective columns in the multi-step cyclic shift<br>
structure depending on the number of re-transmissions, better performance can be<br>
expected.<br>
[401]	In the system using the M-QAM scheme (Nb=log M) and Nt transmit antennas,<br>
when the re-transmission is performed n times using the scheme shown in FIG. 62, the<br>
DO obtained in addition to the DO of the first transmission can be expressed by<br>
Equation 12.<br>
[402]	MathFigure 12<br><br>
[403]	This is the maximum DO which can be obtained from the BSA scheme in the given<br>
environment. When the speed of the user equipment decreases, the DO may decrease<br>
slightly due to the correlation in channel response between the re-transmissions.<br>
[404]	FIG. 63 is a diagram illustrating a mapping method of a transmission block at the<br>
time of re-transmission in a system using the 16-QAM scheme and two transmit<br>
antennas. When it is assumed that the same QAM scheme is used for the transmit<br>
antennas, the BSI and the BSA are independent of each other and do not affect each<br>
other. Accordingly, a combination of the respective optimum methods is the whole<br>
optimum method.<br>
[405]	Referring to FIG. 63, the BSI scheme of swapping the MSB and the LSB in the first<br>
transmission block S and the BSA scheme of swapping the bits in the I channel and<br>
the Q channel bit by bit are used for the first re-transmission block S . The BSI scheme<br>
of swapping the MSB and the LSB in the first transmission block S and inverting the<br>
right bit positions in the I axis and the Q axis and the BSA scheme of swapping the bits<br>
in the I axis and the Q axis bit by bit are used for the third re-transmission block S .<br><br>
The absolute values of the combined LLR values received through the four<br>
transmissions including the first transmission can be set equal to each other, thereby<br>
maximizing the DO.<br>
[406]	FIG. 64 is a graph illustrating a simulation result using the mapping method shown<br>
in FIG. 63 by FER Vs. SNR. Here, 'conventional' indicates a case where the symbols<br>
are re-transmitted without being remapping and 'antenna switching' indicates a case<br>
where four bits are swapped with each between the antennas by the use of the method<br>
of performing the BSA scheme in the unit of symbols.<br>
[407]	Referring to FIG. 64, this technique provides a gain greater by about 2 dB than that<br>
of the method of retransmitting the symbols regardless of the speed of the user<br>
equipment. In the 'antenna switching' method, since the I symbol and the Q symbol<br>
have a DO of 2, the performance is not greatly improved.<br>
[408]	The channel reliability of the bits can be improved on the average, thereby<br>
obtaining the diversity gain. It is possible to secure the mapping diversity resulting<br>
from the channel variation by performing the bit mapping on the signal constellation in<br>
consideration of the time and/or space multiplexing every transmission.<br>
[409]	Equation 13 expresses an example of the re-mapping in a system with the 64-QAM<br>
scheme and three transmit antennas. The BSI scheme of cyclically shifting the bits in<br>
the first transmission block S and the BSA scheme of swapping the bits in the I axis<br>
and the Q axis by two bite are used for the first re-transmission block S1. The degree of<br>
shift for the BSA scheme varies. For example, the degrees of shift of the second bits in<br>
the I axis and the Q axis are 1 and the degrees of shift of the third bits in the I axis and<br>
the Q axis are 2. The BSI scheme of twice cyclically shifting the bits in the first<br>
transmission block S° and the BSA scheme of swapping the bits in the I axis and the Q<br>
axis by two bits are used for the second re-transmission block S2 . The BSI scheme of<br>
inverting the bits of the first transmission block S° in the I axis and the Q axis bit by bit<br>
is used for the third re-transmission block S3 . In this way, it is possible to provide the<br>
optimum BSI set in which the absolute values of all the received LLR values are equal<br>
to each other through 12 (Nopt=12) times of transmissions and it is also possible to<br>
provide the optimum BSA using the cyclic shift. The BSI scheme of first performing<br>
the bit swapping can be considered to carry out the number of re-transmissions which<br>
is smaller than the 12 times.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
[422]	Equation 14 expresses an example of the remapping in a system with the 256-QAM<br>
scheme and four transmit antennas. The BSI scheme of cyclically shifting the bits in<br>
the first transmission block S and the BSA scheme of swapping the bits in the I axis<br>
and the Q axis by three bits are used for the first re-transmission block S . The degree<br>
of shift for the BSA scheme varies. For example, the degrees of shift of the second bits<br><br>
in the I axis and the Q axis are 1, the degrees of shift of the third bits in the I axis and<br>
the Q axis are 2, and the degrees of shift of the fourth bits in the I axis and the Q axis<br>
are 3. The BSI scheme of twice cyclically shifting the bits in the first transmission<br>
block S and the BSA scheme of swapping the bits in the I axis and the Q axis by three<br>
bits are used for the second re-transmission block S . The BSI scheme of triple<br>
cyclically shifting the bits of the first transmission block S and the BSA scheme of<br>
swapping the bits in the I axis and the Q axis by three bits are used for the third re-<br>
transmission block S . The BSI scheme of inverting the bits of the first transmission<br>
block S in the I axis and the Q axis bit by bit is used for the fourth re-transmission<br>
block S . In this way, it is possible to provide the optimum BSI set in which the<br>
absolute values of all the received LLR values are equal to each other through 32 (N<br>
opt<br>
=32) times of transmissions and it is also possible to provide the optimum BSA scheme<br>
using the cyclic shift. The BSI scheme of first performing the bit swapping can be<br>
considered to carry out the number of re-transmissions which is smaller than the 32<br>
times.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[455]	Equation 15 expresses an example of the remapping in the system using the<br>
64-QAM scheme and two transmit antennas. It is possible to enhance the performance<br>
of the first re-transmission block S by applying the BS A scheme and the BSI scheme<br>
to the first transmission block S .<br>
[456]	MathFigure 15<br><br><br>
[458]	FIG. 65 is a graph illustrating a simulation result using the remapping expressed by<br>
Equation 15 by FER Vs. SNR. The performance gain is higher by about 4 dB in 1%<br>
FER than the conventional mapper.<br>
[459]	Examples of the modulation scheme include 16-QAM, 64-QAM, and 256-QAM in<br>
the above description, but the invention may employ any modulation scheme. The<br>
number of transmit antennas is not limited, but the invention can be applied to one or<br>
more transmit antennas without any change.<br>
[460]	The channel reliability of the bits can be improved on the average, thereby<br>
obtaining the diversity gain. It is possible to secure the mapping diversity resulting<br>
from the channel variation by performing the bit mapping on the signal constellation in<br>
consideration of the time and/or space multiplexing every transmission. By changing<br>
the transmit antennas used for the re-transmission, it is possible to obtain the spatial<br>
diversity. Since two kinds of diversity gains can be additionally secured, it is possible<br>
to minimize the request for re-transmission and to enhance the communication quality.<br>
[461]	The present invention can be implemented by hardware, software or a combination<br>
thereof. The hardware may be implemented by an application specific integrated<br>
circuit (ASIC) that is designed to perform the above function, a digital signal<br>
processing (DSP), a programmable logic device (PLD), a field programmable gate<br>
array (FPGA), a processor, a controller, a microprocessor, the other electronic unit, or<br>
a combination thereof. A module for performing the above function may implement<br>
the software. The software may be stored in a memory unit and executed by a<br>
processor. The memory unit or the processor may employ a variety of means that is<br>
well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
