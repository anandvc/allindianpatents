[1001]       The present invention generally relates to wireless communications devices 			used in wireless communications networks More particularly, the invention 		concerns a wireless communications device that seeks to correct its sleep 			clock to account for temperature induced errors.<br>
		Background<br>
[1002] A mobile phone periodically awakens from the sleep state for a brief length of 		time, in order to receive paging signals from base stations alerting the phone to 		incoming calls and also to perform other tasks such as searching for pilot 		signals of nearby base stations, etc. The timing of this wake state is critical 		because it must overlap a predetermined network-established time. If the 		wake state occurs too late or too early, the phone will miss its opportunity to 		send/receive signals at the network-established time, hi this case, the mobile 		phone would miss any arriving calls, and the phone might lose network 		service entirely.<br>
[1003] There is a need, therefore, for accurate methods of correcting a sleep clock 		operating in a wireless environment.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[1012] The nature, objectives, and advantages of the invention will become more 	apparent to those skilled in the art after considering the following detailed 	description in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>
[1013] Mobile phone designers are faced with a variety of different engineering 				challenges. One of the most perplexing problems is the necessity of using battery 			power to drive the phone's transceiver, speaker, microphone, display, and all other 			on-board electronics. A battery may only provide a finite amount of power until 			exhaustion, at which time the phone ceases to work. Of course, most mobile 				phone batteries are rechargeable, but this requires access to a power source.<br>
[1014] Consequently, mobile phones have been designed with the ability to operate in 			various low power modes. With the absence of any outgoing or incoming calls, a 			mobile phone is in an "idle" state. At times, some phone models enter a "nosrmal sleep" 		state where the phone selectively disables various circuitries such as its tansceiver, 			central processor, and certain other hardware. At this point, the phone consumes 			hardly any current. At precisely scheduled intervals, the phone briefly awakens, 			chiefly to receive paging signals from base stations alerting the phone to incoming 			calls and for other reasons such as searching for pilot signals of nearby base stations, etc.<br>
[1015]  Some models are even capable of entering a "deep sleep" mode, in which the mobile 			phone cannot achieve communications with any base stations for some length of 			time. In this mode, the phone ceases all communications, and simply waits for 			user input<br><br>
WO 2005/099107                                                       4	PCT/US2005/010438<br>
while powering-down to an even greater extent. Conducting deep sleep mode is fairly straightforward, because the phone simply stops most operations.<br>
[1016] But as for the normal sleep state, there are special challenges to be overcome. The 	chief difficulty is accurately keeping track of time. The fundamental principle is that 	when a mobile phone sleeps, it uses a dedicated sleep oscillator for timekeeping. And, 	in a perfect world, such an oscillator would track the progress of time perfectly. 	However, fluctuations in the phone's temperature cause the oscillator to speed up or 	slow down. Although significant fluctuations in the phone's temperature may result 	from extreme weather or other ambient air behavior, a more significant influence occurs 	because the phone heats during use and cools while dormant.<br>
[1017] One seemingly sensible approach would be to simply lengthen the phone's wake state to guarantee communication with the base station. This is undesirable because it would draw more battery power, shortening the phone's functional time before recharge is necessary. Another approach would be to correct the phone's oscillator to a time reference signal from the network some time during the wake state. Even with such frequent clock resetting, however, the phone's oscillator may still wander excessively.<br>
[1018] Another seemingly sensible solution might be to use circuitry of the phone itself to track the oscillator's frequency. This approach recognizes the difficulty of changing the sleep clock's oscillator frequency, so instead it tries to track the sleep clock's actual frequency based on errors between the oscillator and the network reference signal to account for temperature. FIG. 1A shows a control loop that models an example of this approach. Although this approach addresses some of these issues, the algorithm is not particularly accurate with frequently repeating sleep cycles of brief duration. In fact, temperature induced errors may actually get worse with the foregoing approach. In addition, correcting for temperature errors is more difficult than it seems because there are other errors that may camouflage the insidious influence of temperature on oscillator operation.<br>
[1019] One such error is "multipath." Namely, when the phone wakes up and receives the first available base station timing signal, that signal could be delayed with respect to the last time that the same timing signal was used by the phone. This delay may be caused by a change in reflection from buildings, earth, and other structures. Thus, arrival of this timing signal at the phone would be delayed with respect to its expected time, falsely making even a perfectly timed oscillator appear to be running fast. The opposite could also occur, where the oscillator falsely appears to be running slow due to the<br><br>
WO 2005/099107                                                  5	PCT/US2005/010438<br>
initial timing signal being delayed by multipath to a greater extent than the later timing signal.<br>
[1020]	Accordingly, progress remains  to  be made  in   the   area  of recognizing  and<br>
minimizing temperature induced errors in timekeeping during mobile phones' sleep cycles.<br>
[1021] A method is disclosed for correcting a sleep clock of a wireless communications device. Sleep oscillator frequency is estimated so as to compensate for estimated temperature induced errors. In estimating temperature induced errors, errors in sleep oscillator frequency are treated as being temperature induced errors, but probable multipath errors are bounded to predetermined sleep clock error maxima corresponding to sleep duration over which the error occurred.<br>
HARDWARE COMPONENTS &amp; INTERCONNECTIONS<br>
Introduction <br>
[1022] Broadly, one aspect of the present disclosure is a wireless communications device that 	operates in a wireless communications network. The device utilizes a sleep clock to regulate 	when the device wakes from a reduced power sleep state. The device is configured to 	eliminate probable multipath errors in order to increase the accuracy of correct temperature 	induced errors in the operation of its sleep clock. One example of an application for this 	technology is in a wireless mobile telephone in a code division multiple access (CDMA) 	type network. To increase the accuracy of temperature compensation, the device also 	identifies and limits probable multipath errors. Of course, this disclosure broadly anticipates 	any other wireless communication technology in which remote devices utilize sleep clocks.<br>
	Wireless Telephone <br>
[1023] FIG. IB illustrates a wireless communications device 100, which in this; example is a 	wireless telephone. The device 100 includes a speaker 108, user interface 110, microphone 	114, transceiver 104, antenna 106, data processing equipment 102, and a sleep clock 116, 	along with any other conventional circuitry that may vary depending upon the 	communications technology, application, phone features, etc. The equipment 102 may 	comprise one or more logic circuits, discrete circuit elements, application<br><br>
WO 2005/099107                                                   6	PCT/HS2005/010438<br>
specific integrated circuits (ASICs), microprocessors, computers, or other apparatus. Various specific examples are discussed below in conjunction with FIGURES 2-3. The equipment 102 serves to manage operation of the components 104,108,110, and 114 as well as signal routing between these components.<br>
[1024] The foregoing components are powered by a battery (not shown). In order to preserve battery power, some or all of the components 108, 110, 114, 104 may be partially or completely shut down during certain reduced power sleep states. In addition, some or all of the equipment 102 may be powered off during this time. In addition to keeping track of time during sleep states, the sleep clock 116 triggers wakeup of some or all of the components 108,110., 114, 104, 102. Although different implementations will be apparent to ordinarily skilled artisans (having the benefit of this disclosure), the sleep clock 116 in this example comprises an oscillator with a nominal frequency. This frequency may vary according to temperature, the compensation for which is one subject of the present disclosure.<br>
[1025] Relatedly, the equipment 102 additionally includes an error correction unit 180 that is programmed, electrically configured, or otherwise structured to recognize and then correct temperature induced errors in the operation of the sleep clock 116. The unit 180 may comprise a subcomponent of the equipment 102 that comprises separate: software, hardware, firmware, or a combination of these or other technologies. The unit 180 is discussed in greater detail below.<br>
[1026] Although the device 100 is discussed in terms of a wireless mobile unit, the device 100 may be mobile or stationary. Furthermore, the device 100 may comprise a data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel, for example using fiber optic or coaxial cables. In addition to (or instead of) wireless and wire line phones, the device 100 may be configured to implement various other devices including but not limited to PC card, compact flash, external or internal modem, etc.<br>
Error Correction Unit <br>
[1027] As mentioned above, the unit 180 (FIG. IB) serves to recognize and the correct 	temperature induced errors in the operation of the sleep clock 116. The unit 180 may 	comprise one or more logic circuits, discrete circuit elements, application specific 	integrated circuits (ASICs), microprocessors, computers, or other apparatus of the 	same or different technology as the equipment 102.<br><br>
WO 2005/099107                                                             7	PCT/US2005/010438<br>
[1028] To more specifically explain the unit 180, FIG. IC describes a control loop 178. The loop 178 models the operation of the unit 180, rather than describing actual circuit components. At 185 the loop 178 receives a timing error. Rather than seconds or minutes, the timing error in this example is described in terms of parts of CDMA chips. Signal 185 represents the overall error in the duration of the last sleep state, that is, how early or late the last sleep cycle ended, measured in CDMA chips. This error is obtained from the system reacquisition process. In some cases, this error may be on the order of one CDMA chip.<br>
[1029] The error between the estimated and the actual frequency is 183, but this frequency error is not observed directly, only the timing error 185 that results front it. To model the fact that the timing error rather than the frequency error is observed; the frequency error 183 is multiplied by 184b at 184a. This operation is performed naturally, rather than by affirmative acts of circuitry or programming. The following illustrates an example. In this example, the frequency estimate is 600.00 cxl6 per sleep clock cycle (cxl6 is a 16th part of one CDMA chip) and the desired sleep state duration is 1.28s, which is equivalent to 1.28*16*1.2288e6=25165824 cxl6. Here, 25163824cxl6 corresponds to 41943 sleep clock cycles when the estimate of 600.00 cxl6_per_clk is used. Next sleep occurs for that many sleep clock cycles. If the true frequency is 600.01 cxl6 per sleep clock cycle, the phone did not sleep for 25165824 cxl6 as desired, but rather for 41943*600.01cxl6=25166219cxl6 or 1.28002... seconds. Thus when reacquiring the systems an error of 25166219-25165824-=395 cxl6 (approximately 25 chips) is observed.<br>
[1030] To model the generation of the timing error 185, FIG. IC includes the delay 194 (which, models the sleep time), the inaccessible oscillator frequency 182 (which is unknown), and a multiplication 184a by the number of sleep clocks slept 184b.<br>
[1031] Depending on certain factors, a bounding unit 186 selectively limits the error 185 to a prescribed maximum. The issue of whether to bound the signal 185 and what maximum to use is discussed in conjunction with FIG. 5 below.<br>
[1032] Output 187 of the bounding unit 186 is multiplied by a given gain 188 to produce an amplified signal 189. The gain 188 serves to regulate the speed of the loop 178 and maintain it in a stable mode of operation. In one example, an adaptive gain is used for 188. In this example, a gain inversely proportional to the number of sleep clock oscillations slept (exactly one half over the number of oscillations) is used for sleep states greater than 217 sleep clock oscillations, and a fixed gain of 2"18 is used for sleep<br><br>
WO 2005/099107	PCT/US2D05/010438<br>
8<br>
states of 217 and less. The purpose of the adaptive gain is to keep the time-constant of the loop constant for sleep states lasting up to 217 sleep clock oscillations. <br>
[1033] The amplified signal 189 is fed to an accumulator 190, which serves to adjust the 	estimate 193. In other words, a bounded (operation 186) and scaled (multiplication 	188) version of the timing error 185 is added to the estimate 193. This estimate is 	then used to calculate the new sleep duration in terms of sleep clock oscillations. The 	delay 194 models this duration of the sleep state. The difference between the delayed 	estimate 196 and the physical oscillator frequency 182 together with the 	multiplication 184a model the creation of the timing error 185, which arises because 	the estimate 196 of the sleep clock frequency did not match with the actual clock 	frequency 182.<br>
Digital Data Processing Apparatus<br>
[1034] Data processing entities such as components 102,180,116,104 of FIGURES 1B, or any one or more of their subcomponents, may be implemented in various forms. One example is a digital data processing apparatus, as exemplified by the hardware components and interconnections of the digital data processing apparatus 200 of FIG. 2.<br>
[1035] The apparatus 200 includes a processor 202, such as a microprocessor, personal computer, workstation, controller, micro controller, state machine, or other processing machine, coupled to a storage 204. In the present example, the storage 204 includes a fast-access storage 206, as well as nonvolatile storage 208. The fast-access storage 206 may comprise random access memory ("RAM"), and may be used to store the programming instructions executed by the processor 202. The nonvolatile storage 208 may comprise, for example, battery backup RAM, EEPROM, flash PROM, one or more magnetic data storage disks such as a "hard drive",, a tape drive, or any other suitable storage device. The apparatus 200 also includes an input/output 210, such as &amp; line, bus, cable, electromagnetic link, channel, interface, or other means for the processor 202 to exchange data with other hardware external to the apparatus 200.<br>
[1036] Despite the specific foregoing description, ordinarily skilled artisans (having the benefit of this disclosure) will recognize that the apparatus discussed above may be implemented in a machine of different construction, without departing from the scope of the invention. As a specific example, one of the components 206, 208 may be eliminated; furthermore, the storage 204,206, and/or 208 may be provided on-board the processor 20&gt;2, or even provided externally to the apparatus 200.<br><br>
WO 2005/099107                                                       9	PCT/US2005/010438<br>
Logic Circuitry <br>
[1037] In contrast to the digital data processing apparatus discussed above, a different 	embodiment of the invention uses logic circuitry instead of computer-executed 	instructions to implement various processing entities such as those mentioned above. 	Depending upon the particular requirements of the application in the areas of speed, 	expense, tooling costs, and the like, this logic may be implemented by constructing an 	application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) having thousands of tiny integrated 	transistors. Such an ASIC may be implemented with CMOS, TTL, VLSI, or another 	suitable construction. Other alternatives include a digital signal processing chip (DSP), 	discrete circuitry (such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, inductors, and transistors), field 	programmable gate array (FPGA), programmable logic array (PLA), programmable 	logic device (PLD), and the like.<br>
OPERATION<br>
[1038]      Having described various structural features, some operational aspects of the present 	disclosure are now described.<br>
	Signal-Bearing Media <br>
[1039] Wherever any functionality of the present disclosure is implemented using one 	or 	more machine-executed program sequences, such sequences may be embodied in 	various forms of signal-bearing media, in the context of FIG. 2, such a signal-bearing 	media may comprise, for example, the storage 204 or another signal-bearing media, 	such as a removable data storage media 30O (FIG. 3), directly or indirectly accessible by 	a processor 202. Whether contained in the storage 206, media 300, or elsewhere, the 	instructions may be stored on a variety of machine-readable data storage media. Some 	examples include direct access storage (e.g., a conventional "hard drive", redundant 	array of inexpensive disks ("RAID"), or another direct access storage device 	("DASD")), serial-access storage such as magnetic or optical tape, electronic non	volatile memory (e.g., ROM, EPROM, flash PROM, or EEPROM), battery backup 	RAM, optical storage (e.g., CD-ROM, "WORM, DVD, digital optical tape), paper 	"punch" cards, or other suitable signal-bearing media including analog or digital 	transmission media and analog and communication links and wireless communications.<br><br>
WO 2005/099107                                                       10	PCT/US:t005/010438<br>
In an illustrative embodiment of the invention, the machine-readable instructions may comprise software object code, compiled from a language such as assembly language, C, etc.<br>
Logic Circuitry <br>
[1040] In contrast to the signal-bearing medium discussed above, some or all of the present 	disclosure's functionality may be implemented using logic circuitry, instead of using a 	processor to execute instructions. Such logic circuitry is therefore configured to 	perform operations to carry out some or all of the method aspect of this disclosure. The 	logic circuitry may be implemented using many different types of circuitry, as discussed 	above.<br>
	Introduction to Operational Details <br>
[1041] As mentioned above, one operational aspect of tire present disclosure is a process 	that seeks to predict sleep clock operation, accounting for temperature induced errors 	that otherwise might interfere with the accurate timekeeping during a reduced power 	sleep state. Without any limitation, these operational detail are discussed in the context 	of the circuitry of FIG. IB where applicable.<br>
Overall Operating Sequence<br>
[1042] FIG. 4 shows a sequence of operations to conduct sleep/wake operations, including operations to estimate and correct the sleep clock frequency. In step 402, the oscillator frequency is estimated to provide an initial value. The estimate may comprise an estimate of the frequency in Hertz or other units, estimate of the length of one oscillation ("clock cycle") of the sleep clock (i.e., frequency"1), an estimate of another time reference (such as CDMA chips) per sleep clock period, or any other useful comparison. For example, the original estimate may be 600/16 CDMA chips per sleep clock cycle. This estimate may be pre-set at design/manufacture, programmed upon activation of the device 100, established upon acquisition of network signal by the device 100, recalled from nonvolatile memory upon each boot-up of the equipment 102, etc.<br>
[1043] In step 404, components of the device 100 (such as 102, 108, 110, 114, 104, etc.) enter a sleep state for a prescribed duration. The sleep clock 116 is set to wake the equipment 102 at another prescribed time, which is measured in terms of sleep clock<br><br>
WO 2005/099107	PCT7US2005/010438<br>
11<br>
oscillations. In step 406, the sleep clock 116 triggers the equipment 102 to wake at the prescribed time. The performance of steps 404, 406 may be conducted according to techniques that are already well known in the art.<br>
[1044] Next, the sequence 400 performs a correction operation 407, which further includes steps 408, 410, 412. The operation 407 may be performed, for example, according to the control loop 178 of FIG. 1C. Step 407 serves to predict sleep clock frequency accounting for any temperature induced error experienced by the sleep clock during the last sleep state (404). In step 408, the unit 180 measures the error between expected and actual frequencies of the sleep clock 116. This may be determined, for example, by first determining the actual time that the unit 100 awoke (step 406) according to a network-provided time reference signal, then calculating the difference between actual wakeup time and the wakeup time indicated by the sleep clock, and then computing the erroneous frequency of the sleep clock 116 that must have resulted in the incorrect wakeup time.<br>
[1045] In step 410, the unit 180 selectively "bounds" the error measured in step 408. Namely, based on the magnitude of the error and the error history, the unit 180 selectively limits the error to a prescribed maximum value. This helps to eliminate multipath errors from being considered in adjusting the sleep clock for temperature errors. In one example, step 410 uses a predetermine relationship between sleep state duration and predetermined sleep clock error maxima to identify an appropriate maximum error, and selectively limits the current error- to the identified maximum error. FIG. 6 shows an example graph of sleep clock error maxima for different sleep times. The details a bounding routine are discussed in greater detail below, with reference to FIG. 5.<br>
[1046] Next, in step 412 the unit 180 estimates the actual operating frequency of the sleep clock 116 by using the bounded error (from 410). In one embodiment, this is performed by adjusting the previous estimate which arrived from step 402 if the routine 400 is completing for the first time, or otherwise from like last performance of step 412. Although the selection and bounding of errors is novel, the operation of estimating actual operating frequency of sleep clock based on certain measured errors is known in the art, and moreover finds implementation in various commercially available products such as the Verizon model 7135 CDMA phone.<br>
[1047] Having prepared a corrected estimate of the sleep clock 116's operating frequency, step 414 then waits until the equipment 102 signals occurrence of the next sleep state,<br><br>
WO 2005/099107	PCT/DS2005/010438<br>
12-<br>
and when this occurs, returns control to step 404. Accordingly, when step 40)4 is next performed, the equipment 102 utilizes the corrected estimate of the operating frequency (from step 412) when planning the sleep clock value that will match the next wakeup time (406).<br>
Bounding - Specific Example<br>
[1048] FIG. 5 depicts one example of a bounding routine 500 to implement step 410 from FIG. 4. Step 502 initializes a counter to zero. This counter will count the number of times in-a-row that a large error occurs, which is a likely indication of a temperature induced error. Errors due to multipath may not continuously exhibition the same mathematical sign.<br>
[1049] Step 504 receives the "current" error (from step 408). Step 506 compares the error to a given error threshold. If the current error exceeds the error threshold, step 506 proceeds to step 507 (described below). If the current error does not exceed the error threshold, step 506 proceeds to step 508 (also described below), in the illustrated example, the threshold comprises the graph 602 of FIG. 6 (described below). Comparing the current error to the curve 602 ensures that smaller errors (likely to be temperature or noise induced) are routed to steps 508 where they are not bounded, and larger errors (possibly due to multipath) are duly analyzed starting at step 507. For typical sleep times, worst case errors due to temperature-induced oscillator drift are significantly smaller than errors typically caused by changing multipath conditions. The nature of the curve 602 (described below) also ensures that errors that might be due to oscillator switching or similar noise are not bounded, in order to avoid churning.<br>
[1050] As mentioned above, smaller errors are handled by step 508. These errors, since they are small, likely occur due to temperature, noise, or another influence other than multipath. This step (508) resets a consecutive-same-sign-large-error counter to zero, and the current error is not bounded (step 516). This counter comprises a device (not shown) of circuitry, software, firmware, or other technology that is implemented as part of the unit 180 or at least accessible thereto. Since the current error is not bounded in this case, the current error itself is output (522) for use in adjusting the estimate in step 412 (FIG. 4). After step 522, the routine 500 returns to step 504 to receive an error for the next sleep state.<br>
[1051] As for larger errors, these are handled beginning with step 507. Large errors may occur from temperature or noise, as well as multipath. Step 507 asks whether the last<br><br>
WO 2005/099107	PCT/US2005/010438<br>
13<br>
error (from the last sleep state) also exceeded the threshold. If not, the consecutive-same-sign-large-error counter is set to one (step 509), and the current error is limited in step 520. This error (as limited) is then used (522) to estimate the clock frequency. Then, the sequence 500 returns to step 504 to receive the next sleep cycle's error.<br>
[1052] In contrast, if the last error was large, step 510 asks whether the current error varies in mathematical sign from the last error. One mathematical sign is used to describe errors where the sleep clock ran fast over the last sleep state, and the opposite mathematical sign is used to describe errors where the sleep clock ran slow. Therefore, whether an error is greater than zero (one sign) or less than zero (the other sign) indicate whether the last sleep state ended early or late.<br>
[1053] If step 520 finds a sign change, the error could be from multipath or temperature. Accordingly, the counter is reset to zero (step 518) and the current error is bounded (step 520). The reason for bounding the current error in step 520 is to reduce the amount of jitter in the sleep clock's frequency estimate. In the present example, error bounding occurs according to the graph 602 shown in FIG. 6, and described in a greater detail below. After step 520, the current error is output (522) for use in adjusting the estimate in step 412 (FIG. 4). Then, the sequence 500 returns to step 504 to receive the next sleep cycle's error.<br>
[1054] In contrast with the foregoing scenario, step 512 (instead of step 518) is used if step 510 finds that the current error does not vary in sign from the last error that exceeded the error threshold. In this circumstance, the error could be from temperature influence alone, which may be a)confirmed by noting the counter (as discussed in greater detail below). Step 512 increments the counter to record the lack of sign change; in the present example, this is achieved by adding one. Step 514 then asks whether the counter has reached a certain counter threshold. In this example, the counter threshold is set at two, but this number may be varied (manually, adaptively, empirically, or by other means) in order to anticipate more significant multipath problems (by using larger counter thresholds) or more significant temperature changes (by using smaller counter thresholds).<br>
[1055] If the counter has not reached the counter threshold, step 514 proceeds to step 520; the current error could be from multipath or temperature, it is impossible to tell yet. Thus, the error is bounded in step 520, and then step 522 is repeated as discussed above.<br>
[1056] On the other hand, if step 514 finds that the counter has reached the threshold, the error is definitely not due to  multipath,  and presumably due  to temperature.<br><br>
WO 2005/099107                                                       14	PCT/US/005/010438<br>
Accordingly, the error is not limited (step 516), and this value is output (step t&gt;22) fox use in adjusting the estimate in step 412 (FIG. 4). Then, the routine returns to step 504 to receive the error from the next sleep state.<br>
Bounding - Maxima <br>
[1057] FIG. 6 shows a graph 600 to illustrate one embodiment for bounding maxima to be 	used in step 520. The horizontal axis represents sleep time and the vertical axis 	represents temperature induced sleep clock error. Boundary 608 illustrates a 	theoretical, worst-case temperature drift scenario developed through research and 	discovery of the present inventors. Boundary 602 illustrates a modified representation 	of the boundary 608, including portions 604, 606. Portion 606 is a linear 	approximation of the boundary 608 above an error threshold 605, implemented to 	conserve computational resources by using a mathematically simpler linear limit. 	Portion 604 is a base minimum, which purposefully does not follow the theoretical 	boundary 608. Namely, the portion 604 is established with a sufficiently high value to 	avoid bounding errors that are probably caused by noise, the switching process of the 	sleep clock 116, or other sources unrelated to temperature errors. The imposition of 	portion 604 thereby prevents churning, jitter, and excessive analysis of unpredictable 	and probably irrelevant errors.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
"Networked Wireless Communications Device Programmed to Identify and Eliminate Probable Multi path Errors to Enhance Accuracy in Correcting Sleep Clock for<br>
Thermally Induced Errors"<br>
A method for correcting operation of the sleep oscillator (116) of a wireless communications device (100). Sleep oscillator frequency is estimated (412) so as to compensate for estimated temperature induced errors. In estimating temperature induced errors, errors (504) in sleep oscillator frequency are treated as being temperature induced errors (522), but probable multi path errors are bounded (410,520) to predetermined sleep clock error maxima (602) corresponding    to    sleep    duration    over    which    the    error    occurred.<br></td>
