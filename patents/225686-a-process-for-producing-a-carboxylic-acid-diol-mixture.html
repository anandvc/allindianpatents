				<td>The present invention relates of a process for producing a carboxylic acid/diol mixture.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process by which a carboxylic acid/diol mixture is obtained from a decolorized carboxylic acid solution without isolation of a substantially dry carboxylic acid solid. More specifically, the present invention relates to a process by which a terephthalic acid/ethylerie glycol mixture suitable as a starting material for polyester production is. obtained from a decolorized terephthalic acid solution without isolation of a substantially dry terephthalic acid solid.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thermoplastic polyesters are step growth polymers that are useful when made to high molecular weights. The first step in a common method of producing a polyester such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is an esferification or ester-exchange stage where a diacid (typically terephthalic acid) reacts with an appropriate diol (typically ethylene glycol) to give a bis(h.ydroxyalkyl)ester and some linear oligomers. Water is evolved at this stage and is usually removed by fractional distillation.<br>
Pursuant to the goal of making polyethylene terephthalate and other polyesters, a great deal of patent literature is dedicated to the describing processes for preparing terephthalic acid/ethylene glycol<br><br>
mixtures suitable as starting material. In general, these inventions describe specific mixing schemes with a purified terephthalic acid solid and liquid ethylene glycol as starting materials. Additionally, there is substantial body of literature devoted to producing a purified terephthalic acid in the powder form that is suitable for use in producing PET. The objective of this invention is to describe a process by which a terephthalic acid/ethylene glycol mixture suitable as starting material for polyester production is obtained from a decolorized terephthalic acid solution without isolation of a substantially dry terephthalic acid solid.<br>
A number of processes for producing the purified terephthalic acid solid have been developed and are commercially available. Usually, the purified terephthalic acid solid is produced in a multi-step process .wherein a crude terephthalic acid is produced. The crude terephthalic acid does not have sufficient quality for direct use as starting material in commercial PET. Instead, the crude terephthalic acid is usually refined to purified terephthalic acid solid.<br>
Liquid phase oxidation of p-xylene produces crude terephthalic acid. The crude terephthalic acid is dissolved in water and hydrogenated for the purpose of converting 4-carboxybenzaldehyde to p-toluic acid, which is a more water-soluble derivative, and for the purpose of converting characteristically yellow compounds to colorless derivatives. Any 4»carboxybenza!dehyde and p-toluic acid in the final purified terephthalic acid product is particularly detrimental to polymerization processes as they act as a chain terminator during the condensation reaction between terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol in<br><br>
the production of PET. Typical purified terephthalic acid contains on a weight basis less than 25 parts per million (ppm) 4-carboxybenzaidehyde and less than. 150 ppm p-toluic acid.<br>
The crude terephthalic acid typically contains on a weight basis from 800 to 7,000 parts per million (ppm) 4-carboxybenzaldehyde and 200 to 1,500 ppm p-toluic acid as the main impurities. The crude terephthalic acid also contains lesser amounts, 20-200 ppm range, of yellow color aromatic compounds having the structures of benzil, fluorenone, and/or anthraquinone, which are characteristically yellow compounds as impurities resulting from coupling side reactions occurring during oxidation of p-xylene.   It is necessary to purify the crude terephthalic acid when using it as a starting material for producing polyester fiber, which requires a purified terephthalic acid as a starting material.<br>
Such a purification process typically comprises adding water to the crude terephthalic acid to form a crude terephthalic acid solution, which is heated to dissolve the crude terephthalic acid. The crude terephthalic acid solution is then passed to a reactor zone in which the solution is contacted with hydrogen in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst at temperatures of 200° to 375° C. This reduction step converts .the various color bodies present in the crude terephthalic acid to colorless products. The principal impurity, 4-carbpxyber4zaldehyde, is converted to p-toluic acid.<br>
Typical crude terephthalic acid contains excessive amounts of both 4-carboxybenzaldehyde and p-toluic acid on a weight basis.<br><br>
Therefore, to achieve less than 25 ppmw 4-carboxybenzaldehyde and less than 150 ppmw p-toluic acid in the purified terephthalic acid requires mechanisms for purifying the crude terephthalic acid and removing the contaminants.<br>
Subsequent separation and isolation of the purified terephthalic acid can be accomplished via a wide variety of separation methods including crystallization, centrifugation, filtration, extraction and combinations thereof followed by drying. These processes are described in U.S. patents 4,500,732; 5,175,355; and 5,583,254; all of which are herein incorporated by reference. It Is necessary to perform a separation step" due the nature of the crude terephthaiic acid feedstock to the hydrogenation process.<br>
A number of processes have been developed for producing a purified terephthalic acid solid from crude terephthalic acid. In general, the common features among these processes are as follows:<br>
Step (1) is decolonization of the crude terephthalic acid usually via hydrogenation treatment in an aqueous medium;<br>
Step (2) is purification/separation of the terephthalic acid from partial oxidation products usually via fractional crystallization followed by liquor exchange with contaminant-free water; and<br>
Step (3) is production of a solid purified terephthalic acid product with consistent material handling properties usually via-crystallization of terephthalic acid followed by drying of purified terephthalic acid from water.<br><br>
The resultant purified terephthalic acid powder along with ethylene glycol are starting materials in the production of polyesters specifically PET. Because the difficulty in handling, mixing, and dissolving terephthalic acid solids,'the purified terephthalic acid solid is usually mixed with ethylene glycol to form a paste prior to introduction into an esterification reactor system.<br>
In the present invention, a novel process has been discovered resulting in fewer steps than the currently employed processes. The primary utility of the invention is reduction of capital and operating costs associated with the isolation of a terephthalic acid powder. In the conventional approach toward producing "terephthalic acid, the post-hydrogenated aqueous solution is passed to a series of crystallizer vessels for the purpose of purifying the terephthalic acid by crystallization and for the purpose of obtaining a uniform particle size distribution necessary for good flowability of purified terephthalic powder. Further, the p-toluic acid contaminated mother liquor from the crystallization process must be removed prior to a drying step .to isolate the purified terephthalic powder.<br>
In on embodiment of the present invention, the crude terephthalic acid solution with low concentrations of p-toluic acid and 4-. carboxybenzaldehyde is hydrogenated to form a decolorized terephthalic acid solution. Starting with crude terephthalic acid with low concentrations of the p-toluic acid and 4-carboxybenzaldehyde<br>
t<br>
eliminates the need for separation of p-toluic acid-contaminated mother liquor from the terephthalic acid. Hence, the decolorized terephthalic<br><br>
acid solution can be directly combined with ethylene glycol in an esterification zone to produce a terephthalic acid/ethylene glycol mixture. By bypassing conventional processes for producing a purified terephthalic acid powder, the need for the equipment necessary to purify and isolate purified terephthalic powder is eliminated.<br>
Another surprising and seemingly contradictory aspect of the invention is the benefits of addition of large amounts of water to the esterification reaction starting materials. This is directly contrary to accepted esterification procedures. The esterification reaction:<br>
RCOOH + R'OH •» RCOOR1 + H20<br>
is generally not complete". The water formed in the course of the reaction tends to react with the ester to hydrolyze it, i.e. to regenerate the original alcohol and acid. In order to drive the reaction toward the ester, the prior art teaches removal of water from the system by a variety of methods such as distillation or dehydration with a hydrophilic compound. According to .conventional esterification procedures, it is non-intuitive to add large amount of the water to the acid/alcohol starting material.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present Invention relates to a process by which a carboxylic<br>
acid/diol mixture is obtained from a decolorized carboxylic acid solution without isolation of a substantially dry carboxylic acid solid. More specifically, the present invention relates to a process for the production of a terephthalic acid/ethylene glycol mixture suitable as feedstock for<br><br>
the production of commercial PET. The resulting process has fewer steps than currently employed processes and can be operated at lower operating cost and constructed at lower capital cost. Specifically, the present invention incorporates a direct displacement of water with ethylene glycol step following hydrogenation treatment of crude terephthalic acid. Incorporation .of the displacement step eliminates the need to isolate a purified terephthalic acid solid thereby eliminating the need for crystallization, solid-liquid separation, and solids handling equipment normally found in commercial purified terephthalic acid processes.<br>

The esterification reactor zone, the decolorized carboxylic acid solution and a process to produce the decolorized carboxylic acid solution is described subsequently in a second embodiment of this invention.<br>
In the second embodiment of this itwentiorv a process for producing a carboxylic acid/diol mixture is provided as shown in Figure #1.<br><br>
Step (1) comprises mixing a crude carboxylic acid powder in conduit 105 with water in conduit 115 in a mixing zone 110 to form a crude .carboxylic acid solution in conduit 120; Typically, the carboxylic acid is selected from a group consisting of terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, and mixtures thereof. The mixing of the crude carboxylic powder in conduit 105 with water in conduit 115 in the mixing zone .110 can be accomplished by any means known in the art. The mixing zone 110 can be any vessel or equipment capable of mixing the crude carboxylic acid powder. The temperature and pressure of the mixing zone 110 is that which is sufficient to properly slurry the crude carboxylic acid powder fn conduit" 105 with water in conduit 115. Typically, the crude carboxylic acid powder in conduit 105 is slurried with water in conduit 115 in mixing zone. 110 at a concentration of 15-35% by weight.<br>
Step (2) is decolorizing the crude carboxylic acid solution in conduit 120 in a reactor zone 125 to produce a decolorized carboxylic acid solution 135.<br>
The decolorizing of the crude carboxylic acid solution in conduit 120 can be accomplished by any means known in the art. Preferably, the decolorizing can be accomplished by reacting the crude carboxylic acid solution in conduit 120 with hydrogen in conduit 130 in the presence of a catalyst in a reactor zone 125 to produce a decolorized carboxylic solution.<br>
For the reactor zone 125, there are no special limitations in the form or construction thereof, subject to an arrangement that allows<br><br>
supply of hydrogen in conduit 130 to effect intimate contact of the crude carboxylic acid solution in conduit 120 with the catalyst in the reactor zone 125. Typically, the catalyst is usually a single Group VIII metal or combination of Group VIII metals. Preferably, the catalyst is selected from a group consisting of palladium, ruthenium, rhodium and combination thereof.   Most preferably, the catalyst is palladium. Typically, the catalyst is supported, preferably on porous carbon.<br>
The reactor zone 125 comprises a hydrogenation reactor that operates at a temperature and pressure sufficient to hydrogenate the characteristically yellow compounds in the crude carboxylic acid solution in conduit 120. By hydrogenation treatment, the characteristically yellow compounds in the crude carboxylic acid solution are converted to colorless derivatives. The b* color of in the decolorized carboxylic acid solution in conduit 135 is between 0.5 to 4. Preferably the b* color of the carboxylic acid solution in conduit 135 is between 0.5 to 2.0. Most preferably the b* color in the carboxylic solution in conduit 135 is between 0.5 to 1.5. The b* is one of the three-color attributes .measured on a spectroscoplc reflectance-based instrument. The color can be measure by any device known in the art. A Hunter Ultrascan XE instrument is typically the measuring device. Positive readings signify .the degree of yellow (or absorbance of blue), while negative readings signify the degree of blue (or absqr-banoe of yellow).<br>
The fiydrogen in conduit 130 is fed at a rate sufficient to convert the characteristically yellow compounds in the crude carboxylic slurry in<br><br>
conduit 120 to colorless derivatives; wherein the b* color is between 0.5 to 4.0 in the decolorized carboxylic acid solution in conduit 135<br>
. Step (3) comprises, optionally, flashing the decolorized carboxylic<br>
acid solution 135 in a flashing zone 145 to remove a portion of the water<br>
from the decolorized carboxylic acid solution in conduit 135. The<br>
flashing of the aqueous carboxylic solution 135 can be accomplished by<br>
any means know in the art. Typically, a vessel or a plurality of vessels<br>
are used to accomplish the flashing. In the flashing zone 145, water and<br>
residual hydrogen can be removed as a vapor via conduit 150. The<br>
flash vessel(s) operate at a temperature sufficient to remove a portion of<br>
-the water. Alternatively, flashing ~zbne 145 can be omitted as indicated<br>
by conduit 140.	.<br>
Step (4) comprises, adding a diol in conduit 170 to the decolorized carboxylic acid solution in conduit 155. A portion of the water via conduit 165 is removed from an esterification reactor zone 160 to form said carboxyfic acid/diol mixture in the esterification reactor zone 160. The carboxylic acid and diol subsequently reacts to form a hydroxyalkyester stream 175.. The hydroxyalkyester stream 175 comprises a hydroxyalky ester compound.<br>
The diol in conduit 170 is introduced in such a manner as to displace the water as the dominant slurrying liquid. This can be accomplished by introdueing a did via-conduit 170 as a saturated liquid at a temperature which is sufficient to vaporize the water. Preferably, the diol in conduit 170 is introduced as a saturated or superheated vapor. The diol in conduit 170 is selected from the group consisting of<br><br>
ethylene glycot, diethylene glycol, n-butyiene glycol, i-butylene glycol, n-propylene glycol, 1,4 butanediol, cyclohexanedimethanol, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the diol in conduit 170 isethylene glycol. Alternatively, an external heat source can be used to introduce sufficient enthalpy to vaporize the water, which exits via conduit 165. The hydroxalky ester stream exits via conduit stream 175.<br>
The esterification reactor zone 160 operates at a temperature that is sufficient to produce a hydroxyethyt from the carboxylic acid mixture. The esterification reactor zone 160 comprises an esterification reactor. The esterification can be accomplished by any means know in the art.<br>
In a'tfiird embodiment" of this invention a process for producing a terephthalic acid/diol comprises vaporizing a decolorized terephthalic acid solution with a diol in an esterification reactor zone to remove a portion of the water to form the terephthalic acid/diol mixture; wherein the terephthalic acid and diol subsequently reacts in the esterification zone to form a hydroxyalky ester stream.<br>
The esterification reactor zone, the decolorized terephthalic acid solution and a process to produce the decolorized terephthalic acid solution is described subsequently in a fourth embodiment of this invention.<br>
in the forth embodiment of this invention a process for producing aterepnthaHc aejd/diol mixture is provided as shown in Figure #2.<br>
Step (1) comprises mixing a crude terephthalic acid powder in conduit 205 with water in conduit 215 in a mixing zone 210 to form a crude terephthalic acid solution in conduit 220. The mixing of the crude<br><br>
terephthalic powder in conduit 205 with water in conduit 215 can be accomplished by any means known in the art. The starting feed material is the crude terephthalic acid powder in conduit 205 with some specific physical characteristics that differ from crude terephthalic add described in U.S. Patent 5,095,146 and U.S: Patent 5,175,355, herein incorporated by reference. Specifically, the total amount of p-toluic acid and 4-carboxybenzaldehyde in the crude terephthalic acid powder in conduit 205 is less than 900 ppm on a weight basis, preferably, less than 500 ppm, and most preferably, less than 250 ppm.  Another characteristic of the crude terephthalic powder in conduit 205 is the color as measured by *,„ b*ls less fJiahT". "Preferably, the color measured by b* is between 4 and 6.<br>
The mixing zone 210 can be. any vessel or equipment capable of mixing the crude terephthalic acid powder in conduit 205 with water in conduit 215. The crude terephthalic acid powder in conduit 205 is slurried in water in conduit 215 in the mixing zone 210 to produce the crude terephthalic acid solution in conduit 220.
