AN ISOSTATIC DIE FOR TILE FORMING<br>
The invention relates to dies for forming ceramic tiles and, more in particular,<br>
an isostatic die destined to be associated to forming cavities of one or more<br>
dies.<br>
As is known, usual ceramic dies comprise a forming cavity for containing the<br>
powder ceramic material, which cavity is delimited by a lateral containing<br>
matrix in which a bottom die is slidable received, which bottom die<br>
collaborates with a top die in order to coin the flat opposite surfaces of the<br>
tile.<br>
The pressing operation often leads to producing a defective finished tile,<br>
sometimes gravely defective, the problems depending on various factors.<br>
One of these factors is the irregular distribution of the ceramic powders<br>
internally of the forming cavity of the die, which is manifested in a non-<br>
homogeneous density in the unfired tile.<br>
This lack of homogeneity leads to differentiated heat dilation in the tile during<br>
the firing stage and corresponding uneven shrinkage during the cooling<br>
stage, which cause various size, shape and planarity defects, sometimes<br>
even resulting in breakage and/or cracking.<br>
To obviate this problem, the technical field offers the use of dies known as<br>
isostatic.<br>
Isostatic dies comprise a metal body provided with an active surface destined<br>
to face towards the inside of the die forming cavity.<br>
The active surface is provided with a concentric cavity which is superiorly<br>
closed by an elastic membrane, which is anchored to the metal body at a<br>
plurality of predetermined zones and which is destined to contact the mass of<br>
ceramic powders in order to coin one of the flat surfaces of the tile.<br>
The above-mentioned concentric cavity is filled with an incompressible fluid<br>
under pressure, which inflates the elastic membrane at the zones in which<br><br>
-2-<br>
the membrane is not anchored to the metal body, giving the membrane an<br>
overall lumpy appearance.<br>
During pressing, the zones of the elastic membrane which act where there is<br>
a greater density of ceramic powders are squeezed and push the<br>
incompressible fluid so that it more greatly inflates the zones where there is a<br>
lower density of the material.<br>
In this way the pressure the membrane applies to compact the mass of<br>
ceramic powders is constant and the density of the tile being pressed is<br>
therefore homogeneous.<br>
However, during the closure of the die the air contained in the forming cavity<br>
must necessarily flow towards the outside.<br>
In the ceramics sector this stage is usually called the degassing stage, and it<br>
is necessary in order to prevent grave defects from appearing in the finished<br>
ceramic product, deriving from the presence of residual trapped air in the<br>
pressed unfired tile.<br>
These defects, which can often be identified only in a relatively advanced<br>
stage of tile production, can lead to a total rejection of the product with<br>
obvious economic losses.<br>
During the degassing stage, the flow of air is generally directed from the<br>
centre of the forming cavity towards the periphery thereof, where it exits by<br>
passing into the space (usually a few tenths of millimetres) between the edge<br>
of the dies and the lateral containing matrix.<br>
A current of air is thus established, which causes a displacement of the<br>
ceramic powders, which then accumulate at the sides of the forming cavity<br>
and become less concentrated in the centre of the cavity.<br>
For this reason, the central zones of the elastic membrane of the isostatic die<br>
are, at each cycle, inflated more than the peripheral zones, which leads to<br>
their very rapid deterioration.<br>
In particular, this phenomenon is very relevant in isostatic dies for realising<br>
large-format tiles, where the degassing of the forming cavity produces,<br>
especially if done at too-fast speeds, differences of powder distribution so<br>
accentuated that they can even cause explosion and breakage of the elastic<br><br>
-3-<br>
membrane. A further drawback in pressing ceramic tiles is therefore the time<br>
required to make sure that all the air present in the forming cavity completely<br>
exits, thus achieving perfect degassing.<br>
This means considerably slowing down the die closure time, or sub-dividing<br>
the pressing operation into two successive stages, introducing a pause in<br>
work which negatively influences plant productivity.<br>
A further drawback consists in the fact that the wear on the ceramic dies is<br>
mainly determined by the already-mentioned flow of degassing air, which,<br>
being concentrated between the edges of the dies and the containing matrix,<br>
means replacing these components even if they are only worn at their<br>
peripheral parts.<br>
The aim of the invention is at least partially to obviate the above-described<br>
drawbacks.<br>
In particular, an aim is to prevent the air in the forming cavity from remaining<br>
imprisoned inside the pressed tiles, thus simultaneously avoiding<br>
deterioration and/or explosion of the elastic membrane, the rapid wearing of<br>
the ceramic dies, and increasing plant productivity.<br>
A further aim of the invention is to attain these objectives while providing a<br>
solution which is simple, rational and inexpensive.<br>
The aim is attained by the invention as it is characterised in the appended<br>
claims.<br>
In particular, an isostatic die is provided which comprises a metal body and<br>
an elastically deformable membrane which is solidly constrained to the metal<br>
body at a plurality of distinct predetermined fixing zones, such that a<br>
hermetically-sealed intermediate chamber is delimited between the elastic<br>
membrane and the metal body, which intermediate chamber can contain an<br>
incompressible fluid.<br>
According to the invention, rigid bushings are sunk into the elastic<br>
membrane, each of which bushings defines a breather mouth, having<br>
predetermined dimensions and being substantially non-deformable, which<br>
mouth is sunk into the thickness of the elastic membrane and communicates<br><br>
-4-<br>
with the outside through a system of discharge conduits afforded in the metal<br>
body.<br>
Each rigid bushing is located at a fixing zone of the elastic membrane to the<br>
metal body, such as not to compromise the seal of the incompressible fluid<br>
chamber, enabling correct functioning of the isostatic compensating pressing<br>
system.<br>
Further, as the fixing zones of the elastic membrane do not deform during<br>
pressing, the rigid bushings are not subject to undesired displacement which<br>
might compromise communication of the breather mouths with the system of<br>
discharge conduits, which guide the air towards the outside.<br>
According to the invention, each single rigid bushing receives a respective<br>
obturator body, which enables passage of the air and at least partially<br>
prevents passage of the ceramic powder.<br>
For example the obturator body can be constituted by a compact body<br>
conformed such as only partially to obstruct the relative breather mouth,<br>
leaving a thin fissure open having a size which lets the air through but limits<br>
to a minimum the amount of ceramic powder which can pass through.<br>
Thanks to this solution, during the closure of the ceramic die, the air<br>
contained in the forming cavity can freely flow internally of the breather<br>
mouths and exit to the outside through the system of discharge conduits<br>
afforded in the metal body of the die.<br>
The addition of the breather mouths thus considerably increases the overall<br>
surface of die through which the air can flow outwards (which in the prior art<br>
was limited to the perimeter fissure located between the die and the forming<br>
matrix), and effectively enables the air to exit also from the centre of the<br>
forming cavity, through the die tile-forming surfaces.<br>
In this way, the flow of air from the centre towards the periphery of the<br>
forming cavity is eliminated or at least significantly reduced, which flow of air<br>
can cause undesired re-distribution of the ceramic powders and rapid wear of<br>
the die at its peripheral zones.<br><br>
-5-<br>
In a first embodiment of the invention, each obturator body is stably fixed to<br>
the metal body of the isostatic die, such as always to be stationary internally<br>
of the relative rigid bushing, preferably in a line with the die active face.<br>
This embodiment further comprises the totality of the breather conduits being<br>
connected to a blower device, which is activated at the end of the pressing<br>
cycle to inject compressed air therein.<br>
In this way, the compressed air injected into the discharge conduits will tend<br>
to exit from the breather mouths, projecting the ceramic powder which may<br>
be trapped inside the fissure left between the obturator bodies and the<br>
relative breather mouths towards the forming cavity.<br>
Owing to these jets of air exiting from the breather mouths, the above-<br>
described solution can however exhibit the drawback of raising a large<br>
quantity of powder into the zones surrounding the ceramic die, making the<br>
surrounding environment unpleasant for the personnel.<br>
To obviate this drawback a second and preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention is provided.<br>
In the second embodiment, each obturator body slides internally of the<br>
relative rigid bushing, with an alternating motion in the direction of the<br>
bushing axis.<br>
In particular, this embodiment comprises each obturator body being fixed to<br>
an end of a respective valve stem, which is activated to slide internally of a<br>
guide hole afforded in the metal body of the isostatic die, behind the relative<br>
rigid bushing.<br>
Thanks to this solution, the obturator body is positioned in line with the active<br>
surface of the die during the pressing stage, and when the die opens, it is<br>
made to slide towards the inside of the forming cavity, such as to remove the<br>
powder which might be trapped in the fissure between the obturator body and<br>
the rigid bushing during the tile forming.<br>
It can however occur that after repeated pressing cycles a certain quantity of<br>
ceramic powder invades the breather mouths and accumulates in the<br>
discharge conduits, obsructing them and preventing de-gassing of the<br>
forming cavity.<br><br>
-6-<br>
To prevent this from happening and causing a production halt of the ceramic<br>
die, the invention comprises the totality of discharge conduits being<br>
connected to a special aspirating device.<br>
The aspirating device is activated each time the die has completed a<br>
relatively high number (which is however always compatible with the<br>
production requirements) of pressing cycles, such as to clean the discharge<br>
conduits by aspirating the ceramic powder contained therein.<br>
Preferably the aspirating action of the aspirating device is added to by a<br>
similar blower device to the one used in the first preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, but which injects compressed air at a generally lower pressure.<br>
The blower device is set in communication with the totality of the discharge<br>
conduits at different points with respect to the aspirating device, and injects<br>
air internally of the conduits in order to push the ceramic powder<br>
accumulated therein towards the mouth of the apirating device itself.<br>
At this point note that the solutions provided by the invention are also very<br>
well suited to use with an isostatic die equipped with an anti-transparency<br>
system.<br>
The phenomenon of "transparency" consists in the fact that on the front<br>
surface (in view) of the tiles, there can remain a slight trace of the underlying<br>
feet of the laying surface, which causes the finished product to be classed as<br>
a second.<br>
The above-described isostatic dies with anti-transparency system comprise a<br>
metal body in which a hollowed out part is afforded, having a grid plan shape<br>
in which a complementarily-shaped grid is housed which is more rigid than<br>
the elastic membrane, and which is interposed between the elastic<br>
membrane and the incompressible fluid chamber.<br>
In these dies, the elastic membrane is strongly gripped to the metal body in<br>
the zones comprised between the links of the lowered grid, and a rigid<br>
bushing can be sunk at exactly those zones therein in order to realise the<br>
degassing system of the invention.<br><br>

Figures from 1 to 7 show a die 1 destined to be associated to a ceramic<br>
press for coining a lower or laying surface of tiles.<br>
The die 1 comprises a metal body 2 with a rectangular plan shape, formed by<br>
three superposed plates which are fixed by screws, of which a front plate<br>
200, an intermediate plate 201 and a back plate 202 (see figure 4).<br>
The metal body 2 exhibits an active face 20 destined to face towards the<br>
forming cavity of the ceramic press to which the die 1 will be associated.<br>
As shown in figure 4, a rectangular first concentric hollow 21 with a constant<br>
depth is afforded on the active face 20, which hollow 21 is connected to the<br>
external edge of the metal body 2 by means of a countersunk perimeter strip<br>
22.<br>
A second concentric hollow 23 is afforded on the bottom of the first hollow<br>
21, which second hollow 23 has a constant depth which in plan view<br>
generally exhibits a regular grid shape (see figure 2).<br>
In particular, the grid 23 comprises a plurality of cells 24' which are uniformly<br>
distributed and which are reciprocally connected by means of straight<br>
channels 24".<br>
In plan view the cells 24' are generally square with longer sides than the<br>
width of the straight channels 24".<br>
In this way, a plurality of generally cross-shaped relief zones are defined<br>
between the cells 24', a top of which is at the same level as the bottom of the<br>
first hollow 21.<br>
Finally, a third hollow 26 is afforded on the bottom of the second hollow 23,<br>
which third hollow 26 is formed by a grid having straight, reciprocally<br>
perpendicular channels.<br>
The straight channels are narrower than the channels 24" of the second<br>
hollow 23, and develop along the channels 24" such as to groove and cross<br>
each single cell 24'.<br><br>
-9-<br>
A grid 3 made of an elastically deformable material, which is separately<br>
prepared, is positioned internally of the second hollow 23.<br>
As illustrated in figure 3, the grid 3 has a shape which is similar to the grid of<br>
the second hollow 23 of the metal body 2, such as to be received snugly<br>
internally thereof.<br>
In particular, the grid 3 comprises a plurality of forms 30 which<br>
corresponding to the cells 24' and which are joined by straight tracts 31<br>
which correspond to the channels 24".<br>
The grid 3 has a constant thickness which is slightly less than the depth of<br>
the second hollow 23, and is preferably made of an elastomer material.<br>
In transversal section, the grid 3 comprises a first layer which is inserted<br>
snugly internally of the second hollow 23 of the metal body 2 in contact with<br>
the bottom thereof, on which is laid a second layer having a same shape with<br>
a smaller width (see figure 4).<br>
The face of the grid 3 in contact with the bottom of the second hollow 23<br>
closes the channels of the third hollow 26, such as to define a free space<br>
which in plan view is a labyrinth grid.<br>
A plurality of vertical holes 4 are afforded in the metal body 2, each of which<br>
vertical holes 4 centrally crosses a respective cross-zone 25 and opens onto<br>
the bottom of the first hollow 21.<br>
A guide bushing 5 made of wear-resistant hard material is press-inserted, or<br>
inserted using other known fitting systems, internally of each vertical hole 4.<br>
The bushing is provided with a head 50 having a greater diameter which<br>
projects with respect to the bottom of the first hollow 21, and a top of which is<br>
generally in line with the upper edge of the metal body 2.<br>
In particular, the projecting head 50 exhibits an undercut circumferential<br>
channel 51 along the lateral surface thereof.<br>
The internal cavity 52 of each guide bushing 5 defines a breather mouth<br>
which sets the relative vertical hole 4 in communication with the outside.<br>
Note that the rigid guide bushings 5 could alternatively be in a single piece<br>
together with the metal body 2, for example in the form of further salient<br>
appendages rising up from the cross zone 25.<br><br>
-10-<br>
As illustrated in figure 4, each vertical hole 4 is in communication with a<br>
system of horizontal discharge conduits 9 (denoted by a broken line in figure<br>
1) which are afforded in the front plate 200 of the metal body 2 and which<br>
open out to the outside through the lateral walls thereof.<br>
After the guide bushings 5 and the grid 3 have been coupled to the metal<br>
body 2, a layer of a mastic or of a suitable adhesive glue is applied on the<br>
metal body 2.<br>
In particular, the layer of mastic is laid on the bottom of the first hollow 21, on<br>
the perimeter strip 22, on the portions of the lateral walls of the channels 24"<br>
and the cells 24' not covered by the grid 3, on the free faces of the grid 3 and<br>
on the lateral surface of the projecting heads 50 of the guide bushings 5.<br>
Thus, internally of the first hollow 21 a fluid resin normally used in the sector<br>
is dropped, which, after hardening, realises an elastically-deformable<br>
membrane 6.<br>
In this way, the posterior face of the elastic membrane 6 exhibits a grid in<br>
relief which is sealedly coupled internally of the grid 23 of the metal body 2.<br>
Further, it also exhibits a series of through-holes, each of which receives the<br>
projecting head 50 of a respective guide bushing 5 and is provided with a<br>
circumferential rib 60 which couples to the undercut channel 51 and solidly<br>
anchors the guide bushing 5 to the membrane 6.<br>
During forming, a grid of identical crossed channels 62 is formed on the<br>
external active face 61 of the membrane 6, which crossed channels 62 are<br>
for shaping the feet of the tiles (see figure 1).<br>
In particular, the crosspoints of the crossed channels 62 are vertically<br>
superposed on the cross-zones 25 of the metal body 2, and are identified by<br>
a series of prominences 63 having a generally circular plan shape.<br>
A relative guide bushing 5 is located at the centre of each prominence 63, a<br>
top of which bushing 5 is in line with the top of the prominence 63.<br>
Thanks to the mastic, the elastic membrane 6 is strongly gripped to all the<br>
parts of the metal body 2, the grid 3 and the guide bushings 5, on which the<br>
mastic has been previously applied.<br><br>
-11-<br>
Note that the grid 3 and the elastic membrane 6 are constituted by elastomer<br>
resins having generally different elastic characteristics. Preferably the resin of<br>
the elastic membrane 6 is more elastic and flexible than that of the grid 3<br>
which is therefore more rigid.<br>
A cylindrical valve body 7 is slidably housed in each guide bushing 5, which<br>
valve body 7 partially obstructs the breather mouth 52, leaving a small fissure<br>
communicating with the underlying vertical hole 4.<br>
The small fissure is of an entity such as to enable passage of the air, while it<br>
effectively obstructs any leaking of the ceramic powder, which is compacted<br>
during the forming of the tiles.<br>
The opening can be obtained by realising the cylindrical valve body 7 with a<br>
slightly smaller diameter with respect to the breather mouth 52 of the guide<br>
bushing 5, for example by specially calibrating the working tolerances.<br>
For example, the diameter of the cylindrical valve body 7 can be made less<br>
by about 0.2 mm than the diameter of the breather mouth 52.<br>
Each valve body 7 is borne at the end of a stem 70 which is slidable<br>
internally of the vertical hole 4, the posterior end of which is associated to<br>
respective means for activating which cause the posterior end to slide at<br>
each pressing cycle.<br>
The means for activating comprise a brass plate 71 fixed to the posterior end<br>
of the stem 70 and slidably received internally of a cylindrical seating 41<br>
which is afforded in the intermediate plate 201 of the metal body 2,<br>
posteriorly with respect to the discharge conduit 9.<br>
In particular, the cylindrical seating 41 is arranged coaxially of the hole 4 and<br>
has a greater diameter with respect to the width of the discharge conduit 9.<br>
A seal ring 72 is placed between the plate 71 and the lateral wall of the<br>
cylnidrical seating 41, while a dust ring 73 is located between the lateral wall<br>
of the cylindrical seating 41 and the stem 70, which dust ring 73 rests on the<br>
edges of the discharge conduit 9.<br>
A compression spring 74 is interposed between the dust ring 73 and the plate<br>
71, which spring 74 maintains the valve body 7 in the rest position illustrated<br>
in figure 4.<br><br>
-12-<br>
In this position the valve body 7 is in line with the top of the guide bushing 5<br>
and thus also with the prominence 63 of the elastic membrane 6, while the<br>
plate 71 is at the posterior endrun position.<br>
As illustrated in figure 4, each cylindrical seating 41 opens internally of a<br>
back-lying conduit 8, which conduit 8 is afforded in the posterior plate 202 of<br>
the metal body 2, and is destined to convey a pressurised operating fluid,<br>
generally compressed air, which is supplied by a usual dispenser device (not<br>
shown).<br>
The operating fluid acts on the face of the plate 71 opposite the compression<br>
spring 74, such as to push the stem 70 and cause the valve body to extend<br>
completely with respect to the active face 61 of the elastic membrane 6.<br>
In this embodiment, the conduit 8 places all the cylindrical seatings 41 of the<br>
die 1 in reciprocal communication, such that the activating of the valve bodies<br>
7 occurs contemporaneously; however it is possible to connect the cylindrical<br>
seatings 41 via independent conduits in order to activate different valve<br>
bodies 7 on different areas of the die 1 according to need.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment of figures 6 and 7, the die 1 is associated to a<br>
entering punch-type die 10 for forming ceramic tiles.<br>
In particular, the die 1 is destined to form a laying face of the tiles and is<br>
located superiorly of a die 11 of a traditional type, which is destined to form<br>
the in-view face of the tile.<br>
Obviously the invention is well suited to other types of press, for example a<br>
mobile matrix press. Further, the arrangement of the dies 1, 11 can be<br>
different from what is illustrated, as can their shape and function. In<br>
particular, with slight modifications the die 1 could be used for forming the in-<br>
view face of the tiles.<br>
Before installing the dies in the press 10, the free space formed by the<br>
channels 26 covered by the grid 3 is filled with an incompressible fluid,<br>
generally pressurised hydraulic oil, and is then sealedly closed.<br>
The introduction of oil is done by special conduits such as those indicated<br>
with a broken line and denoted by 13 in figure 1.<br><br>
-13-<br>
The introduction of the pressurised oil leads to corresponding elastic<br>
deformations of the grid 3 and the elastic membrane 6 (see figure 5).<br>
In particular, at the cells 24' and the channels 24" (see figure 2), the grid 3 is<br>
distanced from the bottom and arches, causing the elastic membrane 6 to<br>
rise too.<br>
The membrane 6 is however gripped to the perimeter strip 22 of the metal<br>
body 2, at the top of the cross zones 25 and at all the other zones on which<br>
the glue has been applied. Therefore it substantially tends to arch only at the<br>
position of the cells 24', assuming a generally lumpy surface appearance.<br>
In this way, the die 1 functions as an isostatic die which enables a uniform<br>
density of the ceramic material of the compacted tile to be achieved.<br>
At the same time, the presence of the grid 3 enables the well-known<br>
phenomenon of "transparency", in which underlying structures of the rest<br>
base of the tile are apparent from the tile in-view surface, to be prevented<br>
from occurring.<br>
During this stage, the operating fluid circulating in the conduit 8 is<br>
discharged, so that the compression spings 74 maintain the valve bodies 7 in<br>
the rest position, with the tops thereof coplanar to the active face 61 of the<br>
elastic membrane 6.<br>
The air imprisoned in the forming cavity 12 can therefore exit freely through<br>
the slim fissures defined between the valve bodies 7 and the breather<br>
mouths 52 of the relative guide bushings 5; then the air flows through the<br>
vertical holes 4, and from there reaches the outside environment, crossing<br>
the horizontal discharge conduits 9 (see figure 8).<br>
In this way, a singly-directed air current from the centre to the periphery of<br>
the forming cavity 12 is not established and an undesirable re-distribution of<br>
the ceramic powders contained in the forming cavity 12 is prevented.<br>
Notwithstanding the small size of the fissures, the air may draw some<br>
particles of ceramic material with it.<br>
This however does not create drawbacks, since the particles are also<br>
expelled towards the outside; further, the abrasive action they tend to<br>
produce is mostly concentrated at the edges of the guide bushings 5, which<br><br>
-14-<br>
are difficult to damage as they are made of materials that are particularly<br>
resistant to abrasion.<br>
When the compacting is finished, as soon as the formed tile is removed and<br>
distanced, pressurised fluid is sent into the conduit 8 so as to make the<br>
plates 71 slide in the direction which causes the relative compression springs<br>
74 to compress in the direction of the dust ring 73.<br>
In this way, the valve bodies 7 are made to exit from the respective guide<br>
bushings 5, increasing the passage hole of the breather mouth 52 in order to<br>
allow removal and distancing of the ceramic material particles which might be<br>
blocked between the valve bodies 7 and the internal wall of the respective<br>
guide bushings 5 (see figure 7).<br>
Then the pressurised operating fluid present in the conduit 8 is immediately<br>
discharged so that the valve bodies 7 can return to the normal position,<br>
pushed by the compression springs 74, for a new compacting cycle.<br>
Note that the above-mentioned compression springs 74 can be replaced by<br>
an auxiliary hydraulic circuit, which supplies a pressurised fluid to the<br>
cylindrical seatings 41, which fluid acts on the plates 71 on the opposite side<br>
with respect to the fluid coming from the conduit 8.<br>
In this case, during the extraction of the valve bodies 7, the auxiliary circuit is<br>
kept charged up, and is activated to return the valve bodies 7 to the initial<br>
position.<br>
Figures 8 and 9 illustrate a variant of the invention, which consists in<br>
improving the removal of the particles of ceramic material trapped between<br>
the valve bodies 7 and the relative guide bushings 5.<br>
In this variant, the internal cavity of each guide bushing 5 exhibits a tract 53<br>
having an increased diameter located behind the mouth defining the breather<br>
mouth 52.<br>
Further, each stem 70 is provided with a scraper body 75 which is<br>
substantially cylindrical and annular and which is positioned coaxially behind<br>
the valve body 7, and is distanced therefrom by a circumferential channel.<br><br>
-15-<br>
The scraper body 75 has a slightly bigger diameter than the valve body 7 but<br>
is in any case destined to pass internally of the breather mouth 52 defined by<br>
the mouth of the guide bushing 5.<br>
For example, the diameter of the scraper body can be about 0.12 mm less<br>
than the diameter of the breather mouth 52.<br>
When the valve body 7 is in the rest position, in which it occupies the<br>
breather mouth 52, the scraper body 75 is contained internally of the<br>
enlarged tract 53 of the guide bushing 5, such as to enable passage of air<br>
coming from the forming cavity.<br>
When the stem 70 slides in the direction to cause the valve body 7 to exit<br>
from the guide bushing 5, the scraper body 75 passes internally of the<br>
breather mouth 52 and, by mechanical action, draws along with it the<br>
particles of ceramic material which might be imprisoned and discharges them<br>
to the outside.<br>
In figures 10 and 11, a first alternative embodiment of the invention is<br>
illustrated, which differes from the previous embodiment due to the fact that<br>
the die 1 does not exhibit the anti-transparency grid 3.<br>
In this case, the first hollow 21 is circumscribed by a channel 27 which runs<br>
along the edges of the metal body 2 and separates it from the perimeter strip<br>
22.<br>
The bottom of the first hollow 21 is grooved by a plurality of shaped cavities<br>
28, which are separate from one another and do not reciprocally<br>
communicate.<br>
The cavities 28 are all of the same depths and are generally rectangular in<br>
plan view with rounded ends.<br>
A respective vertical hole 4 opens on the bottom of each cavity 28, which<br>
vertical hole 4 is generally located in the median point of the cavity 28.<br>
The grooved cavities 28 are, in general but not necessarily, arranged aligned<br>
along rows which are parallel to the lateral edges of the metal body 2, and<br>
along each of the rows they are orientated such as to be alternatively<br>
perpendicular to one another.<br><br>
-16-<br>
The width of each cavity 28 is smaller than the diameter of the projecting<br>
head 50 of the guide bushing 5 housed in the respective vertical hole 4, so<br>
that the projecting head 50 rests directly on the bottom of the first hollow 21.<br>
A layer of mastic or glue is spread on the perimeter strip 22 of the metal body<br>
2, internally of the channel 27, internally of the grooved cavities 28 and on<br>
the projecting head 50 of the guide bushings 5.<br>
Then, internally of the first hollow 21, the fluid resin realising the elastically<br>
deformable membrane 6' is dropped.<br>
In this way, the posterior face of the membrane 6' exhibits a series of<br>
protuberances in relief which are sealedly coupled and solidly gripped each<br>
to the inside of a respective grooved cavity 28.<br>
Further, a through-hole forms at the centre of each protuberance which<br>
houses the projecting head 50 of the guide bushing 5 and which is provided<br>
with a rib 60' for coupling to the undercut channel 51, solidly anchoring the<br>
guide bushing 5 to the elastic membrane 6'.<br>
Apart from the above, the die 1 of the present embodiment is the same as<br>
the die of the previously-described embodiment, and has the same function.<br>
Figures 12 and 13 illustrate a second alternative embodiment of the<br>
invention, in which the die 1 is once more without the anti-transparency grid<br>
3.<br>
In this case too, the first hollow 21 is circumscribed by a channel 27 which<br>
runs along the edges of the metal body 2 and separates it from the perimeter<br>
strip 22.<br>
A series of annular channels 29 are afforded on the bottom of the first hollow<br>
21, each of which circumscribes a circular zone 290 at a centre of which a<br>
respective vertical hole 4 opens out.<br>
A guide bushing 5" is inerted internally of each vertical hole 4, slightly<br>
different from the guide bushings described herein above (see figure 13).<br>
In particular, the guide bushing 5" has a generally constant diameter and is<br>
inserted in an enlarged tract 42 of the vertical hole 4, where the posterior end<br>
thereof rests on an intermediate shoulder.<br><br>
-17-<br>
The shoulder is positioned at a distance from the bottom of the first hollow 21<br>
which is such that the guide bushing 5" projects externally with a projecting<br>
tract 50" exhibiting an undercut circumferential channel 51".<br>
A layer of mastic or glue is spread on the perimeter strip 22 of the metal body<br>
2, internally of he channel 27 and the annular channels 29, on the top of all<br>
the circular zones 290 and on the projecting tract 450" of the guide bushings<br>
5".<br>
A fluid resin is then dropped, so as to realise an elastic membrane 6" the<br>
posterior face of which exhibits a series of annuilar ribs in relief which couple<br>
sealingly and are each tightly gripped internally of a respective annular<br>
channel 29.<br>
Further, the elastic membrane 6" is strongly gripped also by the circular<br>
zones 290, where it forms a through-hole and a rib 60" which couple with the<br>
projecting tract 50" and respectively with the circumferential channel 51" of<br>
the guide bushings 5".<br>
Apart from these particulars, the die 1 of the second alternative embodiment<br>
is the same as the previous die 1 and has the same type of functioning.<br>
In figures from 14 to 18, a third alternative embodiment of the invention is<br>
illustrated, in which the isostatic die 1 is associated to an aspirating device<br>
(not shown) by means of as aspirating conduit 14.<br>
The aspirating conduit 14 is in communication with the series of discharge<br>
conduits 9 afforded in the front plate 200 of the metal body 2, and which<br>
communicate with the breather mouths 52.<br>
In particular, as illustrated in figure 17, the discharge conduits 9 are parallel<br>
to one another, and each of them is in communication with a whole row of<br>
vertical holes 4.<br>
A first end of each discharge conduit 9 opens internally of a transversal<br>
channel 90, also afforded in the front plate 200 of the metal body 2, which<br>
makes the discharge conduits 9 reciprocally communicating.<br>
The second ends of the discharge conduits 9 are all in communication with a<br>
respective underlying opening 91, which is afforded in the intermediate plate<br><br>
-18-<br>
201 of the metal body 2, and opens onto an external flank thereof (see<br>
figures 16 and 18).<br>
A casing 92 is fixed to the external flank, which casing 92 defines a single<br>
aspirating manifold 93, which is hermetically closed and internally of which all<br>
the openings 91 terminate.<br>
The aspirating manifold 93 communicates directly with the aspirating conduit<br>
14.<br>
As illustrated in figure 18, an auxiliary channel 94 is afforded in the<br>
intermediate plate 201 of the metal body 2.<br>
The auxiliary channel 94 is parallel to the discharge conduits 9 and is located<br>
in an intermediate position between two thereof, in order to be closed by the<br>
front plate 200.<br>
The end of the auxiliary channel 14 located on the side of the opening 91<br>
communicates with a vertical hole 95 opening into an elbow conduit 96<br>
afforded in the posterior plate 202 of the metal body 2 (see also figure 19).<br>
The elbow conduit 96 terminates externally of the metal body 2, where it is<br>
connected to an entry conduit 97, which is connected to a usual compressed-<br>
air blower device (not illustrated).<br>
The end of the auxiliary channel 14 which is opposite the vertical hole 95 is in<br>
communication with the connection channel 90 of the discharge conduits 90<br>
such that the discharge conduits 90 are reached by the compressed air<br>
injected by the blower device.<br>
The blower device is usually inactive during the pressing stage, and the air<br>
contained in the forming cavity can freely flow into the discharge conduits 9<br>
and exit to the outside through the manifold 93 and the aspiration conduit 14.<br>
During these stages, the aspirating device might be kept on, so as to<br>
facilitate the degassing of the forming cavity; however this must be when the<br>
aspirating action does not cause an excessive entraining of ceramic particles,<br>
which can be the situation when the degassing causes clogging problems in<br>
the fissures between the breather mouth 52 and the valve body 7.<br><br>
-19-<br>
It can occur that after a high number of pressing cycles, large quantities of<br>
ceramic powder material leaked from the breather mouths 52 accumulate in<br>
the discharge conduits 9.<br>
To clean the discharge conduits 9, each time the die 1 completes a<br>
predetermined number of pressing cycles, the aspirating device and the<br>
blower device are contemporaneously activated.<br>
In this way, the compressed air passes into the auxialiry channel 94 and,<br>
through the transversal channel 90, runs along the discharge conduits 9,<br>
pushing the ceramic powder towards the opening 91, where it is sucked into<br>
the aspirating manifold 93 by the aspirating device.<br>
Note that figure 14 illustrates a conduit 15 for injecting the oil required for the<br>
isostatic pressing operation, and a conduit 16 for compressed air injection for<br>
activating the valve stems 70.<br>
Figures 20 and 21 illustrate a fourth alternative embodiment of the invention.<br>
In this embodiment, the stems 70 are solidly fixed to the metal body 2 by<br>
means of a threaded sleeve 76, so that the valve bodies 7 are always still<br>
internally of the relative bushings 5, in the rest position.<br>
The functioning of the isostatic die 1 is the same as the functioning of the die<br>
1 described herein above.<br>
However, in order to discharge the ceramic powder which might be trapped<br>
internally of the fissures between the valve bodies 7 and the mouths 5, the<br>
discharge conduits 9 are connected to a compressed-air blower device, in<br>
the same way as described for the previous embodiment.<br>
The blower device enters into operation after each pressing cycle, so that the<br>
compressed air injected into the discharge conduits 9 tends to exit from<br>
breather mouths 52 and projects the trapped ceramic powder towards the<br>
forming cavity.<br>
In order to perform this fuinction, the blower device must however inject air<br>
into the discharge conduit 9 at a greater pressure than what is required in the<br>
third alternative embodiment of the invention.<br><br>
-20-<br>
Obviously an expert in the sector might bring numerous modifications or a<br>
techncal-applicational nature to the isostatic dies described herein, without<br>
forsaking the ambit of the inventive idea as claimed herein below.<br><br>
