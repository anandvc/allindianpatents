according to the present invention;<br>

transmission according to the present invention;<br>
 FIG. 3 is a truth table presenting the state of engagement of the various torque<br>

 DESCRIPTION<br><br>
 At the outset, it should be appreciated that the automatic transmission of the<br>
present invention has an arrangement of permanent mechanical connections between the<br>
elements of the four planetary gear sets in common. These mechanical connections<br><br>
generically link or relate transmission embodiments. A first component or element of a<br><br>
first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a first component or element of a<br><br><br>
second planetary gear set. A third component or element of the second planetary gear set<br>
is permanently coupled to a second component or element of a third planetary gear set. A<br>
first component or element of the third planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a first<br>
component or element of a fourth planetary gear set. Finally, a third component or<br>
element of the third planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a second component or<br>
element of the fourth planetary gear set.<br>
 Referring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment of a multiple speed transmission 10<br>
is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a schematic representation of<br>
the components of a mechanical device such as an automatic transmission. Each<br>
individual lever represents a planetary gear set wherein the three basic mechanical<br>
components-of the planetary gear arc each represented by a node. Therefore, a single<br>
lever contains three nodes: one for the sun gear, one for the planet gear carrier, and one<br>
for the ring gear. The relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to<br>
represent the ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gear set. These lever ratios, in turn, arc<br>
used to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to achieve an appropriate ratios<br>
and ratio progression. Mechanical couplings or interconnections between the nodes of<br>
the various planetary gear sets arc illustrated by thin, horizontal lines and torque<br>
transmitting devices such as clutches and brakes are presented as interleaved fingers. If<br>
the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is grounded. Further explanation of the<br>
format, purpose and use of lever diagrams can be found in SAE Paper 810102. "The<br>
Lever Analogy: A New Tool in Transmission Analysis" by Ben ford and Leising which is<br>
hereby fully incorporated by reference.<br><br>

52 of the third planetary gear set 20. A first brake 90 selectively connects the first node<br>
24 of the first planetary gear set 16 to a ground, stationary element or a transmission<br><br>
housing 100. A second brake 92 selectively connects the second node 74 of the fourth<br>

 The transmission 10 includes a variety of torque-transmitting mechanisms or<br>
devices including a first clutch 80, a second clutch 82, a third clutch 84, a fourth clutch<br>
86, a first brake 90 and a second brake 92. Firsi clutch 80 is selectively engagablc to<br>

cngagablc to connect ninth interconnecting member 66 to housing 100 to restrict rotation<br>
of ninth interconnecting member 66 and ring gear 74 relative to housing 100. Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, the operation of the embodiment of the<br>
multiple speed transmission 10 will be described. It will be appreciated that the<br>
transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the input shaft or member 12 to<br>
the output shaft or member 14 in at least nine forward speed or torque ratios and at least<br>
one reverse speed or torque ratio. Each forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is<br>
attained by engagement of one or more of the torque-transmitting mechanisms (i.e. first<br>
clutch 80. second clutch 82. third clutch 84. fourth clutch 86. first brake 32. and second<br>
brake 34). as will be explained below. FIG. 3 is a truth table presenting the various<br>
combinations of torque-transmitting mechanisms or elements that arc activated or engaged to achieve the various gear states. Actual numerical gear ratios and gear steps of<br>
the various gear slates are also presented although it should be appreciated that these<br>
numerical values arc exemplary only and that they may be adjusted over significant<br>
ranges to accommodate various applications and operational criteria of the transmission<br>
10. An example of the gear ratios that may be obtained using the embodiments of the<br><br>
present invention arc also shown in FIG. 3. Of course, other gear ratios are achievable<br>
depending on the gear diameter, gear teeth count and gear configuration selected. To establish reverse gear, the first brake 90, the second brake 92. and the<br>
second clutch 82 are engaged or activated. First brake 90 connects first interconnecting<br>
member 32. to transmission housing 00 to restrict rotation of first interconnecting<br>
member 32 and sun gear 24 relative to housing 100. Second brake 92 connects ninth<br>
interconnecting member 66 to housing 100. to restrict rotation of ninth interconnecting<br>
member 66 and ring gear 74 relative to housing 100. Second clutch 82 connects sixth<br>
interconnecting member 60 to ninth interconnecting member 66. Likewise, the nine<br>
forward ratios arc achieved through different combinations of clutch and brake<br>
engagement, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
 Referring now to FIG. 4, an alternate truth table is presented for the operation<br>
of the embodiment of the multiple speed transmission 10. It will be appreciated that the<br>
transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the input shaft or member 12 to<br>
the output shaft or member 14 in at least ten forward speed or torque ratios and at least"<br>
one reverse speed or torque ratio. Each forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is<br>
attained by engagement of one or more of the torque-transmitting mechanisms (i.e. first<br>
clutch 80. second clutch 82. third clutch 84, fourth clutch 86, first brake 32, and second<br>
brake 34). as was described above. Actual numerical gear ratios and gear steps of the<br>
various gear slates arc also presented although it should be appreciated that these<br>
numerical values are exemplary only and that they may be adjusted over significant<br>
ranges to accommodate various applications and operational criteria of the transmission<br>
10. An example of the gear ratios that may be obtained using the embodiments of the<br><br>
present invention are also shown in FIG. 3. Of course, other gear ratios are achievable<br>
depending on the gear diameter, gear teeth count and gear configuration selected. It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation and gear<br>
slates of the multiple speed transmission 10 assumes, first of all. that all the clutches and<br>
the brakes not specifically referenced in a given gear state are inactive or disengaged and.<br>
second of all, that during gear shifts, i.e.. changes of gear stale, between at least adjacent<br>
gear states, a clutch or brake engaged or activated in both gear states will remain engaged<br>
or activated. Additionally, the present invention contemplates that downshifts follow<br>
essentially the reverse sequence of the corresponding upshift (as described above), and<br>
several power-on skip-shifts arc possible (e.g. from 1st to 3rd).<br>
 While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described in<br>
detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope.of the<br>
appended claims.<br><br>
