				<td>METHOD AND DEVICE FOR PRODUCING AND RECYCLING NANOEMULSIONS AND FOR<br>
PROCESSING PART SURFACES BY MEANS THEREOF<br>
[0001] The invention relates to the process and a device in the form of an electromechanical<br>
device with which microemulsions can be converted into nanoemuisions and process-controlled<br>
into various phases so that a surface treatment of materials is possible in a vacuum chamber<br>
through the multiphase process, especially an optimal coating and coating removal of organic as<br>
well as inorganic solids. The emulsions are again recycled afterwards.<br>
[0002] A microemulsion is a thermodynamically stable, isotropic, low viscosity mixture, which<br>
consists of a hydrophilic component and a lipophilic component. The hydrophilic character of a<br>
substance is determined by its property to dissolve in water. (Conversing: hydrophobic = water<br>
repelling). Lipophilic characterises the property of compounds or molecular groups to dissolve<br>
slightly in fats, fatty substances and oils or to serve as, solvent themselves for such substances,<br>
while on the contrary lipophobic (fat repellent) materials, act in the opposite way. The electrical<br>
and electromagnetic system of the device proposed here effect modifications to the diffuse<br>
interphase of a so-called Stern double layer of the particles within the emulsions. This Stem<br>
double layer is made up of a fixed and a diffuse layer. According to the theory of Otto Stem<br>
(1888-1969), Nobel price winner Physics, a potential builds up due to the charge distribution,<br>
which decreases linearly in the fixed and exponentially in the diffuse layer. The respective Zeta<br>
potential of an emulsion is important for the functional effect at the diffuse interphase, which<br>
describes the stability of a microemulsion or an individual micelle. The Zeta potential is therefore<br>
a measure for the repulsion or attraction between particles and a micelle is a colloidal particle,<br>
which is made-up-of-a number of small individual molecules.<br>
[0003] One would want to keep the loss as small as possible in electrical insulations of high<br>
frequency carrying conductors or in insulations in high frequency fields. For that, one uses<br>
materials, which produce in such fields as small an effective power as possible and thus lead to<br>
low losses. Conversely, one selects microemulsions in such a way that as high losses as possible<br>
and consequently desired modifications arise within, i.e. at the micelle surfaces. Hence an option<br>
is available to be able to influence the structure of micelles in a controlled and regulated way so<br>
that they have acceptable kinetic conditions, which enable an coating removal as well as a<br>
coating of materials in the molecular range. A system for such purposes works with a continuous-<br>
flow process, which permits an activation using as less energy as possible. There is additionally<br>
the option to merge the medium to be treated with the different charges in a vacuum chamber<br><br>
such that a charge equalisation, i.e. a conversion of the microemulsion to a nanoemulsion, takes<br>
place adjacent to the surface of the material to be treated.<br>
[0004] The task of the present invention is to produce a device for the surface treatment of parts<br>
by means of recyclable nanoemulsions as well as to indicate a process for the creation and<br>
application of the nanoemulsions in a multiphase interface treatment as well as for the recycling<br>
of the nanoemulsions.<br>
[0005] This problem is solved by a process for the production, application and recycling of<br>
nanoemulsions as well as for the surface treatment of parts by means of the same, for which a<br>
nanoemulsion is produced, in which an emulsion flows through an actuation device, in which<br>
electrical and electromagnetic fields produced by a high frequency electrode and electromagnetic<br>
high frequency coil by means of generators are superimposed on each other and resonances are<br>
produced by means of selectable voltages, frequencies and phase shifts so that, as a result of<br>
the modification of the particle double layers, which causes a variation of the Zeta potential, a<br>
microemulsion transforms to a nanoemulsion, with which the surfaces of parts are treated<br>
afterwards in a vacuum chamber and is recycled afterwards in the recycling system and then<br>
reused.<br>
[0006] The problem is further solved by a device for the production, application and recycling of<br>
nanoemulsions as well as for the surface treatment of parts by means of the same, consisting of<br>
a closed loop with minimum one pump for the supply of an emulsion to a circuit, this closed loop<br>
containing a vacuum chamber for the surface treatment of parts therein, in which the closed loop<br>
runs through an actuation device, as well as a high voltage and a high frequency coil with<br>
separate generator each with frequency converter for the production of an electrical field, in<br>
which separate fields can be produced from it for the conversion of a microemulsion to a<br>
nanoemulsion, and the device further includes a transversal resonator for the production of an<br>
aerosol as well as injection nozzles for the spraying of the aerosol-/nanoemulsion mixture into<br>
the vacuum chamber.<br>
[0007] A device is represented in the drawings as example with its essential elements in different<br>
views and is described below on the basis of these drawings and the process operated with that<br>
is explained. The physical process sequences in the course of the coating removal process are<br>
explained on the basis of schematically, greatly enlarged representations.<br>
Brief Description of Accompanying Drawings :<br>
The following are shown:<br>
Figure 1: The device in a view seen from behind;<br><br><br>
Figure 2:	The device in a view seen from the front, with front-side cover removed;<br>
Figure 3:	Activation device with a pump outlet and a transversal resonator<br>
Figure 4:	A cross-section through the recycling system;<br>
Figure 5-10: The different phases of an coating removal by means of nanoemulsion<br>
represented schematically and greatly enlarged.<br>
[0008] In order to be able to describe and understand the device and the process operated with it<br>
better, at first a small digression about microemulsions is given here: These microemulsions can<br>
be formed as purely organic or aqueous organic. For the purely organic microemulsion, a carrier<br>
liquid is used, which consists of one or more types of molecules.<br>
On the other hand, for the aqueous microemulsions, the carrier liquid consists of water.<br>
[0009] The carrier liquids are now added with several surface-active materials, that is materials,<br>
which go into physically-based bond with their surfaces in binding with another material. These<br>
materials form so-called micelles in the carrier liquid by self-organisation. According to the task,<br>
surface-active materials are used in addition, which form monomolecular or bimolecular micelles.<br>
Such tensides are soluble organic compounds, which lower surface tension. They have minimum<br>
one hydrophobic molecular part and one hydrophilic group.<br>
Basic assumption for the stability and the molecular self-organisation of the treatment liquid is<br>
that molecular, surface-active materials in the carrier liquid are not soluble. Enzymes are used for<br>
the setting and changing of the interfacial kinetics of the double layer of the nanoparticles.<br>
[0010] There are various surface-active and non-ionic agents available for the formation of the<br>
organic and the aqueous microemulsions. These can be roughly classified into:<br>
•	Anionic materials<br>
•	Cationic materials<br>
•	Nonionic materials<br>
•	Amphoteric materials.<br>
Anionic surface-active materials can form micelles with a positive charge. Cationic surface-active<br>
materials can form micelles with a positive charge. Nonionic surface-active materials can form<br>
micelles with a zero charge. Amphoteric surface-active materials can form micelles with a<br>
negative or positive charge. For all these materials, the charge strength depends on the Zeta<br><br><br>
potential. The type of charge is determined by electrical and magnetic forces, which are effective<br>
at the system surface.<br>
[0011] The amphoteric active materials are used in coating removal and coating systems, for<br>
which very short conversion times are required. Due to this reason, these materials are especially<br>
well suited for the present process. They can be recharged in fractions of seconds using<br>
magnetic and electric phase control with the proposed device. The charging possibilities move<br>
between negative (anionic), zero potential (neutral) and positive (cationic). The Zeta potential can<br>
be controlled and regulated at a Stern double layer independent of the chemical potential through<br>
suitable resonances with this device and the process operated with that. Thereby, Zeta potential<br>
can be set from -15 to +15.<br>
[0012] Further materials, which are used in microemulsions, are:<br>
•	Enzyme<br>
•	Organic and inorganic nanoparticles<br>
•	Left and right rotating terpenes<br>
The enzymes can control the energy behaviour of micelles, nanoparticles and left and right<br>
rotating molecules. Normally, they work as catalysts, which reduce the reaction energy between<br>
two systems. The enzymes are not used in the microemulsion. Nanoparticles, which are smaller<br>
than 20 nm in size, are highly reactive and can break through high energy barriers. In the<br>
microemulsion, they are important for the self-organised reaction in the individual phases of the<br>
coating and/or coating removal process. The left and right rotating molecules (mainly terpenes)<br>
are responsible for the formation, enlargement and stabilising of the micro-capillaries, which will<br>
be gone into in more detail later.<br>
[0013] The electrical properties of micelles are analogous to the kinetic properties to a certain<br>
extent. Since almost no electron conductivity is present in the micelles in comparison to the<br>
metals, the electrical properties to a certain extent, as also the mechanical properties, depend on<br>
the mobility of the molecular components of the micelles. Characteristic for these properties is the<br>
relative permittivity εr. One calls εr the relative permittivity". The value of the relative permittivity of<br>
an insulating material is determined by the strength of the polarisation. It is dimensionless, but<br>
depends both on the material as well as on the temperature and the frequency. So-called<br>
polarisation charges arise at the surface of the micelles under the influence of an electric field,<br>
which cause induction. Here, by induction, one means the separation of charges of a conducting<br>
body under the influence of the electrical forces exerted by external charges. The dielectric<br>
polarisation is the proportion of the dielectric flux density, which falls on the dielectric. The value<br>
of the dielectric polarisation P arises as per the relationship:<br><br><br><br>
[0014] It can be derived from the equation (1) that the polar behaviour and consequently P of a<br>
material depends on how large the relative permittivity is, for each salient one. If only a<br>
displacement polarisation is present, the relative permittivity is small. If, besides the displacement<br>
polarisation, an orientation polarisation also occurs additionally, the relative permittivity is larger. It<br>
can then reach values of 4 to 100. If there is a spontaneous polarisation, the peak values of even<br>
up to 100,000 can be reached as relative permittivity. But what exactly is polarisation? Real<br>
bodies consist of equal number of positive and negative electrical charges, on which an<br>
influencing electrical field exerts kinetic forces. Positive charges are accelerated in the field<br>
direction, negative against the field direction. Micelles have practically no freely movable charge<br>
carriers. The charges are bonded to carriers (Atoms, Molecular segments). They can be<br>
consequently displaced only elastically by an amount proportional to the field strength. The<br>
centres of gravity of the positive and negative charges therefore do not coincide any more;<br>
electrical dipoles are formed. For the electron polarisation, the external field causes a deformation<br>
of the electron shell of the atoms. It occurs for nonpolar materials. For the pure electron<br>
polarisation, εr = n2 (n = optical refractive index). Also, it practically does not change with the<br>
frequency, reduces with the temperature, since as a result of the thermal expansion, the number<br>
of polarisable particles becomes less. Since only the molecules used for the formation of micelles<br>
themselves or parts of them represent, permanent dipoles", they align themselves in electrical<br>
fields, so that macroscopic polarisation arises, which is higher for polar, surface-active materials<br>
than for nonpolar. The polarisation parts are also movable differently corresponding to the<br>
different mechanisms. Since the permanent dipoles are relatively large groups in micelles, they<br>
can follow only comparatively low frequencies. Of considerable practical interest is the question of<br>
the influence of colour pigments on the relative dielectric constant. The most important mixing<br>
rule is calculated approximately from the sum of the dipole moments of the colour pigments and<br>
those of the carrier matrix on the total charge density:<br><br><br>
in which p = Volume content<br>
Thus, for example, the following arises for air inclusions (foam, flow zones, etc.) with<br><br>
[0015] The proposed process can be used in various applications in connection with a<br>
microemulsion. It functions for coating and coating removal in the nano range. The coating<br>
removals serve for example for the<br>
•	removal of wet and dried printing inks<br>
•	removal of single or double component colours<br>
•	removal of plastic coatings<br>
•	removal of industrial dirt layers<br>
•	etc.<br>
The coatings serve for the<br>
•	modification of the conductivity of plastic surfaces<br><br>
•	modification of surface energy of plastic surfaces, e.g. epilaminating, improvement of the<br>
sliding property, etc.<br>
•	application of functional nanolayers on solids<br>
•	etc.<br>
[0016] The objective of the process is to convert a microemulsion into a nanoemulsion in the<br>
actuation device and create active electrical surface-double layers in the molecular or atomic area<br>
on the solid particles of the nanoemulsion with the help of the phase resonator through<br>
electromagnetic fields. Electrical double layers are responsible as is generally known for many<br>
physical kinetic phenomena like electro-osmosis, electrophoresis, streaming potentials and<br>
sedimentation potentials. The electrical kinetic forces, which act on electrically charged particles<br>
in a liquid, are designated as Coulomb forces. For the function of the process mentioned, which<br>
can be used for the layer formation and layer removal on solids, electrokinetic modifications are<br>
produced at the double layers of different systems through electrical and high frequency high<br>
voltage fields. Besides, a gas mixture is let into the actuation device. Thereby, an aerosol is<br>
produced from a portion of the nanoemulsion, which is sprayed into the vacuum chamber<br>
together with the remaining nanoemulsion with the rotating injection nozzles of the transversal<br>
resonator. A parabolic, asymmetric, transversal superimposed rotation field is produced in the<br>
vacuum chamber through the rotating transversal resonator. The double layers of the sprayed<br>
particles react in this field and form functional resonances in the individual process phases.<br>
Various functional single- or multiphase processes are used for the coating and coating removal<br>
process.<br>
[0017] A decisive role for the multiphase process is, among others, the influence of the<br>
composition of the used microemulsion as well as the program-controlled reaction technique in<br>
the actuation device or in the phase resonator. Isolated active and energy-rich centres with<br>
electrokinetic charges are formed in the individual phases with the phase resonator, with which<br>
the structure of the organic layer to be removed is modified. The molecules, enzymes and<br>
nanoparticle surface atoms are dissolved in these active centres and effective, intermolecular<br>
forces are produced in the organic layer. Different interactions arise between the layer molecules,<br>
which are described in more detail in the four phases of the multiphase coating removal system.<br>
A special feature of this process is the self-organisation of nanoparticles, which is formed through<br>
the adsorption of ions and through self-dissociation. Nanoparticles, which are in this condition,<br>
can lead to system instabilities in contact with ionic surface. This effect is operative in phase 4<br>
described below for the removal of large layer agglomerations. A further effect, which is used in<br>
the process of the phase 1 described below, is the arising of matter waves, which form a network<br>
of split-capillaries in the organic layer. One knows from the formation appearance of the electrons<br><br><br>
and neutrons that material particle properties come from matter waves, if the molecular force<br>
constants are very large (Extension of the Maxwell relation for the translational energy). In<br>
contrast to the electromagnetic waves or protons, the velocity of propagation is different from the<br>
particle speed for matter waves. For the creation of a particle beam through an infinitely long<br>
wave train, the impulse of the particle is uniquely determined by the wavelength. The spot, which<br>
captures or runs through a particle at a particular point of time, is however fully uncertain. In order<br>
to be able to mark the local place of a particle, which penetrates into the organic layer, at least<br>
approximately, one must consider a wave packet. Such a wave packet arises through<br>
superimposition of many wave trains, in which the wavelength and the amplitude are so selected<br>
that interferences are caused. The uncertainty of the local position of the particle is narrowed<br>
down with the help of a wave packet, which is used in the phase 3 described below. However,<br>
this is possible only at the cost of the certainty in the indication of the impulse. The wave<br>
character of material particles brings therefore a basic lack of certainty for the simultaneous<br>
indication of location impulse of a particle (Uncertainty relation, Physicist Werner Heisenberg,<br>
1927).<br>
[0018] A specific embodiment for the use of such nanoemulsions is the cleaning of tampon<br>
printing press implements. For this, a device is used, which is represented in Figure I from<br>
behind. It is produced from chrome steel and has a vacuum chamber 1 accessible from above, in<br>
which a treatment basket 2 with two handles 3 can be introduced. Implements to be cleaned, that<br>
is, in the proposed example tampon printing plates, are placed in this basket 2 and thereafter<br>
placed in the vacuum chamber 1. Many times, only a grid is used instead of the treatment basket<br>
2 for the taking up of the cleaning material. The vacuum chamber can be closed with a cover 4,<br>
which is fixed to this with the help of hinges on the upper side of the device. The operator stands<br>
on the front side of the device, that is, on the side turned away from here in this diagram. The<br>
cover is thus, starting from the closed condition, swung towards the front and forms after that a<br>
placement area for the treatment basket 2 or the cleaning material lifted out of the vacuum<br>
chamber.<br>
Besides the vacuum chamber I, one can recognise a recycling system 5, in which the<br>
microemulsion is freed of the colour, as is described in detail later. On the backside of the device,<br>
there is an opening 6 for the exhaust air, which arises during the creation of the vacuum in the<br>
vacuum chamber I. An internal exhaust air system or an active carbon filter can be connected to<br>
the opening 6. On the small side of the device, there is in addition a compressed air connection 7<br>
and an electrical connection 8.<br>
[0019] In Figure 2, one sees the device in a view from the front, with the front-side cover<br>
removed. Two circulation pumps 9 can be recognised under the vacuum chamber I. An actuation<br>
-8-<br><br>
device 10, which cannot be seen fully here, is connected to each pump outlet. This actuation<br>
device 10 is connected respectively to the corresponding transversal resonator (not visible here)<br>
in the vacuum chamber 1 with the help of a threaded connection. In the floor of the vacuum<br>
chamber I is the drain outlet, which is connected to the pump inlets via a T-joint 11 and a<br>
threaded connection each. The circulation pumps 9 supply the microemulsion then via the<br>
activation units 10 to the transversal resonators, where it is sprayed as aerosol/nanoemulsion<br>
mixture into the vacuum chamber on the cleaning material. The microemulsion leaves the<br>
vacuum chamber 1 via a drain outlet, which is connected to the circulation pumps 9 via the T-joint<br>
11 and the connection pipes. This cleaning circuit described can thus also be operated<br>
alternatively with one or more than two pumps according to the cleaning requirement. Besides the<br>
cleaning circuit, the device contains in addition one circuit for the recycling. The two actuation<br>
devices 10 are connected with each other for that via a connecting pipe 12. In its middle there is a<br>
valve 13, which after switching on feeds a part of the emulsion to the recycling system 5 for the<br>
recycling via the tube 14. After the recycling process, the now clean microemulsion is again<br>
supplied to the vacuum chamber 1 via the pipe 15 and the valve 16. Air is blown in from below to<br>
the recycling system 5 for a back flushing with valve 16 closed. The back flushing is gone into in<br>
detail in Figure 4. Above the actuation devices 10, one can recognise the electric network 17<br>
belonging to the device, which is provided on the outside of the vacuum chamber 1. The<br>
generators for the operation of the electrodes and the coils as well as the phase discriminators<br>
also belong to this electric network 17. High voltage fields of 1 to 10,000 Volt can be produced<br>
with these generators with superimposed frequencies from 10 Hz to 1 GHz. A vacuum valve 18<br>
can be recognised to the right of the vacuum chamber. The vacuum valve 18 has the task to set<br>
the vacuum chamber 1 under vacuum and to conduct the exhaust air via the opening 6 (Figure<br>
1). The 3/2 directional control valve 19 serves for the aeration and de-aeration of the recycling<br>
system 5 as well as the aeration of the vacuum chamber 1.<br>
[0020] The Figure 3 shows in an enlarged view the outlet of a circulation pump 9, an actuation<br>
device 10 and a transversal resonator 20. The microemulsion is converted to a nanoemulsion<br>
with the help of the actuation device 10. The individual process steps for the 4-phase process is<br>
produced with the rotating transversal resonator 20. The actuation device 10 is at the pump outlet<br>
9, fixed with a 1"- threading. The actuation device 10 consists of a shielding housing 21,<br>
consisting of a pipe, which is welded on to the floor outlet of the vacuum chamber I. An insulator<br>
22 is assembled in the shielding housing 21. In the middle of the insulator 22, i.e., in the liquid<br>
inlet, there is one or two high voltage electrodes 23 and two sliding contacts 24. The high voltage<br>
electrode 23 is connected to the wave guides and the permanent magnets 26 via a sliding contact<br>
24 each. An electromagnetic high frequency coil 27 is fitted outside the shielding housing 21. In<br>
the upper part of the insulator 22, which projects into the vacuum chamber I, there is a ball<br><br><br>
bearing 28 and a fastening thread for the transversal resonator 20. At the lower end, below the<br>
high frequency coil 27, is the connection 29 for the high voltage electrode 23. On the opposite<br>
side is the inlet 30, via which gaseous, vaporous or liquid active agents can be lead into the<br>
system. The transversal resonator 20 consists of a cylindrical rotating part 31 of plastic or ceramic<br>
with internal thread for the fixing to the activation unit 10 and two threads provided sideways for<br>
the hollow nozzle bars 32 of plastic. One or more ring permanent magnets 33 are assembled in<br>
the upper part. One or more injection nozzles 34 each are screwed into the nozzle bars 32 while<br>
there is one hole 35 below which is slightly displaced sideways. The transversal resonator 20<br>
rotates around its axis through the outflow of the nanoemulsion from the two holes 35. One wave<br>
guide 25 each of tungsten or stainless steel is fixed in the hollow nozzle bars 32 in the middle,<br>
which is closed on outer side with a permanent magnet 26. The wave guides 25 are connected<br>
on the inner side with a sliding contact 24 each to the actuation device 10. In the lower part of the<br>
activation unit 10, there is a membrane as phase resonator 36, which is provided with a high<br>
voltage/high frequency generator via the connection 37 for the production of nanoparticles with<br>
definite sizes.<br>
[0021] The microemulsion is freed from the colour absorbed continuously in the recycling system<br>
5. The recycling system 5, which can be seen in Figure 2, is represented in Figure 4 in a cross-<br>
section. It is a pot of chrome steel. In principle, a usual chrome steel digester can be used as<br>
recycling system 5. There is an outlet opening 38 in the pot floor. A distributor 39 with an<br>
electromagnetic discharge coil 40 is fixed at this outlet opening 38. The task of the discharge coil<br>
40 is to reset the microemulsion again to a defined condition. An air inlet valve 41 is assembled to<br>
the distributor 39 below the coil 40 with non-return valve 42 interposed for the back flushing. The<br>
clean microemulsion leaves the recycling system 5 via the pipe 15, which is provided likewise at<br>
the distributor 39. Four inlets 43, 44 and 47, 48 are pressed in with threads sideways to the pot.<br>
The inlets 43 and 44 are connected with a tube 45. There is an adjustable capacitive level sensor<br>
46 for the level control. The upper inlet 47 is connected with a 3/2 directional control valve to the<br>
compressed air inlet via a nylon tube. The lower inlet 48 is connected with the tube 14 to valve<br>
13. A part of the microemulsion is fed to the recycling system 5 for the recycling via this tube 14.<br>
A separating plate 49 is put inside in the recycling system 5. This separating plate 49 is fixed with<br>
a T-shaped fixing unit 54 on a sealing ring 55 on the pot floor. It consists of a metal tray 50 with<br>
twelve discharge holes. A stainless steel nose plate 51 is welded to the metal tray 50 as spacer.<br>
A Piezo foil 52 of coated stainless steel wire gauze or plastic cloth lies on that. Alternatively, an<br>
electrode consisting of a wire gauze, which is supplied with high voltage from an external<br>
generator, can also be put in. A fine-mesh stainless steel grid 53 lies over the Piezo foil 52 or the<br>
high-voltage electrode. The parts put in are fixed at the rim insulated against the metal tray 50<br>
with a high-ohmic sealing compound 56. In the middle of the separating plate 49, there is a<br><br><br>
stainless steel lug with hole 57 for the fixing and removing. The separating plate 49 has, besides<br>
the assembly of a liquid/liquid double layer for the colour separation, the task to prevent the<br>
outflow of the fine-grained adsorber.<br>
[0022] For the first commissioning or after a colour removal, at first a measuring beaker adsorber<br>
or a unit of vacuum-packed adsorber paste is added to the recycling system 5. The adsorber<br>
consists of various organic and inorganic substances, which are so selected that they can release<br>
the costly active agents of the microemulsion again through exchange during the recycling. After<br>
the addition of the adsorber, the recycling system 5 is closed tightly, for which the relevant cover<br>
can be used in the case of a digester. After the starting of the cleaning process, the recycling of<br>
the emulsion is active in parallel to that. At first the back flushing is started in the recycling system<br>
5 for that. It mixes the adsorber with the dirty emulsion. During the cleaning process, the recycling<br>
system 5 is filled cyclically with dirty emulsion via the valve 13. The filling volume is determined<br>
by the capacitive level sensor 46. During the mixing with the adsorber, the molecular active<br>
agents bonded to the colour agglomerations are again released and replaced by adsorber<br>
molecules. The released active agents again form micelles partially and receive a negative<br>
charge. A liquid/liquid separating layer is formed between the adsorber and the separating plate<br>
with a negative field voltage through the pressure and/or vacuum acting on the Piezo membrane.<br>
The field voltage (high voltage) forms an electrostatic filter and separates the positively charged<br>
colour agglomerations from the negatively charged microemulsion. The microemulsion freed from<br>
the colour leaves the recycling system 5 via the discharge opening 38 present on the floor. The<br>
colour residues bonded to the adsorber however remain until the colour removal in the pot. For<br>
the passage of the microemulsion through the electromagnetic discharge coil 40, the micelles are<br>
again transferred back to the original state according to their charge. Afterwards, the regenerated<br>
microemulsion is again fed to the vacuum chamber 1 via the pipe 15 and through the valve 16.<br>
The separated colour quantity is monitored periodically and/or through a sensor with regard to the<br>
quantity. If the maximum permitted colour quantity is reached, a colour removal process is carried<br>
out automatically. For that, the recycling system 5 is emptied and the residual substance dried<br>
with air from the inlet 47. After the end of this process, the cover is opened by hand and the<br>
separating plate 49 removed manually with the powdered and dried colour residues bonded to<br>
the used adsorber. After the removal of the residues, the separating plate 49 is again used in the<br>
recycling system 5 and screwed firmly with the T-shaped fixing unit 54. A new cleaning process<br>
can be started only if the recycling system 5 is filled again with adsorber afresh and the cover has<br>
been closed. The recycling system permits a time-wise practically unlimited use of the<br>
microemulsion. Only the carry-over losses have to be replaced from time to time.<br><br><br>
[0023] Now the individual phases of the multiphase process are described and explained below<br>
individually: Figure 5 shows the phase 1 of that: In the multiphase process, organic layers are<br>
removed from the backside and built up from the front side for the layer formation. Therefore, for<br>
layer removal in the phase 1, the organic layer is provided with a hollow space structure, i.e. it is<br>
made porous. For that purpose, gas-loaded nanoparticles are accelerated in the direction of the<br>
substratum surface with accumulated left and right rotating molecules from the aerosol mixture<br>
produced in the transversal resonator in a polar, transversal alternating field. For this, a potential<br>
difference of ∆φ0 = 3000 V and a superimposed alternating voltage of 4000V are applied between<br>
the two electrodes (Wave guide) of the transversal resonator. In the alternating field, the energy<br>
levels of the nanoparticle phase boundary layers are periodically raised and lowered. The<br>
injection process is accelerated by that. The channel walls of the microchannels produced by the<br>
penetration of the gas-loaded nanoparticles are occupied by left and right rotating molecules. This<br>
process is performed by a tandem reaction. This is a reaction sequence in which two different<br>
reactions follow each other directly, in which the first reaction practically forces the injection, the<br>
second, the occupation of the channel walls. The capillaries produced thus remain stable for<br>
about 30 to 60 seconds.<br>
[0024] Phase 2: (Figure 6) An injection process occurs in the direction of the substrate or the<br>
organic layer adhering to the substrate through the modification of the electrical double layer on<br>
the nanoparticles M2. A potential drop arises at the phase transition (Aerosol/Liquid) ↔ (Layer)<br>
and with that a modification of the resonance frequency at the particle surface M2. So that the<br>
potential of the particle double layer is matched to the left and right rotating molecules in the<br>
injection channel, at first a polar field adapted to the electric current potential is built up, which<br>
produces in the microcapillaries a stationary velocity field with an asymmetric potential<br>
distribution. For that, a potential difference'of' ∆φ0 = 500 V is applied in the transversal resonator<br>
between the two electrodes (Wave guide). The dimensionless potential at the substrate then<br>
amounts to Φ11 = 1 and at the walls Φ21 = 0. The particles M2 flow through the microcapillaries<br>
formed in phase 1 in the direction of the substrate surface by the asymptotic adaptation to the<br>
electrical boundary condition and the rotating field, which is formed by the rotation of the two<br>
electrodes (Wave guide). Having arrived there, they transfer a part of the kinetic energy to the<br>
phase surface "Substrate ↔ Layer", where they form a molecular separating layer through the<br>
local modification of the Zeta potential.<br>
[0025] Phase 3a: (Figure 7) In the Phase 3a, nonionic molecules are accumulated on the outside<br>
of the organic layer. After a molecular occupation of the outer boundary layer, the surface energy<br>
is increased. The boundary layer curves in a concave shape towards outside. Simultaneously,<br>
amphoteric molecules diffuse in the still open capillaries. After the loss of their kinetic energy,<br><br><br>
they remain stuck in the layer system. A distribution arises in the layer system through the<br>
different amounts of kinetic energies of the individual amphoteric molecules. Phase 3b: (Figure 8)<br>
The energy-deficient amphoteric molecules resonant in a high frequency energy field and<br>
changes into anions. Simultaneously, they form a network of small areas through which crack-<br>
shaped capillaries arise in the organic layer, in which the active materials are transported to the<br>
anions in the Phase 4.<br>
[0026] Phase 4: (Figures 9 and 10) In Phase 4, the method "Phase transfer catalysis" is used.<br>
This enables reactions between substances, which are in different non-mixable phases. Nothing<br>
happens by the contact of the anionic phase Mx with the enzyme phase My loaded with<br>
nanoparticles. The reaction occurs only if an ion extracts from the phase Mx through the interface<br>
Mxy to the phase My. Then, a vigorous reaction arises in the phase space Mx, y through the<br>
catalytic action of the enzymes, which causes in the double layer a potential jump at the interface<br>
of the nanoparticles. This potential jump leads to an instability of the phase space Mx, y, the<br>
consequence of which is that the phase space cells decompose within a few microseconds to<br>
their components. Isolated, large, energetic centres arise in the organic layer through the bonding<br>
energy released thereby, which lead to the chipping of large areas (for example, colour<br>
agglomerations) in the organic layer in the macro area.<br>
[0027] Basically no materials are dissolved with the given cleaning process. According to the<br>
process stage, mixtures arise, which degenerate partially by itself or under the influence of the<br>
process. It is common to all these processes that, for the achievement of the desired effect,<br>
interaction forces must exist between the equal and unequal partners. The bandwidth for the<br>
possible uses of the process is very large. It can be used with a suitable microemulsion, not only<br>
for coating removals, but also for coatings. This is possible through the specific production of<br>
desired double layers with a suitable matrix. Primarily, the possible modifications of physical<br>
properties and the self-organisation of the nanoparticles as well as the properties of double layers<br>
are used in the process. Consequently, systems can be built up which achieve a large effect for<br>
the least energy expenditure possible. Besides the physical modifications in double layers,<br>
specific chemical modifications can also be produced with the process. The process can be used<br>
likewise for the forming of molecular layers with new solid properties in the nano range.<br><br><br>
