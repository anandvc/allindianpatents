				<td>SHIFT-LEVER APPARATUS OF AN AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION FOR ENABLING MANUAL MODE OPERATION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a shift-lever apparatus of an automatic transmission for enabling manual mode operation, and more particularly, to a shift-lever apparatus whose switch-operating mechanism is modularized.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In general, an automatic transmission automatically changes shift-speed based on driving circumstances according to predetermined shift-patterns.<br>
Only a few factors for driving circumstances are reflected in shift-patterns, and therefore, in some extraordinary situations the shift-speed automatically engaged by the automatic transmission is not satisfactory to a driver.<br>
Although a lot of investigation on shift-patterns has proceeded in order to minimize occurrence of inappropriate shifting in such extraordinary situations, a new shift-pattern will not always satisfy every driver.<br>
A manual mode for an automatic transmission has been introduced for that reason. The additional mode enables manual shifting by sensing a driver's request and accordingly changing shift-speeds.<br>
An example of a shift-lever operation pattern for an automatic transmission provided with such a manual-mode function is shown in FIG. 1. As shown in FIG. 1, a shift-lever apparatus for an automatic transmission provided with such a manual-mode function is provided with a manual-shift column 12<br>
connected to an ordinary shift column 11 in order to detect a driver's request by<br>
operation of a shift lever.<br>
Usually the manual shift column 12 is aligned in parallel with the<br>
ordinary shift column 11 and connected to the same at a "D" shift-lever position by a gate (usually called a manual gate) 13.<br>
If a shift lever is located at the "D" position, the automatic transmission changes shift-speeds according to predetermined shift patterns. If the shift lever is moved to the manual shift column 12, the automatic transmission changes shift-speeds according to a driver's request for upshift, sensed when the shift lever is moved to the "+" position, or a driver's request for downshift, sensed when the shift lever is moved to the "-" position. The requests for upshift and downshift are sensed by switches, which are called manual mode switches hereinafter.<br>
FIGS. 2a and 2b show an exemplary shift-lever apparatus of an automatic transmission for enabling such manual mode operation, where FIG. 2a shows a side view and FIG. 2b shows a plan view of the exemplary shift-lever apparatus.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 2a and 2b, a damper 22 is located at a shift-lever 21, and a mechanism for realizing such manual mode operation is attached to the damper 22. The mechanism includes a spring 25 for selectively activating "+" and "-" switches 23 and 24, linkage levers 26, and a switch plate 27. The mechanism also includes a manual mode switch 28 to detect positioning of the shift lever 21 in the manual shift column 12.<br>
Such a mechanism for realizing manual mode operation is installed at<br>
an upper end of the shift-lever 21  below an indicator (not shown), which increases height and size of the shift-lever apparatus.<br>
A plurality of u n-modularized components makes the structure of the mechanism complex and increases manufacturing cost.<br>
The information disclosed in this Background of the Invention section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the invention and should not be taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that this information forms the prior art that is already known to a person skilled in the art. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will hereinafter be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 3 is a perspective exterior view of a shift-lever apparatus of an automatic transmission according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention; FIG. 4 is a perspective interior view of the shift-lever apparatus shown in FIG. 3, having a housing 30 disassembled; FIG. 5 illustrates operation of the shift-lever apparatus, having a cover 51 disassembled; and FIG. 6 is an exploded view for showing connections of principal components shown in FIG. 5.<br>
Features of the present embodiment are described hereinafter, while conventional features of a shift-lever apparatus of an automatic transmission for enabling manual mode operation that are also used herein will not be explained. As shown in the figures, a shift-lever apparatus of an automatic transmission for enabling manual mode operation according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes: an indicator 31 at its uppermost portion; a housing 30 for containing all components including a shift-lever 41, the shift-lever 41 being connected to a rotating unit disposed at a lower portion of the housing 30 such that the shift-lever 41 can rotate about the rotating unit; a base member 42 fixed to the shift-lever 41 and enclosed by the housing 30 such that the base member 42 moves according to the movement of the shift-lever 41; "+" and "-" switches 44 and 43 each being disposed at either side of the base member 42 such that the "+" and "-" switches 44 and 43 are selectively operated according to the movement of the shift-lever 41; a switch operating unit disposed at the base member 42 such that the switch operating unit selectively presses the "+" and "-" switches 44 and 43; and a manual mode switch 45 disposed at the base member 42 such that the manual mode switch 45 operates in the manual mode.<br>
The rotating unit includes a hinge shaft 32 mounted at a lower portion of<br>
the housing 30 in a direction perpendicular to the shift-lever 41, and a base block 33 rotatably supported by the hinge shaft 32 and for rotatably supporting the base member 42.<br>
The switch operating unit includes: a pressing plate 46, mounted to an upper portion of the base member 42, for selectively pressing the "+" and "-" switches 44 and 43 according to left and right movement of the shift-lever 41; and a spring 47, mounted at the pressing plate 46, for providing a restoring force thereto.<br>
The p ressing plate 46 is mounted to the base member 42 such that relative motion therebetween, for example, in the direction of arrows shown in FIG. 5, is enabled. The spring 47 is abutted by both the base member 42 and the pressing plate 46 such that the spring 47 generates a restoring force to diminish the relative displacement of the pressing plate 46 and the base member 42. The relative motion of the pressing plate 46 is guided by an arc-shaped inner wall 61 of the base member 42.<br>
Furthermore, in order to limit the relative movement between the pressing plate 42 and the housing 30, a locking member 34, being fixed to the housing 30, penetrates the pressing plate 46.<br>
The above described components are covered by a cover 51 as shown in FIG. 4. That is, the cover 51 is attached to the base member 42 such that the "+" and "-" switches 44 and 43, the switch operating unit, and the manual mode switch 45 are securely covered.<br>
The operation of the shift-lever apparatus of a preferred embodiment of the present invention is hereinafter described, while operations also featured by<br>
a conventional shift-lever apparatus will not be explained.<br>
As can be gathered from the drawings, all the components for enabling manual mode operation are modularized. That is, firstly, the base member 42 is unified with the shift-lever 41. Secondly, the "+" and "-" switches 44 and 43, the pressing plate 46, the spring 47, and the manual mode switch 45 are installed to the base member 42 and covered by the cover 51.<br>
The base member 42 is rotatably connected to the base block 33 which is also rotatable connected to the hinge shaft 32. Therefore, the shift-lever 41 can rotate left-and-right (that is, as in arrow directions in FIG. 5).<br>
When the shift-lever 41 is moved to the "+" direction in FIG. 5, the "+" switch 44 moves along with the base member 42 fixed to the shift-lever 41 whereas the movement of pressing plate 46 is limited by the locking member 34. Therefore, the pressing plate 46 presses and activates the "+" switch 44.<br>
When the moving force applied to the shift-lever 41 is released, the pressing the "+" switch 44 of the pressing plate 46 is released by the restoring force of the spring 47.<br>
In the same way, when the shift-lever 41 is moved to the "-" direction, the pressing plate 46 activates the "-" switch 43, and its pressing of the "-" switch 43 is released by the restoring force of the spring 47 when the moving force in the "-" direction is released.<br>
As described above, a shift-lever apparatus of an automatic transmission for enabling manual mode operation according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention has the following effects.<br>
Necessary  components  for enabling  manual   mode  operation   are<br>
modularized. Therefore, the total size of a shift-lever apparatus can be reduced and its productivity increased, which consequently reduces manufacturing costs.<br>
Noise is reduced because the necessary components operate within such a module.<br>
Furthermore, electric contact failure can be minimized because of stableness in assembly.<br>
While this invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments, but, on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.<br>
Throughout this specification and the claims which follow, unless explicitly described to the contrary, the word "comprise" or variations such as a "comprises" or "comprising" will be understood to imply the inclusion of stated elements but not the exclusion of any other elements.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
