				<td>Coated tool<br>
The invention concerns a cutting tool having a base body and a<br>
single-layer or multi-layer coating applied thereto.<br>
State of the art<br>
Cutting tools comprise a base body which is made for example from<br>
hard metal or carbide metal, cermet, steel or high-speed steel. Frequently<br>
a single-layer or multi-layer coating is applied to the base body to increase<br>
the service lives or also to improve the cutting properties. That single-layer<br>
or multi-layer coating includes for example metallic hard material layers,<br>
oxide layers and the like. CVD processes (chemical vapour deposition)<br>
and/or PVD processes (physical vapour deposition) are used for applying<br>
the layer. A plurality of layers within a coating can be applied exclusively<br>
by means of CVD processes, exclusively by means of PVD processes or by a<br>
combination of those processes. CVD processes provide substantially<br>
stable phases of the desired compounds whereas PVD processes also make<br>
it possible to apply metastable phases of compounds.<br>
In regard to the PVD processes, a distinction is made between<br>
various variants such as for example magnetron sputtering, arc vapour<br>
deposition (arc PVD), ion plating, electron beam evaporation and laser<br>
ablation. Magnetron sputtering and arc vapour deposition are among the<br>
PVD processes which are most frequently used for coating tools. There are<br>
in turn different modifications or variations of those PVD process variants<br>
such as for example pulsed or unpulsed magnetron sputtering or pulsed or<br>
unpulsed arc vapour deposition and so forth.<br>
DE 10 2004 044 240 A1 discloses a cutting tool with a layer structure<br>
having at least one single-phase, metastable, at least ternary oxide layer,<br>
wherein the oxide layer, besides oxygen, includes at least two further<br>
chemical elements selected from the elements in subgroups IV, V or VI of<br>
the period system, aluminium and silicon, of which one of the elements<br>
forms a primary component and at least a further one of the elements<br>
forms at least one secondary component.<br>
DE 199 37 284 A1 describes an electrically conducting multi-layer<br>
structure on a metallic substrate with a first layer comprising a metal<br>
material, in particular chromium, which is surface-passivating by naturally<br>
formed oxide, and a further layer applied by means of a PVD process<br>
comprising a gold or gold alloy material. That second layer is capable of at<br>
least partially neutralising the electrically insulating action of the naturally<br>
formed oxide film of the first layer. Arrangements which are coated in that<br>
way are used for example as carrier parts for screened mounting of<br>
electronic components.<br>
DE 196 51 592 A1 describes a coated cutting tool having a multi-<br>
layer coating which includes at least an aluminium oxide layer and metallic<br>
hard material layers. The metallic hard material layers are for example<br>
TiAIN layers applied by means of PVD processes. The aluminium oxide<br>
layer applied directly thereto is also deposited using a PVD process.<br>
DE 199 42 303 Al describes a cutting insert bit having a multi-phase<br>
aluminium oxide layer produced by a CVD process. The layer produced by<br>
the CVD process contains aluminium oxide, zirconium oxide and a third<br>
finely dispersed phase comprising an oxide, oxycarbide, oxynitride or<br>
oxycarbonitride of titanium.<br>
DE 197 37 470 Al describes a cutting body having a coating which<br>
has at least one multi-phase layer. The coating produced by a CVD process<br>
includes for example a zirconium carbonitride layer (cubic ZrCN) and ZrO2<br>
in monoclinic and/or tetragonal form. The crystalline ZrCN matrix acts as a<br>
hard coating whereas the ZrO2 incorporated therein acts as a dry lubricant.<br>
DE 196 41 468 Al describes a composite body such as for example a<br>
cutting tool having a multi-layer coating with thin aluminium oxide layers<br>
and/or zirconium oxide layers.<br>
In coating cutting tools, in particular using a PVD process, only<br>
relatively thin coatings can be applied because of the normally insulating<br>
properties of the deposited layers. With an increasing layer thickness the<br>
procedure for deposition of the ions out of the plasma becomes unstable,<br>
which manifests itself for example particularly severely at the corners and<br>
edges of the coated body and detrimentally influences the hardness of the<br>
layers. To produce a cutting tool having a hard coating which has good<br>
properties even when greater layer thicknesses are involved stabilisation of<br>
the deposition procedure would therefore be desirable over a prolonged<br>
period of time, that is to say even when greater layer thicknesses are<br>
involved.<br>
Object<br>
The object of the present invention was that of providing cutting<br>
tools which are improved over the state of the art.<br>
The object according to the invention is attained by a cutting tool<br>
having a base body and a single-layer or multi-layer coating applied<br>
thereto, which is characterised in that the coating includes at least one two-<br>
phase or multi-phase layer which contains at least two different phases of<br>
metal oxide, wherein the at least one two-phase or multi-phase layer is<br>
electrically conductive.<br>
As already stated hereinbefore, the application of a single-layer or<br>
multi-layer coating to a cutting tool as a wear-resistant coating has long<br>
been known. What is novel in contrast is the production of such a coating<br>
with at least one two-phase or multi-phase layer which is electrically<br>
conductive and contains two different phases of metal oxide. That novel<br>
coating of the present invention opens up a wide range of possible options<br>
in terms of improving and/or adapting the resistance to wear, the service<br>
lives and/or the cutting properties of cutting tools.<br>
The resistance to wear, service life and cutting properties of a<br>
coating on a cutting tool depend on various factors such as for example the<br>
material of the base body of the cutting tool, the sequence, nature and<br>
composition of further layers present in the coating, the thickness of the<br>
various layers and not last the nature of the cutting operation performed<br>
with the cutting tool. For one and the same cutting tool, different<br>
resistances to wear can occur in dependence on the nature of the<br>
workpiece to be machined, the respective machining process and the<br>
further conditions during machining such as for example the generation of<br>
high temperatures or the use of corrosive cooling fluids. In addition a<br>
distinction is drawn between various kinds of wear which depending on the<br>
respective machining operation can influence the useful life of a tool, that is<br>
to say its service life, to a greater or lesser degree. Therefore further<br>
development of and improvement in cutting tools is always to be<br>
considered having regard to which tool properties are to be improved and is<br>
to be assessed under comparable conditions in relation to the state of the<br>
art.<br>
The at least one two-phase or multi-phase electrically conductive<br>
layer with at least two different phases of metal oxide, which is present in<br>
the coating according to the invention, can impart to the entire coating of<br>
the cutting tool properties which make the cutting tool superior to known<br>
cutting tools in comparable cutting operations and under comparable<br>
conditions. Those properties can involve resistance to wear, service lives,<br>
cutting properties or combinations thereof.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention in the coating the at<br>
least two different phases of metal oxide in the at least one two-phase or<br>
multi-phase electrically conductive layer are at least two different phases of<br>
chromium oxide. The at least one two-phase or multi-phase layer can<br>
substantially completely consist of chromium oxide. Preferably it includes<br>
chromium oxide at least as a main component, that is to say in an amount<br>
which is predominant in relation to possible further components, with a<br>
proportion of chromium in relation to other metallic elements of at least 80<br>
atomic %, preferably at least 90 atomic %, particularly preferably at least<br>
95 atomic %. As a secondary component the at least two-phase or multi-<br>
phase layer can contain carbides, nitrides, oxides, carbonitrides,<br>
oxynitrides, oxycarbides, oxycarbonitrides, borides, boronitrides and<br>
oxoboronitrides of the elements of groups IVa to VIla of the periodic<br>
system and/or aluminium and/or silicon, hybrid metallic phases and phase<br>
mixtures of the aforementioned compounds, wherein chromium is excluded<br>
as an element of the secondary component.<br>
Main component in accordance with the present invention signifies<br>
that the metallic element is present in relation to other metallic elements of<br>
the same layer in an amount of at least 80 atomic %, preferably at least 90<br>
atomic %, particularly preferably at least 95 atomic %. The compounds of<br>
the other metals in the same layer are referred in accordance with the<br>
present invention as a secondary component.<br>
In a further embodiment the at least one two-phase or multi-phase<br>
layer has at least three phases, wherein there is at least one phase of<br>
aluminium oxide. In this embodiment the other metal oxide which is not<br>
aluminium oxide and of which there are at least two different phases in the<br>
layer can be present as the main component and aluminium oxide as the<br>
secondary component. In a preferred variant of this embodiment the two-<br>
phase or multi-phase layer contains at least two phases of chromium oxide<br>
as the main component and a phase of aluminium oxide as the secondary<br>
component or hybrid phases of chromium oxide and aluminium oxide.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention one of the metal oxide<br>
phases in the two-phase or multi-phase layer is a stable phase of metal<br>
oxide. In the embodiment according to the invention in which the at least<br>
one two-phase or multi-phase layer contains chromium oxide as the main<br>
component, the stable phase of metal oxide is preferably a phase of Cr2O3.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention at least one of the metal<br>
oxide phases in the two-phase or multi-phase layer is a metastable phase.<br>
In the embodiment in which the at least one two-phase or multi-phase<br>
layer contains chromium oxide as the main component the metastable<br>
phase is preferably a metastable phase of chromium oxide of the<br>
stoichiometry CrOx, with 0.7 
The term "stable phase" in accordance with this invention signifies a<br>
phase which under the given conditions is in a thermodynamically stable<br>
equilibrium state and does not change.<br>
The term "metastable phase" in accordance with this invention<br>
signifies a phase which is only apparently in a thermodynamic equilibrium<br>
state because under the given conditions such as for example pressure<br>
and/or temperature the equilibrium setting speed, that is to say the<br>
transition into the thermodynamically stable, lower-energy state, is too low.<br>
Metastable phases or states are such phases or states which only go into<br>
stable phases or states by elimination of an impediment. Elimination of the<br>
impediment can be effected by input of energy such as for example an<br>
increase in temperature or pressure.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention in which the at least two<br>
different phases of metal oxide in the two-phase or multi-phase layer are<br>
chromium oxide phases, the elements chromium and oxygen taken<br>
together in the stable and metastable phases involve a ratio of Cr to O of<br>
about 1 to 0.8 - 1.2. If the ratio of Cr to O is greater than 1 to 0.8 (that is<br>
to say 1 to 
soft. If the ratio of Cr to O is less than 1 to 1.2 (that is to say 1 to &gt;1.2)<br>
that has the disadvantage that the layer becomes too brittle.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention among the at<br>
least two different phases of metal oxide in the at least one two-phase or<br>
multi-phase layer at least one metal oxide phase is electrically conductive.<br>
If the main component of the two-phase or multi-phase layer comprises<br>
chromium oxide, then no phase of CrO2 which considered in itself would<br>
represent a conductive chromium oxide phase is included. The absence of<br>
a phase of CrO2 in the electrically conductive layer can be detected by<br>
means of XPS measurement. In such a layer containing chromium oxide as<br>
the main component, phases of Cr2O3, CrO3, CrOx with 0.7 
detected by means of XPS measurement, but no phase of CrO2 (see Figure<br>
1). The electrical conductivity of the two-phase or multi-phase layer is<br>
therefore not based on the presence of CrO2 which is electrically conductive<br>
in itself.<br>
The at least one two-phase or multi-phase layer of the coating is<br>
preferably of a layer thickness of 10 nm to 50 µm. If the layer thickness of<br>
the two-phase or multi-phase layer is less than 10 nm, its protective or<br>
wear resistance function is excessively low. If the layer thickness of the<br>
two-phase or multi-phase layer is greater than 50 µm excessively high<br>
stresses occur in the layer and the layer becomes too brittle, and that can<br>
lead to adhesion problems and spalling in operation of the tool. In a<br>
further embodiment the layer is of a layer thickness of 20 nm to 20 µm. In<br>
still a further embodiment the layer is of a layer thickness of 0.5 µm to 4 <br>
µm.<br>
Usually the at least one two-phase or multi-phase layer is of a<br>
Vickers hardness (Hv) of 500 to 4000. In a preferred embodiment the<br>
layer is of a Vickers hardness (Hv) of 700 to 3000. In still a further<br>
preferred embodiment the layer is of a Vickers hardness (Hv) of 800 to<br>
2000.<br>
The electrical conductivity of the at least one two-phase or multi-<br>
phase layer in the coating of the present invention is markedly higher than<br>
that of non-conductors and semiconductors and is of the order of<br>
magnitude of metallic conductors. It is desirably more than 1 S/m.<br>
Preferably the electrical conductivity is more than 100 S/m. In a further<br>
embodiment the layer is of an electrical conductivity of more than 104 S/m.<br>
The electrical conductivity of the two-phase or multi-phase layer<br>
contained in the coating according to the invention is a surprising<br>
phenomenon as the layer as the main component contains metal oxides<br>
which are usually non-conducting. The conductivity of the layer is also not<br>
to be attributed to the presence of phases of pure metals as they are to be<br>
found in the layer not at all or only in negligibly small amounts which<br>
cannot explain electrical conductivity of the overall layer. The two-phase or<br>
multi-phase layer in the coating of the invention also does not contain any<br>
phases of metal oxides which considered in themselves are known to be<br>
electrically conductive such as for example CrO2, in proportions which could<br>
explain electrical conductivity of the overall layer.<br>
It is not possible at the present time to provide a definite explanation<br>
of the electrical conductivity of the two-phase or multi-phase layers<br>
according to the invention in the coating. It is assumed however that the<br>
two-phase or multi-phase layer according to the invention contains<br>
metastable, non-stoichiometric metal oxide phases which impart to the<br>
overall layer electrical conductivity of the order of magnitude of the<br>
conductivity of metals and which contribute to the excellent material<br>
properties of the coating according to the invention.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention the at least one two-phase<br>
or multi-phase layer further has at least one secondary component. As a<br>
secondary component or components the at least one two-phase or multi-<br>
phase layer can contain carbides, nitrides, oxides, carbonitrides,<br>
oxynitrides, oxycarbides, oxycarbonitrides, borides, boronitrides and<br>
oxoboronitrides of the elements of groups IVa to Vlla of the periodic<br>
system and/or aluminium and/or silicon, hybrid-metallic phases and phase<br>
mixtures of the aforementioned compounds. Examples of such secondary<br>
compounds are (Al, Cr)2O3 with a ratio by weight of AI:Cr = 9:1, (Cr, AI,<br>
Si)2O3 with a ratio by weight of AI:Si = 9:1 and Cr:(AI, Si) = 1:2.<br>
If the coating of the cutting tool according to the invention is of a<br>
multi-layer structure it can include further hard material layers of the<br>
compositions specified hereinbefore for the secondary components.<br>
Examples of such hard material layers are layers comprising Al2O3, TiN,<br>
TiB2, cBN,hBN, TiBN, TiC, TiCN, TiN, TiAIN, CrAIN, TiAICN, TiAlYN, TiAICrN<br>
and CrN. Instead of or in addition to one or more hard material layers the<br>
coating can have one or more further two-phase or multi-phase layers<br>
which contain at least two different phases of metal oxide and are<br>
electrically conductive. The present invention thus includes coatings which<br>
only comprise one or more of the two-phase or multi-phase layers with at<br>
least two different phases of metal oxide of electrical conductivity, and also<br>
coatings which include any combination of such layers with further hard<br>
material layers in any number and sequence.<br>
Preferred coatings of the cutting tool according to the invention<br>
involve the following layers:<br>
(Al, Cr)2O3 - AlCrN - (AI, Cr)O,<br>
TiAIN - (Al, Cr)O,<br>
AlCrN - (Al, Cr)O,<br>
TiAIN - Al2O3 - (AI, Cr)O,<br>
CrAIN - [(Al, Cr)O - Al2O3]x - ZrN<br>
The two-phase or multi-phase layer contained in the coating of the<br>
cutting tool according to the invention, having at least two different phases<br>
of metal oxide and of electrical conductivity, is preferably produced by a<br>
PVD process, particularly preferably by magnetron sputtering, arc vapour<br>
deposition (arc PVD) or modifications of those processes. In the PVD<br>
coating installation a plasma atmosphere is produced at low pressure,<br>
which substantially comprises argon and oxygen. In the PVD magnetron<br>
process an argon plasma is fired in front of the target. High-power cathode<br>
sputtering occurs (magnetron sputtering). The metal vapour produced<br>
from the target in that way is deposited on the substrate with a reaction<br>
with the oxygen as a metal oxide layer.<br>
Further advantages, features and embodiments of the present<br>
invention are described by reference to the following examples and the<br>
Figure.<br>
Example 1<br>
In a PVD coating installation (Flexicoat; Hauzer Techno Coating) hard<br>
metal substrates were provided with a two-layer PVD coating. Prior to<br>
deposition of the layers the installation was evacuated to 1x10-5 mbars and<br>
the hard metal surface was cleaned by ion etching at 170 V bias voltage.<br>
Substrate compositions:<br>
1) HM-fine grain + 10.5 % by weight Co<br>
2) HM-coarse grain + 10.5 % by weight Co +1 % by weight MC<br>
3) HM-coarse grain + 11.0 % by weight Co +1 % by weight MC<br>
(Explanation:<br>
HM-fine grain = WC hard metal of mean grain size of ~ 1 µm<br>
HM-coarse grain = WC hard metal of mean grain size of 3 - 5 µm)<br>
MC = mixed carbides (TiC, TaC ...).<br>
Substrate geometry: SEHW120408 (in accordance with DIN-ISO 1832)<br>
Deposition of the layers:<br>
1st layer: TiAIIM<br>
• arc deposition<br>
• target: Ti/AI (33/67 atomic %), round source (63 mm diameter),<br>
• 80 amperes, 495°C, 3 Pa N2 pressure, 40 volts substrate bias voltage,<br>
• 3 µm layer thickness;<br>
2nd layer: (Al, Cr)2O3<br>
• reactive magnetron sputtering,<br>
• target: Al/Cr (90/10 atomic %), round source (63 mm diameter),<br>
• 10 kW sputter power, 495°C, 0.5 Pa Ar pressure, about 100 sccm O2,<br>
150 volts substrate bias voltage (unipolarly pulsed),<br>
• 1 µm layer thickness.<br>
The TiAIN layer serves for bonding between the substrate and the<br>
oxidic layer. XRD measurements, XPS measurements, microprobe<br>
measurements and resistance measurements were performed on the<br>
coating. The microprobe measurements for determining the overall<br>
composition were performed on a single (Al, Cr)2O3 layer as measurements<br>
on the layer composite TiAIN-(AI, Cr)2O3 with the microprobe leads to<br>
measurement errors. Resistance and conductivity measurements showed<br>
that the (Al, Cr)2O3 layer in the case of all substrates was overall electrically<br>
conductive, with conductivity levels of about 10 S/m.<br>
It was established by XRD and XPS measurement that the (Al, Cr)2O3<br>
layer in the case of all substrates contained a stable y-AI2O3 phase, two<br>
stable Cr-oxide phases (CrO3, Cr2O3) and a rnetastable Cr-oxide phase<br>
(CrOx). Figure 1 shows the XPS spectrum of Cr (Mg Ka radiation). XPS<br>
measurement confirmed that the layer contained a total of 3 chromium<br>
oxide phases. The phase proportions estimated from XPS measurement<br>
were approximately as follows:<br>
Cr2O3 65 % by weight<br>
CrOx 20 % by weight<br>
CrO3 15 % by weight,<br>
wherein x was 0.9. In addition the results of the measurement operations<br>
showed that, within the (Al, Cr)2O3 layer, the rnetastable Cr-oxide phase<br>
was the only one of the metal oxide phases which was electrically<br>
conductive and imparted conductivity to the overall layer. A phase of<br>
conductive CrO2 could be excluded by virtue of the ascertained phase<br>
proportions and the proportion of oxygen determined by microprobe<br>
measurement.<br>
Comparative example<br>
For comparison purposes the same substrates as in Example 1 were<br>
provided in the same coating installation with a two-layer coating of the<br>
layer sequence 3 µm TiAIN - 1 µm Al2O3. The deposition conditions were<br>
the same as in Example 1 with the exception that a pure Al target was used<br>
in the step for the deposition of the Al2O3 layer.<br><br>
In a milling trial on a workpiece comprising 42CrMoV4 steel<br>
(strength: 850 MPa) the tools of Example 1 and the comparative example<br>
were compared. Milling was effected in the downcut mode without cooling<br>
lubricant at a cutting speed Vc = 236 m/min and a tooth feed fz = 0.2 mm.<br>
The amount of wear was measured on the tool flank surface in the<br>
form of the average wear mark width VB in mm (at the main cutting edge)<br>
after a milling travel of 4800 mm. The following wear mark widths VB were<br>
found:<br><br>
