				<td>POP PIPE WRENCH<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a wrench.. Though reference is made to a pipe and its related fittings as one of the applications of the wrench of the present invention, it is not intended to be limited thereto and it may advantageously be employed with any round or hex stock.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Pipe wrenches are known in the art and which normally comprise two jaws, one is a fixed jaw and another is movable jaw. A linear movement to the movable jaw being imparted by a mechanism similar to a screw and nut arrangement. Thus, a linear movement of the movable jaw is possible either towards or away from the fixed jaw and is imparted by the rotatable movement of a nut. When the pipe is held between the jaws of the wrench, the wrench is operated so as to release or tighten the pipe.<br>
However, a distinct disadvantage associated with such a known construction of a wrench is that for each operation the jaws are to be adjusted for holding For each rotation of the wrench, to cause tightening and release of the pipe, it is necessary to adjust the jaws of the wrench by<br><br>
actuation of the nut so as to restore the wrench to its original position. The nut is then again actuated so that the jaws grip the pipe and the rotatable movement of the wrench is repeated. It would be apparent that such a process is labourious, time consuming and inconvenient<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a novel construction of a wrench for opening and closing of any round stock and hex.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a wrench having self adjusted properties and also which does not require any frequent adjustment for each rotation of the wrench.<br>
Further, objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
According   to   this   invention   there   is   provided   a   wrench   for loosening and tightening of round stocks and hex characterized in that: (i)        An operating handle with a distant end, (ii)      A fixed jaw having an outwardly curved profile at the upper end of said handle wherein the center line of profile is offset from the center line of jaw,<br>
(iii) A movable jaw having only an angular movement and pivotally held to said fixed jaw, the movable jaw has a ledge on the upper outer surface,<br>
(iv) Said movable jaw having an inner extending profile corporating with the outward curved profile of the fixed jaw, wherein the profiles of the fixed and movable jaws are having angular teeth and the inner profile movable jaw comprises as inclined surface on either end of middle straight surface.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION WITH REFERECE TO ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS:<br>
The objects and advantages of this invention will be apparent the ensuing description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows the wrench of the present invention.<br>
Referring to fig. 1 the item (i) comprises a handle having a head member (3) at the upper end. Preferably head member (3) is integrally formed with handle (1). Head member (3) constitutes the fixed jaws and has an outwardly curved profile (4). Further, and as shown in fig. 1, the angle of contact of profile (4) gradually varies from the center line of profile (4) and in the direction of either end. Further, the center line of profile (4) is offset from the center line jaws (3). Fig. 1 illustrates the profile (4) to have teeth (5) so as to facilitate a gripping action of the stock.<br>
The wrench further comprises a movable jaw (6) but having only an angular displacement and not a linear displacement as known from the prior art. Jaw (6) has an inner profile (7) co-operating with the profile (4) of fixed jaw (3) and comprises two inclined<br>
surfaces (8) on either ends of straight surface (9). Profile (7) has also teeth (14).<br><br>
In an initial position, the leading end (10) of the inner surface or profile (7) of jaw (6)<br>
is disposed away from the leading end (11) of the curved profile (4) of fixed jaw (3) so as to<br>
allow in an introduction of the round stock in the direction of  corresponding to the <br><br><br>
diameter of the round stock and upon introduction in the direction of arrow (a), the movable         <br><br>
jaw (6) is angularly displaced away from fixed jaw (3). The angular displacement is   <br><br>
dependent on the diameter of the round stock. When a force is applied to the distant end (2a) of handle (2), a torque develops on the stock. Under operation, the open end (12) of jaws (3) and (6) firmly grip the round stock and upon a force being applied to the distinct end (2a) of the round stock is rotated so as to allow a tightening or loosening action. Thereafter handle, (1) is rotated in the opposite direction so that jaws (3) and (6) release the stock and handle (1) is returned to the original position,-The above operation is repeated. Thus it will be apparent that the wrench can now be operated upon by a single hand of an operator. Furthermore, the time consuming and labourious operation of tightening and releasing the nut provided in the known construction of wrenches is no longer requried by the wrench of the present invention.<br><br><br>
Movable jaw (6) is pivotally held to fixed jaw (3) through a pivot pin (13) consisting two disc-washers on both sides and disposed away from the central vertical axis of handle (2). Though shown only in Fig. 1 Jaw (6) has a ledge (14) so as that an operator can actuate jaw (6) through said ledge.<br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM<br>
1.	A wrench  for loosening and  tightening of round  stocks  and  hex<br>
comprising an operating handle, a fixed jaw at the upper end of said<br>
handle, a movable jaw pivotably held to said fixed jaw characterized in<br>
that the operating handle having a distant end provided with the fixed<br>
jaw having an outwardly curved profile wherein the center line of profile<br>
is offset from the center line of jaw, the movable jaw has a ledge on the<br>
upper outer surface, said movable jaw having an inner extending profile<br>
corporating with the outward curved profile of the fixed jaw, wherein<br>
the profiles of the fixed and movable jaws are having angular teeth and<br>
the inner profile movable jaw comprises as inclined surface on either<br>
end of middle straight surface.<br>
2.	A wrench as claimed in claim 1 wherein said movable jaw is held to the<br>
fixed jaw through a pivot pin comprising two disc-washer on both sides.<br>
3.	A wrench as claimed in claim 2 wherein said pivot pin is disposed away<br>
from the central vertical axis of the handle.<br></td>
