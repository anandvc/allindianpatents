				<td>TORQUE INDICATOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to torque indicators applied to a valve assembly<br>
and more particularly to visual indicators for determining whether the amount of torque<br>
being asserted on an actuator or valve assembly by a handwheel exceeds the torque<br>
limits thereof and to maximum torque indicators.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Actuators and valve assembly components may be operated or driven by<br>
devices such as handwheel assemblies. The rotation of a handwheel in either a<br>
clockwise or counter-clockwise direction imparts a rotational force on a drive shaft,<br>
which in turn, operates an actuator or valve assembly. For example, a handwheel<br>
device typically used to drive actuators and valve assemblies is illustrated in FIG. 1.<br>
Rotation of the handwheel drives a shaft or drive sleeve within the actuator, which in<br>
turn either drives a valve stem directly, or indirectly via a set of gears. The use of<br>
handwheels and handwheel devices with actuators and valve assemblies is well known.<br>
Actuators and valve assemblies driven by handwheels are typically subject to<br>
torque limitations. Application of torque beyond the torque limits of an actuator or<br>
valve assembly can damage the actuator or valve assembly. Once an excessive amount<br>
of torque has been applied to an actuator or a valve assembly, the device typically<br>
needs replacement.<br>
To prevent damage caused by the excessive application of torque, warnings are<br>
usually printed in the user manuals that accompany the actuators or valve assemblies.<br>
In other instances, warnings may also be placed on actuator housings or on handwheels<br>
attached to an actuator in order to discourage an over-application of torque to the<br>
assembly. During operation, however, it is difficult, if not impossible, for an operator<br>
to determine the amount of torque being applied to an actuator or valve assembly. This<br>
is especially true when an operator can only estimate the amount of torque that is being<br>
applied to a device based upon their experience or on a feel for the amount of force that<br>
they are applying at any given time.<br>
ID many cases, there is no mechanism to prevent the application of an excessive<br>
amount of torque to an actuator or a valve assembly. More often than not, when<br>
 <br>
excessive torque is applied to an actuator or valve assembly, the excessive torque<br>
causes damage to the actuator or valve assembly, resulting in the need for maintenance<br>
or replacement of the actuator or valve assembly. Therefore, it would be desirable to<br>
provide a mechanism by which an operator could determine whether the torque limits<br>
of an actuator or valve assembly have been exceeded.<br>
Although the application of excessive force and torque to an actuator or valve<br>
assembly is undesirable, emergency situations may arise which require such<br>
application. In those instances, the ability of an operator to override the torque limits<br>
for an actuator or valve assembly should not be hindered.<br>
Furthermore, in many of the cases where damage is caused by the use of<br>
excessive torque with a device, the manufacturer may be called upon to fix the device<br>
based upon a warranty. The inability of the manufacturer to determine whether a<br>
device was damaged due to the application of an excessive amount of torque to the<br>
device or whether some other legitimate: damage occurred is important. Therefore, it is<br>
desirable to provide a mechanism by which manufacturers may monitor or determine<br>
when damage to an actuator or valve assembly has been caused by the application of<br>
excessive amounts of torque to the device rather than by a defect or normal wear-and-<br>
tear of the device.<br>
Thus, there is a need to provide a mechanism by which the torque applied to an<br>
actuator or valve assembly device may be monitored in order to help prevent damage to<br>
an actuator or valve assembly. It is also desirable to provide a mechanism for<br>
indicating when the torque limits of an actuator or valve assembly have been exceeded<br>
by a user.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
Embodiments of the present invention relate to devices that are capable of<br>
indicating the level of torque being applied to an actuator or a valve assembly capable<br>
of being driven by the handwheel. More particularly, embodiments of the invention<br>
include torque indicators capable of recording the amount of torque being applied to an<br>
actuator or a valve assembly by the operation of a handwheel or other device connected<br>
to the actuator or valve assembly. Embodiments of the invention also provide tattletale<br>
torque indicators that record or indicate the largest amount of torque that has been<br>
 <br>
applied to an actuator or valve assembly by a handwheel or other device over a period<br>
of time.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, one or more torque indicator markings<br>
and a pointer are configured with a handwheel device or other device capable of driving<br>
an actuator or valve assembly. The positioning of the pointer relative to the torque<br>
indicator markings may indicate the amount of torque or a range of force being applied<br>
to an actuator or valve assembly by rotation or movement of the handwheel device or<br>
other device driving the actuator or valve assembly.<br>
In other embodiments of the invention, a tattletale torque indicator is configured<br>
with a handwheel device or other device capable of driving an actuator or valve<br>
assembly. The tattletale torque indicator may record or indicate the maximum amount<br>
of torque that has been applied to the actuator or the valve assembly by the handwheel<br>
device or other device over a period of time. The tattletale torque indicator may be<br>
visible to an operator of the handwheel device or other device, or it may be hidden from<br>
view such that disassembly of the handwheel device or other device is required to<br>
determine the maximum amount of torque applied to an actuator or valve assembly.<br>
According to some embodiments, a handwheel device may include a rotation<br>
shaft connected to a handwheel and a drive shaft connected to an actuator or valve<br>
assembly for driving the actuator or valve assembly. One or more force generating<br>
devices (such as, for example, springs) are connected to the drive shaft and rotation<br>
shaft to control the amount of torque applied to the actuator or valve assembly by<br>
movement of the handwheel or other device connected to the rotation shaft. Torque<br>
indicator markings integrated with the lumdwheel device visually indicate the amount<br>
of torque being applied to me actuator or valve assembly in relation to the movement or<br>
rotation of the handwheel or other device connected to the rotation shaft. A tattletale<br>
torque indicator for indicating the maximum amount of torque applied to an actuator or<br>
valve assembly by the handwheel device may also be incorporated with the handwheel<br>
device.<br>
In other embodiments, the rotation shaft of a handwheel device may include<br>
lugs which compress springs or other force generating devices which in turn impart a<br>
force on a drive shaft shell. Movement of me drive shaft shell exerted by the force<br>
generating devices rotates a drive shaft and drives an actuator or valve assembly<br>
connected thereto. Torque indicator markings and tattletale torque indicators according<br>
 <br>
to particular embodiments of the invention may be incorporated with such devices to<br>
indicate the amount of torque being applied to an actuator or valve assembly and to<br>
record the maximum amount of torque applied thereto over a period of time.<br>
In still other embodiments, a handwheel device may include a drive shaft and<br>
flexible spokes connected to a handwheel or other device for rotating a drive shaft.<br>
Rotation of the handwheel flexes the spokes until sufficient torque is applied to the<br>
drive shaft to drive an actuator or valve assembly connected to the drive shaft. Torque<br>
indicator markings may be incorporated with a support connected to the drive shaft and<br>
oriented with respect to a flexible spoke. The flexing of a spoke in relation to the<br>
torque indicator markings provides a visual representation of the amount of torque<br>
being applied to an actuator or valve assembly by movement of the handwheel or other<br>
rotational device. A tattletale torque indicator may also be incorporated with the<br>
handwheel device to indicate the maximum amount of torque applied to an actuator or<br>
valve assembly being driven by the handwheel device.<br>
According to other embodiments of the invention, a handwheel device may<br>
include force generating devices incorporated into a handwheel to exert force on<br>
rotation spokes connected to the handwheel and a drive shaft. The drive shaft may<br>
drive an actuator or a valve assembly connected to the drive shaft. Torque indicator<br>
markings incorporated with the handwheel device visually indicate the amount of<br>
torque or a range of torque being applied to the drive shaft and actuator or valve<br>
assembly by the rotation of the handwheel. A tattletale torque indicator may also be<br>
incorporated with the handwheel device to indicate a maximum torque value applied to<br>
the actuator or valve assembly by the handwheel device over a period of time.<br>
Methods for visually monitoring the amount of torque applied to an actuator or<br>
valve assembly by a handwheel device are also provided. The incorporation of torque<br>
indicator markings with a handwheel device allows monitoring the amount of torque<br>
being applied by the handwheel device to an actuator or valve assembly.<br>
In still other embodiments, methods for monitoring and recording the maximum<br>
amount of torque applied to an actuator or valve assembly are provided by the<br>
incorporation of a tattletale device with a handwheel device. The tattletale device may<br>
be used to monitor or determine the maximum amount of torque applied to an actuator<br>
or valve assembly over time. The tattletale device may be visually locatable or may be<br>
hidden within the handwheel device.<br>

BEST MODE(S) FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Particular embodiments of the invention relate to visual torque indicators that<br>
may be used with a valve assembly or actuator and, more particularly, to devices for<br>
indicating when the amount of torque being applied to a valve assembly or actuator<br>
exceeds the torque limits of the valve assembly or actuator.<br>
According to embodiments of the invention, a visual representation of the<br>
amount of torque being applied to a valve assembly or an actuator by use of a<br>
handwheel may be incorporated with a handwheel assembly or as part of the valve<br>
 <br>
assembly or actuator. As a handwheel assembly is rotated, the corresponding amount<br>
of torque being applied to a valve assembly or actuator by rotation of the handwheel is<br>
visually indicated by a torque indicator. The torque indicator may reflect the amount of<br>
torque being applied to the valve assembly or actuator or a range of torque that is being<br>
applied to the valve assembly or actuator. Thus, the torque indicator according to<br>
embodiments of the invention may visually inform a user whether the torque limits of<br>
the valve assembly or actuator are being, or have been, exceeded.<br>
One particular embodiment of a handwheel device 100 that may be used with<br>
the invention is illustrated in FIG. 2. The handwheel device 100 includes a<br>
handwheel 110 removably fixed to a rotation shaft 120 by one or more bolts 112. The<br>
rotation shaft 120 is located inside a drive shaft 130 and may be rotated therein. A<br>
handwheel cap 150 may be connected to the drive shaft 130 by one or more bolts 152<br>
to secure the rotation shaft 120 within the drive shaft 130. The rotation shaft 120 may<br>
rotate within the drive shaft 130. Additionally, one or more moveable seals or<br>
bearings 122 may be positioned between the rotation shaft 120 and the drive shaft 130<br>
to facilitate rotational movement of the rotation shaft 120 within the drive shaft 130.<br>
The drive shaft 130 may be removably fixed to an actuator or a valve assembly by<br>
bolts 132 to impart movement to the actuator or valve assembly as the drive shaft 130 is<br>
rotated. The handwheel device 100 also includes one or more rotation pegs 140<br>
connected to the rotation shaft 120 and one or more drive pegs 145 connected to the<br>
drive shaft 130.<br>
According to certain embodiments of the invention, the handwheel device 100<br>
may be equipped with a torque indicator to visually indicate the amount of torque being<br>
applied to the drive shaft 130 and to he actuator or valve assembly connected to the<br>
drive shaft 130.<br>
A torque indicator, according; to some embodiments of the invention, is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 3. A handwheel device 100, such as that illustrated in FIG. 2,<br>
includes torque indicator markings 115 on the handwheel 110, a pointer 170 mounted<br>
to the drive shaft 130, and one or more springs 160 having two ends, the springs being<br>
removably connected by a first end to a rotation peg 140 and by a second end to a drive<br>
peg 145. The torque indicator illustrated in FIG. 3 includes two rotation pegs 140A and<br>
140B and two drive pegs 145A and 145B. At least one spring 160 can be connected to<br>
 <br>
the peg(s), with spring(s) 160 being connected between rotation peg(s) 140 and drive<br>
peg(s) 145.<br>
The drive shaft 130 of the handwheel device 100 may be rotated by the<br>
handwheel 110. Movement of the handwheel 110 rotates the rotation shaft 120 which,<br>
in turn, moves the rotation pegs 140 fixed to the rotation shaft 120. Movement of the<br>
rotation pegs 140 impart a force on one or more springs 160 which, in turn, stretch and<br>
impart a force on the drive pegs 145. If the force imparted on the drive pegs 145 is<br>
sufficient to move the drive shaft 130, the drive shaft 130 moves with the rotation of<br>
the handwheel 110. However, if the torque or force required to rotate the drive<br>
shaft 130 is greater than the force being applied to the handwheel 110, then the drive<br>
shaft 130 will not move. The application of additional force to the handwheel 110 will<br>
further stretch the springs 160, imparting a larger force on the drive shaft 130. In this<br>
manner, the handwheel 110 may be rotated until enough force is applied by the<br>
springs 160 to the drive pegs 145 to rotate the drive shaft 130 in the same direction as<br>
the handwheel 110 rotation.<br>
For example, when the handwheel 110 illustrated in FIG. 3 is rotated in a<br>
clockwise direction, rotation pegs 140A and 140B also move in a clockwise direction,<br>
stretching springs 160C and 160A, respectively. The stretching of springs 160A and<br>
160C imparts a force on the drive pegs 145B and 145A, respectively. For instance, as<br>
spring 160 A is stretched by the movemeat of rotation peg 140B, the spring 160 A exerts<br>
a pulling force on drive peg 145B. Similarly, the stretching of spring 160C by rotation<br>
of rotation peg 140A exerts a pulling force on drive peg 145 A. If the forces applied by<br>
spring 160A to drive peg 145B and by spring 160C to drive peg 145A are sufficient to<br>
overcome the force required to rotate drive shaft 130, then the drive shaft 130 will<br>
rotate. However, if the spring 160 forces are not sufficient to overcome the force<br>
required to move the drive shaft 130, then additional rotational force must be applied to<br>
the handwheel 110 before rotation of the drive shaft 130 will occur.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 2, the drive shaft 130 is attached to an actuator or a valve<br>
assembly by bolts 132. Actuators and valve assemblies typically have a maximum ,<br>
torque tolerance. If the torque tolerance is exceeded, damage to the actuator or valve<br>
assembly may occur. Therefore, the amount of torque applied to a drive shaft 130<br>
preferably does not exceed the torque limits of the actuator or valve assembly to which<br>
it is attached. In the previous example, if the drive shaft 130 does not begin to rotate<br>
 <br>
due to rotation of the handwheel 110, an operator may be tempted to continue to apply<br>
additional rotational force to the handwheel 110 which, in turn, applies torque to the<br>
drive shaft 130 and the actuator or valve assembly to which it is attached.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 3, particular embodiments of the invention include torque<br>
indicator markings 115 on the handwheel 110 and a pointer 170 attached to the drive<br>
shaft 130. When used in combination, the torque indicator markings 115 may be<br>
aligned with the pointer 170 to indicate the amount of torque being applied to an<br>
actuator or valve assembly attached to the drive shaft 130. By way of example and not<br>
limitation, the torque indicator markings 115 on handwheel 110 in FIG. 3 include three<br>
regions. A first region 115A may be aligned with the pointer 170 such that the<br>
pointer 170 is positioned in the middle of the first region 115A when no forces are<br>
being applied to the handwheel 100 and drive shaft 130. Two second regions 115B lie<br>
on either side of the first region 115A and are equally steed and spaced. Two third<br>
regions 115C lie on either side of the two second regions 115B and are also equally<br>
sized and spaced. As the handwheel 110 is rotated, the torque indicator markings 115<br>
move with the handwheel 110 and in rektion to the position of the pointer 170. If the<br>
rotational forces applied to the handwheel 110 are insufficient to move the drive<br>
shaft 130, the pointer 170 will remain in its starting position but will point to a different<br>
portion of the torque indicator markings 115, depending upon how much rotation has<br>
been applied to the handwheel 110. Once sufficient force is applied to the<br>
handwheel 110 to rotate the drive shaft 120, the drive shaft 130 will rotate and move<br>
the pointer 170. The movement of the pointer 170 will depend on the movement of the<br>
handwheel 110 and the pointer 170 will indicate the amount of torque that is being<br>
applied to move the drive shaft 130 by its position relative to the torque indicator<br>
markings 115 on the handwheel 110.<br>
According to some embodiments of the invention, the torque indicator<br>
markings 115 may be color coded. For example, the three different torque indicator<br>
marking 115 regions illustrated in FIG. 3 may be color coded to visually indicate when<br>
the torque limits of an actuator or a valve assembly attached to the drive shaft 130 are<br>
being approached or exceeded. The first region 115A may be colored green to indicate<br>
that operation of the handwheel 110 in the first region 115 A is within the bounds of<br>
acceptable torque limits for the actuator or valve assembly connected to the drive<br>
shaft 130. The second regions 115B may be colored yellow to indicate that the torque<br>
 <br>
limits of the actuator or valve assembly attached to the drive shaft 130 are being<br>
approached. The third regions 115C may be colored red to indicate that the torque<br>
limits of the actuator or valve assembly attached to the drive shaft 130 have been or are<br>
being exceeded.<br>
According to other embodiments of the invention, the torque indicator<br>
markings 115 may include other series of markings. For example, markings<br>
representing units or numbers associated with the amount of torque being applied to a<br>
drive shaft 130 may be used as the torque indicator markings 115. Alternatively, other<br>
markings may also be used and embodiments of the invention are not limited by the<br>
type or style of torque indicator mstrkings 115 used.<br>
During operation, the amount of torque being applied to the drive shaft 130 and<br>
to the connected actuator or valve assembly can be monitored when the handwheel 110<br>
is turned. As the handwheel 110 is rotated, the pointer 170 remains in a fixed position<br>
until sufficient torque is applied to the drive pegs 145 by rotation of the handwheel 110,<br>
resulting in movement of the drive shaft 130. The movement of the handwheel 110<br>
aligns the torque indicator markings 115 with the pointer 170. If the drive shaft 130<br>
begins to move while the pointer 170 is still in the first region 115A (i.e., the green<br>
zone), the pointer will remain in the first region 115A until additional force is applied<br>
to move the drive shaft 130. As additional force is applied to move the drive shaft 130,<br>
the pointer may not move in synchronization with the handwheel 110, thus the<br>
pointer 170 may move from the first region 115A into the second region 115B,<br>
indicating that the torque limits of the actuator or valve assembly attached to the drive<br>
shaft 130 are being approached Thus, the operator is able to visually judge whether or<br>
not additional torque should be applied to the actuator or valve assembly by viewing<br>
where the pointer is located in relation to the torque indicator markings 115 on the<br>
handwheel 110.<br>
The torque limits of the actuator or valve assembly to which the drive shaft 130<br>
is attached are typically known. According to particular embodiments of the invention,<br>
the ranges of torque being applied to the drive shaft 130 by rotation of the<br>
handwheel 110 may be adjusted by changing the springs 160 attached to the rotation<br>
pegs 140 and drive pegs 145. If a larger amount of torque is required to move an<br>
actuator or valve assembly, stronger springs 160 may be used with embodiments of the<br>
invention. If a smaller amount of torque is required to move an actuator or valve<br>
 <br>
assembly, smaller springs 160 may be used. The springs 160 used with embodiments<br>
of the invention may be selected bailed upon the operational torque ranges that may be<br>
applied to an actuator or valve assembly and the size of the regions of the torque<br>
indicator markings 115 on the handwheel 110. For example, knowing the operational<br>
torque limits of an actuator attached to the drive shaft 130, a spring 160 or set of<br>
springs 160 may be selected such that the springs 160 will move the drive shaft 130<br>
while the torque indicator markings 115 of the first region 115 A correspond to the<br>
pointer 170 position on the drive shaft 130. The springs 160 may also be selected such<br>
that, as the torque limits of the actuator are being approached, the amount of rotation of<br>
the handwheel 110 required to move the drive shaft 130 will correspond to movement<br>
of the pointer 170 into the second region 115B of the torque indicator markings 115.<br>
Similarly, the springs 160 may be selected such that, when the torque limits are<br>
exceeded, the pointer 170 will correspond to the third region 115C of the torque<br>
indicator markings 115.<br>
Some embodiments of the invsntion, such as those illustrated in FIG. 3, may be<br>
used to warn an operator of a handwheel device 100 when the torque limits of an<br>
actuator or valve assembly connected to the handwheel device 100 are being<br>
approached or are being exceeded. By visually inspecting the position of a pointer 170<br>
relative to a torque indicator marking 115 on the handwheel 110, the amount of torque<br>
relative to the torque limits of an actuator or valve assembly may be determined and<br>
decisions regarding the operation of the handwheel device 100 with respect to the<br>
actuator or valve assembly may be mace.<br>
According to some embodiments of the invention, the number of springs 160<br>
used with a handwheel device 100 may vary. As illustrated in FIG. 3, four springs 160<br>
could be used. As illustrated in FIG. 4, two springs may be used and may be<br>
configured such that each spring 160 is connected to the same drive peg 145B and<br>
respectively connected to opposite rotation pegs 140. In other embodiments, two<br>
springs may be used and may be set opposite of each other (not shown) such that a first<br>
spring 160 is connected to a first drive psg 145 A and a first rotation peg 140A and a<br>
second spring 160 is connected to a second drive peg 145B and a second rotation<br>
peg 140B. Use of one spring 160 or Aires springs 160 may also be adopted with<br>
embodiments of the invention. In still other embodiments, multiple springs 160 may be<br>
connected in series, in parallel, or both, to the drive pegs 145 and rotation pegs 140 to<br>
 <br>
create sufficient rotational force necessary for operation of the handwheel device 100<br>
with an actuator or a valve assembly.<br>
Springs 160 may also be replaced by, or used in combination with, other<br>
devices capable of imparting similar forces to those of the springs 160 when the<br>
handwheel device 100 is operated. For instance, cords made of stretchable materials<br>
such as rubber, fabric or the like may be used with the present invention. As an<br>
example, a series or group of elastic or bungee-type cords may be substituted for a<br>
spring 160 and attached to the drive pegs 145 and rotation pegs 140 to impart the<br>
equivalent forces created by a spring 160. Any other known materials and devices<br>
suitable to create such forces could also be used.<br>
In additional embodiments, springs 160 or other devices capable of imparting<br>
forces used with embodiments of the invention may be connected to a drive shaft 130<br>
and rotation shaft 120 by any suitable devices or methods (other than by drive pegs 145<br>
and rotation pegs 140) capable of being connecting or holding springs 160 or other<br>
equivalent devices.<br>
According to other embodiments of the invention, the torque indicator<br>
markings 115 may be applied to the drive shaft 130 of the handwheel device 100 and<br>
the pointer 170 may be attached to the handwheel 110 (not shown). In such<br>
embodiments, the pointer 170 moves relative to the drive shaft 130 as the<br>
handwheel 110 is rotated, thereby indicating the range of torque being applied to the<br>
drive shaft 130 and to an actuator or valve assembly connected to the drive shaft 130.<br>
As the drive shaft 130 begins to move, the pointer 170 will maintain alignment with the<br>
portion of the torque indicator markings 115 on the drive shaft 130, thus indicating<br>
whether the amount of torque being applied by rotation of the handwheel 110 is within<br>
an acceptable range for the actuator or valve assembly connected to the drive shaft 130.<br>
According to other embodiments of the invention, the torque indicator<br>
markings 115 may be integrated with the rotation shaft 120 and the pointer 170<br>
integrated with the drive shaft 130. In still other embodiments, the torque indicator<br>
markings 115 may be integrated with the drive shaft 130 and the pointer 170 integrated<br>
with the rotation shaft 120.<br>
According to other embodiments of the invention, a "tattletale" device may be<br>
used alone or in combination with the torque indicating device. The tattletale device is<br>
capable of indicating whether the torque limits of the actuator or valve assembly<br>
 <br>
attached to the handwheel device 100 have been exceeded by rotation of the<br>
handwheel 110. Any number of tattletale devices may be incorporated with various<br>
embodiments of the invention. Thus, the embodiments described herein are merely<br>
representative and are not intended to be limiting.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, a pointer 170 may make contact with<br>
the torque indicator markings 115. As be pointer 170 moves along the area of the<br>
torque indicator markings 115, the pointer 170 may leave a mark indicating the<br>
maximum deflection of the pointer 170 with respect to the torque indicator<br>
markings 115. The mark may be a permanent mark, such as by scoring the torque<br>
indicator markings 115 or otherwise marking them so that visual inspection of the<br>
torque indicator markings 115 reveals the maximum amount of torque, or a maximum<br>
range of torque, applied to an actuator or valve assembly attached to a drive shaft 130<br>
of a handwheel device 100.<br>
In other embodiments, the pointer 170 may move a hidden tattletale<br>
incorporated with the torque indicator markings 115. For example, torque indicator<br>
markings 115 placed on a handwheel 110 or on a drive shaft 130 may include a device<br>
having an interior cavity wherein one or more moveable markers may be placed for<br>
movement within the cavity. The markers may be oriented, upon assembly and<br>
placement of the torque indicator markings 115 on the handwheel device 100, such that<br>
the markers are in line with a zero torque position, or within the normal operational<br>
torque zone. Movement of a pointer 170 with respect to the markers may move the<br>
markers in one direction within the cavity such mat the markers record the maximum<br>
deflection of the pointer 170 along the torque indicator markings 115. For instance,<br>
one or both of the markers and pointer 170 may be magnetized such that movement of<br>
the pointer 170 imparts a corresponding movement to a marker. Therefore, to<br>
determine if the maximum torque limits of the actuator or valve assembly connected to<br>
the handwheel device 100 had been exceeded, the torque indicator marking 115 device<br>
could be disassembled to determine the position of the markers in the cavity.<br>
In still other embodiments of the invention, movement of the pointer 170 along<br>
the torque indicator markings 115 would push one or more pins or secondary pointers<br>
attached to the torque indicator markings 115 which would mark the maximum torque<br>
position reached along the torque indicator markings 115. Inspection of the pin or pins<br>
would reveal the maximum torque range reached for the device during operation.<br>
 <br>
In other embodiments of the invention, the tattletale device may be hidden such<br>
that the maximum deflection, as recorded by the tattletale device, may only be<br>
determined by disassembling the handwheel device 100. For example, a tattletale<br>
device may be placed on the interior of the handwheel device 100. One or more<br>
moveable pins positioned within an interior space of the handwheel device 100 may be<br>
associated with torque indicator markings 115 and may be moved by the movement of<br>
the pointer 170. As the pointer is defiacted over the torque indicator markings 115, one<br>
or more moveable pins could be moved to reflect the maximum torque exerted on the<br>
handwheel device 100.<br>
According to other embodiments of the invention, the tattletale device may<br>
include a crushable material that would be permanently deformed as greater pointer 170<br>
deflections occurred along the torque indicator markings 115. The position of the<br>
deformed, crushable material in relation to the torque indicator markings 115 reflect the<br>
maximum amount of torque applied to the drive shaft 130 by the handwheel<br>
device 100.<br>
The use of tattletale devices with embodiments of the present invention allow<br>
an operator of a handwheel device 100 to visually determine when the torque limits of<br>
an actuator or valve assembly have been exceeded, which would indicate whether<br>
maintenance or replacement of the equipment is needed. Additionally, the use of<br>
tattletales, and especially hidden tattletales, may allow manufactures to determine when<br>
the torque limits of a damaged actuator had been exceeded so that the manufacturer<br>
could avoid warranty and other liabilities.<br>
Other representative embodiments of the invention are illustrated in FIGS. 5<br>
and 6. As illustrated in FIG. 5, the drive shaft 230 includes a drive shaft shell 235<br>
connected to the drive shaft 230 and it group of compression springs 260 in<br>
communication with the drive shaft shell 235. The compression springs 260 are also in<br>
communication with lugs 242, which are in turn connected to the rotation shaft 220. A<br>
handwheel 210 is connected to the rotation shaft 220 and may be used to rotate the<br>
rotation shaft 220 in the direction that the handwheel 210 is turned, as with other<br>
embodiments of the invention. Rotation of the shaft 220 moves the lugs 242, resulting<br>
in compression of one or more springs 260 and application of pressure to the drive shaft<br>
shell 235. When the force exerted on. the compression springs 260 by rotation of the<br>
handwheel 210 is sufficient to overcome the torque required to move the drive<br>
 <br>
shaft 230, the compression springs 260 cause movement of the drive shaft shell 235 and<br>
the drive shaft 230 connected thereto Movement of the drive shaft 230 translates to<br>
movement of an actuator or valve assembly connected to the drive shaft 230 (not<br>
shown).<br>
Similar to other embodiments of the invention, the handwheel device 200<br>
illustrated in FIG. 5 includes torque indicator markings 215 and a pointer 270. The<br>
torque indicator markings 215 include a first region 215A, two second regions 215B on<br>
either side of the first region 215A, and two third regions 215C on either side of the<br>
second regions 215B. The torque indicator markings 215 illustrated in FIG. 5 are<br>
attached to or associated with the drive shaft 230. It is understood that the torque<br>
indicator markings 215 may also be associated with the handwheel 210, the drive shaft<br>
shell 235, or the rotation shaft 220, as previously described with reference to other<br>
embodiments of the invention. Similarly, it is understood that the pointer 270 may be<br>
associated with the rotation shaft 220, the drive shaft 230, the drive shaft shell 235, or<br>
the handwheel 210 of the handwheel device 200. As illustrated, the pointer 270 is<br>
connected to a lug 242 or to the rotation shaft 220.<br>
When the handwheel 210 of the handwheel device 200 illustrated in FIG. 5 is<br>
rotated, the pointer 270 moves with the rotation shaft 220 and with respect to the torque<br>
indicator markings 215, indicating the amount of torque being applied to the drive<br>
shaft 230 by the compression springs 260. When sufficient torque is applied to the<br>
drive shaft shell 235, the drive shaft shell 235 moves the drive shaft 230, which in turn,<br>
moves the torque indicator markings 215. The position of the pointer 270 in relation to<br>
the torque indicator markings 215 during rotation visually represents the amount of<br>
torque being applied to the drive shaft 230 and the actuator or valve assembly<br>
connected to the drive shaft 230.<br>
The drive shaft shell 235 may include other configurations. For example, the<br>
handwheel device 200 illustrated in FIG. 6 can include a drive shaft shell 235 having a<br>
different configuration man the drive shaft shell 235 of FIG. 5. According to<br>
alternative embodiments of the invention, the drive shaft shells 235 may be configured<br>
to accommodate the positioning of compression springs 260 within the drive shaft<br>
shell 235 such that lugs 242 apply forces to the compression springs 260 and to the<br>
drive shaft shell 235.<br>
 <br>
According to particular embodiments of the invention, any number of<br>
compression springs 260 may be used with the different configurations of handwheel<br>
devices 200. For example, four compression springs 260 are shown in FIG. 5 and two<br>
compression springs 260 are shown in FIG. 6. Although not illustrated, one or three<br>
compression springs 260 could also be used with other embodiments of the invention<br>
and the drive shaft shells 233 could be configured appropriately. In still other<br>
embodiments, multiple compression springs 260 could be combined in series, in<br>
parallel, or in both series and parallel arrangement to provide the necessary resistance<br>
or forces required to rotate the drive shaft 230 of a handwheel device 200. In addition,<br>
other types of springs, such as Belleville springs, could be used in place of the<br>
compression springs 260. Also, other materials, such as stretchable materials and<br>
bungee-cord type materials, could be used in place of, or in combination with, the<br>
compression springs with the various embodiments of the present invention.<br>
In still other embodiments of the invention, a tattletale device may be included<br>
with the handwheel devices 200 illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6. The tattletale device may<br>
include a visual indication of the maximum torque reached during use of the handwheel<br>
device 200, such as, for example, by a movable pin that indicates the maximum torque<br>
position or contact between the pointer 270 and the torque indicator markings 215,<br>
which leaves a visual mark on the torque indicator markings 215. Hidden tattletale<br>
devices may also be used with embodiments of the invention, where the hidden<br>
tattletale devices are enclosed in the handwheel device 200 such that inspection of the<br>
maximum torque indicating tattletale may only be performed by disassembling the<br>
handwheel device 200. The tattletale devices that may be used with embodiments of<br>
the invention, such as those illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6, are not limited and may<br>
include any tattletale device that can be used with other embodiments of the invention.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates additional embodiments of the invention. As illustrated, a<br>
handwheel device 700 may include a handwheel 710, flexible spokes 720, a drive<br>
shaft 730, and torque indicator markings 715 mounted to a torque indicator<br>
support 717. One or more flexible spokes 720 are connected on a first end to the<br>
handwheel 710 and on a second end to the drive shaft 730. Rotation of the<br>
handwheel 710 translates force through the flexible spokes 720 to the drive shaft 730,<br>
which in turn rotates the drive shaft 730. The drive shaft 730 may be attached to an<br>
actuator or a valve assembly. A torque indicator support 717 may be connected to the<br>
 <br>
drive shaft 730 and may span one or more of the flexible spokes 720. The torque<br>
indicator support 717 supports torque indicator markings 715 which may be used to<br>
determine when the amount of torque being applied to the handwheel 710 exceeds the<br>
torque limits of an actuator or valve assembly connected to the drive shaft 730.<br>
As illustrated in the embodiment of FIG. 7, the torque indicator markings 715<br>
may include three different regions: a iirst region 715A, two second regions 715B on<br>
either side of the first region 715A, and two third regions 715C on either side of the two<br>
second regions 715B. The torque indicator markings 715 may be color coded to<br>
indicate the different regions or ranges of torque being applied to a drive shaft 730 by<br>
rotation of a handwheel 710. According to other embodiments of the invention, the<br>
torque indicator markings 715 may include one or more markings capable of indicating<br>
differing amounts of torque that are being applied to an actuator or valve assembly<br>
attached to a drive shaft 730.<br>
Other markings or marking combinations may be used as torque indicator<br>
markings 715 according to other embodiments of the invention.<br>
The flexible spokes 720 may be disposed or placed in a relaxed position 720A<br>
when no rotational forces are applied to the handwheel 710, as illustrated in FIG. 7.<br>
However, when the handwheel 710 is rotated, the applied forces cause the flexible<br>
spokes 720 to bend into a flexed position 720B. When the rotational force placed on<br>
the flexible spokes 720 by the handwheel 710 is released, the flexible spokes 720 return<br>
to the relaxed position 720A.<br>
The amount of torque being applied to the drive shaft 730, and to an actuator or<br>
valve assembly connected to the drive shaft 730, may be determined by the position of<br>
a flexible spoke 720 in the flexed position 720B caused by a rotation of the<br>
handwheel 710. As illustrated in FIG. 7, when a rotational force is applied to the<br>
handwheel 710, the flexible spokes 720 bend into a flexed position 720B. The torque<br>
indicator support 717, however, moves with the drive shaft 730. Therefore, until the<br>
drive shaft 730 begins to move, the torque indicator support 717 remains in position<br>
and the amount of torque being applied to the drive shaft 730 may be determined by<br>
looking at the position of the flexed spoke 720B in relation to the torque indicator<br>
markings 715 held by the torque indicator support 717. When the drive shaft 730<br>
moves, the torque indicator markings 715 and the torque indicator support 717 also<br>
move, and the amount of torque being applied to the drive shaft 730 and an actuator or<br>
 <br>
valve assembly attached thereto can be determined by the position of the flexed<br>
spoke 720B in reference to the torque indicator markings 715.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, the handwheel device 700 illustrated in<br>
FIG. 7 may also include a tattletale device (not shown). The tattletale device may<br>
record the maximum amount of torque applied to the drive shaft 730 and the actuator or<br>
valve assembly attached thereto. For example, the flexible spokes 720 may contact the<br>
torque indicator markings 715 such that the flexible spokes 720 leave a mark on the<br>
torque indicator markings 715 corresponding to the maximum amount of torque applied<br>
to the handwheel device 700. In other embodiments, the movement of the flexible<br>
spokes 720 may move a pin or other marker associated with the torque indicator<br>
markings 715 such that the maximum applied torque may be visually indicated on the<br>
torque indicator markings 715. Tattletale devices used with and according to other<br>
embodiments of the invention may also be used with the handwheel device 700<br>
illustrated in FIG. 7.<br>
According to yet another embodiment of the invention, a handwheel device 800<br>
may include a handwheel 810, a drive shaft 830, and one or more drive spokes 820<br>
connecting the handwheel 810 to the drive shaft 830, as illustrated in FIG. 8. The drive<br>
shaft 830 may be connected to an actuator or a valve assembly. The handwheel 810,<br>
may further include a handwheel rim 812 and a handwheel cover 880 wrapped around<br>
one or more portions of the handwheel rim 812. Springs 860 can be mounted around<br>
the handwheel rim 812 next to one or more of the drive spokes 820. As illustrated in<br>
FIG. 8, springs 860 may be mounted on the handwheel rim 812 on either side of each<br>
of the drive spokes 820. Springs 860 may include compression springs, Belleville<br>
springs, or any other suitable devices capable of providing a force necessary to operate<br>
embodiments of the invention. A slotted handwheel cover 880 may fit over the<br>
handwheel rim 812 and contact the springs 860 at a spring drive position 885.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, the spring drive position 885 portion of<br>
the handwheel cover 880 can include a cross-sectional opening, allowing passage of the<br>
handwheel rim 812 but preventing passage of the springs 860. FIG. 9 illustrates a<br>
cross-sectional view of the handwheel rim 812 and handwheel cover 880 at one of the<br>
spring drive positions 885 of the handwheel 810. As illustrated, the handwheel rim 812<br>
is encompassed by the handwheel cover 880 and the handwheel cover 880 includes a<br>
width 816 at the spring drive position 885. The width 816 of the handwheel cover 880<br>
 <br>
at the spring drive position 885 can be adapted to prevent movement of a spring 860<br>
with the handwheel rim 812. In other words, the width 816 portion of the handwheel<br>
cover 880 can be adapted to apply a force to a spring 860 mounted to the handwheel<br>
rim 812.<br>
In some embodiments, the handwheel rim 812 can be configured such mat it<br>
passes through the one or more drive spokes 820 and is moveable through the drive<br>
spokes 820. In such embodiments, the handwheel cover 880 is fixed to the handwheel<br>
rim 812 such that movement of the handwheel cover 880 translates into similar<br>
movement of the handwheel rim 812. Therefore, rotation of the handwheel cover 880<br>
translates into rotation of the handwheel rim 812. As the handwheel cover 880 is<br>
rotated, the handwheel rim 812 moves and the spring drive positions 885 of the<br>
handwheel cover 880 apply a force to one or more of the springs 860, which in turn<br>
apply a force to one or more of the drive spokes 820. If the force applied by one or<br>
more springs 860 to the drive spokes 820 is sufficient to rotate the drive shaft 830, the<br>
drive spokes 820 will move and cause a rotation of the drive shaft 830.<br>
In other particular embodiments of the invention, the handwheel rim 812 can be<br>
connected to the one or more drive spokes 820. In such embodiments, the handwheel<br>
cover 880 is moveable around the handwheel rim 812, whereby movement of the<br>
handwheel cover 880 does not necessarily translate to movement of the handwheel<br>
rim 812. For example, the handwheel cover 880 may slide over the handwheel rim 812<br>
when grasped and moved. Movement of the handwheel cover 880, however, applies<br>
forces to one or more of the springs 860 in contact with the spring drive positions 885<br>
of the handwheel cover 880. If the ibrces applied to one or more of the springs 860 are<br>
sufficient to overcome the torque necessary to move the drive shaft 830, the drive<br>
spokes 820 and the handwheel rim 812 will move as a result of the movement of the<br>
handwheel cover 880.<br>
According to other embodiments of the invention, the amount of torque being<br>
applied by the handwheel 810 to the: drive shaft 830 may be monitored using torque<br>
indicator markings 815. For example, in some embodiments of the invention, torque<br>
indicator markings 815 may be printed on the handwheel cover 880, as illustrated in<br>
FIG. 8. A pointer 870 may be mounted to the drive shaft 830 such that when no forces<br>
are being applied to the handwheel 810, the pointer 870 is located in a center portion of<br>
the torque indicator markings 815. As the handwheel cover 880 is rotated, the torque<br>
 <br>
indicator markings 815 move relative 1o the pointer 870, thereby registering the amount<br>
of torque being applied to the drive shaft 830. When sufficient torque has been created<br>
to move the drive shaft 830, the pointer 870 can move with the drive shaft 830 and the<br>
handwheel cover 880, thus registering the amount of torque being applied to the drive<br>
shaft 830.<br>
In other embodiments of the invention, torque indicator markings 815 may be<br>
located on a portion of the handwheel cover 880 overlying the springs 860 (not shown).<br>
The torque indicator markings 815 may include any type of marking desired. For<br>
example, instead of a pointer 870, one or more of the drive spokes 820 of the<br>
handwheel device 800 can be used with the torque indicator markings 815 to determine<br>
the amount of torque being applied to the drive shaft 830 and an actuator or valve<br>
assembly connecter thereto. The torque indicator markings 815 located on a portion of<br>
the handwheel cover 880 covering the springs 860 about a drive spoke 820 will move<br>
in conjunction with the handwheel cover 880. As the handwheel cover 880 is moved,<br>
the relative position of the torque indicator markings 815 on the handwheel cover 880<br>
change with respect to the drive spoke 820 over which they were originally positioned.<br>
Based upon the relative change in position, the amount of torque being applied to the<br>
drive shaft 830 may be determined. In this manner, an operator may visually register<br>
whether the torque limits of the drive shaft 830 and the actuator or valve assembly<br>
connected thereto are being approached or exceeded.<br>
Tattletale devices may also be incorporated with embodiments of the invention<br>
illustrated in FIG. 8 or with other similar configurations. For example, a tattletale<br>
device such as a crushable material may be placed inside of the handwheel cover 880<br>
next to a spring 860. As the handwheel 810 is moved and torque is applied, the<br>
crushable material may be permanently deformed. Examination of the extent to which<br>
the crushable material is deformed may indicate the amount of force that was applied to<br>
the material such that it can be determined whether the torque limits of the drive<br>
shaft 830 were exceeded. Other tattletale devices, such as those described with respect<br>
to other embodiments of the invention, may also be employed.<br>
According to still other embodiments of the invention, the springs or other<br>
force-generating devices used with embodiments of the present invention may be<br>
configured such that two or more torque limits may be visually monitored using torque<br>
indicator markings according to the present invention. For example, embodiments of<br>
 <br>
the invention illustrated in FIG. 3 may include four springs 160. As the handwheel 310<br>
is rotated in a clockwise direction, springs 160A and springs 160C can be stretched<br>
between the rotation pegs 140 and the drive pegs 145. The amount of torque being<br>
applied is therefore dependent upon the strength of springs 160A and 160C, and not on<br>
springs 160B and 160D, which do not drive the drive shaft 130 when the<br>
handwheel 110 is moved in a clockwise direction. Springs 160B and 160D do,<br>
however, drive the drive shaft 130 when the handwheel 110 is moved in a counter-<br>
clockwise direction Therefore, the forces required to move the drive shaft 130 using<br>
the handwheel 110 may be controlled by selecting the desired strength of opposing<br>
springs. If the amount of force requirecl to move a handwheel 110 in a clockwise<br>
direction is greater than mat required to move it in a counterclockwise direction,<br>
springs or other force-generating devices of different strengths can be selected. In such<br>
