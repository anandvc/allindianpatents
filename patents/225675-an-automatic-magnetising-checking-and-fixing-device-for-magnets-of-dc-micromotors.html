				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an automated magnetising, checking and fixing device for DC micromotor which performs the functions of magnetising, checking magnetised ring for its BH curve, inserting into inner casing of the motor and fixing the magnet into the casing only when it is perfectly magnetised and rejecting it if it is not properly magnetised.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The magnets used in DC micromotors are magnetized in magnetising jigs. The magnets are then checked 100% manually for flux. The accepted and rejected magnets are manually segregated. Location of magnetic poles is marked manually on the accepted magnets which are then loaded one by one into the inner casing, are aligned and assembled into it by using a press.<br>
100% manual inspection of the magnets for flux is very time consuming and needs dedicated manpower. Assembly of accepted magnet into the casing is also labour intensive. There is every possibility of sub standard magnets getting assembled into motor housing due to known phenomenon of'inspection fatigue' associated with 100% inspection. This results in rejection of finished DC micromotors.<br><br>
QBJECTS OF PRESENT INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an automated magnetising and checking device for DC micromotor<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an automated magnetising device which performs functions of magnetising, the magnet ring, checking magnetised magnet ring for its BH curve before inserting it into inner casing of the motor when it is perfectly magnetised and rejecting it when it is not properly magnetised<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide an automated magnetising, checking and fixing device for production of DC micromotor which gives maintenance free service over a long period of time<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide an automated magnetising, checking and fixing device for DC micrometer which has higher productivity of magnetising, inspection and fitment taking only 2 seconds to perform complete sequence of operations.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide an automated magnetising, checking and fixing device which enables throughput of the order of 1800 Nos/hour magnets as compared to 550 Nos/hour in manual magnetising, checking, sorting and fixing using 3 persons.<br>
Even further object of the present invention is to provide an automated magnetising, checking and fixing device which has an accuracy of ±5 maxwell as compared to the accuracy of ±10 maxwell achievable in manual operation, which is not desirable due to high rejection of DC micromotors on production line as well as after sales.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide a fully automated device which does not require any dedicated lull time manpower resource to operate.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide an automated device which enables to reduce the rejection rate from 2-4% in manual operation to only 0.1% with the present device.<br>
Even further object of the present invention is to provide an automated magnetising, checking and fixing device which has low cost of operation.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide an automated magnetising, checking and fixing device which is highly reliable which enables 100% inspection of magnets i.e no magnet remains uninspected and no defective magnet gets passed and fitted<br>
DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING FIGURES<br>
The device of the present invention is illustrated with accompanying figure (fig l)which illustrates an embodiment of the present invention. It is to be understood that the features and concepts of the invention can be adapted to various embodiments by making changes, adaptations, modifications by those skilled in the art. Such variant embodiments are intended to be within the scope of the present invention. The accompanying figure (Fig. 1) illustrates the overall block diagram of the device.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention, there is provided an automated magnetising, checking and fixing device for magnets of DC micromotors comprising magnetising jigs, magnetic flux checking device, assembly jigs, characterised in that: the said device comprises two indexed discs (D1 and D2) rotatably mounted and indexable by separate stepper motors, two vibratory hoppers (8,1) each connected to a chute (9, 2), magnet<br>
loadingjig (10), inner casing loading jig (3), a plurality of magnetising jigs (11, 12, 13), a magnetic flux checking unit (14), a rejected magnets sorter (17), inner casing radial positioning jig (4), fitting jig (5, 6) for fixing the accepted magnets into inner casings, ejector (7) for ejection of completed inner casings, rejected magnets and chutes for completed inner casings and rejected magnets (15); the said indexed discs (D1, D2) provided with a plurality of stations (S1 to S18), the said discs being mechanically coupled with stepper motor for alignment of said stations with the said magnetising jig; programmable timer being provided for controlling the time of indexing operations<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO DRAWINGS<br>
Referring to fig 1, the device uses two indexing discs (D1, D2). The magnetising disc (D1) handles motor magnets and fixing disc (D2), handles outer casings The magnetising disc gets loaded with a unmagnetised ring one by one from a vibrating hopper (8) and a chute (9) The said rings undergo magnetisation in one out of three magnetising jigs sequentially. These magnetising jigs (11, 12 13) with their own independent charging units magnetise the magnets in a cyclic order at an interval of about 2 seconds thereby creating a time gap of 6 seconds for each charging unit to allow cooling After magnetisation is carried out, the magnets are checked for flux by the Magnetic Flux Checking Unit (14). The flux value of each magnet is recorded and this recorded value is utilised for automated 'Go' or No Go' decision for insertion into a casing or for rejection The accepted magnets are pressed into inner casing by fixing<br>
Jig (5) and the rejected castings are pressed down into chute (15) by rejected magnet sorter jig (17). In the present embodiment the magnetising disc has 12 stations (S1 to 812) for performing various functions<br>
The inner casings are loaded into a vibratory hopper (1), get arranged in a moving tine in a chute (2) and are fed one by one into a casing holder on the fixing disc (D2) by inner casing loading jig (3). A motorised jig (4) aligns the casing with respect to the polar axis of the magnet. The magnet is then half pressed into the casing using fixing jig (5), then full pressed using fixing jig (6) and completed casings are ejected by the ejector (7) The complete casing.s go to a bin through chute (16), The fixing disc of the present embodiment has 6 stations (813 to Sis) for performing various operations.<br>
The device is provided with programmable timers for controlling the time of indexing discs To facilitate automation a plurality pneumatic cylinders (Pi to PIO) are provided which are controlled for operation timings and sequence by timer.<br>
The device has a plurality of power supplies for supplying the electric power to timer, stepper motor, vibratory hopper, chutes, pneumatic cylinders, magnetising jigs, checking unit and various jig<br>
The device concurrently performs various operations such as segregation, cleaning, magnetising, flux checking, casing alignment, transfer, pressing, rejection of defectives and enables a cycle time of as low as 2 seconds. <br><br><br><br><br>
