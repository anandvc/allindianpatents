The invention relates to a controlled release pharmaceutical composition containing nimesulide. The composition is useful for the treatment of inflammatory conditions and to remove all kinds of pains. The composition is particularly useful for removing pains associated with osteoarthritis and traumatic injury. The composition is therapeutically effective for a period of 18.0 to 24.0 hours there by reducing the dose of the drug, which consequently improves the patient compliance. The composition of the present invention is either in the form of a tablet or coated pellets filled in capsule releasing the active ingredient as initial dose and maintenance dose in vitro at a specified rate.<br>
Nimesulide has the chemical formula given below.<br>
C13H12N2O5S<br>
Formula 1<br>
Nimesulide is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that also has<br>
antipyretic and analgesic properties. It is administered orally or rectally at a<br>
dose of 100 and 200mg twice daily, respectively, for a variety of<br>
inflammatory disorders as well as for removing pains. In children, nimesulide<br>
dose is commonly 5mg/kg/day divided into 2 or 3 daily doses administered in<br>
the form of suspension, granules or suppositories. This compound is effective<br>
in reducing pains associated with osteroarthritis, cancer, thrombophlebitis,<br>
oral and general surgery, dysmenorrhoea in adults and pain, fever and<br>
inflammation	accompanying	respiratory	tract	infections,<br>
otorhinolaryngological diseases and traumatic injury in adults and children. Nimesulide appeared to be at least as effective as other non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in all of the above said indications. Nimesulide has been well tolerated by adults, elderly and pediatric patients. It has a pharmacodynamic profile suggestive of a reduced propensity to cause adverse gastrointestinal effects associated with NSAIDs.<br>
Though the compound is weakly acidic (pKa 6.5) and differs from other NSAIDs in that chemical structure contains a sulfonanilide moeity as the acidic group (Davis,R. and Brogden, R. N., Drugs, 48(3): 431, 1994). The mechanism of action of nimesulide appears to differ from that of most conventional NSAIDs. Nimesulide selectively inhibits the formation of proinflammatory prostagladins with less effect on those prostagladins that have gastroprotective action. As a consequence, nimesulide is better tolerated by the gastrointestinal tract than most other NSAIDs, while exerting equivalent efficacy. It exhibits a neuroprotective effect against Î²- amyloid induced cell<br><br>
death.	Nimesulide     inhibits     non-inflammatory     mechanisms     of<br>
neurodegeneration. The COX-2 inhibition may have potential as an additional therapeutic agent in human inflammatory neuropathis. The other mechanism of action of nimesulide including free radical scavenging, inhibition of histamine release and activity, inhibition of proteases (Ex.: elastage, collagenase). potent inhibition of induced platelet aggregation (Tognella, S., Drugs, 46(suppl 1): 275,1993).<br>
Recently, Nakatsugi et.al, ( through Chem. Absts, 130(12):148406k,1999) reported that repeated administration of nimesulide to Min. mice in their diet significantly decreased the size of the polyps in intestine. These authors claims that nimesulide is a good candidate as a colon cancer chemo-preventive agent with low toxicity.<br>
Nimesulide is practically insoluble in water and freely soluble in O.IN NaOH and phosphate buffer pH 8.0 with surfactant. The solubility of nimesulide can be improved by making complexes with P-cyclodextrins (Piel et al, J. Pharm. Sci,, 86,475,1997). However making complexation employing p-cyclodextrins is costlier and use of methylene chloride may cause toxic effects.<br>
Dischiena and Ginseppe (Eur Pat. Appl 880, 965, 1998) disclosed a topical pharmaceutical formulation containing nimesulide and an excipient consisting of an acrylic polymer or copolymer dispersed in oil and water with an emilsifier do not strain yellow skin.<br>
Bertacchi et al., (Acta Toxicol. Ther.,18(l), 33, 1997) reported that a 3% nimesulide cream would possesses a good analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity and well local tolerability without side effects.<br>
Girola et al, (Acta Toxicol Ther.,18(l), 17, 1997) suggested that 3% nimesulide cream showed statistically significant activity, in acute goute injury, than 1% diclofenac gel.<br>
Wober et al.,(Int. J. Clin. Pract. 52(3), 169,1998) observed that nimesulide exhibited high therapeutic equivalence and tolerance when compared to diclofenac in acute subdeltoid bursitis and bicipital tendinitis.<br>
After oral administration of pure nimesulide 50.0 to 200.0mg to healthy adult volunteers, peak serum concentration of 1.98 to 9.85mg/L are achieved within 1.2 to 3.17 hours. Oral drug absorption is nearly complete and concomitant administration of food may decrease the rate but not the extent of absorption of nimesulide. The elimination half-life of nimesulide ranges from 1.56 to<br><br>
4.9 hors. The short biological half-life of nimesulide necessitates frequent administration.<br>
Till today there is no composition containing nimesulide which releases the drug in a controlled manner thereby not only reducing the amount of the drug to be administered but also enhancing the effectiveness of the drug. Considering the good tolerance of the drug by all the categories of patients namely adults, elderly persons and infants it was observed that development of controlled release pharmaceutical composition containing nimesulide may be very useful for the treatment of inflammatory conditions as well as for removing various kinds of pains.<br>
The sustained release of the drug from its dosage form can be obtained by different ways. One method utilises the embedding of the drug into a matrix of other excipients that are relatively water insoluble and hence dissolve and release the embedded drug slowly at a controlled rate into the digestive tract. The other approach is to shape the drug and excipients into granules or pellets as an active core and then these are coated with substances possessing film forming characteristics and low solubility profile.<br>
The major draw back associated with many of these technologies for controlled release of water insoluble drugs is the variations in their drug release profile from batch to batch and also from manufacturer to manufacturer. These variations in release profile may also due to changes in particle size and crystalline nature of the drug. Further, formulating a water insoluble drug into sustained release pharmaceutical dosage form is that not all the drug made available to the biological system during its transport though the digestive tract. However the above drawbacks can be over come by solid dispersion technique.<br>
Accordingly the main objective of the present invention is to provide a novel controlled release pharmaceutical composition containing nimesulide which is useful for the treatment of inflammatory conditions as well as for removing all kinds of pains.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a novel controlled release pharmaceutical composition containing nimesulide, which is effective for a longer period of time as well, requires only small doses.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a novel controlled release pharmaceutical composition containing nimesulide where the release profile of the drug is uniform.<br><br>
It is still another objective of the present invention to provide a novel pharmaceutical composition which is therapeutically effective over an extended period of at least 18.0 to 24.0 hours by providing sufficient amount of the drug immediately, i.e. within 0,5 to 1.0 hour to provide an initial therapeutically effective serum concentration, and to releasing the remaining amount of the drug at a rate sufficient to maintain the drug concentration in therapeutically effective range over a desired period of time.<br>
It is another objective of the present invention to provide an oral controlled release pharmaceutical composition containing nimesulide useful for the treatment of inflammatory conditions and reducing pains which releases 50 to lOOmg of drug within 0.5 to 1.0 hour after oral administration of the composition as initial dose, the remaining drug being release at the rate of 6.0 to 14,0 mg/hour over a period of 15.0 to 18.0 hour as maintenance dose.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing the novel controlled release pharmaceutical composition containing nimesulide, which is useful for the treatment of inflammatory conditions as well as for removing all kinds of pains.<br>
The present invention is based on our finding that in vitro dissolution profile of nimesulide from a composition containing fine particulate form of nimesulide or its solid dispersion when granulated or coated with release controlling polymeric composition which substantially maintain the integrity of the granules or pellets in varying pH conditions of gastrointestinal tract but is permeable to nimesulide, follows zero order release kinetics until a substantial amount, namely 80 to 90%, of the drug is released. This composition, when administered orally to humans in conjunction with an initial dose of nimesulide for immediate release, provides relief of pain over an extended period of 18.0 to 24.0 hours, with better patient compliance.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a novel oral controlled release pharmaceutical composition, useful for the treatment of inflammation and for reducing pains, which comprises an inner core composed of sucrose and starch, the inner core having a coating of an active layer comprising fine particulate form of nimesulide and a hydrophilic polymer as binder, the active layer having a coating of a release modulating polymeric composition comprising of a hydrophobic polymer or a mixture thereof The resulting composition may be filled into a capsule or compressed into a tablet by known method.<br><br>
