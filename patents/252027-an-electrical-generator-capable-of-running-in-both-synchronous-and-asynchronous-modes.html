				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an electrical generator capable of running in both<br>
synchronous and asynchronous modes. More particularly the subject invention is concerned<br>
with power generation by an effective, efficient and economic system which is simple and at<br>
the same time substantially free from operational hazards. This invention also concerns a<br>
method of power generation by employing an asynchronous generator, using brushless<br>
excitation system, although brush and commutator system for its excitation may also be<br>
employed.<br>
A few prior patents exist in related field but none of them deals with or relates to an<br>
electrical generator capable of running in either asynchronous or synchronous mode. Some of<br>
these patents are, inter alia, as follows.<br>
US Patent No. 5920162 relates to servo mechanism operating on feed back signal<br>
from variable exciter, but does not disclose a generator capable of running both in<br>
synchronous and asynchronous modes.<br>
US Patent No. 4168459 deals with maintenance of uninterrupted power supply to<br>
loads and consumers, but does not disclose features of the present invention.<br>
UK Patent No, 509155 deals with method for improving power supply and control<br>
system for electric motors, but does not concern electrical generators operating on<br>
synchronous and/or asynchronous modes.<br>
UK Patent No. 1369844 relates to design and operation of an asynchronous or<br>
induction generator driven at variable speed aircraft turbines, differing substantially from the<br>
electrical generator through a brushless system.<br>
This present invention is based on a process of converging mechanical into electrical<br>
energy by adopting a totally novel concept which has not been anticipated or disclosed in the<br>
prior art<br>
In conventional mode of generating power, now-a-days bulk power generation is<br>
carried out by synchronous generator. Very small exceptions of using induction generators<br>
driven by water turbines are observed in remote areas. Power generation by synchronous<br>
generator with brushless excitation system suffers from the problem of "synchronization".<br><br>
particularly when a number of synchronous generators are used in parallel operation. Another<br>
problem confronting smooth production is "hunting". The stability margin in this case is also<br>
much below the "thermal limit" due mainly to the possibility of loss of synchronism. The<br>
conventional system also suffers from "regulation of frequency" by maintaining constant<br>
rotor speed with the help of governor mechanism, apart from the aforementioned problems of<br>
synchronization and hunting.<br>
In our proposed design, the main generator can be excited from an auxiliary generator<br>
which is called exciter. If the main generator is to run in the asynchronous mode in which its<br>
rotor is driven by the prime mover at a speed different from the synchronous speed at which<br>
the magnetic field rotates, the rotor windings of the main generator and the exciter mounted<br>
on the common shaft are to be electrically connected through their slip rings, which enables<br>
the rotor winding of the main generator to receive slip frequency currents required for<br>
excitation.<br>
In order that the generator may run in the synchronous mode, it is necessary to supply<br>
its rotor winding with (zero frequency) direct current through slip rings. For this purpose,<br>
current from the rotor winding of the exciter is to be rectified through a rectifier mounted on<br>
the common shaft.<br>
The principal object of this invention is to provide an electrical generator capable of<br>
running in both synchronous and asynchronous modes.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a system for using asynchronous<br>
generators by overcoming the problem of generation of rotating magnetic field at the starting<br>
and generating lagging reactive power.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide a system wherein slip frequency<br>
power is injected to the rotors of the asynchronous generators by means of exciters, which are<br>
auxiliary machines.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide an electrical generator with an<br>
auxiliary machine or a system acting as an exciter capable of producing slip frequency<br>
current as well as direct current for injection into the rotor winding of the main generator.<br><br><br>
The foregoing objects are fulfilled by the present invention, which relates to an electrical<br>
generator capable of running in both synchronous and asynchronous modes, comprising a main<br>
generator and a prime mover attached thereto, characterized in that the said generator is equipped with<br>
an exciter for producing slip ring current for injection into the rotor windings of the main generator,<br>
said exciter being mounted on shaft connecting the said generator and prime mover, and wherein the<br>
prime mover carries a stator current control device.<br>
As indicated above, asynchronous generators have the drawbacks like the problem of<br>
producing rotating magnetic field at the starting, and generating lagging reactive power to supply the<br>
load. These drawbacks have been overcome by adopting a new technique of injecting slip frequency<br>
power to the rotors of the asynchronous generators, just as in the case of speed and power factor<br>
control of induction motors by auxiliary machines or exciters providing excitation to the desired level<br>
and extent.<br>
Slip ring induction motors are widely used in the industry for their high starting torque, better<br>
speed control and their rugged construction. They have additional advantages of low initial cost and a<br>
minimal maintenance cost. In the present invention, these machines are used as asynchronous<br>
generators for generating power. The cage rotor induction machine can also be used as asynchronous<br>
generator for power generation provided capacitive devices are connected across the stator windings<br>
as exciters. If the rotor of such a machine is run above synchronous speed by a prime mover, the<br>
machine generates electricity at negative slip (usually between 3% and 5%), which can be used for<br>
transmission and distribution through network.<br>
Requisite excitation may be provided with some auxiliary machine, such as, for instance,<br>
Leblanc, Walker or Scherbiu's machine. Some object of providing excitation may be achieved by<br>
electronic amplifiers using BJT, FET, IGBT or vacuum triode tubes with appropriate values of<br>
resistance, capacitance or inductance in the biasing circuit, as used in FM modulators. The prime<br>
mover at starting rotates the motor of asynchronous generator and its exciter below synchronous<br>
speed if it is connected to the power grid, or above synchronous speed if the system is an isolated one<br>
and not connected to the power grid.<br>
In case of power grid connection, the system first runs as an induction motor and the requisite<br>
magnetizing power is then provided by the power grid, while the core, windage and frictional losses<br>
are provided by the prime mover. But when the prime mover enhances the speed of the machine<br>
above synchronous speed in the same direction as the rotating magnetic field, the machine runs as<br>
generator, delivering electrical power to the connected busbar and drawing its excitation from the<br>
auxiliary machine acting as the exciter.<br><br><br>
For a further embodiment of the present invention, i.e. for an isolated system the machine starts<br>
generation due to remnant or residual magnetism of its stator and rotor core with capacitors connected to<br>
the stator winding. In this instance also auxiliary machines can be used as rotating capacitors since these<br>
provide magnetizing reactive power to the main generator. The electronic reactive power compensator as<br>
disclosed in Indian Patent Application No. 793/KOL/2005 can effectively be used for providing<br>
excitation. For this purpose, the aforesaid compensator device can be directly across the stator winding of<br>
asynchronous generator and as a consequence thereof, no auxiliary exciter is required. As an alternative<br>
both the electronic reactive power compensator and the auxiliary machine as exciter may be used to make<br>
the system full proof with the flexibility of reactive power control.<br>
If a direct connection is not made, then another asynchronous generator with small air gap can be<br>
used as exciter along with the electronic phase compensator or thyristor switched capacitor or<br>
synchronous condenser across its stator windings. If an auxiliary machine, viz. Leblanc machine, Walker<br>
machine or Scherbin's machine with brush and commutator assembly to be used as an exciter, then in<br>
place of variable resistors triac-diac assemblies may be used with their stator windings. The exciters are<br>
mounted on the same shaft of the main generator.<br>
If it is desired to make the system brushless, a second asynchronous generator of smaller rating is<br>
used which receices its rotor current from the rotor of the main generator. The asynchronous generator of<br>
smaller rating having a small air gap is used as an exciter, where capacitive devices are connected to its<br>
stator windings. The two rotor windings of the main generator and exciter are mounted on the same shaft<br>
and rotor windings are connected directly through the slip rings without any brush.<br>
The auxiliary machine which acts as an exciter can be used to produce slip frequency current as<br>
well as direct current for injection into the rotor winding of the main generator. When the exciter runs as a<br>
slip frequency generator, its stator winding is provided with a combination of series or parallel connection<br>
of variable resistors and variable capacitors. On the other hand, when the exciter runs as a direct current<br>
generator, the combinations of variable resistors and variable capacitors are disconnected and a source of<br>
direct current with proper magnitude and polarity which can be adjusted is connected across the stator<br>
winding of the exciter.<br>
When the exciter runs as a D.C generator and the main generator runs as a synchronous generator,<br>
the alternating current produced by the exciter in its rotor winding is rectified by a shaft-mounted rectifier<br>
(uncontrolled), the output of which is fed into the rotor circuit of the main generator and the shaft is<br>
driven at the synchronous speed (n, r.p.s) of the main generator where<br><br><br>
  in which 'f' is the supply frequency in Hz and p, is the number of pole pairs of main<br>
generator.<br>
When the main generator runs in asynchronous mode, the shaft may run between the speeds n and<br>
n1, where n is the synchronous speed of the combination of the main generator and the exciter and n1 is<br>
the synchronous speed of the main generator as stated earlier. The shaft can also be made to run above the<br>
speed n1. The relation between n and n1 may be expressed as-<br><br>
where p1 has been stated earlier and p2 is the number of pole pairs of the exciter.<br>
The invention will now be more particularly illustrated by means of accompanying drawings<br>
wherein,<br>
Fig. 1 shows the electrical generator assembly of the present invention.<br>
Fig.2a is the block representation and Fig.2b is the diagramatic representation of Leblanc machine.<br>
Fig.3 shows the block representation of Walker machine.<br>
Fig.4 is the block representation of Scherbin's machine.<br>
Fig.5 depicts a frequency converter and its control device used as exciter and<br>
Fig.6 shows a brushless system with a second asynchronous generator of smaller rating.<br>
Referring to Fig.1 of the drawings, (1) is the main generator, (2) is the shaft connecting the main<br>
generator (1) and prime mover (4). Exciter assembly (3) is mounted on the main shaft (2) and is equipped<br>
with stator current control device (5). The arrow heads indicate direction of current flow to supply.<br>
Fig.2a showing a block diagrammatic representation of Leblanc machine used as an exciter (3).<br>
which has carbon brushes (6) and commutator (7) attached to the rotor (8). The direction of the arrow<br>
indicates flow of current to main generator rotor.<br>
Fig.2B depicts a diagrammatic representation of Leblanc machine, in which (9) is the stator<br>
carrying a "diac-triac assembly" (10). (8) stands for the rotor along with carbon brush (6) and commutator<br>
(7).<br>
Fig.3 illustrates block representation of Walker machine used as an exciter, in which the rotor (8)<br>
is attached to/connected with carbon brush (6) and commutator (7) assembly, which in turn is connected<br><br>
to the rotor of the main generator, as indicated by the direction of the arrows, through inductors in series<br>
(11).<br>
Fig.4 shows a block representation of Scherbin's machine, which may also be used as an exciter.<br>
This differs from the Walker machine only in the deployment of the inductors. As may be seen from the<br>
drawings, Scherbin's machine uses parallel inductors (12), and the arrow heads signify direction of<br>
connection with the rotor of the main generator.<br>
Fig.5 shows a diagrammatic representation of another embodiment of this invention which is<br>
frequency converter and its control device used as exciter. Incoming current from supply is made to pass<br>
through a variable ratio transformer (13), followed by passage through rotor (8) carrying brush and<br>
commutator assembly. This assembly in turn leads to the main generator rotor.<br>
Fig.6 of the drawings pertains to yet another embodiment of this invention and illustrates a<br>
diagrammatic representation of a brushless system which is in effect a variant of the set-up shown in Fig. 1<br>
of the drawings, wherein sliprings are mounted on the main shaft connecting the prime mover and the<br>
main generator. The location of these devices is usually between said exciter and main generation unit as<br>
indicated in the drawing by (14).<br>
The system of the present invention is simple, yet cost effective. As the electronic components at<br>
different ratings are easily available at a reasonable cost in the open market, assembly/fabrication of the<br>
machine poses no problem.<br>
Apart from the conventional areas of power generation, the system of the present invention can be<br>
put to good use in non-conventional areas of power generation such as, for instance,- (i) wind, (ii) tidal<br>
waves, (iii) oceanic current, etc., the last named having been developed by Chinese Engineers using the<br>
principle of diffraction grating.<br>
Additional modifications and improvements of the present invention may also be apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art. Thus, the particular combination of parts described and illustrated herein is<br>
