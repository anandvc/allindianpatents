The invention relates to transporting and storage containers for liquids, having a pallet-like substructure, which is designed for handling by a stacker truck, storage and retrieval unit or similar transporting means, having an inner container made of plastic and with a filling nozzle and an outlet nozzle which can be closed, and having a grid casing which butts against the inner container and also [sic] crisscrossing horizontal and vertical grid bars made of metal.<br>
Transporting and storage containers of the generic type which are known from DE 197 22 194 C2 and have a blow-moulded inner container made of plastic are used for storing and for transporting all types of liquids in the chemical, pharmaceutical, mineral-oil and foodstuff industries.<br>
The stringent legal environmental-protection regulations require transfer from disposable containers, such as pallet containers and drums or barrels, for transporting and for storing different types of liquids to reusable containers, a changeover to larger-volume containers with the aim of reducing the residual quantities, and the development of new reusable containers which, in terms of relieving the environment of harmful substances, can be reconditioned and of which the plastic constituent parts contaminated by the liquid transporting and storage contents can be disposed of in optimum fashion by a low-pollutant or even pollutant-free destruction operation, e.g. by incineration.<br>
The obj ect of the invention is further to develop the transporting and storage container of the generic type in terms of a cost-effective reconditioning capacity by inexpensive production and<br><br>
optimum disposal of the plastic inner container and in terfhs^of transportation safety which satisfies extremely high requirements.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a transporting and storage container for liquids having the features as described herein.<br>
The advantageous developments of the invention are also described herein.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a transporting and storage container for liquids, having a pallet-like substructure which is designed for handling by a stacker truck, storage and retrieval unit or similar transporting means, having an inner container made of plastic and with a filling nozzle and an outlet nozzle which can be closed, and having a grid casing which butts against the inner container and is made of criss-crossing horizontal and vertical grid bars made of metal, characterized in that a flexible inner container made of plastic and a securing means which is fastened in a removable manner on the grid casing, for the outlet nozzle, which is provided on the inner container and is made of plastic, for the connection of a removal fitting (butterfly valve) as required.<br>
The transporting and storage container for liquids according to the invention is distinguished by the following advantages:<br><br>
Designing the inner container as a flexible container, whfch comprises an inner enclosure made of plastic sheet material and an outer enclosure made of a woven fabric material, makes it possible, in relation to liquid containers having an inner container blow-moulded from plastic, to reduce the empty weight and the transportation costs on account of the low thickness of the sheeting and of the woven fabric material and to decrease to a considerable extent the amount of plastic material contaminated by paints, varnishes and similar environmentally harmful liquids, with the result that the disposal of said plastic material does not pose any problems. The transporting container can be reconditioned cost-effectively at the production and liquid-filling companies by straightforwardly exchanging the inexpensive inner container, the small amount of space required for the flexible inner container, on account of the fact that it can be folded together, and the low production costs of the inner container making inexpensive storage possible. The production of the flexible inner container from a plastic sheet material and a woven fabric material preferably made of plastic is more cost-effective than the production of blow-moulded plastic inner containers using expensive blow-moulding machines, which require high investment costs. Finally, the securing means, which is to be fastened on a horizontal grid bar on the inside of the grid casing<br><br>
and is intended for the inner-container^ouciec nozzie, to which a removal fitting can be connected, satisfies the prescribed transportation-safety requirements for the liquid container equipped with a flexible inner container.<br>
The transporting and storage container for liquids according to the invention is explained hereinbelow with reference to schematic drawings, in which,<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a perspective illustration of a transporting and storage container,<br>
