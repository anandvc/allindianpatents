Apparatus at a draw frame having a drawing mechanism for<br>
the doubling and drafting of fibre slivers, having an<br>
adjusting device<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus at a draw frame<br>
having a drawing mechanism for the doubling and drafting of<br>
fibre slivers, having a drawing mechanism frame for<br>
accommodating the drawing mechanism, which has at least two<br>
pairs of rollers each comprising an upper roller and a<br>
lower roller, having means for adjusting the spacing of at<br>
least one of the lower rollers in relation to another lower<br>
roller, in each case having a mounting device for<br>
accommodating the lower roller, wherein lower rollers are<br>
arranged to be driven by at least one drive element<br>
endlessly revolving around pulley wheels.<br>
In a known apparatus (DE-OS 20 44 996), the mountings of<br>
the intake and middle lower rollers are displaceable on the<br>
frame of the machine so that the extent of the drawing zone<br>
can be matched to the particular fibre staple. A tensioning<br>
pulley wheel, which is displaceable in a guideway in the<br>
frame of the machine, allows the length of the toothed belt<br>
to be modified in accordance with the changed spacing<br>
between the axes of the middle roller and a guide pulley<br>
wheel, brought about by displacement of the intake roller.<br>
The middle roller is driven by a further toothed belt. The<br><br>
latter toothed belt is tensioned by a tensioning pulley<br>
wheel which is fastened to the machine frame and which can<br>
pivot about one axis; as a result, it can also be matched<br>
to changed spacings between the axes of the intake roller<br>
and middle roller. It is disadvantageous that displacing<br>
devices for displacement of the intake roller and the<br>
middle roller and additional tensioning devices for re-<br>
tensioning of the toothed belts after the displacement<br>
operations are necessary, requiring a considerable outlay<br>
in terms of construction. In addition, it is disadvant-<br>
ageous that a number of work steps are required for the<br>
displacement operations and the subsequent re-tensioning<br>
operations. The belt tension is destroyed by the<br>
displacement process. Where the displacement is carried out<br>
manually, spacers are inserted between the mountings, the<br>
mountings being pushed against the spacers so that, in this<br>
case too, the amount of set-up work is considerable.<br>
Finally, the displacement and re-tensioning operations<br>
result in a doubling of potential error sources when<br>
setting the spacings and belt tensions.<br>
The problem underlying the invention is accordingly to<br>
provide an apparatus of the kind described at the beginning<br>
that avoids the disadvantages mentioned and that especially<br>
is of simple construction and allows a considerable<br>
reduction in the work and time required for adjustment of<br><br>
the slider(s) and, accordingly, of the extent(s) of the<br>
drawing zone(s).<br>
According to the invention there is provided an<br>
apparatus at a draw frame having a drawing mechanism for<br>
the doubling and drafting of fibre slivers, having a<br>
drawing mechanism frame for accommodating the drawing<br>
mechanism, which has at least two pairs of rollers each<br>
comprising an upper roller and a lower roller, having means<br>
for adjusting the spacing of at least one of the lower<br>
rollers in relation to another lower roller, in each case<br>
having a mounting device for accommodating the lower<br>
roller, wherein lower rollers are arranged to be driven by<br>
at least one drive element endlessly revolving around<br>
pulley wheels, characterised in that at least one pulley<br>
wheel and the tensioned drive element are used for<br>
adjusting the mounting device, wherein a moving force<br>
applied to the pulley wheel or to the drive element can be<br>
converted into the adjusting movement for the mounting<br>
device.<br>
The measures according to the invention make it<br>
possible, by simple means, for the mountings and, as a<br>
result, the extents of the drawing zones (nip line<br>
spacings) to be adjusted in a short time. For the purpose<br>
of adjusting the extents of the drawing zones, elegant use<br>
is made of existing structural elements necessarily present<br>
in the draw frame, namely a pulley wheel and the drive<br><br>
belt. Separate apparatuses for adjustment are not required.<br>
As a result of the fact that the drive belt is in tension<br>
before, during and after adjustment, further apparatuses<br>
for re-tensioning the drive belt after the adjustment are<br>
not required, which allows the extents of the drawing zones<br>
of the draw frame to be changed in a short time by means<br>
that are especially simple in terms of construction.<br>

invention.<br>

In accordance with Figure 1, a draw frame 1, for<br>
example a Trutzschler HSR draw frame, has a drawing<br>
mechanism 2, upstream of which is an intake 3 of the<br>
drawing mechanism and downstream of which is an exit 4 from<br>
the drawing mechanism. The fibre slivers 5, coming from<br>
cans (not shown), enter the sliver guide 6 and, drawn by<br>
the draw-off rollers 7, 8, are transported past the<br><br>
measuring element 9. The drawing mechanism 2 is designed as<br>
a 4-over-3 drawing mechanism, that is to say it consists of<br>
three lower rollers I, II, III (I delivery lower roller, II<br>
middle lower roller, III intake lower roller) and four<br>
upper rollers 11, 12, 13, 14. Drafting of the fibre sliver<br>
combination 5' from a plurality of fibre slivers 5 is<br>
carried out in the drawing mechanism 2. Drafting is<br>
composed of preliminary drafting and main drafting. The<br>
roller pairs 14/111 and 13/11 form the preliminary draft<br>
zone and the roller pairs 13/11 and 11, 12/1 form the main<br>
draft zone.<br>
The attenuated fibre slivers 5 reach a web guide 10 in<br>
the exit 4 from the drawing mechanism and, by means of the<br>
draw-off rollers 15, 16, are drawn through a sliver<br>
funnel 17, in which they are combined to form one fibre<br>
sliver 18, which is then deposited in cans. Reference<br>
letter A denotes the work direction.<br>
The draw-off rollers 7, 8, the intake lower roller III<br>
and the middle lower roller II, which are connected to one<br>
another mechanically, for example by toothed belts, are<br>
driven by the control motor 19, it being possible, in the<br>
process, for a desired value to be specified. (The<br>
associated upper rollers 14 and 13, respectively, revolve<br>
by virtue of the motion of the lower rollers.) The delivery<br>
lower roller I and the draw-off rollers 15, 16 are driven<br>
by the main motor 20. The control motor 19 and the main<br><br>
motor 20 each have their own controller 21 and 22,<br>
respectively. Control (speed-of-rotation control) is<br>
carried out in each case by means of a closed control loop,<br>
a tachogenerator 23 being associated with the control<br>
motor 19 and a tachogenerator 24 being associated with the<br>
main motor 20. At the intake 3 of the drawing mechanism, a<br>
variable proportional to the weight of the fibre slivers 5<br>
fed in, for example their cross-section, is measured by an<br>
intake measuring element 9 known, for example, from<br>
DE-A- 44 04 326. At the exit 4 from the drawing mechanism,<br>
the cross-section of the delivered fibre sliver 18 is<br>
ascertained by an exit measuring element 25 associated with<br>
the sliver funnel 17 and known, for example, from<br>
DE-A- 195 37 983. A central computer unit 26 (control and<br>
regulation device), for example a microcomputer with a<br>
microprocessor, sends a setting for the desired value for<br>
the control motor 19 to the controller 21. The measurement<br>
values of the two measuring elements 9 and 25 are sent to<br>
the central computer unit 26 during the drawing process.<br>
The desired value for the control motor 19 is determined in<br>
the central computer unit 26 from the measurement values of<br>
the intake measuring element 9 and from the desired value<br>
for the cross-section of the delivered fibre sliver 18. The<br>
measurement values of the exit measuring element 25 are<br>
used for monitoring of the delivered fibre sliver 18<br>
(delivered sliver monitoring). By means of this control<br><br>
system, it is possible for variations in the cross-section of the fibre slivers 5 fed<br>
in to be compensated, and for the fibre sliver to be made more uniform, by<br>
appropriately regulating the drafting process. Reference numeral 27 denotes a<br>
display monitor, 28 an interface, 29 an input device, 30 a pressure rod and 31<br>
a memory.<br>
In accordance with Fig.2, the trunnions Ia, IIa, IIIa (see Fig.3b) of the lower<br>
rollers I, II and III are mounted so as to be capable of rotation in mountings<br>
32a, 33a, 34a (32b, 33b, 34b are located on the other side of the drawing<br>
mechanism and are not shown). The mountings 33a and 34a are bolted onto<br>
sliders 35a and 36a, respectively, forming a mounting device, which are<br>
displaceable in the direction of arrows C,D and E, F, respectively, along a bar<br>
37a. The two ends of the bar 37a are fixedly mounted in mounting blocks 38'<br>
(38" not shown), which are attached to the frame 39 of the machine.<br>
Displacement of the sliders 35a, 35b; 36a, 36b at the same time causes the<br>
mountings 33a, 33b; 34a, 34b and, as a result , the lower rollers II and III,<br>
respectively, to be displaced and moved in directions C,D and E, F,<br>
respectively. The associated upper rollers 13 and 14 are correspondingly moved<br>
(in a manner not shown) in directions C, D and E, F, respectively. By that<br>
means, the nip line spacings between the roller combinations are modified and<br>
set.<br><br>
Locking of the sliders 35a, 35b; 36a, 36b is<br>
accomplished by means of a catch device, stopping device or<br>
the like (see Fig. 7).<br>
In accordance with Fig. 3a, the lower rollers II and<br>
III are driven from the right-hand side of the draw frame,<br>
seen in the direction of material flow A, by means of a<br>
common loop mechanism in the form of toothed belt<br>
wheels 40, 41 and a toothed belt 47. The different speeds<br>
of rotation of the lower rollers II and III are achieved by<br>
means of change-gearwheels at the drive trunnions IIa, IIIa<br>
provided with different numbers of teeth. The toothed<br>
belt 47 runs in direction B (that is to say contrary to the<br>
work direction) onto the control drive, which is in the<br>
form of a servo motor 19. The lower roller I is driven from<br>
the left-hand side of the machine by means of a loop<br>
mechanism in the form of toothed belt wheels and a toothed<br>
belt 47'. For that purpose, the toothed belt 47' runs on<br>
the left-hand side from the toothed belt disc 40 at the<br>
lower roller I in direction G onto the servo motor 20.<br>
In operation, that is to say when the fibre slivers are<br>
running in direction A, the toothed belt 47 moves in<br>
direction G. Starting from the toothed belt wheel 47<br>
arranged on the drive motor 19, the toothed belt 47 runs<br>
successively over a toothed belt wheel 45, a smooth guide<br>
pulley wheel 46, the toothed belt wheel 40 (roller-driving<br>
pulley wheel for the lower roller III), the toothed belt<br><br>
wheel 41 (roller-driving pulley wheel for the lower<br>
roller II), a smooth guide pulley wheel 42 and a toothed<br>
belt wheel 43. By means of its teeth, the toothed belt 47<br>
is.in positive engagement with the toothed belt wheels 40,<br>
41, 43, 44 and 45. The smooth side.(reverse) of the toothed<br>
belt 47, opposite the toothed side, is in contact and in<br>
engagement with the smooth guide pulley wheels 46 and 42.<br>
The toothed belt 47 loops around all the pulley wheels 40<br>
to 46. In operation (when the fibre slivers are running in<br>
direction A during drafting), the toothed belt wheels 40,<br>
41, 43, 44 and 45 rotate clockwise and the guide pulley<br>
wheels 42 and 46 rotate anti-clockwise.<br>
The toothed belt wheels 40, 41 are associated with the<br>
mountings 34a and 33a, respectively, whereas the guide<br>
pulley wheels 42, 46 are attached to the sliders 35a and<br>
36a, respectively, in a manner allowing rotation. Because<br>
of the rigid attachment between the mounting 34a and the<br>
slider 36a and between the mounting 33a and the slider 35a<br>
(for example, by means of bolts), there are associated with<br>
the lower rollers II and III, in each case, one toothed<br>
belt wheel 40 to 41 and one guide pulley wheel 46 and 42,<br>
respectively. The toothed belt 47 runs around the pulley<br>
wheels 40, 46, on the one hand, and around the pulley<br>
wheels 41, 42, on the other hand, in a mirror-reflected<br>
arrangement (see Fig. 3b).<br><br>
The zone between the pairs of rollers 13/II and 14/III<br>
is designated VV (preliminary drafting) and the zone<br>
between the pairs of rollers 12/I and 13/II is designated<br>
HV (main drafting) (see Fig. 4a). When, in accordance with<br>
Fig. 3a, the nip line spacing between the roller<br>
pairs 14/III and 13/II is to be increased, at least one<br>
pair of rollers must be moved away from the respective<br>
other pair of rollers. For that purpose the slider 35a may<br>
be displaced towards the right, which may be accomplished<br>
in two ways:<br>
a) The slider 35a is unlocked. A pulley wheel, for<br>
example the toothed belt wheel 44, is stopped so<br>
that there is no possibility of rotation. Stopping<br>
may be accomplished, for example, by mechanical or<br>
electromagnetic means. As a result the toothed<br>
belt 47 is stationary and cannot be moved. The<br>
toothed belt wheel 41 is then rotated anti-<br>
clockwise, for example manually using a crank or<br>
the like, whereupon the guide pulley wheel 42<br>
likewise rotates, clockwise, as a matter of<br>
necessity. In the process, the rotary movement of<br>
the toothed belt wheel 41 is converted into a<br>
longitudinal movement of the slider 35a in<br>
direction C, the toothed belt wheel 41 and the<br>
guide pulley wheel 42 winding along opposite sides<br>
of the stationary toothed belt 47, thereby<br><br>
"shortening", as it were, the toothed belt 47 at<br>
one pulley wheel and "lengthening" it at the other<br>
pulley wheel. The length of belt required during<br>
that "winding along" at the toothed belt wheel 41<br>
is made available at the guide pulley wheel 42.<br>
The lower roller II is thereby displaced in<br>
direction C by means of the slider 35a and the<br>
mounting 33a.<br>
b) The slider 35a is unlocked. The toothed belt<br>
wheel 41 is stopped so that there is no<br>
possibility of rotation. As a result the guide<br>
pulley wheel 42 is also stopped of necessity.<br>
Then, clockwise rotation is brought about by means<br>
of the drive motor 19. The toothed belt 47 moves<br>
in direction G, likewise "shortening" the belt 47<br>
at one pulley wheel and "lengthening" it at the<br>
other pulley wheel. The length of belt actually<br>
required between the toothed belt wheels 40 and 41<br>
is made available between the toothed belt<br>
wheels 43 and pulley wheel 42. The rotary movement<br>
of the toothed belt wheel 44 and the movement of<br>
the toothed belt 47 is thereby converted into a<br>
longitudinal movement of the slider 35a in<br>
direction C. The lower roller II, mounted in the<br>
mounting 33a (which is rigidly connected to the<br><br>
slider 35a), is likewise moved in direction C as a<br>
result.<br>
In practice, it is often the case that, in accordance<br>
with Figs. 4a to 4d, first the preliminary draft zone VV is<br>
modified and then the main draft zone HV. In the case of<br>
shortening of the draft zones VV and HV, the slider 36a is<br>
displaced in the direction of the arrow E from the position<br>
according to Fig. 4a into the position according to<br>
Fig. 4b. As a result, the nip line spacing in the<br>
preliminary draft zone VV is reduced from "a" to "a'".<br>
Then, in accordance with Fig. 4c, the sliders 36a and 35a<br>
are rigidly connected to one another by means of a<br>
bridge 50. Finally, the rigidly coupled sliders 36a and 35a<br>
are moved, in accordance with Fig. 4d, in the direction of<br>
the arrows E and C, from the position shown in Fig. 4c into<br>
the position shown in Fig. 4d. As a result, the nip line<br>
spacing in the main draft zone HV is shortened from "b" to<br>
"b'". - A corresponding procedure is used in the case of<br>
lengthening the preliminary and main draft zones, that is<br>
to say the coupled sliders 35a and 36a are displaced in the<br>
direction of the arrows F and D (see Fig. 2), as a result<br>
of which the main draft zone HV is lengthened. Then, the<br>
sliders 35a and 36a are uncoupled from the bridge 50.<br>
Finally, the slider 36a is moved in the direction of the<br>
arrow F (see Fig. 2), as a result of which the preliminary<br>
draft zone VV is lengthened.<br><br>
With regard to the fibre slivers 5 in the drawing<br>
mechanism 2, it should be noted that, in the case of<br>
shortening of the draft zones VV and HV, a small amount of<br>
stretching, in direction B, of the fibre slivers 5IV<br>
upstream of the pair of rollers 14/III can occur on<br>
displacement in accordance with Figs. 4a, 4b, but because<br>
of the length (about 1.5m) of the spacing between the<br>
transport rollers 7, 8 and the pair of rollers 14/III this<br>
is without significance. In the case of shortening, a<br>
sagging loop does not form in the preliminary draft zone VV<br>
because in the case of displacement referring to the pairs<br>
of rollers 14/III and 13/II either one or both pairs of<br>
rollers are rotatable because the drives to both pairs of<br>
rollers are coupled by way of the toothed belt 47. In<br>
contrast, in the case of shortening of the main draft<br>
zone HV, a sagging loop is formed in fibre slivers 5',<br>
which is drawn out or drawn straight by rotation of the<br>
pair of rollers 12/I in the work direction A by means of<br>
the main motor 20. - In the case of lengthening of the<br>
draft zones VV and HV, the pair of rollers 12/I is, in a<br>
first step, rotated backwards in direction B, whereupon a<br>
sagging loop is intentionally formed in the fibre<br>
slivers 5'. When the main draft zone HV is subsequently<br>
lengthened by displacement of the coupled sliders 35a and<br>
36a in direction D and F, the artificially formed loop is,<br>
in the process, once again drawn out or drawn straight.<br><br>
Finally, after uncoupling of the bridge 50, the slider 36a<br>
is displaced in direction F. As a result of the above-<br>
mentioned coupling of the drives to the intake and middle<br>
lower roller pairs by means of the toothed belt 47, the<br>
length of the fibre slivers 5' in the preliminary draft<br>
zone VV remains unaffected. Possible slight compression of<br>
the fibre slivers 5IV upstream of the pair of rollers<br>
14/III is, in respect of the drafting and the constitution<br>
of the fibre slivers 5IV, without significance.<br>
Figs. 5a, 5b show the construction bringing about the<br>
displacement of the sliders 36a and 35a. The nip line<br>
spacing in the preliminary draft zone VV is lengthened from<br>
"a" (Fig. 5a) to "a"" (Fig. 5b). The sliders 36a and 35a<br>
are displaced one after the other according to the arrows E<br>
and C, respectively. Displacement is accomplished by<br>
stopping the toothed belt wheel 40 or fixing it with a<br>
holding brake or the like and then actuating the drive<br>
motor 19, whereupon the toothed belt 47 moves. In<br>
continuation thereof, the sliders 36a and 35a are displaced<br>
in accordance with Figs. 4a, 4b and, subsequently,<br>
Figs. 4c, 4d.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 6a, an electromagnetic holding<br>
brake is provided, which has a rod-shaped iron core 53<br>
surrounded by a plunger coil 54. Mounted on one end face of<br>
the iron core 53 is a brake shoe 55, for example made of<br>
plastics material or the like. The iron core 53 is<br><br>
displaceable in the direction of the arrows M, N. When<br>
current flows through the plunger coil 54, the iron core 53<br>
is moved in direction M, in accordance with Fig. 6b, so<br>
that the brake shoe 55 is pressed against the smooth<br>
cylindrical surface of the shaft 44a of the toothed belt<br>
wheel 44. As a result, the toothed belt wheel 44 is fixed<br>
(stopped) so that it cannot rotate, for as long as voltage<br>
is applied to the plunger coil 54.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 7, a pneumatic cylinder 60<br>
having a piston rod 61 is attached to the slider 36a. When<br>
subjected to pressure from the pneumatic cylinder 60, the<br>
piston rod 61 is moved out in the direction of the arrow P<br>
and comes to rest, with a high degree of contact pressure,<br>
against the machine frame 61. The slider 36a is fixed<br>
(stopped) so that it cannot be displaced with respect to<br>
the bar 37a, for as long as compressed air is applied to<br>
the pneumatic cylinder 60.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 8, there is provided, as the<br>
bridge 50 between the sliders 35a and 36a, a flat piece of<br>
metal (plate), which is fastened in the region of one of<br>
its ends 50a to the slider 36a, for example using bolts. In<br>
its region 50b facing the slider 35a, the flat piece of<br>
metal has an elongate hole 50c, through which a bolt 62 can<br>
engage in a threaded hole (not shown) in the slider 35a. By<br>
means of this bridge 50, the sliders 35a and 36a can be<br><br>
rigidly connected to one another, releasably, at different<br>
spacings with respect to one another.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 9, in contrast to Fig. 1, each<br>
lower roller I, II and III is driven by its own drive<br>
motor 20, 52 and 19, respectively, as shown, for example,<br>
in DE-OS 38 01 880. The motor 20 drives the toothed belt<br>
wheel 55 of the lower roller I by way of the toothed<br>
belt 56; the motor 52 drives the toothed belt wheel 41 of<br>
the lower roller II by way of the toothed belt 57; and the<br>
motor 19 drives the toothed belt wheel 40 of the lower<br>
roller III by way of the toothed belt 47. Attached to the<br>
slider 36a, in addition to the smooth guide pulley<br>
wheel 46, is a further smooth guide pulley wheel 51. The<br>
endless toothed belt 47 loops around, in succession, the<br>
pulley wheels 44, 46, 40, 51 and 43. The toothed belt<br>
wheels 44, 40 and 43 are in engagement with the teeth of<br>
the toothed belt 47, whereas the smooth guide pulley<br>
wheels 46 and 51 are in engagement with the smooth reverse<br>
side of the toothed belt 47. The sliders 35a and 36a are<br>
rigidly connected to one another, releasably, by means of<br>
the bridge 50. When they are not connected by the<br>
bridge 50, the sliders 35a and 36a are individually<br>
displaceable and when they are connected by the bridge 50<br>
they are jointly displaceable.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 10, the drive motor 19 for<br>
lower rollers II and III is in communication with the<br><br>
electronic control and regulation device 26. Adjustment<br>
values for modification of the draft zones VV and HV (that<br>
is to say the extents of the drawing zones) either can be<br>
entered manually by way of the input device 29 or can be<br>
called up from a memory 31 for particular categories of<br>
fibre material.<br>
Adjustment of the nip line spacing in the preliminary<br>
draft zone VV and/or the main draft zone HV can be carried<br>
out with the fibre slivers 5 inserted.<br>
Displacement can be carried out with the upper rollers<br>
11 to 14 in the loaded state. Figs. 1 and 10 show inserted<br>
fibre slivers 5 and loaded upper rollers 11 to 14. With the<br>
fibre slivers inserted and the upper rollers 11 to 14<br>
loaded, the sliders 35a, 36a or mountings of at least one<br>
lower roller II, III are unlocked, the sliders or mountings<br>
are set to the desired nip line spacing a, a'; b, b' by<br>
means of a displacement device, for example in accordance<br>
with Figs. 3a, 3b; 5a, 5b and then the sliders 35a, 36a or<br>
mountings are locked again (for example in accordance with<br>
Fig. 7) .<br>
Displacement can also be carried out with the upper<br>
rollers 11 to 14 lifted off. The upper rollers 11 to 14 may<br>
be lifted off completely from the lower rollers I to III in<br>
the manner shown in DE-OS 197 04 815, the upper roller 14<br>
being swung out on a portal 58 about a pivot mounting 59.<br>
However, it may also be sufficient for the upper rollers 11<br><br>
to 14 to be unloaded and to be lifted off from the lower<br>
rollers I to III only to a slight degree such that the<br>
fibre slivers 5 are not caught by the pairs of rollers<br>
during displacement of the draft zones VV and HV but can<br>
slide through the roller nip without being adversely<br>
affected.<br>
The invention has been illustrated using the example of the<br>
adjustment of the nip line spacings of a drawing mechanism<br>
of a draw frame. It likewise encompasses the adjustment of<br>
drawing mechanisms of other machines, for example carding<br>
machines, combing machines, fly frames and ring spinning<br>
frames.<br><br>
