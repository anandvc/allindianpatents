FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
This invention in general relates to the field of wireless multimedia networks. Particularly this invention relates to the field of dynamic flow control, buffer management and admission control for wireless multimedia networks. More specifically, this invention relates to a system and method for dynamic flow control and buffer management in wireless multimedia networks<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Referring to FIG. 1 where data packets for fooA/ard link flows are sent from correspondent node (ON), through base station, to mobile stations (MS) in a wireless multimedia network which consists of the base station controller (BSC), base transceiver station (BTS), point coordination function (PCF), wireless edge router (WER) and the correspondent node (CN). An IP networking architecture for this type of networks is described in www.3qpp2.org: 3GPP2P.S0001B, "Wireless IP standard".<br>
In a 3G wireless network. BTS serves packets over the air-link for mobile stations. BTS is connected to the BSC using a wireline link and memory at the BTS is usually much smaller than at the BSC. The BSC gets IP packets, fragments those to MAC packets and sends those to BTS. In a 3G network, time is typically divided into fixed length time slots. Each mobile station (MS) informs the base station about the rate at which it can accept data in each of the slots on fonvard link. This rate can vary rapidly in a wide-area wireless network. This maximum allowed rate, is specified via two parameters: number of bytes in physical layer packet that can be sent over the air-interface starting from this slot n and the number of slots that would be taken by this packet. There is a scheduler at the BTS which schedules these packets over the air for mobile stations. In this case, if mobile k is selected to be served via the fonA/ard link scheduler and the mobile has specified that it would need more than one slot for transmission, then it would be served for the specified number of slots (or until<br><br>
the physical layer packet transmission is over or whichever occurs earlier). Some data rates for a CDMA2000 system are shown in the table 1 below.<br><br>
There are other types of cellular wireless networks such as wireless local area networks (WLANs). A schematic diagram of a WLAN network is shown in Figure 2, Here, MS is a mobile station wirelessly connected to the access point AP. Each AP provides connectivity to a set of mobile stations called a basic service set (BSS) in IEEE 802.11 parlance. In a BSS, mobile stations are controlled by an access point (AP) that decides when a mobile station can transmit or receive data packets. Multiple APs can be connected to each other using a wired or wireless backbone (distribution system) resulting in a WLAN with extended reach. This is called an extended service set (ESS) in the IEEE 802,11 parlance. One ESS has one 32-octet long service set identifier (SSID). Each BSS has a 6-octet long basic service set identifier (BSSID) which is same as the MAC address of radio in the access point. The manner in which air-link resources are allocated to different mobile users and their applications over the air interface in a wireless network, determines the performance of different applications and utilization of network resources. For this purpose, one needs to have efficient traffic scheduling mechanisms to control traffic flows in both directions over the air interface.<br>
In a 3G or WLAN network, it can happen that a mobile stations MSz has large number of MAC packets accumulated for one or more of its flows at the AP (i.e.<br><br>
BTS in a 3G networl
In such situations, if one stores some of these packets at an upstream node (like the BSC in 3G network or an upstream node such as an aggregator (Aggregator aggregates traffic coming from several WLAN APs) in a WLAN network as shown in Figure 3) for some more time (before sending those to the 3G-BTS or WLAN-AP), one can reduce number of packets dropped at the AP and improve application performance. For this purpose, there is a need to have an effective buffer management mechanism at the AP (3G-BTS or WLAN-AP) and a flow control mechanism between the 3G-BTS and the 3G-BSC in 3G networks (similarly between WLAN-AP and an upstream aggregator in WLAN networks). Each application also has certain quality of service requirements which could include some of the following: delay bound, delay jitter, average delay, throughput and packet loss. The buffer management, flow control and admission control mechanisms should be such that they don't violate quality of service requirements of applications.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
As explained above, there is need to have an effective buffer management mechanism in the BTS in 3G network and a dynamic flow control mechanism between the BTS and the BSC. Similarly, such effective mechanisms are needed for flow control between WLAN access point and WLAN aggregator in a WLAN   network.   Similarly,   such   methods  are  also  needed   in  3G-WLAN<br><br>
integrated network and in other types of cellular wireless networks. Presently most of the methods tend to be of static nature and there are no such methods having dynamic flow control and buffer management for cellular networks as described here in this invention. As channel conditions in wireless networks can change very rapidly and some of the data applications also have busy traffic, static methods are not very effective and can result in violation of quality of service constraints of applications and poor utilization of a wireless network.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In this invention a system and methods are proposed for having a dynamic flow control, dynamic buffer management and admission control for a cellular wireless network where there are heterogeneous applications (such as VoIP, multimedia conferencing, video streaming, wireless games etc.) with different quality of service requirements. Real-time applications such as multimedia conferencing and streaming have stringent requirements on delay bound and delay jitter. In addition, they also have requirements on minimum throughput and packet loss.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In many types of wireless networks, IP packets are segmented to MAC packets before they are transmitted over the air by the access point towards mobile<br><br>
devices. For the purpose of the flow control, buffer management and admission control mechanisms invented in this document, we classify flows as follows:<br>
Class 1: For flows such as voice (VoIP) that have very stringent requirements over delay bound and jitter. These flows may also specify their required rate.<br>
Class 2: For flows such as video conferencing that have stringent requirements over delay bound and jitter. Some of these flows may also specify their required rate as well as desired rate.<br>
Class 3: For flows such as video streaming that have requirements over delay bound, jitter and rate but which are more relaxed when compared to flows which belong to Class 1 or 2.<br>
Class 4: For flows which have requirements over average delay and rate (like web browsing) or only on rate (like FTP applications).<br>
Class 5: Flows which have no QoS requirements (called best effort flows).<br>
Mechanism I: Dynamic Buffer Management, Flow Control and Admission Control<br>
The dynamic buffer management, flow control and admission control mechanisms invented here work as follows.<br>
Step A:<br>
Each flow is assigned some amount of fixed buffer initially which depends upon its traffic characteristics and QoS requirements. Let buff _min_ flow{k, J) be this<br>
fixed amount of buffer allocated to flow k of class J. Here, buff_m\n_flow(k,J) = buff_m\n_flowip,J)==buff_min{J) for two different flows<br>
k and p belonging to the same class J.<br><br>
step B - Dynamic Computation of Maximum Allowable Buffer for Each Flow:<br>
Let A^7" be the minimum number of flows that are allowed corresponding to class J at the access point.    Let num_flows{Jj)  be the number of flows<br>
corresponding to class J that is present in the system (i.e. at the access point) at time t.<br>
For each flow k corresponding to class J, maximum number of MAC packets that are allowed to be stored at time t at the access point,  buff _max_flowik,J,t), is<br>
computed dynamically. Note that buff_max_flow(k,J,t) is a function of flow<br>
identifier, flow type and time. This is shown in Figure 4. It is quite possible that buff_msoi_flow(k,Jj)^buff_max_flow{p,Jj) for two different flows, k and p,<br>
belonging     to     the     same     class     J.     It     is     also     possible     that<br>
buff_meix_flow(k,Jj^)^buff_max_flow(k,Jj2) for two time instants t^ and ^2<br>
such that ti i^t^ for same flow k. Computation of buff _m3x_flow(k,J,t) takes<br>
into account channel conditions for mobile stations, traffic characteristics and QoS requirements for flow k.<br>
Dynamic   computation   of   buff_max_flow(k,Jj)\s   done   as   follows.   Let<br>
arr_rate{k,J) be the pre-specified average arrival rate of flow k belonging to<br>
class J. This average arrival rate is specified as part of traffic profile of this flow. In some wireless networking systems (such as 3G wireless networks), each mobile station informs the access point (base station) the rate at which the access point can send data to that mobile station at that time instant (or in that slot in a discrete time wireless system). Let A[k,n\be the rate indicated by the<br>
mobile station corresponding to flow k in the time slot n (considering a discrete<br><br>
time wireless system), and A{k,n) be its exponentially weighted moving average<br>
1	    1<br>
where A{k,n) =—A[k,n\-\-{\—)A{k,n-\). Here, a time constant t^ is chosen such that 0 
 <br>
allowed to be stored for flow k belonging to class J, at time t, at the access point is calculated as follows:<br><br>
Here, buff^ap, is the total buffer pool at the AP, buff_res_min is the minimum<br>
amount of reserved buffer at the AP, and buff^common is the remaining amount<br>
of common buffer which is used to allocate space for new flows as well as for<br>
admitted flows after they have used up their minimum reserved buffer space.<br>
For each flow k belonging to some class J, a positive threshold,<br>
buff _ max_ thres{k, J)	is	specified	such	that<br>
buff _ niax_ flow{k, J, t) 
Here, ^„,ax(-'0 = maXp{^(/?,0}. considering flows (corresponding to class J=1, 2, 3 or 4) for all mobile stations which are present in the system at time t, and A{k,t) is computed for each flow k starting from the time when that flow session was established in the system.<br>
Minimum of average arrival rate, arr_rate^^^{,,J) = m\nimump{arr_rate{p,J)},<br>
considering each flow p corresponding to class J=1, 2, 3 or 4 which is present in the system at time t.<br><br>
For each flow k belonging to some class J, p^^ys are chosen such that p,^j &gt; 0,<br><br>
Let qdepth{k,J,t) be the number of MAC packets stored at the access point for flow k corresponding to class J at time t.<br>
Step C - Buffer Management:<br>
A common buffer pool,  buff ^common, is allocated and it is used for two<br>
purposes. First, to store packets of a flow when it has already used its minimum fixed quota, (i.e. to store packets for each flow k for each class J when it has used its minimum allocated quota buff _min_flow(k,J)). Second, to allocate<br>
buffer space for new flows of a class J when number of flows present in the system    for    that    class    has    already    exceeded     A^7".    Thus,    if<br>
mm_flows{J,t) = A^7" and if a new flow h corresponding to class J appears in the system, it could be allocated buffer space equal to buff _n\m_flow{h,J) if that space is available in the common buffer pool, buff ^common. Let buff _res_m\n_class{J) be the minimum amount of buffer reserved for flows belonging to class J. Refer to Figure 5. Following is always ensured:<br><br><br><br><br>
specified maximum number of flows that are to be admitted in the system corresponding to class J.<br>
StepD - (Flow) Admission Control:<br>
If a new flow h corresponding to class J appears in the system, it could be admitted   and   allocated   buffer   space   equal   to   buff _ min_ flow{h, J)    if<br>
num_flows(Jj) N^^ when flow<br>
h corresponding to class J arrives in the system, the new flow h could be admitted and allocated buffer space if buff _m\n_flow{k,J)<buff _unres_free></buff>
at time t. Here,<br>
buff _ unres _ free(t) = buff _ unresit) - buff _ unres _ used{i). Here, buff _unres_used{t), is the amount of buffer which is used by flows for which qdepth{k,Jj)&gt;buff _m\n__flow{k,J), and is given by<br>
num_flows{J,i)<br>
buff _ unres _ used{t) = ^      ^ max{qdepth{k, J, t) - buff __ min_ flow(k, /),0}.<br>
Once this flow h has been admitted in the system, its channel data rate A[h,.] is observed for some slots and buff_meix_flow(k,Jj) is computed using step B.<br>
Step E - Packet Admission:<br>
Now consider the flows which have already been admitted in the system. Suppose, N{kyJj) MAC packets of flow k of class J arrive in the system at time<br>
t. To decide maximum number of MAC packets, n(k,J,t), to be admitted at the<br>
access point, follow the process below.<br>
Let qdepth(k,J,r) be the queue depth of flow k belonging to class J at time r,<br>
where r is a time instant just before time t and no packet arrived in the system between time r and t and no packet left the system between time r and time t. If  qdepth(k,J,r)&gt;buff_mdLx_flowik,Jj ),  these   N(k,J,t)   packets are  not<br>
admitted in the access point and are stored at the upstream node only (like BSC in a 30 network). On the other hand, if qdepth(k,J,r)<buff_max_flow></buff_max_flow><br>
maximum of n{kjj) MAC packets are admitted to the access point which are<br>
computed as below:<br>
max n{k,J,tX<br>
0<n></n>
qdepth(k, J,t) = qdepth(k, J,r) + n{k, J,/) 
N(k, J, t) is a positive integer.<br>
Step F - Flow Control:<br>
1.	Consider an arbitrary time t and suppose that /^,,, is the last time before<br>
time t when maximum allowable buffer, buff _m^x_flow{k,J,tp^^^), was<br>
computed       for       flow       k.        If       it       is       found       that<br>
qdepth{k,J,t)&gt;buff _msiX_flow{k,J,tp^^^), then  buff_ma\_flow(k,Jj) iS<br>
recomputed at the time t. If it is still found that qdepth{k,Jj)&gt;buff _md^\_flow{k,J,t ), a flow control message is sent for<br>
this flow k from the access node (like the 3G-BTS or the WLAN-AP) to the upstream node (like the 3G-BSC in a 3G network or WLAN-aggregator in a WLAN network) and control of flow of packets for flow k to the access point is stopped until time t1 such that t\ = xmn{s:s&gt;t,qdepth{k,J,s)
2.	If at some time t_start, buff _unres_free{t _start)<a buff _ap apply></a>
flow control as described here until the earliest time t_end {&gt;t_start)<br>
when	buff _unres_free{t _end) &gt; a^ * buff _ap (i.e.	we	have<br>
buff __unres_free{t_end) 
interval {t_start,t_end)). Here, a, and a^ are pre-specified such that<br>
0 
{t_start,t_end). For flows belonging to class J=4 and 5, send flow control<br>
message for each flow k for which qdepth{k,Jj)&gt; buff _m\n_flow{k,J).<br><br>
This message is sent from the access point (like the 3G-BTS or the<br>
WLAN-AP) to the upstream node (like the 3G-BSC in a 3G network or<br>
WLAN-aggregator in a WLAN network). Upon receiving the flow control<br>
message for such a flow k, the upstream node (like 3G-BSC) regulates<br>
flow of packets to the access point for such flows for the time interval<br>
{t _ start, t _ end)	and	works	to	ensure	that<br>
qdepth{k,Jj)<buff _m for each flow k belonging to class></buff>
j=4 or J=5.<br>
3. Again, consider an arbitrary time instant t in the interval {t_start,t_end).<br>
For flows belonging to class J=1, 2 or 3, send flow control message for<br>
each	flow	k	for	which<br>
qdepth{k, J, /) &gt; max{^^ * buff _ max_ flow{k, J, t\ buff _ min_ flow(k, J)}.<br>
Here, ^^ 
and 3. This message is sent from the access point (like the 3G-BTS or the WI_AN-AP) to the upstream node (like the 3G-BSC in a 3G network or WLAN-aggregator in a WLAN network). Job of this flow control message is to regulate flow of packets to the access point for such flows for the time     interval     {t _startj _end)     and     work     to     ensure     that<br>
qdepth(k, J, 0 ^ max{^j * buff _ max_ flowik, J, t), buff _ min_ flow{k, J)}   for<br>
each flow k belonging to class J=1 or J=2 or J=3.<br>
Mechanism II: Dynamic Buffer Management, Flow Control and Admission Control<br>
The   dynamic   buffer   management,   flow   control   and   admission   control mechanisms invented here work as follows.<br>
Buffer Management:<br><br>
Let buff_ap be the maximum number of MAC packets that the access point can store for forward link flows. In the system described here, each flow is allocated a fixed amount of buffer initially. This depends upon class of the flow. Let buff_m\n{J) be the minimum number of MAC packets that can be stored at the access point for any fonward link flow for class J. Each flow belonging to the same class is assigned same amount of minimum buffer initially, i.e. buff _m\n_flow{k,J)^buff _m\n_flow(p,J% for each flow k and p belonging to<br>
the same class J. Here, buff _m\n_ flow(k, J) is the minimum amount of buffer allocated for flow k of class J, if such a flow is admitted in the system.<br>
For each flow k corresponding to class J, a parameter, buff _max{J), is also<br>
specified that gives the maximum number of MAC packets that are allowed to be stored for any flow k of class J. Each flow belonging to the same class is assigned same amount of maximum allowed buffer, i.e. buff _mdix__flow(k,J) = buff _msix_flowip,J), for each flow k and p belonging to<br>
the same class J. Here, buff _meix_flow{k,J) is the maximum amount of buffer<br>
reserved for flow k of class J, if such a flow is admitted in the system. Let qdepth{k,Jj)be the number of MAC packets stored at the access point for flow k<br>
at time t. In the system described here, it is ensured that<br>
buff _ min( J) 
In the system here, the network operator (i.e. the wireless service provider) is allowed to specify minimum number of flows corresponding to Class 1 to 4 which need to be supported at the access point. Let Nf^ be the minimum number of<br>
flows that are allowed corresponding to class J at the access point (for J=1, 2, 3, 4, 5). A counter is kept for each class that counts the number of flows which have been admitted for that class. Let mm_flows{Jj) be the number of flows<br>
corresponding to class J which are present in the system at time t.<br><br>
Available   buffer,    buff_avail{t\    at   time   t,    is   computed   as   follows: buff _ avail{t) = buff _ ap - ^ max{A'^'", «w/w _ fIows(J, 0} * buff _ min(y) - ^ ]^ max{qciepth(k, J, t) ~ buff _ min( J),0}<br>
J   k<br>
Reserved amount of buffer at time t is denoted by buff _res{t). At time 0, it is given as:  buff _res{G) = ^Nf'"*"buff _mm{J). At time t, it is computed as:<br>
buff _ resit) = ^ max{A^7", mm _ flows{J, t)} * buff _ min(J)<br>
For a flow k corresponding to class J, which has been admitted in the system, if there are sufficient packets in the system to occupy buff_m\n{J) at time t, then<br>
packets corresponding to this flow can be admitted at the access point upto the maximum limit of 6t#_max(J) as long as unreserved buffer space is available<br>
at the access point. Buffer space used by such flows, buffer_used_meix_m\n(i),<br>
at time t is computed as:<br>
buff _ used _ max_ min(0 = ^ ^ max{qdepth{k, J, t) - buff _ niin(J),0}<br>
In this system,<br>
^nff -^P~ ^Hff _ ^^^(0 + buff _ avail{() + buff _ used _ max_ min(/).<br>
This is shown in Figures 9 and 10,<br>
(Flow) Admission Control:<br>
Let reqrate{k,J) be the average required rate for flow k corresponding to class J. Let A[k,J,ri\be the rate indicated by the mobile station corresponding to flow k belonging to class J in the time slot n (considering a discrete time wireless<br>
system), and A(k,J,n) be its exponentially weighted moving average where<br>
1	,    1<br>
A(k,J,n) = —A[k,J,n] + (l—)A{k,J,n-\). Here, a time constant t^ is chosen<br><br>
such that 0
here it is quite possible that A{k\J\,ri) ^ A{k2,Jl,n) ^ A{MS^,ri). This is possible because a mobile user could start applications at different time instants at a<br>
mobile station. Here, A{MS^,n), is the average channel data rate indicated by the mobile station, MS^, by slot n, starting from the time mobile station MS, was<br>
activated in the network while A{kl,J\,n) is the average channel data rate<br>
indicated by the mobile station MS,, by slot n, but starting from the time when<br>
the application corresponding to flow k1 belonging to class J1 was activated by the mobile user corresponding to the mobile station MS,.<br>
Suppose a flow f, belonging to an arbitrary class J, arrives in the system at time t. If J=5, this flow is admitted in the system. If J=1 or 2 or 3 or 4, do as follows. Consider each flow which has been already admitted in the system and find out the total number of flows for which<br>
reqrate{KJ) &gt; ^(A:, J)* ^(^, J,/),V^,for J=1, 2, 3 and 4, at time t<br>
(i.e. when flow f corresponding to class J arrives and a decision has to be made whether or not to admit this flow f). Here, r{k,J), is a pre-specified priority<br>
constant for each flow k, for each class J (for J=1, 2, 3 and 4), which is a function of flow's traffic and QoS characteristics. It is a positive real-number, i.e.<br>
rik,J)eRLet mm_ flows _typeA{t) be the total number of such flows in the system at time t, i.e.<br>
mm _ flows __ typeAit) = X S ^{^^9^^^^^^ J) ^ 7(1^^ J) * Ak, J, 0) •<br>
J=l   k<br>
Here,<br>
U{reqrate{K J) ^ r{k, J) * A{k, J, 0) = I if reqrateik, J) ^ y{K J) * A{K J. t); Otherwise, U{reqrate{k, J) &gt; y{k, J) * A{k,Jj)) = 0.<br><br>
Let frac_ flows_typeA{t) be the fraction of such flows at time t, considering<br>
classes J=1, 2, 3 and 4. Thus,<br>
num _ flows _ typeA{t)<br>
firac _ flows _ typeA(t) =<br>
^ num _ flows (J, t)<br>
j=i<br><br>
In the system here, a threshold, fi-ac^flows_typeA_thres, is pre-specified. Here, fi-ac^ flows _typeA_thres is a positive real-constant and ft'ac _ flows _ type A _ thres 
■mm<br>
To decide whether or not to admit flow f belonging to class J (for J=1, 2, 3 or 4) at time t, do as follows. Admit this flow f if num_flows(J,t) 
Otherwise, if num_flows{J,t) &gt; Nf"", admit this flow if<br>
buff _ min(J) 
fi^ac _ flows _ typeA(t) 
Othenvise, this flow f is not admitted. If this flow f corresponding to class J is admitted in the system, the state variables are updated as follows: num_flows(J,t) = num_flows{J,t) + \\ and buff_avail(t) is recomputed.<br>
Packet Admission:<br>
Now consider a flow k belonging to class J which has been already admitted in the system. Suppose N(k,J,t) MAC packets of flow k of class J arrive in the<br>
system at time t. Let qdepthik.Jj") be the queue depth of flow k belonging to<br>
class J at time /', where /" is a time instant just before time t and no packet arrived in the system between time /" and t. If qdepthik,Jj~)&gt;buff_meoi(J), these Nik, J J) packets are not admitted in the access point and are stored at the upstream node only (like BSC in a 3G network). On the other hand, if qdepthik,J,t')<buff_maxij maximum of nik mac packets are admitted to the access point which computed as below:></buff_maxij><br>
maximum n(k,J,t), Q<n></n>
qdepth{k, J, t) = qdepth{k, Jj~) + n{k, J, t) 
n{k, J, t) 
n{k, y, t) is a non - negative integer and<br>
N(k, J, t) is a positive integer.<br>
Once these n(k,J,t) MAC packets are admitted, buff_res(t) and buff_avail(t) are also   recomputed. Remaining packets, i.e. max//www{A^(A:,y,/)-w(A:,J,/),0}, are<br>
stored at the upstream node (i.e. at the 3G-BSC in a 3G network, or at WLAN aggregator in a WLAN network).<br>
Flow Control:<br>
Dynamic flow control in the system described here works as follows. Let mm _ flows _ thres{J)   be   a   pre-specified   threshold   on   number   of   flows<br>
corresponding to class J for J=1, 2 and 3. Here, num_ flows__thres(J) is a non-negative integer value.<br>
If at some time t_start, buff _ovail{t _start) t_start) when buff _avail{t_end) &gt; //^ *buff _ap (i.e. we have buff _avail(t_end) 
1. Send flow control message to each flow belonging to Class J=4 and 5 at the upstream node (i.e. 3G-BSC for 3G network and WLAN-aggregator for WLAN network). Suppose, k is an arbitrary flow corresponding to class J (with J=4 or 5) to which such a flow control message has been sent. This flow control message first freezes (maximum) queue length of each flow k that has received such a message, to maximum{qdepth{k,Jj_start),buff_m\n{J)}.  Packets are allowed to be<br>
drained out of this queue via the access point scheduler (towards mobile<br><br>
stations) but packets are not allowed to this queue from the upstream node (3G-BSC in a 3G network or WLAN-aggregator in a WLAN network) until queue length of this flow k reaches a value which is equal or less than its buff _m\r\_flow{k,J).<br>
2.	Once queue depth of flow k reaches a value smaller than or equal to<br>
buff _m\n_flow{k,J),	say	at	time<br>
t{k\ v^\\txtt{k)\%%\xd^\h2Xt_start<t access point can request></t>
packets for this queue from the upstream node (3G-BSC in a 3G network or WLAN-aggregator in a WLAN network). But its maximum queue depth is not allowed to go above buff_m\n_flow{k,J)6\}mQ the remaining<br>
period of the interval {t{k\t_end).<br>
3.	For each flow corresponding to class J=1 or 2 or 3, flow control works to<br>
maintain queue depth less than 6wjf_max(J). Specifically, if there is<br>
space for some packets in its queues (corresponding to flows belonging to class J=1, 2 or 3), it informs the upstream node about its queue length status. Also, once the time, t_end, is reached, flow control for all other classes (i.e. for J=4 or 5) allows queue depth to become higher than buff _vcvm{J) but keeps it upper bounded by few#_max(J).<br>

If delay bound or delay jitter is violated for more than x(k,J) percent of the IP packets of a flow (corresponding to class J=1, 2 or 3), it is considered that its QoS requirements have been violated.
