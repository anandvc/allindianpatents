				<td>A MICROPOROUS CRYSTALLINE MATERIAL OF ZEOLITIC NATURE<br>
AND A METHOD OF SYNTHESISING A MICROPOROUS<br>
CRYSTALLINE MATERIAL<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention belongs to the technical field of<br>
microporous crystalline materials of zeolitic nature,<br>
useful as catalysts or components of catalysts for<br>
separation and transformation processes of organic<br>
compounds.<br>
STATE OF THE ART PRIOR TO THE INVENTION<br>
Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials<br>
formed from a crystal lattice of TO4 tetrahedra which<br>
share all their vertices giving rise to a three-<br>
dimensional structure containing channels and/or cavities<br>
of molecular dimensions. Their composition is variable<br>
and T in general represents atoms with formal oxidation<br>
state +3 or +4, such as for example Si, Ge, Ti, Al, B,<br>
Ga, and so on. When any of the T atoms has an oxidation<br>
state less than + 4, the crystal lattice formed displays<br>
negative charges which are compensated by means of the<br>
presence of organic or inorganic cations in the channels<br>
or cavities. Organic molecules and H2O can also be housed<br>
in those channels and cavities so, in a general manner,<br>
the chemical composition of the zeolites can be<br>
represented by means of the following empirical formula:<br><br><br>
wherein M is one or several organic or inorganic cations<br>
of charge +n; X is one or several trivalent elements; Y<br>
is one or several tetravalent elements, generally Si; and<br>
R is one or several organic substances. Although by means<br>
of post-synthesis treatment the nature of M, X, Y and R<br>
and the values of x, y, z and w can be varied, the<br>
chemical composition of a zeolite (as synthesised or<br>
following its calcination) possesses a range<br>
characteristic of each zeolite and of its method of<br>
preparation.<br>
The crystalline structure of each zeolite, with a<br>
specific system of channels and cavities, gives rise to a<br>
characteristic X-ray diffraction pattern, which enables<br>
them to be differentiated from each other.<br>
Many zeolites have been synthesised in the presence<br>
of an organic molecule which acts as a structure<br>
directing agent. The organic molecules which act as<br>
structure directing agents (SDA) generally contain<br>
nitrogen in their composition and can give rise to stable<br>
organic cations in the reaction medium.<br>
The mobilisation of precursor species during the<br>
synthesis of zeolites can be carried out in the presence<br>
of OH- groups and basic medium, which can be introduced<br>
as the hydroxide of the SDA itself, such as for example<br>
tetrapropylammonium hydroxide in the case of zeolite ZSM-<br>
5. Fluoride ions can also act as mobilising agents in the<br>
synthesis of zeolites, for example patent EP-A-337479<br>
describes the use of HF in H2O at low pH as a mobilising<br>
agent of silica for the synthesis of zeolite ZSM-5.<br>
Nevertheless, the use of fluoride ions in the synthesis<br>
is less desirable from the industrial point of view than<br><br>
the use of OH-, given that the presence of fluoride ions<br>
requires the use of special materials in the synthesis<br>
equipment as well as specific treatment of the waste<br>
waters and gases.<br>
Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), or its variant deep<br>
catalytic cracking (DCC), together with steam cracking,<br>
are the units which most contribute to the production of<br>
C3-C5 olefins. Moreover, FCC contributes approximately<br>
30% of the gasoline stream in the refinery. The<br>
production of propylene in the FCC can be incremented by<br>
modifying the operating conditions of the unit, such as<br>
increasing the temperature of the reactor, for example.<br>
Nevertheless, this solution entails a considerable<br>
increase in gases and especially in undesired dry gas.<br>
Better results are obtained using new compositions of<br>
catalysts involving the use of zeolite mixtures. The use<br>
of zeolite ZSM-5 as additive in FCC catalysts also leads<br>
to an increase in C3 and C4 olefins (see for example<br>
patents US-3758403, US-3769202; US-3894931; US-3894933;<br>
US-3894934; US-3926782; US-4309280; US-4309279; and US-<br>
437458 and Buchanan, J.S. and Adewuyi, Y-G., Applied<br>
Catalysis: A General, 134, 247 (1996); Madon, R.J.,<br>
Journal of Catalysis 129 (1), 275 (1991). Nevertheless,<br>
it is known {Studies in Surface Science and Catalysis,<br>
vol. 16, 499 (1993)) that the introduction of zeolite<br>
ZSM-5 produces a decrease in dry gas, and an increase in<br>
the proportion of aromatics in the gasoline. This is<br>
particularly important from the point of view both of<br>
producing an increase in the yield of C3-C5 olefins, and<br>
especially propylene, and of obtaining a high yield of<br>
high octane/barrel gasoline with a low aromatics content,<br><br>
finding other alternative zeolites to zeolite ZSM-5<br>
which, acting as an additive of zeolite faujasite Y,<br>
would provide light olefins with minimum loss of<br>
gasoline. Numerous zeolites have been studied in this<br>
direction such as zeolite MCM-22, Omega, L, mordenite BEA<br>
and ITQ-7 (see for example: J. Catal. 165, 102 (1997);<br>
Stud. Surf. Sci. and Catal. 46, 115 (1989); the patents:<br>
US-5314612; EP-489324; US-474292; US-4137152; EP-350331;<br>
FR-2661621; WO-0170905).<br>
Nevertheless, the need persists to improve known<br>
procedures by means of using new catalysts with better<br>
performance in cracking.<br>
With regard to the use of zeolites as catalysts in<br>
alkylation processes of aromatics, cumene is of<br>
particular interest as a raw material for the production<br>
of phenol and acetone. Numerous works have been developed<br>
using acid catalysts. A general reference on catalysts<br>
and processes used can be found in: "Encyclopedia of<br>
Chemical Processing and Design", J.J. McKezta and W.A.<br>
Cunningham Editors, V.14, pp. 33-55 (1982). The<br>
alkylation process of benzene with propylene, as well as<br>
seeking a high conversion of propylene and a high<br>
selectivity to the monoalkylated product isopropylbenzene<br>
(cumene), also requires minimising the quantity of n-<br>
propyl benzene (NPB) formed. Given that it is difficult<br>
to separate cumene and NPB by conventional methods, such<br>
as by distillation, it can be understood that the yield<br>
of NPB has to be as low as possible and in all cases very<br>
low, during the alkylation of benzene with propylene.<br>
Zeolites have been used as catalysts for the<br>
alkylation of aromatics and so, for example, patent US-<br><br>
429457 describes zeolite ZSM-5 as a catalyst for<br>
alkylation of benzene with propylene.<br>
Nevertheless, due probably to the small diameter of<br>
its channels, this zeolite displays low selectivity for<br>
the desired process. There also exist numerous patents<br>
which describe the use of Faujasite and modified<br>
Faujasites as catalysts for the production of cumene by<br>
alkylation of benzene with propylene. Zeolite Y can be<br>
used as a catalyst but it is necessary to work with high<br>
benzene/propylene ratios in the feed. This leads to high<br>
costs in the recycling of benzene. Zeolite Beta has also<br>
been claimed as a catalyst for alkylation of benzene with<br>
propylene in various patents such as for example: US-<br>
4891458, US-5030786, EP-432814, EP-439632; EP-629599.<br>
This zeolite produces good results in activity and<br>
selectivity, but its behaviour could be better both with<br>
regard to selectivity towards NPB and as far as the<br>
stability of the catalyst is concerned. The use of a new<br>
zeolite (MCM-22) has recently been claimed.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
material of a nature that can advantageously be applied<br>
in processes of separation and transformation of organic<br>
compounds, and more particularly its use as an active<br>
zeolitic compound for the cracking of organic compounds<br>
and more specifically hydrocarbon fractions derived from<br>
natural or synthetic petroleums, as well as in the<br>
alkylation process of aromatics.<br>
The pore topology of this new zeolite confers on it<br>
properties for acting as an additive of zeolite faujasite<br>
Y in catalysts for fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units,<br>
providing high yields of light olefins with a high<br><br>
octane-barrel number of the gasoline produced, as well as<br>
reduction in the content of aromatics in the gasoline in<br>
comparison with the base catalyst.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention achieves the objectives<br>
defined above by means of a microporous crystalline<br>
material of zeolitic nature, also identified as "ITQ-22"<br>
or "zeolite ITQ-22", its method of preparation in the<br>
absence of fluoride ions and its applications. This<br>
material, in both its calcined form and synthesised<br>
uncalcined, has an X-ray diffraction pattern that is<br>
different from that of other known zeolitic materials and<br>
which is therefore characteristic of this material.<br>
The X-ray diffraction pattern of the material ITQ-<br>
22, as synthesised, has been obtained by the powder<br>
method employing a fixed divergence slit and using Ka<br>
radiation from Cu. This pattern is characterised by the<br>
values of angle 2θ (degrees) and relative intensities<br>
(I/I0) of the most intense reflections which are shown in<br>
Table I, with I0 being the intensity of the most intense<br>
peak which is assigned a value of 100. The relative<br>
intensities have been expressed in the following terms: m<br>
= medium intensity (between 20 and 40%); s = strong<br>
intensity (between 40 and 60%) and vs = very strong<br>
intensity (between 60 and 100%).<br><br><br><br>
Once calcined and in the anhydrous state, the<br>
material accords with the general formula<br>
x (H X 02) : y YO2 z GeO2 (1 - z) SiO2<br>
wherein "x" possesses a value less than 0.2, preferably<br>
less than 0.1 and can take the value zero; "y" has a<br>
value less than 0.1, preferably less than 0.05 and can<br>
take the value zero; "z" possesses a value less than 0.8,<br>
preferably between 0.005 and 0.5 and can take the value<br>
zero; X is one or several chemical elements of oxidation<br>
state +3 (Al, Ga, B, Fe, Cr) and Y is one or several<br>
chemical elements with oxidation state +4 other than Si<br>
and Ge (Ti, Sn, V) .<br>
Nevertheless, depending on the synthesis method and<br>
on the calcination or later treatments, it is possible<br>
for defects to exist in the crystal lattice, which are<br>
manifested by the presence of Si-OH (silanol) groups.<br>
These defects have not been included in the above<br>
empirical formula.<br>
Table II shows the values of angle 29 (degrees) and<br>
relative intensities (I/I0) of the most intense<br>
reflections of the powder X-ray diffractogram zeolite<br><br>
ITQ-22 after being calcined in order to eliminate organic<br>
compounds occluded in its interior, where m, s, and vs<br>
have the same meanings as in Table I.<br><br>
The positions, widths and relative intensities of<br>
the peaks depends to a certain degree on the chemical<br>
composition of the material, as well as on the degree of<br>
hydration and crystal size. In particular, when the<br>
lattice is composed solely of silicon and germanium<br>
oxides, with a ratio Si/Ge = 3.8 and it has been<br>
synthesised using the quaternary ammonium cation 1,5-bis<br>
(methylpyrrolidinium) pentane as structure directing<br>
agent, the material as synthesised displays an X-ray<br>
diffraction pattern like that shown in Figure I. This<br>
diagram is characterised by the values of angle 29<br>
(degrees) and relative intensities (I/I0) that are shown<br>
in Table III. The relative intensities have been<br>
expressed in the following terms: w = weak intensity<br>
(between 0 and 20%); m = medium intensity (between 20 and<br><br>
40%); s = strong intensity (between 40 and 60%) and vs =<br>
very strong intensity (between 60 and 100%).<br><br><br><br>
The X-ray diffraction pattern of the above sample of<br>
ITQ-22, after being calcined at 580°C in order to<br>
eliminate organic compounds occluded in its interior, is<br>
shown in Figure 2. This diffractogram is characterised by<br>
the values of angle 29 (degrees) and relative intensities<br>
(I/I0) that are shown in Table IV, where w, m, s and vs<br>
have the same meanings as in Table III. The comparison of<br>
the X-ray diffractograms corresponding to zeolite ITQ-22<br>
as synthesised and in the calcined state demonstrate the<br>
thermal stability of the material.<br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention also refers to the preparation<br>
method of ITQ-22. This is carried out in basic medium, in<br>
the absence of fluoride ions and comprises heat treatment<br>
at a temperature between 80 and 200°C, preferably between<br>
130 and 200°C, of a reaction mixture containing a source<br>
of SiO2 (such as for example tetraethylorthosilicate,<br>
colloidal silica, amorphous silica), optionally a source<br>
of GeO2, 1,5-bis (methylpyrrolidinium) pentane, and<br>
water. The organic cation 1,5-bis (methylpyrrolidinium)<br>
pentane is added to the reaction mixture in the form of<br>
salt (for example, a halide, preferably, chloride or<br>
bromide) or hydroxide.<br>
Optionally, it is possible to add a source of<br>
tetravalent element or elements Y other than Si and Ge,<br>
preferably Ti, V, Sn and/or trivalent elements X,<br>
preferably Al, B, Ga, Fe, Cr The addition of this element<br>
or elements can be done prior to heating of the reaction<br>
mixture or in an intermediate moment during that heating.<br>
It can occasionally be convenient to also add crystals of<br>
ITQ-22 (between 0.01 and 20% by weight with respect to<br>
the inorganic oxides taken as a whole, preferably between<br>
0.05 and 10% by weight) as promoters of the<br>
crystallisation (sowing) at some stage of the<br>
preparation. The composition of the reaction mixture<br>
accords with the general empirical formula:<br><br>
wherein X is one or several trivalent elements,<br>
preferably Al, B, Ga, Fe, Cr; Y is one or several<br>
tetravalent elements other than Si and Ge, preferably Ti,<br>
Sn, V; R is 1,5-bis (methylpyrrolidinium) pentane; and<br>
the values of r, t, u, v and w vary in the ranges<br><br>
r = ROH/SiO2 = 0.01-1.0, preferably 0.1-1.0<br>
t = X2O3/SiO2 = 0-0.1, preferably 0-0.05<br>
u = YO2/SiO2 = 0-0.1, preferably 0-0.05<br>
v = GeO2/SiO2 = 0-4, preferably 0.005-1<br>
w = H2O/SiO2 = 1-50<br>
The heat treatment of the reaction mixture can be<br>
done statically or with stirring of the mixture. Once the<br>
crystallisation is complete, the solid product is<br>
separated by filtration or centrifugation and dried. The<br>
later calcination at temperatures above 350°C, preferably<br>
between 400 and 900°C, produces the decomposition of<br>
organic remains occluded in the interior of the zeolite<br>
and their exit, leaving the zeolitic channels free. The<br>
calcination can be done in the presence of N2 followed by<br>
calcination in air, or direct calcination in air can be<br>
carried out, or an extraction of the organic matter with<br>
mineral or organic acids can be performed, or the organic<br>
material can be eliminated by treatment with ozone.<br>
After having been calcined, the material is<br>
pelletised. The means by which the catalyst is pelletised<br>
are well known in the literature, using a diluent such as<br>
for example SiO2 or Al203 or a clay, zirconium, magnesium<br>
oxide or mixture thereof, in proportions of<br>
zeolite/diluent of between 20 and 95%, preferably between<br>
40 and 90% by weight.<br><br>
In an alternative embodiment, the calcined catalyst<br>
can be treated with an aqueous solution of a mineral acid<br>
such as for example HNO3, H2SO4, H3PO4, HClO4.<br>
By means of treatment of that aqueous solution of<br>
mineral acid, a pH of between 0 and 1.5 is reached, at<br>
temperatures between 20 and 100°C in a time period<br>
between 10 and 400 minutes, depending on the<br>
concentrations of acid and the treatment temperature. The<br>
ratio of catalyst to aqueous solution of acid lies<br>
between 0.05 and 1, and preferably between 0.1 and 0.5 by<br>
weight.<br>
The resulting material, whether or not treated with<br>
acid, but containing acid centres in its structure, once<br>
it has been calcined at a temperature between 450 and<br>
700°C, is used as a catalyst.<br>
The ITQ-22 material can be used in the following<br>
applications:<br>
As an additive of catalytic cracking catalysts for<br>
hydrocarbons, and for organic compounds in general.<br>
As a component of hydrocracking and gentle hydrocracking<br>
catalysts.<br>
As a component or additive of isomerisation catalysts for<br>
light paraffins.<br>
As a component of deparaffining and isodeparaffining<br>
catalysts.<br>
As an alkylation catalyst of isoparaffins with olefins<br>
and alkylation of aromatics and aromatics substituted<br><br>
with olefins, alcohols or polyalkylated aromatics, and<br>
more specifically as a catalyst for the alkylation of<br>
benzene with propylene.<br>
As a catalyst in acylation reactions, preferably in<br>
acylation reactions of substituted aromatic compounds<br>
using acids, acid chlorides or anhydrides of organic<br>
acids as acylating agents.<br>
As catalysts in oxidation reactions, preferably of the<br>
Meerwein-Pondorf-Verley type.<br>
An especially preferred use is as an additive of<br>
catalytic cracking catalysts for hydrocarbons, and for<br>
organic compounds in general. Zeolite ITQ-22 has a three-<br>
dimensional topology with a system of pores and<br>
dimensions different from any other zeolite used so far<br>
in FCC catalysts. This zeolite contains pores formed by<br>
of 8, 10 and 12 membered rings connected, and it is<br>
precisely this topology which gives rise to a specific<br>
behaviour in cracking catalysts.<br>
In its use as a cracking catalyst, the zeolitic material<br>
ITQ-22 can be the only zeolitic component of the catalyst<br>
embedded in a matrix, or it can be accompanied by at<br>
least one second zeolitic component, both embedded in a<br>
matrix.<br>
When ITQ-22 is accompanied by another zeolitic component<br>
or components, said second zeolitic component can be<br>
formed of zeolitic structures selected among zeolitic<br>
structures containing pores delimited by rings of 14<br>
members, such as for example SSZ-24, CIT-5, UTD-1;<br>
zeolitic structures containing pores delimited by rings<br>
of 12 members, such as for example zeolite Beta, ITQ-7,<br>
zeolite faujasite Y, SSZ-33; zeolitic structures<br><br>
containing pores delimited by rings of 11 members, such<br>
as for example NU-86; zeolitic structures containing<br>
pores delimited by rings of 10 members, such as for<br>
example ITQ-13, ZSM-5, SAPO-11, MCM-22, and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
Moreover, for the cracking process the catalyst can<br>
consist partially or wholly of a single type of particle<br>
with the material ITQ-22 and the said at least second<br>
component being present in the catalyst in the same<br>
particle, embedded in a matrix. Said particle preferably<br>
comprises at least two zeolitic components which are ITQ-<br>
22 and zeolite faujasite Y in one or more of its variants<br>
selected from the group formed from zeolite faujasite Y,<br>
ultrastable zeolite faujasite Y, zeolite faujasite Y<br>
fully exchanged with rare earths, zeolite faujasite Y<br>
partially exchanged with rare earths, ultrastable zeolite<br>
faujasite Y fully exchanged with rare earths, ultrastable<br>
zeolite faujasite Y partially exchanged with rare earths<br>
and mixtures thereof. Preferably, said second zeolitic<br>
component of the type faujasite Y is present in<br>
quantities between 0.1 and 99.9% by weight with respect<br>
to the total weight of zeolitic components, with the<br>
weight of zeolite ITQ-22 being between 0.1 and 60% by<br>
weight with respect to the total weight of zeolitic<br>
components. The rest of the catalyst composition is<br>
formed by the matrix containing components well known in<br>
the art, such as kaolin, alumina and silica, being able<br>
to also contain P2O5.<br>
When zeolite ITQ-22 is used in cracking together<br>
with at least one other zeolitic component and wherein<br>
the zeolitic components are embedded in the same<br><br>
particle, at least some of the particles of the catalytic<br>
cracking catalyst preferably comprise:<br>
-	0.1-40% by weight of the zeolitic material ITQ-22 with<br>
respect to the total weight of zeolitic components<br>
-	0.1-99.9% by weight of the zeolite faujasite Y with<br>
respect to the total weight of zeolitic components.<br>
In its use in cracking processes, zeolite ITQ-22 can<br>
form part of a catalyst partially or wholly constructed<br>
of at least two types of particle in which the zeolitic<br>
material ITQ-22 and said at least one second zeolitic<br>
material are embedded in a matrix, the zeolitic material<br>
ITQ-22 and said second zeolitic component being present<br>
in different particles, the catalyst being a physical<br>
mixture of particles of different nature. So, in this<br>
case, each zeolite would be incorporated separately into<br>
a matrix. The final mixture of the catalyst would be<br>
formed by a mixture of at least two types of particle,<br>
with each type of particle incorporating a different<br>
zeolitic component. The final mixture would preferably be<br>
formed by a type of particle that includes ITQ-22 in a<br>
matrix, and by a second type of particle that includes<br>
zeolite faujasite Y in any of the different forms of<br>
faujasite Y, embedded in a second matrix. An FCC catalyst<br>
would be formed by this type of said mixture of<br>
particles; particles with ITQ-22 and particles with<br>
zeolite faujasite Y in any of its two forms.<br>
When zeolite ITQ-22 is used in a cracking process<br>
with another zeolitic component or components, with the<br>
zeolitic components being embedded in different types of<br>
particle, the catalytic cracking catalyst preferably<br>
comprises:<br><br>
- 0.1-40% by weight of particles containing zeolite ITQ-<br>
22 with respect to the sum of zeolitic components, in<br>
which each particle comprises 10-70% by weight of zeolite<br>
ITQ-22;<br>
0.1-99.9% by weight of particles containing a<br>
conventional catalytic cracking catalyst based on<br>
faujasite type zeolite, in which the percentages are<br>
indicated on the sum of zeolitic components.<br>
In the case that the catalyst for use in cracking<br>
comprises ITQ-22 and another zeolitic component or<br>
components, contained in particles of different type,<br>
said catalyst can have a composition in which there<br>
exists at least a third type of particle, in which a<br>
third zeolite would be included in a matrix. This third<br>
zeolite is preferably ZSM-5.<br>
Of course, and as is known in the art, a final<br>
catalyst could also contain other particles with the aim<br>
of, for example, and without being limiting, improving<br>
fluidisation, trapping contaminants (such as for example<br>
metals, nitrogen, Na+) , converting beds, trapping SOx. In<br>
particular, an FCC catalyst could contain these types of<br>
additional particles mentioned.<br>
In the catalytic cracking catalyst described which<br>
contains ITQ-22, zeolite faujasite Y and ZSM-5, a<br>
physical mixture of separate particles is preferred in<br>
which the zeolitic components are to be found in the<br>
following proportions: Zeolite faujasite Y at no less<br>
than 20% by weight with respect to the total weight of<br>
zeolitic components; zeolite ITQ-22 + ZSM-5 at a maximum<br>
of 80% by weight, the ratio by weight between zeolite<br>
ZSM-5 and zeolite ITQ-22 lying between 10 and 0.<br><br>
When the catalyst contains zeolite ITQ-22 and at<br>
least two other zeolitic components, contained in<br>
particles of different type, the third component is<br>
preferably zeolite ZSM-5.<br>
For its use in cracking, the catalyst can comprise<br>
more than three types of different particles, in<br>
particular FCC catalysts which can also contain other<br>
particles for improving fluidisation, etc.<br>
The catalyst particles include components that are<br>
not active in the catalytic process though they are<br>
necessary in order to conform them, such as binders<br>
and/or conventional additives such as clays, among<br>
others.<br>
The zeolitic components can include one or more TIV<br>
elements, such as for example Si and also other TIII<br>
element or elements, preferably selected from the group<br>
made up of Al, Fe, Ge, Ga, Zn, Ti, B and mixtures<br>
thereof. It can also include phosphorus. Likewise, they<br>
can be exchanged with divalent and/or trivalent ions or<br>
with rare earths. Also optionally, they can contain<br>
compounds of vanadium, and optionally cerium, added in a<br>
stage subsequent to the synthesis of the zeolite.<br>
Both when the zeolitic components are to be found in the<br>
same particle and when the zeolitic components are to be<br>
found in separate particles, zeolite faujasite Y can be<br>
added to the cracking catalyst in various forms, such as<br>
zeolite HY, ultrastable zeolite faujasite Y (USY),<br>
zeolite faujasite Y totally exchanged with rare earths<br>
(REY) or with rare earths and H+ (HREY), zeolite USY<br>
partially exchanged with rare earths (REUSY), or zeolite<br>
type Y exchanged with rare earths and calcined (CREY).<br><br>
When a catalytic cracking catalyst comprises ITQ-22 with<br>
at least two other zeolitic components in separate<br>
particles, each type of catalyst particle can comprise<br>
one or more or the zeolitic components.<br>
Both in the case of the catalyst containing ITQ-22 as the<br>
sole zeolitic component and in the case of its containing<br>
another zeolitic component or components, in order to<br>
form the catalyst particles a matrix is used containing<br>
at least one binder such as silica, alumina, silica-<br>
alumina, P2O5 and mixtures thereof. The final particles<br>
of catalyst can also contain conventional additives for<br>
catalytic cracking such as clays.<br>
In particular, in FCC catalysts, the catalyst can<br>
contain any conventional material, such as for example<br>
kaolin, in order to conform catalysts with various sizes<br>
of particle. When an FCC catalyst is prepared, a<br>
suspension can be made and atomised in order to form the<br>
particles of the catalyst. In the case of FCC units,<br>
particles of between 60 and 200 micrometres are<br>
preferred.<br>
The different zeolitic components of the zeolitic<br>
material ITQ-22 which form part of a catalyst for use in<br>
cracking can include one or more TIV elements, such as<br>
for example Si and Ge and also include at least one TIII<br>
element. Said TIII element is preferably selected from the<br>
group made up of Al, Fe, Ge, Ga, Zn, Ti, B and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
In the case of catalytic cracking in FCC units,<br>
zeolite ITQ-22 can be modified by means of the addition<br>
of phosphorus. In its initial composition, the molar<br>
ratio between TIV and TIII lies between 8 and 10000 and<br><br>
preferably between 20 and 1000. The cracking catalyst can<br>
also contain one or more alkaline metals. In no case may<br>
the quantity of alkaline metal, if there is any, exceed<br>
0.25% by weight of Na2O.<br>
The zeolitic components that can form part of the<br>
cracking catalyst, including the zeolitic material ITQ-<br>
22, as has been stated earlier, can contain phosphorus.<br>
The quantity of phosphorus present preferably lies<br>
between 0 and 8% by weight with respect to zeolite ITQ-<br>
22. The phosphorus can be incorporated by impregnation in<br>
a, for example aqueous, solution of at least one acid or<br>
salt chosen from the group consisting of H3PO4, (NH4)3PO4,<br>
(NH4)2HPO4, (NH4)H2PO4. The product obtained is calcined at<br>
a temperature between 350 and 700 °C.<br>
The zeolitic components that can form part of the<br>
cracking catalyst, including the zeolitic material ITQ-<br>
22, can be exchanged with divalent and/or trivalent ions<br>
or they can be exchanged wholly or partially with rare<br>
earths.<br>
For use in cracking, the catalyst can contain compounds<br>
of vanadium and optionally cerium added in a stage<br>
subsequent to the synthesis of zeolite ITQ-22.<br>
For use in cracking the catalyst particles can have<br>
a size between 20 and 400 micrometres. In a preferred<br>
embodiment the catalyst is formed from particles with a<br>
size between 60 and 200 micrometres.<br>
The zeolite ITQ-22 can be used in an FCC cracking<br>
process and in deep catalytic cracking (DCC), a process<br>
which consists of placing the feed in contact with the<br>
catalyst in a reactor for a length of time between 0.1<br>
and 80 s and recovering the resulting product.<br><br>
By means of using zeolite ITQ-22, gasoline is<br>
obtained with a lower content of aromatics, with a higher<br>
content of olefins and isoparaffins, less dry gas, higher<br>
octane-barrel number and a greater propylene/propane<br>
ratio than when a catalyst that does not contain ITQ-22<br>
is used.<br>
An especially preferred additional use for zeolite<br>
ITQ-22 is as a catalyst in an alkylation reaction. In<br>
said alkylation reaction, a suitable quantity of the<br>
catalyst is used along with an alkylating agent selected<br>
among olefins, alcohols, polyalkylated aromatic compounds<br>
and mixtures thereof in the alkylation of aromatic<br>
compounds.<br>
Said alkylation reaction is preferably conducted<br>
with a molar ratio of alkylating agent to starting<br>
aromatic compound of between 2 and 20, in the presence of<br>
the catalyst.<br>
When the alkylating agent is selected among an<br>
olefin, alcohol and mixtures thereof, said olefin and<br>
said alcohol preferably contain from between 2 to 20<br>
carbon atoms.<br>
In a preferred manner, the starting aromatic<br>
compound is selected among a group formed of benzene,<br>
naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene and substituted<br>
derivatives thereof, and still more preferably, the<br>
starting aromatic compound is benzene.<br>
The starting aromatic compound can also be selected among<br>
alkylbenezene, alkylanthracene, alkylphenanthrene,<br>
hydroxybenzene, hydroxynaphthalene, hydroxyanthracene,<br>
hydroxyphenanthrene, alcoxybenzene, alcoxynaphthalene,<br>
alcoxyanthracene and alcoxyphenanthrene.<br><br>
The alkylating agent is preferably a polyalkylated<br>
aromatic compound and the starting aromatic compound is a<br>
non-alkylated aromatic compound, so that during the<br>
alkylation at least one alkyl group is transferred from<br>
the polyalkylated aromatic compound to the starting<br>
aromatic compound.<br>
When the alkylating agent is a polyalkylated<br>
aromatic compound, the alkyl group or the alkyl groups of<br>
said polylalkylating agent can contain a variable number<br>
of carbon atoms. In a preferred way, said alkyl group or<br>
groups can contain from 2 up to 20 carbon atoms,<br>
preferably from 6 to 20 carbons atoms.<br>
When the alkylating agent is a polyalkylated<br>
aromatic compound and the starting aromatic compound is a<br>
non-alkylated aromatic compound, said starting aromatic<br>
compound is preferably selected among benzene,<br>
naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, substituted<br>
benzene, substituted naphthalene, substituted anthracene<br>
and substituted phenanthrene.<br>
The alkylating agent is preferably a polyalkylated<br>
aromatic agent and the starting aromatic compound is<br>
benzene. Still more preferably, said polyalkylated<br>
aromatic compound is polyisopropylbenzene and the<br>
starting aromatic compound is benzene, so that the<br>
alkylation of benzene with propylene produces cumene.<br>
A preferred use of ITQ-22 therefore refers to the<br>
alkylation of benzene with an alkylating agent selected<br>
among propylene, ethylene, ethyl alcohol, propyl alcohol<br>
and mixtures thereof.<br>
According to the use of zeolite ITQ-22 in<br>
alkylation, the alkylation reaction is conducted at a<br><br>
reaction temperature of between 60 and 350°C, and<br>
preferably between 80 and 300°C.<br>
The alkylation reaction is conducted at sufficient<br>
pressure for maintaining a liquid phase, at least<br>
partially, preferably in a range between 1.4 and 7.0 MPa,<br>
and more preferably between 1.4 and 4.1 MPa.<br>
In the alkylation reaction, the spatial velocity<br>
(WHSV) of reagents lies between 0.2 and 150 hours-1 and<br>
preferably between 0.5 and 10 hours"1.<br>
The alkylation reaction of benzene with propylene is<br>
preferably conducted under the following conditions:<br>
reaction temperature lying between 60 and 350°C, and<br>
preferably between 80 and 300°C; the pressure at which it<br>
is carried out is also sufficient for maintaining a<br>
liquid phase, at least partially, preferably being in a<br>
range between 1.4 and 7.0 MPa, and more preferably<br>
between 1.4 and 4.1 MPa; the spatial velocity (WHSV) of<br>
reagents lies between 0.2 and 150 hours-1 and preferably<br>
between 0.5 and 10 hours-1 and the benzene/propylene<br>
molar ratio is between 2 and 20, and preferably 2<br>
and 15.<br>
When ITQ-22 is applied in its acid form in the<br>
alkylation of aromatics with olefins or alcohols, and<br>
more specifically when it is used as a catalyst in the<br>
alkylation of benzene with propylene it turns out to be a<br>
highly active catalyst, and with a surprisingly low<br>
selectivity for the production of NPB. Moreover, the<br>
selectivity to cumene can be increased by introducing<br>
suitable quantities of alkaline or alkaline earth metals<br>
or metallic cations by means of ion exchange in the<br>
material. Its selectivity can also be increased by<br><br>
eliminating surface acidity by means of extraction of<br>
trivalent cations from the lattice, such as for example<br>
Al and/or B, by means of treatment with mineral acids or<br>
other chemical agents capable of extracting those<br>
elements. The cationic exchange treatments or leaching<br>
stated above permit a reduction in the formation of<br>
polyalkylated products.<br>
When the ITQ-22 material contains Ti, it is especially<br>
useful as a catalyst in epoxidation reactions of olefins,<br>
oxidation of alkanes, oxidation of alcohols and oxidation<br>
of thioethers to sulphoxides and sulphones using organic<br>
or inorganic hydroperoxides, such as for example H2O2,<br>
tertbutylhydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, as<br>
oxidising agents, in the amoximation of ketones, and more<br>
specifically of cyclohexanone to cyclohexanone oxime with<br>
NH3 and H2O2. When the ITQ-22 material contains Sn it is<br>
particularly useful as a catalyst in Baeyer-Villiger<br>
oxidation reactions in which H2O2 is used as an oxidising<br>
agent.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES<br>
Figure 1 represents the X-ray diffraction pattern of<br>
a sample of ITQ-22 as synthesised, in which the lattice<br>
consists solely of silicon and germanium oxides, with a<br>
ratio Si/Ge = 3.8 and which has been synthesised using<br>
the quaternary ammonium cation 1,5-bis<br>
(methylpyrrolidinium) pentane as structure directing<br>
agent.<br>
Figure 2 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of the<br>
same sample of ITQ-22 after being calcined at 580°C in<br><br>
order to eliminate organic compounds occluded in its<br>
interior.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1:<br>
This example illustrates the preparation of the<br>
dihydroxide of 1,5-bis (methylpyrrolidinium) pentane.<br>
In a 500 ml flask, 18.7 g of 1,5-dibromopentane, 20 g of<br>
1-methylpyrrolidine and 300 ml of acetone are mixed. The<br>
mixture is left to reflux for 24 hours, after which the<br>
precipitated solid is separated by decantation and then<br>
washed several times with acetone. Finally it is vacuum<br>
dried and 31.9 g of a white solid are obtained. The<br>
analysis of elements and the nuclear magnetic resonance<br>
spectrum in D2O of this solid indicate that it is the<br>
desired product, namely, 1,5-bis (methylpyrrolidinium)<br>
pentane dibromide.<br>
The dihydroxide form of the structure directing agent is<br>
obtained by means of anion exchange using a Dowex SBR<br>
resin (in molar excess). The exchange is carried out with<br>
stirring of the fluid bed of resin in hydroxide form and<br>
an aqueous solution of the bromide of the cation for one<br>
night. The solution obtained is titrated with HC1 (aq.)<br>
using phenolphthalein as indicator, with an exchange<br>
efficiency of 95% being obtained. This solution can be<br>
concentrated in the rotary evaporator for use in the<br>
synthesis of molecular sieves, for example at a<br>
concentration of 0.5-1 N.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2:<br>
This example illustrates the preparation of ITQ-22<br>
by means of using the cation 1,5-bis<br>
(methylpyrrolidinium) pentane.<br>
6.17 g of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) are added<br>
to 23.14 g of a solution of 1,5-bis<br>
(methylpyrrolidinium) pentane dihydroxide (R(OH)2)<br>
containing 0.96 equivalents of hydroxide in 1000 g. In<br>
this mixture 1.55 g of germanium oxide are added, and it<br>
is left to evaporate with stirring until complete<br>
elimination of the ethanol deriving from the hydrolysis<br>
of the TEOS plus the necessary quantity of water so that<br>
the final composition of the gel is:<br>
0.67 SiO2 : 0.33 GeO2 : 0.25 R(OH)2 : 3.5 H2O<br>
The mixture obtained is introduced into an autoclave<br>
internally lined with polytetrafluoroethylene and is<br>
heated at 175°C for 14 days. The autoclave is then<br>
cooled, the contents are filtered, the solid is washed<br>
with water and dried at 100°C. The X-ray diffraction<br>
pattern is shown in Figure I and the list of the most<br>
characteristic peaks appears in Table III. Calcination at<br>
580°C in air for 3 days permits occluded organic species<br>
to be eliminated. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the<br>
calcined zeolite ITQ-22 is shown in Figure 2 and the list<br>
of most characteristic peaks appears in Table IV and<br>
indicates that the material is stable during this<br>
process.<br>
EXAMPLE 3:<br><br>
The following example illustrates the preparation of<br>
ITQ-22 of different composition.<br>
12 g of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) are added to<br>
27.3 g of a solution of 1,5-bis (methylpyrrolidinium)<br>
pentane dihydroxide (R(OH)2) containing 1.16 equivalents<br>
of hydroxide in 1000 g. In this mixture 0.6 g of<br>
germanium oxide are dissolved, and it is left to<br>
evaporate with stirring until, complete elimination of the<br>
ethanol formed plus the excess of water so that the final<br>
composition is as follows:<br>
0.91 SiO2 : 0.09 GeO2 : 0.25 R(OH)2 : 3.5 H2O<br>
The mixture obtained is heated in autoclaves<br>
internally lined with polytetrafluoroethylene at 175°C<br>
for 14 days. The solid obtained after filtering, washing<br>
with distilled water and drying at 100°C is ITQ-22.<br>
EXAMPLE 4:<br>
This example illustrates synthesis of Al-ITQ-22.<br>
0.09 7 g of Al isopropoxide are added to 9 g of<br>
tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS). After that, 20.68 g of a<br>
solution of 1,5-bis (methylpyrrolidinium) pentane<br>
dihydroxide (R(OH)2) containing 1.16 equivalents of<br>
hydroxide in 1000 g are added, and then 0.45 g of<br>
germanium oxide are dissolved. The mixture is left to<br>
evaporate with stirring until complete elimination of the<br>
ethanol deriving from the hydrolysis of the TEOS plus the<br>
necessary quantity of water in order to achieve the<br>
stated final composition. The composition of the gel is:<br>
0.91 SiO2 : 0.09 GeO2 : 0.005 Al2O3 : 0.25 R(OH)2<br>
: 3.5 H2O<br><br>
The mixture obtained is introduced into an autoclave<br>
internally lined with polytetrafluoroethylene and is<br>
heated to 175°C for 12 days.<br>
The X-ray diffraction pattern of the solid obtained after<br>
filtering, washing with distilled water and drying at<br>
100°C indicates that it is ITQ-22.<br>
EXAMPLE 5:<br>
This example illustrates the preparation of a sample<br>
of Al-ITQ-22 with a chemical composition different from<br>
that of the above example.<br>
0.325 g of Al isopropoxide are added to 11.05 g of<br>
tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS). After that, 34.2 g of a<br>
solution of 1,5-bis (methylpyrrolidinium) pentane<br>
dihydroxide (R(OH)2) containing 1.2 equivalents of<br>
hydroxide in 1000 g are added, and then 2.77 g of<br>
germanium oxide are dissolved. The mixture is left to<br>
evaporate with stirring until complete elimination of the<br>
ethanol deriving from the hydrolysis of the TEOS plus the<br>
necessary quantity of water in order to achieve the<br>
stated final composition. The composition of the gel is:<br>
0.67 SiO2 : 0.33 GeO2 : 0.01 Al2O3 : 0.25 R(OH)2 :<br>
15 H2O<br>
The mixture obtained is introduced into autoclaves<br>
internally lined with polytetrafluoroethylene and is<br>
heated to 175°C for 12 days.<br>
The X-ray diffraction pattern of the solid obtained after<br>
filtering, washing with distilled water and drying at<br>
100°C indicates that it is ITQ-22. The solid obtained is<br>
calcined at 580°C for 3 hours and the X-ray diffraction<br><br>
pattern shows that the structure is maintained. The<br>
chemical analysis of the calcined zeolite indicates that<br>
it has a composition that accords with the molar ratios<br>
Si/Ge = 5 and (Si + Ge)/Al = 30.<br>
EXAMPLE 6:<br>
This example illustrates the synthesis of Ti-ITQ-22.<br>
0.3 g of Ti(IV) tetraethoxide are added to 9.26 g of<br>
tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS). After that, 39.97 g of a<br>
solution of 1,5-bis (methylpyrrolidinium) pentane<br>
dihydroxide (R(OH)2) containing 0.85 equivalents of<br>
hydroxide in 1000 g are added, and then 2.32 g of<br>
germanium oxide are dissolved. The mixture is left to<br>
evaporate with stirring until complete elimination of the<br>
ethanol deriving from the hydrolysis of the TEOS plus the<br>
necessary quantity of water in order to achieve the<br>
stated final composition. The composition of the gel is:<br>
0.67 SiO2 : 0.33 GeO2 : 0.02 TiO2 : 0.25 R(OH)2 :<br>
3.5 H2O<br>
The mixture obtained is introduced into an autoclave<br>
internally lined with polytetrafluoroethylene and is<br>
heated to 175°C for 16 days.<br>
The X-ray diffraction pattern of the solid obtained after<br>
filtering, washing with distilled water and drying at.<br>
100°C indicates that it is ITQ-22.<br>
EXAMPLE 7:<br>
This example illustrates the synthesis of Sn-ITQ-22.<br><br>
To 5.00 g of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), 15.12 g<br>
of a solution of 1,5-bis (methylpyrrolidinium) pentane<br>
dihydroxide (R(OH)2) containing 1.20 equivalents of<br>
hydroxide in 1000 g are added, and then 1.26 g of<br>
germanium oxide are dissolved. After that a solution of<br>
0.105 g of tin (IV) tetrachloride pentahydrate in 2 g of<br>
water is added. The mixture is left to evaporate with<br>
stirring until complete elimination of the ethanol<br>
deriving from the hydrolysis of the TEOS plus the<br>
necessary quantity of water in order to achieve the<br>
stated final composition. The composition of the gel is:<br>
0.67 SiO2 : 0.33 GeO2 : 0.0083 SnO2 : 0.25 R(OH)2<br>
: 3.5 H2O<br>
The mixture obtained is introduced into an autoclave<br>
internally lined with polytetrafluoroethylene and is<br>
heated to 175°C for 23 days.<br>
The X-ray diffraction pattern of the solid obtained after<br>
filtering, washing with distilled water and drying at<br>
100°C indicates that it is ITQ-22.<br>
EXAMPLE 8:<br>
This example illustrates the preparation of a<br>
component of the catalytic cracking catalyst containing<br>
zeolite type ITQ-22 previously activated in order to<br>
obtain the acid form at 580ºC in air.<br>
With the aim of studying the activity and<br>
selectivity of zeolite ITQ-22 in the catalytic cracking<br>
of industrial fractions of petroleum, a catalyst was<br>
prepared mixing ITQ-22 type zeolite, in its acid form, as<br>
was described in example 5 and a silica (BASF D1111),<br><br>
both in powder form and in a composition of 23% and 77%<br>
by weight of ITQ-22 type zeolite, and SiO2, respectively.<br>
The mixture, thoroughly homogenised, was made into cake<br>
form, crushed in a mortar and sieved taking the fraction<br>
between 0.59 and 0.84 mm in diameter.<br>
EXAMPLE 9:<br>
This example illustrates the use of zeolite ITQ-22<br>
as additive of the catalytic cracking catalyst of a<br>
vacuum gasoil.<br>
The catalytic components described in example 8 were<br>
used as additive of a zeolite US 4 catalyst in the<br>
catalytic cracking of a vacuum gasoil whose<br>
characteristics are given in table V The catalysts are<br>
provided on two separate beds in the reactor as described<br>
in Journal of Catalysis 1997, 165 (1), p. 102. In the<br>
upper zone, 1.5 grams of eolite US 4 catalyst of example<br>
9 are placed, and in the lower zone 1.34 g of catalyst of<br>
example 8.<br><br><br><br>
The reaction conditions were 520°C, reaction time of<br>
30 seconds, 2.34 grams of catalyst and catalyst/feed<br>
ratios by weight of 0.59, 0.73, 0.95, 1.35 and 2.38, the<br>
quantities of gasoil fed being 3.76, 3.07, 2.35, 1.65 and<br>
0.94 grams. The gases produced were analysed by gas<br>
chromatography, the liquids by simulated distillation<br>
(ASTM D-2887) and the coke was measured by analysis (IR)<br>
of the CO2 formed during the combustion. The conversion<br>
is defined as the sum of the yields of gases H2 and C1 -<br>

The composition (PIONA: Paraffins, Isoparaffins, Olefins<br>
and Aromatics) and quality (RON: Research Octane Number)<br>
of the gasoline fraction were determined by gas<br><br>
chromatography using the "detailed hydrocarbons analysis"<br>
computer program supplied by VARIAN and the correlations<br>
shown in the publication: Lugo, H.J., Ragone, G., and<br>
Zambrano, J., Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 38, 2111 (1999). The<br>
results obtained by interpolation at 80% of total<br>
conversion are shown in table VI. The use of the zeolite<br>
ITQ-22 as additive of zeolite USY (USY/ITQ-22 Catalyst)<br>
increases the yield of olefins C3 and C4 with respect to<br>
the base catalyst (USY), with a slight drop in the yield<br>
of gasoline. Also, the gasoline obtained has a lower<br>
aromatics content when the catalyst contains the additive<br>
ITQ-22.<br>
It is important to note that the propylene/propane<br>
ratio obtained is greater when ITQ-22 is used as<br>
additive, this result being highly beneficial from the<br>
point of view of a possible industrial process.<br>

EXAMPLE 10:<br>
The present example illustrates the use of a<br>
material prepared according to example 5 and activated by<br>
calcination in air at 580ºC for 3 hours as a catalyst in<br>
alkylation of benzene with propylene.<br>
An activated sample of the material prepared<br>
according to example 5 was made into cake form, selecting<br>
the particle size between 0.25 and 0.42 mm, in order to<br>
carry out the reaction. The zeolite (0.55 g) was diluted<br>
with silicon carbide (0.59 - 0.84 mm) in a ratio by<br>
weight of SiC/zeolite of 5. The diluted catalyst was<br>
introduced into a tubular steel reactor of diameter 1 cm<br>
and 100 mL.min-1 of N2 was passed under standard<br>
conditions at 150°C for 1.5 hours. The temperature was<br>
then lowered to 20°C and the N2 stream was cut off. At<br>
this point, benzene was fed (1200 uL.min-1) and the<br>
pressure was raised to 3.5 MPa. Once the pressure had<br>
reached 3.5 MPa, the temperature was raised to 125°C and<br>
the propylene started to be fed (270 uL.min-1), the molar<br>
ratio of benzene/propylene being 3.4.<br>
The results of converted propylene are presented in<br>
Table VII.<br><br>

benzene with propylene at 125°C, B/P = 3.4 mol.mol-1,<br>
WHSV prop = 6 h-1, P = 3.5 MPa for the catalyst Al-ITQ-<br>
22 prepared according to example 5.<br><br>
In this example, very high values of selectivity to<br>
cumene can be seen along with very low values of NPB and<br>
diisopropylbenzene (DIPB), less than those obtained using<br>
zeolite Beta as catalysts under the same reaction<br>
conditions. The results obtained with a commercial<br>
zeolite Beta of Si/Al = 13 supplied by Zeolyst (code<br>
CP811) are shown in Table VIII.<br>
Table VIII: Conversion and selectivity in alkylation of<br>
benzene with propylene at 125°C, B/P = 3.4 mol.mol-1,<br>
WHSV prop = 6 h-1, P = 3.5 MPa for a commercial catalyst<br>
of zeolite Beta (Si/Al = 13).<br><br><br><br>
From a comparison of the results presented in Tables<br>
VI and VIII, it can be seen that zeolite ITQ-22 displays<br>
greater selectivity to cumene and less to n-propylbenzene<br>
than zeolite Beta, which is the zeolitic catalyst<br>
currently most used for producing cumene.<br>

reaction temperature on the conversion and selectivity<br>

catalyst as in example 10, the rest of the reaction<br>

The present example illustrates the use of a<br>
material prepared according to example 5 and activated by<br>

An activated sample of the material prepared according to<br>
example 5 was made into cake form, selecting the particle<br>
size between 0.25 and 0.42 mm, in order to carry out the<br>
reaction. So, 0.55 g of the zeolite was diluted in 1.57 g<br>
of silicon carbide (0.59 - 0.84 mm). The diluted catalyst<br>
was introduced into a tubular steel reactor of diameter 1<br>
cm. The activation of the catalyst was the same as in<br>
example 10. In the present example the reaction<br>
temperature was 220°C, with 2.90 mmoles of benzene and<br>
0.30 mmoles of ethylene being fed, the pressure of the<br>
process being 3.5 MPa. The results obtained are presented<br>
in Table X.<br>
