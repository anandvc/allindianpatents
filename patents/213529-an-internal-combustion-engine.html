Mumbai 400 001 Maharashtra, India<br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following Complete specification particularly describes the invention and the manner<br>
in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to an Internal Combustion (IC) engine, which is developed with an<br>
integrated design approach for improved drive system for the coolant pump. The system<br>
according to this invention is compact, reduces the number of parts and its complexity. Consequently, the invented engine is cost effective in comparison with the existing complex systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In conventional IC engine, lubrication of rotating parts is ensured by oil pump. Major components like cylinder head, cylinder crank case and the like are cooled by pressurized supply of coolant by coolant pump. The oil pump is driven by the crank shaft and is housed in the front cover of the cylinder block. The coolant pump is mounted on the front face of the cylinder block and is driven separately by drive means such as belt, chain, gear and timing belt drives. The coolant pump cavity is cast in the cylinder block. This complicates the casting process and affects the accuracy of the pumping process or performance. In this arrangement or system, the coolant pump element or the impeller need support bearings. Conventionally, a double row ball bearings or integrated shaft bearings are used. A separate drive means such as drive pulleys, chain and sprocket means, or gear arrangement is required for driving the coolant pump. This coolant pump provided with drive means increases the complexity of construction and hence the cost.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The publication number US2001/ 0023668A1 dated September 27, 2001 discloses an integrated front module housing comprising of thermostat housing, water pump housing, oil pump housing, coolant and oil passages, support boss member and sensor housing. The method of manufacture of this integral casting is also disclosed. The invention is for the integration concept of various housings and its manufacturing method.   It does not<br>
-2-<br><br>
have any additional balancer shaft parallel to the crankshaft. The water pump housing is integral with the front cover for the conventional water pump design.<br>
The US Patent publication number 5704329 dated January 6, 1998 discloses a front cover, which is mounted on the front end of an IC engine to cover cam gear drive mechanism. The mounting of various accessories is provided on this cover. However it does not have coolant pump.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The main object of this invention is to develop an internal combustion engine using an integrated design approach for the coolant pump and oil pump by adopting an innovative drive system for the coolant pump, which is compact, simple and cost effective with higher reliability and efficacy.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THIS INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an internal combustion engine having integrated coolant pump and oil pump and which comprises of a balancer shaft drivable by a crank shaft through a drive means for rotating the crank shaft and the balancer shaft in the same speed but in the opposite direction, said balancer shaft being adjacent to said crank shaft, the front end of said balancer shaft is extended for driving the impeller of said coolant pump, the coolant pump volute cavity formed in the cover for the cylinder crankcase of the said engine. The timing drive of the engine is simplified due to elimination of the coolant<br>
pump from the drive. The timing drive means is located on the front end of said crankshaft to drive the camshaft alone.<br>

DESCRIPTION RELATING TO THE EMBODIMENTS AND THE METHOD OF OPERATION<br>
Primary inertia forces induced by the reciprocating mass of the engine are balanced by the balancer shaft (13) which is driven by the crank shaft (18). Driving means may be selected from chain / belt or gears (16 &amp; 17). The drive means rotate the shafts in the same speed but in the opposite direction. The crank case (3) skirt portion is extended to accommodate the balancer shaft (13), which is positioned adjacent to the crank shaft (18). Two Hydrodynamic bearings support the balancer shaft. The impeller (12) of the coolant pump is driven by the front end of the balancer shaft (13) which is extended thereto. The impeller (12) can also be mounted on separate shaft called "Impeller shaft" housed in the coolant pump and that can be driven by front end of the balancer shaft (13). In such case oil seal (15) can be replaced by a ball bearing, which apart from supporting the impeller shaft will also seal the crankcase (3). The cover (1) of the crank case (3) is integrated with housing of the coolant pump. The crankcase cover (1) also holds an oil pump, the element (25) of which is driven by the front end of the crank shaft (18).<br>
With this arrangement, the coolant pump volute cavity (12a) becomes a part of the crankcase cover (1). Thus the crankcase cover (1) houses the oil pump, the oil suction port, the pressurized oil supply channel (4) to main oil gallery (5), the oil pressure relief valve circuit (21), coolant pump, the coolant suction, the channel for coolant supply (6) to coolant inlet (7) to crankcase (3), and the coolant bypass connection (11). The oils seals (15 &amp; 19) are pre-assembled in the crankcase cover (1). The coolant seal (14) is assembled on balancer shaft (13) using suitable tools / fixture to ensure its desired<br>
-5-<br><br>
working height / clearances. The space between the oil seal (15) and coolant seal (14) collects the seepage coolant, which is connected to a cosmetic drain port, designed to carry this liquid coolant away. The impeller (12) is assembled on the front end of the balancer shaft (13) and is covered by the coolant pump cover (9), which is also functioning as coolant suction port (10).   The radiator outlet hose fits on the coolant<br>
pump cover (9) to provide an axial entry for the coolant in the coolant pump. The coolant bypass hose (8) from the crankcase (3) is connected to the bypass nipple (22) on the coolant pump cover (9). This coolant bypass channel can also be incorporated in the crankcase cover (1). This forms an integral assembly of coolant pump, oil pump and crankcase cover (1). The crankcase cover (1) can be manufactured either by High Pressure Die Casting (HPDC), or Gravity Die Casting (GDC), or Low Pressure Die Casting (LPDC), or by Fabrication method.<br>
In addition, the crank speed sensor mounting lug (20) is provided on the crankcase cover (1). The mounting of the crankcase cover (1) on the crankcase (3) is facilitated through multiple mounting holes (24) for M6 screws with two dowel mounting holes (23) for ensuring required alignment and gasket (2) seals the joint between crankcase cover (1) and the crankcase (3).<br>
The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purpose of illustration only, and that numerous alterations and modifications may be practiced by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof.<br><br>
