COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A COMPOUND OF FORMULA I"<br>
ASTRAZENECA  AB,   a  Swedish  company,   of S-151   85   Sodertalje, SWEDEN,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
Field of the invention<br>
5      The present invention is related to novel compounds having affinity to one or more GABAB receptors, as well as to their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and stereoisomers. The invention is also related to processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing said therapeutically active compounds and to the use of said active compounds in therapy. 10<br>
Background and prior art Reflux<br>
Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is the most prevalent upper gastrointestinal 15      tract disease. Current therapy has aimed at reducing gastric acid secretion, or at reducing oesophageal acid exposure by enhancing oesophageal clearance, lower oesophageal sphincter tone and gastric emptying. The major mechanism behind reflux has earlier been considered to depend on a hypotonic lower oesophageal sphincter. However recent research (e.g. Hollow ay &amp; Dent (1990) Gastroenterol. Clin. N. Amer. 19. 517-535) has 20      shown that most reflux episodes occur during transient lower oesophageal sphincter<br>
relaxations, hereinafter referred to as TLOSR, i.e. relaxations not triggered by swallows. It has also been shown that gastric acid secretion usually is normal in patients with GORD.<br>
Consequently, there is a need for compounds which reduce the incidence of TLOSR and 25      thereby prevent reflux.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a local anaesthetic, adapted to inhibit relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphicter are disclosed in WO 87/04077 and in US 5,036,057. Recently GABAB-receptor agonists have been shown to inhibit TLOSR which is disclosed 30      in WO 98/11885.<br><br>

Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is the most prevalent upper gastrointestinal 15      tract disease.

Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a local anaesthetic, adapted to inhibit relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphicter are disclosed in WO 87/04077 and in US 5,036,057. Recently GABAg-receptor agonists have been shown to inhibit TLOSR which is discJosed         in WO 98/11885.<br><br>
GABAB receptor agonists<br>
GABA (4-aminobutanoic acid) is an endogenous neurotransmitter in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Receptors for GABA have traditionally been divided into GABAA and GABAB receptor subtypes. GABAB receptors belong to the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors. GABAB receptor agonists are being described as being of use in the treatment of CNS disorders, such as muscle relaxation in spinal spasticity, cardiovascular disorders, asthma, gut motility disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and as prokinetic and anti-tussive agents. GABAB receptor agonists-have also been disclosed as useful in the treatment of emesis (WO 96/11680) and recently, as mentioned above, in the inhibition of TLOSR (WO 98/11885).<br>
The most studied GABAB receptor agonist is baclofen (4-amino-3-(chlorophenyl)butanoic acid) disclosed in the Swiss patent No. CH 449, 046. Baclofen has for several years been used as an antispastic agent. EP 0356128 describes the use of the specific compound (3-aminopropyl)methylphosphinic acid, as a potent GABAB receptor agonist, in therapy. EP 0181833 discloses substituted 3-aminopropylphosphinic acids which are found to have very high affinities towards GABAB receptor sites. In analogy to baclofen, the compounds can be used as for instance muscle relaxants. EP 0399949 discloses derivatives of (3-aminopropyl)methylphosphinic acid which are described as potent GABAB receptor agonists. These compounds are stated to be useful as muscle relaxants. EP 0463969 and FR 2722192 are both applications related to 4-aminobutanoic acid derivatives having different heterocyclic substituents at the 3-carbon of the butyl chain. Structure-activity relationships of several phosphinic acid analogues with respect to their affinities to the GABAB receptor as well as their muscle relaxant effect are discussed in J. Med. Chem. (1995), 38, 3297-3312. The conclusion in said article is that considerably stronger muscle relaxation could be achieved with the (S)-enantiomer of 3-amino-2-hydroxypropyImethyIphosphinic acid than with baclofen and without the occurrence of unwanted CNS effects.<br><br>
In literature the phosphinic acids having a hydrogen atom attached to phosphorous also are named phosphonous acids. These are two names for the same compounds and both names can be used. However, we have chosen to use the name phosphinic acids for the compounds according to the present invention.<br>
Outline of the invention<br>
The present invention provides novel compounds of the formula I<br><br><br>
(I) <br>
wherein<br>
R1 represents hydrogen, hydroxy, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy or halogen;<br>
R2 represents hydroxy, mercapto, halogen/or an oxo group;<br>
R3 represents hydrogen or lower alkyl (optionally substituted with hydroxy, mercapto, lower alkoxy, lower thioalkoxy or aryl);<br>
R4 represents hydrogen, lower alkyl (optionally substituted with aryl), or aryl;<br>
and pharrnaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and the stereoisomers thereof,<br>
with the exceptions of:<br>
i)     the racemate of (3-amino-2-hydroxypropyl)phosphinic acid, and ii)   (2R/S, 3R)-(3-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)phosphinic ac.d.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment<br>
R1 represents hydrogen, a lower alkyl or halogen;<br>
R2 represents halogen, hydroxy or an oxo group;<br>
R3 represents hydrogen; and<br>
R4 represents hydrogen;<br>
with the exception of the racemate of (3-amino-2-hydroxypropyl)phosphinic acid.<br>
Even more preferred compounds are (3-amino-2-fluoropropyl)phosphinic acid, (2R)-(3-amino-2-fluorop'ropyl)phosphinic acid, (2S)-(3-amino-2-fluoropropyI)phosphinic acid, (3-amino-2-fluoro-l-methylpropyl)phosphinic acid, (3-amino-2-oxopropyl)phosphinic acid, (2S)-(3-amino-2-hydroxypropyl)phosphinic acid, ), (2R)-(3-amino-2-hydroxypropyl)phosphinic acid and (3-amino-l-fluoro-2-hydroxypropyl)phosphinic acid.<br>
Within the scope of the invention, it is to be understood that when R2 is an oxo group the bond between R2 and the carbon is a double bond.<br>
Within the scope of the invention, it is to be understood by "lower" radicals and :ompounds, for example, those having up to and including 7, especially up to and ncluding 4, carbon atoms. Also the general terms have the following meanings:<br>
.ower alkyl is, for example, C1 -C4 alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl or n-butyl, also sopropyl, isobutyl, secondary butyl or tertiary butyl, but may also be a C5-C7 alkyl group uch as a pentyl, hexyl or heptyl'group.<br><br>
Lower alkoxy is, for example, C1-C4 alkoxy, such as methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy or n-butoxy, also isopropoxy, isobutoxy, secondary butoxy or tertiary butoxy, but may also be a C5-C7 alkoxy group, such as a pentoxy, hexoxy or heptoxy group.<br>
Lower thioalkoxy is, for example, C1-C4 thioalkoxy, such as thiomethoxy, thioethoxy, n-thiopropoxy or n-thiobutoxy, also thioisopropoxy, thioisobutoxy, secondary thiobutoxy or tertiary thiobutoxy, but may also be a C5-C7 thioalkoxy group, such as a thiopentoxy, thiohexoxy or thioheptoxy group.<br>
Halogen is halogen of an atomic number up to and including 35, such as flourine or chlorine, and less prefered bromine.<br>
The compounds according to formula I of the invention are of amphoteric nature and may be presented in the form of internal salts. They can also form acid addition salts and salts with bases. Such salts are particularly pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts formed with bases. Suitable acids for the formation of such salts include, for example, mineral acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, or phosphoric acid or organic acids such as sulfonic acids and carboxylic acids. Salts with bases are, for example, alkali metal salts, e.g. sodium or potassium salts, or alkaline earth metal salts, e.g. calcium or magnesium salts, as well as ammonium salts, such as those with ammonia or organic amines. The salts may be prepared by conventional methods.<br>
When one or more stereocentre is present in the molecule, the compounds according to formula I can be in the form of a stereoisomeric mixture, i.e. a mixture of diastereomers and/or racemates, or in the form of the single stereoisomers, i.e. the single enantiomer and/or diastereomer. The compounds can also be in the form of solvates, e.g. hydrates.<br>
All of the compounds according to the formula I can be used for the inhibition of TLOSR, and thus for the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The said inhibition of<br><br><br>
TLOSR also implies that the said compounds of formula I can be used for the treatment of regurgitation in infants. Effective management of regurgitation in infants would be an important way of managing failure to thrive due to excessive loss of ingested nutrient. Furthermore the novel compounds can be used for the treatment of GORD-related or non-GORD related asthma, belching, coughing, pain, cocaine addiction, hiccups, IBS, dyspepsia, emesis and nociception.<br>
As opposed to what is stated in prior art, (J.Med.Chem. (1995) 3297-3312 and The GABA Receptors; Second Edition, Edited by S.J. Enna and Norman Bowery, Humana Press (1997) especially p. 281-282), the compounds according to the invention have surprisingly high metabolic stability in spite of the presence of a P-H bond. The compounds also possess a surprisingly high therapeutic index.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The invention is described more in detail by the following non-limiting examples Example 1. (3-Amino-2-fluoropropyl)phosphinic acid<br>
To an ice bath cooled solution of ethyl (3-amino-2-fluoro-3-<br>
oxopropyl)(diethoxymetbyl)phosphinate in THF (tetrahydrofuran) was added 1 M BH3 THF while under an argon atmosphere. After 10 minutes, the solution was heated to reflux for 2.5 h. The solution was cooled to room temperature and 6 N HCl (200 mL) was added. The THF was removed by rotoevaporation and the aqueous layer refluxed for 2.5 h. The solution was cooled and evaporated. The residue was purified by ion exchange column chromatography (DOWEX® 50WX-8-200, H+ form, 3.5 x 4.0 cm). The ion exchange resin was pre-washed with 2:1 methanol/water (400 mL). The crude product dissolved in 1:1 methanol/water was loaded onto the column and washed with 1:1 methanol/water (400 mL). The eluent was changed to 3:1 methanol/concentrated ammonium hydroxide. Two fractions (150 mL totally) were combined and evaporated to give 645 mg (34%) of (3-amino-2-fluoropropyl)phosphinic acid as a white solid. Data: mp 203-207 °C; Rf = 0.35 (60:40:1 methanol, methylene chloride, concentrated ammonium hydroxide); 1H NMR (300 MHz, D20) 5 7.11 (d, J = 528 Hz. 1H), 5.18 (dm, J = 54 Hz, 1H), 3.28-3.45 (m, 2H), 1.65-2.23 (m, 2H); nC NMR (125 MHz, D20 + Dioxane) 5 87.8 (d, J= 170 Hz), 44.3 (dd, J= 12.6, 21.6 Hz), 35.6 (dd,J = 20.2, 86.5 Hz); APIMS: m/z = 142 (M+H)+.<br>
Example 2. [2S)-(3-Amino-2-hvdroxypropyl)phosphinic acid<br>
A mixture of ethyl (25)-(3-amino-2-hydroxypropyl)(l,l-diethoxyethyl)phosphinate (1.0 g, 3.5 mmol) and concentrated HCl (50 mL) was heated to reflux for 2 h. The solution was cooled to room temperature and evaporated. The residue was dissolved in methanol (100 ml) and treated with propylene oxide (2 ml) at room temperature.-After the mixture was stirred for 5 hours, the precipitated solid was collected by decanting off the solvent. The solid was dried with a stream of argon to give 220 mg (45%) of (25)-(3-amino-2-<br><br>
hydroxypropyl)phosphinic acid as a white solid. Data: !H NMR (300 MHz, D20) 5 7.1 (d, J= 540 Hz, IH), 4.2 (m, IH), 2.9-3.2 (m, 2H), 1.7-2.0 (m, 2H); 31P NMR (121 MHz, D20) 5 24.2 (d,J= 522 Hz); FABMS: m/z = 140 (M+H)+; [α]D at 20 °C =+8 ° (0.5% in O.IM HC1).<br>

Biological studies<br>
[ HJGABA radioligand binding assay<br>
Rat synaptic membranes were prepared from the whole brain of Sprague Dawley male rats essentially as described previously (Zukin, et al. (1974) Proc. Natl. Acad. USA 71, 4802-4807). The [3H]GABA competition assay, modified from Olpe et al ((1990) Eur. J. Pharmacol. 187, 27-38), was performed in 200 ul TCI (Tris Calcium Isoguvacine) buffer (50 mM Tris (tri(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane), pH 7.4, 2.5 mM CaCl2 and 40μM isoguvacine) containing 20 nM ["HJGABA (specific activity: 3 Tera Becquerel (TBq)/mmoI), test compound or solvent and 80 ug synaptic membrane protein using 96-well plates. After incubation for 12-20 min at room temperature, incubations were terminated by rapid filtration through a glass fiber filter (Printed filtermat B filters,<br><br>
Wallac), which had been pretreated with 0.3% polyethyleneimine, using a 96-well plate cell harvester (Skatron or Tomtec). The filters were washed with buffer containing 50 mM Tris (tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) and 2.5 mM CaCh, pH 7.4, at 4 °C and then dried at 55° C. MeltiLex B/HS scintillator sheet (Wallac) was melted onto the filter, and radioactivity was determined in a Microbeta scintillation counter (Wallac).<br>
Results and discussion<br>
The compounds of the present invention were found to have high affinities and potencies for the GABAB receptor as revealed by low IC50 and EC50 in the binding and ileum assays, respectively. The compounds have also been found to reduce TLOSR when administered i.v. as well as p.o. in animal models. Contrary to what has been claimed in the literature for 3-aminopropylphosphinic acid derivatives having a P-H bond, we found that the compounds of the present invention have high metabolic stability in animal models. Moreover, CNS side-effects (as measured by reduction in body temperature in the mouse) were not observable or only seen at very high doses. Therefore, the difference between therapeutic dose (inhibition of TLOSR in the dog model) and dose causing side-effects (in the mouse model) was unexpectedly high.<br><br>
