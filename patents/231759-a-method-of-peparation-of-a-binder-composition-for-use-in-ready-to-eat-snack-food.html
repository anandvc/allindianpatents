				<td>A METHOD OF PREPARATION OF A BINDER COMPOSITION FOR USE  IN READY-TO-EAT HEALTH SNACK FOOD<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a binder composition for use in ready to eat health snack foods. Background of the invention<br>
Snack foods are easily consumed, readily available small sized products, in liquid or solid form, requiring little or no preparation for consumption. Cereal and granola bars are popular snack items. Snack items have not been generally regarded as true foods and their nutritive value has been rarely emphasized. The tendency to consume more nutritious foods has let to the development of new snack foods such as chocolate covered cereal bars, or those containing dry fruits and nuts. Mixtures of nutmeats, cereals and/or dried or sugar-infused fruits have also become popular snacks or quick energy foods<br>
In view of the popularity of snack foods, they can be an ideal medium to provide nutritional supplements. The protein and vitamin content can be enriched in order to enhance energy content. Such snack foods could play an important role in physical and mental well being of both children and adults.<br>
Mixtures containing nuts, cereals, such as granola, and fruit are referred to as "trail mixes" Due to difficulties associated in packaging and preserving such loose mixtures of differently textured and sized ingredients, methods have been sought to bind the various ingredients into food bars which are convenient to handle and consume and which may be easily packaged, shipped and displayed.<br>
Several types of binding matrix have been used to produce snack foods of this nature One example of this food is the nut bar which typically consists of nutmeats bound together by an edible matrix. The most common matrix for this type of food bar is formed almost entirely of sucrose which is applied to the nuts as a syrup and which becomes crystalline upon evaporation of the water. Such food-bars rapidly develop a crunchy, crisp texture on storage<br>
The granola bars, which is another form of a ready-to-eat food bar typically consists of a major portion of granola, e.g. rolled oats and/or wheat, and minor amounts of fruit and I or nuts These bars are commonly bound by a baked matrix comprising crumbs of the cereal product saturated with sugar and vegetable oils. Such bars might also contain processed cereals such as puffed wheat or rice. These bars have dry and friable texture.<br><br>
In some snack foods, spongy and sticky texture is achieved by using gelatin-based binders A binder can also acquire its binding properties with the use of jaggery, citric acid, glucose syrup, and polyols.<br>
Jaggery a. dark, coarse, unrefined sugar (sometimes referred to as palm sugar) can be made either from the sap of various palm trees or from sugar-cane juice. It is made by caishing the canes and evaporating the juice by boiling. It is primarily used in India, where many categorize sugar made from sugar cane as jaggery and that processed from palm trees as gur Jaggery has a sweet, wine like fragrance and flavour that lends distinction to whatever food it embellishes. Jaggery contains more than 90% sucrose. Similar to sugar, jaggery when heated in water can be formed into a syrup of varying concentrations and binding properties<br>
Citric acid occurs naturally in lemon juice. Citric acid can be used to bring about inversion of sucrose. In this process sucrose, which is a disaccharide, can be broken down into a mixture of two monosaccharides, known as glucose and fructose. This is also called as invert sugar. This reaction can be induced deliberately as a means of developing desirable characteristics in a sweetmeat. An example is where significant quantities of invert sugar are required in a syrup phase to produce a flowing eating texture. Since invert sugar contains fructose it enhances the sweetness of the product in which it is present.<br>
Glucose syrup is produced continuously in high volume refineries or by batch processes. The starting material may be from any food grade starch mainly maize or potato Conversion to glucose syrup is by acid hydrolysis or enzymatic techniques. Different specifications of glucose syrup have functionalities which allow high-boiled sweet manufacturing ranging from batch to continuous and depositing methods. Glucose syrup is a very versatile material. It adjusts the plasticity of the cooked mass before forming sweets shapes and cooked syrup viscosity before depositing. A wide variety of glucose syrups are available for use in toffees, and although their properties vary considerably they all have the same effect on sugar solubility The main differences are the effects on texture and sweetness<br>
Sorbitol is a naturally occurring sugar alcohol found in certain edible fruits, vegetables, and berries. It is manufactured by catalytic hydrogenation of glucose In many countries sorbitol is used as a sweetener in various food applications. They also have emulsifying, stabilising, humectancy and thickening properties. Sorbitol is available in both crystalline and liquid form.<br>
Reference is made to Glenn D. LaBaw, and Stephen E Meyer (US Patent 4784867) wherein food ingredients such as nuts, fruits, cereals and the like are made into bars using<br><br>
binder composition of water, fat, sucrose and partially caramelized non-crystallizing sugar The draw back of the binder is that it produces flexible and moist bars<br>
Reference is made to Milton L.Cook, William L Keyser, Paul Swanson, Michael W Zielke and Walter J Zielinski (US Patent 4451488) wherein a food bar is made using a binder comprising of at least two polyhydric alcohols in varying ratios are used. The draw back of the binder is it produces product with soft and chewy texture.<br>
Reference is made to Vernon H. Ode (US Patent 3903398) wherein a ready-to-eat food bar is prepared using a binder consisting of a sweetened, low moisture whole milk product   The drawback is the binder imparts a chewy texture to the food bar.<br>
Reference is made to James R. Hayward, William L. Keyser and Walter J Zielinski (L'S Patent 4145448) wherein gelatin-based marshmallow-type matrices are used to bind cereal products and vitamins. The drawback is such products are spongy and sticky in texture<br>
Reference is made to US Patent No. 4055669 wherein a ready-to-eat granola bar consisting of rolled oats and wheat, and minor amounts of fruit and nuts. The binding is achieved using crumbs of a cereal product saturated with sugar and vegetable oils. The drawback is these bars are typically dry and friable in texture. Objects of the invention<br>
