				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is generally directed to a process for making high density detergent compositions from a high active surfactant paste and other detergent ingredients. More particularly, the invention is directed to a process for producing a high density detergent composition in the form of agglomerates in which the stability and shelf life of a high active surfactant paste containing mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactant is unexpectedly improved and maintained. This process is especially useful in the production of modern compact granular detergent compositions which typically require higher levels of active detersive surfactants.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Recently, there has been considerable interest within the detergent industry for laundry detergents which are "compact" and therefore, have low dosage volumes. To facilitate production of these so-called low dosage detergents, many attempts have been made to produce high bulk density detergents, for example with a density of 650 g/1 or higher. The low dosage detergents are currently in high demand as they conserve resources and can be sold in small packages which are more convenient for consumers.<br>
Generally, there are two primary types of processes by which detergent granules or powders can be prepared. The first type of process involves spray-drying an aqueous detergent slurry in a spray-drying tower to produce highly porous detergent granules. In the second type of process, various detergent components are mixed after which they are agglomerated with a nonionic or anionic detergent paste that also serves as the binder for the agglomerated particle itself. In both processes, the most important factors which govern the density of the resulting detergent granules are the density, porosity and surface area of the various starting materials and their respective chemical composition. These parameters, however, can only be varied within a limited range. Thus, a substantial bulk density increase can only be achieved by additional processing steps which lead to densification of the detergent granules or via build-up agglomeration processes.<br>
The art is replete with processes directed to agglomeration for producing detergent compositions. For example, attempts have been made to agglomerate detergent builders by mixing zeolite and/or layered silicates in a mixer to form free flowing agglomerates. Yet another example involves a starting detergent material in the form of highly active, viscoelastic surfactant paste which is agglomerated with dry powders such as<br>
aluminosilicates and carbonates into crisp, free flowing, highly dense detergent agglomerates. However, a wide variety of problems have been encountered with handling high active, highly viscoelastic surfactant pastes which are used to produce high density, high active detergent agglomerates suitable for modern low dosage detergent products. Specifically, such high active surfactant pastes are extremely sensitive to environmental and operating equipment parameters, all of which make the pastes difficult to transport, store and process when producing detergent agglomerates.<br>
Typically, surfactant pastes are manufactured by a process in which fatty alcohol is sulfated, and thereafter, neutralized with an alkaline material (e.g. sodium hydroxide). This is an extremely delicate process, especially when used to produce high active surfactant pastes predominantly (greater than 60% by weight) containing the active surfactant and only a relatively minor amount of water and adjuncts. The resulting high active surfactant pastes are extremely sensitive to their environment, for example., high temperature zones or "hot spots" in the equipment (pipes, valves, storage tanks and the like) to which it is exposed as well as any contaminants having a pH of less than 7 which make their way into. the paste. In the event that the high active surfactant paste is exposed to one or more of these environmental factors, such high active pastes have a tendency to undergo a hydrolysis reaction, wherein the surfactant reverts back to its alcohol form. This hydrolysis reaction is an autocatalytic reaction in that a by-product is an acid which continues to react with any remaining surfactant. This threat of hydrolysis particularly exacerbates the environmental sensitivity of high surfactant pastes and renders them difficult to keep stable over periods of time (e.g. 2-7 days) necessary for large-scale commercial manufacture of modern compact laundry detergents. It should be understood that even hydrolysis of 1% by weight of the surfactant paste can have major financial consequences in large-scale commercial manufacturing of detergent products.<br>
Typical prior art attempts in this area involved immediately forming surfactant particles after the paste was manufactured. However, this requires "on-site" particle forming equipment or requires the surfactant-making equipment to be housed in or near the detergent manufacturing facility. Currently, detergent-making and surfactant paste-making industries have become separated both physically as well as from a commercial standpoint, a trend which is only increasing. Thus, it would be desirable to have a high active surfactant paste which remains stable over longer periods of time so as to enable the<br>
surfactant-making operation to be located farther away from the detergent-making facility which is more representative of the current commercial environment.<br>
Yet another challenge with the use of such high active surfactant pastes involves their rheological properties in that they must have a low enough viscosity to be pumped in and out of transport trucks or trains and in and out of storage tanks at the detergent<br>
manufacturing facility. Any significant temperature changes may lead to undesirable gelling or solidification of the surfactant paste causing increases in manufacturing expenses and time. Note, however, that different rheological properties of the surfactant paste may result upon reheating.<br>
Also in that regard, additional ingredients such as carbonates which are included so as to maintain the storage and transport stability of the surfactant paste before it is processed has the effect of increasing the viscoelasticity of the high active surfactant paste, therefore rendering it very difficult to process. The difficulty in processing arises due to a change in the viscoelasticity of the surfactant paste which requires relatively expensive high-pressure pumps, larger pipe lines and shorter transport distances to be implemented into the detergent-making process. As a consequence, it would be desirable to have a process in which the storage stability of the paste is maintained without sacrificing its processability.<br>
Accordingly, despite the above-mentioned disclosures in the art, there remains a need for a process for producing an agglomerated detergent composition from a high active surfactant paste which is sufficiently stable during transportation and storage for sufficient periods of time so as to enable large-scale commercial manufacture of modern compact detergent compositions. Also, there remains a need for such a process which is inexpensive and can be easily incorporated into large-scale production facilities for low dosage or compact detergents.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention meets the needs identified above by providing a process for making detergent agglomerates from a high active surfactant paste containing a mid-chain branched alkyl sulfate surfactant and a detergent builder. There is a significant advantage with this process in that the surfactant paste is stable, pumpable, and transportable over an extended period of time so as to facilitate multi-location, large-scale manufacture of modern compact detergent products. In particular, the high active surfactant paste can be manufactured in one facility, and thereafter, stored and transported to a remote facility for further processing into the finished detergent agglomerates. Additionally, the mid-chain<br>
branched surfactant in the surfactant paste results in detergent agglomerates which exhibit overall improved cleaning performance, especially in low temperature laundering-solutions.<br>
As used herein, the term "contaminants" means any foreign substance with which the surfactant paste comes into contact while being stored and transported prior to the inputting and agglomerating steps in the process. Examples of such contaminants include,<br>
but are not limited to, multi-colored residue of sulfuric acid, sodium sulfate, fatty alcohol,<br>
iron, chromium, and nickel. As used herein with respect to the surfactant paste, the term "stable" means that the surfactant paste substantially retains its formulation which contains a neuralized surfactant and has not significantly reverted via hydrolysis back to its alcohol form. As used herein with respect to the surfactant paste, the term "processable" means that the surfactant paste retains desirable archeological properties so as to allow it to be used in the current process which typically means that it will have a viscosity as detailed hereinafter with respect to the Power Law Model. As used herein, the term "agglomerates" refers to particles formed by agglomerating detergent granules or particles which typically have a smaller mean particle size than the formed agglomerates. All percentages and ratios used herein are expressed as percentages by weight (anhydrous basis) unless otherwise indicated. All documents are incorporated herein by reference.

The detergent agglomerates of the present invention is  a synergatic composition, the ingradients of which   do not react chemically but interact to provide surprising results . The detergent agglomerates are not a mere <br>
adventure.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a process for producing an agglomerated detergent composition from a high active surfactant paste which is sufficiently stable during transportation and storage for sufficiently extended periods of time so as to enable large-scale commerical manufacture of modern compact detergent compositions. It is also an object of the invention to provide such a process which produces a detergent composition having improved cleaning performance, especially in low temperature wash solutions. It is also an object of the invention to provide such a process which is inexpensive cna can be easily incorporated into large-scale production facilities for low dosage or compact detergents. These and other objects, features and attendant advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a reading of the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment and the appended claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT <br>
Generally, the present process is used in the production of low dosage detergents, whereby the resulting detergent agglomerates can be used as a detergent or as a detergent additive. In particular, the process can be used to form "high active" (i.e. high surfactant level) detergent agglomerates containing a mid-chain branched alkyl sulfate surfactant which are used as an admix for purposes of enhancing the active levels in granular low dosage detergents, and thereby, allow for more compact detergents.<br>
Process<br>
The process produces free flowing, high density detergent agglomerates, preferably having a density of at least 650 g/1. The process produces high density detergent agglomerates from a highly active and viscoelastic surfactant paste having a relatively low water content and a mid-chain branched alkyl sulfate surfactant as described in detail<br>
hereinafter. By inclusion, of the aforesaid mid-chain alkyl sulfate in the paste, higher active levels are possible in the paste as well as easier handling of the paste in terms of transport and storage. In the past, processing and storing certain highly viscoelastic, high active surfactant pastes has been a problem, especially in light of their sensitivity to temperature variations and contaminants which are acidic in nature. While not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that such temperature variations and acidic contaminants cause the autocatalytic hydrolysis reaction of the surfactant paste which effectively reverts the surfactant paste to an aqueous alcohol solution that cannot be reprocessed. It has therefore been found that optimally selected temperature ranges and pH ranges of contaminants must be regulated in order to produce the desired detergent agglomerates which are used in modern compact detergent products. While such temperature and pH regulation is helpful, it is not necessary with surfactant pastes including the mid-chain branched alkyl sulfate surfactant.<br>
In the first step of the process, a non-linear viscoelastic surfactant paste is provided which is characteristic of many highly active, highly viscoelastic pastes used in producing . high density detergent agglomerates. The phrase "nonlinear viscoelastic" means that the paste has a nonlinear fluid velocity profile and exhibits viscoelastic fluid behavior, i.e. it can be stretched during flow such as chewing gum or the like. Until now, such nonlinear viscoelastic surfactant pastes have been very difficult to process and keep stable. Preferably, the surfactant paste comprises, by weight of the surfactant paste, from about 70% to about 95%, more preferably from about 70% to about 90%, and most preferably from about 70% to about 85%, of the mid-chain branched alkyl sulfate surfactant. In a preferred embodiment, the surfactant paste is a mixture of the mid-chain branched alkyl sulfate ("BAS"), alkyl sulfate ("AS") and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate ("LAS") surfactants. Another optional surfactant which can be included is alkyl ethoxy sulfate ("AES"). In a preferred embodiment, the alcohols used to prepare the BAS and AS surfactants are blended together prior to sulfation. The appropriate ratio of these alcohols are chosen such that the alcohol mixture remains fluid during transport, handling, and sulfation. Most preferably, a mid-chain branched alcohol/linear alcohol weight ratio of about 7:3 or greater is used.<br>
The surfactant paste also includes from about 5% to about 30%, more preferably from about 15% to about 25%, and most preferably from about 15% to about 20%, by<br>
weight of the paste, of water. Additionally, the paste includes from about 0.1% to about 10%, more preferably from about 1% to about 12%, and most preferably from about 2% to about 10%, by weight of the paste, of polyethylene glycol. The surfactant paste also contains from about 0.01% to about 5%, more preferably from about 0.1% to about 1%, and most preferably from about 0.5% to about 1%, by weight of the paste, of an alkali metal<br>
hydroxide which preferably is sodium hydroxide. Also included in the surfactant paste are minor ingredients such as unreacted alcohols, sulfates and the like, although it is preferable to keep these amounts to a minimum.<br>
In an optional step of the process, the surfactant paste is regulated within a temperature range of from about 40°C to about 80°C, more preferably from about 50°C to about 70°C, and most preferably from about 60°C to about 65°C. Preferably, the regulating step maintains or renders the surfactant paste stable for at least 48 hours, more preferably for at least 72 hours, and most preferably for at least 170 hours. In this way, the likelihood of the surfactant paste undergoing the undesirable hydrolysis reaction and/or being difficult to transport and process due to unbearable rheological properties, such as high viscosity, is eliminated. It has been found that the use of the mid-chain branched surfactant described herein can be easily transported, pumped, or otherwise handled since it can be kept stable at the aforementioned lower temperatures. While not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the degree of crystallinity is lower with the mid-chain branched surfactant resulting in stability at lower temperatures as compared to linear surfactants.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferable that the surfactant paste be substantially free of materials which produces a gas when reacted with an acid. Such materials include carbonates, percarbonates, perborates or any other material which produces a gas upon contact with an acidic material. While not intending to be bound by theory, it is hypothesized that if the surfactant paste includes such a gas-producing material, it will react with any acidic contaminant material to produce a gas that propagates through the remaining surfactant paste, thereby creating a "channel" or "path" through which the acidic contaminant can traverse the paste. This facilitates the hydrolysis reaction of the entire surfactant paste as opposed to only a small isolated hydrolysis incident which would not otherwise affect the overall surfactant paste composition.  Also in this regard, it is preferable in the current process to maintain the surfactant paste substantially free of contaminant materials having a pH of less than about 7.<br>
In the next step of the process, the surfactant paste is charged into a high speed mixer/densifier (e.g. L6dige Recycler CB 30) which typically operates in 300 rpm to about 2500 rpm range. In this step, from about 25% to about 65%, more preferably 30% to about 60%, and most preferably from about 35% to about 60%, by weight of the surfactant paste,<br>
is used in the process to make the agglomerates. Also, from about 1% to about 70%, more<br>
preferably from about 5% to about 70% and, most preferably from about 40% to about 70%,<br>
by weight of a detergency builder is inputted into the high speed mixer/densifier. -Although other builders can be used in the process as described hereinafter, aluminosilicate builder is the preferred.<br>
The surfactant paste and the builder are agglomerated by treating the paste and the builder initially in the high speed mixer/densifier and subsequently in a moderate speed mixer/densifier (e.g. Lodige Recycler KM 300 "Ploughshare" having a large central shaft operating in the 100 rpm to 300 rpm range) so as to form detergent agglomerates. Other equipment suitable for use as the high speed mixer/densifier or moderate speed mixer/densifier are described in Capeci, U.S. Patent 5,366,652, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Optionally, other conventional detergent ingredients as described hereinafter can also be inputted into the high speed mixer/densifier and/or moderate speed mixer/densifier to make a fully formulated detergent agglomerate.<br>
The surfactant paste, builder and other optional starting detergent materials are sent to a moderate speed mixer/densifier for further build-up agglomeration resulting in agglomerates having a density of at least 650 g/1 and, more preferably from about 700 g/1 to about 900 g/1. Preferably, the mean residence time of the surfactant paste and other starting detergent materials in the high speed mixer/densifier (e.g. Lodige Recycler CB 30 mixer/densifier) is from about 1 to 30 seconds while the residence time in low or moderate speed mixer/densifier (e.g. L6dige Recycler KM 300 "Ploughshare" mixer/densifier) is from about 0.1 to 15 minutes, preferably at about 0.5 minutes.<br>
Inevitably, a certain amount of the agglomerates exiting the moderate speed mixer/densifier will be below the predetermined particle size range and optionally, can be separated and recycled back to the high speed mixer/densifier for further build-up agglomeration. In that regard, these so-called undersized agglomerates or "fines" will comprise from about 5% to about 30% by weight of the detergent agglomerates. The particle porosity of the resulting detergent agglomerates produced according to the process of the invention is preferably in a range from about 5% to about 20%, more preferably at about 10%. The combination of the above-referenced porosity and particle size results in agglomerates having density values of 650 g/1 and higher. Such a feature is especially useful in the production of low dosage laundry detergents as well as other granular compositions such as dishwashing compositions.<br>
The process can comprise the steps of spraying an additional binder in the mixer/densifier(s) used in the agglomeration step to facilitate production of the desired detergent agglomerates. A binder is added for purposes of enhancing agglomeration by providing a "binding" or "sticking" agent for the detergent components. The binder is preferably selected from the group consisting of water, anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, polyethylene glycol, polyacrylates, citric acid and mixtures thereof. Other suitable binder materials including those listed herein are described in Beerse et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,108,646 (Procter &amp; Gamble Co.), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Another optional step contemplated by the present process includes conditioning the detergent agglomerates by drying the detergent agglomerates after the moderate speed mixer/densifier. Yet another optional step involves adding a coating agent (e.g. aluminosilicates, carbonates, sulfates, or any other dry powdered material) to the detergent agglomerate before or after they exit the moderate speed mixer/densifier for purposes of enhancing the flowability of the agglomerates (i.e. reduce caking). This furthers enhances the condition of the detergent agglomerates for use as an additive or to place them in shippable or packagable form. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that a wide variety of methods may be used to dry as well as cool the exiting detergent agglomerates without departing from the scope of the invention. By way of example, apparatus such as a fluidized bed can be used for drying while an airlift can be used for cooling should it be necessary.<br>
Surfactant Paste<br>
The viscoelastic surfactant paste used herein has viscoelastic fluid properties which can be described by a commonly used mathematical model that accounts for the shear thinning .nature of the paste. The mathematical model is called the Power Law Model and is described by the following relation:<br>
a = Kyn<br>
where a = Shear Stress (dynes/cm2), K = Consistency (Poise-sec0'1),  = Shear Rate (sec'1), and n = Rate Index (dimension less). The rate index n varies from 0 to 1. The closer n is to 0, the more shear thinning the fluid. The closer n is to 1, the closer it is to simple Newtonian behavior, i.e.<br>
constant viscosity behavior. K can be interpreted as the apparent viscosity at a shear rate of 1 sec' 1<br>
In this context, the viscoelastic surfactant paste used in the process has a consistency K at 70°C of from about 50,000 to about 250,000 cPoise-sec"'1 (500 to 2,500 Poise-sec11-1), more preferably from about 100,000 to about 195,000 cPoise-sec"'1 (1,000 to 1,950 Poise-sec"'1), and most preferably from about 120,000 to about 180,000 cPoise-sec"'1 (1,200 to 1,800 Poise-sec0'1). Preferably, the surfactant paste has a shear index n of from about 0.05 to about 0.25, more preferably from about 0.08 to about 0.20 and most preferably from about 0.10 to about 0.15.<br>
The surfactant paste includes surfactant mixtures comprising mid-chain branched surfactant compounds as described herein before. In such compositions, certain points of branching (e.g., the location along the chain of the R, R1, and/or R2 moieties in the above formula) are preferred over other points of branching along the backbone of the surfactant. The formula below illustrates the mid-chain branching range (i.e., where points of. branching occur), preferred mid-chain branching range, and more preferred mid-chain branching range for mono-methyl branched alkyl Ab moieties useful according to the present invention.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
It should be noted that for the mono-methyl substituted surfactants these ranges exclude the two terminal carbon atoms of the chain and the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the -X - B group.<br>
The formula below illustrates the mid-chain branching range, preferred mid-chain branching range, and more preferred mid-chain branching range for di-methyl substituted alkyl A moieties useful according to the present invention.<br>

(3) Mid-chain Branched Primary Alkyl Alkoxylated Sulfate Surfactants<br>
The present invention branched surfactant compositions may comprise one or more (preferably a mixture of two or more) mid-chain branched primary alkyl alkoxylated sulfates having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The surfactant mixtures of the present invention comprise molecules having a linear primary alkoxylated sulfate chain backbone (i.e., the longest linear carbon chain which includes the alkoxy-sulfated carbon atom). These alkyl chain backbones comprise<br>
from 12 to 19 carbon atoms; and further the molecules comprise a branched primary alkyl moiety having at least a total of 14, but not more than 20, carbon atoms. In addition, the surfactant mixture has an average total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary alkyl moieties within the range of from greater than 14.5 to about 17.5. Thus, the present invention mixtures comprise at least one alkoxylated sulfate compound having a longest linear carbon chain of not less than 12 carbon atoms or more than 19 carbon atoms, and the total number of carbon atoms including branching must be at least 14, and further the average total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary alkyl chains is within the range of greater than 14.5 to about 17.5.<br>
For example, a C16 total carbon (in the alkyl chain) primary alkyl alkoxylated sulfate surfactant having 15 carbon atoms in the backbone must have a methyl branching unit (either R, R.1 or R.2 is methyl) whereby the total number of carbon atoms in the primary alkyl moiety of the molecule is 16.<br>
R, R.1, and R.2 are each independently selected from hydrogen and C1-C3 alkyl (preferably hydrogen or C1-C2 alkyl, more preferably hydrogen or methyl, and most preferably methyl), provided R, R.1, and R2 are not all hydrogen. Further, when z is 1, at least R or R' is not hydrogen.<br>
Although for the purposes of the present invention surfactant compositions the above formula does not include molecules wherein the units R, R1, and R2 are all hydrogen (i.e., linear non-branched primary alkoxylated sulfates), it is to be recognized that the present invention compositions may still further comprise some amount of linear, non-branched primary alkoxylated sulfate. Further, this linear non-branched primary alkoxylated sulfate surfactant may be present as the result of the process used to manufacture the surfactant mixture having the requisite mid-chain branched primary alkoxylated sulfates according to the present invention, or for purposes of formulating detergent compositions some amount of linear non-branched primary alkoxylated sulfate may be admixed into the final product formulation.<br>
It is also to be recognized that some amount of mid-chain branched alkyl sulfate may be present in the compositions. This is typically the result of sulfation of non-alkoxylated alcohol remaining following incomplete alkoxylation of the mid-chain branched alcohol used to prepare the alkoxylated sulfate useful herein. It is to be recognized, however, that separate addition of such mid-chain branched alkyl sulfates is<br>
also contemplated by the present invention compositions.<br>
Further it is to be similarly recognized that non-sulfated mid-chain branched alcohol (including polyoxyalkylene alcohols) may comprise some amount of the present invention alkoxylated sulfate-containing compositions. Such materials may be present as the result of incomplete sulfation of the alcohol (alkoxylated or non-alkoxylated) used to<br>
prepare the alkoxylated sulfate surfactant, or these alcohols may be separately added to the present invention detergent compositions along with a mid-chain branched alkoxylated sulfate surfactant according to the present invention.<br>

Further regarding the above formula, w is an integer from 0 to 13; x is an integer from 0 to 13; y is an integer from 0 to 13; z is an integer of at least 1; and w + x + y + zis an integer from 8 to 14.<br>

Detergency Builder<br>
The present process includes the step of inputting a detergent builder into the high speed mixer/densifier to coagglomerate with the surfactant paste. The builder also assists in controlling mineral, especially Ca and/or Mg, hardness in wash water or to assist in the removal of particulate soils from surfaces. Builders can operate via a variety of mechanisms including forming soluble or insoluble complexes with hardness ions, by ion exchange, and by offering a surface more favorable to the precipitation of hardness ions than are the surfaces of articles to be cleaned. Builder level can vary widely depending upon end use and physical form of the composition. Built detergents typically comprise at least about 1% builder. Liquid formulations typically comprise about 5% to about 50%, more typically 5% to 35% of builder. Granular formulations typically comprise from about 10% to about 80%, more typically 15% to 50% builder by weight of the detergent composition. Lower or higher levels of builders are not excluded. For example, certain detergent additive or high-surfactant formulations can be unbuilt.<br>
Suitable builders herein can be selected from the group consisting of phosphates and polyphosphates, especially the sodium salts; silicates including water-soluble and hydrous solid types and including those having chain-, layer-, or three-dimensional- structure as well as amorphous-solid or non-structured-liquid types; carbonates, bicarbonates, sesquicarbonates and carbonate minerals other than sodium carbonate or sesquicarbonate; aluminosilicates; organic mono-, di-, tri-, and tetracarboxylates especially water-soluble nonsurfactant carboxylates in acid, sodium, potassium or alkanolammonium salt form, as well as oligomeric or water-soluble low molecular weight polymer carboxylates including aliphatic and aromatic types; and phytic acid. These may be complemented by borates, e.g., for pH-buffering purposes, or by sulfates, especially sodium sulfate and any other fillers or carriers which may be important to the engineering of stable surfactant and/or builder-containing detergent compositions.<br>
Builder mixtures, sometimes termed "builder systems" can be used and typically comprise two or more conventional builders, optionally complemented by chelants, pH-buffers or fillers, though these latter materials are generally accounted for separately when describing quantities of materials herein. In terms of relative quantities of surfactant and<br>
builder in the present detergents, preferred builder systems are typically formulated at a weight ratio of surfactant to builder of from about 60:1 to about 1:80. Certain preferred laundry detergents have said ratio in the range 0.90:1.0 to 4.0:1.0, more preferably from 0.95:1.0 to 3.0:1.0.<br>

Layered silicates from Hoechst also include NaSKS-5, NaSKS-7 and NaSKS-11, as the a, p and y layer-silicate forms. Other silicates may also be useful, such as magnesium silicate, which can serve as a crispening agent in granules, as a stabilizing agent for bleaches, and as a component of suds control systems.<br>

empirical formula: [Mz(AlO2)z(SiO2)v]xH2O wherein z and v are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to v is in the range from 1.0 to 0.5, and x is an integer from 15 to 264. Aluminosilicates can be crystalline or amorphous, naturally-occurring or synthetically derived. An aluminosilicate production method is in U.S. 3,985,669, Krummel, et al., October 12, 1976. Preferred synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are available as Zeolite A, Zeolite P (B), Zeolite X and, to whatever extent this differs from Zeolite P, the so-called Zeolite MAP. Natural types, including clinoptilolite, may be used. Zeolite A has the formula: Na12(A1O2)(SiO2)12]'xH2O wherein x is from 20 to 30, especially 27. Dehydrated zeolites (x = 0 - 10) may also be used. Preferably, the aluminosilicate has a particle size of 0.1-10 microns in diameter.<br>
Suitable organic detergent builders include polycarboxylate compounds, including water-soluble nonsurfactant dicarboxylates and tricarboxylates. More typically builder polycarboxylates have a plurality of carboxylate groups, preferably at least 3 carboxylates. Carboxylate builders can be formulated in acid, partially neutral, neutral or overbased form. When in salt form, alkali metals, such as sodium, potassium, and lithium, or alkanolammonium salts are preferred. Polycarboxylate builders include the ether polycarboxylates, such as oxydisuccinate, see Berg, U.S. 3,128,287, April 7, 1964, and Lamberti et al, U.S. 3,635,830, January 18, 1972; "TMS/TDS" builders of U.S. 4,663,071, Bush et al, May 5, 1987; and other ether carboxylates including cyclic and alicyclic compounds, such as those described in U.S. Patents 3,923,679; 3,835,163; 4,158,635; 4,120,874 and 4,102,903.<br>
Other suitable builders are the ether hydroxypolycarboxylates, copolymers of maleic anhydride with ethylene or vinyl methyl ether; 1, 3, 5-trihydroxy benzene-2, 4, 6-trisulphonic acid; carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid; the various alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of polyacetic acids such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid; as well as mellitic acid, succinic acid, polymaleic acid, benzene l,3,5-tricarboxylic acid, carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, and soluble salts thereof.<br>
Citrates, e.g., citric acid and soluble salts thereof are important carboxylate builders e.g., for heavy duty liquid detergents, due to availability from renewable resources and biodegradability. Citrates can also be used in granular compositions, especially in combination with zeolite and/or layered silicates. Oxydisuccinates are also especially useful in such compositions and combinations.<br>
Where permitted, and especially in the formulation of bars used for hand-laundering operations, alkali metal phosphates such as sodium tripolyphosphates, sodium   -pyrophosphate and sodium orthophosphate can be used. Phosphonate builders such as ethane-l-hydroxy-l,l-diphosphonate and other known phosphonates, e.g., those of U.S.<br>
3,159,581; 3,213,030; 3,422,021; 3,400,148 and 3,422,137 can also be used and may have desirable antiscaling properties.<br>
Certain detersive surfactants or their short-chain homologs also have a builder action. For unambiguous formula accounting purposes, when they have surfactant capability, these materials are summed up as detersive surfactants. Preferred types for builder functionality are illustrated by: 3,3-dicarboxy-4-oxa-l,6-hexanedioates and the related compounds disclosed in U.S. 4,566,984, Bush, January 28, 1986. Succinic acid builders include the C5-C20 alkyl and alkenyl succinic acids and salts thereof. Succinate builders also include: laurylsuccinate, myristylsuccinate, palmitylsuccinate, 2-dodecenylsuccinate (preferred), 2-pentadecenylsuccinate, and the like. Lauryl-succinates are described in European Patent Application 86200690.5/0,200,263, published November 5, 1986. Fatty acids, e.g., C12-C18 monocarboxylic acids, can also be incorporated into the compositions as surfactant/builder materials alone or in combination with the aforementioned builders, especially citrate and/or the succinate builders, to provide additional builder activity. Other suitable polycarboxylates are disclosed in U.S. 4,144,226, Crutchfield et al, March 13, 1979 and in U.S. 3,308,067, Diehl, March 7, 1967. See also Diehl, U.S. 3,723,322.<br>
Optionally, inorganic builder materials can be used which have the formula (Mx)j Cay (CO3)Z wherein x and i are integers from 1 to 15, y is an integer from 1 to 10, z is an integer from 2 to 25, Mi are cations, at least one of which is a water-soluble, and the equation  = 1-15(xj multiplied by the valence of Mi) + 2y = 2z is satisfied such that the formula has a neutral or "balanced" charge. Waters of hydration or anions other than carbonate may be added provided that the overall charge is balanced or neutral. The charge or valence effects of such anions should be added to the right side of the above equation. Preferably, there is present a water-soluble cation selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, water-soluble metals, hydrogen, boron, ammonium, silicon, and mixtures thereof, more preferably, sodium, potassium, hydrogen, lithium, ammonium and mixtures thereof, sodium and potassium being highly preferred. Nonlimiting examples of noncarbonate anions include those selected from the group consisting of chloride, sulfate, fluoride, oxygen, hydroxide, silicon dioxide, chromate, nitrate, borate and mixtures thereof. Preferred builders of this type in their simplest forms are selected from the group consisting of Na2Ca(CO3)2, K2Ca(CO3)2, Na2Ca2(CO3)3, NaKCa(CO3)2, NaKCa2(CO3)3, K2Ca2(CO3)3, and combinations thereof. An especially preferred material for the builder described herein is Na2Ca(CO3)2 in any of its crystalline modifications. Suitable builders of the above-defined type are further illustrated by, and include, the natural or synthetic forms of any one or combinations of the following minerals: Afghanite, Andersonite, AshcroftineY, Beyerite, Borcarite, Burbankite, Butschliite, Cancrinite, Carbocernaite, Carletonite, Davyne, DonnayiteY, Fairchildite, Ferrisurite, Franzinite, Gaudefroyite,<br>

In order to make the present invention more readily understood, reference is made to the following examples, which are intended to be illustrative only and not intended to be limiting in scope.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
This Example illustrates the process invention described and claimed herein. The percentages are on a weight basis, in the mixes prior to any subsequent follow-up drying, unless other wise specified. The terms "BAS", "LAS" and "AS" as used herein mean, respectively, "mid-chain branched alkyl sulfate", "sodium linear alkylbenzene sulfonate" and "sodium alkyl sulfate." Several surfactant pastes consisting of C16.5BAS, C14-15AS and C12.3 LAS are made by sulfating C16-18, alcohol, C14-15 alcohol with SO3 and co-neutralizing with C12.5HLAS using 50% caustic soda (sodium hydroxide). The specific compositions of the surfactant pastes are set forth in Table I.<br>
Table I<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
A falling film SO3 reactor is used to prepare the acid form of C16.5BAS, C14-15 AS and C12.3 LAS. The acid is fed to a high active neutralization system which consists of a recycle loop containing a heat exchanger for cooling, a recirculation pump suitable for highly viscous fluids, and a high shear mixer with which the reactants are introduced. Surfactant paste exiting the high active neutralization system is transported and stored in jacketed, temperature-controlled 316L stainless steel storage vessels at a temperature of 71c C.    The surfactant paste remains stable and maintains a pH above 10 for at least five days (120 hours). The temperature of the paste is maintained between 65°C to about 70°C by the circulation of glycol solution through the vessel jacketing.<br>
Two feed streams of various detergent starting ingredients are continuously fed, at a rate of 2800 kg/hr, into a Lodige CB-30 mixer/densifier, one of which comprises the surfactant paste and the other stream containing the detergent builder which is aluminosilicate. The surfactant paste, aluminosilicate and optional co-builder sodium carbonate are agglomerated to form detergent agglomerates. The detergent agglomerates from the Lodige CB-30 mixer/densifier are continuously fed into a L6dige KM-600 mixer/densifier for further agglomeration. The resulting detergent agglomerates are then fed to optional conditioning apparatus including a fluid bed dryer and a fluid bed cooler. The detergent agglomerates exiting the fluid bed cooler are screened, after which adjunct detergent ingredients are admixed therewith to result in a fully formulated detergent product having a uniform particle size distribution.<br>
The composition of the detergent agglomerates exiting the fluid bed cooler is set forth in Table II below:<br>
Table II<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
lC16.5BAS and one or both of C14-15 AS and C12.3 LAS<br>
