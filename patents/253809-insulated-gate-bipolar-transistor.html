New IGBT cathode design with improved safe operating area capability<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to the field of semiconductor devices. It relates in particular to an insulated gate bipolar transistor as described in the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Prior Art<br>
To achieve improved safe operating area (SOA) capability in insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), a deep, highly doped p+ base region is often introduced for an increased latch-up current during device turn-off. "Deep" in this context refers to the fact that a first depth of the highly doped p+ base region is bigger than a second depth of a channel region of the IGBT. The deep p+ base region performs the following main tasks during a turn-off of the IGBT:<br>
Firstly, it efficiently collects holes during the turn-off. As a consequence, the number of holes that enter a drift re-<br><br><br>
gion of the IGBT via a channel of the IGBT is minimized. Early parasitic thyristor latch-up is thus prevented.<br>
Secondly, by extending the p+ base region laterally, it protects n+ source regions of the IGBT by minimising a resistance under those regions and by reducing an injection of electrons from the n+ sources- This will also reduce any parasitic thyristor latch-up effects.<br>
To add the deep p+-well, an additional process mask is used. Accurate alignment of the deep p+ well relative to the n+ source regions and thus of the additional process mask is crucial for achieving the aspects described above.<br>
To overcome this problem, shallow p+-regions have been introduced. While those can be diffused through the same mask as the n+ source regions, thus eliminating alignment problems, SOA capability of the resulting IGBTs is reduced at high voltages.<br>
In US 5023191 a method for manufacturing an IGBT structure with two partially overlapping p+ base regions, both of which are to extend underneath the n+ source regions, i.e. to be brought close to a channel side edge of said n* source regions .<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide an insulated gate semiconductor device of the type mentioned initially that overcomes the deficiencies mentioned above.<br>
This object is achieved by an insulated gate semiconductor device according to claim 1.<br><br>
In an insulated gate semiconductor device according to the in vention, a first base region of first conductivity type is disposed in a channel region of first conductivity type formed in a semiconductor substrate, so that said first base region encompasses the IGBT source regions, but does not adjoin a top surface underneath the gate insulation film. In addition, a second base region of first conductivity type is disposed in the semiconductor substrate underneath a base contact area, said base contact area being delimited by one or more source regions, so that the second base region partially overlaps the channel region and the first base region.<br>
By laterally confining the second base region to a region underneath the base contact area, the location of the highest electric field during turn-off is shifted away from a periphery of the channel region to a region under the base contact area, A fraction of avalanche generated holes that enter the cell via the channel is therefore decreased, and early latch-up is thus prevented-<br>
Further advantageous realizations can be found in the dependent claims.<br>

Approaches to Realization of the Invention<br>
Fig. 1 shows a cross section of an IGBT according to the invention. A bottom metallization layer 1 is disposed on a bottom surface of a silicon semiconductor substrate 2. A p doped emitter layer 21 is disposed in the semiconductor substrate 2 and adjoins the bottom surface* Adjoining the emitter layer 21 is an n doped drift region 22. A gate oxide film 41 with a contact opening is disposed on the top surface of the semiconductor substrate 2. A polysilicon gate electrode 5 is formed on top of the gate oxide film 41 and covered by a silicon oxide insula-tion layer 42. A p doped channel region 7 is disposed in the drift region 22 and adjoins the top surface underneath the contact opening and underneath part of the gate oxide film 41. Disposed in the channel region 7 are one or more n+ doped source regions 6 which delimit a base contact area 821. A top metallization layer 9 covers the oxide insulation layer 42 and<br><br>
the contact opening. In an on-state of the IGBT, an electrically conducting channel is formed underneath the gate oxide film 41 between the one or more source regions 6 and the drift region 22.<br>
A first p+ doped base region 81 is disposed in the channel re-gion 7 so that it encloses the one or more source regions 6, but does not adjoin the top surface underneath the gate oxide film 41. In other words, the one or more source regions 6, the first base region 81 and the channel region 7 form at least one common boundary line on the top surface of the semiconductor substrate 2.<br>
A second p+ doped base region 82 is disposed in the semiconductor substrate underneath the base contact region. This' second base region 82 is narrower and deeper than the first base region 81, so that the first and the second base regions partially overlap one another.<br>
Laterally confining the second base region 82 to a region underneath the base contact area 821 ensures that an avalanche point, i.e. a location of the highest electric field during turn-off, on a first p-n-junction between the channel region 7 and the drift region 22. is more concentrated away from, a periphery of channel region 7, resulting in most of the avalanche generated holes not entering the cell via the channel, which would cause early latch-up. As shown in Fig 1 base region 82 laterally does not extend or overlaps the two source regions 6<br>
in a preferred embodiment of the invention, a depth de2 of the second base region 82 exceeds a depth dc of the channel region 7 by at least a factor of 1.5, i.e. da2 &gt; 1.5 dc. As a consequence, a radius of curvature rb2z  of a second p-n-junction between the second base region 82 and the drift region 22 is smaller than a radius of curvature rc of the first p-n-junction between the channel region 7 and the drift region 22. As a con-<br><br>
sequence, the avalanche point is shifted even further away from -the periphery of channel region 7.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the IGBT according to ■ the invention, a doping concentration pbi of the first base region 81 and a doping concentration Pb2 of the second base region 82 are at least 5 times higher than a doping concentration pc of the channel region 7r i.e. pa1 &gt; 5.0 pc1, PBZ &gt; 5.0 pc. The larger doping concentration PB1 of the first base region 81 will provide a much higher rate of hole collection at a centre of the IGBT underneath the base contact area 821 and away from a critical exposed point of the one or more source regions 6 near the edge of the contact opening. The rest of the one or more source regions 6 is protected by the first base region 81. Furthermore, due to the higher doping concentration pBi of the first base region 81, a higher hole drain at the centre of the IGBT and the smaller radius of curvature rB2 will result in a much larger peak field. Hence the main dynamic avalanche point occurs near a periphery of the first base region 81 under the base contact area 821 and away from the critical curvature of the first p-n-junction between the channel region 7 and the drift region 22.<br>
Fig. 2a shows a cross section along line A-B through the IGBT from Fig, 1 in a first configuration with an essentially circular layout of the p doped channel region 7, the first p+ doped base region 81, the second p+ doped base region 82 and an annular source region 6.<br>
Fig. 2b shows a cross section along line A-B through the IGBT from Fig. 1 in a second configuration in which the p doped channel region 7, the first p+ doped base region 81 and the second p* doped base region 82 r and the two source regions 6 are strip shaped.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a cross section of another preferred embodiment of an IGBT according to the invention. A field oxide layer 43 is<br>
27.03.2006<br><br>
disposed on top of the gate oxide layer 41 at a distance d from the edge of the contact opening. This results in a second avalanche region near an edge of the field oxide layer 43, which in turn.reduces an.amount of avalanche generated carriers in a neighbourhood of the channel region 7. The smaller the distance d from the edge of the field oxide layer 43 to the contact opening, the higher the avalanche level at the edge of the field oxide layer 43£ thus providing increased latch-up current. However, if the distance d becomes too small, this will impact the on-state losses and breakdown voltages. Preferably, values for the distance from the field oxide edge to the contact opening range from 8-10 µ m. Values in that range have no major impact on other device parameters.<br>
The IGBT embodiments described above have one protection scheme for increased latch up current of a parasitic thyristor as shown in Fig. 4. The protection from cell latch-up is enhanced with the added two p+1 regions 81, 82 in terms of:<br>
a)	avalanche peak cell centre positioning,<br>
b)	enhanced hole collection at the cell, and<br>
c)	n+ source protection.<br>
All three are incorporated in one design with no critical mask alignment issues.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a cross section of another preferred embodiment of an IGBT according to the invention. An n-doped protection region 221 is disposed near an edge of the channel region 7 in the drift region underneath the gate oxide layer 41, so that it adjoins both the channel region 7 and the top surface of the semiconductor substrate 2. This IGBT has two protection schemes for increased latch up current of a parasitic thyristor as shown in Fig. 6. With the embodiment shown in Fig. 6 the cell latch up is improved using the p4 regions 81, 82 plus the n-doped region 221 at the cell edge. This added n-region 221 acts as a hole barrier and will further reduce the number of holes<br><br>
entering the cell at the channel edge where the latch-up is more likely to occur. Therefore forcing holes to enter from the cell central position.<br><br>
