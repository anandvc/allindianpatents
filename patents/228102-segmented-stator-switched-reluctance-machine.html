				<td>SEGMENTED STATOR SWICHED RELUCTANCE MACHINE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention relates to electric machines and, more<br>
particularly, to a switched reluctance electric machine including a segmented<br>
staler.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Reluctance electric machines, such as motors and generators,<br>
typically include a stator that is mounted inside a machine housing and a rotor<br>
that is supported for rotation relative to the stator. Reluctance electric<br>
machines produce torque as a result of the rotor tending to rotate to a position<br>
that minimizes the reluctance of the magnetic circuit and maximizes the<br>
inductance of an energized winding of the stator. A drive circuit generates a<br>
set of stator winding currents that are output to stator pole windings and that<br>
produce a magnetic field. In response to the magnetic field, the rotor rotates<br>
in an attempt to maximize the inductance of the energized winding of the<br>
stator.<br>
[0003] In synchronous reluctance electric machines, the windings are<br>
energized at a controlled frequency. Control circuitry and/or transducers are<br>
provided for detecting the angular position of the rotor. A drive circuit<br>
energizes the stator windings as a function of the sensed rotor position. The<br>
design and operation of sensoriess switched reluctance electric machines is<br>
known in the art and is discussed in T.J.E. Miller, "Switched Reluctance<br>
Motors and Their Control", Magna Physics Publishing and Clarendon Press,<br>
Oxford, 1993, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
[0004] Conventional switched reluctance electric machines generally<br>
include a stator with a solid stator core or a laminated stator with a plurality of<br>
circular stator plates that are punched from a magnetically conducting<br>
material and that are stacked together. The stator plates define salient stator<br>
poles that project radially inward and inter-polar slots that are located between<br>
the adjacent stator poles. The stator typically includes pairs of diametrically<br><br>
opposed stator poles. The rotor also typically Includes pairs of diametrically<br>
opposed rotor poles. Windings or coils are wound around the stator poles.<br>
The windings that are wound around the pairs of diametrically opposed stator<br>
poles are connected to define a phase coil.<br>
[0005] By providing current in the phase coil, magnetic fields are<br>
established in the stator poles that attract a pair of the rotor poles. The<br>
current in the phase coils is generated in a predetermined sequence in order<br>
to produce torque on the rotor. The period during which current is provided to<br>
the phase coil, while the rotor poles are brought into alignment with the stator<br>
poles, is known as the active stage of the phase con.<br>
[0006] At a predetermined point, either as the rotor poles become<br>
aligned with the stator poles or at some point prior thereto, the current in the<br>
phase coil is commutated to prevent a negative torque from acting on the<br>
rotor poles. Once the commutation point is reached, current is no longer<br>
output to the phase coil and the current is allowed to dissipate. The period<br>
during which current is allowed to dissipate is known as the inactive stage.<br>
[0007] In order to maintain torque on the rotor, to thereby optimize<br>
machine efficiency, it is important to maintain the relationship between the<br>
position of the rotor and the active stage of each phase coil. If the active<br>
stage is initiated and/or commutated too early or too late with respect to the<br>
position of the rotor, a constant torque on the rotor will not be maintained and<br>
the machine wil not operate at an optimum efficiency. Conventional switched<br>
reluctance electric machines attempt to maintain the relationship between the<br>
active stages of the phase coils and the position of the rotor by continuously<br>
sensing rotor position.<br>
[0008] There are two distinct approaches for detecting the angular<br>
position of the rotor, in a "sensed" approach, an external physical sensor<br>
senses the angular position of the rotor. For example, a rotor position<br>
transducer (RPT) with a hall effect sensor or an optical sensor physically<br>
senses the angular position of the rotor. In a "sensorless" approach,<br>
electronics that are associated with the drive circuit derive the angular rotor<br>
position without an external physical sensor. For example, the rotor position<br><br>
can be derived by measuring the back electromotive force (EMF) in an<br>
unenergized winding. In U. S. Patent Nos. 6,107.772, 6,011,368 to Kalpathi et<br>
al, 5,982,117 to Taylor et al, 5,929,590 to Tang et al, 5,883,485. to Mehlhom,<br>
5,877,568 to Maes et al, 5,777,416 to Kotometsev, and 4.772,839 to<br>
MacMinn, which are hereby incorporated by reference, a drive circuit<br>
estimates the rotor position from the inductance of the phase coil.<br>
[0009] Another sensorless approach outputs diagnostic pulses to the<br>
unenergized windings and senses the resulting electrical response. For<br>
example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,959,596 to MacMinn, et al., and 5,589,518 to<br>
Vrtunic, which are hereby incorporated by reference, a drive circuit employs<br>
voltage sensing pulses that are output to an inactive phase coil.<br>
[0010] in switched reluctance electric machines using the "sensed"<br>
approach, the RPT detects the angular position of the rotor with respect to the<br>
stator. The RPT provides an angular position signal to the drive circuit that<br>
energizes the windings of the switched reluctance electric machine. The RPT<br>
typically includes a sensor board with one or more sensors and a shutter that<br>
is coupled to and rotates with the shaft of the rotor. The shutter includes a<br>
plurality of shutter teeth that pass through optical sensors as the rotor rotates.<br>
[0011] Because rotor position information is critical to proper<br>
operation of the switched reluctance electric machine, sophisticated alignment<br>
techniques are used to ensure that the sensor board of the RPT is properly<br>
positioned with respect to the housing and the stator. Misalignment of the<br>
sensor board is known to degrade the performance of the electric machine.<br>
Unfortunately, utilization of these complex alignment techniques increases the<br>
manufacturing costs for switched reluctance electric machines equipped with<br>
RPTs.<br>
[0012] The RPTs also increase the overall size of the switched<br>
reluctance electric machine, which can adversely impact machine and product<br>
packaging requirements. The costs of the RPTs often place switched<br>
reluctance electric machines at a competitive disadvantage in applications<br>
that are suitable for open-loop induction electric machines that do not require<br>
RPTs.<br><br>
[0013] Another drawback with RPTs involves field servicing of the<br>
switched reluctance electric machines. Specifically, wear elements, such as<br>
the bearings, that are located within the enclosed rotor housing may need to<br>
be repaired or replaced. To reach the wear elements, an end shield must be<br>
removed from the housing. Because alignment of the sensor board is<br>
important, replacement of the end shield often requires the use of complex<br>
realignment techniques. When the service technician improperly performs the<br>
alignment techniques, the sensor board is misaligned and the motor's<br>
performance is adversely impacted.<br>
[0014] When sensing the angular rotor position using the "sensorless"<br>
approach, variations in the electrical characteristics of the individual stator<br>
pole windings can adversely impact the ability of the sensorless drive circuits<br>
to correctly derive the angular rotor position. Most of the sensorless<br>
approaches measure the resistance and/or inductance of the windings. If the<br>
resistance and/or inductance varies from one stator winding to another, the<br>
drive circuit may incorrectly determine the angular rotor position.<br>
[0015] There are several conventional methods for placing the<br>
winding wire on the stator of a switched reluctance electric machine. The<br>
winding wire can be initially wound and transferred onto the stator poles.<br>
Transfer winding tends to leave excess winding wire or loops around axial<br>
ends of the stator poles. Transfer winding can typically utilize approximately<br>
60-65% of available stator slot area. Needle winding employs a needle that<br>
winds the wire directly on the stator poles. The needle, however, takes up<br>
some of the stator slot area, which reduces slot fill to approximately 50%. The<br>
positioning of winding wire on the stator poles using these methods varies<br>
from one stator pole to the next. Winding creep and other assembly<br>
variations also impact the inductance and resistance of the winding wire over<br>
time, which makes it difficult to accurately perform "sensorless" control due to<br>
the non-conformity of the salient stator poles.<br>
[0016] It is difficult to hold the winding wire in place during wrapping<br>
and forming of the windings. This is particularly true for salient stator poles of<br>
reluctance machines that typically have teeth with parallel sides that do not<br><br>
hold the winding wire very well. Tangs or circumferential projections have<br>
been used on the radially inner ends of the salient stator poles to provide a<br>
stop surface to retain the winding wire in place. The tangs limit a slot opening<br>
dimension between adjacent salient poles. As the size of the tangs increases,<br>
the ability of the tangs to retain the winding wire improves. However, as the<br>
size of the tangs increases and the slot opening dimension decreases, it<br>
becomes more difficult or impossible to employ the conventional needle and<br>
transfer winding methods. Widening of the tangs may also compromise<br>
performance. In addition to retaining the winding wire, there are other<br>
electrical reasons for widening the tangs, which would be precluded by these<br>
winding methods.<br>
[0017] When using needle and transfer winding methods, the position<br>
of winding wire on the stator poles varies from one stator pole to the next and<br>
from one electric machine to the next. In other words, the individual winding<br>
turns are positioned differently and the cross sectional pattern of the stator<br>
pole windings is different. As a result, the inductance and resistance of the<br>
stator pole windings often vary from one stator pole to the next even though<br>
the same number of winding turns are used.<br>
[0018] While the design of switched reluctance electric machines is<br>
relatively mature, there are several areas requiring improvement. Specifically, it<br>
is desirable to improve the torque density of switched reluctance electric<br>
machines. By increasing the torque density, the size of the switched reluctance<br>
electric machine can be reduced for a given torque output and/or the size can<br>
be maintained with an increase in torque output Electrical machines achieving<br>
higher torque density will allow designers of products equipped with switched<br>
reluctance electrical machines greater flexibility in product design that may lead<br>
to increased sales through product differentiation and/or improved profit<br>
margins.<br>
[0019] It is also desirable to eliminate the need for RPTs in switched<br>
reluctance electric machines. It is also desirable to assemble the stator of a<br>
switched reluctance electric machine in a highly uniform and repeatable manner<br><br>
to improve the performance of sensorless switched reluctance motors by<br>
reducing variations in the inductance and resistance of the stator.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0020] A switched reluctance machine according to the invention<br>
includes a rotor and a segmented stator having a plurality of stator segment<br>
assemblies. The stator segment assemblies define salient stator poles and<br>
inter-polar stator slots. Each of the stator segment assemblies includes a stator<br>
segment core, an end cap assembly attached to opposite axial end surfaces of<br>
the stator segment core, and winding wire that is wound around the stator<br>
segment core and the end cap assembly. The rotor defines a plurality of rotor<br>
poles. The rotor tends to rotate relative to the stator to maximize the inductance<br>
of an energized winding. A drive circuit energizes the winding wire around the<br>
stator segment assemblies based on the rotational position of the rotor.<br>
[0021] According to other features of the invention, each stator plate<br>
has an outer rim section and a tooth section. The end cap assembly includes a<br>
pair of end caps that are secured to opposite ends of the stator segment core,<br>
and a pair of retainer plates interconnecting the end caps on opposite sides of<br>
the stator segment core. The end cap assembly defines an annular retention<br>
channel within which the winding wire is wound. The retention channel<br>
facilitates improved precision in the winding process and tends to reduce<br>
winding creep during use.<br>
[0022] By providing a segmented stator, the present invention improves<br>
the torque density of the switched reluctance electric machine. As a result, the<br>
torque output of the switched reluctance electric machine can be increased<br>
and/or the dimensions of the switched reluctance electric machine can be<br>
reduced for a given torque output in addition, the stator segment assemblies<br>
can be manufactured with a greater uniformity and with tower variations in<br>
inductance and resistance. Sensorless rotor position sensing techniques can be<br>
employed to dramatically lower the manufacturing costs of the switched<br>
reluctance machine and to improve reliability in the field.<br><br>
[0023] Other objects, features and advantages will be apparent from<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0035] The following detailed description provides preferred exemplary<br>
embodiments only and is not intended to limit the scope, applicability or<br>
configuration of the present invention. Rather, the detailed description of the<br><br>
preferred exemplary embodiments will provide those skilled in the art with an<br>
enabling description for implementing the preferred exemplary embodiments of<br>
the present invention. It will be understood that various changes may be made<br>
in the function and arrangement of the elements without departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.<br>
[0036] Referring now to the drawings, a switched reluctance machine<br>
10 is shown to include a housing 12, a segmented stator 14 mounted in the<br>
housing 12, and a rotor 16 supported for rotation relative to the segmented<br>
stator 14. In accordance with the present invention, the segmented stator 14<br>
includes a plurality of stator segment assemblies 18 that can be individually<br>
assembled and then combined with additional stator segment assemblies to<br>
provide the segmented stator 14. As will be detailed, each stator segment<br>
assembly 18 includes a stator segment core 20, an end cap assembly 22<br>
supporting the stator segment core 20, and winding wire 24 that is wound<br>
around the stator segment core 20 and the end cap assembly 22.<br>
[0037] Referring to FIGs. 1, 2A and 2B, the stator segment core 20<br>
includes a solid core or a stack of individual stator plates 26. Each stator plate<br>
26 includes an arcuate outer rim section 28 and a tooth-shaped pole section<br>
30. An outer edge surface 32 of the outer rim section 28 is shaped for<br>
mounting to an inner wall surface 34 of the housing 12. Each outer rim section<br>
28 has a tongue projection 36 formed on one edge surface 38 and a groove 40<br>
on its opposite edge surface 42. This tongue and groove arrangement helps<br>
align the stator segment assemblies during manufacturing. Each pole section<br>
30 of the stator plates 26 has an arcuate inner edge surface 44 and a pair of<br>
circumferentially-extending projections 46.<br>
[0038] As previously mentioned, the stator segment core 20 is defined<br>
by a plurality of stator plates 26 that are stacked together. The stator plates 26<br>
are die cut from thin sheets of magnetically conductive material. During the die<br>
cutting operation, a first pair of slits 50 are cut into the outer rim section 28 and<br>
a second pair of slits 52 are cut into the pole section 30. The slits 50 are<br>
transverse in alignment relative to the slits 52. After stacking the stator plates<br>
26 that form the stator segment core 20, a die punch operation is completed to<br><br>
deform a central portion between the slits 50 and 52. The operation results in<br>
the stator plates 26 being releasably interconnected to define the stator<br>
segment core 20.<br>
[0039] The rotor 16 is shown to include a circular rim section 54 and a<br>
plurality of tooth-shaped pole sections 56 that project radially from the rim<br>
section 54. A circular bore 58 is formed in the rotor 16 and includes keyways<br>
60. The circular bore 58 of the rotor 16 receives a rotor shaft (not shown), in<br>
the particular embodiment shown, the rotor 16 has eight equally spaced rotor<br>
pole sections 56 and the segmented stator 14 has twelve equally spaced pole<br>
sections 30. Other rotor pole and stator pole combinations are also<br>
contemplated. In addition, each rotor pole section 56 has an arcuate outer<br>
edge surface 62 that defines an air gap 63 with respect to the arcuate inner<br>
edge surface 44 on the pole sections 30 of the stator plates 26.<br>
[0040] Referring to FIG. 2B, tooth width W1, projection width W2, and<br>
stator pole arc Bs are shown. As a result of segmenting the stator, the designer<br>
of the switched reluctance electric machine has greater flextoilfry in designing<br>
the dimensions of the stator segment assemblies. The slot opening dimension<br>
between radially inner ends of the stator teeth restricts the projection width W2<br>
when needle and transfer winding methods are employed. This restriction is<br>
eliminated when the segmented stator assemblies are employed because the<br>
stator teeth can be wound individually before being assembled into the stator.<br>
[0041] The tooth width W1 determines the magnetic flux density in the<br>
stator tooth and how much area is available for winding wire in the biter-polar<br>
stator slot The designer of the switched reluctance electric machine can select<br>
the tooth width Wl so that it is sufficient to accommodate the maximum<br>
anticipated magnetic flux in the stator poles, but is not wider than necessary. By<br>
optimizing the tooth width W1, the slot area is increased, which allows<br>
additional winding wire. By increasing the current carrying capacity of the<br>
windings without causing overheating, the torque densify of the switched<br>
reluctance electric machine can be improved. The design of the stator plates<br>
also depends on the type of steel that is selected, the axial length of the stator<br>
stack, and the desired magnetic flux density in the stator teeth.<br><br>
[0042] Referring to FIG. 3, the stator segment assembly 18 is shown<br>
fully assembled to include the stator segment core 20, the end cap assembly<br>
22 and the winding wire 24. The end cap assembly 22 is preferably made from<br>
magnetically permeable material and includes a first end cap 64A, a second<br>
end cap 64B and a pair of elongated winding retainer sections 66. The first end<br>
cap 64A is located at one end of the stator segment core 20 and the second<br>
end cap 646 is located at the opposite end of the stator segment core 20. The<br>
winding retainer sections 66 interconnect the first and second end caps 64A<br>
and 64B and are located adjacent to the projections 46 near the radially inner<br>
end of the pole sections 30 of the stator plates 26. Preferably, the end caps<br>
64A and 64B are similar in configuration. Likewise, it is preferable that the<br>
retainer sections 66 are similar in configuration. Snap-in connections are<br>
contemplated for connecting the opposite ends of each retainer section 66 to<br>
the end caps 64A and 64B. Additionally, it is contemplated that adhesives are<br>
used for bonding the end caps 64A and 64B to the opposite ends of the stator<br>
segment core 20. The end caps 64A and 64B and the retainer sections 66 can<br>
also be molded as an integral end cap assembly 22. The first end cap 64A is<br>
similar to the second end cap 64B. The following description of the components<br>
will use reference numerals with an "A" suffix for the first end cap 64A and with<br>
an "B" suffix for the second end cap 64B.<br>
[0043] Terminals 70 and 72 are shown in FIGs. 3 and 5A to be<br>
mounted in slots 74 and 76 (FIG. 5C) formed in an end surface 78A of the first<br>
end cap 64A. One end of the winding wire 24 is connected to the first terminal<br>
70 while an opposite end of the winding wire 24 is connected to the second<br>
terminal 72. Insulating material 77 covers winding wire 24 on both lateral sides<br>
of stator core 20. The insulating material 77 is also positioned (but not shown)<br>
between the stator segment core 20 and the winding wire 24.<br>
[0044] Referring to FIG. 4, a switched reluctance drive circuit 80 is<br>
shown connected via connecting wires 82,84 and 86 to a printed circuit board<br>
88. The printed circuit board 88 is circular and has a plurality of radially<br>
outwardly projecting terminal pads 90. Each terminal pad 90 has conductive<br>
terminal slots 92 and 94 arranged to accept installation of the terminals 70 and<br><br>
72 for each stator segment assembly 18. The drive circuit 80 operates to<br>
control energization of the winding wire 24 of the stator segment assemblies<br>
18.<br>
[0045] To more clearly illustrate the structure of the end cap assembly<br>
22, FIG. 5A shows the stator segment assembly 18 prior to the winding wire 24<br>
being wound thereon. The first end cap 64A includes an outer section 98A and<br>
an inner section 100A interconnected by a hub section 102A, al defining a<br>
common face surface 104A. The face surface 104A abuts and is bonded to an<br>
end surface 108 of the stator segment core 20. Similarly, the face surface<br>
104B of second end cap 64B abuts and is bonded to an end surface 108 of the<br>
stator segment core 20. When the first end cap 64A is secured to the stator<br>
segment core 20, its outer section 98A is connected slightly radially inward with<br>
respect to the outer rim section 28 and is parallel to the outer ran section 28.<br>
The hub section 102A is aligned with pole section 30 and the inner section<br>
100A is aligned with and extends laterally beyond the inner edge surface 44<br>
and the projections 46. A similar alignment is provided when the second end<br>
cap 64B is secured to the opposite end surface 108 of the stator segment core<br>
20. Moreover, the width of hub sections 102A and 102B is less than or equal to<br>
the width of the pole sections 30 of the stator segment core 20. The opposite<br>
ends of the retainer sections 66 are connected to the face surfaces 104A and<br>
104B of the end caps 64A and 64B, respectively, adjacent to their inner<br>
sections 100A and 100B. As such, the end cap assembly 22 defines a<br>
continuous annular channel within which the winding wire 24 can be precisely<br>
installed and maintained.<br>
[0046] FIG. 5B shows the inner section 100A of the first end cap 64A<br>
and the inner section 100B of the second end cap 64B to be rectangular in<br>
shape. It is contemplated, however, that other configurations (i.e. semi-circular,<br>
square, tapered, etc.) could be used. As a further option, the retainer sections<br>
66 could be provided as a cantilevered section that is integrally formed with the<br>
end caps 64A and/or 64B and adapted for connection to the inner section of the<br>
opposite end cap. To reduce the weight of the end cap assembly 22, lateral<br>
axial grooves 110 and a central axial groove 112 can be formed on the outer<br><br>
section of the end caps 64A and 64B. Likewise, a cavity 114 can also be<br>
formed to provide additional weight reduction.<br>
[0047] Referring now to FIGs. 6A, 6B and 6C, an alternative cap<br>
assembly 122 is shown for connection to the stator segment core 20 and<br>
supporting the winding wire 24. Reference numerals from RGs. 5A, 5B and 5C<br>
will be used where appropriate to identify simlar elements. Specifically, the first<br>
end cap 124A is generally similar to the first end cap 64A. The alternative end<br>
cap assembly 122 includes an additional pair of retainer sections. An outer<br>
retainer section 126A extends axially from the common face surface 104A<br>
adjacent to the outer section 98A for connection to the outer section 98B of the<br>
second end cap 1248. An outer retainer section 126B likewise extends axially<br>
from its common face surface 1048 for connection to common face surface<br>
104A of first end cap 124A. The outer retainer sections 126A and 126B provide<br>
additional support for the end cap assembly 22. In addition, the outer retainer<br>
sections 126A and 126B fill an undercut area of the stator segment core 20 and<br>
eliminate a sharp edge on the inner wall surface 130 that may scrape the<br>
winding wire during the winding operation. The outer retainer sections 126A<br>
and 126B have a tapered profile to mate with the profile of inner wall surfaces<br>
130 (FIG. 2) of the outer rim section 28.<br>
[0048] As can be appreciated from the foregoing, the segmented stator<br>
for a switched reluctance electric machine according to the invention improves<br>
the torque density of the electric machine in part by increasing slot fill, by<br>
allowing the stator segment assemblies to be precisely wound (which improves<br>
heat exchange between the windings and the slot), and by providing a greater<br>
active length for a given overall length across end turns (due to shorten end<br>
turns).<br>
[0049] The stator segment assemblies of the switched reluctance<br>
electric machine can be produced with a greater electrical uniformity and with<br>
lower variations in inductance and resistance. As a result, sensoriess rotor<br>
position sensing techniques can be employed, which dramatically lowers the<br>
manufacturing costs of the switched reluctance machine and improves<br>
reliability in the field. Because the manufacturing tolerances of the stator have<br><br>
been improved, less costly drive circuits can be employed and/or more<br>
accurate control can be achieved. In addition, the end cap assemblies<br>
according to the invention prevent winding creep and further help to improve<br>
the electrical uniformity of the stator segment assemblies during use.<br>
[0050] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
invention should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the<br>
