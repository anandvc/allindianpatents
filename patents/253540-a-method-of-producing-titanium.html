				<td>This invention relates to the production of titanium metal, titanium alloys and titanium compounds.<br>
Titanium is usually commercially produced from titanium tetraehloride (TiCL4) by the Hunter or Kroll processes. These processes involve a sodium or a magnesium reduction step. Titanium has also been produced by the reduction of potassium nexafiuorotitanate (K2TiF6) with sodium, by the electrolytic reduction of titanium dioxide (TiO2) and by the reduction of TiO2 with magnesium or calcium. Titanium can accordingly be produced from a variety of titanium-containing precursors using a variety of reducing agents.<br>
The density of titanium metal is about 45% of that of steel, however titanium is as strong as steel and has superior chemical resistance. Titanium is also the ninth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, but despite its abundance and superior properties, the world market for titanium is only 1% of the aluminium market and only 0.1% of the stainless steel market The reason for this is its price. Only limited markets such as the military, aerospace and medical markets can afford to use titanium. The main reasons why titanium metal is so expensive are because the precursors used in the production of titanium are expensive and because of high losses due to oxidation during the melting, casting and forging of the metal.<br>
The present invention provides an efficient and inexpensive process for the production of titanium, its alloys and its compounds.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of producing titanium metal from a titanium-containing material, the method including the steps of<br>
producing a solution of MTiF6 from the titanium-containing material, selectively precipitating M'2TiF6 from the solution by the addition of (M')aXb<br>
in which<br>
M" is a cation of the type which forms a hexafluorotitanate,<br>
M1 is selected from ammonium and the alkali metal cations,<br>
x is an anion selected from haiide, sulphate, nitrite, acetate and nitrate, and<br>
a and b are 1 or 2; and<br>
using the selectively precipitated M'2TiF6 to produce titanium.<br>
In the case of nitrate, M" will be in its highest oxidation state.<br>
M" may be selected from Fe2*, Mn2*, Zn2*, Mg2+, Cu2+, Ca2+, Sr24, Ba2+, Co2+andNi2+.The alkali metal may be selected from lithium, sodium and potassium. Preferably, M"TiF8 will be FeTiFÂ« and (M')aXb will be NH4CI.<br>
The titanium-containing material may be selected from ilmenite, rutile, anatase, perovskite, brookite, pseudo-brookite, sphene, leucoxene and titaniferous slags. Ilmenite is FeTiO3. Rutile, anatase, brookite and leucoxene are all naturally occurring TiOr-containing minerals. Titaniferous slag is a TiOrcontaining material produced largely from the smelting of ilmenite. Sphene is CaTiSiOs and perovskite is CaTiO3,<br>
When ores other than ilmenite or perovskite are used the ratio Ti:M" will bo adapted to bo 1:1 or higher so that the molar amount of M" is at least equal to that of the Ti or higher. This can be achieved by either the addition of Ti or by the addition of M".<br>
The M"TiFe may thus be FeTiF6 and the solution of FeTiF6 may be produced by the digestion of ilmenite with aqueous HF.<br>
The ilmenfte may be used in excess. The concentration of the HF may be between about 5 and 60 %. Preferably, it will be between about 20 and 24%.<br>
The method may include the step of adding a reducing agent to the solution produced in the digestion step to reduce at least some of any Fe (til) present In the solution to Fe(ll).The reducing agent may be a metal reducing agent The metal may be selected from Fe, for example in the form of iron filings or steel wool, Af, Zn, Cu, Mn and Mg.The method may include adding the (M')aXb in the solid state to the solution produced in the digestion step.<br>
The method may include the further step of purifying the M"TiFe by recrystallisation.When the MVFiFe is (NhU^TiFe, the method may include dissolving the (NHUfeTiFe in water to produce a solution and precipitating Li2TiF8, NajTiF6 or K2T!Fe by the addition of a lithium, sodium or potassium salt to the solution. The salt may be selected from alkali metal chlorides and sulphates but, naturally, any other suitable alkali metal salt may be used. Preferably the salt will be sodium chloride or sodium sulphate.The method may then include the step of reducing the U?TiF6, or K2TiF6 to produce titanium. This route is referred to below as Option A. The reduction may be carried out with a reducing agent selected from sodium, magnesium, potassium and calcium. In this case the method may include, prior to the reduction step, the step of mixing the NajTFe with a predetermined quantify of at least one other metal salt so that the titanium produced in the reduction step is in the form of a titanium alloy containing at least one other metal. The other metal salt may, for example be Na^AIFe or Na2VF7 or a combination thereof so that the titanium alloy produced contains aluminium or vanadium or both.<br>
The method may include, for example, adding sufficient NaaAIFs and Na2VF7 to produce grade 5 titanium (which contains about 6% aluminium and about 4% vanadium). Naturally other metal fluoride salts such as AtF3, VF5, VF4 or VF3 could be used and the amount varied so that a variety of alloys can be prepared.<br>
Where the titanium-containing material is a TiOs-containing material such as rutile, anatase, brookite, leucoxene or titaniferous slag in which M" is low, the method may include the steps of first forming an aqueous HF solution of the M" saft and then digesting the titanium-containing material in the acidic solution of the M" salt to produce the solution of M TiF6.<br>
In the preferred route, the method may include the step of reducing the (NH4TiFe, in which the titanium is in the oxidation state IV, to produce a titanium-Ill product, decomposing the titanium-Ill product to produce TiF3 and reducing the TiF3 to titanium. This route is referred to below as Option B.The (NH^TiFs may be reduced to the Ti(ill) product with a reducing agent selected from aluminium, manganese, zinc, iron and magnesium. Instead, the (NH4TiFe may be etectrolytically reduced to produce the Ti(lll) product<br>
The Ti(lll) product, for example, may be (NHOaTiFs, (NH^TiFs, or NH4TiF4. All of these compounds decompose between about 400 and 700Â°C to produce TiF3.The TiF3 may be reduced to titanium by reduction with a reducing agent selected from sodium, magnesium and aluminium.<br>
The invention extends to TtF3 produced by the pyrolytic decomposition of NhiTiF+ The invention extends, further, to TF3 having an x-ray diffraction pattern as set out in Figure 6.<br>
The invention extends further to a method of producing titanium metal from a TiCVcontaining material, tie method including the steps of preparing an aqueous hydrofluoric acid solution containing Mff, digesting the TiOy-containing material in the solution to produce a solution containing M"TiF6,<br>
selectively precipitating M'2TiF6 from the solution by the addition of (M')aXb in which M" is a cation of the type which forms a hexafluorotitanate,<br>
M1 is selected from ammonium and the alkali metal cations,<br>
X is an anion selected from halide, sulphate, nitrite, acetate and nitrate, and<br>
a and b are 1 or 2; andusing the selectively precipitated MzTiFe to produce titanium.The TiOa-containing material may be selected from rutile, anatase, brookrte, leucoxene and titaniferous slag. However, any other suitable TiOz-containing material may be used.<br>
The aqueous hydrofluoric acid solution containing M" may be prepared by dissolving a basic salt of M" in aqueous HF. The basic salt may for example be the oxide, hydroxide or carbonate of M".<br>
In a preferred embodiment, M1 will be NH4* and the method will include reducing the optionally purified (NH4)2TiF6 toNH4TiF4;<br>
pyroliztng the NH 4 TiF4 to produce TiF3; and reducing the TiF3 to titanium metal.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of forming a metal alloy, the method including the steps of<br>
combining a predetermined amount of a reducible fluoride salt of a first metal with a predetermined amount of at least one reducible salt of another metal to produce a salt mixture and<br>
reducing the fluoride salt mixture to produce a mixture of the metals or an alloy.<br>
The method may include combining the fluoride salt of the first metal with two or more reducible salts of other metals so that an alloy containing three or more metals is produced.<br>
The reducible fluoride salt of the first metal may be a reducible salt of titanium. The reducible salt of the other metal may be a reducible salt of metals selected from vanadium, aluminium, palladium, molybdenum and nickel.<br>
The reducible salt of the first metal may, in particular, be MsTiFe and the reducible salt of the other metal may be selected from MaAIFe. MaVF7 and combinations thereof in which M is an alkali metal. In particular, M may be sodium.<br>
The method may include the further step of smelting the mixture to produce the alloy.According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a salt which is NH4TiF4.<br>
The invention extends to NH4TiF4 having an x-ray diffraction pattern as set out in Figure 5.According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of making NH4 TiF4 the method including the step of reducing (NH4)2TiF6-<br>
The reducing agent may be a metal reducing agent It may, for example, be aluminium, an aluminium amalgamate, mercury coated aluminium eg AI(Hg) or aluminium carbide.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of making titanium metal powder, the method including the step of<br>
reducing TiF3 with aluminium to produce a reduction product comprising titanium metal powder and AIF3.<br>
The method may include the further step of<br>
heating the reduction product to a temperature and for a time which are sufficient to sublime off most of the AIF3 but to cause retention of sufficient AIF3 on the surface to reduce the reactivity of the titanium metal powder.<br>
The method may include heating the reduction product until the AIF3 on the surface of the titanium metal powder comprises between about 0,005 and 40% of the mass of the material, preferably between about 0,05 and 10% and more preferably between about 0,1 and 5,0%.<br>
The residual AIF3 causes an inert layer which is at least a monolayer thick to be formed on the surface of the titanium powder. This substantially increases the temperature at which spontaneous combustion of the titanium powder takes place in air from about 250Â°C to above 600Â°C. The powder is accordingly safer to use and transport than prior art titanium powders.<br>
The invention extends to a deactivated titanium powder having a surface layer of AIF3 in which the AIF3 comprises between about 0,05 and 10% of the mass of the material and preferably between about 0,1 and 5% AIF3.<br>

According to a further aspect of the invention, in a method of preparing a titanium artifact from a titanium metal precursor material, which includes the steps of subjecting the titanium metal precursor material to a heating step to produce a titanium metal intermediate material and subjecting the intermediate material to one or more process steps to produce the artifact, there is provided the improvement of conducting the heating step in an atmosphere containing a volatile fluoride salt.<br>
The titanium metal intermediate material produced will thus have a protective layer of the fluoride salt.<br>
The atmosphere will preferably be an inert atmosphere such as an argon or helium atmosphere. The titanium metal precursor material may be deactivated titanium powder as hereinbefore described.<br>
The volatile fluoride salt may be selected from A1F3, MgF2 and NaF. Naturally, any other suitable fluoride salt may be used.<br>
The heating step may be by firing or furnace heating using, for example, vacuum furnaces, inert gas furnaces, microwave assisted furnaces, radio frequency assisted furnaces, induction furnaces or zone refining furnaces.<br>
The process steps may be standard process steps of the type used in the fabrication of titanium artifacts such as uniaxial pressing, cold isostatic pressing, hot isostatic pressing, cold rolling, hot rolling and the like. The process steps may include the addition of sacrificial binders such as waxes and polymers.<br>
The titanium artifact may be a solid material or a porous material. It may be an alloy of titanium and may be selected from rods, bars, wires, sheets and the like.<br>
The titanium artefact may contain trace quantities of fluoride. By trace quantities is meant quantities which do not affect the bulk properties of the titanium.<br><br>
The furnace arrangement and heating cycle will be such that during the heating step the titanium is always surrounded by a protective atmosphere containing the fluoride salt so that it is protected from reaction with oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen or the like.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of recovering titanium from ilmenite, the method including the steps of<br>
digesting ilmenite in aqueous HF to produce FeTiF6 and removing insoluble material;<br>

heating a deactivated powder as hereinbefore described with a source of nitrogen, carbon, boron, hydrogen, silicon, phosphorous or sulphur.<br>

DISCUSSION<br>
Prior art methods for the digestion of ilmenrte have made use of either sulphuric acid or chlorine and coke at high temperatures. It is also known that ilmenite can be digested in dilute HF in an exothermic reaction according to the equation:FeTiO3+ 6HF = FeTiF6 + 3H2O<br>
The dilution of the HF was controlled at 20 - 24% so that a saturated solution of FeTiFe, which could be filtered to remove insoluble material, was produced. It was found that the yield and purity of the FeTiFe precursor produced in the selective precipitation step could be improved if all of the iron in solution was in oxidation state II (ie if no Fe3+was present) and if no free HF was present. This was achieved by using an excess of ilmenite, which could then be recycled, and by the addition of metallic iron filings to the solution after digestion. The addition of iron filings reduced Fe3+to Fe2+ according to the equation:<br>
If too much iron was added, reduction of TIF to TIF occurred and this had a negative influence on the yield. It was found that copper filings could first be added to a small sample portion of the leachate to reduce the Fe3+ to Fe2+ without reducing the TIF4+ and the correct amount of metallic iron could then be calculated.<br>
The (M')aXb was preferably added in the form of the dry salt For example, if a saturated solution of M"TiF6.6H2O, in which M" is Fe2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, Cuz+ or the like is mixed with the dry salt of M'CI, in which M1 is Li*, Na*. K* or NhU*, the M'zTiFe intermediate precipitates almost quantitively from the solution while the M"CI2, which is co-produced in the reaction, remains in solution. This is a not unexpected result in the case of K2TiF6 which has a low solubility, but such a near-quantitative precipitation in respect of Li2TiF6, and (NH4)2TiFe, both of which are highly soluble in water, is particularly unexpected.<br>
It was also found that, for the (NH^TiFe to precipitate quantitatively, 4 moles of NH4CI had to be added to 1mole of M"TiF6. This can be explained by the co-formation of the (NH4)2MIICl4 double salts. This would also be expected in the case of potassium, however, because of its low solubility, KaTiFe precipitates in preference to the formation of the K2M"-double salt. Consequently, only 2 moles of KCI or 1 mole of KzSCu was needed to precipitate K2TiF6 almost quantitively. The same applied in respect of Li* and Na* which do not form double salts with M". Chloride was used in preference to SO*2" because of its higher solubility and easier<br>
recycling loops. Other anions like CHaCOO", NO2", and the like can also be used for selective precipitation but NO3" is not suitable because it causes oxidation of<br>
The selective precipitation resulted in the removal of the bulk of the M" so that, after filtration and washing, only low levels of M" remained in the crystalline precipitate. In this way a relatively pure titanium precursor was obtained in high yield (90%).If the M2TiF6 was reduced directly, the iron level in the resulting titanium corresponded to that of grade 4 titanium (although the oxygen, nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen levels were very low). In order to reduce the iron content of the titanium to produce a metal having an iron level corresponding to that of grade 1 titanium or better, it was necessary to improve the purity of the precursors. Because of the low solubility of KzTiFe and Na2TiF6, recrystallisation was not practical and these salts were purified by solvent extraction with methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) and HCI. It was more practical to selectively precipitate the highly soluble U2TiF6 or (NH^TiFe salts as these could readily be recrystallised. Of the two salts, it was more economical to use (NHUJaTiFe. It was also found that boiling saturated solutions of (NH4)2TiF6 did not result in hydrolysis of the salt (which is unusual for water-soluble titanium salts) and a high concentration could accordingly be obtained so that a maximum yield of the crystalline product could be obtained on cooling. Very pure titanium precursors were obtained in this way and were pure enough to be used as precursors in the production of TiOz pigments. The titanium metal produced on reduction of the purified (NH4)2TiF6 was purer than commercial grade 1 titanium.After the (NH4)2TiFe has been purified by recrystallisation, two approaches can be followed to produce titanium metal. The first approach (Option A) involves the reduction of NaaTiFe or K2TiFe produced from the<br>
Because of the difference in solubility between (NH^TiFe and Na2TiFc (or the corresponding potassium salt),  Na2TiF6 can be precipitated from a<br>
saturated solution of (NH^TiFe by the addition of sodium chloride. The NH4CI produced as a byproduct can then be filtered from the precipitate and crystallised for re-use in the selective precipitation step.<br>
After drying, the Na2TiF6 (mp. 700"C) can be reduced under an argon atmosphere. Reduction is exothermic at the melting point of the salt. Sodium or magnesium (10% stoichometric excess) is usually used as the reducing agent but potassium or calcium can also be used.<br>
After reduction, the excess sodium or magnesium is boiled off at 900Â°C or 1100Â°C respectively. The respective products are 6NaF(Ti) or 2NaMgF3(Ti).<br>
The fluoride-titanium mixture is then fed into a vertically arranged elongate tubular zirconia or molybdenum crucible under an argon atmosphere. The top of the crucible is heated to 1300*C and the bottom to 1700Â°C. The bulk of the molten 6NaF (mp. 990Â°C) or 2NaMgF3 (mp. 1030Â°C) is tapped from the crucible above the molten titanium and the remainder of the molten fluoride acts as a blanket on top of the molten titanium (mp1670Â°C) to protect it from oxygen and nitrogen.<br>
The molten titanium is then cast into ingots or other products in a molten fluoride eutectic consisting, for example, of 40 mole % NaF and 60 mole % LiF (mp. 652Â°C), to allow for the titanium to anneal at 700Â°C. In this way the titanium is still protected against oxidation and nitrification during the annealing process.<br>
The second approach to the production of titanium (Option B) involves the pre-reducUon of (NI-UJjTIFe to a Ti3* species, conversion of the Ti3* species to TiF3 and reduction of the TiF3 to titanium metal.For example, the (NH^TiFe produced in the selective precipitation step can be reduced with Al (Hg-activated) or with Mn without the addition of an acid.<br>
Typical products of the reduction are NH4TiF4 and (NH4)3AIFe or (NH4)2T3F5 and MnF?. In the case of reduction with aluminium, the (NH4)aAlF6 is more soluble and can be removed from the almost insoluble NH4TiF4 precipitate by acid filtration. The latter can then be decomposed at 700Â°C to produce NH4F (g) and TiF3 (s). From the diluted (NH4)3AIF6, Na3AIF8 (cryolite) can be precipitated as a by-product with NaCI and the resulting ammonium salt can be recycled.<br>
With the addition of acid (usually HF), other reducing agents such as Zn, A), Mn, Fe or Mg can be used. A typical product is (NH4)2HTiF6 which is freely soluble in acid (pH 1-2) while the reducing agent-fluorides are much less soluble and can be separated from the (NH^aHTiFe by filtration. Raising the pH with NH4OH (pH 6) precipitates (NHUfeTiFe. After filtration and drying, the product can be decomposed at 700"C to produce 3NH4F(g) and TiF3 (s).<br>
However, an alternative option is to reduce (NH4)2TiF6 electrolytically. A membrane such as a canvas membrane is used to separate the anode from the cathode. Normally a lead anode and a graphite cathode are used. The anode side is filled with 0.1 N HF solution and the cathode side is filled with a saturated (NH^TiFe solution, acidified with HF to pH 1. The electrolytic reactions are as follows:<br>
Anode:	H2O = HO2 (g) + 2H+ (aq) + 2e"<br>
Cathode:	2Ti** (aq) + 2e' = 2Ti34 (aq)<br>
After electrolysis, the pH of the violet (NH^HTlFe solution is increased by addition of NH4OH to pH 6 to precipitate (NH4)3T!F6. After filtration and drying, the product can be decomposed at 700Â°C to produce 3NH4F (g) and TiF3 (s). The Ti3+ is then reduced to titanium metal. TiF3 can be reduced with Na, Mg or Al to produce 3NaF(Ti), 11/2MgF2(Ti) or AIF3(Ti) respectively. The reduction of TiF3 is less exothermic than the reduction of (Na.K^TiFe and occurs above 700Â°C. As described above, the NaF or MgF2 can be melted from the titanium while AIF3 will sublime at 1300Â°C.<br>
To ensure that there is no free HF present after the digestion step, a 30 Â± 10% excess ilmenite is maintained during digestion. Because of its coarseness and high density, the excess ilmenite settles out from the ieachate and the light insoluble precipitate after digestion. The digested suspension is pumped off from the settled ilmenite and filtered. The fiKer cake is then re-siurried and screened through a 45um screen. The top fraction (ilmenite) is recycled back into the digestion tank while the bottom fraction (mostly acid insolubles) is waste. In this way a digestion efficiency of greater than 90% is achieved.<br>
In the Option A process which proceeds via the reduction of the choice of the reducing agent determines the choice of the salt used for the selective precipitation. Sodium favours a chloride precipitate while magnesium favours a sulphate precipitate. The recycling loops are set out in Figures 16 and 17 which respectively show the production of high purity titanium and of grade 4 titanium.<br>
In the Option B process, which proceeds via the intermediate reduction of Ti4* to Ti3+, the recycling loops will be essentially the same as those for the Option A process as indicated in Figure 1. If an electrolytic pre-reduction (Ti4* to Ti3+) is not used, the fluoride salts of the reducing agents would be by-products. If aluminium is used in the secondary reduction step (Ti34 to Ti), the sublimed AIF3 can be sold as a by-product or the fluoride values can be recovered by steam hydrolysis at 400Â°C according to the following equation will then be the by-product.is the major by-product of the process of the invention. If magnesium is used as the reducing agent and not regenerated, Mg(OH)2 or MgSO4 will also be by-products.<br>

With reference to Figure 1, the process of the invention can be divided into five stages. These are the digestion of ilmenite, the selective precipitation of the titanium precursor produced in the digestion step, the reduction of the precursor, the melting of the reduced titanium product into an ingot and the recycling of the reagents used in the process.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
PRODUCTION OF TITANIUM FROM ILMENITE VIA AKHg) REDUCTION OF (NHalgTiFg<br>
STEP 1: DIGESTION OF ILMENITE WITH DILUTE HF Feed Material<br>
Ilmenite concentrate was used as the feed material for the digestion step. The material contained about 89.5% ilmenite, 6% hematite, 2.5% quartz and 2% other metal oxides. The particle size was uniform and approximately 98% of the material had a particle size of between +45um and -106um. The material typically had the following chemical composition:(Table Removed) Stoichiometrv : HF required for 500a of ilmenite feed<br>
The ilmenite used consisted of FeTiO3 (89,5%), Fe2O3 (6,0%), SiO2 (2,5%) and other material (2%). This corresponded to FeTi03 (447,5g; 2,95 mol), FeaOs (30g; 0,19 mol) and SiO2 (12,5g; 0,21 mol) in 500g. The FeTiO3, FeaOs and SiO2 each require 6 mol of HF per mole for conversion, respectively, to FeTiFe, FeF3 and HaSiFe. The total amount of HF required was therefore (2,95 + 0,19 + 0,21) x 6 = 20,1 mol for the 98% feedstock.<br>
However, to ensure complete digestion, an excess of 20% ilmenite was used during digestion. After the digestion, approximately 94% of the excess ilmenite could be recovered because of its high density and coarse particle size.<br>
Batches were prepared as follows. In a 21 polypropylene beaker, ilmenite (600g) was added to tap water (500 rrrf; 20Â°C). While stirring vigorously, HF (900ml; 40%) was added and a loose heavy plastic lid was placed on top of the beaker. The reaction was strongly exothermic and after about 10 minutes the suspension reached boiling point and boiled for about 5 minutes.<br>
After 2 hours, Fe (12g; steel wool) was added to the solution and the mixture was stirred for 1 hour to reduce all soluble Fe(lll) to Fe(ll).<br>
The suspension was then filtered and washed with tap water (2 x 50ml). Approximately 200g of moist filter cake was obtained. This material was re-slurried to recover most of the excess ilmenite and a leachate of 1375mt containing FeTiFe was obtained.<br>
Extraction efficiency<br>
The Ti concentration in the leachate was approximately 100g/l implying a Ti recovery of 137.5g. The recovery efficiency was calculated as follows:<br>
-	Stoichiometry:         141.5g Ti (500g feed)        =97%<br>
-	20% excess: 169.8gTi(600g feed)        =81%<br>
-	94% recovery of excess:    144g Ti (505g feed)= 95.5%<br>
STEP 2: SELECTIVE PRECIPITATION OF<br>
The leachate (1 ,375!) contained Ti (137,5g; 2,865 mol). This required NK,CI (4 x 2,865 = 11,46 mol;613,11g).<br>
NH4CI (61 3g) was slowly added to the FeTiF6 leachate of step 1 (1375mf) while stirring vigorously. The temperature dropped to below 10'C and was raised to 15Â°C using a warm bath. The suspension was then stirred for 1 hour at 15Â°C.<br>
The resulting crystalline (NH4)2TiF6 was filtered at 15 - 20Â°C, and pressed inside the filter head to remove as much excess liquid as possible. The vacuum was then broken and ice water (184m?; 5Â°C) was added to the product. The vacuum could be restored only after the water had penetrated the filter cake (approximately 2 minutes later) and the crystalline (NH4)2TiF6 had the appearance of icing-sugar. The crystalline product was sucked and pressed as dry as possible.<br>
The crystalline (NliOaTiFe was then dried at 60Â°C. The yield was 522g, The XRD of this product is shown in Figure 3.<br>
Precipitation efficiency<br>
Based on a (NHUJaTiFe crystalline product with a purity of 100% (522g = 2.631 mol Ti), the efficiency of Ti recovery was 92%. The Fe concentration in the crystalline product was typically about 0,5 Â±0,4%. Other impurities such as Si and Al were also present. However, these impurities could be removed by prior treatment of the feed before digestion (for example by caustic leaching) or by precipitation of these elements after digestion. For example, after Fe reduction, NaCI could be added to precipitate Na2SiF6 and<br>
Recrvstallisation of (NHTiF+<br>
(400g), produced as described above and dried at 60Â°C, was added to water (SOOmt) in a 2 litre vessel. It was found that anhydrous (NHOzTiFe has a greater<br>
solubility than hydrated or moist (NHUfeTiFe.x^O A small piece of Al strip (approx 100mm x 25 mm) was added to the suspension.<br>
While stirring, HF (0,5ml; 40%) was added to the suspension to prevent hydrolysis and to initiate the reduction of a small amount of Ti(IV) with Al. The suspension was heated to boiling point (approx 100"C). Any foam which formed on top of the solution decreased with time and was mixed into the solution.<br>
The colour of the solution changed to light violet, indicating the presence of Ti(lll). This also indicated that all of the iron present was in the form of Fe(ll). When the solution boiled, a layer of violet TiF3 poisoned the Al strip and the reduction stopped. The formation of a small amount of (NHOsAIFe arising from the addition of the aluminium strip did not present a problem as this product is produced as a by product in the following step (Step 3). After the solution had boiled for about 1 minute, it was removed from the heat source and allowed to cool. The Al strip could then be removed and reused (without cleaning) in the next run.<br>
The vessel was cooled to about 40Â°C with cold water, and ice and cold water were then used to cool the vessel to 10Â°C while stirring the resulting crystalline (NHUfeTiFe.<br>
The crystalline product was filtered and pressed inside the filter head to remove as much excess liquid as possible. The vacuum was then broken and ice water (50mC; 5Â°C) was added to the crystalline product. The vacuum could be restored only after the water had penetrated the filter cake (approximately 2 minutes later) and the crystalline product had the appearance of icing-sugar. The crystalline product was then sucked and pressed as dry as possible.<br>
The resulting crystalline (NH4)2TiF6 was dried at 60Â°C. The yield was typically about 70% of the feed crystalline product without evaporation of additional water. The XRD of this product is shown in Figure 4.<br>
A crude but reliable way to test the purity of the dried crystalline (NH4)2TiF6 was to add the product (approx 5g) to CP grade HCI (appox 25 ml; 32%) in a 50 ml glass beaker. After standing for about 5 minutes, the HCI turned yellow or orange if any iron was present. Concentrated HCI Is very sensitive to iron and the intensity of the yellow or orange colour was directly proportional to the iron concentration at<br>
concentration levels between about 1% and 0.01% Fe. This test was carried out on the feed crystalline product, recrystalHsed product and (NH^TiFe standard.<br>
STEP 3: REDUCTION OF (NH4TIF+ WITH AUHal Activation of Al with HoAluminium buttons (ID approximately 10-15mm, 1-3mm thick, 150g) were covered with a 1N NaOH solution in a 500m! plastic beaker and Hg (approximately 50m{) was added. The buttons were mixed using a plastic stirrer and dipped into the Hg. After about 5 minutes, the buttons were completely coated with Hg.The sodium hydroxide was removed by rinsing the buttons with a strong flow of lap water inside the beaker for about 1 minute.<br>
The excess Hg was then poured from the Hg-coated buttons through a 500pm screen and the buttons were immediately covered with acetone. After about 1 - 2 hours in acetone, further free Hg dropped from the buttons, leaving only a micro layer of Hg on the buttons.<br>
When ready to use, the AI(Hg)-buttons were screened (500pm) from the acetone and free Hg, and immediately dropped into the (NH^TiFe solution as described below.<br>
Reduction<br>
In a 21 vessel, the recrystallised (NH4)2TiF6 from step 2 (500g) was dissolved in tap water (1.5t). The temperature was raised to 30Â°C and a dear solution was obtained.<br>
The AI(Hg)-buttons (150g) prepared as described above were added to the (NH TiFe solution, while stirring (no vortex). The reaction was exothermic and the temperature rose from 30 to 70Â°C over a period of 75 minutes. After 15 minutes at 70Â°C, the suspension was cooled to below 30Â°C and filtered.<br>
The AI(Hg)-buttons were rinsed with water and stored in acetone. The violet precipitate was filtered and sucked as dry as possible and washed with water (2 x 50mt),<br>
The violet precipitate was dried at 60Â°C (yield 475g). The product consisted of NH4TiF4 and (NH4)3AIF6 in a weight ratio of approx 75%:25%. NH4TiF4 has a taw solubility in dilute HP and an even lower solubility in concentrated HP. In this way, if necessary, the (NhUJaAIFe (and other impurities) could be washed out of the product. The XRD of this dean product is shown in Figure 5.<br>
It was also found that, if crude instead of pure (NH4)2TiF6 was used, the Fe(ll) present in the solution, plated onto the AI(Hg)-buttons and poisoned them. However, this only occurred after all of the Ti(IV) had been reduced to Ti(lll). The Applicant believes that this method can be used to remove Pe, to the extent that recrystallisation of the (NH4)2TiF6 may not be necessary. After reduction, the poisoned AI(Hg)-buttons could be re-activated by a dilute HCI leach to remove the Fe.<br>
STEP 4: DECOMPOSITION OF NH4 T1F+ AND (NH4kAIF8<br>
The reduction product from step 3, consisting of a mixture of NH4TiF4 and was decomposed at 600"C under a nitrogen or argon atmosphere in a mild steel rotary. After 2-4 hours of soaking, the light brown-maroon product, consisting of TiF3 and AIF3, was completely free of NHjF which had evaporated. The evaporated material was condensed and collected. It was found that, if traces of NH4F remained, TIN formed during the reduction with Al at 750'C.<br>
Depending on the ratio between NH4TiF4 and (NH4)3AIF6, the yield of the decomposed product was typically between 60 and 70% of the feed.<br>
The XRD of clean TiF3 produced from clean NH4TiF4 prepared as described above is shown in Figure 6. NH4TiF4 is a hitherto unknown salt and there is accordingly no data with which to compare the XRD powder pattern of Nf-UTiF* as shown in Figure 5. The closest XRD fit to this salt is the XRD of NHUFeF^ It is therefore not unexpected that the decomposed product, TiF3 of NH4TiF4 best matches the XRD powder pattern of FeF3. The XRD powder patterns of standard samples of FeF3 and TiF3 are shown in Figure 7.<br>
STEP 5: REDUCTION OF TiF3 WITH Al AND SUBLIMATION OF AIF3<br>
After determining the ratio between TiF3 and AIF3 in the product produced in step (4), Al-powder (
It was found that, for the reduction to be complete in a static unit, the coarsest Al powder that could be used was 
After reduction at 750Â°C, the temperature was raised to 1250Â°C, still under an argon atmosphere. At this temperature the AIF3 sublimed and was condensed and collected as a pure by-product The XRD of the A1F3 is shown in Figure 9. When the production of white fumes stopped, the sublimation was complete. Depending on the batch size and surface area, soaking at this temperature was between 2 and 10 hours. After cooling, the product Ti-powder was collected. The XRD of the powder Is shown in Figure 10.<br>
The Applicant has found that complete sublimation of AIF3 may be undesirable and that it is preferable to leave a trace amount (0.1 - 5%) to coat the Ti-powder. It was found that this fluoride coating protected the powder and increased safety when handling and transporting the powder. Prior art commercial Ti-powders have a spontaneous combustion temperature of approximately 250Â°C in air. However, this    temperature is increased to 600Â°C if the inert AIF3 layer is present. When the powder is melted or sintered (powder metallurgy) the AIF3 layer will sublime and not contaminate the titanium product.<br>
It was also found that a metal crust formed on top of the Ti-powder at 1250Â°C (refer to Figure 15). It is believed that this crust contains metal impurities which migrated with the AIF3 gas to the surface of the powder and precipitated there as the AIF3 sublimed, analogous to zone refining.<br>
STEP 6: MELTING OF Ti-POWDER<br>
The Ti-powder produced In step (5) was pressed inside a zirconia lined clay crucible and melted in an induction furnace under an argon atmosphere. It readily melted to form a small ingot and a trace amount of AIF3 in the form of fumes was produced. The XRD of the metal is shown in Figure 11. The Ti-powder or metal produced in this way contained very low levels (
As can be seen from the XRD of the Ti-ingot, the process of the invention allows Ti to be produced by reduction with Al without the formation of AI-Ti alloys. Although the XRDs of the Ti-powder after reduction as shown in Figure 8 and after sublimation as shown in Figure 10, appear to reveal the presence of the AITi3 phase (instead of Ti phases only), the Applicant believes that the AITi3 phase which is apparently shown in the XRDs is only a pseudo AITi3 phase and that there is, in fact, no Al present. The reason why the Ti3" has the AITi3 crystal structure is because it was "born" from Al and, at the low temperature used (
This was also confirmed by the fact that the XRD of the reduced Ti-powder with Al (Figure 8), showed that only the phases AIF3 and AITi3 were present. Because a stoichiometric amount of Al to TiF3 was used, if Al does, in fact, alloy with Ti to form<br>
A)Ti3l there should be 25% unreacted T!F3 present and this does not show on the XRD.<br>
The main reason why Ti can be reduced by Al without alloying is the fact that, during reduction, Al reacts with Ti(lll) and not Ti(IV). The former reaction is moderately exothermic while the latter reaction is violently exothermic:<br>
TIF3 + Al +TIF+ AIF3 AG -SOU / mol T1,	[tog(K) 4]<br>
TJF4 + 1 -Ml = Ti + 1HAIF3 AG = -300W / mol Ti,         [log(K) = 15]<br>
Alloying occurs when two metals are in contact with one another and there is enough energy to form an alloy.<br>
In the first reaction the energy was too low to make alloying possible. The presence of AIF3 also helped to maintain the temperature at less than 1100Â°C which is when AIF3 starts to sublime thus absorbing the energy.<br>
It is evident that the first electron reduction of Ti(IV) to Ti(lil) is highly exothermic. In the process of the invention, that energy is absorbed in water during the controlled aqueous reduction of (NHOzTIFe with AI(Hg).<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
PREPARATION OF TITANIUM-VANADIUM ALLOY STEP 1: PREPARATION OF NHtVF* AND VFa<br>
To manufacture Ti-alloys, such as TM5AI-4V, the alloying elements in the form of their metal fluorides were mixed in the correct ratio with TiF3 prior to reduction with Al. In the case of Ti - 6AI - 4V, VF3 was added to TiF3 and 6% excess Al was used during the reduction to produce the alloy-powder, after sublimation of AIF3.<br>
The V could not be introduced as VF5 or VF4 due to the low boiling points of these compounds since they would sublime before reduction could take place. It was therefore necessary to produce VF3as the V precursor as set out below.<br>
NH4VO3 (58.5g) was added to water (300m!) and stirred. NH4CI (53,5g) and HF (40%; 130mf) were added to the resulting solution to produce a yellow solution.<br>
Fe (14g, steel wool) was added to the solution to reduce the V(V) to V(IV). The reaction was exothermic and a blue solution was produced. After the reaction was completed, approximately 1 hour later, the solution was filtered to remove trace amounts of iron residue.<br>
NH4VO3 + 6HF + VSFe + 2NH4CI - (NH^VFe + MfNH&amp;FeCU + H2O<br>
The temperature of the blue solution was adjusted to 20Â°C and then reduced with AI(Hg)-buttons. Over a period of approx 3 hours, the temperature increased to about 40Â°C. When the reduction of V(IV) to V(lll) had completed, Fe plated onto the AI(Hg)-buttons and the reduction stopped.<br>
The resulting green suspension was then filtered and dried as for NH4TiF4 described above. The yield of peppermint green NH4VF4.2H2O, was 67g. The XRD of this product is shown in Figure 13.<br>
Al(Hg) was not used to reduce V(V) to V(IV) because the reaction was extremely violent and too much (NH4)3AIF6 precipitated during the reaction.<br>
STEP 2: PREPARATION OF THE ALLOY<br>
As for NH4TiF4, NH4VF4.2H2O was also decomposed at 700Â°C to produce dark green VF3 (+ AIF3). The XRD of this product is shown in Figure 14. After establishing the ratio between VF3 and AlF3, this powder was mixed with TiF3 (+ AIF3) to produce the alloy powder after reduction and sublimation.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br><br>
REGENERATION OF NHaCI FROM (NU-UgFeCI* SOLUTION<br>
A problem which arises if FefOHfe is precipitated with NH4OH from the solution produced as a by-product of the selective precipitation step, as described in step 2 of Example 1 above, is its solubility in high concentrations of NH4CI. This results in very slow precipitation. Furthermore, air oxidation of Fe(OH)2 to FeO(OH) (low solubility in NH4CI) is slow and not practical and oxidation with H202 works well but the reagent is expensive.<br>
The Applicant has found that the oxidation of Fe(ll) to Fe(lll) can be enhanced by conducting a current through the solution. The following reactions take place:<br>
(NH4)2FeCI4 + current     = Fe + CI2 + 2NH4CI CI2 + 2(NH4)2FeCI4=       2FeCI3 + 4NH4CI 2FeCI3 + 6NH4OH =       SN^CI + 2FeOrOHl + 2H?0 3(NH4)2FeCI4 + BNI^OH + current     = 12NH4CI + Fe + 2FeO(OH) + 2H20<br>
Accordingly, the pH of 1 litre of the (NH^FeCL, solution produced in the selective precipitation step was increased to 4 - 5 by addition of NH4OH while stirring. As the solution / suspension was stirred, it was electrolysed using a car battery charger at a voltage of 6V and 2 graphite electrodes (any suitable electrodes can be used). A current of 6 - 9 amps was produced. This current also heated the solution to 60 -70Â°C, which aided the reaction.<br>
As the electrolysis progressed, the pH dropped and was frequently restored to 4 - 5 by addition of NH4OH. During the process, no CI2 gas was produced as it was immediately converted to chloride by the oxidation of Fe(ll) to Fe(lll). After approximately 3 hours, the pH stopped dropping indicating that the reaction was complete. Overall, approximately 300 ml of NH4OH (25%) was used.<br>
Plated Fe was recovered from the cathode and a brown-orange precipitate was readily filtered off. After drying at 80Â°C, 200g of a product consisting mostly of FeO(OH) and some T!OF2 and other impurities was obtained.<br>
The filtrate was evaporated to yield NH4CI (310g). A crude mass balance indicated that more than 80% of the NH4CI was recovered without washing the fitter cake.<br>
The plated Fe could be used in the process when iron reduction was carried out after digestion and to produce FeTi rf needed.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
REGENERATION AND HF TOP-UP<br>
The NH4F collected after the decomposition of the NH4-precursors at 600Â°C, as described in step (4) of Example 1, was reacted with a slaked lime solution to form a NH4OH solution and precipitate CaF2. NH4OH was used in the regeneration of NH4CI from (NH4)2FeCU- The CaF2 (fluorspar) produced can be sold as a by-product or treated with concentrated HzSO4 according to conventional processes to produce HF.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
PRODUCTION OF fNH^TiF* FROM ANATASE PULP.<br>
Crude anatase pulp (TiOa.xHjO) is a well-known product obtained by the aqueous hydrolysis of a Ti-solution. Essentially, all Ti feedstock materials can be converted to crude anatase pulp. To produce a concentrated solution of M"TiF6, it was necessary to add M" to obtain a mole ratio close to 1 mol M": 1 mol Ti". In this example M" was Zn2*.<br>
ZnO (40.7g, O.Smol) was added to tap water (65 ml) and stirred until the ZnO was wetted. HF (130ml, 40%, 3 mol) was slowly added to the wetted ZnO. The reaction was exothermic and not all of the ZnO dissolved. TiO2.2H2O (69.6g, 0.6 mol) was then slowly added in four portions with vigorous stirring. The reaction was exothermic and the mixture started to boil. After addition of the third portion, a dear solution was obtained. After addition of the fourth portion, which contained excess pulp, a milky colour was produced. The use of an excess of the pulp ensured that all of the HF was consumed. After 1 hour, the solution was cooled to 40Â°C and filtered. The filter cake was washed with water (1 x 20mt). NH4CI (117g, 2 mol) was added to the leachate, (approximately 200m! at 30Â°C) with vigorous stirring to produce (NH^TiFe by the following reaction:<br>
ZnTIF6(aq) + 4NH4CI (s) * (NH^TiFe (ppt) + (NH4)2ZnCI4(aq)<br>
The temperature of the mixture initially dropped to below 5Â°C and, after approximately 15 minutes of stirring, the temperature rose to about 10Â°C and the mixture was filtered. The resulting crystalline (NH^TiFe was dried at 60Â°C to produce 80.25g of crystalline product. The yield was 80%. Higher yields (greater than 90%) were produced when the process was scaled up.<br>
Unexpectedly, it was found that (NH^TiFe was not produced if the order of the reaction was reversed. If the crude anatase pulp was first digested in HF to produce aqueous H2TiF6 and the ZnO was then slowly dissolved in the H2TiF6 solution, a clear solution was produced. However, when NrttCI (s) was added to the solution, the Ti did not precipitate as (NH4)2TiF6 but instead, hydrolysis to a white insoluble precipitate occurred.<br>

PRODUCTION OF (NH^TIFeFROM RUTiLE. BROOKITE. LEUCOXENE AND<br>
TITANIFEROUS SLAG<br>
Similar results were obtained when the process of Example 5 was followed for the production of (NH^TiFe using rutile, brookite, leucoxene or titaniferous slag.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
PRODUCTION OF fNH^?TiF9 FROM ANATASE. RUTILE. BROOKITE. LEUCQXENE AND TITANIFEROUS SLAG<br>
Similar results were obtained when the process of Example 5 was followed using MgO in place of ZnO for the production of (NH^TIFe from artatase, rutile, brooktte, leucoxene or titaniferous slag.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
PRODUCTION OF TITANIUM FROM ILMENITE VIA Na REDUCTION OF<br>
Referring to Figure 16, limenKe (800g) was digested, with stirring, with 20% aqueous HF (l,5t) in a 2 litre polypropylene beaker with a loose lid. The slurry began to boil (100Â°C) after about ten minutes and boiled for about 5 minutes. The reaction mixture then began to cool. After 1 hour the temperature had dropped to 74Â°C. Steel wool (12g) was then added to reduce all iron(lll) to iron(ll) and the reaction mixture was stirred for another hour. The resulting saturated solution of FeTiF6 (1 mol Ti = 438 ml leachate) was filtered to remove insoluble material and excess ilmenite (which was recycled). The resulting leachate (1.51) contained 164g of dissolved titanium. Solid NHUCI (49,4g ; 5% excess) was added to the leachate (876ml) and the temperature dropped to about 10Â°C. The resulting solution was stirred for 1 hour in a water bath at 20'C. Filtration produced (NH4)2TiF6 (454g) as a moist white crystalline product containing 68g water (equal to a dry weight of 386g). The theoretical yield is 395.8g for 2 moles of (NH4)TiF6. The selective precipitation accordingly has an efficiency of 97.5% and produces a product with a purity of about 98%. The moist filter cake was then washed with a minimum amount of a saturated NHUCI solution (approximately 75ml), to yield a moist crystalline product (442g). This product contained about 66g of water (equal to a dry weight of 376g). indicating an efficiency of 95% and a purity of about 99%.<br>
Water (332mt) was added to the moist crystalline product (442g) and the solution was boiled at 98Â°C. All of the crystalline product dissolved and the solution was then cooled to 10Â°C. The resulting mixture was filtered and the moist filter cake was washed with a minimum amount of ice water (approximately 60ml), to yield a moist recrystallised (NhU^TiFe product (242g) containing about 37g water (equal<br>
to a dry weight of 205g and a purity of &gt;99.9%). The mother lye and wash solution were recycled.<br>
Dry NaCI (121,2g) and water (300mQ were added to the moist (NH4)2TiF8 (242g) and stirred for 30 minutes and the mixture was filtered. The filter cake was washed with a minimum amount of a saturated NaCI solution (approximately 50ml) and dried at 60*C to yield very pure crystalline Na2TiF6 (210g).<br>
This product was added to sodium metal (115g; 20% excess) in a 750ml stainless steel crucible fitted with a loose lid under an argon atmosphere. The crucible was placed in a muffle furnace (still under argon) and heated to about 700Â°C. At this temperature an exothermic reaction took place and the temperature spontaneously rose to about 900Â°C. The crucible was kept at about 900Â°C for a further 30 minutes to ensure that all of the excess sodium had evaporated, and then allowed to cool.<br>
After the crucible had cooled to room temperature, the argon flow was stopped and a product consisting of NaF and titanium (about 270g) could be removed from the crucible (theoretical yield 300g) in the form of pieces having a size of about 2-15mm. Some of the product adhered to the crucible. This granular product was placed in a 250ml sealed zirconia crucible and heated to 1700Â°C under a closed argon atmosphere, for 10 min and allowed to cool to room temperature. A titanium ingot (approximately 40g; &gt;99.9%) under a NaF slag was recovered.<br>
The recycling of NaF was tested via a separate experiment. NaF (42g;-500um) and concentrated HCI (100m(; 32%) solution were added to a 250 ml beaker with a loose lid and stirred at room temperature for 2 hours to produce an aqueous HF solution. Fine crystalline NaCI (57g after drying at 120Â°C; &gt;98%) was filtered from ttte solution (96m?). The HF was evaporated to a volume of 84ml to obtain a 20% HF solution (indicating an efficiency of about 95%).<br><br>
After the selective precipitation of (NH4)2TiF6 from FeTiFe by the NH4CI, the filtrate contained the double salt (NH,)?FeCI4 and some trace elements which behave in the same way as Fe. NHUCI was regenerated as described in Example 3.<br>
HCI and NaOH were recovered by electrolysis of a saturated NaCI solution. This is a well known industrial process and is used for example at the Chloorkop installation in South Africa on a kiloton scale.<br>
Sodium silicate was recovered from sodium hydroxide and silica as is well known in, for example, the glass industry, and the sodium silicate was converted to sodium via Si(Fe) according to known methods.<br>
EXAMPLE 9 PRODUCTION OF TITANIUM FROM ILMENITE VIA Mo REDUCTION OF<br>
Referring to Figure 17, tlmenite (800g) was digested, with 20% aqueous HF to produce a leachate as described in Example 1. Sodium sulphate (149g; 5% excess) was added to the leachate (438ml) and the solution was stirred for 1 hour at 20Â°C. The resulting suspension was filtered to produce a moist, white crystalline product which was washed with a minimum amount of a saturated Na2SO4 solution (approximately 3 x 25mQ and dried at 60*C, to give a crystalline Na2TiF6 product (195g indicating an efficiency of 94% and a purity of about 99%).<br>
The dried crystalline Na2TiF6 product (195g) was added to magnesium filings (57g; 20% excess) in a 750mt stainless steel crucible with a loose lid under an argon atmosphere. The crucible was placed in a muffle furnace (still under argon) and heated to about 700Â°C. At this temperature an exothermic reaction took place and the temperature spontaneously rose to about 900Â°C. The temperature was then<br>
raised to about 1100Â°C and kept at this temperature for about 30 minutes to ensure that all of the excess magnesium evaporated, and then allowed to cool.<br>
After the crucible had cooled to room temperature, the argon flow was stopped and the product consisting of a mixture of NaMgF3 and titanium was recovered from the crucible. Because of the iron content of the precursor, only Ti-grade 4 was obtained by melting the product at 1700'C.<br>
The recycling loops shown in Figure 17 are well known commercial processes.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
PREPARATION OF TITANIUM NITRIDE. CARBIDE. BORIDE. HYDRIDE. SUICIDE. PHOSPHIDE AND SULPHIDE<br>
The deactivated titanium powder of Example 1 was heated in the presence, respectively, of gaseous nitrogen, carbon in the form of carbon powder or coke, diborane, gaseous hydrogen, powdered silicon, phosphine and powdered sulphur to produce titanium nitride, carbide, boride, hydride, silicide, phosphide and sulphide respectively.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
There are several clear advantages associated with the process of the invention when compared with prior art processes.<br>
(1) Firstly, the process of the invention uses Inexpensive starting materials, such as ilmeniie, which is readily available in large quantities.<br>
(2) The by-products produced In the process are ail recycled and there is consequently very little overall reagent consumption.<br>
(3)	The process of the invention also provides a route to titanium which involves a<br>
protective fluoride coating as described above.<br>
(4)	It is a further advantage of the process of the invention that the intermediate<br>
(NHOzTiFe, which was previously not commercially available, is used instead<br>
of a precursor such as TiCU. The salt (NH4)TiF6 is stable in air and water, it is<br>
non-corrosive and is easy to prepare in an aqueous medium at ambient<br>
temperature. On the other hand, TiCU is a very toxic liquid which decomposes<br>
violently in air and water and is highly corrosive.   It is difficult to prepare,<br>
requiring temperatures of the order of 1000Â°C and is in the gas form during the<br>
reduction step.   Titanium produced via TICU is expensive and is prone to<br>
contamination by 0, N, H and C because of the absence of the fluoride<br>
coating associated with the method of the invention.<br>
(5)	It is a further major advantage that the titanium produced in accordance with<br>
the method of the invention has a cost comparable with that of high grade<br>
stainless steel.<br><br>
(6)	It is a further advantage that aluminium, which is substantially cheaper than<br>
either sodium or magnesium (as used In prior art processes), is used In the<br>
reduction step, without any aluminium alloy formation in the end product.<br>
(7)	Furthermore, the process of the invention produces titanium powder at a<br>
temperature well below the melting point of titanium.    This results in<br>
substantially cheaper pyrometallurglcal operations. This powder can then be<br>
used in classical powder metallurgy techniques to produce near net shape<br>
articles. This results in substantially less wastage when compared with prior<br>
art processes using titanium ingots. However, if titanium ingots are required<br>
the powder can readily be melted in a single stage melting process for<br>
example in an induction furnace because it is protected by the AIF3 coating.<br>
The AIF3 additionally acts as a flux during the melting of the powder.<br>
(6) It is a particular advantage of the invention that, when preparing titanium alloys as described in Example 2, the other metal fluoride salt or salts can readily be homogeneously mixed with TiFj so that a homogeneous dispersion of the other metal or metals in the alloy is obtained. Prior art methods of producing homogeneous alloys by mixing the molten metals are practically very difficult.<br>
(9) It is a further advantage of the invention that the process can be carried out using technical grade aqueous HF which is substantially cheaper than chemically pure aqueous HF.<br>
Table 1 shows for comparison purposes the typical chemical composition, mechanical properties and physical properties of commercially available corrosion-resistant titanium alloys.TABLE 1<br>

(Table Removed) CONCLUSIONS<br>
In summary, the Applicant has found that a very pure titanium precursor can be produced in high yield from ilmenite (which is the cheapest source of titanium) and that this precursor can be used to produce titanium metal with oxygen levels which are lower than those of commercial grade 1 titanium. The low oxygen content increases the malleability of the metal. The metal is also protected from oxidation during forging via a metal fluoride based coating. The Applicant believes that the method of the invention will allow titanium to be produced at a cost which is approximately the same as that of high-grade stainless steel. This would greatly increase the world market for titanium.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
