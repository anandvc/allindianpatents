				<td>HEAT STABILIZED MOULDING COMPOSITION<br>
The invention relates to thermo-stabilized thermoplastic moulding compositions comprising a thermoplastic polyamide and a heat stabilizing system comprising a finely dispersed metal powder and to the use of such moulding compositions in high temperature applications.<br>
A high-temperature-use application for a moulded article is herein understood to be an application wherein the moulded article during its normal useful lifetime is in contact with a heat source which frequently attains and/or which attains for a longer period a temperature of at least 140°C. The heat source may be a heat producing device or a heated device or may be the surrounding environment wherein the moulded article is subjected to conditions with temperatures of at least 140°C. Such high-temperature-use applications are regularly met for articles used in the electro-, electronic, and automotive industry. Examples of heated devices or heat generating devices are engines, or elements thereof, and electronic devices such as semiconductors. For the automotive segment high-temperature-use application are regularly found in so-called under-the-hood or under-the-bonnet applications, herein referred to as high temperature automotive applications. Therefore, the invention in particular relates to moulded articles for use in the electro-, electronic, and automotive industry.<br>
Moulded articles for the electro, electronic and automotive industry and moulding compositions based on thermoplastic materials used for these applications generally have to comply with a complex property profile, including, for the compositions as moulded, good dimensional stability, high heat distortion temperature (HDT) and good mechanical properties, such as a high tensile strength, tensile modulus and fatigue. As indicated above, moulded articles that serve in automotive under-the-hood applications and in several electric or electronic applications can be subjected to relatively high temperatures for a prolonged period. The compositions generally tend to show a decrease in mechanical properties due to thermal degradation of the polymer. This effect is called heat ageing. This effect can occur to an undesirable extent. In particular with polyamides as the thermoplastic polymer, the deteriorating effect of exposure to high temperatures can be very dramatic. Generally the polyamide containing materials used for the indicated applications contain a heat stabilizer. The function of a heat stabilizer is to better retain the properties of the composition upon exposure of the moulded article to elevated temperature. When using a heat stabilizer,<br><br>
the useful lifetime of the moulded material can be extended significantly, depending on the type of material, use conditions and type and amount of heat stabilizer. Examples of heat stabilizers typically used in polyamides are organic stabilizers, like phenolic antioxidants and aromatic amines, and copper, either In the form of a copper salt in combination with potassium, iodide or potassium bromide, or in the form of elementary copper. Phenolic antioxidants and aromatic amines are generally used for stabilisation at elevated temperatures up to about 130°C. Copper containing stabilizers are suitable for stabilisation at higher temperatures and have been available for many years.<br>
Moulded articles for the electro, electronic and automotive industry, and a thermo-stabilized moulding composition comprising a thermoplastic polyamide and a copper based heat stabilizer used therefore are known from EP-0612794-B1. The thermoplastic polyamide in the known composition is an aliphatic or aromatic polyamide. As the heat stabilizer in the known composition, both copper iodide/potassium iodide and in-situ formed finely dispersed elementary copper are mentioned. The copper iodide/potassium iodide containing composition was formed by a compounding process comprising simply melt-mixing of the constituting components of the composition. The composition comprising elementary copper was formed by a compounding process, wherein the polyamide was melt-mixed with an ionic or complex copper stabilizer and a reducing agent, and wherein the elementary copper was formed in-situ. The known composition comprising in-situ prepared elementary copper is said in EP-0612794-B1 to have a much better resistance against thermal oxidation and influence of light than the copper salt / potassium iodide containing composition. The finely dispersed elementary copper is said to be only effective as a heat stabiliser when it is prepared in-situ. When elementary copper prepared in advance of the melt-mixing process, In casu by using colloidal copper In a melt-mixing process for preparing a heat stabilised composition, the heat ageing performance of that composition was not essentially better than that of the copper iodide/potassium iodide containing composition, as noted In EP-0612794-B1. The heat ageing performance of these materials was tested at a temperature of 140°C.<br>
In many applications for thermoplastic moulding compositions, retention of mechanical properties after long-term exposure to temperatures as high as 160°C, or even 180°C - 200°C and higher becomes a basic requisite. The number of specialty applications, requiring compositions with improved heat ageing properties is also increasing. A disadvantage of the moulded articles prepared with the known<br>
composition is that the thermal stability at higher temperatures is still too low.<br>
The aim of the invention is therefore to provide moulding<br>
compositions, which have better heat ageing properties than the known compositions, thereby providing for the possibility to make moulded articles that can be used at higher continuous use temperatures than the moulded articles prepared with the known compositions.<br>
This aim has been achieved with the use of a metal powder, wherein the metal powder has a weight average particle size (dm) of at most 1 mm and the metal in the metal powder is selected from the group consisting of elementary metals from Group VB, VIB, VIIB and VIIIB of the Periodic Table, and mixtures thereof, for preparing thermo-stabilized thermoplastic moulding compositions, and with the thermo-stabilized thermoplastic moulding compositions according to the invention, comprising a metal powder, wherein the metal powder has a weight average particle size (dm) of at most 1 mm and the metal in the metal powder is selected from the group consisting of elementary metals from Group VB, VIB, VIIB and VIIIB of the Periodic Table, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Surprisingly, the metals of Group VB, VIB, VIIB and VIIIB of the Periodic Table in the specified particle size range are very effective heat stabilizers. These metals will also be referred herein as "Group VB-VIIB transition metals". The metals of Group VB, VIB, VIIB and VIIIB of the Periodic Table include the metals: Group VB: vanadium (V), niobium (Nb), tantalium (Ta); Group VI: chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), and tungsten (W), Group VIIB: manganese (Win), technetium (Tc) and rhenium (Re); and Group Vlll: iron (Fe), ruthenium (Ru), osmium (Os), cobalt (Co), rhodium (Rh), iridium (Ir), nickel (Ni), palladium (Pd), and platinum (Ft). The effect of the use of these metals in their elementary state in the form of a metal powder having a weight average particle size (dm) of at most 1 mm in a thermoplastic moulding composition is a remarkable improvement in heat ageing properties, compared to the known copper salt/potassium iodide containing compositions as well as in respect of the known elementary copper containing compositions. This improvement in heat ageing properties is exhibited by a much better retention of the mechanical properties at elevated temperature. This effect is highly surprising since elementary metals like iron are known to have a deleterious effect on the melt stability of polymers like polyamides.<br>
Moreover, this heat stabilizing effect is achieved even with moulding compositions which are prepared by a process involving simply melt-mixing of<br>
elementary metal with the other components of the composition. For obtaining the heat stabilizing effect according to the invention in-situ preparation of the finely dispersed elementary metal powder is not required. The compositions according to the invention may be prepared, for example, by using a metal powder finely dispersed in a carrier polymer.<br>
Preferably, the metal powder that is used as a heat stabilizer comprises elementary iron, more preferably consists, at least essentially, of elementary iron.<br>
The said metal powder of the metals of Group VB, VIB, VIIB and VI1IB of the Periodic Table can advantageously be used in preparing a thermo-stabilized non-fibrous-reinforced thermoplastic moulding composition consisting of<br>
a)	a polymer composition comprising at least one thermoplastic polyamide, and<br>
b)	a thermo-stabllizing system, comprising a finely dispersed metal powder,<br>
and, optionally,<br>
c)	non-fibrous inorganic fillers and / or<br>
d)	other auxiliary additives, not comprising fibrous reinforcing agents,<br>
The invention in particular relates to a non-fibrous-reinforced thermoplastic moulding composition wherein<br>
a.1. the at least one thermoplastic polyamide has a weight average molecular<br>
mass Mw of at most 50,000 g/mol,<br>
b.1. the metal powder has a weight average particle size (dm) of at most 1 mm and the metal in the metal powder is selected from the group consisting of elementary metals from Group VB, VIB, VIIB and VIIIB of the Periodic Table, and mixtures thereof, and<br>
c.1. the composition comprises at least 10 mass % non-fibrous filler, relative to the total mass of the composition.<br>
The invention also relates to a non-fibrous-reinforced thermoplastic moulding composition wherein<br>
a.1. the at least one thermoplastic polyamide is a semi-crystalline polymer having a melting temperature (Tm-1) or an amorphous polymer having a glass transition temperature (Tg-1), wherein Tm-1 and Tg-1 together are denoted asT1,<br>
a.2. the polymer composition comprises a second thermoplastic polymer, being a semi-crystalline polymer having a melting temperature (Tm-2) or an amorphous polymer having a glass transition temperature (Tg-2), wherein<br>
Tm-1 and Tg-1 together are denoted as T2, and T2 is at least 20°C lower than T1, and<br>
b.1. the metal powder has a weight average particle size (dm) of at most 1 mm and the metal in the metal powder is selected from the group consisting of elementary metals from Group VB, VIB, VlIB and VIIIB of the Periodic Table, and mixtures thereof.<br>
With the term melting temperature is herein understood the melting temperature measured according to ASTM D3417-97/D3418-97 by DSC with a heating rate of 10°C/minute and determined as the temperature with the highest melting enthalpy. With the term glass transition temperature is herein understood the temperature measured according to ASTM E 1356-91 by DSC with a heating rate of 20°C/minute and determined as the temperature at the peak of the first derivative (with respect of time) of the parent thermal curve corresponding with the inflection point of the parent thermal curve.<br>
The invention also relates in particular to a non-fibrous-reinforced thermoplastic moulding composition wherein<br>
b,1. the metal powder has a weight average particle size (dm) of at most 1 mm and the metal in the metal powder Is selected from the group consisting of-elementary metals from Group VB, VIB, VlIB and VIIIB of the Periodic Table, and mixtures thereof, and<br>
b.2. thermo-stabilizing system further comprises a second thermostabilizer. The compositions according to the invention have in common the inventive feature that they comprise a thermo-stabilizing system comprising a finely dispersed metal powder wherein the metal powder has a weight average particle size (dm) of at most 1 mm and the metal in the metal powder is selected from the group consisting of elementary metals from Group VB, VIB, VlIB and VIIIB of the Periodic Table, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Compositions comprising a thermoplastic polyamide and finely dispersed elementary iron are known from several patent publications, for example, in US 6,369,148 relating to mono-layer and multi-layered barrier materials used in film and foils for packaging applications. In these patent publications the elementary metal is used as an oxygen scavenger. The known compositions are said to be particularly suited for extrusion coating application in a wide variety of oxygen-scavenging packaging articles.<br>
US 6,369,148 does not describe the heat ageing effect of Iron, or any of the other "Group VB-VIIB transition metals" as according to the present invention. US 6,369,148 does neither describe non-fibrous-reinforced thermoplastic moulding compositions, suitable for injection moulding and comprising a Group VB-VII1B transition metal, fillers and a thermoplastic polyamide with limited Mw, or comprising a Group VB-VIIIB transition metal and a copper salt or a second lower melting thermoplastic polymer, nor the good properties heat-ageing properties thereof and the suitability thereof for. making moulded articles for high-temperature-use applications such as electronic parts and automotive under the hood parts.<br>
In the context of the present invention a fibrous-reinforced thermoplastic moulding composition is understood to be a thermoplastic moulding composition comprising a fibrous reinforcing agent, whereas in analogy a non-fibrous-reinforced thermoplastic moulding composition is understood to be a thermoplastic moulding composition not comprising a fibrous reinforcing agent. A fibrous reinforcing agent is considered herein to be a material having length, width and thickness, wherein the average length is significantly larger than both the width and thickness. More specifically, a fibrous reinforcing agent is understood herein to be a material having an aspect ratio L/D, defined as the number average ratio between the length (L) and the largest of the width and thickness (D) of at least 5. Preferably, the aspect ratio of the fibrous reinforcing agent Is at least 10, more preferably at least 20, still more preferably at least 50.<br>
Finely dispersed elementary metal is understood herein to be elementary metal dispersed, in the form of small particles, in a continuous polymeric medium. The continuous polymeric medium forms a continuous phase and can consist of, for example, a thermoplastic polymer or a carrier polymer.<br>
In the compositions according to the invention metal powder of a Group VB-VIIIB transition metal or mixtures thereof are used. A metal powder is understood herein to be elementary metal present in the form of particles, the majority of which having a small particle size. Typically such a material has a particle size distribution with the majority of the particles have a particle size of for example, of at most 2 mm. In general, the elementary metal has a weight average particle size (dm) of at most 1 mm. The weight average particle size is determined as Dm according to ASTM standard D1921-89, method A.<br>
Preferably dm is at most 500 µm. Suitably; dm is at most 400 µm, or<br>
8<br>
300 µm. It is further preferred that the elementary metal has a weight average particle size of at most 200µm, more preferably at most 100µm, and still more preferably at most 50µm. The elementary metal may have a very small particle size with a weight average particle size of, for example, 10 or 5µm and even lower. Most suitably, dm is at most 1-150 µm. The advantage of a smaller weight average particle size is that the metal powder is a more effective heat-stabilizer.<br>
Preferably, the metal powder that is used in the compositions according to the invention comprises elementary iron, more preferably the metal powder consists, at least essentially, of elementary iron.<br>
Suitable metal powder of a Group VB-VIIIB transition metal, which can be used for the preparation of the moulding compositions according to the invention, is, for example, SCM Iron Powder A-131, available form SMC Metal Products, Ohio, which powder comprises elementary iron.<br>
The amount of elementary metal used for preparing the moulding compositions according to the invention can be varied over a wide range. The Group VB-VIIIB transition metals, and in particular elementary iron, are very effective stabilisers, showing an effect already at very low amounts. Practically, these elementary metal can be used in an amount of at least 0.01 parts by weight (further herein abbreviated as "pbw"), relative to 100 pbw of the polymer composition in the moulding composition. More preferably the amount of the elementary metal is at least 0.05 pbw, still more preferably at least 0.10 pbw, and most preferably at least 0.20 pbw, relative to 100 parts by weight of polymer composition in the moulding composition. The advantage of a higher amount of elementary metal, relative to the weight of polymer composition in the moulding composition, is that the composition has better heat-ageing properties.<br>
On the other hand the amount may be as high or even higher than 10 parts by weight, relative to 100 parts by weight of polymer composition in the moulding composition. However, with 2 to 5 pbw relative to 100 parts by weight of thermoplastic polymer already such good heat aging properties are obtained that use of a higher amount brings relative little improvement.<br>
The metal powder that is used for preparing the moulding compositions according to invention may suitably have the form of a masterbatch of a metal powder finely dispersed in a carrier polymer. Also the moulding compositions according to invention may suitably consist of a dry blend of ingredients comprising a<br>
masterbatch of the metal powder finely dispersed in a carrier polymer. The carrier polymer that can be used in the masterbatch may be the same as the at least one thermoplastic polyamide in the polymer composition, as well as another polymer, such as a lower melting thermoplastic polymer, an elastomer or a rubber.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the carrier polymer is the same polymer as the thermoplastic polyamide. The advantage thereof is maximum compatibility between carrier polymer and thermoplastic polyamide.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the carrier polymer is an elastomer or a rubber. This has the advantage that the composition according to the invention has improved impact resistance, while the need for adding a separate impact modifier is reduced or can be avoided completely.<br>
Suitable rubbers that can be used as the carrier polymer are for example, SBS rubber and EPDM rubber.<br>
The carrier polymer may also advantageiy be a thermoplastic polymer, more particularly a thermoplastic polymer with a low melting temperature. Suitable low melting thermoplastic polymers that can be used as a carrier polymer are, for example, polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), PE/PP copolymers, polyamides (PA) and polyesters (PES).<br>
The masterbatch of elementary metal finely dispersed in a carrier polymer may be prepared, for example, by adding elementary metal powder having a small average particle size, to a melt of a carrier polymer in a melt-mixing apparatus, such as an extruder.<br>
A masterbatch of elementary metal finely dispersed in a carrier polymer, suitable for use in the process according to the invention is, for example, Shelfplus 02 2400, a masterbatch of elementary iron, ex Ciba, Switzerland.<br>
The thermoplastic polyamide that can be used in the moulding compositions according to the invention, may be any type of thermoplastic polyamide suitable for use in reinforced moulding compositions for applications involving exposure to elevated temperature. The thermoplastic polyamide can be, for example, an amorphous polymer or a semi-crystalline polymer.

The polyamide may optionally contain modified end groups, for example amine end groups modified with a mono-carboxylic acid and/or carboxylic acid end groups modified with a mono-functional amine. Modified end-groups in the polyamide may advantageously be applied for improved melt-stability of the composition during its preparation by melt mixing or during a moulding process of said composition.<br>
Preferably polyamides are chosen from the group consisting of PA-6, PA-6,6, PA-6,10, PA-4,6, PA-11, PA-12, PA-12,12, PA-6,1, PA-6.T, PA-6.I/6.T-copolyamide, PA-e.T/e.B-copolyamide, PA-6,T/6-copolyamide, PA-6/6,6-copolyamide, PA-6,6/6,T/6,l-copolyamide, PA-6,T72-MPMD,T- copolyamide, PA-9.T, PA-9T/2-MOMD.T-copolyamide, PA-4,6/6-copolyamide and mixtures and copolyamides of the aforementioned polyamides.

9,T, PA-9Ty2-MOMD,T-copolyamide or PA-4,6, or a mixture or copolyamide thereof, is chosen as the polyamide.<br>
Generally, the at least one thermoplastic polyamide used in the compositions according to the invention and intended for high-temperature-use applications is a semi-crystalline or crystalline polymer or a thermoplastic elastomer, having a melting temperature (Tm-1) of at least 180°C, or an amorphous polymer having a glass transition temperature (Tg-1) of at least 180°C.

The advantage of a higher melting temperature or glass transition temperature for the . thermoplastic polyamide in the moulding compositions according to the invention, is that the heat distortion temperature (HOT) of the moulding compositions is higher and more particularly that the effect of the elementary metal on the heat-ageing properties at the temperature corresponding with said higher HOT is more emphasized, allowing a further increase in the maximum use temperature for the composition.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the polymer composition in the moulding composition comprises, next to the at least one thermoplastic polyamide having T1 as described above, a second thermoplastic polymer being a semi-crystalline polymer having a melting temperature (Tm-2) or an amorphous polymer having a glass transition temperature (Tg-2), wherein Tm-2 and Tg-2 together are denoted as T2, and wherein T2 is at least 20°C lower than T1.<br>
The advantage of the moulding composition according to the invention wherein the polymer composition comprises, next to the at least one thermoplastic polyamide, denoted as the first thermoplastic polymer with T1, a second thermoplastic polymer having a melting temperature, or where applicable as described above a glass transition temperature, T2, at least 20°C lower than the corresponding temperature T1 for the first thermoplastic polyamide, is that the heat ageing properties of the moulding composition at temperatures around or above T2 is increased. A further advantage thereof is that the amount of the elementary metal, in particular iron, can be limited thereby keeping the deleterious effect of Iron on the melt stability of polymers like polyamides better under control.<br>
More preferably, T2 is at least 30°C, still more preferably at least 40°C and most preferably at least 60°C lower than T1.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the polymer composition in the moulding composition according to the invention comprises a blend of a first polymer, being either a semi-crystalline thermoplastic polyamide or an amorphous thermoplastic polyamide with T1 at least 260°C, and a second thermoplastic polymer with a T2 of at most 240°C.

Examples of suitable metal salts are for example, nickel dithiocarbamates (like Hastavin VPN1CS1), zinc dithiocarbamates (like hostanox VPZnCSI) and copper salts. The presence of the second thermostabilizer<br>
selected from the said group, next to the Group VB-VHIB transition metal has the advantage that the heat ageing properties of the moulding compositions are even further improved. In particular good results are obtained when the second thermostabilizer is a copper salt.<br>

The amount of fibrous reinforcing agent that Is used in the fibrous-reinforced moulding composition according to the invention can be varied over a large range. Generally that amount ranges from 5 to 300 parts by weight (pbw) relative to 100 pbw of the polymer composition. Preferably, the amount is 10-235 pbw, more preferably 15-150 pbw, relative to 100 pbw of the polymer composition.<br>
The moulding compounds according to the invention can be prepared using any known melt-mixing process that is suitable for preparing fibre-reinforced and non-fibrous reinforced thermoplastic moulding compositions. Such a process is typically carried out by heating the thermoplastic polyamide above the melting temperature or in case the thermoplastic polyamide is an amorphous polymer above the glass transition temperature of the thermoplastic polyamide, thereby forming a melt of the thermoplastic polyamide.<br>
The preparation can be carried out in a melt-mixing apparatus, for which any melt-mixing apparatus known to the man skilled in the art of preparing polymer compositions by melt mixing can be used. Suitable melt-mixing apparatus are,<br>
for example, kneaders, Banburry mixers, single-screw extruders and twin-screw extruders. Preferably, use is made of an extruder fitted with means for dosing all the desired components to the extruder, either to the extruder's throat or to the meit.<br>
In the preparation the constituting components for forming the composition are fed to the melt-mixing apparatus and melt-mixed in that apparatus. The constituting components may be fed simultaneously as a powder mixture or granule mixer, also known-as dry-blend, or may be fed separately. The preparation process is not limited in the way the elementary metal is added.

The invention also relates to a three-dimensional net-shaped moulded part consisting of a non-fibrous-reinforced thermoplastic moulding composition or fibrous-reinforced thermoplastic moulding composition according to the invention or any of the preferred embodiments thereof described hereabove.<br>
A three dimensional part is understood herein to be a part with a complex shape having extensions, walls and/or ribs or alike, which prevent the part to be easily, I.e. with low force and without damaging the part, to be converted into a flat shape like a film, a foil or a thin plate, as is the case for many parts used in high temperature applications.<br>
A net shaped moulded part is understood herein to be a part that, after it is moulded, such as by injection moulding, further machining of the part is not necessary, or only to limited extent, such as by removing some flash, because the part has been moulded in its final shape and configuration as actual used. Generally, the part has a thickness of at least 0.5 mm, though the parts may have a lower thickness as well. Preferably, the part has a thickness of at least 1 mm, more preferably at least 2 mm, and still more preferably at least 4 mm. The advantage of the part having a higher thickness is that the mechanical properties are better retained under heat ageing conditions at elevated temperature.<br>
More particular, the moulded part Is a moulded part for use in machines and engines, which can be applied, for example, in automotive vehicles, such as personal cars, motor bikes, trucks and vans, general transport means, including trains, aviation and ships, domestic appliances, such as lawn mowers and small engines, and general industry installations, such as in pumps, compressors, conveyor belts, or a moulded part for use in electric and electronic installations, such as in domestic power tools and portable power equipment.<br>
The part may be, for example, an engine part, such as an exhaust system part, a bearing, a gear box, an engine cover, an air duct, an intake manifold, an intercooler end-cap, a castor, or a trolley part, or a non-conductive electronic part (such as connectors, bolts and coil bobbins).<br>
The invention also relates to the use of a moulded part according to the invention in engines, machines, electric and electronic installations, and further to<br>
engines, machines and assembled articles comprising a moulded part according to the invention.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to products, including automotive vehicles, general transport means, domestic appliances, and general industry installations, electric and electronic installations, comprising a moulded part according to the invention. The advantage is that, due to the reduced deterioration by exposure to elevated temperature of the moulded part, the service life time of the said products is longer and/or replacement of the said moulded part can be delayed, and/or that the product can be operated at higher temperature, compared with a corresponding product comprising a moulded part made of the known composition comprising a copper iodide/ potassium iodide stabilizing system.<br>
