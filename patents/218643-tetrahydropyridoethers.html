And the salts of these compounds.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be prepared as described by way of example in the following examples, or using analogous process steps starting from appropriate starting compounds<br>
7<br><br>
(see, for example, EP-A-0 299 470 or Kaminski et al., J. Med. Chem. 1985, 28, 876-892). The starting compounds are known or can be prepared analogously to the known compounds The compounds according to the invention can be prepared for example starting from N-protected 8-amino-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines according to the following reaction scheme:<br><br><br>
NHPiv<br><br>
H3C       CH3<br><br><br><br><br><br>
*-(!)<br><br><br>
The above scheme represents an example of an enantioselective synthesis. The N-protected (Piv represents a customary protective group, preferably the pivaloyl group), 8-aminoimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine deprotonated in the 7-position is reacted with an enantiomerically pure dioxolane. This initially leads to a condensation product which can be cyclized under strongly acidic conditions with removal of the protecting groups. The subsequent reduction of the keto group using sodium borohydride leads in over 90% enantiomeric purity to the 7,8-trans-diol indicated. The subsequent etherification which is carried out according to known processes, e.g. as described in the Examples, leads to the final products of formula 1* in which R2a and R3b are hydrogen. The corresponding 7,8-cis-compound is obtained from the mother liquor, which is left after separating off the 7,8-trans-compound, by chromatographic purification.<br>
8<br><br>
The substances according to the invention are isolated and purified in a manner known per se, for example, by distilling off the solvent in vacuo and recrystallizing the residue obtained from a suitable solvent or subjecting it to one of the customary purification methods, such as, for example, column chromatography on suitable support material.<br>
Salts are obtained by dissolving the free compound in a suitable solvent, e.g. in a chlorinated hydrocarbon, such as dichloromethane or chloroform, or a low molecular weight aliphatic alcohol (ethanol, isopropanol) which contains the desired acid, or to which the desired acid is subsequently added. The salts are obtained by filtering, reprecipitating, precipitating with a nonsolvent for the addition salt or by evaporating the solvent. Salts obtained can be converted by alkalization or by acidification into the free compounds, which in turn can be converted into salts. In this way, pharmacologically intolerable salts can be converted into pharmacologically tolerable salts.<br>
The pure enantiomers, in particular the pure enantiomers of the formula I*, to which the invention preferably relates, can be obtained in a manner familiar to the person skilled in the art, for example by enantioselective synthesis (see, for example, the Scheme), by chromatographic separation on chiral separating columns, by derivatization with chiral auxiliary reagents, subsequent separation of diastereomers and removal of the chiral auxiliary group, by salt formation with chiral acids, subsequent separation of the salts and liberation of the desired compound from the salt, or by (fractional) crystallization from a suitable solvent. Trans-products obtained (with R2a and R3b = hydrogen) can be converted (at least partly) to the corresponding cis-products (with R2b and R3b = hydrogen) by standing under acidic conditions (e.g. 2 equivalents of acid, such as sulfuric acid) in the corresponding alcohol R2a-OH. Likewise, cis-products obtained can be converted to the corresponding trans-products. The cis- and trans-products are separated e.g. by chromatography or by crystallization.<br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the invention further without restricting it. Likewise, further compounds of the formula I whose preparation is not described explicitly can be prepared analogously or in a manner familiar to the person skilled in the art using customary process techniques. The abbreviation min stands for minute(s), h for hour(s) and ee for enantiomeric excess.<br>

Commercial utility<br>
The compounds of the formula I and their salts have useful pharmacological properties which make them commercially utilizable. In particular, they exhibit a marked inhibition of gastric acid secretion and an excellent gastric and intestinal protective action in warm-blooded animals, in particular humans. In this context, the compounds according to the invention are distinguished by a high selectivity of action, an advantageous duration of action, a particularly good enteral activity, the absence of significant side effects and a large therapeutic breadth.<br>
"Gastric and intestinal protection" in this connection is understood as meaning the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, in particular of gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases and lesions (such as, for example, stomach ulcers, duodenal ulcers, gastritis, hyperacidic or medicament-related functional gastropathy), which can be caused, for example, by microorganisms (e.g. Helicobacter pylori), bacterial toxins, medicaments (e.g. certain antiinflammatories and antirheumatics), chemicals (e.g. ethanol), gastric acid or stress situations.<br>
In their excellent properties, the compounds according to the invention surprisingly prove to be clearly superior to the compounds known from the prior art in various models in which the antiulcerogenic and the antisecretory properties are determined. On account of these properties, the compounds of the formula I and their pharmacologically tolerable salts are outstandingly suitable for use in human and veterinary medicine, where they are used, in particular, for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of disorders of the stomach and/or intestine.<br>
The invention therefore further relates to the compounds according to the invention for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the abovementioned diseases.<br>
The invention likewise comprises the use of the compounds according to the invention for the production of medicaments which are employed for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the abovementioned diseases.<br>
The invention furthermore comprises the use of the compounds according to the invention for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the abovementioned diseases.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to medicaments which contain one or more compounds of the formula I and/or their pharmacologically tolerable salts.<br>
The medicaments are prepared by processes known per se, which are familiar to the person skilled-in the art. As medicaments, the pharmacologically active compounds according to the invention (= active compounds) are employed either as such, or preferably in combination with suitable pharmaceutical auxiliaries or excipiehts in the form of tablets, coated tablets, capsules, suppositories, patches (e.g. as TTS), emulsions, suspensions or solutions, where the active compound content is advantageously<br>
16<br><br>
between 0.1 and 95% and where, by the appropriate choice of the auxiliaries and excipients, a pharmaceutical administration form (e.g. a delayed-release form or an enteric form) exactly suited to the active compound and/or to the desired onset of action can be achieved.<br>
The person skilled in the art is familiar, on the basis of his expert knowledge, with auxiliaries or excipients which are suitable for the desired pharmaceutical formulations. Beside solvents, gel-forming agents, suppository bases, tablet auxiliaries and other active compound carriers, it is possible to use, for example, antioxidants, dispersants, emulsifiers, antifoams, flavor corrigents, preservatives, solubilizers, colorants or, in particular, permeation promoters and complexing agents (e.g. cyclodextrins).<br>
The active compounds can be administered orally, parenterally or percutaneously.<br>
In general, it has proven advantageous in human medicine to administer the active compound(s) in the case of oral administration in a daily dose from approximately 0.01 to approximately 20, preferably 0.05 to 5, in particular 0.1 to 1.5, mg/kg of body weight, if appropriate in the form of several, preferably 1 to 4, individual doses to achieve the desired result. In the case of parenteral treatment, similar or (in particular in the case of intravenous administration of the active compounds), as a rule, lower doses can be used. The optimal dose and manner of administration of the active compounds necessary in each case can easily be determined by any person skilled in the art on the basis of his expert knowledge.<br>
If the compounds according to the invention and/or their salts are to be employed for the treatment of the abovementioned diseases, the pharmaceutical preparations can also contain one or more pharmacologically active constituents of other pharmaceutical groups. Examples which may be mentioned are: tranquilizers (for example from the benzodiazapines group, e.g. diazepam), spasmolytics (e.g. bietamiverine or camylofin), anticholinergics (e.g. oxyphencyclimine or phencarbamide), local anesthetics (e.g. tetracaine or procaine), and, if appropriate, also enzymes, vitamins or amino acids.<br>
To be emphasized in this connection, in particular, is the combination of the compounds according to the invention with pharmaceuticals which inhibit acid secretion, such as, for example, H2 blockers (e.g. cimetidine, ranitidine), H+/K+ - ATPase inhibitors (e.g. omeprazole, pantoprazole), or furthermore with so-called peripheral anticholinergics (e.g. pirenzepine, telenzepine), and with gastrin antagonists with the aim of increasing the main action in an additive or superadditive sense and/or of eliminating or decreasing the side effects, or furthermore the combination with antibacterially active substances (e.g. cephalosporins, tetracyclines, penicillins, macrolides, nitroimidazoles or alternatively bismuth salts)for the control of Helicobacter pylori. Antibacterially active combination components which may be mentioned are, for example, mezlocillin, ampiciilin, amoxycillin, cefalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime,-imipenem, gentamycin, amikacin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, clarithromycin, azithromycin and combinations thereof (e.g. clarithromycin + metronidazole).<br>

Methodology<br>
The abdomen of anesthetized rats (CD rat, female, 200-250g; 1.5g/kg i.m. urethane) was opened after tracheotomy by means of a median upper abdominal incision and a PVC catheter was fixed transorally in the esophagus and another via the pylorus such that the ends of the tube just projected into the gastric lumen. The catheter leading from the pylorus led outwards into the right abdominal wall through a side opening.<br>
After thorough rinsing (about 50-100 ml), warm physiological NaCI solution at 37°C was continuously passed through the stomach (0.5 ml/min, pH 6.8-6.9; Braun-Unita I). The pH (pH meter 632, glass<br>
electrode EA 147; o = 5 mm, Metrohm) and, by titration with a freshly prepared 0.01 N NaOH solution to pH 7 (Dosimat 665 Metrohm), the secreted HCI were determined in the effluent in each case collected at an interval of 15 minutes.<br>
18<br><br>
The gastric secretion was stimulated by continuous infusion of 1 ug/kg (= 1.65 ml/h) of i.v. pentagastrin (left femoral vein) about 30 min after the end of the operation (i.e. after determination of 2 preliminary   . fractions). The substances to be tested were administered intravenously in 1 ml/kg liquid volumes 60 min after the start of the pentagastrin continuous infusion.<br>
The body temperature of the animals was kept at a constant 37.8-38°C by infrared irradiation and heat pads (automatic, stepless control by means of a rectal temperature sensor).<br>
