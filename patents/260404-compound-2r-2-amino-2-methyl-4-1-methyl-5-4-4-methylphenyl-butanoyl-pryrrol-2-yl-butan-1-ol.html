				<td>DESCRIPTION AMINO ALCOHOL COMPOUND<br>
[TECHNICAL FIELD]<br>
The present invention relates to an amino alcohol compound<br>
having superior immunosuppressive activity or a<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, and to a<br>
pharmaceutical composition having peripheral blood lymphocyte<br>
count lowering activity that demonstrates superior physical<br>
properties and pharmacokinetics.<br>
[BACKGROUND ART]<br>
Conventionally in the treatment of immunity-related<br>
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune<br>
diseases, anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroids have been<br>
used against inflammatory reactions caused by an abnormal immune<br>
response. However, this treatment is merely a nosotropic<br>
therapy, and does not constitute a fundamental cure.<br>
In addition, whilst abnormalities of the immune system<br>
have also been reported to be involved in the onset of diabetes<br>
and nephritis (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 1), a drug<br>
has yet to be developed capable of correcting these<br>
abnormalities.<br>
On the other hand, development of a method for suppressing<br>
the immune response is extremely important for preventing<br>
rejection reactions during organ and cell transplants, and for<br>
treating and preventing various autoimmune diseases. However,<br>
conventionally known immunosuppressants such as Cyclosporin A<br>
(CsA) and Tacrolimus (TRL) are known to demonstrate toxicity to<br>
the kidneys and liver, and although therapies combining their<br>
use with steroids are widely used to diminish such adverse side<br>
effects, these drugs are still unable to demonstrate adequate<br>
immunosuppressive effects without causing adverse side effects.<br>
In view of these circumstances, attempts have been made to<br>
discover compounds having low toxicitv and superior .'<br>
immunosuppressive activity.<br>
The following lists examples of known immunosuppressants.<br>
(1) A compound of the general formula (a) is known as an<br>
immunosuppressant (see, for example, Patent Document 1) -.<br>
[Chemical Formula 1]<br><br>
{in compound (a), Rx represents an optionally substituted,<br>
linear or branched carbon chain [which may have a double bond,<br>
triple bond, oxygen, sulfur, -N(RX6)- group (wherein RXG<br>
represents hydrogen), optionally substituted arylene or<br>
optionally substituted heteroarylene, and may have optionally<br>
substituted aryl, optionally substituted cycloalkyl or<br>
optionally substituted heteroaryl on the end of said chain]; and<br>
Rx2, Rx3/ Rx4 and Rx5 may be the same or different and represent<br>
hydrogen or alkyl}.<br>
Although compound (a) of the prior art has as essential<br>
substituents two oxymethyl groups substituted on the same carbon<br>
atom (namely, -CH2ORX4 and -CH2ORX5) , the compound of the present<br>
invention differs from compound (a) in that it has a -CH2OH<br>
group and a methyl or ethyl group substituted on the same carbon<br>
atom as the corresponding groups thereto.<br>
(2) A compound of the general formula (b) is known as an<br>
immunosuppressant (see, for example, Patent Document 2):<br>
[Chemical Formula 2]<br><br>
[in compound (b) , Ry1, Ry2 and Ry3 represent a hydrogen atom or<br>
the like, W represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group or the<br>
like, Zy represents a single bond or an alkylene group; Xy<br>
-represents a hydrogen atom or an alkoxy group, and Yy represents<br>
a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an alkoxy group, an acyl group,<br>
an acyloxy group, an amino group, an acylamino group or the<br>
like].<br>
Although it is essential that compound (b) has a phenyl<br>
group in its basic backbone, the compound contained in the<br>
pharmaceutical composition of the present invention differs from<br>
compound (b) in that the corresponding group is a heterocyclic<br>
group in the form of a pyrrole group having a substituent on the<br>
nitrogen atom.<br>
Moreover, a compound having a structure that resembles the<br>
structure of the compound contained in the pharmaceutical<br>
composition of the present invention is not disclosed whatsoever<br>
in this publication.<br>
(3) A compound of the general formula (c) is known as an<br>
immunosuppressant (see, for example, Patent Document 3):<br>
[Chemical Formula 3]<br><br>
[in compound (c) , Rz1, Rz2, Rz3 and Rz4 may be the same or<br>
different, and represent a hydrogen atom or an acyl group].<br>
Although compound (c) has two oxymethyl groups (namely, -<br>
CH2ORZ3 and -CH2ORZ4) substituted on the same carbon atom as<br>
essential substituents, the compound of the present invention<br>
differs from compound (c) in that it has a -CH2OH group and a<br>
methyl or ethyl group substituted on the same carbon atom as the<br>
corresponding groups thereto. In addition, although compound<br>
(c) has an essential group in the form of a phenyl group between<br>
the -(CH2)2- group and -CO-(CH2)4- group in the basic backbone<br>
thereof, the compound contained in the pharmaceutical<br>
composition of the present invention differs from compound (c)<br>
in that the corresponding group is a heterocyclic group in the<br>
form of a pyrrole group having a substituent on the nitrogen<br>
atom.<br>
(4) A compound of the general formula (d) is known as an<br>
immunosuppressant (see, for example, Patent Documents 4 and 5):<br>
[Chemical Formula 4]<br><br>
[in compound (d), R1 represents a halogen atom, a trihalomethyl<br>
group, a hydroxyl group, a lower alkyl group having 1 to 7<br>
carbon atoms, a phenoxymethyl group or the like; R2 represents a<br>
hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a trihalomethyl group or the<br>
like; X represents 0, S, SO or S02; and n represents an integer<br>
of 1 to 4].<br>
Although compound (d) has two oxymethyl groups (-CH2OH)<br>
substituted on the same carbon atom as essential substituents,<br>
the compound of the present invention differs from compound (d)<br>
in that it has a -CH20H group and a methyl or ethyl group<br>
substituted on the same carbon atom as the corresponding groups<br>
thereto. In addition, although compound (d) has a substituted<br>
phenyl group in its basic backbone as an essential group, the<br>
compound contained in the pharmaceutical composition differs<br>
from compound (d) in that the corresponding group is a<br>
heterocyclic group in the form of a pyrrole group having a<br>
substituent on the nitrogen atom.<br>
On the other hand, a compound of the general formula (e)<br>
that has immunosuppressive activity is disclosed by the present<br>
applicant in Japanese Patent Application (Kokai) No. 2002-167382<br>
(Patent Document 6):<br>
[Chemical Formula 5]<br><br>
[wherein R1 and R2 represent a hydrogen atom or an amino<br>
protecting group; R3 represents a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl<br>
protecting group,- R4 represents a lower alkyl group; n<br>
represents an integer of 1 to 6; X represents an ethylene group,<br>
Y represents a C1-Clo alkylene group; R5 represents an aryl group<br>
or substituted aryl group; and R6 and R7 represent a hydrogen<br>
atom].<br>
In addition, a compound of the general formula (f) that<br>
has immunosuppressive activity is disclosed by the present<br>
applicant in Japanese Patent Appication (Kokai) No. 2003-267950<br>
(Patent Document 7):<br>
[Chemical Formula S]<br><br>
[wherein R1 and R2 represent a hydrogen atom, an amino protecting<br>
group or the like; R3 represents a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl<br>
protecting group; R4 represents a lower alkyl group; n<br>
represents an integer of 1 to 6; X represents an oxygen atom or<br>
an unsubstituted nitrogen atom or a nitrogen atom substituted<br>
with a lower alkyl group or the like; Y represents an ethylene<br>
group or the like; Z represents an alkylene group having 1 to 10<br>
carbon atoms or the like; R5 represents an aryl group or<br>
substituted aryl group or the like; and Rs and R7 represent a<br>
hydrogen atom or the like].<br>
In view of these circumstances, it is desired to discover<br>
a pharmaceutical composition having low toxicity and superior<br>
immunosuppressive activity.<br>

the art of organic synthesis chemistry, such as Protective<br>
Groups in Organic Synthesis (Third Edition, 1999, John Wiley &amp;<br>

carried out sequentially.<br>
The desired compounds of each step of Process C are<br>
recovered from the reaction mixture in accordance with ordinary<br>
methods. For example, in the case of suitably neutralizing the<br>

added after removing the impurities by filtration, and after<br>
washing with water and so forth, the organic layer containing<br>
the desired compound is separated, and after drying with<br>
anhydrous magnesium sulfate or anhydrous sodium sulfate, the<br>
desired compound is obtained by distilling off the solvent. The<br>
resulting desired compound can be separated and purified as<br>
necessary by suitably combining ordinary methods, such as<br>
recrystallization, reprecipitation or other method commonly used<br>
for separation and purification of organic compounds, examples<br>
of which include absorption column chromatography using a<br>
carrier such as silica gel, alumina or magnesium-silica gel-<br>
based Florisil; a method using a synthetic adsorbent such as<br>
partition column chromatography using a carrier such as Sephadex<br>

Furthermore, when it is necessary to separate isomers,<br>

In the above formulae, R1 and R2 are the same as<br>
previously defined.<br>
Step El:<br>
In Step El, the optical purity of a compound having<br>
general formula (XVI) is increased, and this is carried out by<br>
treating a compound having general formula (XVI) with an<br>

for example, a tablet, capsule, granules, powder or syrup, or<br>
parenterally in the form of an injection or suppository and so<br>
forth, and preferably administered orally in the form of a<br>

mannitol or sorbitol; starch derivatives such as corn starch,<br>
potato starch, a-starch or dextrin; cellulose derivatives such<br>

Although varying depending on symptoms, age and so forth,<br>
the human adult dosage of the active ingredient in the form of<br>
an amino alcohol compound, regardless of whether by oral<br>
administration or intravenous administration, is 0.0001 mg/kg to<br>
1.0 mg/kg, and preferably 0.001 mg/kg/day to 0.1 mg/kg.<br>
In the case of oral administration, although the number of<br>
administrations is normally from one to three times per day to<br>
once per week depending on the case, since the pharmaceutical<br>
composition of the present invention has satisfactory<br>
physicochemical stability, biological absorptivity and<br>
pharmacokinetics (including blood half-life), it has the<br>
advantage of enabling the number of administrations to be lower<br>
than normal, and the number of administrations thereof is from<br>
once per day to once per week, and preferably from once per day<br>
to once in three days.<br>

washed with water and a saturated aqueous NaCl solution dried<br>
over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration, the solvent<br>
was evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue was<br>
purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate,<br>
15:1-10:1) to obtain a crude product (14.9 g) . 10% Palladium-<br>
carbon (5.00 g, 50% moisture) was added to a solution of the<br>
obtained crude product (14.9 g) in ethanol (10 0 mL) and the<br>
mixture was stirred at room temperature under a hydrogen<br>
atmosphere for 2 hours. After the palladium-carbon in the<br>
reaction mixture was Celite-filtered, the filtrate was<br>
evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by<br>
silica gel chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate, 10:1) to obtain<br>
[1-(1,3-dioxolan-2-yl)-3-(4-methoxy-3-methylphenyl)]propane<br>
(12.8 g, yield: 85%) . A 3N aqueous hydrochloric acid solution<br>
was added dropwise to a solution of the obtained [l-(l,3-<br>
dioxolan-2-yl)-3-(4-methoxy-3-methylphenyl)]propane (12.8 g,<br>
54.0 mmol) in THF (200 mL) and the mixture was stirred for 2<br>
hours. Water (400 mL) and ethyl acetate (300 mL) were added to<br>
the reaction mixture to separate it. The thus obtained organic<br>
phase was separated, washed with water and a saturated aqueous<br>
NaCl solution and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After<br>
filtration, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to<br>
obtain 4-(3-methyl-4-methoxyphenyl)butanaldehyde (8.42 g, 81%).<br>
An aqueous solution (50 mL) of sulfamic acid (7.8 g, 0.08 mol)<br>
and an aqueous solution (50 mL) of sodium chlorite (9.2 g, 0.10<br>
mol) were added to a solution of 4-(3-methyl-4-<br>
methoxyphenyDbutanaldehyde (8.42 g, 43.8 mmol) in dioxane (100<br>
mL) under ice-cooling and the mixture was stirred at room<br>
temperature for 1 hour. Ethyl ether (200 mL) was added to the<br>
reaction mixture to separate it. After the pH of the aqueous<br>
phase was brought to 3 to 4 by IN hydrochloric acid, ethyl<br>
acetate was added thereto to separate it. The thus obtained<br>
organic phase was separated, washed with a saturated aqueous<br>
NaCl solution and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After<br>
filtration, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to<br>
obtain 4-(3-methyl-4-methoxyphenyl)butyric acid (5.38 g, yield:<br>
60%) .<br>
(Test Examples)<br>
(Test Example 1)<br>
Measurement of Rat Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte Count<br>
(1) LEW rats (males, age 5 weeks, Japan Charles River) were<br>
used in groups of 5 animals per group.<br>
(2) Administration of Compounds<br>
The compounds were suspended in 1% tragacanth liquid<br>
(solvent). The suspended compounds were orally administered to<br>
the rats using a gastric tube in a dose of 5 mL per kg of body<br>
weight. Furthermore, the solvent was administered instead of<br>
the suspended compounds to a normal control group.<br>
(3) Measurement of Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte Count<br>
Blood samples were collected from the descending vena cava<br>
under ether anesthesia 3 hours after administration of the<br>
solvent or suspended compounds, and then transferred to tubes<br>
containing EDTA.<br>
The absolute lymphocyte counts were measured for the<br>
collected blood samples using a hematology testing device.<br>
Lymphocyte count lowering activity of the test compounds was<br>
calculated as a relative value (%) based on a value of 100% for<br>
the lymphocyte count of the normal control group.<br>
The compounds of the present invention demonstrated<br>
superior activity.<br>
Furthermore, Comparative Compound 1 is a compound<br>
described in Japanese Patent Application (Kokai) No. 2002-167382<br>
(Exemplary Compound No. 1-1344, Example 19), while Comparative<br>
Compound 2 is an optical isomer of a compound described in<br>
Japanese Patent Application (Kokai) No. 2003-267950 (Exemplary<br>
Compound No. 1-1082).<br>
[Chemical Formula 31]<br>
Measurement of ID50 of Rat Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte<br>
Count (mg/kg)<br>
The inhibition rates for each compound dose group at each<br>
dosage were calculated according to the equation below.<br>
Inhibition rate (%) = {l-(lymphocyte count of compound<br>
dose group/lymphocyte count of solvent dose group)} x 100<br>
The dosage of the compound that yielded a value of 5 0% for the<br>
inhibition rate was calculated as the ID5D value.<br><br><br>
(Test Example 2)<br>
Rat Pharmacokinetics (dosage: 1 mg/kg)<br>
(1) LEWIS rats (males, age 6 weeks, Japan Charles River) were<br>
used after acclimating for 1 week. 1 to 3 rats were used for<br>
each compound.<br>
(2) Administration of Compounds<br>
The compounds were dissolved in an aqueous physiological<br>
saline solution containing 4% (w/v) sulfobutyl ether P-<br>
cyclodextrin. The rats were administered the dissolved<br>
compounds directly into the stomach using a metal gastric tube<br>
in a dose of 2 mL per kg of body weight.<br>
(3) Measurement of Blood Compound Concentrations<br>
Blood samples were collected at 0.1 mL/animal/collection<br>
from the jugular vein using heparin as anticoagulant under ether<br>
anesthesia at predetermined times after administering the<br>
compounds. The blood samples were promptly treated with<br>
methanol after collection, and were placed in frozen storage<br>
until the time of measurement treatment. After treating the<br>
resulting blood samples by solid phase extraction, blood<br>
compound concentrations were measured with a high-performance<br>
liquid chromatograph-quadropole mass spectrometer. Various<br>
pharmacokinetic parameters were then calculated using<br>
pharmacokinetics analysis software (Winnonlin Professional) from<br>
the resulting blood concentrations.<br><br><br>
On the basis of these test results, the pharmaceutical<br>
composition of the present invention was determined to<br>
demonstrate satisfactory pharmacokinetics.<br>
