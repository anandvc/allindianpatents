CONTROLLED HEARTBURN AND REFLUX DISEASE TREATMENT Apparatus<br>
The present invention relates to a heartburn and reflux disease treatment apparatus, comprising a restriction device implant able in a patient, who suffers from heartburn and reflux disease, for engaging the stomach close to the cardiac or engaging the esophagus, to form a restricted food passageway in the stomach or esophagus. The term "patient" includes an animal or a hymen being.<br>
Heartburn and reflux disease is a widespread medical problem. This is often due to hiatal hernia, i.e. a portion of the stomach immediately below the gastric fundus slides upwardly through the esophageal hiatus. In consequence, stomach acids and foods are regurgitated into the esophagus.<br>
In the late-1970s a prior art restriction device called Angelchik, according to U.S. Patent No. 3,875,92 8, was used to operatively treat heartburn and reflux disease. However, the Angelchik restriction device had a major disadvantage in that it was not possible to adjust the size of the restriction opening after the operation. A further disadvantage was that the restriction device did not satisfactorily protect the esophagus and the surrounding area against injuries due to poor shape of the restriction device. Therefore, operations using the Angelchik restriction device are no longer practised.<br>
An operation technique, semi-fundoduplicatio, is currently in use for treating heartburn and reflux disease. A most common operation is Nissen semi-fundoduplicatio, in which one takes the fundus of the stomach and makes a three quarter of a turn around the esophagus and suture between the stomach and esophagus. Although this operation works fairly well it has three main disadvantages. Firstly, most patient's treated in accordance to<br><br>
"ad modem Nissen" lose their ability to belch- Secondly, many of these patient's get dysphasia, i.e. difficulties to swallow after the operation. Thirdly, it is not possible to adjust the food passageway in the esophagus or stomach in any way after the operation. Characteristic for these patient's is the variation of their problems over the day. For example, many patient's have difficulties during the night when they lie down because of stomach acid leaking up into the esophagus.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a new convenient heartburn and reflux disease treatment apparatus, the performance of which may be affected by the patient at any time after operation, in particular when various needs arise over the day, so that the patient always is satisfied-<br>
This object is achieved by a heartburn and reflux disease treatment apparatus of the kind stated initially, which is characterised in that the restriction device is operable to change the restriction of the restricted food passageway, a source of energy is provided, and a control device operable from outside the patient's body is provided for controlling the source of energy to release energy for use’s in connection with the operation of the restriction device, when the restriction device is implanted.<br>
As a result, the advantage is achieved that the restriction device can be non-invasively operated, when the restriction device has to be adjusted. Furthermore, the apparatus of the invention provides a simple and effective control of the energy supplied to implanted components of the apparatus, which ensures an extended and reliable functionality of the apparatus, possibly for the rest of the patient's life and at least many years.<br>
The ^control device may also control the restriction device. The control device may comprise an internal control unit.<br><br>
preferably including a microprocessor, implant able in the patient for controlling the restriction device. The control device may further comprise an external control unit outside the patient's body, wherein the internal control unit is programmable by the external control unit", for example for controlling the restriction device over time. Alternatively, the internal control unit may control the restriction device over time in accordance with an activity schedule program, which may be adapted to the patient's needs.<br>
A great advantage is that the patient is enabled to adjust the restriction of the food passageway by using the control device whenever he likes during the day. This advantage should not be underestimated, because in case the patient would need to vomit it would be very difficult for him to do so if he were unable to immediately enlarge the food passageway.<br>
Conveniently, the external control unit may load the internal control unit with data in accordance with a loading mode only authorized for a doctor. For specialized controls of the restriction device, the external control unit may control the internal control unit in accordance with a doctor mode only authorized for the doctor. For simple-controls of the restriction device, the external control unit may control the internal control unit in accordance with a patient mode permitted for the patient. Thus, by using the external control unit in accordance with different modes it is possible to have curtains   of the restriction device controlled by the patient and other more advanced functions controlled by the doctor, which enables a flexible post-operation treatment of the patient.<br>
The control device may be adapted to control the source of energy to release energy, for instance to intermittently release energy in the form of a train of energy pulses, for direct use in connection with the operation of the restriction device. In<br><br>
accordance with a suitable embodiment the control device controls the source of energy to release electric energy, and the apparatus further comprises an implant able capacitor for producing the train of energy pulses from the released energy. In this case the term  direct" is used to mean, on one hand, that the released energy is used while it is being released by the control device, on the other hand, that the released energy may be somewhat delayed, in the order of seconds, by for instance an energy stabilizer before being used in connection with the operation of the restriction device. The restriction device may be operable in non-manual, a non-magnetic or non-mechanical manner by use of the released energy.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the apparatus comprises implantable electrical components including at least one, or only one single voltage level guard and a capacitor or accumulator, wherein the charge and discharge of the capacitor or accumulator is controlled by use of the voltage level guard. As a result, there is no need for any implanted current detector and/or charge level detector for the control of the capacitor, which makes the apparatus simple and reliable.<br>
Generally, the apparatus further comprises an operation device implantable in the patient for operating the restriction device, wherein the control device controls the operation device to operate the restriction device. The control device may directly power the operation device with energy released from the source of energy and/or power other implantable energy consuming components of the apparatus. In this case the term ""directly is used to mean, on one hand, that the operation device is powered with released energy while the latter is being released by the control device, on the other hand, that the released energy may be somewhat delayed, in the order of seconds, by for instance an<br><br>
energy stabilizer before powering the operation device. The advantage of directly using energy as it is released is that the apparatus can be of a very simple design and the few components involved makes the apparatus extremely reliable.<br>
The restriction device may be non-inflatable, i.e. with no hydraulic fluid involved for the adjustments of the restriction device. This eliminates problems with fluid leaking from the restriction device.<br>
The operation device may comprise hydraulic means and at least one valve for controlling a fluid flow in the hydraulic means. The control device may suitably comprise a wireless remote control for controlling the valve. The restriction device may comprise hydraulic means and the operation device may comprise a reservoir forming a fluid chamber with a variable volume connected- to the hydraulic means. The operation device may distribute fluid from the chamber to the hydraulic means by reduction of the volume of the chamber and withdraw fluid from the hydraulic means to the chamber by expansion of the volume of the chamber.<br>
In accordance with a first main aspect of the invention, the source of energy is external to the patient's body and the control device controls the source of energy to release wireless energy. The external source of energy may be of any conceivable kind, such as a nuclear source of energy or a chemical source of energy.<br>
An energy storage device, preferably an electric accumulator, may be implantable in the patient for storing the wireless energy released from the external source of energy. The electric accumulator may comprise at least one capacitor or at least one rechargeable battery, or a combination of at least one capacitor and at least one rechargeable battery. Alternatively, a battery may be implantable  in the patient for supplying<br><br>
electric energy to implanted electric energy consuming components of the apparatus, in addition to the supply of wireless energy. Where the control device comprises an implantable control unit the electronic circuit thereof and the restriction device may be directly powered with transformed wireless energy, or energy from either the implantable energy storage device or batte3ry.<br>
In accordance with a second main aspect of the invention, the wireless energy is directly used for operation of the restriction device, i.e. the restriction device is operated as the wireless energy is released from the external source of energy by the control device. In this case the term "directly" is used to mean, on one hand, that the restriction device is promptly operated by using the released energy without first storing the latter, on the other hand, that the released energy may be somewhat delayed,, in the order of seconds, by for instance an energy stabilizer before being used for the operation of the restriction device. As a result, a very simple control of the restriction device is achieved and there are only a few implanted components of the apparatus. For example, there is no implanted source of energy, such as a battery, nor any implanted complicated signal control system. This gives the advantage that the apparatus will be extremely reliable.<br>
Generally, the control device controls and directly or indirectly powers the operation device with wireless energy released from the source of energy and/or powers other implanted energy consuming components of the apparatus.<br>
In a first particular embodiment in accordance with the first and second main aspects of the invention, the operation device con5)rises a motor, preferably an electric motor which may have electrically conductive parts made of plastics- The motor may include a rotary motor, wherein the control device is adapted<br><br>
to control the rotary motor to rotate a desired number of revolutions. Alternatively, the motor may include a linear motor, or a hydraulic or pneumatic fluid motor, wherein the control device is adapted to control the fluid flow through the fluid motor. Motors, currently available on the market are getting smaller and smaller. Furthermore, there is a great variety of control methods and miniaturized control equipment available. For example, a number of revolutions of a rotary motor may be analyzed by a Hall-element just a few mm in size.<br>
In a second particular embodiment in accordance with the first and second main aspects of the invention, the control device is adapted to shift polarity of the released energy to reverse the operation device. The operation device may suitably comprise an electric motor and the released energy may comprise electric energy.<br>
In -a third particular -embodiment in accordance with the first and second main aspects of the invention, the restriction device is operable to perform a reversible function and there is a reversing device implantable in the patient for reversing the function performed by the restriction device. Such a reversing function preferably involves enlarging and restricting the food passageway by the restriction device, suitably in a stepless manner. In this connection, the control device suitably controls the reversing device, which may include a switch, to reverse the function performed by the restriction device. The reversing device may curries hydraulic means including a valve for shifting the flow direction of a fluid in the hydraulic means. Alternatively, the reversing device may comprise a mechanical reversing device, such as a switch or a gearbox.<br>
Where the reversing device comprises a switch the control device suitably controls the operation of the switch by shifting polarity of released energy supplied to the switch. The switch  <br><br>
may comprise an electric switch and the source of energy may supply electric energy for the operation of the switch. The switch mentioned above may comprise an electronic switch or, where applicable, a mechanical switch.<br>
In accordance with the third particular embodiment, the operation device preferably comprises a motor, wherein the reversing device reverses the motor.<br>
In a fourth particular embodiment in accordance with the first and second main aspects of the invention, the restriction device comprises hydraulic means, for example including an expansible/contractible cavity for fluid. Preferably, the operation device is adapted to conduct hydraulic fluid in the hydraulic means, and comprises a motor, a valveless fluid conduit connected to the hydraulic means of the restriction device, and a reservoir for fluid, wherein the reservoir forms part of the conduit. The operation device suitably comprises a pump operated by the motor. All of the hydraulic components involved are preferably devoid of any non-return valve. This is of great advantage, because with valves involved there is always a risk of malfunction due to improperly working valves, especially when long time periods passes between valve*" operations. The reservoir may form a fluid chamber with a variable volume, and the poor ) may distribute fluid from the chamber to the hydraulic means of the restriction device by reduction of the volume of the chamber and withdraw fluid from the hydraulic means to the chamber by expansion of the volume of the chamber.<br>
In accordance with a third main aspect of the invention, the<br><br>
source of energy is implantable in the patient. Thus, when the source of energy is implanted in a patient the control device controls it from outside the patient's body to release energy. This solution is advantageous for embodiments of the apparatus that have a relatively high consumption of energy which cannot<br><br>
be satisfied by direct supply of wireless energy.<br>
The implantable source of energy may comprise an accumulator, preferably an electric source of energy, such as a battery having a lifetime of at least 10 years.<br>
In accordance with a fourth main aspect of the invention, the apparatus comprises a switch implanted in the patient for directly or indirectly switching the operation of the restriction device and an internal source of energy, such as a battery, implanted in the patient for supplying energy for the operation of the restriction device, wherein the switch directly or indirectly affects the supply of energy from the internal source of energy. This solution is advantageous for embodiments of the apparatus that have a relatively high-energy consumption which cannot be met by direct supply of wireless energy-<br>
In a first particular embodiment in accordance with the fourth main aspect of the invention, the switch switches between an off mode, in which the internal source of energy is not in use, and an on mode, in which the internal source of energy supplies energy for the operation of the restriction device. In this case, the switch is conveniently operated by the wireless energy released from the external source of energy to switch between the on and off modes. The control device, preferably comprising a wireless remote control, may control the external source of energy to release the wireless energy. The advantage of this embodiment is that the lifetime of the implanted source of energy, such as a battery, can be significantly prolonged, since the implanted source of energy does not supply energy when the switch is in its off mode.<br>
In a second particular embodiment in accordance with the fourth main aspect of the invention, the control device comprises a wireless remote control for controlling the internal source of energy. In this case, the switch is operable by the wireless<br><br>
energy from the external source of energy to switch between an off mode, in which the internal source of energy and remote control are not in use, and a standby mode, in which the remote control is permitted to control the internal source of energy to supply energy for the operation of the restriction device.<br>
In a third particular embodiment in accordance with the fourth main aspect of the invention, the apparatus further comprises an energy-transforming device implanted in the patient for transforming the wireless energy into storable energy, wherein the internal source of energy is capable of storing the storable energy. The internal source of energy preferably comprises an electric accumulator, at least one capacitor or at least one rechargeable battery, or a combination of at least one capacitor and at least one rechargeable battery. In this case, the switch switches from an off mode, in which the internal source of energy is not in use, to an on mode, in which the internal source of energy supplies energy for the operation of<br><br>
the restriction device.<br>
The control device, preferably comprising a wireless remote control, may control the switch to switch between the on and off modes,<br>
Alternatively, in this third particular embodiment an energy storage device may be implanted in the patient for storing the storable energy instead of the internal source of energy, wherein the switch is operable by energy from the implanted energy storage device to switch between an off mode, in which the internal source of energy is not in use, and an on mode, in which the internal source of energy supplies energy for the operation of the restriction device. In this case, the control device (the wireless remote control) controls the energy storage device to operate the switch.<br>
The internal source of energy preferably comprises an<br><br>
electric source of energy, such as an accumulator or a battery having a lifetime of at least 10 years. However, other kinds of sources are also conceivable, such as a nuclear source of energy or a chemical source of energy.<br>
The above first, second, third and fourth particular embodiments described in connection with the first and second main aspects of the invention are also applicable in accordance with the third main aspect of the invention, i.e. where the source of energy is implantable, and in accordance with the fourth main aspect of the invention, i.e. where the apparatus comprises an implantable switch.<br>
All of the above embodiments may be combined with at least one implantable sensor for sensing at least one physical parameter of the patient, wherein the control device may control the restriction device in response to signals from the sensor. For example, the sensor may comprise a pressure sensor _ for directly or indirectly sensing the pressure in the food passageway. The expression " indirectly sensing the pressure in the food passageway should be understood to encompass the cases where the sensor senses the pressure against the restriction device or human tissue of the patient-. Where the control device comprises an internal control unit to be implanted in the patient, the internal control unit may suitably directly control the restriction device in response to signals from the sensor. In response to signals from the sensor, for example pressure, the patient's position or any other important physical parameter, the internal control imit may send information thereon to outside the patient's body. The control unit may also automatically control the restriction device in response to signals from the sensor. For example, the control unit may control the restriction device to further restrict the food passageway in the stomach in response to the sensor sensing that the patient is lying, or<br><br>
enlarge the food passageway in response to the sensor sensing an abnormally high pressure against the restriction device.<br>
Jeerer the control device comprises an external control unit outside the patient's body, the external control unit may, suitably directly, control the restriction device in response to signals from the 'sensor. The external control unit may store information on the physical parameter sensed by the sensor and may be manually operated to control the restriction device based on the stored information. In addition, there may be at least one implantable sender for sending information on the physical parameter sensed by the sensor.<br>
An external data communicator may be provided outside the<br>
patient's body and an internal data communicator to be implanted<br>
in the patient may be provided for communicating with the<br>
external data communicator. The internal data communicator may<br>
feed data related to the patient, or related to the restriction<br>
device, back to the external data communicator. Alternatively or<br>
in combination, the external data communicator may feed data to<br>
the internal data communicator. The internal data communicator<br>
may suitably feed data related to at least one physical signal<br>
of the patient.	 <br>
Generally, the apparatus of the invention may comprise a switch implantable in the patient for directly or indirectly switching the energy released from the source of energy. For  , the restriction device may be operable to open and close the food passageway or may steplessly control the cross-sectional area of the food passageway. A pressure sensor may be provided for directly or indirectly sensing the pressure in the food passageway. The control device may control the restriction device in response to signals from the pressure sensor.<br>
The  apparatus  may  comprise  an  implantable  energy transforming device, wherein the control device releases electric<br><br>
energy and the energy transforming device ' transforms the electric energy into kinetic energy for, preferably direct, operation of the restriction device. Suitably, an implantable stabilizer, such as a capacitor. or a rechargeable accumulator, or the like, may be provided for stabilizing the electric energy-released by the control device. In addition, the control device may control the source of energy to release energy for a determined time period or in a determined number of energy pulses. Finally, the restriction device may be non-inflatable.<br>

frequency, amplitude or frequency and amplitude modulated and is digital, analog or digital and analog. Also the control signal used with the carrier signal may be frequency, amplitude or frequency and amplitude modulated.<br>
The control signal may comprise a wave signal, for example, a sound wave signal, such* as an ultrasound wave signal, an electromagnetic wave signal, "such as an infrared light signal, a visible light signal, an ultra violet light signal, a laser signal, a micro wave signal, a radio wave signal, an x-ray radiation signal, or a gamma radiation signal. Where applicable, two or more of the above signals may be combined.<br>
The control signal may be digital or analog, and may comprise an electric or magnetic field. Suitably, the wireless remote control may transmit an electromagnetic carrier wave signal for carrying the digital or analog control signal. For example, use of an analog carrier wave signal carrying a digital-control signal would give safe communication. The control signal may be transmitted in pulses by the wireless remote control.<br>
In all of the above solutions, the control device advantageously releases energy from the source of energy in a non-invasive, magnetic, non-magnetic, mechanical or non-mechanical manner.<br>

FIGURE 16 schematically shows conceivable combinations of implanted components of the apparatus for achieving various communication possibilities. Basically, there are the implanted restriction device 4, the implanted control unit 6 and the external control unit 10 including the "^external source of energy and the wireless remote control. As already described above the remote control transmits a control signal generated by the external source of energy, and the control signal is received by a signal receiver incorporated in the implanted control unit 6, whereby the control unit 6 controls the implanted restriction device 4 in response to the control signal.<br>
A sensor 54 may be implanted in the patient for sensing a physical parameter of the patient; such as the pressure in the food passageway. The control unit 6, or alternatively the external control unit 10, may control the restriction device 4 in response to signals from the sensor 54. A transceiver may be<br><br>
combined with the sensor 54 for sending information on the sensed physical parameter to the external control unit 10. The wireless remote control of the external control unit 10 may comprise a signal transmitter or transceiver and the implanted control unit 6 may comprise a signal receiver or transceiver. Alternatively, the wireless remote control of the external control unit 10 may comprise a signal receiver or transceiver and the implanted control unit 6 may comprise a signal transmitter or transceiver-The above transceivers, transmitters and receivers may be used for sending information or data related to the restriction device from inside the patient's body to the outside thereof.<br>
The motor 44 may be implanted for operating the restriction device 4 and also the battery 32 may be implanted for powering the motor 44. The battery 32 may be equipped with a transceiver for sending information on the charge condition of the battery.<br>
Those skilled in the art will realize that the above various embodiments according to FIGURES 1-15 could be combined in many different ways. For example, the energy operated switch 14 could be incorporated in any of the embodiments of FIGURES 4,6,8-10. The hydraulic shifting device 38 could be incorporated in any of the embodiments of FIGURES 4 and 9, ""The gearbox 52 could be incorporated in any of the embodiments of FIGURES 1,6 and 8.<br>
FIGURE 17 illustrates how any of the above-described embodiments of the heartburn and reflux disease treatment apparatus of the invention may be implanted in a patient. Thus, an assembly of the apparatus implanted in the patient comprises a restriction device 56 engaging the esophagus 58 close to the cardia, and an operation device 60 for operating the restriction device 56 and an intemal control unit 62, which includes a signal receiver, for controlling the operation device 60. An external control unit 64 includes a signal transmitter for transmitting a control signal to the signal receiver of the<br><br>
implanted control unit 62. The implanted control unit 62 is capable of transforming signal energy from the control signal into electric energy for powering the operation device 60 and for energizing , energy consuming implanted components of the apparatus.<br>
FIGURE 18 shows the basic parts of a wireless remote control of the apparatus of the invention including an electric motor 128 for operating a restriction member, for example of the type illustrated in FIGURE 17. In this case, the remote control is based on the transmission of electromagnetic wave signals, often of high frequencies in the order of 100 kHz - 1 kHz, through the skin 13 0 of the patient. In FIGURE 18, all parts placed to the left of the skin 13 0 are located outside the patient's body and all parts placed to the right of the skin 13 0 are implanted . Any suitable remote control system may be used.<br>
An external signal transmitting antenna 132 is to be positioned close to a signal receiving antenna 134 implanted close to the skin 130. As an alternative, the receiving antenna 134 may be placed for example inside the abdomen of the patient. The receiving antenna 134 comprises a coil, approximately 1-100 mm, preferably 25 mm in diameter, wound with a very thin wire and tuned with a capacitor to a specific high frequency. A small coil is chosen if it is to be implanted under the skin of the patient and a large coil is chosen if it is to be implanted in the abdomen of the patient. The transmitting antenna 132 comprises a coil having about the same size as the coil of the receiving antenna 134 but wound with a thick wire that can handle the larger currents that is necessary. The coil of the transmitting antenna 132 is tuned to the same specific high frequency as the coil of the receiving antenna 134,<br>
An external control unit 136 comprises a microprocessor, a high frequency electromagnetic wave signal generator and a power<br><br>
amplifier. The microprocessor of the control unit 13 6 is adapted to switch the generator on/off and to modulate signals generated by the generator to send digital information via the power amplifier and the antennas 132,134 to an implanted control unit 138. To avoid that accidental random high frequency fields trigger control commands, digital signal codes are used. A conventional keypad placed on the external control unit 136 is connected to the microprocessor thereof. The keypad is used to order the microprocessor to send digital signals to either contract or enlarge the restriction device. The microprocessor starts a command by applying a high frequency signal on the antenna 132. After a short time, when the signal has energized the implanted parts of the control system, commands are sent to contract or enlarge the restriction device in predefined steps. The commands are sent as digital packets in the form illustrated below'.<br><br>
Start pattern, 8 bits<br><br>
Command, bits<br><br>
8<br><br>
Coin, 8 bits<br><br>
Checksum,  8 bits<br><br>
The commands are sent continuously during a rather long time period (e.g. about 3 0 seconds or more). When a new contract or enlarge step is desired the Count byte is increased by one to allow the implanted control unit 138 to decode and understand that another step is demanded by the external control unit 136. If any part of the digital packet is erroneous, its content is simply ignored.<br>
Through a line 140, an implanted energizer unit 126 draws energy from the high frequency electromagnetic wave signals received by the receiving antenna 134. The energizer \init 126 stores the energy in a power supply, such as a large capacitor.<br><br>
powers the control unit 138 and powers the electric motor 12 8 via a line 142,<br>
The control unit 13 8 comprises a demodulator and a microprocessor. The demodulator demodulates digital signals sent from the external control unit 13 6. The microprocessor of the control xmit 138 receives the digital packet, decodes it and, provided that the power supply of the energizer unit 12 6 has sufficient energy stored, sends a signal via a signal line 144 to the motor 128 to either contract or enlarge the restriction device depending on the received command code.<br>
Alternatively, the energy stored in the power supply of the energizer unit may only be used for powering a switch, and the energy for powering the motor 128 may be obtained from another implanted power source of relatively high capacity, for example a battery. In this case the switch is adapted to connect said battery to the control unit 13 8 in an on mode when said switch is powered by said power supply and to keep said battery disconnected from the control unit in a standby mode when said switch is empowered.<br>
With reference to FIGURE 19, the remote control schematically described above will now be described in accordance with a more detailed embodiment. The external control unit 136 comprises a microprocessor 146, a signal generator 14 8 and a power amplifier 150 connected thereto. The microprocessor 146 is adapted to switch the signal generator 148 on/off and to modulate signals generated by the signal generator 148 with digital commands that are sent to relented components of the apparatus. The power amplifier 150 amplifies the signals and sends them to the external signal transmitting antenna 132. The antenna 132 is connected in parallel with a capacitor 152 to form a resonant^ circuit tuned to the frequency generated by the signal generator 148.<br><br>
The implanted signal receiving antenna coil 134 forms together with a capacitor 154 a resonant circuit that is tuned to the same frequency as the transmitting antenna 132. The signal receiving antenna coil 13 4 induces a current from the received high frequency electromagnetic waves and a rectifying diode 160 rectifies the induced current, which charges a storage capacitor 158. A coil 156 connected between the antenna coil 134 and the diode 160 prevents .the capacitor 158 and the diode 160 from loading the circuit of the signal receiving antenna 134 at higher frequencies. Thus, the coil 156 makes it possible to charge the capacitor 158 and to transmit digital information using amplitude modulation.<br>
A capacitor 162 and a resistor 164 connected in parallel and a diode 16 6 forms a detector used to detect amplitude modulated digital information, A filter circuit is formed by a resistor 168 connected in series with a resistor 170 connected in series with a capacitor 172 connected in series with the resistor 168 via ground, and a capacitor 174, one terminal of which is connected between the resistors 168,170 and the other terminal of which is connected between the diode 166 and the circuit formed by the capacitor 162 and resistor 164. The 'tilter circuit is used to filter out undesired low and high frequencies. The detected and filtered signals are fed to an implanted microprocessor 176 that decodes the digital information and controls the motor 12 8 via an H-bridge 178 comprising transistors 180,182,184 and 186. The motor 128 can be driven in two opposite directions by the H-bridge 178.        .<br>
The microprocessor 176 also monitors the amount of stored energy in the storage capacitor 158. Before sending signals to activate the motor 128, the microprocessor 176 checks whether the energy stored in the storage capacitor 158 is enough. If the stored energy is not enough to perform the requested operation,<br><br>
