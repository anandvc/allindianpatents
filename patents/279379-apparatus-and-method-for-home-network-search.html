				<td>BACKGROUND<br>
	1	Field<br>
5		The present disclosure is directed to a method and apparatus for a home network<br>
	search. More particularly, the present disclosure is directed to performing a home public<br>
	land mobile network search while in a visiting public land mobile network that is using a<br>
	different mobile country code from the home public land mobile network.<br>
2.		Description of Related Art<br>
10		Presently, a mobile communication device cannot to move to its home public land<br>
	mobile network (HPLMN) during a periodic public land mobile network (PLMN) search<br>
	when the mobile is registered on a visiting public land mobile network (VPLMN) using a<br>
	different mobile country code (MCC) from its HPLMN. For example, the mobile<br>
	communication device is effectively outside of its home country. This limitation creates<br>
15	problems when the mobile communication device is in a country which shares multiple<br>
	country codes. For example Hong Kong became part of China and some of the existing<br>
	operators continue to use different country codes. Also, many countries have multiple<br>
	MCC's allocated for use by different operators and therefore, the use of a single MCC to<br>
	identity a country is not always possible. For example most countries in Europe have two<br>
20	MCC's allocated to the geographical region.<br>
		Unfortunately, a user of a mobile communication device, under such conditions,<br>
	potentially ends up paying more due to being registered, or "roaming," on a VPLMN even<br>
	though the user may be in the vicinity of the HPLMN. An operator of an HPLMN can<br>
	also potentially loose out on revenue because its subscribers will be roaming all of the<br>
25	time after loosing coverage of the HPLMN as long as the "VPLMN coverage exists.<br>
		For example, a mobile communication device can lose coverage of the HPLMN<br>
	and moves to a different VPLMN with a different country code in the same country.<br>
	After a while the mobile communication device may come back to coverage of an overlap<br>
	area of the HPLMN and the VPLMN. Unfortunately, because the VPLMN has a different<br>
30	country code from the HPLMN, the mobile communication device is forbidden from<br>
	camping and registering on its HPLMN, even if it was originally registered on its<br>
	HPLMN in the current vicinity.<br>
2.<br>
 <br>
		Thus, there is a need for performing a HPLMN search while in a VPLMN<br>
	network that is using a different mobile country code from the HPLMN but is in a<br>
	concurrent region with the HPLMN.<br>
5					SUMMARY<br>
		A method in a mobile communication device having a home public land mobile<br>
	network, the home public land mobile network having a first country code. An alternate<br>
	country code for the home public land mobile network is stored. The mobile<br>
	communication device operates on a visiting public land mobile network having a second<br>
10	country code. A public land mobile network search is performed. The mobile<br>
	communication device switches to the home public land mobile network based on the<br>
	public land mobile network search.<br>

25				DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
		Fig. 1 is an exemplary block diagram of a system 100 according to one<br>
	embodiment. The system 100 can include a network controller 140, a home network 110,<br>
	visiting networks 112 and 114, and a terminal 120. The terminal 120 may be a mobile<br>
	communication device, such, as wireless telephone, a cellular telephone, a personal digital<br>
30	assistant a pager, a personal computer, a selective call receiver or any other device that is<br>
	capable of sending and receiving communication signals on a network including wireless<br>
	network.<br>
2A<br>
 <br>
5<br>
		In an exemplary embodiment, the network controller 140 can be connected to the<br>
	home network 110. The network controller 140 may be located at a base, station, at a<br>
	radio network controller, or anywhere else on the network 110. The network controller<br>
	140 may also or alternately be connected to the visiting networks 112 and 114. The<br>
5	networks 110, 112, and 114 may include any type of network that is capable of sending<br>
	and receiving signals, such as wireless signals. For example, the network 110 may<br>
	include a wireless telecommunications network, a cellular telephone network, a satellite<br>
	communications network, and other like communications systems. Furthermore, the<br>
	network 110 may include more than one network and may include a plurality of different<br>
10	types of networks. Thus, the networks 110, 112, and 114 may include a plurality of data<br>
	networks, a plurality of telecommunications networks, a combination of data and<br>
	telecommunications networks and other like communication systems capable of sending<br>
	and receiving communication signals. The home network 110. can be a home public land<br>
	mobile network (HPLMN) with a mobile country code (MCC) of CC0. The visiting<br>
15	network 112 can be a visiting public land mobile network (VPLMN) with a MCC of<br>
	CC1, The visiting network 114 can be a VPLMN with a MCC of CC2. The HPLMN<br>
	110 can have at least one first country code of a plurality of country codes, the at least one<br>
	fast country code being the home country code. Also. the VPLMN 112 can have at least<br>
	one second, country code of a plurality of country codes, the at least one second country<br>
20	code being a visiting country code. For example, the VPLMN 112 can be a PLMN,<br>
	different from the HPLMN 110, where the MCC part of the PLMN identity is the same as<br>
	MCC of the international mobile subscriber identity or the MCC part of the PLMN<br>
	identity and MCC of the HPLMN are alternate country codes.<br>
		In operation, the HPLMN 110 can be the home network of the terminal 120. The<br>
25	terminal 120 can store an alternate country code for the HPLMN 110 as a second country<br>
	code. The alternate country code can be different from any MCC's assigned to the<br>
	HPLMN, The alternate country code for the HPLMN 110 can be stored in a public land<br>
	mobile network list on a subscriber identity module (SIM) in the terminal 120. The<br>
	terminal 120 can operate on the HPLMN. The terminal 120 may lose coverage of die<br>
30	HPLMN 110 and detect coverage of the VPLMN 112. The terminal 120 can then operate<br>
	on the VPLMN 112 having the second country code. While operating on the VPLMN<br>
	112. the terminal 120 can perform a public land mobile network search and switch to the<br>
3<br>
 <br>
	HPLMN 110 based on the public land mobile network search. The terminal can also<br>
	receive an over the air refresh message for modifying stored country codes and modify<br>
	country codes stored in the terminal 120 based on the over the air refresh message.<br>
		Thus, for example, an entry in a SIM card can be used by the terminal 120 when<br>
5	making decisions on whether or not to perform a switch to the HPLMN 110. This entry<br>
	can be pre-programmed by a network operator at the time of subscription or can be<br>
	dynamically changed using the "Over The Air" programming.<br>
		An exemplary entry can look like the following where:<br>
		•	M = 8 : Maximum number of alternate country codes for one home<br>
10	country,<br>
		•	K 
		•	HCC is the home country code, and<br>
		•	If K&gt; M, then K+l th to M entries can be invalid:<br>
15<br>
20<br>
25<br>
		From the table for the HPLMN, which bears the country code as HCC, the country<br>
	codes HCC through HCCK can be treated as "alternate country codes" and the terminal<br>
	120 can be allowed to switch back to the HPLMN if it is on a PLMN bearing the country<br>
	code belonging to any of HCCI through HCCK. Similarly, the terminal 120 can be<br>
30	allowed to switch to a higher preferred PLMM bearing the country code belonging to any<br>
	of HCCI through HCCK, If it is currently on a PLMN bearing the country codes<br>
	belonging to any of HCCI through HCCK.<br>
		To accommodate the case of a user card where the terminal 120 can have multiple<br>
	HPLMN codes, this structure can be expanded where:<br>
35		•	N : Maximum number of HPLMN identities,<br>
		•	M(=8) : Maximum number of alternate country codes, and<br>
4<br>
 <br>
		•	iK : the identity for the ith HPLMN ID, where ik 
			 <br>
5		Thus, the terminal 120 can come back to the HPLMN 110 from the VPLMN 112.<br>
	For example, the terminal 120 may coverage and camp on a VPLMN with a different<br>
	country code as Home country code. The terminal 120 may come back to an overlap<br>
	tovevage area of the HPLMN 110 and the VPLMN 112. The terminal 120 can then come<br>
	back to the HPLMN 110 from the VPLMN 112.<br>
10		Without this disclosure, the terminal 120 is not be able to come back to HPLMN<br>
	as long as it is in overlap area of the VPLMN 112 and the HPLMN 110. The disclosure<br>
	allows for a SIM element "Alternate home country codes' file that indicates a visited<br>
	country code and a home country code are equivalent. The terminal 120 can then come<br>
	back to tine home network.<br>
10							5<br>
 <br>
	Fig. 2 is an exemplary block diagram of a mobile communication device 200,<br>
	such as the terminal 120, according to one embodiment. The mobile communication<br>
	device 200 can include a housing 210, a controller 220 coupled to the housing 210, audio<br>
	input and output circuitry 230 coupled to the housing 210, a display 240 coupled to the<br>
5	housing 210, a transceiver 250 coupled to the housing 210, a user interface 260 coupled<br>
	to the housing 2l0, a memory 270 coupled to the housing 210, and an antenna 280<br>
	coupled to the housing 210 and the transceiver 250. The mobile communication device<br>
	200 can also include a PLMN search module 290 and a PLMN switch module 292. The<br>
	PLMN search module 290 and the PLMN switch module 292 can be coupled to the<br>
10	controller 220, can reside within the controller 220, can reside within the memory 270,<br>
	can be autonomous modules, can be software, can be hardware, or can be in any other<br>
	format useful for a module, on a mobile communication device 200.<br>
		The display 240 can be a liquid crystal display (LCD), a light emitting diode<br>
	(LED) display, a plasma display, or any other means for displaying information.<br>
15	According to one embodiment, the display 240 can, but does not need to indicate when<br>
	the mobile communication device is roaming on a VPLMN other than the HPLMN. The<br>
	transceiver 250 may include a transmitter and/or a receiver. The audio input and output<br>
	circuitry 230 can include a microphone, a speaker, a transducer, or any other audio input<br>
	and output circuitry. The user interface 260 can include a keypad, buttons, a touch pad, a<br>
20	joystick, an additional display, or any other device useful for providing an interface<br>
	between a user and an electronic device. The memory 270 may include a random access<br>
	memory, a read only memory, an optical memory t a subscriber identity module memory,<br>
	or any other memory that can be coupled to a mobile communication device. The<br>
	memory 270 can include mobile country code storage 272. The mobile country code<br>
25	storage 272 can include an alternate country code 272 for the home public land mobile<br>
	network 110. The mobile country code storage 272 can be located on a subscriber<br>
	identity module memory. Furthermore the mobile country code storage can include<br>
	multiple country codes for the HPLMN 110 including at least one alternate country code<br>
	for the HPLMN 110. Thus, the HPLMN can have at least one MCC, such as a home<br>
30	MCC and the VPLMN can have at least one MCC.<br>
		The alternate country code can be the same code as a VPLMN country code. For<br>
	example, the alternate country code for the HPLMN 110 can be CCI. Thus, when the<br>
6<br>
 <br>
	mobile communication, device 200 is operating on the VPLMN 112 with a MCC=CCl,<br>
	the mobile communication device 200 can know that it may be possible to operate on the<br>
	HPLMN 110 because the alternate county code for the HPLMN 110 is the same as the<br>
	MCC for the VPLMN 112.<br>
5		In operation, the controller 220 can operate the mobile communication device 200<br>
	on a VPLMN 112 having a second country code CC1. The PLMN search module 290<br>
	can perform a public land, mobile network search. The public land mobile netvrak search<br>
	can be a higher priority public land mobile network search that searches for a higher<br>
	priority PLMN than the current PLMN. The PLMN switch module 292 can switch the<br>
10	mobile communication device 200 to the HPLMN 110 based on the public land mobile<br>
	network search. The PLMN search module 290 can detect the HPLMN 110 and the<br>
	PLMN switch module 292 can switch to the HPLMN 110 based on the PLMN search<br>
	module 290 detecting the HPLMN 110. The transceiver 350 can receive an over the air<br>
	refresh message for modifying country codes stored in the memory 270 and the controller<br>
15	220 can modify the stored country codes based on the over the air refresh message.<br>
		Fig. 3 is an exemplary flowchart 300 illustrating the operation of the mobile<br>
	communication device 200 according to one embodiment. In step 310, the flowchart<br>
	begins. In step 320, the mobile communication device 200 can store an alternate country<br>
	code tor the HPLMN 110, The mobile communication device 200 can store the alternate<br>
20	country code for the HPLMN 110 in a public land mobile network list on a subscriber<br>
	identity module. Also, the mobile communication device 200 can store multiple country<br>
	codes for the HPLMN 110 and the multiple country codes can include the alternate<br>
	country code for the HPLMN 110. The mobile communication device 200 can receive an<br>
	over the ait refresh message for modifying stored country codes and modify the stored<br>
25	country codes based on the over the air refresh message.<br>
		In step 330, the mobile communication device 200 can operate on the VPLMN<br>
	112 having,a second country code. The alternate country code can be the same code as<br>
	the second country code, in step 340 the mobile communication device 200 can perform<br>
	a public land mobile network search. The public land mobile network search, can be a<br>
30	higher priority public land mobile network search. In step 350, the mobile<br>
	communication device 200 can switch to the HPLMN 110 based on the public land<br>
	mobile network search. The mobile communication device 200 can detect the HPLMN<br>
7<br>
 <br>
15<br>
	110 while performing the public land mobile network search, in step 340 and can then<br>
	switch to the home public land mobile network in step 350 based on detecting the<br>
	HPLMN 110. In step 360, the flowchart 300 ends.<br>
		Fig. 4 is an exemplary flowchart 400 illutstrating the operation of the mobile<br>
5	communication device 200 according to another embodiment. This flowchart 400<br>
	illustrates an example of the operation of a PLMN higher priority search in determining<br>
	whether to switch to a detected PLMN while operating on a VPLMK 112.<br>
		In step 410, the flowchart begins. In step 420, the mobile communication device<br>
	200 can detect a PLMN other than the VPLMN 112 on which it is operating In step 430,<br>
10	the mobile communication device 200 can determine if the MCC of the VPLMN 112 is in<br>
	the range of 310-316. This step can be used because current standards assign, the United<br>
	States to a range of MCC's from 310-316 and have special rules for these MCC's.<br>
	However this step may not be necessary if the standards change. If the answer tn step 430<br>
	is yes, in step 440, the mobile communication device 200 determines if the detected<br>
15	PLMN MCC is in the range of 310-316. If so, to step 450, the mobile communication<br>
	device 200 moves to the detected PLMN. If not, in step 460, the mobile communication<br>
	device 200 stays on the current VPLMN 112.<br>
		If the answer to step 430 is no, in step 470, the mobile communication device 200<br>
	can determine if the current VPLMN MCC is the same as the detected PLMN MCC. If<br>
20	so, in step 450, the mobile communication device 200 can move to the detected VPLMN.<br>
	If not in step 480, the mobile communication device 200 can determine if the current<br>
	VPLMN MCC is an alternate country code for the HPLMN 110. If not, in step 460, the<br>
	mobile communication device 200 stays on the current VPLMN 112. If so, in step 490,<br>
	the mobile communication device 200 can determine if the detected VPLMN MCC is an<br>
25	alternate country code for the HPLMN 110. If not, in step 460, the mobile<br>
	communication device 200 stays on the current VPLMN 112. If so, in step 495, the<br>
	mobile communication device 200 can move to the detected VPLMN.<br>
