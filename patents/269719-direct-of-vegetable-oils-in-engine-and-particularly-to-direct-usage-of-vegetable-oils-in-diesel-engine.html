				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The instant invention relates to direct use of vegetable oils in engine and particularly to direct usage of vegetable oils in diesel engines  Background of the Invention<br>
1 Diesel engines are the most efficient prime movers commonly available. The diesel engines do all this in a package that is robust and durable, with lower spcific fuel consumption compared to any other prime mover. But diesel engines are one of the largest contributors to environmental pollution problems worldwide. Diesel emissions contribute to the development of cancer; cardiovascular and respiratory health effects; pollution of air, water, and soil, reductions in visibility; and global climate change.<br>
From the point of view of protecting the global environment and concerns for long-term energy security, it becomes necessary to develop alternative fuels with -properties comparable to conventional fuels.   Thus, we are in need of finds, which arc environment friendly, economic and easily available primarily from bio-origin.  Successful alternative fuel should fulfill environmental and energy security needs without sacrificing engine operating performance. Vegetable oil based fuels are biodegradable, non-toxic, and significantly reduce pollution    Plenty   of experimental  work  has  been  carried  out  in   various countries   for utilization  of vegetable oils  in compression ignition  engines. Vegetable   oils   and   their  derivatives   in   diesel   engines   lead   to   substantial reductions in sulfur, carbon mono-oxide (CO), poly aromatic hydrocarbons (PART) Smokc, noise, and paniculate emissions. Furthermore, contribution of bio fuels  to greenhouse effect is insignificant,  since carbon dioxide  (CO,) emitted during combustion is recycled in the photosynthesis process in the plants.<br>
Vegetable oils for fuel usage have following advantages.<br>
(i) Vegetable oils are local available resources in rural areas, (li) Development of. biodiesel industry would strengthen rural agricultural economy. (111) These are biodegradable and non-toxic fuels, (iv) These fuels have engine compatible fuel characteristics indicating a possibility of these being used as a diesel substitute with no/ very little engine hardware modifications, (iv) Low sulfur content in these fuels hence more environment friendly, (vi) Enhanced lubricity properties, (vii) Lower safety issues involved because of higher flash point temperature compared to mineral diesel fuel, (vii) Vegetable oils have a reasonable cetane number and hence possess lesser knocking tendency, (ix) Low aromatics content, (x) Vegetable oils help to reduce costly petroleum imports by import substitution.<br>
Vegetable oils in diesel engines lead to substantial reductions in sulfur, carbon mono xide (CO:, poly aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), smoke, noise, and paniculate emissions. I lowcver, formation of derivatives (Such as biodiesel) From the vegetable oil leads to increase in the price of the end product or the derivative. Vegetable oil can also be used as fuel in engines without being converted in to bsodiesel, which will be economically significant for rural areas. Vegetable oils have about 90 percent heating value as that of diesel due to their higher oxygen content. But vegetable oils have higher viscosity in comparison 10 conventionnl diesel or biodiesel. The kinematic viscosity of vegetable oils is several nines higher than that of diesel. Higher viscosity of vegetable oils (35-45c Si at 40°C) as against diesel (4.0 cSt at 40°C leads to problems in pumping and atomization, ring sticking, carbon deposits on the piston, cylinder head and<br>
ring grooves, etc. Also, higher viscosity is responsible for various undesirable combustion features of straight vegetable oils.<br>
There are many approaches for using vegetable oils, which have been tried conventionally like preheating the vegetable oil, mixing the vegetable oil with diesel, blending of organic solvent additive with vegetable oil etcetera. Using straight, untreated vegetable oil chokes the engine as it is highly viscous and also leads to fast wear and tear of the engine components.<br>
Conventionally, engines have been designed to preheat the Vegetable Oil in order to reduce the viscosity of the vegetable oil e.g. one conventional system uses metallic fuel pipe line wrapped around the exhaust system of a genset to reduce oil viscosity. Since a generator engine runs at a constant speed and load using a steady fuel flow, heat transferred to vegetable oil is regulated by the number of turns around the exhaust pipe.<br>
Systems have also been proposed using a valve to allow a regulated exhaust gas flow away from the existing exhaust system and into other piping where the hot gases are used to heat the vegetable oil. The valve opening is regulated to give the required amount of heating. Pre-heating of the Engine is done by electricity, or diesel / petrol fired engine pre-heaters, which are switched on for approximately half an hour before starting the engine. The said engines heat the engine, coolant and pump it around the system providing heat for the engine cabin heater and to the heat exchanger fitted. Thus before starting the engine, the fuel (Vegetable oil) gets heated. This system has a drawback since it overheats the vegetable oil at high engine loads, thus pyrohsmg the vegetable oil and increasing the chances of engine wear and tear and also breakdown. It also results in wastage of fuel.<br>
In order to obviate the said disadvantages of prior art, new engine designs are required so that straight vegetable oil can be used directly.<br>
Detailed Description of Drawings<br>
Figure 3.9 shows the schematic setup of an embodiment of the instant invention. The main components of the said schematic diagram include two fuel tanks, fuel-conditioning system, heat exchanger (105), exhaust gas line, bypass line, and performance and emissions measurement systems. The two fuel tanks include Vegetable Oil Tank (101) and Diesel Tank (111).<br>
Two fuel filters (102, 103) are provided at the exit of vegetable oil tank and one hi tor (113) before fuel pump (114). The fuel conditioning system is essential because vegetable oil is highly viscous and contains impurities including dust panicles etc. If vegetable oil of poor quality is supplied to the engine then it may generate higher particulate matter leading to increased engine wear, apart from chocking of fuel lines, fuel pumps etc.   Therefore, the filters (102, 103) filter out the vegetable oil adequately before it is supplied to the engine. Merc the number of filters can be increased or decreased as per the requirement of the system. These filters can be changed easily, once they get clogged. One of the two fuel filters (102, 103) facilitate by continuous supply of vegetable oil to engine even if one of the filters get clogged. When one of the filters (102, 103) gets clogged, the supply of filtered vegetable oil continues by the other filter and in the mean-time, a new one can replace the clogged first filter. The heat exchanger (105) comprise of a heating shell (106) and tube type heat exchanger (107) in order to preheat the vegetable oil using waste heat of the exhaust gases. The inner pipe or tube type heat exchanger (107) consists of fins (108) that increase heat transfer area between vegetable oil and exhaust gases.<br>
Line heat exchanger (105) is connected to the filters (102, 103) by means of a supplr pipe (108) and a valve (111). The supply pipe (108) provides filtered vegetable oil to the heat exchanger (105). The supply of filtered vegetable oil is regulated by the valve (111). The heated filtered vegetable oil from the heat exchanger is supplied to second stage fuel filter (113) by means of another supply pipe (109). A thermocouple (116) is provided in the heat exchanger to measure temperature of the heated vegetable oil. The exhaust gases and vegetable oil flow in opposite directions to transfer heat from the hot exhaust gases to the filtered vegetable oil. The filtered vegetable oil flows over the heated pipe (107) between the fins attached to the pipe and thus gets heated by means of the heated fins. The specific design of these fins increase the surface are a on which the vegetable oil flows.<br>
The heat exchanger uses the following formulas for exchanging heat between<br>
waste exhaust gases and vegetable oil.<br>
I lea! required to heat the oil O, =      Cp-<br>
Mass flow- rate of vegetable oil, kg/s C1 :   Specific heat of vegetable oil, kgj/kg T = Temperature of oil after heating, K I  ,i   =  T'emperature of oil before heating, K    Thermal conductivity of inner tube (mild steel),w /mK<br>

w = Thickness of fin, m<br>
d, = Inner diameter of fin, m<br>

The diameter of inner pipe as used in the instant embodiment is about 48.6<br>
mm (exhaust pipe  line diameter). However, the diameter may be increased or<br>
decreased as per the requirement.<br>

.Mn  load   Continue However   they   may   be   increased   or  decreased   in<br>
accordance to the parameters, which depend on engine load and its make.<br>
'I'he design is checked using the following design parameters:<br>
m = 0.9 kg/hr,	C  = l.H k)/kgK     T,,,. = 353 K	T ,, = 273 K<br>

Hen  required Q =: 36 <br>
I lent Supplied ().. = 36.32 watt<br>
There- waste exhaust gases of the engine are transferred from the engine (115) to the tube t\pe hear exchanger by a pipe or a connecting means (1 l~), which heats the pipe and the fins. 'Thus, the vegetable oil when passes over the heated fins and pipe gets heated. 'I'he heated vegetable oil is passed to another second stage fuel filter (113 by connecting means (109) which is also connected to the Dised tank. 'The heated filtered vegetable oil is then passed to the engine (115)<br>
hieans of a fad pump (114). Here the engine is first started with diesel fuel and is thereafter switched over to vegetable oil. A thermocouple (118) is also provided in the exhaust line to measure the temperature of the exhaust gases. It may be made of galvanized iron pipe to carry out exhaust gases from the engine to the atmosphere. The heat exchanger is placed in the exhaust line so that waste heat can be used for heating the oil.<br>
Meat exchanger (105) heats the oil at minimum loading condition. At low loads, temperature of the exhaust gas is about 130-140°C. But, at higher loads, temperature of the exhaust gas increases up to 400°C Increase in exhaust gas temperature increases the outlet temperature of vegetable oil from the heat exchanger also. Therefore, in order to control the temperature of the vegetable oil within a range of 8()-90°C, a by-pass valve (118) is provided in the exhaust gas line before the heat exchanger. It allows the exhaust gases to escape instead of passing through the heat exchanger. By-pass of exhaust gas prevents the oil temperature to increase beyond specified limit.<br>
1-ig 2 illustrates an engine control panel. The engine control panel mounts all the instruments. A burette is placed on the control panel to measure the fuel consumption of the engine. Voltmeter, ammeter, and temperature indicator are also mounted on the control panel. Voltmeter and ammeter are used to measure the voltage and current: consumed by the load in the load bank. The product of voltage and current gives the load on engine-alternator system. Temperature indicator measures the temperature of the exhaust gas using a thermocouple.<br><br><br><br><br>
