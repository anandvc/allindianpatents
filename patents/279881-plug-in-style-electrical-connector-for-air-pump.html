CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/851,155, filed October 12, 2006. The disclosure of the above application is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a connector and terminal<br>
arrangement.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
M-slots (along with l/H slots) are mechanical connections that are used<br>
in the industry for creating an electrical connection. A typical M-slot has a<br>
female member (e.g., the M-slot terminal) that is configured for receiving a<br>
male terminal, known as a blade terminal. When the blade terminal is<br>
inserted into M-slot the electrical connection is complete. The use of the M-<br>
slot terminal provides a clean and reliable electrical connection for assembling<br>
a circuit, such as a lead frame to a device. M-slots are also ideal because<br>
their small design allows for smaller overall package size.<br>
With regard to secondary air pumps, power is traditionally supplied<br>
through the use of soldering connections between the actuator device and an<br>
electrical source. This increases assembly time and decreases quality. It is<br>
desirable to develop a faster and more efficient connection between a power<br>
source and the actuator device for secondary air pumps.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to a plug-in connector arrangement having a<br>
dual female terminal. The dual female terminal has a first contact portion with<br>
an aperture formed through the first contact portion and a second contact<br>
portion with an aperture formed through the second contact portion. The first<br>
contact portion and second contact portion are connected together. A<br>
connector having a male terminal on one end is disposed through the<br>
 <br>
apertures of the first and second contact portions. The second end of the<br>
connector is configured to be connected to a power source.<br>
Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become<br>
apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be<br>
understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while<br>
indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for<br>
purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The present invention will become more fully understood from the<br>
detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a secondary air pump having the plug in<br>
connector arrangement connected;<br>
Fig. 2 is a cross-sectional perspective view of the secondary air pump<br>
housing with the plug in connector arrangement;<br>
Fig. 3 is an exploded perspective view of the dual female terminals and<br>
the connector;<br>
Fig. 4 is an exploded sectional view of the dual female terminals with a<br>
plastic form; and<br>
Fig. 5 is a perspective side view of a single dual female terminal with<br>
the end of a male terminal positioned prior to engagement.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 1-5 a plug in connector arrangement 10 is<br>
shown. The plug in connector arrangement 10 is incorporated on a<br>
secondary air pump housing 12 having an interior chamber 14 for containing<br>
an actuator 18 for operating the secondary air pump. The secondary air<br>
pump housing 12 has an opening 16 that extends between the interior<br>
chamber 14 and the exterior of the pump housing 12.<br>
 <br>
Also contained within the interior chamber 14 is a plastic form 20 that is<br>
aligned with the opening 16. The plastic form 20 is configured to receive and<br>
hold one or more dual female terminals 22. The embodiment shown in Figs.<br>
2-4 depicts the use of two dual female terminals 22; however, it is within the<br>
scope of this invention for a lesser or greater number of dual female terminals<br>
to be used depending upon the needs of a particular application. For<br>
example, an actuator that requires different signals or an increased current<br>
can use more dual female terminals. The dual female terminals 22 are held in<br>
the plastic form 20 in operable alignment with the opening 16 of the pump<br>
housing 12.<br>
Each dual female terminal 22 has a first contact portion 24 having an<br>
aperture 26 with one or more flanges 28 extending into the aperture 26 for<br>
forming a clip. Each individual dual female terminal 22 also has a second<br>
contact portion 30 having an aperture 32 with one or more flanges 34<br>
extending into the aperture 32 for also forming a clip. The first contact portion<br>
24 and second contact portion 30 are connected together by a bridge 36 that<br>
can either be welded to first and second contact portions 24, 30 or can be<br>
integrally formed with the first and second contact portions 24, 30. The<br>
apertures 26, 32 are aligned for receiving the end 46 of the male terminal 44.<br>
In order to connect the dual female terminals 22 to the actuator 18 a solder<br>
and wire 38 can be connected to the bridge 36 or any of the contact portions<br>
24, 30 at one end and to the actuator 18 at another end.<br>
A connector shown generally at 40 has a body 42 that encases one or<br>
more male terminals 44 having one end 46 connectable with one dual female<br>
terminal 22. A second end 48 of each male terminal 44 is located at an<br>
opposite end of the body 42 and is connectable to a power or signal source.<br>
The male terminals 44 are blade terminals. The male terminals 44 are<br>
connected to the dual female terminals 22 by being positioned through the<br>
opening 16 in the pump housing 12. The opening 16 is shaped to receive the<br>
body 42 of the connector 40 and allow the male terminals 44 to plug into the<br>
dual female terminals 22. The one end 46 of each terminal 44 is disposed<br>
through the first contact portion 24 and second contact portion 30 of a dual<br>
female terminal 22. The flanges 28, 34 form a clip that exerts pressure on the<br>
 <br>
male terminal 44 to hold the terminal in place within the apertures 26, 32. The<br>
body 42 of the connector can be fastened to the pump housing 12 using<br>
fasteners, adhesives or other suitable means. The invention allows for the<br>
quick connection of a power source to an actuator that can be accomplished<br>
with ease during assembly.<br>
The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and,<br>
thus, variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended<br>
to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded<br>
as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
