				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for the production of somatic<br>
seedlings. This invention further relates to a process for the<br>
production of somatic seedlings of sandalwood plants by using<br>
plant cell for tissue culture technology.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is known in the art to produce somatic seedlings in culture<br>
using mainly three different processes. In one process, pro-<br>
embryogenic callus mass is placed on solid medium containing<br>
hormones (H1) for somatic embryo induction. After about 4-6 weeks<br>
somatic embryos are produced asynchronously with embryos at<br>
different stages of development/differentiation. The mature<br>
embryos are then transferred to a different medium having other<br>
hormones (H2) in different culture vessel for germination,<br>
thereby raising somatic seedlings.<br>
The drawbacks of this process are that a majority of somatic<br>
embryos (&gt;90%) are asynchronous and abnormal; often joined with<br>
one another and very low number of normal somatic embryos are<br>
obtained per gram of pro-embryogenic callus.<br>
A second method known in the art for somatic seedling production<br>
is direct somatic embryo production from any plant part, on solid<br>
medium in presence of one hormone (H1). These embryos are then<br>
germinated in a different medium in presence of another hormone<br>
(H2) to produce somatic seedlings. This method suffers from the<br>
drawbacks of poor response of plants to embryogenesis, ie. very<br>
few plants respond to direct embryogenesis, and that a number of<br>
embryos produced is very low whereas time taken is very long.<br>
Yet another process known in the art is that pro-embryogenic<br>
callus mass is cultivated in liquid medium in bioreactor in<br>
presence of hormone (H1) to produce somatic embryos. The produced<br>
embryos" are then germinated in solid medium in presence of<br>
another hormone (H2). Even through the total number of embryos<br>
produced by this process are higher than those produced by the<br>
first two processes greater than 30% are abnormal.<br>
In all of the above three processes, the total time taken from<br>
embryogenic callus mass to somatic seedling production is greater<br>
than six weeks. The residual effect of hormones H1 and H2 on the<br>
subsequent stages are the main reasons for major developmental<br>
abnormalities. The somatic seedlings which are apparently normal<br>
do not survive in the field due to above mentioned abnormalities.<br>
No process has so far been described to take care of the precise<br>
exposure time of H1 and H2 and to prevent carry forward effect of<br>
H1 and H2 to the subsequent stages.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to propose a<br>
novel process for the production of somatic seedlings rapidly by<br>
proper programming of incubation time of the embryos.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to propose a novel<br>
process for the production of somatic seedlings which gives<br>
greater yield of the seedings from pro-embryogenic cell and is<br>
therefore cost-effective.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a novel process<br>
for the production of somatic seedlings which is completed<br>
aseptically in one bioreactor without any sub-culture.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus according to this invention is provided a process for the<br>
production of somatic seedlings of plants comprising innoculating<br>
a plant pro-embryogenic cell/callus mass in a nutrient medium<br>
containing H1 hormones in a bioreactor,<br>
draining out the spent medium,<br>
adding fresh nutrient medium into the bioreactor followed by<br>
cultivation of the embryos therein,<br>
adding H2 hormones into the medium and allowing the somatic<br>
embryos to germinate to somatic seedlings,<br>
draining out the H2 hormone containing medium and adding fresh<br>
nutrient medium containing an inhibitor into the bioreactor,<br>
allowing the seedlings to develop in the medium to obtain the<br>
somatic seedlings.<br>
In accordance with this invention, an agitated bioreactor is<br>
innoculated using plant pro-embryogenic cell/callus mass in a<br>
first liquid medium containing H1 hormone(s) favouring somatic<br>
embryo induction and maturation upto cotyledonary stage. The<br>
agitation in bioreactor is provided in such a manner so that the<br>
developing embryos move characteristically with their shoot and<br>
root apices oriented acropetally and basipetally respectively,<br>
for most of the time and thereby favour normalcy in development.<br>
The nutrient medium is charged by aseptically pumping out the<br>
spent medium and pouring in fresh nutrient medium without any<br>
hormone. The somatic embryos are cultivated in this hormone free<br>
(H zero) condition for 2-5 days depending on the plant species.<br>
This step prevent residual effect of H1, which interfere with<br>
next step hormone for germination. The yield of normal embryos<br>
increase significantly because of this step.<br>
The hormone(s) required for germination (H2) of somatic embryos<br>
are added to the bioreactor, after filter sterilization. The<br>
somatic embryos germinate to somatic seedlings. Thereafter, the<br>
H2 containing medium is pumped out from bioreactor and fresh<br>
medium with an inhibitor (I) for H2 is added to the bioreactor.<br>
The germinated somatic seedlings are kept in this inhibitor<br>
containing medium which eliminate the residual effect of H2 and<br>
favour proper development of somatic seedlings. Such seedlings<br>
exhibit much higher survival during green house hardening.<br>
The nutrient medium is a liquid medium used for embryogenesis<br>
such as the MS plant tissue culture medium proposed by Murashige<br>
and Skoog (1962), according to Gamborg et al (1968), McCown plant<br>
tissue culture medium proposed by Lloyd &amp; McCown (1981) or CCC,<br>
ie. chlorocholine chloride.<br>
The hormones used for the culture are H1 and H2 where H1 is used<br>
for somatic embryo induction and maturation and is selected from<br>
auxius cytokenins etc.. The hormone H1 is added to the medium in<br>
a proportion of (3.2-2.5 ppm.<br>
The hormone H2 induces germination of the somatic embryos and is<br>
selected from gibberellins or gibberellin - cytokinin mixture. H2<br>
is used in a proportion of 0.2 to 1.5 ppm. The The inhibitor is used<br>
to minimise the residual effect of H2 and is selected from<br>
abscisic acid, ancymidol or chlorocholine chloride singly or in<br>
combination. The inhibitor is used in a proportion of 0.2 to 1.0<br>
ppm or 1.0 mg per litre of medium.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWIN6S<br>
The invention will be apparent from the description with read in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawing where Fig.l depicts a<br>
schematic flow diagram of the process for somatic seedling<br>
production according to the invention. Step 1 shows innoculation<br>
of the bioreactor with the pro-embryogenic friable cell/callus<br>
mass as innoculum.<br>
In step 2, the first medium is replaced with a second medium<br>
without any hormone, followed by cultivation in the hormone free<br><h zero condition. in step the hormone h2 required for germi-></h>
nation is added to the nutrient medium and in step 4, the hormone<br>
containing nutrient medium is replaced with fresh medium<br>
containing an inhibitor. The seedlings are kept in this condition<br>
to obtain the somatic seedlings.<br>
The invention will now be explained in greater detail with the<br>
help of the following non-limiting example.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Nutrient Medium : MS (according to Murashige &amp; Skoog, 1962)<br>
Hormones : H1 - indole acetic acid 2.5 mg/litre<br>
H2 - gibberellic acid 1.5 mg/litre<br>
Innoculum biomass : 100 gms fresh weight per litre medium<br>
Bioreactor capacity : 2 litres, with various probes, pneuma-<br>
tically agitated<br>
Incubation step : Step 1: 14 days; Step 2s 2 days; Step 3s<br>
10 days; Step 4: 2 days<br>
Temperature : 25oC<br>
Light s 1000 lux<br>
The unique features of the foregoing process are that induction,<br>
maturation and germination of somatic embryos take place in<br>
liquid medium with programming of hormone exposure in the<br>
sequence H1-Hzero-H2-I . Agitation is provided in a specific<br>
manner facilitating acropetal and basipetal orientation of the<br>
somatic embryo shoot and root initial apices respectively, for<br>
most of the time. All the 4 steps (STEP1 to STEP 4) are completed<br>
aseptically in one bioreactor without any sub—culture and there<br>
is a significant reduction in incubation time from nearly eight<br>
weeks to about five weeks.<br>
