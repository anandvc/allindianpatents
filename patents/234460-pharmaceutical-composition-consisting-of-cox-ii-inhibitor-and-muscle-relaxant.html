Cox-II inhibitor and muscle relaxant"<br>
2. APPLICANT<br>
(a) NAME: LYKA LABS LIMITED<br>
(b)NATIONALITY: Indian Company incorporated under the Indian Companies ACT, 1956<br>
(c) ADDRESS: 7?, Nehru Road, Vile Parle(East), Mumbai - 400 099,<br>

3.PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Technical field:<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a COX-II inhibitor and a muscle relaxant in combination which is useful in the treatment of management of pain and pain related disorders and symptoms. Particularly the present invention relates to pharmaceutical composition comprising etoricoxib and tizanidine in combination in oral solid dosage form. Further the present invention relates to a process for manufacture of the same.<br>
Background and prior art:<br>
Pain and inflammation are conditions wherein quick relief is most desirable. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) are the main drugs used for treatment of painful inflammatory joint conditions such as osteo arthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis, peri-arthritis, tennis elbow, frozen shoulder, etc. These conditions are characterized by pain, stiffness, restricted mobility of the affected joints etc.<br>
COX II inhibitors are a relatively new family of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Though not necessarily more effective at reducing inflammation and pain than older, traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, they are believed to cause less stomach irritation as compared to the older drugs. However, they are still classified as NSAIDS. NSAIDS are responsible for the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects due to specific Cox- 2 inhibition.<br>
Etoricoxib is chemically known as 5-chloro-6'-methyl-3-[4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-2,3'-bipyridine. The structural formula is given below.<br>
2<br><br><br>
Etoricoxib, a novel, highly selective cox-2 inhibitor has been recently approved for the treatment of osteo arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and pain and the signs of inflammation associated with acute gouty arthritis.<br>
Tizanidine is used in multiple sclerosis to treat the increased muscle tone associated with spasticity. Even though, it does not provide a cure for the problem, it is designed to relieve the spasms, cramping and tightness of the muscle. Tizanidine is chemically known as 5-chloro-4-(2-imidazolin-2-ylamino)-2, 1,3-benzothiodiazole.<br>
US4515802 describes a process for the production of analgesic preparation comprising paracetamol and tizanidine in the form of tablets and suppositories.<br>
Transdermal systemic administration of pharmaceutical preparation comprising tizanidine is disclosed in EPO155229.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising tizanidine used for sublingual and buccal administration disclosed in US2004122065.<br>
WO2004058163 discloses pharmaceutical compositions comprising Cox-II inhibitor, with or without concomitant use of one or more anti Parkinson drugs for treating and methods of treating Parkinson's disease.<br>
Pharmaceutical composition and dosage form containing in combination a COX-II and a muscle relaxant is useful for the treatment of pain and pain related disorders and symptoms.  EP1362585 discloses pharmaceutical compositions<br>
3<br><br>
containing Cox-II inhibitor selected from rofecoxib and celecoxib and a muscle relaxant such as prindinol.<br>
Etoricoxib is a potent Cox-II inhibitor and is commercially available in the market as oral dosage forms for the management of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and acute gouty arthritis. Tizanidine hydrochloride is available in the market as oral dosage form for the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders.<br>
The present invention describes a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a combination of etoricoxib, a potential Cox-II inhibitor and tizanidine, a centrally acting muscle relaxant as an oral solid dosage form. This effective combination of a Cox-II and a muscle relaxant is to combat pain as well as to relax the muscle spasm.<br>
