Background of Invention:<br>
This invention relates to preparation of new Bisazo pigments from Homophthalimides.<br>
Bisazo pigments were prepared by tetrazotisation of different aromatic amines and<br>
coupling with Homophthalimide derivatives.<br><br>
Use of Homophthalimide as a coupling component is described in the Germen<br>
li Patent No.2,215,497. In this azo pigments for printing inks were prepared by diazotizing<br>
different aromatic amines and coupling with Homophthalimide and several lake pigments<br>
were    also    prepared.    Present    invention    encompasses    bisazo    pigments    from<br>
Homophthalimide having good fastness properties.<br>
Germen Patent Ger. Offen. 2,555,910 describes greenish yellow to reddish yellow disperse dyes prepared by using Homophthalimide as a coupling component. These dyes are fast to light and thermal fixation. Present invention encompasses bisazo pigments from Homophthalimide having good fastness properties.<br>
Homophthalimide was used as a coupling component by Tilak et.al. as described in an Indian Patent No. 154460., in which yellow to violet azo N-substituted Homophthalimide disperse dyes were prepared for application to synthetic fibers. Several aromatic amines were diazotized and coupled with N-substituted Homophthalimide in an aqeous alkaline solution and precipitated dyestuff was separated. Present invention encompasses bisazo pigments from Homophthalimide having good fastness properties.<br>
Indian Patent No. 148462 discloses a process for the preparation of yellow to scarlet azo cationic dyes suitable for application to polyacrylonitrile fibers. In this patent p-amino-phenacylammonium chloride was diazotized and coupled with different couplers e.g. N,N-dimethylaniline, β-naphthol, etc., then the resulting dye was quaternised with aqueous trimethylamine at 25-45° C to give the azo cationic dyes. Present invention encompasses bisazo pigments from Homophthalimide having good fastness properties.<br>
Japanese patent No. Jpn.Kokai Tokkyo Koho JP 07,168,379 discloses colorants prepared by tetrazotising 4,4'-diaminobenzanilide and coupling with naphthol AS to give electrographic photoreceptors.

Present invention encompasses Homophthalimide derivatives as couplers to give bisazo pigments having good fastness properties.<br><br>
Two Japanese patents JP 59,33,456 and JP 58,217,556 discloses colorants<br>
prepared from 4,4'-diaminoazobenzene as a tetrazo, component and various couplers used<br>
are naphthol AS, pyrazolones, and naphthalimides etc. Present invention encompasses<br>
Homophthalimide derivatives as couplers to give bisazo pigments having good fastness<br>
properties.	<br>
European patent No. EP 78,575 discloses colorants from substituted 4,4'-diaminoazobenzene and naphthol AS. These colorants are used as an electrophotographic photosensitive material. Present invention encompasses Homophthalimide derivatives as couplers to give bisazo pigments having good fastness properties.<br>
European patent No. EP 94 079 discloses Photosensitive materials for electrophotography prepare by tetrazotising 4,4'-diaminoazoenzene and coupling with couplers like naphthol AS, pyrazolones, acetoacetanalides, naphthalimides etc. Present invention encompasses Homophthalimide derivatives as couplers to give bisazo pigments having good fastness properties.<br>
Japanese patent no. Jpn.Kokai.Tokkyo Koho JP 01,234,470 discloses disazo pigments from 4,4'-diaminobenzanilide, and 4,4'-diaminoazobenzene. Pyrazolone type couplers are used in this patent. Present invention encompasses Homophthalimide derivatives as couplers to give bisazo pigments haying good fastness properties.<br>
Delia Porta G et.al reported in Cancer Letters 14(3), 1981 , 329-336, that 4,4'-diaminoazobenzene and 4,4'-diaminobenzanilide are noncarcinogenic in nature.<br>
Thus there is no report in the prior art of use of Homophthalimide to prepare bisazo pigments. The present invention disclose use of Homophthalimide derivatives to prepare novel bisazo pigments having excellent fastness properties and application in paints, printing inks and polymers. Nonmutagenic and less toxic diamines were used for the synthesis of these pigments. Further such high molecular size of pigments will impart good fastness properties. Objectives of the Invention:<br>
It is therefore objective of the present invention to synthesize novel Bisazo pigments from Homophthalimide derivatives having good fastness properties. Another object is to exploit Homophthalimide for the synthesis of Bisazo pigments.<br><br>
A further object is to provide new class of pigments that will display excellent overall<br>
stability and fastness characteristics.<br>
Yet further object is to use less toxic and nonmutagenic diamines to synthesize bisazo<br>
pigments and to prepare high molecular weight and large molecular size pigments from<br>
Homophthalimide.<br>
These and still other objects, which will appear even more clearly to the skilled in the art,<br>
are achieved according to this invention.<br>
Summary of the Invention;<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention;<br><br>
Where,<br>
X = part of an aromatic diamine such as<br><br>
As   described   earlier, the   invention   concerns   a   new   Bisazo   pigments   from Homopthalimide having the general formula I<br>
CH3CH2CH2CH20<br>

-CH2CH2OH, -CH2CH2CN, NHCOR' Where R' = C6H5, 4-MeC6H4, p-N02C6H4<br>
These pigments are also useful for preparing paints, printing inks and for coloration of polymers. The pigments of general formula I are obtained by tetrazotising aromatic diamines and coupling with Homophthalimide derivatives. Different aromatic diamines used are 4,4'-diaminobenzanilide, 4,4'-diaminosulfanilide, 4,4'-diaminoazobenzene, 3,3'-di-n-propoxybenzidine, 3,3'-di-n-butoxybenzidine , 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone, 4,4'- diaminodiphenylamine, Bis(4-aminophenyl)methanone, 3,3'-di-n-propylbenzidine,<br><br>
3,3'-di-( P-methoxyethoxy) benzidine,    2,2'-dimethoxy-5,5'-dipropoxybenzidine, 2,2'-dichloro-5,5 '-dipropoxybenzidine etc. The reaction is as shown in Scheme 1 Scheme I.<br><br>
Typically respective diamine is dispersed in an ice/water mixture in the presence of HCI. The mixture was stirred at 5°C, and sodium nitrite solution was added at such a rate to maintain a slight excess of HNO2. The tetrazotisation was continued for 30 min and the resulting tetrazonium salt was added drop wise at 5°C, to the coupling component dispersion, obtained by dissolution in a H2O/ NapH mixture, followed by precipitation with CH3COOH at pH 7, at such a rate that no presence of tetrazo intermediate was observed. The coupling was continued for several hours, and after the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was heated to boiling. The obtained pigment was filtered hot, washed with hot water and dried.<br><br>
Different Homophthalimide derivatives which can be used are<br><br>
OH<br>
Homophthalimide derivatives<br>

Where R' = C6H5, 4-MeC6H4, p-N02C6H4<br>
The ratio of diamine to Homophthalimide ranges from 1:2 to 1:2.2.<br>
Diazotization as well as coupling reactions are carried out in a temperature range between<br>
