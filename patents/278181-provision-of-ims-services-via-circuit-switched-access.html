				<td>Technical field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to providing IMS service to a user having circuited-switched<br>
controlled user's equipment.<br>
Background<br>
Third Generation (3G) Networks such as UMTS (Universal Telecommunication Network) and<br>
CDMA 2000 provide high-speed wireless Internet access to mobile users over a wide<br>
coverage area. For the 3G networks the IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS has been defined to<br>
provide cellular access to the services of the Internet in order to support telephony and<br>
multimedia services. The IMS uses packet-switched technology, in particular IP-network and<br>
other IETF protocols for provision of services. The 2nd Generation networks, like GSM,<br>
provide voice based on a circuit-switched technology. The strength of IMS is the provision of<br>
enhanced Services, for example multimedia services combining voice and data. Further, the<br>
usage of IP-network as a single underlying standard allows an easy and fast service<br>
deployment.<br>
A Session Initiation Protocol SIP has been chosen in IMS for signalling between the user's<br>
equipment UE and the IMS as well as between the components within the IMS. The IMS<br>
uses SIP also to complete voice and multimedia calls in the Internet. In order to be able to<br>
use the IMS service, the communicating user's equipment has to support IMS, which means<br>
SIP has to be implemented in the user's equipment.<br>
In the following simplified network architectures of IMS is described. In particular the nodes<br>
being involved in provision of service in IMS architecture are mentioned.<br>
The components of the IMS system are the Call Session Control Function (CSCF), the<br>
Media Gateway (MGW)/Media Gateway Control Function (MGCF), the Home Subscriber<br>
Register (HSR), the Application Server (AS), and the Transport Signalling Gateway (T-<br>
SGW).<br>
The CSCF acts as a call server and handles call signalling, it supports and controls the<br>
multimedia sessions and performs address translation functions. The CSCF can be<br>
functionally decomposed to S-CSCF, I-CSCF and P-CSCF. The Proxy-CSCF (P-CSCF) is<br>
the first contact point in a visited IMS network and it provides authorization of bearer<br>
 <br>
resources, further it forwards a SIP register request received from the User Equipment UE to<br>
an I-CSCF determined using the home domain name, as provided by the UE. In the opposite<br>
direction it forwards the SIP request or response to the UE. Moreover the CSCF forwards<br>
SIP messages received from the UE to a SIP server (S-CSCF) whose name the P-CSCF<br>
has received as a result of the registration procedure.<br>
The Interrogating - CSCF (I-CSCF) is the contact point within an operator's network for all<br>
connections destined to a subscriber of that network operator, or a roaming user currently<br>
located within that network operator's service area. There may be multiple l-CSCFs within an<br>
operator's network. The main function performed by the I-CSCF is assigning a S-CSCF to a<br>
user performing SIP registration. The Serving Call Session Control Function (S-CSCF) is the<br>
node that performs the session management for the IMS network. There can be several S-<br>
CSCFs in the network. The main functions of S-CSCF include: acceptation of registration<br>
requests from UE, interacting with services platforms for the support of services. Further it<br>
provides endpoints with service event related information (like for example notification of<br>
tones/announcement together with location of additional media resources, billing<br>
notification).<br>
The Home Subscriber Register HSR is the centralized subscriber database. The HSR<br>
interfaces with the I-CSCF and the S-CSCF to provide information about the location of the<br>
subscriber and the subscriber's subscription information. The HSR is responsible for holding<br>
the following user related information: user identification, numbering and addressing<br>
information, user security information for authentication and authorization. The HSR<br>
supports the user registration, and stores inter-system location information.<br>
The IMS supports several nodes for inter-working with legacy networks. These are the<br>
Media Gateway Control Function (MGCF) and the Transport Signalling Gateway (TSGW).<br>
The MGCF performs protocol conversion between cellular call control protocols and IMS<br>
protocols. For example, the MGCF receives a SIP message from the CSCF and converts it<br>
into appropriate ISUP messages and sends it to the Transport Signaling Gateway. Thus, the<br>
primary function of MGCF is to convert signalling information from one format to another in<br>
uplink and downlink direction. In UMTS this will predominantly be between Pulse Code<br>
Modulation (PCM) in the PSTN and an IP based format.<br>
 <br>
The T-SGW is the signaling end point in the case of interworking with PSTN/legacy<br>
networks. It maps call-related signaling protocols from/to PSTN on an IP bearer and sends it<br>
to/from the MGCF. The T-SGW converts the lower layers of SS7 into IP.<br>
As already mentioned the UMTS system allows mobiles operating in packet mode to<br>
establish voice calls using SIP as the signalling protocol. The SIP messages are sent to<br>
communicate the request to the Call Session Control Function (CSCF) in the IMS. In this<br>
case, the data is transmitted as packets throughout the UMTS network. However in order to<br>
access any service in IMS the user has to perform a registration procedure in the IMS<br>
system. Said registration procedure is performed by means of an user agent being<br>
implemented in the user's equipment.<br>
Thus, the IMS has been deployed for the 3G networks for provision of services using packet-<br>
switched technology with SIP as applied signalling protocol. However, currently the major<br>
numbers of user's equipment do not support IMS technology with SIP as signalling protocol<br>
for voice service, since said user's equipment is adapted for a circuit-switched controlled<br>
domain. Thus, for the access to the IMS an adaptation of the user's equipment is necessary.<br>
Summary and description of the invention<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a solution for providing IMS<br>
services to user's equipment operating in circuit-switched controlled domain.<br>
The invention is disclosed in the independent claims. Advantageous embodiments are<br>
described in the dependent claims being disclosed in the corresponding parts of the<br>
description.<br>
According to the present invention it is proposed to provide an Access Gateway Node<br>
comprising a circuit-switched function, a user agent and an exchange interface. The circuit-<br>
switched function has all the functions being required to exchange signalling with the<br>
cellular-switched controlled network, in which a user is located. Further the circuit-switched<br>
function has the ability to exchange information with a register being located in the circuit-<br>
switched controlled domain. Preferably said register is a Home Location Register HLR,<br>
which provides IP multimedia system parameter to the Access Gateway Node. Said<br>
parameters are used according to the present invention for registration the user in the IMS<br>
 <br>
system. In order to interact with the IMS the received data are provided over the exchange<br>
interface to the user agent.<br>
In one embodiment it is proposed that the IP multimedia system parameter is an indication<br>
that a subscription of the circuit-switched controlled user's terminal has been ported to the IP<br>
multimedia system. In this case the Access Gateway Node is responsible to provide the IP<br>
multimedia system parameters which are required to register the circuit-switched controlled<br>
user's terminal in the IP multimedia system.<br>
In a further embodiment it is proposed that the received IP multimedia system parameter,<br>
received from the register includes already a list of parameters required to register the<br>
circuit-switched controlled user's terminal in the IP multimedia system.<br>
According to one of the embodiments of the present invention, the exchange interface is<br>
adapted to deliver the IP multimedia system parameter provided by the circuit-switched<br>
function to the user agent being responsible for the registration of the user in the IP<br>
multimedia system or for updating a current registration. However in order to exchange this<br>
kind of message between two different systems it is proposed to provide a translation<br>
mechanism between circuit-switched controlled signalling and IMS controlled signalling, in<br>
particular in view of the different signalling protocols and their required parameters.<br>
Further it is proposed that the circuit-switched function is adapted to receive mobility related<br>
notification from a mobile switching node to which the circuit-switched controlled user's<br>
terminal is attached for handling the provision of an access to the IP multimedia system.<br>
Thus for example in a GSM network a signalling mechanism is available to inform that the<br>
user is still attached to the network, although the user does not perform any calls. According<br>
to the present invention it is proposed to provide this kind of information to the IP multimedia<br>
system in order to keep the user's registration alive.<br>
Further it is proposed to provide a register located in a circuit-switched controlled domain<br>
and communicating with the circuited-switched function, which is located in the Access<br>
Gateway Node. Preferably said register is a Home Location Register as already known in<br>
GSM providing data of all users having subscription in a network, for which the HLR is<br>
responsible. Said register comprises a receiver entity adapted to receive a request message<br>
regarding handling a circuit-switched controlled user's terminal. The message might be for<br>
example an update message when a user changes the serving areas. In this case a<br>
 <br>
corresponding update of user's data is to be performed in the register in order to be able to<br>
locate the user.<br>
Further the register comprises a provision module adapted to provide information about the<br>
functionality of the circuit-switched function. According to the present invention the circuit-<br>
switched function either is enhanced with the user agent functionality, which means that the<br>
circuit-switched function is part of the Access Gateway Node or this kind of functionality is<br>
not supported, which means in case of GSM the circuit-switched function is for example the<br>
well known MSC. It is proposed to store this information in a place being accessible by the<br>
register. Another embodiment might be that an indication about supported functionality of the<br>
circuit switched function is included in a message sent from said circuit-switched function to<br>
the register. In this case the task of the provision module is to extract the information from<br>
the received message. Said message might be either a separate message or the required<br>
information might be included in any existing and suitable message, like for example in an<br>
update message.<br>
Moreover it is proposed that the register comprises a user's parameter module adapted to<br>
provide user's IP multimedia system parameter applicable in the IP multimedia system in<br>
case the circuit-switched function is part of the Access Gateway Node.<br>
Further it is proposed that the register comprises a sender entity for sending the users IP<br>
multimedia system parameter to the wireless switching function.<br>
Further it is proposed that the register further comprises a tracking module adapted to keep<br>
track on a serving Access Gateway Node and on a mobile switching node to which the<br>
circuit-switched controlled user's terminal is attached. This might be for example the case<br>
when a user is in a visited network, which does not have the Access Gateway Nodes. In this<br>
case the user is attached to a usual circuit-switched function, like for example MSC.<br>
However the IMS provision is performed by means of the Access Gateway Node located in<br>
the home network. Thus, it is proposed that the register keeps track on both nodes.<br>
Further it is proposed that the register node further comprises a selection unit adapted to<br>
select a new serving Access Gateway Node in case the circuit-switched controlled user's<br>
terminal leaves a serving area of a present Access Gateway Node. The register might have<br>
for example a list with the available Access Gateway Nodes and according to the location of<br>
the user one is selected.<br>
 <br>
Further it is an advantage of the present invention that the register node comprises also a<br>
modification module adapted to modify the user's IP multimedia system parameter before<br>
sending it in case the circuit-switched controlled user's terminal is served by a mobile<br>
switching node. As above already mentioned when a user is to be handled by a well known<br>
MSC than it is proposed to send modified user's IP multimedia system parameter, which<br>
means that although the user is ported to IP multimedia system a usual circuit-switched<br>
service is to be provided to the user.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention the complete IP multimedia parameter is sent only<br>
to an identified Access Gateway Node. Otherwise said parameters are to be modified since<br>
not all of the parameters are applicable for the circuit-switched function. For example it is<br>
proposed to remove services from the user's IP multimedia system parameter which are only<br>
handled in the IP multimedia system.<br>
Further it is proposed to have a method which is to be carried out in the Access Gateway<br>
Node. Thus, it is proposed that a circuit-switched function receives from a circuit-switched<br>
controlled user's terminal a registration message, and upon receipt of this message an<br>
interaction with a register node for providing user's IP multimedia system parameter is<br>
performed. When a message including the user's IP multimedia system parameter from a<br>
server is received, said circuit-switched function provides the received user's IP multimedia<br>
system parameter to an user agent being also a part of the Access Gateway Node. The user<br>
agent uses the user's IP multimedia system parameter to register the circuit-switched<br>
controlled user's terminal in the IP multimedia system (IMS).<br>
Further it is also proposed to have a method which is to be carried out in the register. In a<br>
first step the register receives a request message regarding a circuit-switched controlled<br>
user's terminal from the circuit-switched function for handling the circuit-switched controlled<br>
user's terminal. Further information is provided about a functionality of the circuit-switched<br>
function sending the request message. The functionality indicates whether the circuit-<br>
switched function is part of an Access Gateway. In such a case user's IP multimedia system<br>
parameter applicable in the IP multimedia system are provided to the circuit-switched<br>
function. Finally a message is sent to the circuit-switched function with the user's IP<br>
multimedia system parameter.<br>
 <br>
The advantage of the present invention is that it provides a smooth migration from a circuit-<br>
switched domain to a packet-switched domain. In particular for a user with a circuit-switched<br>
adapted equipment a solution is given to use IMS service.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments are described in the dependent claims.<br>

It should be noted that the term "entity", "node", "module", in the context of the present<br>
invention refers to any suitable combination of hardware and software for providing a<br>
predetermined functionality in the communication network. In this way, said terms generally<br>
refers to a logical entity that can be spread out over several physical entities, but can also<br>
refer to a physical entity located in one physical location, if no explicit definition is given.<br>
It should be noted that the term "user" in the context of the present invention refers to circuit-<br>
switched controlled user equipment, wherein said user equipment is a combination of<br>
hardware and software. However in the following description the terms "user" and "user<br>
equipment" should be seen as having the same meaning, if it is not stated differently.<br>
Preferably, the communication network is a mobile communication network, e.g. is a<br>
wireless communication network operating according to GSM, GPRS (General Packet<br>
Switched Radio) or UMTS (Universal Mobile Telephone System) or any 3G system like for<br>
example EDGE, CDMA2000.<br>
In the following a preferably embodiment according to Fig.1 is presented. Fig. 1 shows a<br>
schematic representation of an architecture of an Access Gateway Node, 10 according to<br>
the present invention. In particular in Fig.1 the Access Gateway Node, 10 is depicted which<br>
communicates on one side with the IP multimedia system, which will be called in the<br>
following IMS, 11 and on the other hand with the cellular-switched controlled network, 12,<br>
like for example GSM. In the foregoing description a node called MAGCF Mobile Access<br>
Gateway Control Function represents an embodiment of the Access Gateway Node, 10. The<br>
 <br>
Access Gateway Node comprises a circuit-switched function 101, a user agent 102 and an<br>
exchange interface 103.<br>
It is to be noted that although the Access Gateway Mode, 10 is depicted in Fig.1 between<br>
the network 11 and the network 12, this location should not be seen as any restriction for the<br>
present invention. The Access Gateway Node is to be located in any suitable place.<br>
According to one of the embodiments it is proposed to place said node in the circuit-switched<br>
domain, 12.<br>
The circuit-switched function 101 is preferably a function fulfilling the functionality of MSC.<br>
Thus, it has all the functions being required to exchange signalling with the cellular-switched<br>
controlled network, 12 in which a user is located, wherein the communication with the user is<br>
performed over a radio interface, not depicted in Fig.1. Said connection might be performed<br>
by means by any suitably signalling protocol, in case of GSM this might be the well-known<br>
Mobile Application Protocol MAP or ISUP or BICC. Thus, the task of the circuit-switched<br>
function 101 is to provide exchange signalling for a circuit-switched controlled user's terminal<br>
located in the circuit-switched controlled domain CS, as it is performed currently in GSM by<br>
means of MSC with all its functions. Further the circuit-switched function 101 has the ability<br>
to exchange information with a register 121 being located in the circuit-switched controlled<br>
domain, interface 13. Preferably said register is a Home Location Register HLR, which<br>
provides IP multimedia system parameter to the Access Gateway Node. Said parameters<br>
are used according to the present invention for registration the user in the IMS system. In<br>
order to interact with the IMS the received data are provided over the exchange interface<br>
103 to the user agent 102. Preferably, a SIP agent might perform the task of the user agent<br>
102. This includes for example the registration of the user or updating of the user's data in<br>
the IMS. The communication for this purpose is performed by means of the link 14 according<br>
to Fig.1<br>
Fig. 2 represents an embodiment for the realisation of a register 121 located in a circuit-<br>
switched controlled domain, CS, 12 and communicating with the Access Gateway Node 10.<br>
Preferably said register is a Home Location Register as already known in GSM providing<br>
data of all users having subscription in a network, for which the HLR is responsible.<br>
According to the present invention it is proposed to extend the register in a way to be able to<br>
provide IP multimedia system parameter to the Access Gateway Node, besides its ability to<br>
communicate with a circuit-switched function 101, like for example in case of GSM with the<br>
MSC. According to Fig.2 said register 121 comprises a receiver entity 21 adapted to receive<br>
 <br>
a request message regarding handling a circuit-switched controlled user's terminal, 201. The<br>
messages might be for example an update message when a user changes the serving<br>
areas. In this case a corresponding update of user's data is to be performed in the register in<br>
order to be able to locate the user. In case of GSM a MAP:Location update message is sent<br>
from the MSC to the HLR. However, this is only one preferably embodiment for the<br>
implementation of the messages.<br>
Further the register 121 comprises a provision module 22 adapted to provide information<br>
about the functionality of the circuit-switched function 101. According to the present invention<br>
the circuit-switched function either is enhanced with the user agent functionality, which<br>
means that the circuit-switched function is part of the Access Gateway Node or this kind of<br>
functionality is not supported, which means in case of GSM the circuit-switched function is<br>
the well known MSC. Thus, it is the task of the provision module to provide this kind of<br>
information. There might be different ways of suitable and preferable realisations. For<br>
example this kind of information might be stored in a place being accessible by the register<br>
and not in the register itself. This might be for example a list with all the circuit-switched<br>
functions and an indication whether said circuit-switched function is part of the Access<br>
Gateway Node. The task of the provision module is in this case to deliver the information<br>
from the list. Further embodiment might be that an indication about supported functionality of<br>
the circuit switched function is included in a message sent from said circuit-switched function<br>
to the register. In this case the task of the provision module is to extract the information from<br>
the received message. Said message might be either a separate message or the required<br>
information might be included in any existing and suitable message, like for example in an<br>
update message.<br>
Moreover it is proposed that the register 121 comprises a user's parameter module 23<br>
adapted to provide user's IP multimedia system parameter applicable in the IP multimedia<br>
system in case the circuit-switched function is part of the Access Gateway Node. Preferably<br>
the IP multimedia system parameters are to be stored together with other user's related<br>
data. However it might be also suitable to store only indication that the user is ported to the<br>
IP multimedia system. The user is ported to IP multimedia system, if the user has made an<br>
active decision to end a current circuit-switched contract with the corresponding service<br>
provider and has signed a new contract for using IP multimedia Services. Another option<br>
might be that the operator decides to port all of the subscribers to the IP multimedia Services<br>
providing still some subset of the old circuit-switched services.<br>
 <br>
Further parameters which might be required during different procedures might be delivered<br>
from the appropriate places, like for example an additional data base might be provided<br>
which is to be accessible by the user agent 103.<br>
Further it is proposed that the register comprises a sender entity 24 for sending the user's IP<br>
multimedia system parameter to the wireless switching function over the interface 202.<br>
In respect to Fig. 3 an embodiment of the present invention for a method to be performed on<br>
the Access Gateway Node is presented. In step 31 a circuit-switched function located in the<br>
Access Gateway Node receives from a circuit-switched controlled user's terminal a<br>
registration message. That implies that the user has a circuit-switched terminal without<br>
support for the IMS services. According to the well-known procedure the wireless switching<br>
function being, according to the present invention, part of the Access Gateway Node<br>
interacts with a register node for providing user's IP multimedia system parameter, 32. In the<br>
subsequent step, 33 the circuit-switched function receives the requested IP multimedia<br>
system parameters and provides them to a user agent located in the Access Gateway Node,<br>
34. Upon receipt of said parameter the user agent initiates a procedure for registration the<br>
user in the IP multimedia system (IMS), 35.<br>
In the following a basic concept of the present invention is described. According to the<br>
present invention it is proposed, in order to allow IMS to take the full call and service control,<br>
to place a user agent being responsible for the user in a new node type called MAGCF being<br>
an embodiment of the above mentioned Access Gateway Node. This new node combines<br>
therefore the logical functionality of a cellular switching center and the logical functionality of<br>
IMS. In particular it is proposed that the MAGCF comprises well-known functionality like for<br>
example a MSC-S being serving MSC for a roaming user, a GMSC-S for terminating calls to<br>
a roaming user in a network without MAGCF functionality, a MGCF performing protocol<br>
conversion between cellular call control protocols and IMS protocols, a P-CSCF forwarding<br>
SIP messages from the user to IMS and from IMS to the user, a User Agent fulfilling the IMS<br>
functionality and handling on behalf of the user.<br>
The basic concept is that the MAGCF hosts the user agent of the subscriber and registers<br>
the subscriber having a cellular controlled access in IMS. Therefore, the MAGCF is the<br>
roaming anchor point for the cellular access towards IMS. In the following different<br>
embodiments for the realization of the anchor point are described. For example an<br>
embodiment is given describing changing of a service MSC-S while roaming in a home<br>
 <br>
network. In this case the MAGCF roaming anchor point is moved to the new MSC-S.<br>
Further, when roaming into a visited network without support for MAGCF, the last<br>
responsible MAGCF is kept as anchor point. In all embodiments it is to be ensured that all<br>
originating and terminating calls of the subscriber are routed via the responsible MAGCF. In<br>
general it might be said that the MAGCF interworks the circuit-switched protocols towards<br>
IMS protocols and vice versa.<br>
In the following an embodiment of the present invention is described in respect to Fig. 4,<br>
presenting the user's registration procedure, including an attach procedure.<br>
Fig.4 depicts a cellular capable user equipment UE communicating with the MAGCF over a<br>
UTRAN/GERAN access network. The MAGCF node according to the present invention has<br>
functionality to communicate with the cellular-switched controlled system and with the IMS<br>
system. The IMS system comprises I-CSCF, S-CSCF and HSR nodes. According to the<br>
present invention said MAGCF node has the MSC functionality, like MSC-S and the IMS<br>
functionality in form of user agent UA. The MAGCF has therefore the capability to<br>
communicate with the HLR and with the IMS. Further there is also the IMS Access Server<br>
IMS AS for provision of IMS services communicating with HSR and S-CSCF. The sequence<br>
of the messages exchange is depicted by means of lines provided with arrows. The dotted<br>
lines are provided to show the signalling connections between the nodes.<br>
In the following traffic case is described, when a user switches on the circuit-switched<br>
controlled user equipment UE in a home network. In the first step, 401 UE sends an IMSI<br>
attach message to the MAGCF in order to become reachable via the circuit-switched<br>
controlled access. Since this is a new subscriber being not registered in the MAGCF, the<br>
responsible HLR is contacted to inform about the location update, 402. Preferably the HLR<br>
has information that the received information is from a MSC being enhanced with the<br>
MAGCF functionality. In this case of a static list being administrated by the HLR, no changes<br>
on the interface between MSC and HLR has to be implemented, that means that a standard<br>
protocol for communication, like for example the MAP protocol might be used. However<br>
optionally in step 402, the MAGCF can indicate to the HLR that it has the MAGCF<br>
functionality, to differentiate itself from a MSC supporting only cellular-switched functionality.<br>
However, this would imply changes to the standard MAP protocol. On the basis of the<br>
provided information, either by checking the indication in the MAP Update Location<br>
message, or by checking a list with all MAGCF nodes, the HLR checks whether the sending<br>
node has MAGCF functionality. In the following step, the HLR checks the requesting<br>
 <br>
subscriber. In order to provide the IMS functionality to the users, said users has to be ported<br>
to the IMS system. In other words, the user has to either announce actively the change to<br>
the IMS system or the system might decide to port cellular users to the IMS system. A<br>
corresponding notification about the user is to be stated in the HLR. In case a user is not<br>
ported, it is proposed to apply the standard behaviour for a cellular user like it is already<br>
known. In case the user is ported to the IMS, it is proposed that the HLR inserts the IMS<br>
related subscriber data into the MAGCF required to register said user to the IMS system,<br>
step 403. Preferably the HLR sends all the parameters, which are usually stored at the SIM<br>
card in the user's equipment. The MAGCF receives the message 403, wherein it is to be<br>
pointed out that the communication with the HLR is performed by the circuit-switched<br>
functionality of the MAGCF, in particular the MSC is involved therein. Upon receipt of the<br>
message from the HLR, the MAGCF checks at first whether the user supports the IMS, in<br>
case of supporting the MSC-F contacts the user agent in order to register and to subscribe<br>
the subscriber in the IMS system, steps 404 and 405. Preferably the applied protocol for the<br>
registration and for the subscription purpose is the SIP protocol, in this case also the user<br>
agent has SIP functionality implemented. During the IMS registration, the user agent acts on<br>
behalf of the subscriber. All steps necessary for registration like for example, the<br>
authorization of the users, are performed -by the means of the IMS entities integrated in the<br>
MAGCF. The result of the registration is that the MAGCF stores the S-CSCF address and<br>
following the IMS rules for registration, the S-CSCF stores the MAGCF address where the<br>
registered subscriber can be reached. After successful registration, in step 405, the user<br>
agent in the MAGCF subscribes in the S-CSCF to the registration status of the served<br>
subscriber. So if the registration status of the subscriber is changed in the S-CSCF, the<br>
MAGCF is to be informed.<br>
As a consequence of the procedure according to Fig. 4, the subscriber is attached in the<br>
MAGCF from the cellular controlled side and registered in the IMS. The same procedure is<br>
presented in more detail in the signaling sequence in respect to Fig.5. The same nodes as in<br>
Fig.4 are depicted.<br>
Currently in order to access circuit-switched service a registration procedure of the user in<br>
the circuit-switched network is to be performed. Said registration procedure might be<br>
performed during location update procedure. Thus, in case a user changes the location a<br>
24.008 IMSI attach message is sent to the responsible mobile switching center MSC, which<br>
derives the Home Location Register HLR address from the received IMSI. Thus, in the first<br>
step the UE sends the 24.008 message Location Update to the MAGCF, indicating the<br>
 <br>
location update type, namely IMSI attach, to initiate the registration procedure in the cellular<br>
system. By means of a MAP protocol being the application protocol employed for the<br>
dialogues between the MSC and HLR, the HLR is contacted for authentification of the user.<br>
For this purpose the MAGCF sends MAP: Fetch triplets to the HLR in order to receive user's<br>
parameters required for performing authentication. In case the user is authorised, the<br>
procedure for updating the user's location by sending the message MAP: Update Location<br>
(IMSI) is sent. Subsequently, the HLR checks whether the sending node has MAGCF<br>
functionality. This can be checked either by receiving an indication in the MAP Update<br>
Location message, or by checking a list being accessible by the HLR where all MAGCF<br>
nodes are listed. Preferably this list is to be administered in the HLR. In the following step,<br>
the HLR checks the requesting subscriber, whether the subscriber is ported to IMS. If the<br>
user is not ported, standard behaviour for location update of a cellular user is applied by<br>
sending MAP: Insert Subscriber Data in order to insert the user to the MSC. However, if the<br>
user is ported to IMS, the HLR inserts the subscriber data into the MAGCF by sending MAP:<br>
Insert Subscriber Data. Additionally in the message, IMS related data, like information<br>
required for the registration in the IMS system might be sent. This might be for example IMPI<br>
(IP Multimedia Private Identity), IMPU IP Multimedia Public identity, Home Register, and/or<br>
Authentication key. The IMPI and the IMPU are the private and public identity of the<br>
subscriber, used together with the Authentication Key to register in the Home Registrar of<br>
the subscriber. In other words the HLR sends all the parameters to the MGCF, which are<br>
stored on the SIM in user's terminal. Finally, the message MAP:Update Location Accept is<br>
sent from the HLR to the MAGCF, finalizing the registration procedure in the cellular<br>
controlled network.<br>
After the interaction the HLR is completed, the user agent located in the MAGCF registers<br>
the subscriber into IMS, indicating the reachability of the user via cellular-switched controlled<br>
access. Thus, during the IMS registration, the user agent handles on behalf of the<br>
subscriber.<br>
As already mentioned the IMS uses SIP protocol for performing any kind of signalling,<br>
including the user's registration in the IMS system. A user equipment needs to perform IMS<br>
service registration before it can set up a session. Through a successful registration a<br>
suitable S-CSCF in the home network is assigned to the user in order to obtain the IMS<br>
service. According to the present invention the User Agent located in the MAGCF handles<br>
on behalf of the user. At first user's identity in the initial register request is sent to the I-<br>
CSCF, SIP:Register.<br>
 <br>
For the IMS the user agent located in the MAGCF is transparent, which means that the IMS<br>
does not notice that a user agent acts on behalf of the user and which means again, that the<br>
location of the user agent in the MAGCF does not have any impact on the registration or<br>
subscription procedure.<br>
As aforementioned the I-CSCF is the contact point within an operator's network for all<br>
connections destined to a subscriber of that network operator, or a roaming user currently<br>
located within that network operator's service area. The main function performed by the I-<br>
CSCF is assigning a S-CSCF to a user performing SIP registration. The S-CSCF is the node<br>
that performs the session management for the IMS network.<br>
Returning to Fig.5 in order to find out whether an S-CSCF is already assigned to the user,<br>
the I-CSCF contacts the HSR, Auth.Req., being a data base administrating all IMS users.<br>
Subsequently the I-CSCF receives an answer with an address of a S-CSCF for contacting.<br>
The address might be either an S-CSCF already allocated to the user or if it is the first<br>
registration, for example after the user switched on the user equipment, the HSR returns a<br>
set of S-CSCF capabilities for selecting an S-CSCF. On the base of the capabilities and<br>
other available information an I-CSCF chooses an appropriate S-CSCF for the particular<br>
user. Then, the I-CSCF continues with the process by proxying the SIP:Register message to<br>
the chosen S-CSCF. The S-CSCF upon receipt of the message, starts the authentication of<br>
the user. For this purpose a dialogue with the HSR is performed for downloading<br>
authentication data. The HSR sends authentication data to the S-CSCF regarding the<br>
requesting user, so that the S-CSCF can properly authenticate the user. In order to verify the<br>
authentication performed internally, the S-SCCF sends a 401 Unauthorized message being<br>
forwarded via I-CSCF to the SIP receiver, wherein according to the present invention the SIP<br>
receiver is the user agent in the MGACF. Therefore for the IMS nodes, like I-CSCF, HSR, S-<br>
CSCF the user's functionality being shifted to the user agent according to the present<br>
invention, is transparent and said nodes do not notice any change in the handling of the<br>
registration.<br>
When the user agent receives the SIP 401 Unauthorised response, it realises that there is a<br>
challenge included to deliver authentication parameter stored locally. Thus, upon receipt of<br>
this message the user agent derives the authentication data in an appropriate way by<br>
calculating a response and the user agent sends the second SIP: Register message to the<br>
S-CSCF. The same operation as for the first registration request is performed and it results<br>
 <br>
that the S-CSCF performs a checking of the response with the already for the user stored<br>
authentication and if the verification is successful, then the S-CSCF sends a Server Ass.Req<br>
to the HSR for the purpose of informing the HSR that the user is now registered and in order<br>
to download the user profile. The S-CSCF replies with 200OK response and the MAGCF<br>
stores the S-CSCF address. Finally, following the IMS rules for registration, the S-CSCF<br>
stores the MAGCF address where the now registered subscriber can be reached. The<br>
storing of the MAGCF address is performed with receiving SIP: Subscribe (change of<br>
MAGCF address), which is also confirmed with the message 200OK. After finalising the<br>
registration procedure in the IMS, a 24:008 Location Update Ack is sent to the user<br>
indicating successful performed registration.<br>
Additionally in this embodiment it is proposed that after successful registration, the user<br>
agent in the MAGCF subscribes in the S-CSCF to the registration status of the served<br>
subscriber. Thus, if the registration status of the subscriber changes in the S-CSCF, the<br>
MAGCF is to be informed thereabout. For example in case of roaming as it is described in<br>
the following embodiment, the MAGCF is to be informed that a user has left the<br>
responsibility area of said MAGCF.<br>
The interaction with the IMS AS regarding third party registration is depicted in Fig. 5 for the<br>
sake of completeness without any impact on the invention.<br>
In the following an embodiment describing roaming procedure in a home network is<br>
described in respect to Fig.6.<br>
The structure and nodes in Fig.6 are similar to the structure according to Fig.4. A home<br>
network is a network, with which a user has subscription for provision of services. Usually in<br>
a network a number of MSCs is provided, wherein a MSC is responsible for users being<br>
located in location areas being assigned to the MSC. Changing of the responsible MSC due<br>
to user's movement implies initiation of the roaming procedure aiming to register the user in<br>
a new MSC and de-register from the old MSC by performing all the necessary updates in<br>
respect therewith in the corresponding nodes.<br>
Thus, Fig.6 depicts a home network with two MAGCFs nodes, MAGCF61 and MAGCF62<br>
and with a user roaming from MAGCF61 to MAGCF62, in step 600.<br>
 <br>
In this case the new MAGCF, MAGCF62 takes over the handling of the subscriber. However<br>
the change of MAGCF also affects the IMS registration, which is described in the following in<br>
respect to Fig.6.<br>
In step 601, after entering the new location area, the terminal sends a location update<br>
request to the new MAGCF, MAGCF62. When receiving this message, the MAGCF62<br>
identifies the subscriber to be new in its responsibility. Subsequently the MAGCF62 informs<br>
the HLR about the availability of the user by sending for example MAP.Update Location,<br>
step 602. Similar as before mentioned, either the MAGCF indicates in the MAP message<br>
that it supports the MAGCF functionality, or the HLR determines the supported functionality<br>
of the MSC by checking a list in the HLR. Upon receiving the location update message, 602,<br>
the HLR informs the old MAGCF, MAGCF61 that the subscriber has roamed into a new<br>
MAGCF area. The HLR sends preferably a MAP Cancel Location message, 603, to the old<br>
MAGCF, MAGCF61. The receipt of this message means for a MAGCF that it does no longer<br>
server the subscriber. However, the old MAGCF cannot remove the subscriber record yet,<br>
as it is still responsible for the IMS registration. In step 604 the HLR inserts the subscriber<br>
data into the new MAGCF using a similar approach as it is described in respect to Fig.4.<br>
Also the registration, step 605 and subscription 606 to the IMS system are performed in the<br>
similar way. That means, that the new MAGCF registers the subscriber into IMS, which<br>
results in changing the address of the serving MAGCF in the S-CSCF changes, 605. After<br>
successful registration, the user agent in the new MAGCF subscribes in the S-CSCF to the<br>
registration status of the served subscriber, 606, so that if the registration status of the<br>
subscriber is changed in the S-CSCF, the MAGCF will be informed. As a consequence of<br>
this approach, in step 607, the old MAGCF, MAGCF61 is informed by the S-CSCF that a<br>
new MAGCF is registered in the IMS. Upon receipt of the MAP Cancel Location 603 and the<br>
Notification of IMS subscription change message 607, the MAGCF61 removes the<br>
subscriber record. The result is that the cellular switched subscriber is now registered in IMS<br>
via the new MAGCF.<br>
Optionally it is proposed to avoid sending the Notification of IMS subscription change<br>
message 607. The receipt of the message might be only issued if a MAGCF subscribes for<br>
receiving these kind of notifications.<br>
In the following an embodiment describing roaming procedure in a home network is<br>
described in respect to Fig.7 presenting an exchange of signalling messages.<br>
 <br>
The nodes are similar as it is depicted and described according to Fig.5. Additionally a new<br>
and an old MAGCF are depicted. All the messages are the same as in Fig.5. The difference<br>
is that the HLR sends a MAP: Cancel Location message to the old MAGCF after performed<br>
registration procedure of a user in the cellular system. The receipt of this message causes<br>
that the old MAGCF suspends the MSC-S functionality. Also the registration procedure in the<br>
IMS is similar as in case of IMS registration as described in respect to Fig.5. The difference<br>
is that the S-CSCF notifies the old MAGCF that the MAGCF address has changed by means<br>
of the SIP: Notify message, which is confirmed with 200 OK message. Finally a<br>
SIP:Subscribe (exp=0) is sent which means that the old MAGCF unsubscribes itself from<br>
receiving any further notification about changes in user's registration in IMS. After sending<br>
this message the old MAGCF goes to idle status regarding the unregistered subscriber.<br>
While roaming, the subscriber may leave the area of the home network and enter a visited<br>
network, in which a user does not have any subscription for providing any services.<br>
Depending on the capabilities of the visited network, it may also support the MAGCF<br>
functionality in its MSC-S. In this case roaming is handled in the same way as the above<br>
described roaming in the home network. The mechanism is the same, regardless whether it<br>
is the home or the visited network.<br>
However, it may happen that the visited network does not support MAGCF functionality. In<br>
this case, special care is needed in order to serve the subscriber, as the visited network<br>
cannot take care of the IMS registration. According to the present invention it is proposed to<br>
keep the previously used MAGCF as a roaming anchor point. In the following this kind of<br>
network is called remote visited network<br>
In the following an embodiment of the present invention is described in respect to Fig.8<br>
showing the case of roaming from MAGCF to a MSC. The nodes are similar to the nodes<br>
and connections therebetween as depicted in Fig. 6. The difference is that the new location<br>
area, to which a user moves into, is served by a MSC without the MAGCF functionality.<br>
Thus, when entering the new location area, 800, the user terminal sends a location update<br>
request to the new MSCA/LR, 801. When receiving the message, the MSC/VLR identifies<br>
the subscriber to be new in the serving area of said node. In the following step, 802 the<br>
MSCA/LR informs the HLR about the new subscriber. Hereby, there are again two<br>
possibilities of informing HLR whether the MSC supports the MAGCF functionality, namely<br>
either by sending such kind of information included in a message or by checking HLR's<br>
 <br>
internal list of MAGCF nodes. In the presented embodiment, the result of the checking<br>
procedure is that the contacting MSC does not have the MAGCF functionality.<br>
Therefore in step 803, the HLR informs the MAGCF that the subscriber has roamed into a<br>
new MSC/VLR area. Preferably, the HLR sends a MAP Cancel Location message to the<br>
MAGCF. The receipt of this message means for the MAGCF that it is not responsible for<br>
serving the user in the cellular switched controlled network anymore. However, the MAGCF<br>
cannot remove the subscriber record yet, as it is still responsible for the IMS registration.<br>
Therefore it is proposed that the MAGCF stays as a roaming anchor point as long as the<br>
subscriber is roaming in the remote visited network. The HLR inserts the subscriber data into<br>
the MSC/VLR as it is well-known, 804. These data do not contain any new data being IMS<br>
specific enhancements as it is the case in the previously presented embodiments.<br>
Further it is proposed to provide a data filter in the HLR for filtering subscriber data being<br>
sent to the MSC/VLR in order to prevent execution of IMS services in the MSC/VLR. This<br>
when sending the message 804, for example in form of the MAP operation Insert Subscriber<br>
data, the HLR filters out all supplementary service subscriptions before sending the data to<br>
the MSC/VLR, like Barring of all outgoing international calls (BOIC), which is a<br>
supplementary service, which prevents to conduct international calls, when this service is<br>
active.<br>
In the following signalling exchange sequence is presented in respect to Fig. 9 depicting the<br>
embodiment of a user's roaming from an old MAGCF to a new MSC/VLR.<br>
The structure of Fig.9 is similar to the structure of the aforementioned embodiments<br>
describing signalling sequences. The Location Update in the HLR via MSC/VLR is the same<br>
as previously described. By checking the capabilities of the MSC from which the MAP:<br>
Update Location (IMSI) is received, the HLR notices that the MSC does not support the<br>
MAGCF functionality and therefore the HLR filters subscriber data by sending "not<br>
subscribed" for the supplementary services. As a consequence, MAP:lnsert Subscriber Data<br>
message is sent to the MSC/VLR for informing the MSC of non-availability of all circuit-<br>
switched services for the user.<br>
It is to be noted that the IMS registration in the S-CSCF is not affected by roaming into a<br>
remote visited network. Moreover the old MAGCF after receiving the MAP: Cancel Location<br>
only suspends the MSC functionality for the user, since this functionality is to be performed<br>
 <br>
by the new MSC/VLR. However, the old MAGCF is still the anchor point for the circuit-<br>
switched access towards IMS and interworks circuit-switched protocols towards IMS<br>
protocols. The telephony service as such and the telephony supplementary services are still<br>
provided by IMS and especially all incoming and outgoing calls are routed via the old<br>
MAGCF.<br>
In the following a further embodiment is presented. When roaming in the remote visited<br>
network, the subscriber may enter the service area of another MSC/VLR. The change from<br>
the old MSC/VLR towards the new MSC/VLR while roaming is performed in the following<br>
described way according to Fig. 10.<br>
As already mentioned, when entering a new location area, 1000, the terminal sends a<br>
location update request to the new MSC/VLR. When receiving the message, the MSC/VLR<br>
identifies the subscriber to be new in its serving area, 1001. In step 1002 the MSC/VLR<br>
informs the HLR about the new subscriber. The HLR either receives or delivers from the<br>
internal data that the MSC/VLR sending the message does not have MAGCF functionality. In<br>
the subsequent step, the HLR informs the old MSC/VLR that the subscriber has roamed into<br>
a new MSC/VLR area. The HLR sends the message 1003 to the old MSC/VLR. The receipt<br>
of this message means for the old MSC/VLR that it does no longer server the subscriber.<br>
The HLR inserts the subscriber data into the new MSC/VLR, 1004. These data do not<br>
contain any new, IMS specific enhancements due to the fact that the MSC/VLR does not<br>
support any MAGCF functionality. However, an indication is sent to cause the MSC/VLR to<br>
route all originating call to the MAGCF. Also as in the foregoing embodiment explained, the<br>
subscriber data sent to the MSC/VLR are filtered, in order to prevent execution of services in<br>
the MSC/VLR. Also as in the above described embodiment the IMS registration in the S-<br>
CSCF is not affected by this roaming into a remote visited network. The difference to the<br>
previous embodiment is that the changing of the MSC/VLR does not affect the MAGCF; the<br>
location update is performed transparent without involving the MAGCF.<br>
The signaling sequence according to this embodiment is similar to the signaling sequence as<br>
described in respect to Fig.9, with the only difference that no MAP:Cancel Location message<br>
is sent to the MAGCF but instead of this, said message is sent to the old MSCA/LR.<br>
Therefore no figure presenting the signaling sequence is introduced.<br>
In the following embodiment, in respect to Fig. 11, the scenario is presented, when roaming<br>
in the remote visited network, 1100, the subscriber may reenter the home network or another<br>
 <br>
visited network that supports MAGCF functionality. When entering the area of an MAGCF,<br>
this may be the current roaming anchor, or any other MAGCF.<br>
The first steps, 1101, 1102 remain the same as in the previous embodiments. Thus, when<br>
entering the new location area, the terminal sends a location update request to the new<br>
MAGCF, 1101, and the MAGCF informs the HLR about its new subscriber. 1102. The HLR<br>
informs the old MSC/VLR that the subscriber has roamed into a new MAGCF area, 1103.<br>
Preferably by sending a MAP Cancel Location message to the old MSC/VLR. Receipt of this<br>
message indicates to the MSC/VLR that it does no longer server the subscriber. Since the<br>
HLR has the information that the new MSC support the MAGCF functionality, the HLR<br>
inserts data into the answer required for the registration in the IMS system, 1104. The new<br>
MAGCF registers the subscriber into IMS by changing the address of the serving MAGCF in<br>
the S-CSCF changes, 1105. After successful registration, 1106, the user agent in the new<br>
MAGCF subscribes in the S-CSCF to the registration status of the served subscriber. So if<br>
the registration status of the subscriber is changed in the S-CSCF. the MAGCF will be<br>
informed. Since the old MAGCF was also registered to be notified in case of changes in the<br>
IMS subscription, the old MAGCF is therefore to be informed by the S-CSCF that a new<br>
MAGCF is registered. The old MAGCF can be unsubscribed from these notifications, 1107.<br>
After receiving the message 1107, notifying of IMS subscription change, the old MAGCF<br>
removes the subscriber record. As a result of this procedure, the subscriber is now<br>
registered in the cellular system and in IMS by means of the new MAGCF.<br>
The signalling sequence describing this embodiment in respect to Fig. 12 is similar to the<br>
sequence for example in Fig. 7, the difference is that there is a new, an old MAGCF and an<br>
old MSC/VLR. Thus before performing the registration in IMS , MAP:Cancel Location to the<br>
old MSC/VLR is sent to de-register the user from the access in cellular system via the old<br>
MSC/VLR. Afterwards the registration procedure in IMS is performed, as described for<br>
example in respect to Fig.5. Finally the old MSGCF is informed by means of<br>
SIP:Notify(change of MAGCF address) about changes in user's status in IMS. Said message<br>
is acknowledged with 200OK to the S-CSCF and the consequence is that the old MAGCF is<br>
not anymore responsible for the user in the IMS system.<br>
In the above described embodiments the roaming has been discussed in details. However,<br>
on top of the procedures done when the subscriber actually roams, some procedures are<br>
triggered also for stationary subscribers. Those events are for example the Re-Registration,<br>
 <br>
De-Registration, 24.008 Location Update, 24.008 Periodic Location Update or 24.008 IMSI<br>
Detach procedures, which are in the following mentioned.<br>
The MAGCF has to initiate a SIP re-registration procedure towards the S-CSCF at expiry of<br>
the registration timer of the user agent. The registration is similar to the registration as<br>
aforementioned with the difference that the IMS sets the time intervals for a new re-<br>
registaration. In case the re-registration is not performed the user's registration is deleted.<br>
Preferably the MAGCF should check whether the UE has performed successful periodic<br>
location update recently.<br>
The MAGCF has to initiate a SIP de-registration procedure at reception of a 24.008 IMSI<br>
Detach from the UE. The procedure is equal to the registration, but expires value is set to 0.<br>
When receiving a 24.008 Location Update from the user equipment with a new Location<br>
Area Identifier LAI, this has to be stored in the VLR for the case of paging. This procedure is<br>
similar to the case of roaming within the service area of the MAGCF.<br>
Finally it is to be mentioned that the MAGCF has to initiate a SIP de-registration when a<br>
24.008 IMSI detach message is received informing that the user's terminal is switched off.<br>
The procedure is equal to the registration, but expires value is set to 0.<br>
The above-described embodiments are based on integration of cellular-switched controlled<br>
users equipment, like it is provided in GSM or GPRS, into IMS services developed in<br>
connection with UMTS. However, the present invention is not only restricted to these<br>
networks. A further example might be CDMA2000 providing corresponding nodes as the<br>
nodes existing in GPRS or UMTS.<br>

The present invention proposes a solution for providing IMS services to users having circuit-<br>
switched controlled terminals being not adapted to provide IMS services to the users. In<br>
particular, it is proposed, in order to allow IMS to take the full call and service control, to<br>
place a user agent being responsible for the user ported to the IMS in a new node type<br>
called Mobile Access Gateway Control Function (MAGCF). This new node combines the<br>
logical functionality of a cellular switching center and the logical functionality of IMS. Further<br>
it is proposed to enhance a user's register, like HLR, to provide also information about the<br>
availability of a MAGCF node and about whether a particular user is enabled to use the<br>
MAGCF functionality.</td>
