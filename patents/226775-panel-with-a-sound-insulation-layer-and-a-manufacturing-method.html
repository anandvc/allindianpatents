				<td>PANEL WITH A SOUND-INSULATION LAYER, AND A<br>
MANUFACTURING METHOD<br>
The invention relates to a method for applying to a flooring panel a layer<br>
designed to reduce the footfall sound on the floor, and a panel of this kind.<br>
In the context of flooring, panels in the form of laminated flooring or<br>
parquet flooring are already known. A laminated flooring panel consists of<br>
a so-called carrier board, which is generally manufactured from HDF, MDF<br>
or chipboard. A so-called decorative paper and another layer, which<br>
ensures adequate resistance to abrasion on the upper surface, are generally<br>
disposed above the carrier board. The decorative paper may, however,<br>
already be designed to be abrasion-resistant. A so-called counteracting<br>
paper is disposed beneath the carrier board.<br>
In particular, the papers are impregnated with aminoplastics, especially,<br>
with urea resins and/or melamine resins. Such resins will soften and harden<br>
again, if the papers are pressed with the carrier board in a press under the<br>
influence of temperature and pressure.<br>
The decorative paper ensures the desired visual appearance of the flooring<br>
formed from the panels. The counteracting paper is provided to ensure that<br>
the carrier board and/or the panel are not distorted during the pressing of<br>
the layers and/or papers.<br>
Parquet panels differ from laminate, in particular, with reference to their<br>
surface. The desired visual effect is achieved with wood instead of with a<br>
printed paper. A parquet floor is made of solid wood, but may also provide<br>
a carrier board made from HDF, MDF or chipboard. In this case, a wooden<br>
veneer or paper is then applied to the upper surface. A special wood or<br>
paper layer is applied to the underside as a counteracting layer.<br>
If the panels are laid on an under-floor, a relatively loud footfall sound<br>
occurs when the floor is walked over. To prevent the development of such<br>
sound, the prior art provides a so-called footfall-sound-insulation. This is a<br>
layer with sound-damping and/or sound-absorbing properties applied<br>
beneath a panel. Additionally, or as an alternative, the layer may bring<br>
about a shift in the frequency and amplitude of the sound produced, which<br>
is then subjectively perceived as less disturbing.<br>
The layer providing footfall insulation will be referred to in general below<br>
as the "sound-insulation layer".<br>
Sound-insulation layers are designed, in particular, as follows:<br>
The sound-insulation layer is generally resiliently deformable by contrast<br>
with the panel defined above. A layer of this kind may consist, for<br>
example, of recycled polyurethane material, rubber, cork, foam,<br>
thermoplastic materials, fibre matting or LDF (low density material). The<br>
density is generally around 200 to 1000 kg/m3. Alternatively, a so-called<br>
heavy foil can be used as a sound-insulation layer. This is characterised by<br>
a weight of 1000 to 5000 g/m2.<br>
A heavy foil glued to the laminate ensures good contact with the under-<br>
floor, which improves application to the surface disposed beneath thereby<br>
enhancing the perception of sound when walking on the floor. A typical<br>
heavy foil consists of polyethylene with fillers.<br>
With the prior art, it is disadvantageous that the sound-insulation layer is<br>
glued onto the laminate panel in a subsequent manufacturing stage.<br>
Accordingly, the panel is initially manufactured by pressing with the<br>
associated gluing of layers and/or papers. The sound-insulation layer is<br>
glued in place in a subsequent operational stage. PVA-glues, thermoplastics<br>
or wood glues may be used, for example, to attach the sound-insulation<br>
layer.<br>
Retrospective gluing and the associated additional operational stage not<br>
only makes the manufacturing process more expensive, but the edge seal is<br>
also relatively poor. If a sound-insulation layer is attached in a separate<br>
operational stage, it is hardly possible to achieve a successful flush edge<br>
seal. In general, therefore, there is a region beneath the panel, which is<br>
without a sound-insulation layer, because a flush seal is difficult to achieve<br>
in practice and is unlikely to be of good quality. Accordingly, the desired<br>
effect of the sound-insulation layer is impaired. Since this region is<br>
generally adjacent to the tongues and grooves of the panel, the mechanical<br>
stresses on these locking elements are particularly large when the floor is<br>
walked over. Moreover, there is a risk, that the sound-insulation layer can<br>
become detached from the panel during subsequent processing stages or<br>
during floor laying.<br>
Furthermore, a thermoplastic glue provides the disadvantage that it does<br>
not bond the sound-insulation layer particularly firmly to the panel, and the<br>
sound-insulation layer can easily become detached from the panel. This<br>
leads to in handling problems and disadvantages in production, for<br>
example, when the connecting elements are cut to size.<br>
If the sound-insulation layers are easily detached from the panel, this<br>
creates problems whenever the panels need to be shifted during laying,<br>
because the sound-insulation layer could become detached from the panel<br>
during laying. Providing a method and an associated panel, wherein the<br>
sound-insulation layer is connected to the panel in an improved manner,<br>
wherein the edge seals are improved and wherein production costs are more<br>
favourable, is a desirable objective.<br>
The adhesive matarials used may be associated wtlh environmental<br>
problems. For example, the adheoives may contain solvants, which<br>
pollute the environment. This leads to problems relating to the<br>
disposal of the adhsstvss. Moreover, the adhesive to an additonal<br>
component required in the production process. Avoiding the use of<br>
an addttlonal adhesive for attaching a sound-insulalton layer to a<br>
panel is therefore also desirable.<br>
The object of the Invention Is to pmrtda a coaHavourabia method<br>
together with an associated panel, which, by comparison with the<br>
prior art, provides improved properties in a footfall and room<br>
sound-insulation layer.<br>
The further object of the present invention is to propose an method<br>
for manufacturtng a sound insulator panel which help in recycling of<br>
polyuraethane and environment friendly.<br>
According to the invention, m the manufacture of a panel with a<br>
carrier board, decorative paper, counteracting paper an/or a wood<br>
veneer, an additional layer, preferably In the form of a sheet or a<br>
roll, is provided. The material of this roll or sheet product is<br>
designed to provide the desired sound-insultation properties as<br>
described above ond/or provides these properties when a panel is<br>
being walked over. The roll or sheet product to placed in a press<br>
and pressed together with the othtr components at a temperature<br>
of at least 100°C. Highar temperatures are preferably provided<br>
during pressing, in particular temperature above 120°C. The<br>
temperature ara3 typically above 200°C, but preferably 230°C to<br>
250°C, In order to achieve short pressing times. Short pressing<br>
times allow the panels to be manufactured more rapidly, ensuring<br>
that the method Is cost favourable.<br>
The sheet or roll product must be suitably temperature resistant. If<br>
pressing takes place at 200°C, the material, from which the sound-<br>
insulation layer is made, must be able to withstand the selected<br>
temperature.<br>
Selecting the appropriate materials in dependence upon a corresponding<br>
pressing temperature, in order to achieve a cost-favourable manufacturing<br>
process, can be left to a person skilled in the art.<br>
In the manufacture of a laminate panel, the counteracting paper is<br>
impregnated with an aminoplastic. During pressing, the aminoplastic<br>
material bonds the sound-insulation layer to the panel.<br>
The bond between the sound-insulation layer and the panel is considerably<br>
more stable by comparison with the prior art.<br>
The manufacturing process is also more cost favourable, because one<br>
operational stage has been omitted. Additional adhesives are not required,<br>
which also leads to cost advantages. Furthermore, the method is<br>
environmentally friendly, because adhesives, which must be additionally<br>
disposed of, are not required. Solvents present in the adhesives are also<br>
avoided.<br>
According to experience, after the manufacture of a large-format panel, the<br>
panels are sawn into panels of, for example, 1.40 m x 0.20 m, and the<br>
locking elements, such as tongues and grooves are milled into the panels. A<br>
flush edge seal is achieved between the panel and the sound-insulation<br>
layer, and accordingly, in this context, the disadvantages named above are<br>
avoided.<br>
Since the bond between the sound-insulation layer and the panel is very<br>
strong, the milling stage can be carried out without difficulty. With the<br>
prior art, this process presented difficulties, because the bond between the<br>
panel and the footfall sound-insulation layer was relatively unstable.<br>
If the sound-insulation layer is to be connected to a parquet panel, a short-<br>
cycle press is used for this process. To provide the aminoplastic, a paper<br>
can be placed between the lowest layer of the panel and the sound-<br>
insulation layer. In this case, the paper may be impregnated or otherwise<br>
provided with the aminoplastic.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a recycled polyurethane material is<br>
used, and the sound-insulation layer is formed from this material. The<br>
material is cost favourable and provides very good sound-insulation<br>
properties. It is obtained from the recycling industry and is therefore<br>
environmentally compatible.<br>
In this context, the sound-insulation layer should be at least 0.5 mm thick<br>
in order to achieve good sound-insulation properties, which are acceptable<br>
to the consumer. In practice, the layer made from recycled polyurethane<br>
material can be up to 5 mm thick. If the sound-insulation layer is very<br>
thick, noticeable disadvantages occur with reference to thermal<br>
conductivity. Good thermal conductivity is relevant if under-floor heating<br>
is to be installed or used. An excessively thick laminate floor is also<br>
undesirable, because of the associated large structural height after laying.<br>
This is disadvantageous to the consumer, for example, because doors may<br>
have to be adapted, as occurs routinely, particularly in the context of<br>
refurbishment.<br>
Melamine resin and/or urea resin and/or mixtures thereof are preferred as<br>
the aminoplastics. These are resins, which are typically used in decorative<br>
papers and counteracting papers. If these resins are used, no additional<br>
material components need to be provided for the manufacture of the<br>
product.<br>
The pressure applied in the press is typically between 5 and 70 kPa. The<br>
sound-insulation layer is generally compressed during this process. When<br>
using polyurethane (PUR), the layer is typically compressed, for example,<br>
from 1.2 mm to 0.5 mm. However, because of the conservation of mass, the<br>
sound-insulation properties are not significantly changed.<br>
Recycled polyurethane material, for example, with a density between 110<br>
kg/m3 and 750 kg/m3 may be used as a starting material.<br>
The product manufactured according to the invention differs from the prior<br>
art particularly in that the bond between a panel and the sound-insulation<br>
layer is achieved with an aminoplastic. In particular, the bond is achieved<br>
on the basis of aminoplastics, which are also used in the manufacture of a<br>
panel. This is advantageous because it avoids the use of additional<br>
materials.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, as an alternative to recycled<br>
polyurethane material, a material, from which a heavy foil is manufactured,<br>
may be used. Polyethylene with fillers is preferred in this context.<br>
Experiments have shown that the named materials, recycled polyurethane<br>
material and polyethylene with the fillers, achieve particularly good sound-<br>
insulation properties. Moreover, these materials can be processed without<br>
difficulty and attached to a laminate or parquet flooring panel.<br>
In manufacturing, products on a roll are used by preference, so that the<br>
panels can be pressed using double-band press. Otherwise a short-cycle<br>
press would have to be used, which would significantly increase<br>
manufacturing costs, because short pressing times cannot be realised.<br>
With the method according to the invention, a panel is manufactured, in<br>
which a layer is bonded beneath the panel using an aminoplastic. Because<br>
sawing and milling are carried out at a subsequent stage, the product is<br>
essentially characterised by its very good edge seal. Accordingly, no gap is<br>
left between the underside of the panel and the sound-insulation layer. This<br>
means that the flush edge seal is an additional essential feature of the<br>
product manufactured according to the method.<br>
The sound-insulation layer terminates flush with the panel, in particular, at<br>
the position where sawing or milling has been carried out. For example, the<br>
flush seal can also be provided with a groove, which has been milled into<br>
the underside of the panel, for example, for use in a non-glued connection<br>
between panels.<br>
A visible offset between the sound-insulation layer and the flooring panel<br>
does not therefore occur, unless it is created in another, subsequent<br>
operational stage.<br>
The selected materials, recycled polyurethane material and polyethylene<br>
with fillers, are heat-resistant, so that they can be pressed under the<br>
influence of heat. They are also particularly suitable for this reason.<br>
In the case of a laminate, the thickness of a panel is typically 5 to 14 mm.<br>
With parquet flooring panels, the thickness is typically approximately 10 to<br>
20 mm. The sound-insulation layer on the underside, which may be very<br>
thin, is added to this.<br>
The sound-insulation layer is preferably thinner than the panel, in<br>
particular, thinner than the carrier board.<br>
The invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the<br>
exemplary embodiment shown in the drawing.<br>
The drawing shows a cross-section of a laminate panel, which has been<br>
manufactured from a carrier board 1, a decorative paper 2, a counteracting<br>
paper 3 and an abrasion-resistant layer 4. The carrier board consists of<br>
MDF/HDF (but other materials are possible). This material is made from<br>
wood fibres, which are first provided with glue and then pressed in a press<br>
to form a board. The decorative paper 2 is first attached to the carrier board<br>
1, and the abrasion-resistant layer 4 is attached above this. The<br>
counteracting paper 3 is attached beneath the carrier board 1. The paper<br>
layers and the abrasion-resistant layer are initially provided with a mixture<br>
of a melamine resin and/or urea resin. Under the influence of heat and<br>
pressure, the resins are softened. A strong bond between the various layers<br>
is achieved through the subsequent hardening.<br>
By way of difference from the prior art, according to the present invention,<br>
a sound-insulation layer 5 was additionally pressed together with the other<br>
layers named above. The sound-insulation layer, in this case, consists of<br>
polyurethane (PUR). The initial layer thickness was 1.2 mm. As a result of<br>
compression of the various layers, this thickness is reduced to 0.5 mm. The<br>
sound-insulation layer 5 is bonded to the counteracting paper 3 by means of<br>
the resins used.<br>
After manufacturing the layered composite material, a groove 6 and a<br>
tongue 7 were milled into the sides of the panel. A groove 8 is provided in<br>
the underside of the panel (if required).<br>
As a result of the manufacturing method, the transition from the sound-<br>
insulation layer 5 to the panel is flush. This applies to the lateral limits of<br>
the panel and also to the transitions which occur relative to the groove 8.<br>
Metal plates, which connect two panels 1 together in the horizontal<br>
direction, can be inserted into the groove 8 of one panel and the<br>
corresponding groove 8 of another panel during floor laying. Accordingly,<br>
a groove 8 is allocated to each tongue and each groove. For reasons of<br>
clarity, only one groove 8 has been shown in the drawing. If the panel had<br>
been drawn in its entirety, another groove 8, allocated to the tongue 7,<br>
would be visible in mirror-image reversal.<br>
