				<td>The present invention relates to a turbine apparatus.<br>
Field of the Invention (Technical Field):<br>
The present invention relates generally to turbomachinery, particularly turbocharged internal combustion engines, and specifically relates to a turbine housing for improving the turbine efficiency characteristic.<br>
Background Art:<br>
It is known in the general art of internal combustion engines to provide some system of turbocharging, whereby a turbine harnesses energy from exhaust gases to power a compressor. The compressor is then used to increase engine performance, typically by boosting the pressure of air supplied to the engine.<br>
Nearly as important as engine performance is the need for cleaner exhausts. Most internal combustion engines are subject to regulations governing pollutant levels in engine emissions. "Stationary sources" such as internal combustion engine powered generators and the like, as well as motor vehicles, are required to maintain emissions of certain pollutants, such as CO and NO*, below legal limits. Pollution control, however, ideally is accomplished while compromising engine performance as little as possible.<br>
One mode of reducing the emissions of internal combustion engines ~ regardless of whether the engine is turbocharged. but frequently when it is — is through exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). EGR involves the return to the engine's intake manifold of some portion of the engine exhaust. Exhaust gases are diverted<br>
from the exhaust manifold through a duct or conduit for delivery to the intake manifold, thereby allowing exhaust to be introduced to the combustion cycle, so that oxygen content is reduced, which in turn reduces the high combustion temperature that contributes to excessive NOx formation.<br>
With the introduction of EGR systems ont for example, heavy-duty diesel engines, the desired turbine efficiency characteristic does not conform to conventional turbomachinery performance. Simply accepting classical turbomachincry turbine efficiency characteristic when using applicants' VNT™ brand of variable nozzle turbine turbocharger EGR System causes several effects, including: (I) Unacceptabiy high fuel consumption at certain engine operating speeds; (2) Unacceptably high turbocharger speed (i.e., turbocharger speeds which exceed acceptable limits using known production materials and processes); and (3) An inability to drive the EGR at all desires engine operating points.<br>
Further, with the use of EGR systems in use on a heavy-duty diesel engine, the turbocharger "match" to the engine results in unusual turbocharger turbine wheel matching. In some instances, for example, the traditional or conventional wheel contour is removed from the design. This unusual machining of the turbine wheel may result in an increased difficulty in retaining the turbine wheel in the event the turbine wheel separates from the turbocharger shaft. In such an event, the turbine wheel will exit the turbine housing gas outlet at a substantially higher velocity and energy than in a similar circumstance with current turbocharger assembly designs.<br>
Against the foregoing background, the present invention was developed. The turbine housing is modified to retain the wheel and to tailor the turbocharger turbine efficiency, thus addressing the deficiencies noted above. The scope of applicability of the present invention will be set forth in part in the detailed<br>
description to follow, taken irt conjunction with the accompanying drawings, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following, or may be learned fey practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.<br>

Fig. 9 is a graph depicting relative impact of sizing of a fixed configuration tailored diameter, according to the present invention, with respect to a fixed trim diameter in terms of turbine pressure ratio and turbine efficiency.<br><br>
The present invention relates to turbines, particularly but not necessarily turbines used in turbocharged engines. The apparatus of the invention may find beneficial use in connection with Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) systems used with dieseJ-fueled power plants, including but not limited to the engines of large motor vehicles. By modifying according to this invention the turbine wheel retainment design, the turbine efficiency characteristic can be tailored to meet specialized needs, and turbine wheel retention is promoted. Accordingly, the present invention ameliorates wheel retention and turbine efficiency characteristic problems attributable to the us|e of EGR systems in conjunction with turbines. The problems are addressed with inventive modification of the turbine housing. The present invention, as further characterized and disclosed hereafter, includes such modifications.<br>
As known in the art. a turbine work is directly proportional to turbine efficiency, mass flow, ratio of pressure across the turbine and inlet temperature. Shaft, or rotor speed is the product of turbine work applied to a directly driven compressor. VNT turbine rotor speed can be altered by tailoring the turbine's efficiency at the turbine wheel exit via the exit configuration shape and size. The impact of the change in efficiency is used to match compressor and VNT characteristics to meet engine ;»r system requirements. The sizing of the exit feature may be limited by resulting engine performance parameters in addition to turbomachincry speed control, i.e., fuel consumption or possibly engine pressure ratios.<br>
By defining a shaped and sized step-bore in the turbine housing, at the turbine wheel exit, the turbine efficiency characteristic can be selectively tailored<br>
to improve turbine efficiency behavior, thereby enhancing VNT turbocharger EGR systems performance   Succinctly stated, the provision of a step-bore reduces the turbine efficiency, resulting in a favorable increase in turbine inlet pressure. The increased inlet pressure promotes the ilow of exhaust gas from the engine's exhaust manifold into the engine's intake manifold. This beneficial turbocharger behavior is accomplished, according to the invention, at a reduced turbocharger speed than would be attainable with a typical turbomachinery turbine efficiency characteristic. Despite the comparatively reduced turbocharger speed, performance is not compromised; so the inventive apparatus may be fashioned from currently existing production materials, and known processes for VNT turbocharger systems are applicable. Furthermore, lowered turbine efficiency provides the capacity to drive 4 larger quantity of EGR flow into the engine intake manifold than would be possible with conventional turbine housing designs.<br>
Attention is invited to Fig. I, showing one embodiment of the apparatus of the invention. The turbine 10 features a turbine housing 12 that is manufactured gcnerjlly in accordance with the known an, except as further explained hereinafter. The lurbtnc housing 12 .substantially surrounds and defines a turbine bore 14 for receiving a turbine wheel (mil shown in Fig. 1) rotatable upon a turbine .shall according generally to convention   In one possible embodiment, the inlet side of the housing 12 may be provided with a port 16 permitting the placement of the turbine wheel into the bore 14 during turbine assembly. ABer the installation of the turbtne wheeli. the port 16 is closed and secured by. for example, the bolted attachment of a turbocharger center housing rotating assembly (not shown).<br>
With continued reference to Fig. !, it is noted that the turbine housing 12 features and defines a turbine tip diameter Drip that ordinarily corresponds approximately to the maximum tip diameter of the turbine wheel, according with<br>
known art. Also defined is the turbine housing trim diameter DTRIM which varies among different turbine housing models, but corresponds generally to a functional diameter of the turbine wheel, there being a very close clearance between the circumference of the wheel and the housing trim wall 17 defining the trim diameter DTRIM   In some embodiments of the present invention, the turbine tip diameter DTIP may be only slightly larger than the trim diameter DTRIM.<br>
"Downstream" within the bore 12 is the turbine diffuser or exducer 1.8, a conduit via which gas is exhausted from the turbine assembly. The diameter Dex is important in making an appropriate mechanical joint for the coupling and size required for the exhaust system. Notably, the invention has practical use in turbines employing generally Cylindrical exducers, such as depicted in Figs. 1,4, 5,6, and 8, as well as turbines having flared or conical exducers, such as those seen in Figs. 3 and 7.<br>
Implementation of turbine efficiency tailoring is accomplished by, among other things, affecting the gas flow into and through the exducer 18. Referring to Fig. 1, this may be achieved by the provision of a "step" in the bore 14, whereby the diameter of the exducer 18 is abruptly reduced for an abbreviated portion of its axial length. For example, in the embodiment of Fig. 1, there is provided a separately produced step bore ring 20 that is insenabic through the exducer 18 and into the bore 14. As seen in Figs. 2A and 2B, the step bore ring 20 is a rigid annul us having an exterior diartneter substantially equal to the exducer diameter DEx so as to be snuggiy received into the throat of the exducer 18, concentrically about the axis of the bore 14, as seen in Fig. I. The step bore ring 20 may be there fixed in position by threaded bolts 21 or other suitable fastening means or integrated into the casting of the turbine housing.<br>
Notably, the step bore ring 20 defines an aperture 22 therein, preferably concentric with the ring's outer circumference, having a selected tailored diameter d (Figs 2A and 2B). Tailored diameter d is preferably and nearly always less than the cxducer diameter DEX, and is smaller than the turbine housing trim diameter DTIM- The step defined m the bore 14 by the step bore ring 20 thus is configured so that the normal smooth flow of the gas exiting the turbine wheel is disturbed, by constricted passage through the aperture 22 of the nng 20, near the turbine wheel exit. The tailored diameter d is between about 80 percent and 100 percent of the DTRIM  The precise ratio between d and DTRIM is selected and determined to obtain the desired tailoring. The ratio between the tailored diameter d and the housing trim diameter DTRIM affects the turbine efficiency characteristic. The performance tailoring of the turbine stage is associated with the impact of the downstream orifice tailored diameter d on DTRIM (in Fig. 1, for example)<br>
The "step bore" resulting from the aperture 22 can be tailored such that the turbine efficiency can be matched to provide a similar efficiency characteristic to that which is desirable for VNT  brand turbocharger EGR systems<br>
Fig. 9 is a graph showing relative impact of sizing of a fixed configuration d diameter with respect to a fixed tnm diameter in terms of turbine pressure ratio and turbine efficiency. Modulating turbine efficiency via fixed d diameter sizing for a VNT turbine stage is a means by which lurbomachincry speed can be modified or matched to meet a specific set of engine conditions. The efficiency impact of the orifice diameter varies with size and operating pressure ratio. Performance characteristics of various configuration d diameter shapes will be variable based on the basic shape of the orifice.<br>
Reference is made to pig. 3, illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention. The embodiment of Fig. 3 is very similar in many respects to the embodiment of Fig. I, except that the step bore ring 24 is cast in place integrally with the housing 12. A turbine wheel 30 is shown mounted in the turbine bore 14. In this "fixed geometry" embodiment of the invention, a ring 24 cast integrally with the housing 12 provides |the step 25 in the bore. The ring 24 thus is a permanent extension of the cast housing, and is integrally associated therewith at the time of housing manufacture. This cast feature is generally annular, but molded within the housing bore 14 as shown in the figure. The circular aperture in cast ring 24 defines the tailored diameter d. It is noted in Fig. 3 that the exduccr 18 is not cylindrical, but is a conical diffuser with an ever-increasing exducer diameter proceeding toward the turbine exhaust. The addition of the conical diffuser assists in fine-tuning the tailoring of the turbine performance.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 3, the bore step feature is provided by the ring 24 preferably cast integrally with the housing 12. Alternatively, the retainer ring 24 may be manufactured separately, and then inserted into and secured within the turbine bore 14. as suggested by Figs I. 2A and2B, and 4. The bore step 25 is defined by the edge of the aperture in the nng 24. which aperture has diameter d. The diameter d is the tailored diameter selected for turbine efficiency, and in any event is less than the trim diameter DTRIM   The turbine gases, of course, flow through the aperture in the ring 24, but the aperture is too small to admit passage of the turbine wheel 30.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates how an inscrtable retainer ring 24, similar to the embodiment seen in Fig. 4, may offer apparatus adaptability. An intertable ring 24 may be disposed within the turbine bore and secured at one or more different axial locations. Fig. 5 shows the retainer ring 24 secured (for example with bolts directed radially through the ring and into the housing) at an axially<br>
forward position. However, since the retainer ring 24 is removably insertablc, its axial position also is selectively adjustable. As suggested by the phantom lines in Fig. 5, the retainer ring can be disengaged from an axially forward position, slipped to any second, rearward, location, and there again temporarily fixed in place. This adjustment, which nlay be incrementally or infinitely variable depending upon the mode of collecting the ring 24 to the housing, permits the retainment and tailoring features of a single turbine apparatus 10 to be customized to particular uses. By this adjustability of the ring location, the axtal position, and effect, of the reduced tailored diameter d defined by the ring can be regulated and selected for optimum turbine efficiency. The location of the retainer step 25 likewise is adjustable (c.g., to accommodate a turbine wheel 30 of different axial length).<br>
The axial movement of the ring may be guided by two or more circumfercntially arrayed longitudinal guides 29, 29', which may be integral extensions of the housing 12 protruding from the turbine bore walls. Guides 29.29* also prevent radial shifting of the ring 24 about the central axis of the apparatus. Removably insertablc retainer rings 24 can be removed and reinstalled for maintenance or replacement.<br>
Still another alternative embodiment of the invention is shown in Figs. 6 and 6A   Retainer and tailoring advantages are provided by a plurality of profiled protrusions 33.33* cast integrally with the housing 12. The profiled protrusions could be variably rotated about ah axis resulting in a variable tailoring of the turbine efficiency. The radial array of convex protrusions 33.33' extend radially inward into the throat of the bore 14, and preferably are uniformly spaced around the bore's circumferential perimeter, as seen in Fig. 6A. As indicated in the figures, especially Fig. 6A, effective tailored diameter d is defined approximately by the average "height" of diametrically opposite protrusions. The<br>
protrusions 33, 33' may have any of a variety of profiles or shapes. One preferred profile is depicted in Figs. 6 and 6A, where each protrusion has a somewhat oval or "tear drop" footprint and an airfoil axial profile. Any of wide variety of shapes and profiles are suitable to the function of the invention, although smooth, aerodynamic profiles such as  those seen in the figures are preferred.<br>
Alternatively, the protrusions 33,33' may be more rectilinear or vane-like in form than those shown. Figs. 7 and 7A depict an alternative embodiment with a plurality of uniformly spaced rectilinear protrusions 33,33* (eight protrusions in the embodiment of Figs. 7 and 7A.) As seen in the figures, the protrusions may have, for example, a low axial sprofile, each protrusion 33 featuring a quadrilateral axial section with a leading "face" perpendicular to the turbine axis, and a trailing face defined by an acute angle that allows the trailing face to merge smoothly into the inside wall of the exducer 18. Again, the effective tailored diameter d is determined using the approximate average radial extension of the protrusions.<br>
In any embodiment featuring an arrayed plurality of protrusions 33,33 the longitudinal axes of the protrusions, while preferably being mutually parallel, may be canted or angled in relation to the axis of the turbine, lo foster "de-swirling" of the exhaust gas as it exits the turbine wheel 30. The number of protrusions 33,33* also is selectable, and may number, for example, between three and eight (eight m the embodiments of Figs- 6 and 7).<br>
Yet another embodiment of the invention is shown in Figs. 8 and 8A. This embodiment of the invention permits the use of an adjustable bore step within a conical, as opposed to cylindrical, cxduccr. In this embodiment, a segmented ring 27 has a variable diameter, so as to expand or contract according to need corresponding to the oblique annular face of the conical exducer 18. The ring<br>
segments 31,31' can vary in number, the plurality numbering at least three (four shown in Figs 8 and 8A) and up, for example, eight oi ten.<br>
The embodiment of Figs, 8 and 8A thus shares some of the features and advantages of the embodiments seen in Fig. 5, except that in addition to being selectively adjustable in axial position within the housing 12, the effective diameter of the step ring 27 can be adjusted, as can the effective tailored diameter d defined by the aperture in the ring 27. To increase the tailored diameter d, the uniformly spaced segments 31,31' are shifted radially outward, thus increasing the size of circumferential gaps that separate adjacent segments. Likewise, when the ring 27 is moved to a forward position in the exducer, the diameter d is reduced by reducing the gaps between adjacent segments of the ring 27.<br>
The ring segments 31.31' manifest wedge-shaped longitudinal profiles, as seen in Fig. 8A, and thus can shift simultaneously axially and radially by riding along the annular chamfer 35 in the bore. The ring segments are arrayed so as to always define a segmented annulus, and secured at one or more different axial locations   Fig. 8 shows the segments of the retainer nng 27 secured (for example with bolts directed radially through the nng and info the housing at an axially forward position. However. since the retainer ring 27 is movably insert able, its axial position also is selectively adjustable. As suggested by the phantom lines in Fig 8 A. the retainer ring 27 can be disengaged from an axially forward position, slipped to any second, rearward, location, and there again temporarily fixed in place. Due to the changed diameter of the exducer 18 in which the nng 27 is disposed, the ring 27 tailored diameter d likewise is modified. This adjustment permits the retainmcnt and tailoring features of a single turbine apparatus 10 to be customized to particular uses. By this adjustability of the ring location, the axial position and size, and effect, of the reduced tailored diameter d defined by the ring<br>
can be regulated and selected for optimum turbine efficiency. The location of the retainer step 25 likewise is adjustable (e.g., to accommodate a turbine wheel 30 of different axial length).<br>
As with the embodiment of Fig. 5, the axial movement of the ring 27 may be guided by two or more circumferentially arrayed longitudinal guides (not shown in Fig. 8) which may be integral extensions of the housing 12 protruding from the turbine bore walls.<br>
The apparatus of the invention provides, therefore, a step bore 25 in all embodiments that serves to retain the turbine wheel 30 against improper displacement toward the rear of the turbine housing 12. The retainer, typically an annular ring with or without customized protrusions, permits a tailored diameter d in relation to the trimdiameter TTRIM to optimize the turbine efficiency characteristic.<br>
By designing, shaping and sizing a "step bore" in the turbine housing, near the turbine wheel exit, the turbine efficiency characteristic can be modified or tailored, resulting in a turbine efficiency behavior which is more favorable to the performance of the variable nozzle turbine turbocharger ECR system according to the present invention. In effect, the step bore 25 reduces the turbine efficiency, which results in an increased turbine inlet pressure, which promotes the flow of exhaust gas from the engine's exhaust manifold into the engine intake manifold. This behavior is accomplished at a lower turbocharger speed than would be achievable with an ordinary turbomachincry turbine efficiency characteristic.<br>
Although the invention has been described m detail with particular reference to these preferred embodiments, other embodiments can achieve the same results. Variations and modifications of the present invention will be<br>
obvious to those skilled in the art and it is intended to cover in the appended claims all such modifications and equivalents. The entire disclosures of all references, applications, patents, and publications cited above are hereby incorporated by reference.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
