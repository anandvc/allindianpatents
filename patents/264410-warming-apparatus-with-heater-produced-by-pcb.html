				<td>TITLE WARMING APPARATUS WITH HEATER PRODUCED BY PCB<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a heating apparatus comprising a printed circuit board type ("PCB-type") heater and more particularly, to a heating apparatus having a PCB-type heater capable of allowing the temperature of Ringer's solution or blood which is introduced into a blood vessel, when transfusing a blood thereto, to be equal to that of the human body using the PCB-type so as to provide an accurate resistance value.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Typically, a method of dosing a patient with a chemical material which is useful to him/her includes taking medicine and injecting it. A method of injecting medicine into the patient includes a hypodermic injection, an intra-muscular injection, intravenous injection and so on. Among them, the intravenous injection is applied when injecting into a blood vessel for a long time. For example, the intravenous injection is used when supporting a blood or giving an injection of Ringer's solution to a patient and generally uses an intravenous drip set.<br>
The Ringers solution is usually kept at a low temperature in order to prevent from being decomposed or producing an alien substance, and a blood and the like are usually kept in cold environment in order to prevent any noxious eutrophication of an organic matter prior to giving a blood transfusion to patient. Generally, the temperature of Ringer's solution and blood is in a circumstance of 20Â°C or less when injecting to a human body. Accordingly, when Ringer's solution or blood is injected to a human body, the<br>
temperature thereof also rises since the temperature of human body is generally 37D. In this case, the energy that the temperature of Ringer's solution or blood is required to rise to human body is supplied by the patient's risen metabolic rate. Since this thermal load is never feeble compared to the normal metabolic rate, it drops human body's temperature and excites a cooling point of skin. As a result, under such a situation, any injection of Ringer's solution or giving of a blood transfusion to patient may cause a cold pain to the patient and even make the lives of the patient very dangerous.<br>
In order to solve such problems, a Korean Patent No. 130926 discloses a method and apparatus for medicine for allowing the temperature of Ringer's solution or blood to be equal to that of human body prior to injecting Ringer's solution or blood to the patient.<br>
According to the above Patent No. 130926, a tube is fixed to the upper portion .of a panel in order to adjust the temperature of Ringer's solution and a first cover is placed on the upper portion of the panel. The first cover is fixed to a vertical member by means of a hinge, and a locking device is installed on a horizontal member opposed to the vertical member having the hinge attached thereto. The first cover is attached with a second cover having a built-in insulation on the upper portion thereof. Therefore, the tube is built-in within a rectangular-shape barrel as a whole and is heated by a heating means within a rectangular barrel.<br>
Since the tube within the rectangular-shape barrel is short in the length thereof, a heating apparatus for medicine which should heat at a low temperature of 41.5D or less is substantially difficult to rise the short tube in length to a desired temperature and control a desired temperature. Further, when using a high-temperature heating apparatus which would cause<br>
harmful effects, a very fine electronic control system for controlling the high-<br>
temperature heating apparatus should be applied, resulting in the complexity of the heating apparatus, and a high cost of production thereof.<br>
Also, a heating apparatus using a conventional Ni-Cr heating resistor is designed to wind a surface of a circular-shaped heating resistor with a tube such as Ringer's solution, cover the surface with a lid and then lock by means of a locking device. However, this structure has a troublesome and complexity since the heating resistor should be wound with the tube whenever using it. Further, the use of Ni-Cr heating resistor causes the size of the heating apparatus to be large and the weight reaches more than 20Kg, resulting in a very heavy expense of the heating apparatus.<br>

BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention will now be described in detail in connection with preferred embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
(Example 1)<br>
Fig. 1 shows a separate prospective view illustrating a heating apparatus having a PCT-type heater in accordance with the present invention. As shown in Fig. 1, the heating apparatus comprises a body 110 including a first connecting portion 113 having a tube which is connected to the first connection portion 113 and receives a fluid supplied from an instillation room, a path 112 having the shape of a spiral screw thread to allow the fluid to flow and a second connecting portion 114 for supplying the fluid flowing through the path 112 to an injection syringe; an inner cover 115 inserted into the body 110 and fixedly attached thereto in a ultrasonic, high-frequency, or adhesive manner for preventing the fluid from flowing out; middle covers 130a, 130b for closely fixing the body 110 and the inner cover 115 against each other; a PCB-type heater 100 inserted into the inside of the top surface 130a and bottom surface 130b of the middle cover for heating the fluid flowing through the path 112 so that the fluid is maintained at a prescribed temperature; a bottom case 1 50 having a box portion 151 to receive the body 110 having the heater 100 and the middle cover 130a, 130b coupled thereto; and a upper case 140 coupled to the bottom case 150.<br>
The body 110 and the middle covers 130a, 130b are made of different materials. For example, the material of the body 110 is ABC and the material of the middle covers 130a, 130b is PE. The body 110 and the middle covers 130a, 130b are combined each other in a ultrasonic adhesive manner.<br>
As as other adhesive manner, the middle covers 130a, 130b can be adhesively coupled to the body 110 by pressing a PE tube having a good contraction against the body 110 and combining the middle covers 130a, 130b.<br>
Herein, one top side of the upper case 140 comprises a power supply button 210 for supplying or breaking a power to the heater 100 in accordance with a user's operation; an operation display 710 for displaying whether or not the heater is normally operating; an alarm device 720 for alarming when the heater is operating in error; a temperature indicator 900 for indicating the heating temperature of the heaterlOO; and a temperature setting button 220 for adjusting the heating temperature of the heater in accordance with a user's operation. If a left side of the button 220 is pushed, the setting temperature drops and if a right side of the button 220 is pushed, the setting temperature rises.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the PCB-type heater (100) is formed of an insulating substrate 10; a heating resistor 20 being formed on the upper portion of the insulating substrate by a circuit pattern designed to have a uniform resistance value and generating a heat corresponding to a heat capacity which was re-designed in accordance with the power being supplied; a power supply terminal. 30 for supplying a power to the heating resistor 20; a coupling terminal 40 of a temperature sensor mounter 31 mounted thereon with a temperature sensor which measures the temperature of the fluid flowing through the body 110; a sensor connecting terminal 60 being connected to the coupling terminal 40 for reading the measured temperature from the outside; and an insulating protection film 70 for protecting the heating resistor 20.<br>
The sensor mounter 41 is fixedly coupled to the coupling terminal 40, and a sensor 42 is mounted on the sensor mounter 41 and coupled thereto.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the heater 100 is formed of a plurality of heaters 100a to 100c which are connected in parallel and receive in common a DC power supply. Heating temperature of the heaters 10Oa to 11 c is sensed by<br>
sensors 100a to 100c which are connected to the heaters 100a to 100c, respectively. Therefore, when it is required to turn on or off any one of heaters, a control section (not shown in Fig. 3, but shown in Fig. 13) controls switching devices (not shown in Fig. 3) connected to respective heaters 100a to 10Oc and thus control operations of the heaters by breaking or supplying a DC power to the heaters 100a to 100c. The switching devices may correspond to a safe protection circuit portion in Fig. 13. A reference numeral 3a indicates sensor common line, and reference numerals 3b-3d indicate sensing electrodes being connected to sensors 2a, 2b, respectively. A reference numeral 4a indicates a common line (DC negative electrode) as a power supply terminal, and a reference numerals 4b to 4d indicate DC positive electrodes which are connected to the respective heaters.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, the heater 100 further comprises a control circuit formed on the bottom portion of the insulating substrate for controlling the degree of heating of the heater.<br>
Now, the function of the control circuit is explained in detail.<br>
As shown in Fig. 13, the control circuit comprises a power supply portion for supplying a power to the heater 100; a temperature sensor 210 for sensing a heating temperature of the heater 100 and a fluid temperature flowing through the path 112; a power supply button 210 for outputting a power requesting signal in accordance with a user's operation; a operating portion 200 composed of a plurality of buttons such as a temperature setting button 220 for setting the heating temperature; a control portion 400 for allowing a power from the power supply 500 to be supplied to the heater 100 in response to the power requesting signal inputted by the power supply button 210 of the operating portion 200, for controlling the power supplied<br>
from the power supply 500 to be interrupted by comparing the setting<br>
temperature set by the temperature setting button 220 with the temperature inputted by the temperature sensor 300, lighting the operating display 710 if the power supply button 210 is turned on, and lighting the alarming portion 720 if the heating temperature of the heater 100 is high than a reference temperature; and for controlling the overall system to allow the alarming signal to be transmitted through the alarm generating portion 8OO; a safe protection circuit portion 600 for supplying or interrupting a power to the heater 100 in response to the control portion 400; and a temperature indicating portion 900 for indicating the set heating temperature of the heater 100 in response to a control signal from the control portion 400.<br>
That is, the control portion 400 controls the power supplied to the heater 100 so that the fluid can maintain a suitable temperature by measuring the heating temperature of the heater 100 as well as the fluid temperature heated by the heater 100 at a uniform temperature.<br>
The operating display 710 is a green-colour light emitting device, the alarming portion is a red-colour light emitting device, which are referred to as light-emitting portion 700 collectively. This configuration may be varied if required. The alarm generating portion 800 may be a buzzer.<br>
Instead of the temperature sensor 42 and heater in Fig. 2, as shown in Fig. 5, heating resistors 20, 22 may be formed by coating the one side of the insulating substrate 10 with different materials having large thermoelectric power in order to heat or form a thermocouple in accordance with the power being supplied by allowing the heating resistors to act as a heater if the power is supplied thereto and to act a temperature sensor using the formed thermocouple if power is interrupted. The heating resistor 20, 22 made of two materials is coupled each other by a via hole 35. the components for<br>
supplying or interrupting the power to the heating resistors 20, 22 are the<br>
safe protection circuit portion 600 and the control circuit portion 400 in Fig. 12.<br>
Instead of Fig. 5, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7, heating resistor 20, 22 are formed by coating the respective upper portion 11 and bottom portion 12 of the insulating substrate with different materials having a large thermoelectric power in order to heat or form a thermocouple in accordance with the power being supplied by allowing the heating resistors to act as a heater if the power is supplied thereto and to act a temperature sensor using the formed thermocouple if power is interrupted. The heating resistor 20, 22 made of two materials are coupled each other by a via hole 35.<br>

Referring to FIG. 15, a heating apparatus includes a body 110 having a PCB-type heater 100 inserted thereinto, a tube 160 wound around the upper portion of the body 110 for moving a prescribed fluid and maintaining the fluid at an uniform temperature, and rigid middle covers 130a, 130b coupled to the body 100 to allow the tube 160 to be fixedly attached to the body 110.<br>
The remaining construction of this embodiment is the same as those of the first embodiment. Thus, description on them will be omitted for simplicity.<br>
Hereinafter, the operation of the heating apparatus having the PCB-type heater will be described.<br>
According to the connection method shown in FIG. 1 or 12, if the tube connected to the instillation room is coupled to the first connection portion 113 of the heating apparatus, the tube connected to the injection syringe is coupled to the second connection portion 114, a user turns on the<br>
power supply button 210 and a temperature is set by a temperatures setting button 220, a control circuit 400 shown in FIG. 13 controls a safety protection circuit 600 to supply the power of the power supply unit 500 to the heater 100. In this time, the control circuit 400 controls an operational display 710 to be lighted. Therefore, the user can know that the heating apparatus operates normally through the operational display 710.<br>
Furthermore, the control circuit 400 continues to check a heating temperature of the heater 100 through the temperature sensor 300. It determines whether the temperature checked by the temperature sensor 300 is coincident with the temperature set by the user. If it is determined that the temperature checked by the temperature sensor 300 is coincident with or less than the temperature set by the user, the control circuit 400 controls the safety protection circuit 600 to supply the power to the heater 100 and then checks the heating temperature of the heater 100 through the temperature sensor 300. Meanwhile, if it is determined that the temperature checked by the temperature sensor 300 is higher than the temperature set by the user, the control circuit 400 controls the safety protection circuit 600 to shut the power supplied to the heater 100.<br>
Meanwhile, if it is determined that the temperature of the heater 100 sensed through the temperature sensor 300 is higher than the heating temperature set as a reference, the control circuit 400 controls an alarm display unit 720 to be lighted, while controlling the safety protection circuit 600 to shut the power supplied to the heater 100. Also, the control circuit 400 controls an alarm device 800 to generate an alarm signal. Thus, the user can know that the heating apparatus operates erroneously from the alarm signal.<br>
