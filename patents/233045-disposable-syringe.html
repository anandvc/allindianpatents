				<td>DISPOSABLE SYRINGE<br>
This invention relates to a disposable syringe, more<br>
particularly to a disposable syringe which enables a needle unit<br>
to be retracted within a barrel after use for safe disposal.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, a conventional disposable syringe<br>
assembly 10 is shown to include a barrel 11, a plunger 12 and<br>
a needle unit 13. The barrel 11 has an open neck end portion<br>
111 to which a needle hub 131 of the needle unit 13 is attached,<br>
and an open rear end from which the plunger 12 is slidably<br>
inserted into the barrel 11. A forward end 121 of the plunger<br>
12 is snugly fitted in, but is nevertheless slidable along the<br>
inner surface of the barrel 11 through a distance (L) . The needle<br>
unit 13 further has a needle 132 extending from the needle hub<br>
131, and a cap 133 with an open end which is fitted around an<br>
outer edge of the needle hub 131, with the needle 132 enclosed<br>
within the cap 133. The cap 133 is removed from the needle hub<br>
131 when the syringe assembly 10 is to be used, and is sleeved<br>
back after use to ensure that the needle 132 is covered.<br>
Thereafter, the needle unit 13 is detached from the barrel 11<br>
along with the cap 133 covering the needle 132.<br>
However, the medical or nursing personnel who has to handle<br>
the conventional disposable syringe assembly 10, is exposed to<br>
the risk of being pricked by the needle 132 when sleeving the<br>
cap 133 back on the needle hub 131 after using the disposable<br>
syringe assembly 10 since the dimension of the open end of the<br>
cap 133 is relatively small. Moreover, as forward movement of<br>
the forward end 121 of the plunger 12 terminates at the point<br>
(P1), some medicine or blood may remain within the neck end<br>
portion 111, which can cause contamination to the personnel who<br>
is unfortunately pricked by the needle 132.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
disposable syringe which provides greater safety in use and<br>
which eliminates the aforesaid drawback of the prior art.<br>
According to this invention, the disposable syringe includes<br>
a barrel having an inner surrounding barrel wall surface which<br>
surrounds an axis and which confines a passage. The passage has<br>
lower and upper open ends disposed opposite to each other in<br>
a longitudinal direction parallel to the axis. The inner<br>
surrounding barrel wall surface includes a larger-diameter<br>
segment and a smaller-diameter segment which are disposed<br>
proximate to the lower and upper open ends, respectively, and<br>
which cooperatively form a surrounding shoulder portion<br>
therebetween.<br>
A tubular needle seat is insertable into the passage from<br>
the lower open end toward the upper open end, and includes a<br>
lower surrounding edge portion disposed to abut against the<br>
first surrounding shoulder portion, an upper surrounding edge<br>
portion disposed opposite to the lower surrounding edge portion<br>
in the longitudinal direction, and a surrounding seat wall<br>
interposed therebetween. The surrounding seat wall has an inner<br>
tubular wall surface which surrounds the axis to confine a duct<br>
and which forms a grip segment, and an outer tubular wall surface.<br>
The outer tubular wall surface includes a lower segment<br>
proximate to the lower surrounding edge portion, and an upper<br>
segment disposed opposite to the lower segment and proximate<br>
to the upper surrounding edge portion. When the upper<br>
surrounding edge portion is forced to extend toward the upper<br>
open end after the tubular needle seat is inserted into the<br>
passage, the lower segment will be brought to a position of use,<br>
where the lower segment engages and is retained at the<br>
smaller-diameter segment by virtue of a first friction force<br>
generated therebetween while the lower surrounding edge portion<br>
abuts against the surrounding shoulder portion. In addition,<br>
when the upper surrounding edge portion is moved against the<br>
first friction force toward the lower open end passing the<br>
larger-diameter segment, the needle seat will be brought to a<br>
retracted position, where the lower segment and the lower<br>
surrounding edge portion are remote from the smaller-diameter<br>
segment and the first surrounding shoulder portion,<br>
respectively. The outer tubular wall surface is adapted to be<br>
fitted with a needle unit.<br>
A plunger includes a stem portion which is disposed to be<br>
movable in the passage and which has inner and outer segments<br>
opposite to each other in the longitudinal direction. The outer<br>
segment extends outwardly of the lower open end of the passage.<br>
An actuated end extends from the outer segment so as to be<br>
actuated to move the stem portion along the passage. A<br>
surrounding engaging portion is retainingly sleeved on the inner<br>
segment by virtue of a second friction force, and is in sealing<br>
contact with and is slidable relative to the larger-diameter<br>
segment so as to be moved with the stem portion to the position<br>
of use. A head extends from the inner segment toward the grip<br>
segment. When the surrounding engaging portion is brought by<br>
the inner segment to engage the lower surrounding edge portion<br>
and is depressed by the lower surrounding edge portion by virtue<br>
of a third force that is generated as a consequence of continuing<br>
movement of the inner segment towards the smaller-diameter<br>
segment and that third force is greater than the second friction<br>
force, the surrounding engaging portion is retained by the lower<br>
surrounding edge portion to thereby permit the head to move<br>
towards the grip segment of the tubular needle seat and to be<br>
held by virtue of a fourth friction force that is greater than<br>
the first friction force.<br>

Before the present invention is described in greater detail,<br>
it should be noted that same reference numerals have been used<br>
to denote like elements throughout the specification.<br>
Referring to Figs. 2, 3 and 4, the first preferred embodiment<br>
of the disposable syringe according to the present invention<br>
is shown to be used with a needle unit 40 to form a syringe<br>
assembly. The needle unit 40 includes a needle hub 42 and a needle<br>
41 which is securely affixed to the needle hub 42. The needle<br>
hub 42 has a sleeved portion 423 with a plurality of<br>
longitudinally extending frictional ribs 421 formed thereon.<br>
A tip protector 43 has an internal sleeve end 431 which is<br>
configured to be sleeved on the sleeved portion 423 for shielding<br>
the needle 41 and which has a plurality of longitudinally<br>
extending frictional ribs 433 for engaging the frictional ribs<br>
421.<br>
The syringe in this embodiment is shown to comprise a barrel<br>
20, a tubular needle seat 30, and a plunger 50.<br>
The barrel 20 has an inner surrounding barrel wall surface<br>
221 which surrounds an axis (X) and which confines a passage<br>
21. The passage 21 has lower and upper open ends 211,212 which<br>
are disposed opposite to each other in a longitudinal direction<br>
parallel to the axis (X). The inner surrounding barrel wall<br>
surface 221 includes a larger-diameter segment 213 and a<br>
smaller-diameter segment 214 which are disposed proximate to<br>
the lower and upper open ends 211,212, respectively, and which<br>
cooperatively form a first surrounding shoulder portion 215<br>
therebetween. A finger flange 23 is disposed on an outer<br>
surrounding barrel wall surface 222 of the barrel 20 at the lower<br>
open end 211. The smaller-diameter segment 214 is formed with<br>
a retaining groove 223 proximate to the first surrounding<br>
shoulder portion 215, and an axially extending friction spline<br>
portion 216 remote from the first surrounding shoulder portion<br>
215. A protruding ring 217 is formed on and projects inwardly<br>
and radially from the larger-diameter segment 213 adjacent to<br>
the lower open end 211.<br>
The tubular needle seat 30 is disposed to be insertable into<br>
the passage 21 from the lower open end 211 toward the upper open<br>
end 212. The needle seat 30 includes a lower surrounding edge<br>
portion 33 disposed to abut against the first surrounding<br>
shoulder portion 215 and having an outer surrounding surface<br>
333 which abuts sealingly against the larger-diameter segment<br>
213, an upper surrounding edge portion 321 disposed opposite<br>
to the lower surrounding edge portion 33 in the longitudinal<br>
direction, and a surrounding seat wall 32 interposed<br>
therebetween.<br>
The seat wall 32 has an inner tubular wall surface 324 which<br>
surrounds the axis (X) to confine a duct 31. The duct 31 has<br>
a diameter that gradually decreases from the lower surrounding<br>
edge portion 33 to the upper surrounding edge portion 321. The<br>
inner tubular wall surface 324 forms a grip segment. In this<br>
embodiment, the grip segment includes a concave portion 326<br>
which extends inwardly from the inner tubular wall surface 324<br>
in radial directions relative to the axis (X) to form a second<br>
surrounding shoulder portion 329 that is adjacent to the lower<br>
surrounding edge portion 33.<br>
The seat wall 32 further has an outer tubular wall surface<br>
325 which includes lower and upper segments 322,323. The lower<br>
segment 322 is proximate to the lower surrounding edge portion<br>
33, and has a retaining protrusion 327 formed thereon. When the<br>
upper surrounding edge portion 321 is forced to extend outwardly<br>
of the upper open end 212 of the barrel 20 after the tubular<br>
needle seat 30 is inserted into the passage 21, the lower segment<br>
322 will be brought to a position of use, as shown in Fig. 4,<br>
where the lower segment 322 engages and is retained at the<br>
smaller-diameter segment 214 by virtue of a first friction force<br>
generated as a result of retaining engagement of the retaining<br>
protrusion 327 in the retaining groove 223, while an upper edge<br>
surface 331 of the lower surrounding edge portion 33 abuts<br>
against the first surrounding shoulder portion 215 of the barrel<br>
20. The lower segment 322 further has an axially extending<br>
friction spline portion 328 which cooperates with the friction<br>
spline portion 216 of the smaller-diameter segment 214 to form<br>
a spline member so as to prevent relative rotation between the<br>
needle seat 30 and the barrel 2:0. The upper segment 323 is<br>
disposed opposite to the lower segment 322 and proximate to the<br>
upper surrounding edge portion 321, and is adapted to be sleeved<br>
over by the needle hub 42 of the needle unit 40 so as to<br>
communicate the duct 31 of the needle seat 30 with the needle<br>
hub 42.<br>
The plunger 50 includes a stem portion 50a which is movable<br>
in the passage 21 of the barrel 20. The stem portion 50a has<br>
a plurality of wing plates 53 angularly displaced from one<br>
another, a surrounding flange 51 disposed on upper edges of the<br>
wing plates 53, a connecting shank 54 extending from the<br>
surrounding flange 51, and a retaining protrusion 542 . The wing<br>
plates 53 are tapered downwardly. On the other hand, the stem<br>
portion 50a includes inner and outer segments 502,501 opposite<br>
to each other in the longitudinal direction. The outer segment<br>
501 extends outwardly of the lower open end 211 of the barrel<br>
20. An actuated end 52, which is a thumb rest, extends from the<br>
outer segment 501 so as to be actuated to move the stem portion<br>
50a along the passage 21.<br>
The plunger 50 further includes a head 50b which has a tapered<br>
surrounding abutting portion 541 that extends from the retaining<br>
protrusion 542 of the inner segment 502 toward the grip segment<br>
of the needle seat 30, and a spindle portion 55 which extends<br>
upwardly from the surrounding abutting portion 541 along the<br>
axis (X) and which terminates at two split halves 552,553 that<br>
are spaced apart from each other in a direction transverse to<br>
the longitudinal direction with a concave space 551 inbetween.<br>
The split halves 552,553 respectively have upper terminal<br>
anchoring edges 554,555. Preferably, the spindle portion 55 has<br>
an outer diameter which decreases from the surrounding abutting<br>
portion 541 toward the split halves 552,553. Moreover, the<br>
surrounding abutting portion 541 and the retaining protrusion<br>
542 are configured to be substantially hollow so as to provide<br>
greater flexibility.<br>
A deformable surrounding engaging portion 60, preferably-<br>
made of an elastic material, is retainingly sleeved on the whole<br>
retaining protrusion 542 of the inner segment 502 and a portion<br>
of the surrounding abutting portion 541 to generate a second<br>
friction force. The surrounding engaging portion 60 has upper<br>
and lower end faces 64,65 opposite to each other in the<br>
longitudinal direction and proximate to and distal from the<br>
lower surrounding edge portion 33 of the needle seat 30,<br>
respectively, and an outer surrounding surface 63 disposed<br>
therebetween. The lower end face 65 is distal from the<br>
surrounding flange 51 by a space (S). The outer surrounding<br>
surface 63 sealingly contacts and is slidable relative to the<br>
larger-diameter segment 213 of the barrel 20 so as to be moved<br>
with the stem portion 50a. Preferably, the outer surrounding<br>
surface 63 is concaved toward the axis (X) to decrease contact<br>
area between the outer surrounding surface 63 and the<br>
larger-diameter segment 213 so as to facilitate sliding movement<br>
of the surrounding engaging portion 60 relative to the<br>
larger-diameter segment 213.<br>
With reference to Fig. 5, in use, the plunger 50 is pressed<br>
forwardly to push the upper end face 64 of the surrounding<br>
engaging portion 60 to abut against a lower edge surface 332<br>
of the lower surrounding edge portion 33 of the needle seat 30.<br>
Since the spindle portion 55 is configured to be tapered upwardly<br>
and to match with the inner tubular wall surface 324 of the needle<br>
seat 30, drug solution in the passage 21 can almost be completely<br>
injected via the needle unit 40.<br>
Subsequently, referring to Fig. 6, when the plunger 50 is<br>
further moved forward by a third force towards the smaller-<br>
diameter segment 214 against the second friction force between<br>
the inner segment 502 and the surrounding engaging portion 60,<br>
the surrounding engaging portion 60 is deformed by the lower<br>
surrounding edge portion 33, thereby decreasing the space (S)<br>
and permitting the surrounding abutting portion 541 of the head<br>
50b to move in the concave portion 326 of the needle seat 30<br>
to abut against the second surrounding shoulder portion 329.<br>
Meanwhile, the split halves 552,553 of the spindle portion<br>
55 are pressed by the inner tubular wall surface 324 to move<br>
towards each other against a biasing action when the split halves<br>
552,553 are moved towards the upper surrounding edge portion<br>
321. Once the split halves 552,553 are moved beyond the upper<br>
surrounding edge portion 321, the upper terminal anchoring edges<br>
554,555 will engage the upper surrounding edge portion 321 to<br>
generate a friction force that combines with the friction force<br>
between the surrounding abutting portion 541 and the second<br>
surrounding shoulder portion 329 to form a fourth friction force<br>
that is greater than the first friction force between the<br>
retaining protrusion 327 and the retaining groove 223.<br>
After use, referring to Fig. 7, the outer segment 501 of<br>
the plunger 50 is pulled backward to be remote from the finger<br>
flange 23 so that the needle seat 30, on which the used needle<br>
unit 40 is mounted, is retracted into the passage 21 via the<br>
upper open end 212 to bring the upper surrounding edge portion<br>
321 to a retracted position. When the surrounding flange 51 abuts<br>
against the protruding ring 217, further movement of the plunger<br>
50 is prevented, thereby restraining the surrounding engaging<br>
portion 60 from being moved out. of the lower open end 211. In<br>
this state, the used needle unit 40 can be enclosed in the passage<br>
21 of the barrel 20 for disposal.<br>
Consequently, chances that the user may be accidentally<br>
pricked or pierced by the needle 41 are slim. The safety in use<br>
and disposal is thus enhanced.<br>
Furthermore, the wing plates 53 at the inner segment 502<br>
have a weakening area 531 disposed proximate to the surrounding<br>
flange 51. As such, when the plunger 50 is retracted to push<br>
the surrounding flange 51 to abut against the protruding ring<br>
217, the weakening area 531 extends outwardly of the lower open<br>
end 211 so as to ease breaking of the stem portion 50a off the<br>
plunger 50 at the weakening area 531 for convenient disposal.<br>
Referring to Fig. 8, the second preferred embodiment of the<br>
disposable syringe according to this invention is shown to be<br>
similar to the aforesaid embodiment in construction. The<br>
differences therebetween reside in that the spindle portion in<br>
the aforesaid embodiment is dispensed with. An elastic<br>
surrounding engaging portion 60 is retainingly sleeved on the<br>
whole retaining protrusion 742 and a portion of the surrounding<br>
abutting portion 741. As such, when the surrounding engaging<br>
portion 60 is brought by the stem portion 73 of the plunger 70<br>
upwardly to engage and to be depressed by the lower surrounding<br>
edge portion 33 of the needle seat 30, the surrounding engaging<br>
portion 60 is retained by the lower surrounding edge portion<br>
33, thereby permitting the surrounding abutting portion 741 to<br>
be retained in the concave portion 326, as shown in Fig. 9 . Hence,<br>
the needle seat 30 and the needle unit 40 can be retracted into<br>
the passage 21 of the barrel 20 after an injection procedure<br>
to permit breaking of the stem portion 73 of the plunger 70 at<br>
a weakening area 731 for safe disposal, as shown in Fig. 10.<br>
Referring to Figs. 11 and 12, the third preferred embodiment<br>
of the disposable syringe according to this invention is shown<br>
to be similar to the aforesaid embodiments in construction. The<br>
differences therebetween reside in that a tubular needle seat<br>
30 has a duct 31 with a relatively small diameter at the upper<br>
segment 323 so as to engage fittingly the needle 41. Thus, the<br>
needle hub 42 can be eliminated.<br>
Moreover, a barrel 20 has an outer surrounding wall surface<br>
222 with a sleeved portion 2221 which is disposed proximate to<br>
the upper open end 212 to replace the sleeved portion 423 shown<br>
in Fig. 2, and which has a plurality of friction ribs 224 formed<br>
thereon. Thus, a tip protector 43, which has a plurality of<br>
frictional ribs 433 formed on an internal sleeve end 431 thereof,<br>
can be sleeved fittingly on the sleeved portion 2221 for<br>
shielding the needle 41.<br>
In the syringe assembly of this embodiment, the number of<br>
components is decreased. Similarly, the needle seat 3 0 and the<br>
needle 41 can be retracted into the passage 21 of the barrel<br>
20 after an injection procedure.<br>
Referring to Fig. 13, the fourth preferred embodiment of<br>
the disposable syringe with a similar construction of the<br>
aforesaid embodiments, is used for an extremely small injection<br>
volume, such as 1 ml. Thus, the dimensions of the barrel 20,<br>
the needle seat 30, the needle 41, the plunger 70, and the<br>
deformable surrounding engaging portion 60 are smaller than<br>
those of the aforesaid embodiments.<br>
Referring to Figs. 14 and 15, the fifth and sixth preferred<br>
embodiments of the disposable syringe according to this<br>
invention are shown to be similar to the third and fourth<br>
embodiments in construction, respectively. The differences<br>
therebetween reside in that the upper open end 212 has a<br>
surrounding edge wall 219 which extends from the smaller-<br>
diameter segment 214 of the inner surrounding barrel wall<br>
surface 221 of the barrel 20 toward the axis (X) and which<br>
confines a through hole 210 that surrounds the axis (X) . As such,<br>
the needle 41 can pass through the through hole 210 and outwardly<br>
of the upper open end 212. The sixth preferred embodiment shown<br>
in Fig. 15 is similar to the fifth preferred embodiment in<br>
construction, but is used for an extremely small injection<br>
volume, such as 1 ml.<br>
