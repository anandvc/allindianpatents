Field   of   the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of producing multilayer articles by compression moulding of a coextruded  charge  of   synthetic   resin.<br>
Description   of   the prior   art<br>
Japanese Patent JP 2 0 98 415 proposes producing a<br>
multilayer article by comression moulding of a<br>
cylindrical multilayer charge consisting of a radial<br>
stack        of       several       synthetic       resin        layers.	The<br>
comression moulding of this charge, along a direction parallel to its axis of symmetry and creating a radial flow of the charge, leads to an article having a multilayer structure. According to the method disclosed in Patent JP 2 098 415, squashing this charge and leads t o   multilayer   articles   as   illust rat ed   in  Figure  3.<br>
It is proposed in Patent JP 2 098 415 to use a triple-layer charge illustrated in Figure 1, this charge being made up of a first resin 4 forming the central portion of the charge, a second resin 3 covering only the side faces of the first resin, and a third resin 2 covering only the side faces of the second resin. This charge is positioned in a compression mould 5 comprising a die 6 and a punch 7. Squashing this composite charge in the mould 5 along its axis of symmetry is illustrated in Figure 2, Squashing creates a radial flow of the charge.<br>
The multilayer article obtained according to the method disclosed in Patent JP 2 098 415 is illustrated in Figure 3. The multilayer structure obtained is characterized by the double functional layer 3 embedded in  the thickness   of   the  article;    said   layer   3   forming   a<br><br>
fold and having two free ends. The multilayer packaging produced according to the invention disclosed in Patent JP 2 0 98 415 has numerous advantages, in particular when the functional layer is an oxygen barrier layer which makes it possible to improve the preservation of food contained in the packaging. However, by applying the method disclosed in Patent JP 2 098 415, a double functional layer 3 is obtained approximately centred in the thickness of the article. Now, it would be convenient for a functional layer to be close to the inner wall. Such a configuration would have the advantage of reducing the quantity of molecules that migrate from the packaged product into the wall of the packaging, or from the wall of the packaging into the packaged product. The method disclosed in Patent JP 2 098 415 does not allow the position of the functional layer in the thickness of the part to be changed.<br>
There is thus a need to be able to solve the above problems.<br>
Subject   of  the invention<br>
As will subsequently be seen, the present invention aims to change the position of the functional layer in the thickness of the part, to place it at a distance closer to the inner wall than the outer wall of the article,<br>
Summary of  the invention<br>
The invention consists of a method of producing a multilayer article forming an axisymmetric body, said article comprising at least a bas e of diameter D join ed to a side wall of thickness T and of height H. The method consists in feeding a coextruded multilayer charge into the cavity of a mould then in compessing said  charge  in   order  to  form the  article;    the direction<br><br>
of compression being parallel to the axis of symmetry of said charge and the comression applies to one face of the charge. The charge for ITS a body axisymmetric about an axis of symmetry and consists of a radial stack of several layers of which at least one is a thin functional layer. The outer diameter of said charge being approxirrately equal to D. The method is characterized by the fact that the charge is compressed only  on   one portion   of   said  face.<br>
The invention also consists in producing multilayer articles by compression moulding of a charge of diameter D consisting of a radial stack of several layers of which at least one is a thin functional layer and in positioning, due to the invention, the functional layer close to the inner wall of the packaging. The multilayer charge is fed into a mould and compressed in the direction of the axis of symmetry of the charge. Centring the charge in the mould is important for obtaining a correct distribution of layers over the whole periphery of the article. Advantageously the charge is not compressed over the whole of its surface but only over one central portion of the charge, the diameter of said central portion being   less  than   D.<br>
According to a preferential mode of the invention, a multilayer charge of diameter equal to D is fed into the cavity of a mould; the diameter of the charge being close to the diameter of the mould cavity; the diameter of the charge being preferably slightly smaller than the diameter of said mould cavity. The multilayer charge is compressed over a surface approximaely equal to ( D-2T) , T being equal to the thickness of the moulded part, According to this preferential mode of the invention, the charge mainly flows in the direction of compression and not radially. According to this preferential embodiment, the functional layer is positioned    radially   in    the   charge    at    a    distance    of<br><br>
preferably    between    It     has     been<br>
observed that the multilayer packaging produced in accordance with the previously described method has a functional layer very close to the inner wall of the packaging. This packaging is particularly advantageous when    the    functional    layer    is    a    barrier     layer.      The<br>
smaller    distance  mentioned    above   constitutes    a<br>
limit allowing the functional layer to be properly kept within  the wall   of  the packaging.<br>
The invention is particularly advantageous for producing articles whose height H is greater than D, For such articles where the height H is large enough compared to said diameter D, some particularly interesting properties are obtained, which are linked to the fact that the functional layer lies close to the inner wall of said article and that only a small portion of the wall of said article does not have a multilayer  structure.<br>
The invention will be better understood hereinafter by mean s of a detailed description of the examples illustrated  by the figures   below.<br>

Detailed  description   of   the figures<br>
The invention relates to a method of producing multilayer articles by compression moulding of a multilayer charge.<br>
The multilayer charge is formed by radially superirrposing several resins and has a cylindrical geometry of diameter D. The invention is intended, but not in an exclusive way, for the production of multilayer packaging having improved gas and aroma barrier properties. For this reason, the multilayer charge preferentially comprises a thin functional layer chosen for its barrier properties. This functional layer flows during the method of producing the article and spreads out inside the wall of the article. The thin functional resin layer is therefore embedded in the charge between the resin layers intended for forming the wall of the article. The functional layer is often combined with two thin adhesive resin layers placed on both sides of the functional layer in order to improve the adhesion between the layers. The adhesive layers will not be mentioned in the remainder of the invention document so as 'not to increase the presentation of the invention. In the same sense, the invention document is produced with a charge comprising only two resins, but charges comprising a greater number of resins and of layers may easily be produced, which constitutes a significant advantage relative to existing  products.<br>
The multilayer charge being used in the explanation of the invention is illustrated in Figure 4, This charge 1 of cylindrical geometry comprises a first resin forming the layers 2 and 4 and constituting at least 80% of the charge volume,   and   a  thin  functional   layer   3   located   at<br><br>
a   distance   R   from the   axis    of   symmetry   of   the   charge. It      has       been      found      by      experimentation      that      the functional   layer   is   better   spread  in  the article when   R<br>
is     between    T     being     the     average<br>
thickness of the article produced. This aspect of the invention will be returned to in more detail further on in  the document.<br>
The multilayer charge 1 is manufactured by coextrusion of a rod. Preferably said rod is extruded at a constant rate and regularly cut in order to form a succession of multilayer charges. Since the methods and devices enabling the charges to be manufactured are described in the prior art, only the principle of manufacturing the charge is presented. The multilayer charge 1mray also be obtained by batch coextrusion in order to form each charge separately.<br>
The multilayer charge is fed into the cavity of a mould 5, said mould 5 comprising at least two parts, a first part 6, called the die, which receives the charge; and a second part 7, called the punch, which in its movement compresses the charge. The charge is deposited in the mould so that the axis of symmetry of the charge is aligned with the axis of symmetry of the mould cavity. A first part of the invention consists in producing a charge of diameter D close to the diameter of the mould cavity as illustrated in Figure 4. The moulding device shown in Figure 4 and the following figures is a schematic representation being used only to explain the invention. The moulding devices required to produce articles according to the invention are known and will therefore not fall within the scope of this document. The cavity formed by the die 6 is not  necessarily cylindrical as is shown in Figure 4, but the wall of said cavity may form an angle with the axis of symmetry, which may be a clearance angle of around 3°    allowing   the   article   to   be  demoulde,    or   a      larger<br><br>
angle if the article is conical. Within the scope of the invention the tapering of articles produced is generally less than 10° , the cone angle being defined relative to the axis   of   symmetry.<br>
The charge 1 is then compressed in the mould following a direction parallel to the axis of symmetry- Contrary to that which is described in the prior art, and in particular in Patent JP 2 098 415, the charge is compressed only over its central portion; the diameter of said central portion being approximately equal to (0-21), Figure 5 shows the descent of the punch 7 that compresses the central portion of the upper layer of the charge 1. The movement of the punch 7 creates a def or mat ion of the charge and a f1ow of the uncompressed portion of the charge. The functiona1 layer forms a fold and flows along the wall of the punch 7 while remaining completely embedded between the layers 4 and 2, The flow of the functional layer 3 along the wall of the punch that was observed during the tests was completely unexpected. This flow appears under specific conditions described within the scope of this   invention.<br>
The invention also relates to multilayer articles obtained due to the  method   of  the invention.<br>
Figure 6 shows the multilayer article that is obtained. This article comprises a functional layer 3 forming a double layer embedded between the layers 4 and 2 forming the wall of the article. The functional layer forms a fold level with the upper end of the article and has two free ends located level with the base of said article. The multilayer article obtained has a double functional layer close to the inner wall of said article. Figure 6 shows the functional layer 3 forming a double layer 3a and 3b; layer 3a being separated from the inner wall of the packaging by layer 2a; layer 4 separating   layers    3a   and   3b;     and   layer   2b   separating<br><br>
layer 3 from the outer wall of the packaging. The first functional layer 3 a lies at a distance from the inner wall of the article of less than T/6 and the second functional layer 3b at a distance of less than 2T/3 and generally less than T/3. The invention makes it possible to reduce, by at least 30%, the number of molecules that migrate from the wall of the packaging into the packaged product, or the molecules that migrate from the packaged product into the wall of the packaging, relative to an article of the prior art obtained  according to  Patent   JP  2  098   415.<br>
The articles produced according to the invention have particularly advantageous properties when their height H is greater than or equal to D. In fact, for articles having a height H greater than D, the functional layer forms a barrier spread into at least 80% of the article, which allows an appreciable improvement in the impermeability of   said   article.<br>
The radial position of the functional layer in the charge has a great influence on the distribution of said functional layer within the article. Thus, it has been observed that if the functional layer is positioned   in   the   charge   at    a   radius    R   of    less   than<br>
  the    functional     layer     only    spreads    partially<br>
within the side wall of the article. More specifically, the functional layer is found to be missing from the end of the side wall of the article. In the majority of cases, it is desirable that the functional layer spreads up to the end of the artic1e, but there are some articles where the barri er properties are only required over one portion alone of the side wall of the article     and     f or     which     the     barrier     layer      may     be<br>
     positioned    at    a   distance   of    less   than  It    has<br>
also been observed that the radial position of the functional   layer   in  the charge   must   not   be  greater   than<br><br>
  so  that   the  functional   layer   remains    embedded   in<br>
the   wall    of    the   article.     When   the   radial    position    of the     functional      layer     is      greater     than    the<br>
functional   layer   is   found   in   places    on   the   surface   of the   side   wall    of    the    article.     In    most    cases,     it    is desirable     to     keep     the     functional     layer      embedded, especially    when     the     functional      layer     is      moisture-sensitive.<br>
The method is of great advantage in producing multilayer preforms intended for forming hollow bodies by biaxial blow moulding. Figure 7 illustrates a multilayer preform obtained according to the method of the invention. This preform has a thin functional layer 3 forming a double protection 3 a and 3 b at the level of the side walls. The functional layer 3 is embedded in the main resin 2 forming the wall of the preform, and said functional layer 3 has two free ends at base 1evel and also a fold under the neck. The functional layer 3 forms two layers 3 a and 3 b at the level of the side walls; said layers 3a and 3b being located close to the inner wall of the pref or m. The layers 3 a and 3 b are located respectively at distances of less than T/6 and T/3 from the inner wall of the preform, T being the thickness of the wall of the preform at the location considered. The functional layer 3 is spread throughout the entire preform except at base and neck 1evel. The percentage of functional layer in this article is less than 2%. By way of example, the invention allows PET or PP prefor ms to be produced with PAMXD6 or EVOH functional layers. Adhesive resin layers may be added to  both  sides   of   the functional   layer.<br>
The   hollow   body  forming   packaging   is   obtained   by   blow        moulding   in   a   mould   of   the   preform  shown   in   Figure   7. This   hollow   body  comprising   a   base,    a   neck   and   a   side wall     joining    the    base    to    the    neck    is     particularly<br><br>
advantageous as it has improved barrier properties. More than 90 % of the wall of said hollow body has an impermeability improved by the functional layer. The functional layer forming a double protection is found in proximity to the inner wall of said hollow body, which considerably limits the migration of molecules from the wall of the hollow body into the contents; or from the contents into the wall of the hollow body. The functional layer is embedded in the main resin forming the wall of said hollow body, and said functional layer has two free ends at base level and also a fold under the neck. The functional layer forms two layers at the level of the side walls; said layers being located close to the inner wall of the hollow body. The functional layers are located respectively at distances of less than F/6 and F/3 from the inner wall of the hollow body, F being the thickness of the wall of the hollow body at the location considered. The functional layer is spread throughout the entire hollow body except at base and neck level. The percentage of functional layer in this hollow body is less than 2%. The migration of molecules from the wall of the hollow body into the packaged product, or the migration of molecules from the packaged product into the wall of the hollow body is reduced by at least 50% relative to the prior   art.<br>
The invention makes it possible to produce multilayer hollow bodies having Improved properties. The invention makes it possible to produce multilayer articles having very thin layers and having a large number of layers. This result may be obtained by a continuous coextrusion process in order to form the charge. This continuous coextrusion process makes it possible to obtain very thin layers and large numbers of layers contrary to batch processes like the multilayer injection moulding process  currently used.<br><br>
Figure 8 illustrates the possibility of spreading the functional layer 3 into the neck of the preform without weakening the mechanical properties of said neck. In fact, the invention makes it possible to add adhesive layers to each side of the barrier layer and to extrude these layers with a thickness that is sufficiently thin so that the set of three layers forming the functional layer represents less than 2% of the volume of the article. The improvement in the adhesion between the layers, combined with the low thickness of the layers, allows these layers to spread into the neck of the preform without weakening the mechanical properties of said  neck.<br>
The hollow body obtained by blow moulding in a mould of the preform represented in Figure 8 coitprises a base, a n©::k and a side wall joining the base and the neck. This hollow body is particularly advantageous since it has irrproved barrier properties. more than 90% of the wall of said hollow body has an impermeability irrproved by the functional layer. The functional layer forming a double protection is found in proximity to the inner wall of said hollow body, which c onsiderably li mits the migration of molecules from the wall of the hollow body into the contacts; or from the contents into the wall of the hollow body. The functional layer forms two layers at the level of the side walls and of the neck; said layers being located close to the inner wall of the hollow body. The functional layers are located respectively at distances of less than F/6 and F/3 from the inner wall of the hollow body, F being the t hic kn es s of the wall of the hol1ow body at the location considered. The functional layer is spread throughout the entire hollow body except at base level. The functional layer represents less than 2% of the resin required to form the hollow body. The migration of molecules from the wall of the packaging into the packaged   product   or  the  migration   of   molecules   from the<br><br>
packaged product into the wall of the packaging is reduced   by at   least   50%.<br>
The molecules that migrate from the wall of the packaging into the packaged product are molecules of low rrass resulting from the method of producing the resins or resulting from the decorrposition of the resin during the processing method- By way of exanple, these molecules may be monomers, plasticizers, adjuvants or acetaldehyde molecules in the case of PET. Also by way of exarrple, the molecules migrating from the packaged product into the wall of the packaging may be aromas, colorants , adjuvants , stabilizers , preservatives or flavour   enhanc ers.<br>
The    resins     used    within    the    scope    of    the    invention correspond   to   the  thermoplastic   r esins   routinely   used, and     more    particularly    those    used     in     the    packaging industry.    Among  the  barrier   resins   that   may  be  used   to form the functional   layer   3,    mention   may  be   made  of   the ethylene/vinyl     alcohol    copolymers     ( EVOH) ,     polyamides such      as       Nylon-]yiXD6,       acrylonitrile/methyl       acr ylat e copolymers     ( BAREX)     and    f luoropolymers     such    as     PVDF. Mention    may   also   be   made   of   some   resins   which    may   be used   to   form  structure   2   of   the   article;    polyethylene ( PE) ,    polypropylene    ( PP) ,    polysytrene    ( PS) ,    polyamide ( PA)    and   polyester   ( PET) .    This   list   is   not    exhaustive. When    choosing   the   resins,    it    is    irrportant    to   select products    with   similar   viscosities.     In    general,    it    is preferable     to     use     resins     that,      at     the     operating temperature,    have   a   viscosity   ratio   of    less    than    10, and  preferably a  viscosity ratio  of   less   than   3  will   be chos en.<br>
The coirpression moulding method consists in feeding a multilayer charge of synthetic resins in the melt stat e into the cavity of a mould; in forming the article by the  coirpression    moulding   of   said   charge   in   the  cavity<br><br>
of said mould; in cooling said article then in demoulding  it.<br>
In the examples presented here, the charges and the articles are of sirrple geometry, but it goes without saying that the invention relates to various charge and article geometries. By way of example, a charge having an orifice may be used to form an article having an opening  at   base  level.<br>
The articles obtained according to the invention incorporate a functional layer 3 forming at least one fold level with the periphery of the article. Articles also incorporating a second fold close to the axis of s ymmetr y of the article nay be obtained. An arrangement of the functional layer in the shape of a zigzag may be obtained   in  the article.<br>
Charges corrprising several functional layers 3 may also be used, said functional layers being all centred on the axis of symmetry of said charge. The multilayer articles obtained are characterized by the fact that the functional layers are superiirpos ed at least partly, and   each  form at   least   one fold.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
