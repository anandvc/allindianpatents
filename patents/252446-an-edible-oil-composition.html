         TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process of manufacturing an improved edible oil composition, which lowers the uptake in fried foods.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is well known in the art of frying tliat the purpose of frying is to supply heat to the food whereby the food gives up its moisture and develops satisfactory flavors apart from other sensory values as colout; aroma and mouthfccl. While the above are the more valued outcomes of the process of frying the accompanying absorption of oil into the food matrix makes the food highly implicated in the risk of coronary heat diseases and obesity.<br>
A larger portion of fats and oils consumed are used in the prqjaration of fried foods. During deep fat frying the fat is exposed to light, elevated temperature and atmospheric oxygen. silica compounds are known to suppress foaming in aqueous solutions. During frying, silica compounds arc thought to indirectly inhibit oxidation by suppressing the accumulation of foam-promoting oxidation products such as free fatty acids and food exudates. Martin (1953) and Babayan (1961) have patents on the use of methyl silicone for protecting oil against oxidative deterioration and raising the smoke point of the oil. Freeman et  al (1973) showed that silicones could greatly increase the oxidative stability of oils at high temperatures. Frankel et al (1985) found that addition of methyl silicone significantly improved cooking oil performance.<br>
The preparation of fried foods in a medium other than naturally occurring animal or vegetable fats and oils has long been viewed as advantageous from the standpoint of reducing the overall caloric content of the foods. In many fried snack foods, such as potato chips, the residual frying oil content of the finished product contribute more to the calorie content of the product than any other ingredient As consumer trends place reduced-calorie or 'lighf foods in more and more favour, there remains a need to provide such foods so as to meet consumer demand The use of a frying medium, which reduces the overall calorie content of fried foods, has been regarded as desirable. Fat contribute a variety of<br><br>
important functions as an ingredient in food products, howevei; due to its excellent heat transfer properties, animal and vegetable fats and oils perform well as a cooking medium.<br>
Those familiar with the act will know that methyl silosane among other silicone oils has been used to prepare low caloric foods either by partially or wholly replacing vegetable or animal oils and fats. Dissatisfaction parameters in the use of silicone oil in replacement either partially or wholly are the excessive foaming and the presence of typically developed fried flavours.<br>
a)	Morehouse and Zabik, J Food Science, 54 (4) pp, 1061-65 (1989) hsvc identified 35 cSt<br>
(centistokes) polydimethyisiloxane as the most preferred frying media of the many viscosity<br>
grades of polydimetliylsiloxane fluid which are available. Potato slices can be fried in 35 cSt<br>
polydimethyisiloxane with considerable foaming to make potato chips. These chips have<br>
good texture but lack the typical flavours associated with chips prepared in vegetable oils.<br>
Accordingly, chips prepared in silicone fluid received lower scores in taste panel than<br>
ccnventional chips.<br>
b)	The use of silicone fluid for the preparation of caloric-reduced fried foods has received<br>
considerable attention in the literature. European Patent Application 205,273 A2 (C L Fryc,<br>
Dow Corning Corp. published Dec 17, 1986) describes the use of silicone fluids as<br>
fcplaccment fof natural fats and oils in a variety of foods. Several examples in the<br>
publications illustrate the preparation of fried foods in silicone fluid. Not included in the<br>
patent arc silicones which become part of the foods at very low levels, i.e. substantially less<br>
than 0.1 weight percent; such as silicone based antifoams, release coatings in bakery goods<br>
and the like.<br>
US Patent No.4983413 (Meyer ct al Jan 8,1991) also relates to the preparation of reduced-calorie foods by the incorporation of silicone fluids as replacements for natural fats or oils. By way of illustration, thin potato slices can be fried in 95:5% blend of dimethylsiloxane fluid of 35 CST viscosity and conventional frying oil, to produce an acceptable fried chip.<br>
US Patent NOE.5192572 and 5100684 199 (El-Nokaly) relate to a method of using silica to decrease for absorption. They talk about fried products with a lower fat content. The potato<br><br>
pieces are fried in an oil comprising from about 0.50 to about 2% of a hydrophobic and hydcophilic silica.<br>
US Patent No-H159l (Fulcher; John) relates to an improved method for preparing reduced caloric fried foods. Such a method takes advantage of the beneficial pcopecties possessed by silicone fluid, while providing the desirable flavour notes of a fried food, It mentions about the addition of flavour-enhancing components to the silicone oil.<br>
US Patent No:26342l3 discloses a method for stabilization of shortenings at a high temperature against oxidative deterioration and accompanying changes. A further object was to  inhibit the oxidative decomposition of tocopherol in shortenings when heated to<br>
While the ability to provide ccduccd-fat (and thus reduced-calorie food) products is of great commercial interest, the full commercial potential will not be realized unless the food products have &amp; full complement of sensoty characteristics (e.g. taste, texture and 'mouthfeel') that arc as good as, or nearly as good as, their highcr-calorie, animal or vegetable fat- confaining commercial counterparts.<br>
Therefote, there is dearly a need of a commercial cooking medium, which has the ability to provide reduced fat products without compromising on sensory attributes such as taste, texture and mouthfeel. Also, such commercial compositions should also have the ability to provide reduced fat food through out the period of their shelf life, which is usually 12 months. such cookihg medium  should also not  excessively foam during frying.<br>
Even though use of the methyl silosanes to prepare low calorie food either by partially or fully replscing the vegetable or animal fats is well known, not a single commercial cooking medium is available, containing silicone oils as an additive below 0.05%, which provides<br>
reduced fat food through out their shelf life of 12 months.<br>
Primary reason for this is the insolubility of silicone oils in vegetable or animal fats. Because<br>
of their insolubility in oils, these compounds need to be very well dispersed in the cooking<br><br>
medium. If the particle size of the dispersed silicone oils is not in a specific range, they eifher tend to settle at the bottom of the container or migrate towards the sides of the container, therey reducing the benefit of lowering the oil uptake.<br>
Martin, in his patent on "Stabilisation of oils and fats" (US-Patent No.2,634,213) , has suggested the use of hcxanc solvent to incorporate the methyl silicones. Babayan, in his patent on " High Smoke Point Frying Oils " (US Patent No, 2998,319) has suggested the use of a colloidal mill or a homogenizer to disperse these silicone oils. However, none of these prior arts teach us how to manufacture an edible oil composition, which provides a benefit of lowering the oil uptake, throughout its shelf life of 12 months.<br>
In an embodiment of this  invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing an edible oil composition on a commercial scale; which contains a silicone oil as an additive at levels Jess than 0.05%, wfiich provides a benefit of lower uptake in fried foodstuff throughout the period of its shelf life.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a process for manufacturing an edible oil<br>
composition for lowering the oil upteke  by fried foods.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a process for the manufacturing an edible oil<br>
composition used for the preparation of deeply fried foodstuff retaining minimum amount<br>
of frying medium.<br>
Yet another  object or  this invention is to propose a process for manufacturing an edible oil<br>
composition, which significantly increases the life of the oil and fried food product<br>
still another object of this invention is to propose a process of manufacturing an edible oil<br>
composition, for producing fried foodstuff which retains higher levels of nutrients.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a procas of incotporating in oil the<br>
additives such as oil soluble vitamins and antioxidants as well as oil insoluble silicone oils<br>
and synergists, for lowering the uptake in foods.<br>
Still anotha" object of this  invention is to propose a process of manufacturing an edible oil<br>
composition, comprising oil insoluble additives such as silicone oils and synergists, having a<br>
particle size of maximum 25 microns, so that these additives neither settle at the bottom of<br>
the container nor vmigrate towards the sides of the container, during the prriod of storage of<br><br>
12 months, thereby giving the same effect of lowering the uptake in foods during their shelf life of 12 months.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention, there is an edible oil composition comprising of: a) 5 to 499 PPM of a silicone oil, b) 10 to 200 PPM of synergists,<br>
c)	10 to 200 PPM of antioxidant<br>
d)	30 to 100 IU of an oil soluble vitamin<br>
e)	remainder being any known edible oil<br>
obtained by a process comprising steps of<br>
a. Pcepacing a dispececd mixture of silicone oil and an aqueous solution of the synergist in the said edible oil composition at a temperature of 30 deg. C to 80 deg.C , which is subjected to steps of dilution and particle size reduction using mixers, for a period of 30 to 180 minutes, till the particle size of the dispersed phase is less than 25 microns<br>
b.   Adding oil soluble vitamins and antioxidants to the said mixture and subjecting it to the stop of stirring at 30 deg.C to 80 deg.C for a period of 30 to 180 minutes Which when ueed for frying lowers the oil uptake by fried foods.<br>
Oil soluble vitamins and the antioxidants can be uniformly mixed in oil very easily by using a stirrer. However,  a specially deigned process needs to be used to disperse the oil insoluble synergists and silicone oil, so as to prevent them from settling at the bottom of the container on storage oc to prevent them from migrating towards the sides of the container, thereby reducing the efficacy of the oil composition, in reducing oil uptake by fried foods.<br>
While mixture of silicones to vegetable oil or fat is already known to result in lower uptake of oil by the fired food stuff addition of a mixture comprising synergists in the range of 10 to 200 ppm, antioxidants in the range of 10 to 200 ppm and 30 to lOO IU of fat soluble vitamins along with silica compounds in the range of 5 to 499 ppm when mixed at a temperature in the range of 30 to 80oC FOR 60 TO 360 minutes in a Homogeniser, in addition<br>
to increase in lower uptake of oil by the fried food stuff, also results in retaining the higher<br><br>
nutrients in the oil and higher sensory vsducs as to colour aroma and mouthfecl in the food stuff prepared, which is due to the synergy achieved by adding the abo-vc stated composition to vegetable oil or  fact under specified conditions.<br>
Addition of 30 to 100 IU fat soluble "vitamins to the vegetable oil or fat with Citric Add in the range of 10 to 200 ppm, TBHQ in the range of 10 to 200 ppm and silicones in the range of 5 to 499 ppm, and mixing at the temperature of 30 to 80°c for 60 to 360 minute in a homonigiser, would cctaiti highec levels of nutrients and vitamins in the vegetable oil or fat and also in higher sensory values as to colour, aroma and mouthfecl.<br>
An aqueous solution of the synergist and the silicone oil is dispersed in the oil at 30 deg.C to 80 deg.C, for a period 30 to 180 min, using the equipment^ which reduce the particle size of these substances. The mixture such formed is further diluted number of times with oil, continuing the process of particle size reduction, to finally achieve a particle size of less than 25 microns. Once the desired particle size of these dispersed compounds is achieved, oil soluble vitamins and antioxidants arc added to this mixture at a temperature 30 to 80 deg,C and ace mixed for 30 min to 180 min using a paddle stirrer, calculated amount of this mixtute ia then added to a stream of oil and is properly mixed with the oil using static mixers in the pipeline. The final composition of oil comprises of 10 to 200 PPM of antioxidants, 10 to 200 PPM of synergists, 5 to 499 PPM of silicone oil and 30 to 100 IU of oil soluble vitamins.<br>
Non-limiting examples of Vqgetablc oils include coconut oil, soybean oil, peanut oil, safflower oil, rapeseed oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, rice bran oil, sunflower seed oil, sesame oil, other vegetable oils and their combinations, either in their original state or hydrogenated and inter-csterified forms.<br>
Non-limiting examples of antioxidants are tertiary butyl hydroquinone, or butylated hydroxy anisolc oc butylated hydroxy toluene; propyl gallate cither singly or in combination.<br>
Non-limiting  examples  of synergists  are  citric acid,  ascorbic acid,  either singly or<br>
combination.<br><br>
Non-limiting examples of equipments used for dispersing the oil insoluble compounds arc knife mixers, disc mixers, homogenizers, static mixers, ultrasonic mixers either singly or in combination.<br>

temperature at 60deg c.  This final premis (P6) comprises of 0.3% TBHQ, 0.075% of citric " acid and 0.05% of polydimcthysiloxane<br>
This premix (P6) was mixed with ccfincd sunflower oil in a required quantity, using a homogenisec at 200 RPM foe 45 min to obtain an oil composition (07) containing 200PPM of tertiary butyl hydroxy quinone, 50 pPM of citric add and 33.3 PPM of poldimcthysiloxane,<br>
Bread cubes were fried in the Reference oil (without any additives) and the said composition (07), maintaining the same frying conditions. The food items fried in the oil composition (07) showed lower oil uptake than the Reference oil.<br>
Example 8<br>
tha pctrtViiE (P7) comptit-es of 2% TBHQ, 1.0 % of citric acid and 0.2 % of polydimethysiioxane, was prepared in the following 3 steps<br>
1.	A 100 gm mixture containing 10% of polydimethyl siloxane in ccfincd sunflower oil is prepared using a homogeniser at 5000 RPM, for a period of 30 min, maintaining a temperature of 45 degC.<br>
2.	A 1 kg mixture containing 1% of polydimethylsiloxane , 10 % of tertiary butyl hydroquinonc and 5 % of citric acid (as 50% aqueous solution) is obtained by adding the required quantity of tertiary butyl hydroquinone, 50% solution of citric acid and refined sunflower oil to the mixture obtained by stepl and homogenising it for a period of 50 mins at 45 degC.<br>
3.	A 5 kg of flnal pccmix containing 0.2% of polydimethylsiloxane,2 % of tertiary butyl hydroquinonc and 1% of citric acid (as 50% aqueous solution) is obtained by adding the required quantity of tertiary butyl hydroquinone, 50% solution of citric acid and refined sunflower oil to the mixture obtained by step 2 and sonicating the mixture for 60 mins maintaining the teuiperature at 45 deg C,<br>
An oil composition(08) comprising 100 PPM of tertiary butyl hydroquinone, 50 PPM of citric acid and 10 PPM of polydimethylsiloxane was obtained by mixing the required quantity of prcmix(P7) in refined sunflower oil using a mixer at 200RPM ,for a period of 30 mins, maintaining temperature at 45 deg C.<br><br>
Bread cubes were fried in the Reference oil (without any additives) and the said composition (08), maintaining the same frying conditions. The food items fried in the oil composition (oaf) showed lower oil uptake than the Reference oil.<br>
The oil composition (06, 07&amp;O6) pr^ared as described in the example 6,7&amp; 8 were filled in the containers having capacity from 1 ttc to 15 Itrs and were stored at room tcmpccatucc for a period of 12 months.<br>
Samples were drawn from different portions of the containers at the interval of 3 months and were analysed for their silicon contents. Silicon content of these samples taken from various portions of the container wag found to be varying. However the variation in levels of silicon was lees compared to that observed in case of oil composition no.(05),<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
Oil composition (09) comprising 100 PPM of tertiary butyl hydroquinone; 50 PPM of citric<br>
add, 10 PPM of polydimethyleilosane and looIU of vitamin A was obtained by mizing the<br>
required quantity of premiz (P8) and vitamin A concentrate in refined sunflower oil using s<br>
mixer at 200RPM, for a period of 30 mins, maintaining temperature at 45 deg C.<br>
Various food items were fried in these oil compositions as well as in Reference Oil (without<br>
additives) maintaining Similar frying Conditions.<br>
The food items were bread slices, bread squares, bread cubes, idli chopa, fryums, banana<br>
chips, corn poha, rice chivda.<br>
Each or the items cooked quickly,  had an aesthetically pleasing  appearance, did not burn and was not excessively "greasy". The taste was excellent in each case.<br>
Bread cubes, corn poha, puties, rice flakes were fried in oil compositions (03) prepared as<br>
described in example 12 and in reference oil (without additives).<br>
In comparison with the Reference oil, lowering in oil uptake in bread cubes, corn poha,<br>
puries, rice flakes was  upto 20%, 30%,  10% and 20%  respectively in the said oil<br>
compositions.<br><br>
Bread cubes were fried in the oil composition (09) prepared as described In example 9 as<br>
well as in reference oil (without additi-vcs), were cooled and packed in stainless steel<br>
containers.<br>
The product was stored for a period of 30 days under ambient conditions and was evaluated<br>
at a time interval of 10,20 and 30 days by a sensory panel.<br>
The flavor quality and crispness of bread  fried in said oil composition was superior to<br>
that of bread fried in Reference  oil.<br>
The  oil composition (o9) prepared as described in example 9, used fox frying bread<br>
cubes were analyzed for its Vitamin content. Data indicated that  upto 50 % more<br>
vitamins was retained during frying  in the oil composition than in the Refeience oil<br>
(without additives).<br>
A stability study was initialed where the  Reference oil(oil withoni additives) and ail<br>
compositions ( (09) ) ptepaied a s described in Example 9, were kept nndei storage<br>
conditions of ambient temperatutet (acceletated: 38 degrees and 90% humidity) in<br>
PET bottles. for ca period of 1- Year.<br>
The impact of storage on the oil uptake was evaluated by frying bread cubes in test oil as<br>
