				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PROVIDING IN-BAND WIRELESS<br>
BACKHAUL<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to wireless communications<br>
and, in particular, to providing in-band wireless backhaul for wireless<br>
10 communication systems.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 802.16-based<br>
systems, such as 802.16e WiMAX (Wireless Maximize) systems, have<br>
relatively small cell radii. When such systems are designed for continuous<br>
coverage, cellular-type applications, there is a need to connect a relatively<br>
large number of radio sites in each given area to the greater serving network.<br>
Connection to the greater serving network is via so-called "backhaul"<br>
connections, each of which can require substantial expense. Such "backhaul"<br>
expenses raise the startup cost that a prospective operator often must be<br>
willing to bear before building and establishing a large customer base.<br>
To reduce startup costs associated with backhaul, the industry has<br>
turned to a couple of wireless approaches. The first approach is to multiplex<br>
the traffic from several radio sectors at a site and then use a much higher<br>
speed radio at the site to backhaul the traffic to yet another site. This typically<br>
requires additional multiplexing hardware, high bandwidth radios and a<br>
separate frequency band. A second approach under consideration is to further<br>
multiplex the traffic from several sites to one master site using a second<br>
frequency band wide enough to multiplex several sites worth of traffic.<br>
However, this type of approach is believed to require a very fast Media<br>
 <br>
Access Control (MAC) protocol, which is believed to have not yet been<br>
developed.<br>
Accordingly, it would be desirable to have a method and apparatus for<br>
providing wireless backhaul that may reduce operator startup costs while<br>
avoiding some of the drawbacks present in the prior art approaches.<br>

the art will appreciate that various modifications and changes may be made to<br>

and scope of the present invention. Thus, the specification and drawings are<br>
to be regarded as illustrative and exemplary rather than restrictive or all-<br>
encompassing, and all such modifications to the specific embodiments<br>
described below are intended to be included within the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Detailed Description of Embodiments<br>
Various embodiments are described to address the need for providing<br>
wireless backhaul that may reduce operator startup costs while avoiding some<br>
of the drawbacks present in the prior art approaches. Generally expressed,<br>
the wireless network equipment (WNE) of a collector cell provides access to a<br>
backhaul network to one or more neighboring cells via in-band wireless<br>
signaling. Given the frequency bands used by the collector cell WNE for<br>
 <br>
communication with remote units, one portion of each band used for user<br>
traffic while another portion of each band is used for backhaul traffic. Having<br>
backhaul and user traffic share the assigned frequency bands can eliminate<br>
the need to license additional bands for wireless backhaul. Moreover, utilizing<br>
a portion of the existing, in-band orthogonal channels may be more spectrally<br>
efficient than using a separate radio in the same band.<br>
The present invention can be more fully understood with reference to<br>
FIGs. 1-8. FIG. 1 is a block diagram depiction of a wireless communication<br>
system 100 in accordance with multiple embodiments of the present<br>
invention. At present, standards bodies such as OMA (Open Mobile Alliance),<br>
3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project), 3GPP2 (3rd Generation<br>
Partnership Project 2) and IEEE 802 are developing standards specifications<br>
for wireless telecommunications systems. (These groups may be contacted<br>
via	http://www.openmobilealliance.com,	http://www.3qpp.org/,<br>
http://www.3qpp2.com/ and http://www.ieee802.org/. respectively.)<br>
Communication system 100 represents a system having an architecture in<br>
accordance with IEEE 802.16 technologies, suitably modified to implement<br>
the present invention. Alternative embodiments of the present invention may<br>
be implemented in communication systems that employ other or additional<br>
technologies such as, but not limited to, those described in the other IEEE<br>
802 specifications, the 3GPP specifications and/or those described in the<br>
3GPP2 specifications.<br>
Communication system 100 is depicted in a very generalized manner,<br>
shown to comprise packet network 151, wireless network equipment (WNE)<br>
121 and 122, and remote units 101-104. Those skilled in the art will recognize<br>
that FIG. 1 does not depict all of the network equipment necessary for system<br>
100 to operate commercially but only those system components and logical<br>
entities particularly relevant to the description of embodiments herein. For<br>
example, depending on the embodiment, WNE 121 and 122 may each<br>
represent a base transceiver station (BTS), an access point (AP), and/or a<br>
higher order device such as a wideband base station (WBS) or WLAN<br>
(wireless local area network) station or even a radio access network (RAN) or<br>
 <br>
access network (AN); however, none of these devices are specifically shown<br>
in FIG. 1.<br>
Remote units 101-104 and WNE 121 and 122 are shown<br>
communicating via technology-dependent, wireless interfaces such as the<br>
802.16e air interface. Remote units, subscriber stations (SSs) or user<br>
equipment (LJEs), may be thought of as mobile stations (MSs); however,<br>
remote units are not necessarily mobile nor able to move. In addition, remote<br>
unit platforms are known to refer to a wide variety of consumer electronic<br>
platforms such as, but not limited to, mobile stations (MSs), access terminals<br>
(ATs), terminal equipment, mobile devices, gaming devices, personal<br>
computers, and personal digital assistants (PDAs). In particular, remote units<br>
101-104 comprise a processing unit (not shown) and transceiver (not shown).<br>
Depending on the embodiment, remote units 101-104 may additionally<br>
comprise a keypad (not shown), a speaker (not shown), a microphone (not<br>
shown), and a display (not shown). Processing units, transceivers, keypads,<br>
speakers, microphones, and displays as used in remote units are all well-<br>
known in the art.<br>
In general, components such as processing units and transceivers are<br>
well-known. For example, processing units are known to comprise basic<br>
components such as, but neither limited to nor necessarily requiring,<br>
microprocessors, microcontrollers, memory devices, application-specific<br>
integrated circuits (ASICs), and/or logic circuitry. Such components are<br>
typically adapted to implement algorithms and/or protocols that have been<br>
expressed using high-level design languages or descriptions, expressed using<br>
computer instructions, expressed using signaling flow diagrams, and/or<br>
expressed using logic flow diagrams.<br>
Thus, given a high-level description, an algorithm, a logic flow, a<br>
messaging / signaling flow, and/or a protocol specification, those skilled in the<br>
art are aware of the many design and development techniques available to<br>
implement a processing unit that performs the given logic. Therefore, WNE<br>
121 and 122 represent known devices that have been adapted, in accordance<br>
 <br>
with the description herein, to implement multiple embodiments of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Furthermore, those skilled in the art will recognize that aspects of the<br>
present invention may be implemented in and/or across various physical<br>
components and none are necessarily limited to single platform<br>
implementations. For example, the WNE may be implemented in or across<br>
one or more networked or otherwise communicatively coupled devices, such<br>
as communication infrastructure devices and/or wireless devices. Also, WNE<br>
and remote unit transceivers are referred to throughout the present<br>
application as "transceiver"; however, "transceiver," as used herein, should<br>
more generally be understood to refer to transceiver equipment which may be<br>
embodied to include more than one physical transceiver device.<br>
First, to provide specific examples of some of the different aspects of<br>
particular embodiments of the present invention, one implementation (referred<br>
to as "BackLite") will be described in detail below with reference to FIGs. 2-8.<br>
FIGs. 2 and 4 depict a dual-antenna system and FIG. 3 depicts frame<br>
processing, all in accordance with the BackLite implementation and multiple<br>
embodiments of the present invention. With BackLite, as with various other<br>
embodiments of the present invention, the startup costs associated with<br>
installing an 802.16e system can be reduced. Also, having backhaul and user<br>
traffic share the assigned frequency band can eliminate, the need to license<br>
another band for wireless backhaul.<br>
In this approach, some of the orthogonal channels, which are not<br>
needed for the initial system deployment, are used for backhaul traffic.<br>
Utilizing some of the existing orthogonal channels is much more spectrally<br>
efficient than placing a separate radio in the same band. Thus, in BackLite,<br>
some of the receive channels pick up regular traffic from users and utilize<br>
predefined transmit channels to relay the information to a "collection site"<br>
using the same base equipment. In a similar manner, some predefined<br>
receive channels catch traffic from the collection site meant for users and<br>
transmit it on normal traffic channels down to the users, again using the same<br>
base equipment. The collection site uses slightly modified Customer Premises<br>
 <br>
Equipment (CPE) 410, referred to as "CPE+", to move the backhaul traffic in<br>
an out of the larger communications network.<br>
In general, a transmitter and a receiver at a BackLite base station<br>
(a.k.a., wideband base station or cellular access point) are used<br>
simultaneously for subscriber traffic and wireless backhaul. In each TDD (time<br>
division duplex) burst, part of the uplink and downlink sub-bursts is reserved<br>
for backhaul traffic. For backhauling uplink traffic, the uplink traffic 210 (see<br>
FIGs. 2 and 3) from the subscriber units is captured and decoded by the<br>
receiver, stored in a buffer 305, then packed into part 310 of the downlink<br>
burst. When the downlink burst is sent, it goes out both antenna systems<br>
simultaneously, one (access antenna system 202) pointed at the traffic<br>
coverage area and one (narrowbeam antenna system 201) along a path to a<br>
backhaul collection point (which is co-located with another base station). A<br>
receiver at the collection site, built like a Customer Premises Equipment<br>
(CPE), knows that part of the sub-burst dedicated to backhaul traffic and<br>
decodes it, and then sends it along another higher rate backhaul system to<br>
the larger network. In similar manner, downlink traffic 211 is transmitted back<br>
along this same path by the modified CPE, where the base station receiver,<br>
which has some of its capacity allocated to backhaul, captures it and, through<br>
a buffer 306, packs the information into the part 311 of the downlink sub-burst<br>
dedicated to subscriber traffic.<br>
Stated differently, the essence of what happens is that the base<br>
receiver collects information from both the user uplink traffic 210 and<br>
information from the backhaul collection point which contains the user<br>
downlink traffic 211. Information collected from user traffic needs to move to a<br>
backhaul collecting point (backhaul uplink traffic 250) and is thus inserted in<br>
the transmit burst part 220 of the timeslot, using the "channels" reserved for<br>
backhaul traffic. Subscribers are not assigned these channels. Information for<br>
users that needs to be sent on the downlink will come from the CPE+<br>
(backhaul downlink traffic 211), again received by the base receiver, and<br>
inserted into downlink channels reserved for user traffic 251. This to/from<br>
arrangement is the backhaul. When the transmit part of the timeslot is sent, it<br>
 <br>
is listened to by both the subscribers and the CPE+. Their transmissions will<br>
come from different antenna systems, a directional one for backhaul, and the<br>
typical access antenna system for subscriber coverage. The subscribers will<br>
find and decode their traffic channels, and the CPE+ will find and decode its<br>
backhaul channels.<br>
Backhaul via BackLite is accomplished by utilizing part of the transmit<br>
and receive TDD half-frames for traffic moving to and away from each base<br>
site, and therefore all access traffic and backhaul traffic are in the same<br>
frequency band. Traffic intended for subscriber devices within the range of the<br>
WBS co-located with the collection point is sent from the network directly to<br>
the unmodified WBS 411 where it is inserted in the downlink channel to the<br>
subscriber units. Information targeted for subscriber units located in the<br>
remote sites whose backhaul is served by the collection point is routed from<br>
the network to the CPE+ 410 where it is transmitted in the uplink channel to<br>
the modified WBS at the remote site. From there, the data are routed<br>
internally from the receive part of the burst in the modified WBS and inserted<br>
in the downlink channel to the target subscriber devices in channels dedicated<br>
to access.<br>
In the reverse direction, subscriber data intended to be sent into the<br>
network is sent in the uplink channel from the subscriber to the modified WBS<br>
where it is captured in the receive part of the burst and inserted into the<br>
downlink channel toward the CPE+ 410 at the collection point, then delivered<br>
to the router 412 that sends the information to the "system backhaul." Access<br>
data from subscriber devices served by the unmodified WBS 411 that is co-<br>
located with the collection point CPE+ devices 410 is sent on an access<br>
channel uplink to the WBS and delivered to the router 412 into the "system<br>
backhaul" network.<br>
Note that at the modified WBSs, the access and backhaul traffic are<br>
both received on the receive half of the TDD burst, while the access and<br>
backhaul traffic are both transmitted on the Tx part of the burst. Physically,<br>
both access and backhaul traffic go in and out simultaneously on both the<br>
access and narrowbeam (high gain) backhaul antenna systems. But because<br>
 <br>
subscribers do not look for the backhaul channels and the CPE+ does not<br>
look for the access channels, and because the antenna systems are<br>
effectively isolated from each other, access traffic and backhaul can share the<br>
same carrier.<br>
Note also that the collection points are made up entirely of CPE+s that<br>
exclusively carry backhaul traffic. At the collection point locations, the<br>
unmodified WBSs handle the local traffic. Also, other than combining different<br>
traffic and backhaul channels together in the TDD burst, which should not<br>
require any special processing of the channels, access and backhaul traffic<br>
need not be combined elsewhere in the system.<br>
A CPE+ has the same Tx and Rx characteristics as a typical CPE,<br>
except that a CPE+ is capable of extracting several channels, not just one.<br>
This is because it is transmitting and receiving the entire backhaul traffic for a<br>
sector at the collection point. Collection points are co-located with some of the<br>
WBSs. In a 1:3:3 plan, for example, one in four WBSs has a collection point<br>
associated with it. Each collection point, in a 1:3:3 plan, consists of 9 CPE+s<br>
and lines connecting them to some router to the next level of backhaul (e.g.,<br>
T1, OC-3, another wireless backhaul, etc.) The CPE+s use high gain,<br>
narrowbeam antennas and do not need to share the WBS antenna systems.<br>
Physically the collection points could be anywhere, but for convenience (and<br>
due to the frequency reuse plan) they are co-located with a WBS. Only on<br>
non-collection point WBSs are a narrowbeam and access antenna system<br>
connected together for use by the WBS transceiver. At the collection points,<br>
the backhaul part of the system, embodied by the CPE+s, and the WBS need<br>
not be connected at all.<br>
Changes to a WBS recommended to implement a BackLite system<br>
include the following. A buffering mechanism should be attached on a data<br>
bus from the uplink channel decoder to capture all up link access traffic<br>
coming from system subscribers. All of this traffic will be backhauled via the<br>
downlink part of the TDD burst. This downlink is simultaneously going<br>
physically "down" and "across" to the collection point. Since the backhaul<br>
"downlink" channels are not assigned to users, they are invisible to users,<br>
 <br>
even though they are emitted from the access antenna system. Since this<br>
backhaul traffic probably cannot be transmitted immediately due to hardware<br>
and software constraints, it must be held and placed in the channels assigned<br>
to backhaul on the downlink TDD half burst at the first available downlink TDD<br>
burst.<br>
Similarly, a buffering mechanism should be attached on a data bus<br>
from the uplink channel decoder, to capture all backhaul data traffic from the<br>
CPE+ coming from the collection point on the narrowbeam antenna. These<br>
two buffer mechanisms should know how channels are allocated between<br>
access and backhaul.<br>
The Tx/Rx antenna system needs to have added to it a narrowbeam,<br>
high gain antenna system for backhaul. The transceiver is attached to both<br>
the access antenna system and the narrowbeam antenna system. It is<br>
preferred that most of the power go to/from the access antenna system by<br>
using a connector and a tap for the backhaul narrowbeam antenna. It should<br>
be determined how low the power to the backhaul antenna can be by using a<br>
combination of antenna gain, point-to-point propagation and low-order<br>
modulation. Two sectors may possibly be combined onto one narrowbeam<br>
antenna in some implementations.<br>
Changes to a CPE recommended to implement a BackLite CPE+<br>
include the following. It is the CPE+ that is connected to the ingress/egress for<br>
the system. The collection point is independent of the co-located WBS as far<br>
as radio processing is concerned. However, they may of course share<br>
electrical, tower and the like. Each CPE+ needs to have processing power<br>
enough to move the traffic for its sector in and out after FFT (Fast Fourier<br>
transform) and other processing, whereas a CPE is currently designed to<br>
handle the traffic of a single user.<br>
The CPE+'s narrowbeam antenna will sometimes be faced in the same<br>
direction as the adjacent channel, and therefore some isolation may be<br>
required at the collection point for these two antennas. Also, CPE+s may<br>
share a narrowbeam antenna. Either way, more stringent filtering than that for<br>
 <br>
a consumer CPE may be required. Additionally, the signals from the CPE+s to<br>
the WBS receivers need to be time aligned with the received access signals.<br>
IEEE 802.16e allows considerable flexibility in the setting of operating<br>
parameters. The BackLite implementation can take advantage of some of this<br>
flexibility. Depending upon the exact TDD burst time settings, and the cell<br>
sizes used in a particular system design, a number of parameters can be<br>
advantageously manipulated. As has been mentioned, backhaul is done to<br>
and from a collection point co-located with a base station. Propagation to and<br>
from that collection point will, by design, be further than a cell radius, and<br>
hence will experience delay and attenuation different than that in the user<br>
coverage area.<br>
It is expected that the backhaul antenna system will be mounted higher<br>
than the coverage area antennas or at least aimed horizontally toward the<br>
collection point. The propagation time will be longer (at least twice as long),<br>
but the attenuation constant will be lower. It is likely that the popular 70%<br>
downlink 30% uplink split of the TDD frame will need to be closer to 50-50%.<br>
It could be that higher order modulation will be used in the backhaul channels<br>
to take up less time in each sub-burst. There will be a power loss at any<br>
splitter used to connect the two antenna systems to the transceiver. However,<br>
the much lower propagation constant, and the directional gain of the backhaul<br>
antenna system can make up for the losses. If the extra propagation time from<br>
the backhaul collection point interferes with the burst length/guard time of the<br>
individual cells, the backhaul transmit burst may have to be shortened.<br>
Although the same frequency bands are used for both access and<br>
backhaul traffic, the transmit and receive paths for backhaul use physically<br>
separate narrow beam antennas pointed to create a different frequency reuse<br>
pattern than the traffic frequency reuse pattern. FIGs. 5-8 provide some, but<br>
not all examples, of the possible frequency plans that may be used. FIG. 5 is<br>
a block diagram depiction of an idealized 1:3:3 frequency plan (each cell<br>
having 3 sectors and using 3 unique frequency bands) in accordance with<br>
multiple embodiments of the present invention. Frequency plan 500<br>
represents a basic 802.16e frequency plan (although it is not limited to<br>
 <br>
802.16e by any means) with the addition of a backhaul collector cell (shown<br>
by the small circle at the cell center). The collector cell includes wireless<br>
coverage areas 501-503, which correspond to a first, a second and a third<br>
sector of the collector cell, respectively.<br>
Since frequency plan 500 is a 1:3:3 frequency plan, each cell uses<br>
three unique frequency bands, a first, a second and a third frequency band.<br>
Sectors of each cell that are labeled with a reference number ending in a "1"<br>
use the first frequency band, sectors labeled with a reference number ending<br>
in a "2" use the second frequency band, and sectors labeled with a reference<br>
number ending in a "3" use the third frequency band. The dashed-line arrows<br>
depict the direction of the narrowbeam antennas used for transmitting<br>
backhaul traffic from each neighbor cell to the collector cell (and to other<br>
collector cells not shown). In frequency plan 500, all of the neighbor cells<br>
transmitting backhaul traffic to the collector cell are also adjacent to the<br>
collector cell, but this need not necessarily be the case with other frequency<br>
plans.<br>
As depicted in FIG. 5, the six neighbor cells each transmit and receive<br>
backhaul traffic for one or two of their respective sectors to and from the<br>
collector cell. Furthermore, the backhaul traffic from each sector is transmitted<br>
and received using the frequency band (more specifically, the backhaul<br>
portion of the frequency band) associated with that individual sector. For<br>
example, backhaul traffic for sector 513 is transmitted and received, to and<br>
from the collector cell using the third frequency band. Thus, as depicted in<br>
FIG. 5, backhaul traffic for sectors 513, 521, 523, 531, 541, 542, 552, 562 and<br>
563 is transmitted and received, to and from the collector cell using a<br>
backhaul portion of the frequency band indicated by the sector's ending<br>
reference number digit.<br>
It can be seen from FIG. 5 that the backhaul distance in each case is 2r<br>
and the interference distance is therefore 6r, where r is the nominal cell<br>
radius. The collector cell handles traffic from 12 sectors, its own three and<br>
nine others. While this traffic may come from seven physical base stations<br>
(depending on the embodiment), it represents the traffic of four cells. Also,<br>
 <br>
while there are nine carriers impinging on a single collection point, the nine<br>
may be isolated from each other by the directionality of the narrowbeam<br>
antennas used. In frequency plan 500, the angular separation between them<br>
is 60 degrees, which is wider than required. However, in some cases, for<br>
geographical or propagation reasons, it may be necessary to change the<br>
polarization of some of the narrowbeam antennas to increase the isolation<br>
between paths on the same frequency, for example among 542, 552 and 562.<br>
FIG. 6 is a block diagram depiction of an idealized 1:4:2 frequency plan<br>
in accordance with multiple embodiments of the present invention. Frequency<br>
plan 600 represents an alternative frequency plan with the addition of<br>
backhaul collector cells (shown by the small circles at various cell centers).<br>
The collector cell in the center includes wireless coverage areas 601, 651,<br>
602 and 652, which correspond to a first, a second, a third and a fourth sector<br>
of the collector cell, respectively.<br>
Since frequency plan 600 is a 1:4:2 frequency plan, each cell has four<br>
sectors but uses two unique frequency bands, a first and a second frequency<br>
band. Sectors of each cell that are labeled with a reference number below 650<br>
use the first frequency band, while sectors labeled with a reference number<br>
greater than 650 use the second frequency band. The dashed-line arrows<br>
depict the direction of the narrowbeam antennas used for transmitting<br>
backhaul traffic from each neighbor cell to the collector cells (and to other<br>
collector cells not shown). In frequency plan 600, all of the neighbor cells<br>
transmitting backhaul traffic to the collector cells are also adjacent to the<br>
target collector cells, but this need not necessarily be the case with other<br>
frequency plans.<br>
As depicted in FIG. 6, the four neighbor cells (left, right, top and<br>
bottom) of the central collector cell each transmit and receive backhaul traffic<br>
for one of their respective sectors to and from the collector cell. Furthermore,<br>
the backhaul traffic from each sector is transmitted and received using the<br>
frequency band (more specifically, the backhaul portion of the frequency<br>
band) associated with that individual sector. For example, backhaul traffic for<br>
sector 656 is transmitted and received, to and from the collector cell using the<br>
 <br>
second frequency band. Thus, as depicted in FIG. 6, backhaul traffic for<br>
sectors 656, 610, 665 and 611 is transmitted and received, to and from the<br>
collector cell using a backhaul portion of the frequency band indicated by the<br>
sector's reference number.<br>
FIG. 7 is a block diagram depiction of an idealized 1:6:6 frequency plan<br>
with collector cells aligned across the centers of sectors in accordance with<br>
multiple embodiments of the present invention. Frequency plan 700<br>
represents another alternative frequency plan with the addition of a backhaul<br>
collector cell (shown by the small circle at the cell center). The collector cell<br>
includes wireless coverage areas 701-706, which correspond to a first, a<br>
second, a third, a fourth, a fifth and a sixth sector of the collector cell,<br>
respectively.<br>
Since frequency plan 700 is a 1:6:6 frequency plan, each cell has six<br>
sectors and uses six unique frequency bands, a first, a second, a third, a<br>
fourth, a fifth and a sixth frequency band. Sectors of each cell that are labeled<br>
with a reference number ending in a "1" use the first frequency band, sectors<br>
labeled with a reference number ending in a "2" use the second frequency<br>
band, sectors labeled with a reference number ending in a "3" use the third<br>
frequency band, sectors labeled with a reference number ending in a "4" use<br>
the fourth frequency band, sectors labeled with a reference number ending in<br>
a "5" use the fifth frequency band, and sectors labeled with a reference<br>
number ending in a "6" use the sixth frequency band. The dashed-line arrows<br>
depict the direction of the narrowbeam antennas used for transmitting<br>
backhaul traffic from each neighbor cell to the collector cell (and to other<br>
collector cells not shown). In frequency plan 700, all of the neighbor cells<br>
transmitting backhaul traffic to the collector cell are also adjacent to the<br>
collector cell, but this need not necessarily be the case with other frequency<br>
plans.<br>
As depicted in FIG. 7, the six neighbor cells each transmit and receive<br>
backhaul traffic for three of their respective sectors to and from the collector<br>
cell. Furthermore, the backhaul traffic from each sector is transmitted and<br>
received using the frequency band (more specifically, the backhaul portion of<br>
 <br>
the frequency band) associated with that individual sector. For example,<br>
backhaul traffic for sector 714 is transmitted and received, to and from the<br>
collector cell using the fourth frequency band. Thus, as depicted in FIG. 7,<br>
backhaul traffic for sectors 713-715, 724-726, 731, 735, 736, 741, 742, 746,<br>
751-753 and 762-764 is transmitted and received, to and from the collector<br>
cell using a backhaul portion of the frequency band indicated by the sector's<br>
ending reference number digit.<br>
FIG. 8 is a block diagram depiction of an idealized 1:6:6 frequency plan<br>
with collector cells aligned along the edges of sectors in accordance with<br>
multiple embodiments of the present invention. Frequency plan 800<br>
represents another alternative frequency plan with the addition of a backhaul<br>
collector cell (shown by the small circle at the cell center). The collector cell<br>
includes wireless coverage areas 801-806, which correspond to a first, a<br>
second, a third, a fourth, a fifth and a sixth sector of the collector cell,<br>
respectively.<br>
Since frequency plan 800 is a 1:6:6 frequency plan, each cell has six<br>
sectors and uses six unique frequency bands, a first, a second, a third, a<br>
fourth, a fifth and a sixth frequency band. Sectors of each cell that are labeled<br>
with a reference number ending in a "1" use the first frequency band, sectors<br>
labeled with a reference number ending in a "2" use the second frequency<br>
band, sectors labeled with a reference number ending in a "3" use the third<br>
frequency band, sectors labeled with a reference number ending in a "4" use<br>
the fourth frequency band, sectors labeled with a reference number ending in<br>
a "5" use the fifth frequency band, and sectors labeled with a reference<br>
number ending in a "6" use the sixth frequency band. The dashed-line arrows<br>
depict the direction of the narrowbeam antennas used for transmitting<br>
backhaul traffic from each neighbor cell to the collector cell (and to other<br>
collector cells not shown). In frequency plan 800, all of the neighbor cells<br>
transmitting backhaul traffic to the collector cell are also adjacent to the<br>
collector cell, but this need not necessarily be the case with other frequency<br>
plans.<br>
 <br>
As depicted in FIG. 8, the six neighbor cells each transmit and receive<br>
backhaul traffic for two of their respective sectors (the sectors with asterisks,<br>
e.g.) to and from the collector cell. Furthermore, the backhaul traffic from each<br>
sector is transmitted and received using the frequency band (more<br>
specifically, the backhaul portion of the frequency band) associated with that<br>
individual sector. For example, backhaul traffic for sector 814 is transmitted<br>
and received, to and from the collector cell using the fourth frequency band.<br>
Thus, as depicted in FIG. 8, backhaul traffic for sectors 813, 814, 825, 826,<br>
835, 836, 841, 846, 851, 852, 862 and 863 is transmitted and received, to and<br>
from the collector cell using a backhaul portion of the frequency band<br>
indicated by the sector's ending reference number digit.<br>
A detailed description of the BackLite implementation and some<br>
potential frequency plans has been provided above. Operation of some more<br>
generalized embodiments of the present invention occurs substantially as<br>
follows, with reference to FIG. 1. Wireless network equipment (WNE) 121 and<br>
122 respectively represent collector cell equipment and neighbor cell<br>
equipment. As collector cell equipment, WNE 121 includes network interface<br>
127 which provides connectivity to a backhaul network such as packet<br>
network 151. As neighbor cell equipment, WNE 122 utilizes wireless backhaul<br>
signaling with WNE 121 to obtain connectivity to the backhaul network.<br>
Processing unit 126 of WNE 122 receives uplink traffic from remote<br>
units 103 and/or 104 within the wireless coverage area of WNE 122 using<br>
transceiver 124 and a user portion of at least one frequency band. Remote<br>
units 103 and 104 may be in the same coverage area or sector of WNE 122<br>
or in different coverage areas of WNE 122, and depending on the frequency<br>
plan being used, they may in either case be using the same or different<br>
frequency bands for communication with WNE 122.<br>
Also, depending on the particular embodiment, the uplink traffic may be<br>
transmitted in uplink frames, perhaps OFDM (orthogonal frequency division<br>
multiplexing) uplink frames. In the case in which OFDM signaling is used, the<br>
frequency bands include OFDM subchannels (i.e., frequency subchannels).<br>
Thus, the user portion of a frequency band may comprise a set of the OFDM<br>
 <br>
subchannels. For a receive frame, then, the user portion would be the user<br>
subchannels of the receive frame.<br>
Processing unit 126 of WNE 122 then transmits the uplink traffic from<br>
the remote units to WNE 121 using transceiver 124 and a backhaul portion of<br>
the one or more frequency bands used to receive the uplink traffic from the<br>
remote units. In the OFDM embodiments, the backhaul portion of the one or<br>
more frequency bands may also comprise a set of the OFDM subchannels in<br>
these frequency bands. For a transmit frame, then, the backhaul portion<br>
would be the backhaul subchannels of the transmit frame.<br>
Processing unit 126 of WNE 122 also receives downlink traffic from<br>
WNE 121 using transceiver 124 and a backhaul portion of the one or more<br>
frequency bands used for the targeted remote units. In the OFDM<br>
embodiments, the backhaul portion of the one or more frequency bands may<br>
also comprise a set of the OFDM subchannels in these frequency bands.<br>
Also, for a given receive frame, the user set of subchannels and the backhaul<br>
set of subchannels would be non-overlapping.<br>
Processing unit 126 of WNE 122 then transmits the downlink traffic<br>
from WNE 121 to the targeted remote units using transceiver 124 and a user<br>
portion of the one or more frequency bands used for the targeted remote<br>
units. Again, in the OFDM embodiments and for a given transmit frame the<br>
user set of subchannels (the user portion of a frequency band) and the<br>
backhaul set of subchannels would be non-overlapping.<br>
Thus, processing unit 125 of WNE 121 transmits and receives traffic to<br>
and from WNE 122 using transceiver 123 and a backhaul portion of one or<br>
more frequency bands. The received backhaul traffic destined for the<br>
backhaul network is then forwarded by processing unit 125 on to network 151<br>
via network interface 127. Processing unit 125 of WNE 121 also, of course,<br>
transmits and receives traffic to and from remote units 101 and 102, e.g.,<br>
within the wireless coverage area of WNE 121 using transceiver 123 and a<br>
user portion of one or more frequency bands.<br>
As described above with respect to embodiments such as the BackLite<br>
embodiments, transceivers 123 and 124 may comprise both access antenna<br>
 <br>
systems and narrowbeam antenna systems. In these embodiments,<br>
communication between transceivers 123 and 124 and their respective<br>
remote units would utilize the access antenna systems, while communication<br>
between transceivers 123 and 124 (i.e., between collector and neighbor cell<br>
equipment) would utilize the narrowbeam antenna systems.<br>

17.	The WNE of claim 16, wherein the processing unit is further adapted to<br>
transmit both the user portion and the backhaul portion of the at least one<br>
frequency band using each of the at least one access antenna and each of<br>
the at least one narrowbeam antenna.<br>
 <br>
18.	Wireless network equipment (WNE) comprising:<br>
a transceiver;<br>
a processing unit, communicatively coupled to the transceiver,<br>
adapted to receive uplink traffic from remote units within a<br>
wireless coverage area of a cell using the transceiver and<br>
a user portion of at least one frequency band,<br>
adapted to receive downlink traffic from WNE of a collector cell<br>
using the transceiver and a backhaul portion of the at<br>
least one frequency band,<br>
adapted to transmit the uplink traffic from the remote units to the<br>
WNE of the collector cell using the transceiver and a<br>
backhaul portion of the at least one frequency band, and<br>
adapted to transmit the downlink traffic from the WNE of the<br>
collector cell to the remote units using the transceiver and<br>
a user portion of the at least one frequency band.<br>
19.	The WNE of claim 18,<br>
wherein the transceiver comprises at least one access antenna and at<br>

wherein the processing unit is further adapted to receive uplink traffic<br>
from the remote units using the at least one access antenna,<br>
wherein the processing unit is further adapted to receive downlink<br>
traffic from the WNE of the collector cell using the at least one narrowbeam<br>
antenna,<br>
wherein the processing unit is further adapted to transmit the uplink<br>
traffic from the remote units to the WNE of the collector cell using the at least<br>
one narrowbeam antenna, and<br>
wherein the processing unit is further adapted to transmit the downlink<br>
traffic from the WNE of the collector cell to the remote units using the at least<br>
one access antenna.<br>
 <br>
20. The WNE of claim 19, wherein the processing unit is further adapted to<br>
transmit both the user portion and the backhaul portion of the at least one<br>
frequency band using each of the at least one access antenna and each of<br>
the at least one narrowbeam antenna.<br>
<br>
Various embodiments are described to address the need for providing wireless backhaul that may reduce operator<br>
startup costs while avoiding some of the drawbacks present in the prior art approaches. Generally expressed, the wireless network<br>
equipment (WNE) (121) of a collector cell provides access to a backhaul network (151) to one or more neighboring cells (122) via<br>
in-band wireless signaling. Given the frequency bands used by the collector cell WNE for communication with remote units, one<br>
portion of each band used for user traffic while another portion of each band is used for backhaul traffic. Having backhaul and<br>
user traffic share the assigned frequency bands can eliminate the need to license additional bands for wireless backhaul. Moreover,<br>
utilizing a portion of the existing, in-band orthogonal channels may be more spectrally efficient than using a separate radio in the<br>
same band.<br>
