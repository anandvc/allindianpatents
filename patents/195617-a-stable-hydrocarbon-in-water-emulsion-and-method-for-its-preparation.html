(DETAILED DESCRIPTION)<br>
The invention relates to a stable hydrocarbon-in-water emulsion, to a surfactant additive which is useful for forming the emulsion and to a method for forming emulsions using the surfactant additive to activate natural surfactant contained in the hydrocarbon.<br>
According to the invention, stable hydrocarbon in water emulsions are formed and provided using a surfactant additive which is both environmentally and economically<br>
7<br><br>
desirable.  The preferred emulsions are those formed of a hydrocarbon bitumen, ideally bitumen such as Cerro Negro   bitumen which includes natural surfactants.  The surfactant additive of the present invention advantageously serves to activate the natural surfactants of the bitumen so as to form the desired hydrocarbon-in-water emulsion and further serves to stabilize the emulsion against factors such as variation in aqueous phase pH and/or salinity.    <br>

Bitumen such as that described in Table 1 above is used in preparation of a hydrocarbon in water emulsion which is sold by Bitor, VS.A. under the trademark Orimulsion, and this emulsion is suitable for combustion as a liquid fuel and other end uses such as transportation to a refinery for further processing and the like.  According to the present invention, a similar emulsion is provided using a surfactant<br>
9<br><br>
additive which provides the emulsion with desirable rheological properties and stability, and which additive is both economically and environmentally desirable.<br>
Furthermore, although conventionally formed emulsions have been found to be sensitive to electrolyte content in the emulsion water of greater than about 10 ppm, emulsions formed using the surfactant additive of the present invention can be prepared using water having an electrolyte content up to about 100 ppm.  This advantageously allows for use of a greater spectrum of water for preparing the emulsion of the present invention.<br>
Most naturally occurring viscous hydrocarbon material, including Cerro Negro bitumen as described above, contains inactive surfactant including carboxylic acids, phenols and esters which, under proper conditions, can be activated as surfactants.  According to the present invention, a surfactant additive is provided which activates these natural surfactants, and which further serves to stabilize an emulsion formed using the natural surfactants so as to reduce the sensitivity of the emulsion to variation in pH and water salinity.  Further, the surfactant additive of the present invention can be used to replace environmentally undesirable surfactant additives such as ethoxylated alkyl phenol.<br>
According to the invention, a surfactant additive is provided which comprises an amine and an ethoxylated<br>
10<br><br><br>
alcohol.  In accordance with the invention, the amine has  been found to activate the natural surfactants from bitumen, and the ethoxylated alcohol portion serves to stabilize the emulsion and reduce the sensitivity of the emulsion to variations in pH and changes in salinity in the aqueous phase of the emulsion.  Furthermore, and as will be set forth below, the surfactant additive of the present invention can be used to provide stable emulsions using amounts of the amine and alcohol portions sufficiently small that the surfactant additive is desirable from an economic<br>
standpoint as well.	<br>
or its derivatives In accordance with the invention, the amine_/is        <br>
preferably selected from the group consisting of monoethanolamine, ethylenediamine, ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, propylamine, sec-propylamine, dipropylamine,<br>
isopropylamine, butylamine, sec-butylamine,	<br>
tetramethylammonium hydroxide, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide        and mixtures_thereof.  Preferably, the amine is an ethanolamine, most preferably monoethanolamine.<br>
The ethoxylated alcohol component of the surfactant additive of the present invention is preferably selected from the group consisting of polyethoxylated C12-C14, saturated polyethoxylated C16-C18, unsaturated polyethoxylated C16-C18 and mixtures thereof most preferably polyethoxylated tridecanol (C13).<br><br>
11<br><br>
One particularly well suited ethoxylated alcohol for use in accordance with the present invention is a<br>
polyethoxylated tridecanol provided by Hoechst de Venezuela<br>
under the trademark Genapol X-159 which has physical properties as follows:  hydrophilic and lipophilic balance of 15.4; average number of moles, ethylene oxide, of 15; cloud point of 83°; 90% active.<br>
According to the invention, the emulsion is preferably provided having surfactant additive including amine in an amount of at least about 300 parts per million (ppm) (wt) and having ethoxylated alcohol in an amount of at least about 100 ppm (wt) with respect to the hydrocarbon phase. More preferably, amine has been found to be particularly effective at between about 500 ppm to about 1500 ppm, and most preferably at about 800 ppm.  Ethoxylated alcohol is preferably present between about 100 ppm to about 3000 ppm, and more preferably between about 500 ppm to about 1500 ppm, also based upon the weight with respect to the hydrocarbon phase.<br>
As set forth above, water can be used for the water phase of the emulsion having an electrolyte content greater than about 10 ppm, and up to about 100 ppm (wt) with respect to the water phase, thereby advantageously providing a greater pool of suitable water for use in making the emulsion.  The surfactant additive of the present invention<br>
12<br><br>
serves to maintain the stability of the emulsion despite the presence of the higher electrolyte content.<br>
Emulsions in accordance with the present invention are preferably provided having a ratio of hydrocarbon or bitumen phase to the water phase of between about 90:10 to about 70:30.  As will be discussed below in connection with the process for preparation of the emulsion, it is preferred to prepare an intermediate emulsion having a ratio of approximately 85:15, and to subsequently dilute the emulsion to a ratio of approximately 70:30.  These ratios are based upon the volume of hydrocarbon and water.<br>
The final emulsion of the present invention preferably has an average droplet size of less than or equal to about 30 microns, and a viscosity at 30°C and 1 sec-1 of less than or equal to about 1500 cp.<br>
The emulsion of the present invention is formed by mixing the bitumen with an aqueous or water phase and the surfactant additive with sufficient mixing energy to emulsify the mixture and provide an emulsion of the bitumen discontinuous phase in the aqueous continuous phase and having desired droplet size and viscosity.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, it has been found that stability of the resulting emulsion is enhanced by forming the emulsion in a two stage process wherein the first step comprises mixing the hydrocarbon or bitumen phase with a portion of the water phase haying an<br>
13<br><br>
electrolyte content less than or equal to about 10 ppm and the surfactant additive so as to form an intermediate emulsion.  In a second or subsequent stage, the intermediate] emulsion is diluted with the remainder of the desired aqueous or water phase which can have a higher electrolyte content, up to about 100 ppm, so as to provide the desired final stable hydrocarbon-in-water emulsion in accordance with the present invention.<br>
In the two stage process, the intermediate emulsion formation stage may be carried out so as to provide the desired intermediate emulsion with a ratio of bitumen to water by volume of about 90:10, more preferably about 85:15, and the dilution stage preferably includes diluting the intermediate emulsion to a final ratio of hydrocarbon to water by volume of about 70:30.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the surfactant additive per se in accordance with the present invention includes an amine and an ethoxylated alcohol, preferably in a ratio of the amine portion to the ethoxylated alcohol portion of between about 5:1 to about 1:2, more preferably between about 2:1 to about 1:2.<br>
As set forth above, the process of the present invention produces an emulsion having enhanced stability and reduced sensitivity to variations in pH and salinity as well as higher electrolyte content in the emulsion water.<br>
14<br><br>
The mixing step or steps of the present invention are <br>
preferably carried out so as to supply sufficient energy to the mixture to yield an emulsion having the desired physical characteristics of the end product, especially droplet size and viscosity.  In general, smaller droplet sizes require more mixing energy, larger concentration of surfactant additive, or both.  According to the invention, the emulsion is preferably mixed with sufficient mixing energy to yield an average droplet size of 30  µm or less.  Such an emulsion will have a viscosity of below about 1500 cp at 30°C and 1 sec-1.  For example, a conventional mixer may be used so as to mix the emulsion at a rate of at least about 500 rpm.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the surfactant additive of amine and ethoxylated alcohol is suitable in accordance with the invention for forming stable emulsions with desired rheological properties using amounts of amine and ethoxylated alcohol each of which are significantly less than the amount required to form an emulsion with either portion of the additive alone.  Furthermore, the sensitivity of the emulsion to variations in pH, divalent salt concentration fand/or/electrolyte content, typically a problem with emulsions formed by activating natural surfactant from the bitumen, is decreased in the emulsion formed in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The following examples further illustrate the advantageous features and characteristics of the emulsion,<br>
15<br><br>
process for forming an emulsion and surfactant additive in accordance with the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
This example illustrates the improved interfacial tension exhibited by a system with an interphase utilizing monoethanolamine (MEA) and ethoxylated tridecanol according to the invention(bitumen/H2O MEA/Na/ethoxylated tridecanol) as compared to a system with an interphase using only ethoxylated tridecanol (bitumen/H2O ethoxylated tridecanol).<br>
The interphase (bitumen/H2O MEA/Na/ethoxylated tridecanol) was made using 4533 mg/l MEA, with 20 mg/l Na+ in the formation water, and with increasing amounts of polyethoxylated tridecanol, and was tested for interfacial tension using a rotary droplet interfacial tensiometer designed by the University of Texas and designated UTSDT-500.  Interphase (bitumen/H20 ethoxylated tridecanol) was also tested with increasing amounts of ethoxylated tridecanol.  Referring to Figure 1, the interfacial tension is presented for the system made using only ethoxylated tridecanol, and for the system made using the surfactant additive according to the present invention including ethoxylated tridecanol and monoethanolamine.  As shown, the surfactant additive according to the invention advantageously provided an interfacial tension substantially lower than that provided by ethoxylated tridecanol alone.<br>
16<br><br>
Figure 1 also shows that above certain levels, the interfacial tension for both systems becomes substantially stable regardless of increasing amounts of ethoxylated tridecanol.<br>
Figure 2 shows the interfacial tension for systems prepared as described above having varying amounts of monoethanolamine and sodium hydroxide (Na+) in the formation water, and 5667 ppm of polyethoxylated tridecanol in the dilution water. For the system represented by Figure 2, sodium ions were present at a concentration of 281 parts per million based on the aqueous phase.  The concentrations of monoethanolamine and polyethoxylated tridecanol are provided in terms of parts per million by weight with respect to the water in the 85:15 emulsion.<br>
The measurements of interfacial tension were taken at 60°C.  As shown, for values of monoethanolamine of<br>
approximately 1000 ppm and higher, the interfacial tension<br>
dynes     is substantially constant at approximately 0. cm. <br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A number of emulsions were prepared using a Rushton blade coupled to a Heidol pH meter.  The emulsions were   formed using reconstituted Cerro Negro bitumen as described above in Table 1.  Emulsions were prepared having an initial ratio of bitumen:water of 85:15, at a formation temperature of 60°C, under mixing at 200 rpm for two minutes followed by<br>
17<br><br>
1500 rpm for one minute. After the respective emulsions were formed, the 85:15 emulsions were diluted to a final emulsion having a ratio of bitumen:water of 70:30. In a first group of emulsions, emulsions were prepared by adding<br>
polyethoxylated tridecanol in the formation water at concentrations of 500, 1000 and 1500 ppm, in combination with 800 ppm of monoethanolamine.  These concentrations are provided in terms of ppm by weight with respect to the bitumen phase.<br>
A second group of emulsions were prepared by adding monoethanolamine in the formation water along with a source of sodium hydroxide, and subsequently adding ethoxy-lated tridecanol in the dilution portion of the water.  Emulsions were prepared having 0, 150, 250, 350, 550, 1000 and 1500 ppm of polyethoxylated tridecanol for each of 600 and 800 ppm of monoethanolamine, and were also prepared at 1000 ppm of ethoxylated tridecanol with 300, 400 and 500 ppm of monoethanolamine.  In each case, sodium hydroxide was added in the formation water at a concentration of 20 ppm of sodium ions with respect to the final emulsion.<br>
Average droplet diameter and droplet diameter distributions were determined for the emulsions prepared as above.  Figure 3 shows droplet size for an 85:15 emulsion formed using only monethanolamine with 20 ppm sodium ions in the formation water.  It is shown that at concentrations of monoethanolamine of 800 ppm or higher an emulsion having<br>
18<br><br>
average droplet diameter of less than about 15 µm is formed. However, upon dilution of these emulsions with fresh water to the end desired ratio of bitumen:water of 70:30, the average droplet diameter of these emulsions increased undesirably.  Without being bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the additional fresh water causes a<br>
 decrease in pH of the aqueous phase, and,further that the<br>
	  Ca+<br>
fresh water containing a certain amount of     2  electrolyte results in a decrease in the activity of the natural surfactant of the bitumen.<br>
Figure 4 shows the average droplet diameter for the intermediate emulsions prepared as above having a ratio of 85:15 and a final emulsion having a ratio of 70:30, for emulsions formed using 8 00 ppm monoethanolamine and 20 ppm sodium ions in the formation water and varying amounts of ethoxylated tridecanol in the dilution water.  As shown, the final 70:30 emulsion provided desirable average droplet diameters of approximately 15 µm at a,,level of ethoxylated tridecanol of 200 ppm and higher.  Note the value of average droplet diameter for the 70:30 emulsion with 0 ppm<br>
ethoxylated tridecanol is approximately 30 µm.<br>
i<br>
Figure 5 shows the droplet size distribution for final emulsions having a ratio by volume of,bitumen:water of 70:30 for two emulsions, one prepared with 800 ppm monoethanolamine and 20 ppm sodium ions in the formation water and 1000 ppm ethoxylated tridecanol in the dilution<br>
19<br><br>
water, and the other prepared with 800 ppm ethanolamine and 20 ppm sodium ions in the formation water and 0 ppm ethoxylated tridecanol in the dilution water.  As shown, the emulsion formed in accordance with the present invention and utilizing the surfactant additive of the present invention has a far narrower and more desirable droplet size distribution.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
This example demonstrates the dynamic stability of emulsions formed in accordance with the present invention. A number of emulsions were prepared in accordance with the present invention and sheared at a velocity of 5000 rpm for 60 minutes at a temperature of 30°C.  During this time, samples were taken every 5 minutes during the first 20 minutes, and every 10 minutes thereafter, and the samples were tested to determine distribution and average droplet diameter as well as viscosity before and after the shearing. Measurements of viscosity were taken using a viscosimeter Model Haake RV 20 with concentric cylinders of type MV-1. Average droplet diameter distribution was determined using a particle analyzer (Mastersizer/E Malvern) and shear was applied using a mixer (T.K. Mixing Analyzer MA-2500) with a high viscosity blade.  Referring to Figure 6, results of the dynamic stability test are illustrated using a final emulsion of 70:30 ratio which was prepared using 800 ppm of<br>
20<br><br>
monoethanolamine and 20 ppm of sodium ions in the formation water and which was diluted with fresh water containing ethoxylated tridecanol at concentrations between 150 and 1500 ppm.  The results of these measurements are also set forth below in Table 2.<br>

Referring to Figure 6, it is readily apparent that the ratio of final droplet diameter to initial droplet diameter, Df/Di remains substantially constant during the mixing time<br><br>
as desired, thereby indicating a stable emulsion.<br>

As shown in Figure 7, the Df/Di ratio is still<br><br>
substantially constant when 600 ppm ethanolamine are used.<br><br>
Also, referring to Tables 2 and 3, final viscosity numbers<br>
are acceptably close to the initial viscosity prior to<br>
application of shear.<br>

Referring to Figure 8, it is clear that the ratio Df/Di remains substantially constant for the various tested levels of monoethanolamine.  Further, Table 4 shows that initial and final viscosity numbers are also acceptably close to the initial viscosity levels.<br>
The emulsions tested in connection with Figures 6-8 clearly show that bitumen-in-water emulsions formed using the surfactant additive of the present invention and in<br>
23<br><br>
accordance with the process of the present invention result in emulsions which have a high dynamic stability over large variations of concentration of both monoethanolamine and ethoxylated tridecanol.  This is advantageous in that a great degree of operational flexibility is provided so as to allow selection of levels of monoethanolamine/and/or   ethoxylated tridecanol suitable for other desired characteristics of the emulsion.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
This example illustrates static stability of emulsions prepared in accordance with the present invention. Emulsions were prepared having various contents of monoethanolamine, sodium ions and polyothoxylated tridecanol in accordance with the process of the present invention, are stored in close-shut glass container in thermostatic baths at 25°C and 45°C.  At regular time intervals, samples were taken from the containers and analyzed to determine droplet size distributions, average droplet diameter and viscosity using equipment as discussed above.<br>
Figures 9 and 10 respectively show average droplet diameter as a function of storage time for emulsions formed having 800 ppm monoethanolamine, 20 ppm of sodium from sodium hydroxide and 500, 1000 and 1500 ppm of ethoxylated tridecanol, respectively stored at 25°C and 45°C.  Figures and 10 show a slight increase in average droplet diameter <br>
24	<br><br>
the first day, followed by a substantially stable average droplet diameter over the remainder of; the storage period.<br>
Specific surface area of the emulsions was also measured, and the results are illustrated in Figure 11 for storage at 45°C and Figure 12 for storage at 2 5°C.  As shown in these figures, emulsions prepared in accordance with the present invention have a substantially constant specific surface area over the entire storage time, thereby indicating little or no coalescence and, thereby, excellent emulsion stability.<br>
Figures 13 and 14 show the droplet distribution for emulsions formed using 8 00 ppm monoethanolamine and 2 0 ppm sodium ions in the formation water and 1000 ppm ethoxylated tridecanol in the dilution water wherein the emulsion is stored at 25°C and 45°C respectively.  As shown, the day 30 distribution is not substantially changed from the day 0 distribution, thereby further indicating that emulsions formed in accordance with the present invention have excellent stability.<br>
Finally, the viscosity of emulsions formed in accordance with the present invention having 800 ppm monoethanolamine and 20 ppm sodium ions in the formation water and different concentrations of ethoxylated tridecanol is shown in Figures 15 and 16 as a function of storage time<br>
25<br><br>
for emulsions formed respectively at 25°C and 45°C.  Figures 15 and 16 show that the viscosity of emulsions formed in accordance with the present invention and using the surfactant additive of the present invention increase slightly during the initial day, and then stabilize to a practically constant value from the second storage day on. The initial increase in viscosity may be attributed to natural tendency to flocculate displayed by the dispersed system, with the resulting substantially constant viscosity being an indicator of a stable emulsion.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
This example illustrates the stability of emulsions according to the present invention with emulsion water having electrolyte levels greater than 10 ppm and up to<br>
about 100 ppm.<br>
Emulsions were prepared according to the invention<br>
using emulsion water having electrolyte levels of 2 0 ppm, 40 ppm and 60 ppm of Mg++.  The emulsions were formed according to the process of the present invention using 800 ppm of monoethanolamine and 1000 ppm of ethoxylated tridecanol. The emulsions so formed were then tested over storage time at storage temperatures of 30°C and 45°C for static stability.  The results of this testing are set forth below in Table 5.<br>

As set forth above in Table 6, emulsions prepared according to the invention using monoethanolamine and ethoxylated tricadenol show excellent stability for<br>
emulsions formed using dilution water having electrolyte<br>
content exceeding 10 ppm Mg++ and up to 100 ppm Mg++.<br>
This is in contrast to emulsions formed using only monoethanolamine which emulsions are not stable when formed with emulsion water having electrolyte content of even 10 ppm Mg++.<br>
Thus, this example clearly demonstrates the<br>
advantageous nature of the process and surfactant additive<br>
of the present invention wherein dilution Water can be used having a greater electrolyte level than normally would be acceptable.  Obviously, this presents an economic advantage in that emulsions can be formed according to the present invention without the added expense of insuring a water supply having an electrolyte level of less than 10 ppm.<br>
The above examples further illustrate that the emulsions, process and surfactant additive of the present invention provide a stable bitumen-in-water emulsion which has a very high stability and acceptable rheological properties and which is provided using a surfactant additive having advantageous economic and environmental characteristics.  Further, the emulsions so formed are stable and substantially less sensitive to variations in pH, water salinity and/or electrolyte content than emulsions<br><br><br>
30<br><br>
stabilized using only monoethanolamine and the natural surfactant of the bitumen.<br>
In light of the foregoing, it is clear that an emulsion, a process for forming the emulsion and a surfactant additive have been provided in accordance with the invention which readily accomplish the aforesaid objects and advantages.<br>
This invention may be embodied in other forms or<br><br>
carried out in other ways without departing from the spirit  <br>
or essential characteristics thereof.  The present	<br>
embodiment is therefore to be considered as in all respects illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims, and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency are intended to be embraced therein.<br>
