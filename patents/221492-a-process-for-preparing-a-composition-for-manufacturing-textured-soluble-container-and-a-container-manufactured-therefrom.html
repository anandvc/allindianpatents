SCITECH CENTRE, A COMPANY INCORPORATED UNDER SECTION 25 OF THE COMPANIES ACT, 1956, WHOSE ADDRESS IS 7, PRABHAT NAGAR, JOGESHWARI (WEST), MUMBAI - 400 102, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA;<br><br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY	DESCRIBES	AND<br>
r.u._ ~t<br>
ASCERTAINS THE NATURE OF THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFOMEt<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved composition, for manufacturing textured soluble container eg. Capsule with roughened surface and low inter-capsule agglomeration, and an improved process for manufacturing textured soluble container therefrom.<br>
Gelatin or cellulose derivatives are widely used as the base material for manufacture of capsules and films for packaging of diverse products in the drugs/pharmaceutical, cosmoceutical, nutraceutical, foods and agrochemical industry.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The process of preparation of the composition and thereafter manufacture of such gelatin containers generally involve the following steps:<br>
Gelatin solution is prepared by using dry gelatin and demineralised water. The mixture is heated to solubilise the gelatin. Preservatives may be added at this stage. The clear transparent gelatin solution is obtained by filtering and colorants, opacifiers and surfactants are added in the solution. The required viscosity is adjusted by adding DM water. This solution is warmed, de-aerated and transferred to the gelatin dip tanks. Stainless steel capsule molding pins are dipped into the gelatin solution and withdrawn to form cap and body in separate operations. The pins are rotated to distribute the geiatin uniformly. During this time the gelatin is set or gelled by a blast of cold air. The pins are moved through a series of controlled air drying kilns for<br><br><br>
removal of water. After drying the capsules are stripped from the pins and trimmed to length. After trimming the cap and body sections are joined and ejected from the machine.<br>
In the case of gelatin based soluble containers especially capsules generally contain moisture in the range from 10-17% at the end of the drying process. Lowering the moisture of gelatin capsules results in the loss of elasticity and development of brittleness. Furthermore gelatin capsules are sensitive to heat and humidity, which significantly affects the usability of the product. In particular soft gelatin capsules are known to aggregate under hot and humid conditions of storage and transport. Gelatin capsules by their very nature are prone to acquire static charge at low Relative humidity. Under dry conditions gelatin films may induce static charge build up affecting later processing.<br>
The static charge on empty capsules hampers smooth flow of empty capsules on capsule filling machines. This problem is generally overcome by using static charge eliminator on empty capsule sorting machine prior to filing. Alternatively, it can also be reduced by applying a small quantity of talcum powder or dried starch to empty capsules prior to their loading in the capsule-filing machine. Before packing of empty capsules, any static charge that is generated is eliminated by using static charge eliminators at the discharge end of capsule counting machine. The packing material is generally selected so that they do not generate static charge on capsules during transportation.<br><br>
The use of water-soluble film forming cellulose derivatives as substitute of gelatin is widely known in literature.<br>
European Patent document EP0714656 suggests the use of low viscosity (2.4 to 5.4 centistokes) hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) with carrageenan as gelling agent and calcium or potassium as co-gelling agent to produce capsules with lower water contents. However, it has been found that lower molecular weight chains induce high film brittleness.<br>
Published patent document WO 98/27151 discloses polymer compositions for film forming particularly hard and soft capsules comprising of water - soluble ethers, hydrocolloids and sequestering agents. These compositions resulted in capsules with lower water content and improved elasticity.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to provide a means of creating textured roughened surfaced soluble containers, specifically in the case of gelatin based containers such as capsules by incorporation of texturing agents to obtain capsules with normal water content but with low stickiness and low static charges.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide textured containers such as capsules with low stickiness that: can be packed and transported in normal poly-bags without the need to pack them into<br><br><br>
special poly-bags to avoid problems due to static charge effects of /<br>
non-textured capsules.	<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide textured capsules<br>
with lower static charges with enhanced flow properties as compared<br>
to the regular glossy gelatin capsule with high static charges.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a textured surface of the cap and the body of the capsules to ensure a good fit so that they do not separate during transportation under varied climatic or environmental conditions.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide textured surface of the capsules and containers to enable better coating of the same as compared to normal gelatin capsules whose glossy and smooth surface gives problems during coating because the film forming polymers do not easily adhere to the smooth regular capsule surface.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to produce herb embedded gelatin capsules so as to segregate specific sensitive herbs from the herbal formulations that may be non-compatible with other ingredients of the formulation.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide capsules with a look and feel of herbal-based products as is desired by consumers.<br>
Yet another object of the present is to provide a textured soluble container whereby reduction in brittleness is obtained by addition of natural or synthetic plasticizers.<br><br>
Thus according to an aspect of the present invention the same provides herbal textured containers / packs such as capsules and the like for containing products such as drugs / pharmaceuticals, cosmoceutical, neutraceutical and food wherein at least a portion of the external surface of the said container/pack/capsule is textured with herbal content/finish.<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect, the said textured surface finish of herbal content is provided for the whole of the container / capsule body. Preferably the basic container / capsules body is made of conventional capsule material such as gelatin, cellulose derivatives or any other material along with the texturing agent to provide a textured finish on the capsule surface.<br>
Importantly, such herbal textured containers such as capsules and the like would have lower static charges and favour enhanced flow properties required in capsule manufacture.<br>
Also, such textured finish on capsules provide for better surface finish and coating of the capsules and/or have advantages in terms of feel and look of herbal capsules.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
According to the present invention, a process for preparation of the composition for manufacture of textured soluble containers / packs / capsules for drug / pharmaceutical, neutraceutical, cosmoceutical, agrochemical contents, etc. and thereafter manufacturing the said container comprises the steps of:<br><br><br>
(a)	selecting the herbal texturing agent containing a substantial<br>
amount of Liquorice and providing the same in desired form;<br>
(b)	providing the gelatin solution with or without additives in<br>
substantially clean form in container / tanks.<br>
(c)	Adding the texturing agent in said tank;<br>
(d)	deaeration of the solution and providing the same in dipping tank;<br>
(e)	dipping the capsule making pin moulds in the solution followed by withdrawing and subjecting the same to drying<br>

The invention may be better understood by the reference to the following examples which are intended for the purpose of illustration and are not to be construed as, in any way limiting the scope of the present invention, which is defined in the claims appended hereto.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
10 g of distilled water was added to 5 g. of commercially available<br>
I<br>
  Asparagus racemosus root powder followed by solution of 10 g.of distilled water and 10 g. glycerine. This was then kept on a water bath<br>
at 45 deg.C for two hours. In another beakers 500 g. gelatin solution (33.3 % w/v) was taken. Contents of the first beaker was added in the gelatin solution and stirred well. The entire mass was de-aerated at 50 deg. for one hour. Capsule molding pins were hand dipped and dried in the capsule drying zone. After drying the capsules were removed from the pin to obtain the capsules with herbal texture.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
10 g. of Liquorice fine powder passed through # 70 sieve was dispersed in 500g gelatin solution (33.3% w/v.) 2.5 g of Titanium<br><br><br>
dioxide was mixed with 10 ml water and added to the gelatin solution. The suspension was stirred for 30 minutes to obtain a homogenous dispersion. The contents were deaerated at 50 deg. C for one hour and capsule molding pins were hand dipped followed by drying in the capsule drying zone. After drying the capsules were removed from the pin.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 :-<br>
Example 2 was repeated using transparent gelatin solution excluding the opacifier Titanium dioxide. It was observed that titanium dioxide was required to give the capsule shells the natural color and herbal texture.<br>
The capsule formed in the above manner demonstrates following properties:-<br>
1.	Capsule shell wall exhibit rough surface. The electron micrographs show that the herbal particles are dispersed with sizes varying from about 2 microns to about 250 microns.<br>
2.	The moisture content of the capsules was in the range from 14% w/w to 16% w/w after drying.<br>
3.	Disintegration time of the empty capsules varying from 3 to 6 minutes in water as per pharmacopoeial method.<br>
4.	Angle of repose is 32 deg. as against the regular gelatin capsule with 22 deg. This is of specific advantage in determining the flow characteristics   in  the  capsule-manufacturing   machine.     Generally<br><br>
