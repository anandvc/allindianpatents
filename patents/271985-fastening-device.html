Up until now, wiper installations have been screwed or riveted to the body. Screwing or riveting, however, requires special tools and a relatively large amount of time. The object of the invention is to allow quicker and more cost-effective assembly from now on. The fastening arrangement (10) has thus been designed as a clamping arrangement for the purpose of clamping at least one of the components (11), which can be fastened on the second component (12).</td>

FASTENING DEVICE<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention is with regard to a fastening device used to fasten at least two components to one another, especially for fastening a windscreen wiper unit to a motor vehicle's body.<br>
Windscreen wiper units have been screwed or riveted to the car body up to now, special tools being required for screwing or riveting, apart from which screwing or riveting requires relatively more time, which increases assembly costs.<br>
The objective of the invention is to improve the fastening element of the type mentioned initially to the extent that assembly will be quicker in the future and can, thus, be executed more cost-effectively.<br>
The invention meets the objective with a fastening device of the type mentioned initially, said fastening device being designed as a clamping device according to the invention, to clamp at least one of the components that can be fastened to the second component. Components that are to be fastened to one another can be assembled with few hand movements within a short space of time in this manner. Screws, rivets and suchlike can, thus, be done away with in the future.<br>
The fastening device can have two halves that can be swiveled towards one another so that clamping of the at least one component can be executed quickly and simply.<br>
 <br>
In order to ensure that the at least one clamped component is securely held in the fastening device, the latter can grasp the at least one clamped component in a form-fit manner.<br>
The positive locking design can be very easily achieved if the fastening device has at least one projection and/or at least one recess.<br>
In order to implement positive locking, the outer contour of the at least one component that is grasped in a form-fit manner by the fastening device, can be aligned to the inner contour of the fastening device.<br>
The fastening device can be manufactured from two different materials, whereby a material that has beneficial attenuating characteristics and that is surrounded by a hard material is provided for the contact surface that faces at least one of the components. Additional attenuating rubber can be omitted by using the material that has been furnished with beneficial attenuating characteristics. It is particularly advantageous if the material exhibiting attenuating characteristics and the hard material are each made from a synthetic material. The fastening device can then be manufactured in a two-component injection moulding procedure.<br>
In order to ensure that the at least one component to be clamped remains securely clamped, the halves of the fastening device can interlock with one another.<br>
In a preferred design, the halves of the fastening device can be interlocked by means of a lever mechanism.  By using the lever mechanism, very little force<br>
 <br>
is required during assembly to interiock the halves to one another. It is alternatively or additionally possible to have the halves of the fastening device hook into one another. Interlocking using the lever mechanism as well as by hooking can be executed by assembly personnel in a matter of seconds with one hand movement.<br>
It is, however, also possible to rivet the two halves of the fastening device using at least one spring. The at least one spring then pulls or presses the two halves together. Not only is the fastening of components that are to be fastened to one another ensured in this manner but the assembly procedure is also simplified since assembly personnel have only to expend very little force in order to merge the two halves due to the support provided by spring force.<br>
The fastening device can be hooked into the second component, therewith, likewise facilitating fastening of the fastening device to the second component in a matter of seconds. It is, however, also possible to bolt together or to weld the fastening device to the second component<br>
Apart from this, the invention has a windscreen wiper device that exhibits a fastening device, in accordance with the invention, according to one of Claims 1 to 11.<br>
Figures 1 and 2       illustrate the fastening procedure of two components that<br>
can be connected to one another in a first embodiment of the fastening device.<br>
Figure 3	presents the preferred embodiment of a profiled pipe of a<br>
windscreen wiper unit.<br>
 <br>
Figures 4 to 6	illustrate the fastening procedure of two components that<br>
can be connected to one another in a second embodiment of the fastening device.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate a fastening device 10 with which component 11 that can be a profiled pipe of a windscreen wiper unit and component 12 that can be the motor vehicle's body, can be fastened to one another.<br>
The fastening device 10 has two halves 13 and 14 that are connected to one another in a swivelling fashion using a hinge 15.<br>
Component 11 is inserted into half 14. Half 13 is subsequently swivelled over component 11. A lever mechanism 16 that is furnished with opening 17 is pushed with opening 17 over appendage 20, whereby halves 13 and 14 interlock with one another.<br>
Half 13 exhibits a casing 18 and an attenuating element 19. Half 14 is furnished with casing 100 and attenuating element 101. Casings 18 and 100 are manufactured from a hard material in contrast to which attenuating elements 19 and 101 are manufactured from a material that has beneficial attenuating characteristics. By using attenuating elements 19 and 101, component 11 can be clamped with pre-load force in the fastening device 10. As a result of the pre-load force, component 11 is fastened in its axial direction in the fastening device 10 in a non-positive manner. Casings 18 and 100 as well as attenuating elements 19 and 101 are advantageously manufactured from a synthetic material. A two-component injection moulding procedure then lends itself to the manufacture of halves 13 and 14.<br>
 <br>
The fastening device can be fastened with component 11 in a non-positive manner in the axial direction, whereby component 11 remains reliably at the specified position even in the case of agitation.<br>
Contours of component 11 and halves 13 and 14 are aligned in such a manner to one another that component 11 is grasped in a form-fit manner by halves 13 and 14, whereby rotation of component 11 along its longitudinal axis is ruled out.<br>
Fastening device 10 is hooked into component 12 by means of two hooks 21 and 22.<br>
Fastening device 10 is furnished with distance elements 23 and 24 in order to achieve a defined distance between the fastening device and component 12.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a profiled pipe of a windscreen wiper unit that is not illustrated here in greater detail, with a fastening pipe 31 that is furnished with a recess 32 which the fastening device 10 can engage with by means of a projection (refer Figure 1). Fastening pipe 31 can thus be clamped in a form-fit manner in the fastening device 10.<br>
Figures 4 to 6 present a fastening device 40 in which component 41 is clamped. A second component that is to be connected to component 41, as well as the connection to the fastening device 40 and to the second component is not illustrated here in order to present a simpler illustration.<br>
 <br>
In order to clamp component 41, one half 42 is swivelled counter clock-wise relative to half 43, whereby spring 44 is tightened (refer Figure 4).<br>
Spring 44 exhibits its maximum tensile stress when line 50 that connects the two supporting points of spring 44 to one another runs through the midpoint of component 41 (Figure 5).<br>
If swivelling of half 42 is continued in the counter clock-wise direction towards half 43, then this swivelling movement is supported by the pre-loaded spring 44 since the pre-loaded spring's 44 tension is released by this further movement. Assembly personnel, thus, need expend only very little force to merge the two halves 42 and 43 together.<br>
The half 42 exhibits a hook 51 with which to clamp the two halves 42 and 43 together, said hook engaging with a corresponding counterpart 52 of half 43 the moment half 42 has reached its final position.<br>
