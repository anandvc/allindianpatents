				<td>This application claims priority to Chinese Patent Application No. 200610059336.0<br>
entitled "Method and Device for Mapping DTM to OTN" and filed on March 3, 2006 with<br>
the State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC, the disclosure of which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an optical transmission net (OTN) technology, and<br>
more particularly, to a method, device, and application equipment for transmitting a dynamic<br>
synchronous transfer mode (DTM) on an OTN.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The next generation network requires high-efficient transmission and performance<br>
monitoring capability as well as optimal availability and survivability. Synchronous optical<br>
network/synchronous digital hierarchy (SONET/SDH) has its own advantages in time<br>
division multiplexing (TDM)-based services, and plays an important role in metropolitan area<br>
networks (MANs). However, due to various limitations, it is difficult for SONET/SDH to<br>
satisfy the requirements of a current metropolitan OTN along with the continuous<br>
development of the Internet and data services. Therefore, a new network solution is needed<br>
to satisfy the requirements of network expandability and manageability. An International<br>
Telecommunications Union-Telecommunications Standardization Section (ITU-T)<br>
G709-based OTN emerges as required. G709 is focused on digital wrapper. The digital<br>
wrapper constructs a particular frame format to wrap a client signal into a payload unit of a<br>
frame, and provides overhead (OH) bytes for operation, administration, maintenance, and<br>
provisioning (OAM&amp;P) at the frame header, and forward error correction (FEC) bytes at the<br>
frame frailer. The digital wrapper may support OH of an optical channel layer of a client<br>
signal, take regeneration requirements of the optical channel into full consideration, and<br>
support the transmission of channel-associated OH as well as the convenience of the access of<br>
various services, so that the problem of monitoring performance in the OTN is easily solved.<br>
In addition, the introduction of the FEC technology may effectively improve the performance<br>
of error rate of the client signal, reduce the demand of an optical network on photoelecfric<br>
conversion, and further significantly lower the network construction cost.<br>
Figure 1 is a structural diagram of a format of an OTN standard frame. It can be seen<br><br>
that the OTN standard frame is in a format of 4 rows and 4080 columns. The 16 columns at<br>
the header are OH bytes, the 255 columns at the trailer are FEC check bytes, and the middle<br>
3808 columns are payload. Among the OH bytes at the header, the 1st to 7th columns of the<br>
first row are frame alignment signals (FAS). The 8th to 14th bytes are OH bytes of an optical<br>
channel transport unit-K (OTUK), in which different values of K are corresponding to<br>
transmission modes of different rates. The lst to 14th columns of the 2nd to 4th rows are OH<br>
bytes of an optical channel data unit-K (ODUK). The 15th to 16th columns are OH bytes of<br>
an optical channel payload unit-K (OPUK). The 7th byte of the FAS is a multi-frame<br>
alignment signal (MFAS) configured to indicate OH allocation when multiple user service<br>
signals are carried by means of TDM.<br>
The OTUK OH bytes provide a function for monitoring signal transmission states<br>
between Reamplification, Reshaping, and Retiming (3R) regeneration nodes in the OTN,<br>
including three parts, namely, OH bytes of section monitoring (SM), OH bytes of<br>
communication channels between general communication channel-0 (GCCO) terminals, and<br>
bytes reserved for future international standardization (RES).<br>
The ODUK OH provides cascade connection monitoring, end-to-end channel<br>
monitoring, and client signal adaptation through OPUK. The ODUK provides abundant OH<br>
bytes (the 1st to 14th columns of the 2nd to 4th rows) to fulfill the above functions, including<br>
path monitoring (PM) OH, tandem connection monitoring (TCM) OH, general<br>
communication channel (GCC) bytes GCCl and GCC2 OH, auto-protection switching &amp;<br>
protection control channel (APS/PCC) OH bytes, fault type fault location (FTFL) information,<br>
and experiment (EXP) OH bytes.<br>
The OPUK is composed of payload (OPU) mapped by the client signal and the<br>
specific overhead (OPU OH) of the OPUK. The OH bytes include payload structure<br>
identifier (PSI), adjustment bytes, and mapping specific overhead. The PSI is respectively<br>
corresponding to 0-255 probable values under the MFAS instruction, in which the 0* byte is a<br>
client signal payload type (PT), and the others are reserved (RES) bytes for fiiture expansion.<br>
Currently, a client signal can be mapped into the OTN in the following three modes:<br>
(1) constant bit rate (CBR) like CBR2G5, CBR10G, and CBR40G by which signals are<br>
mapped into the OPUK; (2) asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) by which signals are mapped<br>
into the OPUK (ATM cells are multiplexed into a constant bit stream matching the payload<br>
capacity of the OPUK, so as to be mapped into the OPUK, and during the multiplexing, the<br><br>
rate is adjusted by inserting idle cells or discarding cells); and (3) general framing procedure<br>
(GFP) by which frame signals are mapped into the OPUK (the mapping of GFP frames<br>
achieves a continuous bit stream matching the OPUK by inserting idle frames in the<br>
packaging stage). In addition, other signals, such as client signals, test signals, and bit<br>
stream signals of common clients, may also be mapped into the OPUK.<br>
However, for some special services, such as dynamic synchronous transfer mode<br>
(DTM) services, the OTN is unable to map and transparently transmit the DTM services at<br>
present.<br>
The DTM service is a transmission technology of ETSI standard capable of providing<br>
high-quality transmission. Combining the TDM exchange technology and the PACKET<br>
exchange technology, the DTM service overcomes the disadvantages that a PACKET network<br>
needs a large buffer and cannot guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of real-time services,<br>
and possesses the QoS capability of the TDM and the dynamic bandwidth allocation<br>
capability of the PACKET network. Meanwhile, the DTM service supports the transmission<br>
of real-time broadband services, various data services, video services, and TDM services,<br>
provides multicast capability, and achieves maximal transmission capacity while requiring<br>
little OH.<br>
The DTM can compete with Ethernet transport network (ETN) in function and<br>
performance. In addition to the dynamic bandwidth capability like the ETN, the DTM can<br>
further transmit real-time services such as TDM with high quality. The DTM combines<br>
simple and non-blocking attributes and capability of supporting real-time communication in<br>
the circuit switching technology with dynamic resource processing attributes in the PACKET<br>
exchange technology, so as to construct a high-capacity transport network with dynamic<br>
resource allocation by integrating advantages of synchronous and asynchronous medium<br>
access modes. Substantially, the DTM is a circuit switching method of the TDM. Therefore,<br>
the network may match the change in flow and allocate bandwidth between two nodes upon<br>
requirements.<br>
The DTM adopts a frame structure similar to SDH/SONET, and expands the resource<br>
dynamic reallocation to the DTM. Compared to SDH/SONET, the DTM may establish<br>
circuits or channels of various rates according to requirements, and the channel capacity may<br>
vary with the flow characteristic in operation. As the resource allocation between nodes in<br>
an annular or bus structure is changeable, unused resources will be allocated to nodes with<br><br>
higher requirements, thus forming an autonomous and highly efficient dynamic infrastructure.<br>
In addition, the DTM, just like the ATM, has an important characteristic of providing<br>
multi-channel interfaces.<br>
The DTM is based on TDM technology. Therefore, the transmission capacity of any<br>
fiber channel is divided into minute time units. The total channel capacity is divided into<br>
frames with a fixed size of 125 μs, and each frame is subdivided into time-slots of 64 bits.<br>
Each frame has a specific number of time-slots depending on the bit rate (bit stream). For<br>
example, as for a bit stream of 2 Gbps, each frame has about 3900 (2xl09xl25x10-6/64)<br>
time-slots. If a frame length of 125 μs and a time-slot of 64 bits are adopted, the<br>
transmission of digital audio and plesiochronous digital hierarchy can be simply adjusted.<br>
The time-slots in each frame may be classified into digital slots and control slots. At<br>
any time point, a time-slot is either a digital slot or a control slot. If necessary, a digital slot<br>
may be converted into a control slot. Privileges of writing the digital slots and control slots<br>
are distributed on each node of the channel.<br>
The DTM frame structure is different from the frame structure in a conventional TDM<br>
system. Referring to Figure 2, a schematic diagram of a DTM frame structure is shown.<br>
The DTM frame has a start-of-frame identifier (SOF ID) followed by digital time-slots, and<br>
intervals composed of some filling patterns at the end of the frame, so as to ensure the<br>
receiving terminal to achieve clock recovery successfully. The frame length is 125 μs, and<br>
the repetition frequency is 8 KHz. ndata represents the number of the time-slots, and felow and<br>
fehigh respectively indicate the upper and lower limit of errors of the frame.<br>
At present, the DTM has plenty of standards issued by ETSI, including physical layer<br>
protocols, and standards of mapping the DTM frame to the SDH virtual container (VC), the<br>
SDH to the DTM and mapping the MPLS to the DTM. However, details about the mapping<br>
between the DTM and OTN have not been released. In the prior art, in order to realize the<br>
mapping from the DTM to OTN, the DTM must be firstly mapped OVER to the SDH VC and<br>
then to the OTN.<br>
It is a standard already established by the ETSI to map the DTM to the SDH. Figure<br>
3 is a schematic diagram of DTM allocation in a VC4/VC4-XC according to the prior art. It<br>
can be seen from FIG 3 that, the first part is an OH area, the second part is a fixed insertion<br>
area, and the third part is a DTM time-slot area. As for one VC4, there are 32x9 288 DTM<br>
time-slots.<br><br>
Figure 4 is a schematic diagram of mapping a DTM time-slot to an SDH VC4<br>
according to the prior art. As shown in Figure. 4, a time-slot of the DTM in VC4 is 65 bits.<br>
S bit is a specific identification bit. When the S bit is 0, data is transmitted, and when the S<br>
bit is 1, other status information, such as alarm indication signal (AIS), IDLE, and<br>
performmice monitoring information is transmitted. Since a time-slot is composed of 65 bits,<br>
the S bit aligns with the start position of the byte after every 8 time-slots. As for the<br>
synchronization of the DTM time-slots, the first data byte in each row of the VC is a<br>
synchronous starting point.<br>
The conventional method of mapping the DTM to SDH and then to the OTN<br>
comprises the following steps.<br>
1)	Dividing VC4 time-slots, and adopting 65BIT as a digital time-slot. 64BIT is a<br>
digital bit, and 1 bit is a control bit. Each row has 32 time-slots in total.<br>
2)	Receiving a tributary DTM data stream, removing 8B/10B line coding, and<br>
restoring a DTM frame.<br>
3)	Respectively mapping the restored DTM data time-slots to the DTM time-slots<br>
divided by the VC4, then mapping the 64 bits of the data time-slots to the corresponding<br>
64BIT data positions in the DTM time-slots, and setting and writing each S bit into the<br>
corresponding S bit position.<br>
4)	Setting the first column in the pay load area of the VC4 as fixed insertion bytes.<br>
5)	Distinguishing the time-slot boundary by realizing synchronization with the first<br>
data byte in each row, finding the starting point of the first data time-slot, and sequentially<br>
setting each 65BIT as a DTM time-slot position.<br>
6)	Forming a complete synchronous transport module-n (STM-N) signal and mapping<br>
the STM -N to the OTN.<br>
Figure 5 is a structural diagram of mapping the DTM to a trans-multiplexing (TMUX)<br>
device in the OTN through an SDH layer according to the prior art. The client signal, for<br>
example, a gigabit Ethernet (GE)/fast Ethernet (FE)/enterprise system connection (ESCON),<br>
or TDM, is adapted to an SDH VC through an adaptation protocol. The SDH VC is then<br>
multiplexed to an STM-N format, and the STM-N further maps the ODUK and OTUK in the<br>
OTN to be transmitted on the OTN.<br>
The prior art of mapping the DTM to the SDH and then to the OTN has the following<br>
disadvantages.<br><br>
1)	The bandwidth utilization ratio is not high. In order to be transmitted on the OTN,<br>
the DTM needs to be mapped to the SDH and then to the OTN, so that each layer occupies<br>
too much OH.<br>
2)	An SDH layer is added, and the process on the SDH is relatively complicated.<br>
Thereby, it is difficult to realize the whole design, and the hardware cost is high.<br>
3)	The advantage that the DTM may make full use of the fiber bandwidth cannot be<br>
accomplished.<br>
In view of the above, since the prior art of mapping the DTM to SDH and then to the<br>
OTN is high in cost and low in bandwidth utilization ratio, those skilled in the art are eager to<br>
put forward a technology of mapping the DTM to OTN at a low cost and with a high<br>
bandwidth utilization ratio. However, the DTM frame structure is a frame structure with 125<br>
μs as a period, and the number of the time-slots is associated with a line rate. The OTN<br>
frame structure, for example, the ODUK (including ODU OH and OPUK), is a 3824x4<br>
modularized frame structure independent of the line rate. The period of ODUK at different<br>
levels varies with the level. For example, the frame period of the ODUl is four times longer<br>
than that of the 0DU2, but the structure thereof still has 3824x4 bytes. Therefore, the<br>
time-slots of the DTM cannot be directly mapped to the time-slots or bytes of the ODUK, and<br>
the technology of mapping the DTM to the SDH cannot be applied to the OTN.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a method, a mapping device, and an<br>
application equipment for transmitting a dynamic synchronous transfer mode (DTM) on an<br>
optical fransport network (OTN), so as to achieve the mapping from the DTM to the OTN<br>
while saving the cost.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, a method for transmitting a DTM on an<br>
OTN is provided. The method includes the following steps. A client signal adapted to a<br>
time-slot rate of a specified DTM is mapped to a corresponding time-slot position in an<br>
intermediate data frame, and a signal in a format of the intennediate data frame is generated.<br>
The intermediate data frame has a repetition period identical to that of a DTM frame, and a<br>
rate identical to that of a payload area in an OTN frame. Afterward, the signal in the format<br>
of the intermediate data frame is mapped to the OTN frame.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, a device for transmitting a DTM on<br>
an OTN is provided, including an adaptation module, an intermediate data frame module,<br><br><br>
and an OTN line processing module. The adaptation module is configured to mlapt a client<br>
signal to a specified DTM time-slot rate. The intermediate data frame module is configured<br>
to map the client signal adapted by the adaptation module to a corresponding time-slot<br>
position in the intermediate data frame so as to generate a signal in a format of the<br>
intermediate data frame. The intermediate data frame has a repetition period identical to that<br>
of a DTM frame, and a rate identical to that of a payload area in an OTN frame. The OTN<br>
line processing module is configured to map the signal in the format of the intermediate data<br>
frame to the OTN frame.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, an optical cross-connect (OXC)<br>
equipment is provided. The OXC equipment includes a wavelength multiplexer, a<br>
wavelength demultiplexer, and a device coupled to the wavelength multiplexer and the<br>
wavelength demultiplexer for transmitting a DTM on an OTN. An output signal of the<br>
device is an input signal of the wavelength multiplexer, and an output signal of the<br>
wavelength demultiplexer is an input signal of the mapping device.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, an optical add/drop multiplexer<br>
(OADM) is provided. The OADM includes a wavelength multiplexing/demultiplexing<br>
module and an OADM module coupled to each other, and a device coupled to the wavelength<br>
multiplexing/demultiplexing module for transmitting a DTM on an OTN. An output signal<br>
of the device is an input signal of the wavelength multiplexing/demultiplexing module, and a<br>
reverse output signal of the wavelength multiplexing/demultiplexing module is a reverse<br>
input signal of the device.<br>
According to the aforementioned technical solutions, in the embodiments of the<br>
present invention, a DTM is mapped to an OTN by adopting an intermediate data frame<br>
having a repetition period identical to that of a DTM frame and a rate identical to that of a<br>
payload area in an OTN frame as a mapping medium. The intermediate data frame is<br>
simpler than the conventional SDH VC frame both in structure and physical realization, thus<br>
saving the cost.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in detail below with reference to<br>
the accompanied drawings.<br>
Since the ODUK frame structure and the DTM frame structure are two different frame<br>
structures, the prior art cannot directly map a DTM time-slot to an ODUK time-slot or byte.<br>
The present invention solves the above problem that two frame formats cannot<br>
directly match each other by an intermediate data frame structure (or an intermediate<br>
sub-layer) of a modularized frame structure with a DTM format different from the OTN.<br>
Thereby, an ODUK is adopted as a line rate of the DTM to realize a direct mapping from the<br>
DTM to the OTN.<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
Firstly, a method for transmitting a DTM on an OTN provided by the present<br>
invention is described in this embodiment.<br>
The intermediate data frame structure in this embodiment of the present invention is<br>
an optical channel payload tributary unit-K (OPTUK) frame structure. The OPTUK frame<br>
structure needs a repetition period of 125 μs (the same as the repetition period of the DTM<br>
frame), i.e., a repetition frequency is 8 KHz. The OPTUK frame structure has a rate identical<br>
to that of an optical channel payload unit (OPUK).	Different K values are<br><br>
corresponding to varied nominal bit rates. For example, the nominal bit rate of an OPTUl is<br>
the rate of STM-16, the nominal bit rate of an 0PTU2 is the rate of STM-64, and the nominal<br>
bit rate of an OPTUS is the rate of STM-256.<br>
Figure 6 is a diagram of a frame structure in one row of the OPTUK in this<br>
embodiment, and Figure 7 is a schematic diagram of a modularized frame structure of the<br>
OPTUl according to the present invention. The modularized frame structure in Figure 7<br>
includes 9 rows of the frame shown in Figure 6. As shown in the figure, the OPTUK data<br>
frame structure includes a frame alignment identifier and a payload area, and the time-slot is<br>
divided by a unit of 64 bits (i.e., the size of the time-slot of the DTM). For example, the<br>
OPTUl data frame has 9 rows and 270x16 columns with a size of 16x270x9 bytes and at a<br>
rate of 16*270x9x8x8 kBIT/s=2488.32 MBIT/S. The OPTUl has all-together<br>
(16x270x9x8)/64=4860 DTM time-slots corresponding to 4860/9 540 time-slots in each row.<br>
In the 4860 time-slots, N time-slots are designated as OH time-slots, one time-slot<br>
among the N time-slots functions for frame synchronization, the bits of N-1 time-slots serve<br>
as control bits, and the total bit number of the N-I frame slots is larger than or equal to the<br>
number of 4860-N time-slots. These control bits are configured to indicate the state of each<br>
time-slot, for example, whether a time-slot is a data time-slot or a control time-slot. The<br>
control time-slots further include idle time-slots, performance monitoring time-slots, and AIS<br>
time-slots. This embodiment is different from the DTM mapping to VC in that the DTM<br>
time-slot in the VC has 65 bits, and the S bit is a control bit; while in this solution, the control<br>
bit is concentrated in N-1 OH time-slots, and the time-slot has 64 bits, so that it is<br>
unnecessary to search for the time-slot position when the bytes are synchronous.<br>
In this embodiment, the method for transmitting a DTM on an OTN includes the<br>
following steps.<br>
a.	Constructing an intermediate adaptation entity OPTUK. The adaptation entity has<br>
9 lines and 270 columns, and has a size of Xx270x9 bytes (X represents a nominal bit rate of<br>
the OPTUK). The entity further has a period of 125 μs, and a repetition frequency of 8<br>
KBIT/S. When K=l, the rate of the OPTUl is the nominal bit rate of the STM-16, and the<br>
volume of the entity is 16x270x9 bytes; likewise, the rate of the OPTU2 is the nominal bit<br>
rate of the STM-64, and the volume of the entity is 64x270x9 bytes.<br>
b.	Dividing the time-slots for the OPTUK by a unit of 64 bits. For example, 4860<br>
time-slots are divided for the OPTUl, and the rate of each time-slot is 512 KBIT/S.<br><br>
c.	Mapping the received data frame to the corresponding time-slot. The data frames<br>
may be Ethernet frames, MPLS frames, or TDM frames. Since the DTM time-slots are<br>
allocated according to the original rate of the client signal, the total rate related to the number<br>
of the DTM time-slots is larger than the rate of the corresponding client signal.<br>
d.	Setting OH time-slots, including frame synchronous time-slots and control<br>
time-slots. The frame synchronous time-slots may also be frame alignment bytes with a<br>
fixed format, for example, the same as the bytes of F6 and 28, or indication bytes and check<br>
bytes, for example, in the same synchronous mode as the GFP.<br>
e.	Transparently mapping the OPTUK frame to the ODUK at the same level. For<br>
example, mapping the OPTUl to the ODUl, or mapping the OPTU2 to the 0DU2, and then<br>
adapting the ODUK to the OTUK so as to be transmitted on the line. The line may be a<br>
single-wavelength line or a multi-wavelength line.<br>
The process of the above embodiment can be concluded as follows. First, the client<br>
signal adapted to a specified DTM time-slot rate is mapped to the corresponding time-slot<br>
position of an OPTUK frame (an intermediate data frame). The OPTUK frame has a<br>
repetition period identical to that of the DTM frame, and has a rate identical to that of a<br>
payload area in the OTN frame. Secondly, a signal in a format of the OPTUK frame is<br>
mapped to the OTN frame. More specifically, the signal in the format of the OPTUK is<br>
mapped to the ODUK, so as to generate an ODUK signal, and the ODUK signal is packaged<br>
into the signal in the OTUK format. Thereby, the mapping from the DTM to the OTN is<br>
completed.<br>
It should be noted that the time-slots in the OPTUK frame may not only be divided by<br>
a unit completely the same (for example, 64 bits) as the time-slots in the DTM frame, but also<br>
may be slightly larger than the time-slot division unit in the DTM frame. For example, in the<br>
OPTUK frame, the time-slots are divided by a unit of 65 bits.<br>
Compared with the conventional method for mapping to the OTN throgh the SDH<br>
layer, the present invention replaces the SDH layer with the OPTUK layer in a DTM format,<br>
thereby not only saving the cost and enhancing the broadband utilization ratio, but also<br>
discarding the complicated process of the SDH layer, to the prior art, the VC only has<br>
several fixed rates, such as VC12 for the transmission of 2 M and VC4 for the transmission of<br>
140 M. to this manner, even if the DTM is OVER to the VC, it is still limited by the VC<br>
specific rates. When the transmitted client rate is larger than one VC, the process becomes<br><br>
complicated. In an embodiment of the present invention, since the rate of the OPTUK frame<br>
is high (for example, several G), and the particle is small (the size of one DTM time-slot is<br>
about 512 Kbps), this embodiment is applicable to signal transmission at wider client rates,<br>
for example, 200 M and 1.5 G/2 G (as the DTM time-slots are directly divided at the rate of<br>
close to the STM-N).<br>
The aforementioned method solves the technical problem that the DTM cannot be<br>
directly adopted in the OPUK of the common OTN. Thereby, through such an intermediate<br>
sub-layer, the method may not only be well applicable to various services, but also<br>
conveniently adapt for the OPUK. In this way, the application raige of the OTN is expanded,<br>
and the bandwidth utilization and client access of the OTN become more flexible.<br>
The above embodiment of the method of the present invention may be implemented<br>
through different devices, and examples of the devices of mapping the DTM to the OTN<br>
according to the present invention are illustrated as follows.<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
Figure 8 is a schematic structural diagram of mapping a DTM to a TMUX of an OTN<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. It is a transparent DTM TMUX<br>
structure for realizing all services being transmitted transparently. No matter data services,<br>
video service, or conventional TDM services all can be transmitted transparently. Both<br>
MAC transparency and bit transparency may be realized for the data services. As shown in<br>
Figure 8, the TMUX includes an adaptation module, an OPTUK module, and an OTN line<br>
processing module.<br>
The adaptation module is configured to finish the processing of a physical layer of the<br>
client signal in a transmitting direction, and adapt the client signal to a DTM time-slot rate<br>
with a specified capacity. Various data services, after the processing of the physical layer and<br>
the adaptation of the GFP or other adaptation protocols, obtain a rate equal to that of a<br>
specified number of DTM time-slots. For example, GE services achieve a rate of about 1 G<br>
after the GEP adaptation, and may satisfy the MAC transparent transmission of GE by<br>
specifying about 2000 DTM time-slots. Or, after the rate adjustment, each TDM service has<br>
a rate equal to a specified number of the DTM time-slots. For example, the STM-1 signal<br>
may designate 305 DTM time-slots for transmission. The TDM rate adjustment may employ<br>
one DTM time-slot for management, and this time-slot is an adjustment control time-slot,<br>
including positive adjustment control, negative adjustment control, and negative adjustment<br><br>
opportunity. Definitely, under special circumstances, if the data services also require bit<br>
transparency, the processing mode is the same as the TDM service. The adaptation module<br>
implements functions in a receiving direction opposite to those of the transmitting direction,<br>
so as to restore the format signal packaged by the adaptation protocol to the original format of<br>
the client signal.<br>
The OPTUK module is configured to map all the signals adapted by the adaptation<br>
module to a specified DTM time-slot position of the OPTUK. The DTM time-slot is<br>
multiplexed by mapping the adapted signals to the specified time-slots. For example, the GE,<br>
after adapted by the GFP, occupies about 2000 DTM time-slots, an ESCON signal, after<br>
adapted by the GFP, occupies 400 DTM time-slots, and all other client signals after<br>
adaptation take up the rest DTM time-slots. The DTM time-slots occupy the whole space of<br>
the OPTUK, thus realizing the DTM multiplexing function of each client signal. After the<br>
multiplexing, the signal in the OPTUK format is transmitted to an ODUK terminal module.<br>
The OPTUK implements the opposite function in the receiving direction, and parses<br>
the data stream of each time-slot from the signal in the OPTUK format, and transmits the data<br>
stream to the adaptation module to further parse an original signal.<br>
The OTN line processing module has OPUK, ODUK, and OTUK framing functions<br>
in the OTN. In this embodiment, the OTN line processing module includes an ODUK<br>
module and an OTUK module.<br>
In the transmitting direction, the ODUK module is configured to finish mapping the<br>
OPTUK signal to the OPUK payload area, generate the ODUK OH, and transmit the OH to<br>
the OTUK module. In the receiving direction, the ODUK module terminates the ODUK<br>
OH, parses the signal in the OPTUK format from the OPUK payload area, and transmits the<br>
signal to the OPTUK module.<br>
The OTUK module finishes packaging the ODUK signal into the signal in the OTUK<br>
format in the transmitting direction. The process includes generating an OTUK OH,<br>
generating an FEC signal, and sending the signal in the OTUK to a line to be transmitted after<br>
electro-optic conversion. Further, the OTUK module finishes terminating the OTUK OH<br>
and the FEC in the receiving direction.<br>
The device as shown in Figure 8 is mainly different from the prior art (Figure 5) in<br>
that, the OPTUK module replaces the complicated function of the SDH VC layer, so as to<br>
allocate bandwidth in a format close to the line rate and finish the multiplexing of the DTM.<br><br>
Thereby, the device is applicable to the transmission and multiplexing of wider irregular<br>
client rates. Meanwhile, without the limitations of the complicated pointer processing and<br>
fixed rate levels of the SDH layer, the circuit realization becomes simpler and the processing<br>
cost thereof is lowered. The aforementioned device solves the technical problem that the<br>
DTM cannot be used in the OPUK of the common OTN. Thereby, owing to such an<br>
intermediate sub-layer, the device may not only be well applicable to various services, but<br>
also conveniently adapt for the OPUK. In this way, the application range of the OTN is<br>
expanded, and the bandwidth utilization and client access of the OTN become more flexible.<br>
Embodiment 3<br>
Figure 9 shows an optical cross-connect (OXC) device with a built-in DTM<br>
scheduling function provided by the present invention. As shown in Figure 9, the OXC<br>
device includes an adaptation module, an OPTUK module, a DTM cross-connect module, an<br>
OTN line processing module, and two or more pairs of wavelength multiplexers and<br>
wavelength demultiplexers.<br>
1)	The adaptation module is configured to adapt each client signal to a signal rate of<br>
specified DTM time-slots through an adaptation protocol in a transmitting direction. For<br>
example, GE signals are adapted to a rate represented by 2000 DTM time-slots through the<br>
GFP protocol, 140 M TDM signals are adapted to a rate represented by 300 DTM time-slots<br>
by means of bit or byte insertion. In a receiving direction, the adaptation module completes<br>
the deadaptation process and parses an original client signal format from a data stream having<br>
an adaptation protocol format.<br>
2)	The OPTUK module is configured to map all the signals adapted by the adaptation<br>
module to a specified DTM time-slot position of the OPTUK in a transmitting direction.<br>
The DTM time-slot is multiplexed by mapping the adapted signals to the specified time-slots.<br>
For example, the GE, after adapted by the GFP, occupies about 2000 DTM time-slots, an<br>
ESCON signal, after adapted by the GFP, occupies 400 DTM time-slots, and all other client<br>
signals after adaptation take up the rest DTM time-slots. The DTM time-slots occupy the<br>
whole space of the OPTUK, thus realizing the DTM multiplexing function of each client<br>
signal. After the multiplexing, the signal in the OPTUK format is transmitted to the DTM<br>
cross-connect module.<br>
The OPTUK implements the opposite function in the receiving direction, parses the<br>
data stream of each time-slot with an adaptation format from the signal in the OPTUK format.<br><br>
and transmits the data stream to the adaptation module to further parse an original signal.<br>
3)	The DTM cross-connect module is configured to realize the cross-connection of<br>
512 K of particles. The OPTUK signals respectively from the line and the tributary (the<br>
local mapping direction) are input into the DTM cross-connect module. Each OPTUK signal<br>
is in a synchronous state. The phase difference between the OPTUKs is adjusted by a simple<br>
frame adjustment circuit so as to achieve the synchronous cross-connection.<br>
4)	The OTN line processing module includes OPUK, ODUK, and OTUK framing<br>
functions in the OTN line. In a transmitting direction, the OPTUK signals obtained from the<br>
cross-connection of the DTM are mapped to the OPUK signals at the same rate so as to<br>
generate the ODUK OH for realizing the end-to-end management. A low-order ODUK<br>
signal is multiplexed to a high-order ODUK signal so as to generate a high-order OTUK OH<br>
including FEC. A colorful wavelength with a fixed frequency is achieved by electro-optic<br>
conversion. A mapping and de-mapping from the DTM to the OTN are also realized.<br>
Further, in a receiving direction, the optoelectronic conversion is fulfilled, the OTUK and<br>
ODUK OHs are terminated, and the signal in the OPTUK format is parsed and transmitted to<br>
the DTM cross-connect network.<br>
5)	Two or more pairs of wavelength multiplexers and wavelength demultiplexers are<br>
provided.<br>
The wavelength multiplexer is adapted to perform a wavelength-division multiplexing<br>
(WDM) on different colorful wavelengths transmitted from an optical line module. Upon<br>
requirements, the multiplexed signal may have its power amplified by a line amplifier;<br>
The wavelength demultiplexer is adapted to demultiplex the wavelength of the<br>
multiplexed signal received from the line, and output a single wavelength to the optical line<br>
unit to be processed.<br>
The result and function of this part are not described in detail herein for being the<br>
prior art.<br>
This embodiment may realize the same effect as the aforementioned embodiment.<br>
Meanwhile, since the channel of the OTN is refined by adopting 512 k of particles of the<br>
DTM, the line bandwidth utilization ratio is significantly enhanced.<br>
Embodiment 4<br>
Figure 10 shows the structure of an optical add/drop multiplexer (OADM) with a<br>
built-in DTM scheduling function provided by the present invention. As shown in FIG 10,<br><br>
the OADM structure includes an adaptation module, an OPTUK module, a DTM<br>
cross-connect module, an OTN line processing module, a wavelength<br>
multiplexing/demultiplexing module, and an OADM module.<br>
1)	The adaptation module is configured to adapt each client signal to a signal rate of<br>
specified DTM time-slots through an adaptation protocol in a transmitting direction. For<br>
example, GE signals are adapted to a rate represented by 2000 DTM time-slots through the<br>
GFP protocol, 140 M TDM signals are adapted to a rate represented by 300 DTM time-slots<br>
by means of bit or byte insertion. In a receiving direction, the adaptation module completes<br>
the deadaptation process and parses an original client signal format from a data stream having<br>
an adaptation protocol format.<br>
2)	The OPTUK module is configured to map all the signals adapted by the adaptation<br>
module to a specified DTM time-slot position of the OPTUK in a transmitting direction.<br>
The DTM time-slot is multiplexed by mapping the adapted signals to the specified time-slots.<br>
For example, the GE, after adapted by the GFP, occupies about 2000 DTM time-slots, an<br>
ESCON signal, after adapted by the GFP, occupies 400 DTM time-slots, and all other client<br>
signals after adaptation take up the rest DTM time-slots. The DTM time-slots occupy the<br>
whole space of the OPTUK, thus realizing the DTM multiplexing function of each client<br>
signal. After the multiplexing, the signal in the OPTUK fonnat is transmitted to the DTM<br>
cross-connect module.<br>
The OPTUK implements the opposite function in the receiving direction, the OPTUK<br>
module parses the data stream of each time-slot with an adaptation format from the signal in<br>
the OPTUK format, and transmits the data stream to the adaptation module to further parse an<br>
original signal.<br>
3)	The DTM cross-connect module is configured to realize the cross-connection of<br>
512 K of particles. The OPTUK signals respectively from the line and the tributary (the<br>
local mapping direction) are input into the DTM cross-connect module. Each OPTUK signal<br>
is in a synchronous state. The phase difference between the OPTUKs is adjusted by a simple<br>
frame adjustment circuit so as to achieve the synchronous cross-connection.<br>
4)	The OTN line processing module includes OPUK, ODUK, and OTUK framing<br>
functions in the OTN line. In a transmitting direction, the OPTUK signals obtained from the<br>
cross-connection of the DTM are mapped to the OPUK signals at the same rate so as to<br>
generate the ODUK OH for realizing the end-to-end management. A low-order ODUK<br><br>
signal is multiplexed to a high-order ODUK signal, so as to generate a high-order OTUK OH<br>
including FEC. A colorful wavelength with a fixed frequency is achieved by electro-optic<br>
conversion. A mapping and de-mapping from the DTM to the OTN are also realized.<br>
Further, in a receiving direction, the optoelectronic conversion is fulfilled, the OTUK and<br>
ODUK OHs are terminated, and the signal in the OPTUK format is parsed and transmitted to<br>
the DTM cross-connect network.<br>
5)	The wavelength multiplexing/demultiplexing module is configured to fulfill the<br>
demultiplexing of a band to a single wavelength, or the multiplexing of a local wavelength<br>
into a band.<br>
6)	The OADM module includes at least a pre-amplifier, a power amplifier, and a<br>
wavelength block (WB) module. A required wavelength is emitted to the wavelength<br>
multiplexing/demultiplexing module through the WB module. Meanwhile, an uplink band<br>
of the multiplexing module is multiplexed to the line.<br>
This embodiment may also achieve the same effect as the above embodiment.<br>
In view of the above, the embodiments of the device and method for transmitting a<br>
DTM on an OTN provided by the present invention have the following effectives.<br>
1)	The mapping problem that the DTM cannot be directly OVER to the OTN is solved.<br>
Since 512 k of particles of the DTM are adopted to refine the OTN channel, the line<br>
bandwidth utilization ratio is significantly enhanced. This technology may be adapted to<br>
improve the conventional TMUX and applied to the DWDM and OTN products, and may<br>
realize the transparent transmission of any service at any sub-rate. Besides, this technology<br>
apparently saves more bandwidth than the method of mapping from the DTM to VC then to<br>
STM-N and further to the OTN, and does not need additional complicated OH and pointer<br>
processing of the SDH layer, thus reducing the process cost.<br>
2)	The present invention is applicable to various services and has strong service<br>
adaptability. Meanwhile, the present invention achieves high QoS real-time transmission for<br>
various data services, video services, and TDM services, expands the adaptable ranges of<br>
services and sub-rates for the OTN, and realizes stepless adaptation at any rate.<br>
3)	The device of the present invention is built in an OXC or OADM to replace the<br>
conventional TDM exchange plane, or simulate the function of a data plene. Thereby, the<br>
capability of unified plane scheduling is indeed realized, and the device cost and difficulties<br>
in management are both reduced.<br><br>
