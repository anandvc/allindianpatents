LUBRICATING OIL COMPOSITION COMPRISING p-DITHIOPHOSPHORYLATED PROPIONIOC ACID, TRIARYL PHOSPHATE AND BASE OIL<br>
The present invention relates to a lubricating oil composition which exhibits excellent lubricating performance, even under severe high pressure/high load working conditions.<br>
The use of industrial machines at higher speeds, under higher pressures, and the miniaturization thereof has resulted in machine elements such as hydraulic machines, compressors, turbines, gear elements and bearings being operated under severer conditions.<br>
The lubricating oil used must therefore exhibit excellent lubricating performance to sufficiently guarantee the life of these machines over long periods even when they are used at high pressure, high speed, high load and high temperatures.<br>
In response to these demands, zinc dialkyl dithiophosphates have been used in anti-wear lubricating oil compositions for lubricating oils for industrial machines. However these compounds are disadvantageous in terms of their instability to hydrolysis on contamination with water and their instability to thermal oxidation at high temperature and high pressure, and in that an unpleasant odour is generated as the lubricating oil deteriorates.<br>
In addition to the abovementioned problems, there are increasing concerns over the use of zinc compounds such as zinc dialkyl dithiophosphates in view of recent questions regarding environmental protection and toxicity,<br>
Anti-wear lubricating oil compositions comprising sulphur compounds, phosphorous compounds and phosphorous-sulphur-based combinations thereof are already known as<br><br>
2inc-free anti-wear lubricating oils which do not contain zinc dialkyl dithiophosphates.<br>
Specifically, the combination of sulphurated hydrocarbon and acidic phosphoric acid ester and the combination of triaryl phosphorothionate, triaryl phosphate and acidic phosphate ester amine salt, as disclosed in GB Patent Number 1415964, are known, but the corrosive properties and odour of sulphurated hydrocarbon poses problems, and highly active acidic phosphate esters are disadvantageous in that, for example, they cause hydrolytic decerioration and a decrease in thermal oxidation stability.<br>
The present invention therefore aims to provide a<br>
lubricating oil composition wliich contains as little ash<br>
(e.g. 2inc) as possible and has excellent anti-wear<br>
properties, even when used under severe high pressure,<br>
high speed and high load conditions, and which is <br>
excellent in terms of itg thermal oxidation stability,<br>
water resistance and odour and also in terms of the <br>
environment, safety and its lubricating oil performance<br>
in practice,	<br>
The present invention provides a lubricating oil<br>
composition, comprising p-dithiophosphorylated propionic acid (A), triaryl phosphate (B) and base oil comprising mineral oil and/or synthetic oil.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, p-dithiophosphorylated propionic acid (A) is represented by the general formula (1) below:-<br>
S=P(-OR^l2SCH2CHtR2KOOK	<br>
wherein R1 which may be identical or different, represents a branched alkyl group of from 3 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably from 3 to 4 carbon atoms, and R^ represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br><br>
R1 can be chosen from the following branched alkyl groups:- isopropyl group, branched butyl group, branched pentyl group, branched hexyl group, branched heptyl group, and branched octyl group.<br>
Examples of R2 include hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl groups.  Preferably, R2 is a methyl group, ethyl group or hydrogen group.  It is particularly preferred that R^ is methyl.<br>
Specific examples of such compounds include 3-(O,0-diisopropyldithiophosphoryl)propionic acid, 3-(0,0-diisopropyldithiophosphoryl)-2-methyl-propionic acid, 3-iO.O-diisobutyldithiophosphoryl)-propionic acid and 3-(0,0-diiBObutyldithiophospboryl)-2-methyl-propionio acid.<br>
The amount of p-dithiophosphorylated propionic acid (A) added in the present invention is preferably from 0.001 to 1.0 % by weight, more preferably from 0.001 to 0.5 % by weight, even more preferably from 0.001 to o.l % by weight, and most preferably from O.QOS to 0-Q5 % by weight, with respect to the total amount of lubricating oil composition.<br>
If the amount of (A) added is less than 0-001 % by weight, adequate synergistic effects may not be achieved, whereas if the amo-mit of (A) added exceeds 0.5 % by weight, the lubricating performance reaches saturation, and there may be a deterioration in thermal oxidation stability, hydrolysis stability and corrosion properties, which is undesirable.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the txiaryl phosphate tB) is represented by the general formula (2) below:-<br>
0=P(-0-R313	(2)<br>
wherein each R^ is independently a phenyl group or a phenyl group having alkyl group(s) of from 1 to 9 carbon atoms.<br><br>
Specific examples of suitable triaryl phosphates (E) include triphenyl phosphate ester, tricresyl phosphate ester, triethyl phenyl phosphate ester, tripropyl phenyl phosphate ester, tributyl phenyl phosphate ester, triheptyl phenyl phosphate ester, trihexyl phenyl phosphate ester, triheptyl phenyl phosphate ester, trioctyl phenyl phosphate ester and trinonyl phenyl phosphate ester.<br>
The amount of triaryl phosphate (B) used in the present invention is preferably from 0.05 to 10 % by weight, more preferably from 0,05 to S % weight and most preferably from 0.l to 2 % by weight with respect to the total amount of lubricating oil base oil.<br>
If less Chan 0.05 % by weight of (a) is added, sufficient lubricating performance may not be achieved, whereas if more than 10 % by weight of (B) is added, the lubricating performance reaches saturation and there may be a deterioration in thermal oxidation stability and hydrolysis stability, which is undesirable.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the lubricating oil composition exhibits wear corresponding to no more than 150 mg, which meets DIM 51524 (Part 2) standard, in a "Vickers V104 C" vane pump test (according to IP 281).<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the lubricating oil compoaitioiv exhibits vane wear corresponding to no more than 15 mg and ring wear corresponding to no tnore than 75 mg, which meets "Vickers" standard M-2950-S, in a "Vickers 35VQ25A" vane pump test (according to "Viewers" M-2950-S).<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the lubricating oil composition exhibits vane wear corresponding to no more than 10 mg and ring wear corresponding to no more than SO mg, which weets "General<br><br>
Motors" Standard LS-2LH.03.04.06, in a "Viewers SBVQSSA" vane pump test (according to "Vickers" M-2950-S).<br>
The lubricating oil composition according to the<br>
present invention may be used as a hydraulic oil<br>
composition, a compressor oil composition, a turbine oil<br>
composition, a bearing oil composition, and/or a gear oil<br>
composition.	^ ,<br>
There are no particular limitations regarding the base oil in the liiiricating oil composition of the present invention.  Preferably, said base oil is petroleum-based, synthetic hydrocarbon-based and/or ester-based.<br>
The preferred physical properties of the base oil are as follows:<br>
a kinematic viscosity of from 2 to 680 mm^/s (40'C) , preferably from 5 to 320 mm^/s (40°C) and more preferably from S to 220 mm^/s (40'C) ,-<br>
a total sulphur 'content (% by weight] of from 0 to 1% and preferably from 0 to 0.3%;<br>
a total nitrogen content (weighC ppm) of from 0 to 100 ppm and preferably from 0 to 30 ppm; and/or<br>
an aniline point of from 80 to lao^C and preferably from 100 to 125'=C.<br>
Petroleum-based lubricating oil base oils which can be used in the present invention include solvent purified base oil, hydrogenation purified base oil and highly hydrocracked base oil.  Such base oils can be used individually or as mixtures.<br>
Highly hydrocracked base oil is a base oil having a viscosity index of at least 130 (typically from 145 to 155).  Said base oil can be obtained by taking a starting material wax (slack wax) which has been separated by solvent dewaxing, and hydrogenating said wax in the presence of a catalyst (catalytic degradation) to convert linear paraffin to branched paraffin.  Alternatively,<br><br>
said base oil can be obtained by _taking as starting material the hydrogen and carbon monoxide obtained by subjecting natural gas (methane or the like) to the gas formation process (partial o:^idation) , then subjecting said starting material to Fischer-Tropsch polymerisation to yield heavy linear paraffin, and then modifying said heavy linear paraffin to catalytic degradation as described above.<br>
The synthetic hydrocarbon-based base oil used in the present invention can be an olefin oligomer obtained by homapolymerizing or copolymerizing mon.ow.er chosen from linear or branched olefinic hydrocarbons of from 3 to 15, preferably from 4 to 12, carbon atoms.<br>
In the present invention, petroleum-based base oil or synthetic hydrocarbon-based base oil can be used individually, or in mixtures thereof.   '<br>
Triaryl phosphate esters have long been known as anti-wear agents for use under relatively mild conditions, and, as disclosed in US Patent Number 5922G57 (corresponding to Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Number H10-579g3), p-dithiophosphorylated propionic acid is known to improve extreme pressure performance and prevent gear seizure.<br>
However, in the present invention, the anti-wear properties under severe high pressure/high load conditions can be improved to ecjuivalent to or better than those achieved when p-dithiophosphorylated propionic acid is used alone, by the combined use of the abovementioned anti-wear component triarylphosphate ester.<br>
In addition to the abovementioned indispensable components, various other commonly used additives may also be added if necessary in the present invention in order to further improve performance.<br><br>
Thus, it is possible to add commonly known lubricating oil additives such as antioxidant, mat preventer, metal deactivator, detergent disperaant, anti-wear agent, extreme-pressure agent, friction regulator, flow point depressor, viscosity index improver, anti-emulsification agent and defoamer.<br>

It is particularly appropriate to use the lubricating oil composition of the present invention as a hydraulic oil composition as described above-  However, said lubricating oil composition can also be used in other ways, for example, as a compressor oil composition.<br><br>
turbine oil composition, bearing oil composition or gear oil composition.<br>
The present invention will now be described with reference to the following Examples, which are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention in any way. Examples<br>
The present invention, is described specifically below by means of hydraulic oil working examples.<br>
Hydrogenation-purified base oil having a kinematic viscosity of 31 mm^/a at 40°C was used as the base oil, and the components shown below were added to yield base lubricating oil compositions.<br>
The anti-wear agents shown in Tables 2, 3 and 4 were added to this base lubricating oil composition A (Table 1) to yield test oil having a kinematic viscosity of 32 mm^/s at 40'C.<br>
The amount of the various additive components in the test oils of Working Examples 1 and 2 and Comparative Examples 1 to 10 are given as parts by weight with respect to the test oil.<br>

the wear ca the vane are ring was measured after the tsst. The "Vickers" M-2950-5 criterion is that the vane<br><br>
equivalent to no more than 15 tng and the ring wear be equivalent to no more than 75 mg.<br>
The "General Motors" LS-2 LH.C3.04.06 criteria are stricter; vane wear corresponding to no more than 10 mg and ring wear corresponding to no more than 50 mg.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Note:   All   commercial   anti-wear  hydraulic  oils   used were zinc   free.<br><br><br><br>
Comparative Examples 1 and 2 did not exhibit adequate anti-wear properties in the "Vickers V104G" vane pump test and did not have the anti-vjear properties required to pass German Standard DIN 51524 [part 2). Comparative Examples 3 and 4 did pass German Standard DIN 51524 (part 2) in the "Vickers V104C" vane pump test, but did not exhibit adequate anti-wear properties in the "Vickers 35'VQ25A" vane pump test and did not pass the "Vickers" M-2950-S standard or "General Motors" LS-2 LH.03.04.05 standard. Comparative Examples 7 and 8 exhibited anti-wear properties sufficient to pass German Standard DIN 51524 (part 2) in the V104C vane pump test, but their anti-wear properties were not sufficient to pass the "VicJcers" M-2950-S standard or the "General Motors" LS-2-LH.03.04.06 standard.<br>
As is clear from the compositions shown in Table 3 and the results shown in Table 5, the lubricating oil composition according to the present invention [Working Examples 1 and 2) have excellent anti-wear properties sufficient to pass German Standard DIN 51524 (Part 2), "Vickers" M-29S0-S standard and "General Motors" LS-2 LH.03.04.06 standard, in vane pump tests "Vickers" V104C and 35VQ25A, and their lubricating oil performance is sufficient for use as a hydraulic oil in high-pressure applications.  Comparative Example 5 shows increased total wear in both tests when compared to Working Examples 1 and 2.<br>
However, when the additive combination of the present invention is not used (comparative examples), and in the case of commercial zinc-free hydraulic oils and zinc-based hydraulic oils, the anti-wear properties and extreme-pressure performance are both considerably poorer and there are problems when these oils are used as lubricating oils for modern industrial machines which<br><br>
have been miniaturized and work at high speeds, high pressures and high precision. Comparative Examples 9 and 10<br>
Comparative Examples 9 and 10 were performed in order to see whether the thermal oxidative stability is better when R^ in the fl-dithiophosphorylated propionic acid is hydrogen or when it is a methyl group. The composition and results for Comparative Examples 9 and 10 are shown in Table 6.<br>
The thermal oxidative stability test was performed as follows: 200 ml of test oils of Comparative Examples 9 and 10, obtained by combining p-dithiophosphorylated propionic acid and antioxidant and rust preventer, were independently introduced into 250 ml beakers, a steel sample and copper sample of diameter 0.6 mm and length 7.6 mm, which had been polished using # 240 alumina polishing paper, washed and dried, were intersected and the test oils were applied thereto, and the test oils were subjected to thermal oxidative deterioration for 33S hours in a 140°C oven, and after the test the test oils were suction-f iltexed using a 0.8 jim hole diameter filter and the amount of sludge obtained, the external appearance of the copper sample and steel sample and the colour of the test oil (ASTH D150D) were measured.<br><br><br>
*1   Hydrogenated purified base oil B: kinematic<br>
viscosity 32 Cst (at 40-0,<br>
Sulphur content no greater than 5 ppm, viscosity<br>
index 110 *2   Antioxidant: under the trade designation "Irganox<br>
L13S": manufactured by Ciba Speciality Chemicals *3   Rust preventer; under the trade designation "IRGAMET<br>
39", manufacture by Ciba Speciality Chemicals<br>
As is clear from the results of the thermal oxidative stability tests shown in Table 6, the compound of Comparative Example 10 in which one of the hydrogen atoms on the a-carbon of the p-dithiophosphorylated propionic acid has been substituted by an alkyl group, undergoes less change in colour and produces less sludge, that is, is more stable, than the compound of Comparative Example 9 in which there is no alkyl substitution of the<br><br>
hydrogen atoms on the a-carbon. If there are too many carbon atoms in the alkyl group substitutions on the a-carbon, anti-wear properties deteriorate and so in order to achieve both thermal oxidative stability and anti-wear properties, the alkyl group substituent is most preferably a methyl group. Advantages of the present invention<br>
Lubricating oil compositions of the present invention contain no, or almost no, ash-forming substances such as zinc dialkyl dithiophosphates, in view of environmental and safety considerations; the resulting anti-wear lubricating oil compositions exhibit excellent anti-wear with respect to various machine elements even when used under severe high pressure, high speed and high load conditions. Accordingly, the lubricating oil compositions of the present invention are highly effective in the provision of lubricating oil which can guarantee the reliability of equipment over long periods, in response to the recently developed high speed, high pressure and high precision industrial machines.<br><br><br>
