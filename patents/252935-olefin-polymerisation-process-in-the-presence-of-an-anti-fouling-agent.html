				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention concerns a new olefin polymerisation process for preventing<br>
fouling in the polymerisation reactor. The invention concerns propylene<br>
polymerisation processes using a metallocene-type catalyst, or Ziegler Natta-type<br>
catalyst.<br>
Olefin polymerisation processes are well known. Among the processes, slurry<br>
polymerisation in suspension in a solvent or in the liquid monomer is extensively<br>
practiced. Such processes are performed in a stirred tank reactor, or in closed loop<br>
reactors. One or more reactors can be used. In such processes, solid polymer<br>
particles are grown on small catalyst particles. Released heat of polymerisation is<br>
eliminated through cooling through the reactor's walls and/or a heat exchanger.<br>
However, it has been found on an industrial scale that while the polymer particles are<br>
insoluble or substantially insoluble in the diluent, the polymer product has some<br>
tendency to deposit on the walls of the poly merisation reactor. This so -called<br>
"fouling" leads to a decrease in the efficiency of heat exchange between the reactor<br>
bulk and the coolant around the reactor. This leads in some cases to loss of reactor<br>
control due to overheating, or to reactor or down stream polymer processing<br>
equipment failure due to formation of agglomerates (ropes, chunks).<br>
This "fouling" is caused in part by fines and also by the build up of electrostatic<br>
charge on the walls on the reactor. Attempts to avoid fouling during slurry<br>
polymerisation have been made by adding an antifouling agent in the polymerisation<br>
medium. Typically, the antifouling agent acts for example to make the medium more<br>
conductive, thus preventing to some extent the formation of electrostatic charge,<br>
which is one cause of the build -up of polymer on the wall of the reactor.<br><br>
US 3,995,097 discloses a process whereby an olefin is polymerised in a hydrocarbon<br>
diluent using a catalyst comprising chromium oxide associated with at least one of<br>
silica, alumina, zirconia, or thoria. Fouling of the reactor is said to be reduced by<br>
adding a composition, which comprises a mixture of aluminium or chromium salts of<br>
an alkyl salicylic acid and an alkaline metal alkyl sulfosuccinate. It is said that it is<br>
desirable to dissolve the anti-fouling composition in a hydrocarbon solvent, such as<br>
n-decane. Further, it is said that paraffins of 9 to 20 carbon atoms are the preferred<br>
solvents, although naphthenic solvents also are mentioned.<br>
EP 0,005,215 is concerned with a process fo r polymerising olefins in a hydrocarbon<br>
diluent again using a catalyst comprising calcined chromium compound associated<br>
with at least one of silica, alumina, zirconia or thoria or using a catalyst system such<br>
as those disclosed in US 2,908,671, 3,919,185 a nd 3,888,835. The process uses an<br>
anti-fouling agent comprising a compound containing a sulphonic acid residue. The<br>
anti-fouling agent is a composition comprising (a) a polysulphone copolymer (b) a<br>
polymeric polyamine, and (c) an oil soluble sulphonic ac id. It is mentioned that the<br>
solvent for the anti-fouling additive can be the same material used as the diluent in<br>
the polymerisation reaction or it can be different, so long as it does not interfere with<br>
the polymerisation reaction. In the Example, the ad ditive product known as STADIS<br>
450 (in toluene) is used as the anti fouling agent.<br>
US 6,022,935 (equivalent to EP 0,803,514) discloses a process for the preparation of<br>
polymers of C2-C12 alk-1-ene using a catalyst system containing a metallocene<br>
complex. An antistatic agent is used in the process. It is said that in general, all<br>
antistatic agents which are suitable for polymerisation may be used. Examples given<br>
are salt mixtures comprising calcium salts of medialanic acid and chromium salts of<br>
N-stearylanthranilic acid, C12-C22 fatty acid soaps of sulfonic esters of the general<br>
formula (RR')-CHOSO3Me, esters of polyethylene glycols with fatty acids, and<br>
polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers. STADIS 450 also is mentioned. The antistatic agent is<br>
preferably used in solution.<br><br>
EP 0,820,474 is concerned with preventing sheeting problems in gas phase reactors<br>
in polymerisation processes, which comprise at least one loop reactor followed by at<br>
least one gas phase reactor. These problems are addressed using a fouling<br>
preventive agent that is a mixture of Cr salt of C14-C18 alkyl-salicylic acid, a Ca dialkyl<br>
sulphosuccinate and a copolymer of alkylmethacrylate with 2 -methyl-5-vinylpyridine<br>
in solution in xylene. Chromium-type catalysts, Ziegler-type catalysts and<br>
metallocene catalysts are mentioned. In the examples, the fouling prevention agent<br>
used is the commercial product TOLAD 511 in propane or ASA 3 (in xylene).<br>
JP 2000-327,707 discloses a slurry olefin polymerisation method. The method<br>
addresses the problem of fou ling and sheeting of the reactor wall, which is observed<br>
particularly when the catalyst is a supported metallocene catalyst. The method is said<br>
to be carried out in the presence of one compound chosen from polyalkylene oxide<br>
alkyl ether, alkyl diethanolami ne, polyoxyalkylene alkyl amine, and polyalkylene oxide<br>
block. The chosen compound is used in the liquid form.<br>
The anti-fouling agents disclosed in JP 2000-327,707 generally may be considered<br>
as polymeric viscous products. Their viscosity (in the region o f a Brookfield viscosity<br>
of about 1200cps) makes the anti -fouling agent difficult to pump.<br>
It is possible to reduce viscosity by heating the agent and work has been done in the<br>
past to pump heated anti -fouling agent to solve this problem. However, the pr esent<br>
inventors have found that this in fact is technically complicated and causes some<br>
security concerns<br>
EP 1,316,566 discloses propylene polymerisation in a bulk loop reactor. The<br>
disclosure is concerned specifically with the transition from one catal yst type to<br>
another in a bulk loop reactor and with problems associated therewith. The process<br>
involves injecting a metallocene catalyst and a Ziegler -Natta catalyst into the bulk<br>
loop reactor. It is mentioned on page 3 paragraph [0009] that in one embod iment, a<br><br>
of a stream of propylene with a stream of catalyst. The antifouiing agent is used in<br>
liquid form. According to the disclosure of EP 1,316,566 any antifouiing ag ent would<br>
not at any stage be solvated in a solvent comprising cyclohexane.<br>
In view of the above, it will be seen that many so called anti -fouling agents for use in<br>
various olefin polymerisation processes are known. However, there have been some<br>
problems associated with prior known agents. An increase of catalyst consumption<br>
due to loss of activity in the presence of the anti -fouling agent is observed, even at<br>
the low levels typically used in the polymerisation process. Catalyst activity loss is<br>
linked to the poisoning of active sites, for example by the polar moieties of the anti -<br>
fouling agent (alcohol and sulphonate ...). Other problems with prior known agents<br>
relate to problems of toxity. This is a particular concern with Cr -based anti-fouling<br>
agent or with agents such as commercial Stadis 450 as described in EP 0,005,215,<br>
because of its toluene (as solvent) and active ingredient content.<br>
Also, practical problems are encountered with many previously known anti -fouling<br>
agents. These practical problems a rise because some antifouiing agents are usable<br>
only with a given catalyst type. This makes transitions between catalyst systems<br>
during processing more difficult.<br>
A further problem arises for a propylene polymerisation process. This is because it is<br>
not desirable for the propylene monomer to be used as a suspension medium for the<br>
anti-fouling agent, because, in these circumstances, the viscosity means that the<br>
liquid is too difficult to pump. The viscosity is important because this affects the ease<br>
of pumping the liquid. Further, the concentration of the pumped liquid affects the<br>
accuracy of pumping and also problems relating to pressure. With regard to the<br>
accuracy of pumping, it will be understood that a degree of error of, for example, plus<br>
or minus 0.5 on a solution of concentration that is pumped at a rate of 1 litre per hour<br>
has more effect than on a solution that is pumped at a rate of 5 litres per hour, where<br><br>
In this sense, there remains a particular need to provide new anti -fouling agents for<br>
use in propylene polymerisation processes where it is not desirable for the propylene<br>
monomer to be used as a suspension medium for the anti -fouling agent.<br>
The present inventors have identified that a solvated anti -fouling agent may solve this<br>
problem.<br>
There is however a technical prejudice against using a solvent since the introduction<br>
of a further material into the polymerisation medium can affect the reaction and the<br>
end product and generally is to be avoided.<br>
To this end, the present inventors identified and took into consideration several<br>
desirable so-called results to be achieved when trying to provide a solvated anti<br>
fouling agent. Firstly, a "light" solvent was needed, that was easy to remove from the<br>
polymer product. Secondly, the solvent had to be free of toluene or aromatics for<br>
safety reasons. Thirdly, the solvent had to sufficiently dissolve the antifouling agent.<br>
The antifouling agent is generally viscous and needs t o be dissolved in order to<br>
improve the spraying accuracy. Finally, there had to be ease of separation of the<br>
monomer and the polymer product from the solvent.<br>
This problem now has been solved at least partially by the provision of a propylene<br>
polymerisation process carried out in the presence of an anti -fouling agent;<br>
characterised in that the anti-fouling agent comprises an anti-fouling polymer<br>
containing:<br>
(1)	one or more blocks -(CH2-CH2-O)k- where each k is in the range from 1 to<br>
50; and<br>
(2)	one or more blocks -(CH2-CH(R)-O)n- where R comprises an alkyl group<br>
having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and each n is in the range from 1 to 50;<br>
and terminated by R' and R" end groups, wherein R' is OH or an alkoxy having from<br><br>
and the antifouling polymer is solvated in a solvent comprising cyclohexane when<br>
added to the polymerisation medium.<br>
In the present process, (CH2CH(R)O)n blocks generally may be considered to be<br>
lipophilic whereas (CH2CH2O)k blocks may be considered to be hydrophilic.<br>
Preferably, one end of the polymer is hydrophilic and the other end or the middle of<br>
the polymer is lipophilic.<br>
Such a polymer as contained in the present anti -fouling agent is known per se,<br>
particularly outside the field of olefin polymerisation. In this regard, such a polymer is<br>
known as a lubricant or washing detergent.<br>
However, it has been surprisingly found by the present inventors that such a polymer<br>
may be used advantageously in a propylene polymerisation m ethod when in a<br>
solvent comprising cyclohexane. The very good solubility of such a polymer as<br>
described above in cyclohexane was unexpected. In one embodiment, a "perfect"<br>
solubility of polymer in cyclohexane at room temperature was determined. In addition<br>
the selection of cyclohexane also fulfils the low toxicity and the easy removal<br>
requirements.<br>
The diluted polymer has reduced viscosity. This makes it easier to pump, especially<br>
in the small quantities generally used in the method. Further, it will be a ppreciated<br>
that cyclohexane avoids the safety problems that are associated with some other<br>
solvents such as toluene and aromatics, which hitherto have been widely used as<br>
solvents for anti-fouling agents.<br>
Furthermore, it has been found that improved acti vity or at least no loss of activity<br>
occurs in the present process as compared with an equivalent process which uses<br>
Stadis 450 in toluene as the anti -fouling agent. This means that the present method<br>
suitably can be used in an olefin polymerisation proces s carried out in the presence<br><br>
catalyst or a Ziegler-Natta type catalyst. This is particularly advantageous since, for<br>
logistical reasons, it is preferable to be able to use a s ingle anti-fouling agent in olefin<br>
polymerisation processes regardless of the type of catalyst. This is however not<br>
possible with most previously known anti -fouling agents without loss of activity with<br>
one of the catalyst types.<br>
Preferably, the polymer in the present anti-fouling agent is diluted to a concentration<br>
of from 10 to 20 wt%. The optimum concentration can be obtained by balancing the<br>
advantages of a lower viscosity and a less concentrated liquid against the<br>
disadvantages associated with the intr oduction of a large volume of a solvent.<br>
It will be understood in the present process that, where necessary, an activating<br>
agent will be needed to activate the catalyst or to modify the product polymer<br>
properties. Suitable activating agents, where neede d, are well known in this art.<br>
Suitable activating agents include organometallic or hydride compounds of Group I to<br>
III, for example those of general formula AIR 3 such as Et3AI, Et2AICI, and (i-Bu)3AI.<br>
One preferred activating agent is triisobutylaluminium .<br>
Where the polymerisation process is a slurry polymerisation process, typically, the<br>
polymerisation process will be carried out in suspension in the bulk liquid propylene<br>
monomer. A separate catalyst diluent may be required.<br>
The anti-fouling agent may be added at any suitable stage in the process. The<br>
addition can be carried out continuously or batch wise. The solvated anti -fouling<br>
polymer may be added to the polymerisation medium separately or may be mixed<br>
with the propylene monomer and then added to the polymerisation medium.<br>
Advantageously, the solvated anti-fouling agent may be added via the monomer<br>
header in order to introduce the agent evenly in the reactor.<br>
The anti-fouling agent desirably is liquid at room temperature and , as such, the anti -<br><br>
determine whether the anti -fouling polymer is liquid at room temperature. These are:<br>
the molecular weight of the anti -fouling polymer and the wt% ethylene oxide in the<br>
anti-fouling polymer.<br>
Preferably, the wt% ethylene oxide in the anti -fouling polymer is in the range of from<br>
5 to 40 wt%, more preferably from 8 to 30 wt%, even more preferably from 10 to 20<br>
wt%, most preferably about 10 wt%.<br>
Further, the anti-fouling polymer preferably has a molecular weight (MW), not higher<br>
than 5000. In order to avoid any poisoning effect on the catalyst and to minimise<br>
elution of residues from the formed polymer product, the molecular weight is greater<br>
than 1000 Daltons, preferably greater than 2000 Daltons, more preferably in the<br>
range from 2000-4500 Daltons.<br>
It will be understood from the above that in order to ensure that the anti -fouling<br>
polymer is liquid at room temperature, one must balance the molecular weight of the<br>
anti-fouling polymer and the wt% ethylene oxide in the anti -fouling polymer. It is to<br>
be noted that the activity of the anti -fouling polymer decreases as the molecular<br>
weight increases. Therefore, in practice, it may be desirable to increase the wt%<br>
ethylene oxide in the anti-fouling polymer in order to ensure that the solvated anti •<br>
fouling agent is liquid at room temperature, rather than increase the molecular weight<br>
of the anti-fouling polymer.<br>
It will be appreciated from the above that the molecular weight of t he anti-fouling<br>
polymer should be selected in combination with the wt% ethylene oxide content in<br>
the anti-fouling polymer. For guidance value, the present inventors have found that<br>
an anti-fouling polymer having an ethylene oxide content of 10 wt% and a m olecular<br>
weight in the range of from 4000 to 4500 is particularly useful in the present process.<br>
Cyclohexane has a high freezing point (6.5 °C) and a solution of the present anti -<br><br>
weather it is desirable in the present process to use a mixture of solvents in the anti -<br>
fouling agent. Where a mixture of solvents is used, the mixture of solvents comprises<br>
cyclohexane and another solvent which serves to lower the freezing point of the anti-<br>
fouling agent.<br>
Preferably, the another solvent lowers the freezing point without substantially<br>
reducing the solubility of the anti -fouling agent in the solvent. To this end, preferably,<br>
the other solvent is selected from the group consisting o f linear hexane, branched<br>
hexane, linear pentane, branched pentane, cyclopentane, and mixtures thereof.<br>
More preferably, the other solvent is selected from the group consisting of branched<br>
hexane and branched pentane. Branched hexane and branched pentane are<br>
preferred for safety reasons. Isohexane is particularly preferred. As such, the<br>
mixture of solvents preferably comprises cyclohexane and isohexane. This<br>
advantageously serves to lower the freezing point of the anti -fouling agent in solution,<br>
without reducing solubility.<br>
Preferably, the mixture of solvents contains cyclohexane and up to about 15 wt% of<br>
the another solvent, preferably from 8 to 15 wt%, most preferably about 10 wt%.<br>
Generally, the anti-fouling polymer is used at the lowest possible concentration<br>
effective to prevent or substantially reduce fouling. This can be determined by routine<br>
experimentation. Preferably it is used at a concentration of from 0.5 to 20 ppmw in<br>
the polymerisation medium, more preferably from 2 to 10 ppmw.<br>
Preferably, the anti-fouling polymer is a block polymer, more preferably a triblock<br>
polymer.<br>
Preferably, the anti-fouling polymer is a block polymer of general formula:<br>
R'-(CH2-CH2-O)k-(CH2-CH(R)-O)n -(CH2-CH2-O)m-R" (I)<br><br>
where R comprises an alkyl group; R' and R" are end groups; k is from 1 to 50; n is<br>
from 1 to 50; m is greater than or equal to 1; a is from 1 to 50; b is from 1 to 50; and c<br>
is from 0 to 50. k and m may be the same or different.<br>
Preferably R is a C1 to C3 alkyl group. More preferably, R is a methyl group.<br>
Preferably, in one embodiment, k is greater than 1 and m is greater than 1. Also<br>
preferably, in another embodiment a is 0 or c is 0.<br>
Preferred R' and R" groups include H; OH; alkyl, and alkoxy groups. Preferred alkyl<br>
groups are C1 to C3 alkyl groups. Preferred alkoxy groups are C1 to C3 alkoxy<br>
groups. In this regard, as mentioned above, the ends of the polymer should be<br>
hydrophilic. Therefore, in formulae (I) and (II) above , it is preferred that R' is OH or<br>
an alkoxy group, preferably OH or a C1 to C3 alkoxy group. Further, it is preferred<br>
that R" is H or an alkyl group, preferably H or a C1 to C3 alkyl group.<br>
A particularly preferred anti -fouling polymer has general formu la (III):<br>
R'-(CH2-CH2-O)k-(CH2-CH(CH3)-O)n -(CH2-CH2-O)m-R"	(III)<br>
where R', R", k, n, and m independently are as defined anywhere above in relation to<br>
formulae I and II.<br>
A further preferred anti -fouling polymer has general formula (IV):<br>
OH-(CH2-CH2-O)k-(CH2-CH(R)-O)n -(CH2-CH2-O)m-H	(IV)<br>
where R, k, n, and m independently are as defined anywhere above.<br><br>
It will be appreciated that, by virtue of the preferred molecular weights for the present<br>
anti-fouling polymer and the preferred ethylene oxide co ntents in the present anti -<br>
fouling polymer given above, preferred values for a, b, c, k, n, and m can be derived.<br>
The present process may be used to make a propylene homopolymer or copolymer<br>
or higher order polymer. Where the present process is used to m ake a propylene<br>
copolymer or higher order polymer, preferred comonomers include ethylene and<br>
butylene. The copolymer or higher order polymer may be in a random, alternating, or<br>
block configuration. Preferred copolymers include a propylene -ethylene copolymer<br>
and a propylene-butylene copolymer. A preferred terpolymer is a propylene -<br>
ethylene-butylene terpolymer.<br>
Where the copolymer or higher order polymer is in a block configuration, one way of<br>
making the polymer is to make the homopolymer "blocks" and, su bsequently, to<br>
introduce these pre-made "blocks" into the polymerisation medium with a<br>
comonomer. Alternatively, the "block" polymer can be made in a polymerisation<br>
medium containing the propylene monomer with a small quantity of the comonomer.<br>
A preferred reaction temperature range may be said to be from 40°C to 110°C, more<br>
preferably from 50 to 90 °C, most preferably from 60 to 80°C.<br>
A preferred applied pressure range may be said to be from 5 to 200 barg, more<br>
preferably from 30 to 70 barg depending on the reactor configuration and on the<br>
diluent.<br>
Generally, Ziegler-Natta type catalysts usable in the present process comprise a<br>
transition metal compound of Group IV -VIII (mainly Mg, Ti or V) supported or not on a<br>
carrier. Such catalysts are well known i n the art. Examples of Ziegler-Natta catalysts<br>
are TiCl4, TiCl3, VCl4, VOCl3. Titanium chloride supported on a chlorinated Mg<br><br>
Late transition metal catalysts usable in the present process include ni ckel<br>
complexes and iron complexes such as disclosed for example in Ittel et al. (S.T. Ittel,<br>
L.K. Johnson and M. Brookhaert, in Chem. Rev., 2000,1169.) and in Gibson and<br>
Spitzmesser (V.C. Gibson and S.K. Spitzmesser, in Chem. Rev., 2003,283.).<br>
Catalysts of this type will be well known to a person skilled in this art. _<br>
Generally, metallocene-type catalysts usable in the present process comprise an<br>
organometallic complex. A preferred metallocene -type catalyst is a complex of an<br>
organometallic compound and M AO.<br>
In the present process, it is generally preferred that the process is carried out in the<br>
presence of a metallocene-type catalyst. It is further preferred that the metallocene -<br>
type catalyst is activated by tri isobutyl aluminium as the activating agent . It is also<br>
preferred that the metallocene-type catalyst is supported, desirably on a silica<br>
support.<br>
Particularly preferred metallocene -type catalysts will be governed by the desired end<br>
product. In this regard, the skilled person will know certain pre ferred metallocene-<br>
type catalysts for preparing a syndiotactic polypropylene. For example, a<br>
metallocene-type catalyst having a general formula (1) is preferred for making a<br>
syndiotactic polypropylene****************:<br>
R"(Cp)(Cp')iyjQ	(1)<br>
wherein Cp is a cyclopentadienyl group; Cp' is a fluorenyl group; R" is a structural<br>
bridge imparting stereorigidity to the catalyst; M is a metal atom from Group IV(b),<br>
V(b) or Vl(b); and each Q is a hydrocarbyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms or<br>
a halogen and p is the valance of M minus 2. Cp and Cp ' may be substituted with the<br>
restriction that the substituents are selected to preserve Cs symmetry of the catalyst<br><br>
Further, the skilled person would know the preferred number of substituents and the<br>
preferred positioning of any substituent.<br>
The skilled person also will know suitable catalysts for making an isotactic<br>
polypropylene. For example, a catalyst of the general formula (2) is preferred for<br>
making an isotactic propylene:<br>
(lndH4)2R' MQz	(2)<br>
wherein each Ind is the same or different and is substituted or unsubstituted indenyl<br>
or tetrahydroindenyl; R" is a bridge which imparts stereorigidity to the catalyst; M is a<br>
Group IV metal or vanadium; and each Q independently is a hydroc arbyl having 1 to<br>
20 carbon atoms or halogen; Z is the valancy of M minus 2, and the substituents on<br>
the indenyls or tetrahydroindenyls, if present, are selected to impart C1 or C2<br>
symmetry to the catalyst component.<br>
One bulk reactor type which may be app lied in slurry polymerisation processes is a<br>
turbulent flow reactor such as a continuous pipe reactor in the form of a loop. A<br>
continuous pipe reactor in the form of a loop is operated in liquid full mode, using<br>
liquid propylene as the liquid medium. Such a so-called loop reactor is well known<br>
and is described in the Encyclopaedia of Chemical Technology, 3 rt Edition, Vol. 16<br>
page 390. This can produce LLDPE and HDPE resins in the same type of<br>
equipment.<br>
A loop reactor may be connected to one or more furt her reactors, such as another<br>
loop reactor. A loop reactor that is connected to another loop reactor may be referred<br>
to as a "double loop" reactor.<br>
Other types of bulk reactors such as stirred tank reactors may be used instead of a<br>
loop reactor, again u sing the bulk monomer as the liquid medium. A stirred tank<br><br>
reactor also may be used in combination with a loop reactor, where a first reactor that<br>
is a loop reactor is connected to a second reactor that is a stirred tank reactor.<br>
In some cases it may be advantageous for a gas phase reactor also to be<br>
incorporated. The gas phase reactor may be a second reactor that is connected to a<br>
first reactor such as a loop reactor or a stirred tank reactor. Alternatively, a gas<br>
phase reactor may be connected as a t hird reactor in the apparatus. In the gas phase<br>
reactor (if present), the elastomeric part of a copolymer or higher order polmer<br>
product may be produced. The elastomeric part of the polymer product gives impact<br>
properties to the product. The elastomeric pa rt of the polymer product typically is<br>
comonomer rich.<br>
The bulk reactor(s) may be connected to a gas phase reactor, for example where it is<br>
desirable to prepare a "block" polymer. For example, a "block" propylene -ethylene<br>
copolymer may be made by first polymerising propylene monomers in the bulk<br>
reactor. Optionally, there may be a small quantity of ethylene comonomers present.<br>
The present invention now will be described in further detail with reference to the<br>
attached drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a general scheme for the introduction of the antifouling agent into the<br>
polypropylene polymerisation reactor. Pumping is done with a metering pump.<br>
Figure 2 shows a double loop reactor that is useable in the process according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
Figure 3 represents the viscosity of synperonic experessed in cps as a function of<br>
temperature expressed in °C.<br>
The following embodiment describes apparatus that is useable in the present<br><br>
In the first reactor, the liquid propylene monomer polymerises in the presence of<br>
hydrogen, catalyst, activating agent, anti -fouling agent and optionally a comonomer.<br>
-	The first reactor essentially consists of four or more vertical jac keted pipe sections<br>
(1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e, 1f) connected by trough elbows (3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e, 3f) as shown<br>
for example in Figure 2 where there are six vertical jacketed pipe sections. There are<br>
three lower trough elbows in the reactor in Figure 2 (3b, 3d, 3f) and three upper<br>
trough elbows (3a, 3c, 3e). The slurry is maintained in circulation in the reactor by an<br>
axial pump (2). The polymerisation heat may be extracted by water cooling jackets<br>
around the vertical pipe sections (legs). The reactants, diluen t and antifouling agent<br>
conveniently are introduced into one of the lower trough elbows of the first reactor,<br>
close to the circulating pump. For example, in Figure 2, this could be in the position<br>
marked "A".<br>
-	The polypropylene product may be taken out of one or more of the lower trough<br>
elbows of the reactor, with some diluent. Typically, the product is removed from a<br>
different trough elbow to the trough elbow into which the reactants, diluent and<br>
antifouling agent are introduced. For example, in Figure 2, when the reactants,<br>
diluent and antifouling agent are introduced at position "4", the product could be<br>
removed from trough elbow 3b or 3d.<br>
The product from the first reactor then may be transferred to the second reactor. If<br>
the second reactor also is a loop reactor, the product from reactor 1, optionally further<br>
anti-fouling agent and further reactants conveniently are introduced into one of the<br>
lower trough elbows of the second reactor, close to the circulating pump. If a<br>
copolymer product is desi red, a homopolymer reaction may be carried out in the first<br>
reactor and a copolymer reaction carried our in the second reactor. Suitable<br>
apparatus for such a process is shown in Figure 20 on page 508 of the<br>
Encyclopaedia of Polymer Science and Engineering , Vol. 13,1988.<br><br>
In some embodiments it will be advantageous for the second reactor to be a gas<br>
phase reactor. Alternatively, where the second reactor is not a gas phase reactor, it<br>
may be advantageous for the apparatus to comprise a third reactor that i s connected<br>
to the second reactor that is a gas phase reactor.<br>
If the process is carried out using two reactors in series, the product of the first loop<br>
reactor collected through the slurry removal system is re -injected in the second<br>
reactor with additional diluent and monomer. If required, additional antifouling agent<br>
can also be added to the second reactor. A concentration of the slurry between the<br>
reactors can sometimes be performed, e.g. through the use of hydro -cyclone<br>
systems.<br>
A continuous discharge system can be used.<br>
Alternatively, slurry removal conveniently may be performed through settling legs and<br>
discontinuous discharge valves or slurry removal can be performed using a wash<br>
column or centrifuge apparatus.<br>
Where slurry removal is perfor med through settling legs and discontinuous discharge<br>
valves, a small fraction of the total circulating flow is withdrawn.<br>
After removal of the slurry from the reactor, the product is recovered. The product<br>
can be recovered using a variety of techniques including using a wash column.<br>
Alternatively, it may be moved to a polymer degassing section in which the solid<br>
content is increased. While being depressurised, the slurry may be degassed, e.g.<br>
during transfer through heated flash lines to a flash tank. In the flash tank, the<br>
product and diluent are separated. The degassing can be completed in a purge<br>
column.<br>
The powder product is then further additivated and processed into pellets or<br><br>
EXPERIMENTS<br>
The polymerisation of polypropylen e was carried but in a double loop reactor with a<br>
metallocene-base catalyst system. The synperonic has a very high viscosity that<br>
decreases with increasing temperature as can be seen in Figure 3 that represents<br>
the synperonic viscosity expressed in cps as a function of temperature expressed in<br>
°C. It was thus added as a solution of 19 wt% in cyclohexane in order to reduce the<br>
viscosity thereby enabling the solution to be pumped at room temperature (in the<br>
winter, it may be necessary to add a quantity of he xane of up to 10 % in order to<br>
prevent the solution from freezing). The antifouling agent was added at a throughput<br>
that resulted in a concentration of 5 ppm in the reactor. The results are summarised<br>
