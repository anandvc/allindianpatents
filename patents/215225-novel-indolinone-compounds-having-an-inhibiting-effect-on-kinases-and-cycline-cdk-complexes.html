The subsequent hydrolysis is preferably carried out in an aqueous solvent, e.g. in water, isopropanol/water, tetrahydrofuran/water or dioxane/water, in the presence of an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid or in the presence of an alkali metal base such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide at temperatures between 0 and 100Â°C, preferably at temperatures between 10 and 50Â°C.<br>
The subsequent reductive alkylation is preferably carried out in a suitable solvent such as methanol, methanol/water, methanol/water/ammonia, ethanol, ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or dimethylformamide optionally with the addition of an acid such as hydrochloric acid in the presence of catalytically activated hydrogen, e.g. hydrogen in the presence of Raney nickel, platinum or palladium/charcoal, or in the presence of a metal hydride such as sodium borohydride, lithium borohydride or lithium; aluminium hydride at temperatures between 0 and 100Â°C, preferably at temperatures between 2 0 and 80Â°C.<br>
The subsequent alkylation is carried out with an<br>
alkylating agent such as an alkyl halide or dialkyl<br>
sulphate such as methyliodide, dimethylsulphate or<br>
propylbromide preferably in a solvent such as methanol,<br>
ethanol, methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, toluene,<br>
dioxane, dimethylsulphoxide or dimethylformamide<br>
optionally in the presence of an inorganic or a tertiary <br>
organic base such as triethylamine, N-ethyl-	<br>
diisopropylamine or dimethylaminopyridine, preferably at<br><br>
temperatures between 20Â°C and the boiling temperature of the solvent used.<br>
The subsequent acylation is preferably carried out in a solvent such as methylene chloride, diethylether, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, dioxane, acetonitrile, dimethylsulphoxide or dimethylformamide, optionally in the presence of an inorganic or a tertiary organic base, preferably at temperatures between 20Â°C and the boiling temperature of the solvent used. The acylation with a corresponding acid is preferably carried out in the presence of a dehydrating agent, e.g. in the presence of isobutyl chloroformate, tetraethyl orthocarbonate, trimethyl orthoacetate, 2,2-dimethoxypropane, tetramethoxysilane, thionyl chloride,<br>
trimethylchlorosilane, phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentoxide, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, N,N'-dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxy-benzotriazole, 2-(lH-benzotriazol-1-yl)-l,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium-tetrafluoroborate, 2-(lH-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium-tetrafluoroborate/1-hydroxy-benzotriazole, N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole or triphenylphosphine/carbon tetrachloride, and optionally with the addition of a base such as pyridine, 4-dimethylamino-pyridine, N-methyl-morpholine or triethylamine, conveniently at temperatures between 0 and 150Â°C, preferably at temperatures between 0 and 100Â°C, and the acylation with a corresponding reactive compound such as an anhydride, ester, imidazolide or halide thereof is optionally carried out in the presence of a tertiary organic base such as triethylamine, N-ethyl-diisopropylamine or N-methyl-morpholine at temperatures between 0 and 150Â°c, preferably at temperatures between 50 and 100Â°C.<br>
The subsequent esterification or amidation is conveniently<br><br>
carried out by reacting a corresponding reactive carboxylic acid derivat ive with a corresponding alcohol or amine as described hereinbefore.<br>
In the reactions described hereinbefore, any reactive groups present such as carboxy, amino, alkylamino or imino groups may be protected during the reaction by conventional protecting groups which are cleaved again after the reaction.<br>
For example, a protecting group for a carboxyl group may be a trimethylsilyl, methyl, ethyl, tert.butyl, benzyl or tetrahydropyranyl group and<br>
protecting groups for an amino, alkylamino or imino group may be an acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, benzoyl, ethoxycarbonyl, tert.butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, benzyl, methoxybenzyl or 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl group and additionally, for the amino group, a phthalyl group.<br>
Any protecting group used is optionally subsequently cleaved for example by hydrolysis in an aqueous solvent, e.g. in water, isopropanol/water, acetic acid/water, tetrahydrofuran/water or dioxane/water, in the presence of an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid or in the presence of an alkali metal base such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, at temperatures between 0 and 100Â°C, preferably at temperatures between 10 and 50Â°C.<br>
However, a benzyl, methoxybenzyl or benzyloxycarbonyl group is cleaved, for example, hydrogenolytically, e.g. with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium/charcoal in a solvent such as methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, dimethylformamide,<br>
dimethylformamide/acetone or glacial acetic acid, optionally with the addition of an acid such as <br>
â i<br>
hydrochloric acid or glacial acetic acid at temperatures between 0 and 50Â°C, but preferably at ambient temperature, and at a hydrogen pressure of 1 to 7 bar, but preferably 3 to 5 bar.<br>
A methoxybenzyl group may also be cleaved in the presence of an oxidising agent such as cerium(IV)ammonium nitrate in a solvent such as methylene chloride, acetonitrile or acetonitrile/water at temperatures of between 0 and 50Â°C, but preferably at ambient temperature.<br>
A 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl group, however, is preferably cleaved in trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of anisole.<br>
A tert butyl or tert butyloxycarbonyl group is preferably cleaved by treating with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid, optionally using a solvent such as methylene chloride, dioxane, ethyl acetate or ether.<br>
A phthalyl group is preferably cleaved in the presence of hydrazine or a primary amine such as methylamine, ethylamine or n-butylamine in a solvent such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, toluene/water or dioxane at temperatures between 2 0 and 50Â°C.<br>
Moreover, chiral compounds of general formula I obtained i may be resolved into their enantiomers and/or diastereomers.<br>
Thus, for example, the compounds of general formula I obtained which occur as racemates may be separated by methods known per  se (cf. Allinger N. L. and Eliel E. L.<br>
in "Topics in Stereochemistry", Vol. 6, Wiley Interscience, 1971) into their optical antipodes and compounds of general formula I with at least 2 asymmetric carbon atoms may be resolved into their diastereomers on<br><br>
the basis of their physical-chemical differences using methods known per se,   e.g. by chromatography and/or<br>
fractional crystallisation, and, if these compounds are obtained in racemic form, they may subsequently be resolved into the enantiomers as mentioned above.<br>
The enantiomers are preferably separated by column separation on chiral phases or by recrystallisation from an optically active solvent or by reacting with an optically active substance which forms salts or derivatives such as e.g. esters or amides with the racemic compound, particularly acids and the activated derivatives or alcohols thereof, and separating the diastereomeric mixture of salts or derivatives thus obtained, e.g. on the basis of their differences in solubility, whilst the free antipodes may be released from the pure diastereomeric salts or derivatives by the action of suitable agents. Optically active acids in common use are e.g. the D- and L-forms of tartaric acid or dibenzoyltartaric acid, di-o-tolyltartaric acid, malic acid, mandelic acid, camphorsulphonic acid, glutamic acid, N-acetylglutamic acid, aspartic acid, N-acetylaspartic acid or quinic acid. An optically active alcohol may be for example (+) or (-)-menthol and an optically active acyl group in amides, for example, may be a (+)-or (-)-menthyloxycarbonyl group.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of formula I obtained may be converted into the salts thereof, particularly for pharmaceutical use into the physiologically acceptable salts with inorganic or organic acids. Acids which may be used for this purpose include for example hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, citric acid,    tartaric acid, maleic acid or methanesulphonic acid.     <br>
Moreover, if the new compounds of formula I thus obtained contain a carboxy group they may subsequently, if<br><br>
desired, be converted into the salts thereof with<br>
inorganic or organic bases, particularly for pharÂ¬<br>
maceutical use into the physiologically acceptable salts<br>
thereof. Suitable bases for this purpose include for<br>
example sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide,<br>
cyclohexylamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine and<br>
triethanolamine .	<br><br>
The compounds of general formulae I to/VII used as     starting materials are known from the literature in some cases or may be obtained by methods known from the literature or are described in the Examples.<br>
As already mentioned, the new compounds of general formula I wherein R1  represents a hydrogen atom or a prodrug group have valuable pharmacological properties, particularly inhibitory effects on various kinases and cycline/CDK-complexes, on the proliferation of cultivated human tumour cells and, when administered orally, on the growth of tumours in nude mice infected with human tumour cells.<br>
For example, the compounds listed in Table 1 Vere tested for their biological properties as follows:<br>
Test 1<br>
Inhibition of cycline/CDK enzyme, in  vitro  activity<br>
High Fiveâ¢ insect cells (BTI-TN-5B1-4) which had been infected with a high titre of recombinant baculovirus were used to produce active human cycline/CDK holoenzymes.  By using a baculovirus vector which contained two promoters (polyhedrin enhancer promoter, P10 enhancer promoter), GST-tagged cyclines (e.g. cycline Dl or cycline D3) with the corresponding His6-tagged CDK subunit (e.g. for CDK4 or CDK6) were expressed in the same cell.  The active holoenzyme was isolated by<br><br>
affinity chromatography on glutathione sepharose. Recombinant GST-tagged pRB (aa 379-928) was produced in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione sepharose.<br>
The substrates used for the kinase assays depended on the specific kinases.  Histone H1 (Sigma) was used as the substrate for cycline E/CDK2, cycline A/CDK2, cycline B/CDK1 and for v-cycline/CDK6.  GST-tagged pRB (aa 379-928) was used as substrate for cycline D1/CDK4, cycline D3/CDK4, cycline D1/CDK6 and for cycline D3/CDK6.<br>
Lysates of the insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus or recombinant kinases (obtained from the lysates by purification) were incubated together with radiolabelled ATP in the presence of a suitable substrate with various concentrations of the inhibitor in a 1% DMSO solution (dimethyl sulphoxide) for 45 minutes at 30Â°C. The substrate proteins with associated radioactivity were precipitated with 5% TCA (trichloroacetic acid) in water-repellent PVDF multi-well microtitre plates (Millipore) or with 0.5% phosphoric acid solution on Whatman P81 filters.  After the addition of scintillation liquid the radioactivity was measured in a Wallace 1450 Microbeta Liquid Scintillation Counter. For each concentration of the substance double measurements were carried out; IC50 values were calculated for the enzyme inhibition.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
