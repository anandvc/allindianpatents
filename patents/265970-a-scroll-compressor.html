SCROLL MACHINE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to scroll type machines. More<br>
particularly,' the present invention relates to scroll compressors which incorporate<br>
features that reduce the number of components, the size and the complexity of<br>
the scroll compressor.<br>
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Refrigeration and air conditioning systems generally include a<br>
compressor, a condenser, an expansion valve or its equivalent, and an<br>
evaporator. These components are coupled in sequence to define a continuous<br>
flow path. A working fluid typically called a refrigerant flows through the system .<br>
and alternates between a liquid phase and a vapor or gaseous phase.<br>
[0003] A variety of compressor types have been used in refrigeration<br>
systems, including, but not limited to, reciprocating compressors, screw<br>
compressors and rotary compressors. Rotary compressors can include both the<br>
vane type compressors, the scroll machines as well as other rotary styled<br>
compressors.<br>
[0004] Scroll machines are becoming more and more popular for the<br>
compressor of choice in both refrigeration as well as air conditioning (applications<br>
due primarily to their capability for extremely efficient operation. Scroll<br>
compressors are typically constructed using two scroll members with each scroll<br><br>
member having an end plate and a spiral wrap extending from the end plate.<br>
The spiral wraps are arranged in an opposing manner with the two spiral wraps<br>
being interfitted. The scroll members are mounted so that they may engage in<br>
relative. orbiting motion with respect to each other. During this orbiting<br>
movement, the spiral wraps define a successive series of enclosed spaces, each<br>
of which progressively decreases in size as it moves inwardly from a radially<br>
outer position at a relatively low suction pressure to a central position at a<br>
relatively high discharge pressure. The compressed gas exits from the enclosed<br>
space at the central position through a discharge passage formed through the<br>
end ptates of one of the scroll members.<br>
[0005] An electric motor or another power source is provided which<br>
operates to drive one of the scroll members via a suitable drive shaft affixed to<br>
the motor rotor. In a hermetic compressor, the bottom of the hermetic shell<br>
normally contains an oil sump for lubricating and cooling the various components<br>
of the compressor.<br>
[0006] Relative rotation between the two scroll members is typically<br>
controlled by an anti-rotation mechanism. One of the more popular anti-rotation<br>
mechanisms is an Oldham coupling, which is keyed to either the two scroll<br>
members or to one of the scroll members and a stationary component such as a<br>
bearing housing. While Oldham couplings are a popular choice, other anti-<br>
rotation mechanisms may also be utilized.<br>
[0007] Due to the increasing popularity of scroll compressors, the<br>
continued development of these compressors has been directed towards designs<br><br>
that reduce size, reduce complexity and reduce cost without adversely affecting<br>
the performance of the scroll compressor.<br>
[0008] The present invention provides the art with a scroll compressor<br>
design that provides the design objectives detailed above. All of the<br>
embodiments of the present invention incorporate an orbiting and a non-orbiting<br>
scroll member that are designed with a rapid compression scroll wrap profile.<br>
This scroll wrap profile provides the advantages of a shorter wrap, lower vane<br>
aspect ratios and a reduction in the amount of machining for the scroll members.<br>
The non-orbiting scroll member is integrated with the main bearing housing,<br>
which reduces both cost and complexity. Another feature of the present<br>
invention is that the shaft extends through the central portion of each of the <br>
scroll members and the counterweight is positioned above both of the two scroll<br>
members. This allows for the option of positioning the counterweight in closer<br>
proximity to the center of gravity of the orbiting scroll member, thus allowing for<br>
the reduction in its size. With the counterweight positioned above the two scroll<br>
members, the counterweight can also be designed to limit axial movement of the<br>
scroll members and it can also be designed to function as a rotary discharge<br>
valve.<br>
 [0009] In one design option, an Oldham coupling is used as the anti-<br>
rotation device. In another design option, the Oldham coupling is replaced with a<br>
swing link. In yet another design option, the drive shaft is supported by a bearing<br>
located above both scroll members, rather than being unsupported at its upper<br>
end as is the case in other designs. <br><br>
[0010] Further areas of applicability of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be<br>
understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating<br>
the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of<br>
illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTIONOF-THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
- [0029] The following description of the preferred embodiments is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application or uses.<br>
[0030] Referring now to the drawings in which like reference numerals<br>
designate like or corresponding parts throughout the several views, there is<br>
shown in Figure 1 a scroll compressor that incorporates the unique design<br>
features of the present invention and which is designated generally by the<br>
reference numeral 10.<br>
[0031] Scroll compressor 10 comprises a general cylindrical hermetic<br>
shell 12 having welded at the upper end thereof a caps 14 and at the lower end<br>
thereof a base 16 having a plurality of mounting feet (not shown) integrally<br>
formed therewith. Cap 14 is provided with a refrigerant discharge fitting 18,<br>
which may have the usual discharge valve therein (not shown). Other major<br>
elements affixed to shell 12 include an inlet fitting 22, a main bearing housing 24<br>
that is suitably secured to shell 12, and a motor stator 28. Motor stator 28 is<br>
generally square in cross-section, but with the corners rounded off to allow for<br><br>
the press fitting of motor stator 28 within shell 12. The flats.between the rounded<br>
corners on motor stator 28 provide passageways between motor stator 28 and<br>
shell 12, which facilitate the return flow of the lubricant from the top of shell 12 to<br>
its bottom.<br>
[0032] A drive shaft or crankshaft 30 having an eccentric crank pin 32<br>
at the upper end thereof is rotatably journaled in a bearing 34 in main bearing<br>
housing 24. Crankshaft 30 has at the lower end thereof a tubular extension 36<br>
that communicates with a radially inclined and outwardly located bore 38<br>
extending upwardly therefrom to the top of crank pin 32. The lower portion of the<br>
interior of shell 12 forms an oil sump 40 that, is filled with lubricating oil. Tubular<br>
extension 36 extends into oil sump 40 and tubular extension 36, in conjunction<br>
with bore 38, acts as a pump to pump the lubricating oil up crankshaft 30 and<br>
ultimately to all of the various portions of compressor 10 that require lubricating.<br>
[0033] Crankshaft 30 is driven by an electric motor that includes motor<br>
stator 28 having windings 42 passing therethrough and a motor rotor 44 press<br>
fitted onto crankshaft 30. A lower counterweight 46 is attached to motor rotor 44<br>
and an upper counterweight 48 is attached to the upper-end of crankshaft 30. A<br>
motor protector 50 of the usual type is provided in close proximity to motor<br>
windings 42 so that if motor windings 42 exceed their normal operating<br>
temperature, motor protector 50 will de-energize the motor.<br>
[0034] Crankshaft 30 extends through the central portion 61 an orbiting<br>
scroll member 56. Orbiting scroll member 56 comprises an end plate 58 having<br>
a spiral vane or wrap 60 that is designed with a rapid compression profile as<br><br>
described below. Projecting downwardly from end plate 58 is a cylindrical hub 62<br>
having a journal bearing 64 therein and in which is drivingly disposed crank pin<br>
32.<br>
[0035] Orbiting scroll wrap 60 meshes with a non-orbiting scroll wrap<br>
66 forming part of a non-orbiting scroll member 68, which is integral with main<br>
bearing housing 24. During orbiting movement of orbiting scroll member 56 with<br>
respect to non-orbiting scroll member68-, moving pockets of fluid are formed and<br>
the fluid is compressed in the fluid pockets as the volume of the fluid pockets<br>
reduce as they travel from a radially outer position to a central position of scroll<br>
members 56 and 68.<br>
{0036] Orbiting"'scroll member"56 has"a radially'inwardly disposed<br>
discharge port 70, which is in fluid communication with a discharge chamber 72<br>
defined by cap 14 and shell 12. Fluid compressed by the moving pockets<br>
between scroll wraps 60 and 66 discharges into discharge chamber 72 through<br>
discharge port 70.<br>
[0037] Upper counterweight 48 rotates at a position immediately<br>
adjacent end plate 58 of orbiting scroll member 56. During the rotation of upper<br>
counterweight 48, discharge port 70 is cyclically covered and uncovered by<br>
upper counterweight 48, which allows upper counterweight 48 to act as a rotary<br>
discharge valve for compressor 10.<br>
[0038] Relative rotation of scroll member 56 and 68 is prevented by an<br>
Oldham coupling 80 having a first pair of keys slidably disposed in diametrically<br><br>
opposing slots in non-orbiting scroll member 68 and a- second pair of keys<br>
slidably disposed in diametrically opposing slots in orbiting scroll member 56.<br>
[0039] As described above, scroll wraps 60 and 66 define a rapid<br>
compression scroll profile. The rapid compression scroll profile provides the<br>
advantages'of a shorteTwrap7lbw^lo3l'^pe"ct'ratibs,'l6wer vane aspect ratios,<br>
. there is no need to machine the back side of end plate 58 other than the race for<br>
upper "counterweight 48, and it allows orbiting scroll member 56 to be<br>
manufactured using a powder medal process. The preferred profile for scroll<br>
'wraps 60"a'n'd 66 is givenin the" following table "Where Ri is'the initial swing radius<br>
bias and RG is the generating radius bias:<br><br>
[0040] As illustrated in the Figures, main bearing housing 24 and non-<br>
orbiting scroll member 68 are an integral component. Preferably, this component<br>
is machined from an iron casting and the advantages of having an integral non-<br>
orbiting scroll member 68 and main bearing housing 24 include that the bearing<br>
bore can be used as a fixture for the machining of non-orbiting scroll wrap 66. By<br>
using the bearing bore as a fixture for machining the scroll wrap, the stack-up of<br>
tolerances are minimized, the radial compliance is minimized or reduced, and the<br>
bearing/gas/flank/axial forces are linked within a single component.<br><br>
[0041] Compressor 10 is preferably a "high side" type, in which the<br>
volume defined by shell 12, cap 14 and base 16 is at discharge pressure. In this<br>
way, discharge fitting 18 can be conveniently located on shell 12 or cap 14. Inlet<br>
fitting 22 sealingly engages and extends through shell 12 and is seatingly<br>
received within non-orbiting scroll member 68 to provide gas at suction pressure<br>
to compressor 10.<br>
[0042] Referring now to Figure 5, a scroll compressor in accordance<br>
with another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated and is designed<br>
generally by the reference numeral 110.<br>
[0043] Scroll compressor 110 comprises a general cylindrical hermetic<br>
shell 112 having welded at the upper end thereof a cap 114 and at the lower end<br>
thereof a base 116 having a plurality of mounting feet (not shown) integrally<br>
formed therewith. Cap 114 is provided with a refrigerant discharge fitting 118,<br>
which may have the usualdischarge valve therein (not shown). Other major<br>
elements affixed to shell 112 include an inlet fitting 122, a main bearing housing<br>
124 that is suitably secured to shell 112, and a motor stator 128. Motor stator<br>
128 is generally square in cross-section, but with the corners rounded off to allow<br>
for the press fitting of motor stator 128 within shell 112. The flats between the<br>
rounded corners on motor stator 128 provide passageways between motor stator<br>
128 and shell 112, which facilitate the return flow of the lubricant from the top of<br>
shell 112 to its bottom.<br>
[0044] A drive shaft or crankshaft 130 having an eccentric crank pin<br>
132 at the upper end thereof is rotatably journaled in a bearing 134 in main<br><br>
bearing housing 124. Crankshaft 130 has at the lower end thereof a tubular<br>
extension 136 that communicates with a radially inclined and outwardly located<br>
bore 138 extending upwardly therefrom to the top of crank pin 132. The lower<br>
portion of the interior of shell 112 forms an oil sump 140 that is filled with<br>
"lubricating"oil. "Tubular extension 136 extends into oil sump 140 and tubular<br>
extension 136, in conjunction with bore 138, acts as a pump to pump the<br>
lubricating oil up crankshaft 130 and ultimately to all of the various portions of<br>
compressor 110 that require lubricating.<br>
[0045] Crankshaft 130 is driven by an electric motor that includes<br>
motor stator 128 having windings 142 passing therethrough and a motor rotor<br>
144 press fitted onto crankshaft 1307~A lower counterweight 146 is attached to<br>
motor rotor 144 and an upper counterweight 148 is attached to the upper-end of<br>
crankshaft 130. A motor protector 150 of the usual type is provided in close<br>
proximity to motor windings 142 so that if motor windings 142 exceed their<br>
normal operating temperature, motor protector 150 will de-energize the motor.<br>
[0046] Crankshaft 130 extends through the central portion of an<br>
orbiting scroll member 156. Orbiting scroll member 156 comprises an end plate<br>
158 having a spiral vane or wrap 160 that is designed with a rapid compression<br>
profile as described below. Projecting downwardly from end plate 158 is a<br>
cylindrical hub 162 having a journal bearing 164 therein and in which is drivingly<br>
disposed crank pin 132.	i<br>
[0047] Orbiting scroll wrap 160 meshes with a non-orbiting scroll wrap<br>
166 forming part of a non-orbiting scroll member 168, which is integral with main<br><br>
bearing housing 124. During orbiting movement of orbiting scroll member 156<br>
with respect to non-orbiting scroll member 168, moving pockets of fluid are<br>
formed and the fluid is compressed in the fluid pockets as the volume of the fluid<br>
pockets reduce as they travel from a radially outer position to a central position of<br>
scroll members 156 and 168.<br>
[0048] Orbiting scroll member 156'has a radially inwardly disposed<br>
discharge port 170, which is in fluid communication with a discharge chamber<br>
172 defined by cap 114 and shell 112. Fluid compressed by the moving pockets<br>
between scroll wraps 160 and 166 discharges into discharge chamber 172<br>
through discharge port 170.<br>
[0049] Upper counterweight 148 rotates at a position immediately<br>
adjacent end plate 158 of orbiting scroll member 156. During the rotation of<br>
upper counterweight 148, discharge port 170 is cyclically covered and uncovered<br>
by upper counterweight 148, which allows upper counterweight 148 to act as a<br>
rotary discharge valve for compressor 110.<br>
[0050] Relative rotation of scroll members 156 and 168 is prevented by<br>
a swing link 178. Swing link 178 comprises a generally U-shaped extension 180,<br>
which is attached to or is integral with end plate 158 of orbiting scroll member<br>
156. U-shaped extension 180 engages a generally rectangular bearing 182,<br>
which is pivotably disposed on a post 184 extending from non-orbiting scroll<br>
member 168. The engagement between U-shaped extension 180 and bearing<br>
182, in conjunction with the engagement between bearing 182 and post 184,<br>
prohibits the rotational movement of orbiting scroll member 156 with respect to<br><br>
non-orbiting scroll member 168, but allows the necessary orbiting movement of<br>
orbiting scroll member 156 with respect to non-orbiting scroll member 168 such<br>
that the moving pockets are formed and made to move radially inward during the<br>
rotation of crankshaft 130.<br>
[0051] As described "above; "scroll "Wraps" 160 and 166 also define a<br>
rapid compression scroll profile. The rapid compression scroll profile provides<br>
the advantages of a shorter wrap, lowertool aspect ratios, lower vane aspect<br>
ratios, there is no need to machine the back side of end plate 158 other than the<br>
race for upper counterweight 148, and it allows orbiting scroll member 156 to be<br>
manufactured using a powder medal process. The preferred profile for scroll<br>
wraps 160 ah'd' 166 is" given in the following tablewhere Ri is the initial swing<br>
radius bias and RG is the generating radius bias:<br><br>
. [0052] As illustrated in the Figures, main bearing housing 124 and non-<br>
orbiting scroll member 168 are an integral component. Preferably, this<br>
component is machined from an iron casting and the advantages of having an<br>
integral non-orbiting scroll member 168 and main bearing housing 124 include<br>
that the bearing bore can be used as a fixture for the machining of non-orbiting<br>
scroll wrap 166. By using the bearing bore as a fixture for machining the scroll<br><br>
wrap, the stack-up of tolerances are minimized, the radial compliance is<br>
minimized or reduced, and the bearing/gas/flank/axial forces are linked within a<br>
single component.<br>

member 68', except that main bearing housing 24' and non-orbiting scroll<br>
member 68' include an upper bearing housing 90. Upper bearing housing 90<br>
includes a plurality of supporting posts 92 and a bearing support 94. Supporting<br>
posts 92 are integral with main bearing housing 24' and non-orbiting scroll<br>
member 68', or they can be a separate component attached by methods known<br>
well in the art. Bearing support 94 is attached to the plurality of supporting posts<br>
92 using a plurality of bolts or by other means known well in the art. The plurality<br><br>
of supporting posts 92 are spaced along the outer periphery of main bearing<br>
housing 24' and non-orbiting scroll member 68'^ such that they do not interfere<br>
with upper counterweight 48. Bearing support 94 positions an upperbearing 96<br>
within which crankshaft 30 is rotatably disposed. Thus, crankshaft 30 is<br>
supported by bearing 34 located within main bearing housing 24' and by upper<br>
bearing 96 located within bearing support 94. The design, function, operation,<br>
and advantages associated with compressor 10 are also associated with<br>
compressor 10', including, but not limited to, the ability to use Oldham coupling -<br>

[0055] Referring now to Figures 9-11, a scroll compressor that<br>
incorporates the unique design features in accordance with another embodiment<br>
of the present invention is illustrated and it is designated generally by reference<br>
numeral 210.<br>
[0056] Scroll compressor 210 comprises a general cylindrical hermetic<br>
shell 212 having welded at the upper end thereof a cap 214 and at the lower end<br>
thereof a base 216 having a plurality of mounting feet (not shown) integrally<br>
formed therewith. Cap 214 is provided with a refrigerant discharge fitting 218,<br>
which'may have the usual discharge valve therein (not shown). Other major<br>
elements affixed to shell 212 or cap 214 include an upper bearing housing 220,<br>
an inlet fitting 222, a main bearing housing 224 that is suitably secured to shell<br>
212, and a motor stator 226. Motor stator 226 is generally square in cross-<br>
section, but with the corners rounded off to allow for the press fitting of motor<br><br>
stator 226 within shell 212. The flats between the rounded corners on motor<br>
stator 226 provide passageways between motor stator 226 and shell 212, which<br>
facilitate the return flow of the lubricant from the top of shell 212 to its bottom.<br>

232 aTthe upper end thereof is "rotatablyjoumaled in" "a~beaTing 234 in main<br>
bearing housing 224 and. in a bearing 235 in upper bearing housing 220.<br>
Crankshaft-230 has at-the-lower end thereof-a tubular extension 236 that<br>
communicates with a radially included and outwardly located bore 238 extending<br>
upwardly therefrom to the top of crank pin 232. The lower portion of the interior<br>
of shell 212 forms an oil sump 240 that is filled with lubricating oil. Tubular<br>

that require lubricating.<br>
[0058] Crankshaft 230 is driven by an electric motor that includes<br>
motor stator 226 having windings 242 passing therethrough and a motor rotor<br>
244 press fitted onto crankshaft 230. A lower counterweight 246 is attached to<br>
motor rotor 244 and an upper counterweight 248 is attached to the upper-end of<br>
motor rotor 244. A motor protector 250 of the usual type is provided in close<br>
proximity to motor windings 242 so that if motor windings 242 exceed their<br>
normal operating temperature, motor protector 250 will de-energize trie motor.<br>
[0059] Crankshaft 230 extends through the central portion of an<br>
orbiting scroll member 256. Orbiting scroll member 256 comprises an end plate<br><br>
2.58 having a spiral vane or wrap 260 that is designed with a rapid compression'<br>
profile as described above. Projecting downwardly from end plate 258 is a<br>

[0061] Orbiting scroll member 256 has a radially inwardly disposed<br>
discharge slot 270, which is in fluid communication with a discharge port 272 that<br>
extends through non-orbiting scroll member 268, which is in communication with<br>
a discharge chamber 274 defined by cap 214 and shell 212. Fluid compressed<br>
by the moving pockets between scroll wraps 260 and 266 discharges into<br>
discharge chamber 274 through discharge slot 270 and discharge port 272.<br>
[0062] Relative rotation of scroll members 256 and 268 is prevented by<br>
the usual Oldham coupling 288 having a first pair of keys slidably disposed in<br>
diametrically opposing slots in non-orbiting scroll member 268 and a second pair<br>
of keys slidably disposed in diametrically opposing slots in orbiting scroll member<br>
256, as illustrated in Figure 9. While Figure 9 illustrates Oldham coupling 288 as<br>
the mechanism for preventing relative rotation of scroll members 256 and 268, it<br><br>
is within the scope of the present invention to replace Oldham coupling 288 with<br>
swing link 78 described above if desired.<br>
[0063] As described above, scroll wraps 260 and 266 define a rapid<br>
compression scroll profile. The rapid compression scroll profile provides the<br>
advantages of a shorter wrap, lower tool aspect ratios, lower vane aspect ratios,<br>
and it allows orbiting scroll member 256 to be manufactured using a powder<br>
medal process. The preferred profile for scroll wraps 260 and 266 is given in the<br>
previous table that describes wraps 60 and 66.<br>
[0064] As illustrated in the Figures, main bearing housing 224 and non-<br>
orbiting scroll member 268 are an integral component. Preferably, this<br>
component is machined from an iron casting and the advantages of having an<br>
integral non-orbiting scroll member 268 and main bearing housing 224 include<br>
that the bearing bore can be used as a fixture for the machining of non-orbiting<br>
scroll wrap 266. By using the bearing bore as a fixture for machining the scroll<br>
wrap, the stack-up of tolerances are minimized, the radial compliance is<br>
minimized or reduced, and the bearing/gas/flank/axial forces are linked within a<br>
single component.<br>
[0065] Compressor 210 is preferably a "high side" type, in which the<br>
volume defined by shell 212, cap 214 and base 216 is at discharge pressure. In<br>
this way, discharge fitting 218 can be conveniently located on shell 212 or cap<br>
214. Inlet fitting 222 sealingly engages-and extends through shell 212 and is<br>
sealingly received within non-orbiting scroll member 268 to provide gas at suction<br>
pressure to compressor 210.<br><br>
[0066] Referring now to Figure 10, discharge slot 270 of orbiting scroll<br>
member 256 is illustrated. Discharge slot 270 extends through cylindrical hub<br>
262 and journal bearing 264, which is press fit into cylindrical hub 262.<br>
- [0067] Referring now to-Figure-11 .-discharge port 272 of non-orbiting<br>
scroll member 268 is illustrated. Discharge port 272 includes a formed recess<br>
278, which is in communication with an angular bore 280, which is in<br>
communication with discharge chamber 274. During the orbiting movement of<br>
orbiting scroll member 256, orbiting scroll wrap 260 opens and closes discharge<br>
. slot 270 and discharge port 272 to allow the compressed gas to move from the<br>
inner most moving pocket to discharge chamber 274.<br>
[0068] Referring now to "Figure" 12,~"" a "scroll compressor that<br>

by the moving pockets between scroll wraps 360 and 366 discharges into<br>
discharge chamber 374 through discharge slot 370 and discharge port 372.<br>
Discharge slot 370 is a generally axially disposed slot and discharge port 372 is<br>
an inclined bore that is in communication wfth discharge chamber 374.<br>
[0075] Relative rotation of scroll members 356 and 368 is prevented by<br>
the usual Oldham coupling 388 having a first pair of keys slidably disposed in<br>
diametrically opposing slots in non-orbiting scroll member 368 and a second pair<br>
of keys slidably disposed in diametrically opposing slots in orbiting scroll member<br><br>
356, as illustrated in Figure 12. While Figure 12 illustrated Oldham coupling 388<br>
as the mechanism for preventing relative rotation of scroll members 356 and 368,<br>
it is within the scope of the present invention to replace Oldham coupling 388<br>
with swing link 178 described above if desired.<br>
[0076] As described -above-;-scroll-wraps —360 and 366 define a rapid<br>
compression scroll profile. The rapid compression scroll profile provides the<br>

incorporated into compressor 310. Rotary discharge valve 378 is driven by<br>
crankshaft 330 by a formed recess 380, which engages crank pin 332 on its<br>
upper side. The lower side of rotary discharge valve 378 includes a port closing<br>
section 382, a communication relief section 384 and a port open section 386. As<br>
crankshaft 330 rotates, discharge slot 370 is closed when port closing section<br>
382 is above axially disposed slot 370, gas is allowed to flow to discharge port<br>
372 when communication relief section 384 is above axially disposed slot 370,<br>

between scroll wraps 560 and 566 discharges into discharge chamber 572<br>
through discharge port 570.<br>
[0098] Discharge port 570 (illustrated in greater detail on Fig. 17) is<br>
machined into the baseplate of non-orbiting scroll member 566 and enables the<br>
discharge gas to escape the compression cavity into discharge chamber 572.<br>
The shape of this port determines the relative position, of non-orbiting scroll wrap<br>
566 and orbiting scroll wrap 560, at which a pocket under compression starts to<br>
communicate with discharge port 570 and can be determined, by those skilled in<br>
the art, to minimize compression loses at a specified operational condition.<br>
Through passages 574, the discharge gas moves to the upper portion of cap 514<br>
and leaves compressor 510 through discharge fitting 518.<br>
[0099] Relative rotation of scroll member 556 and 568 is prevented by<br>
an Oldham coupling 580 having a first pair of keys slidably disposed in<br><br>
diametrically opposing slots in non-orbiting scroll member 568 and a second pair<br>
of keys slidably disposed in diametrically opposing slots in orbiting scroll member<br>
556.<br>
[00100] As described above, scroll wraps 560 and 566-define a rapid<br>
compression "scroll profile." The "rapid compression scroll profile provides the<br>
.advantages of a shorter wrap, lower tool aspect ratios, lower vane aspect ratios,<br>
there-is no need to machine the back side of end plate 558 other than the race<br>
for upper counterweight 548, and it allows orbiting scroll member 556 to be<br>
manufactured using a powder medal process. " The preferred profile for scroll<br>
wraps 560 and 566 is given in the following table where Ri is the initial swing<br>
"radius bias'and RG is the generating fadiirs bias:<br><br>
[00101] As illustrated in the Figures, main bearing housing 524 and non-<br>
orbiting scroll member 568 are an integral component. Preferably, this<br>
component is machined from an iron casting and the advantages of having an<br>
integral non-orbiting scroll member 568 and main bearing housing .524 include<br>
that the bearing bore can be used as a fixture for the machining of non-orbiting<br>
scroll wrap 566. By using the bearing bore as a fixture for machining the scroll<br>
wrap, the stack-up of tolerances are minimized, the radial compliance is<br><br>
minimized or reduced, and the bearing/gas/flank/axial forces are linked within a<br>
single component.<br>
[00102] Compressor 510 is preferably a "high side" type, in which the<br>
•volume defined by shell 512, cap 514 and base 516 is at discharge pressure. In<br>
this way, discharge fitting 518 can be conveniently located on shell 512 or cap<br>
514. Inlet fitting 522 sealingly engages and extends through shell 512 and is<br>
sealingly received within non-orbiting scroll member 568 to provide gas at suction<br>
pressure to compressor 510.<br>
[00103] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and, thus, variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended<br>
to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as<br>
a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
