				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
DEVELOPER CARRYING DEVICE, DEVELOPING DEVICE,<br>
PROCESS UNIT, AND IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a developer carrying<br>
device for use in an image forming apparatus.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A developer carrying device is used in an image<br>
forming apparatus. The developer carrying device carries a<br>
developer containing a toner and a magnetic carrier. The<br>
developer carrying device includes an agitating and<br>
carrying member that carries the developer in an axial<br>
direction while agitating the developer according to the<br>
rotation of the agitating and carrying member. The<br>
developer carrying device also includes a toner-<br>
concentration detecting unit that detects a toner<br>
concentration of the developer carried by the agitating and<br>
carrying member.<br>
The agitating and conveying member, which is generally<br>
a screw member, carries the developer to an area opposed to<br>
a latent image bearing member according to the surface<br>
movement of a developer bearing member, which is generally<br>
a sleeve, while bearing the developer on the surface of the<br>
developer bearing member. The developing device transfers<br>
the toner in the developer onto a latent image on the<br>
latent image bearing member to develop the latent image and<br>
obtain a toner image. The developer that has contributed<br>
to the development is returned onto the agitating and<br>
conveying member in the developing device according to the<br>
movement of the developer bearing member. The toner<br><br>
concentration of the developer is detected by the toner-<br>
concentration detecting unit while the developer is carried<br>
by the agitating and carrying member. The developer is<br>
replenished with an appropriate amount of the toner based<br>
on a result of the detection and supplied to the developer<br>
carrying member again.<br>
Sometimes the volume of the toner in the developer<br>
changes due to environmental fluctuation or fluctuation in<br>
an amount of electric charge on the toner. In this<br>
situation, although the toner concentration has not changed,<br>
the conventional toner-concentration detecting unit<br>
erroneously detects a change in the concentration of the<br>
toner. Such misdetection can be prevented by pressing the<br>
developer strongly in a position of detection by the toner-<br>
concentration detecting unit to adjust the amount of the<br>
toner that affects the toner concentration. For example,<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 6-308833<br>
discloses (see Fig. 10) a graph indicating that a result of<br>
detection by a permeability sensor as a toner-concentration<br>
detecting unit can be fixed regardless of an amount of<br>
charge of a toner by pressing a developer with a force<br>
equal to or larger than 30 [g/cm2] (9.8x300N/cm2) .<br>

BEST MODE(S) FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The inventors found through experiments that, in<br>
actual use, the permeability sensor does not always show an<br>
output characteristic indicated by the graph shown in Fig.<br>
10 of Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 6-308833.<br>
Specifically, the developer disclosed in Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open No. 6-308833 carries the developer in<br>
a rotation axis direction according to the rotation of a<br>
screw member as an agitating and carrying member disposed<br>
in a developer carrying unit. The toner-concentration<br>
detecting unit fixed to a lower wall of the developer<br>
carrying unit detects a toner concentration of the<br>
developer being carried. Surface roughening is applied to<br>
an inner wall of the developer carrying unit further on a<br>
downstream side in a developer carrying direction than a<br>
position for toner concentration detection by the toner-<br>
concentration detecting unit. Carrying speed of the<br>
developer is reduced in a section of the surface roughening<br>
to press the developer in the toner concentration detection<br>
position, which is further on an upstream side in the<br>
developer carrying direction than the surface roughening<br>
section, in the developer carrying direction. However,<br>
according to the experiments by the inventors, in such a<br>
developing device, a pressing force in the developer<br>
carrying direction applied to the developer and a result of<br>
detection by the toner concentration sensor including the<br>
permeability sensor did not show a satisfactory correlation.<br>
Therefore, the inventors carries out further<br>
experiments and found that a satisfactory correlation was<br>
not obtained between the pressing force in the developer<br><br>
carrying direction applied to the developer and the result<br>
of detection by the toner concentration sensor because of<br>
the following reasons. A certain degree of clearance is<br>
provided between a wall of the developer carrying unit<br>
including the screw member and a spiral blade of the screw<br>
member. The toner concentration sensor fixed to the wall<br>
of the developer carrying unit has a relatively small<br>
detectable distance range. Thus, the toner concentration<br>
sensor cannot detect a toner concentration of the developer<br>
in the spiral blade in a relatively distant position. The<br>
toner concentration sensor can detect only a toner<br>
concentration of the developer in the clearance near the<br>
sensor. Therefore, the developer in the clearance has to<br>
be sufficiently pressed. However, a pressing force in a<br>
rotation axis direction (a conveying direction) following<br>
the rotation of the screw member mainly acts on the<br>
developer stored in the spiral blade of the screw member.<br>
Even if the developer in the spiral blade is sufficiently<br>
pressed, the developer in the clearance further on the<br>
outer side than the spiral blade may not be sufficiently<br>
pressed. Consequently, a satisfactory correlation is not<br>
obtained between the pressing force in the developer<br>
carrying direction applied to the developer and the result<br>
of detection by the toner concentration sensor.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are<br>
explained in detail below with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of a copying machine<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
copying machine includes a printer unit 1 that forms an<br>
image on a recording sheet P, a sheet feeding device 200<br>
that feeds the recording sheet P to the printer unit 1, a<br>
scanner 300 that scans an original image, and an original<br><br>
automatic document feeder (hereinafter, "ADF") 400 that<br>
automatically feeds an original (document) to the scanner<br>
300.<br>
In the scanner 300, according to the reciprocating<br>
movement of a first traveling member 303 mounted with a<br>
light source for original illumination, a mirror, and the<br>
like and a second traveling member 304 mounted with a<br>
plurality of reflection mirrors, scanning of an original<br>
(not shown) placed on a contact glass 301 is performed.<br>
Scanning light irradiated from the second traveling member<br>
304 is condensed by a focusing lens 305 on a focusing<br>
surface of a reading sensor 306 set behind the focusing<br>
lens 305. The scanning light is then read as image signal<br>
by the reading sensor 306.<br>
On a side of a housing of the printer unit 1, a manual<br>
feed tray 2 on which the recording sheet P fed into the<br>
housing is manually placed and a sheet discharge tray 3 on<br>
which the recording sheet P after image formation<br>
discharged from the housing is stacked are provided.<br>
Fig. 2 is a partial enlarged diagram of a part of an<br>
internal structure of the printer unit 1. A transfer unit<br>
50 in which an endless intermediate transfer belt 51 as a<br>
transfer member is stretched by a plurality of stretching<br>
rollers is disposed in the housing of the printer unit 1.<br>
The intermediate transfer belt 51 is made of a material<br>
formed by dispersing carbon powder for adjusting electric<br>
resistance in less stretchable polyimide resin. The<br>
intermediate transfer belt 51 is endlessly rotated in a<br>
clockwise direction in the figure by the rotation of a<br>
driving roller 52, which is driven to rotate in the<br>
clockwise direction in the figure by a not-shown driving<br>
unit, while being stretched by the driving roller 52, a<br>
secondary transfer backup roller 53, a driven roller 54,<br><br>
and four primary transfer rollers 55Y, 55C, 55M, and 55K.<br>
The subscripts Y, C, M, and Y affixed to the ends of the<br>
signs of the primary transfer rollers indicate that the<br>
primary transfer rollers are members for yellow, cyan,<br>
magenta, and black. The same holds true for subscripts Y,<br>
C, M, and Y affixed to the ends of signs in the following<br>
explanation.<br>
The intermediate transfer belt 51 is stretched in a<br>
posture of a reverse triangular shape with a bottom side<br>
thereof faced upward in the vertical direction because the<br>
intermediate transfer belt 51 is substantially curved in<br>
sections where the intermediate transfer belt 51 is laid<br>
over the driving roller 52, the secondary transfer backup<br>
roller 53, and the driven roller 54. A belt upper stretch<br>
surface equivalent to the bottom side of the reverse<br>
triangular shape extends in the horizontal direction.<br>
Above such a belt upper stretch surface, four process units<br>
10Y, 10C, 10M, and 10K are disposed side by side in the<br>
horizontal direction along the extending direction of the<br>
upper stretch surface.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, an optical writing unit 60 is<br>
disposed above the four process units 10Y, 10C, 10M, and<br>
10K. The optical writing unit 60 drives, based on image<br>
information of an original scanned by the scanner 300, four<br>
semiconductor lasers (not shown) using a not-shown laser<br>
control unit and emits four writing lights L. The optical<br>
writing unit 60 scans drum-like photosensitive members 11Y,<br>
11C, 11M, and UK as latent image bearing members of the<br>
process units 10Y, 10C, 10M, and 10K using the writing<br>
lights L, respectively, in the dark and writes<br>
electrostatic latent images for Y, C, M, and K on the<br>
surfaces of the photosensitive members 11Y, 11C, 11M, and<br>
11K.<br><br>
The optical writing unit 60 is an optical writing unit<br>
that performs optical scanning by reflecting a laser beam<br>
emitted from a semiconductor laser on a not-shown<br>
reflection mirror or transmitting the laser beam through an<br>
optical lens while deflecting the laser beam with a not-<br>
shown polygon mirror. Instead of such an optical writing<br>
unit, an optical writing unit that performs optical<br>
scanning with an LED array can be used.<br>
Fig. 3 is an enlarged diagram of the process units 10Y<br>
and 10C and the intermediate transfer belt 51. The process<br>
unit 10Y includes, around the drum-like photosensitive<br>
member 11Y, a charging member 12Y, a charge removing device<br>
13Y, a drum cleaning device 14Y, a developing device 20Y,<br>
and a Y-potential sensor 49Y. The process unit 10Y and<br>
these devices are detachably attachable to the printer unit<br>
integrally as one unit with the devices held by a casing as<br>
a common holding member.<br>
The charging member 12Y is a roller-like member<br>
rotatably supported by a not-shown bearing while coming<br>
into contact with the photosensitive member 11Y. The<br>
charging member 12Y rotates in contact with the<br>
photosensitive member 11Y while being applied with a<br>
charging bias by a not-shown bias supplying unit to<br>
uniformly charge the surface of the photosensitive member<br>
11Y in, for example, a polarity same as a charging polarity<br>
of a Y toner. A scorotron charger or the like that applies<br>
uniform charging processing to the photosensitive member<br>
11Y in a non-contact manner can be adopted instead of such<br>
a charging member 12Y.<br>
The developing device 20Y includes a casing 21Y, a<br>
developer carrying device 22Y, and a developing unit 23Y.<br>
The casing 21Y is filled with a Y developer. The Y<br>
developer is a mixture of a magnetic carrier and a<br><br>
nonmagnetic Y toner. In the developing unit 23Y, a<br>
developing sleeve 24Y as a developer carrying member, which<br>
is driven to rotate by a not-shown driving unit to<br>
endlessly move the surface thereof, exposes a part of a<br>
peripheral surface thereof to the outside from an opening<br>
provided in the casing 21Y. Consequently, a development<br>
area in which the photosensitive member 11 and the<br>
developing sleeve 24Y are opposed to each other via a<br>
predetermined gap is formed.<br>
In the inside of the developing sleeve 24Y made of a<br>
nonmagnetic member of a hollow pipe shape, a magnet roller<br>
(not-shown) including a plurality of magnetic poles<br>
arranged in the peripheral direction is fixed to not rotate<br>
following the developing sleeve 24Y. The developing sleeve<br>
24Y is driven to rotate while attracting the Y developer in<br>
a developer carrying device 22 described later to the<br>
surface thereof with a magnetic force generated by the<br>
magnet roller. In this way, the developing sleeve 24Y<br>
draws up the Y developer from the developer carrying device<br>
22Y. The Y developer carried to the development area<br>
according to the rotation of the developing sleeve 24Y<br>
enters a doctor gap of 0.9 [mm] formed between a doctor<br>
blade 25Y, the tip of which is opposed to the surface of<br>
the developing sleeve 24Y via a predetermined gap, and the<br>
sleeve surface. A layer thickness on the sleeve is<br>
regulated to be equal to or smaller than 0.9 [mm]. When<br>
the Y developer is carried to near the development area<br>
opposed to the photosensitive member 11Y according to the<br>
rotation of the developing sleeve 24Y, the Y developer is<br>
subjected to a magnetic force of a not-shown developing<br>
magnetic pole of the magnet roller and stands like the ears<br>
of rice on the sleeve to become a magnetic brush.<br>
For example, a developing bias having a polarity same<br><br>
as a charging polarity of a toner is applied to the<br>
developing sleeve 24Y by the not-shown bias supplying unit.<br>
Consequently, in the development area, between the surface<br>
of the developing sleeve 24Y and a non-image section (a<br>
uniformly charged section, i.e., a background section) of<br>
the photosensitive member 11Y, a no-development potential<br>
for electrostatically moving the Y toner from the non-image<br>
section side to the sleeve side acts. Between the surface<br>
of the developing sleeve 24Y and the electrostatic latent<br>
image on the photosensitive member 11Y, a development<br>
potential for electrostatically moving the Y toner from the<br>
sleeve side to the electrostatic latent image acts. When<br>
the Y toner in the Y developer is transferred to the<br>
electrostatic latent image by the action of the development<br>
potential, the electrostatic latent image on the<br>
photosensitive member 11Y is developed by the Y toner.<br>
The Y developer that has passed the development area<br>
according to the rotation of the developing sleeve 24Y is<br>
affected by a repulsion magnetic field formed by repulsion<br>
magnetic poles included in the not-shown magnet roller and<br>
is removed from the developing sleeve 24Y to return to the<br>
inside of the developer carrying device 22.<br>
The developer carrying device 22Y includes a first<br>
screw member 26Y, a second screw member 32Y, a partition<br>
wall interposed between the first and second screw members,<br>
and a toner concentration sensor 45Y including a<br>
permeability sensor. The partition wall partitions a first<br>
carrying chamber as a developer carrying unit in which the<br>
first screw member 26Y is housed and a second carrying<br>
chamber as a developer carrying unit in which the second<br>
screw member 32Y is housed. In areas opposed to both the<br>
ends in axial directions of both the screw members 26Y and<br>
32Y, both the carrying chambers communicate with each other<br><br>
through not-shown openings, respectively.<br>
The first screw member 26Y and the second screw member<br>
32Y as agitating and carrying members have rod-like<br>
rotation shaft members, both the ends of which are<br>
rotatably supported by not-shown bearings, respectively,<br>
and spiral blades protrudingly provided on peripheral<br>
surfaces of the rotation shaft members. When the first<br>
screw member 26Y and the second screw member 32Y are driven<br>
to rotate by a not-shown driving unit, the first screw<br>
member 26Y and the second screw member 32Y carry the Y<br>
developer in the rotation axis direction with the spiral<br>
blades.<br>
In the first carrying chamber in which the first screw<br>
member 26Y is housed, according to the rotation of the<br>
first screw member 26Y, the Y developer is carried from the<br>
front side to the inner side in a direction orthogonal to<br>
the surface of the figure. When the Y developer is carried<br>
to near the end on the inner side of the casing 21Y, the Y<br>
developer enters the second carrying chamber through a not-<br>
shown opening provided in the partition wall.<br>
The developing unit 23Y is formed above the second<br>
carrying chamber in which the second screw member 32Y is<br>
housed. The second carrying chamber and the developing<br>
unit 23Y communicate with each other in the entire area of<br>
sections thereof opposed to each other. The second screw<br>
member 32Y and the developing sleeve 24Y disposed obliquely<br>
above the second screw member 32Y are opposed to each other<br>
while maintaining a parallel relation. In the second<br>
carrying chamber, the Y developer is conveyed from the<br>
inner side to the front side in the direction orthogonal to<br>
the surface of the figure. In a process of this conveyance,<br>
the Y developer around the rotating direction of the second<br>
screw member 32Y is drawn up to the developing sleeve 24Y<br><br>
as appropriate and the Y developer after development is<br>
collected from the developing sleeve 24Y as appropriate.<br>
The Y developer carried to near the end on the front side<br>
in the figure of the second carrying chamber returns to the<br>
inside of the first carrying chamber through the not-shown<br>
opening provided in the partition wall.<br>
The toner concentration sensor 45Y as the toner-<br>
concentration detecting unit including the permeability<br>
sensor is fixed to the lower wall of the first carrying<br>
chamber. The toner concentration sensor 45Y detects, from<br>
below the first screw member 26Y, a toner concentration of<br>
the Y developer carried by the first screw member 2 6Y and<br>
outputs a voltage corresponding to a result of the<br>
detection. A not-shown control unit drives a not-shown Y<br>
toner supplying device as required based on an output<br>
voltage value from the toner concentration sensor 45Y to<br>
supply an appropriate quantity of the Y toner into the<br>
first carrying chamber. Consequently, a toner<br>
concentration of the Y developer reduced by the development<br>
is recovered.<br>
A Y toner image formed on the photosensitive member<br>
11Y is primarily transferred onto the intermediate transfer<br>
belt 51 in a primary transfer nip for Y described later. A<br>
transfer residual toner not primarily transferred onto the<br>
intermediate transfer belt 51 adheres to the surface of the<br>
photosensitive member 11Y that has undergone this primary<br>
transfer process.<br>
The drum cleaning device 14Y cantilevers a cleaning<br>
blade 15Y made of, for example, polyurethane rubber and<br>
sets a free end side thereof in contact with the surface of<br>
the photosensitive member 11Y. The drum cleaning device<br>
14Y sets a brush tip side of a brush roller 16Y, which<br>
includes rotation shaft members driven to rotate by a not-<br><br>
shown driving unit and innumerable conductive raisings<br>
vertically provided on peripheral surfaces of the rotation<br>
shaft members, in contact with the photosensitive member<br>
11Y. The drum cleaning device 14Y scrapes off the transfer<br>
residual toner from the surface of the photosensitive<br>
member 11Y with the cleaning blade 15Y and the brush roller<br>
16Y. A cleaning bias is applied to the brush roller 16Y<br>
via an electric field roller 17Y of metal, which comes into<br>
contact with the brush roller 16Y. The tip of a scraper<br>
18Y is pressed against the electric field roller 17Y. The<br>
transfer residual toner scraped off from the photosensitive<br>
member 11Y by the cleaning blade 15Y and the brush roller<br>
16Y passes through the brush roller 16Y and the electric<br>
field roller 17Y and is then scraped off from the electric<br>
field roller 17Y by the scraper 18Y to fall onto a<br>
collection screw 18Y. The transfer residual toner is<br>
discharged to the outside of the casing according to the<br>
rotation of the collection screw 18Y and the returned into<br>
the developer carrying device 22 via a not-shown toner<br>
recycle carrying unit.<br>
The surface of the photosensitive member 11Y, from<br>
which the transfer residual toner is cleaned by the drum<br>
cleaning device 14Y, is subjected to charge removal by the<br>
charge removing device 13Y including a charge removing lamp<br>
and then uniformly charged by the charging member 12Y again.<br>
The potential of the non-image section of the<br>
photosensitive member 11Y, which has passed a position of<br>
optical writing by writing light L, is detected by the Y-<br>
potential sensor 49Y and a result of the detection is sent<br>
to the not-shown control unit.<br>
The photosensitive member 11Y having a diameter of 60<br>
[mm] is driven to rotate at linear speed of 282 [mm/sec].<br>
The developing sleeve 24Y having a diameter of 25 [mm] is<br><br>
driven to rotate at linear speed of 564 [mm/sec]. An<br>
amount of a toner in a developer supplied to the<br>
development area is in a range of about -10 [μC/g] to -30<br>
[μC/g] . A development gap, which is a gap between the<br>
photosensitive member 11Y and the developing sleeve 24Y, is<br>
set in a range of 0.5 mm to 0.3 mm. The thickness of a<br>
photosensitive layer of the photosensitive member 11Y is 30<br>
[μm] . A beam spot diameter on the photosensitive member<br>
11Y of the writing light L is 50x60 [μm] . A quantity of<br>
light of the writing light L is about 0.47 [mW]. A<br>
uniformly charged potential of the photosensitive member<br>
11Y is, for example, -700 [V] and the potential of an<br>
electrostatic latent image is -120 [V]. Moreover, a<br>
voltage of a developing bias is, for example, -470 [V] and<br>
a development potential of 350 [V] is secured.<br>
The process unit 10Y has been described in detail.<br>
The process units of the other colors (10C, 10M, and 10K)<br>
are the same as the process unit 10Y except that colors of<br>
toners used therein are different.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the photosensitive members 11Y,<br>
11C, 11M, and 11K of the process units 10Y, 10C, 10M, and<br>
10K rotate while coming into contact with the upper stretch<br>
surface of the intermediate transfer belt 51 endlessly<br>
moved in the clockwise direction and form primary transfer<br>
nips for Y, C, M, and K. On the rear sides of the primary<br>
transfer nips for Y, C, M, and K, the primary transfer<br>
rollers 55Y, 55C, 55M, and 55K are in contact with the rear<br>
surface of the intermediate transfer belt 51. Primary<br>
transfer biases having a polarity opposite to the charging<br>
polarity of the toner are applied to the primary transfer<br>
rollers 55Y, 55C, 55M, and 55K by not-shown bias supplying<br>
units, respectively. Primary transfer fields for<br><br>
electrostatically moving the toner from the photosensitive<br>
member side to the belt side are formed in the primary<br>
transfer nips for Y, C, M, and K by the primary transfer<br>
biases. Y, C, M, and K toner images formed on the<br>
photosensitive members 11Y, 11C, 11M, and UK enter the<br>
primary transfer nips for Y, C, M, and K according to the<br>
rotation of the photosensitive members 11Y, 11C, 11M, and<br>
UK. The Y, C, M, and K toner images are sequentially<br>
superimposed one another and primarily transferred onto the<br>
intermediate transfer belt 51 by the primary transfer<br>
fields and an action of a nip pressure. Consequently, a<br>
four-color superimposed toner image (hereinafter, "four-<br>
color toner image") is formed on the front surface (a loop<br>
outer peripheral surface) of the intermediate transfer belt<br>
51. Conductive brushes to which the primary transfer<br>
biases are applied, a no-contact corona charger, or the<br>
like can be adopted instead of the primary transfer rollers<br>
55Y, 55C, 55M, and 55K.<br>
On the right side in the figure of the process unit<br>
10K, an optical sensor unit 61 is disposed to be opposed to<br>
the front surface of the intermediate transfer belt 51 via<br>
a predetermined gap. The optical sensor unit 61 includes,<br>
as shown in Fig. 4, a rear side position sensor 62R, a Y<br>
image concentration sensor 63Y, a C image concentration<br>
sensor 63C, a center position sensor 62c, an M image<br>
concentration sensor 63M, a K image concentration sensor<br>
63K, and a front side position sensor 62F arranged in the<br>
width direction of the intermediate transfer belt 51. All<br>
of these sensors include reflection photosensors. The<br>
sensors reflect light emitted from a not-shown light-<br>
emitting element on the front surface of the intermediate<br>
transfer belt 51 and a toner image on the belt and detects<br>
an amount of reflected light with a not-shown light-<br><br>
receiving element. The not-shown control unit can detect<br>
the toner image on the intermediate transfer belt 51 and<br>
detect a concentration of the image (a toner deposit amount<br>
per unit area) based on output voltage values from the<br>
sensors.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, a secondary transfer roller 56 is<br>
disposed below the intermediate transfer belt 51. The<br>
secondary transfer roller 56 comes into contact with the<br>
front surface of the intermediate transfer belt 51 and<br>
forms a secondary transfer nip while being driven to rotate<br>
counterclockwise in the figure by a not-shown driving unit.<br>
On the rear side of the secondary transfer nip, the<br>
intermediate transfer belt 51 is wound around the secondary<br>
transfer backup roller 53, which is electrically grounded.<br>
The secondary transfer bias having a polarity opposite<br>
to a charging polarity of a toner is applied to the<br>
secondary transfer roller 56 by the not-shown bias<br>
supplying unit to form a secondary transfer field between<br>
the secondary transfer roller 56 and the grounded secondary<br>
transfer backup roller 53. The four-color toner image<br>
formed on the front surface of the intermediate transfer<br>
belt 51 enters the secondary transfer nip according to the<br>
endless movement of the intermediate transfer belt 51.<br>
In Fig. 1, in the sheet feeding device 200, a<br>
plurality of sheet feeding cassettes 201 that store<br>
recording sheets P, a plurality of sheet feeding rollers<br>
202 that deliver the recording sheets P stored in the sheet<br>
feeding cassettes 201 to the outside of the cassettes, a<br>
plurality of separation roller pairs 203 that separate the<br>
delivered recording sheets P one by one, a plurality of<br>
conveying roller pairs 205 that convey the recording sheet<br>
P after the separation along a delivering path 204, and the<br>
like are disposed. The sheet feeding device 200 is<br><br>
disposed right below the printer unit 1 as shown in the<br>
figure. The delivering path 204 of the sheet feeding<br>
device 200 is connected to a sheet feeding path 70 of the<br>
printer unit 1. Consequently, the recording sheets P<br>
delivered from the sheet feeding cassettes 201 of the sheet<br>
feeding device 200 are fed into the sheet feeding path 70<br>
of the printer unit 1 through the delivering path 204.<br>
A registration roller pair 71 is disposed near the end<br>
of the sheet feeding path 70 of the printer unit 1. The<br>
registration roller pair 71 delivers the recording sheet P<br>
nipped between the rollers to the secondary transfer nip at<br>
timing when the recording sheet P is synchronized with the<br>
four-color toner image on the intermediate transfer belt 51.<br>
In the secondary transfer nip, the four-color toner image<br>
on the intermediate transfer belt 51 is secondarily<br>
transferred onto the recording sheet P collectively by the<br>
influence of a secondary transfer field and a nip pressure.<br>
The four-color toner image forms a full color image in<br>
conjunction with the while color of the recording sheet P.<br>
The recording sheet P on which the full color image is<br>
formed in this way is discharged from the secondary nip and<br>
separated from the intermediate transfer belt 51.<br>
On the left side in the figure of the secondary<br>
transfer nip, a conveyor belt unit 75 that endlessly moves<br>
an endless sheet conveyor belt 7 6 in a counterclockwise<br>
direction in the figure while stretching the endless sheet<br>
conveyor belt 76 with a plurality of stretch rollers is<br>
disposed. The recording sheet P separated from the<br>
intermediate transfer belt 51 is passed onto an upper<br>
stretch surface of the endless sheet conveyor belt 76 and<br>
conveyed to a fixing device 80.<br>
The recording sheet P sent into the fixing device 80<br>
is nipped in a fixing nip formed by a heating roller 81<br><br>
including a not-shown heat generation source such as a<br>
halogen lamp and a pressure roller 82 that is pressed<br>
against the heating roller 81. The recording sheet P is<br>
heated while being pressed and is sent to the outside of<br>
the fixing device 80 while having the full color image<br>
fixed on the surface thereof.<br>
A slight quantity of secondary transfer residual toner<br>
not transferred onto the recording sheet P adheres to the<br>
surface of the intermediate transfer belt 51 after passing<br>
through the secondary transfer nip. The secondary transfer<br>
residual toner is removed from the intermediate transfer<br>
belt 51 by a belt cleaning device 57 that is in contact<br>
with the front surface of the intermediate transfer belt 51.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a switch-back device 85 is<br>
disposed below the fixing device 80. When the recording<br>
sheet P discharged from the fixing device 80 comes to a<br>
conveying path switching position for switching by a<br>
swingable switching pawl, the recording sheet P is sent to<br>
a sheet discharge roller pair 87 or the switch-back device<br>
85 according to a swing stop position of the switching pawl<br>
86. When the recording sheet P is sent to the sheet<br>
discharge roller pair 87, after being discharged to the<br>
outside of the apparatus, the recording sheet P is stacked<br>
on the sheet discharge tray 3.<br>
On the other hand, when the recording sheet P is sent<br>
to the switch-back device 85, after being reversed by<br>
switch-back conveyance by the switch-back device 85, the<br>
recording sheet P is conveyed to the registration roller<br>
pair 71 again. The recording sheet P enters the secondary<br>
transfer nip again and a full color image is formed on the<br>
other surface.<br>
The recording sheet P manually fed on the manual feed<br>
tray 2 provided on the side of the housing of the printer<br><br>
unit 1 is fed to the registration roller pair 71 after<br>
passing through a manual feed roller 72 and a manual feed<br>
separation roller pair 73. The registration roller pair 71<br>
may be grounded or may be applied with a bias to remove<br>
paper powder of the recording sheet P.<br>
When a user takes a copy of an original with the<br>
copying machine according to this embodiment, first, the<br>
user sets the original on an original stand 401 of the<br>
original automatic document feeder 400. Alternatively, the<br>
user opens the original automatic document feeder 400, sets<br>
the original on the contact glass 301 of the scanner 300,<br>
and closes the original automatic document feeder 400 to<br>
press the original. Thereafter, when the user presses a<br>
start switch (not-shown) , when the original is set on the<br>
original automatic document feeder 4 00, the original is fed<br>
to the contact glass 301. The scanner 300 drives to start<br>
scanning by the first traveling member 303 and the second<br>
traveling member 304. At substantially the same time,<br>
driving of the transfer unit 50 and the respective color<br>
process units 10Y, 10C, 10M, and 10K is started. Delivery<br>
of the recording sheet P from the sheet feeding device 200<br>
is also started. When the recording sheet P not set in the<br>
sheet feeding cassettes 201 is used, delivery of the<br>
recording sheet P set on the manual feed tray 2 is<br>
performed.<br>
Fig. 5 is a block diagram of the copying machine shown<br>
in Fig. 1. The copying machine includes a control unit 500<br>
that manages control of various devices. In the control<br>
unit 500, a read only memory (ROM) 503 that stores therein<br>
stationary data such as a computer program in advance and a<br>
random access memory (RAM) 502 that functions as a work<br>
area or the like for rewritably storing various data are<br>
connected via a bus line to a central processing unit (CPU)<br><br>
501 that executes control of various arithmetic operations<br>
and driving of respective units. The ROM 503 also stores<br>
therein a concentration conversion data table indicating a<br>
relation between output voltage values from image<br>
concentration sensors of the respective colors (63Y, 63C,<br>
63M, and 63K in Fig. 4) in the optical sensor unit 61 and<br>
image densities corresponding to the output voltage values.<br>
The printer unit 1, the sheet feeding device 200, the<br>
scanner 300, and the ADF 400 are connected to the control<br>
unit 500. For convenience of illustration, only a few<br>
sensors and the optical writing unit 60 are shown as<br>
devices in the printer unit 1. In other words, the control<br>
unit 500 controls other devices (e.g., a transfer unit and<br>
various color process units) that are not shown in Fig. 5.<br>
Signals output from each of the sensors are sent to the<br>
control unit 500.<br>
Fig. 6 is a flowchart of a parameter correction<br>
processing carried out by the control unit 500. The<br>
parameter correction processing is carried out at<br>
predetermined timing, such as during start of the copying<br>
machine, every time the number of copies decided in advance<br>
is taken (between a preceding print operation and a flowing<br>
print operation in a continuous print operation), or every<br>
fixed time. In Fig. 6, a processing flow during start of<br>
the copying machine is shown.<br>
When the parameter correction processing is started,<br>
first, to distinguish timing for turning on a power supply<br>
from timing for abnormal processing for jam or the like, a<br>
heating roller surface temperature (hereinafter, "fixing<br>
temperature") in the fixing device 80 is detected as a<br>
condition for executing the processing flow. It is judged<br>
whether the fixing temperature exceeds 100 [°C] . When the<br>
fixing temperature exceeds 100 [°C] (NO at step SI), the<br><br>
control unit 500 regards that it is not the time for<br>
turning on the power supply and finishes the processing<br>
flow.<br>
When the fixing temperature does not exceed 100 [°C]<br>
(YES at step SI), the control unit 500 performs potential<br>
sensor check (step S2). In this potential sensor check,<br>
the control unit 500 uniformly charges, in the process<br>
units of the respective colors 10Y to 10K, the surfaces of<br>
the photosensitive members 11Y to UK under a predetermined<br>
condition and detects surface potentials of the<br>
photosensitive members 11Y to UK with the potential sensor<br>
(e.g., 49Y in Fig. 3). Thereafter, the control unit 500<br>
performs Vsg adjustment or the optical sensor unit (61 in<br>
Fig. 4) (step S3). In this Vsg adjustment, the control<br>
unit 500 adjusts, for the respective sensors 62R, 62C, 62F,<br>
63Y, 63C, 63M, and 63K, an amount of light emission from a<br>
light-emitting element to fix an output voltage (Vsg) from<br>
a light-receiving element that detects reflected light to<br>
the non-image area of the intermediate transfer belt 51.<br>
At steps S2 to S3, the control unit 500 performs the<br>
potential sensor check and the Vsg adjustment for the<br>
respective colors in parallel.<br>
When the Vsg adjustment is finished, the control unit<br>
500 judges whether there is an error in the potential<br>
sensor check (step S2) and the Vsg adjustment (steps S3 and<br>
S4). When there is an error (NO at S4), after setting an<br>
error code corresponding to the error (step S18), the<br>
control unit 500 finishes the operation. On the other hand,<br>
when there is no error (YES at S4), the control unit 500<br>
judges whether a parameter correction system is<br>
automatically set (step S5). The control unit 500 executes<br>
the processing at steps S3 to S4 regardless of the<br>
parameter correction system.<br><br>
When the parameter correction system is not<br>
automatically set (parameters are set to fixed values) (NO<br>
at S5), after setting the error code, the control unit 500<br>
finishes the series of control flows. On the other hand,<br>
when the parameter correction system is automatically set<br>
(YES at S5), the control unit 500 executes a flow at steps<br>
S6 to S16 described later.<br>
At step S6, the control unit 500 forms seven sets of<br>
toner patch patterns including a plurality of reference<br>
toner images shown in Fig. 4 on the front surface of the<br>
intermediate transfer belt 51. These toner patch patterns<br>
are formed side by side in the width direction of the<br>
intermediate transfer belt 51 to be detected by any one of<br>
the seven sensors 62R, 62C, 62F, 63Y, 63C, 63M, and 63K<br>
included in the optical sensor unit 61. These seven sets<br>
of toner patch patterns are roughly divided into patch<br>
patterns for concentration gradation detection and patch<br>
patterns for positional deviation detection.<br>
As the patch patterns for concentration gradation<br>
detection, patch patterns for Y, C, M, and K concentration<br>
gradation detection PpY, PpC, PpM, and PpK including a<br>
plurality of same color reference toner images (Y, C, M, or<br>
K reference toner images) having different image densities<br>
are individually formed and detected by the Y, C, M, and K<br>
image concentration sensors 63Y, 63C, 63M, and 63K.<br>
Referring to the patch pattern PpY for Y concentration<br>
gradation detection as an example, as shown in Fig. 7, the<br>
patch pattern PpY includes n Y reference toner images, i.e.,<br>
a first Y reference toner image PpY1, a second Y reference<br>
toner image PpY2, ..., and an nth reference toner image<br>
PpYn, arranged at predetermined intervals G in a belt<br>
moving direction (an arrow direction in the figure). These<br>
reference toner images have different image densities but<br><br>
have the same shape and posture on the intermediate<br>
transfer belt 51. The reference toner images have a<br>
rectangular shape with the width direction thereof set<br>
along the belt width direction and the length direction<br>
thereof set along the belt moving direction. Width W1<br>
thereof is 15 [mm] and length L1 thereof is 20 [mm]. The<br>
interval G is 10 [mm]. An interval in the belt width<br>
direction in patch patterns of different colors is 5 [mm].<br>
The respective reference toner images in these patch<br>
patterns for concentration gradation detection PpY, PpC,<br>
PpM, and PpK are toner images formed on the photosensitive<br>
members 11Y, 11C, 11M, and UK of the respective process<br>
units 10Y, 10C, 10M, and 10K and transferred onto the<br>
intermediate transfer belt 51. When the reference toner<br>
images pass right below the image concentration sensors 63Y,<br>
63C, 63M, and 63K according to the endless movement of the<br>
intermediate transfer belt 51, the reference toner images<br>
reflect light emitted from the sensors on the surfaces<br>
thereof. Amounts of the reflected light take values<br>
correlated to image densities of the reference toner images.<br>
The control unit 500 stores, for each of the colors, sensor<br>
output voltage values for the respective reference toner<br>
images in the RAM 502 as Vpi (i=l to N) (step S8). After<br>
specifying image densities (toner deposit amounts per unit<br>
area) of the respective reference toner images based on the<br>
sensor output voltage values and the concentration<br>
conversion data table stored in the ROM 503 in advance, the<br>
control unit 500 stores a specified result in the RAM 502<br>
(step S9). Before the patch patterns for concentration<br>
gradation detection for the respective colors are developed<br>
on the photosensitive members of the respective colors,<br>
potentials of respective reference latent images as<br>
precursors of the respective reference toner images are<br><br>
detected by the potential sensors. The control unit 500<br>
sequentially stores results of the detection in the RAM 502<br>
(step S7).<br>
When the toner deposit amounts for the reference toner<br>
images of the respective colors are specified, the control<br>
unit 500 calculates appropriate development potentials for<br>
the developing devices of the respective colors (step S10).<br>
Specifically, for example, a relation between the<br>
potentials of the respective reference latent images<br>
obtained at S7 and the toner deposit amounts obtained at S9<br>
are plotted on an X-Y plane as shown in Fig. 8. In the<br>
figure, the X axis indicates a potential (a difference<br>
between a development bias VB and a latent image potential)<br>
and the Y axis indicates a toner deposit amount per unit<br>
area [mg/cm2] . As described above, the reflection<br>
photosensors are used as the respective sensors of the<br>
optical sensor unit 61. Output voltage values from the<br>
sensors are saturated when a toner deposit amount on a<br>
reference toner image is considerably large. Therefore,<br>
when a toner deposit amount is calculated using a sensor<br>
output voltage value for a reference toner image having a<br>
relatively large toner deposit amount, an error occurs.<br>
Thus, as shown in Fig. 9, only a data combination in a<br>
section in which a relation between the potential of a<br>
reference latent image and a toner deposit amount is linear<br>
is selected among a plurality of data combinations<br>
including potentials of reference latent images and toner<br>
deposit amounts for reference toner images. Linear<br>
approximation of a development characteristic is obtained<br>
by applying the method of least squares to the data in this<br>
section. A development potential for each of the colors is<br>
calculated based on an approximate linear equation (E)<br>
obtained for each of the colors. Although the reflection<br><br>
photosensors of the regular reflection type are used in<br>
this copying machine, reflection photosensors of the<br>
diffuse reflection type can be used.<br>
The following equations are used in the calculation by<br>
the method of least squares:<br>
Xave=ΣXn/k	(1)<br>
Yave=ΣYn/k	(2)<br>
Sx=Σ(Xn-Xave)x(Xn-Xave)	(3)<br>
Sy=Σ(Yn-Yave)x(Yn-Yave)	(4)<br>
Sxy=Σ(Xn-Xave)x(Yn-Yave)	(5)<br>
When the approximate linear equation (E) obtained from<br>
the output values from the potential sensors of the<br>
respective colors (the potentials of the reference latent<br>
images of the respective colors) and the toner deposit<br>
amounts (the image densities) for the respective reference<br>
toner images is Y=A1xX+B1, coefficients A1 and B1 can be<br>
represented as follows:<br>
A1=Sxy/Sx	(6)<br>
B1=Yave-AlxXave	(7)<br>
A correlation coefficient R of the approximate linear<br>
equation (E) can be represented as follows:<br>
RxR=(SxyxSxy)/(SxxSy)	(8)<br>
Among potential data Xn and toner deposit amount data<br>
Yn after visualization obtained from the potentials of the<br>
reference latent images and the toner deposit amounts for<br>
each of the colors, which are calculated up to S9, the<br>
following five sets of data having smaller numerical values<br>
are selected:<br>
(X1 to X5, Y1 to Y5)<br>
(X2 to X6, Y2 to Y6)<br>
(X3 to X7, Y3 to Y7)<br>
(X4 to X8, Y4 to Y8)<br><br>
(X5 to X9, Y5 to Y9)<br>
(X6 to X10, Y6 to Y10)<br>
Linear approximation calculation is performed<br>
according to Equations (1) to (8) and the correlation<br>
coefficient R is calculated to obtain the following six<br>
sets of approximate linear equations and correlation<br>
coefficients (9) to (14):<br>
Y11=A11xX+B11; R11	(9)<br>
Y12=A12xX+B12; R12	(10)<br>
Y13=A13xX+B13; R13	(11)<br>
Y14=Al4xX+B14; R14	(12)<br>
Y15=A15xX+B15; R15	(13)<br>
Y16=A16xX+B16; R16	(14)<br>
One approximate linear equation corresponding to a<br>
maximum value among the correlation coefficients R11 to R16<br>
is selected as the approximate linear equation (E) out of<br>
the obtained six approximate linear equations.<br>
In the approximate linear equation (E), a value of X<br>
at the time when a value of Y is a necessary maximum toner<br>
deposit amount Max as shown in Fig. 9, i.e., a value Vmax<br>
of a development potential is calculated. A development<br>
bias potential VB in each of the developing devices of the<br>
respective colors and an appropriate latent image potential<br>
(a potential of an exposing unit) VL corresponding to the<br>
development bias potential VB are given by the following<br>
Equations (15) and (16) from the equations described above:<br>
Vmax=(Mmax-Bl)/Al	(15)<br>
VB-VL=Vmax=(Mmax-B1)/A1	(16)<br>
A relation between VB and VL can be represented using the<br>
coefficients of the approximate linear equation (E).<br>
Therefore, Equation (16) is represented as follows:<br>
Mmax=A1xVmax+B1	(17)<br><br>
A relation between a background potential VD, which is<br>
potential before exposure of the photosensitive members,<br>
and the development bias potential VB is given from an X<br>
coordinate VK (a development start voltage of the<br>
developing device) at an intersection point of a linear<br>
equation shown in Fig. 9, i.e.,<br>
Y=A2*X+B2	(18)<br>
and the X axis and a background smear margin voltage Va,<br>
which is experimentally obtained:<br>
VD-VB=VK+Vα	(19)<br>
Therefore, a relation among Vmax, VD, VB, and VL<br>
depends on Equations (16) and (19). In this example, with<br>
Vmax as a reference value, a relation between the reference<br>
value and the respective voltages VD, VB, and VL is<br>
obtained by an experiment and the like in advance and<br>
stored in the ROM 503 as a potential control table as shown<br>
in Fig. 10.<br>
The control unit 500 selects Vmax closest to Vmax<br>
calculated for each of the colors from the potential<br>
control table and sets the respective control voltages<br>
(potentials) VB, VD, and VL corresponding to the selected<br>
Vmax as target potentials (step S11).<br>
Thereafter, the control unit 500 controls laser<br>
emission power of the semiconductor lasers of the optical<br>
writing unit 60 to be a maximum amount of light via a<br>
writing control circuit 510 and captures an output value of<br>
the potential sensor to thereby detect a residual potential<br>
on the photosensitive members (step S12). When the<br>
residual potential is not 0 [V], the control unit 500<br>
corrects the target potentials VB, VD, and VL determined at<br>
step Sll by an amount of the residual potential to set<br>
target potentials.<br>
The control unit 500 judges whether there is no error<br><br>
at steps S5 to S13 (step S14). When there is an error even<br>
in one color (NO at S14), the control unit 500 sets an<br>
error code because image concentration fluctuation is large<br>
and processing after this is useless even if only the other<br>
colors are controlled (step S18) and finishes the series of<br>
control flows. The control unit 500 does not update image<br>
creation conditions and creates an image under image<br>
creation conditions same as those of the last time until<br>
the next parameter correction processing is successful.<br>
When it is judged at S14 that there is no error (Y),<br>
the control unit 500 adjusts a power supply circuit (not<br>
shown) such that the background potential VD of the<br>
photosensitive members of the respective colors reach the<br>
target potential. The control unit 500 adjusts laser light<br>
power in the semiconductor lasers via a laser control unit<br>
(not shown) such that the surface potential VL of the<br>
photosensitive members reaches the target potential. The<br>
control unit 500 adjusts the power supply circuit such that<br>
the development bias potential VB reaches the target<br>
potential in the developing devices of the respective<br>
colors (step S15).<br>
The control unit 500 judges whether there is an error<br>
at S15 (step S16). When there is no error (YES at S16),<br>
after performing positional deviation correction processing<br>
described later, the control unit 500 finishes the series<br>
of control processing. On the other hand, when there is an<br>
error (NO at S16), the control unit 500 finishes the series<br>
of control flows after setting an error code.<br>
As patch patterns for positional deviation detection,<br>
as shown in Fig. 4, the three sets of patch patterns, i.e.,<br>
the patch patterns for rear side positional deviation PcR<br>
formed near one end in the width direction of the<br>
intermediate transfer belt 51, patch patterns for center<br><br>
positional deviation detection PpC formed in the center in<br>
the width direction, and patch patterns for front side<br>
positional deviation detection formed near the other end in<br>
the width direction are formed. All of the patch patterns<br>
include a plurality of reference toner images arranged in<br>
the belt moving direction. Each of the three sets of patch<br>
patterns has reference toner images of four colors, Y, C, M,<br>
and K. If no positional deviation occurs in the<br>
photosensitive members and an exposure optical system in<br>
each of the rear side, the center, and the front side,<br>
reference toner images of the respective colors are formed<br>
at equal intervals and in equal postures. However, when<br>
positional deviation occurs, formation intervals vary and<br>
postures tilt. Therefore, in the positional deviation<br>
correction processing (step S17), the control unit 500<br>
detects irregularity of the formation intervals and the<br>
postures based on detection time intervals of the<br>
respective reference toner images. The control unit 500<br>
adjusts, based on a result of the detection, the tilt of a<br>
mirror of the exposure optical system using a not-shown<br>
tilt correcting mechanism and corrects exposure start<br>
timing. Consequently, positional deviation of the toner<br>
images of the respective colors is reduced.<br>
Fig. 11 is a disassembled perspective view of the<br>
developing device 20Y for Y. Fig. 12 is a disassembled<br>
plan view of the developing device 20Y viewed from above.<br>
As described above, the developing device 20Y includes the<br>
developing unit 23Y including the developing sleeve 24Y and<br>
the developer carrying device 22Y that agitates and carries<br>
the Y developer. The developer carrying device 22Y<br>
includes a first carrying chamber that houses the first<br>
screw member 2 6Y as the agitating and carrying member and<br>
the second carrying chamber that houses the second screw<br><br>
member 32Y as the agitating and carrying member. The first<br>
screw member 26Y includes a rotation shaft member 27Y, both<br>
ends in an axial direction of which are rotatably supported<br>
by bearings, and a spiral blade 28Y protrudingly provided<br>
in a spiral shape on a peripheral surface of the rotation<br>
shaft member 27Y. The second screw member 32Y includes a<br>
rotation shaft member 33Y, both ends in an axial direction<br>
of which are rotatably supported by bearings, and a spiral<br>
blade 34Y protrudingly provided in a spiral shape on a<br>
peripheral surface of the rotation shaft member 33Y.<br>
The first screw member 26Y in the first carrying<br>
chamber as the developer carrying unit is surrounded by a<br>
wall of the casing around sides thereof. On two sides<br>
located on both sides in the axial direction of the first<br>
screw member 26Y, a rear side plate 21Y-1 and a front side<br>
plate 21Y-2 of the casing surround the first screw member<br>
26Y from both sides in the axial direction. On one of two<br>
sides located on both sides in a direction orthogonal to<br>
the axial direction of the first screw member 26Y, a left<br>
side plate 21Y-3 of the casing as the sidewall extends in<br>
the rotation axis direction of the first screw member 26Y<br>
while being opposed to the first screw member 26Y via a<br>
predetermined gap. On the other of the two sides, a<br>
partition wall 21Y-5 as a sidewall that partitions the<br>
first carrying chamber and the second carrying chamber<br>
extends in the rotation axis direction of the first screw<br>
member 2 6Y while being opposed to the first screw member<br>
26Y via a predetermined gap.<br>
The second screw member 32Y in the second carrying<br>
chamber as the developer carrying unit is also surrounded<br>
by the wall of the casing around sides thereof. On two<br>
sides located on both sides in the axial direction of the<br>
second screw member 32Y, the rear side plate 21Y-1 and the<br><br>
front side plate 21Y-2 of the casing surround the second<br>
screw member 32Y from both sides in the axial direction.<br>
On one of two sides located on both sides in a direction<br>
orthogonal to the axial direction of the second screw<br>
member 32Y, a right side plate 21Y-4 of the casing as the<br>
sidewall extends in the rotation axis direction of the<br>
second screw member 32Y while being opposed to the second<br>
screw member 32Y via a predetermined gap. On the other of<br>
the two sides, the partition wall 21Y-5 that partitions the<br>
first carrying chamber and the second carrying chamber<br>
extends in the rotation axis direction of the second screw<br>
member 32Y while being opposed to the second screw member<br>
32Y via a predetermined gap.<br>
The second screw member 32Y, the sides of which are<br>
surrounded by the wall, carries the not-shown Y developer<br>
stored in the spiral blade 34Y in the rotation axis<br>
direction from the left side to the right side in Fig. 12<br>
while agitating the Y developer in the rotating direction<br>
according to the rotation drive. Because the second screw<br>
member 32Y and the developing sleeve 24Y are disposed in<br>
parallel to each other, a carrying direction of the Y<br>
developer is a direction along the rotation axis direction<br>
of the developing sleeve 24Y. The second screw member 32Y<br>
supplies the Y developer to the surface of the developing<br>
sleeve 24Y in the axial direction thereof.<br>
The Y developer carried to near the right side end in<br>
the figure of the second screw member 32Y enters the first<br>
carrying chamber through an opening provided in the<br>
partition wall 21Y-5 and then is stored in the spiral blade<br>
28Y of the first screw member 26Y. According to the<br>
rotation drive of the first screw member 26Y, the Y<br>
developer is carried along the rotation axis direction of<br>
the first screw member 2 6Y from the right side to the left<br><br>
side in the figure while being agitated in the rotating<br>
direction.<br>
In the first carrying chamber, in a part of an area in<br>
which the first screw member 26Y is surrounded by the left<br>
side plate 21Y-3 and the partition wall 21Y-5 of the casing,<br>
the Y toner concentration sensor 45Y is fixed to the lower<br>
wall of the casing. The Y toner concentration sensor 45Y<br>
detects, from below the first screw member 26Y, the<br>
permeability of the Y developer carried along the rotation<br>
axis direction by the first screw member 26Y and outputs a<br>
voltage of a value corresponding to a result of the<br>
detection to the control unit 500. Because the<br>
permeability of the Y developer has a correlation with the<br>
Y toner concentration of the Y developer, the control unit<br>
500 grasps the Y toner concentration based on the output<br>
voltage value from the Y toner concentration sensor 45Y.<br>
The printer unit 1 includes not-shown Y, C, M, and K<br>
toner supplying units for individually supplying the Y, C,<br>
M, and K toners into the Y, C, M, and K developing devices.<br>
The control unit 500 stores Vtref for Y, C, M, and K, which<br>
indicates target values of output voltage values from the Y,<br>
C, M, and K toner concentration sensors 45Y, 45C, 45M, and<br>
45K, in the RAM 502. When differences between the output<br>
voltage values from the Y, C, M, and K toner concentration<br>
sensors and Vtref for Y, C, M, and K exceed a predetermined<br>
value, the Y, C, M, and K toner supplying units are driven<br>
for times corresponding to the differences. Consequently,<br>
the Y, C, M, and K toners are supplied from a toner supply<br>
port (e.g., A in Fig. 12) provided on a most upstream side<br>
in the first carrying chamber in the Y, C, M, and K<br>
developing devices into the first carrying chamber. Y, C,<br>
M, and K toner densities of the Y, C, M, and K developers<br>
are maintained in a fixed range.<br><br>
The permeability of a developer shows a satisfactory<br>
correlation with a bulk volume of the developer. The bulk<br>
volume of the developer fluctuates because of an unattended<br>
state of the developer even if a toner concentration of the<br>
developer is fixed. For example, the developer unattended<br>
for a long time in a state in which the developer is not<br>
agitated by the screw members in the first carrying chamber<br>
and the second carrying chamber emits the air among toner<br>
particles and carriers because of an own weight of the<br>
developer. An amount of charge of the toner particles is<br>
reduced. Thus, a bulk volume of the toner is gradually<br>
increased as the unattended time passes. According to the<br>
increase in the bulk volume, the permeability is gradually<br>
increased. When the toner is unattended for a long period,<br>
the increases in the bulk volume and the permeability are<br>
saturated. In such a saturated state, a distance among the<br>
magnetic carriers is small compared with that in the<br>
developer during image creation (during agitation).<br>
Therefore, the fall in a toner concentration from an<br>
original value is misdetected.<br>
On the other hand, when the developer, the increases<br>
in the bulk volume and the permeability of which are<br>
saturated because the developer is left unattended for a<br>
long time, is agitated by the screw members in the first<br>
carrying chamber and the second carrying chamber, the air<br>
is caught between the toner particles and between the<br>
magnetic carriers and a triboelectric charging amount of<br>
the toner particles increases. Therefore, after leaving<br>
the developer in the first carrying chamber and the second<br>
carrying chamber unattended for a long period, when so-<br>
called idle agitation for rotating the screw members<br>
without performing development is started, as shown in Fig.<br>
13, the bulk volume rapidly falls from immediately after<br><br>
the start of the idle agitation until about three minutes<br>
passes. This is because the air is caught in the developer<br>
and a triboelectric charging amount of the toner particles<br>
suddenly increases. Thereafter, although a rate of the<br>
fall in the bulk volume is reduced, the bulk volume<br>
gradually falls as idle agitation time passes. This is<br>
because the triboelectric charging amount of the toner<br>
particles increases little by little according to the<br>
abrasion of an externally added agent added to the toner<br>
particles. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 14, an<br>
externally added agent H for improving fluidity of toner<br>
powder is added to toner particles T. When the externally<br>
added agent H is gradually abraded according to the idle<br>
agitation of the developer, a frictional force among the<br>
toner particles T gradually increases. The increase in the<br>
triboelectric charging amount of the toner particles is<br>
nearly saturated until about three minutes passes from<br>
immediately after the start of the idle agitation.<br>
Thereafter, when the frictional force among the toner<br>
particles T is gradually increased by the abrasion of the<br>
externally added agent H, the triboelectric charging amount<br>
of the toner particles T gradually increases according to<br>
the increase in the frictional force. Consequently, in a<br>
period after three minutes from the start of the idle<br>
agitation, the bulk volume of the developer gradually falls<br>
as time passes. The toner particles T in a default state<br>
are shown in Fig. 14. When 30 minutes pass from the start<br>
of the idle agitation, the toner particles T are in a state<br>
shown in Fig. 15. The fluidity and the bulk volume can be<br>
measured by the metal powder apparent concentration test<br>
method of JIS Z2504: 2000.<br>
As described above, the bulk volume of the developer<br>
gradually falls over a long time as the idle agitation time<br><br>
passes. As shown in Fig. 16, the permeability of the<br>
developer (a toner concentration sensor output Vt)<br>
gradually falls and a result of the detection of the toner<br>
concentration gradually worsens. Then, a large difference<br>
shown in Fig. 17 occurs in the toner concentration sensor<br>
output Vt between the time immediately after the start of<br>
the idle agitation and the time 30 minutes after the start,<br>
although the toner concentration of the developer is fixed.<br>
This causes misdetection of a toner concentration.<br>
In the developing device disclosed in Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open No. 6-308833, for the purpose of<br>
preventing the occurrence of such misdetection, a pressure<br>
of a developer in an area where a toner concentration is<br>
detected by a toner concentration sensor in the entire area<br>
of a developer carrying unit is set higher than pressures<br>
of the developer in the other areas. However, this<br>
pressure indicates a pressure in the conveying direction of<br>
the developer (the rotation axis direction of the screw<br>
members). According to the experiments by the inventors, a<br>
satisfactory correlation is not established between such a<br>
pressure and a degree of occurrence of the misdetection.<br>
Fig. 18 is an enlarged diagram of the developer<br>
carrying device 22K in the developing device for K. In the<br>
figure, in the first carrying chamber including a first<br>
screw member 26K for K, a bottom wall 21K-6 thereof is<br>
opposed to the lower side in the gravity direction of the<br>
first screw member 26K via a predetermined gap. A left<br>
side plate 21K-3 is opposed to one of both lateral sides<br>
orthogonal to the rotation axis direction of the first<br>
screw member 2 6K via a predetermined gap. A partition wall<br>
21K-5 is opposed to the other of both the lateral sides via<br>
a predetermined gap. A K developer 900K is stored not only<br>
in a spiral blade 28K of the first screw member 26K but<br><br>
also in a clearance between the outer edge of the spiral<br>
blade 28K and the left side plate 21K-3, a clearance<br>
between the outer edge of the spiral blade 28K and the<br>
bottom wall 21K-6, and a clearance between the outer edge<br>
of the spiral blade 28K and the partition wall 21K-5. The<br>
K toner concentration sensor 45K fixed to the casing of the<br>
developing device cannot detect a K toner concentration of<br>
the K developer in the spiral blade 28K at a relatively<br>
long distance because the K toner concentration sensor 45K<br>
has a relatively small detectable distance range. The K<br>
toner concentration sensor 45K can only detect a K toner<br>
concentration of the K developer 900K stored in the<br>
clearance between the spiral blade 28K and the bottom wall<br>
21K-6. Therefore, the K developer 900K in the clearance<br>
has to be sufficiently pressed. However, a pressing force<br>
generated by the rotation of the first screw member 2 6K<br>
mainly acts on the K developer 900K stored in the spiral<br>
blade 28K in the conveying direction (the rotation axis<br>
direction). Even if the K developer 900K in the spiral<br>
blade 28K is sufficiently pressed in the conveying<br>
direction, the K developer 900K in the clearance may not be<br>
sufficiently pressed. Consequently, a satisfactory<br>
correlation is not established between a pressure in the<br>
convention direction applied to the developer and a degree<br>
of occurrence of misdetection of a toner concentration.<br>
The inventors also found the developing device shown<br>
in the figure has a deficiency described below. When the K<br>
developer 900K is not pressed against the surface of the K<br>
toner concentration sensor 45K with a sufficient pressure<br>
according to the rotation of the first screw member 26K,<br>
the replacement of the K developer 900K near the K toner<br>
concentration sensor 45K is not actively performed.<br>
Regardless of the fact that the first screw member 26K<br><br>
rotates many times, the same K developer 900K stays near<br>
the K toner concentration sensor 4 5K for a long time and<br>
the K toner concentration of the K developer 900K continues<br>
to be detected. Consequently, a substantial change in the<br>
K toner concentration of the K developer 900K is not<br>
quickly detected.<br>
Therefore, it is necessary to increase a pressing<br>
force in the screw rotation direction and press the<br>
developer strongly against a permeability detection surface<br>
of the toner concentration sensor instead of increasing a<br>
pressing force in the screw axis direction (the conveying<br>
direction) on the developer. In Fig. 18, the permeability<br>
detection surface of the K toner concentration sensor 45K<br>
is brought into contact with the K developer 900K in the<br>
first conveying chamber. However, as shown in Fig. 19, a<br>
wall (in the example shown in the figure, the bottom wall<br>
21K-6) of the first carrying chamber can be interposed<br>
between the K developer 900K in the first carrying chamber<br>
and the K toner concentration sensor 45K. Then, it is<br>
necessary to press the K developer 900K strongly against<br>
the wall, which is interposed between the K developer 900K<br>
and the K toner concentration sensor 45K, by a rotation<br>
force of the first screw member 26K.<br>
A characteristic structure of the copying machine<br>
according to this embodiment is explained.<br>
Fig. 20 is a cross sectional view of the developer<br>
carrying device 22K for K. In the figure, the first<br>
carrying chamber including the first screw member 26K has a<br>
pressing wall 39K. The pressing wall 39K is provided at<br>
least in a part of the entire area of the first carrying<br>
chamber as the developer carrying unit. Specifically, the<br>
pressing wall 39K is provided in an area opposed to the<br>
bottom wall 21K-6 of the first carrying chamber on the<br><br>
lower side in the gravity direction of the first screw<br>
member 26K and opposed to the side walls (the left side<br>
plate 21K-3 and the partition wall 21K-5) of the first<br>
carrying chamber on both lateral sides orthogonal to the<br>
rotation axis direction of the first screw member 26K. In<br>
the area, the K toner concentration of the K developer<br>
being carried is detected by the K toner concentration<br>
sensor 45K (e.g., an area indicated by an alternate long<br>
and short dash line X in Fig. 12).<br>
As shown in Fig. 20, the pressing wall 39K is laid<br>
over between the left side plate 21K-3 and the partition<br>
wall 21k-5 of the first carrying chamber and covers the<br>
first carrying chamber from above. A curved surface along<br>
a curvature of the spiral blade 28K is formed on a surface<br>
of the pressing wall 39K opposed to the first screw member<br>
26K. Such a pressing wall 39K comes into contact with,<br>
from above in the vertical direction, the K developer 900K<br>
moving upward from the lower side in the gravity direction<br>
according to the rotation of the first screw member 26K and<br>
presses the K developer 900K downward in the vertical<br>
direction. The pressing wall 39K pushes out the K<br>
developer 900K present in a spiral space of the first screw<br>
member 26K in a rotation radial direction of the first<br>
screw member 26K while compressing the K developer 900K.<br>
Then, a part of the K developer 900K stored in the spiral<br>
space of the first screw member 26K is pushed out into the<br>
clearance between the outer edge of the spiral blade 28K<br>
and the bottom wall 21K-6 of the first carrying chamber to<br>
press the K developer 900K present near the detection<br>
surface of the K toner concentration sensor 45K strongly to<br>
the sensor. Therefore, misdetection of a toner<br>
concentration due to fluctuation in a volume of the toner<br>
can be further reduced than in the past by pressing the K<br><br>
developer 900K strongly against the detection surface of<br>
the K toner concentration sensor 45K.<br>
The copying machine includes a reverse carrying blade<br>
29K in the first screw member 26K in addition to the<br>
pressing wall 39K in the first carrying chamber to further<br>
reduce misdetection of a toner concentration due to<br>
fluctuation in a volume of the toner. Specifically, Fig.<br>
21 is an enlarged side view of a part of the first screw<br>
member 26K for K in the copying machine. In the figure, a<br>
rotation shaft member 27K is driven to rotate in an arrow B<br>
direction in the figure. The spiral blade 28K is<br>
protrudingly provided on the peripheral surface of the<br>
rotation shaft member 27K to have a slope with an angle 01<br>
with respect to the rotation axis direction of the rotation<br>
shaft member 27K (an extending direction of a line L1).<br>
There are four angles formed by the line L1 and a line L3<br>
extending in the direction of the spiral blade 28K on the<br>
peripheral surface of the rotation shaft member 27K. Among<br>
the four angles, each two angles are the same angles<br>
because the angles are vertical angles. Thus, there are<br>
two angles formed by crossing of the line L1 and the line<br>
L3. An angle 61 represents a smaller one of these angles<br>
(92 described later is the same).<br>
In the spiral blade 28K of the first screw member 26K,<br>
the reverse carrying blade 29K is protrudingly provided on<br>
the peripheral surface of the rotation shaft member 27K<br>
between two opposed surfaces that face the rotation axis<br>
direction (the extending direction of the line L1). An<br>
extending direction of the reverse carrying blade 2 9K (an<br>
extending direction of a line L4) on the peripheral surface<br>
of the rotation shaft member 27K has the inclination<br>
opposite to that of the spiral blade 28K with respect to<br><br>
the extending direction of the line L1. An angle of the<br>
inclination is 62.<br>
The spiral blade 28K carries the not-shown K developer<br>
in an arrow D direction in the figure along the rotation<br>
axis direction according to the rotation around the<br>
rotation shaft member 27K. On the other hand, the reverse<br>
carrying blade 2 9K carries the K developer in an arrow C<br>
direction opposite to the carrying direction of the spiral<br>
blade 28K according to the rotation around the rotation<br>
shaft member 27K. The reverse carrying blade 29K is<br>
protrudingly provided in a section of the rotation shaft<br>
member 27K in an area, a lower side in the gravity<br>
direction of which is opposed to the bottom wall of the<br>
first carrying chamber (21K-6 in Fig. 19) as the developer<br>
carrying unit and both lateral sides orthogonal to the<br>
rotation axis direction of which are opposed to the<br>
sidewalls of the first carrying chamber (21K-3 and 21K-5 in<br>
Fig. 19), respectively, in the entire area in the rotation<br>
axis direction in the first screw member 26K. Although the<br>
reverse carrying blade 29K is not shown in Figs. 18 and 19<br>
for convenience of illustration, the K toner concentration<br>
sensor 45K is disposed to detect the K toner concentration<br>
of the K developer carried between the reverse carrying<br>
blade 29K and a spiral blade section (a section extending<br>
along the line L3 in Fig. 21) adjacent to the reverse<br>
carrying blade 29K.<br>
The K developer carried to the reverse carrying blade<br>
29K and the K developer carried to the spiral blade section<br>
adjacent to the reverse carrying blade 29K (a reverse<br>
carrying blade adjacent section) bump into each other<br>
between the reverse carrying blade 29K and the reverse<br>
carrying blade adjacent section. Consequently, the K<br>
developer is pushed out in the normal direction. The K<br><br>
developer present near the detection surface of the toner<br>
concentration sensor 45K in the clearance between the outer<br>
edge of the first screw member 26K and the bottom wall<br>
(21K-6) of the first carrying chamber is pressed strongly<br>
to the detection surface. According to the increase in the<br>
pressing force by the reverse carrying blade 29K and the<br>
increase in the pressing force by the pressing wall 39,<br>
misdetection of a toner concentration due to fluctuation in<br>
a volume of the toner is further reduced. Further, the<br>
developer near the detection surface is actively replaced<br>
by retracting the developer from the detection surface<br>
while being pressed strongly against the detection surface<br>
according to the rotation of the reverse carrying blade 29K.<br>
Consequently, it is possible to further reduce misdetection<br>
of a toner concentration due to the fluctuation in a volume<br>
of the toner by preventing the developer from staying near<br>
the detection surface and always supplying a new developer<br>
to the detection surface.<br>
Two opposed surfaces in the spiral blade 28K opposed<br>
to each other across the reverse carrying blade 29K are not<br>
connected to the reverse carrying blade 29K. Gaps are<br>
formed between the opposed surfaces and the reverse<br>
carrying blade 29K. Therefore, a part of the K developers<br>
that bump into each other because of the opposite movements<br>
between the reverse carrying blade 29K and the reverse<br>
carrying blade adjacent section of the spiral blade 28K is<br>
carried along the spiral space while passing through the<br>
gaps as shown in Fig. 22.<br>
Fig. 23 is a graph of a relation between a toner<br>
concentration conversion value [wt%] of the toner<br>
concentration sensor output Vt [V] and an idle agitation<br>
time [min] at the time when the K developer having a K<br>
toner concentration of 8 [wt%] is idly agitated. It is<br><br>
seen from the graph that an amount of misdetection of a<br>
toner concentration is reduced when the first screw member<br>
including the reverse carrying blade is used. It is also<br>
seen that, when the reverse carrying blade is provided, a<br>
lower toner concentration can be detected when a pressing<br>
wall is provided than when the pressing wall is not<br>
provided. Moreover, it is seen that, when the reverse<br>
carrying blade 29K is provided in addition to the pressing<br>
wall 39K, toner densities of substantially the same values<br>
continue to be detected from immediately after the start of<br>
the idle agitation until 120 minutes passes. This is<br>
because misdetection of a toner concentration due to a<br>
change in a bulk volume of the developer is substantially<br>
eliminated. For reference, a relation between the toner<br>
concentration sensor output Vt [V] and the toner<br>
concentration [wt%] is shown in Fig. 24.<br>
In experiments in which the data in Figs. 23 and 24<br>
are acquired, a screw member described below is used as the<br>
first screw member. A disposing pitch in the screw<br>
rotation axis direction of the spiral blade is 25 [mm], an<br>
inclination angle 92 from the axial direction of the<br>
reverse carrying blade is 45 [°] , and a projection height<br>
from a rotation shaft member surface of the reverse<br>
carrying blade is the same as the height of the spiral<br>
blade. The reverse carrying blade of the first screw<br>
member is connected to a blade of the spiral blade, a<br>
downstream end in the developer carrying direction of which<br>
is adjacent to the reverse carrying blade on a downstream<br>
side in the developer carrying direction, between blades of<br>
the spiral blade as shown in Fig. 26. On the other hand, a<br>
gap is provided as shown in the figure between an upstream<br>
end in the developer carrying direction of the reverse<br>
carrying blade and a blade of the spiral blade adjacent to<br><br>
the reverse carrying blade on an upstream side in the<br>
developer carrying direction. The developer in the first<br>
screw member is carried while passing through this gap. As<br>
the toner concentration sensor, a toner concentration<br>
sensor, a diameter of a detection surface of which is 5<br>
[mm], is used. The toner concentration sensor is disposed<br>
to place the center of the detection surface in a position<br>
opposed to an intersection point of the line L3 and the<br>
line L4 in Fig. 21. As the pressing wall (e.g., 39K), a<br>
pressing wall, a length in the screw axis direction (a<br>
length in the developer carrying direction) of which is 25<br>
[mm], and that covers the entire ceiling of the first<br>
carrying chamber and covers only a part of the area in the<br>
developer carrying direction of the first carrying chamber<br>
as shown in Fig. 20 is used. Experiments were carried out<br>
under the same conditions except the inclination angle 92<br>
when data in Fig. 25 was acquired.<br>
In Fig. 20, as the angle 92 with respect to the line<br>
L2 of the reverse carrying blade 29K is set closer to 45<br>
[°], a developer carrying ability in the arrow C direction<br>
by the reverse carrying blade 2 9K can be improved. When<br>
the angle 92 is set smaller than 45 [°] , as the angle 92 is<br>
set smaller, a developer carrying ability in the rotating<br>
direction is improved at the cost of the low developer<br>
carrying ability in the arrow C direction. When the angle<br>
92 is set to 0 [°] , the developer carrying ability in the<br>
rotating direction is the highest. In the experiments<br>
carried out by the inventors, an amount of misdetection of<br>
a toner concentration could be further reduced when the<br>
reverse carrying blade 29K was provided at the angle 92<br>
larger than 0 [°] than when the angle 92 was set to 0 [°]<br>
(the developer could be pressed more strongly on the<br><br>
detection surface of the toner concentration sensor). When<br>
the angle 62 was set to 45 [°] , i.e., when the developer<br>
carrying ability in the arrow C direction was the highest,<br>
an amount of misdetection of a toner concentration could be<br>
reduced most. For reference, characteristics of toner<br>
concentration conversion values of sensor outputs at the<br>
angle 62 of 45 [°] , 20 [°] , and 0 [°] are shown in Fig. 25.<br>
As shown in Fig. 22, gaps are provided between the two<br>
opposed surfaces of the spiral blade 28K and the reverse<br>
carrying blade 29K, respectively. The not-shown K<br>
developer stored between the opposed surfaces smoothly<br>
moves along the spiral space while passing through the gap.<br>
It is not always necessary to provide the gaps between the<br>
two opposed surfaces and the reverse carrying blade 29K.<br>
However, it is desirable to at least provide a gap between<br>
one opposed surface and the reverse carrying blade 29K as<br>
shown in Figs. 26 and 27. This is because, when the two<br>
opposed surfaces are bridged by the reverse carrying blade<br>
29K as shown in Fig. 28, the conveyance of the K developer<br>
in the regular direction (the arrow D direction in the<br>
figure) along the rotation axis direction is considerably<br>
hindered by the reverse carrying blade 29K to clog the<br>
section below the pressing wall 39K with the K developer.<br>
For reference, detection characteristics of a toner<br>
concentration at the time when the gaps are provided<br>
between the two opposed surfaces and the reverse carrying<br>
blade 2 9K and at the time when the two opposed surfaces are<br>
bridged by the reverse carrying blade 29K are shown in Fig.<br>
29. Only from the viewpoint of pressing the developer<br>
strongly against the toner concentration sensor to reduce<br>
an amount of misdetection of a toner concentration, it is<br>
preferable to bridge the two opposed surfaces with the<br>
reverse carrying blade 29K as shown in the figure. However,<br><br>
when the two opposed surfaces were bridged and a continuous<br>
print operation was actually performed, the section below<br>
the pressing wall is clogged with the developer immediately<br>
after the supply of the toner.<br>
In the experiments in which the data in Fig. 29 is<br>
acquired, a screw member described below is used as the<br>
first screw member having the reverse carrying blade. A<br>
disposing pitch in the screw rotation axis direction of the<br>
spiral blade is 25 [mm], an inclination angle G2 from the<br>
axial direction of the reverse carrying blade is 45 [°] ,<br>
and a projection height from a rotation shaft member<br>
surface of the reverse carrying blade is the same as the<br>
height of the spiral blade. The reverse carrying blade of<br>
the first screw member is joined to the spiral blade at<br>
both an upstream end and a downstream end in a slightly<br>
twisted shape as shown in Fig. 31. Alternatively, as shown<br>
in Fig. 26, a gap is formed between the downstream end in<br>
the developer carrying direction and the spiral blade. As<br>
the toner concentration sensor, a toner concentration<br>
sensor, a diameter of a detection surface of which is 5<br>
[mm], is used. The toner concentration sensor is disposed<br>
to place the center of the detection surface in a position<br>
opposed to the intersection point of the line L3 and the<br>
line L4 in Fig. 21. As the pressing wall (e.g., 39K), a<br>
pressing wall, a length in the screw axis direction (a<br>
length in the developer carrying direction) of which is 25<br>
[mm], and that covers the entire ceiling of the first<br>
carrying chamber and covers only a part of the area in the<br>
developer carrying direction of the first carrying chamber<br>
is used.<br>
As the reverse carrying blade 29K, besides the reverse<br>
carrying blade 29K of the shape shown in Fig. 22, the<br>
reverse carrying blade 29K of a flat rectangular shape (a<br><br>
tabular shape) shown in Fig. 30, the reverse carrying blade<br>
29K of a twisted shape shown in Fig. 31, the reverse<br>
carrying blade 29K of a shape hollowed toward the moving<br>
direction of the K developer (an arrow E direction in the<br>
figure) in the spiral space (a curved shape) shown in Fig.<br>
32, or the like can be adopted. A parallel fin and a<br>
forward direction fin as blade members described later can<br>
also be fins of the tabular shape, the twisted shape, or<br>
the curved shape.<br>
As shown in Figs. 19 and 20, the toner concentration<br>
sensor (e.g., 45K) is disposed to detect a toner<br>
concentration of a developer further below in the gravity<br>
direction than the rotation axis center of the first screw<br>
member 26K as the agitating and carrying member (the center<br>
of the rotation shaft member 27K). In the first carrying<br>
chamber in which the first screw member 26K is housed, a<br>
developer storage quantity in the developer carrying<br>
direction slightly fluctuates over time. Thus, a developer<br>
surface (an upper surface level) of the developer also<br>
fluctuates slightly in a certain degree of range. In such<br>
a first carrying chamber, when the toner concentration<br>
sensor 45K is dispose to detect a toner concentration of a<br>
developer further above in the gravity direction than the<br>
center of the rotation shaft member 27K, it is likely that<br>
timing for locating the developer surface below the sensor<br>
is generated. When the developer surface is located below<br>
the sensor, more significant misdetection occurs because<br>
the toner concentration cannot be detected. On the other<br>
hand, when the toner concentration sensor 45K is disposed<br>
to detect a toner concentration of a developer further<br>
below in the gravity direction than the center of the<br>
rotation shaft member 27K, occurrence of such misdetection<br>
can be prevented. This is because, even if the developer<br><br>
storage quantity fluctuates in the first carrying chamber,<br>
the developer surface of the developer does not fall below<br>
the center of the rotation shaft member 27K.<br>
In Fig. 20, the first screw member 26K is shown from a<br>
side on which the first screw member 26K looks rotating in<br>
the counterclockwise direction. When the first screw<br>
member 2 6K and a peripheral structure thereof are seen from<br>
such a side, the pressing wall 39K is disposed from a<br>
position of a first quadrant (upper right of the screw) to<br>
a position of a second quadrant (upper left of the screw)<br>
to cover the entire area in the width direction of the<br>
first carrying chamber. The toner concentration sensor 45K<br>
is disposed in a position of a fourth quadrant around the<br>
screw (lower right of the screw).<br>
As shown in Fig. 36, the toner concentration sensor<br>
45K can be disposed in a position of a third quadrant<br>
(lower left of the screw) instead of the fourth quadrant<br>
(lower right of the screw). In the position of the fourth<br>
quadrant, as explained with reference to Fig. 20, the<br>
developer is moved from the lower side to the upper side in<br>
the gravity direction according to the rotation of the<br>
reverse carrying blade 29K. On the other hand, the<br>
developer is pressed downward in the gravity direction by<br>
the pressing wall 39K to be pushed out in the rotation<br>
radius direction (the normal direction) of the first screw<br>
member 26K while being compressed. Consequently, in the<br>
fourth quadrant, the developer present near the detection<br>
surface of the toner concentration sensor 45K in the<br>
clearance between the outer edge of the first screw member<br>
26K and the bottom wall 21K-6 of the first carrying chamber<br>
is pressed strongly to the detection surface. In Fig. 36,<br>
the third quadrant is adjacent to the fourth quadrant on<br>
the upstream side in the developer carrying direction. In<br><br>
such a third quadrant, a pressing force on the developer<br>
generated in the fourth quadrant is propagated from the<br>
fourth quadrant. Thus, the developer present near the<br>
detection surface of the toner concentration sensor 45K in<br>
the clearance is pressed to the detection surface with a<br>
pressing force weaker than that in the fourth quadrant.<br>
This makes it possible to prevent occurrence of<br>
misdetection of a toner concentration. However, a return<br>
force by the pressing wall 39K acting on the developer is<br>
larger in the third quadrant. Whereas the developer is<br>
about to move downward in the gravity direction with an own<br>
weight thereof, the reverse carrying blade 29K is about to<br>
lift the developer in the opposite direction. As a result,<br>
the pressing force of the developer against the detection<br>
surface becomes larger. Therefore, an amount of<br>
misdetection of a toner concentration can be further<br>
reduced.<br>
As described above, in the form shown in Fig. 20, the<br>
toner concentration sensor 45K is disposed in the fourth<br>
quadrant to detect a toner concentration of the developer<br>
that is given a downward pressing force from above in the<br>
gravity direction by the pressing wall 39 while moving<br>
upward from below in the gravity direction according to the<br>
rotation of the first screw member 26K. Therefore, an<br>
amount of misdetection of a toner concentration can be<br>
further reduced than when the toner concentration sensor<br>
45K is disposed in the third quadrant in which the<br>
developer is moved downward from above in the gravity<br>
direction according to the rotation of the first screw<br>
member 26K.<br>
In the copying machine, the pressing wall 39K is<br>
provided only in a part of the entire area in the developer<br>
carrying direction in the first carrying chamber as the<br><br>
developer carrying unit. Specifically, the pressing wall<br>
39K is provided only in the area where the reverse carrying<br>
blade 29K is provided in the first screw member 26K in the<br>
entire area of the first carrying chamber. When a pressure<br>
of the developer considerably rises right below the<br>
pressing wall 39K, it is possible to cause the developer<br>
present further on the upstream side in the developer<br>
carrying direction than the pressing wall 39K to flow over<br>
the pressing wall 39 according to the increase in the<br>
pressure and behave to prevent a further increase in the<br>
pressure. This makes it possible to prevent the section<br>
right below the pressing wall 39K from being clogged with<br>
the developer. On the other hand, if the entire area in<br>
the developer carrying direction is covered with the<br>
pressing wall 39K, it is likely that clogging of the<br>
section right below the pressing wall 39K by the developer<br>
occurs.<br>
As shown in Figs. 20 and 36, the entire area around<br>
the first screw member 26K does not always have to be<br>
filled with the developer right below the pressing wall 39K.<br>
As shown in Fig. 37, a developer storage quantity can be<br>
only enough for filling the clearance between the screw and<br>
the pressing wall 39K except the second quadrant (upper<br>
left of the screw) among the four quadrants. Even if the<br>
developer storage quantity is relatively small in this way,<br>
if the clearance in -the first quadrant (upper right of the<br>
screw) is filled with the developer, a return force by the<br>
pressing wall 39K is given to the developer moved upward<br>
from below in the gravity direction in the first quadrant.<br>
This makes it possible to press the developer strongly to<br>
the detection surface of the toner concentration sensor 45K<br>
in the fourth quadrant (lower right of the screw) and the<br>
third quadrant (lower left of the screw).<br><br>
It is not always necessary to provide the pressing<br>
wall 39K to cover the entire area in the width direction of<br>
the first carrying chamber. This is because, if the<br>
pressing wall 39K is disposed to cover at least the first<br>
quadrant (upper right of the screw) as shown in Fig. 38,<br>
the developer can be pressed strongly to the detection<br>
surface of the toner concentration sensor 45K in the third<br>
quadrant (lower left of the screw) and the fourth quadrant<br>
(lower right of the screw).<br>
An amount of projection L6 of the reverse carrying<br>
blade 29K in the normal direction from the peripheral<br>
surface of the rotation shaft member 27K is set larger than<br>
an amount of projection L5 of the spiral blade 28K in the<br>
normal direction from the peripheral surface of the<br>
rotation shaft member 27K. The tip of the reverse carrying<br>
blade 29K that has moved to the position opposed to the K<br>
toner concentration sensor 45K according to the rotation of<br>
the first screw member 26K is brought closer to the sensor<br>
than the tip of the spiral blade 28K to press the K<br>
developer more strongly to the sensor than when the amount<br>
of projection L6 is set equal to or smaller than the amount<br>
of projection L5. This makes it possible to reduce an<br>
amount of misdetection of a K toner concentration.<br>
Fig. 34 is a graph of a relation between the toner<br>
concentration sensor output Vt [V] during idle agitation<br>
and an idle agitation time [s]. As shown in the figure,<br>
the relation between the toner concentration sensor output<br>
Vt and the idle agitation time is a waveform of a sine<br>
curve shape. This is because a pressing force of the<br>
developer applied to the toner concentration sensor 45K is<br>
the largest when the reverse carrying blade 29K of the<br>
first screw member 26K passes the area opposed to the toner<br>
concentration sensor 45K according to the rotation of the<br><br>
reverse carrying blade 29K. When a pressure sensor is<br>
attached instead of the K toner concentration detection<br>
sensor 45K in the developer carrying device 22K for K, a<br>
relation between the K toner concentration sensor output Vt<br>
and an elapsed time is also a waveform of a sine curve<br>
shape like the waveform shown in the figure. A period of<br>
the waveform is the same as a period of the waveform in Fig.<br>
34. At timing when the reverse carrying blade 29K passes<br>
the position opposed to the K toner concentration sensor<br>
45K according to the rotation of the first screw member 26K,<br>
the toner concentration sensor output Vt is the highest (a<br>
max point of the sine curve) and a K toner concentration is<br>
accurately detected.<br>
In the copying machine that shows such detection<br>
characteristics, when the toner concentration sensor output<br>
Vt at timing at a lower limit point of the sine curve is<br>
adopted for toner concentration control or the toner<br>
concentration sensor output Vt at timing at an upper limit<br>
point is adopted for toner concentration control, accurate<br>
toner concentration control is difficult because an amount<br>
of misdetection fluctuates. Thus, in the copying machine,<br>
the control unit 500 as the control means acquires the<br>
toner concentration sensor output Vt a plurality of number<br>
of times in a predetermined period and, then, extracts, out<br>
of results of the detection, results having values higher<br>
than an average in a plurality of detection results and<br>
controls driving of the toner supplying unit based on a<br>
result of the extraction. Therefore, a toner concentration<br>
can be more accurately controlled than when the toner<br>
concentration sensor output Vt at an upper limit time or a<br>
lower limit time is adopted at random.<br>
Fig. 35 is a flowchart of a toner concentration<br>
control processing carried out by the control unit 500. In<br><br>
the figure, a flow of toner concentration control<br>
processing for only one color is shown. However, in actual<br>
use, the same toner concentration control processing is<br>
carried out in parallel for the respective colors of Y, C,<br>
M, and K. In the figure, first, a predetermined number of<br>
toner concentration sensor output Vt are sampled at<br>
predetermined intervals at predetermined timing (step S21).<br>
After calculating an average Vt_ave of sampling data of the<br>
sampling (step S22), the control unit 500 extracts only the<br>
toner concentration sensor outputs Vt larger than the<br>
average Vt_ave among the sampled toner concentration sensor<br>
outputs Vt (step S23). After recalculating an average of<br>
only the extracted data (step S24), the control unit 500<br>
drives the toner supplying unit for a time corresponding to<br>
a recalculation result Vt_ave' to supply the toner (step<br>
S25).<br>
In the example explained above, the left side plate<br>
21K-3 and the partition wall 21K-5 of the first carrying<br>
chamber is bridged by the pressing wall 39K. However, it<br>
is not always necessary to bridge the left side plate 21K-3<br>
and the partition wall 21K-5. If it is possible to bring<br>
the pressing wall 39K into contact with the K developer,<br>
which moves from the lower side to the upper side in the<br>
gravity direction according to the rotation of the first<br>
screw member 26K, from above in the gravity direction, the<br>
pressing wall 39K may be partially provided between the<br>
left side plate 21K-3 and the partition wall 21K-5. The<br>
developer carrying device 22K for K has been explained.<br>
However, the developer carrying devices for the other<br>
colors have structures same as that of the developer<br>
carrying device 22K for K.<br>
Modifications of the copying machine according to the<br>
embodiment are explained below. Unless specifically noted<br><br>
otherwise, structures of copying machines according to the<br>
modifications are the same as that in the embodiment.<br>
Fig. 39 is an enlarged side view of a part of the<br>
first screw member 26K in a developing device for K of a<br>
copying machine according to a first modification. In the<br>
first screw member 26K, a parallel fin 31K as a blade<br>
member is protrudingly provided on the peripheral surface<br>
of the rotation shaft member 27K instead of the reverse<br>
carrying blade. The parallel fin 31K is protrudingly<br>
provided on the peripheral surface of the rotation shaft<br>
member 27K in a posture extending in the axial direction of<br>
the rotation shaft member 27K. The parallel fin 31K moves<br>
a developer in the normal direction (the rotation radius<br>
direction) of the first screw member 26K according to the<br>
rotation of the parallel fin 31K. This makes it possible<br>
to press the developer strongly to a detection surface of a<br>
not-shown toner concentration sensor. Moreover, the<br>
developer present near the detection surface is actively<br>
replaced by retracting the developer from the detection<br>
surface while being pressed strongly against the detection<br>
surface according to the rotation of the parallel fin 31K.<br>
As a result, misdetection of a toner concentration due to<br>
fluctuation in a volume of the toner can be reduced.<br>
Fig. 40 is a graph of a relation between a toner<br>
concentration conversion value [wt%] of the toner<br>
concentration sensor output Vt [V] and an idle agitation<br>
time [min] at the time when a K developer having a K toner<br>
concentration of 8 [wt%] is idly agitated in the first<br>
screw member 2 6K shown in Fig. 39. As shown in the figure,<br>
it is seen that an amount of error detection of a toner<br>
concentration increases according to an increase in the<br>
idle agitation time when a first screw member including a<br>
parallel fin is used and a pressing wall is not provided,<br><br>
when the first screw member not including the parallel fin<br>
is used and the pressing wall is not provided, and when the<br>
first screw member not including the parallel fin is used<br>
and the pressing wall is provided. On the other hand, it<br>
is seen that toner densities of substantially the same<br>
values continue to be detected until 120 minutes passes<br>
from immediately after the start of idle agitation when the<br>
first screw member including the parallel fin is used and<br>
the pressing wall is provided. In view of this<br>
experimental result, in the developing device according to<br>
the first modification, the first screw member 26K<br>
including the parallel fin 31K is used and the pressing<br>
wall is provided in the first carrying chamber.<br>
For reference, a relation between the toner<br>
concentration sensor output Vt [V] and a toner<br>
concentration [wt%] is shown in Fig. 41. When the pressing<br>
wall is not provided, the developer moved upward from below<br>
in the gravity direction according to the rotation of the<br>
first screw member is not pushed back downward in the<br>
gravity direction. Therefore, the developer is not pressed<br>
in the clearance and an amount of error detection of a<br>
toner concentration is larger than when the pressing wall<br>
is provided.<br>
In experiments in which the data in Figs. 4 0 and 41<br>
are acquired, a screw member described below is used as the<br>
first screw member. A disposing pitch in the screw<br>
rotation axis direction of the spiral blade is 25 [mm] and<br>
a projection height from the surface of the rotation shaft<br>
member of the parallel fin is the same as that of the<br>
spiral blade. The parallel fin of the first screw member<br>
is connected to a blade of the spiral blade, a downstream<br>
end in the developer carrying direction of which is<br>
adjacent to the parallel fin on a downstream side in the<br><br>
developer carrying direction, between blades of the spiral<br>
blade as shown in Fig. 39. On the other hand, a gap is<br>
provided as shown in the figure between an upstream end in<br>
the developer carrying direction of the parallel fin and a<br>
blade of the spiral blade adjacent to the parallel fin on<br>
an upstream side in the developer carrying direction. The<br>
developer in the first screw member is carried while<br>
passing through this gap. As the toner concentration<br>
sensor, a toner concentration sensor, a diameter of a<br>
detection surface of which is 5 [mm], is used. The toner<br>
concentration sensor is disposed to place the center of the<br>
detection surface in a position opposed to the center in<br>
the rotation axis direction of the parallel fin. As the<br>
pressing wall (e.g., 39K), a pressing wall, a length in the<br>
screw axis direction (a length in the developer carrying<br>
direction) of which is 25 [mm], and that covers the entire<br>
ceiling of the first carrying chamber and covers only a<br>
part of the area in the developer carrying direction of the<br>
first carrying chamber as shown in Fig. 20 is used.<br>
As described already, the parallel fin can be a flat<br>
rectangular fin, a twisted fin shown in Fig. 30, a hollow<br>
fin, a fin, Mylar, or a fin with Mylar integral with the<br>
rotation shaft member or the spiral blade, and the like.<br>
Fig. 42 is an enlarged side view of a part of a second<br>
example of the first screw member 26K in the developing<br>
device for K of the copying machine according to the first<br>
modification. The parallel fin 31K in the first screw<br>
member 26K in the second example is connected to a blade of<br>
the spiral blade, an upstream end in the developer carrying<br>
direction of which is adjacent to the parallel fin 31K on<br>
an upstream side in the developer carrying direction,<br>
between blades of the parallel fin 31K. On the other hand,<br>
a gap is provided as shown in the figure between a<br><br>
downstream end in the developer carrying direction of the<br>
parallel fin 31K and a blade of the spiral blade adjacent<br>
to the parallel fin 31K on a downstream side in the<br>
developer carrying direction. The developer in the first<br>
screw member is carried while passing through this gap.<br>
Therefore, the developer can be actively replaced near the<br>
detection surface of the toner concentration sensor while<br>
being pressed strongly to the toner concentration sensor<br>
according to the rotation of the parallel fin 31K.<br>
Fig. 43 is an enlarged side view of a part of a third<br>
example of the first screw member 26K in the developing<br>
device for K of the copying machine according to the first<br>
modification. The parallel fin 31K in the first screw<br>
member 2 6K in the third example is connected to the spiral<br>
blade 28K at both an upstream end and a downstream end in<br>
the developer carrying direction between blades of the<br>
spiral blade 28K and bridges the blades of the spiral blade<br>
28K. Therefore, the developer can be actively replaced<br>
near the detection surface of the toner concentration<br>
sensor while being pressed strongly to the toner<br>
concentration sensor according to the rotation of the<br>
parallel fin 31K.<br>
Fig. 44 is an enlarged side view of a part of a fourth<br>
example of the first screw member 26K in the developing<br>
device for K of the copying machine according to the first<br>
modification. At both an upstream end and a downstream end<br>
in the developer carrying direction of the parallel fin 31K<br>
in the first screw member 26K in the fourth example, gaps<br>
are formed between the upstream end and the downstream end<br>
and the spiral blade. The developer is carried while<br>
passing through the gaps. Therefore, the developer can be<br>
actively replaced near the detection surface of the toner<br>
concentration sensor while being pressed strongly to the<br><br>
toner concentration sensor according to the rotation of the<br>
parallel fin 31K.<br>
Fig. 45 is an enlarged side view of a part of the<br>
first screw member 26K in a developing device for K of a<br>
copying machine according to a second modification. In the<br>
first screw member 26K, a forward carrying fin 31K' is<br>
protrudingly provided on the peripheral surface of the<br>
rotation shaft member 27K instead of the reverse carrying<br>
blade. The forward carrying fin 31K' bridges blades of the<br>
spiral blade 28K. An inclination angle 03 thereof is<br>
smaller than the inclination angle 91 of the spiral blade<br>
28K (0°
at such an inclination angle 03 carries a developer at<br>
speed higher than that of the spiral blade 28K in a<br>
direction relatively the same as that of the spiral blade<br>
28K.<br>
Between the forward carrying fin 31K' and the spiral<br>
blade 28K, the forward carrying fin 31K' superior in the<br>
developer carrying speed presses the developer against the<br>
surface (a surface indicated by S1 in the figure) of the<br>
spiral blade 28K inferior in the developer carrying speed.<br>
A part of the developer pressed against the surface of the<br>
spiral blade 28K moves in the normal direction of the first<br>
screw member 26K along the surface of the spiral blade 28K.<br>
The part of the developer flows to the outside of the first<br>
screw member 26K and is pressed strongly against a<br>
detection surface of a not-shown toner concentration sensor.<br>
Consequently, the developer present near the detection<br>
surface of the toner concentration sensor is pressed<br>
strongly to the detection surface. The developer is<br>
retracted from the detection surface while being pressed<br>
strongly against the detection surface according to the<br><br>
rotation of the forward carrying fin 31K' to actively<br>
replace the developer present near the detection surface.<br>
As a result, misdetection of a toner concentration due to<br>
fluctuation in a volume of a toner can be further reduced<br>
than in the past.<br>
There are four angles formed by the line L1 extending<br>
in the rotation axis direction of the first screw member<br>
26K and a line L7 extending in an extending direction of<br>
the forward carrying fin 31K' on the peripheral surface of<br>
the rotation shaft member 27K. Among the four angles, each<br>
two angles are the same angles because the angles are<br>
vertical angles. Thus, there are two angles formed by<br>
crossing of the line L1 and the line L7. An angle 63<br>
represents a smaller one of these angles. The angle 63 of<br>
the forward carrying fin 31K' does not always have to<br>
satisfy the condition "0°
takes a value with which the developer can be pressed<br>
against the pressing wall.<br>
Fig. 46 is an enlarged side view of a part of a second<br>
example of the first screw member 26K in the developing<br>
device for K of the copying machine according to the second<br>
modification. The forward carrying fin 31K' in the first<br>
screw member 26K in the second example is connected to a<br>
blade of a spiral blade, a downstream end in the developer<br>
carrying direction of which is adjacent to the forward<br>
carrying fin 31K' on a downstream side in the developer<br>
carrying direction, between blades of the spiral blade 28K.<br>
On the other hand, a gap is provided as shown in the figure<br>
between an upstream end in the developer carrying direction<br>
of the forward carrying fin 31K' and a blade of the spiral<br>
blade adjacent to the forward carrying fin 31K' on an<br>
upstream side in the developer carrying direction. The<br><br>
developer in the first screw member is carried while<br>
passing through this gap. Therefore, the developer can be<br>
actively replaced near the detection surface of the toner<br>
concentration sensor while being pressed strongly to the<br>
toner concentration sensor according to the rotation of the<br>
forward carrying fin 31K'.<br>
Fig. 47 is an enlarged side view of a part of a third<br>
example of the first screw member 26K in the developing<br>
device for K of the copying machine according to the second<br>
modification. The forward carrying fin 31K' in the first<br>
screw member 26K in the third example is connected to a<br>
blade of a spiral blade, a downstream end in the developer<br>
carrying direction of which is adjacent to the forward<br>
carrying fin 31K' on a downstream side in the developer<br>
carrying direction, between blades of the spiral blade 28K.<br>
On the other hand, a gap is provided as shown in the figure<br>
between a downstream end in the developer carrying<br>
direction of the forward carrying fin 31K' and a blade of<br>
the spiral blade adjacent to the forward carrying fin 31K'<br>
on a downstream side in the developer carrying direction.<br>
The developer in the first screw member is carried while<br>
passing through this gap. Therefore, the developer can be<br>
actively replaced near the detection surface of the toner<br>
concentration sensor while being pressed strongly to the<br>
toner concentration sensor according to the rotation of the<br>
forward carrying fin 31K'.<br>
Fig. 48 is an enlarged side view of a part of a fourth<br>
example of the first screw member 26K in the developing<br>
device for K of the copying machine according to the second<br>
modification. At both an upstream end and a downstream end<br>
in the developer carrying direction of the forward carrying<br>
fin 31K' in the first screw member 26K in the fourth<br>
example, gaps are formed between the upstream end and the<br><br>
downstream end and the spiral blade. The developer is<br>
carried while passing through the gaps. Therefore, the<br>
developer can be actively replaced near the detection<br>
surface of the toner concentration sensor while being<br>
pressed strongly to the toner concentration sensor<br>
according to the rotation of the forward carrying fin 31K'.<br>
As described already, the parallel fin can be a flat<br>
rectangular fin, a twisted fin shown in Fig. 30, a hollow<br>
fin, a fin, Mylar, or a fin with Mylar integral with the<br>
rotation shaft member or the spiral blade, and the like.<br>
The toner concentration sensor 45K is disposed to<br>
detect a toner concentration of a developer further below<br>
in the gravity direction than the rotation center of the<br>
first screw member 26K. Therefore, as explained already,<br>
significant misdetection of a toner concentration, which<br>
occurs because a developer surface is located below the<br>
toner concentration sensor, can be prevented from occurring.<br>
Moreover, the toner concentration sensor 45K is<br>
disposed in the fourth quadrant to detect a toner<br>
concentration of the developer that is given a downward<br>
pressing force from above in the gravity direction by the<br>
pressing wall 39 while moving upward from below in the<br>
gravity direction according to the rotation of the first<br>
screw member 26K. As explained already, an amount of<br>
misdetection of a toner concentration can be further<br>
reduced than when the toner concentration sensor 45K is<br>
disposed in the third quadrant.<br>
The first screw member 26K including the rotatably-<br>
supported rotation shaft member 27K and the spiral blade<br>
28K protrudingly provided in a spiral shape on the<br>
peripheral surface of the rotation shaft member 27K is used<br>
as the agitating and carrying member. The reverse carrying<br>
blade 29K that carries the K developer in the direction<br><br>
opposite to the carrying direction of the spiral blade 28K<br>
according to the rotation of the rotation shaft member 27K<br>
is protrudingly provided in the area opposed to the<br>
pressing wall 39K of the entire area in the rotation axis<br>
direction in the rotation shaft member 27K. As described<br>
above, the pressing force of the K developer against the K<br>
toner concentration sensor 45K is increased by pressing the<br>
K developer with the pressing wall 39K and is also<br>
increased by carrying the K developer in the opposite<br>
direction in the area opposed to the sensor with the<br>
reverse carrying blade 29K. This makes it possible to<br>
further reduce misdetection of a toner concentration due to<br>
fluctuation in a volume of a toner. Moreover, the<br>
developer is retracted from the detection surface while<br>
being pressed strongly against the detection surface<br>
according to the rotation of the reverse carrying blade 29K<br>
to actively replace the developer present near the<br>
detection surface. As a result, an amount of misdetection<br>
of a toner concentration can also be substantially<br>
eliminated.<br>
The screw member including the rotatably-supported<br>
rotation shaft member 27K and the spiral blade 28K<br>
protrudingly provided in a spiral shape on the peripheral<br>
surface of the rotation shaft member 27K is used. The<br>
parallel fin 31K or the forward carrying fin 31K' as the<br>
blade member that moves the developer in the normal<br>
direction according to the rotation of the rotation shaft<br>
member 27K or moves the developer in the direction same as<br>
the direction of carrying by the spiral blade 28K is<br>
protrudingly provided in the area opposed to the pressing<br>
wall 39K in the entire area in the rotation axis direction<br>
in the rotation shaft member 27K. Therefore, the developer<br>
can be actively replaced near the detection surface of the<br><br>
toner concentration sensor while being pressed strongly to<br>
the toner concentration sensor according to the rotation of<br>
the parallel fin 31K or the forward carrying fin 31K'.<br>
The reverse carrying blade 29K is disposed between the<br>
two opposed surfaces opposed in the rotation axis direction<br>
in the spiral blade 28K. The gap is provided between at<br>
least one of the two opposed surfaces and the reverse<br>
carrying blade 29K. As described above, clogging of the<br>
section below the pressing wall 39K by the K developer can<br>
be further prevented than when the gap is not provided.<br>
The amount of projection L6 of the reverse carrying<br>
blade 29K in the normal direction from the peripheral<br>
surface of the rotation shaft member 27K is set larger than<br>
the amount of projection L5 of the spiral blade 28K in the<br>
normal direction from the peripheral surface of the<br>
rotation shaft member 27K. Therefore, an amount of<br>
misdetection of a toner concentration can be further<br>
reduced than when the amount of projection L6 is set equal<br>
to or smaller than the amount of projection L5.<br>
The pressing wall 39K is provided only in a part of<br>
the entire area in the developer carrying direction in the<br>
first carrying chamber. Therefore, as explained above,<br>
clogging of the section right below the pressing wall 39K<br>
by the developer can be prevented.<br>
The control unit 500 acquires results of detection by<br>
the toner concentration sensor as the toner concentration<br>
detecting means a plurality of number of times, then,<br>
extracts only results with values higher than an average in<br>
the acquired results, and controls driving of the toner<br>
supplying unit based on a result of the extraction.<br>
Therefore, as described above, a toner concentration can be<br>
more accurately controlled than when a detection result at<br>
a random point in time is directly adopted.<br><br>
The developer that moves from the lower side to the<br>
upper side in the gravity direction according to the<br>
rotation of the agitating and carrying member is pressed<br>
downward in the gravity direction with the pressing wall to<br>
push out the developer in the agitating and carrying member<br>
in the rotation radius direction of the agitating and<br>
carrying member while compressing the developer. The<br>
developer present near the detection surface of the toner-<br>
concentration detecting unit in the clearance between the<br>
outer edge of the agitating and carrying member and the<br>
wall of the developer carrying unit is pushed strongly to<br>
the detection surface with the developer pushed out in the<br>
rotation radius direction from the inside of the agitating<br>
and carrying member. Misdetection of a toner concentration<br>
due to fluctuation in a volume of a toner can be further<br>
reduced than in the past by pressing the developer strongly<br>
to the detection surface of the toner-concentration<br>
detecting unit in this way.<br>
Although the invention has been described with respect<br>
to specific embodiments for a complete and clear disclosure,<br>
the appended claims are not to be thus limited but are to<br>
be construed as embodying all modifications and alternative<br>
constructions that may occur to one skilled in the art that<br>

number of times, then, extracts results with values higher<br>
than an average in the results of the detection, and<br>
controls driving of the toner supplying unit based on a<br>
result of the extraction.<br><br>
A pressing wall is provided in a part of the entire<br>
area of the first carrying chamber in which a first screw<br>
member is housed. The area is opposed to a bottom wall of<br>
the first carrying chamber on the lower side in the gravity<br>
direction of the first screw member and opposed to the side<br>
walls of the first carrying chamber on both lateral sides<br>
orthogonal to a rotation axis direction of the first screw<br>
member. In the area, a toner concentration of a K<br>
developer being carried is detected by a K toner<br>
concentration sensor. The pressing wall comes into contact<br>
with, from above in the gravity direction, the K developer,<br>
which moves from a lower side to an upper side in the<br>
gravity direction according to the rotation of the first<br>
screw member, and presses the K developer downward in the<br>
gravity direction.</td>
