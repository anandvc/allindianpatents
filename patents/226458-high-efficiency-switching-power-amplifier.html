				<td>HIGH EFFICIENCY SWITCHING POWER AMPLIFIER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to high efficiency power amplifiers and more<br>
particularly to a new class of switching power amplifiers that is a hybrid of class E<br>
and inverse class F (class F-1) power amplifiers.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Power amplifiers are classified in several different categories such as A, AB,<br>
B, C, D, E, F, S, etc. based on their fundamental characteristics, which relate to circuit<br>
topology and principle of operation. Each class presents relative advantages and<br>
disadvantages in their operating characteristics, such as linearity, power efficiency,<br>
bandwidth, frequency response, etc., and is chosen according to the application<br>
requirements.<br>
More particularly, RF power amplification can be realized using active<br>
devices (i.e. transistors, vacuum tubes), that function as linear amplifiers, switching<br>
amplifiers or as a combination of both. Since linear amplifiers (e.g. classes A and B)<br>
are relatively inefficient at producing radio frequency (RF) output from an applied<br>
signal and direct current (DC) supply power, operating an active device as a linear<br>
amplifier is not an ideal solution for power amplifier applications requiring high<br>
efficiencies. Rather, designing the active device to operate as a switch is preferred<br>
because this mode of operation causes the device to be in a saturated or cut-off<br>
condition most of the time and therefore dissipates relatively little power by keeping<br>
the device out of the much lossier active region. In many applications, such as<br>
portable communication devices (e.g. cell phones) and high-power industrial<br>
generators (e.g. plasma drivers and broadcast transmitters), where low power<br>
consumption and low dissipation are crucial, high efficiency switching amplifiers are<br>
an attractive solution due to the performance and cost advantages they allow.<br>
FIG. 1 simplified block diagram of a generic switching power amplifier 6<br>
designed into a conventional RF transmission system 1. The system includes a driver<br><br><br>
4, the power amplifier 6, comprising a switch 5 and load network 7, and a load 8. The<br>
input signal 2 to be amplified is input to the driver stage 4, which controls the active<br>
device 5 in the amplifier. The active device acts substantially as a switch when<br>
appropriately driven by the driver and thus is represented as a single-pole, single<br>
throw switch. The active device is powered by a dc power supply 3, and has an<br>
output connected to the input of the load network 7. The output of the load network 7<br>
is connected to the load 8, such as an antenna. As the switch 5 is cyclically operated<br>
at the desired output frequency, or fundamental frequency, fo, the dc energy is<br>
converted into ac energy at this switching frequency and its harmonics. The load<br>
network 7 may employ one or more filters to control the power dissipation caused by<br>
switching action (i.e. the efficiency of the device), reduce the level of the harmonic<br>
overtones at the load, and/or provide impedance transformation. The design of the<br>
load network determines the behavior of the voltage and currents in the switching<br>
amplifier 6, and thus the class of operation by which the amplifier is denoted.<br>
Realizing highly efficient switching operation at high frequencies, however,<br>
has been challenging due to finite switching times in the active device and package<br>
parasitic impedances. Nonetheless, among the known types of power amplifiers,<br>
when an application requires highly power-efficient amplification at high operating<br>
frequencies, ostensibly the most appropriate known types are class E and F amplifiers.<br>
Class E Amplifiers<br>
The class E amplifier achieves high efficiency at high frequencies by<br>
essentially eliminating the dominant cause of the switching power dissipation that<br>
occurs in other types of switching amplifiers, namely the loss associated with<br>
capacitive discharge. In virtually every switching-mode power amplifier, a<br>
capacitance, Cs, shunts the power switch. At a minimum, this capacitance is the<br>
inherent parasitic capacitance, Cout, of the circuit components (transistor) and wiring;<br>
the circuit designer might intentionally wish to add additional capacitance. In other<br>
types of switching amplifiers (other than the Class E amplifier), this shunt capacitance<br>
is typically undesirable. The reason is that if the switch is turned on when the voltage<br>
across the switch and its shunt capacitance is nonzero, the energy stored in the<br>
charged capacitance will be dissipated as heat; the energy is CsV2/2, where Cs is the<br><br><br>
capacitance shunting the switch and V is the voltage across the switch (and hence<br>
across the capacitance) when the switch is turned on. If the switching frequency is f0,<br>
the power dissipation is CSV2 fo/2. Note that the power dissipation is directly<br>
proportional to the switching frequency. Thus, for a high-frequency power amplifier,<br>
this power dissipation can become a severe drawback, often becoming the dominant<br>
power loss mechanism. Moreover, while the switch is discharging this capacitor, the<br>
switch is subjected to both the capacitor voltage and the discharge current,<br>
simultaneously. If the simultaneous voltage and current are large enough, they can<br>
cause destructive failure and/or performance degradation of the power transistor.<br>
These difficulties can be avoided by ensuring Zero-Voltage-Switching (ZVS)<br>
operation, i.e. demanding that the voltage across the switch" be substantially zero when<br>
the switch is turned on. This feature of the class-E amplifier allows this class to<br>
readily accommodate the switching device output capacitance without seriously<br>
degrading performance by using this capacitance in the load network: and designing<br>
the load network so that the capacitor voltage is zero at just before the device turn-on.<br>
In addition to the problems with turning on the switch, switching off (opening)<br>
a power switch inherently subjects it to simultaneous high voltage and high current<br>
(hence further power dissipation and device stress). Fortunately, unlike the turn-on<br>
loss, this loss mechanism can be made arbitrarily small by choosing a faster device or<br>
increasing the device drive level sufficiently so as to reduce the device turn-off time.<br>
Although it is possible to design a switching amplifier to achieve ZCS (zero-current-<br>
switched) operation, wherein the device current is zero just before the transistor<br>
switches off thereby eliminating turn-off loss, it is believed to be impossible to<br>
achieve ZVS and ZCS conditions simultaneously. While the turn-off loss can be<br>
reduced by other means, the turn-on loss is dependent only on the switching voltage<br>
and the capacitance, Cs, which cannot be reduced arbitrarily as it is an inherent<br>
property of the active device. Therefore, ZVS switching has been found to be the<br>
most appropriate for high-efficiency operation using modern high-speed devices. By<br>
properly choosing the relative values of the circuit components (including the switch<br>
capacitance Cs, the load resistance RL, and load inductance LL), class E therefore<br>
allows for ZVS switching to reduce switching loss using a very simple circuit.<br><br><br>
Thus, with relatively simple circuit topology, class E operation achieves low<br>
power dissipation and low device stress by (a) incorporating the switch shunt<br>
capacitance as part of a network, allowing its detrimental effects to be accounted for<br>
and minimized and (b) using a resonant load network whose transient response after<br>
the switch turn-off brings the switch voltage back to zero (or nearly zero) at the time<br>
the switch will next be turned on. A schematic of a typical class E amplifier circuit is<br>
shown in the simplified diagram of FIG. 2. The power amplifier 10 includes a<br>
switching device 12 and a load network 20. DC power is supplied to the device 12<br>
via a choke 14. The network includes a simple filter 24 which is connected in series<br>
to an RL load, represented by LL 26, and RL 28, respectively. As a class E device, the<br>
filter acts as a short circuit at the fundamental frequency, and an open circuit at all<br>
harmonics. The inherent shunt capacitance, Cout, of the active device 12 (e.g. between<br>
the anode and cathode of a three terminal transistor) is incorporated into the network<br>
as all or part of capacitor Cs 22 which may include additional capacitance added by<br>
the designer. Thus, the impedance looking into the load network, Zin, is: at fo, Zin =<br>
(RL +JWOLL) II (1/jcodCs) which if properly designed is a substantially inductive load<br>
(i.e. a load consisting of both a resistance and an inductance), i.e. Zm = Reff + jwoLeff,<br>
and at all harmonic overtones, Zin = 1/jcoCs. The inductance of the fundamental<br>
frequency load, when properly sized relative to the capacitance Cs and the effective<br>
load resistance Reff, performs a phase correction of the fundamental frequency<br>
harmonic components, allowing the ZVS operation to be achieved.<br>
Class F and F-1 Amplifiers<br>
Class F is another well-known class of switching mode amplifiers. The class<br>
F amplifier derives its improved efficiency by using a multiple resonator load network<br>
to control the harmonic content of the active device's output voltage and/or current<br>
waveforms. In realizing a class F circuit, the active device operates primarily as a<br>
switch and the load network, generally, is designed to yield short-circuit impedances<br>
at even harmonics of the fundamental frequency and to yield open-circuit impedances<br>
at odd harmonics of the fundamental frequency.<br>
Efficient operation of a class F amplifier is realized when the output voltage of<br>
the active device (transistor) is driven rapidly from saturation (low resistance) to<br><br><br>
cutoff (high resistance) voltage. In operation, the combination of the active device<br>
and the output network produces a half sine wave current when the device is<br>
saturated. A high Q resonant circuit for all odd harmonics up to the Nth harmonic,<br>
often consisting of several parallel LC filters, makes possible odd harmonic<br>
components in the output voltage by providing high impedances to the active device<br>
at these frequencies. These odd harmonic voltages sum with the fundamental<br>
frequency output voltage to effectively flatten the output voltage waveform. This<br>
results in a combination of higher efficiency and higher power output. Additionally,<br>
resonant circuits are provided at all even harmonics up to the Nth harmonic to short<br>
circuit the active device at these frequencies, thereby allowing the current waveform<br>
to approximate a half-sinusoid, further increasing the efficiency without any decrease<br>
in output power. A high Q filter circuit is tuned to the fundamental frequency to<br>
reject harmonics at the load and yield a sinusoidal output signal. In this configuration,<br>
the device's inherent parasitic capacitance must be kept small in order to avoid<br>
shorting the high impedance presented by the resonant circuit at the odd harmonics.<br>
Although this problem can be somewhat minimized by resonating this capacitance<br>
with the load network, this technique further increases the complexity of the network.<br>
Additionally, if the active device is to be driven very hard so that it switches very<br>
quickly, a large number of harmonics must be tuned in order to achieve the benefit of<br>
class F operation. As a consequence of these limitations, class F is normally used<br>
only in applications where the transistor speed is relatively slow compared to the<br>
frequency of operation and using relatively small (i.e. low capacitance) devices, so<br>
that only a few harmonics need be tuned and so that the effect of the capacitance is<br>
small.<br>
A variation to the conventional class F amplifier is to invert the impedances at<br>
the harmonic overtones. Thus, the load network is designed to yield open circuit<br>
impedances at every even harmonic up to the Nth harmonic and short circuit<br>
impedances at every odd harmonic up to the Nth harmonic. Such an amplifier is called<br>
the inverse class-F, or class F-1 amplifier and one implementation is shown<br>
schematically in FIG. 3. In particular, this class F-1 amplifier 40 includes, a switching<br>
device 42 and load network 50 that comprises a filter 46 in series with the output of<br>
the switch and the resistive load 52 and a second filter 48 in parallel with the load 52.<br><br>
The series filter 46 presents relatively open circuit impedances for even harmonics<br>
and short circuit impedances for all other harmonics. The parallel filter 48 presents<br>
relatively short circuit impedances for all odd harmonics and open circuit impedances<br>
otherwise. Thus, the impedance looking into the load network, Zin, is: at fo, Zin =RL,<br>
at all even harmonics Zin = <x> (open) ; and at all odd harmonics Zin = 0 ( short). This<br>
amplifier class has many of the benefits of class F, and additionally has the property<br>
of near-ZVS operation, although this quality is difficult to achieve in the presence of a<br>
large parasitic device capacitance Cout. Although class F1 has been largely ignored<br>
for many years, several recent works have shown that this class of operation compares<br>
favorably to class F using modern solid-state devices.<br>
When class E and F power amplifier performances are compared, a significant<br>
advantage of a class E amplifier over a class F amplifier is its circuit topology, which<br>
incorporates the switching device output parasitic capacitance as part of its circuit.<br>
Thus, class E amplifiers do not lose power efficiency due to the charging and<br>
discharging of this parasitic capacitor as can occur in amplifier classes such as class F<br>
and class F-1 which do not account for the capacitor's effect, nor do they require<br>
elaborate resonant circuits to reduce the effect of this capacitance. In addition, as seen<br>
above, the class E design is relatively simple, consisting of just a few components (at<br>
least one less filter than in the class F design). Unlike class F and F-1 designs, the<br>
class E design receives the full promised benefits of its operating class with this<br>
simple circuit, whereas the class F and F-1 approaches must incorporate increasingly<br>
larger numbers of circuit elements in order to approach the ideal class F performance.<br>
On the other hand, due to its anode (i.e., transistor drain or collector) voltage and<br>
current wave formats, class F amplifiers deliver significantly higher power and<br>
promise higher power-efficiency than class E amplifiers when they are using the same<br>
transistor under the same supply conditions. To gain this advantage, class F and P"1<br>
circuits can be quite complex and can use many more components than class E<br>
devices.<br>
Thus, it would be highly desirable to have a power amplifier capable of very<br>
efficiently providing high power at high frequencies and that incorporates some the<br>
best features of both class E and class F amplifiers.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, which addresses these needs, resides in a high<br>
efficiency switching power amplifier for amplifying a high frequency input signal<br>
having at least one fundamental frequency, and that is adapted to drive a load. The<br>
amplifier includes a high-speed active device and a hybrid class E/F load network.<br>
The active device comprises a switching component that operates substantially as aj<br>
switch and a parasitic capacitance, Cut, in parallel with the switching component.<br>
The hybrid class E/F load network connected to the active device.<br>
In one embodiment, the hybrid class E/F load network is configured to present<br>
to the switching component of the active device, at all harmonic frequencies<br>
substantially present in at least one of the voltage and current waveforms of the active<br>
device, a substantially inductive load at each fundamental frequency, a substantially<br>
open circuit at a predetermined number, NE, of even harmonic overtones for each<br>
fundamental frequency up to an Nth harmonic, a substantially short circuit at a<br>
predetermined number, No, of odd harmonic overtones for each fundamental<br>
frequency up to an Nth harmonic, and a substantially capacitive impedance load at the<br>
remaining harmonic overtones, up to an Nth harmonic. In this embodiment, N ? 3 and<br>
1 
class F amplifier. In a more specific example, if NE =1, then No&gt;0.<br>
More specifically, the load network includes a two port filter network having<br>
an input port and an output port, the input port being connected to the active device in<br>
parallel with the parasitic output capacitance Cout, and the output port being connected<br>
to the load. The load network may also be configured to provide wideband tuning of<br>
an input signal having a fundamental frequency range from f1 to f2, where f2 
In another broad implementation of the present invention, the hybrid class E/F<br>
load network connected to the active device is configured to present to the active<br>
device a substantially inductive load at the fundamental frequency of operation, a<br>
substantially open circuit at a predetermined number of even harmonic overtones of<br>
the fundamental frequency, a substantially short circuit at a predetermined number of<br>
odd harmonic overtones of the fundamental frequency, and a substantially capacitive<br>
impedance load at the remaining harmonic overtones.<br><br>
In yet another implementation of the present invention, the hybrid class E/F<br>
load network is configured to present to the switching component, at all harmonic<br>
frequencies that are substantially present in at least one of the voltage and current<br>
waveforms of the active device, a substantially inductive load at each fundamental<br>
frequency of operation that results in substantially zero-voltage-switching (ZVS)<br>
operation of the active device, impedances substantially larger in magnitude than<br>
V(2?fCs) a at a predetermined number, NE, of even harmonic overtones of each<br>
fundamental frequency, impedances substantially smaller in magnitude than 1/{2?fCs)<br>
at a predetermined number, No, of odd harmonic overtones of each fundamental<br>
frequency, and an impedance substantially equal to 1/jwCs at the remaining harmonic<br>
overtones of each fundamental frequency. Cs = Cout + Cadded, where Caddecl ? 0, and NE<br>
&gt; 0, No? 0, and the total number of tuned harmonic overtones, NE + No, is at least one<br>
and less than the total number of harmonic overtone frequencies substantially present<br>
in the active device's at least one of voltage and current waveforms. Since the<br>
network need not operate to provide substantially open and short circuits, as in the<br>
prior examples, the network can be simplified to a significant degree.<br>
In yet another implementation of the present invention, a multiple active<br>
device high efficiency switching power amplifier for amplifying a high frequency<br>
input signal having at least one fundamental frequency and adapted to drive a load, is<br>
disclosed. In this case, a first high-speed active device having a parasitic output<br>
capacitance, Cout1 and adapted to operate substantially as a switch, and a second high-<br>
speed active device having a parasitic output capacitance, Cout2 and adapted to operate<br>
substantially as a switch, are provided together with a hybrid three-port class E/F load<br>
network. The network has a first port connected to the first active device, a second<br>
port connected to the second active device, and a third port connected to the load,<br>
such that when the first and second active devices are driven in a push-pull<br>
configuration, the network presents to the switching component an effective input<br>
impedance that provides a substantially inductive load in series with the substantially<br>
resistive load at all fundamental frequencies; a substantially open circuit at one or<br>
more even harmonics for each fundamental frequency up to an Nth harmonic, a<br>
substantially short circuit at one or more odd harmonics for each fundamental<br><br><br>
frequency up to an Nth harmonic, and a substantially capacitive impedance load at the<br>
remaining harmonic overtones, up to an Nth harmonic.<br>
In a more detailed implementation of this push-pull amplifier, the amplifier<br>
further includes a transformer connected to the outputs of the two active devices and<br>
the load such that the load is dc isolated from the outputs of the two active devices via<br>
the transformer.<br>
In a detailed embodiment of one aspect of the present invention, a quasi-class<br>
E/F3 high efficiency amplifier for amplifying an input signal having at least one<br>
fundamental frequency and adapted to drive a load is disclosed. This amplifier<br>
includes a high speed active device that comprises a switching component that<br>
operates substantially as a switch and a parasitic capacitance, Cout, in parallel with the<br>
switching component and an LC parallel tank circuit that is resonant at the second<br>
harmonic of the fundamental frequency. The active device is connected in series to<br>
the load through the LC parallel tank circuit.<br>
A method of amplifying an RF signal with an active device switch is also<br>
disclosed. The method includes amplifying the signal with an active device that<br>
comprises a switching component that operates substantially as a switch and a<br>
parasitic capacitance, Cout, in parallel with the switching component. The method<br>
includes tuning the amplified signal to provide a substantially inductive load to the<br>
switching component at the fundamental frequency, tuning the amplified signal to<br>
provide a substantially open circuit to the active device at selected even harmonic<br>
overtones, tuning the amplified signal to provide a substantially short circuit to the<br>
active device at selected odd harmonic overtones; and providing substantially<br>
capacitive loading to the active device for the non-selected harmonic overtones.<br>
Several detailed implementations of the hybrid class E/F load network of the<br>
amplifier of the present invention are disclosed. In one embodiment, the network is<br>
configured to present to the switching component, at all harmonic frequencies<br>
substantially present in at least one of the voltage and current waveforms of the active<br>
device, a substantially inductive load at each fundamental frequency, a substantially<br>
open circuit at the 2nd harmonic, and a substantially capacitive impedance load at the<br>
remaining harmonic overtones, up to an Nth harmonic, where N &gt; 3.<br><br>
In an alternative implementation, the network is configured to present to the<br>
switching component, a substantially inductive load at each fundamental frequency; a<br>
substantially short circuit at the 3rd harmonic, and a substantially capacitive<br>
impedance load at the remaining harmonic overtones, up to an Nth harmonic where N<br>
&gt;3.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention allows the achievement of higher performance than<br>
either the conventional class E or class F-1 amplifiers by incorporating some of the<br>
best features of both in a single design.<br>
In general, the present invention employs the inductive-load phase correction<br>
technique of the class E amplifier to achieve ZVS switching conditions in the<br>
presence of a significant active device output capacitance, while simultaneously<br>
allowing some of the harmonic tuning benefits of the class F-1 amplifier. The<br>
invention allows the efficiency and output power of the active device to be improved<br>
by tuning some of the harmonics like a class-F-1 amplifier (i.e. open-circuit for even<br>
harmonics, short-circuit for odd harmonics), while allowing the remaining un-tuned<br><br><br>
harmonics to be capacitive as in a class-E amplifier. Since the un-tuned harmonics<br>
are capacitive, this tuning strategy allows the device capacitance to be easily<br>
incorporated into the circuit as in class-E, and the circuit can remain relatively simple<br>
since tuning circuits are required only for those harmonics tuned to open-circuit or<br>
short-circuit. Like class-E amplifiers, the amplifiers of the present invention may<br>
approach 100% efficiency with a simple circuit consisting of a finite number of<br>
elements, whereas class-F and class-F1 designs can only approach 100% as the<br>
number of harmonics tuned approaches infinity. Additionally, the invention allows<br>
ZVS operation by tuning the fundamental frequency to present an inductive load (i.e.<br>
a load consisting of both an inductance and a resistance) to the device, where the<br>
inductance and resistance are appropriately sized relative to the capacitance Cs so as<br>
to offset the capacitive effect of the un-tuned harmonics and bring the voltage to zero<br>
just before the switch closes each cycle. This inductance can be achieved by placing<br>
an appropriately-sized inductor in series with the load, but other solutions such as a<br>
shunt inductor or transmission line segments may also be used and are thus within the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
The topology of one such preferred embodiment is seen in FIG. 4. The<br>
switching power amplifier 100 includes an active device. The active device<br>
comprises a switching component 102 that operates substantially as a switch<br>
(hereinafter the term "switch" will be used interchangeably with the term "switching<br>
component" to denote that portion of the active device that operates substantially as a<br>
switch) and a parasitic capacitance, Cout, in parallel with the switching component. It<br>
should be understood that in all of the following implementations of the present<br>
invention, the impedances presented are with respect to the switching component of<br>
the active device and thus includes the inherent parasitic capacitance of the device.<br>
Moreover, the term active device is to be understood in the broadest sense to include<br>
any appropriate three terminal active device such as a FET or CMOS transistor.<br>
The device is connected to an output circuit load network 110. The network<br>
includes an even harmonic filter 108 in series with a "negative capacitance" filter 107,<br>
which are in parallel with the switch 102 and the shunt capacitance, denoted as Cs,<br>
106 (which may equal Cout, the switch's inherent capacitance or may be Cout + added<br><br><br>
capacitance), an odd harmonic filter 111 also in parallel with the switch, a<br>
fundamental frequency filter 112 in series with the output of the switch and the load<br>
and added inductance LL 114 in series with the primarily resistive load 116. The even<br>
harmonic filter 108 presents a substantially short circuit at selected even harmonics<br>
and an open otherwise. Thus, at these harmonics the "negative capacitance" filter<br>
107, having an impedanceat these harmonics is in parallel with the shunt<br>
capacitance Cs 106 with an impedance and so the combined impedance of<br>
these two elements is substantially equal to an open-circuit. The odd harmonic filter<br>
111 presents a short circuit at the selected odd harmonics and an open otherwise,<br>
short-circuiting the active device at these harmonics. The series fundamental<br>
frequency filter 112 presents to the switch a short circuit at the fundamental frequency<br>
and an open circuit otherwise. The phase-control inductance, denoted as inductor LL<br>
114, is placed in series with the resistive load, denoted as resistor RL 116.<br>
Taken together, as seen in FIG. 4, this network thus presents a substantially<br>
inductive load at the fundamental frequency<br>
 , a substantially open circuit at any number of pre-selected even harmonic<br>
overtones, a substantially short-to-ground at any number of pre-selected odd<br>
harmonic overtones, and capacitive impedance to ground at the remaining<br>
overtones<br>
Power amplifiers using this novel technique and topology will be classified as<br>
class E/F amplifiers. As this topology covers of a family of amplifiers, specific<br>
implementations may be denoted as class E/Fn1,n2,n3,etc., wherein the various subscripts<br>
are numbers denoting the harmonics for which the amplifier's load network has class<br>
F-1 impedances. For instance, class E/F2,3,5 would describe an amplifier with a load<br>
network presenting to the active device an inductive load at the fundamental, open<br>
circuit at the second harmonic, short circuit at the third and fifth harmonics, and a<br>
capacitive load for the remaining overtones.<br>
The advantages of this new class of amplifiers are numerous and may include:<br>
(a) higher efficiency and/or output power when compared to a similar class E<br>
amplifier; (b) reduced circuit complexity with comparable or better efficiency and/or<br>
output power when compared to a similar class F or class F-1 amplifier; (c) reduced<br><br><br>
peak voltage relative to the DC voltage when compared to a similar class E amplifier;<br>
(d) reduced peak current relative to the DC current when compared to a similar class<br>
E amplifier; and (e) allows for the incorporation of the switch's parasitic capacitor<br>
into the circuit while simultaneously achieving zero voltage switching (ZVS), unlike a<br>
class F or class F-1 amplifier.<br>
Moreover, the number of even and odd harmonic overtones that are controlled<br>
may be adjusted. Realizing that higher-order harmonics tend to have less effect on<br>
the efficiency than the lower-order ones, and that the finite active device switching<br>
speed will effectively reduce the generation of higher-frequency harmonic<br>
components, the class E/F switching power amplifier of the present invention may<br>
include a switching device connected to the output circuit presenting an inductive load<br>
at the fundamental frequency, an open circuit at selected even harmonic overtones up<br>
to Nth harmonic, shorts to ground at selected odd harmonic overtones up to Nth<br>
harmonic, and capacitive loads at the remaining overtones up to the Nth harmonic.<br>
The impedances of the output circuit above N-1 harmonic may be any impedance<br>
where N is a number equal to or greater than 3.<br>
It should be understood that the advantages of the present invention are<br>
measured relative to the performance characteristics of conventional class E and class<br>
F (and/or F-1) power amplifiers. Although the performance is generally best when<br>
tuned-harmonics have been completely short-circuited or open-circuited, this<br>
condition is not usually possible to achieve in practice and the designer must be<br>
content with reducing or increasing the magnitude of the impedance as much as<br>
possible respectively. Thus, the present invention broadly contemplates load<br>
networks that present impedances other than those described in connection with FIG.<br>
4. Thus, for example, the filters 108, 110 and 112 of FIG. 4 may be designed to<br>
present (a) impedances larger than those presented by class E amplifiers at selected<br>
even harmonic overtones(but not necessarily infinite), (b) impedances<br>
that are smaller than those presented by class E amplifiersat selected<br>
odd harmonic overtones (Zin), and class-E-like capacitive impedances<br>
at the remaining overtones. Again, the resistance and inductance of the inductive load<br>
at the fundamental frequency are selected so as to achieve ZVS switching conditions.<br><br><br>
Such amplifiers may be classified as "quasi-class E/F" power amplifiers. It should be<br>
understood by those skilled in the art that these amplifiers can be easier to design and<br>
implement than their similar class E/F amplifier counterparts shown in FIG. 4 as they<br>
can use fewer components and lower quality components. They may even provide<br>
better performance than "true" class E/F amplifiers for some applications, such as<br>
when design factors (e.g. available component sizes, low component quality factors,<br>
etc.) other than the active device efficiency and output power are motivating the<br>
requirements of the load network.<br>
Specific Implementations<br>
The novel circuit topology of the present invention may be implemented in a<br>
variety of circuits. Single-active-device designs such as shown in FIG. 4 can be used<br>
to implement E/F designs in a very straightforward manner. For instance, to construct<br>
an E/F3 amplifier, a circuit such as shown in FIG. 4B may be employed. The circuit<br>
consists of the active device 102' in parallel with a shunt capacitance Cs 106', to<br>
which are connected a series LC resonator 111' tuned to short-circuit the third<br>
harmonic, and an inductive load, through a second series LC resonator 112' tuned to<br>
resonate at the fundamental frequency. The inductive load consists of the load to be<br>
driven RL 116' and a phase-correction inductor LL 114'. A choke 104' provides<br>
connection to the dc power supply. Thus the circuit satisfies the E/F3 conditions by<br>
providing to the switch a short-circuiting at the third harmonic, an inductive load at<br>
the fundamental, and capacitive impedances at the remaining harmonics. It should be<br>
understood that the capacitance Cs may not be an explicit component added by the<br>
designer, but may consist partially or entirely of the active device's parasitic output<br>
capacitance. Of course, many variations of this circuit are readily devised by one<br>
skilled in the art, such as combining the inductance of the fundamental frequency<br>
resonator 112' and the phase-correction inductor, LL, 114' into one component,<br>
thereby reducing the component count.<br>
FIG. 4C shows another example of a single-active-device design, in this case<br>
an E/F2,3 implementation. This circuit consists of the active device 102" connected to<br>
a capacitance Cs, and three resonant circuits. The first resonant circuit is a series LC<br>
filter 111" tuned to the third harmonic so as to short-circuit the active device at this<br><br>
frequency. The second is also a series LC resonator 113" tuned to the second<br>
harmonic, which is connected to the active device in series with an inductor 115 with<br>
a value of This circuit will provide the active device with an open-circuit at<br>
the second harmonic by resonating with the capacitance Cs at this frequency. The<br>
third circuit is a series LC resonator 112" tuned to the fundamental frequency, to<br>
which is connected an inductive load consisting of an inductance LL 114" and the<br>
resistive load to be driven RL 116". A choke 104" provides connection to the dc<br>
power supply. Thus the circuit satisfies the E/F2,3 conditions by open-circuiting the<br>
active device at the second harmonic, short-circuiting the active device at the third<br>
harmonic, providing an inductive load at the fundamental, and providing capacitive<br>
impedances at the remaining harmonics. Again, it should be understood that the<br>
capacitance Cs may not be an explicit component added by the designer, but may<br>
consist partially or entirely of the active device's parasitic output capacitance.<br>
Such direct implementations as shown in the previous two examples are not<br>
the only means to implement class E/F amplifiers. For instance, FIG 4D shows an<br>
alternate implementation for E/F2,3 using a dual-resonant filter network 118 to<br>
accomplish both second and third harmonic tunings. Such a filter can be implemented<br>
as shown in the figure using only two inductors L1 and L2 and one capacitor, C1. This<br>
network also passes dc currents, and so it can also replace the choke by placing it<br>
between the active device and the dc voltage supply. The fundamental frequency<br>
filter, shunt capacitance and load inductance are similar to the equivalent components<br>
in FIGS. 4B and 4C.<br>
Moreover, a very wide range of E/F designs can be accomplished using<br>
push/pull techniques. Due to the different symmetries of the even and odd harmonics<br>
of push/pull amplifiers, the push/pull approach can greatly simplify the selective<br>
tuning of even and odd harmonics. In one such circuit, shown conceptually in FIG. 5,<br>
the class E/F amplifier includes two switching devices 122, 126 connected in a push-<br>
pull configuration, each with a shunt capacitor 124, 128, respectively. Both an<br>
inductive load 130, represented by a resistor 132 and inductor 134, and a resonant<br>
circuit 140 are connected between the switches. The filter 140 acts (a) to short-circuit<br>
the two switches together for all odd harmonic overtones, (b) as an open circuit at the<br><br>
fundamental, and (c) has arbitrary impedances at the remaining overtones. To provide<br>
DC power, one or more chokes 142, 144 may be placed in such a way as to allow<br>
direct current into both switches.<br>
The design, operation, and performance of the circuit shown in FIG. 5 follows<br>
the principles of two class E/F amplifiers connected in a push-pull configuration, each<br>
assisting the other in providing the appropriate harmonic tunings. Both switches are<br>
connected to the inductive load 130 at the fundamental frequency in classical push-<br>
pull fashion, making the impedance at this frequency on each switch equal to one half<br>
that of this inductive load. The odd harmonic overtones are short-circuited to each<br>
other through the filter, and therefore each is shorted to virtual ground due to the<br>
symmetric nature of the push-pull amplifier. This can be easily seen since the odd<br>
harmonics voltages of a push/pull amplifier's active devices must be 180° out-of-<br>
phase, thus if each is shorted to the other then both must be zero. Similarly, the load<br>
and resonator are effectively removed from the circuit at the even harmonic overtones<br>
due to differential symmetry considerations, leaving each active device at these<br>
frequencies with a capacitive load consisting only of its shunt capacitance Cs- This is<br>
because the even harmonic voltages of a push/pull amplifier are in-phase, thus the<br>
current through a differential load at these frequencies must be zero and the<br>
differential load will have no effect on the circuit for these harmonics. Thus, the<br>
circuit satisfies the conditions of class E/F amplification by providing short-circuits to<br>
the switch at all odd harmonics, capacitive load at all even harmonics, and inductive<br>
load at the fundamental. To denote that the amplifier has a load network supplying a<br>
class-F'1 impedance of short-circuit to ground at all odd harmonic overtones, the<br>
denotation class E/Fodd is suggested, where the odd subscript denotes that all odd<br>
harmonic overtones have been short-circuited.<br>
This circuit topology may offer several advantages. Using only a relatively<br>
small number of circuit components, this amplifier may be constructed with<br>
performance similar to a single-ended class E/F amplifier requiring many more<br>
components. The number of components is independent of the number of the order of<br>
odd harmonic overtones being tuned. A conventional single-ended implementation<br><br><br>
(i.e., a single-device switching amplifier) requires a larger number of tuned<br>
components proportional to the total number of the overtones being controlled.<br>
Moreover, in narrow-band applications, the resonator may be constructed<br>
using a simple parallel-connected LC resonator. Several advantages are provided<br>
using this simplified design. First, in this case, only one component needs to be tuned<br>
to short ALL of the odd overtones. For single-ended solutions this would require<br>
tuning a number of components proportional to the number of overtones being<br>
shorted.<br>
Second, the loaded Q of the LC parallel resonant circuit may be relatively low,<br>
even as low as one (although the third-harmonic in very low-Q cases is not very well<br>
shorted, making this case a quasi-class E/F design). This permits the use of very low<br>
unloaded-Q inductors allowing the use of this topology for applications like Si<br>
(silicon) substrate-based integrated circuits where any typical inductor presents a very<br>
low unloaded-Q of around 5, making the use of a low loaded-Q filter a necessity. A<br>
conventional approach using a class E or class F amplifier generally requires filters<br>
with loaded Q of at least 3.<br>
Third, the series inductor in the load may be represented as an equivalent<br>
parallel inductor and incorporated into the LC tank, reducing the number of<br>
components further.<br>
In a variation to the circuit shown in FIG. 5, FIG. 6 shows yet another novel<br>
circuit topology of a power amplifier circuit 150 that implements the class E/F<br>
amplifier with two switching devices 152, 156 connected in a push-pull configuration,<br>
each with a shunt capacitor 154, 158, respectively. In particular, connected between<br>
the switches are both the primary 170 of a transformer and a resonant; circuit 160<br>
which short-circuits the two switches together for all odd harmonic overtones,<br>
presents an open circuit at the fundamental, and has arbitrary impedances at the<br>
remaining overtones. Connected to the secondary 172 of the transformer is an RL<br>
load 162. To provide DC potential, a choke 174 (or more than one) is placed in such<br>
a way as to allow direct current into both switches. Several variations of this circuit<br>
will be recognized by those skilled in the art since the load inductance 164 and the<br>
resonant circuit 160 may be connected on either side of the transformer, primary 170<br><br><br>
or secondary 172 circuit, after proper impedance transformation. Additionally, the<br>
load inductance may also be incorporated into the resonator inductance. If desired,<br>
the parasitic inductances of the transformer may be used as elements in the resonant<br>
circuit 170 and for the load inductance 164, reducing the part count and allowing for<br>
the incorporation of transformer parasitics into the design.<br>
The design, operation, and performance of such amplifiers follow exactly the<br>
principles of the class E/Fodd push-pull amplifiers described above. In addition to all<br>
the advantages described in the design shown in FIG. 5, in this design (a) the output<br>
load is DC isolated from the switching circuit and supply; (b) the output load may be<br>
connected in unbalanced mode; and (c) the transformer turn ratio may be used to help<br>
match the switch output impedance to the load impedance.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the present invention may use additional tuning<br>
circuits in parallel with each switch of the circuits shown in FIGS. 5 and 6 so as to<br>
selectively open circuit a number of even harmonic overtones. FIG. 7 shows a<br>
schematic diagram of a circuit 180 for accomplishing this as well as a possible<br>
implementation strategy. By placing additional circuits 210/212 and 220/222 which<br>
supply a suitable inductive impedance in parallel with the switching devices' 182 and<br>
186 parallel capacitances 184 and 188, respectively, at various even harmonic<br>
overtones, the class E/Fodd amplifier concept may be extended to allow also for the<br>
open-circuiting of any number of even harmonics, providing potential additional<br>
performance benefits. The denotation class E/Fn1,n2.....odd is suggested for such<br>
amplifiers, where the numerical subscripts identify the even harmonic overtones being<br>
open circuited. In addition to the benefits described in relation to the circuits shown<br>
in FIGS. 5 and 6, this improvement offers increased efficiency over class E/Fodd.<br>
It should be understood by those skilled in the art that as a new class of<br>
amplifiers, the present invention encompasses a virtually unlimited number of specific<br>
class E/F networks. However, for practical design considerations, the present<br>
invention specifically discloses several lower-order harmonic tuning networks.<br>
Specifically, these networks includes those that present: (a) a substantially open<br>
circuit at the 2nd harmonic; (b) a substantially short circuit at the 3rd harmonic, (c) a<br>
substantially short circuit at the 3rd harmonic and a substantially open circuit at the 2nd<br><br><br>
harmonic; (d) a substantially open circuit at the 4th harmonic; (e) a substantially open<br>
circuit at the 2nd and 4th harmonics; (e) a substantially short circuit at the 3rd harmonic<br>
and a substantially open circuit at the 4th harmonic; (f) a substantially short circuit at<br>
the 3rd harmonic and a substantially open circuit at the 2nd and 4th harmonics; (g) a<br>
substantially short circuit at all odd harmonic overtones up to the Nth harmonic, where<br>
N is greater than or equal to 5; and (h) a substantially short circuit at all odd harmonic<br>
overtones up to the Nth harmonic, a substantially open circuit at a predetermined<br>
number, NE, of even harmonic overtones for each fundamental frequency up to an Nth<br>
harmonic, a substantially capacitive impedance load at the remaining harmonic<br>
overtones, up to an Nth harmonic, where N &gt; 5 and 0 
understood that many other networks and related circuits that tune other numbers of<br>
even and/or odd harmonics are within the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
In yet a further improvement, circuit size and losses of the amplifier shown in<br>
FIG. 5 may be decreased by replacing the DC feed choke(s) with two inductors from<br>
the supply voltage to the respective switching devices: As shown in FIG. 8, if each<br>
inductor, 230 232, is made to resonate at the second harmonic with the switching<br>
device's parallel capacitors Cs, 124' and 128', respectively, the resulting class E/F2,Odd<br>
amplifier benefits from decreased switch losses and possibly reduced losses due to the<br>
choke's series resistance.<br>
In yet another implementation of the present invention, a wideband class<br>
E/Fodd switching amplifier may be constructed in such a way as to have class E/Fodd<br>
impedances relative to the switch over a range of switching frequencies from// to/2<br>
where f 2 
configuration, each with a shunt capacitor, as shown in FIG. 5. Between the switches<br>
are connected both a resistive load and a resonant circuit which short-circuits the two<br>
switches together for all frequencies greater than or equal to 3f1, and approximates the<br>
required inductance to meet the ZVS requirement from f1 to f2. To provide DC<br>
potential, one or more chokes may be placed in such a way as to allow direct current<br>
into both switches. Constructed in this way, the circuit works as described in<br>
connection with FIG. 5 over the switching frequency range from f1 to f2.<br><br><br>
FIG. 9 shows a novel implementation of a quasi class E/F3 amplifier<br>
consisting of a switch or transistor 300 with parallel capacitor 302. They are<br>
connected to the supply through a choke 304. The switch or transistor is connected in<br>
series to the load 310 through an LC parallel resonant circuit 306 at the second<br>
harmonic. A filtering circuit may be added to avoid the higher order harmonic<br>
interference to the load, if the application requires it. After the component values are<br>
properly adjusted, this topology provides to the switch or transistor an inductive load<br>
at fundamental frequency, capacitive load at second harmonic, low impedance at third<br>
harmonic, and uncontrolled low impedances at higher order harmonics. This<br>
complies with requirements of quasi-class E/F amplifiers and offers several<br>
advantages. First, this modified quasi-class E/F circuit may be implemented using a<br>
relatively small number of components. Second, there is only one tuned component<br>
in the circuit compared to the conventional ZVS class F amplifiers. Third., the loaded<br>
Q of the LC parallel resonant circuit may be very low and may be as low as one. This<br>
permits the use of very low unloaded Q inductors allowing the use of this topology for<br>
applications like Si (silicon) substrate based integrated circuits where any typical<br>
inductor presents a very low Q around 5. A conventional approach using class E or<br>
class F amplifiers requires inductors with loaded Q of at least 3. Further, since the<br>
resonant tank is a parallel LC rather than the typical series LC found in class E<br>
amplifiers, the inductance needed is reduced considerably. This is attractive when the<br>
size of the inductor is the limiting factor in reducing amplifier size and weight.<br>
In yet another variation of the topology of the present invention, the class E/F<br>
amplifier of the present invention may be tuned to operate in a linear mode, such as<br>
class A, class A/B, or class B at lower output power levels and E/F switching mode at<br>
higher output power levels. The output power and mode of operation may be varied<br>
by changing the input power and/or bias conditions. In this way, an amplifier may be<br>
constructed that has the high efficiency advantages of class E/F at the higher power<br>
levels while allowing the output power to be modulated or varied by changing drive<br>
conditions.<br>
Having thus described exemplary embodiments of the invention, it will be<br>
apparent that further alterations, modifications, and improvements will also occur to<br><br><br>
those skilled in the art. Further, it will be apparent that the presently-described circuit<br>
and devices are not limited to any particular type of switching active switching<br>
technology, material systems or for any particularly speed, frequency range, or power<br>
level of operation. Rather, a broad class of amplifier and associated topologies have<br>

shaping by presenting class-F-1 impedances at selected overtones and class-E impedances at<br>
the remaining overtones. The present invention discloses several topologies and specific<br>
circuit implementations for achieving such performance.</x></td>
