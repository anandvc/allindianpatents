				<td>A process for the removal of phenolic constituents of testa from fresh coconut to result in the preparation of substantially pure lauric rich coconut oil and a protein-rich fraction<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the removal of phenolic constituents of testa from fresh coconut to result in the preparation of substantially pure lauric rich coconut oil and a protein-rich fraction. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the production of lauric rich coconut oil and a protein rich fraction that are substantially free of harmful phenolic constituents of testa. Background of the invention<br>
Coconut (Cocos nucifera) an important oilseed crop of India and has great potential as a source of dietary oil and protein for human consumption. The production of coconut takes place predominantly in the southern state of Kerala where it is treated as a cash crop. Kerala contributes nearly 40-45% of the production of 13,300 million nuts (Aravindakshan, M. 1997, India attains the premier position in coconut production, Indian Coconut Journal, Vol.XXVIH, No.3:2-3).<br>
In the coconut processing industry, coconuts are simply cut into halves and sun-dried in an open-yard for copra production. This inevitably results in the accumulation of dirt and other possible extraneous matter on the copra. Another problem faced in the conventional method of drying coconut to obtain copra is that rain or excessive humidity adversely affects the drying process. As a result of inadequate drying, fungal contamination often occurs resulting in aflatoxin contamination, which is highly dangerous to health since aflatoxin is carcinogenic (Sreedhara, N. and Subramanian, N. 1981, Physico-chemical properties of hydrogen peroxide treated groundnut protein, J.Food Sci., 46:1260-1264). This leads to poor quality copra which in turn leads to loss in oil recovery. Mechanical pressing, solvent extraction or a combination of the two is employed at varying conditions of temperature and pressure to obtain the oil. Since the value of the oil is very high, very little or no attention is paid during oil extraction and even fungus infested aflatoxin contaminated coconut kernels/copra halves are not rejected.<br>
Another serious disadvantage of coconut is the presence of thin dark-brown skin called testa that is strongly attached to the copra/coconut kernel. This gives rise to undesirable phenolic constituents and imparts dark colour to coconut oil and as well to the coconut meal depending on extraction conditions and reduces their acceptability. It is believed that the<br>
formation of covalent bonds between proteins and oxidised phenolic substances results in the<br><br>
reduction in nutritional value (Sosulski, F.W. 1979, Organoleptic and nutritional effects of phenolic components on oilseed protein products: A review, J. Am.Oil.Chem. Soc., 1979, 56:71 l-715;Yu, F., Barry, T.N., McNabb, W.C., Moughan, P.J., Wilson, G.F. 1995, Effect of bound condensed tannin from cottonseed upon in situ protein solubility and dry matter digestion in the rumen, J.Sci. Food Agric. 69:311-320; Siebert, K.J., Troukhanova, N.V., Lynn, P.Y., 1996., Nature of polyphenol-protein interactions, J. Agric.Food Chem. 44:80-85)..<br>
Coconuts are generally processed in local oil milling units for the extraction of coconut oil. As stated above coconuts are normally cut into halves and left in the open-yard for sundrying (4-7 days) to produce split copras. Usually very little attention is paid to the processing aspects of coconut for the production of copra thereby resulting in deterioration of copra quality, mostly as a result of fungal infestation with consequent discolouration of the kernel. The split copra obtained by the conventional drying process is unhygenic. Thus the oil obtained by the existing methodology is usually poor in quality. The cake is also coloured and of inferior quality and hence goes for animal feeding (Chelliah, J. and Baptist, N.G. 1969, Extraction of protein from expeller and solvent extracted coconut meal by dilute acid, alkali and NaCl solutions, J. Sci. Food Agric. 20:49-53; Butterworth, M.H.and Fox, H.C. 1963, The effect of heat treatment on the nutritive value of coconut meal and the prediction of nutritive value by chemical methods, Brit. J. Nutr. 17:445; Hagenmaier, R.D., Cater, C.M. and Mattil, K.F. 1973, Aqueous processing of fresh coconuts for recovery of oil and coconut skim milk, J. Food Sci. 38:516-518; Kwon, K.S., Bae, D., Park, K.H. and Rhee, K.C. 1996, Aqueous extraction and membrane techniques to improve coconut protein concentrate functionality, J. Food Sci. 61(4):753-756).<br>
It is therefore necessary to overcome the nutritionally harmful effects of phenolic components of testa in coconut as a whole and to make it more attractive as a value-added product. Objects of the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process to overcome the nutritionally harmful effects of phenolic components in coconut essentially to obtain high quality lauric-rich coconut oil and protein-rich fraction.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the removal of testa and therefore provide copra or coconut kernel that is easily disintegrated into lauric rich coconut oil and protein rich fraction.<br><br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention an improved process for the production of a lauric rich coconut oil and protein rich fraction which comprising<br>
i)   removing copra and/or coconut kernel from coconut.<br>
ii) Treating the copra and/or coconut kernel with hydrochloric acid having a strength in the<br>
range of IN to 5N, the copra and/or coconut kernel and hydrochloric acid ratio being in the<br>
range of 1:1 to 2:1 (w/v), at a temperature in the range of 95 to 105°C for a period ranging<br>
from 1 to 25 minutes;<br>
iii) Separating the treated copra and/or coconut kernel and removing the excess acid by<br>
washing it with water;<br>
iv) Drying the treated copra and/or coconut kernel;<br>
v) Extracting the dried and treated copra and/or coconut kernel with a food grade hexane as<br>
solvent to obtain lauric rich coconut oil and protein rich fraction. In one embodiment of the invention, the acid treatment is effected at a hydrochloric acid strength of 3N.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the ratio of the copra and/or coconut kernel to hydrochloric acid in 1:1.5 (w/v).<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the ratio of the food grade hexane to the treated and dried copra and/or coconut kernel is 1:1.5.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the treated and dried copra and/or coconut kernel is converted into coconut grits or gratings before extraction with the food grade hexane. In a further embodiment of the invention, the treated and dried copra and/or coconut kernel is extracted with the solvent three times.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the extract is distilled under vacuum. In another embodiment of the invention, the extract is distilled under vacuum. In another embodiment of the invention, the temperature of acid treatment is in the range of 99±3°C and the time period is in the range of 1 to 22 minutes. Detailed description of the invention<br>
The treated coconut is carefully removed and dipped into 2L beaker containing tap water to remove the acid and further washed with water and dried in vacuum oven at 45±1°C. The pearl white ice cream-like copra/coconut kernel that is totally free from phenolic.<br><br>
components are cut into small pieces and subjected to percolation with food grade solvent (hexane) to obtain pure white lauric-rich coconut oil and protein-rich fraction.<br>
The present invention involves the following steps:<br>
Copra/coconut kernel in the form of a ball, obtained after carefully removing its shell, having 9-12% and 36-40% moisture respectively are treated with IN to 5N hydrochloric acid at 99±3°C for a period of 1-22 min.<br>
It is observed that<br>
1.	Treatment with IN HC1 for 18-22 min at 99±3°C results in 100% separation of the<br>
phenolic components.<br>
2.	Treatment with 2N HC1 for 10-11 min at 99±3°C results in 100% separation of the<br>
phenolic components.<br>
3.	Treatment with 3N HC1 for 5-7 min at 99±3°C results in 100% separation of the phenolic<br>
components.<br>
4.	Treatment with 4N HC1 for 4-5 min at 99±3°C results in 100% separation of the phenolic<br>
components.<br>
5.	Treatment with 5N HC1 for 2-3 min at 99±3°C results in 100% separation of the phenolic<br>
components.<br>
6.	Treatment with 3N HC1 at 70°C, 80°C, 85°C and 90±2°C for a period of 55-65 min,<br>
35-45 min, 25-30 min and 12-16 min, respectively also results in complete removal of the<br>
phenolic components.<br>
7.	Treatment with 3N HC1 at 99±3°C for 5-7 min was found to be the best condition for<br>
100% separation of the phenolic components from the point of view of efficicacy of 100%<br>
removal of the phenolic components, color of the kernel obtained and cost involved.<br>
After the treatment the whole copra/coconut kernel is removed and given a water wash by dipping it in about a liter of water in 2L beaker. After washing, the whole copra/coconut kernel was subjected to scouring action by holding it in between two hands to obtain white copra and snow pearl white coconut kernel. It was either air-dried or dried in vacuum oven at 45±1°C.<br>
The above steps result in white copra/snow white coconut kernel which is highly attractive. It was subjected to size reduction and was ground coarsely in waring blender to obtain a particle size of 10 mesh (BSS) size and extracted with food grade hexane at room temperature. Hexane was added in the proportion of meal: solvent ratio of 1:1.5 (w/v) so that the material is just covered with the solvent. After an extraction period of 2 hrs, the miscella<br><br>
(oil + solvent) is drained off. The material was again extracted with hexane with a meal to solvent ratio of 1:1. Three such extraction was carried out. The combined extract was distilled off under vacuum to recover oil and hexane. The oil so obtained was colorless and pure white of a high quality which can be used in variety of pharmaceutical preparations such as emulsions, syrups, cented hair oil etc. and also for the manufacture of high quality lauric soaps and detergents. The protein rich flour fraction obtained in the above process is pure white and is of very high quality. This can go directly for human consumption, and for variety of formulations.

The yield of snow-white coconut kernel/copra in all the five experiments were in the range of 94.5 to 95.5%.<br>
These studies indicate that treatment with 3N HC1 at 99±3°C for 5-7 min is the most satisfactory method for the complete separation of the phenolic components, to produce pearl white/snow-white coconut/copra.<br>
The lauric rich coconut oil and protein-rich fraction manufactured by the process of the present invention is high quality. Hence, the lauric-rich coconut oil free from phenolic constituents can be used for various types of pharmaceutical applications such as emulsions, syrups, cented-hair oil, lathering- soaps and detergents while the protein-rich fraction which is free from dark brown coloured particles and other colouring impurities and can directly be used for product development for high utility purpose.<br>
The process of the invention results in pearl white and snow white copra/coconut kernel without any dark brown testa particles thereby increasing the overall value of the product. The superior quality white copra/coconut can be easily disintegrated to the desired particle size and can be dried under controlled conditions, and further processed either by expeller press or by solvent extraction methodology to obtain superior high grade speciality (1) Lauric oil and (2) protein-rich fraction.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
