PHOTOACTIVE POLYMER;<br>
ROLIC AG, A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF SWITZERLAND, WHOSE ADDRESS IS CHAMERSTRASSE 50, 6301 ZUG, SWITZERLAND;<br>
GRANTED<br><br><br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY	DESCRIBES	AND<br>
ASCERTAINS THE NATURE OF THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFOMED.<br><br>
25-1-2007<br><br>
Photoactive polymer<br>
5 The present invention relates to a photoactive polymer<br>
based on polyimides, polyamic acids and esters thereof and their use as orientation layers for liquid crystals and in the construction of unstructured and structured optical elements and multi-layer systems.<br>
10<br>
The successful functioning of a liquid crystal device depends on the ability of the liquid crystal molecules within that device to adopt and maintain an imposed align¬ment. Alignment of the liquid crystal molecules is achieved<br>
15 by use of an orientation layer which defines a direction of orientation for the liquid crystal molecules of the device with the result that the longitudinal axes of the molecules become aligned with the direction of orientation defined by the orientation layer. In addition to this directional<br>
20 alignment, the orientation layer is also able to impart to the liquid crystal molecules an angle of tilt so that the molecules align themselves at an angle to the surface of the orientation layer rather than lying parallel hereto.<br>
25 Tilt angles from 1° to 15° are usual for nematic liquid<br>
crystal displays (LCDs). Some electro-optical effects used for LCDs however require alignment layers with very high pretilt angles. Vertically aligned nematic (VAN) LCDs for instance require pretilt angles between 85° and 30°, meas-<br>
3 0 ured from the surface plane. In the case of hybrid aligned nematic (HAN) LCDs, the pretilt angle at one of the sub-<br><br>
strates has to be in the above range, whereas the tilt angle at the other substrate is low (typically 0° to 10°). Methods of preparing structured and unstructured orienta¬tion layers are well known to a skilled person. Customarily 5 used uniaxially rubbed polymer orientation layers such as, for example, polyimides however impact a series of disad¬vantages like dust generation during the rubbing process, destruction of thin film transistors and lack of structur¬ing ability. Furthermore, the rubbing process does not 10 allow the production of structured layers.<br>
Orientation layers in which the direction of orientation can be predetermined by irradiation with polarized light have been known for some time. It is by that means possible<br>
15 to avoid the problems inherent to the rubbing process. In addition, it is possible to provide areas having different orientation and thus to structure the orientation layer as described for example in Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., 31 (1992), 2155-64 (Schadt et al.). In that process the dimerisation<br>
20  of polymer-bonded photoactive cinnamic acid groups induced by irradiation with linearly polarized light is employed leading to an anisotropic polymer network. Those photo-oriented polymer networks can be used wherever structured or unstructured liquid crystal orientation layers are<br>
25  required.<br>
In addition to their use in LCDs,   such orientation layers can also be used,   for example,   in the production of so-called hybrid layers,   as exemplified for instance in 30     European patent applications EP-A-0611981,   EP-A-0689084 (both F.   Hoffmann-La Roche AG)   and WO-A-98/52077 (Rolic AG).  Using those hybrid layers of photostructurable orientation polymers and crosslinkable  low; molecular weight<br><br>
liquid crystals it is possible to realize optical elements such as, for example, non-absorptive color filters, linear and circular polarizers, optical delay layers and so on.<br>
5 EP-A-0611786 and WO-A-96/10049 (both P. Hoffmann-La Roche AG) , as well as EP-A-0763552 (Rolic AG), describe cinnamic acid polymers that are suitable in principle for the synthesis of such anisotrapically crOsslinked,  phato-structured orientation layers for liquid crystals. In the<br>
10 case of the compounds described in EP-A-0763552 and<br>
WO-A-96/10049, on irradiation with linearly polarized light it is possible to induce, in addition to the desired orientation, simultaneously an angle of tilt. This allows the production of layers having structuring in respect of<br>
15 surface orientation and angle of tilt.<br>
The above photostructurable orientation layers have the disadvantage, however, that for certain applications, especially for use in Thin Film Transistor (TFT) displays,<br>
20 they result in adjacent liquid crystal mixture having an<br>
insufficient electrical resistivity value. In TFT displays, a too low resistivity value of the liquid crystal medium leads to an inadequate "holding ratio", which is a measure of the voltage drop in the display after the voltage has<br>
25 been switched off. Low holding ratio values, however, bring about undesirable changes in brightness and contrast over time and thus result in unstable graduations of the grey tones.<br>
30 Recently photoactive materials for orientation layers with improved holding ratios were described in WO-A-99/49360 (Rolic AG), JP-A-10-195296, JP-A-10-232400 (both Samsung Electron Devices Co., Ltd.), WO-A-99/15576 (Rolic AG) and<br><br>
WO -A-99/51662 (Kanegafuchi Kagaku Kogyo KK) . In WO-A-99/49360, JP-A-10-195296 and JP-A-10-232400 blends of polymeric compounds containing photoactive polymers on the one hand and polyimides on the other hand are proposed. A 5 disadvantage of such blends is their limited miscibility. Low contents of photoactive polymers however lead to a loss of orienting properties and consequently to a reduced contrast ratio of liquid crystal layers to be oriented whereas a reduced polyimide content results in insufficient 10 holding ratios. In WO-A-99/15576 and WO-A-99/51662<br>
polyimides incorporating photoactive cinnamate groups in their side chains are described. WO-A-99/15576 discloses photoactive polymers which contain as side-chains photo-crosslinkable groups of the following formula:<br>
15<br><br>
These polyimides are said to combine the photoreactivity of the cinnamic acid skeletal structure and sufficiently high<br>
2	0 holding ratios. There is no teaching of the improvement of<br>
the orientation of liquid crystals. A problem with the polyimides is their poor solubility in the most organic solvents that make them difficult to process.<br>
25 The ability of the resulting orientation layers to perform their function depends, in part, on the number of molecules in the layer that have been isomerised and/or dimerised as a result of irradiation with linearly polarized light. The extent to which the molecules are isomerised and/or<br>
3	0 dimerised relies, in part, on the irradiation time, the<br><br>
irradiation energy and the structure of the molecules being irradiated.<br>
However, a problem with many polymers currently used in the 5 preparation of photo-oriented orientation layers is that relatively long irradiation times are required to make efficient isomerisation and/or dimerisation of the compo¬nent molecules.<br>
10 Consequently, there is a need for stable photoalignable materials with short irradiation time, sufficiently high holding ratios and good processability. The present invention addresses that need and provides photoactive polymers of good processability that, when irradiated over<br>
15 a relatively short time with polarized light, result in stable, high-resolution patternable orientation layers having angle of tilt, which at the same time allow sufficiently high holding ratios in the adjacent liquid crystal medium.<br>
20<br>
The inventors have found that polyimides incorporating as side-chains dendritic blocks with photoactive groups at their surface provide photoalignable materials  which are advantageous with respect to at least  one of  the above<br>
25    requirements.   The illumination of these compounds with<br>
linearly polarized light results in excellent  orientation capability for liquid crystals,   in sufficiently high holding ratio and simultaneously allows pre-tilt angles up to 90°.   At  the same time,   the  introduction of  a dendritic<br>
3 0    block improves solubility and processability.<br>
A first  aspect of the present  invention therefore provides photoactive polymers   from the  class of polyimides,<br><br>

3 0    The group J may be divalent,   trivalent or tetravalent.  When J is divalent,   it serves  to link the groups S4 and S5,   S6 and S7 or S8  and N respectively of  the groups IV to IX.   It will be appreciated that when J is a divalent group,   the<br><br>
monomer unit of which it forms a part is not linked to a side chain group of formula la, lb or combination of them. When J is a trivalent or a tetravalent group, it serves to link the monomer unit, of which it forms a part, to one or 5 two side chain groups of formulae la, lb or combination of them respectively. It is preferred that the photoactive polymer comprises less than 75 % of monomer units including a divalent group J, preferably less than 50 % and espe¬cially less than 30 %. Monomer units comprising a trivalent 10 group J are preferred.<br>
The building blocks of the formulae V, VII and IX are amic acid groupings or amic acid ester groupings (i.e. carboxamide-carboxylic acid groupings or carboxamide-<br>
15 carboxylic acid ester groupings) which on the one hand may occur as a result of incomplete imidisation in the polyimide chain. On the other hand, polymers that consist only of building blocks of formulae V, VII or IX, that is to say polyamic acids or polyamic acid esters, are<br>
20 important precursors for the preparation of the polyimides according to the invention and are also included in the present invention. Of those polymers which contain groups of formulae V, VII or IX, preference is given to those in which G is hydrogen, that is to say those which consist<br>
25 exclusively of, or contain some, polyamic acid groups.<br>
The polymers of the invention may be prepared using methods that are known to a person skilled in the art and.a second aspect of the invention provides a method of preparing a 30 compound as defined above.<br>
Polyamic acids and polyimides of the present invention may be prepared in accordance with known methods, such as those<br><br>
described in Plast.   Eng.  .36 (1996) (Polyimides, fundamen¬tals and applications).<br>
For example, the polycondensation reaction for the prepara-5  tion of the polyamic acids is carried out in solution in a<br>
polar aprotic organic solvent, such as y-butyrolactone, N,N- dime thylacet amide, N-methylpyrrolidone or N, N- dime thy 1-formamide. In most cases equimolar amounts of the dian-hydride and the diamine are used, that is to say one amino<br>
10 group per anhydride group. If it is desired to stabilise the molecular weight of the polymer, it is possible for that purpose to add an excess or a less-than-stoichiometric amount of one of the two components or to add a monofunc-tional compound in the form of a dicarboxylic acid monoan-<br>
15 hydride or in the form of a monoamine. Examples of such monofunctional compounds are maleic acid anhydride, phthalic acid anhydride, aniline and so on. The reaction is carried out preferably at a temperature of less than 100 °C.<br>
20<br>
The cyclisation of the polyamic acids to form the polyimides can be carried out by heating, that is to say by condensation with removal of water or by other imidisation reactions with reagents. When carried out purely thermally,<br>
2	5 the imidisation of the polyamic acids is not always<br>
complete, that is to say the resulting polyimides may still contain proportions of polyamic acid. The imidisation reactions are generally carried out at a temperature of from 60 to 250 °C, but preferably at less than 200 °C. In<br>
3	0 order to achieve imidisation at rather lower temperatures<br>
there are additionally mixed into the reaction mixture reagents that facilitate the removal of water. Such<br><br>
reagents are, for example, mixtures consisting of acid anhydrides, such as acetic acid anhydride, propionic acid anhydride, phthalic acid anhydride, trifluoroacetic acid anhydride, and tertiary amines, such as triethylamine, 5  trimethyl amine, tributylamine, pyridine, N,N- dimethyl -aniline, lutidine, collidine etc. The amount of reagents used in that case is preferably at least two equivalents of amine and four equivalents of acid anhydride per equivalent of polyamic acid to be condensed. 10<br>
The imidisation reaction can be carried out before or alternatively only after application to a support.<br>
The polyamic acids and the polyimides of the present 15  invention have an intrinsic viscosity preferably in range of 0.05 to 10 dL/g, more preferably 0.05 to 5 dL/g. Herein, the intrinsic viscosity  is determined by<br>
measuring a solution containing a polymer in a concentra¬tion of 0.'5 g/100 ml for its viscosity at 30 °C using 20 .N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as solvent.<br>
The polyamic acid chains or polyimide chains of the present invention preferably contain from 2 to 2000 monomer units, especially from 3 to 200.<br>
25<br>
Additives such as silane-containing compounds and epoxy-containing crosslinking agents may be added to the polymers of the invention in order to improve the adhesion of the polymer-to a substrate. Suitable silane-containing<br>
30  compounds are described in fast.  Eng.   36 (1996)<br>
(Polyimides, fundamentals and applications). Suitable<br>
epoxy-containing crosslinking agents include<br>
4,4' -methylenebis {Nt W-diglycidylaniline) , trimethylol-<br><br>
propane triglycidyl ether,. benzene-1, 2, 4,.5-tetracarboxylic . acid 1,2:4, 5-N,N'-diglycidyldiimide, polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, N, N-diglycidylcyclohexylamine and the like. 5<br>
Further additives such as a photosensitiser, a photoradical generator and/or a cationic photoinitiator may also be added to the polymers of the invention. Suitable photo¬active additives include 2,2-dimethoxyphenylethanone, a 10 mixture of diphenylmethanone and N,N-dimethylbenzenamine or ethyl 4-(dimethylamino)benzoate, xanthone, thioxanthone, IRGACDRE™ 184, 369, 500, 651 and 907 (Ciba) , Michler' s ketone, triaryl sulfonium salt and the like.<br>
15 The polymers according to the invention may be used alone or in combination with other polymers, oligomers, monomers, photoactive polymers, photoactive oligomers and/or photo¬active monomers, depending upon the application to which the polymer layer is to be put. It will therefore be .<br>
20 appreciated that by varying the composition of the polymer layer it is possible to control properties such as an induced pretilt angle, good surface wetting, high voltage holding ratio, a specific anchoring energy etc.<br>
25 Polymer layers may be readily prepared from the polymers of the present invention and a third aspect of the invention provides a polymer layer comprising a polymer according to the present invention in a crosslinked form. The polymer layer is preferably prepared by applying one or more<br>
3 0 polymers according to the invention to a support and, after any imidisation step which may be necessary, crosslinking the polymer or polymer mixture by irradiation with linearly polarised light. It is possible to vary the direction of<br><br>
orientation and the tilt angle within the polymer layer by controlling the direction of irradiation of the linearly polarised light. It will be appreciated that by selectively irradiating specific regions of the polymer layer it is 5 possible to align very specific regions of the layer and provide layers with a defined angle of tilt. This orientation and tilt is retained in the polymer layer by the process of crosslinking.<br>
10 It will be appreciated that the polymer layers of the<br>
present invention can also be used as orientation layers for liquid crystals and a preferred embodiment of the third aspect of the invention provides an orientation layer comprising one or more polymers according to the invention<br>
15  in a crosslinked form. Such orientation layers can be used in the manufacture of optical constructional elements, preferably in the production of hybrid layer elements.<br>
The orientation layers are suitably prepared from a 20 solution of the polymer material. The polymer solution is applied to a support optionally coated with an electrode (for example a glass plate coated with indium-tin oxide<br>
(ITO) ) so that homogeneous layers of 0.05 to 50 urn thickness are produced. In this process different coating<br>
25 techniques like spincoating, miniscuscoating, wirecoating, slotcoating, offsetprinting, flexoprinting, gravurprinting may be used. Then, or optionally after prior imidisation, the regions to be oriented can be irradiated, for example, with a high-pressure mercury vapour lamp, a xenon lamp or a<br>
3 0 pulsed UV laser, using a polarizer and optionally a mask for creating images of structures. The irradiation time is dependent upon the output of the individual lamps and can vary from a few seconds to several hours. The dimerisation<br><br>
can also be carried out, however, by irradiation of the homogeneous layer using filters that, for example, allow only the radiation suitable for the crosslinking reaction to pass through. 5<br>
It will be appreciated that the polymer layers of the invention may be used in the production of optical or electro-optical devices having at least one orientation layer as well as unstructured and structured optical 10 elements and multi-layer systems.<br>
A further embodiment of the third aspect of the invention provides an optical or electro-optical device comprising one or more polymers according to the first aspect of the 15  invention in crosslinked form. The electro-optical devices may comprise more than one layer. The or each of the orientation layer3 may contain one or more regions of different spatial orientation.<br>

Production of an orientation layer<br>
A 2 % solution of Polyamic Acid 1 in cyclopentanone was filtered over a 0.2 μm  Teflon filter and applied to a glass<br>
10 plate, which had been coated v/ith indium-tin oxide (ITO) , in a spin-coating apparatus at 3000 rev. /min. in the course of 60 seconds. The resulting film was then predried for 15 minutes at 130 °C and then imidised for 1 hour at 200 °C to form the polyimide.<br>
15<br>
The glass plate so coated was then irradiated for 3 0 seconds with the linearly polarized UV light of a 350 W high-pressure mercury vapor lamp. A liquid-crystalline mixture CB-483 from Vantico was then applied by<br>
20 spin-coating to the irradiated layer and subsequently<br>
crosslinked by isotropic UV light for 5 minutes. Under a polarization microscope, a uniaxially double-refractive layer of oriented liquid crystal molecules was observed and a contrast ratio as high as 1800:1 was measured. Using a<br>
25  tilt compensator it was ascertained that the direction of orientation agreed with the direction of polarization of the UV light used for the polyimide layer irradiation.<br><br>
Example 11:<br>

of tilt<br>
5 Two glass plates coated with Polyamic Acid 1 as in<br>
Example 10 were irradiated for 3 0 seconds with linearly polarized UV light, the direction of incidence of the light being inclined by 40° relative to the plate normal. The direction of polarization of the light was kept in the<br>
10 plane defined by the direction of incidence of the light and the plate normal. From both plates a cell of 2 0 μm spacing was built such that the illuminated surfaces were facing each other and the previous polarization directions of illumination were parallel. The cell was then filled<br>
15 with liquid crystal mixture MLC12000-000 from Merck in the isotropic phase at 100 °C. The cell was then gradually cooled to room temperature at a rate ranging from 0.1 °C/min to 2 °C/min. Between crossed polarizers a uni¬formly oriented liquid crystal layer was observed. The tilt<br>
20 angle of this parallel cell, by crystal rotation method, was 12°.<br>
Example 12: 25 Determination of the voltage holding ratio (VHR)<br>
Two glass plates coated in accordance with Example 10 were irradiated perpendicularly during 3 0 seconds with linearly polarized UV light. From both plates a cell of 10 μm 3 0 spacing was built such that the illuminated surfaces were facing each other and the previous polarization directions of illumination were parallel. This cell was then main-<br><br>
tained at 12 0 °C tinder high vacuum for 14. hours and there¬after filled with TFT liquid crystal mixture MLC12 000-0 00 from Merck in vacuo  at room temperature. Between crossed polarizers a uniformly oriented liquid crystal layer was 5 observed. Prior to testing the voltage holding ratio (VKR) the cell was first subjected to ageing for 50 hours at 12 0 °C. The voltage decay V (at T = 20 ms) of a voltage surge of 64 \is  with Vo (V at t = 0) = 0.2 V was then measured over a period of T = 20 ms. The voltage holding 10 ratio then determined, given by VHR = Vrms (t = T)/V0, was 96  % at room temperature.<br><br>
