SYSTEM FOR CONTROLLING EVAPORATIVE EMISSIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to internal combustion engines,<br>
and more particularly to a system for controlling engine emissions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Internal combustion engines combust an air/fuel (A/F)<br>
mixture within cylinders to drive pistons and to provide drive torque. Air is<br>
delivered to the cylinders via a throttle and an intake manifold. A fuel injection<br>
system supplies fuel from a fuel tank to provide fuel to the cylinders based on<br>
a desired A/F mixture. To prevent release of fuel vapor, a vehicle may include<br>
an evaporative emissions system which includes a canister that absorbs fuel<br>
vapor from the fuel tank, a canister vent valve, and a purge valve. The<br>
canister vent valve allows air to flow into the canister. The purge valve<br>
supplies a combination of air and vaporized fuel from the canister to the intake<br>
system.<br>
[0003] Closed-loop control systems adjust inputs of a system based<br>
on feedback from outputs of the system. By monitoring the amount of oxygen<br>
in the exhaust, closed-loop fuel control systems manage fuel delivery to an<br>
engine. Based on an output of oxygen sensors, an engine control module<br>
adjusts the fuel delivery to match an ideal A/F ratio (14.7 to 1). By monitoring<br>
engine speed variation at idle, closed-loop speed control systems manage<br>
engine intake airflows and spark advance.<br>
[0004] Typically, the fuel tank stores liquid fuel such as gasoline,<br>
diesel, methanol, or other fuels. The liquid fuel may evaporate into fuel vapor<br>
which increases pressure within the fuel tank. Evaporation of fuel is caused<br>
by energy transferred to the fuel tank via radiation, convection, and/or<br>
conduction. An evaporative emissions control (EVAP) system is designed to<br>
store and dispose of fuel vapor to prevent release. More specifically, the<br><br>
GP-307684-PTE-CD<br>
2<br>
EVAP system returns the fuel vapor from the fuel tank to the engine for<br>
combustion therein.<br>
[0005] The EVAP system includes an evaporative emissions<br>
canister (EEC) and a purge valve. When the fuel vapor increases within the<br>
fuel tank, the fuel vapor flows into the EEC. A purge valve controls the flow of<br>
the fuel vapor from the EEC to the intake manifold. The purge valve may be<br>
modulated between open and closed positions to adjust the flow of fuel vapor<br>
to the intake manifold. Improper operation of the purge valve may cause a<br>
variety of undesirable conditions including, but not limited to, idle surge,<br>
steady throttle surge, and undesirable emission levels.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] A control system for controlling a valve in a fuel system of<br>
engine including an engine airflow sensor that senses a mass engine airflow<br>
(Mengair), a barometric pressure sensor that senses a barometric pressure<br>
(Pbaro), and an ambient temperature sensor that senses an ambient<br>
temperature (Tamb). An actuator determination module determines an effective<br>
area (Aeff) of the valve based on at least one of the Mengair, the Pbaro, and the<br>
Tamb. A duty cycle (DC) calculation module that determines a first duty cycle<br>
(DC) of the valve based on the Aeff.<br><br><br>
GP-307684-PTE-CD<br>
3<br><br>
when the first DC one of exceeds a DC threshold and falls below the DC<br>
threshold, the M2 and the B2 are based on the B1, and the first DC is set equal<br>
to the compensated DC. The B1 is based on at least one of: a manifold<br>
vacuum (MV), the V supplied to the valve, and the Tamb, wherein the MV is<br>
based on a MV equation (Pbaro- P2).<br>
[0009] In other features, the DC calculation module commands the<br>
valve with a first delivered DC when a difference between the first DC and a<br>
second DC exceeds a predetermined comparison threshold, wherein the first<br>
delivered DC is based on the first DC and the second DC. The DC calculation<br>
module commands the valve with a second delivered DC when the difference<br>
between the first DC and the second DC falls below the predetermined<br>
comparison threshold, wherein the first delivered DC is set equal to the<br>
second delivered DC. The second DC is set equal to the first DC.<br>
[0010] In other features, the δ is based on a pressure ratio of the<br>
P1 to the P2. The δ is equal to a δ constant when the pressure ratio falls<br>
below a 8 threshold. δ is based on the P1, the P2, and a δ equation<br>
  when the pressure ratio exceeds a δ<br>
threshold.<br>
[0011] A system for controlling fuel vapor in a fuel system of an<br>
engine includes an engine airflow sensor that senses mass engine airflow<br>
(Mengair). A purge initialization module determines an amount of the fuel vapor<br>
in the fuel system based on an active flow percentage (FPact) and a desired<br><br>
GP-307684-PTE-CD<br>
4<br>
flow percentage (FPdes), wherein the FPact and the FPdes are based on the<br>
Mengair. A purge learn module controls the amount of the fuel vapor in the<br>
engine.<br>
[0012] In other features, The purge initialization module increments<br>
the FPact when the FPact is below the FPdes. The purge initialization module<br>
calculates an adjusted second array value (PLMadj) corresponding to the<br>
Mengair based on an active second array value (PLMact), an active first array<br>
value (LTMact), the FPdes, the FPact, and a PLMadj equation<br>
  The PLMadj, the PLMact, and the<br>
LTMact are multipliers to a fuel rate. The PLMadJ, the PLMact, the LTMact, the<br>
FPact, and the FPdes are indexed by the Mengair.<br>
[0013] In other features, the purge learn module calculates a limited<br>
flow percentage (FPlim) for a predetermined second array threshold (PLMlim)<br>
when the PLMlim exceeds the PLMadj. The purge learn module calculates at<br>
least one second array value (PLM,) based the FP|im, a first array (LTMj), the<br>
LTMact, the PLMact, the FPact, and a limit PLM equation<br>
  . The / represents a<br>
current operating position. The purge learn module sets the FPact equal to the<br>
FPlim, and the learn module decreases the FPact by a predetermined FPact<br>
constant (Y) when the FPdes exceeds the FPact and the PLMlim exceeds the<br>
PLMact, and the purge learn module increases the FPact by the Y when the<br>
FPdes exceeds the FPact and the PLMact exceeds the PLMlim.<br>
[0014] In other features, the purge learn module sets the FPact equal<br>
to the FPdes when the FPact exceeds the FPdes, and wherein the purge learn<br>
module calculates at least one second array value (PLMj) based the LTMi,<br>
LTMact, PLMact, a current position FP (FPj), the FPact, the LTMi and second<br>
array equation <br><br>
GP-307684-PTE-CD<br>
5<br>
[0015] In other features, the system further comprises a threshold<br>
compensation module that determines a second array value (PLMj) when the<br>
amount of sad fuel vapor falls below a fuel vapor threshold. The second array<br>
is a multiplier to a fuel rate. The i represents a current position. The threshold<br>
compensation module determines a threshold flow percentage (FPDCthres)<br>
when a duty cycle (DC) of a valve in the fuel system exceeds a DC threshold,<br>
wherein the FPDCthres is based on a gas constant (C1), a pressure driving<br>
function (S), a corrected pressure (PCorr),-an ambient temperature (Tamb), an<br>
engine airflow (mengair), and a FPthres equation <br>
is calculated based on the Pcorr, a manifold absolute pressure (P2), an air<br>
constant (C1), and the S equation δ = 3.8639(PR1.42857 - PR1.71428)0.5 . The Pcorr<br>
is based on a barometric pressure (Pbaro), a DC threshold, the DC, a second<br>
slope (M2), a second offset (B2), and a first pressure (P1).<br>
[0016] In other features, the threshold compensation module<br>
determines a DC threshold second array value (PLMthres) based on the FPact,<br>
an active first array value (LTMact), the (FPthres), the FPact, and a PLMthres<br>
equation  . The threshold<br>
compensation module determines at least one first array value (LTMj) based<br>
on the PLMi, an active second array value (PLMact), an active first array value<br>
(LTMact), a flow percentage (FPi), the FPact, and a LTMj equation<br>
  when the engine is turned off.<br>
[0017] In other features, the purge initialization module determines<br>
the amount of the fuel vapor when an off time of the engine exceeds an off<br>
time threshold.<br><br>

and/or other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br><br>
GP-307684-PTE-CD<br>
7<br>
[0028] Referring to FIG. 1, a vehicle 10 includes an engine system<br>
12 and a fuel system 14. One or more control modules 16 communicate with<br>
the engine and fuel systems 12, 14. The fuel system 14 selectively supplies<br>
liquid and/or fuel vapor to the engine system 12, as will be described in further<br>
detail below.<br>
[0029] The engine system 12 includes an engine 18, a fuel injection<br>
system 20, an intake manifold 22, and an exhaust manifold 24. Air is drawn<br>
into the intake manifold 22 through a throttle 26. The throttle 26 regulates<br>
mass air flow into the intake manifold 22. Air within the intake manifold 22 is<br>
distributed into cylinders 28. The air is mixed with fuel and the air/fuel (A/F)<br>
mixture is combusted within cylinders 28 of the engine 18. Although two<br>
cylinders 28 are illustrated, it can be appreciated that the engine 18 can<br>
include any number of cylinders 28 including, but not limited to 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8,<br>
10 and 12 cylinders. The fuel injection system 20 includes liquid injectors that<br>
inject liquid fuel into the cylinders 28.<br>
[0030] Exhaust flows through the exhaust manifold 24 and is treated<br>
in a catalytic converter 30. An exhaust oxygen sensor 32 (e.g., a wide-range<br>
A/F ratio sensor) communicates exhaust A/F ratio signals to the control<br>
module 16. A voltage (V) sensor 33 communicates an operating V supplied to<br>
a purge valve 34 to the control module 16. A mass engine air flow (Mengair)<br>
sensor 36 is located within an air inlet and communicates a Mengair signal<br>
based on the mass of air flowing into the engine system 12 to the control<br>
module 16. An intake manifold absolute pressure (P2) sensor 38 senses the<br>
pressure within the intake manifold 22 of the engine and communicates a P2<br>
signal to the control module 16. Ambient temperature (Tamb) and barometric<br>
pressure (Pbaro) signals are generated by Tamb and Pbaro sensors 39, 40,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0031] The control module 16 controls the fuel and air provided to<br>
the engine based on oxygen sensor signals and throttle valve position. This<br>
form of fuel control is also referred to as closed loop fuel control. Closed loop<br>
fuel control is used to maintain the A/F mixture at or close to an ideal<br><br>
GP-307684-PTE-CD<br>
8<br>
stoichiometric A/F ratio by commanding a desired fuel delivery to match the<br>
airflow. Stoichiometry is defined as an ideal A/F ratio (e.g., 14.7 to 1 for<br>
gasoline). The engine control may command different airflow to compensate<br>
the engine speed changes during engine idle operation.<br>
[0032] The engine system 12 operates in a lean condition (i.e.,<br>
reduced fuel) when the A/F ratio is higher than the stoichiometric A/F ratio.<br>
The engine system 12 operates in a rich condition when the A/F ratio is below<br>
the stoichiometric A/F ratio. A fuel control factor helps determine whether the<br>
A/F ratio is within an ideal range (i.e., above a minimum value and below a<br>
maximum value). An exemplary fuel control factor includes a short term<br>
integrator (STI) that provides a rapid indication of fuel enrichment based on<br>
input from the oxygen sensor signals. For example, if the signals indicate an<br>
A/F ratio greater than a specified reference, the STI is increased a step.<br>
Conversely, if the signals indicate an A/F ratio less than the specified<br>
reference, the STI is decreased a step. A fuel control modifier monitors<br>
changes in the fuel control factor over a long term. An exemplary fuel control<br>
modifier includes a long term modifier (LTM). The LTM monitors STI and<br>
uses integration to produce its output.<br>
[0033] The fuel system 14 includes a fuel tank 42 that contains<br>
liquid fuel and fuel vapor. A fuel inlet 44 extends from the fuel tank 42 to<br>
enable fuel filling. A fuel cap 46 closes the fuel inlet 44 and may include a<br>
bleed hole (not shown). A modular reservoir assembly (MRA) 48 is disposed<br>
within the fuel tank 42 and includes a fuel pump 50. The MRA 48 includes a<br>
liquid fuel line 52 and a fuel vapor line 54.<br>
[0034] The fuel pump 50 pumps liquid fuel through the liquid fuel<br>
line 52 to the fuel injection system 20 of the engine 18. A fuel vapor system<br>
includes the fuel vapor line 54 and a canister 56. Fuel vapor flows through<br>
the fuel vapor line 54 into the canister 56. A fuel vapor line 58 connects the<br>
purge valve 34 to the canister 56. The control module 16 modulates the<br>
purge valve 34 to selectively enable fuel vapor to flow into the intake system<br><br>
GP-307684-PTE-CD<br>
9<br>
of the engine 18. The control module 16 modulates a canister vent valve 60<br>
to selectively enable air flow from atmosphere into the canister 56.<br>
[0035] Referring now to FIG. 2, an engine control system 100 will be<br>
described in further detail. The engine control system 100 includes<br>
communicating with the exhaust oxygen sensor 32, the Mengair sensor 36, the<br>
Tamb sensor 39, the P2 sensor 38, the Pbaro sensor 40, and the V sensor 33. A<br>
purge initialization module 70 receives signals from the exhaust oxygen<br>
sensor 32 and the Mengair sensor 36. The purge initialization module 70<br>
captures initialization variables and determines initial purge control conditions<br>
by determining the amount of fuel vapors present within the fuel system 14.<br>
[0036] A purge learn module 72 communicates with the initialization<br>
module 70 and receives signals from the exhaust oxygen sensor 32. The<br>
purge learn module 72 determines an array of purge learn memory (PLM)<br>
values for a current engine operating condition and adaptively learns the PLM<br>
values for the remaining engine operating conditions. The PLM values correct<br>
for errors in the fuel system 14 when the purge valve 34.<br>
[0037] A threshold compensation module 74 receives signals from<br>
the Mengair sensor 36, the Tamb sensor 39, the P2 sensor 38, and the Pbaro<br>
sensor 40. The threshold compensation module 74 communicates with the<br>
purge learn module 72 and the duty cycle (DC) calculation module 80 and<br>
calculates PLM values when the DC of the purge valve 34 has exceeded a<br>
DC threshold. The threshold compensation module 74 stores the PLM values<br>
in a long term memory (LTM) array (not shown) when engine 18 is off.<br>
[0038] A flow variable initialization module 76 receives signals from<br>
the Mengair sensor 36, the Tamb sensor 39, the P2 sensor 38, the Pbaro sensor<br>
40, and the V sensor 33. The flow variable initialization module 76<br>
communicates with the purge initialization module 70 and the DC calculation<br>
module 80. The flow variable initialization module 76 determines the initial<br>
flow variables utilized to control the operation of the purge valve 34.<br><br>
GP-307684-PTE-CD<br>
10<br>
[0039] An actuator determination module 78 communicates with the<br>
flow variable initialization module 76. The actuator determination module 78<br>
determines the characteristics of an actuator (not shown) of the purge valve<br>
34 based on parameters received from the flow variable initialization module<br>
76.<br>
[0040] The DC calculation module 80 communicates with the<br>
actuator determination module 78 and the threshold compensation module<br>
74. The DC calculation module 80 determines the DC of the purge valve 34<br>
for DC operation below the DC threshold and for DC operation that exceeds<br>
the DC threshold. The DC calculation module 80 commands the actuator of<br>
the purge valve 34.<br>
[0041] The engine control system 100 controls the purge valve 34<br>
based on adjustments made to the DC of the purge valve 34 for distinct<br>
actuator characteristics of the purge valve 34 during various engine operating<br>
conditions. The engine control system 100 controls the introduction of purge<br>
flow into of the engine 18 based on the adjusted DC, thereby providing an<br>
accurate control of A/F mixture supplied to the engine 18.<br>
[0042] Referring now to FIG. 3, a method 300 for determining the<br>
flow variables in the engine control system 100 will be described in more<br>
detail. In the present implementation, an exemplary embodiment of the purge<br>
valve 34 will relate to the characteristics and operation of a 95 liters per<br>
minute (LPM) purge valve. Those skilled in the art can appreciate that various<br>
other embodiments of the purge valve 34 are contemplated within the scope<br>
of this invention including, but not limited to, a 71 LPM purge valve. The<br>
method 300 begins in step 302. In step 304, control initializes the purge<br>
control variables by processing signals provided by the Mengair sensor 36, the<br>
Pbaro sensor 40, the P2 sensor 38, the Tamb sensor 39, and the V sensor 33.<br>
Control also initializes DCsecond. Control determines whether the purge control<br>
is enabled in step 306. If control determines that the purge control is not<br>
enabled, control returns to step 304. If control determines that the purge<br>
control is enabled, control proceeds to step 308. In step 308, control<br><br>
GP-3076δ4-PTE-CD<br>
11<br>
determines an active purge flow percentage (FPact). Control can determine<br>
the FPact from sources including, but not limited to, a FPact look-up table (not<br>
shown) and a predetermined purge closed loop equation (not shown). The<br>
FPact look-up table is a function of Mengair. In an exemplary embodiment, FPact<br>
can be approximately 3%, although it should be appreciated that other values<br>
of FPact are anticipated<br>
[0043] In step 310, control calculates a first pressure (P1)<br>
representing the pressure upstream from the inlet of the purge valve 34.<br>
Generally, the pressure experienced by the fuel system 14, Pbaro, is subject to<br>
a drop in pressure as air flows through the purge line 5δ resulting in P1. P1<br>
represents a calculated pressure at the inlet of the purge valve 34. The value<br>
of P1 is determined according the following equation:<br><br>
where K represents a calibrated constant (e.g. 0.173). Although K may be<br>
0.173 in the current example, other values for K are anticipated. In step 312,<br>
control calculates the pressure ratio (PR) of a second pressure (P2) relative to<br>
P1. P2 represents the pressure downstream from the purge valve 34 and is<br>
supplied by the P2 sensor 3δ. In the current invention, P2 acts as a negative<br>
pressure upon the purge valve 34. Once control has determined PR, control<br>
next determines the pressure delta function (δ) in 314. δ represents a<br>
compressible gas characterization. In an exemplary embodiment, δ can<br>
range from 0 to 1. Control can determine δ from sources including, but not<br>
limited to, a δ look-up table (not shown) based on PR and/or a δ equation. δ<br>
can be calculated according to the following equation:<br><br>
Where PRthres represents a pressure ratio threshold and A1 represents an air<br>
constant. In an exemplary embodiment, δ is based on a PRthres of<br>
approximately 0.528. In step 316, the method 300 ends.<br><br>

[0044] Referring now to FIG. 4, a method 400 of determining<br>
actuator characteristics is discussed in more detail. Control begins the<br>
method 400 in step 402. In step 403, control calculates a voltage level<br>
supplied to the purge valve 34. In step 404, control calculates a manifold<br>
vacuum (MV) value. MV is used by control to correct for characteristics of<br>
distinct actuators of the purge valve 34. (P1-P2) represents a force upon the<br>
purge valve 34 that can be approximated by MV. The force results from the<br>
difference between Pbaro delivered to the fuel system 14 and P2 acting<br>
downstream of the purge valve 34. In various embodiments, the purge valve<br>
34 can be pressure compensated, therefore eliminating the need to take into<br>
account MV.<br>
[0045] In step 406, control determines a first base purge valve offset<br>
(B1). Control can determine B1 for various operating conditions from sources<br>
including, but not limited to, a B1 look-up table (not shown). In various<br>
embodiments, the look-up table may be a function of, but is not limited to, MV<br>
and/or operating V. Generally, operation of the purge valve 34 is primarily<br>
affected by V and MV. Typically, the absolute temperature of the fuel vapor<br>
that is estimated by the intake manifold temperature, Tinlet, affects B1 to a<br>
lesser degree. For the sake of simplicity, Tinlet can be assumed to be Tamb. In<br>
an exemplary embodiment, the purge valve 34 operates at approximately 12V<br>
and approximately 20 degrees Celsius. B1 serves as a first offset to a first<br>
linear curve, detailed below, which calculates the valve effective area (Aeff) of<br>
the purge valve 34.<br>
[0046] In step 408, control corrects B1 for changes in temperature as<br>
Tamb of the purge valve 34 varies from 20 degrees Celsius. In step 410,<br>
control calculates a first purge valve duty cycle (DCfirst) for purge valve 34<br>
under operating conditions in which DC does not deviate from linearity (e.g.,<br>
approximately 9δ%). The DC of the purge valve 34 is the ratio of the "on<br>
time," or time the purge valve 34 is open relative to the time of a single cycle<br>
of operation. Generally, DC is expressed as a percentage value. The DC of<br>
the purge valve 34 is calculated as follows:<br><br>
GP-307684-PTE-CD<br>
13<br><br>
[0047] In equations (4) and (5), Aeff represents the effective flow<br>
area across the purge valve 34. The value of Aeff is calculated for each<br>
distinct actuator of the purge valve 34 that may be used in the fuel system 14.<br>
Aeff is a normalized, dimensionless value which ranges from 0 to 1. Aeff can<br>
be characterized by two linear curves that are based on the operation of the<br>
purge valve 34, specifically the duty cycle (DC) of the purge valve 34.<br>
[0048] Mpurge represents the purge mass air flow of the fuel system<br>
14. C1 is a constant that considers factors including, but not limited to, the<br>
area of the purge valve 34, discharge coefficients of the purge system, and/or<br>
thermodynamics characteristics associated with the purge gas. Each purge<br>
valve 34 corresponds to a distinct value of C1. Therefore, if the purge valve<br>
34 implemented in the fuel system 14 is changed, the value of C1 will also be<br>
modified. In the present implementation, C1 can have a value of 5.68. In<br>
various embodiments in which a 71 LPM purge valve 34 is contemplated, C1<br>
can be 4.12. Combining equations (4) and (5) and isolating Aeff leads to:<br><br>
[0049] Where M1 represents a slope characterizing the purge valve<br>
34 while operating below a predetermined DC threshold, which is discussed in<br>
further detail below. Generally, M1 is independent of operating conditions of<br>
the purge valve 34 that contribute to the variance of B1. In various<br>
embodiments of the current invention, the frequency of operation of the purge<br>
valve 34 includes, but is not limited to, 8 Hz, 16 Hz, and/or 32 Hz.<br><br><br>
GP-307684-PTE-CD<br>
14<br><br>
[0051] Referring now to FIG. 5, a method 500 for determining<br>
transient DC compensation will be discussed in more detail. Control begins<br>
the method 500 in step 502. In step 504, control determines whether the<br>
DCfirst calculated in step 410 of method 400 exceeds the DC threshold. In<br>
various embodiments including, but not limited to, the 95 LPM and 71 LPM<br>
purge valves 60, the DC threshold may be 98%. If DCfirst exceeds the DC<br>
threshold, control proceeds to step 506. In step 506, control calculates a<br>
compensated purge valve 34 slope, M2, of a second linear curve that<br>
characterizes the purge valve 34 when DCfirst exceeds the DC threshold.<br>
[0052] Next, control calculates a compensated offset B2 for the<br>
second linear curve in step 508. M2 and B2 are determined as functions of M1<br>
and B1, respectively. The following equation represents the second linear<br>
curve: <br>
In step 510, DCcomp is calculated in similar fashion to DCfirst according to:<br><br>
Upon calculating DCcomp, DCfirst is set equal to DCcomp and control proceeds to<br>
step 512. If DCfirst did not exceed the DC threshold in step 504, control<br>
proceeds to step 512. In step 512, control determines the absolute value of<br>
the difference between DCfirst and DCsecond. If the difference exceeds a<br>
predetermined constant, Z, control proceeds to step 514. In step 514, control<br>
determines a delivered DC (DCdeliv) as a function of DCfirst and DCsecond. The<br>
DCdeliv represents the output DC signal commanding the operation of the<br>
purge valve 34. If the difference between DCfirst and DCsecond does not exceed<br><br>
GP-307684-PTE-CD<br>
15<br>
the predetermined constant Z in step 512, control proceeds to step 516. In<br>
step 516, control sets the DCdeliv to DCfirst. In step 518, control sets DCsecond<br>
equal to DCfirst and transmits DCsecond to 304 of method 300. In step 520,<br>
method 500 ends.<br>
[0053] Now referring to FIGS. 6A and 6B, a method 600, for<br>
initializing purge control is discussed in more detail. Control begins the<br>
method 600 in step 602 when the engine is turned on. In step 604, control<br>
captures the purge initialization variables including the engine off time (tengoff),<br>
engine airflow (Mengair), LTM values, and PLM values. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the LTM and PLM can include, but are not limited to, δ cells.<br>
LTM cells are used to determine the long-term closed loop fuel multiplier<br>
which controls the fuel injectors of the fuel injection system 20 when the purge<br>
valve 34 is off. PLM values are utilized to control the fuel injectors when the<br>
purge valve 34 is on. The value of tengoff represents the lapse of time between<br>
the previous the previous key down of the engine 12 and the current key up of<br>
the engine 12 that occurred in step 602.<br>
[0054] In step 606, control determines whether the purge valve 34<br>
control is enabled. If the purge valve 34 control is not enabled, control<br>
proceeds to step 60δ. In step 60δ, control activates the LTM cell (LTMn)<br>
corresponding to the Mengair measurement provided by the Mengair sensor 36.<br>
The LTM, PLM, and FP are indexed by Mengair. In an exemplary embodiment,<br>
the LTM, PLM, and FP indexing is calibrated identically. Control returns to<br>
step 604. If the purge valve 34 control is not enabled, control proceeds to<br>
610. In 610, control determines whether tengoff exceeds a predetermined tengoff<br>
threshold. tengoff can be, but is not limited to, a time interval equaling<br>
approximately 1 hour. If tengoff does not exceed the predetermined tengoff<br>
threshold, then control activates the appropriate cell of the PLM based on the<br>
Mengair value in step 612. In step 612, control uses values of the PLM that<br>
were obtained during a previous key cycle. Control then advances to step<br>
740 of method 700.<br><br>
GP-307684-PTE-CD<br>
16<br>
[0055] If tengoff exceeds the predetermined tengoff threshold in step<br>
610, the control proceeds to step 614. In step 614, control sets the cells of<br>
the PLM (PLMn) equal to the corresponding cells of the LTM (e.g.,<br>
PLM1=LTM1). In step 616, control activates the PLM cell (PLMact) based on<br>
the Mengair value supplied by the Mengair sensor 36. In various embodiments,<br>
control can reference a look-up table indexed as a function of Mengair-<br>
[0056] In step 618, control clears a purge flow value (x) to avoid<br>
substantial "rich" or "lean" A/F mixture excursions. An A/F ratio below 14.7 is<br>
referred to as a rich mixture while an A/F ratio above 14.7 is called a lean<br>
mixture. An A/F mixture of 14.7 corresponds to the stoichiometric or<br>
chemically correct mixture of gasoline. In step 620, control increments the<br>
purge flow value and then proceeds to calculate actual purge flow percentage<br>
(FPact) in step 622. In various embodiments, the FPact can be computed<br>
according to the following equation:<br>
  (11)<br>
The previous equation progressively increments FPact in order to effectuate a<br>
gradual increase in the level of evaporated gas supplied through the purge<br>
valve 34. In step 624, control initiates a hold of the method 600 to allow for an<br>
accurate reading to be taken of the closed loop integrator (STM) in step 626.<br>
The STM is a multiplier on the fuel rate that determines a switch of fuel<br>
system 14 operating conditions from a rich A/F ratio to a lean A/F ratio and<br>
vice versa based on the oxygen sensor 32. The oxygen sensor 32 is<br>
generally disposed across the exhaust manifold 24 of engine 12. During rich<br>
operation of the fuel system 14, the oxygen sensor 32 transmits a first oxygen<br>
sensor voltage level to control. At lean operation, the oxygen sensor 32<br>
signals a second oxygen sensor voltage.<br>
[0057] In step 628, control determines the desired purge flow<br>
percentage (FPdes) based on Mengair. In step 630, control determines whether<br>
the STM value exceeds a predetermined first STM threshold (Y). If the STM<br>
value does not exceed Y, the control proceeds to step 634. If the STM value<br>
does exceed Y, then control determines whether FPdes exceeds FPact in step<br><br>
GP-307684-PTE-CD<br>
17<br>
632. If FPdes exceeds FPact, control returns to step 620. However, if FPdes<br>
does not exceed FPact, control initiates a second hold of the method 600 to<br>
obtain a PLM response in step 634 after adaptively learning the STM<br>
correction into the PLM. In step 636, control performs a second reading of the<br>
STM.<br>
[0058] Control determines whether the second reading of the STM<br>
exceeds a second STM threshold (Z) in step 638. If the second reading of the<br>
STM does not exceed Z, control returns to step 634. If the second reading of<br>
the STM exceeds Z in step 640, control calculates an adjusted PLM flow<br>
percentage (PLMadj) for current active cell of the PLM according to:<br><br>
where LTMact represents the value stored in the LTM corresponding to the<br>
current active cell. In step 642, the method 600 ends.<br>
[0059] Referring now to FIG. 7, a method 700 for vapor control of<br>
the PLM is discussed in more detail. Control begins the method 700 in step<br>
702. Next, in step 704, control determines whether PLMadj is below a PLM<br>
flow percentage limit (PLMlim). If the PLMadj is below the PLMlim, control<br>
proceeds to step 706. In step 706 control calculates a limited PLM flow<br>
percentage (FPlim) according to:<br><br>
In step 708, control sets a PLM control flag (flagPLM) and proceeds in step 710<br>
to calculate the PLMlim value for each cell of the PLM according to:<br><br>
where i corresponds to the current cell position reference. In step 712, control<br>
sets the FPact equal to the FP|im.<br>
[0060] In step 714, control initiates a hold of the method 700 to<br>
obtain a PLM response. In step 716, control determines whether the STM<br>
value exceeds Z. If the STM value does not exceed Z, control returns to step<br><br>
GP-307684-PTE-CD<br>
18<br>
714. If the STM value exceeds Z, control determines the appropriate FP cell<br>
based on the Mengair in step 718. In step 720, control proceeds to determine<br>
whether FPact is below FPdes. If FPact is below FPdes, control proceeds to step<br>
722. In step 722, control determines whether PLMact is below PLMlim. If<br>
PLMact is below PLMlim, control proceeds to step 724. In step 724, control<br>
decreases FPact by a factor of Y. If PLMact exceeds PLMlim, control proceeds<br>
to step 726. In step 726, control increases FPact by a factor of Y. In step 728,<br>
control signals a second hold of the method 700 to obtain a PLM response<br>
and the proceeds to step 730.<br>
[0061] Referring back to step 720, if the FPact exceeds the FPdes<br>
control proceeds to step 734. In step 734, control clears the flagPLM and<br>
proceeds to step 736. In step 736, control activates a FPact based on the<br>
FPdes. In step 730, control determines whether the absolute STM value<br>
exceeds Z. If the value of the STM does not exceed Z, control returns to<br>
step 728. If the value of the STM does exceed Z, control proceeds to step<br>
732.<br>
[0062] Referring back to step 704, if the PLMadj exceeds the PLMlim,<br>
control proceeds to step 732. In step 732, control computes the PLM value<br>
for each cell of the PLM according to:<br><br>
where i corresponds to the cell position within the PLM. In step 738, control<br>
determines whether the flagPLM is set. If the flagPLM is set, control returns to<br>
step 718. If the flagPLM is not set, control proceeds to step 740. In step 740,<br>
control commands the vapor control based on the FPdes. The method 700<br>
ends in step 742.<br>
[0063] Referring now to FIG. 8, a method δ00 for vapor control<br>
during periods of 100% DC will be discussed in more detail. Control begins<br>
the method 800 in step 802. In step 804, control determines the LTM and<br>
PLM control variables including, but not limited to, Mengair, DCnew, the ignition<br>
key position (keypos), δ , P1, and tbaro. In step 806, control determines whether<br><br>
GP-307684-PTE-CD<br>
19<br>
the purge valve 34 control is enabled. If the purge valve 34 control is not<br>
enabled, control proceeds to 808. In step 808, control activates the LTM cell<br>
(LTMact) corresponding to the Mengair supplied by the Mengair sensor 36 after<br>
which, control advances to step 822.<br>
[0064] If control determines that the purge valve 34 control is<br>
enabled, control proceeds to step 810. In step 810, control activates the PLM<br>
cell (PLMact) corresponding to the Mengair. In step 812, control determines<br>
whether DCdeliv exceeds 100%. If DCdeliv is below 100%, then control<br>
proceeds to step 822. If DCdeiiv exceeds 100%, control proceeds to step 814.<br>
In step 814, control computes a flow corrected P1 (PCOrr) for the FPact<br>
according to: <br>
In step 816, control recalculates δ with the PCOrr supplied by step 814. In step<br>
818, control determines the FPact experienced by the purge valve 34 at 100%<br>
DC according to the following equation:<br><br>
[0065] In step 820, control computes the adjusted PLM (PLM100DC)<br>
while the purge valve 34 is operating at 100% DC according to the following<br>
equation:<br><br>
In step 822, control determines whether the keypos is in an off state. If control<br>
determines that the keypos is not set to off, control returns to step 804. If the<br>
keypos is set to off, control proceeds to step 824. In step 824, control initializes<br>
the cell position reference, i, to zero. In step 826, control increments the cell<br>
position reference. In step 828, control compares the LTM value to the PLM<br>
value for each corresponding cell position. If the value of the LTM is<br><br>
GP-307684-PTE-CD<br>
20<br>
equivalent to the PLM for the current cell, control returns to 826. If the value<br>
of the LTM is not equivalent to the PLM for the current cell, control proceeds<br>
to step in 830. In step 830, control calculates and stores the LTM cell value<br>
based on the corresponding PLM cell according to the following equation:<br><br>
[0066] In step 832, control determines whether i equals the last<br>
reference position of the PLM and LTM. If i does not equal the last position of<br>
the PLM and LTM, control returns to step 826. If i does equal the last position<br>
of the PLM and LTM, control proceeds to step 834. In step 834, control ends.<br>
[0067] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the<br>
foregoing description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
