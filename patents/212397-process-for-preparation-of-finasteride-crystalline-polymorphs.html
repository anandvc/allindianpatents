e)	filtering the solid separated.<br>
The alcohol is methanol, ethanol or isopropyl alcohol; or mixture thereof.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a novel crystalline form of finasteride, designated as Form H2, characterized by an x-ray powder diffraction pattern having peaks expressed as 29 at about 5.4, 9.9, 12.1,14.5,15.2,16.2.19.3. 29,0 degrees. Figure 2 shows typical Form H2 x-ray powder diffraction pattern.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a novel crystalline form of finasteride, designated as Form HI, characterized by an x-ray powder diffraction pattern having peaks expressed as 29 at about 5.3, 5.8, 6.8, 7.3, 9,0, 9.4, 10.7,13.9, 14.9. 15.9,17.3, 18.2, 19.0, 20.1 degrees. Figure 1 shows typical Form HI x-ray powder diffraction pattern.<br><br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for preparation of the Form H1 of finasteride. Thus finasteride is mixed with an alcohol. The suitable alcohol is methanol or ethanol or isopropyl alcohol; or mixture thereof. The previously known forms or finasteride prepared by a known method may be used. The contents are maintained at about 40°C to 60°C for about 10 minutes to 1 hour and then cooled slowly in about 3 hours to about 0°C to 5°C. The contents are maintained for about 1 hour to 3 hours at about 0°C to 5°C, preferably for about 1.5 hours at 0°C. The Form HI of finasteride is separated by filtration.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a novel crystalline form of finasteride, designated as Form H2, characterized by an x-ray powder diffraction pattern having peaks expressed as 26 at about 5.4, 9.9, 12.1,14.5, 15.2,16.2,19,3, 29.0 degrees. Figure 2 shows typical Form H2 x-ray powder diffraction pattern.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for preparation of the Form H2 of finasteride. Thus finasteride is dissolved in dioxane, the solution is heated to about 70°C to 80°C and maintained at this temperature for about 10 minutes to 30 minutes. The solution is cooled slowly, in about 3 hours, to about 20°C to 25°C and maintained at the same temperature for about 2 hours to 4 hours. The separated crystals are filtered to give Form H2 of finasteride. The previously known forms or finasteride prepared by a known method may be used in the process.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising Form HI or Form H2 of finasteride. The forrns of finasteride may be formulated in a form suitable for oral administration or injection.<br>
The following examples are given for the purpose of illustrating the present invention and should not be considered as limitations on the scope or spirit of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Finasteride (10 gm) (obtained by a known method) is dissolved in methanol (25 ml), heated to 55°C and maintained at this temperature for 15 minutes. The solution is slowly cooled to 0°C in 3 hours and maintained at 0°C<br><br>
for 1.5 hours. The separated crystals are filtered at 0°C to give 8.5 gm of Form H1 of finasteride.<br>
Example 2 Finasteride (10 gm) (obtained by a known method) is dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (40 ml), heated to 55°C and maintained at this temperature for 15 minutes. The solution is slowly cooled to 0°C in 3 hours and maintained at 0°C for 1.5 hours. The separated crystals are filtered at 0°C to'give 8.5 gm of Form HI of finasteride.<br>
Example 3 Finasteride (10 gm) (obtained by a known method) is dissolved in dioxane (50 ml), heated the solution to 80°C and maintained at 80°C for 15 minutes. The solution is slowly cooled to 25°C, maintained for 3 hours at 25°C and the solid separated is filtered to give 9 gm of Form H2 of finasteride.<br>
Example 4 Example 1 is repeated using Form H2 of finasteride instead of finasteride to give Form HI of finasteride.<br>
