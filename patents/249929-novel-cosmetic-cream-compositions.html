PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
NOVEL COSMETIC CREAM COMPOSITION<br>
HINDUSTAN   LEVER   LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office <br>
at   Hindustan   Lever  House,      165/166,   Backbay  Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification describes the invention<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to cosmetic cream bases, particularly to improvements on existing vanishing cream <br>
5  bases, and cosmetic cream compositions obtained there from.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification<br>
10 	should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of the common general knowledge in the field.<br>
Vanishing creams remain one of the most widely used cosmetics, as they provide unique sensory and tactile<br>
15 	benefits. These include inter-alia, a dry and matte end-feel, which helps to overcome the oily and shiny appearance of the skin. Vanishing creams spread easily on the skin and get rapidly absorbed therein. Moreover, use of such creams help to reduce the dryness of skin thereby alleviating<br>
20 flakes, cracks and the roughness. Owing to their widespread use, they serve as effective vehicles for delivery of<br>
actives.<br>
2<br><br>
Traditional vanishing creams contain high levels of fatty acid, generally, Stearic acid or a combination thereof with Palmitic acid, typically ranging from 16 to 20 wt %. They also contain salts of fatty acids, generally alkali metal <br>
 5  	soap, which acts as the emulsifier. The emulsifier is<br>
important for physical stability of the product. The soap is formed by in-situ neutralization of a portion of the fatty acid with caustic potash or any other base.<br>
10  Although Vanishing creams offer several benefits as<br>
mentioned above, there are some drawbacks and disadvantages, associated with their use. The high level of fatty acids, typically used in the formulation, poses problems with chemical and physical stability of some actives, especially<br>
15  acidic actives. Therefore, some attempts were made in the<br>
past, to make vanishing creams with relatively low levels of fatty acids. The present inventors have observed that, on reducing fatty acids, certain consumer desired sensory benefits, such as rub-in effect, and the viscosity of the<br>
20  cream are adversely affected. In addition to the above, it is known that in vanishing creams containing high levels of<br>
stearic acid, especially containing high levels of actives such as Niacinamide, the end-feel and sensorial aspects of the cream are also adversely affected.<br>
3<br><br>
US 2005/0036971 (Beiersdorf, AG) describes pearlescent cosmetic compositions containing upto 12 wt% fatty acids. A portion of the fatty acids is neutralized to form alkali metal salts. The composition includes associative polymers,<br>
 5  amphiphilic polymers and fatty alcohols as other major ingredients, to meet the desired product attributes. Amphiphilic polymers and associative polymers are specialty materials. Their usage in cosmetics is likely to offset the benefits by an increase in cost.<br>
10<br>
The present inventors have found that vanishing creams containing relatively lower amount of fatty acid can be made by including particulate matter selected from talc, starch or its derivatives, along with a relatively higher amount<br>
15  of fatty acid soap, without significantly affecting the above-mentioned benefits desired by the consumers. The present inventors have also found that on application of the composition to the skin, an instant glow is observed, which is a much sought-after product attribute.<br>
20<br>
A combination of talc and fatty acids in cosmetic compositions has been reported, inter-alia for make-up creams, foundation creams and soaps. Such cream formulations generally require very high content of talc, which ranges<br>
4<br><br>
from 10 to 30%, and low amount of fatty acids, typically less than 5%.<br>
US 4800076 (1989, Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Products, Inc) <br>
5  	describes skin care compositions in the form of creams and<br>
lotions containing very low amounts of fatty acids and significantly higher amounts of talc, with a specific ratio of non-volatile ingredients to talc. It is said to enhance the desired characteristics of the skin care compositions.<br>
10  The teaching of this patent cannot be extended to vanishing cream compositions, as this patent essentially describes cosmetic compositions containing relatively higher amount of talc. There is no specific disclosure relating to fatty acid based vanishing creams and the optimal balance between fatty<br>
15   acids and talc to be incorporated therein.<br>
The present inventors have provided a solution to a problem in the area of fatty acid based vanishing creams. In addition, the reduction of Stearic acid with a corresponding <br>
20  	increase in levels of particulate matter, which is a<br>
relatively inexpensive raw material, would also lead to substantial savings in the cost of raw materials.<br>
5<br><br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art vanishing cream bases, or to provide a useful <br>
 5  	alternative.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a cream base including relatively lower amount of fatty acids, without significantly affecting the sensory benefits <br>
10  	associated with their use.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a vanishing cream composition including relatively lower amount of fatty acids, without adversely affecting the<br>
15  	viscosity of the cream composition.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a vanishing cream composition that enhances the brightness of the skin. <br>
20<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a vanishing cream composition that is capable of incorporation<br>
and delivery of relatively higher levels of benefit agents, while retaining the essential sensory attributes.<br>
6<br><br>
These and other objects of the present invention will become more readily apparent from consideration of the following summary and detailed description.<br>

Procedure<br>
Phase-A ingredients were heated to 75°C. Phase-B was heated to 75°C in a container, separate from that of Phase-A. Phase B was added to phase A at 75°C and stirred for 20 minutes <br>
5  	followed by the addition of phase C at 70°C. The temperature was reduced to 55°C and slurry of Talc in water was added. Thereafter, the phases were combined, while mixing, with the heat being turned off. Phase-E was heated to 50°C and mixed<br>
into phases A and B. The mixture was cooled to 40°C and then <br>
10  	the minor ingredients were added. The formulation was cooled to 35°C and packed.<br>
Viscosity of the compositions was measured and the results have been included in table-2 above. Composition-1 is the<br>
15  	control product, which has ideal viscosity and other<br>
desirable product attributes. It will be apparent that viscosity of compositions 2 and 3 was very low and below acceptable limits, while composition 6 was found to be watery in consistency. Viscosity of composition 5 was within<br>
20  	acceptable limits, but the product felt draggy feel on the skin and therefore, it could not spread easily upon application.<br>
18<br><br>
Hysteric acid is a commercially available product, which is a 55:45 mixture of Palmitic acid and Stearic acid. The average equivalent weight of Hysteric acid is 270 g/equivalent. Therefore, 270 g of this product reacts with a <br>
5  	stoichiometrically equivalent amount i.e. 56.1 g of<br>
Potassium hydroxide (KOH), forming 308g of Potassium salt of Hysteric acid (soap).<br>
Therefore, in the above compositions, Hysteric acid would <br>
10  	react with the Potassium hydroxide to form some soap of<br>
Hysteric acid and the unreacted Hysteric acid would remain in the fatty acid form in the composition. Based on this calculation, the amount of Hysteric acid and Potassium salt of Hysteric acid (soap), in the compositions 2 to 6 were <br>
15   calculated and have been indicated in table-3 below.<br>

19<br><br>
It is apparent that compositions 2, 3, 5 and 6 are outside the scope of the invention. On the other hand, composition 4 where the ratio of free acid to soap is 1.68:1, meets the preferred viscosity profile and also provides the desirable <br>
 5  	sensorial benefits. Sensory evaluation of the compositions listed in table-1 by expert panellists indicated that product attributes of composition 1 (control) and that of composition 4 were comparable.<br>
10  	Example-2: Evaluation of product attributes<br>
The composition 4 was evaluated for the product attributes, which are generally desired by the consumers. In an experiment which was conducted with the help of 220 in-house panelists, the individual attributes were tested and rated<br>
15  	vis-à-vis the attributes afforded by use of commercially available skin lightening and skin care creams. Products were distributed amongst all panelists randomly and they used the product for 8 days, with 2 applications on the face, per day. In each application ~0.5g of the product was<br>
20  	used. At the end of 8 days, they were asked to rate the<br>
product that they had used on a scale from 1 to 5, one being low and 5 being high, for the desirable product attributes. The data set was then statistically treated. The results have been compiled and set forth in table -4 below.					<br>
20<br><br>
Table-4<br><br>
Product	FAIR &amp; LOVELYFAIRNESSCREAM	DOVEBEAUTYCREAM	DOVE BODY SILK	Composition 4<br>
Thickness	4.27	4.11	4.16	4.17<br>

Look	4.15	4.08	4.02	4.21<br>
Overall	4.12	4.1	4.12	4.26<br>
It can be seen that the composition according to the invention was rated consistently high on all the desired<br>
5  	product attributes and in some cases; it was rated higher than the other products. Therefore, by using a relatively inexpensive material, it is possible to provide these attributes.<br>
10  	Example-3<br>
Measurement of the brightness index of the cosmetic cream according to the invention and comparison of the same against commercially-available skin lightening vanishing creams.<br>
15<br>
21<br><br>
Experimental Method:<br>
A thin film of the cosmetic cream composition was drawn on LENETA Black/White cards (Form 2A) using a 75 microns applicator. The opacity of this film was measured by using a<br>
5 	HUNTERLAB LABSCAN XE instrument under the following conditions:<br>
D65 Lighting, CIELAB 10 degree color scale. Measured area = 0.7" diameter circle. Reflection mode (45 degrees)<br>
10 	Opacity of the wet film was measured after 5 minutes of application and that of the dried film after 24 hours by placing the film on the machine illumination port. Opacity measurements were done according to standard HUNTERLAB protocol,   i.e.,   comparison  between  Black  and  White<br>
15  	substrates.<br>
The Color measurements were done on White substrates. Results have been included in table-5 below.<br>
Table-5<br><br>
	L* value/ 5 minutes	L* value/ 24 hours<br>
Composition 4	55	45<br>
FAIR &amp; LOVELY 400	56	39<br>
FAIR &amp; LOVELY Multivitamin Cream	51	25<br>
22<br><br>
It will be appreciated that the brightness index, as measured by the L* values indicate that the instant brightness afforded by the cream according to the invention is comparable to conventional commercially available creams,<br>
5  	which are high in Stearic acid content and which are devoid of any talc. It will also be appreciated that the L* values of these commercially available creams decreases significantly after 24 hours, whereas the same value for composition-4 remains appreciably high. This therefore <br>
10  	indicates that the illustrated composition provides for<br>
instant glow as well as retains the same for an appreciable amount of time.<br>
It will be appreciated that the illustrated example, <br>
15  	provides for a vanishing cream composition including relatively lower amount of fatty acids, without significantly affecting the sensory benefits associated with their use and viscosity of the product.<br>
20  	It will also be appreciated that the illustrated example,<br>
provides for a vanishing cream composition that enhances the<br>
brightness of the skin.<br>
23<br><br>
In use, a small quantity of the composition, e.g. 1 to 5 ml, is applied to exposed areas of the skin, from a suitable container or applicator, and if necessary, it is then spread over and/or rubbed into the skin using the hand or fingers.<br>
5<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments,  it will be  appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in many other forms. <br>
