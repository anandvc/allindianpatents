Title of the Invention:<br><br>
â€œPropofol      Emulsion      Compositions     for Intravenous Administration "<br><br>
Applicant(s):<br>
(a)	Name<br>
(b)	Nationality<br>
(c)       Address<br><br>
BHARAT SERUMS &amp; VACCINES LTD.<br>
An Indian company incorporated under the Companies Act 1956.<br>
16th Floor, Hoechst House Nariman Point Mumbai 400 021. Maharashtra, India<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
This invention relates to Propofol oil-in-water emulsion composition for intravenous administration. This invention particularly relates to Propofol in oil-in-water emulsion composition having compounds capable of preventing proliferation of any accidental extrinsic contamination of the composition during prolonged administration.<br>
Background and Prior arts<br>
Propofol (2,6-Diisopropylphenol) is a well-known and widely used intravenous anesthetic agent. Propofol administration is painful; therefore Propofol is diluted with oils and provided as oil-in-water type emulsion for intravenous injections.<br>
The Propofol / soybean oil emulsion has gained widespread use for induction and/or maintenance of anesthesia, for maintenance of monitored anesthesia care and for sedation in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). It is advantageous in that it possesses both a rapid onset anesthesia and a short recovery time.<br>
Intravenous Propofol emulsion compositions are continuously infused for sedation of seriously ill patients. However, the presence of vegetable oils and phospholipids makes the emulsion highly prone to the risk of microbial growth due to adventitious extrinsic contamination especially during long term use in patients undergoing ICU sedation.<br>
There are noscomial (i.e. hospital acquired) infections observed very often in ICU patients. Microbial contamination of total intravenous nutritional emulsion formulation supplements, administered through infusion sets, is recognized as one of the main reasons of noscomial infection among ICU patients. Hence it is recommended that the intravenous administration sets be changed frequently, at least every 6 or 12 hours. Continuous infusion makes the product susceptible to microbial growth.<br>
2<br><br>
In order to reduce the risk of uncontrolled microbial growth, additions of various potential preservatives into intravenous Propofol emulsion compositions have been tried. Some of the potential agents found to cause instability of the emulsion. Other potential agents failed to provide the level of antimicrobial activity being sought. It is necessary to preserve the compositions with preservatives that would provide the required levels of antimicrobial activity at as low a concentration as possible in order to minimise the potential for physical instability and to minimise toxicity concerns.<br>
US 5714520, (1998) discloses an oil-in-water emulsion of Propofol containing an edetate as an antimicrobial agent.<br>
Edetate has been shown to delay but not to prevent the onset of microbial growth in Propofol emulsions (see WO-A-00/24376, infra). Propofol emulsion compositions are required to be diluted up to 5 times (1:4) for long-term infusion. On dilution the edetate concentration gets reduced to 0.0011%. Edetate alone is found to be ineffective in preventing a no more than 10 fold increase in broad-spectrum microbial growth at concentrations of 0.0025% and below (see US-A-6028108; infra).<br>
Edetate acting as a preservative in this formulation is a metal ion chelator that removes essential trace elements like zinc. This can be potentially dangerous to patients who are administered Propofol for a prolonged duration as it will cause deficiency of zinc in certain individuals. Even the manufacturer of this product recommends supplemental zinc therapy to overcome the untoward effects.<br>
US 6469069 (2002): An oil-in-water emulsion of Propofol containing a sulphite as an antimicrobial agent has been described in this patent. The amount of sulphite preferably is in the range 0.0075% to 0.66% by weight.<br>
3<br><br>
The use of sulphite has two problems; viz. (a) stability of the emulsion is affected and (b) it is potentially toxic material at little higher dose level.<br>
US 6028108 (2000): An oil-in-water emulsion of Propofol containing a pentetate as an antimicrobial agent has been described in this patent. Pentetate, as used herein, refers to diethylene triamine pentaacetate or "DTPA", and derivatives thereof. In general suitable derivatives of DTPA are those salts having lower affinity for DTPA than calcium. Particular derivatives include but are not limited to calcium trisodium pentetate.<br>
The invention is a sterile pharmaceutical composition for parenteral administration comprising an oil-in-water emulsion of Propofol and an amount of pentetate sufficient to prevent significant growth of microorganisms for at least 24 hours after adventitious extrinsic contamination.<br>
Pentetate acting as a preservative in this formulation is a metal ion chelator that removes cations like calcium, magnesium and zinc. This can be potentially dangerous to patients who are administered Propofol for a prolonged duration.<br>
US 6140373 &amp; US 6140374, (both 2000) discloses an oil-in-water emulsion of Propofol containing an antimicrobial agent selected from (a) benzyl alcohol alone or, preferably, together with either sodium edetate or sodium benzoate and (b) benzethonium chloride.<br>
For long-term use, the antimicrobial agents such as benzyl alcohol and benzethonium chloride are not recommended as they are toxic<br>
US 6177477, (2001) discloses sterile pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration containing Propofol in an oil-in-water emulsion containing tromethamine (i.e. 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol) as an antimicrobial agent. However, tromethamine is known to cause extravasation at the site of<br>
4<br><br>
injection and may cause tissue damage and also is reported to cause respiratory depression. Further, the pH of the composition is highly alkaline and will degrade phospholipids and Propofol on long- term usage.<br>
WO 2006/030450, (2006) discloses Monoglycerides, especially Monolaurin, are used to protect intravenously administrable oil-in-water emulsion compositions against growth of E.coli, P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and C.albicans. The compositions can be medicaments containing lipophilic drugs, especially Propofol, and/or total intravenous nutritional compositions.<br>
This patent discloses use of Monolaurin in Propofol oil-in-water emulsion compositions as a preservative. We are continuing our studies to explore other alternative safe preservatives for Propofol oil-in-water emulsion compositions for intravenous administration.<br>
The possible type and load of the contaminant is variable from time to time and place-to-place and totally unpredictable. A small amount of a preservative may be effective when the contamination is nil or negligibly small. But for adequate precaution larger amount of preservative is used. Hence tests using some selected bacteria and fungi have been considered as adequate to give an indication of minimum quantity of preservative to prevent proliferation of such contaminants. The tendency, however, is towards providing abundant excess of the preservative because, exact minimum amount that will work is not easy to find. It is only an estimate based on these tests. Therefore, it is necessary to fix the maximum amount of the preservative in a composition, in order to avoid any side effects on the patient due to its toxicity. This is also a fairly based estimate because there is no method to find out such a value for safe limits when toxicity of a compound on patients under different pathological state is uncertain.<br>
Propofol compositions with edetate, metabisulphite and benzyl alcohol are commercially available. These materials act as preservatives in a particular<br>
5<br><br>
minimum concentration below which they are not preservatives. At higher levels of usage they are toxic and at lower levels they are ineffective. There is, thus, a need to develop an intravenous Propofol emulsion composition with new safer compounds, in amounts sufficient to prevent proliferation of microorganisms for at least 24 hours.<br>
Object of the Invention:<br>
The principal object of the present invention is to provide an oil-in-water emulsion composition comprising Propofol and safe microbial growth controlling compounds in amounts that will prevent no more than 10 fold increase in the growth of each of staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538) Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), and Candida albicans (ATCC 10231) for at least 24 hours as measured by a test wherein a washed suspension of each organism is added to a separate aliquot of said composition in such quantities to obtain approximately 50 - 250 colony-forming units per ml of the composition and incubated at a temperature in the range of20-25Â°Cand are tested for viable counts of said organisms after 24 hours.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention discloses a Propofol oil-in-water emulsion composition for intravenous administration comprising Propofol, one or more triglyceride oils, purified natural phosphatides, tonicity modifying agents, water and capric acid and / or its water soluble alkali salts as preservative.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention is an oil-in-water emulsion in which Propofol is an active anesthetic agent and capric acid and / or its water soluble alkali salts are preservatives. Triglyceride oils are used for diluting Propofol to reduce pain while administering the Propofol intravenously. And for injecting into blood, for aqueous miscibility, the oil is emulsified in water using natural phosphatides as<br>
6<br><br>
emulsifier, for making it isotonic with blood, tonicity modifying agents are added and for adjustment of pH and for stabilizing the emulsion alkali is used.<br>
In the present invention the amount of capric acid and / or its water soluble alkali salts is provided in sufficient quantity to preserve any accidental contamination of the composition during prolonged administration.<br>
The Propofol oil-in-water emulsion composition for intravenous administration have capric acid and / or its water soluble alkali salts are in amounts sufficient to prevent a no more than 10 fold increase in the growth of each of staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538) Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC9027), and Candida albicans (ATCC 10231) for at least 24 hours as measured by a test wherein a washed suspension of each organism is added to a separate aliquot of said composition in such quantities to obtain approximately 50 - 250 colony-forming units per ml of the composition and incubated at a temperature in the range 20 - 25 Â°C and are tested for viable counts of said organisms after 24 hours.<br>
The compounds used in the composition are described below.<br>
Capric Acid:<br>
Capric acid has not been reported previously as preservative in any oil-in-water emulsion, and particularly in oil-in-water emulsions containing Propofol.<br>
Capric acid is a saturated fatty acid containing C10 carbon atom naturally found in oils and fats. Capric acid is also known as Decanoic acid - CAS No. 334-48-5 having Molecular formula C10H20O2 and Molecular weight 172.27. Capric acid has better anti-fungal properties than monolaurin. Oral LD50 in rats is more than 10,000mg/kg.<br>
7<br><br>
Purified capric acid is preferred. However, presence of small amounts of C8 or C12 or C14 or such fatty acids are acceptable.<br>
When used in Propofol compositions, when pH is adjusted with sodium hydroxide, some capric acid sodium salt may be formed. Alternately sodium caprate i.e. sodium salt of capric acid can also be used to provide required amount of capric acid which will also control the pH.<br>
Salts of Capric acid:<br>
Any pharmaceutically acceptable soluble alkaline salts are useful. These include sodium, potassium and ammonium salts. Of these sodium salt is more useful. Sodium salt is preferred.<br>
Sodium salt of Capric acid commonly known as Sodium decanoate is soluble in water and has a molecular formula of CH3(CH2)8COONa and has molecular weight of 194.25.<br>
Capric acid sodium salt is a white powder. In the present invention it is also found to be a good preservative for the Propofol emulsions. None of the capric acid salts have been previously reported to be useful as preservative in any oil-in-water emulsion, and particularly in oil-in-water emulsions containing Propofol.<br>
Propofol<br>
2,6-bis(l-methylethyl)-phenol or 2,6-diisopropylphenol<br>
CAS Number 2078-54-8 ; C12H18O; Mol. Wt. 178.273<br>
The Propofol compositions of the present invention typically comprise 0.01% -<br>
5% w/v of Propofol.   Preferably the compositions comprise 0.1% - 2% w/v of<br>
Propofol.   More preferably the compositions comprise about 1% and about 2%<br>
w/v of Propofol.<br>
8<br><br>
Triglyceride Oils<br>
Triglyceride oil suitable for the compositions of present invention include natural oils such as vegetable oils and/or synthetic oils such as MCT oil. Typically, the natural oil will be a vegetable oil and preferably is selected from the group consisting of Soybean oil, Sunflower oil, Sesame oil, Safflower oil, Arachis oil, Cottonseed oil, Olive oil. The synthetic oil typically is manufactured from a vegetable oil which is chemically and/or physically modified and/or purified. MCT oil is a typical example of synthetic oil and is obtained from the fixed oil extracted from the hard, dried fraction of the endosperm of Cocos nucifera L. Hydrolysis of the fixed oil followed by distillation yields the required fatty acids, which are then re-esterified to produce MCT oil (Medium-chain Triglycerides). The present invention may also comprise any combination of one or more vegetable oils and / or synthetic oils. Soybean oil is the preferred natural vegetable oil used in the compositions of the present invention. Soybean oil used in these compositions is preferably refined, bleached, deodorised and preferably free of heavy metal contaminants.<br>
The triglyceride oil(s) content in compositions of the invention is up to 30% w/v of the composition, preferably in the range of 5% - 30% w/v of the composition, more preferably 10% - 20% w/v of the composition.<br>
Purified natural phosphatides<br>
In the oil-in water emulsion compositions of the present invention natural phosphatides are used as an emulsifier for stabilization of the oil-in-water emulsion. The preferred natural phosphatides used are purified egg lecithin and/or purified soya lecithin. More preferably the natural phosphatide used is purified egg lecithin.<br>
In the present invention, it is preferred that no emulsifiers other than phosphatides are used.<br>
9<br><br>
Phosphatides are well known for forming liposomes when hydrated with aqueous media and are used in the present invention as emulsifier and for stabilizing the emulsion. They are not used in the present forming liposomal compositions.<br>
In the compositions of present invention natural phosphatides are present in the range of 0.1% - 3% w/v, preferably in the range of 0.5% - 3% w/v and more preferably about 1.2% w/v of the composition.<br>
Tonicity Modifying Agents<br>
The composition of the present invention preferably is isotonic with blood by incorporating suitable tonicity modifying agents such as Glycerin, Dextrose, or Mannitol. Glycerin is the preferred tonicity modifying agent. Glycerin is used in an amount 2.25% w/v of the composition.<br>
Capric acid and / or its water soluble alkali salts<br>
In the Propofol oil-in-water emulsion composition of the present invention, the amount of capric acid and / or its water soluble alkali salts expressed as capric acid is 0.005 - 0.5 % w/v of the composition, preferably 0.02 - 0.1 % and more preferably 0.025 - 0.075 % w/v of the composition.<br>
In a typical Propofol oil-in-water emulsion composition comprises Propofol about 1 % w/v; soybean oil about 10 % w/v; purified egg lecithin about 1.2 % w/v; Glycerin about 2.25 % w/v; Capric acid about 0.05% w/v; Water for Injection q.s. to 100% by volume of the composition; sodium hydroxide solution q.s. to obtain composition of pH 6 - 8.5.<br>
A process of preparing a Propofol oil-in-water composition comprises the steps of: i)        preparing oil phase in triglyceride oil maintained at about 75 Â°C, by dissolving in it propofol;<br>
10<br><br>
ii)       preparing an aqueous phase in water at about 70Â°C; by adding tonicity<br>
modifying agent and alkali solution sufficient to make the pH of the final<br>
composition 6-8.5; <br>
iii)      dispersing the purified natural phosphatide either into oil phase or into<br>
aqueous phase; or partly  into oil phase and remaining part into aqueous<br>
phase;<br>
iv)	adding capric acid and / or its water soluble alkali salts either into oil 	  phase or into aqueous phase or partly in oil phase and remaining part in aqueous phase <br>
v)	 mixing said oil phase obtained at step iv), and said aqueous phase obtained at step iv under stirring to produce a coarse emulsion; <br>
vi)       homogenizing said coarse emulsion obtained at the end of step v), to form<br>
  homogenised bulk emulsion having an average globule size of less than<br>
500 nanometers; <br>
vi)	filtering the said emulsion composition obtained at the end of step vi);<br>
viii)     filling the filtrate obtained at the end of step vii) in containers such as vials,<br>
  ampoules, blanketing under inert gas such as nitrogen and sealing the filled<br>
  containers;<br>
 ix)       autoclaving said filtrate in said sealed containers to give end sterilised<br>
Propofol oil-in-water emulsion composition.<br>
It will be seen that the process is flexible in addition of preservatives - Capric acid and/or its water soluble alkali salts at step iv) in oily phase or in aqueous phase. For example when Capric acid and/or its water soluble alkali salts is used alone, it can be added in aqueous phase or in to oily phase or partly into aqueous phase and partly into oily phase. When they are used, the following combinations are possible.<br><br>
	Oily phase	Aqueous phase<br>
(a)	Capric acid	Capric acid<br>
(b)	Water soluble alkali salts of Capric acid	Water soluble alkali salts of Capric acid<br>
11<br><br>
(c)	Capric acid	Water soluble alkali salts of Capric acid<br>
(d)	Water soluble alkali salts of Capric acid	Capric acid<br>
(e)	Capric acid + Water soluble alkali salts of Capric acid	Capric acid + Water soluble alkali salts of Capric acid<br>
(f)	Capric acid	Capric acid + Water soluble alkali salts of Capric acid<br>
(g)	Capric acid + Water soluble alkali salts of Capric acid	Capric acid<br>
(h)	Water soluble alkali salts of Capric acid	Capric acid + Water soluble alkali salts of Capric acid<br>
(i)	Capric acid + Water soluble alkali salts of Capric acid	Water soluble alkali salts of Capric acid<br>
The number of combinations multiply with variations in addition of phosphatides in oil phase, aqueous phase or in both phases in step iii).<br>
Not bound by theory, it is believed that the distribution of the preservative both in the oil phase and in the aqueous phase contributes to substantial enhancement of the preservative activity.<br>
Another process of preparing a Propofol oil-in-water composition comprises the<br>
steps of:<br>
i)        preparing oil phase in triglyceride oil maintained at about 75Â°C, by<br>
dissolving in it propofol; <br>
ii)        preparing an aqueous phase in water at about 70Â°C; by adding tonicity<br>
modifying agent and alkali solution sufficient to make the pH of the final<br>
composition 6-8.5; <br>
iii)      dispersing the purified natural phosphatide either into oil phase or into<br>
aqueous phase; or partly  into oil phase and remaining part into aqueous<br>
phase; <br>
iv)       mixing said oil phase obtained at step iii), and said aqueous phase obtained<br>
at step iii under stirring to produce a coarse emulsion;<br>
12<br><br>
v)        homogenizing said coarse emulsion obtained at the end of step iv), to form<br>
homogenised bulk emulsion having an average globule size of less than<br>
500 nanometers; <br>
vi)       mixing capric acid and / or its water soluble alkali salts dispersed or<br>
dissolved in a small quantity of water in to homogenised bulk emulsion<br>
obtained at the end of step v) to give bulk emulsion composition;<br>
 vii)      filtering the said bulk emulsion composition obtained at the end of step vi); viii)     filling the filtrate obtained at the end of step vii) in containers such as vials,<br>
ampoules, blanketing under inert gas such as nitrogen and sealing the filled<br>
containers;<br>
 ix)       autoclaving said filtrate in said sealed containers to give end sterilised<br>
Propofol oil-in-water emulsion composition.<br>
In this process the preservative Capric acid and/or its water soluble alkali salts is added to the preformed Propofol emulsion prepared without any preservative in it.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the Propofol and capric acid and /or its soluble salt are added to a preformed lipid emulsion like Intralipid and homogenized.<br>
