[34]	Generally, an embodiment provides a system and method for controlling a bus interface of a portable device that is connected to a host computer (or device) to allow for improved power management for the device.<br>
[35]	Referring to Fig. 1, an environment 10 of an embodiment has host computer 12 connected to a plurality of portable electronic devices 14, such as cellphones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), portable gaming devices etc. Device 14A is a portable handheld device and connects to host 12 through its port 18 via cable 20A. Devices 14B and 14C are connected to device 12 through a hub 16. Hub 16 is connected to port 18 via cable 20B. Device 14B is connected to an output of port 16 via cable 20C. Device 14C is connected to hub 16 via cable 20C, and hub 16 is connected to port 18 via cable 20D. Device 14B connects to hub 16 through cradle 22 through port 24 on device 14B. While devices 14 are typically powered by internal batteries (not shown) the connections to host 12 allow host 12 to provide a charging voltage to devices 14. In an embodiment, port 18 is a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port.<br>
[36]	The USB specification defines electrical, mechanical and operational standards allowing devices to connect with a host througih a standardized platform. Briefly, the USB bus is a bi-directional soial interface btis. Data is transmitted using a differential NRZI signals. Data may be transferred at one of three different rates fix&gt;m the host to the connected devices in speeds ranging fi-om 10 Kbps to 480 Mbps: Slow speed mode (10 Kbps to 100 Kbps) is used for devices that have a low data transmission rate, such as a keyboard or a mouse; Full speed mode (SCO Kbps to 10 Mbps) is used by more devices; and High speed . mode (25 Mbps to 400 Mbps) is provided in USB version 2.0 and provides the highest data communication rate for the current standard. Notably, the High speed mode has certain electrical and mechanical requirements, including use of 45 ohm termination resisters between each data line and ground and minimum voltage and current levels for output signals generated for the High speed mode. It may be necessary to incorporate an additional bus transceiver to provide the required signal levels.<br>
[37]	As part of the USB specification, a USB port is allowed to simply power to devices that connect to it. As such, signals provided through port 18 can be used to provide power to device 14. A "high-power" USB port provides a voltage between 4.35-5.25 VDC and a current of at least 500 mA to its connected devices. A "low-power^ USB port must be able to provide a voltage between 4.40-5.525 VDC and a current of 100 mA.<br>
	One feature of the USB specification allows devices to be connected (or "attached") and disconnected (or "detached") from the USB while either of the host or device is powered. The USB qiecification has a negotiation protocol that the host and device conduct to enable the host to determine vs^en a new device attaches to the USB or when an attached device is detached from the USB. The USB provides an interrupt signal for reporting these events to the host When a host is initially booted-up, it polls the root USB hub to determine &gt;^ether any devices are attached. Thereafter, the host will poiodically poll the hub(s) to determine whether any changes in the connected devices occiured.<br>
[39]	Generally, when a new device is connected to a host through a USB, the new device must be "enumerated". Per the USB specifications, enumeration determines what device has just been connected and the operating parameters of die device, such as power consumption, number and type of endpoint(s), class of product, etc. Enumeration is a process in which a connection is being established between a device and a host. When a device is being emunerated, the host send a series of requests to the device and the device is expected to reply. A typical enumeration process betweÂ«i a host operating imder a Windows (tradeÂ¬mark) platform and a device may generally be as follows:<br>
a)	When a device is first plugged into coimected to the USB port of the host, the host detects the device through a new voltage detected on the data lines of the USB. A USB connection circuit on the device provides the new voltage through a circuit providing through one or more pull-iq) resistor(s) connected to a voltage signal.<br>
b)	After allowing time for the plug of the device to be fiilly inserted into the port and for power to stabilize on the device, the host may issue a reset command through tile USB to reset tiie device to its defeult state.<br>
c)	When the device receives the reset command, it is expected to rq)lyvvith its address (such as address 0).<br>
d)	The host then may attempt to retrieve device descriptor information from the device, through one or more requests.<br>
e)	If a sufficient part of the device descriptor is received from the device, the host may issue a command to reset the bus. Thereafter the host may issue a command to set the address of the device. When the device receives the command it is expected to place itself in an "addressed state", per USB protocols.<br>
f)	The host then may issue a request to the device for the remaining portion of the device descriptor.<br>
g)	Thereafter the host may request configuration and string descriptor data from the device.<br>
For a successful enumeration, the device must respond to each request from the host with any requested information and take any other requested actions. The exchange of commands and replies is encoded in messages generated by the host and device, per USB protocols. It will be appreciated that other enumeration protocols may be used.<br>
[40]	One feature of the USB protocol is that a power signal can be provided by the host to its connected devices. As such, the current provided on the USB bus by the host can then be used to power components of tije device. If the current in Ae signal is sufficiently large, the device may be fully activated when connected to the USB. The power may also charge an internal battery of the device.<br>
[41]	However, one operating parameter of the USB protocol imposes a current draw limitation on device when it is enumeratii^ with the host. The present current limit is 1 DO mA. For some devices, they may need to draw more than 1 GO mA from the host to provide their full operation. Consider a device having a high speed USB controller operating at 480 Mbps and a transceiver generating any necessary USB-compliant signals for the device. When the device is operating in that mode, it may need more than 100 mA to power all of its modules and {plications.<br>
[42]	Typically, at some point in the enumeration process, the device can indicate to the host via a message that it is "bus-powered" as opposed to "self-powered". Part of the message it can indicate that the device is requesting to draw SOOmA. The host may deny the request, but must provide 100mA to the device at all times, per the USB standards.<br>
[43]	An embodiment provides a bus interface that allows a device to conununicate with the host at one of several speeds through different bus modes, depending on the present state of connection of the device with the host and the present operating conditions of the device. Depending on the selected operating speed of the bus, the device may activate different modules, transceivers, internal components and may operate in different states. One mode is (lower) speed mode which bypasses additional hardware and software modules required for USB High speed communications. In the bypass mode, any High speed USB transceivers in the device may not need to be powered and USB bus control may be provided by an internal USB controller on the microprocessor of the device. Furth^ the microprocessor may be able to operate in a lower-power mode. As such, when the device is operating in the bypass mode, it would use less power (and require less current from the USB) than when it would when operating in the High speed mode.<br>
[44]	The interface provides detection algorithms and circuits to determine: the operating state of the device, the USB connection state (e.g. whether the device is enumerating or not); and the current presently provided from the USB to the device. As such, while the bus interface is operating in the bypass mode, the inter&amp;ce can monitor for any (predetermined) necessary operating conditions that would allow the bus to operate at a higher speed. Whai those conditions are detected, the bus interfece may change the operating state of the bus to a higher ^}eed mode. In such a higher speed mode, additional circuitry may be activated and internal components of the device may be placed in a higher operating condition.<br>
[45]	Similarly, when the bus is operating in a high speed mode, the mterface may monitor for any (predetermined) operating conditions that require that the bus operate at a lower ^ed and make any necessary changes to change the operating speed of the bus to a (suitable) lower speed and to disengage any components that are not needed for that lower speed. It will be appreciated that any number of speeds may be used. It will further be appreciated that other embodiments may be implemented that selectively activate and deÂ¬activate components that are related to featiues other than a bus for the device.<br>
[46]	Referring to Fig. 1, (hiring execution of aspects of an embodiment when device 14 initially connects to USB port 18 of host 12 and the device is enumerating wiA the host, a bus controller in device 14 (not shown) places Ae USB controller modules of device 14 into a full speed bypass mode. In the bypass mode, the controller activates the internal USB port interface of the microprocessor of device 14, disables the high speed USB transceiver of device 14 and places the microprocessor into a low-power operating mode; During enumeration, signals received by device 14 from host 12 through port 24 are provided directly to the microprocessor. As such, in the fiill speed bypass mode, all USB signals are handled by the internal USB port on the microprocessor and all data communication exchange rates are set to the limit set for the USB full speed mode. It will be seen that the controller utilizes' less power to process signals between port 24 and the microprocessor and the high speed transceiver is not activated, thereby saving further power. It is noted that a typical USB baseband bus transceiver may draw between 10-15 mA of current in normal operation (in the full speed mode). A typical external high speed transceiver draws between 40mA and SQmA. As such, more current is conserved, M^ch can be used to charge the battery of device 14, xintil the USB controller of device 14 can move to the high speed mode.<br>
	Once device 14 enumoates with host 12, the embodiment may provide a further status check on the power being provided from the USB. If controUa detects that the current is still being limited, (e.g. to 100 mA), then the controller may keep the bus operating in the full speed bypass mode and divert some of the current to charge the battery of device 12. If the controller detects that there is more current available (e.g. if 500 mA is detected), then that additional current may alternatively be requested by device 14, while maintaining the data rate for the fiill speed mode. Once a predetermined condition is met (e.g. completion of sufficient charging of battery 342), the embodiment may dlow the bus to switch to a higher op^ting speed. One method of changing the operating speed is to have device 14 re- enumerate to host 12. During the re-enumeration process, the new currrait availability values may be formally negotiating between device 14 and host 12. Once successful negotiations are complete, the microprocessor may be able to operate in its "normal" operating mode and more (or all) applications on device 14 may be activated. As part of the re-enumeration <br>
process, the bus may be set to operate in the USB High speed mode and expect to be able to draw 500 mA current from the USB.<br>
[48]	In operation, device 14 may initially set the bus interface to have its USB communications conducted using the Ml speed bypass mode to a maximum data rate as provided for full speed USB communications. Once the full speed bypass mode has been established and after the battery on device 14 is sufficiently charged, deAdce 14 may initiate negotiations with host 12 to go to the USB High speed mode. Once the High speed mode is set, device 14 may exchange data with host 12 at the data rate provided for High speed USB communications.<br>
[49]	An embodiment may additionally or alternatively have device 14 operating the bus at a given speed and then automatically negotiate with host 12 to determine whether the bus should be set at a lower speed. In such an embodiment, device 14 would need to reqtiest to disconnect from the USB then re-enumerate to re-establish a connection with the host.<br>
[50]	Further detail is now provided on the basic operating components of device 14, followed by a description of specific components more closely related to an embodiment.<br>

Further detail on port 24 is provided below.<br>
	Operating system software executed by the microprocessor 302 is preferably stored in a computer-readable medium, such as flash memory 312, but may be stored in other types of memory devices, such as read-only memory (ROM) or similar storage element. In addition, system software, specific device applications, or parts thereof, may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store, such as RAM 314. Conunimication signals received by device 14 may also be stored to RAM 314.<br>
[58]	Microprocessor 302, in addition to its operating system functions, enables execution of software Â«q)plications on device 14. A set of software (or firmware) Â«q)plications, generally identified as applications 318, that control basic device operations, such as voice communication module 318A and data communication module 318B, may be installed on the device 14 during manufacture or downloaded thereafter. As well, software modules, such as calendar module 318C, address book 318D and location module 318E. Additional modules * such as personal ii^ormation manager (PIM) ^plication may be provided. Any module may be installed during manufacture or downloaded thereafter into device 14. Data associated with each application can be stored in flash memory 312. Also, Port Control Code 318N is provided to control operation of device 14 and its internal bus connections with port 24 when device 14 is connected to host 12. Further detail on Port Control Code 318N is provided below.<br>
[59]	Communication ftmctions, including data and voice communications, are p^ormed through the communication sub-system 304 and the short-range communication sub-system 306. Syst^ 304 and 306 may be selectively activated and not activated depending on the current state of device 14, For example, if device 14 is in a low-power <br>
mode, then either or both of systems 304 and 306 may be not activated. Activation of both systems 304 and 306 may be controlled by software, including anv modde 318. Collectively, sub-systems 304 and 306 provide the signal-level interface for all communication technologies processed by device 14. Various applications 318 provide the operational controls to further process and log the communications. Communication sub-system 304 includes receiver 320, transmitter 322 and one or more antennas, illustrated as receive antenna 324 and transmit antenna 326. In addition, communication sub-system 304 also includes processing modules, such as digital signal processor (DSP) 328 and local oscillators (LOs) 340. The specific design and implementation of communication sub-system 304 is dependent upon the communication network in which device 14 is intended to operate. For example, communication sub-system 304 of device 14 may operate with the Mobitex (trade-mark), DataTAC (trade-mark) or General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) mobile data communication networks and also operate with any of a variety of voice communication netwoirics, such as Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), CDMA 2000, Personal Communication Service (PCS), Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), etc. Other types of data and voice (telephonic) networks, both separate and integrated, may also be utilized with device 14. In any event, communication sub-system 304 provides device 14 with the capability of communicating with other devices using various communication technologies, including instant messaging (IM) systems, text messaging (TM) systems and short message service (SMS) systems.<br>
[60]	In addition to processing communication signals, DSP 328 provides control of receiver 320 and transmitter 322. For example, gains applied to communication signals in receiver 320 and transmitter 322 may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain-control algorithms implemented in DSP 328.<br>
[61]	In a data communication mode, a received signal, such as a text message or Web page download, is processed by the communication sub-system 304 and is provided as an input to microprocessor 302. The received signal is thai further processed by microprocessor 302 \s4uch can then generate an output to dispky 202 or to an auxiliary I/O device 308. A device user may also compose data items, such as e-mail messages, using keypad 212,<br>
trackball 208 and/or some other auxlliaiy I/O device 308, such as a touchpad, a rocker switch, a trackball pr some other input device. The composed data items may then be transmitted over a communication network via communication sub-system 304. Sub-system 304 may also detect when it is out of communication range for its remote systems.<br>
[62]	In a voice communication mode, overall operation of device 14 is substantially similar to the data communication mode, except that received signals are ou^ut to speaker 204, and signals for transmission are generated by microphone 216. Alternative voice or audio I/O sub-systems, such as a voice message recording sub-system, may also be implemented on device 14. In addition, display 202 may also be utilized in voice communication mode, for example, to display the identity of a calling party, the duration of a voice call, or other voice call-related information.<br>
[63]	Short-range communication sub-system 306 enables communication between device 14 and other proximate systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the short-range commimication sub-system may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a Bluetooth (trade-mark) communication module to provide for communication with similarly enabled systems and devices.<br>
[64]	Device 14 may also have global positioning system 344 to assist in identifying a present location of device 14 and may also have light sensor 346 to provide data on the ambient light conditions for device 14. These elements may be controlled by software operating on device 14 as described earlier.<br>
[65]	Powering the entire electronics of the mobile handheld communication device is power source 342. In one embodiment, the power source 342 includes one or more batteries. In ano&amp;er embodiment, the powo- source 342 is a single battery pack, especially a rechargeable battery pack. A power switch (not shown) provides an "on/off' switch for device 14. Battery charging circuit 348 provides a hardware interface to allow external power to be selectively provided to device 14. Such power may be provided throi^ signals received in port 24. The charging circuit may be able to detect the present level of charge on battery 342 and determine whether battery 342 is sufQcimtly charged. A sufficient level of charge can differ among devices and batteries. Determining a level of charge may be implemented using circuits and techniques known in the art. A power source inter&amp;ce (not <br>
shown) may be provided in hardware, firmware, software or a combination of such elements to selectively control access of components in device 14 to power source 342. Upon activation of the power switch an application 318 is initiated to turn on device 14. Upon deactivation of the power switch, an application 318 is initiated to turn off device 14. Power to device 14 may also be controlled by other devices and by software applications 318.<br>
[66]	Port 24 provides signals fix&gt;m connector 20 to microprocessor 302 through port controller 352. As is described further below, controller 352 selectively oigages a bus transceiver when device 14 is operating in a high speed mode for USB signals. Controller also communicates with internal USB port 350 in microprocessor 302. USB port 350 can selectively communicate directly with port 24, as controlled by controller 352.<br>
	Further detail is now provided on specific components of device 14 as they relate to an embodiment. First, detail is provided on the bus interface and the controller for device 14 for port 24 and Port Control Code 318N.<br>
[68]	Fig. 4 shows diagram 400 of components of device 14 including port 24 and internal components that process signals carried thereon. Connector 402 is part of port 24 and provides a physical connector for cable 20 to de\^ce 14. USB signals 410 are provided between connector 402 and microprocessor 302. Controller 352 provides control logic to selectively make signalling connections between microprocessor 302 and port 24 for USB signals 410. Microprocessor 302 is controlled, in part by Port Control Code 318N. Data and control signals received by microprocessor 302 through USB signals 410 allow an embodiment to determine Uie present state of connection of device 14 to host 12. As such, an embodiment can then cause microprocessor 302 to selectively generate: control signals 408 to control one or more of controller 352 (and its elements); host interface signals 412 and USB signals 410 to communicate with host 14. It will be appreciated that there is a separate data path between the host and controller 352 aside from the USB connection. The USB path allows the (full speed) USB port 350 to be "routed through" (high speed) port controller 352. In such a "routed throu^" state, it will be typical that much of tiie circuitry in controller 352 would not be powered. USB signals 410 fix)m microprocessor 302 are processed either by USB port 350 alone or by port 350 with transceiver 404, depending on the state of operation of the USB for device 14. Power and control is also provided to charging circuit 348, which selectively provides either the 1 OOmA signal or the 500 mA signal to a charging circuit that - charges battery 342. The battoy may be charged to any sufficient predetermined level by circuit 348 depending on its design. Circuit 348 receives a Vbus signal from connector 402 and control signals from controller 352 and microprocessor 302. [0069| Within controller 352, transceiver circuit 404 is provided to selectively amplify signals from microprocessor 302 destined to port 24. Transceiver 404 may include USB bus logic to allow it to generate USB compliant signals based on signals 408 received from microprocestor 302. Current detect circuit 406 provides electronic circuits allowing controller 352 to determine the level of current and/or voltage present in USB signals 410. The controller may have a digital memory (endpoint RAM) inter&amp;ce for the host, a phase- locked loop to generate a clock for controller 352 and encoders and decoders for NRZI signalling conversion, in addition to USB bypass routing logic. The controller has logic to selectively charge battery through charging circuit 348 at either 100 mA or 500 mA based on a charging message received by the device from the host indicating A^t is available.<br>
[70]	Further detail is now provided on Port Control Code 318N as it controb elements of device 14.<br>
[71]	Referring to Fig. 5, flow duirt 500 shows an exemplary process used to control operation of the USB bus and controller 352 for device 14 through Port Control Code 318N. Overall, code 318N operates on device 14 and controls port controller 352, internal USB port 350 and charging circuit 348.<br>
[00721 At block 502, Port Control Code 318N starts. Initiation of Code 318N may be automatically executed on starti^ of device 14 or upon detection of a connection being established through port 24 (Fig. 4). At stq) 504, the process waits for detection of a connection to host 12.<br>
[0073] Next, at test block 506, the signals on USB signals 410 are monitored to determine whether if a c(Mmection has been detected. If no connection has been detected, then the process returns to step 504. If a coimection has been detected, the process moves to step 508, where a transmission mode for the bus is determined, based on USB signals 410 as processed by Code 318N. For example, the connection niay be: a higjh-speed, a fidl-speed, a low-speed connection, high-impedance or a different coimection. The type of connection may be<br>
determined fix&gt;m signals received from host 12 or by evaluating the physical characteristics of the signals (e.g. the current, using current detect module 406). As such, at test 510, the process evaluates whether the connection is a high speed connection. If it is, the process moves to step 512 where the controller is set to a full speed bypass mode. In other embodiments, the default may be to simply force device 14 into the bypass mode. If test 510 . is conducted and if it determines that the present USB connection is not a high speed connection, then the process moves directly fix&gt;m test S10 to step 514.<br>
[74]	After the bypass mode is set, the process moves to step S14 where an enumeration process is started with the host. During enumeration. Code 318N may generate messages destined for host 12 through port 24 that device 14 is operating in a full speed mode (i.e. the bypass mode).<br>
[75]	OptionaUy, if any cunrent is available througlh USB signals 410 for charging battery 342 ^ugh charging circuit 348, &amp;en the battoy is charged. Code 318N may selectively activate current detÂ«;t module 406 to determine the level of curroit of USB signals 410 and then selectively activate charging circuit 348 (Fig. 3) to charge battery 342. Altonatively or additionally, such information may be derived from the contents of USB signals 410 from host 12. Circuit 348 may provide a "charge" signal which is detected by microprocessor 302 and as such Code 318N. Upon detection of any "charge" si^ial, the char^g process may be stopped.<br>
[76]	Next, at test 516, the process detects whether the emmieration is complete. If it is not complete then the test retum to step 514 to complete the enumeration. If the eniuneration is complete, the process moves to step 518, vsdiere the current provided on the bus is detected using Code 318N to evaluate data provided by either current detector circuit 406 or messages provided from host 14. In some instances, host-side drivers may inform the device of what - the available current is on the port that the device is connected to. This may be done through a setup message sent during enumeration. As such in some instances, the stq) 518 may be conducted else^^diere in process.<br>
[77]	Thereafter, the process moves to stq) 520 where the charge on the battery is determined. This charge may be evaluated by charging circuit 348. This step is optional and it may be conducted as part of step 514.<br>
(00781 Then the process moves to step 526 where a test is made to determine whether there is a sufficient charge on battery 342. If the battery is not charged then the process returns to step 524 to maintain the bus in full speed bypass mode. However, if the battery is charged, then the process 500 moves to step 528, where the bus is re-enumerated to a high speed mode. At this point, the following test can also be done: if the re-enumeration is not successful (e.g. the host rejects die connect at the high speed mode and instead offers the fidl speed mode), then the system returns to the bypass mode. Thereafter if re-enumeration is complete and successful, the bus is activated at the high speed level. This may include activating transceiver 504. The next step is the end of the process.<br>
[79]	Alternatively, once an embodiment sets the full speed bypass mode for device 14, if either 100 mA or 500 mA is available from host 12, device 14 may issue a USB command to accepts signals being transmitt^ at either current level. However, the data rate would remain limited to the ranges provided by the Full speed USB standard.<br>
[80]	It will be appreciated that this process may be initiated upon the detection of a connection, as provided in step 504. However, in other embodiments other external conditions may trigger the activation of the process 500. For example, the process may be restarted if the current is detected to drop to 100 mA, i.e. the bus drops down to a fidl speed mode. It wiU be {q)preciated that tMsprcK^ss 500 utilizes signids from niicroprocessor 302 and Port Control Code 318N.<br>
	In another embodiment, an algorithm may be implemented in Port Control Code 318N to control man^^ement of a captive USB bus from a full speed mode to a high speed mode as follows. First, device 14 boots with a USB cable connected to host 12. Next device 14 simulates an 'attachment" to host 12 through a USB signal and device 14 identifies itself to host 12 as a full-speed capable (but not high speed capable) device.<br>
[82]	Once host 12 receives and interprets this identification, host 12 initiates an USB enimieration process with device 14. As part of the enumeration process, host 12 sets the USB configuration for device 14 to allow device 14 to terminate the enumeration process.<br>
[83]	Next, a test is made at device 14 to determine viiether device 14 has sufBcient power to operate in the USB high speed mode. If it does not, then device 14 may mitiate any appropriate action to meet the power requirements, reset and then return to the boot up step.<br>
If device 14 has sufficirait power, then through signal(s) provided by the device on the USB, device 14: simulates a detach from the USB; simulates an attach; and identifies itself to host 12 as being high speed capable. At that time, host 12 initiates an enumeratioA process and sets the USB configuration for device 14 to allow device 14 to terminate the enumeration process. At that time, device 14 is enumerated at the high speed mode. As noted earlier, all steps are executed through command and control signals generated by Port Control Code 318N and provided to USB and otho: elements in device 14.<br>
[84]	As a complementary process, Port Control Code 31SN has a separate process to manage and control negotiation of its USB from being enumerated at a high speed mode to a full speed mode. For this process, device 14 starts as being enumerated at the high speed mode. Next, a test is periodically conducted to determine if device 14 needs to down grade to the full speed mode. Different conditions may be set that require the downgrade. Conditions may include: current power state, current time, current location or other criteria. If the results of the test indicates that device 14 should remain at high speed mode, it continues to operate at that mode. However, if the results indicate that a downgrade should be performed, then device 14 simulates a detach and then an attach to the USB. Next, device 14 identifies itself to host 12 as bemg full-speed capable (but not high speed ciqiable). Once host 12 receives and inteiprets this identification, host 12 initiates an USB entmieration proc^ with device 14. As part of the enumeration process, host 12 sets the USB configuration for device 14 to allow device 14 to terminate the enumeration process and finally device 14 is enumerated a full^)eed.<br>
[85]	It will be appreciated that the Port Control Code 318N and other plications in - the embodiments can be implemented using knoAvn progranuning techniques, languages and algorithms. The titles of the modules are provided as a convenience to provide labels and assign functions to certain modules. It is not required that each module perform only its functions as described above. As such, specific functionalities for each application may be moved between applications or sq&gt;arated into differoit applications. Different signalling techniques may be used to communicate information between applications using known programming techniques. Known data storage, access and update algorithms allow data to be shared between applications. For example, detection or completion of an event described in <br>
Fig. S or any process executing on device 14 may cause an intemq)t to be generated on microprocessor 302 and a particular internet routine may be provided to process the event It will further be appreciated &amp;at other applications and systems on device 14 may be executing concurrently with Code 318N. As such. Code 318N may be structured to operate in as a "background" application on device 14, using programming techniques known in the art<br>
[86]	While an embodiment has been desoibed where a bus is selectively operated in different modes while device 14 is enumerating with host 12, it will be appreciated that other comparable embodiments may be implemented to operate independently from whether or not device 14 is enumerating. Also an embodiment may be directed to a USB protocol or a different bus architecture. Further, other onbodiments may provide selective activation and deactivation of other components to conserve power, depending on the present operating environment of device 14. For example, during a powering cycle, communication subsystems 304 and 306 may be temporarily not powered.<br>
[87]	It will be appreciated that other embodiments may incorporate Avireless connections and charging systems.<br>

Those of ordinary skill may envisage certain modifications to the foregoing embodiments which, although not explicitly discussed herein, do not depart from the scope of the invention, as defined by the appended claims.<br>
