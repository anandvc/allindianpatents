FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a security device. More particularly, the present<br>
invention relates to a multipurpose security device to prevent theft and pilferage<br>
adaptable to any security appliances.<br>
BACK GROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Pilferage and theft of utilities are international problems. Billions of dollars worth<br>
electricity and utility are stolen annually, these costs are routinely passed along<br>
to general consumers in the form of higher rates. These pilferage and theft are<br>
increasing day by day as there was no fullproof security device available in the<br>
market.<br>
An US patent NO. 5,782.513 discloses a "security seal" which is superior<br>
ergonomic design, having a capsule and anchor shaped to conform to the fingers<br>
and thumb. The seat also has an integral wire which conforms to the anchor to<br>
be securely and irreversibly held within the capsule. The improved features exists<br>
in this invention is that it can be closed with one hand; it is internally "self<br>
threading" and thus can be closed by a gloved hand, the wire cannot be pulled<br>
out, if the wire is cut it cannot be pushed back.<br>
Another US-Patent No. 6283.517 discloses an wone-piece security seal" which is<br>
provided a superior ergonomic design making the seal easier to put into place<br>
and lock. The seal comprises a capsule having a wall which defines an open end<br><br>
-3-<br>
and a close end. The capsule includes first connection fitting formed therein. A<br>
first aperture is formed in the wall of the capsule. A second aperture is formed in<br>
the wail of the capsule aligned with and opposite the first aperture. A locking<br>
member having an insertion and is connected to the capsule by a flexible<br>
connecting arm which is integrally formed therewith. The insertion end is<br>
insertable into the open end of the capsule such that bent path is created<br>
between the locking member and the capsule when the insertion end is inserted<br>
therein. Also the insertion end includes a second connection fitting which is<br>
designed to co-operate with the first connection fitting of the capsule to provide<br>
an irreversible connection between the locking member and the capsule when<br>
the insertion end in inserted therein. A flexible wire size to be passable through<br>
the first and second apertures is permanently connected to the seal and extends<br>
there from with a free end. The security seal is locked by passing the free end<br>
of the flexible wire through the first and second apertures of the capsule and<br>
subsequently inserting the insertion end of the locking member into the open<br>
end of the capsule such that the second connection fitting is irreversible engaged<br>
by the flexible wire is forced to conform to bent path to form a plurality of crimps<br>
in the flexible wire, thus the flexible wire secured between the capsule and the<br>
locking member.<br>
Although many foreign patented security seals are available in the market still<br>
there was no full proof sealing available as reported by the customer/ users.<br><br>
-4-<br>
A public notice, may very often be seen, published by the electricity Board to<br>
aware public for preventing Theft of electricity and to save the revenue of Govt.<br>
So it is clear that still on date there is still lacuna in seals in security devices. Our<br>
emphasis on making a strong and tough sealing device by improving technical<br>
parameter to satisfy the customer demand.<br>
The present invention relates to new type of security seals which are tamper<br>
proof and is applicable in many areas in secure devices in electricity meter, gas<br>
cylinder, Petrol tanker, taximeter, water supply. Water values, petrol value,<br>
switches etc.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is there, an object of the present invention to propose a multipurpose security<br>
device to prevent theft and pilferage adaptable to any security appliances which<br>
eliminates the disadvantages of prior art.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a multipurpose security<br>
device to prevent theft and pilferage adaptable to any security appliances<br>
Which is a simple design see through material which makes it extremely easy to<br>
spot any tampering.<br><br>
-5-<br>
A still another object of the present invention is to propose a multipurpose<br>
security device to prevent theft and pilferage adaptable to any security<br>
appliances which is easy to handle and can be locked it easily only pressing the<br>
stainless steel wire through a hole and press a clamp on. Once locked the seal<br>
can only be removed by breaking steel or body which can not be put back.<br>
A further object of tiie present invention is to propose a multipurpose security<br>
device to prevent theft and pilferage adaptable to any security appliances which<br>
is made of poly carbonate material, having a excellent balance of toughness,<br>
clarity, high heat deflection temperature, diametrical stability and inhernt<br>
ignition resistant properties made the seals tough, resistant of high temperature<br>
and variety of atmosphere.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to propose a multipurpose<br>
security device to prevent theft and pilferage adaptable to any security<br>
appliances which can not be accidentally opened, so it can be used in places<br>
where the meters/valves are in the open and used regularly.<br>
An yet further object of the present invention is to propose a multipurpose<br>
security device to prevent theft and pilferage adaptable to any security<br>
appliances which is very durable, an withstand a wide range of condition, Exo-<br>
friendly and versatile application including vast range in various industries.<br><br>
