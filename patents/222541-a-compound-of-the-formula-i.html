(The invention relates to new antithrombotic agents, a process for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds as active ingredients] as well as the use of said compounds for the manufacture of medicaments.<br>
Serine proteases are enzymes which play an important role in the blood coagulation cascade. Members of this group of proteases are for example thrombin, trypsin, factors Vila, IXa, Xa, XIa, Xlla, and protein C.<br>
Thrombin is the final serine protease enzyme in the coagulation cascade. The prime fimction of thrombin is the cleavage of fibrinogen to generate fibrin monomers, which are cross-linked to form an insoluble gel. In addition, thrombin regulates its own production by activation of factors V and VIII earlier in the cascade. It also has important actions at cellular level, where it acts on specific receptors to cause platelet aggregation, endothelial cell activation and fibroblast proliferation. Thus thrombin has a central regulatory role in haemostasis and thrombus formation. Since inhibitors of thrombin may have a wide range of therapeutical applications, extensive research is done in this area.<br>
Another important serine protease, factor Xa, catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin into thrombin.<br>
In the development of synthetic inhibitors of serine proteases, and more specifically of thrombin, the benzamidine moiety is one of the key structures. It mimics the protonated side-chain of the basic amino acids Arg and Lys of its natural substrates. Compounds with this moiety have been studied extensively and repeatedly. A very potent representative of this type of thrombin inhibitors is the amino acid derivative Na-(2-naphthylsulfonyl)-glycyl-4-amidinophenylalanin-piperidide (NAPAP) (Stiirzebecher, J. et al., Thromb. Res. 29, 635-642, 1983). However, the profile of NAPAP is unattractive for therapeutical applications: for example, the compound has low thrombin specificity and is poorly soluble. Derivatives of NAPAP were subsequently prepared, such as the N-alkyl substituted derivatives disclosed in EP 0,236,163 or the glycopeptide derivatives described EP 0,558,961, Proc. Am. Pept. Symp., 13th (60LXAW); 94;<br><br>
pp. 643-5 (Stuber, W. et al., Pept.: Chem., Struct. Biol.,), Proc. Int. Symp. Controlled Release Bioact. Mater. (PCRMEY, 10220178); 94;Vol 21 st; pp. 712-12 (Walter. E. et al), and EP 0,513,543. However, although these derivatizations may have led to improvements of the pharmacological profile when compared to NAPAP, all such NAPAP-derived compounds are still active only as direct thrombin inhibitors and they have a restricted plasma half-life and a fast clearance (thus displaying their anti-thrombin activity only for a short period of time).<br><br>
Z is a negatively charged oligosaccharide residue comprising two to six monosaccharide units, the charge being compensated by positively charged counterions;<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or a prodrug thereof are potent and highly versatile antithrombotics. The compounds of the invention have anti-thrombin activity, but also the structure of the compounds may be selectively modified so that they have a tuneable mixed profile of both non-mediated, direct anti-thrombin (factor Ila) activity dnd anti-thrombin III<br><br>
(AT-III) mediated anti-Xa activity. The compounds of the invention thus are dual inhibitors. Compounds of the invention have a long plasma half-life and, as a result, they possess prolonged anti-thrombin activity compared to NAPAP or its above reported derivatives. Further, compounds of the invention may escape the neutralizing action of platelet factor 4 (PF4). Low toxicity is also an advantageous aspect of conpounds of this invention.<br>
Another type of dual inhibitors is disclosed in EP 0,649,854. Contrary to the compounds of the present invention the conjugated saccharide compounds disclosed in that document display indirect, AT-III mediated anti-thrombin activity, in addition to AT-III mediated anti-Xa activity.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are useful for treating and preventing thrombin-mediated and thrombin-associated diseases. This includes a number of thrombotic and prothrombotic states in which the coagulation cascade is activated which include, but are not limited to, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, thrombophlebitis, arterial occlusion from thrombosis or embolism, arterial reocclusion during or after angioplasty or thrombolysis, restenosis following arterial injury or invasive cardiological procedures, postoperative venous thrombosis or embolism, acute or chronic atherosclerosis, stroke, myocardial infarction, cancer and metastasis, and neurodegenerative diseases. The compounds of the invention may also be used as anticoagulants in extracorporeal blood circuits, as necessary in dialysis and surgery. The compounds of the invention may also be used as in vitro anticoagulants.<br>
The mixed profile of the compounds of the invention may be tuned by varying the nature of the oligosaccharide residue Z and the length of the spacer Q. A range of profiles is thereby available.<br>
Any negatively charged oligosaccharide residue of 2 to 6 saccharide units is useable in the compounds of the present invention. Suitable compounds of the invention are compounds wherein Z is a sulfated or phosphoryiated oligosaccharide residue. Preferably, the oligosaccharide residue Z is derived from an oligosaccharide which has per se AT-III mediated anti-Xa activity, such as the saccharides disclosed in EP 0,454,220 and EP 0,529,715. Particularly preferred oligosaccharide residues are pentasaccharide residues. Most preferably, Z has the formula (11)<br><br><br>
4<br>
Further preferred compounds of the invention are compounds of formula I, wherein R1 is phenyl, 4-methoxy-2,3,6-trimethylphenyl or naphthyl. In preferred compounds, NR3R represents the piperidinyl group. Preferably, R2 is H.<br>
The chemical structure of the spacer is of minor or no importance for the anti-thrombotic activity<br>
of the compounds of the invention, it may however not be completely rigid. Highly flexible<br>
spacers are more suitable than others.<br>
Further, for synthetic reasons some spacers are more appropriate than others.<br>
Suitable spacers that can easily be used have for example the formula (III):<br><br><br><br>
In the description of the compounds of formula (I) the following definitions are used.<br>
The term (l-8C)alkyl means a branched or unbranched alkyl group having 1-8 carbon atoms, for<br>
example methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl hexyl and octyl. Methyl and<br>
ethyl are preferred alkyl groups.<br>
The term (l-8C)alkoxy means an alkoxy group having 1-8 carbon atoms, the alkyl moiety having<br>
the meaning as previously defined. Methoxy is a preferred alkoxy group.<br>
The term (3-8C)cycloaIkyl means a cycloaikyl  group  having  3-8  carbon atoms,  being<br>
cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl or cyclo-octyl. Cyclopentyl and<br>
cyciohexyl are preferred cycloaikyl groups.<br>
The spacer length is the number of atoms of the spacer, counted along the shortest chain<br>
between Z and the peptide part of the molecule, not counting the oxygen atom of the<br>
oligosaccharide Z which is connected to the spacer.<br>
The term "prodrug"' means a compound of the invention in which the amino group of the<br>
amidino-moiety is protected, e.g. by hydroxy or a (l-6C)alkoxycarbonyl group.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are prepared by derivatizing NAPAP (or a NAPAP-analogue) at the glycine position with cysteine or lysine using methods generally known in the art, which compound subsequently (a) is coupled to a oligosaccharide-spacer residue or (b) is coupled to a spacer, which then is derivatized with a thiol group and subsequently is coupled to an oligosaccharide residue. Any suitable oligosaccharide may be used for this purpose, for example oligosaccharides known in literature (e.g. fi-om EP 0,454,220 and EP 0,529,715, but not limited to these sources) or commercially available oligosaccharides. The oligosaccharides may be phosphorylated at an appropriate time by methods e.g. described by Buijsman, R. et al. (Abstracts of papers, 9th European Carbohydrate Symposium Utrecht 1997, Abstract A150). The coupling of the spacer to the oligosaccharide can for instance be performed by using the methods described in EP 0,649,854.<br><br>
The peptide coupling, a procedural step in the above described method to prepare the compounds of the invention, can be carried out by methods commonly known in the art for the coupling - or condensation • of peptide fragments such as by the azide method, mixed anhydride method, activated ester method, or, preferably, by the carbodiimide method, especially with the addition of catalytic and racemisation suppressing compounds like N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-hydroxybenzotriazole. An overview is given in The Peptides, Analysis. Synthesis, Biology. Vol 3, E. Gross and J. Meienhofer, eds. (Academic Press, New York, 1981).<br>
Amine functions present in the compounds may be protected during the synthetic procedure by an N-protecting group, which means a group commonly used in peptide chemistry for the protection of an a-amino group, like the tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Hoc) group, the benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) group, the 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) group or the phthaloyl (Phth) group. Removal of the protecting groups can take place in different ways, depending on the nature of those protecting groups. Usually deprotection takes place under acidic conditions and in the presence of scavengers. An overview of amino protecting groups and methods for their removal is given in the above mentioned The Peptides, Analysis, Synthesis, Biology. Vol 3.<br>
The compounds of the invention, which can occur in the fomi of a free base, may be isolated from the reaction mixture in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts may also be obtained by treating the free base of formula (I) with an organic or inorganic acid such as HCl, HBr, HI, H2SO4, H3PO4, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, methanesulphonic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, ascorbic acid and the like.<br>
The compounds of this invention possess chiral carbon atoms, and may therefore be obtained as a pure enantiomer, or as a mixture of enantiomers, or as a mixture containing diastereomers. Methods for obtaining the pure enantiomers are well known in the art, e.g. crystallization of salts which are obtained from optically active acids and the racemic mixture, or chromatography using chiral columns. For diastereomers straight phase or reversed phase columns may be used.<br><br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered enterally or parenterally. The exact dose and regimen of these compounds and compositions thereof will neccessarily be dependent upon the needs of the individual subject to whom the medicament is being administered, the degree of affliction or need and the judgment of the medical practitioner. In general parenteral administration requires lower dosages than other methods of administration which are more dependent upon absorption. However, the daily dosages are for humans preferably 0.001-100 mg per kg body weight, more preferably 0,01-10 mg per kg body weight. The medicament manufactured with the compounds of this invention may also be used as adjuvant in acute anticoagulant therapy. In such a case, the medicament is administered with other compounds useful in treating such disease states.<br>
Mixed with pharmaceutically suitable auxiliaries, e.g. as described in the standard reference, Gennaro et al.. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, (18th ed.. Mack Publishing Company, 1990, see especially Part 8: Pharmaceutical Preparations and Their Manufacture) the compounds may be compressed into solid dosage units, such as pills, tablets, or be processed into capsules or suppositories. By means of pharmaceutically suitable liquids the compounds can also be applied in the form of a solution, suspension, emulsion, e.g. for use as an injection preparation, or as a spray, e.g. for use as a nasal spray.<br>
For making dosage units, e.g. tablets, the use of conventional additives such as fillers, colorants, polymeric binders and the like is contemplated. In general any pharmaceutically acceptable additive which does not interfere with the function of the active compounds can be used. Suitable carriers with which the compositions can be administered include lactose, starch, cellulose derivatives and the like, or mixtures thereof, used in suitable amounts.<br><br>

Partially protected pentasaccharide 30<br>
Known pentasaccharide 29 (53 mg, 49 µmol) (R.C. Buijsman et al., Chem. Eur. J. 1996, 2, 12, pl572-1577) was dissolved in dimethylformamide (0.25 mL) and water (1 mL) and treated with iV-(benzyloxycarbonyloxy)-succinimide (18 mg, 72 |imol) and N-ethylmorpholine (18.6 mL). After stirring for 15 min, TLC analysis (ethyl acetate/pyridine/acetic acid/water, 5/7/1.6/4, v/v/v/v) revealed the reaction to be complete and the reaction mixture was directly applied onto a RP-18 column, which was eluted with water/methanol (90/10 to 60/40). The appropriate fractions were pooled and concentrated to a small volume and applied on a Dowex 50 WX4-H' ion-exchange column in water. The eluate was concentrated in vacuo to yield pure 30 (54 mg, 91% yield).<br>
Sulfated pentasaccharide 32<br>

The mixture was subsequently cooled to 0 °C and aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate was added (5 equiv for each eq. of triethylamine sulfurtrioxide complex). The mixture was stirred for 1 h, concentrated to a small volume and applied onto a Sephadex G-25 column, which was eluted with 10 % acetonitril in water. The appropriate fractions were pooled and concentrated to a small volume, which was subsequently passed through a column of Dowex 50 WX4 (Na+ form) eluted with water. The eluate was concentrated and redissolved in 0,2 N hydrogen chloride (1 mL) and allowed to stand for 16 h at 4 °C. The reaction mixture was neutralized with 0.1 N sodium hydroxide and desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column and eluted with 10 % acetonitril in water to afford homogeneous 31. Compound 31 was dissolved in tert-butanol/water (6/1, v/v, 20 mL) containing a few drops of acetic acid.

Using similar methods, the following compounds are prepared:<br><br><br><br><br>
The biological activities of the compounds of the present invention were determined by the following test methods.<br>
L Anti-thrombin assay<br>
Thrombin (Factor Ila) is a factor in the coagulation cascade.<br>
The anti-thrombin activity of compounds of the present invention was assessed by measuring<br>
spectrophotometrically the rate of hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate s-2238 exterted by<br>
thrombin. This assay for anti-thrombin activity in a buffer system was used to assess the IC50-<br>
value of a test compound.<br>
Test medium:	Tromethamine-NaCl-polyethylene glycol 6000 (TNP) buffer<br>
Reference compound: 12581 (Kabi)<br>
Vehicle:	TNP buffer.<br>
Solubilisation can be assisted with dimethylsulphoxide, methanol, ethanoi, acetonitrile or tert.-butyl alcohol which are without adverse effects in concentrations up to 2.5% in the final reaction mixture.<br><br>
Technique	Reagents*<br>
1.	Tromethamine-NaCl (TN) buflfer<br>
Composition of the buffer:<br>
Tromethamine (Tris) 6.057 g (50 mmol)<br>
NaCl	5.844  g   (100 mmol)<br>
Water to	1	1<br>
The pH of the solution is adjusted to 7.4 at 37 °C with HCl (10<br>
mmo1-r").<br>
2.	TNP buflfer<br>
Polyethylene  glycol  6000  is dissolved  in  TN  buffer to  give  a concentration of 3 g-l'<br>
3.	S-2238 solution<br>
One vial S-2238 (25 mg; Kabi Diagnostica, Sweden) is dissolved in 20 ml TN buflfer to give a concentration of 1.25 mg-ml' (2 mmol- 1".<br>
4.	Thrombin solution<br>
Human thrombin (16 000 nKat-vial'; Centraal Laboratorium voor Bloedtransfusie, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) is dissolved in TNP buflfer to give a stock solution of 835 nKat-ml' Immediately before use this solution is diluted with TNP buflfer to give a concentration of 3.34 nKat-ml'.<br>
*    -    All ingredients used are of analytical grade<br>
-    For aqueous solutions ultrapure water (Milli-Q quality) is used.<br>
Preparatipn of test.and reference compound.solutions The test and reference compounds are dissolved in Milli-Q water to give stock concentrations of 10-2 mo1-1r. Each concentration is stepwise diluted with the vehicle to give concentrations of 10-3 10-4 and 10' mo1-r The dilutions, including the stock solution, are used in the assay (final concentrations in the reaction mixture: 3-10-3; 10-3; 3-10-4; 10 ; 3-10-5 10-5 3-10-6 and 10-6 mo1-r', respectively).<br><br>
Procedure<br>
At room temperature 0,075 ml and 0.025 ml test compound or reference compound solutions or vehicle are alternately pipetted into the wells of a microtiter plate and these solutions are diluted with 0.115 ml and 0.0165 ml TNP buffer, respectively. An aliquot of 0.030 ml S-2238 solution is added to each well and the plate is pre-heated and pre-incubated with shaking in an incubator (Amersham) for 10 min. at 37 °C. Following preincubation the hydrolysis of S-2238 is started by addition of 0.030 ml thrombin solution to each well. The plate is incubated (with shaking for 30 s) at 37 °C. Starting after 1 min of incubation, the absorbance of each sample at 405 nm is measured every 2 min. for a period of 90 min. using a kinetic microtiter plate reader (Twinreader plus, Flow Laboratories).<br>
All data are collected in an IBM personal computer using LOTUS-<br>
MEASURE. For each compound concentration (expressed in moll"'<br>
reaction mixture) and for the blank the absorbance is plotted versus the<br>
reaction time in min.	<br>
Evaluation of responses:	For   each  final  concentration  the  maximum  absorbance   was<br>
calculated from the assay plot. The IC50-value (final concentration, expressed in µmo1-r" causing 50% inhibition of the maximum absorbance of the blank) was calculated using the logit transformation analysis according to Hafner et al (Arzneim.-Forsch./Drug Res, 1977; 27(11): 1871-3).<br><br><br>
Il Anti-factor Xa assay<br>
Activated Factor X (Xa) is a factor in the coagulation cascade. The anti-Xa activity of compounds of the present invention was assessed by measuring spectrophotometrically the rate of hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate s-2222 exterted by Xa. This assay for anti-Xa activity in a buffer system was used to assess the IC50-value of the test compound.<br>
In general the followed procedure and test conditions were analogous to those of the anti-thrombin assay as described above. Differences are indicated below.<br>
Reference compound: benzamidine<br>
Vehicle:	TNP buffer.<br>
Solubilisation can be assisted with dimethylsulphoxide, methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile or tert.-butyl alcohol which are without adverse effects in concentrations up to 1% (for DMSO) and 2.5% (for the other solvents) in the final reaction mbcture.<br>
Technique	Reagents*<br>
3.	S-2222 solution	<br>
One vial S-2222 (15 mg; Kabi Diagnostica, Sweden) is dissolved in 10 ml water to give a concentration of 1.5 mg-ml' (2 mmo1-1').<br>
4.	Xa solution<br>
