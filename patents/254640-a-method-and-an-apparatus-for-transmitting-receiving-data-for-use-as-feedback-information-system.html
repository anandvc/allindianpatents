BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a mobile communication system, and<br>
more particularly to an apparatus and a method for selecting and transmitting a<br>
transmission eigenvector in a closed loop multi input multi output (MIMO)<br>
rnobile communication system.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Generally, in a 4G (4th Generation) communication system, which is the<br>
next generation communication system, research is ongoing to provide users with<br>
services having various quality of service ('QoS') and supporting a transmission<br>
speed of about 100 Mbps. Currently, the 3G (3rd Generation) communication<br>
system supports a transmission speed of about 384 kbps in an outdoor channel<br>
environment having a relatively unfavorable channel environment, and supports a<br>
maximum transmission speed of 2 Mbps in an indoor channel environment<br>
having a relatively favorable channel environment.<br>
A wireless local area network (LAN) system and a wireless metropolitan<br>
area network (MAN) system generally support transmission speeds of 20 to 50<br>
Mbps. Further, the 4G communication system has been developed to ensure<br>
mobile station mobility and QoS in the wireless LAN system and the wireless<br>
MAN system supporting relatively high transmission speeds. Accordingly,<br>
research is ongoing to develop a new communication system capable of<br>
supporting a high speed service to be provided by the 4G communication system.<br>
To provide the high speed service (i.e., wireless multimedia service, a<br>
broadband spectrum is used. Inter-symbol interference may occur due to a<br>
multi-path propagation. The inter-symbol interference may deteriorate the entire<br>
transmission efficiency of a system. To compensate for the inter-symbol<br>
interference due to the multi-path propagation as described above, an orthogonal<br><br>
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme has been proposed. In the <br>
OFDM scheme, an entire frequency band is divided into a plurality of subcarriers <br>
and the subcarriers are transmitted. When the OFDM scheme is used, one<br>
symbol duration may increase. Accordingly, the inter-symbol interference can<br>
be minimized.<br><br>
Further, the OFDM scheme is a scheme for transmitting data using<br>
multiple carriers and is a special type of a Multiple Carrier Modulation (MCM)<br>
scheme in which a serial symbol sequence is converted into parallel symbol<br>
sequences and the parallel symbol sequences are modulated with a plurality of<br>
mutually orthogonal subcarriers before being transmitted.<br>
In relation to the OFDM scheme, in 1971, Weinstein, et al. proposed that<br>
the OFDM modulation/demodulation can be efficiently performed using Discrete<br>
Fourier Transform (DFT), which was a driving force behind the development of<br>
the OFDM scheme. Also, the introduction of a guard interval and a cyclic prefix<br>
as the guard interval further mitigates the adverse effects of the multipath<br>
propagation and the delay spread on systems. Although hardware complexity<br>
was an obstacle to the widespread implementation of the OFDM scheme, recent<br>
advances in digital signal processing technology including fast Fourier transform<br>
(FFT) and inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) haveenabled the OFDM scheme<br>
to be implementation in a less complex manner.<br>
The OFDM scheme, similar to an existing Frequency Division<br>
Multiplexing (FDM) scheme, boasts of an optimum transmission efficiency in a<br>
high-speed data transmission because the OFDM transmits data on subcarriers,<br>
while maintaining orthogonality among them. The optimum transmission<br>
efficiency is further attributed to good frequency use efficiency and robustness<br>
against multipath fading in the OFDM scheme. More specifically, overlapping<br>
frequency spectrums lead to efficient frequency use and robustness against<br>
frequency selective fading and multipath fading. The OFDM scheme reduces<br>
effects of ISI through the use of guard intervals and enables the design of a simple<br>
equalizer hardware structure. Furthermore, because the OFDM scheme is robust<br>
against impulse noise, it is increasingly popular in communication systems.<br>
A Multiple Access scheme based on the OFDM scheme is an orthogonal<br>
frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) scheme. In the OFDMA scheme,<br>
some of the subcarriers are reconstructed into a subcarrier set and the subcarrier<br>
set is assigned to a specific mobile subscriber station (MSS). In the OFDMA .<br><br>
scheme, it is possible to perform a dynamic resource allocation capable of<br>
dynamically allocating a subcarrier set assigned to a specific mobile subscriber<br>
station according to fading of a wireless transmission path.<br>
Further, for high speed data transmission, methods using a multiple<br>
antenna in both a transmitter and a receiver have been developed. Starting from<br>
a space time coding (STC) method proposed by Tarokh in 1997, a Bell Lab<br>
Layered Space Time (BLAST) method devised by Bell Laboratories has been<br>
proposed. In particular, since the BLAST method has a transmission rate<br>
linearly increased in proportion to the number of transmission/reception antennas,<br>
it has been applied to a system targeting high speed data transmission.<br>
Existing BLAST algorithms have been used in an open loop method. In<br>
such a case, since the aforementioned dynamic resource allocation is impossible,<br>
a closed loop method has been recently devised. Among the BLAST algorithms,<br>
a representative algorithm is the algorithm for a singular value decomposition<br>
multi input multi output (SVD-MIMO) system, in which a matrix-type channel is<br>
converted into channels corresponding to the number of virtual<br>
transmission/reception antennas by using an SVD technology used in a linear<br>
algebra.<br>
The SVD technology will be briefly described to aid in the understanding<br>
of the SVD-MIMO system.<br>
Before a description on the SVD technology is given, an eigenvalue<br>
decomposition (EVD) will be described. When the product of a m×m square<br>
matrix A by a predetermined vector % having a size of m×1 is equal to the product<br>
λχ of a complex number λ by the vector χ, Equation 1 may be obtained.<br>
Aχ=λχ 	(1)<br>
In Equation 1, the X denotes an eigenvalue of matrix A and the % denotes<br>
an eigenvector. In order to obtain the vector λ, the λ satisfying Equation 2 is<br>
determined.<br>
det(A-λI)=0 	(2)<br>
In Equation 2, the det denotes a determinant of a matrix. The vector χ<br>
satisfying Equation 1 is determined from the X obtained from Equation 2. For<br>
instance, Equation 3 is used to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a matrix<br><br><br>
In Equation 3, the eigenvectors for the λ1=-l and the λ2=2 can be<br>
calculated by Equations 4 and 5.<br><br>
A method for calculating the eigenvectors as described above may be<br>
summarized according to the following steps:<br>
step1) calculate the determinant of the (A- λI);<br>
step 2) calculate a root of step1) and calculate eigenvalues; and<br>
step 3) calculate eigenvectors satisfying the Aχ = λχ for the eigenvalues<br>
calculated in step 2).<br>
When the calculated eigenvectors are linearly independent from each<br>
other, the matrix A may be reconstructed by means of the calculated eigenvalues<br>
and eigenvectors. A matrix D may be defined by Equation 6, in which the<br>
eigenvalues are employed as diagonal elements, and the remaining elements,<br>
except for the diagonal elements, are 0.<br><br>
Further, a matrix S arranging the aforementioned eigenvectors in a<br>
column may be defined by Equation 7.<br><br>
When matrix A is defined on the basis of matrix D defined by Equation 6,<br>
and matrix S defined by Equation 7, matrix A may be expressed by Equation 8.<br><br>
A = SΛS-1 	(8)<br>
A = SΛS-1 	(8)<br>
When the aforementioned example is applied to Equation 8, the<br>
  )<br>
Hereinafter, the SVD will be described based on the aforementioned EVD.<br>
First, the EVD can be obtained only for a square matrix. Accordingly, a<br>
method similar to the EVD may be used for a m×n matrix which is not a square<br>
matrix. That is, when a matrix B, which is not a square matrix, is defined,<br>
matrix B may be factorized as expressed by Equation 10.<br><br>
In Equation 10, the U is the aforementioned m×m unitary matrix and the<br>
eigenvectors of a BBH constitute the columns of the U. The eigenvectors of a<br>
BHB constitute the columns of the V which is a n×n matrix. Further, singular<br>
values (diagonal elements of the matrix D) are square roots of the values (except<br>
for 0) among the eigenvalues of the BBH or the BHB.<br>
The aforementioned SVD can be applied to the MIMO system by the<br>
following method.<br>
When it is assumed that the number of transmission antennas is NT and<br>
the number of reception antennas is NR in the MIMO system, a channel H<br>
carrying data transmitted from a transmitter until the data are received in a<br>
receiver may become a random matrix of NR×NT. In such a case, when the<br>
channel matrix H is separated through the SVD scheme, the matrix H may be<br>
expressed by Equation 11.<br><br>
In Equation 11, the U is a NR×NR unitary matrix and the eigenvectors of a<br>
HHH constitute the columns of the U. The U will be referred to as a reception<br><br>
eigenvector matrix. Further, the eigenvectors of a HHH constitute the columns<br>
of the V which is a NT×NT matrix and the V will be referred to as a transmission<br>
eigenvector matrix. Further, the singular values (diagonal elements of the matrix<br>
D) are the square roots of the values (except for 0) among the eigenvalues of the<br><br>
HHH or the HHH. The D will be referred to as a singular value matrix. Further,<br>
the operator H used as a superscript denotes a complex conjugate transpose<br>
operation (Hermitian).<br>
A communication system using a multiple antenna may be generally<br>
expressed by Equation 12.<br><br>
In Equation 12, the Y denotes a reception symbol matrix of a NR×1 and<br>
the X denotes a transmission symbol matrix of a NT×1. Further, the H denotes a<br>
channel matrix of a NR×NT and the N denotes an additive white Gaussian noise<br>
(AWGN) matrix of the NR×1. The symbol matrix X to be transmitted is<br>
transmitted through the channel of the matrix H. The symbol matrix X is<br>
transmitted to a receiver, and includes the matrix N which is noise component.<br>
The SVD-MIMO system will be described by use of the aforementioned<br>
SVD scheme.<br>
When a transmitter uses a pre-filter such as a matrix V, the transmission<br>
symbol matrix X may be expressed by Equation 13.<br><br>
Further, when a receiver uses a post-filter such as a matrix UH, the<br>
reception symbol matrix Y may be expressed by Equation 14.<br><br>
Accordingly, the SVD-MIMO system in which the transmitter uses the<br>
matrix V as a pre-filter and the receiver uses the matrix U as a post-filter may be<br>
expressed by Equation 15.<br><br>
When Equation 15 is decomposed according to each element of each matrix,<br>
Equation 15 may be expressed as Equation 16. For convenience of description, it is<br>
assumed that NT ≤ NR.<br><br><br>
As expressed by Equation 16, in the SVD-MIMO, a system transmitting<br>
data from a plurality of transmission antennas to a plurality of reception antennas<br>
may be regarded as a multiple single input single output (SISO) system. That is,<br>
the channel matrix H may be simplified as a channel D including diagonal<br>
elements, which are eigenvalues having a less smaller than or equal to min (NT,<br>
NR), by the processing of a matrix V in the transmitter and the processing of a<br>
matrix U in the receiver. As described above, in a state in which the channel H<br>
is rearranged by use of the SVD scheme, the transmitter uses a preprocessor and<br>
the receiver uses a post-processor, if the transmitter only determines the<br>
eigenvector V value, an MIMO channel can be simplified into a plurality of SISO<br>
channels for easy analysis. Further, as described above, the SVD-MIMO system<br>
changes into plural SISO systems employing the λi as channel values. The<br>
transmitter can perform an optimal dynamic allocation on the basis of the<br>
predetermined V and λi. In such a case, the receiver must transmit to the<br>
transmitter information related to the V and information related to the λi.<br>
An OFDM system employing the aforementioned SVD scheme will be<br>
described with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an MIMO system employing an SVD-MIMO<br>
scheme according to the prior art.<br>
FIG. 1 shows an example in which the SVD-MIMO scheme is applied to<br>
the OFDM system. It is noted that the SVD-MIMO scheme can also be applied<br>
to other communication systems, which employ a code division multiple access<br>
(CDMA), a time division multiple access (TDMA) or a frequency division<br>
multiple access (FDMA), etc., in addition to the OFDM system employing the<br>
MIMO.<br>
Data to be transmitted by a transmitter are encoded by a predetermined<br>
channel encoder, etc., before being transmitted. For convenience of description,<br>
a process after the encoding will be described with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, when the encoded data is parallel-converted by a<br><br>
serial-to-parallel (S/P) converter 101, the channel matrix H as described above is<br>
multiplied by the matrix V of Equation 1, for which the SVD has been performed,<br>
in a preprocessing operator 103. Each calculation result obtained through the<br>
multiplication with the matrix V is subjected to an inverse fast Fourier transform<br>
(IFFT) through a plurality of IFFT units 105a to 105n mapped to a plurality of<br>
transmission antennas, and is then transmitted to a receiver through a plurality of<br>
parallel-to-serial converters 107a to 107n and a plurality of transmission antennas<br>
109a to 109n.<br>
The signals transmitted through the plurality (e.g., NT) of transmission<br>
antennas 109a to 109n in a transmitter can be received through a plurality (e.g.,<br>
NR) of reception antennas 111a to 111n in the receiver. That is, the signals<br>
transmitted from the first transmission antenna 109a can be received at each of<br>
the NR reception antennas. Herein, the signals received in each reception<br>
antenna are received through different channels. Similarly, the signals<br>
transmitted from the second transmission antenna or the NT transmission antenna<br>
can be received through the NR reception antennas. Accordingly, the<br>
transmission channel H may be expressed by Equation 17 according to the<br>
channels between the transmission antennas and the reception antennas.<br><br>
The signals transmitted through the transmission channel H are received<br>
through each of the NR reception antennas. The signals received through each of<br>
the reception antennas are parallel-converted through serial-to-parallel converters<br>
113a to 113m and are then subjected to an FFT through FFT units 115a to 115m.<br>
Then, the received signals for which the FFT has been performed are multiplied<br>
by a matrix UH by the aforementioned SVD scheme in a post-processing operator<br>
117 and are then serial-converted by a parallel-to-serial (P/S) converter 119.<br>
Meanwhile, the receiver of the SVD-MIMO system estimates channel<br>
values transmitted from the multiple transmission antenna to the multiple<br>
reception antenna, obtains the matrices V, D and U of the matrix H by use of the<br>
SVD scheme, and feedbacks the obtained information to the transmitter. When<br>
the matrices V and D are transmitted from the receiver to the transmitter, the<br><br>
transmitter can use an optimal resource allocation algorithm according to the<br>
channel conditions on the basis of the λi which is the diagonal elements of the<br>
matrix D and is the singular value of the channel H.<br>
However, in such a case, since the receiver must feedback both the<br>
matrices V and D to the transmitter, a large quantity of feedback information is <br>
required. Further, the SVD system may transmit data through a channel having a <br>
small value among eigenvalues which are elements of the matrix D. In such a<br>
case, the error probability increases, thereby rapidly deteriorating the transmission<br>
efficiency of data. Accordingly, it is necessary to provide a method capable of <br>
more efficiently performing data transmission in the SVD-MIMO system.<br>

eigenvector selection information feedback from a transmission eigenvector<br>
determiner 223 of the receiver, selects the transmission data corresponding to the<br>
number of eigenvectors of the selection information from the encoded and input<br>
data and, then, outputs the selected transmission data. For example, when four<br>
antennas transmit only three data according to the feedback transmission<br>
eigenvector selection information, the transmission data selector 201 selects only<br>
the three information data. The detailed operation of the transmission data<br>
selector 201 according to the present invention will be described later.<br>
The output data of the transmission data selector 201 is input to a serial-<br>
to-parallel (S/P) converter 203 and the serial-to-parallel converter 203 parallel-<br>
converts the serial data. The parallel-converted data is input to a preprocessor 205<br>
and is calculated with a transmission eigenvector matrix V. For example, the<br>
output data obtained through multiplication of a NT×NT matrix V and a NT×1<br>
matrix in the preprocessor 205 are output as the NT×1 matrix. The output data is<br>
information data having the number corresponding to the number of eigenvectors<br>
selected from the input data matrix, and the rest of the data have a value of 0.<br>
The output data of the preprocessor 205 is transmitted to the receiver<br>
through a plurality of transmission antennas 211a to 211c via a plurality of IFFT<br>
units 207a to 207c and parallel-to-serial converters 209a to 209c respectively<br><br>
mapped to the transmission antennas.<br>
Next, the data transmitted through a transmission channel H is received<br>
through a plurality (e.g., NR) of reception antennas 213a to 213c. The data<br>
received through the reception antennas 213a to 213c is parallel-converted<br>
through serial-to-parallel converters 215a to 215c. The parallel-converted data<br>
is subjected to an FFT through FFT units 217a to 217c. The received data for<br>
which the FFT has been performed is multiplied by a UH matrix by the<br>
aforementioned SVD scheme in a post-processing operator 219 and is then serial-<br>
converted by a parallel-to-serial (P/S) converter 221.<br>
The receiver of the SVD-MIMO system determines the channel<br>
conditions through the received signals, calculates a matrix V from a matrix H<br>
estimated from the received signals by use of the SVD scheme, and feedbacks the<br>
calculation information to the transmitter.<br>
A channel estimator 225 performs a channel estimation on the basis of the<br>
signals received through the reception antennas 213a to 213c. The output values<br>
of the channel estimator 225 are subjected to an SVD by an SVD unit 227 and are<br>
then output as a NR×NTmatrix H. The singular values of the channel matrix H,<br>
which is the SVD output result of the SVD unit 227, is input to the transmission<br>
eigenvector determiner 223. The transmission eigenvector determiner 223<br>
according to the present invention analyzes a channel condition according to each<br>
antenna on the basis of the received signals and the singular values obtained by<br>
the SVD scheme, and selects the transmission eigenvectors by use of the analyzed<br>
channel condition according to each antenna.<br>
In the above example, it is assumed that a system has 2 (Nr=2)<br>
transmission antennas and 3 (NR=3) reception antennas, the channel matrix H<br>
may be expressed by Equation 18.<br><br>
As expressed by Equation 18, the singular values are 2 and 3. When<br>
only the singular value 2 is selected, the transmitter receives the transmission<br>
eigenvector 10 corresponding to the singular value 2 and the number 1 of the<br>
selected singular values from the receiver.<br>
The selection method of the transmission eigenvector according to the<br><br>
present invention will be described in detail.<br>
The output signal obtained by calculating the signals received in the<br>
receiver with the U matrix in the post-processing operator 219 becomes a signal<br>
of a DX+N as expressed by Equation 15. Matrix D is the eigenvalues of the<br>
channel matrix H as described above and is aligned according to a sequence from<br>
the largest element toward the smallest element. The magnitude of each value in<br>
matrix D tells whether the channel is in a favorable condition or an unfavorable<br>
condition. Accordingly, matrix D may be expressed by Equation 19.<br><br>
In Equation 19, r is a rank of the channel matrix H and has a value of<br>
r<min nr if the rank of channel matrix h is smaller than number></min>
of transmission/reception antennas, the λi or r<i or nr has a value of in></i>
equation 19. As described above, the λi (1≤i≤r) is the eigenvalue of the channel<br>
matrix H. Herein, if i&gt;j, λi&gt;λi. Herein, the i and j denotes index. That is, the<br>
diagonal elements of the matrix D are arranged according to a sequence from the<br>
largest element toward the smallest element.<br>
As expressed by Equation 19, in the SVD-MIMO system constructed<br>
according to the present invention, the data transmitted through the multiple<br>
antennas does not pass through the channel H. Further, a channel may be<br>
constructed by multiple SISO channels, and the λI to λr may be regarded as an<br>
actual channel. That is, as expressed by Equation 19, the system including the<br>
transmitter processing the matrix V and the receiver processing the matrix U<br>
may be regarded as a system in which overlapping signals or parallel signals are<br>
transmitted from multiple transmission antennas to multiple reception antennas.<br>
Accordingly, when the rank is high, channel capacity can increase.<br>
As described above, the λi (1≤i≤r) is aligned according to a sequence<br>
from the largest element to the smallest element. The size of the λi (1≤i≤r)<br><br>
indicates the high or low quality of a channel condition for each transmission<br>
antenna. Accordingly, when the channel condition is unfavorable for each<br>
transmission antenna and, thus, a predetermined condition is not satisfied, the<br>
present invention does not transmit data through a corresponding eigenvector by<br>
use of the λi (1≤i≤r).<br>
The eigenvector can be selected in order to reduce the error probability<br>
for a transmitted signal. The selection scheme of the eigenvector for reducing<br>
the error probability for the transmitted signal will be described.<br>
As described above, the selective SVD-MIMO system may be regarded<br>
as a parallel combination of multiple SISO systems. Further, the relation<br>
between the transmission data may be expressed by Equation 20.<br><br>
In Equation 20, y' j denotes the jth signal of a NRxlmatrix obtained by<br>
LI<br>
multiplying the received signal by the calculation value (U ) of the post-<br>
processing operator 219, x j denotes an jth transmission signal, and n' j denotes<br>
an jth AWGN signal (variance value of the AWGN is σ2n). Since the λj is a<br>
positive integer, when the y'j is divided by the λj, the variance value of the<br>
  Accordingly, the error probability when the jth data xj (1≤j≤r)<br>
are transmitted may be expressed by Equation 21.<br><br>
In Equation 21, dmin represents the shortest distance in a signal space of<br>
transmission data. σn denotes variance value of channel, and Q denotes Q<br>
function. When it is assumed that an M-quadrature amplitude modulation (M-<br><br>
QAM) signal is transmitted, and the variance of the signal is σ2s, the dmin may be<br>
expressed by Equation 22 and the Q function may be expressed by Equation 23.<br><br>
In Equation 22, dmm represents the shortest distance in a signal space of<br>
transmission data, and σ2s denotes variance value of transmission signal, and M<br>
denotes M-QAM. For example, when the M=4 denotes 4-QAM, and the M=16<br>
denotes 16-QAM.<br><br>
Accordingly, in Equation 21, when the j is sequentially increased from<br>
the smallest λj and thus the average error probability (result of Equation 23) is<br>
greater than a predetermined threshold, data is not transmitted. For example, if<br>
the average error probability (result of Equation 21) is greater than 0.5, an<br>
eigenvector is not selected. Since a method for determining the predetermined<br>
threshold is outside from the subject of the present invention, the detailed<br>
description will be omitted. Meanwhile, when Equation 24 is satisfied, the<br>
transmission of an jth transmission eigenvector is determined based on the jth<br>
singular value.<br><br>
Specifically, the following eigenvector selection method can be<br>
considered in a CDMA system. Since the X values denotes a channel condition<br>
according to each transmission antenna in each SVD-MIMO system as described<br>
above, the λi having the smallest value among all of the λ values denotes a<br>
transmission antenna having the worst channel condition in the SVD-MIMO<br>
system. The λi having the smallest value is expressed by a λmin. Accordingly,<br>
whether to transmit data or not is first determined for a transmission antenna<br>
corresponding to the λmin. Since the λmin is channel information related to the<br>
transmission antenna having the worst channel condition among channels H<br>
transmitted through entire transmission antenna, the λmin satisfies Equation 25.<br><br><br>
According to Equation 25, when noise is not considered, the , which<br>
is a normal value of a signal after the transmission signal x has experienced the<br>
channel H, must be always greater than or equal to the  which is<br>
multiplication of the minimum eigenvalue λmin and a normal value of the<br>
transmission signal x.<br>
Further, when a normal value of a noise signal is greater than half of the<br>
minimum distance, an error occurs. This may be expressed by Equation 26.<br><br>
In Equation 26, dmin is the minimum distance on a constellation in the<br>
modulation in the transmitter. Accordingly, when it is assumed that the set of all<br>
of the transmittable vectors is S, S includes (-1, -1), (-1, +1), (+1, -1) and (+1, +1)<br>
in a case of a binary phase shift keying (BPSK). Meanwhile, in the<br>
communication system using a multiple antenna, the minimum distance dmm may<br>
be expressed by Equation 27.<br><br>
As expressed by Equation 27, the minimum distance dmin of the reception<br>
signal is a minimum value of the distance between the symbols received through<br>
the channel matrix H for each transmission symbol (Si, Sj).<br>
When the H(Si-Sj) in Equation 27 is applied to Equation 25, Equation 28<br>
can be obtained.<br><br>
When Equation 28 is put into Equation 27, Equation 29 can be obtained.<br><br>
In Equation 29, when the minimum distance (i.e., min in the<br>
transmitter is d0, Equation 29 can be expressed as Equation 30.<br><br><br>
In Equation 30, the minimum distance d0 in the transmitter is a constant<br>
value determined according to a modulation scheme. Accordingly, when the<br>
minimum eigenvalue λmin of the channel H is large, the dmin value increases.<br>
Therefore, the error probability is reduced. However, the dmm value is a fixed<br>
value which is not adjustable. When a predetermined channel matrix H is<br>
provided, plural antennas are selected and used according to the present invention.<br>
Therefore, the error probability can be reduced.<br>
That is, when Equation 30 is put into Equation 26, Equation 31 can be<br>
obtained.<br><br>
The criterion for the selection of a transmission antenna according to the<br>
embodiment of the present invention is achieved by Equation 31. In Equation<br>
31, d0 is a constant value as described above and the normal value of the noise<br>
signal is a value measured through the reception signal. In a general CDMA<br>
system, since a transmission signal is multiplied by a spreading sequence before<br>
being transmitted, the transmission power and the power of any noise are very<br>
small for each one chip. The average power of the reception signal is obtained,<br>
so that the power of the noise can be obtained.<br>
As described above, in the matrix D as expressed by Equation 19<br>
obtained from the reception signal by the SVD scheme, whether to select a<br>
transmission antenna or not is determined according to the singular value (i.e., X<br>
value) of each transmission antenna, which is represented by elements<br>
constituting the matrix. In other words, when the λmind0 / 2 value of a right side<br>
is less than the normal value of the noise signal in Equation 31, it is highly<br>
probable that an error has occurred in a signal transmitted through a<br>
corresponding channel. Accordingly, it is not efficient to transmit data through<br>
the corresponding channel.<br>
In contrast, when the smallest λmin value among all of the 1 values<br>
exceeds a predetermined value (i.e., state of a corresponding channel becomes<br>
favorable) and thus the λmind0/2 value is greater than the normal value of the<br>
noise signal, it is preferable to transmit data using the corresponding transmission<br>
antenna. Since the eigenvalues for the rest of the channels are greater than the<br>
λmin value, the eigenvalues satisfy the above condition without determination<br><br>
through Equation 31.<br>
It is preferable to perform the determination for the λ value until the<br>
condition of Equation 31 is not satisfied (i.e., the λmind0/2 value is greater than<br>
the normal value of the noise signal), starting from the λmia value. Further, it is<br>
preferred not to transmit data through a transmission antenna corresponding to<br>
channels satisfying the condition of Equation 31.<br>
The transmission eigenvector selection information determined by the<br>
method as described above is feedback to the transmitter from the receiver.<br>
Then, the transmission data selector 201 selects a transmission antenna according .<br>
to the received transmission eigenvector selection information and transmits data<br>
through the selected transmission antenna. In the present invention proposed as<br>
described above, data is not transmitted through a transmission antenna having<br>
bad channel environment, thereby reducing the error probability.<br>
Meanwhile, it is preferred that the receiver feedbacks not only the<br>
transmission eigenvector selection information but also information on a vector V<br>
in order to employ the SVD scheme as described above. The vector V exists in a<br>
size of (NTxNR) every subcarrier.<br>
When the system is a frequency division multiplexing (FDD) system, the<br>
information feedback from the receiver is used. However, when the system is a<br>
time division multiplexing (TDD) system, it is possible to perform tracking using<br>
the transmitted/received data and the pilot signals without the feedback from the<br>
receiver. In the TDD system, since transmission data and reception data are<br>
time-divided through the same channel environments before being transmitted, it<br>
is possible to determine the channels for the transmission data by use of channels<br>
estimated through signals received from a receiver.<br>
A data transmission/reception process according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention will be described with reference to FIGs. 3 and 4.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating a data transmission method in a<br>
selective SVD-MIMO system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the transmitter receives the transmission eigenvector<br>
selection information from the receiver according to the present invention (step<br>
301). The transmission eigenvector selection information is determined by<br>
estimating a channel condition according to each transmission antenna by means<br>
of the eigenvalues of the matrix D obtained by the SVD.scheme, and determining<br><br>
the eigenvalues (i.e., λ values) according to each channel condition based on<br>
whether or not the error probability of a transmission signal exceeds a reference<br>
value, as described above.<br>
Then, the transmitter selects data to be transmitted according to the<br>
received transmission eigenvector selection information (step 303). The<br>
transmitter maps the data in such a manner that the data is not transmitted through<br>
an eigenvector determined not to be transmitted due to a bad channel condition<br>
according to the received transmission eigenvector selection information.<br>
A mapping process of data and transmission data performed by the<br>
transmission data selector 201 will be described in detail with reference to FIG. 2.<br>
It is assumed that the number of transmission antennas is 4 and the<br>
number of reception antennas is 4 (i.e., NT= 4, NR = 4), and symbols s1, s2, s3<br>
and s4 are initially transmitted. A transmission antenna to be used for the data<br>
transmission is determined by applying the normal value of the noise signal and<br>
the eigenvalues of the matrix D to the conditions of Equations 24 to 31.<br>
When it is assumed that only the fourth antenna experiences a bad<br>
channel in the transmission antenna determination process, the next symbols are<br>
transmitted through only the determined transmission eigenvectors until the<br>
receiver determines the next channel conditions (i.e., the next transmission<br>
eigenvectors are determined). Since the channel condition is not a static<br>
condition, it is preferable to check the channel condition continuously and<br>
periodically.<br>
In the transmitter, the vector symbols in a standby state together with<br>
symbols s5, s6, s7 and s8 are input to the transmission data selector 201. The<br>
transmission data selector 201 selects the input symbols so that the input symbols<br>
are transmitted through only the first to the third transmission antenna according<br>
to the transmission eigenvector selection information feedback from the receiver.<br>
That is, since the first to the third transmission antenna are determined to be used<br>
by the transmission eigenvector selection information, the transmission data<br>
selector 201 calculates the input symbols with the matrix as expressed by<br>
Equation 32, so that the input symbols are mapped to the antennas.<br><br><br>
Accordingly, when the symbols s5, s6, s7 and s8 are input, the input<br>
symbols are multiplied by the matrix as expressed by Equation 32. Then, as a<br>
result of the multiplication, only the symbols s5, s6 and s7 are input to the serial-<br>
to-parallel converter 203. 0 is mapped as the last data value, that is, a data value<br>
calculated with the last eigenvector is 0.<br>
Since the next symbol vector must be transmitted from the symbol s8<br>
again in order to maintain the continuity of the data transmission, the transmission<br>
data selector 201 must remember the symbol having not been transmitted.<br>
After the symbol data to be transmitted is mapped to each antenna by the<br>
transmission data selector 201, the symbol data is calculated with the<br>
transmission eigenvector matrix V according to application of the SVD scheme<br>
(step 305). The symbol data having been calculated with the transmission<br>
eigenvector matrix V is transmitted through each transmission antenna (step 307).<br>
The data reception process according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention will be described with reference to FIG. 4.<br>
FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating a data reception method in a selective<br>
SVD-MIMO system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the receiver receives the data transmitted from the<br>
transmitter (step 401). The received data are calculated with the matrix UH<br>
through the post-processor for application of the SVD scheme (step 403). The<br>
receiver and then performs a channel estimation through the received data (step<br>
405). Next, the receiver performs an SVD for a channel matrix H obtained<br>
through the channel estimation (step 407). As described above, a channel<br>
estimated from an output value obtained through the operation with the matrix UH<br>
has a form similar to the matrix D according to the SVD scheme.<br>
Further, a transmission eigenvector is selected according to the conditions<br>
of Equations 24 to 31 as described in FIG. 2 (step 409). Then, the calculated<br>
transmission eigenvector matrix V information and the transmission eigenvector<br>
selection information are feedback to the transmitter (step 411). As described<br>
above, when the system is the TDD system, the transmission eigenvector matrix<br>
V can be calculated in the transmitter.. Accordingly, it may be impossible to<br><br>
feedback the transmission eigenvector matrix V.<br>
As described above, the data transmission/reception method according to<br>
the embodiment of the present invention has been described with reference to<br>
FIGs. 3 and 4. A method for determining a transmission antenna from a value<br>
channel-estimated for each transmission antenna will now be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 5.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flow diagram illustrating a transmission eigenvector selection<br>
method in a closed loop MIMO system according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, a vector D is first estimated for the received data<br>
through an SVD (step 501). It is assumed that a K value is an NT (step 503).<br>
Then, whether to select a transmission eigenvector is determined each time after 1<br>
is subtracted from the NT value. Further, eigenvectors to be selected are<br>
determined based on the aforementioned Equations 24 to 31 (step 505). The K.<br>
value satisfying the conditions of Equations 24 to 31 is stored (step 507) and 1 is<br>
subtracted from the K value for inspection for the next λ (step 509). A<br>
transmission antenna corresponding to the stored K value is not used for data<br>
transmission.<br>
When a channel condition is favorable for a predetermined λ value and<br>
thus the conditions are not satisfied (step 505), the conditions are not satisfied<br>
even for the next λ value. Accordingly, until the conditions are not satisfied, a<br>
transmission eigenvector not used for data transmission is finally determined as a<br>
transmission eigenvector for the stored k value (step 511).<br>
Further, the determined transmission antenna information is transmitted<br>
to the transmitter and the transmitter does not use the corresponding transmission<br>
antenna in the next transmission. When a corresponding condition does not<br>
occur in the first comparison in the procedure, all antennas are used even in the<br>
next transmission.<br>
In the present invention as described above, a transmission antenna is<br>
determined according to channel conditions in order to improve the reliability of<br>
the transmission in a closed loop MIMO system. This method is capable of<br>
solving the deterioration of the communication reliability when a channel does<br>
not have a full rank, which is the advantage of the conventional MIMO system.<br>
Further, when the method is applied to the next generation system, many<br>
advantages can be obtained. Furthermore, according to the present invention, an<br><br>
eigenvector corresponding to a high singular value is selected and transmitted in a<br>
closed loop MIMO system, thereby elevating the reliability in data transmission.<br>
Although a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been<br>
described for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that<br>
various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing<br>
from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
TITLE : 'A METHOD AND AN APPARATUS FOR<br>
TRANSMITTING/RECEIVING DATA FOR USE AS FEEDBACK<br>
INFORMATION SYSTEM'<br>
This invention relates to a method for transmitting /receiving data for use as<br>
feedback information in a closed loop multi input output (SVD-MIMO) mobile<br>
communication system, the method comprising the steps of ; determining (403)<br>
by a receiver, eigenvalues by applying a singular value decomposition (SVD) of a<br>
channel matrix indicating conditions of channels between transmission antennas<br>
(211a-211c) and reception antennas (213a-213c), and reception antennas<br>
(213a-213c), selecting by the receiver, at least one eigenvalue from among the<br>
eigenvalues using noise of a received data and error probabilities of the<br>
channels, generating, by the receiver, transmission eigenvector selection<br>
information having at least one eigenvector corresponding to the selected at<br>
least one eigenvalue and feedback the transmission eigenvector selection<br>
information from the receiver to a transmitter; and receiving by the transmitter,<br>
the feedback transmission eigenvector selection information at the transmitter,<br>
determining at least one transmission antenna corresponding to the selected at<br>
least one eigenvector included in the received transmission eigenvector selection<br>
information among the transmission antennas, selecting by the transmitter, the<br>
number of transmission data according to the number of the selected at least<br>
one eigenvector, and transmitting, by the transmitter, the transmission data over<br>
the selected at least one transmission antenna to the receiver.</td>
