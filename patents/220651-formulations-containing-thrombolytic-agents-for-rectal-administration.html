DESCRIPTION<br>
FORMULATIONS CONTAINING THROMBOLYTIC AGENTS FOR RECTAL ADMINISTRATION.<br>
The present invention is related to the field of biotechnology, medical sciences 5 and pharmaceutical industry. It is mainly aimed at obtaining formulations for mucosal administration. These formulations contain a thrombolytic agent of peptide or proteic origin as active ingredient and pharmaceutical excipients, such as protease inhibitors, absorption enhancers, stabilizing agents, and others.<br>
Thrombolytic agents used in this invention include streptokinase (SK), tissue 10     plasminogen activator, without discarding the feasibility of using any other molecule with similar thrombolytic features.<br>
Hemorrhoids is one of the rectal pathologies with the highest worldwide incidence, having a prevalence rate of 4 % in the United States and United Kingdom (Johanson JF, Sonnenberg A. The prevalence of hemorrhoids and chronic<br>
15 constipation, an epidemiological study. Gastroenterology 1990; 98:380). Hemorrhoids are abnormally swollen veins in the rectum and anus. Hemorrhoids are abnormally large or symptomatic conglomerates of blood vessels, supporting tissues, and overlying mucous membrane or anorectal skin venous swelling of the venous plexus of the rectal or anus mucous. It is called internal hemorrhoids when<br>
20 the upper plexus veins are damaged; they are located over the anal canal and are covered with mucous. The lower plexus veins are located below the region where anus and rectum converge and are covered with external skin. The drainage system of this zone lacks valves and for this reason the erect position of man rises pressure   inside   hemorrhoid   veins,   predisposing   condition   to   hemorrhoidal<br>
25 disease. Acomplication of  hemorrhoid may be produced due to its strangulation that develops a dark color as a result of underlying thrombosis.<br>
There are many formulations in the form of suppositories or rectal ointments for local application, for the treatment of this pathology. These preparations contain anesthetics, anti-inflammatory, or anti-itching, such as ERCAL, SHERIPROCT, 30 ULTRAPROCT, XYLOPROCT, PROCTAXID, PROCTOGLYVENOL (Rosenstein E. Pharmaceutical specialty Dictionary. Fortieth first edition 1995, 778, 1539,<br><br>
1730, 1798, 1437, 1436). The main action of aforementioned formulations is a decrease in swelling and reduction of pain.<br>
Different clinical studies have been currently carried out using vasodilators (topical nifedipine and anticoagulants such as heparin cream, which have shown some 5 effectiveness and adverse events in the treatment of this disease (Perrotti P, Antropoli C, Molino D, De Stefano G, Antropoli M. Conservative treatment of acute thrombosed external hemorrhoids with topical nifedipine, (Dis Colon Rectum 2001 44(3):405-409)).<br>
Besides, there are other treatments that are used in hemorrhoids (grade I and II) 10 such as sclerosant injections, photocoagulation, hemorrhoidectomy, cryosurgery and LASER. But these treatments also have disadvantages since specialized personnel and equipment are required and attendance to medical centers is obligatory.<br>
Sometimes complications may occur in grade III and IV hemorrhoids because of 15 thrombosis (acute hemorrhoidal disease) and the above mentioned drugs and treatments do not cure this pathology, being necessary to remove the thrombi by means of surgery (Thrombectomy) (Bleday R, Breen E. Clinical Features of hemorrhoids. Sabiston. Textbook of surgery 16 edition, 2001: 980-986). This operation in acute phase produces a lot of discomfort and inconveniences which 20 affect the patient's quality of life, as well as some risks of post-operation complications (Goldman: Cecil Textbook of medicine 21st Ed., Chapter 143 -Diseases of the rectum and anus 570-572).<br>
A non-surgical treatment of acute hemorrhoid disease would be very advantageous since it would avoid all the above-described inconveniences, even 25 in those cases where hemorrhoidectomy would be needed, since this type of treatment would allow the patient to undergo surgery with a better quality of life and less complications.<br>
Thrombolytic agents have the ability to lyse thrombi and restore venous flow in the<br>
anal   canal,   which  would   be   possible   using   agents   such   as   tissue-type<br>
30     plasminogen activator (t-PA), urokinase (u-PA) and streptokinase (SK), because<br>
of its thrombolytic and anti-inflammatory effect. Mechanism of action of each one<br><br>
these agents is different, in the case of t-PA, ternary complex is formed with the fibrin in the clot and plasminogen, causing the activation of plasminogen that is converted into plasmin, which is the enzyme responsible for the lysis of blood clots. (Zamarron C, Lijnen HR, Collen D. Kinetics of the activation of plasminogen<br>
5 by natural and recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, J Biol Chem, 1984; 259: 2080-2083); In the case of u-PA, it is a proteolytic enzyme that acts directly on plasminogen which is responsible for fibrin clot degradation achieving thrombolytic effect (Schneider P, Bachmann F, Sauser D. Urokinase: a short review of its properties and of its metabolism. In D'Angelo A, de. Urokinase: basic<br>
10 and clinical aspects. London: Academic Press, 1982; 1-15). t-PA and u-PA have been used as fibrinolitic in some diseases of thrombotic origin like pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and others by parenteral administration. (Ouriel K, Veith FJ. Acute lower limb ischemia: determinants of outcome, Surgery 1998; 124:336-342   109);   (Manteiga   R,   Souto   C,   Altes   A,   et   al.   Short-.course<br>
15 thrombolysis the first line of therapy for cardiac valve thrombosis, J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1998; 115:780-784). Recombinant Streptokinase (rSK) pharmacologyc effect, the same as natural SK, is the fibrinolisys activation, where the final pass in fibrinolityc cascade is the formation of plasmin increasing fibrinogen product degradation (Chesebro J H, Knatterud G, Roberts R, et al.<br>
20 Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) Trial, Phasek. A comparison between intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and intravenous Streptokinase. Clinical Findings through hospital discharge. Circulation 1987; 76:142-154).<br>
The anti-inflammatory effects are due to the enzymatic transformation of plasminogen into plasmin cleaving fibrinogen, fibrin or both, located in inflamed<br>
25 zone or in the clot favoring their drainage and diminishing the inflammation and edema (Rosenstein E. Pharmaceutics specialty Dictionary de. Fortieth first edition 1995, 778,1539,1730,1798,1437,1436). Therefore a combination in a formulation of more than one thrombolytic agent or the combination of this agent with anti¬inflammatory could be obtained a better efficacy in thrombotic disease like acute<br>
30     hemorrhoidal disease.<br>
Streptokinase is high molecular weight protein which nowadays is using for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, permanent vascular access thrombosis and other disease with thrombotic origin. In this way<br><br>
 presented in different pharmaceutic/; form like lyophilized for parenteral use Also it has also been used for mucosal administration, for example. VARIDASE, for edema relieve of inflammatory process or in orally administered pills. It has also been reported rectal administration with the main objective of systemic action<br>
5 for the treatment of hematoma re-absorption or just for comparing its concentration in the blood after rectal and oral administration (Oliven A, Gidron E. Orally and rectally administered Streptokinase. Investigation of its absorption and activity, Pharmacology 1981; 22(2): 135-138); (de Boer AG, Moolenaar F, de Leede LG,  Breimer DD.  Rectal drug administration: Clinical  pharmacokinetic<br>
10    considerations, Clin Pharmacokinet 1982; 7(4): 285-311).<br>
The use of rectal formulation mentioned in this invention which has thrombolytic agents for the treatment of acute hemorrhoidal disease, is very convenient for treating this pathology locally, it is non invasive, not painful and without complication for the patient, due to the capacity of eliminating the thrombi and 15     inflammation of the affected zone.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main objective of this invention is to obtain pharmaceutical formulation and its application in the form of suppository, which has thrombolytic agent as raw material, in an appropriate base for treatment of hemorrhoidal disease with 20     thrombotic origin, having account its thrombolytic and anti-inflammatory action.<br>
In this invention we described the obtaining of a solid pharmaceutical form, elaborated for insertion in the rectal mucosa dedicated to exercise a local action. The suppositories of the present invention are elaborated by mixing an oleaginous<br>
25 base, with the additives as preservatives, proteases inhibitors and the presence or absence of the absorption enhancers. Constant agitation is maintained so that the mixture cools down gradually until a temperature between 30 and 40 °C is reached, allowing the incorporation of a thrombolytic agent, dispersing it by even agitation. The resulting mixture is spilled in cold molds of suppositories where the<br>
30 one filled is carried out in excess. This mixture is let to cool down until solidification and the excess is eliminated before the ejection of the suppositories. The suppositories are then stored to a temperature between 2 and 8 °C.<br><br>
The formulations in form of suppositories described in this invention have as an advantage, just local effect as thrombolytic and anti-inflammatory, without causing none of these effects to systemic level.<br>
Thrombolytic agents to be used are: SKr (Estrada M P, Hernandez I, et al. High 5 level expression of streptokinase in Escherichia coli. Biotechnology 1992; 10: 1138-1142). in a concentration between 50000 and 1500000 Ul/g. T-PA is the other thrombolytic agent (Harris TJR. Second - generation plasminogen activators, Protein Engineering 1987; 1(6): 449-458), in a concentration between 500000 and 50000000 Ul/g, among others.<br>
10 In this invention certain additives are used, such as: proteases inhibitors and absorption enhancers (Amyn P, Sayani and Yie, Chien.W. Systemic Delivery of Peptides and Proteins Across Absorptive Mucosae. Critical ReviewsTM in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems 1996; 13(1 2): 85-184); (Lee W TO, Ennis R D, Longenecker J P, and bengtsson P. The bioavailability of intranasal calcitonin in<br>
is healthy voluntiers with and without to permeation enhancer. Pharm. Head 1994; 11: 747); (Loughuth P, Merkic H P, Amidon OR L. Oral absorption of peptides: The effect of absorption site and enzyme inhibition on the systemic availability of metkephamide. Pharm Res1994; 11:528-535); (Nakanishi K, Masukawa T, Farmhouse M, Nadai T. Improvement of the rectal bioavailability of latamoxef<br>
20     sodium by adjuvants following administration of to suppository. Biol Pharm Bull 1994;  17(11):  1496-500). Specifically such promoters were used as: quelant agents (0.05%-10%), tensoactives agents (0.03%-8%), sodium salts (0.01%-10%), and the sodium diclofenac (0.1-10%), with satisfactory results. Proteases inhibitors were also selected because of their ability to inhibit the<br>
25 enzymes responsible for degradation of peptides in the administration area. Some inhibitors protect specific peptides and others stabilize a wide range of them. However it is necessary to keep in mind that the inhibitor does not affect the integrity of the membrane, being this, one of the main problems to face by the use of this type of substances (NishihataT, Howard J. Absorption-promoting adjuvants:<br>
30 enhancing action on rectal absorption. Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 1997; 28: 205-228). in this invention the quelant agents were used in concentrations among 0.02%-5% with good results (Sayani TO P, Kim D D, Frenkl T L, Chun I K, Wang AND J, and Chien AND W. Transmucosal delivery of enkephalins: Comparative enhancing effects of dehydrofusidates and bile salts, Sci. Tech.<br><br>

Furthermore synthetic bases are obtained by chemical methods, such as Novata<br>
and Witepsol. These bases present low melting, that's why they are quickly melt<br>
inside the rectum releasing the active principle for posterior therapeutic effect. IO     (Fauli I Thrashes Treated C. of Pharmacy Galenica 2000, Editorial Luzon 5, S.A<br>
of Editions Madrid; 77 -103, 739 - 774).<br>
In the aqueous phase of the formulation preservative agents are used, like methyl<br>
and propyl parabens (0.01-5%).<br>
The   suppositories   described   in   this   invention   are   capable   of   producing 15     thrombolytic and, anti-inflammatory actions, locally in the rectal mucosa.  Figure1 Results of the rectal irritation index by groups.<br>

Example1  Formulation of suppositories containing  SKr and  tPA as active<br>
principle.<br>
Formulation A: Novata or Wetepsol is melt in bano de Maria at 55°C. Methyl and 30     propyl parabeno (0.01 - 0.5%) is added continuously at constant agitation until a<br>
homogenous dispersion is reached. The dispersion is cool down up to 36 - 40 °C,<br>
afterwards t-PA (500000-50000000 Ul/g) is incorporated with constant agitation.<br>
The mixture is then spilled in cold molds for suppositories of 2-3 g. Suppositories<br>
are let to solidify and the excess is removed until final ejection.<br><br>
Formulation B: It is elaborated according to procedure described in A, but EDTA<br>
(0.05-10%) is also added.<br>
Formulation B1: It is elaborated according to procedure described in A1, but<br>
EDTA (0.05 -10%) is also added. 5     Formulation C: It is elaborated according to procedure described in B but sodium<br>

EXAMPLE 2: Assessment of the rectal irritability of formulations.<br>
The procedure to determine rectal irritability is carried out according to described<br>
method (PNT/TEC/0210 / rectal Irritability / G.Garcia; 1995) 20     They are used in the study of healthy F1, NZ &amp; SGB albino rabbits (female), from<br>
the same line, with average weight of 2.35 kg. The animals are randomly<br>
distributed in six groups of three. Rabbits remain in quarantine for 5 days with<br>
food and water ad libitum. In each case formulations are applied every 24 hours,<br>
for 5 days in a row. 25    Animals were distributed as follows:<br>
GROUP I	Non-treated, control group<br>
GROUPS   FROM   Treated with formulations A, B, C, D, AND respectively as<br>
II TO VI	in the example 1.<br>
Then, histopathological, macroscopic and microscopic assessment of the rabbits<br>
rectal mucous is carried out and rectal irritability index is calculated.<br>
During and after completing the test, no evidence of macroscopic changes was<br>
observed in the rectal mucous, nor symptoms neither signs of their presence, 30     such as edema, erythema and secretions.<br><br>
Then, the microscopic assessment of the rectal tissue reaction for each one of the formulations was carried out. Parameters, such as leucocitary infiltration, vascular congestion and edema were analyzed, calculating the rectal irritation rates. The results are shown in the Figure 1. 5     This study showed that prepared suppositories did not irritate the rectal mucous since, as shown in the figure No.1, the irritability index was in the interval from 0 to 0.4 in all the cases, value that was below the index of minimum irritability. When evaluating the formulations containing tPA as active substance, a similar result was achieved.<br>
10     Example 3: Thrombosed Hemorrhoid Biomodel<br>
The Biomodel was prepared by applying croton oil into the anus region of female rabbits F1 (N2&amp;SGB), with average weight of 2-2,5 Kg. Cotton embedded in inducing solution (consisting of water, pyridine, diethyl ether and 6% croton oil) was introduced into the anus.<br>
15   The following conditions were optimum to perform the model: An applicator embedded in 800 μL of induces solution was inserted into the anus of 12-15-weeks female rabbits for 60 seconds. The edema evolution was lineal up to 10 hours after the application, and its severity has remained almost stable during 30 hours. Macroscopic observations from 4 to 30 hours after having applied the<br>
20 solution shown a homogeneous and constant swelling in the region where croton oil was applied. Histological observations showed appearance of edema, infiltration of fibrin, vasodilatation, blood congestion, inflammatory cells, and necrosis in the mucosal epithelium. This model was useful for assessing the thrombolytic effect of tested products, as well as the anti-inflammatory activity of<br>
25     different formulations.<br>
Table 1: Clinical observations of the anus after 60-second exposure with inducing solution. See Fig 2 and 3<br><br>
Time of observation (Hrs)	Exposure for 60 seconds<br>
4	Well-defined edema, reddening<br>
10	Congestion, edema, vesicle formation<br>
24	Well-definition blisters, reddened erythema<br>
30	Severe swelling, mucopurulentous secretion, blisters, presence of some ulcers<br>
48	Moderate swelling, some blisters, and necrotic ulcers<br><br>
Example 4 Evaluation of the thrombolytic effect and anti-inflammatory activity in different formulations A,A'; B,B'; C,C; D,D'; E,E'<br>
This assay should be followed up in details ej.3; rabbits F1 (NZ x SGB), 2-3 Kg, 5 were fastened for 12 hours before experimentation, but were allowed free access to water. In these studies, rabbits were randomly distributed in five groups of 8 animals. Before the administration of suppositories, rectal biopsies were obtained from 3 rabbit controls, in these animals, the presence of thrombus was evaluated by histological exams. Following the administration of different formulations of<br>
1O suppositories, blood samples were collected at baseline and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after administration. Serum was used for the quantification of C-reactive protein (CRP); citrate plasma was used for the measurement of haemostatic and coagulation parameters; prothrombin time, partial thromboplastine time, plasma concentrations of fibrinogen or fibrin degradation<br>
15     Products  (PDF)   by  chromogenic  substrate.   Macroscopic  observations   and histological   examinations  were  performed;   rectal   damage  was  scored   on pathological findings according to the type and degree of mucosal damage on the rectum. Figure 4 shows the results to all different formulations of suppositories and<br>
20 pharmacological response observed to dissolve the thrombus. Generally, little of every formulation difference has been found in the effectiveness of different suppositories, but the best results were obtained with the formulations with sodium salicylate and EDTA (D,D'). The results are expressed as % of thrombolysis and both formulations were greater than 66% . All in all, our studies<br>
25 demonstrated that the placebo suppository does not exert lysis above blood clotting and no damage was observed in the rectal mucosa. The other control group (4) does not receive the formulations because we need to know the cross-reaction between the physiologic mechanism and the formulations to eliminate the thrombus, these data indicate that such effects are characteristic<br>
30 Example 5: Clinical study carried out patients with Acute Hemorrhoids disease.<br>
The patient's symptoms carrier of thrombosed hemorrhoids is painful and uncomfortable. If it is the first episode, the medical treatment can solve the problem in a short period of time. When the episodes reappear it is necessary to<br><br><br>
do a minimal surgical treatment thrombectomy with the consequent affectation of the quality of live of the patient.<br>
A phase II clinical trial was design with the objective of evaluating the effect of a 5     new suppository formulation as a method for the treatment of the hemorrhoidal disease in acute phase.<br>
1<br>
In this clinical trial twenty four patient were included (Divided in three groups of eight patient each one) with diagnosis of Acute Thrombosed hemorrhoids disease. The patients were hospitalized an average of four days. 10<br>
Group I	Treated with SKr suppository + the usual medical treatment.<br>
Group II	Treated with tPA suppository + the usual medical treatment<br>
Group III	Control Group treated with the usual medical treatment that consist in:<br>
Rest in Trendelenburg position, Plenty of liquids Warm baths<br>
Use of the cushion of Kelly Pain relieve Use of oral laxatives The inclusion and exclusion criteria were: Inclusion<br>
Age between 18 and 50 years Signed Informed Consent 15     Pain for more than 48 hours after the appearance of the symptoms Hemorrhoidal package protrusion maintain for more than 48 hours Exclusion<br>
Patients with contraindications for the use of thrombolitic drugs. In the Case Report Form of each patient was included the personal information, 20 the demographic characteristics, the disease characteristics, the evaluation of the efficacy and the adverse events of each of the treatments used in the study. The results were compared using the Chi cuadrado test and the Fisher test. Tables with the result found were created.<br><br>
Table 2. Parameters evaluated for each one of the treatment.<br><br>
Parameters evaluated	SKr suppository (N=8)	tPA suppository (N=8)	Usual medical treatment (N=8)<br>
	N	%	N	%	N	%<br>

Suspension  of the treatment in study	1	12.5	3	37.5		<br>
* p &gt; 0.001<br>
Analyzing the parameters evaluated we observe that from the clinical point of view the pain, edema and regression of the thrombus have an important value and as a<br>
5 matter of facts the higher percentage of healing is reached using the SKr formulation. Nevertheless, this is not statistically significant because of the scarce number of patients evaluated. In relation with the surgery treatment, minimal parameter that measure the end point of response we did observe a statistic significance (table 1). The duration of the treatment behaved in the same way,<br>
IO     favoring the tPA and SKr formulations but for less time with the SKr formulation.<br>
Table 3. Response to the treatment selected.<br><br>
Response    to    the treatment	SKr suppository	tPA suppository	usual medical treatment<br>
Total	6	(75%)	4	(50%)	3	(37.5%)<br>
Partial	1	(12.5%)	2	(25%)	1	(12.5%)<br>
No response	1	(12.5%)	2	(25%)	4	(50%)<br>
From twenty-four patients treated thirteen had total response to the treatment used  (54.1%).  The efficacy of the  response favored  significantly the  SKr is     formulation (75%)(Table III) compare with the patients treated with tPA and the usual medical treatment. (Figure 6 and 7).<br><br>
The results of this study showed that the use of the suppository via rectal for the acute hemorrhoidal disease improve significantly the healing and reduce the swelling.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE PROPOSED SOLUTION<br>
5 With the formulations of the present invention it is possible to achieve the elimination of the thrombus with the consequent decrease of the inflammation and pain in the affected zone, without systemic thrombolyticeffects. Besides, this allows solving the pathology locally, in a neither painful nor invasive way. Do not require of a specialized personal or equipment for his application and it make<br>
10 possible the treatment of the acute hemorrhoidal disease in a non-surgical way avoiding the inconvenient inherent to this kind of treatment.<br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A rectally administrable suppository composition for treating hemorrhoid diseases,<br>
said composition comprising:<br>
(a)	peptides and proteins providing active thrombolytic action;<br>
(b)	active substances selected from a group comprising of absorption promoters and protease inhibitors; and<br>
(c)	pharmaceutically acceptable excipient selected from a group comprising oil base and preservers;<br>
characterized in that the proteins and peptides are selected from the group comprising of streptokinase in a concentration of 50 000 - 1 500 000 IU/g, urokinase in a concentration of 50 000 - 1 000 000 IU/g, and/or tisular activator of plasminogen in a concentration of 500000 - 50000000 IU/g.<br>
2.	The composition as claimed in claim 1, wherein the absorption promoters are selected from a group comprising sodium diclofenac and/or sodium salicylate.<br>
3.	The composition as claimed in claim 1, wherein the protease inhibitor is EDTA.<br>
4.	The composition as claimed in claim 1 wherein the proteins and peptides is a<br>
recombinant streptokinase.<br>
