				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a one piece plastic molded hollow roof for a<br>
vehicle cab and in particular to a roof having integrally molded and separated inlet<br>
and outlet air ducts within the hollow roof.<br>
2. Description of Related Art<br>
U. S. Patent 5.690.549 discloses a roof for a vehicle cab that comprises a<br>
hollow plastic body molded in one piece and defining a cavity therein. The body<br>
includes an inner partition wall extending between the upper roof surface and the<br>
lower roof surface to define a well bounded by the partition wall. The partition wall<br>
separates the well from the cavity of the hollow body. The entire cavity within the<br>
hollow body serves as an inlet air duct having one or more inlets. A blower mounted<br>
in an aperture in the partition wall draws air into the cavity. The blower draws air into<br>
the well which houses a heater core and an air evaporator coil. From the well, the air<br>
is discharged downward, into the interior of the vehicle cab. This structure uses the<br>
entire cavity of the hollow roof as a single inlet air duct. The air outlets are limited to<br>
the well area and the well is limited to the regions in the roof having sufficient space<br>
to package the heater core and evaporator coil. These may not be optimum locations<br>
for the air outlets.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention overcomes the above disadvantages by providing the<br>
one piece plastic molded hollow body roof with multiple interior cavities sealed from<br>
one another, forming at least one inlet air duct and at least one outlet air duct. The<br>
ducts are sealed from one another to prevent air from flowing between the ducts. By<br>
providing separate inlet air ducts and outlet air ducts, the location of the outlet<br>
openings is not dictated by the location of the chamber containing the heater core<br>
and evaporator coil. The outlet locations can be better optimized for operator<br>
comfort.<br>
The roof is rotationally molded. A first charge of resin forms the outer solid<br>
surface layers of the hollow body. The solid surface layers generally in the form of<br>
upper and lower panels that are spaced from one another to create a single cavity<br>
within the hollow body. The upper and lower panels are widely spaced in regions of<br>
the roof that form the air ducts and are closely spaced in regions of the roof about<br>
the periphery of the air ducts. After the outer surface layer is molded, additional resin<br>
is dumped into the interior of the hollow body. This additional resin contains a<br>
foaming agent. During the rotational molding process, the second resin charge coats<br>
the interior of the outer solid surface layer. Once the second resin charge reaches a<br>
predetermined temperature, the foaming agent is activated, causing the resin to<br>
foam and expand. In those regions where the upper and lower panels are closely<br>
spaced, the foam will expand to completely fill the void between the solid surface<br>
layers, bonding the layers to one another. The foam structure seals the air ducts<br>
from one another.<br>
The foam is preferably rigid to add strength to the plastic molded hollow body.<br>
The foam also provides insulation for sound and as well as heat and cold. Bonding<br>
the upper and lower panels to one another at numerous locations in the roof further<br>
strengthens the roof.<br>
The roof of the present invention is formed with an open chamber, preferably<br>
open from above. The open chamber houses the heater core and evaporator coil. A<br>
blower is provided between the open chamber and each outlet duct. The blower<br>
forces air into the associated outlet air duct for discharge into the interior of the cab.<br>
The blowers produce a reduced pressure in the chamber, drawing air through the<br>
inlet air ducts into the open chamber. The inlet air ducts have air inlets located inside<br>
and/or outside of the cab for recirculating air or for drawing in fresh air from outside<br>
the cab. The open chamber allows the heater core, evaporator coil, blowers and<br>
other mechanical components to be easily mounted to the roof. After these<br>
components are installed, a cover is placed over the chamber opening to close the<br>
chamber.<br>
Rotational molding with a foam core is the preferred method for making the<br>
roof of the present invention. The roof can by made by twin sheet thermoforming or<br>
by SMC panels molded together at seams about the inlet and outlet air ducts to seal<br>

Fig. 3 is a sectional view of the roof of the present invention as seen from line<br>
3-3 of Figs 1 and 2.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODJMENT<br>
The vehicle roof of the present invention is shown in Fig. 1 and designated<br>
generally at 10. The roof 10 includes a single one-piece plastic molded hollow body<br>
12 that is preferably formed by a rotational molding process. The hollow body 12 is a<br>
single piece molding and, due to its shape, it can be described as generally having<br>
an upper panel 14 shown in Fig. 1 forming the upper surface and a lower panel 16<br>
shown in Fig. 2 forming the lower surface. The upper and lower panels are joined at<br>
the periphery of the roof and at several locations throughout the roof as described<br>
below.<br>
The body 12 is molded with an open chamber 18 formed near the rear of the<br>
mounting. The chamber 18 is open from above and formed by a recess in the upper<br>
panel 14 where the upper panel is recessed downward toward the lower panel 16.<br>
The hollow body 12 is formed with multiple cavities that are sealed from one<br>
another to form inlet and outlet air ducts within the hollow body 12. Inlet air ducts 20<br>
are formed along the right and left lateral sides 21, 23 of the roof. The inlet air ducts<br>
20 are generally identical on each side of the roof. The inlet air ducts have both a<br>
fresh air inlet 22 and a recirculation air inlet 30. The fresh air inlet begins with an<br>
upwardly projecting recess 24 formed in the lower panel 16. A louvered grill 25<br>
covers the recess 24. Air flows forward from the recess 24 into a larger recess 27<br>
that is covered by a removable access panel 28 (Fig. 2). From there, the air moves<br>
upward, through an opening 29 in the lower panel 16 that carries an air filter, not<br>
shown. Once air flows through the filter, it enters the inlet air duct 20 formed between<br>
the upper and lower panels. The inlet air duct extends rearward above the recesses<br>
27 and 24 and extends behind the open chamber 18. An opening along the rear of<br>
the open chamber allows air to flow into the chamber 18. The lower panel 16 also<br>
has an opening 31 that forms the recirculation inlet 30 into the inlet air duct 20. A<br>
recirculation air filter (not shown) is disposed in the opening 31. The flat portion 32 of<br>
the lower panel 16 rests upon the upper surface of the vehicle cab roll over<br>
protective structure.<br>
The air passage from the louvered grill to the open chamber 18 is arranged<br>
with the inlet grill at the rear corners of the roof because the air is generally cleaner<br>
there than at other areas under the roof. The air passage has a first lower portion<br>
that extends forward from the grill to locate the air filter closer to the steps to the cab<br>
(not shown) where the filter can be easily reached for changing. The access panel<br>
28 is made removable for the purpose of changing the filter. Past the filter, the air<br>
passage then extends rearward through the molded duct 20, forming a second<br>
raised portion, to the rear of the open chamber 18. The second raised portion is<br>
above the first lower portion of the passage defined by the recesses 24 and 27 in the<br>
lower panel 16.<br>
Outlet air ducts 34 extend forward from the open chamber 18 generally<br>
parallel to the inlet air ducts 20. The outlet air ducts have one or more outlets 36<br>
through which air is discharged into the interior of the vehicle cab. A blower 40 is<br>
placed between the chamber 18 and each of the outlet air ducts 34 to draw air from<br>
within the chamber 18 and into the ducts 34, where the air is discharged through the<br>
outlets 36 and into the vehicle cab. The blowers also produce a reduced pressure<br>
within the chamber 18 and the inlet air ducts 20 to draw air through the inlet air ducts<br>
into the open chamber 18..<br>
An air conditioning evaporator coil 42 is placed in the chamber 18 immediately<br>
in front of the opening from the inlet air ducts. Immediately forward of the evaporator<br>
coil is a heater core 44. Air drawn into the chamber 18 by the blowers 40 must pass<br>
through the evaporator coil 42 and heater core 44 for proper temperature<br>
conditioning of the air prior to discharge into the vehicle cab. The chamber 18 is<br>
opened from above to provide access for installation and maintenance of the<br>
evaporator coil, heater core, blowers and associated mechanical equipment. Once<br>
assembled, a cover member 46 is placed over the top of the open chamber to close<br>
and seal the chamber.<br>
With reference to Fig. 3, the internal structure of the plastic hollow body 12 is<br>
shown in greater detail. The air ducts 20 and 34 are formed in regions of the roof<br>
where the upper and lower panels 14, 16 are widely spaced from one another. The<br>
upper panel 14 and lower panel 16 are closely spaced in regions about the periphery<br>
of the ducts 20 and 34, such as the region 48 between the ducts. The upper and<br>
lower panels are formed by rotationally molding a solid surface layer from a first<br>
charge of resin in a rotational mold cavity. After the solid surface layer is molded<br>
forming a hollow body, a second charge of resin is discharged into the interior of the<br>
hollow body while the hollow body remains in the rotational mold. This second<br>
charge of resin contains a foaming agent. The second charge will first melt and<br>
completely coat the inner surface of the solid surface layer. Once the second charge<br>
of resin reaches a predetermined temperature, the foaming agent is activated and a<br>
layer of foam 50 will be formed on the interior of the solid surface layer. In the<br>
regions where the solid surface layers are closely spaced to one another, such as<br>
the region 48, the foam layer 50 will span completely between the solid surface<br>
layers. This creates a seal between the adjacent air ducts, preventing air flow<br>
therebetween. The foam has an inner skin that prevents air from seeping through the<br>
foam. The foam is preferably rigid to add stiffness to the hollow body 12. In addition,<br>
the joining of the upper and lower panels to one another at various locations adds to<br>
the stiffness of the roof structure. In the preferred embodiment, both the solid surface<br>
layer and the foam layer are molded of polyethylene.<br>
The roof of the present invention utilizes the inner foam layer to seal separate<br>
cavities in the roof to form inlet and outlet air ducts. This enables the air outlets to be<br>
located at various positions in the roof to better optimize the air conditioner and<br>
heater performance. A headliner will be installed on the lower panel 16 that may<br>
provides covers for the inlet and outlet openings and an esthetically pleasing interior<br>
surface. If desired, a cover panel may cover the upper panel 14.<br>
The invention should not be limited by the above-described embodiment, but<br>
should be limited solely by the claims that follow.<br>
