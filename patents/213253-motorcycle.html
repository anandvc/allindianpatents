Description <br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a motorcycle having a taillight at a rear portion thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
In a background art, there is a motorcycle arranged with a taillight at a rear portion thereof and provided with a tail cover to cover the taillight (refer to, for example, JP-A-2002-193160, JP-A-2003-72 624).<br>
Meanwhile, it is conceivable to enlarge a dimension of a taillight (hereinafter, also referred to as a width of a taillight') in a vehicle width direction of a motorcycle in order to promote visual recognizability of the taillight. By enlarging the width of the taillight, the taillight becomes easy to recognize visually by a driver of a trailing automobile or a rider of a trailing motorcycle.<br>
However, in a straddle-straddle-ridina type motorcycle having a fuel tank rearward from a handle and having a seat rearward from the fuel tank, when the width of the taillight is excessively widened, a tail cover covering the taillight from left and right sides is projected in the vehicle width<br>
1<br><br>
direction, and ridability of a rider to and from the motorcycle is deteriorated. For example, when the rider moves up the foot to ride on the straddle-riding type motorcycle, the tail cover constitutes a hindrance.<br>
Further, when the width of the taillight is excessively widened and the taillight and the tail cover are projected in the vehicle width direction, an aerodynamic performance of the motorcycle is deteriorated.<br>
The invention has been carried out in view of such a situation and it is an object thereof to provide a motorcycle promoting visual recognizability of a taillight while maintaining ridability of a rider excellently.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a motorcycle including: a steering shaft; a vehicle body frame extended rearward from the steering shaft; a seat supported by the vehicle body frame; a fuel tank arranged between the steering shaft and the seat; a rear arm a front end of which is axially supported by the vehicle body frame and a rear end of which supports a rear wheel; a pair of left and right rear cushions for supporting the rear arms by the vehicle body frame; a taillight having a brake light portion and a winker light portion and arranged on a rear side of a vehicle body; and a tail cover for covering at least an end portion in a vehicle<br>
2<br><br>
width direction of the taillight and covering upper ends of the pair of rear cushions attached to outer sides of the vehicle body frame; wherein a dimension in the vehicle width direction of the taillight is larger than a minimum interval in the vehicle width direction of the pair of rear cushions and smaller than a maximum dimension in the vehicle width direction of the fuel tank.<br>
The 'taillight' mentioned here signifies a so-called combination light combined with a brake light portion and a winker light portion.<br>
The 'minimum interval in the vehicle width direction of the pair of rear cushions' signifies an interval between a point at which one of the rear cushions is mostly proximate to other of the rear cushions and a point at which other of the rear cushions is mostly proximate to one of the rear cushions. That is, the 'minimum interval in the vehicle width direction of the pair of rear cushions' signifies an interval between an inner side edge of one of the rear cushions and an inner side edge of other of the rear cushions.<br>
The ^maximum dimension in the vehicle width direction of the fuel tank' signifies a width of the fuel tank at a portion of the fuel tank at which a width of the fuel tank is the largest.<br>
Further, when a member having a shape along an outer shape of the fuel tank is fixed to the fuel tank, a maximum dimension in the vehicle width direction of a fuel tank assembly including<br>
3<br><br>
the member is regarded as the 'maximum dimension in the vehicle width direction of the fuel tank' . As an example of the ^member having the shape along the outer shape of the fuel tank' , there is pointed out an air guide fixed to the fuel tank such that a surface thereof is substantially flush with a surface of the fuel tank for covering a portion of the fuel tank. However, the member having the shape along the outer shape of the fuel tank' is not limited to a member having a shape of the air guide.<br>
According to the motorcycle, visual recognizability of the taillight can be promoted while excellently maintaining ridability of a rider. That is, the width of the taillight is enlarged within a range of not projecting the taillight from the fuel tank in the vehicle width direction and therefore, the visual recognizability of the taillight can be promoted without deteriorating the ridability of the rider. In this way, a driver of a trailing automobile or a rider of a trailing motorcycle can easily visually recognize the taillight.<br>
Normally, a fuel tank is set with a width in accordance with a characteristic of a vehicle.  That is, there is a motorcycle in which a. width of a fuel tank is made to be comparatively narrow such that a rider is easy to deal therewith, or a motorcycle in which a width of a fuel tank is made to be comparatively wide such that a rider is made to be easy to deal therewith in accordance with a main use thereof. According to the motorcycle of the invention, the taillight is not<br>
4<br><br>
projected in the vehicle width direction than the fuel tank and therefore, a rider is made to be easy to deal with the motorcycle.<br>
The rider rides on a seat of a motorcycle and operates the motorcycle in an attitude of squeezing a fuel tank by the knees. In the case in which when a rider moves up the one foot to ride on a seat of a motorcycle, a taillight is projected in a vehicle width direction than a fuel tank, the feet of the rider are made to be easy to impinge on tail covers for covering left and right end portions of the taillight.<br>
According to the motorcycle of the invention, the taillight is not projected in the vehicle width direction than the fuel tank and therefore, the rider is made to be easy to ride on the seat.<br>
Further, in the case in which the rider places the one foot on the ground and moves up the other foot rearwardly in order to ride off from the seat, when the taillight is projected in the vehicle width direction than the fuel tank, the other foot is easy to impinge on the tail covers covering the left and right end portions of the taillight.<br>
According to the motorcycle of the invention, the taillight is not projected in the vehicle width direction than the fuel tank and therefore, the rider is made to be easy to ride off from the seat.<br>
Further, according to the motorcycle of the invention,<br>
5<br><br>
an aerodynamic performance of the motorcycle is excellent. When the taillight is projected in the vehicle width direction than the fuel tank, an aerodynamic resistance is increased and the aerodynamic performance of the motorcycle is deteriorated. According to the motorcycle of the invention, the taillight is not projected in the vehicle width direction than the fuel tank, the tail covers covering the end portions in the vehicle width direction of the taillight also cover the upper ends of the pair of rear cushions and therefore, air is made to flow smoothly from a side face to a rear portion of the motorcycle.<br>
Further, according to the motorcycle of the invention, the tail covers are provided with a function of covering the taillight and a function of covering the upper ends of the rear cushions and therefore, a number of parts of a cover member can be reduced.<br>

According to the above-described constitution, the taillight is extended to a side face of the motorcycle while<br>
6<br><br>
being curved and therefore, the brake light portion and the winker light portion of the taillight are made to be easy to recognize visually even from a skewed rear direction or a side direction of the motorcycle. Therefore, visually recognizing performance of the taillight is further improved.<br>
According to a third aspect of the invention, a rear face of the taillight is constituted by a concave curved face in a side view.<br>
According to the above-described constitution, other of the winker light portions of the motorcycle is made to be easy to recognize visually from one skewed rear direction of the motorcycle. Therefore, the visually recognizing performance of the taillight is further improved.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the invention, the taillight is constituted by a curved shape convex in a rear direction in a plane view in which a brake light portion is arranged between a pair of the winker light portions and the brake light portion is projected rearward from the winker light portion, the seat comprises a main seat and a passenger seat arranged rearward from the main seat, and a rear end portion of the passenger seat is disposed rearward from the end portion in the vehicle width direction of the taillight.<br>
According to the above-described constitution, the passenger seat is extended rearward from the end portion in the vehicle width direction of the taillight, the passenger<br>
7<br><br>
seat is enlarged and seating comfort of the passenger seat is excellent.  By enlarging the dimension in the vehicle width direction of the taillight, such a large passenger seat is made to be able to provide. According to the above-described constitution, the visually recognizing performance of the taillight can be promoted while excellently maintaining the ridability of the rider, further, the seating comfort of the passenger seat can be promoted.<br>
According to a fifth aspect of the invention, a dimension in the vehicle width direction of the rear end portion of the passenger seat is larger than the minimum interval in the vehicle width direction of the pair of rear cushions and smaller than the maximum direction in the vehicle width direction of the fuel tank.<br>
According to the above-described constitution, the width of the rear end portion of the passenger seat is widened and therefore, the seating comfort of the passenger seat is excellent.<br>
According to a sixth aspect of the invention, an axis line of the rear cushion is directed to the main seat on which a rider is seated in a side view.<br>
According to the above-described constitution, the tail cover smoothly covers a wide range of asidefaceof the motorcycle from the upper end of the rear cushion directed to the main seat to the taillight and therefore, the aerodynamicperf ormance<br>
8<br><br>
of the motorcycle is excellent.<br>

By attaching the upper end portion 25a to the outer side of the seat rail 6, a space of arranging the sprocket 90, the chain 91 and the like constituting the rear wheel driving means can easily be ensured.<br>
According to the taillight 37 of the embodiment, a maximum dimension LI in the vehicle width direction is larger than an interval L10 between inner edges of the pair of left and right rear cushions 25 and is larger than an interval L2 between outer edges of the pair of left and right rear cushions 25. A brake light portion 37b and a winker light portion 37a of the taillight 37 are partitioned by a partition line Yl. In a rear view, the partition line Yl is connected to an extension Zl of a lower edge of the seat 21.<br>
The taillight 37 is constituted by a curved shape convex to a rear side in a plane view in which the brake light portion 37b is arranged between a pair of the winker light portions<br>
15<br><br>
37a and the brake light portion 37b is projected rearward from the winker light portion 37a. The winker light portion 37a and the break light portion 37b are provided with continuous illuminating faces. Further, at a boundary between the tail cover 35 and the taillight 37, a surface of the tail cover 35 is substantially flush with the illuminating face of the winker light portion 37a.<br>
Further, in a side view, a rear face of the taillight 37 is constituted by a concave curved face 37c. Therefore, illuminating light can be reduced from being leaked to an upper side and light can be illuminated excellently. Further, it is easy to visually recognize the winker light portion 37a on other side from one skewed rear direction of the motorcycle 1.<br>
The taillight 37 can illuminate light excellently and is easy to be recognized visually from a trailing automobile or motorcycle since the maximum dimension L1 in the vehicle width direction is larger than the interval L2 between the outer edges of the pair of left and right rear cushions 25 and the taillight 37 is constituted by the above-described shape.<br>
The pair of left and right tail covers 35 are connected by the connection cover 36 at rear ends thereof to surround a rear lower side of the seat 21. As shown in Fig. 16, the tail cover 35 includes a cover portion 35a projected to outer side while being bent to be convex to the outer side between the<br>
16<br><br>
rear cushion 25 and a rear edge of the tail cover 37. By the cover portion 35a, a volume feeling and an appearance quality of the vehicle body are promoted.<br>
The tail covers 35 cover a surrounding of the taillight 37 and cover upper ends of the rear cushions 25 and therefore, a number of parts of the cover member can be reduced, attachment operability is promoted and excellent appearance is achieved.<br>
Further, the cover portion 35a of the tail cover 35 includes a rear end notch 35b for exposing the winker portion of the taillight 37 to a side face of the motorcycle. The rear edge notch 35b is extended frontward from a rear end portion of the seat. The tail cover 35 is formed by a resin material and an outer surface thereof is coated.<br>
As shown in Fig.17, the tail cover 35 includes an inward projected piece 35f and the inward projected piece 35f is proj ected from a vehicle body inner side edge of the rear cushion 35 to an inner side of the vehicle body. In this way, the inner side of the vehicle body is made to be unable to be seen from outside by closing a gap between the tail cover 35 and the rear cushion 25 to achieve excellent appearance.<br>
A lower face of the tail cover 35 is projected from the rear fender 38 to the inner side of the vehicle body frontward from a portion thereof being intersected with a lower edge of the rear fender 38 arranged on the upper side of the rear wheel 24 in a side view to thereby enable the inner side of the vehicle<br>
17<br><br>
body not to be seen from outside to achieve excellent appearance .<br>
As shown in Fig.10, Fig.11, Fig.12 and Fig.13, the rear fender 38 is attached to the seat rail 6 by a front side attaching portion 38a and a rear side attaching portion 38b and a fixing maximum width portion 38c (vicinity of the rear side attaching portion 38b constituting a portion of being attached to the side of the vehicle body at an upper portion thereof) becomes larger than the interval L10 between the inner edges of the rear cushions as shown in Fig. 8 . Therefore, a mudguard effect of the rear fender 38 is considerable and a volume feeling is produced at the vehicle. The rear fender 38 is constituted by a color of a base material without coating.<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 11, an upper end portion of the rear cushion 25 is attached to an attaching portion 6a projected from the seat rail 6 to an outer side.<br>
As shown in Fig.2, according to the motorcycle 1 of the embodiment, the seat 21 is provided with the main seat 21a and the passenger seat 21b. Notation 21c designates a boundary therebetween. A rear end portion of the passenger seat 21b is disposed rearward from an end portion in the vehicle width direction of the taillight 37. Further, a dimension L15 in the vehicle width direction of the rear end portion of the passenger seat 21b is larger than the interval L10 between the inner edges of the pair of rear cushions 25. By enlarging the maximum dimension Ll in the vehicle width direction of the<br>
18<br><br>
taillight 37 within a range of not exceeding a maximum dimension L20 in the vehicle width direction of the fuel tank 20, such a large passenger seat 21b is made to be able to provide. According to the passenger seat 21b, seating comfort is excellent and a stabilized feeling is produced even when seated sidesaddle .<br>
Further, according to the embodiment, both left and right sides of the fuel tank 20 are provided with air guides 20a projected from the fuel tank 20 in the vehicle width direction. Therefore, a maximum dimension in the vehicle width direction of the air guide 20a constitutes the maximum dimension L20 in the vehicle width direction of the fuel tank. The air guides 20a are fixed to the fuel tank 20 to cover left and right side portions of a front portion of the fuel tank 20 such that surfaces thereof are substantially flush with surfaces of the fuel tank 20 at boundaries of the fuel tank 20. As shown in Fig.l, the air guide 20a is disposed on an upper side of the engine 26 and when running the motorcycle, a portion of air impinging on the air guide 20a is guided by the air guide 20a to flow toward the engine 26. The air guide 20a is molded by resin and is fixed to the fuel tank 20 by a bolt.<br>
When the pair of rear cushions 25 are provided on both sides in the vehicle width direction as in the motorcycle 1, a diameter of each of the rear cushions 25 can be made to be slenderer than that when only a single piece of the rear cushion 25 is provided to the motorcycle.  Therefore, even when upper<br>
19<br><br>
ends of the pair of rear cushions 25 are fixed to outer sides of the seat frame 6, the rear cushion 25 is not so much projected in the vehicle width direction. Further, the embodiment is provided with the taillight 37 having the dimension L1 in the vehicle width direction wider than the interval L10 of the pair of rear cushions 25 and narrower than the width L20 of the fuel tank 20 and is provided with the pair of tail covers 34, 35 covering end portions in the vehicle width direction of the taillight 37 and covering upper ends of the pair of rear cushions 25. Therefore, as shown in Fig.2, the motorcycle 1 is constituted by a smooth stream line shape in a plane view to achieve an excellent aerodynamic performance of the motorcycle 1.<br>
