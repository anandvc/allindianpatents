				<td>The invention relates to a sterile ophthalmic gel preparation<br>
that can be applied in drop form, especially for use as an<br>
artificial tear fluid and for the treatment of "dry eye", as<br>
well as to a method for the production of such a gel<br>
preparation.<br>
It has been known for some time to use aqueous preparations to<br>
replace natural tear fluid and to treat "dry eye", which aqueous<br>
preparations e. g. contain film-building materials based on<br>
polyvinylalcohol (PVOH), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), cellulose<br>
derivatives or dextrane. An overview can e. g. be found in<br>
Sucker, Fuchs und Speiser, "Pharmazeutische Technologie" 1978.<br>
These are generally systems which only have one fluid or liquid<br>
phase, typically an aqueous solution of further components.<br>
WM/em<br>
Where components are present which are difficult to dissolve in<br>
water or which are water-insoluble, these are suspended as<br>
solids, in finally divided form, in the aqueous phase.<br>
In semisynthetic preparations, such as e. g. those based on<br>
cellulose derivatives or dextrane, production is made more<br>
difficult by the fact that such materials are difficult to<br>
obtain free of insoluble components. One therefore has to incur<br>
very high expenditure in preparing solutions from such<br>
preparations which do not lead to eye irritation caused by<br>
mechanical effects. Further, such preparations are very<br>
difficult to sterilize, since they can only with great<br>
difficulty, or not at all, be filtered to remove germs, and they<br>
can also not be autoclaved without deteriation in quality.<br>
Cellulose derivatives cannot be autoclaved without irreversible<br>
changes in viscosity. Dextrane preparations are partly<br>
decomposed by autoclaving.<br>
Also polyvinylalcohol can only be sterilized by heating if a<br>
very pure hydrolized form is employed since otherwise the PVOH<br>
component is depolymerized. Since PVOH as well as PVP only<br>
provide relatively little thickening effect, rather high amounts<br>
of these components must be used to provide suitable<br>
viscosities. This leads to a very high load of the<br>
ophthalmological preparation with such materials, e. g. contents<br>
of more than 10% in the case of PVOH.<br>
It is already known from DE 34 40 352 and DE 43 03 818} and also<br>
from US 5,252,318, to use polyacrylic acid and its derivatives,<br>
such as e. g. Carbopol® 940 (obtainable from B. F. Goodrich<br>
Company) as the gel basis for sterile ophthalmic gel drop<br>
preparations. In US 5,441,732, which was only published after<br>
the priority date of the instant application, a combination of<br>
two specific gel components is disclosed, one of which is gelled<br>
thermally, whereas the other is gelled by a change in pH.<br>
Various cellulose derivatives are described as the thermally<br>
reactive gel polymer, whereas polyacrylates, especially cross-<br>
linked polyacrylates, are mentioned as polymers gelling in<br>
dependance of the pH value. It appears that gel formation is<br>
intended to only occur in the eye, by the pH change after<br>
application to the eye. It is stated that these polymer mixtures<br>
are to be used together with organic oils, wherein a<br>
multiplicity of active agents can be dissolved. Vitamine A is<br>
not mentioned.<br>
With respect to compliance, non-irritation, shelf life etc.,<br>
very high standards must be met by ophthalmic preparations which<br>
are to be used as film-forming preparations or lubricating<br>
preparations. Especially where ophthalmic preparations must be<br>
used for any extended period of time, which e. g. is regularly<br>
the case in the treatment of "dry eye", even a temporary<br>
irritation, such as a burning sensation in the eye is an<br>
extremely unpleasant sensation, and is detrimental to any<br>
extended therapeutical treatment. It is self-understood that in<br>
the application of such ophthalmic preparations, impaired sight,<br>
blurred view or other acute irritations cannot be accepted.<br>
In "dry eye" treatment, the use of vitamine A, generally in the<br>
form of vitamine A palmitate, has proven to be effective. Thus,<br>
gel drop preparations on Carbopol basis have bein commercialized<br>
(after the priority date of the instant application), which<br>
besides other customary components contain vitamine A palmitate.<br>
These are one-phase gels with a continuous aqueous liquid phase,<br>
and without any hydrophobic second liquid phase. These products<br>
have a shelf life of about a year, when the vitamine A component<br>
is provided in an excess of 40%. As trials have shown, the<br>
vitamine A content decreases by about 20% over six months in<br>
these preparations, so that at a 40% excess dosage, the<br>
guaranteed minimum content is still present after one year.<br>
Natural tear fluid comprises inter alia a fatty component which<br>
comprises triglycerides and phospholipides. It has already been<br>
tried (WO 94/05298), to use triglycerides in synthetic tear<br>
liquids, which was, however, only possible when an emulgator was<br>
added, and the overall preparation was in the form of an<br>
emulsion, for topical application to the eye. This has the<br>
disadvantage that desirable residual amounts of natural tear<br>
 fluid in the eye are destroyed by the emulgator component.<br>
It is an important object of this invention to provide<br>
ophthalmic preparations, especially gel preparations, which show<br>
an improved shelf life, especially when containing sensitive<br>
substances such as vitamine A and its derivatives.<br>
It is a further important object of the invention to provide<br>
such preparations which do not cause acute irritations and<br>
impaired vision, especially when formulated for increased shelf<br>
life.<br>
It is a further very important object of this invention to<br>
provide such preparations which make it possible to use the<br>
preparation repeatedly over an extended time period, and/or<br>
enable extended duration in the eye after each individual<br>
application without causing incompatibilities, lack of<br>
compliance, irritation to the eye and other such problems.<br>
The invention relates to a method for producing a sterile opthalmic drop<br>
preparartion especially a corresponding gel preparation as hereindescribed characterised<br>
in that a hydrophobic phase, especially a medium chain triglyceride component is<br>
homogenously dispersed in a continuous aqueoes phase resulting of the said opthalmic<br>
preparation having increased storage stability without the addition of emulgator<br>
substance.<br>
The invention is based on various surprising findings.<br>
On the one hand, it has surprisingly been found that relatively<br>
fast decomposition of vitamine A and its derivatives, especially<br>
vitamine A palmitate, in artificial tear fluids and preparations<br>
for "dry eye" treatment can be dramatically reduced when the<br>
preparation is in the form of a two component system with one<br>
aqueous liquid phase and one hydrophobic liquid phase.<br>
Especially it is preferred herein that the preparation has a<br>
continuous aqueous phase wherein the hydrophobic liquid oil<br>
phase is provided in the form of very finely divided droplets.<br>
There is no easy explanation for this fact. Most probably,<br>
oxygen and/or light are responsible for the decomposition of<br>
vitamine A, and with respect to both, it should not make any<br>
material difference whether the preparation comprises one or two<br>
separate liquid phases. One would rather expect an increased<br>
sensitivity with respect to oxygen and/or light in a solution of<br>
the vitamine A component in the hydrophobic phase.<br>
Possibly, the simultaneous use of antioxidants, especially<br>
vitamine E and its derivatives and most specifically vitamine E<br>
acetate has an influence in these preparations. In any case,<br>
vitamine A is preferably used with such antioxidants in the<br>
inventive preparations.<br>
On the other hand, a further surprising effect of the invention<br>
is that it makes it possible to prepare preparations with an<br>
aqueous and a liquid hydrophobic phase which come very close to<br>
the composition of natural tear liquid, and especially have a<br>
corresponding content of triglycerides, without any necessity of<br>
at the same time using emulgators. This is possible since<br>
according to the invention, such preparations are in the form of<br>
gel drop preparations. In contrast to preparations without any<br>
gel basis, triglycerides can be provided in the inventive gel<br>
preparations in the form of very finely divided droplets also<br>
over very extended storage periods, with the droplets being<br>
sufficiently stable in the gel even in the absence of any<br>
emulgator. It is possible without any problems to prepare such<br>
preparations so that they are sterile, and the preparations are<br>
not irritating and perfectly acceptable.<br>
The inventive preparations, including gel preparations, have a<br>
refractive index which is almost completely the same as that of<br>
natural tear fluid. They provide extended duration and effect in<br>
the eye.<br>
The inventive preparations appear to provide reduced surface i<br>
tension of the aqueous eye gel, which leads to improved<br>
distribution on the cornea. Also, any active agent suspended or<br>
dissolved in the oil phase is more evenly distributed,<br>
wetability of objects to be placed on the cornea, such as<br>
contact lenses or the front lenses of ophthalmological<br>
apparatuses, is improved.<br>
Long term studies show that the inventive preparations are<br>
extremely stable in the 5 g polyfoil tube packages customary in<br>
trade, not only under the conditions of a temperate climate<br>
(29°C, 45% relative humidity), but also under conditions of the<br>
mediterranian/subtropical climate (26°C, 60% relative humidity)<br>
and even that of very hard and moist climates (31°C, 70%<br>
relative humidity) and show hardly any changes in vitamine A<br>
content (where provided), pH value, osmolality, viscosity and<br>
appearance.<br>
Basically, those ophthalmologically acceptable organic oils are<br>
suitable as the liquid hydrophobic component of the inventive<br>
two-phase preparations, especially gels, which can be dispersed<br>
as droplets in an aqueous phase in the absence of emulgators.<br>
Examples are formed by fatty acid derivatives such as,<br>
especially, fatty acid esters, triglycerides and phthalic acid<br>
esters. Triglycerides are presently specifically preferred,<br>
especially the homogeneous or mixed triglycerides formed mostly<br>
or totally from C3-C12 fatty acids. Especially, medium chain<br>
triglycerides of the type defined in "Deutsches Arzneibuch"<br>
(DAB) 10 (1993) are preferred. The acid component of these<br>
triglycerides is a mixture of-at least 95% n-octanoic acid and<br>
n-decanoic acid; the remainder is formed by shorter chain fatty<br>
acids.<br>
Such medium chain triglycerides are made semi-synthetically from<br>
the oil of the dry solid part of the endosperm of cocos<br>
nucifera L., by hydrolizing the coco oil obtained from the<br>
endosperm, fractioning the thus obtained fatty acids, and re-<br>
esterification of the acids.<br>
Such medium chain triglycerides are already in use as basic<br>
•substances for cosmetics, as adjuvants and carriers for<br>
-'l pharmaceuticals, and also for some foodstuffs. Very little is<br>
- known, however, about their potential uses and the limits of<br>
such uses in ophthalmic preparations, although such medium chain<br>
triglycerides have very well known beneficial properties.<br>
Inventive preparations, especially on gel basis, with typical<br>
contents between 0.1 and 3 weight-%, especially approximately<br>
0.2 weight-% polyacrylic acid as the gel-forming agent in the<br>
aqueous phase, contain typically between 0.5 and 10 weight-%,<br>
especially approximately 1 weight-% of such medium chain<br>
triglycerides.<br>
Inventive gel preparations preferably have a viscosity in the<br>
range of approximately 2000 to 6000 mPas, at a pH value between<br>
6 and 8.<br>
The inventive preparations preferably contain a preserving<br>
agent, such as especially centrimid, benzalkoniumchloride or<br>
thiomersal. It is further preferred that such gel preparations<br>
contain at least one isotonic agent, for which purpose sorbitol<br>
is specifically suitable.<br>
The especially preferred content of a vitamine A component,<br>
especially vitamine A palmitate, is of the order of 500<br>
international units per gram of the inventive preparation. The<br>
vitamine A component is specifically preferred to be stabilized<br>
with a small amount of at least one antioxidant, wherein<br>
vitamine E and vitamine E acetate are specifically advantageous.<br>
Production of an inventive sterile preparation, especially gel,<br>
proceeds in a multistep method. In preparing the gel, a sterile<br>
polyacrylic acid suspension is preferably obtained by the<br>
procedure disclosed in DE 43 03 818;,. i. e. by autoclaving at<br>
about 120°C, 1 bar excess pressure, and 20 minutes duration. In<br>
parallel, an aqueous solution is prepared which contains the<br>
preserving agent and the isotonic, i. e. preferably centrimid<br>
and sorbitoli This aqueous solution is added to the autoclaved<br>
polyacrylic acid suspension by sterile filtration, using<br>
nitrogen as the pressurizing gas, or, in case, more simply using<br>
pressurized air. Subsequently, careful neutralization is<br>
achieved by adding sterile sodiumhydroxide solution, which<br>
initiates gel formation. Once neutralization has been achieved,<br>
there is no free base any more in the forming gel. The<br>
hydrophobic liquid component, i. e. preferably the medium chain<br>
triglyceride component, is then worked into the sterile gel<br>
under antiseptic conditions. Stirring is maintained until<br>
complete homogenization has been achieved. In the inventive<br>
dispersion, the size of the thus obtained oil droplets is<br>
maximally about 100 µm and is otherwise of the kind, which is<br>
obtained in a conventional emulsion without the addition of<br>
strong emulgators.<br>
The sterile gel can now be confectioned in the customary<br>
fashion.<br>
Otherwise, an active agent such as especially vitannine A<br>
paImitate can be added to the thus formed sterile gel, in such a<br>
fashion that the vitamine A component and the much smaller<br>
amount of antioxidant, which is preferably also present, are<br>
dissolved in neutral oil, followed by sterile filtration. The<br>
sterile oil solution is then worked into the gel with stirring.<br>
A comparable procedure is used when a preparation without gel<br>
basis, e. g. a drop solution is to be prepared.<br>
The gel forming agents used according to this invention are<br>
preferably polyacrylic acids with a molecular weight of the<br>
order of approximately 3 to 5 million. Specifically preferred<br>
are the trade products such as Carbopol® polymeric acids as<br>
obtainable from B. F. Goodrich Chemicals Co. Carbopol 980 NF® is<br>
especially preferred. In the preparation, the concentration is<br>
approximately 0.2 weight-%.<br>
The neutralization necessary for gel formation is customarily<br>
carried out using sterile diluted sodiumhydroxide solution,<br>
whereby 1-N sodiumhydroxide solution is specifically<br>
advantageous. However, also other inorganic bases or alkali<br>
carbonates, or organic bases such as amines, especially<br>
triethylamine and diisopropylamine can be used.<br>
The gels thus obtained have viscosities in the range of<br>
approximately 2000 to 6000 mPas at 20°C.<br>
The preserving agent which is generally used according to this<br>
invention, such as centrimid, benzalkoniumchloride or<br>
thiomersal, is used in the customary concentration, i. e.<br>
approximately 0.01 weight-% in the case of centrimid. The<br>
isotoning agent, e. g. polyfunctional alcohols such as mannitol,<br>
dextrose, glycerol, propylene glycol or, especially preferred,<br>
sorbitol, are also used in customary concentrations. For<br>
sorbitol, a concentration of approximately 4.85 weight-% is<br>
specifically advantageous.<br>
The invention will now be further explained on the basis of two<br>
examples:<br>
A homogeneous suspension of 2 000 kg polyacrylic acid (Carbopol<br>
980 NF®) in approximately 375 kg water (pro injectionem) is<br>
introduced, through, a fibre removal filter with a pore size of<br>
approximately 25 to 40 µm into a processing apparatus. This<br>
suspension is then autoclaved under stirring at 121°C and 1 bar<br>
excess pressure for 20 minutes, and is then cooled to room<br>
temperature whereby ambient pressure is provided using a<br>
sterilized air filter.<br>
Meanwhile, approximately 964 kg water (pro injectionem) are<br>
provided in a suitable vessel, and under stirring, 0.100 kg<br>
centrimid and then 48.510 kg sorbitol are dissolved therein.<br>
This solution is added to the already autoclaved pdlyacrylic<br>
acid suspension using a vapour sterilized membrane filter with a<br>
pore size of 0.2 /on, and nitrogen as the pressurizing gas.<br>
Subsequently, the apparatus is evacuated once or more to destroy<br>
any foam that may have formed.<br>
Now, 0.832 kg sodiumhydroxide axe dissolved in approximately 20<br>
kg water (pro injectionem) under stirring and sterile<br>
conditions. The sodiumhydroxide is added by filtration through a<br>
vapour sterilized membrane filter to the centrimid/sorbitol/<br>
polyacrylic acid suspension, whereupon the remaining amount of<br>
water (pro injectionem) is added. The gel thus formed is worked<br>
by a homogenizer.<br>
Then, the medium chain triglycerides are worked into the sterile<br>
gel, being added through a sterile filter with a pore size of<br>
0.2 µm, followed by stirring until complete homogenization has<br>
-been achieved. The pH value of the thus formed gel is<br>
determined, which should be 6 to 8 at 20°C. The osmolality of<br>
the inventive preparation is in the range of 260 to 320 mOsm/kg.<br>
The gel formed in this fashion is then filled into 5 g polyfoil<br>
tubes under aseptic conditions.<br>
Example 2<br>
0.6 g vitamine A palmitate and 0.03 g vitamine E acetate are<br>
dissolved in 9.37 g neutral oil (Myritol 318®).<br>
The solution is filtered through a 0.22 /µm filter (Millipore®)<br>
so that it is sterile.<br>
10 g of the neutral oil solution are added to 990 g gel prepared<br>
according to Example 1, and are worked into the gel using a wing<br>
stirrer. After 20 minutes of stirring the ready product is<br>
filled into 10 g polyfoil tubes. The gel corresponds to a<br>
content of 500 international units vitamine A per gramm<br>
preparation, at a 20% access.<br>
Comparative Example<br>
A Carbopol gel is made according to Example 1; however, the<br>
medium chain triglyceride component is not provided.<br>
Comparative Test<br>
As according to Example 2, the gel of the Comparative Example is<br>
provided with a corresponding content of vitamine A palmitate.<br>
Samples of this vitamine A preparation without triglyceride<br>
component are stored together with corresponding samples<br>
according to Example 2, under standard conditions. After a total<br>
of six months storage time, the vitamine A content in the<br>
comparative samples without triglyceride component has fallen by<br>
a total of 20%. In the samples according to Example 2, the<br>
vitamine A content is found to be unchanged within the accuracy<br>
of determination.<br>
