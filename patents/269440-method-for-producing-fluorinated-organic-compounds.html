				<td>METHOD FOR PRODUCING FLUORINATED ORGANIC COMPOUNDS<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
(1)	Field of Invention:<br>
This invention relates to novel methods for preparing fluorinated organic compounds.<br>
(2)	Description of Related Art<br>
Hydrofiuorocarbons (HFC's), in particular hydrofluoroalkenes such tetrafluoropropenes (including 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-l-propene (HFO-1234yf) and 1,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-l-propene (HFO-1234ze)) have been disclosed to be effective refrigerants, fire extinguishants, heat transfer media, propellants, foaming agents, blowing agents, gaseous dielectrics, sterilant carriers, polymerization media, particulate removal fluids, carrier fluids, buffing abrasive agents, displacement drying agents and power cycle working fluids. Unlike chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), both of which potentially damage the Earth's ozone layer, HFCs do not contain chlorine and thus pose no threat to the ozone layer.<br>
Several methods of preparing hydrofiuoroalkenes are known. For example, U.S. Pat No. 4,900,874 (Ihara et al) describes a method of making fluorine containing olefins by contacting hydrogen gas with fluorinated alcohols. Although mis appears to be a relatively high-yield process, for commercial scale production the handling of hydrogen gas at high temperature raises difficult safety related questions. Also, the cost of producing hydrogen gas, such as building an on-site hydrogen plant, can be in many situations prohibitive.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 2,931,840 (Marquis) describes a method of making fluorine containing olefins by pyrolysis of methyl chloride and tetrafraoroethylene or chlorodifluoromethane. This process is a relatively low yield process and a very large percentage of the organic starting material is converted in this process to unwanted and/or unimportant byproducts.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 2,996,555 (Rausch) describes a method for the vapor phase manufacture of fluorine containing olefins by a single step process in which an oxygen-containing metal catalyst, such as chromium oxyfluoride, is used to convert a compound of formula CX3CF2CH3 to 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropenen. This examples in this patent describe a process which produces a relatively low yield, that is, 60%.<br>
The preparation of HFO-1234yf from trifluoroacetylacetone and sulfur tetrafluoride has been described. See Banks, et al., Journal of Fluorine Chemistry, Vol. 82, Iss. 2, p. 171-174 (1997). Also, U.S. Pat. No. 5,162,594 (Krespan) discloses a process wherein tetrafluoroethylene is reacted with another fluorinated ethylene in the liquid phase to produce a polyfluoroolefin product.<br>

Additional features of the present invention are provided in the following examples, which should not be construed as limiting the claims in any way.<br>
EXAMPLES 1A<br>
Liquid-phase   catalytic   fluorination   of  CCl3CF2CH3   (242bb)   with   HF   to<br>
CF3CF2CH3 (R24Scb)<br>
Example 1A<br>
About 327 grams HF, about 50 grams CCl3CF2CH3(242bb), and about 75<br>
grams SbCls were charged into a 1-L autoclave. The reaction mixture was stirred at 120°C for about 6 hours under about 760 psig of pressure. After the stipulated reaction time, the reactor was cooled up to about 0°C, and about 300 ml water was then added slowly into the autoclave over a period of about 45 minutes. After complete addition of water under stirring, the reactor was heated to about 70°C and then the overhead gases were transferred to anomer collecting cylinder. The yield of CF3CF2CH3 was about 82% at a 242bb conversion level of about 100%. The other major by-products were traces of CF3CFClCH3 and tarry material.<br>
Example 1B<br>
About 327 grams of HF, about 50 graqms of CCl3CF2CH3(242bb), and about<br>
75 grams of SbCls were charged into a 1-L autoclave. The reaction mixture was stirred at about I00°C for about 6 hours under about 620 psig of pressure. After the reaction, the reactor was cooled to about 0°C, and about 300 ml water was then added slowly into the autoclave over a period of about 45 minutes. After complete addition of water under stirring, the reactor temperature was raised to 70°C and then the overhead gases were transferred to another collecting cylinder. The yield of CF3CF2CH3 was about 78% at a 242bb conversion level of about 86%. The other major by-products were traces of CF3CFClCH3 and and other clorofluoropropanes.<br>
Example 1C<br>
About 327 grams HF, about 50 grams 1233xf, and about 75 grams SbCls were charged into a 1-L autoclave. The reaction mixture was stirred at about 80°C for about 6 hours under about 460 psig of pressure. After the reaction, the reactor was cooled to 0°C and 300 ml water was then added slowly into the autoclave over a period of about 45 minutes. After complete addition of water under stirring, the reactor was cooled to<br>
room temperature and then the overhead gases were transferred to another collecting cylinder. The yield of CF3CF2CH3 was about 67%. The only other major by-products includes products resulted from incomplete fluorination and trace of CF3CFClCH3.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Gas-phase catalytic fluorination of CCI3CF2CH3 (242bb) with HF to CF3CF2CH3<br>
(R245cb)<br>
A 22-inch (1/2-inch diameter) Monel ptipe gas phase reactor was charged with<br>
120 cc of 50wt% SbCls/C as the catalyst. The reactor was mounted inside a heater with three zones (top, middle and bottom). The reactor temperature was read by custom made 5-point thermocouples kept at the middle inside of the reactor. The inlet of the reactor was connected to a pre-heater, which was kept at about 300°C by electrical heating. The Hquid-HF was fed from a cylinder into the pre-heater through a needle valve, liquid mass-flow meter, and a research control valve at a substantially constant flow of from about 1 to about 1000 grams per hour (g/h). The HF cylinder was kept at a constant pressure of 45 psig by applying anhydrous N2 gas pressure into the cylinder head space. A feed consisting of organic reactant (242bb) was fed at a rate ranging from about 10 to about 120 g/h as a gas from a cylinder kept at about 145°C through a regulator, needle valve, and a gas mass-flow-meter. The organic feed stream was also fed periodically as liquid at about 105°C from a cylinder into the pre-heater through a needle valve, liquid mass-flow meter, and a research control valve at a substantially constant flow rate ranging from about 10 to about 150 g/h. The organic line from the cylinder to the pre-heater was kept at about 265 °C by wrapping with constant temperature heat trace and electrical heating. All feed cylinders were mounted on scales to monitor their weight by difference. The reactions were run at a substantially constant reactor pressure of from about 0 to about 100 psig by controlling the flow of reactor exit gases by another research control valve. The exit gases coming out of the reactor were analyzed by on-line GC and GC/MS connected through a hotbox valve arrangements to prevent condensation. The reactor temperature was kept at from about 60°C to about 120°C. The SbCl5/C catalyst was pretreated with about 50 g/h HF at about the reaction temperature for about 8 hours under about 50 psig pressures. After HF pretreatment, the catalyst was further treated with about 20 seem of Cl2 and about 50 g/h of HF for an additional 4 hours. The pretreated catalyst was men contacted with<br>
organic in the presence of about 50 g/h HF. The conversion of 242bb was in the range of from about 60 to about 70% and the selectivity to 245cb was about 85% when the reaction was performed using 50 wt% SbCls/C as the catalyst at about 120°C under about 30 psig pressure in the presence of about 50 g/h HF and about 20 g/h of 242bb-The product was collected by flowing the reactor exit gases through a solution of from about 20wt% to about 60 wt% aqueous K.OH scrubber solution and then trapping the exit gases from the scrubber into a cylinder kept in dry ice or liquid N2. The products were then isolated by distillation. The following catalysts were tested and found to have the selecetivity to HFC-245 as indicated in parenthesis: 30 wt% SbCVC (Sel. 81%); from about 3 to about 6 wt% FeCl3/C (Sel. 52%); SbF5/C (Sel. 87%); 20 wt% SnCl4/C (Sel. 32%); 23 wt% TiCl4/C (Sel. 27%). The catalyst temperatures o used ranged from about 60°C to about 120°C. SbCl5/C is believed to be a preferred catalyst for this gas-phase transformation.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Catalytic conversion of CF3CF2CH3 to CF3CF=CH2<br>
A 22-inch (1/2-inch diameter) Monel tube reactor was charged with about 120 cc of a catalyst. The reactor was mounted inside a heater with three zones (top, middle and bottom). The reactor temperature was read by custom made 5-point thermocouples kept at the middle inside of the reactor. The inlet of the reactor was connected to a pre-heateT, which was kept at about 300°C by electrical heating. HFC-245cb was fed from a cylinder kept at about 65°C through a regulator, needle valve, and a gas mass-flow-meter. The line to the pre-heater was heat traced and kept at a substantially constant temperature of from about 65°C to about 70°C by electrical heating to avoid condensation. The feed cylinder was mounted on scales to monitor their weight by difference. The reactions were run at a substantially constant reactor pressure in the range of from about 0 to about 100 psig by controlling the flow of reactor exit gases by another research control valve. The gas mixture exiting the reactor was analyzed by on¬line GC and GC/MS connected through a hotbox valve arrangements to prevent condensation. The conversion of 245cb was in the range of from about 30% to about 70% and the selectivity to HFO-1234yf was in the range of from about 90% to about<br>
100% depending on the reaction conditions. The products were collected by flowing the reactor exit gases through a 20-60-wt% of aqueous KOH scrubber solution and then trapping the exit gases from the scrubber into a cylinder kept in dry ice or liquid N2. The products were then substantial isolatecl by distillation. Results are tabulated in Table 1.<br>

EXAMPLE 4A-4C<br>
Preparation of CH3CF2CH2C! from 2,3-dichloropropene using HF/SbCl5<br>
Example 4A<br>
A 2-gallon autoclave was charged with about 900 grams (8.1 mol) of 2,3-dichloropropene, about 405 grams (20.3 mol) of HF, and about 10 grams (0.033 mol) of SbCl5. The contents were heated with stirring to about 100°C for about 19 hours. The maximum pressure was about 285 psig. (approx. 2000 kPa). The contents were vented while hot into a fluoropolymer container containing ice, which was connected in sequence to a dry ice trap. The organic layer was separated and washed to remove<br>
residual acid, giving about 811.9 grams of crude product, which by GC analysis was comprised of about 41% CH3CF2CH2Cl, about 34.5% CH3CFC1CH2C1, 21 % CH3CCl2CH2Cl, and about 1.8 % starting material. The conversion was about 97 %, while the combined yield of halopropanes was 76.7 %. Substantially pure CH3CF2CH2CI was obtained by fractional distillation. The autoclave also contained about 77.8 grams of black residue.<br>
Example 4B<br>
Example 4A was repeated except that the reactants were heated to about 120°C for about 18 hours. The crude organic layer so obtained consisted of about 58.8 % CH3CF2CH2Cl, about 28.3 % CH3CFClCH2Cl, and about 9.8 % CH3CCl2CH2Cl. The combined yield of halopropanes was about 74 %.<br>
Example 4C<br>
Example 4A was repeated except that no catalyst was used. The crude organic layer so obtained consisted of about 58.7 % CH3CF2CH2C1, about 25.9 % CH3CFC1CH2C1, and about 12.2 % CH3CCl2CH2CI. The combined yield of halopropanes was about 80%. This example demonstrates that SbC15 catalyst was not effective in increasing the amount of the desired CH3CF2CH2Cl or increasing the total yield of useful products.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Conversion of 2,3-dichloropropene to CH3CFClCH2Cl<br>
A two-gallon autoclave was evacuated and charged with about 1500 grams of 2,3-dichloropropene (about 13.4 mol). It was then cooled to about -5°C by means of internal cooling coils connected to a chiller. About 1500 grams (75 mol) was added, the chiller turned off, and the contents slowly heated to a temperature in the range of from about 20 to about 25 °C with stirring. After approximately 18 hours, the contents were cooled to about 5°C before discharging into iced water. The organic phase was separated and washed with about 1 L of water, dried (MgSO4) and filtered to give about 1554 grams of the product mixture. GC analysis indicated that the crude product contained about 86.5 % CH3CFClCH2Cl, about 3.8 % CH3CF2CH2C1, and about 2.8 %<br>
CH3CO2CH2Cl. Similar results were obtained at a temperature of about 50°C, although the amount of CH3CFClCH2Cl decreased slightly, while the amount of CH3CF2CH2Cl marginally increased.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Conversion of CH3CCI2CH2CI to CH3CF2CH2CI<br>
An autoclave was charged with about 100 grams of CH3CCl2CH2Cl and about 44 grams of HF and the contents heated with stirring to about 130°C for about 20.5 hours. The products were process substantially in accordance with the description in Example 1, which resulted in about 70 grams of crude product which was comprised, based on GC area %, about 43.8 % CH3CF2CH2C1, about 23.1 % CH3CFClCH2Cl, and about 30.3 % CH3CCl2CH2Cl. The autoclave also contained about 1.9 grains of dark residue.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Conversion of a mixture of CH3CFClCH2C1 and CH3CC12CH2Cl to CH3CF2CH2CI<br>
A mixture of about 666 grams of CH3CFClCH2Cl, about 268 grams of CH3CCl2CH2Cl, about 474 grams of HF and about 11 grams of SnCl4 were heated together with stirring to about 114°C for about 18 hours. The crude product was comprised of about 89 % CH3CF2CH2Cl.<br>
Based on the results of Examples 4 - 7, the use of chlorinated antimony catalyst, such as SbCl5 may not be preferred in certain embodiments due to an added cost that may not provide the desired improvement in yield or conversion in some embodiments, and may produce considerable by-product residue. In certain embodiments, therefore, it is preferred to run the reaction without catalyst. However, the use of SnCU may be preferred in embodiments in which CH3CF2CH2Cl is the desired product, since its use may allow a lower temperature to be used and result in a higher percentage of CH3CF2CH2Cl in the crude product.<br>
EXAMPLES 8A-8C Preparation of CH3CF2CC13<br>
The photochlorination of CH3CF2CH3 to CH3CF2CC13 has been mentioned in JACS, 59 (1937) 2436, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Example 8A - Photochlorination of CH3CF2CH2Cl<br>
The photochlorination was done using a 100-W Hg lamp placed in a quartz jacket that was cooled with the use of a circulating cooling bath set at about -5°C. The quartz jacket was inserted into a glass reactor of about 400 mL capacity. The reactor was cooled externally by placing it in a glycol-water bath which was cooled with the use of cooling coils connected to a second circulating bath set at -8.5 C. The reactor was fitted with a thermocouple, stir bar, and a gas inlet tube for introducing chlorine gas from a cylinder via a calibrated flowmeter. Exiting gases passed through a water-cooled condenser, an air trap, and a scrubber containing NaOH and Na2S03 to remove HC1 and chlorine.<br>
The reactor was charged with about 250.5 grams of CH3CF2CH2CI of about 98.6 % purity and allowed to cool to a substantially constant temperature of about -5.5 C. The chlorine cylinder was then opened and the flow rate set at 23 g/h. Immediately thereafter, the lamp was then turned on. After approximately 0.5 hours, the temperature of the reactor contents stabilized at about -3 ±0.5 C.<br>
The photochlorination was continued for about 7 hours and a conversion of about 79.4% was achieved. The composition of the crude product, which amounted to about 309.3 grams, was about 19.2 % CH3CF2CH2C1 , about 50.9 % CH3CF2CHC12 and about 24.8 % CH3CF2CC13. Substantially pure CH3CF2CCl3 was obtained by fractional distillation.<br>
A 450-W Hg lamp could also be used. The ratios of CH3CF2CHC12 to CH3CF2CCU vs. time were essentially the same as with a 100-watt lamp.<br>
Example 8B - Photochlorination of CH3CF2CHCl2<br>
In a manner similar to that described in Example 8A, about 296.8 grams of CH3CF2CHC12 (about 97.4 % pure, containing about 1.9 % CH3CF2CC13) was photochlorinated using a 100-W Hg lamp at a temperature of about -4°C and chlorine<br>
feed rate of about 22.3 g/h. After about 2.5 hours, the composition of the reactor contents was about 58.2 % CH3CF2CHCI2 and about 39.9 % CH3CF2CCI3. Thus the selectivity for CH3CF2CCI3 was about 97 % at a CH3CF2CHCI2 conversion of about 40<br>
%.<br>
EXAMPLE IOC<br>
Photochlorination of a mixture of CH3CF2CH2C1 and CH3CF2CHC12<br>
The selectivity found in Examples 8A and 8C is considered to be desirably for many embodiments of the invention. However, limiting the conversion achieved in those examples may be less than desired in certain applications. It is believed that the conversions may be limited in those example by two factors. One factor is the melting point of CH3CF2CCl3 (53 C) and the other is lower selectivity at high conversion. The latter may be a problem in connection with certain commercial embodiments where such yield losses may be unacceptable. Therefore to keep selectivity high with relatively high conversion, it is advantageous in certain embodiments to run the photochlorination with less than 100 % conversion of CH3CF2CHCl2 and recycle this material along with fresh CH3CF2CH2Cl, preferably in the next batch. In preferred embodiments, the amount of CH3CF2CHCl2 made is approximately equal to the amount added as recycled material.<br>
A mixture of about 202.4 grams of CH3CF2CH2C1 and about 110.7 g of CH3CF2CHCl2 was photochlorinated using a 100-watt Hg lamp at a temperature of about -4°C with a chlorine feed rate of about 22.2 g/h as described in Example 10A. After an irradiation time of about 8.4 hours the conversion of CH3CF2CH2CI exceeded about 90 %. The composition of the crude product was about 6.9 wt% CH3CF2CH2Cl, 45.2 wt% CH3CF2CHCl2, and 43.5 wt% CH3CF2CC13. The amount of CH3CF2CHC12 initially increased with time, reaching a maximum of about 55 wt % after about 5 hours.<br>
EXAMPLE 90A - 90C<br>
Conversion of 2,3-dichloropropene Example 10A<br><br>
About 65 cc of 50 weight% SbC15 on activated carbon support is provided at a temperature of about 95°C. The catalyst was loaded into the 1/2" OD x 36" L monel tube. 2,3-dichloropropene was used for the oiganic feed stock. After normal catalyst activation with HF and C12, the C12 flow was stopped and the HF feed was adjusted to a rate of about 47 g/hr. Shortly thereafter, the 2,3-dichloropropene feed was started at a rate of about 20 — 25 g/hr. The HF/organic mole ratio was 11.5/1. The pressure was about 20 psig. The contact time was about 6.73 sec. Reactor effluent samples were collected in Tedlar gas sample bags containing DI water to absorb the acid before analysis. The bags were then heated to about 60°C to ensure that the organic present in the bag was completely vaporized. GC/MS results showed the major product to be 1-chloro-2,2-difiuoTopropane (262ca) with an area of about 93.3%. Also present are about 3.7 area% of 1,2,2-trifluoropropane (263ca) and about 3.4 area% of 272ca. The conversion of the 2,3-dichloropropene was about 100%.<br>
Example 10B<br>
This example was run similarly to Example 10A but the reaction temperature was about 135°C. The contact time was about 6.07 sec. The GC/MS results of the bag sample show about 72.8 area% for l-chloro-2,2-difluoropropane (262ca), about 15.11 area% for 1,2-dichloro-2-fluoropropane (261ba), about 4.8 area% for 263ca, about 4.1 area% for 2,2-difluoropropane (272ca) and about 2.6 area% for 1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4-nanofluorohexane.<br>
Example IPC<br>
This Example was run similarly to Example 10A but the reaction temperature was about 195°C. The contact time was about 5.29 sec. The GC/MS results of the bag sample show about 38.59 area% for l-chloro-2,2-difluoropropane (262ca), about 29.3 area% for 1,2-dichloro-2-fluoropropane (261ba), about 4.7 area% for 263ca, about 20.12 area% for272ca and about 7.3 area% for 1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4-nanofluoroh.exane.<br>
