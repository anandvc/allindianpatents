				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a hair cleansing and conditioning shampoo composition containing a dispersed gel network phase comprising a fatty alcohol. More particularly, the present invention relates to such a shampoo composition in which the dispersed gel network phase has a melt transition temperature of at least about 38 °C. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Human hair becomes soiled due to its contact with the surrounding environment and from the sebum secreted by the scalp. The soiling of hair causes it to have a dirty feel and an unattractive appearance. The soiling of the hair necessitates shampooing with frequent regularity.<br>
Shampooing cleans the hair by removing excess soil and sebum. However, shampooing can leave the hair in a wet, tangled, and generally unmanageable state. Once the hair dries, it is often left in a dry, rough, lusterless, or frizzy condition due to removal of the hair's natural oils and other natural conditioning and moisturizing components. The hair can further be left with increased levels of static upon drying, which can interfere with combing and result in a condition commonly referred to as "fly-away hair."<br>
A variety of approaches have been developed to alleviate these after-shampoo problems. These approaches range from post-shampoo application of hair conditioners such as leave-on and rinse-off products, to hair conditioning shampoos which attempt to both cleanse and condition the hair from a single product.<br>
In order to provide hair conditioning benefits in a cleansing shampoo base, a wide variety of conditioning actives have been proposed. However, many of these actives have the disadvantage of leaving the hair feeling soiled or coated and of interfering with the cleansing efficacy of the shampoo.<br>
Coacervate formation in a shampoo composition is known to be advantageous for providing conditioning benefits to the hair. The use of cationic polymers to form coacervate is known in the art, such as in PCT publications WO 93/08787 and WO 95/01152. However, these shampoo compositions are good for delivering wet hair conditioning but are not capable of delivering satisfactory dry hair smooth feel.<br>
Based on the foregoing, there is a need for a conditioning shampoo which can<br>
provide improved conditioning benefit for dry hair, while not interfering with the cleansing efficacy, nor providing negative feel to the hair when it is dried. Specifically, there is a need to provide long lasting moisturized feel, smooth feel, and manageability control to the hair when the hair is dried, yet not leave the hair feeling greasy, as well as to provide softness and ease of combing when the hair is wet.<br>
Recently, the use of shampoo compositions comprising a dispersed fatty alcohol gel network phase has been proposed to achieve improved wet feel and dry conditioning benefit while not interfering with cleansing efficacy. In such shampoo compositions, the fatty alcohol is in the form of a solid crystalline gel network phase, meaning that the fatty alcohol is arranged in multi-lamellar vesicles and lamellar sheets in the dispersed phase. It is believed that this physical structure of the gel network allows the fatty alcohol to deposit on the hair in sheets, with the fatty ends of the fatty alcohol molecules aligning away from the hair and forming a low friction surface, which contributes to the improved conditioning benefit. For use in such shampoo compositions, U.S. 2003/0223952 Al to Wells et al. ("Wells") discloses that fatty alcohols having from about 16 to about 18 carbon atoms are most preferable. Additionally, Wells exemplifies only shampoo compositions comprising combinations of cetyl (i.e., Cie) alcohol and stearyl (i.e., Cis) alcohol.<br>
While this approach leads, generally, to achieving the described benefits, it has now been found that shampoo compositions comprising a dispersed fatty alcohol gel network phase, wherein the dispersed fatty alcohol gel network phase has a melt transition temperature of at least about 38 °C, are most storage stable under standard physical stability protocols and surprisingly also deliver superior dry conditioning benefits versus shampoo compositions such as those disclosed as preferable and exemplified in Wells.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a shampoo composition comprising: (a) from about 5 % to about 50 % of one or more detersive surfactants, by weight of the shampoo composition; (b) a dispersed gel network phase comprising: (i) at least about 0.05 % of one or more fatty alcohols, by weight of the shampoo composition; (ii) at least about 0.01 % of one or more secondary surfactants, by weight of the shampoo composition; and (iii)<br>

The shampoo compositions of the present invention comprise one or more detersive surfactants, a dispersed gel network phase which has a melt transition temperature of at least about 38 °C, and an aqueous carrier. Each of these essential components, as well as preferred or optional components, is described in detail hereinafter. A. Detersive Surfactant<br>
The shampoo compositions of the present invention comprise one or more detersive surfactants. The detersive surfactant component is included in shampoo compositions of the present invention to provide cleansing performance. The detersive surfactant may be selected from anionic detersive surfactant, zwitterionic or amphoteric detersive surfactant, or a combination thereof. Such surfactants should be physically and chemically compatible with the essential components described herein, or should not otherwise unduly impair product stability, aesthetics or performance.<br>
Suitable anionic detersive surfactant components for use in the composition herein include those which are known for use in hair care or other personal care cleansing compositions. The concentration of the anionic surfactant component in the composition should be sufficient to provide the desired cleaning and lather performance, and generally range from about 5% to about 50%, preferably from about 8% to about 30%, more preferably from about 10% to about 25%, even more preferably from about 12% to about 22%, by weight of the composition.<br>
Suitable zwitterionic or amphoteric detersive surfactants for use in the composition herein include those which are known for use in hair care or other personal<br>
cleansing compositions. Concentration of such amphoteric detersive surfactants preferably ranges from about 0.5% to about 20%, preferably from about 1% to about 10%. Non-limiting examples of suitable zwitterionic or amphoteric surfactants are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,104,646 and 5,106,609, both to Bolich Jr. et al.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may further comprise additional surfactants for use in combination with the anionic detersive surfactant component described hereinbefore. Suitable additional surfactants include cationic and nonionic surfactants.<br>
Non-limiting examples of other anionic, zwitterionic, amphoteric,  cationic, nonionic, or optional additional surfactants suitable for use in the compositions are described in McCutcheon's, Emulsifiers and Detergents, 1989 Annual, published by M. C. Publishing Co., and U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,929,678; 2,658,072; 2,438,091; and 2,528,378. B.       Dispersed Gel Network Phase<br>
The shampoo compositions of the present invention comprise a dispersed gel network phase comprising one or more fatty alcohols. The fatty alcohol, or mixture of different fatty alcohols, is selected for use in the present invention such that the dispersed gel network phase (i.e., as a phase which is incorporated and dispersed into the final shampoo composition) has a melt transition temperature of at least about 38 °C, which is described in further detail below.<br>
The dispersed gel network phase is included in shampoo compositions of the present invention to provide conditioning benefits. As used herein, the term "gel network" refers to a lamellar or vesicular solid crystalline phase which comprises at least one fatty alcohol as specified below, at least one secondary surfactant as specified below, and water or other suitable solvents. The lamellar or vesicular phase comprises bi-layers made up of a first layer comprising the fatty alcohol and the secondary surfactant and alternating with a second layer comprising the water or other suitable solvent. The term "solid crystalline", as used herein, refers to the structure of the lamellar or vesicular phase which forms at a temperature below the melt transition temperature of the layer in the gel network comprising the one or more fatty alcohols, the melt transition temperature being at least about 27 °C (i.e., slightly above about room temperature). The melt transition temperature may be measured by differential scanning calorimetry, a method of which is described below.<br>
For purposes of clarification, the melt transition temperature of at least 27 °C, which is referred to immediately above as part of the definition of "solid crystalline", is a different value from the melt transition temperature of the dispersed gel network phase of shampoo compositions of the present invention, which is at least about 38 °C. In other words, a lamellar or vesicular phase as described above may be solid crystalline (i.e., at least 27 °C), but such a solid crystalline lamellar or vesicular phase is not necessarily a dispersed gel network phase of shampoo compositions of the present invention (i.e., at least 38 °C).<br>
Gel networks which comprise, for example, fatty alcohols have been used for years in cosmetic creams and hair conditioners. Such cosmetic creams and hair conditioners, however, typically contain very low amounts, if any, of detersive surfactant. Thus, such known products do not provide a combination of cleansing and conditioning to the hair or skin.<br>
Gel networks, generally, are further described by G.M. Eccleston, "Functions of Mixed Emulsifiers and Emulsifying Waxes in Dermatological Lotions and Creams", Colloids and Surfaces A: Physiochem. and Eng. Aspects 123-124 (1997) 169-182; and by G.M Eccleston, "The Microstructure of Semisolid Creams", Pharmacy International, Vol. 7, 63-70(1986).<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the dispersed gel network phase is pre¬formed. The term "pre-formed", as used herein, means that at least fifty percent of the mixture of the fatty alcohol, secondary surfactant, and water or other suitable solvent is substantially a solid crystalline phase when added to the other components of the shampoo composition.<br>
According to this embodiment of the present invention, the gel network component of the present invention is prepared as a separate pre-mix, which, after being cooled, is subsequently incorporated with the detersive surfactant and the other components of the shampoo composition. Preparation of the gel network component is discussed in more detail below in the section entitled Process of Making a Shampoo Composition as well as in the Examples.<br>
The cooled and pre-formed gel network component subsequently is added to the other components of the shampoo composition, including the detersive surfactant component. While not intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that incorporation<br>
of the cooled and pre-formed gel network component with the detersive surfactant and other components of the shampoo composition allows the formation of a substantially equilibrated lamellar dispersion ("ELD") in the final shampoo composition. The ELD is a dispersed lamellar or vesicular phase resulting from the pre-formed gel network component substantially equilibrating with the detersive surfactants, water, and other optional components, such as salts, which may be present in the shampoo composition. This equilibration occurs upon incorporation of the pre-formed gel network component with the other components of the shampoo composition and is effectively complete within about 24 hours after making. Shampoo compositions in which the ELD is formed provide hair with improved wet and dry conditioning benefits. Further, the ELD does not form if the components which comprise the gel network component (i.e., the fatty alcohol and the secondary surfactant combined with water) are added as individual components together with the other components of the shampoo composition in one mixing step, and not as a separate cooled pre-formed gel network component.<br>
For purposes of clarification, as used herein, the term "ELD" refers to the same component of the shampoo compositions of the present invention as the phrase "dispersed gel network phase". Thus, in shampoo compositions according to the present invention, the ELD has a melt transition temperature of at least about 38 °C.<br>
As described above, the ELD is formed by the incorporation of the cooled and pre-formed gel network component with the detersive surfactant and other components of the shampoo composition. While the ELD and the pre-formed gel network component both comprise fatty alcohol, secondary surfactant, and water together in the form of a lamellar or vesicular solid crystalline phase, differences exist between certain physical properties of the ELD compared with those of the pre-formed gel network component. Prior to incorporation with the detersive surfactant and other components of the shampoo composition, the pre-formed gel network component consists essentially of fatty alcohol, secondary surfactant, and water. Upon incorporation, the lamellar structure of the gel network, acting as a template, is swelled by and equilibrates with the detersive surfactant and other components of the shampoo composition, such as salts and perfumes. Thus, it is believed that these differences in certain physical properties between the pre-formed gel network component and the ELD are consistent with the migration of, for example, the detersive surfactant, salts, and perfumes, into the gel network phase.<br>
For example, for such a pre-formed gel network component, as seen in Gel Network Example 4 below, the melt transition temperature is about 68.3 °C, as measured by differential scanning calorimetry. Additionally, the d-spacing is about 31.8 nm, as measured by small-angle x-ray scattering, and the fatty alcohol chain spacing is about 0.41 nm, as measured by wide-angle x-ray diffraction. After incorporation of the pre¬formed gel network component with the detersive surfactant and other components of the shampoo composition, the ELD is formed. As seen in Shampoo Example 4 below, the ELD has a lower melt transition temperature of about 41.8°C, and a lower d-spacing of about 9.0 nm. Notably, there is no substantial change in the fatty alcohol chain spacing, which infers that the fatty alcohol chains are still frozen in the ELD, just as they were in the pre-formed gel network component.<br>
Consequently, the presence of the gel network in the pre-mix and in the final shampoo composition in the form of the ELD can be confirmed by means known to one of skill in the art, such as X-ray analysis, optical microscopy, electron microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. A method of differential scanning calorimetry is described below. For methods of X-ray analysis, see U.S. 2006/0024256 Al.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the scale size of the dispersed gel network phase in the shampoo composition (i.e., the ELD) ranges from about 10 nm to about 500 nm. In another embodiment, the scale size of the dispersed gel network phase in the shampoo composition ranges from about 0.5 m to about 10 m. In yet another embodiment, the scale size of the dispersed gel network phase in the shampoo composition ranges from about 10 m to about 150 m.<br>
The scale size distribution of the dispersed gel network phase in the shampoo composition may be measured with a laser light scattering technique, using a Horiba model LA 910 Laser Scattering Particle Size Distribution Analyzer (Horiba Instruments, Inc. Irvine California, USA). The scale size distribution in a shampoo composition of the present invention may be measured by combining 1.75 g of the shampoo composition with 30 mL of 3% NRiCl, 20 mL of 2% Na2HPO4 TH^O, and 10 mL of 1% laureth-7 to form a mixture. This mixture is then stirred for 5 minutes. As appropriate for the individual Horiba instrument being used, samples in the range of 1 to 40 mL are taken and then injected into the Horiba instrument, which contains 75 mL of 3 % NHLtCl, 50 mL of 2% Na?HPO.t7H7O. and 25 mL of 1% laureth-7, until the Horiba instrument reading is<br>
between 88-92%T, which is needed for the scale size measurement. Once this is achieved, a measurement is taken after 2 minutes of circulation through the Horiba instrument to provide the scale size measurement. A subsequent measurement is taken using a sample of the shampoo composition which has been heated above the melt transition temperature of all fatty materials present in the shampoo composition, such that the gel network component is melted. This subsequent measurement allows a scale size distribution to be taken of all of the remaining materials in the shampoo, which then can be compared to the scale size distribution of the first sample and assist in the analysis.<br>
The shampoo compositions of the present invention comprise a dispersed fatty alcohol gel network phase (i.e., the ELD phase) in an amount greater than about 0.1 %, preferably from about 1 % to about 60 %, and more preferably from about 5 % to about 40 %, by weight of the shampoo composition. 1.       Fattv Alcohol<br>
The gel network component of the present invention comprises at least one fatty alcohol. Individual fatty alcohol compounds or combinations of two or more different fatty alcohol compounds may be selected, provided that the resulting dispersed gel network phase, in the form of the ELD (i.e., as a phase which is incorporated and dispersed into the final shampoo composition), has a melt transition temperature of at least about 38 °C, as measured according to differential scanning calorimetry. The melt transition temperature is discussed in more detail below.<br>
Fatty alcohols suitable for use in the present invention are those having from about 18 to about 70 carbon atoms, and in one embodiment from about 18 to about 60 carbon atoms, in another embodiment from about 18 to about 50 carbon atoms, in yet another embodiment from about 18 to about 40 carbon atoms, and in even yet another embodiment from about 18 to about 22 carbon atoms. These fatty alcohols may be straight or branched chain alcohols and may be saturated or unsaturated. Non-limiting examples of suitable fatty alcohols include stearyl alcohol, arachidyl alcohol, behenyl alcohol, C21 fatty alcohol (1-heneicosanol), C23 fatty alcohol (1-tricosanol), C24 fatty alcohol (lignoceryl alcohol, 1-tetracosanol), C26 fatty alcohol (1-hexacosanol), C28 fatty alcohol (i-octacosanol), C30 fatty alcohol (1-triacontanol), C20-40 alcohols (e.g., Performacol 350 and 425 Alcohols, available from New Phase Technologies), C30-50<br>
alcohols (e.g., Perforraacol 550 Alcohol), C40-60 alcohols (e.g., Performacol 700 Alcohol), and mixtures thereof.<br>
Mixtures of different fatty alcohols comprising one or more fatty alcohols having from about 18 to about 70 carbon atoms may also comprise some amount of one or more fatty alcohols or other fatty amphiphiles which have less than about 18 carbon atoms or greater than about 70 carbon atoms and still be considered to be within the scope of the present invention, provided that the resulting dispersed gel network phase has a melt transition temperature of at least about 38 °C.<br>
Such fatty alcohols suitable for use in the present invention may be of natural or vegetable origin, or they may be of synthetic origin.<br>
The shampoo compositions of the present invention comprise fatty alcohol as part of the dispersed gel network phase in an amount from about 0.05 % to about 14 %, preferably from about 0.5 % to about 10 %, and more preferably from about 1 % to about 8 %, by weight of the shampoo composition.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the weight ratio of the fatty alcohol to the secondary surfactant in the gel network component is greater than about 1:9, preferably greater than about 1:5 to about 100:1, more preferably greater than about 1:1 to about 50:1.<br>
2.        Dispersed Gel Network Phase Melt Transition Temperature<br>
According to the present invention, the dispersed gel network phase has a melt transition temperature of at least about 38 °C, as measured according to differential scanning calorimetry. In one embodiment, the dispersed gel network phase has a melt transition temperature from about 38 °C to about 80 °C. In another embodiment, the dispersed gel network phase has a melt transition temperature from about 40 °C to about 60 °C. In a further embodiment, the dispersed gel network phase has a melt transition temperature from about 40 °C to about 55 °C. In an even further embodiment, the dispersed gel network phase has a melt transition temperature from about 40 °C to about 50 °C.<br>
It is believed that, in the shampoo compositions of the present invention, the use of one or more fatty alcohols which result in the formation of a dispersed gel network phase having a melt transition temperature of at least about 38 °C contributes to improved physical stability of the shampoo compositions while surprisingly also delivering superior<br>
dry conditioning benefits versus shampoo compositions comprising a dispersed gel network which has a melt transition temperature below about 38 °C.<br>
As described above, the selection of a suitable fatty alcohol or mixture of different fatty alcohols provides that the resulting dispersed gel network phase has a melt transition temperature of at least about 38 °C. Additionally, the selection of certain secondary surfactants can contribute to obtaining a melt transition temperature of at least about 38 °C for the resulting dispersed gel network phase.<br>
The melt transition temperature of the dispersed gel network phase may be obtained using differential scanning calorimetry according to the following method. Utilizing a TA Instruments Q100 DSC, approximately 50 mg of the gel network pre-mix or the final shampoo composition containing the gel network is placed into a stainless steel high volume DSC pan. The sample, along with an empty reference pan is placed into the instrument. The samples are analyzed using the following conditions/temperature program: Nitrogen Purge, Equilibrate @ 5.00°C until an isothermal is reach for 2.00 min. Ramp the temperature at a rate of 3.00°C/min to 90.00°C. Each sample is analyzed in duplicate. The resulting DSC data is analyzed using TA Instruments Universal Analysis Software.<br>
The use of DSC to measure the melt transition temperature for gel networks is further described by T. de Vringer et al, Colloid and Polymer Science, vol. 265, 448-457 (1987); and H.M. Ribeiro et al., Intl. J. of Cosmetic Science, vol. 26, 47-59 (2004). 3.        Secondary Surfactant<br>
The gel network component of the present invention also comprises a secondary surfactant. As used herein, "secondary surfactant" refers to one or more surfactants which are combined with the fatty alcohol and water to form the gel network of the present invention as a pre-mix separate from the other components of the shampoo composition. The secondary surfactant is separate from and in addition to the detersive surfactant component of the shampoo composition. However, the secondary surfactant may be the same or different type of surfactant or surfactants as that or those selected for the detersive surfactant component described above.<br>
The shampoo compositions of the present invention comprise secondary surfactant as part of the pre-formed dispersed gel network phase in an amount from about<br>
0.01% to about 15%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 10%, and more preferably from about 0.3% to about 5%, by weight of the shampoo composition.<br>
Suitable secondary surfactants include anionic, zwitterionic, amphoteric, cationic, and nonionic surfactants. Preferably, the secondary surfactant is selected from anionic, cationic, and nonionic surfactants, and mixtures thereof. For additional discussion of secondary surfactants which are suitable for use in the present invention, see U.S. 2006/0024256 Al.<br>
Additionally, in an embodiment of the present invention, certain secondary surfactants which have a hydrophobic tail group with a chain length of from about 16 to about 22 carbon atoms may be selected to contribute to obtaining a melt transition temperature of at least about 38 °C for the resulting dispersed gel network phase. For such secondary surfactants, the hydrophobic tail group may be alkyl, alkenyl (containing up to 3 double bonds), alkyl aromatic, or branched alkyl. In such an embodiment, it is preferred that the secondary surfactant is present in the gel network component relative to the fatty alcohol at a weight ratio from about 1:5 to about 5:1.<br>
Mixtures of more than one surfactant of the above specified types may be used for the secondary surfactant of the present invention. 4.      <br>
  Water or Suitable Solvents<br>
The gel network component of the present invention also comprises water or suitable solvents.

When certain oil-soluble components, such as perfumes and fragrances, amino acids, water-insoluble vitamins, and the like, are present in the dispersed gel network phase, either by incorporating such components directly into the gel network component pre-mix or separately into the shampoo composition and consequently some amount of such components migrate into the dispersed gel network phase during equilibration, they may be effectively deposited on hair and/or skin. To obtain very effective deposition of oil-soluble components on hair and/or skin via their presence in the dispersed gel network phase, oil-soluble component compositions which comprise no less than about 60 % of ingredients having a Clog P of about 3 or higher are preferred. For further discussion on Clog P and how to determine its value for a variety of materials, see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,849,310 and 5,500,154 as well as EP 1 533 364. E. Process of Making a Shampoo Composition<br>
An aspect of the invention relates to a process of making a shampoo composition of the present invention. The process of making a shampoo composition comprises (a) combining a fatty alcohol, a secondary surfactant, and water at a temperature sufficient to allow partitioning of the secondary surfactant and the water into the fatty alcohol to form a pre-mix; (b) cooling the pre-mix below the chain melt temperature of the fatty alcohol<br>
to form a gel network; (c) adding the gel network to one or more detersive surfactants and an aqueous carrier to form a shampoo composition which comprises a dispersed gel network phase having a melt transition temperature of at least about 38 °C.<br>
As discussed above, in one embodiment of the present invention, the gel network component is prepared as a separate pre-mix, which, after being cooled, is subsequently incorporated with the other components of the shampoo composition. More specifically, the gel network component of the present invention may be prepared by heating the fatty alcohol, the secondary surfactant, and water to a level in the range of about 75 °C to about 90 °C and mixing. This mixture is cooled to a level in the range of about 27 °C to about 35 °C by, for example, passing the mixture through a heat exchanger. As a result of this cooling step, at least about fifty percent of the mixture of the fatty alcohol and the secondary surfactant crystallize to form a crystalline gel network.<br>
Alternative methods of preparing the gel network component include sonic ation and/or milling of the fatty alcohol, the secondary surfactant, and water, while these components are heated, to reduce the particle size of the melted fatty alcohol phase. This results in an increase in surface area of the fatty alcohol phase, which allows the secondary surfactant and the water to swell the fatty alcohol phase. Another suitable variation in preparing the gel network includes heating and mixing the fatty alcohol and the secondary surfactant first, and then adding that mixture to the water. F. Method of Use<br>
The compositions of the present invention are used in a conventional manner for cleansing and conditioning hair or skin, including scalp, face, and body. Generally, a method of treating hair or skin of the present invention comprises applying the composition of the present invention to the hair or skin. More specifically, an effective amount of the composition is applied to the hair or skin, which has preferably been wetted with water, and then the composition is rinsed off. Such effective amounts generally range from about 1 g to about 50 g, preferably from about 1 g to about 20 g. Application to the hair typically includes working the composition through the hair such that most or all of the hair is contacted with the composition.<br>
The method for treating the hair or skin comprises the steps of: (a) wetting the hair or skin with water; (b) applying an effective amount of the shampoo composition to the hair or skin, and (c) rinsing the applied areas of skin or hair with water. These steps<br>
can be repeated as many times as desired to achieve the desired cleansing and conditioning benefit.<br>
In one embodiment, the shampoo composition of the present invention advantageously is used to treat damaged hair. Damaged hair may include hair selected from permed hair, oxidatively colored hair, and mechanically damaged hair.<br>
In another embodiment, the shampoo composition is used to treat skin, such as the scalp, the face, and the body.<br>
The shampoo compositions of this invention may be used as liquids, solids, semi-solids, flakes, gels, placed in a pressurized container with a propellant added, or used in a pump spray form. The viscosity of the product may be selected to accommodate the form desired.<br>
NON-LIMITING EXAMPLES<br>
The shampoo compositions illustrated in the following Examples illustrate specific embodiments of the shampoo compositions of the present invention, but are not intended to be limiting thereof. Other modifications can be undertaken by the skilled artisan without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention. These exemplified embodiments of the shampoo composition of the present invention provide enhanced conditioning benefits to the hair.<br>
The shampoo compositions illustrated in the following Examples are prepared by conventional formulation and mixing methods, an example of which is set forth hereinbelow. All exemplified amounts are listed as weight percents and exclude minor materials such as diluents, preservatives, color solutions, imagery ingredients, botanicals, and so forth, unless otherwise specified. All percentages are based on weight unless otherwise specified.<br>
Preparation of the Gel Network Pre-Mix<br>
To prepare the gel network pre-mix, about 20% of the water is heated to about 74 °C and the fatty alcohol and the secondary surfactant (e.g., Behenyltrimethylammonium chloride (Varisofl BT-85) or Sodium Laureth Sulfate) are added to it. After incorporation, this mixture is passed through a mill and heat exchanger where it is cooled to about 35 °C. As a result of this cooling step, the fatty alcohol, the secondary surfactant, and the water form a crystalline gel network.<br>
For mixtures of different fatty alcohols, it may be beneficial to pre-mix the fatty alcohol materials before incorporation into the water. This can be done by co-melting the different fatty alcohols together and utilizing this melt or cooling into a solid phase and incorporating this into the heated water along with the secondary surfactant. Another variation could be to co-melt the one or more fatty alcohols and the secondary surfactant before incorporation into the water.<br>

Preparation of Final Shampoo Compositions<br>
To prepare the final shampoo composition, first, a surfactant solution pre-mix is formed. To prepare this surfactant solution pre-mix, about 6% to about 9% of sodium or ammonium laureth-3 sulfate, cationic polymers, and about 0% to about 5% of water are added to a jacketed mix tank and heated to about 74 °C with agitation. To this solution, citric acid, sodium citrate, sodium benzoate, and disodium EDTA are added to the tank and allowed to disperse. Ethylene glycol distearate (EGDS) is then added to the mixing vessel and melted. After the EGDS was well dispersed (e.g., after about 10 minutes), preservative is added and mixed into the surfactant solution. This mixture is passed through a mill and heat exchanger where it is cooled to about 35 °C and collected in a finishing tank. As a result of this cooling step, the EGDS crystallizes to form a waxy crystalline suspension. The mixture of these components is the surfactant solution pre-mix.<br>
Next, the surfactant solution pre-mix and the gel network pre-mix, which is prepared as described above, are mixed together. The remainder of the surfactants, perfume, dimethicone, sodium chloride or ammonium xylene sulfonate for viscosity adjustment, and the remainder of the water are added with ample agitation to ensure a homogeneous mixture. This mixture is the final shampoo composition which comprises as a dispersed phase the gel network pre-mix.<br>
Preferred viscosities of the final shampoo composition according to the present invention range from about 5000 to about 15,000 centipoise at 27 °C, as measured by a Wells-Brookfield model RVTDCP viscometer using a CP-41 cone and plate at 2/s at 3 minutes.<br>
The pH may be adjusted as necessary to provide shampoo compositions of the present invention which are suitable for application to human hair, and may vary based on the selection of particular detersive surfactants, fatty alcohols, and/or other components.<br>
