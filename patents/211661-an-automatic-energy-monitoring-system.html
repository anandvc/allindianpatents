				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>ABSTRACT The purpose of the invention is to modernize the management of electricity supply system. The meter under invention is a pre-paid type, where : the payment for using electricity is made in advance. the meter is designed to display the consumption of electricity in terms of it&#x27;s use value (e.g. rupees in India). Any medium such as Power line carrier communication, Hot wire technology, Telephone lines or, Radio Frequency Signals can be used for communicating with meters. The advance payment made by the consumer is fed in the respective meters, as balance. This balance is then decremented according to the consumption. Supply of power is cut automatically, as the balance reaches to zero. For the convenience of the consumer and saving them from unwanted power cut, there is a provision in the meter, for setting a reserve amount. As the balance goes below this amount, meter reminds the consumer (by giving alarm) for making payment. The time of alarm can be set by the consumer. Time to time changes in the tariff plan are communicated to respective meters for resetting the previous values. Depending upon the month&#x27;s consumption, the appropriate current rate is selected automatically. The month&#x27;s consumption (in KW-Hrs) reads zero at beginning and is incremented as per the consumption of electricity. This is reset to zero at the end of each month. The month&#x27;s consumption supports two functions in the meter. 1. Helps the meter to select the appropriate rate as defined in the tariff plan. The rate varies, as the month&#x27;s consumption touches a new slab. 2. Helps deduct the amount for un-used portion of electricity, if there is any system for minimum monthly consumption. Other charges/taxes (as applicable) are deducted at the end of each month along with the minimum monthly consumption. Level indicators for showing the &quot;power factor&quot; and &quot;amperage&quot; are fitted in the meter. In case of three phase connection, a seven segment LED indicates the &quot;correctness of sequence of phases&quot;. The system enables the Electricity companies with automatic detection of theft cases. For preventing complete back-outs, during shortage of electricity, alternate meters can be kept off. This is done by setting different power cut periods in different meters. The system is fully automatic. There is no need of accounting staff and meter readers. No chance of human errors, which otherwise causes a long queue of consumers seeking correction in their bills, at the account section&#x27;s window. 1 6 MAY 2005</td>

The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in<br>

	which it is to be performed.	GRANTED<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>

Field of the invention<br>
The invention pertains to a new approach for electricity management system, wherein the distribution of electricity is totally software controlled. The meter used in the system is a pre-paid meter, where the payment for using electricity will be made in advance.<br>
The advance payment made by the consumer is fed in the respective meters, as balance. This balance is then decremented according to the consumption. Supply of power is cut automatically as the balance reaches to zero. An alarm level can be set by the consumer for reminding him to make payment before the balance reaches to zero. As soon as the payment is made, the same is communicated automatically to the respective meter for resetting the balance.<br>
The meter is designed in such a way as to display the consumption in terms of it's use value (e.g. Rupees in India).<br>
Any medium such as,<br>
&gt;	Power .line carrier communication,<br>
&gt;	Hot wire technology,<br>
&gt;	Telephone lines, or<br>
&gt;	Radio Frequency Signals<br>
can be used for communicating with meters.<br>
Any kind of pilferage or tempering in the meter is detected and the same will be communicated to the concerned executive.<br>
The system is capable of managing the power distribution during shortage of electricity according to the priority set by the electricity companies.<br>
The system is capable of avoiding any kind of accidents arising due to short circuit, falling of live wire during stormy weather etc.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is aimed at modifications over the existing system where:<br>
&gt;	The energy meter displays the consumption in terms of units (i.e. KW-Hrs.).<br>
Displaying the consumption in terms of units does not attract the consumer<br>
to view the meter (This is a more particular in case of multi-storied<br>
buildings, where the meters are installed at the ground floor) and realize<br>
the importance of saving electrical energy by avoiding waste.<br><br>
&gt;	For generating the bill it is a mandatory requirement to send the meter reader for taking down the readings and submitting it to the account section.<br>
&gt;	No system exists to detect and avoid the pilferage of electricity.<br>
&gt;	In case of fire accidents, especially due to short circuit or accidental falling of live wire especially caused by strong winds, immediate switching off the power supply is not possible.<br>
&gt;	During the shortage of electricity, the power supply is cut-off for the whole area, resulting in complete black-out. This occasionally leads to criminal acts in that area.<br>
&gt;	Recovery of payment is a problem for electricity companies. Sometimes it becomes unavoidable, not to stop the power supply even after heavy dues.<br>
&gt;	Human error involved in taking the reading or generating the bills, creates a long queue of consumers seeking correction in their bill, at account section's window. This causes wastage of huge man-hours for electricity companies as well as for consumers.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
An awareness program to consumers, for consciously using the electrical energy and avoiding it's waste, was always a requirement for the nation.<br>
The shortcomings as stated in the background of the invention above, are solved in the new system, as :<br>
&gt;	Money is a concern for every body. Displaying the meter reading, as the<br>
balance amount left, puts a psychological pressure to the consumer to<br>
consciously use the electricity and switch off the lights and other electrical<br>
appliances when not in use, thereby contributing to the saving of electrical<br>
energy.<br>
In case of multi storied buildings, where the meters are installed at ground floor, it becomes further inconvenient for a consumer to view his meter. In the new system there is no requirement of any meter reader, and thus, the meter can be installed at the consumer's flat itself. This helps the consumer to view the meter and monitor the consumption.<br><br><br>
&gt;	Since the system under invention is based on telemetry, there is no requirement of detailing any person for taking down the meter reading. The meters can be installed at the consumer's flat itself.<br>
&gt;	Enables spot detection of the pilferage or any kind of tempering in the meter.<br>
&gt;	Power supply cut off automatically, in case of fire accidents especially due to short circuit or accidental falling of live wire especially caused by strong winds.<br>
&gt;	Minimum required amount of power supply is allowed to continue during scheduled power cut periods.<br>
&gt;	Advance payment to Electricity companies. Now recovery of payment is not a problem. This is purely a pre-paid system. A consumer will be able to use the electricity, only for the money he deposited in advance. He is bound to make payment, before the meter goes down to zero. Zero reading in the balance section, causes automatic discontinuation of electricity supply. Restarting the supply is possible only after the payment is done.<br>
&gt;	The system is fully automatic. There is no need of accounting staff and meter readers. No chance of human errors, which otherwise creats a long queue of consumers seeking correction in their bills, at the account section's window.<br>

FIG. 1 is a diagram showing an energy monitoring system according to an embodiment of the present invention. The system comprises a central control unit, one or more hub(s), and one or more nodal centers communicably coupled via a communication channel. In an embodiment the communication channel is power line carrier communication (PLCC) channel. A plurality of meters is connected to a nodal center and the nodal center(s) is connected to the hub. The network arrangement and communication channel of the present invention facilitates a multi-level measurement and monitoring to detect, monitor and report any pilferage at any stage of the power supply distribution. For example differences in wattage can be measured at nodal center-1 or nodal center-2 and also at hub-1 or hub-2 (Fig 1). Unauthorized opening of the meter can be sensed and reported accordingly. At each level the energy supplied is measured and compared taking into account the losses (e.g. technical losses such as transmission, substation and distribution losses) at various stages. For example, a nodal center compares the summation of wattage of all the connected pre-paid meters to its own wattage (wattage available) to determine the difference. It is reported to the concerned authority if this difference is more than a predefined limit.<br>
In addition, the energy monitoring system of the present invention comprises one or more pre-paid energy meter(s) with features such as alarming in case of<br><br><br>

The benefits, advantages, solutions to problems, and any element(s) that may cause any benefit, advantage, or solution to occur or become more pronounced are not to be construed as a critical, required, or essential features or elements of any or all the claims. The invention is defined solely by the appended claims including any amendments made during the pendency of this application and all equivalents of those claims as issued.<br><br>
Block Diagram Explanation:<br>
1.	CT (Current Transformer): This is connected in series with power cable to measure the line current. This section is useful for power consumption measurement &amp; overloading detection.<br>
2.	A/D Converter: It converts the analog signals sensed by CT into digital form. ADC0804 is used as A/D converter. Micro controller reads this data &amp; processes it for power measurement &amp; overload detection.<br>
3.	Micro-Controller: This is the heart of the circuit, which controls all the devices (Blocks) connected to it. Controller 89C51 is used for this purpose.<br>
4.	BCD to LCD Decoder: It supports the LCD Display unit by converting the binary data into a suitable form to be used by LCD Display.<br>
5.	LCD Display: This is the basic Numeric display used to Display various readings<br>
and messages.<br>
5.	LED's: To show various conditions &amp; warnings. Every LED is predefined to show the particular condition.<br>
6.	Speaker: A common speaker is shared for multiple use like unauthorized opening, meter running under reserve amount, over consumption of power during power rationing schedule etc.<br>
7.	Tripping Unit: - It is used to disconnect the supply subject to the pre-defined conditions. A relay is used to support this function.<br>
8.	Ext I/P: In order to reduce the over all cost the system has been designed to<br>
accommodate the existing meter for taking the analog signals.<br>
9.	Amplifier: - It boosts the power capacity of the signals coming from micro-<br>
controller up to required level necessary to operate the FSK modulator. This stage uses the simple transistorized Amp.<br>
10.	FSK Modulator: to modulate the information, required to be used in power line<br>
carrier communication.<br>
11.	Power Amplifier: The O/P of VCO have very low power capacity hence it can<br>
•   not travel for a longer distance over power line. A power Amplifier is used to<br>
boost the power of the signal.<br>
12.	Coupler: - On power line there is already a 50Hz 230V AC signal available, so it is not possible to connect the power Amplifier directly to power line, because this much high voltage will damage compete circuit. Hence a coupler section is used to block the mains and couple the FSK signals in power line.<br>
13.	BPF: - After coupler (at receiver side) a BPF is used, which attenuates the unwanted signals &amp; passes only required FSK signals to FSK demodulator. A LC circuit for band pass filtration is use for this purpose.<br><br>
14.	FSK Demodulator: - To retrieve the information from FSK signals a PLL is used, which converts back the modulated signal into binary signals, required to be processed by the micro-controller.<br>
15.	TTL to RS232: - As the serial port of PC follows RS232 standard, Level converters are required to make it compatible.<br>
The first level converter converts the TTL signals into RS232 signals, and second level converter converts back the RS232 signals to TTL signals.<br><br>
