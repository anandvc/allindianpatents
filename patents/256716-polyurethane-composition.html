POLYURETHANE COMPOSITION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to compositions comprising<br>
specific high molecular weight polyurethane prepolymers<br>
prepared starting from specific predominantly linear<br>
long-chain polyoxyalkylene polyols with a low degree of<br>
unsaturation and polyaldimines.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Polyurethanes are used as, among other things, one-<br>
component, moisture-curing, elastic sealants, adhesives<br>
and coatings. Usually they comprise a polyurethane<br>
prepolymer, prepared from polyols and polyisocyanates<br>
in a stoichiometric excess, which is subsequently<br>
combined with further components and stored in the<br>
absence of moisture until its use. These conventional<br>
systems have a number of disadvantages. The reaction of<br>
the isocyanate groups, as a result of the reaction with<br>
water, from the air for example (atmospheric humidity),<br>
produces a certain amount of CO2 gas, depending on the<br>
isocyanate content of the mixture. Depending on<br>
formulation and application conditions, the CO2 gas<br>
formed can lead to bubbles in the cured product. This<br>
unwanted formation of bubbles is promoted by a number<br>
of factors, specifically a high level of isocyanate<br>
groups in the composition, a relatively low viscosity,<br>
a rapid curing rate, and a porous substrate. A further<br>
disadvantage is the relatively narrow limitation of the<br>
mechanical strengths which are achieved with such one-<br>
component compositions after their curing. On the one<br>
hand the mechanical strengths which are achievable with<br>
a particular prepolymer per se are limited. For a<br>
marked alteration of the mechanical values upward or<br>
downward it is necessary in each case to use a separate<br>
prepolymer formulated specifically for those desired<br><br>
mechanical properties. On the other hand, in the<br>
formulation of compositions having maximum strengths,<br>
there is an additional limitation owing to the bubbles<br>
problem and high viscosities. The prepolymers required<br>
to achieve high strengths either have very high<br>
viscosities, as a result of high functionality<br>
(markedly higher than 2) or as a result of preliminary<br>
chain linkage on the part of relatively short-chain<br>
diols, by means of diisocyanates, to form longer-chain<br>
(and the resultant high concentrations of urethane<br>
groups), these very high viscosities severely hampering<br>
their processing, or they contain high fractions of<br>
free isocyanate groups, as a result of which they have<br>
a very strong tendency to form bubbles on curing, or a<br>
combination of both. Very high tensile strengths, in<br>
the region of 10 MPa or more for example, are therefore<br>
virtually impossible to achieve in a manner suitable<br>
for practice with one-component moisture-curing<br>
polyurethanes with the present state of the art.<br>
A further disadvantage exists in connection with the<br>
use of polyurethanes as flexible construction sealants,<br>
which are used for sealing joints in the construction<br>
industry. A sealant of this kind must on the one hand<br>
have a very low elasticity modulus and at the same time<br>
high elongation and good resilience. Such products<br>
according to the state of the art normally have a very<br>
tacky surface, which tends toward unattractive soiling.<br>
As an alternative there are two-component systems, but<br>
they have the known disadvantage of the mixing<br>
operation, which represents not only additional effort<br>
for the user but also a source of error which is not to<br>
be underestimated in connection with the application of<br>
the product.<br>
Polyols usually used for preparing polyurethane<br>
prepolymers for very flexible compositions are<br><br>
polyoxyalkylene polyols, principally polypropylene<br>
glycols. Usually these polyols are prepared by base<br>
catalysis. The base-catalyzed polymerization process<br>
results, however, in polyols having a relatively high<br>
fraction of mono-hydroxy-functional molecules, referred<br>
to as monools, which carry a double bond at one chain<br>
end. As the molecular weight of the polyol increases,<br>
there is a sharp rise in the monool content and hence<br>
in the degree of unsaturation. When linear polyols are<br>
used a low OH functionality (i.e., markedly below the<br>
ideal value of 2) , in other words a high degree of<br>
unsaturation, leads to poor mechanical properties in<br>
the cured state. On the basis of polyols prepared by<br>
base catalysis, therefore, the achievement of high<br>
molecular weights in polyurethane prepolymers is<br>
possible only as a result of the joining of relatively<br>
short-chain diols by means of polyisocyanates, leading<br>
to prepolymers having undesiredly high viscosities.<br>
Special polyoxyalkylene polyols having a high molecular<br>
weight and a very low degree of unsaturation, prepared<br>
by means of what are called double metal cyanide<br>
complex catalysts, DMC catalysts for short, were<br>
developed in the 1960s and described in US 3,427,256,<br>
US 3,427,334, US 3,427,335, US 3,829,505 and<br>
US 3,941,849. These polyols have a very low degree of<br>
unsaturation and also an OH functionality of only a<br>
little less than 2.<br>
Since that time the technology of DMC catalysis has<br>
been continually improved and corresponding products<br>
have been commercialized. Patents WO 99/29752,<br>
US 5,849,944 and US 6,036,879, for example, describe<br>
applications of such polyols as two-component casting<br>
elastomers.<br>
It is possible by using these specific polyols in one-<br>
component, moisture-curing, elastic sealants and<br><br>
adhesives to prepare high molecular weight polyurethane<br>
prepolymers having a low viscosity. However, there are<br>
other difficulties which it has not proved possible to<br>
solve to satisfaction to date. Thus high molecular<br>
weight prepolymers, synthesized on the basis of the<br>
high molecular weight polyols mentioned, are indeed low<br>
in viscosity in comparison to corresponding high<br>
molecular weight prepolymers in which relatively short-<br>
chain polyols have been joined to diisocyanates to form<br>
longer chains; however, they are also substantially<br>
more hydrophobic, owing to the lower concentration of<br>
urethane groups. A result of this is that these more<br>
hydrophobic prepolymers cure much more slowly with<br>
moisture, since the water is available only in a small<br>
amount, and, on the other hand, that the susceptibility<br>
to bubble formation is higher, owing to the CO2 gas<br>
which is given off in the course of curing with<br>
moisture, since said gas is dissolved much less<br>
effectively by the more hydrophobic polymer. An<br>
adhesive suitable for industrial applications is<br>
required, however, to cure rapidly, and to do so<br>
generally with only a small free surface area available<br>
for absorbing the required water from the air. In order<br>
to achieve the high mechanical strengths which are<br>
often required, moreover, there is a need for a high<br>
isocyanate content. This produces a relatively large<br>
amount of CO2 on curing, which, as already described,<br>
leads to the problem of bubble formation in the course<br>
of curing.<br>
US 5,124,425 describes the use of such polyols,<br>
prepared by means of DMC catalysis, among other things<br>
as one-component moisture-curing or two-component<br>
polyurethanes. In the examples tensile strengths up to<br>
1.7 MPa are attained. Strengths much higher than this<br>
cannot be achieved in the method described, since the<br>
problem of bubble formation with relatively high<br>
isocyanate group contents has not been solved.<br><br>
In order to avoid the formation of bubbles in one-<br>
component polyurethane sealants and adhesives there are<br>
a variety of possibilities. On the one hand some or all<br>
of the isocyanate end groups of the prepolymer can be<br>
converted to alkoxysilane end groups by reacting them<br>
with, for example, an aminoalkyl-alkoxysilane. This<br>
produces an alkoxysilane-terminal prepolymer, which<br>
likewise cures by contact with moisture via hydrolysis<br>
of the alkoxysilane groups and subsequent condensation<br>
of the silanol groups to form siloxane moieties. This<br>
curing mechanism does not form CO2, and accordingly<br>
there are fewer bubbles formed, or none. Crosslinking<br>
via alkoxysilane groups does, however, lead to products<br>
having a low breaking elongation and low strengths.<br>
EP 1 093 482 describes polyurethanes based on polyols<br>
of high molecular weight, with a narrow molar weight<br>
distribution and an OH functionality in the vicinity of<br>
2. In order to avoid bubbles it is possible for some or<br>
all of the isocyanate end groups of the prepolymer to<br>
be reacted with organosilanes such as aminoalkyl-<br>
alkoxysilanes, for example. As already mentioned, it is<br>
not possible in this way to formulate polyurethanes<br>
having high elongations and strengths. Accordingly the<br>
sole example of that patent, a system which cures<br>
predominantly by way of alkoxysilanes, has a tensile<br>
strength of only 0.49 MPa with a breaking elongation of<br>
276%.<br>
Polyaldimines are compounds which are known in<br>
polyurethane chemistry, described for example in<br>
US 3,420,800 and US 3,567,692. From polyurethane<br>
prepolymers containing isocyanate groups and from<br>
polyaldimines it is possible to formulate one-component<br>
products. On contact with moisture the polyaldimines<br>
hydrolyze to form the corresponding aldehydes and<br>
polyamines, whereupon the latter react with the<br>
isocyanate groups of the prepolymer and hence cure it<br>
without release of CO2. Systems of this kind have been<br><br>
described for example in US 3,932,357, US 4,009,307,<br>
US 4,720,535, US 4,853,454, US 5,087,661 and<br>
EP 985 693.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
It was an object of the present invention to provide<br>
compositions which, starting from only one or a few<br>
high molecular weight polyurethane prepolymers, cover a<br>
large spectrum of mechanical strengths, and which have<br>
additional advantages over the prior art. Thus on the<br>
one hand the desire is for products which combine a low<br>
elasticity modulus, high elongation and good resilience<br>
with a very dry surface and are therefore suitable as<br>
construction sealants for the sealing of joints; on the<br>
other hand there is a need for highly flexible products<br>
which cure quickly and without bubbles, have high to<br>
very high mechanical strengths and are therefore<br>
suitable as adhesives for all kinds of industrial<br>
applications. These compositions ought at the same time<br>
to have a very low processing viscosity, thereby<br>
allowing the formulation of products which can be<br>
applied with relatively little force applied, which<br>
exhibit short string rupture on application (so that<br>
the surroundings are not soiled with the product when<br>
the application tip is placed down and drawn away), and<br>
contain a small amount or none at all of solvents and<br>
plasticizers, which is advantageous not only for the<br>
adhesion properties of the product but also from<br>
environmental standpoints, since not only the solvents<br>
(VOCs = volatile organic compounds) but also the<br>
plasticizers, generally phthalate compounds, are not<br>
unproblematic for the environment. Furthermore, any<br>
plasticizers present tend to migrate from the<br>
composition when applied to porous substrates such as<br>
natural stone slabs and when overcoated with paints. As<br>
a result it is possible, for example, for unattractive<br>
discolorations of the substrate to appear alongside a<br><br>
joint, or a coating becomes soft and tacky.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that these problems can<br>
be solved through the combination of specific, linear<br>
polyurethane prepolymers A of high molecular weight,<br>
prepared starting from specific, predominantly long-<br>
chain polyoxyalkylene polyols having a low degree of<br>
unsaturation, with polyaldimines B.<br>
With the combination described here of specific, high<br>
molecular weight polyurethane prepolymer prepared<br>
starting from specific linear, long-chain polyoxy-<br>
alkylene polyols with a low degree of unsaturation and polyaldimines it is possible, by varying and combining<br>
different polyaldimines with only a few prepolymers, to<br>
formulate different highly flexible products having a<br>
very broad spectrum of mechanical strength (tensile<br>
strength, for example, in the range from approximately<br>
1 to more than 20 MPa) and having breaking elongations<br>
of up to more than 1000%, these products being stable<br>
on storage in appropriate packaging in the absence of<br>
moisture, having a low processing viscosity, curing<br>
rapidly and without bubbles on contact with moisture,<br>
and having a very dry surface in the cured state.<br>
Using compositions of this kind it is possible to<br>
achieve significant reductions in the number of<br>
prepolymers required in a production operation for the<br>
formulation of different polyurethane sealants,<br>
adhesives and coatings which satisfy extremely<br>
different requirements in respect of the profile of<br>
mechanical properties. Since the handling and the<br>
storage of different prepolymers, with their high<br>
viscosity, their sensitivity to moisture and the space<br>
they occupy, is associated with high cost and<br>
inconvenience for an industrial production operation,<br>
the reduction in the number of required prepolymers for<br>
preparing different products is of great advantage and<br><br>
constitutes progress in the technology. Moreover, using<br>
such compositions it is possible, with a minimum set of<br>
prepolymers, to formulate not only flexible<br>
construction sealants featuring high elongation and<br>
good resilience and a very dry surface but also to<br>
prepare high-strength elastic adhesives having tensile<br>
strengths of up to 20 MPa or more which cure rapidly<br>
and without bubbles. The consistently low viscosity of<br>
such compositions makes it possible, furthermore, to<br>
prepare low-solvent and low-plasticizer or solvent-free<br>
and plasticizer-free products which have good<br>
processing properties, which is an advantage in respect<br>
of their adhesion properties, their migration stability<br>
and from environmental standpoints.<br>
An additional advantage over the prior art is that the<br>
cured compositions described are more hydrophobic than<br>
those based on conventional polyols. Consequently they<br>
exhibit less unwanted water absorption, hence in turn<br>
less swelling and a lower sensitivity to hydrolysis.<br>
Furthermore it is possible in accordance with one<br>
preferred embodiment of compositions to dispense<br>
entirely with the use of organometallic catalysts,<br>
especially tin catalysts. This results in higher<br>
thermal stabilities of the cured material as a result<br>
of slower reformation of urethane; and additionally<br>
this is an environmental advantage, in view of the<br>
potential toxicity and environmental hazard posed by<br>
the metals, particularly the organotin compounds.<br>
The present invention relates to compositions which<br>
comprise at least one polyurethane prepolymer A having<br>
isocyanate end groups and at least one polyaldimine B,<br>
the polyurethane prepolymer A being prepared from at<br>
least one polyol A1 and if desired at least one<br>
polyol A2 and also polyisocyanates. The polyol A1 is a<br>
linear polyoxyalkylene polyol and has a degree of<br><br>
unsaturation of 
present in an amount of 0-30% by weight, preferably<br>
0-20% by weight, in particular 0-10% by weight, based<br>
on the total amount of A1 + A2. In addition to the<br>
components mentioned a composition can according to one<br>
preferred embodiment further comprise one or more of<br>
the following components: plasticizers, solvents,<br>
fillers, pigments, catalysts, rheology modifiers such<br>
as thickeners, for example, adhesion promoters, driers,<br>
antioxidants, light stabilizers and other additives<br>
customary in the polyurethane industry.<br>
Described in addition is the use of this composition as<br>
an adhesive, sealant, coating or covering. Further<br>
provided are processes for preparing the composition<br>
and also processes for bonding, sealing or coating.<br>
Described finally are articles whose surface has been<br>
contacted at least partly with such a composition.<br>
Way of implementing the invention<br>
The present invention relates to compositions which<br>
comprise at least one polyurethane prepolymer A having<br>
isocyanate end groups and at least one polyaldimine B,<br>
the polyurethane prepolymer A being prepared from at<br>
least one polyol A1 and if desired at least one<br>
polyol A2 and also polyisocyanates. The polyol A1 is a<br>
linear polyoxyalkylene polyol and has a degree of<br>
unsaturation of 
present in an amount of 0-30% by weight, preferably<br>
0-20% by weight, in particular 0-10% by weight, based<br>
on the total amount of A1 + A2.<br>
The polyurethane prepolymer A is prepared by reacting<br>
the polyol with a polyisocyanate, the polyol being<br>
composed of at least 70% by weight, preferably at least<br>
80% by weight, of at least one linear polyol A1. This<br>
reaction can take place by reacting the polyol and the<br><br>
polyisocyanate by customary processes, at temperatures<br>
of from 50 to 100°C for example, with or without the<br>
use of suitable catalysts, the polyisocyanate being<br>
used in a stoichiometric excess. The reaction product<br>
formed is the polyurethane prepolymer A having<br>
isocyanate end groups.<br>
The polyol A1 is a linear polyoxyalkylene polyol having<br>
a total degree of unsaturation of 
preferably 

polyol A1 has a molecular weight of from 2000 to<br>
30 000 g/mol.	<br>
These linear polyoxyalkylene polyols are reaction<br>
products of a difunctional starter molecule in the form<br>
of a short diol with alkylene oxides such as<br>
1,2-propylene oxide or ethylene oxide, it being<br>
possible to use the alkylene oxides individually,<br>
alternately in succession or as mixtures. The<br>
polymerization catalyst used is normally what is called<br>
a double metal cyanide complex, DMC catalyst for short. Polyols of this kind are available commercially for<br>
example under the names Acclaim® and Arcol® from Bayer,<br>
Preminol® from Asahi Glass, Alcupol® from Repsol and<br>
Poly-L® from Arch Chemicals. As a result of the use of<br>
a DMC catalyst during their preparation they have a<br>
very low degree of unsaturation. This means that the<br>
amount in these polyols of polyoxypropylenes which<br>
carry as end groups a double bond at one chain end and<br>
an OH group at the other chain end ("monools") is very<br>
low. Monools come about as a result of isomerization of<br>
propylene oxide to allyl alcohol during the<br>
propoxylation, leading to the formation of allyl-<br>
terminated polyoxypropylenes. The degree of<br>
unsaturation is measured in accordance with<br>
ASTM D-2849-69, "testing urethane foam polyol raw<br>
materials", and reported as milliequivalents of<br><br>
unsaturation per gram of polyol (meq/g) . The total<br>
degree of unsaturation (meq/g) of these polyols<br>
corresponds to the monool content. From the average<br>
molecular weight (or alternatively with the total OH<br>
content) and the total degree of unsaturation it is<br>
possible to calculate the average OH functionality "of<br>
the polyol. Preferred polyols are pure polyoxypropylene<br>
diols and also "EO-endcapped" (ethylene oxide-encapped)<br>
polyoxypropylene diols. The latter are special<br>
polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene diols which are<br>
obtained by alkoxylating pure polyoxypropylene diols<br>
with ethylene oxide after the end of the<br>
polypropoxylation, and which therefore contain primary<br>
hydroxyl groups. Mixtures of said polyols can also be<br>
used.<br>
The remaining 0 to 30% by weight of the polyol is<br>
accounted for by the polyols A2 below, which are very<br>
well known in polyurethane chemistry and are not of the<br>
same type as the polyol Al:<br>
-	polyoxyalkylene polyols having a total degree of<br>
unsaturation of more than 0.04 meq/g and/or a low<br>
molecular weight and/or an OH functionality of greater<br>
than 2, particularly those having a total degree of<br>
unsaturation 
from 400 to 2000 and/or those having an OH<br>
functionality of more than 2 and up to about 3, which<br>
are products of the polyalkoxylation of a starter<br>
molecule with ethylene oxide, 1,2-propylene oxide, 1,2-<br>
and 2,3-butylene oxide, tetrahydrofuran or mixtures<br>
thereof;<br>
-	polyhydroxy-terminated polybutadiene polyols;<br>
-	polyester polyols, prepared for example from dihydric<br>
to trihydric alcohols such as 1,2-ethanediol,<br>
diethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, dipropylene glycol,<br><br>
1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol,<br>
neopentyl glycol, glycerol, 1,1,1-trimethylolpropane or<br>
mixtures of the aforementioned alcohols with organic<br>
dicarboxylic acids or their anhydrides or esters such<br>
as succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, suberic<br>
acid, sebacic acid, decanedicarboxylic acid, maleic<br>
acid, fumaric acid, phthalic acid, isophthalic acid,<br>
terephthalic acid and hexahydrophthalic acid or<br>
mixtures of the aforementioned acids, for example, and<br>
also polyester polyols formed from lactones,<br>
ε-caprolactone for example;<br>
-	polycarbonate polyols, such as are obtainable by<br>
reacting, for example, the abovementioned alcohols - those used to synthesize the polyester polyols - with<br>
dialkyl carbonates, diaryl carbonates or phosgene;<br>

To prepare the polyurethane prepolymer, polyisocyanates<br>
are used. Preferred polyisocyanates are diisocyanates.<br>
Examples that may be mentioned include the following<br>
isocyanates, which are very well known in polyurethane<br>
chemistry:<br>
2,4- and 2,6-tolylene diisocyanate (TDI) and any<br><br>
mixtures of these isomers, 4,4'-diphenylmethane<br>
diisocyanate (MDI), the positionally isomeric<br>
diphenylmethane diisocyanates and also oligomers and<br>
polymers of these isocyanates, 1,3- and 1,4-phenylene<br>
diisocyanate, 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate, 2,2,4-<br>
and 2,4,4-trimethyl-1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate,<br>

isomers, l-isocyanato-3,3,5-trimethyl-5-isocyanato-<br>

perhydro-2,4'- and -4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate,<br>
1,3- and 1,4-tetramethylxylylene diisocyanate, and any<br>
desired mixtures of the aforementioned isocyanates.<br>
The polyaldimines B are prepared on the basis of<br>
polyamines and aldehydes by means of a condensation<br>
reaction with elimination of water. Such condensation<br>
reactions are very well known and are described, for<br>
example, in Houben-Weyl, "Methoden der organischen<br>
Chemie", Vol. XI/2, page 73 ff. Equivalent amounts of<br>
aldehyde groups R1_CH=0 are reacted with primary amino<br>
groups R2-NH2 to form aldimine moieties R1_CH=N-R2. R1<br>
and R2 are for example an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or<br>
aromatic radical which may contain, for example, ester<br>
moieties, carboxylic acid moieties, ether moieties and<br>
heteroatoms and also further imino groups. R1 and R2<br>
are, for example, the radicals of the polyamines (R2)<br>
or aldehydes (R1), respectively, recited later on<br>
below.<br>
As polyaldimine B it is also possible to use mixtures<br>
of different polyaldimines, especially mixtures of<br>
different polyaldimines prepared by means of different<br>
polyamines, reacted with different or the same<br>
aldehydes, including in particular polyaldimines<br>
prepared by means of polyamines having different amino<br>
functionalities.<br><br>
Suitable polyamines include polyamines which are very<br>
well known in polyurethane chemistry, such as are used,<br>
among other things, for two-component polyurethanes.<br>

1,4-bis(aminomethyl)cyclohexane, 1-cyclohexylamino-<br>

(TCD-Diamin®, prepared by Celanese Chemicals), 3,9-bis-<br>
(3-aminopropyl)-2,4,8,10-tetraoxaspiro[5.5]undecane,<br>
1,3- and 1,4-xylylenediamine, aliphatic polyamines<br>
containing ether groups, such as bis(2-aminoethyl)-<br>
ether, 4,7-dioxadecanε-1,10-diamine, 4,9-dioxadodecanε-<br>
1,12-diamine and higher oligomers thereof,<br>
polyoxyalkylenε-polyamines having an amino func-<br>
tionality of 2. or 3 theoretically, obtainable under the<br>
name Jeffamine®, prepared by Huntsman Chemicals, and<br>
also mixtures of the aforementioned polyamines.<br><br>
Preferred polyamines are 1, 6-hexamethylenediamine,<br>
l,5-diamino-2-methylpentane, DAMP, IPDA, 4-aminomethyl-<br>
1,8-octanediamine, 1,3-xylylenediamine, 1,3-bis-<br>

Jeffamine® D-230, Jeffamine® D-400 and Jeffamine®<br>
T-403, and in particular mixtures of two or more of the<br>
aforementioned polyamines.<br>
Suitable aldehydes for the condensation reaction with<br>
the polyamines include for example the following:<br>
aliphatic or cycloaliphatic aldehydes such as propanal,<br>
pivalaldehyde (= trimethylacetaldehyde), isobutyr-<br>
aldehyde, hexanal, 2-ethylhexanal, 2-methylbutanal,<br>
2-ethylbutanal, octylaldehyde, valeraldehyde, isovaler-<br>
aldehyde, 2-methylvaleraldehyde, 2,3-dimethylvaler-<br>
aldehyde, 2-methylundecanal, cyclohexylcarboxaldehyde,<br>
methoxyacetaldehyde, 2-alkoxy-2-methylpropanals such as<br>
2-methoxy-2-methylpropanal, for example, esters of<br>
organic carboxylic acids and 2-hydroxy-<br>
2-methylpropanal, such as 2-acetoxyisobutyraldehyde,<br>
for example, 3-alkoxy-2,2-dimethylpropanals such as<br>
3-n-butoxy-2,2-dimethylpropanal, for example, esters of<br>
2,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypropanal and short-chain organic<br>
carboxylic acids, such as 2,2-dimethyl-3-acetyloxy-<br>
propanal and 2,2-dimethyl-3-isobutyroxypropanal, for<br>
example, cyclopropanecarboxaldehyde, 9-ethyl-<br>
3-carbazolecarboxaldehyde,	10-methylanthracenε-<br>
9-carboxaldehyde, pyrenecarboxaldehyde, benzaldehyde,<br>
o-, m- and p-tolylaldehyde, 2- and 4-methylbenz-<br>
aldehyde, 2- and 4-ethylbenzaldehyde, 2- and<br>
4-propylbenzaldehyde, 2- and 4-butylbenzaldehyde,<br>
2,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde, 2,4,5-trimethylbenzaldehyde,<br>
p-anisaldehyde, 3-methyl-p-anisaldehyde, m- and p-<br>
ethoxybenzaldehyde, m- and p-phenoxybenzaldehyde,<br>
nicotinaldehyde, terephthaldehyde, isophthaldehyde and<br><br>
diphenylacetaldehyde, and also mixtures of the<br>
aforementioned aldehydes.<br>
For use with the highly reactive aromatic isocyanates<br>
such as TDI and MDI, for example, preference is given<br>
to those aldehydes which are unable to form tautomeric<br>
enols. With polyaldimines starting from such non-<br>
tautomerizing aldehydes it is possible with prepolymers<br>
starting from aromatic polyisocyanates to formulate<br>
compositions which are particularly stable on storage.<br>
Aldehydes which are unable to form tautomeric enols are<br>
those which do not contain a C-H moiety positioned a to<br>
the carbonyl group. This applies to aromatic aldehydes<br>
and also to aliphatic aldehydes having a tertiary<br>
carbon atom positioned a to the carbonyl group.<br>
Particularly preferred aldehydes are benzaldehyde,<br>
m-phenoxybenzaldehyde, isophthalaldehyde, terephthal-<br>
aldehyde; additionally pivalaldehyde and also esters of<br>
2,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypropanal and short-chain organic<br>
carboxylic acids, such as 2,2-dimethyl-3-acetyloxy-<br>
propanal and 2,2-dimethyl-3-isobutyroxypropanal, for<br>
example.<br>
The polyurethane prepolymer A and the polyaldimine B<br>
are mixed with one another, the polyaldimine B being<br>
metered in an amount from 0.1 to 1.1 equivalents of<br>
aldimine moieties per equivalent of isocyanate groups<br>
of the prepolymer A. Additionally it is possible to add<br>
a catalyst for the hydrolysis of the polyaldimine, an<br>
example being an organic carboxylic acid such as<br>
benzoic acid or salicylic acid, an organic carboxylic<br>
anhydride such as phthalic anhydride or hexahydro-<br>
phthalic anhydride, a silyl ester of organic carboxylic<br>
acids, an organic sulfonic acid such as<br>
p-toluenesulfonic acid, or another organic or inorganic<br>
acid, or mixtures of the aforementioned acids.<br><br>
By varying the polyaldimine B in combination with a<br>
polyurethane prepolymer A it is possible to formulate<br>
products having very different mechanical properties.<br>
Polyaldimines which lead to products having particular<br>
flexibility properties are for example those based on<br>
Jeffamine® grades or 1,5-diamino-2-methylpentane.<br>
Polyaldimines leading to products having particularly<br>
high strengths are for example those based on<br>
1,6-hexamethylenediamine or 1,3-xylylenediamine,<br>
optionally in admixture with amines of higher<br>
functionality, such as 4-aminomethyl-1,8-octanediamine<br>
or Jeffamine® T-403, for example. Through the correct<br>
selection of the polyaldimine B, optionally in the form<br>
of a mixture of different polyaldimines, in combination<br>
with the polyurethane prepolymers A described it is<br>
possible to adjust the mechanical properties in the<br>
cured state of the high molecular weight compositions<br>
in accordance with what is desired: for example, to~<br>
breaking elongations up to more than 1000% and tensile<br>
strengths from approximately 1 MPa to 20 MPa.<br>
As a result of the possibility of varying the<br>
polyaldimine B and of the use of the specific high<br>
molecular weight polyurethane prepolymers A it is<br>
possible to reduce significantly the number of<br>
prepolymers required in a production operation for<br>
formulating different polyurethane sealants, adhesives<br>
and coatings, and also coverings, especially floor<br>
coverings, which meet very different requirements in<br>
respect of the profile of mechanical properties. Since<br>
the handling and the storage of different prepolymers<br>
is associated with great cost and inconvenience for an<br>
industrial production operation, in view of their<br>
viscosity, their sensitivity to moisture and the space<br>
they occupy, reducing the number of prepolymers<br>
required for preparing different products is<br>
advantageous. Moreover it is possible with such<br>
compositions to formulate not only flexible construε-<br><br>
tion sealants having a very dry surface but also high-<br>
strength elastic adhesives having tensile strengths of<br>
up to 20 MPa or more, which have a low processing<br>
viscosity and cure rapidly and without bubbles.<br>
Additional components that may be present in the<br>
compositions described include, among others, the<br>
following components well known in the polyurethane<br>
industry:<br>
plasticizers, examples being esters of organic<br>
carboxylic acids or their anhydrides, phthalates, such<br>
as dioctyl phthalate or diisodecyl phthalate, adipates,<br>
such as dioctyl adipate, organic sulfonic esters,<br>
polybutenes and other compounds which do not react with<br>
isocyanates; solvents, organic and inorganic fillers,<br>
such as calcium carbonates, alternatively precipitated<br>
calcium carbonates uncoated or coated with stearates,<br>
or carbon blacks, kaolins, aluminas, silicas, PVC<br>
powders, fibers, of polyethylene for example, pigments,<br>
catalysts for the hydrolysis of the polyaldimine,<br>
organic carboxylic acids, such as benzoic acid and<br>
salicyclic acid, organic carboxylic anhydrides, such as<br>
phthalic anhydride and hexahydrophthalic anhydride,<br>
silyl esters of organic carboxylic acids, organic<br>
sulfonic acids such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, or other<br>
organic or inorganic acids, further catalysts, examples<br>
being organotin compounds such as dibutyltin dilaurate,<br>
dibutyltin acetylacetonate or other catalysts customary<br>
in polyurethane chemistry for the reaction of<br>
isocyanate groups; rheology modifiers, such as<br>
thickeners, examples being urea compounds, polyamide<br>
waxes, bentonites or pyrogenic silicas, adhesion<br>
promoters, examples being epoxysilanes, vinylsilanes,<br>
isocyanatosilanes and aminosilanes reacted with<br>
aldehydes to form aldiminosilanes, driers, such as<br>
p-tosyl isocyanate and other reactive isocyanates,<br>
orthoformic esters, calcium oxide or molecular sieves,<br>
stabilizers against heat, light and UV radiation, flame<br><br>
retardants, surfacε-active substances, substances<br>
having a fungistatic action, and further substances<br>
commonly used in the polyurethane industry.<br>
The composition described is prepared and stored in the<br>
absence of moisture. Such compositions are stable on<br>
storage: that is, they can be kept in suitable<br>
packaging or in a suitable arrangement, such as in a<br>
drum, a pouch or a cartridge, for example, for a period<br>
ranging from several months up to a year or longer,<br>
prior to their use. On application the polyurethane<br>
composition comes into contact with moisture, whereupon<br>
the polyaldimines are hydrolyzed to aldehydes and<br>
polyamines and the polyamines react with the<br>
polyurethane prepolymer containing isocyanate groups.<br>
Either the water required for the reaction can come<br>
from the air (atmospheric humidity) or the composition<br>
can be contacted with a water-containing component, by<br>
being coated, for example, with a smoothing agent for<br>
example, by spraying or by means of immersion methods,<br>
or the composition can be admixed with a water-<br>
containing component, in the form for example of a<br>
hydrous paste, which can be metered in via a static<br>
mixer, for example.<br>
If a deficit amount of the polyaldimine is used, in<br>
other words if the chosen ratio of aldimine groups to<br>
isocyanate groups is substoichiometric, then the excess<br>
isocyanate groups react with the water present. As a<br>
consequence of the reactions described above the<br>
composition cures.<br>
The compositions described are suitable as sealants of<br>
all kinds, for the purpose for example of sealing<br>
joints in construction, as adhesives for the bonding of<br>
various substrates, such as for bonding components in<br>
the production of automobiles, rail vehicles or other<br>
industrial products, and as coatings or coverings for<br><br>
various articles and/or variable substrates. The<br>
composition is at least partly contacted with the<br>
surface of any desired substrate. Preferably a uniform<br>
contacting in the form of a sealant or adhesive, a<br>
coating or a covering is desired, and particularly in<br>
the areas which for the purpose of use require a bond<br>
in the form of an adhesive bond or seal or else whose<br>
substrate is to be covered over. It may well be<br>
necessary for the substrate, or the article in the<br>
foreground of contacting, to have to be subjected to a<br>
physical and/or chemical pretreatment, by abrading,<br>
sandblasting, brushing or the like, for example, or by<br>
treatment with cleaners, solvents, adhesion promoters,<br>
adhesion promoter solutions or primers, or the<br>
application of a tie coat or a sealer.<br>

Description of the test methods:<br>
The viscosity was measured at 23°C on a conε-and-plate<br>
viscometer from Haake (PK100/VT-500).<br>
The skinning time (time to freedom from tack, "tack-<br>
free time") was determined at 23°C and 50% relative<br>
humidity.<br><br>
Tensile strength, breaking elongation and elasticity<br>
modulus at 0.5-5% elongation were determined on films<br>
cured for 7 days at 23°C and 50% relative humidity in<br>
accordance with DIN EN 53504 (traction speed:<br>
200 mm/min).<br>
Formation of bubbles was assessed qualitatively on the<br>
basis of the quantity of bubbles which appeared in the<br>
course of curing (at 23oC and 50% relative humidity) of<br>
the films used for the mechanical tests (film<br>
thickness: 2 mm).<br>
The expression force was determined on aluminum<br>
cartridges having a diameter of 45 mm, the sealant<br>
being pressed at the tip of the cartridge through an<br>
opening of 3 mm. Expression was carried out by a<br>
tensile testing machine at a speed of 60 mm/min.<br>
String rupture was determined by causing a cylindrical<br>
penetration element with a diameter of 2 cm to<br>
penetrate to a depth of 0.5 cm into the sealant (film<br>
thickness: 1 cm, temperature: 20°C) and extracting it<br>
again after about 1 second at constant speed (25 cm in<br>
4 seconds). The length of the string of sealant<br>
remaining on the penetration element, defined as string<br>
rupture, was measured with a ruler to an accuracy of<br>
1 mm. The procedure was repeated three times and the<br>
mean value of the measurements was determined as the<br>
result.<br>
The surface of the cured sealant was assessed for tack<br>
by gentle contact with the finger.<br>
The rate of cure through volume was determined at 23oC<br>
and 50% relative humidity on a PTFE substrate.<br>
The stress at 100% elongation was tested in accordance<br><br>
with DIN EN 28340, method A.<br>

Examples 1-4 (inventive) and examples 5-6 (comparative)<br>
The prepolymers and aldimines indicated in table 1 were<br>
mixed homogeneously in an NH2/NCO ratio (i.e.,<br>
equivalents of aldimine moieties per equivalents of<br>
isocyanate groups of the prepolymer) of 0.9/1.0. The<br>
mixture was admixed with benzoic acid (350 mg/100 g of<br>
prepolymer) , mixed homogeneously again and immediately<br>
dispensed to airtight tubes, which were stored at 60°C<br>
for 15 hours. A portion of the mixture was then poured<br>
into a metal sheet coated with PTFE (film thickness:<br>
about 2 mm) , cured for 7 days at 23°C and 50% relative<br>
humidity, and subsequently the mechanical properties of<br>
the through-cured film were measured. With the remain-<br>
ing contents of the tube the storage stability was<br>
determined, by measurement of the viscosity before and<br>
after storage for 7 days at 60 °C. The results of the<br>
tests are set out in table 1.<br>
The results show that the inventive compositions of<br>
examples 1-4 (prepolymer based on a linear polyol with<br>
a low degree of unsaturation, cured with polyaldimine)<br>
have elasticity moduli and mechanical strengths which<br>
vary widely depending on the polyaldimine used, and<br>
also possess a very low viscosity, good storage<br>
stability and a high reactivity and cure with no<br>
bubbles. The prior art formulation of comparative<br>
example 5 (prepolymer based on a conventional linear<br>
polyol preextended with diisocyanate, cured with<br>
polyaldimine), in contrast, has a sharply increased<br>
viscosity and, when the same polyaldimine is used<br>
(ex. 5 as against ex. 4), exhibits a much lower tensile<br>
strength. The prior art formulation of comparative<br><br>
example 6 (prepolymer based on a linear polyol with a<br>
low degree of unsaturation, cured with atmospheric<br>
moisture) exhibits inadequate reactivity (slow skinning<br>
time) and a distinct tendency to form bubbles.<br><br>
Example 7 (inventive) and example 8 (comparative)<br>
In the same way as described in example 1 compositions<br>
were prepared from various prepolymers and aldimines<br>
and tested. The prepolymers and aldimines used and also<br>
the results of the tests are set out in table 2.<br><br>
The results show that the inventive composition of<br>
example 7 (linear polyol with low degree of unsatura-<br>
tion) has much higher tensile strength than the prior<br>
art formulation of comparative example 8 (conventional<br>
linear polyol), and achieves this with properties which<br>
are otherwise comparable.<br><br>
Examples 9, 12-14 (inventive) and examples 10, 11, 15,<br>
16 (comparative)<br>
In the same way as described in example 1 compositions<br>
were prepared from various prepolymers and aldimines<br>
and tested. The prepolymers and aldimines used and also<br>
the results of the tests are set out in table 3.<br>
The results show that the inventive compositions of<br>
examples 9 and 12-14 (prepolymer based on a linear<br>
polyol with a low degree of unsaturation, cured with<br>
polyaldimine mixture having a total functionality &gt; 2)<br>
have lower viscosities than the prior art formulations<br>
of comparative examples 10 and 15 (prepolymer with<br>
total functionality &gt; 2 based on a mixture of linear<br>
and nonlinear polyol, cured with polyaldimine having a<br><br>
total functionality of 2) (ex. 10 in comparison to<br>
ex. 9 and ex. 15 in comparison to ex. 14) . The prior<br>
art formulations of comparative examples 11 and 16<br>
(prepolymer with total functionality &gt; 2 based on a<br>
mixture of linear and nonlinear polyol, cured with<br>
atmospheric moisture) have inadequate reactivity in<br>
comparison to the other examples (slow skinning time)<br>
and also have a tendency to form bubbles.<br><br><br><br>
Example 17 (inventive) and example 18 (comparative)<br>
In the same way as described in example 1 compositions<br>
were prepared from various prepolymers and aldimines<br>
and tested. The prepolymers and aldimines used and also<br>
the results of the tests are set out in table 4.<br>
The results show that the inventive composition of<br>
example 17 (prepolymer based on a linear polyol having<br>
a low degree of unsaturation, cured with polyaldimine)<br>
has a very low viscosity, good mechanical properties<br>
and a high reactivity (rapid skinning time) and cures<br>
without bubbles. In contrast the prior art formulation<br>
of comparative example 18 (prepolymer based on a linear<br>
polyol having a low degree of unsaturation, cured with<br>
atmospheric moisture) exhibits inadequate reactivity<br>
and a tendency to form bubbles.<br><br>
Examples 19-20 (inventive) and example 21 (comparative)<br>
In the same way as described in example 1 compositions<br>
were prepared from various prepolymers and aldimines<br>
and tested. The prepolymers and aldimines used and also<br><br>
the results of the tests are set out in table 5.<br>
The results show that the inventive compositions of<br>
examples 19 and 20 (prepolymer based on a long-chain<br>
linear polyol with a low degree of unsaturation, cured<br>
with polyaldimine mixture with a total functionality of<br>
2 or &gt; 2, respectively) have good mechanical proper-<br>
ties, a high reactivity (short skinning time) and<br>
exhibit bubblε-free curing. Example 20, with a<br>
polyaldimine mixture of total functionality &gt; 2,<br>
exhibits a higher tensile strength as compared with<br>
example 19. The prior art formulation of comparative example 21 (prepolymer based on a long-chain linear<br>
polyol with a low degree of unsaturation, cured with<br>
atmospheric moisture) exhibits inadequate reactivity<br>
and a tendency to form bubbles as compared with the<br>
inventive examples 19 and 20. The storage stability of<br>
the three examples is good in each case (low increase<br>
in viscosity during storage).<br><br><br><br><br>
Examples 22-24, 26, 28, 30 (inventive) and examples 25,<br>
27, 29, 31 (comparative)<br>
In the same way as described in example 1 compositions<br>
were prepared from various prepolymers and aldimines<br>
and tested. The prepolymers used, differing in<br>
isocyanate content, and the aldimines and also the<br>
results of the tests are set out in table 6.<br>
The results show that the inventive compositions of<br>
examples 22-24 and 26, 28 and 30 (prepolymers based on<br>
a linear polyol with a low degree of unsaturation and a<br>
low molecular weight diol, cured with a polyaldimine or<br>
with a polyaldimine mixture with a total functionality<br>
of 2 or &gt; 2, respectively) have very good mechanical<br>
properties, which can be altered by varying the<br>
polyaldimine. The corresponding prepolymers were cured<br>
in the prior art formulations of comparative<br>
examples 25, 27, 29 and 31 using atmospheric moisture.<br>
The comparative examples exhibit a very much lower<br>
reactivity (long skinning time) and a strong tendency<br>
to form bubbles. The mechanical values for these<br>
examples cannot be sensibly measured, in view of the<br>
many bubbles.<br>
