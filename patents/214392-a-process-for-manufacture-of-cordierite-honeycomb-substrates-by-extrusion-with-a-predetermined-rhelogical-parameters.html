				<td>This invention relates to a process for manufacture of Cordierite honeycomb substrates by extrusion.<br>
The Cordierite ceramic honeycomb substrate is generally used but not limited in Catalytic Converter for vehicular pollution control throughout the world.<br>
The invention particularly relates to the scientific process of achieving the Rheological characteristics of the extrusion paste for continuous extrusion of honeycomb substrates.<br>
Till date/ the composition of the paste, which is generally known in the art/ do not disclose any method of arriving at the correct composition. It appears/ the present few manufacturers have developed this composition by trial and error or through their long experience to achieve the extrusion characteristic.<br>
It is known in the art that the honeycomb material is formed from an extrudable material by using a conventional honeycomb die/ where the material flows through a plurality of feed passageways delivering it directly to intersection portions of a gridwork of interconnected discharge slots.<br>
It is also known that pure Cordierite is having a chemical formulae of 2MgO.2Al2O3,5Si02 and  thus having 13.8% of MgO, 51.3% of SiO2 and 34.9% of A12O3. Thus the single-Phase pure Cordierite can be obtained by selecting the raw materials like clay ( major source of A12O3 &amp; SiO2), Talc (major source<br>
of MgO &amp; SiO2)/ silica/ magnesium aluminate/ magnesium carbonate/ pyrophilite/alumina etc. with respective proportions calculated from the individual chemical consti¬tuents of each raw materials.<br>
It is also known in the prior art that the above inorganic batch constituents may be mixed with the following organic constituents for their respective contributions to obtain the extrudable paste.<br>
For example* among organic binders such as methyl cellulose/ carboxy methyl cellulose/ hydroxyprophyl methyl cellulose/ polyvinyl alcohol/ starch/ wheat powder etc. among plasticizers and surface agents/ glycerin/ wax/ sodium stearate/ graphite etc. And many other materials such as activated charcoal/ starch powder/   sawdust and others may be used for achieving other properties of the honeycomb like pore formation and pore - size control.<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention is to provide an extrusion paste/ which is essential for honeycomb extrusion of reasonable quality and yield/ having favourable Rheological properties for consistent and repeatable honeycomb extrusion.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a process for preparation of Cordierite ceramic paste with the required Rheological parameters for successful honeycomb extrusion<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to manufacture of Cordierite honeycomb substrate of consistent<br>
quality and high yield by extrusion suitable for use in Catalytic Converter for automobiles using fossil fuel.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to achieve the required Rheological parameters by various composition* derived from the local source of minerals, plasticizers, binders, lubricants and synthetic materials.<br>
A still further object of the present invention invention is to improve the manufacturing process of ceramic honeycomb for more consistent and repeatable yield through utilizing sci ent 1 f it: i al ly formulated Rheological considerations.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of Cordierite honeycomb substrates by extrusion with s predetermined Rheological parameters as yield stress «3^ ), Die entry velocity sensitivity factor ( Of ), die entry exponent (m), shear stress

D r awba ck s_of_the_kn own_art;<br>
The characteristics of the extrusion paste suitable for ceramic honeycomb extrusion is never disclosed or revealed in the known art. The characteristics of an extrudable paste are those parameters which decides the paste flow through the honey¬comb extrusion dies under practical achievable force or pressure/ retain the thin walled intricate shapes immediately after extrusion/ flow laterally to join with each other to form monolithic structure. The characteristics of the extrudable paste may be similar to an SHEAR - THINNING liquid type as discussed in the rheological literature. However there is no disclosure or invention of the precise quantitative values of those characteristic para¬meters which are responsible for any successful ceramic honeycomb extrusion. In all of the known art so far patented or disclosed/ the paste for honeycomb extrusion is termed as "extrudable": and formulated using the binders and additives mentioned earlier for obtaining the suitable binding/ plasticising/ lubricating and other propoerties by trial-and-error method/. Thus there is a<br>
lack of definition of the required characteristics of the extrudable paste suitable of ceramic honeycomb extrusion.<br>
To achieve the identification of the Rheological parameters of the extrusion paste for the manufacture of the Cordierite ceramic honeycomb substrates by extrusion/ detailed studies of the honeycomb substrate extrusion behaviour with scientific and technological view points were undertaken. Numerous honeycomb extrusions are undertaken using the conventional plunger type extruder known in the art. During each extrusion cycle the Rheological parameters are measured by fitting the 6 - figure mathematical model and recorded with the corresponding honeycomb extrusion results. Thus the paste behaviour is quantified by fitting the model and the extent of fitting the curve is designated by Rl -square value. Through  a series of experimentation the range of values for each of the Rheological parameters constituting the 6-figure mathematical model were obtained which are required for the good honeycomb extrusion. The following embodiment gives an examples those values.<br>
Further/ , it   known to the people skilled in the art that the processing of the ceramic paste for extrusion is to be very precisely controlled to obtain good honeycomb extrusion. Sometimes/ even after very precise and careful control of processing/ the derived results,that is the defect free extrusion of honeycomb,is not achieved unless process conditions are changed or altered due to seasonal or other variations.<br>
For example/ if the temperature or humidity of the processing room is different then the fine powdered material while processing may absorb little more or less water which<br>
may change the total water content of the paste significantly altering the plasticity of the paste. Similarly there are<br>
many other factors like leftover waste in a cleaned machine/ frictional temperature rise of slightly over-worked mixing or extruding apparatus etc. may affect the workability of the extrudable paste considerably which are not normally be identified during mass production as an assignable cause.<br>
To overcome the above difficulty leading to fluctuations in the honeycomb extrudability of the extrusion paste/ a manufacturing process is further  invented for effectively implementing the required control/ which is the key of any successful honeycomb extrusion and is outlined in the Figure - 1. This process of operation when applied not only improves the yields of the extrusion but also gives more repeatable and assignable extrusion results removing the uncertainty of good or bad extrusion due to less direct control of the ultimate'extrudability of the paste. The<br>
invented manufacturing process is capable of exercising the fine control essential for consistent and repeatable honeycomb extrusion.<br>
The above mentioned process steps yield the successful honeycomb extrusion by maintaining the Rheological parameter values within the required level as found out by this invention and as stated earlier.<br>
The good honeycomb extrudate after the above  extrusion is dried uniformly using the available drying equipment. After being dried the honeycombs are fired in a furnace between 1350 C to 1420 C depending on the porosity and mechanical strength requirements.<br>
A single phase Cordierite is achieved by mixing the Cordierite forming batch formula of 39% Indian talc/ a total of 46% of different types of Indian clays and 15% alumina. After intensely mixing ( 2 of Fig. 1) these constituents/ the same batch is mixed ( 3 of Fig. 1) with 2% methyl cellulose/ 0.5% of glycerin/ 5% wheat powder and 21% of water in a closed gap Sigma blade mixer for 45 minutes. The<br>
mixed paste is then de-aired and extruded in the form of 1 inch dia bar for subsequent Rheological testing ( 4 of Fig.l). The bar is inserted in the barrel of the test fixture and the complete assembly is loaded in the Universal testing machine.<br>
A set of  4 mm dia cylindirical dies with different length-to-diameter ratios is assembled one  die at a time at one end of the barrel. Through the other end of the barrel a piston type ram is introduced after inserting the 1 Inch dia test blank of extrudable Cordierite paste. The ram is programmed to descend at different fixed velocities and during each velocity step the load experienced by the extrusion is recorded.<br>
The results of test is then analyzed by fitting a 6-figure model of the pressure prediction assuming there is a plug<br><br>
flow in the die. The mathematical equation of the 6-figure model used is described  later.<br>
The same paste is then parallely extruded through various conventional honeycomb dies available commercially. The results of the honeycomb extrusion is  noted indicating good or bad extrusion with respect to the required quality with reasonable yield. The results of a series of experiments shows that any successful honeycomb extrusion primarily depends on the specific values of the Rheological  parameters of the paste and such characteristics of the paste are defined, range of values are found out and claimed within the scope of this invention. The desirable values of  the Rheological parameters are described in this patent application and also described how to obtain the desired Rheological parameters for achieving Sucessfull and much improved honeycomb extrusion. The desired Rheological parameters are obtained by formulating a range of extrusion paste batch compositions by incorporating Indian clays, talc, alumina, quartz, pyrophillite with various grades of wheat powder, tapioca starch, methyl cellulose, glycerin, polyvinyl, alcohol, polyethylene glycol, stearic acid, stearic salts, graphite, charcoal and other binders, plasticizer, lubricants available for the above purpose of controlling the Rheological parameters.<br>
The 6-figure model utilized for the analysis is<br>
p-<br>
Where P is the total extrusion pressure (MPa), V is the extrusion velocity in mm,min and other 6 parameters are already<br><br>
explained earlier  ( in page 2).<br>
For good extrusion of honeycomb preferably upto 400 cells and wall thickness from 0.17 to 0.35 mm the Sigma  (Ob) values are obtained between 0.15 to 0.35 MPa more precisely<br>
between 0.16 to 0.23 MPa and Alfa  (d )  values between 0.001 - 0.07 MPa ( mm,min)   and ' m value not  above 0.40,<br>
Tow (To )  values between 0.001 - 0.002, Beta  ( ft )  values between 0.001 - 0.02 and  ' n'   values not greater than 0.45.<br>
The upper value of the Sigma (CTO) is not limited by the value 0. 35 MP a. It is also possible to extrude good honeycomb with Sigma ( )  more than 0.35 MP a provided the extruder and the die can be made extra strong to take the higher pressure requirement for higher Sigma (OL) value. If the value of Sigma (&amp;o)  is less than 0.15 MPa then the Cordierite honeycomb cannot be extruded and its monolithic honeycomb structure cannot be retained.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1.<br>
A single phase Cordierite is achieved by mixing the Cordierite forming batch formula of 39% Indian talc, a total of 46% of different types of Indian clays and 15% of alumina. After intensely mixing ( 2 of Fig. 1) these constituents, the same batch is mixed ( 3 of Fig. 1) with 2% methyl cellulose,<br>
0.5% of glycerin, 5% wheat powder and 21% of water in a closed gap Sigma blade mixer for 45 minutes. The mixed paste is then de - aired and extruded in the form of 1 Inch dia bar for<br>
subsequent Rheological testing ( 4 of fig. 1). The bar is inserted in the barrel of the test fixture and the complete assembly is loaded in the Universal testing machine.<br>
A set of 4 mm dia cylindirical die with different  length-to-diameter ratios is assembled one die at a time in one end of the barrel. Through the other end of the barrel a piston type ram is introduced after inserting the  I" dia test blank of extrudable Cordierite paste. The ram is programmed to descend at different fixed velocities and during each velocity step the load experienced by the extrusion is recorded.<br>
The results of test is then  analyzed by fitting a 6-figure model of the pressure prediction assuming there is plug flow in the die.<br>
Six Extrusion Parameters obtained  for this batch is as shown in Exp - 2 in Table - 1(Table Removed)<br><br>
This extrusion paste with the above mentioned values of rheological parameters yields successful honeycomb extrusion with very good quality and productivity. Whereas the other experiments with minor variations in binders and water quantity ( that is Exp. -I, Exp. -3 and Exp. -4) could not yield good honeycomb extrusion.<br>
The kneaded batch of Exp - 2 is pugmilled to obtain the de-aired blanks ( 7. of Fig-1), which are fed to the Hydraulic<br>
Extruder for honeycomb extrusion ( 8 of Fig. -1).The good honeycomb extrudates after the above extrusion of Exp - 2 are dried ( q of Fig - 1) uniformly using the drying equipment s available. After being dried the honey¬combs are fired ( 10 of Fig - 1) in a furnace between 1350°C to 1420°C  depending on the porosity and mechanical strength requirements. After firing the ends of the honeycombs are cut and ground parallel to obtain the finished Cordierite honeycomb product ( 11 of Fig. 1). The physical, mechanical and thermal properties of various honeycomb manufactured using the claimed method is given in Table 3.<br>
example 2.<br>
Cordierite batch is prepared as explained in Example-1. But for varying water content between 19% &amp; 22% and binder content between 2 &amp; 3 %. In addition 2 % Binder PVA is added. The batches thus prepared is tested and analyzed. The results are shown in Table 2. These batches are extruded through various honeycomb dies. Batches having CT values between 0.15 to 0.35 shows good extrusion of honeycomb &amp; retention of shape. Batches having (TQ value below 0.15 were not possible to extrude property due to die blockage. Body sticking to die and extruded honeycomb was slumpy and deforming. Therefore, batches with similar Rheological characteristics like Exp-5, Exp-9 and Exp - 7 yielded good honeycomb extrusion. With these batches the process described in Example-1 are followed which produced very good Cordieritie honeycomb finished products.<br>
The results of the various batches are tabulated in Figs. 2, 3 and 4 ( Tables I, 2 and 3).<br>
