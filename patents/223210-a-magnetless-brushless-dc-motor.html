				<td>Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a salient pole brushless DC motor. Background of the Inventions<br>
Wound field DC motors arc generally fitted with commutator and  brushes.  Due  to abrasive  action  between  commutator  and brushes   the brushes become the wearable parts of a  D.C.  motor and have to be replaced periodically. The same problem is faced by  the  D.C. motors using permanent magnets instead of wound field.<br>
In order to overcome the problem, brushless permanent  magnet type D.C. motors have been developed. In these motors a permanent magnet rotor and a wound stator is used.An electronic generator is used to  give  sequential pulses to the stator windings  to create a rotating  magnetic  field  which in turn  rotates  the  permanent magnet  rotor.  Whenever  there is a sudden change  in  the  load driven by such a motor, like change in required torque or speed, the  permanent  magnet rotor tends to get out of  step  with  the rotating  magnetic field. This can result in  demagnetization  of the  permanent magnet rotor, loss of power and eventual  loss  of life  of  the  rotor. To avoid this  from happening   very high coercivity permanent magnets are required to be used which are costly.<br>
Permanent magnets being hard and brittle, also have poor machinabi1ity.   Fixing  the  permanent  magnets  on   shaft   is therefore,  a difficult process. A rotor position sensor  can  be used  for adjusting the speed of the rotating magnetic  field  in line with the rotor. This will prevent the rotor from getting out of step with the rotating magnetic field. However, this involves additional  complexity  in  making  the  rotor  as  well  as  the electronic pulse generator and the resultant increase in cost of manufacture.<br>
Further in the case of change in loads the hunting or vibration of the permanent magnet rotors can be considerable which can result in damage to the associated parts such as shaft, bearing, coupling, etc.<br>
Thus there is scope for improvements in the design for overcoming the above mentioned drawbacks in a brushless DC motor.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide a rotor design for a brushless DC motor which is simple and cost effective.<br>
Another  object  of  the invention is  to  provide  smoother operation of the motor, with considerable reduction in hunting/ vibration of the rotor while operating with fast changing loads.<br>
One more object of the invention is to provide a simplified design of the rotor and the electronic pulse generator of a hrushless D.C. motor by eliminating the need for rotor position sensor, at least in the case of mildly fluctuating loads.<br>
Yet aother object of the present invention is to provide a brushless  DC motor with a longer expected life, eliminating  the need  for  permanent magnets which can get  demagnetised  over  a period of time.<br>
These objects are achieved by providing a rotor made from hiyh saturation flux density, low coercivity (low He), high retentivity ( hiqh Br), low hystensis loss, high resistivity, soft magnetic material such as mild steel or stampings of suitable magnetic material.<br>
Thus the present invention provides a salient pole brushless DC  motor comprising pairs of salient poles   with  corresponding pairs of windings  wound in the same direction and connected in series;  a  control  pulse  generating  circuit  for   generating positive pulses and negative pulses and sequentially  providing said  pulses to said pairs of windings; for creating  a  rotating magnetic f ie Id; charat: t*ri zed in that said motor is provided with a rotor    comprising   a.  high  saturation   flux   density,   low coercivitv <low he high retentivity br soft magnetic material said rotor getting magnetized by the rotating field created pairs at windings.></low>
When  a positive puise is given to a pair of  windings,  the rotor gets magnetized and behaves like a permanent magnet rotor and rotates with the rotating magnetic field.<br>
In case of sudden change in load if the rotor falls back momentarily it gets demagnetised and remtqnttised in thi eppailii direction  to  be  again in step with  respect  to  the  rotating magnetic field. This allows for some slippage in the rotor speed with respect to the rotating magnetic field. During this time the pulsed power to the stator windings can get adjusted to meet the requirement of the changed load. In case very large and fast load changes  are expected then the power and frequency of pulses  can be automatically adjusted using feedback from rotor  speed  sensor which  is  expected to be simpler and easier as compared  to  the rotor  nositiion sensor used in case of permanent  magnet  rotor. Even a rotor with stampings of suitable magnetic material can be used for this proposed rotor design.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention will now be described in detail with the help of the accompanying drawings, where<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows the brushless DC motor of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 2   shows the pulsed power supply for the  brushless  DC<br>
motor of Fig. 1.<br>
Fig.  3    schematically shows the circuit for  pulsed  power supply for brushless DC motor of Fig. 1<br>
The  configuration of the salient pole brushless D.C.  motor is as shown in Fig. 1. The stator windings Ml and W3 for stator salient  poles PI and P3 are wound in the same direction and  *re connected  in series. Similarly another set of windings W2 and  W4 far  poles  P2  and P4 are wound in the same  direction  and  are connected  in series. The winding direction is such that  when  a postive  voltage/current pulse is given to windings Wl and  W3  a magnetic north pole is induced at PI and a magnetic south pole is induced  at P3. Similarly when a positive voltage/current  pulse is  given to windings W2 and W4 a north and a south pole are induced  respectively  at  P2  and P4. For  negative  pulses  the opposite poles are induced.<br>
The rotor is made of high saturation flux density, low coercivity ( low He) high retentivity (high Br), soft magnetic material such as mild steel. It can also be made from stamping of suitable magnetic material.<br>
An electronic sequential pulse generating power supply (D.C) is used far driving the motor as illustrated in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. First a postive pulse 1 is given to windings Wl and W3. Since<br>
the rotor is of easily magnetisable soft magnetic material it gets aligned ( and magnetized) as shown in Fig.l. Next positive pulse 2 is given to windings W2 and W4. Due to this second pulse the  rotor  now  moves  90 degrees  clockwise  and  gets  aligned vertically.  After  this  a  negative pulse 3  is  given  to  the windings Wl and W3. Due to this the rotor now moves further 90 degrees clockwise. After this a negative pulse 4 is given to  the windings  W2  and  W4. Due to this rotor now moves  further  90 degrees clockwise. Again when a postive pulse 1 is given to the windings  Wl  and  W3 the rotor moves 90 degrees  clockwise  and attains  the  start  position thus completing one  cycle  or  one revolution. By gradually increasing the frequency of pulses (by reducing time interval t2  the speed (r.p.m.) of the rotor can be increased. A rotor speed sensor ( not shown) can be provided  and the  feedback  from  this sensor can be  used  for  automatically adjusting  the  power and frequency of the  pulses  whenever  very large 'and  fast  load changes are expected.  The  power  to  the windings  can  be  increased  by  increasing  pulse  height  i.e. voltage/current and to some extent by increasing pulse - width tl.<br>
It can be seen that pulses 1-3-1-3 form one A.C. wave and the pulses 2-4-2-4 form another A.C wave with a phase difference of 90 degrees. Thus a rotating magnetic field is created, similar to the one in the split - phase single phase induction motor, which in turn rotates the rotor.<br>
Although the invention of the present application has been described in detail, it should be understood that variations and modifications  can  be  made by one skilled in  the  art  without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed. For example, more number of poles and more  number of windings can be provided to enhance the power and  performance of the motor.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
