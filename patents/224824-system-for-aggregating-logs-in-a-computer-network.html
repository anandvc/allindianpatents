THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br><br>
Field of invention:<br>
This invention relates to computer networks.<br>
Particularly, this invention relates to computer network security systems.<br>
Background of the invention: Introduction:<br>
Computers today are used to perform a variety of tasks and have played a vital role in business related functions. As a result there has been a significant growth in the number of computers being used worldwide. In the past few years there has been a need for sharing the data available at various locations on different computers. Such computers may be either located at separate locations or may be in-house as within an office. For sharing of the data, computer networks came into being.<br>
A computer network consists of a group of computers that are linked together, which enables the computers to communicate with each other. By linking computers together it is possible to share files, printers, and even Internet resources. Thus, using such a computer network it is possible to reduce the number of modems, printers and the like devices used in a set up where more than one computer is used. A person using one such computer can access the data on any computer linked to that network. Hardware resources such as printers, scanners and the like devices that are linked to the network can also be accessed. The sharing of data may be inter-nodal sharing or an intersystem sharing. In inter nodal sharing the files, hardware resources and Internet resources within an office are shared, wherein every computer may be<br>
2<br><br>
accessed individually and selectively. In intersystem sharing, the data available on the entire network can be accessed, the network being defined by a set of computers.<br>
Such computer networks consist of hardware and software components. The hardware component may consist of elements such as:<br>
(i)      Desktop Computers/server computers/laptops and the like devices.<br>
(ii)     Cables, connectors and the like components.<br>
(iii)    Routers, switches, hubs.<br>
(iv)    Network interface cards.<br>
The software component may consist of elements such as: (i)     Operating systems, (ii)     Installation software, which is used for the installation of the<br>
hardware components, (iii)    Drivers, (iv)    Protocols,  which  help  the  various  computers  in  the  network,<br>
communicate, (v)     Application software, provided at the user end to access the network,<br>
typically the Internet, (vi)    Anti-virus software.<br>
When such networks are used to link computers, typically in an office building, a school, across two or more buildings the network is called a Local Area Network (LAN). A Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) connects an area larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, typically a city block. Wide Area Network (WAN) spans a larger physical distance and is a geographically<br>
3<br><br>
dispersed collection of LANs and MANs. These networks are wired networks and hence to reduce the distance to which they can be extended Wireless LANs (WLANs) are used. A WLAN is a wireless local area network that uses radio waves as its carrier. The link with the users is wireless, to give a network connection to all users in the surrounding area. Areas may range from a single room to an entire campus. The backbone network usually uses cables, with one or more wireless access points connecting the wireless users to the wired network.<br>
The Internet has made it possible to access information located on any network across the world. By using public and private network any individual can access its information. However, the availability of confidential information over such networks poses a threat to its security, as information available may be used in an unlawful manner. Confidential information available on the network may be stolen for the purpose of duplicating and using technology for industrial and commercial benefits. If the information available on the networks of various defense organizations leaks, it may pose severe threat to the security of a country. Such and many problems may arise due the breach in security.<br>
Wired networks make use of a centralized server through which every computer in that network can be accessed. The breach in security may be at a nodal level wherein only one particular node (computer) is hacked. The breach in security may be at a system level wherein the entire network can be hacked at once. In wireless networks, there may not be a centralized server for the purpose of authentication and verification hence wireless networks are more susceptible to attacks than wired networks.<br>
4<br><br>
When businesses send confidential information using Internet as a medium of communication, they place a high value on the information sent to the destination, so that it reaches the destination without being intercepted by anyone other than the intended recipient. Therefore, companies and individuals desire a secured means of communication. Finally, connecting a system to a network can open the system itself to attacks and breaches. In case a system is compromised, the risk of losing data is very high.<br>
Hacking allows an individual to exploit the security weaknesses and loopholes to gain unauthorized access to the information available on the network. A hacker attempts to break into systems or networks by attacking the weakest and the most vulnerable link. The purpose of hacking may be either for industrial espionage, for fun or may be ideological. However, hacking or the leak of confidential information may even cause severe commercial and technological damage.<br>
Hence, there is need for stringent security measures to be installed at the points and links where the possibility of a breach in security is high. As a preliminary method of security, mechanical locks were used. Other hardware, software and biometrie locking systems are also used for security purposes. However, the aforementioned locking/securing systems can be implemented only for one machine at a time; these are also known as nodal security systems. The nodal security systems involve locking of each and every machine, which is not practically possible; also there is a possibility of an attack on a computer if it is unattended for a few minutes. In such a case, the locking/security systems mentioned above fail and the security of the system can be easily breached.<br>
5<br><br>
The use of security-managing devices/systems such as intrusion detection systems (IDS), firewalls (FW), Anti-virus systems (AVS) and the like were envisaged. The use of such security managing devices/systems employ stringent verification and authentication procedures and round-the-clock monitoring of all the data being transmitted and received by every computer in the network. Such security devices cover all the security aspects related to the entire network and all the computers of that network.<br>
An important aspect of security device involves verification, authentication and monitoring which is done by maintaining and continuously updating logs. These logs are a record of computer activity used for statistical purposes as well as backup and recovery. The log files are written by the operating system or other control program for the purpose of recording incoming dialogs, error and status messages and certain transaction details and the like.<br>
At different points in a network, the security systems/devices such as intrusion detection systems (IDS), firewalls (F) and the like security devices/systems are installed. One such device/system may produce more than several thousand kilobytes of log data in a day. The log data from firewalls, routers, servers and other network equipment are the primary sources of data for troubleshooting and are the only unimpeachable source of historical network activity information. The task of management of such huge amount of log data is therefore undertaken by the security device/system. This may reduce the effectiveness and efficiency of the security device/system as a considerable amount of time is consumed in managing the log data and thus a threat may be detected after the security has already been breached.<br>
Traditional ways of storing logs were to moving logs into files or database. Data aggregation refers to the consolidation of information into a<br>
6<br><br>
single point of storage. Event aggregation, on the other hand, is often used to describe the act of taking a number of similar alerts or events and representing them as a single message to store in the database. In the intrusion-detection system (IDS) world, this might be implemented by taking a set of intruder activities and consolidating them into a single alert.<br>

Detailed description of the accompanying drawings:<br>
This invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings 1 to 3.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a block diagram of the devices of the aggregation system in accordance with this invention. The aggregation system (10) works in cooperation with all work stations and devices (12) of a computer network. The aggregation system comprises a collecting means (14) which collects the logs generated by each device (12) of the computer network. The aggregation means (16) aggregates the logs received and collected by the collection means (14). A further aggregator means (18) helps further aggregate logs aggregated in the aggregation means (16) and the storage means (20).<br>
9<br><br>
Figure 2a and 2b illustrate detailed block diagram of the devices of the aggregation system and the workflow of the aggregation process in accordance with this invention. The collecting means (12) receives the logs generated by each of the devices associated with at least some of the workstations in the computer network. The received logs are then filtered using the parsing means (22). The parsing means (22) filters out unimportant and redundant logs. The first block of the aggregation system is the parser system. The parsing means has pre stored "drivers" which identifies the data sent on the network and filters out known logs from the same. One needs to inform the parser if a new device is added into the system. A new "driver" needs to be introduced every time a new device is added. The parser then puts the logs into untagged memory location.<br>
The aggregation scheme is a multi-stage process where after the parser has parsed the logs, the packet classifier module takes the log and classifies the same with regards to the source of the log; this module has a set of predefined tags for each log source. The parsed logs are then tagged using tagging means (24). Each log will be processed by a tagging operation in a sequential manner. Once the tagging operation is performed the tagged logs are moved to a new memory location.<br>
Tagging of parsed logs is done in a manner such that each log can be identified on the basis of the device from which it was generated.<br>
The tagged logs are then converted to a standard format by the converting means (26). Thus the tagged logs are further processed by common log format generator. In this block there are pre stored formats and pre stored operators<br>
10<br><br>
which will convert the tagged logs into the common log format. These common logs are stored into a different memory location.<br>
The converted logs are then passed on to the queuing means (28). The Queing means will take the common log formats in the first in first queued fashion and queue the logs in the system memory acting as a queue. In the queuing means the logs queue, typically in a first come first serve manner. The queuing means (28) then passes the tagged logs to a device identifier means (30). The queuing means (28), typically works in FIFO mode. The device identifier which has a pre stored tag format, it dequeues the logs from the Aggregator Queuer and compares it with the tags in the common logs. The device identifier will further place the logs into memory area predetermined for each device type.<br>
The device identifier means (30) identifies the log generated by a particular device using the tag attached to a particular log. All logs generated by one particular device of each of the workstations on the computer network are identified and assembled in the device identifier means (30). Further a type identifier means (32) is used to assemble logs which are similar. The type identifier means (32) identifies the different type of logs based on a pre stored log types and puts them into a sub memory area for each type.<br>
The first pass of aggregator will process the logs stored in each log-type memory specific to a device within a given time x and puts the logs into different bins based on common parameters, like common Source IP and Destination port. Each type of logs has a given set of parameters.<br>
11<br><br>
For a parameters set of 5 the total number of bins would be equal to 5 C| + 5 C2 + 5 C3 + 5 C4 + 5 C5, which is 31. Each log is assembled into a stream of logs as particularly seen in figure 2a. In the process of aggregation as particularly seen in figure 2b logs contained in each stream are put together in bins (34) which are generated dynamically in a manner such that a set of logs contained in a particular bin have common properties and similarities. The number of bins created every x second is based on the logs processed during this time window, and thus different number of bins could be created during subsequent aggregator first pass, hence these bins are called dynamic bins. Thus the bins (34) contain similar logs of one particular device of the plurality of devices and workstations on a computer network. For example one particular bin would contain logs having similar parameters and properties generated by all security devices associated with each of the workstations on a computer network. Thus similar logs are aggregated and stored in the storing means (18).<br>
The aggregated logs may be further given to a further aggregation means (16) for aggregating the aggregated logs as seen in figure 3 of the accompanying drawings. Once the first pass of aggregator has finished processing and putting logs into bins, the second pass goes through the bins and creates an aggregated log packet, which is finally stored as an aggregated log. This entire process is online and done as the logs are getting generated.<br>
Further the aggregating system (10) has a plurality of drivers which are used when additional devices are associated with the workstations of the computer network. Driver helps each component of the aggregation system (10) to identify and aggregate logs generated by the additional device.<br>
12<br><br>
In case of introduction of a new device in the network environment, one needs to update the parser driver, the pre stored tags used by packet classifier, the common log format driver and create new areas for device identifier and type identifier for the said device.<br>
The process of further aggregation is the act of using the aggregator to further aggregate the stored aggregated logs. This process can be invoked either daily, weekly, monthly and yearly or as per need. This process can be both online or offline.<br>
An Example of different types of logs generated by a subset of different devices associated with a workstation in a computer network is as follows: Firewall<br><br>
Connection logs	Connection Drop	Connection close	Connection Reject	VPN connect<br>
IDS/IPS<br><br>
Signature Match found	Complete packet data	Protocol anomaly	URL match	Content detection<br>
Router<br><br>
Routing update	SNMP info	Connection logs	Connection drop	System log<br>
Web server<br><br>
Access log	Error Log	Update log	Secure connection log	Reject log<br>
13<br><br>
Operating System<br><br>
User Access log	Failure log	Hardware logs	Crash log	Service log<br>
Example 1:<br>
In the experiments conducted the central logging server gets on an average<br>
1000 Logs per second with an average size of 100bytes per logs. The test was<br>
done for 1 hr.  The average amount data stored per second is about 100KB.<br>
Thus the amount of data stored within one hr is 350 MB worth of data without<br>
using the aggregator scheme.<br>
With the same test setup, the aggregator system produced about 80% saving of<br>
data, hence only storing 70 MB worth data.<br>
Example 2:<br>
In this experiment the focus was to get find out the advantage of aggregation<br>
technique in case of a system consisting of a firewall and a heavily loaded web<br>
server.<br>
The central logging server gets on an average 5000 Logs per second with an average size of 100bytes per logs. The test was done for 1 hr. The average amount data stored per second is about 500KB. Thus the amount of data store within one hr is 1.7 GB worth of data without using the aggregator scheme.<br>
With the same test setup, the aggregator system in accordance with this invention about 60% saving of data, hence only storing 600 MB of data. With the use of further aggregation at an, average 5-10% further reduction of data was seen.<br>
14<br><br>
While considerable emphasis has been placed herein on the various components of the preferred embodiment, it will be appreciated that many alterations can be made and that many modifications can be made in the preferred embodiment without departing from the principles of the invention. These and other changes in the preferred embodiment as well as other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the disclosure herein, whereby it is to be distinctly understood that the foregoing descriptive matter is to be interpreted merely as illustrative of the invention and not as a limitation.<br>
