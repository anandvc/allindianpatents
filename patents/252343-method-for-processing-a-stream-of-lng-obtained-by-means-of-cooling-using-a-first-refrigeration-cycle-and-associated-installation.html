Method  for  processing  a   stream of   LNG  obtained   by  means   of cooling  using  a  first   refrigeration   cycle and   associated<br>
installation.<br>
ABSTRACT<br>
In   this   method,   the  LNG   stream (11)    is   cooled   using   a refrigerating   fluid   (83)    in   a   first   heat-exchanger   (19).    The refrigerating  fluid   (83)    is   subjected  to  a   sec ond   semi -open refrigeration   c ycle  ( 21)    which   is   independent   of   the first cycle  (15).    The  method  comprises   a  step  for   introducing  the stream (59)    of   sub-cooled   LNG   into   a  distillation   column   (49) and   a   step  for   recovering   a   stream (6 9)    of   gas   at   the top   of the colum   ( 49) .<br>
The  second   refrigeration   cycle  (21)    comprises   a   step   for forming   a   stream (73)    of   refrigerating   fluid   from a   portion of   the top  stream (69)    of   gas,   a   step  for  compressing  the stream of   refrigerating  f luid   (7 3)   to  a  high  pressure,   then   a step  for   expanding   a  portion   (81)    of   the stream (75)    of compressed   refrigerating  fluid   in   order  to form a substantially  liquid   sub-c ooling   stream (83).    The substantially  liquid   stream (83)    is   evaporated   in  the first heat - exchang er   ( 19).<br>
Figure  1.<br><br>
The present   invention   relates   to  a   method   for   processing   a stream of   LNG   obtained   by   means   of   cooling   using   a   first refrigeration   cyc1ic,    t he   method   beirnr of  the  t ype cornprsing the following   steps:<br>
(a)    the  stream of   LNG  which   has   been   brought   to   a   temperature of   1ess   than   -100° C  is   introduced   into  a  first   heat -exchanger; ( b)    the  stream of   LKG   is   sub-cooled   in   the first   heat-exchanger   by   means   of   heat -exchange with   a  refrigerating fluid   in   order   to  form a   stream of   sub-cooled   LNG;    and (c)   the refrigerating  fluid   is   subjected  to  a   second   semi-open   refrigeration   cycle which   is   independent   of   the first cyc1e.<br>
US-B-6   30 8   5 31   discloses   a   method   of   the  above-mentioned   type, in   which  a   stream of   natural   gas   is   liquefied   using   a  first refrigeration   cycle which   uses   the condensation   and evaporation   of   a   mixture   of   hydrocarbons.    The temperature   of the  gas   obtained   is   approximately   -100° C.    Then,   the  LNG produced   is   sub-cooled   to   approximately   -170° C   using   a   second refrigeration   cycle   of   the type referred   to   as   a   semi-open "invert ed   Brayt  on  c yc 1 e"   comprising   a   stage compressor   and   a gas   expansion   t urbine.<br>
A  method   of   this   type  is   not   entirely satisfactory.    The maximum yield   of   the  inverted   Brayton   cycle  is   limited   to approxi mately 40%. Further more,  the   operation   thereof in   a semi -open   cycle is   difficult   to  implement.<br>
An   object   of   the invention   is   therefore to  provide  an independent   method   for   processing   a   stream of   LNG  which   has an   improved   yield   and   which  can   be readily  implemented   in units   of   d i f f er ent   structures.<br><br>

(vii)    the  substantially  liquid 'sub-cooling   stream is evaporated   in   the first   heat-exchanger   in   order  to  form a reheated   sub-cooling   stream<br>

The four   compressors 29   are driven   by the same   external   energy source  45.    The source   4 5   is,   for   example,   a   motor   of   the  gas   turbine type.<br>
The refrigeration   units   31   and   43   are cooled   by  means   of water   and /or   air.<br><br>
The denitrogenation   unit   23   comprises   an   intermediate hydraulic   turbine  47   which   is   c oupled  to  a   stream generator' 48 /   a distillation  colum   4 9 ,    a   heat- exchanger   51  f or   t h e  t op of the column   and   a   heat-exchanger   53   for   the  bottom of   the colum.     It   further   corrprises   a   purrp   55   for   discharging denitrogenated  LNG  13,<br>
Below,    a   stream of   liquid   and   the conduit   which  conveys   it will   be designated  with  the  same  reference numeral,   the pressures   in   question   are  absolute pressures,    and   the percentages   in   question   are   molar   percentages.<br>
The  initial   LNG   stream 11   from the  liquefaction   unit   15   is   at a  temperature  lower  than   -90° C,   for   example,   at   -130° C,    This stream 11   comprises,   for   example,    approximately 5%   of nitrogen,    90%   of   methane  and   5%   of    ethane,   and   the flow   rate thereof   is   50,000   kmol/h.<br>
The stream 11   of   LNG  is   introduced   into the first   heat-exchanger   19,   where it   is   sub-cooled  to  a  temperature of   -150°C  in   order  to  produce  a   stream 57   of   sub-cooled   LNG.<br>
The  stream 57   is   then   introduced   into the hydraulic   turbine 4 7   and   expand ed   in   a  dynamic   manner  to  a   low   pressure  in order  to  form a   expanded   stream 59.    This   stream 59   is substantially   Liquid,    t hat   is   to  say,    it   contains   less   than 2%   mol   of   gas.    The stream 59   is  cooled   in  the  bottom heat-exchanger   53,   then   introduced   into  a   expansion   valve 61   where it   forms   a   stream 64   for   supplying  the column   49.<br>
The stream 64   is   introduced   at   the top   of   the distillation column   49,   at   a  low distillation  pressure.    The low distillation   pressure is   slightly higher  than   atmospheric<br><br>
pressure...    In   this   example,   this   pressure is   1. 25   bar   and   the temperature   of   the  stream 64   is   appr oxi mat ely   -165°C.<br>
A supplementary stream 63   of   natural   gas,   substantially  of the same composition   as   the  initial   stream 11   of   LNG,    is cooled   in  the top   exchanger   51   then   expanded   in   a   valve 65 and   mixed  with  the stream 59   of   expanded   sub-cooled   LNG upstream of   the valve 61.<br>
A reboiling   stream 68   is   extracted   from the colum. 4 9   at   an intermediate stage   Ni,   located   in  the region   of   the  bottom of this   colum    The  stream 68   is   introduced   into  the   exchanger 53,   where  it   is   reheated   by  means   of   heat-exchang e with  the stream 5 9   of   expanded   sub-cooled   LNG,   before being reintroduced   into the colurm   49   below  the intermediate  level Ni.<br>
A  bottom liquid   stream 67   containing   less   than   1%   of   nitrogen is   extracted   from the colurm   49.    This   bottom stream 67   is pumped   by the purrp  5 5   in   order  to form the stream 13   of denitrogenated   LNG  which   is   intended   to   be  sent   to   a   storage d evic e.<br>
A top   gaseous   stream 6 9   which  contains   almost   50%   of   nitrogen is   extracted   from the distillation  colurm   49,    This   stream 69 is rehetaed  by means   of  heat-exchange  with   the   s upplementary stream 63   in   the top   exchanger   51   in   order  to form a   reheated. top  stream 71.    This   stream 71   is   introduced   into the first stage 27 A  of   the compression  device 25.<br>
The reheated  top  stream 71   is   successively compressed   in   the first   stage 27A and  in  the second   stage 27B   of   the compressor 25   substantially to  a   low  cycle pressure  PB,   then   compressed<br><br>
in  the third  compression   stage 27C   before  being   introduced into  the fourth  conpression   stage 27D.    In   each   stage 27   of the compressor,    the  top   stream 71    is   subjected   t o   a conpression   operation   in   the compressor   29   followed   by cooling   to  a  temperature  of   approximately  35°C   in   the associated   refrigeration   unit   31.<br>
A first   portion   16   of   the top   stream compressed   in   the fourth compression   stage 27D   is   extracted   from the compressor   29D, at   an   intermediate pressure  PI,   in   order  to  form the  stream of   combustible gas.<br>
The  intermediate pressure   PI   is,   for   example,   greater   than   20 bar   and   preferably substantially   equal   t o   30   bar.    The  low cycle  pressure  PB  is,   for   exarrpl e,    lower   than   20   bar.<br>
A second   portion   73   of   the top  str earn c ontinues   to  be compressed   in   the compressor   29D  to   a   mean   pressure which   is substantially   equal   to  50   bar   in   order   to  form an   initial stream of   refrigerating   fluid.<br>
The stream 73   is  cooled   in   the   exchanger   31D then   introduced into  the  auxiliary compressor   33,<br>
The flow   rate   of   the  initial   stream 73   of   refrigerating   fluid is much higher tnan   the flow   rate of  the  stream 16   of combustible gas.    The relationship   between   the two flow   rates is,   in   this   example,   substantially  equal  to 6. 5<br>
The  stream 73   is   then   compressed   in   the compressor   39   to   a high  cycle pressure  PH.    This   high  pressure is   between   40   and 100   bar,   preferably  between   50   and   80   bar   and   advantageously between  60   and  75   bar.<br><br>
The  stream 73   from the compressor   39   forms,   after   passing<br>
through the refrigeration unit  43,    a   st ream 75  of   compressed refrigerating   fluid.    The top   stream 6 9-  contains   less   than   5%<br>
by   mass   of . C+2    hydrocarbons,    so  that   the  stream 7 5   is   purely<br>
gaseous.    When   the high  pressure is   greater  than   approximately 60   bar,   the  stream 75   is   a   supercritical   fluid.<br>
The  stream 75   is   then   cooled   in   the  second   heat-exchang er   33       and   separated   at   the   outlet   of   this   exchanger   3 3   into   a<br>
secondary sub-cooling   stream 77   of   the  LING   and   a   primary   main cooling   stream 79.    The relationship   of   these two  flow   rates is   in   the  order   of   0.5.<br>
The  sub-cooling   stream 77   is   cooled   in   the third   exchanger   35, then   in   the first   exchanger   19   in   order   to  form a  cooled   sub-cooling   stream 81.    The  stream 81   is   expanded   to the   low   cycle pressure  PB  in  the valve 37   from where  it   is   discharged   in the form of   a   substantially  liquid   sub-cooling   stream 83,       that   is   to  say,   which  contains   less   than   10%   mol   of   gas.<br>
The  stream 83   is   then   introduced   into the first    exchanger   19, where it   evaporates   and  cools,    by  means   of   heat -exchange,   the stream 81   and   the initial   LNG  stream 11,   in   order   to  form,   at the   outlet   of   the first    exchanger   19,   a   reheated   sub-cooling strearn 8 5.<br>
The  gaseous   main   stream 79   is   expanded   in  the turbine  41 substantially to the low  cycle pressure  PB  and   mixed  with  the       reheated   stream 85   from the first   exchanger   19   in   order  to form a   mixed   stream 87.    The   mixed   stream 87   is   then introduced   successively into the third   exchanger   35,   then into  the second   exchanger   33  where it   cools,   by  means   of   a<br><br>
heat-exchange  relationship,   the  sub-cooling   stream 77   and   the stream 75   of   compressed   refrigerating  fluid.<br>
Th e  reheated   mixed   stream 89   from the   exc han g er   3 3   is   t h en introduced   into the compression   device  25   at   the  inlet   of   the third  compression   stage 27C,   substantially at   the  low pressur e  PB.<br>
By way  of   illustration,   the pressure,   temperature,   and   flow rate  values   when   the  high  cycle pressure  PH  is   substantially equal   to  75   bar   are  set   out   in   the table   below.<br><br><br><br>
In  Figure 2,   the  efficiency line 91   of   the cycle 21   in  the<br>
method   according  to the  invention   is   illustrated   in accordance with  the temperature  value  of   the  stream 11   of   LNG. As   illustrated   in   this   Figure,   the   yields   are  greater   than 4 4%,   which c onstitutes   a   significant   increase compared  with the  methods   of   the prior   art   which  involve a   semi-open invert ed   Brayton  c ycle.<br>
This   result   is   obtained   in   a   simple   manner   since  it   is   not necessary to  provide  means  f or   storing   and  preparing   a refrigerating  fluid,   the refrigerating  fluid  73   being continuously  supplied   by the installation   9.<br>
The   method   and  the  installation   9   of   the present   invention are used   either   in  new   liquefaction   units   or  to  improve the efficiency  levels   of   existing   LNG  production   units.    In   the latter  case,   with   equal  power  consumption,   the production   of denitr ogenat ed   LNG  can   be increased  from 5%   to  20%.    The method   and  the installation   9   according  to the  invention  can also   be used  to  sub-cool   and  d enitrogenat e LNG  produced   in methods   for    extracting  natural  gas   liquids   ( NGT.).<br>
The installation   99   illustrated   in  Figure 3  differs   from the       first   installation   9   in  that   the   expansion   valve  37   located downstream of   the first   exchanger   is   replaced  with   a  turbine 101   f or  d ynamic   expansion  coupled  to  a  stream  generator   103.<br><br>
The   method   for   processing  the stream of   LNG   in   this installation   is   further   identical   to  the   method   us ed   in   the<br>
installation   9 ,   t o  w it h i n   numer ica1   va1ues -<br>
In   a   variant   which   is   illust rat ed   with   a  dot-dash   lin e  in Figure 3,   a   stream 92   of   ethane is   mixed  with the reheated mixed   stream 8 9   before  it   is   introduced   into the third compression   stage 27 C.<br>
The   efficiency   of  the cycle 21   is   then   further   increased   as illustrated   by the  line  93   of   Figure 2.<br>
The third   installation   104   according  to the  invention   is illustrated   in   Figure   4.    This   installation   10 4   differs   from the second   installation   9 9   in   that   it   further   comprises   a third   refrigeration   cycle  105   which   is   closed   and   which   is independent   of   the first   and   second  cycles   17   and   21.<br>
The third   cycle  105   comprises   a   secondary compressor   107, first   and   second   secondary refrigeration   units   109A and   109B, a   expansion   valve  111   and   a   separating   flask   113.<br>
This   cycle  is   implemented   using   a   stream of   secondary refrigerating  fluid   115   which  comprises   propane.    The  gaseous stream 115   at   the  low   pressure  is   introduced   into the compressor    107,    then   cooled   and   condensed   at   the   high pressure  in   the  refrigeration   units   109A and   109B   in   order   to form a   partially  liquid   stream 117   of   propane.    This   stream 117   is   cooled   in   the   exchanger   33,   then   introduced   into  the expansion   valve  111,   where  it   is   expanded   and   forms   a   biphase stream 119   of   expanded   propane.<br><br>
The  stream 119   is   introduced   into the separating   flask   113   in order   to  form a   liquid   fraction   121   which   is   extracted   from the   bottom  of   th e  f1ask   113.    Th e  f raction   121    i s   introduced into  the   exchanger   33   where  it   is   evaporated   by   means   of heat-exchang e  with  the  stream 117   and   with  the   stream 75   of compressed refrigerating  fluid,    before  being  introduced   into the flask   113.<br>
The gaseous   fraction  from the top   of   the flask   113   forms   the stream 115   of   gaseous   propane.<br>
As   illustrated   by the   line  123   of   Figure 2,   the   efficiency   of the cycle 21   is   then   increased   by  4%   on   average compared   with the   ef f ici enc y  of   the   method   implemented   in   the first installation   9.<br>
The fourth   installation   25   according   to  the  invention   125 illustrated   in   Figure  5   differs   from that   illustrated   in Figur e   4   in   that   the third   refrigeration   cyc1e   105   has   no separating  flask   113,    The stream 119   from the valve  111   is therefore  introduced   directly into  the  second   exchanger   33 and   completely   evaporated   in   this   exchanger.<br>
Furthermore,   the  refrigerating   fluid   115   comprises   a   mixture of   ethane and  propane.    The content   in  terms   of   ethane in  the<br>
fluid 115   is   substantially   equal to  the  content. In terms   of propane.<br>
As   illustrated   by the  line 126   of   Figure 2,   the   mean ef f i ciency  of   the  second   refrigeration   cycle  is   then increased   by  approximately  0.5%   compared  with  the   efficiency of   the   method   implemented   in  the third   installation   104   when the temperature is   lower   than   -130° C.    Taking   into  account   the<br><br>
energy produced   by the turbine  47,   the  overall   yield   of   the installation   of   Figure  5   is   slightly greater   than   50%, compared with   approximately   47. 5%   for   that    of   Figure  1 ,   47. 6% for   that   of   Figure  3   and   49.6%   for   that   of   Figure   4.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
