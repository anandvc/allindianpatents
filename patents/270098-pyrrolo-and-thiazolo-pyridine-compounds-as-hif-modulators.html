CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001]    This application claims priority benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 119 (e) of United States Provisional Application Serial No. 60/789,310, filed April 04, 2006, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]   The present invention relates to novel compounds capable of modulating the stability and/or activity of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF).<br>
State of the Art<br>
[0003]    Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS (Per/Arnt/Sim) transcriptional activator that mediates changes in gene expression in response to changes in cellular oxygen concentration. HIF is a heterodimer containing an oxygen-regulated a-subunit (HIFα), and a constitutively expressed β-subunit (HIFβ), also known as aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear transporter (ARNT). In oxygenated (normoxic) cells, HIFα subunits are rapidly degraded by a mechanism that involves ubiquitination by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) E3 ligase complex. Under hypoxic conditions, HIFα is not degraded, and an active HIFα/β complex accumulates in the nucleus, and activates the expression of several genes including glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporters, erythropoietin (EPO), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). (Jiang et al. (1996) J Biol Chem 271:17771-17778; Iliopoulus et al. (1996) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 93:10595-10599; Maxwell et al. (1999) Nature 399:271-275; Sutler et al. (2000) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97:4748-4753; Cockman et al. (2000) J Biol Chem 275:25733-25741; and Tanimoto et al. (2000) EMBO J 19:4298-4309.)<br>
[0994]    Levels of HIFα are elevated in most cells in response to hypoxia, and HIFα is induced in vivo when animals are subjected to anemia or hypoxia. HIFα levels rise within a few hours after the onset of hypoxia, and induce numerous beneficial cellular processes including cytoprotective effects, enhanced erythropoiesis, and physiological adaptation to ischemic or hypoxic states. Induction of HIFα is potentially beneficial in conditions such as myocardial acute ischemia, and early infarction, pulmonary hypertension, inflammation, and anemia.<br><br>
[0005]    HIFα levels are also increased by a number of factors that mimic hypoxia, including iron chelators such as desferrioxamine (DFO), and divalent metal salts such as CoCl2 Additionally, compounds originally identified as inhibitors of procollagen prolyl hydroxylase enzymes have been found to stabilize HIFα. Examples of such compounds can be found, e.g., in Majamaa et al. (1984) Eur J Biochem 138:239-245; Majamaa et al. (1985) Biochem J 229:127-133; Kivirikko, and Myllyharju (1998) Matrix Biol 16:357-368; Biekel et al. (1998) Hepatology 28:404-411; Friedman et al. (2000) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97:4736-4741; Franklin (1991) Biochem Soc Trans 19):812-815; and Franklin et al. (2001) Biochem J 353:333-338. Additionally, compounds that stabilize HIFα have been described in, e.g., International Publication Nos. WO 03/049686, WO 02/074981, WO 03/080566, and WO 2004/108681.<br>
[0006]    There remains a need for compounds that are effective in the prevention of disorders associated with HIF, including anemia, and tissue damage caused by ischemia that occurs due to, e.g., atherosclerosis, diabetes, and pulmonary disorders such as pulmonary embolism, and the like. Compounds that modulate HIF and can thus be used to treat and prevent HIF-associated disorders including conditions involving anemia, ischemia, and hypoxia are provided herein.<br>

4.         Compound Preparation<br>
[0115] The compounds of this invention can be prepared from readily available starting materials using, for example, the following general methods, and procedures. It will be appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions (i.e., reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given, other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvent<br><br>
used, but such conditions can be determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.<br>
[0116]  Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. Suitable protecting groups for various functional groups as well as suitable conditions for protecting and deprotecting particular functional groups are well known in the art. For example, numerous protecting groups are described in T. W. Greene and G. M. Wuts (1999) Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition, Wiley, New York, and references cited therein.<br>
[0117]  Furthermore, the compounds of this invention may contain one or more chiral centers. Accordingly, if desired, such compounds can be prepared or isolated as pure stereoisomers, i.e., as individual enantiomers or diastereomers, or as stereoisomer-enriched mixtures. All such stereoisomers (and enriched mixtures) are included within the scope of this invention, unless otherwise indicated. Pure stereoisomers (or enriched mixtures) may be prepared using, for example, optically active starting materials or stereoselective reagents well-known in the art. Alternatively, racemic mixtures of such compounds can be separated using, for example, chiral column chromatography, chiral resolving agents, and the like.<br>
[0118] The starting materials for the following reactions are generally known compounds or can be prepared by known procedures or obvious modifications thereof. For example, many of the starting materials are available from commercial suppliers such as Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA), Bachem (Torrance, California, USA), Emka-Chemce or Sigma (St. Louis, Missouri, USA). Others may be prepared by procedures, or obvious modifications thereof, described in standard reference texts such as Fieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes 1-15 (John Wiley, and Sons, 1991), Rodd's Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Volumes 1-5, and Supplemental (Elsevier Science Publishers, 1989), Organic Reactions, Volumes 1-40 (John Wiley, and Sons, 1991), March's Advanced Organic Chemistry, (John Wiley, and Sons, 5th Edition, 2001), and Larock's Comprehensive Organic Transformations (VCH Publishers Inc., 1989).<br>
General Synthetic Scheme to Compounds of Formula I<br>
[0119]  Scheme 1 illustrates a preferred method for the preparation of the compounds of this invention. The starting materials (compound 101) are either known in the art or commercially available or prepared as illustrated in Scheme 3-6. R as used in the schemes may be, but is not<br><br>
limited to, ethyl. R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, and Rx as used in the synthetic schemes are as defined herein. Functional groups (R6, R7, and/or R8) may or may not undergo conventional chemical transformation under reaction conditions throughout the entire reaction sequence and can be derivatized under conventional conditions to other functional groups.<br><br>
[0120] Compound 101 is conventionally brominated with an equivalent of NBS to provide compound 192. Compound 102 is then coupled with protected glycine ester (compound 103) under conventional conditions with, for example, but not limited to, sodium hydride or potassium carbonate, to provide compound 104. Subsequent intramolecular cyclization, removal of the protecting group, and oxidation/aromatization to compound 105 then proceeds under a sequence of conventional conditions; for example, compound 104 is cyclized by treatment with potassium tert-butoxide followed by removal of the protecting group with TFA (P = Boc) or thionyl chloride (P = DMB) and aromatization with or without the presence of an oxidizing agent to provide compound 10S.<br><br>
[0121] Amidation of compound 105 with a compound of the formula R4NHCR2R3C(O)OH under conventional conditions with, for example, but not limited to, sodium methoxide, generates compounds of this invention (compound 108a where R5 = H). In addition, compound 105 can be halogenated under conventional conditions with, for example, but not limited to, NBS or NCS, to give compound 106 (X = Cl or Br). Compound 106 can then be amidated as above to provide more compounds of this invention (compound 108b where R5 = X). Alternatively, palladium-catalyzed alkylation or arylation of compound 106 in the presence of organoboronic acids or organotin reagents gives compound 107 which, when followed by amidation as above, provides for more compounds of this invention (compound 108c where R5 is as described herein).<br>
[0122] Alternatively, the compounds of this invention may be prepared by the method illustrated in Scheme 2. Compounds 109 are either known in the art or commercially available or prepared by oxidizing compound 101 under conventional conditions, for example, but not limited to, potassium permanganate, followed by esterification. Mono-deesterification of compound 109 proceeds using a single equivalent of sodium hydroxide to provide a mixture of compounds 110 and 111. The free acid group of compounds 110 and 111 is amidated via conventional methods to provide compounds 112 and 113.<br>
[0123] Condensation of compounds 112 and 113 in the presence of a suitable base, such as sodium tert-butoxidc, provides compounds 114 and 115. The hydroxyl group alpha to the nitrogen atom of the pyridinyl ring of compounds 114 and 115 is regioselectively substituted with halogen by treatment with excess phosphorous oxyhalide, such as POC13, to provide compounds 116 and 117. Conventional amidation as described above provides for compounds of this invention (compound 108b and 120b where R5 is a halogen such as Cl or Br). Alternatively, global or partial de-halogenation with hydrogen over a palladium catalyst followed by conventional amidation as above provides for additional compounds of this invention (compound 108a and 120a where R5 is H). In addition, palladium-catalyzed alkylation or arylation of compounds 116 and 117 in the presence of organoboronic acids or organotin reagents gives compounds 118 and 119 which, when followed by amidation as above, provides for more compounds of this invention (compounds 108c and 120c where R4 is as described in the Summary).<br><br><br><br>

[0131] 2-Ketobutyric acid (compound 210a) is esterified to give compound 210b which, in turn, when brominated under conventional conditions, for example, but not limited to, copper(II) bromide, gives rise to compound 211. Condensation of compound 211 with compound 208, which is either known in the art or commercially available, provides the intermediate compound 212.<br>
Synthesis of Substituted-1H-lndole-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester for Beta-Carboline series<br>
[0132]  Scheme 7 illustrates a general protocol for the preparation of the intermediates, substituted-1H-indole-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (compound 215), for the synthesis of compounds of this invention as described in Scheme 1 and 2. This synthesis is useful for embodiments of the invention wherein A is =C(R7)- and R7 and R6 and the carbon atoms bound thereto join to form an aryl or substituted aryl group. While the illustration below only depicts an unsubstituted phenyl, substitutition of the phenyl group is also contemplated.<br><br><br>
[0133]    Compound 213 is either known in the art or commercially available. Substituted 2-iodo-phenylamine (compound 213) is coupled with ethyl acetotcetate sodium salt under conventional conditions in the presence of copper(I) iodide to give compound 214, which, in turn, when reacted with R8I (R8 = aryl) under conventional conditions, for example, but not limited to, copper(I) iodide, TMEDA and potassium phosphate in toluene, provides the intermediate compound 215. Compound 214 can also react with R8X (X = Cl, Br, or I; R8 = alkyl) in the presence of a base, for example, but not limited to, sodium hydride (NaH) or potassium carbonate to provide intermediate 215 (R8 = alkyl).<br>
[0134]  Other modifications to arrive at compounds of this invention are well within the skill of the art. For example, modification of the hydroxyl group that is beta to the nitrogen of the 5,6-membered bicyclic ring may be done by conventional means to corresponding ethers, thiols, thiocthers, amino, and aminoacyls.<br>
5.         Testing and Administration a.         Biological Testing<br>
[0135] The biological activity of the compounds of the invention may be assessed using any conventionally known methods. Suitable assay methods are well known in the art. The following assays are presented only as examples and are not intended to be limiting. The compounds of the invention are active in at least one of the following assays.<br><br>
i.	Cell-based HIFα stabilization assay<br>
[0136]  Human cells derived from various tissues are separately seeded into 35 mm culture dishes, and grown at 37°C, 20% O2,5% CO2 in standard culture medium, e.g., DMEM (Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium), 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum). When cell layers reach confluence, the media is replaced with OPTI-MEM media (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad CA), and cell layers are incubated for approximately 24 hours in 20% O2,5% CO2 at 37 °C. Compound or 0.013% DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) is then added to existing medium and incubation is continued overnight.<br>
[0137]  Following incubation, the media is removed, centrifuged, and stored for analysis (see VEGF and EPO assays below), the cells are washed two times in cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed in 1 mL of 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% IGEPAL (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO), and a protease inhibitor mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 15 minutes on ice. Cell lysates are centrifuged at 3,000 xg for 5 minutes at 4 °C, and the cytosolic fractions (supernatant) are collected. The nuclei (pellet) are resuspended and lysed in 100 µL of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and a protease mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), centrifuged at 13,000 xg for 5 minutes at 4 °C, and the nuclear protein fractions (supernatant) are collected.<br>
[0138] Nuclear fractions are analyzed for HIF-1α using a QUANTIKINE immunoassay (R&amp;D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
ii.         Cell-based VEGF and EPO ELISA assays<br>
[0139] Conditioned media collected from cell cultures as described above is analyzed for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and/or erythropoietin (EPO) expression using an appropriate QUANTIKINE immunoassay (R&amp;D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
iii.        HIF-PH assay<br>
[0140] Ketoglutaric acid a-[l-14C]-sodium salt, alpha-ketoglutaric acid sodium salt, and HPLC purified peptide may be obtained from commercial sources, e.g., Perkin-Elmcr (Wellesley MA), Sigma-Aldrich, and SynPep Corp. (Dublin CA), respectively. Peptides for use in the assay may be fragments of HIFα as described above or as disclosed in International Publication WO 2005/118836, incorporated by reference herein. HIF-PH, e.g., HIF-PH2 (EGLN1), can be expressed in, e.g., insect Hi5 cells, and partially purified, e.g., through a SP ion exchange chromatography column. Enzyme activity is determined by capturing 14CO2 using an assay<br><br>
described by Kivirikko and Myllyla (1982, Methods Enzymol 82:245-304). Assay reactions contain 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 µM α-ketoglutaric acid sodium salt, 0.30 µCi/ml ketoglutaric acid α-[l-14C]-sodiumsalt, 40 µM FeSO4, lmM ascorbate, 1541.8 units/mL Catalase, with or without 50 µM peptide substrate and various concentrations of compound of the invention. Reactions are initiated by addition of HIF-PH enzyme.<br>
[0141] The peptide-dependent percent turnover is calculated by subtracting percent turnover in the absence of peptide from percent turnover in the presence of substrate peptide. Percent inhibition and IC50 are calculated using peptide-dependent percent turnover at given inhibitor concentrations. Calculation of IC50 values for each inhibitor is conducted using GraFit software (Erithacus Software Ltd., Surrey UK).<br>
[0142]    All of the compounds of this invention were active in at least one of these assays.<br>
6.         Pharmaceutical formulations and routes of administration<br>
[0143] The compositions of the present invention can be delivered directly or in pharmaceutical compositions along with suitable carriers or excipients, as is well known in the art. Present methods of treatment can comprise administration of an effective amount of a compound of the invention to a subject in need; e.g., a subject having or at risk for anemia due to, e.g., chronic renal failure, diabetes, cancer, AIDS, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, kidney dialysis, or surgery. In a preferred embodiment, the subject is a mammalian subject, and in a most preferred embodiment, the subject is a human subject.<br>
[0144] An effective amount of such agents can readily be determined by routine experimentation, as can the most effective and convenient route of administration, and the most appropriate formulation. Various formulations and drug delivery systems are available in the art. See, e.g., Gennaro, A.R., ed. (1995) Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra.<br>
[0145]  Suitable routes of administration may, for example, include oral, rectal, topical, nasal, pulmonary, ocular, intestinal, and parenteral administration. Primary routes for parenteral administration include intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous administration. Secondary routes of administration include intraperitoneal, intra-arterial, intra-articular, intracardiac, intracisternal, intradermal, intralesional, intraocular, intrapleural, intrathecal, intrauterine, and intraventricular administration. The indication to be treated, along with the physical, chemical,<br><br>
and biological properties of the drug, dictate the type of formulation and the route of administration to be used, as well as whether local or systemic delivery would be preferred.<br>
[0146] Pharmaceutical dosage forms of a compound of the invention may be provided in an instant release, controlled release, sustained release, or target drug-delivery system. Commonly used dosage forms include, for example, solutions and suspensions, (micro-) emulsions, ointments, gels and patches, liposomes, tablets, dragees, soft or hard shell capsules, suppositories, ovules, implants, amorphous or crystalline powders, aerosols, and lyophilized formulations. Depending on route of administration used, special devices may be required for application or administration of the drug, such as, for example, syringes and needles, inhalers, pumps, injection pens, applicators, or special flasks. Pharmaceutical dosage forms are often composed of the drug, an excipient(s), and a container/closure system. One or multiple excipients, also referred to as inactive ingredients, can be added to a compound of the invention to improve or facilitate manufacturing, stability, administration, and safety of the drug, and can provide a means to achieve a desired drug release profile. Therefore, the type of excipient(s) to be added to the drug can depend on various factors, such as, for example, the physical and chemical properties of the drug, the route of administration, and the manufacturing procedure. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are available in the art and include those listed in various pharmacopoeias. (See, e.g., the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP), European Pharmacopoeia (EP), and British pharmacopeia (BP); the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (www.fda.gov) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CEDR) publications, e.g., Inactive Ingredient Guide (1996); Ash and Ash, Eds. (2002) Handbook of Pharmaceutical Additives, Synapse Information Resources, Inc., Endicott NY; etc.)<br>
[0147] Pharmaceutical dosage forms of a compound of the present invention may be manufactured by any of the methods well-known in the art, such as, for example, by conventional mixing, sieving, dissolving, melting, granulating, dragee-making, tabletting, suspending, extruding, spray-drying, levigating, emulsifying, (nano/micro-) encapsulating, entrapping, or lyophilization processes. As noted above, the compositions of the present invention can include one or more physiologically acceptable inactive ingredients that facilitate processing of active molecules into preparations for pharmaceutical use.<br>
[0148] Proper formulation is dependent upon the desired route of administration. For intravenous injection, for example, the composition may be formulated in aqueous solution, if necessary using physiologically compatible buffers, including, for example, phosphate, histidine, or citrate for<br><br>
adjustment of the formulation pH, and a tonicity agent, such as, for example, sodium chloride or dextrose. For transmucosal or nasal administration, semisolid, liquid formulations, or patches may be preferred, possibly containing penetration enhancers. Such penetrants are generally known in the art. For oral administration, the compounds can be formulated in liquid or solid dosage forms, and as instant or controlled/sustained release formulations. Suitable dosage forms for oral ingestion by a subject include tablets, pills, dragces, hard and soft shell capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions, and emulsions- The compounds may also be formulated in rectal compositions, such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
[9149] Solid oral dosage forms can be obtained using excipients, which may include fillers, disintegrants, binders (dry and wet), dissolution retardants, lubricants, glidants, antiadherants, cationic exchange resins, wetting agents, antioxidants, preservatives, coloring, and flavoring agents. These excipients can be of synthetic or natural source. Examples of such excipients include cellulose derivatives, citric acid, dicalcium phosphate, gelatine, magnesium carbonate, magnesium/sodium lauryl sulfate, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, silicates, silicium dioxide, sodium benzoate, sorbitol, starches, stearic acid or a salt thereof, sugars (i.e. dextrose, sucrose, lactose, etc.), talc, tragacanth mucilage, vegetable oils (hydrogenated), and waxes. Ethanol and water may serve as granulation aides. In certain instances, coating of tablets with, for example, a taste-masking film, a stomach acid resistant film, or a release-retarding film is desirable. Natural and synthetic polymers, in combination with colorants, sugars, and organic solvents or water, are often used to coat tablets, resulting in dragees. When a capsule is preferred over a tablet, the drug powder, suspension, or solution thereof can be delivered in a compatible hard or soft shell capsule.<br>
[0159] In one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention can be administered topically, such as through a skin patch, a semi-solid, or a liquid formulation, for example a gel, a (micro-) emulsion, an ointment, a solution, a (nano/micro)-suspension, or a foam. The penetration of the drug into the skin and underlying tissues can be regulated, for example, using penetration enhancers; the appropriate choice and combination of lipophilic, hydrophilic, and amphiphilic excipients, including water, organic solvents, waxes, oils, synthetic and natural polymers, surfactants, emulsifiers; by pH adjustment; and use of complexing agents. Other techniques, such as iontophoresis, may be used to regulate skin penetration of a compound of the invention. Transdermal or topical administration would be preferred, for example, in situations in which local delivery with minimal systemic exposure is desired.<br><br>
[0151] For administration by inhalation, or administration to the nose, the compounds for use according to the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of a solution, suspension, emulsion, or semisolid aerosol from pressurized packs, or a nebuliser, usually with the use of a propellant, e.g., halogenated carbons dervided from methan and ethan, carbon dioxide, or any other suitable gas. For topical aerosols, hydrocarbons like butane, isobutene, and pentane are useful. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the appropriate dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, for example, gelatin, for use in an inhaler or insufflator, may be formulated. These typically contain a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
[0152] Compositions formulated for parenteral administration by injection are usually sterile and, can be presented in unit dosage forms, e.g., in ampoules, syringes, injection pens, or in multi-dose containers, the latter usually containing a preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents, such as buffers, tonicity agents, viscosity enhancing agents, surfactants, suspending and dispersing agents, antioxidants, biocompatible polymers, chelating agents, and preservatives. Depending on the injection site, the vehicle may contain water, a synthetic or vegetable oil, and/or organic co-solvents. In certain instances, such as with a lyophilized product or a concentrate, the parenteral formulation would be reconstituted or diluted prior to administration. Depot formulations, providing controlled or sustained release of a compound of the invention, may include injectable suspensions of nano/micro particles or nano/micro or non-micronized crystals. Polymers such as poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid), or copolymers thereof, can serve as controlled/sustained release matrices, in addition to others well known in the art. Other depot delivery systems may be presented in form of implants and pumps requiring incision.<br>
[0153] Suitable carriers for intravenous injection for the molecules of the invention are well-known in the art and include water-based solutions containing a base, such as, for example, sodium hydroxide, to form an ionized compound, sucrose or sodium chloride as a tonicity agent, for example, the buffer contains phosphate or histidine. Co-solvents, such as, for example, polyethylene glycols, may be added. These water-based systems are effective at dissolving compounds of the invention and produce low toxicity upon systemic administration. The proportions of the components of a solution system may be varied considerably, without destroying solubility and toxicity characteristics. Furthermore, the identity of the components may be varied. For example, low-toxicity surfactants, such as polysorbates or poloxamers, may be<br><br>
used, as can polyethylene glycol or other co-solvents, biocotnpatible polymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone may be added, and other sugars and polyols may substitute for dextrose.<br>
[0154] A therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially using a variety of techniques well-known in the art. Initial doses used in animal studies may be based on effective concentrations established in cell culture assays. Dosage ranges appropriate for human subjects can be determined, for example, using data obtained from animal studies and cell culture assays.<br>
[0155]  An effective amount or a therapeutically effective amount or dose of an agent, e.g., a compound of the invention, refers to that amount of the agent or compound that results in amelioration of symptoms or a prolongation of survival in a subject. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such molecules can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., by determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio of toxic to therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, which can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ ED50. Agents that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred.<br>
[0156] The effective amount or therapeutically effective amount is the amount of the compound or pharmaceutical composition that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. Dosages preferably fall within a range of circulating concentrations that includes the ED50 with little or no toxicity. Dosages may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and/or the route of administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of administration, dosage, and dosage interval should be chosen according to methods known in the art, in view of the specifics of a subject's condition.<br>
[0157] Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the active moiety that are sufficient to achieve the desired effects; i.e., the minimal effective concentration (MEC). The MEC will vary for each compound but can be estimated from, for example, in vitro data and animal experiments. Dosages necessary to achieve the MEC will depend on individual characteristics and route of administration. In cases of local administration or selective uptake, the effective local concentration of the drug may not be related to plasma concentration.<br><br>
[0158] The amount of agent or composition administered may be dependent on a variety of factors, including the sex, age, and weight of the subject being treated, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration, and the judgment of the prescribing physician.<br>
[0159] The present compositions may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device containing one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. Such a pack or device may, for example, comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack, or glass, and rubber stoppers such as in vials. The pack or dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration. Compositions comprising a compound of the invention formulated in a compatible pharmaceutical carrier may also be prepared, placed in an appropriate container, and labeled for treatment of an indicated condition.<br>
