				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention particularly relates to the extraction of aromatics from heavy<br>
naphtha, kerosene and gas oil range petroleum fractions with the aid of a<br>
suitable polar organic solvent and re-extracting the extract phase with a Ce-C/<br>
paraffinic solvent7<br>
Different petroleum fractions obtained in crude distillation unit contain varying<br>
concentration of aromatics depending upon crude oil source. These aromatics<br>
are required to be removed to produce various end products meeting the<br>
specifications with respect to aromatics. For example:<br>
Naphtha used as feedstock in petrochemical industry for the production of olefins<br>
should not contain more than 5% of aromatics due to refractory nature of<br>
aromatics. While in the case of fertiliser industry limitation of aromatics (
naphtha feedstock is due to higher carbon to hydrogen ratio which in turn affects<br>
the hydrogen yield.<br>
Refining of kerosene fractions is done in order to produce superior kerosene<br>
(SK)/ aviation turbine fuel (ATF). These end products should meet BIS<br>
specification requirements of smoke point, freezing point (for ATF) and aromatic<br>
content on which performance of these products depends.<br>
High aromatic content in gas oil fraction results in lowering of cetane number. In<br>
order to improve the cetane number the reduction of aromatics is essential.<br>
Hydrofming and solvent extraction are the conventional processes for<br>
dearomatization. However, severe operating conditions such as high partial<br>
pressure of hydrogen and high hydrogen consumption are required for high<br>
aromatic feed stocks, which make the process highly capital cost intensive<br>
compared to solvent extraction. For example for dearomatisation of kerosene<br>
fractions from Assam crude oils, being rich in aromatics solvent extraction is<br>
employed. Presently, there are three refineries in the eastern part of our country<br>
where kerosene fractions are dearomatized using liquid sulphur dioxide as the<br>
solvent (Edeleanu, L. British Patent 11,140 May 22, 1908). Considering present<br>
growth in technology development and environment awareness, this is an<br>
obsolete process. It has several drawbacks. The main drawbacks are :<br>
(1) Liquid sulphur dioxide is highly corrosive in presence of traces of water,<br>
therefore, drying of feed and solvent is an important step.<br>
(2) There is occasional failure of ATF produced by this process.<br>
(3) The number of columns used for solvent recovery from raffinate and<br>
extract phases is too large.<br>
(4) Extraction temperature is as low as -15°C thus requires refrigeration<br>
To overcome the above drawbacks Indian Institute of Petroleum, Dehra<br>
Dun, Engineers India Limited, New Delhi and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation<br>
Limited, Mumbai have jointly developed a process for refining kerosene fraction<br>
(140-240°C) which uses sulpholane as the solvent (Patent No. 170747, 23 Mar<br>
1987) employing conventional extraction route. In this process scheme the<br>
recovery of solvent from extract phase is carried out by distillation. This approach<br>
is successful for systems constituting feed and solvents having wide difference of<br>
boiling points. However, this process consumes significant energy for the<br>
recovery of hydrocarbons, due to requirement of stringent operating conditions.<br>
Moreover, processing of feeds having wide boiling range e.g. naphtha to gas oil<br>
in the same unit using block out operations is not feasible due to over lapping of<br>
boiling points with the solvent. For such application solvent extraction in<br>
combination with re-extraction route for solvent recovery is feasible approach.<br>
Re-extraction concept for the recovery of aromatics from extract phase is<br>
reported to have been used commercially e.g., for the production of pure<br>
benzene and toluene by Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) process [Hydrocarbon<br>
Processing, 45, (5), 188, 1966]. Handling of low thermal stability solvent is the<br>
main drawback of this process. Improvement of cetane number of LCCO<br>
[Hydrocarbon Processing, 46, (9), 134, 1967] using Dimethyl formamide (DMF),<br>
production of high boiling aromatics by using N-Formyl Morpholine (NFM)<br>
[Hydrocarbon Processing, 51, (4), 141,1972], production of pure benzene and<br>
toluene from pyrolysis gasoline by using Tetraethyleneglycol [DE 3,409,307 Sept<br>
1985 and ISEC 1971] have also been tried. Re-extraction of aromatics from<br>
extract phase of kerosene fractions is also reported by Muller, et. at. [DE<br>
3,207,404; 8 Sept 1983] and Lobov [Nauchn. Osn. Pererab.Negti Gaza<br>
Neftekhim., Tezisy Dokl., Vses. Knof. 234-5, 1977]. The solvent tried in the<br>
former work was N-Methyl pyrolidinone (NMP) containing 6% water while the reextraction<br>
was done by n-hexane, while in the latter work the feed used was<br>
kerosene fraction 200-270°C and solvent used was DMF while the re-extraction<br>
solvent was n-heptane. In all these processes the lean solvent obtained from<br>
bottom of the re-extraction column is directly re-circulated back to the main<br>
extraction column without removing the re-extraction solvent. Drawbacks of this<br>
process scheme are:<br>
- Difficulty in maintaining the extraction solvent composition<br>
- Contamination of raffmate phase with re-extraction solvent<br>
- Requirement of additional fractionator for removal of re-extraction<br>
solvent from raffinate<br>
- Requirement of stringent operating conditions in water-solvent<br>
fractionator due to higher boiling point of solvents<br>
- RE-extraction solvent such as n-hexane &amp; n-heptane being pure<br>
hydrocarbons are costly<br>
in the present work a modified process scheme has been developed for the<br>
extraction of aromatics from petroleum fractions i.e. naphtha, kerosene and gas<br>
oil, using re-extraction route for recovery of solvent. The novelty of the present<br>
invention lies in:<br>
- Proposed invention provides unique feasibility to dearomatize three<br>
feed stocks of different boiling range namely Heavy Naphtha,<br>
Kerosene and Gas Oil using an eco-friendly solvent such as NMP.<br>
- Single plant can be used in blocked out mode of operation to produce<br>
additional products such as high octane benzene free stock for<br>
gasoline pool, high Cetane Diesel, high aromatic solvent and feedstock<br>
for needle coke production. This is the unique feature of the<br>
invention as no such process has been reported so far to produce<br>
these value-added products from a single unit.<br>
- Use of refinery cut light naphtha cut as re-extraction solvent<br>
- The invention facilitates the controllability of the severity of extraction<br>
while in operation, through manipulating anti-solvent composition<br>
depending upon feed characteristics and target product specification.<br>
- The invention allows the production; of dearomatised raffinate free of<br>
re-extraction solvent.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for<br>
the extraction of aromatics from petroleum streams, which obviates the<br>
drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide modified process wherein<br>
solvent extraction of aromatics from aromatic rich petroleum fractions to obtain<br>
the products e.g. high octane aromatic extract for Motor Sprit pool, superior<br>
kerosene, high cetane gas oil and speciality solvents for particular end use.<br>
Yet another objective of the process is to achieve savings in capital cost by<br>
eliminating raffinate-re-extraction solvent fractionator.<br>
Still another objective is to reduce operating cost by saving in utilities by using<br>
heat integration of hot and cold streams.<br>
Yet another objective of the process is to produce superior quality special boiling<br>
point solvents.<br>
In the present invention therefore, the aromatics are separated from nonaromatics<br>
from the feedstocks by extraction using polar organic solvent. The<br>
solvent used here is N-Methyl pyrolidinone admixed with water, glycols,<br>
sulpholane etc.<br>
The flow diagram of the present invention is shown in Fig.1 of the drawing<br>
accompanying this specification.<br>
The petroleum fraction stream is introduced through line (1) and lean solvent is<br>
introduced via line (2) into the extractor-A where the two streams meet<br>
countercurrently. The extract phase, thus produced, is introduced via line (4) in<br>
the extractor-B, which meets the Ce-C? petroleum fraction (63-69°C cut) countercurrently,<br>
entering via line (5). The raffinate phase produced is fed to raffinate<br>
wash column-E via line (3) where it is washed with water. The two contact zones<br>
may comprise either a packed or a sieve plate column.<br>
The top phase which leaves the extractor-B via line (6) is water washed in extract<br>
wash column-C and then enters via line (8) in the distillation column-D where it is<br>
fractionated to yield aromatic extract which is collected via line (11) and C6-C7<br>
petroleum fraction, which is re-circulated to extractor-B via line (5). The bottom of<br>
extractor-B enters to solvent recovery column-F via line (7). Hydrocarbons from<br>
the top of solvent recovery column (SRC) are routed to column-D via line (15).<br>
One part of water is recycled back to extract wash column-C via line (10).<br><br>
Another part of water is recycled back to raffinate wash column-E routed through water stripper-G via line (14). Washed raffinate is taken from line (12). The lean solvent from the bottom of solvent recovery column-F is re-circulated back to extractor-A via line (2). Water containing the solvent is fed to solvent recovery column-F via lines (9) and (13) used as striping stream.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the extraction of aromatics<br>
from aromatic rich petroleum streams which comprises:<br>
a)	Characterized in that contacting aromatic rich petroleum streams feed with a polar organic solvent containing 2-20 wt% anti solvent at a temperature in the range of 20 - 80°C in a extractor-A column to obtain a extract phase and a raffinate phase,<br>

In yet another embodiment of the present invention ratio of solvent mixture to<br>
feed is in the range of 1:1 to 5:1wt%.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention feed and extraction<br>

In still another embodiment of the present invention recovery of solvent from<br>
top phase of extractor-B and raffinate phase is done by known method such<br>
as water washing at a temperature of 30-40°C.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention recovery of secondary<br>
solvent from top of the extractor-B is affected by using conventional method<br>
such as distillation at atmospheric pressure at a temperature of 110 - 300 °C<br>
