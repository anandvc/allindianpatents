				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>[0001] The invention relates to a security element for protecting documents of value,<br>
which has magnetic material. Furthermore, the invention relates to a document of value, a<br>
transfer material and method for producing such security elements and documents of value<br>
as well as a method and an apparatus for checking such a security element or document of<br>
value.<br>
[0002] Documents of value within the terms of the invention can be bank notes, but also<br>
share certificates, deeds, stamps, checks, admission tickets, tickets, flight tickets, identity<br>
cards, visa stickers and the like as well as labels, seals, packagings, security paper or other<br>
elements for the product protection. The simplifying designation "document of value" or<br>
"security element" will hereinafter therefore always include documents of the stated type.<br>
[0003] It is known that bank notes have magnetic material, which is used for the<br>
verification of the authenticity of the bank notes. Such magnetic material is for example a<br>
component of printing inks and is applied onto the bank notes during the printing of the<br>
bank notes. The distribution of the magnetic material produced in the printing can be<br>
determined and can be compared to a reference value in order to check the authenticity of<br>
the bank notes. It is furthermore known that magnetic material can be contained in security<br>
elements applied onto the bank note. Thus for example security threads can have magnetic<br>
material, which can also be applied in such a manner that the security threads have a<br>
coding which can be used for checking the authenticity of the bank note and/or to<br>
determine the type of bank note (currency, denomination).<br>
[0004] It is a problem of such security elements or documents of value with magnetic<br>
material that the magnetic material and thus codings contained therein can be detected at<br>
any time. This results in the danger that the security elements or documents of value can be<br>
forged without any major problems, since the distribution of the magnetic material can be<br>
imitated due to its easy detectability.<br><br>
[0005] The invention is therefore based on the problem of creating a document of value, a<br>
transfer element and a security element which shall be simple to produce and guarantee a<br>
high degree of protection from forgery.<br>
[0006] It is further the problem of the invention to provide methods for producing such a<br>
security element and document of value as well as a method and an apparatus for checking<br>
the security element or document of value.<br>
[0007] These problems are solved by the features of the independent claims. Developments<br>
are subject of the subclaims.<br>
[0008] According to the invention the security element has at least two magnetic materials,<br>
wherein the magnetic materials have different coercive field strengths and are applied onto<br>
and/or incorporated in the security element in such a way that their remanence is equal.<br>
[0009] The equal remanence of the magnetic materials is preferably achieved by different<br>
layer thicknesses and/or different concentrations of the magnetic materials.<br>
[0010] For the magnetic materials according to the invention within the framework of the<br>
invention numerous variation possibilities are expedient. Thus the magnetic materials can<br>
be provided in certain areas, in particular in the form of characters or patterns, wherein it is<br>
especially preferred to apply the different materials directly adjoining each other.<br>
[0011] The security element can either be produced directly on the document of value or<br>
prepared on a separate substrate. With respect to the material used, the document of value<br>
or the separate substrate, on which the security element is located, is in no way restricted.<br>
But preferably it is paper or plastic, also in the form of foils. In the case of a separate<br>
substrate the security element can be designed, for example, as a self-supporting label,<br>
preferably on a plastic substrate. In particular, the security element is designed in the form<br>
of a security thread.<br><br>
[0012] Since in some cases it may be difficult to provide the document of value directly<br>
with the magnetic materials, therefore, alternatively, it may be expedient to prepare the<br>
structure of the security element at least partially on a transfer material.<br>
[0013] Therein the magnetic materials of the security element can be applied onto and/or<br>
incorporated in a substrate in an endless form, which substrate is or will be connected with<br>
a carrier tape. The fastening as a security element on a document of value to be protected is<br>
effected with the aid of an adhesive layer, which either is applied onto the document of<br>
value or onto the topmost layer of the transfer material. Preferably, for this a hot-melt<br>
adhesive is used. In order to determine the outline form of the security element, there either<br>
can be provided an adhesive layer only in the areas to be transferred, or the adhesive, such<br>
as for example a hot-melt adhesive, is activated only in the areas to be transferred. After<br>
the transfer the carrier tape of the transfer material is stripped off and merely the security<br>
element remains on the document of value to be secured.<br>
[0014] The document of value, onto which the security element is applied, can be, for<br>
example, a security paper, a security document, but also product packagings. Other objects<br>
of value, for which a protection in terms of security is required, of course can also be<br>
provided with the security element according to the invention.<br>
[0015] Further advantages and embodiments of the invention are explained in more detail<br>
with reference to the Figures. The proportions (in particular layer thicknesses) shown in the<br>
Figures do not necessarily correspond to the dimensions present in reality and primarily<br>
serve for the improvement of clarity.<br>
[0016] For clarity's sake the invention is explained in more detail only with reference to a<br>
bank note. But it is obvious that the invention can be used without any problems for the<br>
above-mentioned documents of value.<br>
[0017] The figures of the accompanying drawings are described as follows :<br><br>
[0018] Figure 1	a bank note with a security element according to the invention,<br>
[0019] Figures 2 and 3 various embodiments of the security element according to Figure 1<br>
in cross section,<br>
[0020] Figure 4	a further embodiment of a bank note with a security element<br>
according to the invention,<br>
[0021] Figure 5	an embodiment of an apparatus for checking the security element<br>
according to the invention, and<br>
[0022] Figure 6	exemplary hysteresis curves of magnetic materials used for the<br>
security element according to the invention.<br>
[0023] Figure 1 shows a bank note 1 made of paper or plastic, which is provided with a<br>
security element 2 in the form of a strip extending over the entire width of the bank note 1.<br>
The bank note 1 of course can have further security features, such as watermark, steel<br>
gravure print, security thread, luminescent prints, etc.<br>
[0024] The security element 2 is disposed on the bank note 1, e. g. printed, bonded,<br>
incorporated in the bank note 1 etc. The security element 2 has areas with magnetic<br>
materials 3a, 3b, which have different coercive field strengths. However, the remanence<br>
resulting for the areas 3a, 3b is equally high. This can be achieved e. g. by a corresponding<br>
choice of layer thickness of the areas 3a, 3b and/or by a corresponding choice of<br>
concentration of the magnetic materials 3a, 3b in the areas.<br>
[0025] Some preferred embodiments are explained in more detail with reference to the<br>
Figures 2 and 3, which show the bank note 1 in cross section along the dash-dotted line A -<br>
A, so as to illustrate the structure of the security element 2.<br><br>
[0026] According to Figure 2 the paper substrate or plastic substrate of the bank note 1 is<br>
provided with a layer 3 with different magnetic materials 3a, 3b in the form of surface<br>
areas, characters, patterns, etc. In order to improve the applying of the layer 3, e. g. by<br>
printing, in particular for a paper substrate it can be provided that a so-called primer layer<br>
is applied onto the paper substrate. The primer layer can be, for example, a colorless plastic<br>
layer or an ink layer, the surface of which has an only low roughness.<br>
[0027] With certain embodiments, e.g. security elements which when used are subject to a<br>
heavy mechanical or chemical load, it is expedient to cover the magnetic materials 3a, 3b<br>
with a protection layer 4. The protection layer 4 can be a foil laminated over the security<br>
element 2 or a protective lacquer layer. Therein the protective lacquer layer can be applied<br>
all-over or in partial areas. For this purpose e.g. UV lacquers, hybrid lacquers, oil-based<br>
lacquers or dispersion lacquers of the one- or two-component type can be used. The<br>
protective lacquer layer preferably is printed, e.g. by flexographic printing or offset<br>
printing.<br>
[0028] Likewise, the security element 2 can be a separate element which is adapted to be<br>
applied onto the bank note 1. The separate security element 2 can have a structure which<br>
corresponds to the structure described with reference to Figure 3. In this case a substrate 5<br>
of the security element 2, e. g. a plastic foil, is bonded to the bank note 1. The substrate 5<br>
of the security element 2 has a layer 3 with magnetic materials 3a, 3b. For this purpose the<br>
plastic forming the substrate 5 can be a hot-melt adhesive. For the protection of the layer 3a protection layer 4 can be provided.<br>
[0029] Deviating therefrom, in and/or onto the substrate 5 a layer 3 with magnetic<br>
materials 3a, 3b can be applied, onto which finally an adhesive layer 6 is applied, by means<br>
of which the security element 2 is fastened to the bank note 1. The adhesive used for this<br>
purpose can be a hot-melt adhesive. In this case an additional protective layer can be<br>
omitted, since such layer is formed by the substrate 5.<br><br>
[0030] In all cases described above instead of onto the security element 2 the adhesive can<br>
also be applied onto the bank note 1 in order to fasten the security element 2 to the bank<br>
note 1.<br>
[0031] A further embodiment of a bank note 1 with security element 2 is shown in Figure<br>
4. The security element 2 at least partially is embedded in the substrate of the bank note 1,<br>
so that the security element 2, which e.g. is a. security thread, is visible only in certain areas<br>
2a, so-called „windows". However, the security element 2 can also be completely<br>
embedded in the substrate of the bank note 1. In both cases the magnetic materials 3a, 3b<br>
can be detected.<br>
[0032] The security element 2 can also be designed as a transfer material, with a structure<br>
such as described with reference to the Figures 1 to 3. In this case the layer structure is<br>
applied in reverse order onto a transfer material. The security element 2 is applied onto the<br>
bank note with the help of the transfer material and the transfer material thereafter is<br>
entirely or partially removed.<br>
[0033] The security element 2 can also be designed as a so-called planchet, which<br>
preferably is incorporated in the surface of the bank note substrate.<br>
[0034] As described above the security element 2 can be produced directly on the bank<br>
note 1 or provided as a separate security element 2 and fastened to the bank note 1. But it<br>
can also be provided to provide a separate security element 2, whose structure is not<br>
completed until the security element 2 has been fastened to the bank note 1, e.g. is<br>
provided with a protection layer.<br>
[0035] Fig. 5 shows an embodiment of an apparatus for checking the security element 2<br>
according to the invention.<br>
[0036] Figure 5a shows a first magnetizing device 6, which consists of two magnets 6a and<br>
6b. In the shown example the magnets 6a and 6b are arranged with their north poles<br><br>
pointing toward each other. However, it is also possible to arrange the magnets 6a and 6b<br>
with their south poles pointing toward each other. Through the gap formed between the<br>
magnets 6a and 6b a not shown transportation device can guide the bank notes to be<br>
checked with the security element 2 along a transport direction T. The security element 2<br>
preferably has areas adjoining each other with magnetic materials 3a, 3b which have<br>
different coercive field strengths, whereas their remanence is equally high.<br>
[0037] In Figure 6 exemplary hysteresis curves of magnetic materials 3a and 3b used for<br>
the security element 2 according to the invention are shown. As it can be clearly<br>
recognized, the first magnetic material 3a has a coercive field strength Ka which is higher<br>
than the coercive field strength Kb of the second magnetic material 3b. The remanence R of<br>
the two magnetic materials 3a and 3b, however, is equally high, wherein slight deviations<br>
are admissible. The used magnetic materials 3a and 3b are magnetically hard materials,<br>
which can e. g. be present in the form of pigments, in order to be incorporated in the<br>
security element 2 in the above-described manner. The magnetic materials 3a and 3b can<br>
for example be Fe3O4 magnet pigments, which are available with different coercive field<br>
strengths, e. g. from the company BASF. For example the first magnetic material 3a, with<br>
the higher coercive field strength Ka, can have a coercive field strength of 28 kA/m,<br>
whereas the second magnetic material 3b, with the lower coercive field strength Kb, can<br>
have a coercive field strength of 18 kA/m or 21 kA/m.<br>
[0038] The first magnetizing device 6 shown in Figure 5a has a field strength which is<br>
higher than the highest coercive field strength of the used magnetic materials 3a and 3b,<br>
thus higher than the coercive field strength Ka of the first magnetic material 3a. By this<br>
means, during the passage of the bank note or of the security element 2 both the first<br>
magnetic material 3a and the second magnetic material 3b are magnetized, so that the<br>
magnetic materials 3a and 3b have an orientation ma and mb, corresponding to the<br>
orientation of the first magnetizing device 6.<br>
[0039] When in the further course the bank note or the security element 2 is transported<br>
past a magnet sensor 8, each change of the magnetic field of the security element 2 results<br><br>
in an impulse, which can be evaluated by an evaluation device 9, for example a<br>
microcomputer, in order to be able to e g. make statements on the authenticity and/or the<br>
type of the bank note. Since, as described above, the remanence of both magnetic materials<br>
3a and 3b is equally high, and since both magnetic materials 3a and 3b have a homogenous<br>
orientation ma and mb, the signal 10 provided by the magnet sensor 8 shows impulses only<br>
at the start and at the end of the security element 2.<br>
[0040] In Figure 5b a second magnetizing device 7 is shown, which consists of two<br>
magnets 7a and 7b. In the shown example the magnets 7a and 7b are arranged with their<br>
south poles pointing toward each other. Generally, the orientation of the magnets 7a and 7b<br>
is to be chosen in such a way that it is contrary to the orientation of the magnets 6a and 6b<br>
of the first magnetizing device 6. Through the gap created between the magnets 7a and 7b<br>
the not shown transportation device can guide the bank note to be checked with the<br>
security element 2 along the transport direction T. The magnetic materials 3a and 3b have<br>
the orientation ma and mb described above with reference to Figure 5a. The second<br>
magnetizing device 6 has a field strength which is higher than the coercive field strength<br>
Kb of the used second magnetic material 3b, but which is lower than the coercive field<br>
strength Ka of the first magnetic material 3a. Thereby during the passage of the bank note<br>
or of the security element 2 the magnetization of only the second magnetic material 3b is<br>
changed, so that the magnetic materials 3a and 3b have a different orientation ma and m'b.<br>
The signal 10' provided by the magnet sensor 8 therefore shows additional impulses in the<br>
areas of the security element 2 in which the magnetic materials 3a and 3b adjoin each<br>
other.<br>
[0041] As is additionally shown in Figure 5b, the second magnetization device 7 can<br>
alternatively also be formed by an electromagnet, which generates an alternating magnetic<br>
field whose field strength is also higher than the coercive field strength Kb of the used<br>
second magnetic material 3b, but which is lower than the coercive field strength Ka of the<br>
first magnetic material 3a. Thereby during the passage of the bank note or of the security<br>
element 2 only the second magnetic material 3b is demagnetized, so that the first magnetic<br>
material 3a still has its orientation ma, whereas the second material 3b no longer has an<br><br>
orientation m"b The signal 10' provided by the magnet sensor 8 therefore in this case<br>
additionally shows impulses in the areas of the security element 2 in which the magnetic<br>
materials 3a and 3b adjoin each other. However, the impulses are smaller than in the case<br>
described beforehand, since the magnetic material 3b no longer has an orientation m"b, and<br>
consequently the change of the field strength of the magnetic field of the security element<br>
2 at the borders between the magnetic materials 3a and 3b is smaller.<br>
[0042] In Figure 5c an exemplary complete structure of an apparatus for checking the<br>
security element 2 according to the invention is shown. The apparatus is composed of the<br>
components shown in Figures 5a and 5b, namely the first magnetizing device 6, the second<br>
magnetizing device 7, which can be optionally formed by magnets 7a, 7b or by an<br>
electromagnet 7, as well as the magnet sensor 8 with the evaluation device 9. By means of<br>
a not shown transportation system bank notes 1 or security elements 2 to be checked can be<br>
transported along the transport direction T through the apparatus. The magnet sensor 8<br>
generates the signal 10' described above in connection with Figure 5b, which signal is used<br>
by the evaluation device 9 for example for checking the authenticity and/or the type<br>
(currency, denomination) of the bank note 1.<br>
[0043] It is obvious that, deviating from the description so far, a plurality of modifications<br>
and variations is possible.<br>
[0044] Instead of the described use of two magnetic materials 3a and 3b for the security<br>
element 2 also three, four or more materials can be used. In this case it is obvious that for<br>
the checking of such a security element three, four or more magnetizing devices have to<br>
used, whose field strengths have to be chosen in accordance with the coercive field<br>
strengths of the used magnetic materials. Likewise, the magnetizing devices have to be<br>
disposed in accordance with their field strength, i. e. viewed in the transport direction, the<br>
magnetizing device with the highest field strength has to be disposed in the first place,<br>
whereas the magnetizing device with the lowest field strength has to be disposed in the last<br>
place. Therein, account must also be taken of the described, respectively contrary<br>
orientation of the magnetic field of the used magnetizing devices.<br><br>
[0045] Furthermore, in addition to the mentioned production of the security element by<br>
means of printing with inks containing different magnetic pigments, any other production<br>
method is possible that permits the selective production of areas with different coercive<br>
field strengths, wherein all areas shall have an essentially equally high remanence. Therein<br>
the magnetic materials can be applied onto and/or incorporated in the substrate.<br>
[0046] Likewise, it is possible to choose any desired size or arrangement of the areas with<br>
different coercive field strengths forming the security element, e. g. due to factors resulting<br>
from the design of the bank note having the security element.<br>
[0047] Likewise, it is possible to arrange the magnetizing devices 6 and 7 deviating from<br>
the description so far. The magnets 6a and 6b of the first magnetizing device 6 can for<br>
example also be arranged with their north pole and south pole pointing toward each other.<br>
In contrast to the magnetization ma, mb shown in Figure 5 a, which is effected parallel to<br>
the plane of the bank note or of the security element 2, in this case the resulting<br>
magnetization is effected perpendicular to the plane of the bank note or of the security<br>
element 2. In the case that also for the second magnetizing device 7 magnets 7a and 7b are<br>
used, these have to be arranged contrarily of course, i. e. in this case the south pole has to<br>
point toward the north pole. The arrangement of the magnets 6a and 6b or of the magnets<br>
7a and 7b described above can of course also be effected in reverse order, as long as the<br>
result is the above-described change of magnetization by the second magnetizing device 7.<br>
It is likewise possible - as described above - to form the second magnetizing device 7 by<br>
means of an electromagnet with an alternating field.<br>
[0048] In the case that the magnetizing devices 6 and 7 are formed by permanent magnets,<br>
these can for example consist of SmCo, NdFeB or SrFe and have the described field<br>
strengths.<br>
[0049] Likewise, it can be provided to eliminate the detectable different orientation ma and<br>
mb after the checking of the security feature formed by means of the magnetic materials 3a<br><br>
and 3b, so that a coincidental detection of the security feature is rendered impossible. For<br>
this purpose, a deleting process can be effected, in which the different orientations ma and<br>
mb are canceled. This can be achieved in such a way that, viewed in the transport direction<br>
T, a third magnetizing device (not shown) is disposed downstream from the magnet sensor<br>
8. The third magnetizing device can for example have a field strength which is higher than<br>
the highest coercive field strength of the used magnetic materials 3a and 3b, thus higher<br>
than the coercive field strength Ka of the first magnetic material 3a. Thereby during the<br>
passage of the bank note or of the security element 2 both the first magnetic material 3a<br>
and the second magnetic material 3b are magnetized, so that the orientation ma and mb of<br>
the magnetic materials 3a and 3b is equal. For this purpose the third magnetizing device<br>
can generate a steady or an alternating field alternatively.<br><br>
