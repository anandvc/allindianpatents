				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to process for the modification of Cassia tora gum  to change its morphological character and increase the zeta potential. The modified C. tora gum of the present invention may advantageously be employed in the paper industry as wet-end additive, as flocculant for backwater treatment in paper industry, for mud settling in sugar industry and as thickner in textile printing etc.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to propose a process for the modification of Cassia tora gum to increase the zeta potential and change the morphology of the gum molecule.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose the simple, cost effective process to modify the physico-chemical properties of C.tora gum in order to make available biopolymer to replace synthetic petrochemical used as flocculant in large scale till todate.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for the modification of Cassia tora gum to change its morphological character and increase the zeta potential by treating the endosperm/gum powder in a cylindrical vessel with ammonia gas under pressure wherein the pressure of ammonia gas is 0.5 kg of 4.5 kg/sq for 5 to 240 min.<br>
Gaseous phase treatment of the gum increases the weight of the gum (1-20%) with corresponding increase in nitrogen content (0.91-1.08%), zeta potential (-20.7 to -28.6) under the gas pressure ranging from 0.5 to 4.5 kg/sq. inch for 5 min to 240 min in cylindrical vessel.<br>
Modified endosperm may be pulverised to 200-250 mesh to make it modified gum for different end users. Treated power gum form lumps during the reaction and may need pulverisation to make the end product in fine powder (200-250 mesh).<br>
As Flocculant<br>
Clarification of sulphited sugarcane juice by the addition of C. fora was compared with guar gum, CMC and Mafloc a synthetic polycrylamide compound. Flocculants (3 ppm) each was added separately and settling rate of mud showed that it is better than guar gum and CMC, while it is quite comparable with Mafloc.<br>
In paper sheet formation, a suspension of solid particles of varied size, shape and composition is caused to flow onto a forming screen. The fibres in the head box stock will be retained on a normal machine wire mesh (75 urn hole) merely as a result of their physical size; therefore, it is the pulp fines and mineral fillers that pass the wire and follow the white water system. In a mill an efficient white-water and broke recovery system normally run above 95 per cent. Synthetic polymers cationic in nature are normally used by mills to flocculate suspended fines in back water. CTM (modified) was used to treat the back water (pH 5.5, suspended solid 3936 mg/1) to recover the suspended fines and its performance compared with Trufloc and Deftech 706. 4 ppm of each flocculants were used to treat the back water, recovery percent of the suspended solids in the case of trufloc and Deftech 706 was 98.7 while C. tora modified showed the recovery upto 99.6 per cent. Beater Additive in Paper Making<br>
Beater adhesives are employed in improving sheet formation, fibre to fibre bonding, improve drainage properties, reduce power requirements and conserve long fibre pulps. A general effect of adhesives (gums, starches etc.) are to advance beating to obtain higher strength, which could be achieved otherwise with prolonged beating.<br>
Two types of bleached pulps, one consisting of approximately 80% Eucalyptus, 12% bamboo, 8% pine; and second consisting of 80% bagasse, 20% softwood bleached pulp with pulp brighness 74% and 81% respectively were used for study in laboratory. Addition of 0.25 - 0.5 per cent dosage of CTM showed that:<br>
Freeness of pulp decreased by about 50-85 mL CSF, Burst factor increased by 15 to 26%, follding strength increased by 35-37%, breaking length increased marginally (in pulp 1). Breaking length increased by (26-29%) and folding strength 84-146% (in pulp 2, on addition 0.5% CTM).<br>
SEM studies show that treatment of the endosperm/gum of C tora with ammonia under pressure changes the morphological character of the gum. SEM overview photograph of native gum shows that gum is composed of rhomboidal, micaceous and rod like shape crystals. SEM of the modified gum (increase wt. 5.8%) shows change in the morphology of gum, and reveal the presence of bushy, ribbon, orthorhombic like crystals.<br>
Rheological behaviour of CTM showed that with increase in nitrogen content of the modified product, viscosity increases at same level of concentration.<br>
Viscosity of C. tora modified<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
Similarly Zeta potential of the modified gum increases with increase in the nitrogen content of the modified product.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
Pilot Plant Trial<br>
Paper machine trial was conducted in a mill which is based on agriculture residue i.e. rice straw (10-12%), wheat straw (45%) and sarkanda (45%) producing writing paper. The additive (CTM) was added in a tank consisting of pulp from rice straw, wheat straw and sarkanda (88%) and cotton linter (6%) and white cutting (6%) and pumped to head box directly.<br>
It was found that at 0.25% addition of CTM, properties of the paper are more or less as compared with paper being produced by the mill using 0.5% of Higum (guar gum). The capacity of the paper was increased from 89.2 to 93.93%, apparent density, breaking length (MD, CD), Tear factor, Burst Index, brightness were almost same vis-avis guar gum. Advantage of using CTM would provide lot of financial gain due to use of lesser quantity of CTM (0.25% in comparison to 0.5% guar gum) and with substantially reduced cost per unit (tonne/tonne). As Thickner in Textile printing<br>
Thickner used in textile printing are high molecular weight compounds giving viscous pastes in water. Their main function is to hold or adhere the dye particles in the desired place on the fabric until the transfer of the dye into the fabric and its fixation is complete. Cassia tora gum (natural &amp; modified), sodium alginate and blends thereof were taken as thickner for printing using hot and cold brand reactive dyes. Colour value (K/S), fastness and stiffness of the prints were determined. 5-7 per cent of C. tora native and modified gum can be used alone or as blend upto 50:50 for obtaining the same K/S value as obtainable with sodium alginate.<br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:-<br>
1. A process for the modification of Cassia tora gum to change its morphological character and increase the zeta potential by treating the endosperm/gum powder in a cylindrical vessel with ammonia gas under pressure wherein the pressure of ammonia gas is 0.5 kg of 4.5 kg/sq for 5 to 240 min.<br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the treatment is carried<br>
out for a period of 5 to 30 mins.<br>
3.	A process for the modification of Cassia tora gum substantially as<br>
herein described.<br><br><br></td>
