				<td>THERMOPLASTIC MOLDING COMPOSITION HAVING IMPROVED TOUGHNESS AT LOW TEMPERATURES AND SURFACE APPEARANCE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to a thermoplastic molding composition and in particular to an impact modified polycarbonate composition.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thermoplastic compositions containing aromatic polycarbonate, polyalkylene terephthalate and an elastomeric impact modifier are known and available commercially. The impact modifiers thus suitable include acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (ABS) or methyl methacrylate-butadiene-styrene copolymer (MBS).<br>
The published art is noted to include U.S. Patents 5,104,934 and 5,082,897 that disclosed thermoplastic molding compositions containing polycarbonate, polyesters and ABS or ASA (acrylate-styrene-acrylonitrile). These compositions are said to exhibit enhanced moldability, heat resistance and thick section impact resistance. Also relevant is U.S. Patent 4,554,315 that disclosed a thermoplastic molding composition containing polyester resin, polycarbonate resin, and a graft polymer based on conjugated diene or acrylate rubber and includes a grafted phase that may include methacrylic ester and styrene.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,877,835 disclosed a thermoplastic resin composition containing a rubber-modified styrene thermoplastic resin, an aromatic polyester, and aromatic polycarbonate. Included among the rubber modified styrene thermoplastic resin is methylmethacrylate-butadiene-styrene resin.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,888,388 disclosed an impact resistant thermoplastic composition having distinguished surface appearance, color and thermal<br>
stability. The composition contains a graft rubber copolymer, polycarbonate and saturated polyester.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,674,928 disclosed a thermoplastic resin composition containing a polyester resin, a polycarbonate resin and a graft copolymer containing a rubbery substrate and a rigid superstrate. Methylmethacrylate-butadiene-styrene graft copolymers are among the disclosed graft copolymer.<br>
JP 2001 031 860 disclosed a composition containing polycarbonate, a mixture of polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate and a graft elastomer having a core-shell structure. The composition said to exhibit high impact strength, hydrolytic stability and chemical resistance.<br>
An impact modified thermoplastic molding composition containing polycarbonate, polyalkylene terephthalate and a graft (co)polymer has been disclosed in U.S. Patent 7,067,567. The graft (co)polymer is exemplified by methyl methacrylate-grafted silicone-butyl acrylate composite rubber. U.S. Patent 6,989,190 disclosed a blend of polycarbonate, cycloaliphatic polyester resin and an impact modifier that contains a MBS core-shell polymer.<br>
Among the objectives of the present invention was the development of a thermoplastic composition that features good mechanical properties and surface appearance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

The impact modifier that exhibits pH value of less than 7 and contains less than 500 ppm of sodium ions, is characterized in its core/shell morphology, where the core contains polymerized butadiene structural units and shell contains polymerized methacrylate structural units. If styrene structural units are<br>
present in the core, the weight ratio of methacrylate in the shell to styrene in the core is greater than 1.5. The core is present in an amount of 40 to 70 percent relative to the weight of the impact modifier, and the glass transition temperature of the shell is greater than 23°C. The composition is characterized in its improved surface quality and toughness at low temperatures.<br>
