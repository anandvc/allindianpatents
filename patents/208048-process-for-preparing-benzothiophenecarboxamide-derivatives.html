The objective compound of the present invention is illustrated by the general formula (I), in which the double bond of the alkenylene side chain (i.e., 5-heptenylene chain) may be in E-  or Z-configuration.<br>
The method of the present invention is described below in more detail.  When a substituent(s) possibly interfering the reaction exists, it may be appropriately protected and deprotected at a desired stage.  Such protection or deprotection can be accomplished by a procedure known in the art. I.  Preparation of Compound (I)<br><br><br>
This step is related to the preparation of amide (1-2) by acylating an amino alcohol (II) or a salt thereof with carboxylic acid (III) or a reactive derivative thereof.<br>
The carboxylic acid (compound III) used in the acylation can be synthesized by a method known in literatures [for example, Nippon-Kagaku Zasshi vol. 88, No. 7, 758-763 (1967); Nippon-Kagaku Zasshi vol. 86, No. 10,<br>
1067-1072 (1965) ; J. Chem. Soc. (C). 1899-1905(1967); J. Heterocycle. Chem. vol.10, 679-681(1973)],  The term<br><br>
'reactive derivative" of carboxylic acid (III) refers to corresponding acid halides (e.g., chloride, bromide, iodide), acid anhydrides {e.g.,   mixed acid anhydride with formic acid or acetic acid), activated esters (e.g., succinimide ester), and the like, and includes acylating agents generally used for the acylation of amino group. For example, to obtain acid halides, a carboxylic acid is reacted with thionyl halide (e.g., thionyl chloride), phosphorous halide (e.g., phosphorous trichloride, phosphorous pentachloride), oxalyl halide (e.g., oxalyl chloride), or the like, according to a known method {e.g., Shin-jikken Kagaku Koza, vol. 14, p. 1787 (1978); Synthesis 852-854(1986); Shin-jikken Kagaku Koza vol. 22, p. 115 (1992)).<br>
The acylation can be carried out under ordinary conditions used for the acylation of amino group.  For example, when a carboxylic acid halide is used, the reaction is carried out according to a method commonly known as "Schotten-Baumann reaction".  In general, carboxylic acid halide is added dropwise to an aqueous alkaline solution of amine with stirring and under cooling while removing the generating acid with alkali. Alternatively, when a carboxylic acid is used as a free acid not a reactive derivative, the reaction can be conducted conventionally in the presence of a coupling agent generally used in the coupling reaction between an amine and a carboxylic acid such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), l-ethyl-3-(3-<br><br>
dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide or N,Nf-<br>
carbonyldiimidazole,<br>
[Step 2]<br>
This step is related to the oxidation of an alcohol<br>
(1-2) to an aldehyde (1-3).  Hitherto such reaction has been conducted by using an oxidizing agent of chromic acid<br>
series such as Jones reagent (J. Org. Chem., 40, 1664-1665<br>
(1975)), Collins reagent (J. C. S. Chem. Coram., 1972 1126) or pyridinium chlorochromate (Tetrahedron Lett., 2647-2650<br>
(1975)).  Further, methods wherein manganese dioxide (Helv. Chim. Acta., 39, 858-862 (1956)) or dimethyl sulfoxide<br>
(Swern oxidation, J. Org. Chem., 43, 2480-2482 (1978)) have been known.  However, these existing methods have disadvantages.  For example, chromic acids are toxic to human body and must be detoxified after use.  Further, the Swern oxidation using dimethyl sulfoxide-oxalyl chloride is not suited for a large scale production because it is accompanied by the generation of carbon monoxide harmful to workers and sulfurous odor and also it must be carried out<br>
at low temperature, for example, between -50^ and -78°C. According to the method of the present invention,<br>
alcohol (1-2) is oxidized with an oxidizing agent(s) such as halo oxoacid in the presence of 2, 2, 6, 6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyls (referred to as *TEMPOs") as described in a literature (e.g., J. Org. Chem., 52, 2559-2562 (1987)), whereby the problems of existing methods are solved.  Examples of TEMPO include 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine-1-oxyl, 4-methoxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-<br><br>
1-oxyl, 4-acetylamino-2,2, 6, 6-tetramethylpiperidine-l-oxyl, 4-benzoyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-l-oxyl, and 4-cyano-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-l-oxyl.  Examples of halo oxoacid include sodium hypochlorite, sodium hypobromite, sodium bromite and higher bleaching powder.  A solution of an oxidizing agent may be adjusted to, for example, pH 8.5 to 9.5 with a mineral acid such as sodium hydrogen carbonate, hydrochloric aci or sulfuric acid. Alternatively, a solution of an oxidizing agent may be added in the presence of sodium hydrogen carbonate.  The reaction can be accomplished within several minutes to several tens minutes at temperature from ice-cooling to room temperature in a solvent such as ethyl acetate, acetonitrile or dichloromethane.<br>
The advantageous characteristics of the new oxidation method of the present invention are as follows:<br>
1)	the process requires simple operations and short period of time since the reaction renders a product at high yield within short reaction time without keeping very lower temperature;<br>
2)	the process is safe since the reaction solvent used are water and ethyl acetate;<br>
3)	the separation and purification of reaction products can be conducted only by extraction;<br>
4)	the oxidation is carried out with a cheap reagent, sodium hypochlorite, with only a quite small amount of catalyst, TEMPO, at 1 - 0.2 % molar equivalent to alcohol d-2);<br><br>
5)  it allows the operators to work in better environment because the reaction generates little carbon monoxide or odor in contrast with Swern oxidation, and, further, sodium chloride resulting from sodium hypochlorite used in the oxidation is unnecessary to be detoxified. [Step 3]<br>
This step is related to the formation of a double bond by reacting a compound of the formula (1-3) with an ylide (Ph3P=CH(CH2) 3COOH) .  The reaction for providing a double bond can be carried out in a conventional manner for Wittig reaction.  The ylides used in the reaction can be synthesized, in the presence of a base, by treating a phosphonium salt which has been synthesized from triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide having a desired alkyl group to be condensed, for example, 5-bromopentanoic acid.  Examples of a base include dimsyl sodium, dimsyl potassium, sodium hydride, n-butyl lithium, potassium t-butoxide and lithium diisopropylamide.  The reaction is accomplished within several hours at room temperature in a solvent such as ether, tetrahydrofuran, n-hexane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane or dimethyl sulfoxide. [Step 4]<br>
In this step, a compound (I) wherein R is hydroxy-protecting group is deprotected to provide compound (1-1). The reaction can be carried out in a conventional manner using, as a catalyst, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or barium hydroxide, or the like.  The reaction is accomplished within several<br><br>
tens minutes to several hours with heating in a solvent<br>
such as methanol-water, ethanol-water, acetone-water,<br>
acetonitrile-water, or the like, preferably dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide-water.  The OR may be positioned at any of 4-, 5-,<br>
6- and 7-positions though, it is preferred to be at 5-<br>
position.<br>
II.  Preparation of Compound (II)<br>
The starting material in this process, amino alcohol (II), can be prepared by a known procedure starting from, for example, (-)-myrtenol.  A precursor, methoxime ester of the formula (II-2) wherein R3 is methyl, is then reduced with metal sodium in isopropanol to give the corresponding amino alcohol (II) (Hagishita, et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 37(6), 1524-1533 (1989)).  However, this method have problems such as low yield (39.6 %) or poor selectivity.<br>
As reducing agents used in the reduction of esters to alcohols, there have been known sodium borohydride (J. Org. Chem., 28, 3261 (1982)), lithium aluminum hydride (Org. Syn., 63, 140), lithium borohydride (J. Org. Chem., 47, 4702 (1982)) and the like.  Further, as methods for reducing oximes to amines, there have been known catalytic reduction (Syn. Comm., 27, 817 (1997); Org. Syn., coll. vol. 5, 376 (1973)) or methods which use a reducing agent(s) such as diborane (J. Org. Chem., 30, 2877 (1965))x sodium borohydride (J. Org. Chem., 48, 3412 (1983) K lithium<br>
aluminum hydride (Tetrahedron, 51, 8363 (1995))s  sodium borohydride-titanium chloride (IV) (Synthesis. 1980 695),<br>
sodium borohydride-nickel chloride (II) (Chem. Ber., 117,<br><br>
856 (1984)), or the like.  None of the literatures above, however, do not teach a method for reducing both ester and oxime moieties present in one molecule such as a compound of the formula (II-2) simultaneously in high yield with high stereoselectivity.<br>
The present inventors have succeeded in reducing oxime ester of the formula (II-2) to the objective amino alcohol (II) in high yield with high selectivity by using a reducing agent-Lewis acid system (especially, sodium borohydride-Lewis acid) as shown in Scheme II below.<br>
Scheme II<br><br>
wherein R2 and R3 are as defined above.<br>
According to the present process, an oxime ester (II-2) is reduced directly or via alcohol (II-3) to give an amino alcohol (II) or a salt thereof.  Reducing agents usable in the reaction above include alkali metal- or alkaline earth metal-substituted borohydrides (sodium borohydride, lithium borohydride, calcium borohydride,<br><br>
etc.).<br>
Examples of Lewis acid include halides of tin, aluminium, boron, titanium, zirconium or nickel (e.g., stannous chloride, stannic chloride, aluminium chloride, titanium tetrachloride, boron trifluoride, zirconium tetrachloride, nickel dichloride, etc.) or a ether complexes thereof (e.g., sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminium hydride, etc.).<br>
Examples of solvent include ethers (e.g., ethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dimetoxyethane, dioxane, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, etc.), hydrocarbons (e.g., toluene, xylene, etc.), and a mixed solvents between ethers and hydrocarbons.  Regarding the reduction of an alcohol (II-3) to an amino alcohol (II) or its salt, a method which uses metal sodium-alcohol is also availabe in addition to the above-mentioned reducing agent-Lewis acid system.  Examples of alcohol include methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, i-propanol, and the like.  Examples of solvents include hydrocarbons (e.g., toluene, xylene, etc.)<br>
The process for reaction will be described concretely below*  The raw material, oxime ester (or alkyl-substituted oxime) (II-2a or II-2b) is dissolved in 2 volumes or more of a solvent.  To the solution are added 2 or more molar equivalents of a reducing agent and then a Lewis acid at 0.1 to 0.4 molar equivalents to the reducing agent at 0°C<br>
to 150°C.  Alternatively, a mixture previously prepared by combining a Lewis acid and a solvent may be added.  Further,<br>
the order for adding a raw material, an oxime ester, a<br><br>
reducing agent and a Lewis acid can be changed.  The<br>
reaction mixture is then treated at 0°C to 150*0 for several minutes to several hours for reaction.  The<br>
reaction solution can be worked up by adding water and<br>
)   dilute mineral acid (e.g., dilute hydrochloric acid)<br>
followed by stirring, whereby the reducing agent is<br>
destroyed.  Alternatively, the reaction solution may be<br>
poured into dilute mineral acid.<br>
The solution is then neutralized with an alkali (e.g., 1   sodium hydroxide) and extracted with an organic solvent<br>
(e.g., ethyl acetate).  When the solvent is distilled off, an amino alcohol (II) is obtained.  If necessary, the product can be further purified by converting into a crystalline salt (II') with an appropriate acid (e.g., benzoic acid) and then neutralizing with an alkali to give amino alcohol (II).<br>
According to the above-mentioned process of the present invention, the objective amino alcohol (II) can be prepared in high yield (about 89 %) with high stereoselectivity (99 % or more).<br>
Although the process for preparing a compound of the formula (II) shown in the scheme II above is novel and useful for the preparation of a compound (II) in itself, it also contributes to establish safe and efficient production of a compound (I), the final product, when combined with a process for preparing the compound (I).<br>
The following Examples are provided to further<br>
0-<br>
illustrate the present invention in more detail and should<br><br>
not be interpreted in any way as to limit the scope thereof. The abbreviations used in the Examples have the following meanings:<br>
Ph: phenyl<br>
Ac: acetyl<br>
TEMPO: 2, 2, 6, 6 —tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl<br><br>
