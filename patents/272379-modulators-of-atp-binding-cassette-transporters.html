				<td>MODULATORS OF ATP-BINPING CASSETTE TRANSPORTERS<br>
[0001]	CLAIM OF PRIORITY<br>
[0002] The present patent application claims priority to U.S. provisional patent application<br>
serial no. 60/790,459, filed on April 7,2006, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its<br>
entirety.<br>
[0003]	TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] The present invention relates to modulators of ATP-Binding Cassette ("ABC")<br>
transporters or fragments thereof, including Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance<br>
Regulator ("CFTR"), compositions thereof and methods therewith. The present invention<br>
also relates to methods of treating ABC transporter mediated diseases using such modulators.<br>
[0005]	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] ABC transporters are a family of membrane transporter proteins that regulate the<br>
transport of a wide variety of pharmacological agents, potentially toxic drugs, and<br>
xenobiotics, as well as anions. ABC transporters are homologous membrane proteins that<br>
bind and use cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for their specific activities. Some of<br>
these transporters were discovered as multidrug resistance proteins (like the MDR1-P<br>
glycoprotein, or the multidrug resistance protein, MRP1), defending malignant cancer cells<br>
against chemotherapeutic agents. To date, 48 ABC Transporters have been identified and<br>
grouped into 7 families based on their sequence identity and function.<br>
[0007] ABC transporters regulate a variety of important physiological roles within the<br>
body and provide defense against harmful environmental compounds. Because of this, they<br>
represent important potential drug targets for the treatment of diseases associated with defects<br>
in the transporter, prevention of drug transport out of the target cell, and intervention in other<br>
diseases in which modulation of ABC transporter activity may be beneficial.<br>
[0008] One member of the ABC transporter family commonly associated with disease is<br>
the cAMP/ATP-mediated anion channel, CFTR. CFTR is expressed in a variety of cells<br>
types, including absorptive and secretory epithelia cells, where it regulates anion flux across<br>
the membrane, as well as the activity of other ion channels and proteins. In epithelia cells,<br>
normal functioning of CFTR is critical for the maintenance of electrolyte transport<br>
throughout the body, including respiratory and digestive tissue. CFTR is composed of<br>
 <br>
approximately 1480 amino acids that encode a protein made up of a tandem repeat of<br>
transmembrane domains, each containing six transmembrane helices and a nucleotide binding<br>
domain. The two transmembrane domains are linked by a large, polar, regulatory (R)-domain<br>
with multiple phosphorylation sites that regulate channel activity and cellular trafficking.<br>
[0009] The gene encoding CFTR has been identified and sequenced (See Gregory, R. J. et<br>
al. (1990) Nature 347:382-386; Rich, D. P. et al. (1990) Nature 347:358-362), (Riordan, J. R.<br>
et al. (1989) Science 245:1066-1073). A defect in this gene causes mutations in CFTR<br>
resulting in Cystic Fibrosis ("CF"), the most common fatal genetic disease in humans. Cystic<br>
Fibrosis affects approximately one in every 2,500 infants in the United States. Within the<br>
general United States population, up to 10 million people carry a single copy of the defective<br>
gene without apparent ill effects. In contrast, individuals with two copies of the CF<br>
associated gene suffer from the debilitating and fatal effects of CF, including chronic lung<br>
disease.<br>
[0010] In patients with cystic fibrosis, mutations in CFTR endogenously expressed in<br>
respiratory epithelia leads to reduced apical anion secretion causing an imbalance in ion and<br>
fluid transport. The resulting decrease in anion transport contributes to enhanced mucus<br>
accumulation in the lung and the accompanying microbial infections that ultimately cause<br>
death in CF patients. In addition to respiratory disease, CF patients typically suffer from<br>
gastrointestinal problems and pancreatic insufficiency that, if left untreated, results in death.<br>
In addition, the majority of males with cystic fibrosis are infertile and fertility is decreased<br>
among females with cystic fibrosis. In contrast to the severe effects of two copies of the CF<br>
associated gene, individuals with a single copy of the CF associated gene exhibit increased<br>
resistance to cholera and to dehydration resulting from diarrhea — perhaps explaining the<br>
relatively high frequency of the CF gene within the population.<br>
[0011] Sequence analysis of the CFTR gene of CF chromosomes has revealed a variety of<br>
disease causing mutations (Cutting, G. R. et al. (1990) Nature 346:366-369; Dean, M. et al.<br>
(1990) Cell 61:863:870; and Kerem, B-S. et al. (1989) Science 245:1073-1080; Kerem, B-S<br>
et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:8447-8451). To date, &gt; 1000 disease causing<br>
mutations in the CF gene have been identified (http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr/). The<br>
most prevalent mutation is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 of the CFTR amino<br>
acid sequence, and is commonly referred to as AF508-CFTR. This mutation occurs in<br>
approximately 70% of the cases of cystic fibrosis and is associated with a severe disease.<br>
[0012] The deletion of residue 508 in AF508-CFTR prevents the nascent protein from<br>
folding correctly. This results in the inability of the mutant protein to exit the ER, and traffic<br>
 <br>
to the plasma membrane. As a result, the number of channels present in the membrane is far<br>
less than observed in cells expressing wild-type CFTR. In addition to impaired trafficking,<br>
the mutation results in defective channel gating. Together, the reduced number of channels in<br>
the membrane and the defective gating lead to reduced anion transport across epithelia<br>
leading to defective ion and fluid transport. (Quinton, P. M. (1990), FASEB J. 4: 2709-<br>
2.727). Stuthes have shown, however, that the reduced numbers of AF508-CFTR in the<br>
membrane are functional, albeit less than wild-type CFTR. (Dalemans et al. (1991), Nature<br>
Lond. 354: 526-528; Denning et al., supra; Pasyk and Foskett (1995), J. Cell. Biochem. 270:<br>
12347-50). In addition to AF508-CFTR, other disease causing mutations in CFTR that result<br>
in defective trafficking, synthesis, and/or channel gating could be up- or down-regulated to<br>
alter anion secretion and modify disease progression and/or severity.<br>
[0013] Although CFTR transports a variety of molecules in addition to anions, it is clear<br>
that this role (the transport of anions) represents one element in an important mechanism of<br>
transporting ions and water across the epithelium. The other elements include the epithelial<br>
Na+ channel, ENaC, Na+/2C1"/K+ co-transporter, Na+-K+-ATPase pump and the basolateral<br>
membrane K.+ channels, that are responsible for the uptake of chloride into the cell.<br>
[0014] These elements work together to achieve directional transport across the<br>
epithelium via their selective expression and localization within the cell. Chloride absorption<br>
takes place by the coordinated activity of ENaC and CFTR present on the apical membrane<br>
and the Na+-K+-ATPase pump and CI- channels expressed on the basolateral surface of the<br>
cell. Secondary active transport of chloride from the luminal side leads to the accumulation<br>
of intracellular chloride, which can then passively leave the cell via CI" channels, resulting in<br>
a vectorial transport. Arrangement of Na+/2C17K+ co-transporter, Na+-K+-ATPase pump and<br>
the basolateral membrane K+ channels on the basolateral surface and CFTR on the luminal<br>
side coordinate the secretion of chloride via CFTR on the luminal side. Because water is<br>
probably never actively transported itself, its flow across epithelia depends on tiny<br>
transepithelial osmotic grathents generated by the bulk flow of sodium and chloride.<br>
[0015] In addition to Cystic Fibrosis, modulation of CFTR activity may be beneficial for<br>
other diseases not directly caused by mutations in CFTR, such as secretory diseases and other<br>
protein folding diseases mediated by CFTR. These include, but are not limited to, chronic<br>
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dry eye disease, and Sjogren's Syndrome.<br>
[0016] COPD is characterized by airflow limitation that is progressive and not fully<br>
reversible. The airflow limitation is due to mucus hypersecretion, emphysema, and<br>
bronchiolitis. Activators of mutant or wild-type CFTR offer a potential treatment of mucus<br>
 <br>
hypersecretion and impaired mucociliary clearance that is common in COPD. Specifically,<br>
increasing anion secretion across CFTR may facilitate fluid transport into the airway surface<br>
liquid to hydrate the mucus and optimized periciliary fluid viscosity. This would lead to<br>
enhanced mucociliary clearance and a reduction in the symptoms associated with COPD.<br>
Dry eye disease is characterized by a decrease in tear aqueous production and abnormal tear<br>
film lipid, protein and mucin profiles. There are many causes of dry eye, some of which<br>
include age, Lasik eye surgery, arthritis, medications, chemical/thermal burns, allergies, and<br>
diseases, such as Cystic Fibrosis and Sjogrens's syndrome. Increasing anion secretion via<br>
CFTR would enhance fluid transport from the corneal endothelial cells and secretory glands<br>
surrounding the eye to increase corneal hydration. This would help to alleviate the symptoms<br>
associated with dry eye disease. Sjogrens's syndrome is an autoimmune disease in which the<br>
immune system attacks moisture-producing glands throughout the body, including the eye,<br>
mouth, skin, respiratory tissue, liver, vagina, and gut. Symptoms, include, dry eye, mouth,<br>
and vagina, as well as lung disease. The disease is also associated with rheumatoid arthritis,<br>
systemic lupus, systemic sclerosis, and polymyposius/dermatomyositis. Defective protein<br>
trafficking is believed to cause the disease, for which treatment options are limited.<br>
Modulators of CFTR activity may hydrate the various organs afflicted by the disease and help<br>
to elevate the associated symptoms.<br>
[0017] As discussed above, it is believed that the deletion of residue 508 in AF508-CFTR<br>
prevents the nascent protein from folding correctly, resulting in the inability of this mutant<br>
protein to exit the ER, and traffic to the plasma membrane. As a result, insufficient amounts<br>
of the mature protein are present at the plasma membrane and chloride transport within<br>
epithelial tissues is significantly reduced. In fact, this cellular phenomenon of defective ER<br>
processing of ABC transporters by the ER machinery has been shown to be the underlying<br>
basis not only for CF disease, but for a wide range of other isolated and inherited diseases.<br>
The two ways that the ER machinery can malfunction is either by loss of coupling to ER<br>
export of the proteins leading to degradation, or by the ER accumulation of these<br>
defective/misfolded proteins [Aridor M, et al., Nature Med., 5(7), pp 745- 751 (1999);<br>
Shastry, B.S., et al., Neurochem. International, 43, pp 1-7 (2003); Rutishauser, J., et al., Swiss<br>
Med Wkly, 132, pp 211-222 (2002); Morello, JP et al., TIPS, 21, pp. 466- 469 (2000); Bross<br>
P., et al., Human Mut., 14, pp. 186-198 (1999)]. The diseases associated with the first class<br>
of ER malfunction are Cystic fibrosis (due to misfolded AF508-CFTR as discussed above),<br>
Hereditary emphysema (due to al-antitrypsin; non Piz variants), Hereditary<br>
hemochromatosis, Coagulation-Fibrinolysis deficiencies, such as Protein C deficiency, Type<br>
 <br>
1 hereditary angioedema, Lipid processing deficiencies, such as Familial<br>
hypercholesterolemia, Type 1 chylomicronemia, Abetalipoproteinemia, Lysosomal storage<br>
diseases, such as I-cell disease/Pseudo-Hurler, Mucopolysaccharidoses (due to Lysosomal<br>
processing enzymes), Sandhof/Tay-Sachs (due to P-Hexosaminidase), Crigler-Najjar type II<br>
(due to UDP-glucuronyl-sialyc-transferase), Polyendocarinopathy/Hyperinsulernia, Diabetes<br>
mellitus (due to Insulin receptor), Laron dwarfism (due to Growth hormone receptor),<br>
Myleoperoxidase deficiency, Primary hypoparathyroidism (due to Preproparathyroid<br>
hormone), Melanoma (due to Tyrosinase). The diseases associated with the latter class of ER<br>
malfunction are Glycanosis CDG type 1, Hereditary emphysema (due to αl -Antitrypsin (PiZ<br>
variant), Congenital hyperthyroidism, Osteogenesis imperfecta (due to Type I, II, IV<br>
procollagen), Hereditary hypofibrinogenemia (due to Fibrinogen), ACT deficiency (due to<br>
αl-Antichymotrypsin), Diabetes insipidus (DI), Neurophyseal DI (due to Vasopvessin<br>
hormone/V2-Teceptor), Neprogenic DI (due to Aquaporin II), Charcot-Marie Tooth syndrome<br>
(due to Peripheral myelin protein 22), Perlizaeus-Merzbacher disease, neurodegenerative<br>
diseases such as Alzheimer's disease ( due to PAPP and presenilins), Parkinson's disease,<br>
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Progressive supranuclear plasy, Pick's disease, several<br>
polyglutarnine neurological disorders asuch as Huntington, Spinocerebullar ataxia type I,<br>
Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, Dentatorubal pallidoluysian, and Myotonic dystrophy, as<br>
well as Spongiform encephalopathies, such as Hereditary Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (due to<br>
Prion protein processing defect), Fabry disease (due to lysosomal a-galactosidase A) and<br>
Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (due to Prp processing defect).<br>
[0018] In addition to up-regulation of CFTR activity, reducing anion secretion by CFTR<br>
modulators may be beneficial for the treatment of secretory diarrheas, in which epithelial<br>
water transport is dramatically increased as a result of secretagogue activated chloride<br>
transport. The mechanism involves elevation of cAMP and stimulation of CFTR.<br>
[00191 Although there are numerous causes of diarrhea, the major consequences of<br>
diarrheal diseases, resulting from excessive chloride transport are common to all, and include<br>
dehydration, acidosis, unpaired growth and death.<br>
[0020] Acute and chronic diarrheas represent a major medical problem in many areas of<br>
the world. Diarrhea is both a significant factor in malnutrition and the leading cause of death<br>
(5,000,000 deaths/year) in children less than five years old.<br>
[0021] Secretory diarrheas are also a dangerous condition in patients of acquired<br>
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 16<br>
million travelers to developing countries from industrialized nations every year develop<br>
 <br>
diarrhea, with the severity and number of cases of diarrhea varying depending on the country<br>
and area of travel.<br>
[0022] Diarrhea in barn animals and pets such as cows, pigs and horses, sheep, goats, cats<br>
and dogs, also known as scours, is a major cause of death in these animals. Diarrhea can<br>
result from any major transition, such as weaning or physical movement, as well as in<br>
response to a variety of bacterial or viral infections and generally occurs within the first few<br>
hours of the animal's life.<br>
[0023] The most common diarrhea causing bacteria is enterotoxogenic E-coli (ETEC)<br>
having the K99 pilus antigen. Common viral causes of diarrhea include rotavirus and<br>
coronavirus. Other infectious agents include Cryptosporidium, giardia lamblia, and<br>
salmonella, among others.<br>
[0024] Symptoms of rotaviral infection include excretion of watery feces, dehydration and<br>
weakness. Coronavirus causes a more severe illness in the newborn animals, and has a<br>
higher mortality rate than rotaviral infection. Often, however, a young animal may be<br>
infected with more than one virus or with a combination of viral and bacterial<br>
microorganisms at one time. This dramatically increases the severity of the disease.<br>
[0025] Accordingly, there is a need for modulators of an ABC transporter activity, and<br>
compositions thereof, that can be used to modulate the activity of the ABC transporter in the<br>
cell membrane of a mammal.<br>
[0026] There is a need for methods of treating ABC transporter mediated diseases using<br>
such modulators of ABC transporter activity.<br>
[0027] There is a need for methods of modulating an ABC transporter activity in an ex<br>
vivo cell membrane of a mammal.<br>
[0028] There is a need for modulators of CFTR activity that can be used to modulate the<br>
activity of CFTR in the cell membrane of a mammal.<br>
[0029] There is a need for methods of treating CFTR-mediated diseases using such<br>
modulators of CFTR activity.<br>
[0030] There is a need for methods of modulating CFTR activity in an ex vivo cell<br>
membrane of a mammal.<br>

[0034]	DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0035] I. DEFINITIONS<br>
[0036] As used herein, the following definitions shall apply unless otherwise indicated.<br>
[0037] The term "ABC-transporter" as used herein means an ABC-transporter protein or a<br>
fragment thereof comprising at least one binding domain, wherein said protein or fragment<br>
thereof is present in vivo or in vitro. The term "binding domain" as used herein means a<br>
domain on the ABC-transporter that can bind to a modulator. See, e.g., Hwang, T. C. et al., J.<br>
Gen. Physiol- (1998): 111(3), 477-90.<br>
[0038] The term "CFTR" as used herein means cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance<br>
 <br>
regulator or a mutation thereof capable of regulator activity, including, but not limited to,<br>
AF508 CFTR and G551D CFTR (see, e.g., http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr/, for CFTR<br>
mutations).<br>
[0039] The term "modulating" as used herein means increasing or decreasing, e.g. activity,<br>
by a measurable amount. Compounds that modulate ABC Transporter activity, such as<br>
CFTR activity, by increasing the activity of the ABC Transporter, e.g., a CFTR anion<br>
channel, are called agonists. Compounds that modulate ABC Transporter activity, such as<br>
CFTR activity, by decreasing the activity of the ABC Transporter, e.g., CFTR anion channel,<br>
are called antagonists. An agonist interacts with an ABC Transporter, such as CFTR anion<br>
channel, to increase the ability of the receptor to transduce an intracellular signal in response<br>
to endogenous ligand binding. An antagonist interacts with an ABC Transporter, such as<br>
CFTR, and competes with the endogenous ligand(s) or substrate(s) for binding site(s) on the<br>
receptor to decrease the ability of the receptor to transduce an intracellular signal in response<br>
to endogenous ligand binding.<br>
[0040] The phrase "treating or reducing the severity of an ABC Transporter mediated<br>
disease" refers both to treatments for diseases that are directly caused by ABC Transporter<br>
and/or CFTR activities and alleviation of symptoms of diseases not directly caused by ABC<br>
Transporter and/or CFTR anion channel activities. Examples of diseases whose symptoms<br>
may be affected by ABC Transporter and/or CFTR activity include, but are not limited to,<br>
Cystic fibrosis, Hereditary emphysema, Hereditary hemochromatosis, Coagulation-<br>
Fibrinolysis deficiencies, such as Protein C deficiency, Type 1 hereditary angioedema, Lipid<br>
processing deficiencies, such as Familial hypercholesterolemia, Type 1 chylomicronemia,<br>
Abetalipoproteinemia, Lysosomal storage diseases, such as I-cell disease/Pseudo-Hurler,<br>
Mucopolysaccharidoses, Sandhoi/Tay-Sachs, Crigler-Najjar type II,<br>
Polyendocrinopathy/Hyperinsulemia, Diabetes mellitus, Laron dwarfism, Myleoperoxidase<br>
deficiency, Primary hypoparathyroidism, Melanoma, Glycanosis CDG type 1, Hereditary<br>
emphysema, Congenital hyperthyroidism, Osteogenesis imperfecta, Hereditary<br>
hypofibrinogenemia, ACT deficiency, Diabetes insipidus (DI), Neurophysiol DI,<br>
Nephrogenic DI, Charcot-Marie Tooth syndrome, Perlizaeus-Merzbacher disease,<br>
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic<br>
lateral sclerosis, Progressive supranuclear plasy, Pick's disease, several polyglutamine<br>
neurological disorders such as Huntington, Spinocerebullar ataxia type I, Spinal and bulbar<br>
muscular atrophy, Dentatorubal pallidoluysian, and Myotonic dystrophy, as well as<br>
Spongiform encephalopathies, such as Hereditary Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Fabry disease,<br>
 <br>
Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, COPD, dry-eye disease, and Sjogren's disease.<br>

 <br>
be an aliphatic group in at least one instance. The term aliphatic chain includes alkyl chains,<br>
alkenyl chains, and alkynyl chains, where alkyl, alkenyl, and alkynyl are defined above.<br>
[00100] The phrase "optionally substituted" is used interchangeably with the phrase<br>
"substituted or unsubstituted." As described herein, compounds of the invention can<br>
optionally be substituted with one or more substituents, such as are illustrated generally<br>
above, or as exemplified by particular classes, subclasses, and species of the invention. As<br>
described herein, the variables R1, R2, and R3, and other variables contained in formulae<br>
described herein encompass specific groups, such as alkyl and aryl. Unless otherwise noted,<br>
each of the specific groups for the variables R1, R2, and R3, and other variables contained<br>
therein can be optionally substituted with one or more substituents described herein. Each<br>
substituent of a specific group is further optionally substituted with one to three of halo,<br>
cyano, oxo, alkoxy, hydroxy, amino, nitro, aryl, cycloaliphatic, heterocycloaliphatic,<br>
heteroaryl, haloalkyl, and alkyl. For instance, an alkyl group can be substituted with<br>
alkylsulfanyl and the alkylsulfanyl can be optionally substituted with one to three of halo,<br>
cyano, oxo, alkoxy, hydroxy, amino, nitro, aryl, haloalkyl, and alkyl. As an additional<br>
example, the cycloalkyl portion of a (cycloalkyl)carbonylamino can be optionally substituted<br>
with one to three of halo, cyano, alkoxy, hydroxy, nitro, haloalkyl, and alkyl. When two<br>
alkoxy groups are bound to the same atom or adjacent atoms, the two alkxoy groups can form<br>
a ring together with the atom(s) to which they are bound.<br>
[00101] In general, the term "substituted," whether preceded by the term "optionally" or<br>
not, refers to the replacement of hydrogen radicals in a given structure with the radical of a<br>
specified substituent. Specific substituents are described above in the definitions and below<br>
in the description of compounds and examples thereof. Unless otherwise indicated, an<br>
optionally substituted group can have a substituent at each substitutable position of the group,<br>
and when more than one position in any given structure can be substituted with more than<br>
one substituent selected from a specified group, the substituent can be either the same or<br>
different at every position. A ring substituent, such as a heterocycloalkyl, can be bound to<br>
another ring, such as a cycloalkyl, to form a spiro-bicyclic ring system, e.g., both rings share<br>
one common atom. As one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, combinations of<br>
substituents envisioned by this invention are those combinations that result in the formation<br>
of stable or chemically feasible compounds.<br>
[00102] The phrase "stable or chemically feasible," as used herein, refers to compounds<br>
that are not substantially altered when subjected to conditions to allow for their production,<br>
detection, and preferably their recovery, purification, and use for one or more of the purposes<br>
 <br>
disclosed herein. In some embodiments, a stable compound or chemically feasible compound<br>
is one that is not substantially altered when kept at a temperature of 40 °C or less, in the<br>
absence of moisture or other chemically reactive conditions, for at least a week.<br>
[00103] As used herein, an "effective amount" is defined as the amount required to confer a<br>
therapeutic effect on the treated patient, and is typically determined based on age, surface<br>
area, weight, and condition of the patient. The interrelationship of dosages for animals and<br>
humans (based on milligrams per meter squared of body surface) is described by Freireich et<br>
al., Cancer Chemother. Rep., 50: 219 (1966). Body surface area may be approximately<br>
determined from height and weight of the patient. See, e.g., Scientific Tables, Geigy<br>
Pharmaceuticals, Ardsley, New York, 537 (1970). As used herein, "patient" refers to a<br>
mammal, including a human.<br>
[00104] Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include all<br>
isomeric (e.g., enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and geometric (or conformational)) forms of the<br>
structure; for example, the R and S configurations for each asymmetric center, (Z) and (E)<br>
double bond isomers, and (Z) and (E) conformational isomers. Therefore, single<br>
stereochemical isomers as well as enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and geometric (or<br>
conformational) mixtures of the present compounds are within the scope of the invention.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, all tautomeric forms of the compounds of the invention are within<br>
the scope of the invention. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein<br>
are also meant to include compounds that differ only in the presence of one or more<br>
isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures except<br>
for the replacement of hydrogen by deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by a<br>
13C- or 14C-enriched carbon are within the scope of this invention. Such compounds are<br>
useful, for example, as analytical tools or probes in biological assays, or as therapeutic<br>
agents.<br>
[00105] Compounds of the present invention are useful modulators of ABC transporters<br>
and are useful in the treatment of ABC transporter mediated diseases.<br>

[00182] IV. GENERIC SYNTHETIC SCHEMES<br>
[00183] The compounds of formulae (I, Ic, Id, II, IIa, IIb, IIc, and IId) may be readily<br>
synthesized from commercially available or known starting materials by known methods.<br>
Exemplary synthetic routes to produce compounds of formulae (I, Ic, Id, II, Ila, IIb, IIc, and<br>
IId) are provided below in Schemes 1-22 below-.<br>
[00184] Preparation of the compounds of the invention is achieved by the coupling of a<br>
ring B amine with a ring A carboxylic acid as illustrated in Scheme 1.<br>
[00185] Scheme 1:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
DCM/DMF.<br>
[00186] Referring to Scheme 1, the acid 1a may be converted to the corresponding acid<br>
chloride lb using thionyl chloride in the presence of a catalystic amount of<br>
dimethylformamide. Reaction of the acid chloride with the amine provides<br>
compounds of the invention 1. Alternatively, the acid la may be directly coupled to the<br>
amine using known coupling reagents such as, for example, HATU in the presence of<br>
triethylamine.<br>
[00187] Preparation of the acids 1 a may be achieved as illustrated in Scheme 2.<br>
Scheme 2:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
a) NaOH, BTEAC; b) NaOH, A<br>
[00188] Referring to Scheme 2, the nitrile 2a reacts with a suitable bromochloroalkane in<br>
the presence of sodium hydroxide and a phase tranfer catalyst such as butyltriethylammonium<br>
chloride to provide the intermediate 2b. Hydrolysis of the nitrile of 2b provides the acid la.<br>
In some instances, isolation of the intermediate 2b is unnecessary.<br>
[00189] The phenylacetonitriles 2a are commercially available or may be prepared as<br>
illustrated in Scheme 3.<br>
Scheme 3<br>
 <br>
3d	2a<br>
a) Pd(PPh3)4, CO, MeOH; b) LiAlH,, THF; c) SOCl2; d) NaCN<br>
[00190] Referring to Scheme 3, reaction of an aryl bromide 3a with carbon monoxide in the<br>
presence of methanol and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (O) provides the ester 3b.<br>
Reduction of 3b with lithium aluminum hydride provides the alcohol 3c which is converted to<br>
the halide 3d with thionyl chloride. Reaction of 3d with sodium cyanide provides the nitrile<br>
2a.<br>
[00191] Other methods of producing the nitrile 2a are illustrated in schemes 4 and 5 below.<br>
Scheme 4<br>
 <br>
 <br>
a) NBS, AIBN, CCl4; b) NaCN, EtOH<br>
[00192] Preparation of  components is illustrated in the schemes that follow.a<br>
■ A number of methods for preparing ring B compounds wherein ring B is an indole have been<br>
reported. See for example Angew. Chem. 2005,44,606; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005,127,<br>
5342,); J. Comb. Chem. 2005,7,130; Tetrahedron 2006, 62, 3439; J. Chem. Soc. Perkin<br>
Trans. 1,2000, 1045.<br>
[00193] One method for preparing is illustrated in Scheme 6.<br>
Scheme 6<br>
 <br>
 <br>
a) NaNO2, HC1, SnCl2; b) NaOH, R3CH2C(O)R3, EtOH; c) H3PO4, toluene; d) H2, Pd-C,<br>
EtOH<br>
[00194] Referring to Scheme 6, a nitroamline 6a is converted to the hydrazine 6b using<br>
nitrous acid in the presence of HC1 and stannous chloride. Reaction of 6b with an aldehyde<br>
or ketone CH3C(O)R3 provides the hydrazone 6c which on treatment with phophoric acid in<br>
toluene leads to a mixture of nitro indoles 6d and 6e. Catalytic hydrogenation in the presence<br>
of palladium on carbon provides a mixture of the amino indoles 6f and 6g which may be<br>
separated using know methods such as, for example, chromatography.<br>

nitrogen-containing groups of the compounds disclosed herein. Water or oil-soluble or<br>
dispersible products may be obtained by such quaternization. Representative alkali or<br>
alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the<br>
like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, when appropriate, nontoxic<br>
ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed using countertoils such as<br>
halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, loweralkyl sulfonate and aryl<br>
sulfonate.<br>
[00238] As described above, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of the present<br>
invention additionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle,<br>
which, as used herein, includes any and all solvents, diluents, or other liquid vehicle,<br>
dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents, thickening or<br>
emulsifying agents, preservatives, solid binders, lubricants and the like, as suited to the<br>

 <br>
W. Martin (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1980) discloses various carriers used in<br>
formulating pharmaceutically acceptable compositions and known techniques for the<br>
preparation thereof. Except insofar as any conventional carrier medium is incompatible with<br>
the compounds of the invention, such as by producing any undesirable biological effect or<br>
otherwise interacting in a deleterious manner with any other component(s) of the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable composition, its use is contemplated to be within the scope of<br>
this invention. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin,<br>

other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate,<br>
as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and<br>
perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition,<br>
according to the judgment of the formulator.<br>
[00239] In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a method of treating a<br>
condition, disease, or disorder implicated by ABC transporter activity. In certain<br>
embodiments, the present invention provides a method of treating a condition, disease, or<br>
disorder implicated by a deficiency of ABC transporter activity, the method comprising<br>
administering a composition comprising a compound of formulae (I, Ic, Id, II, Ila, IIb, IIe,<br>
and lid) to a subject, preferably a mammal, in need thereof.<br>

[00244] The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the<br>
species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the infection, the particular<br>
agent, its mode of administration, and the like. The compounds of the invention are<br>
preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of<br>
dosage. The expression "dosage unit form" as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit<br>
of agent appropriate for the patient to be treated. It will be understood, however, that the total<br>
daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by<br>
 <br>
the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific effective<br>
dose level for any particular patient or organism will depend upon a variety of factors<br>
including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the<br>
specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight,<br>
general health, sex and thet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration,<br>
and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs<br>
used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed, and like factors<br>
well known in the medical arts. The term "patient", as used herein, means an animal,<br>
preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human.<br>
[00245] The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention can be<br>
administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally,<br>
intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, as an<br>
oral or nasal spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being treated. In<br>
certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be administered orally or<br>
parenterally at dosage levels of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg and preferably from<br>
about 1 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to<br>
obtain the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
[00246] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and<br>
elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert<br>
diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing<br>
agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate,<br>
benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide,<br>
oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils),<br>
glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan,<br>
and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants<br>
such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and<br>
perfuming agents.<br>
[00247] Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous<br>
suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or<br>
wetting agents and suspending agents.- The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile<br>
injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or<br>
solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and<br>
solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium<br>
 <br>
chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or<br>
suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including<br>
synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the<br>
preparation of injectables.<br>
[00248] The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a<br>
bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid<br>
compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable<br>
medium prior to use.<br>
[00249] In order to prolong the effect of a compound of the present invention, it is often<br>
desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous'or intramuscular<br>
injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or<br>
amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then<br>
depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline<br>
form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered compound form is<br>
accomplished by dissolving or suspending the compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot<br>
forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the compound in biodegradable<br>
polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of compound to<br>
polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of compound release can<br>
be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and<br>
poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the<br>
compound in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.<br>
[00250] Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories<br>
which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating<br>
excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which<br>
are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the<br>
rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.<br>
[00251] Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders,<br>
and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one<br>
inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium<br>
phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol,<br>
and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating<br>
agents such as agar—agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain<br>
silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption<br>
 <br>
accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for<br>
example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite<br>
clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene<br>
glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills,<br>
the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.<br>
[00252] Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and<br>
hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high<br>
molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets,<br>
dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric<br>
coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may<br>
optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the<br>
active ingrethent(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally,<br>
in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include<br>
polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed<br>
as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar<br>
as well as high molecular weight polethylene glycols and the like.<br>
[00253] The active compounds can also be in microencapsulated form with one or more<br>
excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and<br>
granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling<br>
coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art In such solid<br>
dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as<br>
sucrose, Lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice,<br>
additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting<br>
aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules,<br>
+tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally<br>
contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active<br>
ingrethent(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a<br>
delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric<br>
substances and waxes.<br>
[00254] Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this<br>
invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays,<br>
inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions witin a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be<br>
required. Ophthalmic formulation, eardrops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being<br>
 <br>
within the scope of this invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use<br>
of transdermal patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a<br>
compound to the body. Such dosage forms are prepared by dissolving or dispensing the<br>
compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux<br>
of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate<br>
controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.<br>
[00255] As described generally above, the compounds of the invention are useful as<br>
modulators of ABC transporters. Thus, without wishing to be bound by any particular<br>
theory, the compounds and compositions are particularly useful for treating or lessening the<br>
severity of a disease, condition, or disorder where hyperactivity or inactivity of ABC<br>
transporters is implicated in the disease, condition, or disorder. When hyperactivity or<br>
inactivity of an ABC transporter is implicated in a particular disease, condition, or disorder,<br>
the disease, condition, or disorder may also be referred to as a "ABC transporter-mediated<br>
disease, condition or disorder". Accordingly, in another aspect, the present invention<br>
provides a method for treating or lessening the severity of a disease, condition, or disorder<br>
where hyperactivity or inactivity of an ABC transporter is implicated in the disease state.<br>
[00256] The activity of a compound utilized in this invention as a modulator of an ABC<br>
transporter may be assayed according to methods described generally in the art and in the<br>
Examples herein.<br>
[00257] It will also be appreciated that the compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
compositions of the present invention can be employed in combination therapies, that is, the<br>
compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions can be administered concurrently<br>
with, prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired therapeutics or medical procedures.<br>
The particular combination of therapies (therapeutics or procedures) to employ in a<br>
combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired therapeutics and/or<br>
procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will also be appreciated that<br>
the therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder (for example, an<br>
inventive compound may be administered concurrently with another agent used to treat the<br>
same disorder), or they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects).<br>
As used herein, additional therapeutic agents that are normally administered to treat or<br>
prevent a particular disease, or condition, are known as "appropriate for the disease, or<br>
condition, being treated".<br>
[00258] The amount of additional therapeutic agent present in the compositions of this<br>
invention will be no more than the amount that would normally be administered in a<br>
 <br>
composition comprising that therapeutic agent as the only active agent Preferably the<br>
amount of additional therapeutic agent in the presently disclosed compositions will range<br>
from about 50% to 100% of the amount normally present in a composition comprising that<br>
agent as the only therapeutically active agent.<br>
[00259] The compounds of this invention or pharmaceutically acceptable compositions<br>
thereof may also be incorporated into compositions for coating an implantable medical<br>
device, such as prostheses, artificial valves, vascular grafts, stents and catheters.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention, in another aspect, includes a composition for coating an<br>
implantable device comprising a compound of the present invention as described generally<br>
above, and in classes and subclasses herein, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable<br>
device. In still another aspect, the present invention includes an implantable device coated<br>
with a composition comprising a compound of the present invention as described generally<br>
above, and in classes and subclasses herein, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable<br>
device. Suitable coatings and the general preparation of coated implantable devices are<br>
described in US Patents 6,099,562; 5,886,026; and 5,304,121. The coatings are typically<br>
biocompatible polymeric materials such as a hydrogel polymer, polymethyldisiloxane,<br>
polycaprolactone, polyethylene glycol, polylactic acid, ethylene vinyl acetate, and mixtures<br>
thereof. The coatings may optionally be further covered by a suitable topcoat of<br>
fluorosilicone, polysaccarides, polyethylene glycol, phospholipids or combinations thereof to<br>
impart controlled release characteristics in the composition.<br>
[00260] Another aspect of the invention relates to modulating ABC transporter activity in a<br>
biological sample or a patient (e.g., in vitro or in vivo), which method comprises<br>
administering to the patient, or contacting said biological sample with a compound of formula<br>
I or a composition comprising said compound. The term "biological sample", as used herein,<br>
includes, without limitation, cell cultures or extracts thereof; biopsied material obtained from<br>
a mammal or extracts thereof; and blood, saliva, urine, feces, semen, tears, or other body<br>
fluids or extracts thereof.<br>
[00261] Modulation of ABC transporter activity in a biological sample is useful for a<br>
variety of purposes that are known to one of skill in the art. Examples of such purposes<br>
include, but are not limited to, the study of ABC transporters in biological and pathological<br>
phenomena; and the comparative evaluation of new modulators of ABC transporters.<br>
[00262] In yet another embodiment, a method of modulating activity of an anion channel in<br>
vitro or in vivo, is provided comprising the step of contacting said channel with a compound<br>
of formulae (I, Ic, Id, II, Ila, IIb, IIc, and IId). In preferred embodiments, the anion channel is<br>
 <br>
a chloride channel or a bicarbonate channel. In other preferred embodiments, the anion<br>
channel is a chloride channel.<br>
[00263] According to an alternative embodiment, the present invention provides a method<br>
of increasing the number of functional ABC transporters in a membrane of a cell, comprising<br>
the step of contacting said cell with a compound of formulae (I, Ic, Id, II, Ila, IIb, IIc, and<br>
IId). The term "functional ABC transporter" as used herein means an ABC transporter that is<br>
capable of transport activity. In preferred embodiments, said functional ABC transporter is<br>
CFTR.<br>
[00264] According to another preferred embodiment, the activity of the ABC transporter is<br>
measured by measuring the transmembrane voltage potential. Means for measuring the<br>
voltage potential across a membrane in the biological sample may employ any of the known<br>
methods in the art, such as optical membrane potential assay or other electrophysiological<br>
methods.<br>
[00265) The optical membrane potential assay utilizes voltage-sensitive FRET sensors<br>
described by Gonzalez and Tsien (See, Gonzalez, J. E. and R. Y. Tsien (1995) "Voltage<br>
sensing by fluorescence resonance energy transfer in single cells" Biophys J 69(4): 1272-80,<br>
and Gonzalez, J. E. and R. Y. Tsien (1997) "Improved indicators of cell membrane potential<br>
that use fluorescence resonance energy transfer" Chem Biol 4(4): 269-77) in combination<br>
with instrumentation for measuring fluorescence changes such as the Voltage/Ion Probe<br>
Reader (VIPR) (See, Gonzalez, J. E., K. Oades, et al. (1999) "Cell-based assays and<br>
instrumentation for screening ion-channel targets" Drug Discov Today 4(9): 431-439).<br>
[00266] These voltage sensitive assays are based on the change in fluorescence resonant<br>
energy transfer (FRET) between the membrane-soluble, voltage-sensitive dye, DiSBAC2(3),<br>
and a fluorescent phospholipid, CC2-DMPE, which is attached to the outer leaflet of the<br>
plasma membrane and acts as a FRET donor. Changes in membrane potential (Vm) cause the<br>
negatively charged DiSBAC2(3) to redistribute across the plasma membrane and the amount<br>
of energy transfer from CC2-DMPE changes accordingly. The changes in fluorescence<br>
emission can be monitored using VIPR™ II, which is an integrated liquid handler and<br>
fluorescent detector designed to conduct cell-based screens in 96- or 384-well microtiter<br>
plates.<br>
[00267] In another aspect the present invention provides a kit for use in measuring the<br>
activity of a ABC transporter or a fragment thereof in a biological sample in vitro or in vivo<br>
comprising (i) a composition comprising a compound of formulae (I, Ic, Id, II, Ila, IIb, IIc,<br>
and IId) or any of the above embodiments; and (ii) instructions for a.) contacting the<br>
 <br>
composition with the biological sample and b.) measuring activity of said ABC transporter or<br>
a fragment thereof. In one embodiment, the kit farther comprises instructions for a.)<br>
contacting an additional composition with the biological sample; b.) measuring the activity of<br>
said ABC transporter or a fragment thereof in the presence of said additional compound, and<br>
c.) comparing the activity of the ABC transporter in the presence of the additional compound<br>
with the density of the ABC transporter in the presence of a composition of formulae (I, Ic,<br>
Id, II, Ila, IIb, IIc, and IId). In preferred embodiments, the kit is used to measure the density<br>
of CFTR.<br>
[00268] In order that the invention described herein may be more fully understood, the<br>
following examples are set forth. It should be understood that these examples are for<br>
illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting this invention in any manner.<br>

 <br>
[00271] Benzyltriethylammonium chloride (0.O25 equivalents) and the appropriate dihalo<br>
compound (2.5 equivalents) were added to a substituted phenyl acetonitrile. The mixture was<br>
heated at 70 °C and then 50 % sodium hydroxide (10 equivalents) was slowly added to the<br>
mixture. The reaction was stirred at 70 °C for 12-24 hours to ensure complete formation of<br>
the cycloalkyl moiety and then heated at 130 °C for 24-48 hours to ensure complete<br>
conversion from the nitrile to the carboxylic acid. The dark brown / black reaction mixture<br>
was diluted with water and extracted with dichloromethane three times to remove side<br>
products. The basic aqueous solution was acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid to<br>
pH less than one and the precipitate which began to form at pH 4 was filtered and washed<br>
with I M hydrochloric acid two times. The solid material was dissolved in dichloromethane<br>
and extracted two times with I M hydrochloric acid and one time with a saturated aqueous<br>
solution of sodium chloride. The organic solution was dried over sodium sulfate and<br>
evaporated to dryness to give the cycloalkylcarboxylic acid. Yields and purities were<br>

[001015] VII. ASSAYS FOR DETECTING AND MEASURING AF508-CFTR<br>
CORRECTION PROPERTIES OF COMPOUNDS<br>
[001016] Membrane potential optical methods for assaying AF508-CFTR modulation<br>
properties of compounds<br>
[001017] The optical membrane potential assay utilized voltage-sensitive FRET sensors<br>
described by Gonzalez and Tsien (See, Gonzalez, J. E. and R. Y. Tsien (1995) "Voltage<br>
sensing by fluorescence resonance energy transfer in single cells" Biophys J 69(4): 1272-80,<br>
and Gonzalez, J. E. and R. Y. Tsien (1997) "Improved indicators of cell membrane potential<br>
that use fluorescence resonance energy transfer" Chem Biol 4(4): 269-77) in combination<br>
with instrumentation for measuring fluorescence changes such as the Voltage/Ion Probe<br>
Reader (VTPR) (See, Gonzalez, J. E., K. Oades, et al. (1999) "Cell-based assays and<br>
instrumentation for screening ion-channel targets" Drug Discov Today 4(9): 431-439).<br>
[001018] These voltage sensitive assays are based on the change in fluorescence resonant<br>
energy transfer (FRET) between the membrane-soluble, voltage-sensitive dye, DiSBAC2(3),<br>
and a fluorescent phospholipid, CC2-DMPE, which is attached to the outer leaflet of the<br>
plasma membrane and acts as a FRET donor. Changes in membrane potential (Vm) cause the<br>
negatively charged DiSBAC2(3) to redistribute across the plasma membrane and the amount<br>
of energy transfer from CC2-DMPE changes accordingly. The changes in fluorescence<br>
emission were monitored using VIPR™ II, which is an integrated liquid handler and<br>
fluorescent detector designed to conduct cell-based screens in 96- or 384-well microtiter<br>
plates.<br>
[001019] Identification of Correction Compounds<br>
[001020] To identify small molecules that correct the trafficking defect associated with<br>
AF508-CFTR; a single-addition HTS assay format was developed. The cells were incubated<br>
in serum-free medium for 16 hrs at 37 °C in the presence or absence (negative control) of test<br>
compound. As a positive control, cells plated in 384-well plates were incubated for 16 hrs at<br>
27 °C to "temperature-correct" AF508-CFTR. The cells were subsequently rinsed 3X with<br>
 <br>
Krebs Ringers solution and loaded with the voltage-sensitive dyes. To activate AF508-<br>
CFTR, 10 uM forskolin and the CFTR potentiator, genistein (20 uM), were added along with<br>
Cl"-free medium to each well. The addition of CT-free medium promoted CI" efflux in<br>
response to AF508-CFTR activation and the resulting membrane depolarization was optically<br>
monitored using the FRET-based voltage-sensor dyes.<br>
[001021) Identification of Potentiator Compounds<br>
[001023] To identify potentiators of AF508-CFTR, a double-addition HTS assay format was<br>
developed. During the first addition, a Cl'-firee medium with or without test compound was<br>
added to each well. After 22 sec, a second addition of Cl'-free medium containing 2-10 uM<br>
forskolin was added to activate AF508-CFTR. The extracellular CI" concentration following<br>
both additions was 28 mM, which promoted CI* efflux in response to AF508-CFTR activation<br>
and the resulting membrane depolarization was optically monitored using the FRET-based<br>
voltage-sensor dves.SolutionsBath Solution #1: (in mM) NaCl 160, KC14.5, CaCl2 2,<br>

[001029] Cell Culture<br>
[001030] NJH3T3 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing AF508-CFTR are used for optical<br>
measurements of membrane potential. The cells are maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 90<br>
% humidity in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10<br>
% fetal bovine serum, 1 X NEAA, P-ME, 1 X pen/strep, and 25 mM HEPES in 175 cm2<br>
culture flasks. For all optical assays, the cells were seeded at 30,000/well in 384-well<br>
matrigel-coated plates and cultured for 2 hrs at 37 °C before culturing at 27 °C for 24 hrs. for<br>
the potentiator assay. For the correction assays, the cells are cultured at 27 °C or 37 °C with<br>
and without compounds for 16 — 24 hoursElectrophvsiological Assays for assaying AF508-<br>
CPTR modulation properties of compoundsUssing Chamber AssayUssing chamber<br>
experiments were performed on polarized epithelial cells expressing AF508-CFTR to further<br>
characterize the AF508-CFTR modulators identified in the optical assays. FRT^508"0™<br>
 <br>
epithelial cells grown on Costar Snapwell cell culture inserts were mounted in an Ussing<br>
chamber (Physiologic Instruments, Inc., San thego, CA), and the monolayers were<br>
continuously short-circuited using a Voltage-clamp System (Department of Bioengineering,<br>
University of Iowa, IA, and, Physiologic Instruments, Inc., San thego, CA). Transepithelial<br>
resistance was measured by applying a 2-mV pulse. Under these conditions, the FRT<br>
epithelia demonstrated resistances of 4 KC1/ cm2 or more. The solutions were maintained at<br>
27 °C and bubbled with air. The electrode offset potential and fluid resistance were corrected<br>
using a cell-free insert. Under these conditions, the current reflects the flow of CI" through<br>
AF508-CFTR expressed in the apical membrane. The Isc was digitally acquired using an<br>
MP100A-CE intertace and AcqKnowledge software (v3.2.6; BIOPAC Systems, Santa<br>
Barbara, CA).<br>
[001034] Identification of Correction Compounds<br>
[001035] Typical protocol utilized a basolateral to apical membrane CI' concentration<br>
grathent To set up this grathent, normal ringer was used on the basolateral membrane,<br>
whereas apical NaCl was replaced by equimolar sodium gluconate (titrated to pH 7.4 with<br>
NaOH) to give a large CI" concentration grathent across the epithelium. All experiments<br>
were performed with intact monolayers. To fully activate AF508-CFTR, forskolin (10 uM)<br>
and the PDE inhibitor, IBMX (100 uM), were applied followed by the addition of the CFTR<br>
potentiator, genistein (50 uM).<br>
[001036] As observed in other cell types, incubation at low temperatures of FRT cells stably<br>
expressing AF508-CFTR increases the functional density of CFTR in the plasma membrane.<br>
To determine the activity of correction compounds, the cells were incubated with 10 uM of<br>
the test compound for 24 hours at 37°C and were subsequently washed 3X prior to recording.<br>
The cAMP- and genistein-mediated Isc in compound-treated cells was normalized to the<br>
27°C and 37°C controls and expressed as percentage activity. Preincubation of the cells with<br>
the correction compound significantly increased the cAMP- and genistein-mediated Isc<br>
compared to the 37°C controls.<br>
[001037] Identification of Potentiator Compounds<br>
[001038] Typical protocol utilized a basolateral to apical membrane CI" concentration<br>
grathent. To set up this grathent, normal ringers was used on the basolateral membrane and<br>
was permeabilized with nystatin (360 jig/ml), whereas apical NaCl was replaced by<br>
equimolar sodium gluconate (titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH) to give a large CI" concentration<br>
grathent across the epithelium. All experiments were performed 30 min after nystatin<br>
permeabilization. Forskolin (10 uM) and all test compounds were added to both sides of me<br>
 <br>
cell culture inserts. Tne erticacy of the putative Δrous-CKl K potentiators was compared to<br>
that of the known potentiator, genistein.<br>

[001041] Apical solution (in mM): Same as basolateral solution with NaCl replaced with<br>
Na Gluconate (135).<br>
[001042] Cell Culture<br>
[001043] Fisher rat epithelial (FRT) cells expressing AF508-CFTR (FRT^508-0"*) were<br>
used for Ussing chamber experiments for the putative AF508-CFTR modulators identified<br>
from our optical assays. The cells were cultured on Costar Snapwell cell culture inserts and<br>
cultured for five days at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium<br>
supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 ug/ml streptomycin.<br>
Prior to use for characterizing the potentiator activity of compounds, the cells were incubated<br>
at 27 °C for 16 - 48 hrs to correct for the AF508-CFTR. To determine the activity of<br>
corrections compounds, the cells were incubated at 27 °C or 37 °C with and without the<br>
compounds for 24 hours.<br>
[001044] The macroscopic AF508-CFTR current (IAFSOS) in temperature- and test compound-<br>
corrected NIH3T3 cells stably expressing AF508-CFTR were monitored using the perforated-<br>
patch, whole-cell recording. Briefly, voltage-clamp recordings of Wsos were performed at<br>
room temperature using an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc.,<br>
Foster City, CA). All recordings were acquired at a sampling frequency of 10 kHz and low-<br>
pass filtered at 1 kHz. Pipettes had a resistance of 5 - 6 MQ when filled with the intracellular<br>
solution. Under these recording conditions, the calculated reversal potential for CI" (Eci) a*<br>
room temperature was -28 mV. All recordings had a seal resistance &gt; 20 Gfi and a series<br>
resistance 
PC equipped with a Digidata 1320 A/D intertace in conjunction with Clampex 8 (Axon<br>
Instruments Inc.). The bath-contained 
rate of 2 ml/min using a gravity-driven perfusion system.<br>
[001045] Identification of Correction Compounds<br>
[001046] To determine the activity of correction compounds for increasing the density of<br>
functional AF508-CFTR in the plasma membrane, we used the above-described perforated-<br>
 <br>
patch-recording techniques to measure the current density following 24-hr treatment with the<br>
correction compounds. To fully activate AF508-CFTR, 10 uM forskolin and 20 uM genistein<br>
were added to the cells. Under our recording conditions, the current density following 24-hr<br>
incubation at 27°C was higher than that observed following 24-hr incubation at 37 °C. These<br>
results are consistent with the known effects of low-temperature incubation on the density of<br>
AF508-CFTR in the plasma membrane. To determine the effects of correction compounds on<br>
CFTR current density, the cells were incubated with 10 uM of the test compound for 24<br>
hours at 37°C and the current density was compared to the 27°C and 37°C controls (%<br>
activity). Prior to recording, the cells were washed 3X with extracellular recording medium<br>
to remove any remaining test compound. Preincubation with 10 uM of correction<br>
compounds significantly increased the cAMP- and genistein-dependent current compared to<br>
the 37°C controls.<br>
[001047] Identification of Potentiator Compounds<br>
[001048] The ability of AF508-CFTR potentiators to increase the macroscopic AF508-CFTR<br>
CI" current (IAFSOS) in NIH3T3 cells stably expressing AF508-CFTR was also investigated<br>
using perforated-patch-recording techniques. The potentiators identified from the optical<br>
assays evoked a dose-dependent increase in Wsos with similar potency and efficacy observed<br>
in the optical assays. In all cells examined, the reversal potential before and during<br>
potentiator application was around -30 mV, which is the calculated Eci (-28 mV).<br>

[001052] Cell Culture<br>
[001053] NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing AF508-CFTR are used for whole-cell<br>
recordings. The cells are maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 90 % humidity in Dulbecco's<br>
modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10 % fetal bovine serum, I X<br>
NEAA, 0-ME, 1 X pen/strep, and 25 mM HEPES in 175 cm2 culture flasks. For whole-cell<br>
recordings, 2,500 - 5,000 cells were seeded on poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips and<br>
cultured for 24 - 48 hrs at 27 °C before use to test the activity of potentiators; and incubated<br>
with or without the correction compound at 37 °C for measuring the activity of correctors.<br>
 <br>
[001054] The single-channel activities of temperature-corrected AF508-CF1R stably<br>
expressed in NIH3T3 cells and activities of potentiator compounds were observed using<br>
excised inside-out membrane patch. Briefly, voltage-clamp recordings of single-channel<br>
activity were performed at room temperature with an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier<br>
(Axon Instruments Inc.). All recordings were acquired at a sampling frequency of 10 kHz<br>
and low-pass filtered at 400 Hz. Patch pipettes were fabricated'from Coming Kovar Sealing<br>
#7052 glass (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) and had a resistance of 5 - 8<br>
MH when filled with the extracellular solution. The AF508-CFTR was activated after<br>
excision, by adding 1 mM Mg-ATP, and 75 nM of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase,<br>
catalytic subunit (PKA; Promega Corp. Madison, WT). After channel activity stabilized, the<br>
patch was perifused using a gravity-driven microperfusion system. The inflow was placed<br>
adjacent to the patch, resulting in complete solution exchange within 1-2 sec. To maintain<br>
AF508-CFTR activity during the rapid perifusion, the nonspecific phosphatase inhibitor F"<br>
(10 mM NaF) was added to the bath solution. Under these recording conditions, channel<br>
activity remained constant throughout the duration of the patch recording (up to 60 min).<br>
Currents produced by positive charge moving from the intra- to extracellular solutions<br>
(anions moving in the opposite direction) are shown as positive currents. The pipette<br>
potential (Vp) was maintained at 80 mV.<br>
[001055] Channel activity was analyzed from membrane patches containing 
channels. The maximum number of simultaneous openings determined the number of active<br>
channels during the course of an experiment. To determine the single-channel current<br>
amplitude, the data recorded from 120 sec of AF508-CFTR activity was filtered "off-line" at<br>
100 Hz and then used to construct all-point amplitude histograms that were fitted with<br>
multigaussian functions using Bio-Patch Analysis software (Bio-Logic Comp. France). The<br>
total microscopic current and open probability (Pc) were determined from 120 sec of channel<br>
activity. The P0 was determined using the Bio-Patch software or from the relationship P0 =<br>
I/i(N), where I = mean current, i = single-channel current amplitude, and N = number of<br>
active channels in patch.<br>
