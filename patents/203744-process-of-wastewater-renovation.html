TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
"Process of Wastewater Renovation"<br>
(a) INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY Bombay (b) having administrative office at Powai, Mumbai 400076, State of Maharashtra, India and (c) an autonomous educational Institute, and established in India under the Institutes of Technology Act 1961.<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for treating wastewater in.a biofilter system consisting of soil, bacterial culture and geophagus earthworm Pheretima elongata, and optionally mineral additives. This system is referred as Soil Biotechnology<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The demand for water has gone up and the need to renovate and reuse water has become imperative. In developing countries existing technologies for wastewater renovation are viable only in very large-scale operations and so cost of operation becomes prohibitive and lead to improper functioning and maintenance of plants [Arceivala, S. J., Wastewater Treatment for Pollution control, TMH publications New Delhi, India, 1998]. Even the treated water in many cases breed mosquitoes thereby compounding the problem.<br>
Several technologies are available for treatment of wastewater containing COD, BOD, nitrogen, phosphorous, suspended solids, bacteria, color, odor etc. The presence of these pollutants in water is a form of toxicity and should therefore be substantially removed. Activated Sludge, Trickling filter, Oxidation Ponds are technologies currently in operation. All these technologies are energy intensive and viable only in very large scale. They produce residues whose disposal can create problems. Treated water is generally not fish compatible and such water discharged into drinking water sources endanger lives of dependent population [Bhawalkar, U.S., "Vermiculture Bioconversion of Organic Residues", Ph.D. Thesis, Dept. of Chemical Engineering, IIT Bombay, 1996; Pattanaik B.R., "Processing of Wastewaters in Soil Filters", ", Ph.D. Thesis, Dept. of Chemical Engineering, IIT Bombay, 2000]. Land treatment of wastewater has been known for long. Here intermittent hydraulic loading of 0.001 m3/m2.hr is permissible and treated water is not easy to recover for reuse. Root zone treatment technology is similar to land treatment methods and have similar requirement and features [Nivens, Jr.; Kirk, N, US Patent 6264838, "Onsite Wastewater"Recycling System"]. Constructed wetland treatment technology has been in practice in many areas. In this case wetland - rock - aquatic ecology is engaged wherein subsurface flow brings about treatment.<br>
2<br><br>
Hydraulic loading of 0.001-0.005 m3/m2.hr is observed [Behrends; Leslie, L; US Patent 5863433, "Reciprocating Subsurface Flow, Constructed wetland for improving Wastewater Treatment"].<br>
Use of surface dwelling redworm Eisenia foetida in vermifilters is known [Lee, K. E., Earthworms - Their ecology and relationship with soils &amp; land use, Academic Press, 1985]. As experienced there are problems of maintaining them in the filter. This is because they cannot live in their own excreta and as conditions arising from accumulation of waste products become adverse they migrate away. [Bhawalkar "Vermiculture Bioconversion of Organic Residues", Ph.D. Thesis, Dept. of Chemical Engineering, I IT Bombay, 1996.; Pattanaik B.R., "Processing of Wastewaters in Soil Filters", Ph.D. Thesis, Dept. of Chemical Engineering, IIT Bombay, 2000]<br>
In general, available technologies do not use soil system because they tend to choke and become non-functional.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
An appropriate geophagus earthworm culture Pheretima elongataus engaged. The said culture is developed in an environment comprising plants with t§p-foots\ and/or adventitious roots space by providing 20-30 gm/m2.d organics such as wild ruminant animal dung which contains potent bacterial culture, straw and leaf litter, moisture 30-40 percent and preferred mineral powder less than 1000 n size @ 5-10 g/m2.d. This culture is harvested for use as source culture of earthworms and desired bacteria.<br>
7<br><br>
An appropriate formulated soil media 0.3-0.4m thick produced by combining animal dung (15 - 50%), preferred mineral powder of particle size 500 -1000 \x (50 - 85%), bacterial and earthworm culture 1 percent all processed in an environment comprising plants with tap roots, and/or adventitious roots for 7 days by maintaining 30-40% moisture.<br>
Preferred mineral powder from natural sources containing silica (25-30 % Si),<br>
alumina (6-8 % Al), iron (1-6 % Fe), Potassium (2 -8 %), Calcium (2-10 %),<br>
Magnesium (1-3 %) Phosphorous (0.003- 0.1%) and also containing micronutrients.<br>
Suitable Provision for distribution of wastewater. By providing piped delivery to all<br>
parts of filter and distribution partsto deliver water uniformly.<br>
An underdrain of large boulders 0.3-0.4m thick, 1/100 - 1/500 sloping floor and a<br>
collection tank at a suitable location.<br>
Process control is achieved by adjusting loading rates, addition of mineral powder so<br>
as to eliminate bioindicators of abnormality viz., mosquitoes, rats, odor, plant disease<br>
etc.<br>

A contraption of the system involves upto 10 stages with each stage having a free board of 1.8 -2.0m to maintain and also to carry out routine operation.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the treated waste water from any one of the stages in the bio tower may be re-circulated to any other stage to achieve selective denitrification by contacting the treated water with the layered stage that contains higher amounts of BOD/COD.<br>
8<br><br>
When soil systems are used for waster water renovation, the system tends to choke. The role of the earthworm - bacterial culture is to ensure uninterrupted operation. This is reflected in the high, values of rate constants for the different solutes BOD, COD, Ammonium Nitrogen, Nitrate Nitrogen, Suspended solids, Color, Odor, bacteria (Pattanaik, 2000) to be removed as described in the examples. The invention is now described and illustrated with non-limiting examples.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the system employed. A wastewater treatment plant 25.0m x 10.0m x 1.0m below ground was constructed. A slope of 1/100 was provided on the bottom surface of the filter. The bottom surface was made impervious. A tank for collection of renovated water was suitably provided. The filter fillings consisted of 300 - 400 mm layer of formulated earthworm Pheretima elongata soil media and 0.3 - 0.4m under drain of stone rubble of sizes varying from 200mm to 2 mm. The performance of filter operated in batch mode is given in Table 1. Hydraulic loading of 0.02-0.06 m3/m2.hr has been observed. Table 2 shows the results of continuous operation. Biofilter filling details are given in Fig.2. BOD, COD, NH4-N, N03-N, phosphate (without using additives), suspended solids, color, odor, bacteria removal can be achieved. Dissolved oxygen improves significantly due to renovation. Fish inoculated in the filtrate collection tank showed no fatality during operation and storage of treated water, indicating fish compatible water is produced. Redox potential of water improves substantially from 50mV to 800mV indicating aerobic environment and pathogen destruction.<br>

Table 1: Batch Biofilteration results for Pheretima elongata cultured Soil filters<br><br><br><br>
Experimental conditions: Vb = 84.0m3;Vr= 10m3/hr; Vf = 0.0 ; V1 = 30m3 .batch Time = 4 hr<br>
The typical values for the inlet (initial) and outlet (final) wastewater are shown in Table 1 &amp; 2. Variations in input do take place, but the desirable output water quality is always obtained by adjusting the process operating conditions.<br>
It is relevant to note that good phosphate removal is observed without using additives. Wherever higher removal is needed various additives viz. Lime, ferric sulfate can be used to reduce the phosphates to desired levels.<br>
The operation of this system under batch and continuous modes reveals that earthworm culture Pheretima elongata ensures clogging free operation, reproducible media reactivity and absence of abnormal bioindicators and water out put parameters indicating excellent water quality. No fish fatality during the operation is a unique feature of the process.<br>

Table 2: Continuous Biofilteration results for Pheretima elongata cultured Soil filter<br><br><br><br>
Vb - 84.0m3; Vr= 2.4m3/hr; Vf = 5.0m3/h;<br>
Example 2<br>
A schematic of a biotower is shown in Fig.3. The results of the use of the biotower for wastewater renovation are given in Table 3. A Biotower is constructed using 6 vessels of 30.0L each mounted on a frame vertically one above the other. Each vessel contains the SBT media.<br>
In a typical experiment carbonaceous substrate (glucose / sucrose) is charged form the top of the biotower at a predetermined flow rate. The outlet at the bottom of the filter is collected and analyzed for COD. ORP probes were inserted all along the tower profile and probe response was recorded in data acquisition system.<br>
The results show that very high efficiency removal of COD can be achieved. However the overall rate of COD removal for simple molecule (BOD) could be 0.3-0.5 kg/m3.d. The reactivity of the bed and earthworm activity all along the depth found to be uniform. In view of the multiple stages the water quality parameters (BOD, COD, Nitrogen, suspended Solids, color, odor, bacteria, virus) as required can be achieved.<br>
11<br><br>
Table  3:   Results  of Biotower studies  using  6  stage  Pheretima cultured biotower<br><br>
Example 3<br>
In these experiments mineral powder is contacted with the liquid substrate containing the pollutant (natural &amp; synthetic) in conical flask. The flask is mounted on shaker incubator to facilitate solid - liquid contact typically for 30min. The temperature is maintained at 28 - 30C. The pollutant level in the liquid is determined by filtering off the solids from the sample reaction mixture. Results of sewage water contacted with additives are given below. Table 4 shows the effect of additives in wastewater renovation. The results show that use of mineral powder in the range 250 mg/L brings about substantial removal of pollution level in the wastewater.<br>

ANALYTICAL METHODS<br>
Analytical Methods engaged for the analysis of COD, BOD, Ammonium Nitrogen, suspended solids, Color have been adopted from "Standard Methods for examination of Water and Wastewater", American Public Health Association, 18th<br>
12<br><br>
edition, Washington, 1992; Manual for Photometer SQ 118, E- Merck (Germany) 1997; Standard Methods of Water Analysis Handbook, Hach, USA (1997).<br>
Bioindicators such as fish, mosquito, rats and flies have been identified visually and reported as our visual observation.<br>
Bioindicators as a tool for assessment of pollution index of environment has been adopted from "Aquatic Chemistry" by Stumm, Werner; Morgan, J. J.; Aquatic Chemistry - an introduction emphasizing equilibrium in natural waters, 2nd edition, Wiley Interscience, NY, 1981.<br>
Tests for microbiological indicators like Coliform organisms, Streptococci, Staphylococci, Kleibsella pneumonie, Salmonella, Shigella, Entamoeba hystolytica, Polio virus, Hepatitis virus were carried out using methodology from "APHA, 1992".<br>
The advantages of SBT process are 1) land area saving can be designed 2) process engages local land resources 3) energy consumption is low as natural methods of oxygen supply is engaged 4) produces no residues for disposal which is a major issue in most waste water treatment plants. 5) very stable against load variations and 6) it is a green technology.<br>
The unique features of this green technology are that the BOD, COD, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, suspended solid, colour, odour, bacteria, sufficient increase in dissolved oxygen, no residues for disposal are all made possible in a single tank constructed in the ground with its top open to atmosphere. In addition use of SBT achieves space saving, high removal efficiency, engages material that occurs locally, consumes no power for oxygen delivery to the system, leaves no residues for disposal and is very stable against shock loading. These advantages are unmatched by any known technology.   ""<br>
