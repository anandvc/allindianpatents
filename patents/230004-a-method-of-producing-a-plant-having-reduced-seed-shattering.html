				<td>METHODS AND MEANS FOR DELAYING SEED SHATTERING<br>
IN PLANTS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to plant genetic engineering. In particular, the invention relates to methods and compositions for modulating properties of fruit dehiscence in plants, particularly Brassicaceae plants, specifically to improved methods and means for reducing seed shattering, or reducing seed shattering until after harvest, in plants such as Brassicaceae plants, particularly the Brassicaceae plants grown for oil production, to a degree which is agronomically important<br>
Background<br>
Siliques or pods from Brassicaceae plants release their seeds through a process called dehiscence. A silique consists of two carpels joined margin to margin. The suture between the margins forms a thick rib, called replum. As pod maturity approaches, the two valves separate progressively from the replum, along designated lines of weakness in the pod, eventually resulting in the shattering of the seeds that were attached to the replum. The dehiscence zone defines the exact location of the valve dissociation.<br>
Shedding of seed (also referred to as "seed shatter" or "pod shatter") by mature pods, before or during crop harvest, is a universal phenomenon with crops that develop dry dehiscent fruits. Premature seed shatter results in a reduced seed recovery, which represents a problem in crops which are grown primarily for the seeds, such as oil producing Brassicaceae plants, particularly oilseed rape. Another problem related to premature seed shattering is an increase in volunteer growth in the subsequent crop year. In oilseed rape, pod-shatter related yield losses typically range from 10 to 25%, but can reach up to 50%, depending on the weather conditions.<br>
Current commercial oilseed rape varieties are extremely susceptible to shattering. Kadkol et al. [(1986), Aust J. Biol. 34: 79] reported increased resistance towards<br><br>
shattering in a single, Australian accession of rape. Variation in pod maturation has further been observed in mutants of rape stemming from irradiated seeds [Luczkiewicz (1987), Proc. 7th Int Rapeseed Congress 2: 463]. However the traditional methods for breeding have been unsuccessful in introducing shatter resistance into rape cultivais, without interference in other desirable traits such as early flowering, maturity and blackleg resistance [Prakash and Chopra (1990), Genetical Research 56: 1].<br>
Several genes, which promote or inhibit pod dehiscence have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana through mutant analysis. These genes are encoding putative MADS box and basic helix-Loop-Helix mutants. Combined mutants in both SHATTERPROOF! (SHP1; initially referred to as AGL1) and SHATTERPROOF2 (SHP2; initially referred to as AGL5) result in indehiscent siliques (i.e. siliques which remain closed upon maturity in Arabidopsis thaliana) (Liljegren et aL, 2000, Nature 404,766-770). Similarly, mutants in the INDEHISCENT gene in Arabidopsis thaliana (PCT publication WO 01/79517), as well as in ALCATRAZ (Rajani et aL 2001, Current Biology 11, 1914-1922) interfered with pod dehiscence leading to podshatter resistance. Constitutive expression of FRUITFUL (FUL), a repressor of SHP and IND9 in Arabidopsis thaliana also resulted in indehiscent siliques (Ferrandiz et aL9 2000, Science, 289, 436-438). These transcription factors are thus regulating the development of the valves, including the valve margins and the dehiscence zone.<br>
Genes for a number of hydrolytic enzymes, such as endopolygalacturonases, which play a role, during pod dehiscence, in the programmed breakdown of the dehiscence zone in pods from Brassicaceae plants have also been identified (see e.g. WO 97/13865; Petersen et al, Plant. Mol. Biol., 1996, 31:517-527).<br>
To isolate mutant alleles corresponding to ind, ale or shpl-shp2 in economically important Brassicaceae plants, such as oilseed rape, is a laborious and time consuming task. Moreover, such isolation may be complicated by the amphidiploidy in oilseed rape and the consequent functional redundancy of the corresponding genes.<br><br>
It has been described that the expression of the ALQ IND, AGL1 and AGL5 genes or their homologues, may be downregulated using gene silencing techniques such as ... antisense suppression or cosuppression (WO99/00503; WO01/79517; WO0159122).<br>
Vancanneyt et ai, 2002 (XIII International Conference on Arabidopsis Research, Sevilla, Spain June 28-July 2; 2002) reported that the expression of FUL from A. thaliana under control of a CaMV 35S promoter in oilseed rape, resulted in a number of podshatter resistant transformants. Pods of such podshatter resistant lines had no dehiscence zone, and opening of the pods could only be achieved by random fracture of the valves by applying considerable pressure.<br>
Vancanneyt et aL, 2002 (XIII International Conference on Arabidopsis Research, Sevilla, Spain June 28-July 2; 2002) also reported that silencing of the IND gene in Arabidopsis thaliana using so-called dsRNA silencing techniques resulted in almost complete podshatter resistance. 98% of the transgenic Arabidopsis lines developed siliques, which did not open along the valve suture, and could only be opened by applying considerable pressure to the valves.<br>
Furthermore, experiments described in this application (see below) indicate that silencing of the IND gene in Brassica napus using dsRNA gene silencing techniques, whereby the dsRNA sequence is identical to one of the IND homologues of Brassica napus, results in podshatter resistant lines with pods that bearly open by random fracture of the valves in a standardized random impact test.<br>
It is important to realize that while seed shattering constitutes an important problem in oilseed rape culture, which may be solved by developing podshatter resistant lines, ultimately, separation of the seeds from the pods is still required. In normal agricultural practice this is achieved by threshing of the pods by a combine harvester. Threshing of the pods by a combine harvester must be complete and must cause minimum damage to the seeds thus released. However, as pod strength increases, the more severe action required to thresh them causes an unacceptable level of damage to the seed. The pods of podshatter resistant Brassicaceae plants should thus not be so strong that they cannot be threshed in a combine harvester (Bruce et al. 2001, J, Agric. Engng Res.180, 343-350).<br><br>
The art thus remains defective in providing method and means for reducing seed shattering in Brassicaceae plants, particularly in oilseed rape, while retaining a sufficient threshability.<br>
These and other objects are achieved by the present invention, as indicated by the various embodiments described in the summary of the invention, detailed description and claims.<br>

Detailed description of different embodiments of the invention<br>
The invention is based on the unexpected observation that moderate dsRNA gene silencing of genes involved in the development of the dehiscence zone and valve margins of pods in Brassicaceae plants, particularly oilseed rape plants, allows the isolation of transgenic lines with increased pod shatter resistance and reduced seed shattering, the pods of which however may still be opened along the dehiscence zone by applying limited physical forces. This contrasts with transgenic Brassicaceae plants, wherein the dsRNA silencing is more pronounced, such as the ones described in the art, which result in transgenic lines with indehiscent pods, which no longer can be opened along the dehiscence zone, and which only open after applying significant physical forces by random breakage of the pods, whereby the seeds remain predominantly within the remains of the pods.<br>
Moderate dsRNA gene silencing of genes can be conveniently achieved by e.g. operably linking the dsRNA coding DNA region to a relatively weak promoter region, or by e.g. choosing the sequence identity between the complementary sense and antisense part of the dsRNA encoding DNA region to be lower than 90% and preferably within a range of about 60 % to 80%.<br>
Without intending to limit the invention to a particular mode of action, it is thought that the silencing of the expression level of the endogenous genes involved in dehiscence zone and valve margin development in these instances is incomplete, such that the expression of the endogenous gene in the presence of the gene-silencing chimeric genes according to the invention is about 5% to about 20%, particularly about 10% of the expression of the endogenous gene in the absence of the gene-~ silencing chimeric genes according to the invention.<br><br>
Thus, in one embodiment of the invention, a method is provided for reducing seed shattering in a Brassicaceae plant by creation of a population of transgenic lines of a Brassicaceae plant, wherein said transgenic lines of said population exhibit variation in podshatter resistance- This population may be obtained by introducing a chimeric gene into ceils of a Brassicaceae plant, to create transgenic cells, whereby the chimeric gene comprises a plant -expressible promoter and a 3' end region comprising transcription termination and polyadenylation signals functioning in cells of a Brassicaceae plant, operably linked to a DNA region which when transcribed yields a double-stranded RNA molecule capable of reducing the expression of a gene endogenous to a Brassicaceae plant, involved in the development of a dehiscence zone and valve margin of a pod of said Brassicaceae plant The RNA molecule comprises a first (sense) RNA region and second (antisense) RNA region whereby<br>
-	the first RNA region comprises a nucleotide sequence of at least 19 consecutive nucleotides having about 94% sequence identity to the nucleotide sequence of the endogenous gene;<br>
-	the second RNA region comprises a nucleotide sequence complementary to the at least 19 consecutive nucleotides of the first RNA region;<br>
-	the first and second RNA region are capable of base-pairing to form a double stranded RNA molecule between the mentioned at least 19 consecutive nucleotides of the first and second region.<br>
Expression of the chimeric gene in Brassicaceae plants increases podshatter resistance compared to podshatter resistance in an untransformed Brassicaceae plant, while however maintaining an agronomically relevant threshability of the pods. After regeneration of transgenic lines from the transgenic cells comprising the chimeric genes according to the invention, a podshatter resistant plant can be selected from the generated population.<br>
As used herein, «a gene involved in development of a dehiscence zone and valve margins of a pod » refers to a gene, which when mutated in a plant, leads to the development of pods wherein the dehiscence zone and/or the suture of the pod is less or not developed, either alone, or in combination with mutations in other such genes. These genes include the INDEHISCENT gene from Arabidopsis thaliana, the ALCATRAZ gene from Arabidopsis thaliana, the SHATTERPROOFl gene from Arabidopsis thaliana or the SHATTERPROOFl gene from Arabidopsis thaliana or a<br><br>
homologous gene thereof. These genes encode proteins comprising MADS box or basic Helix-Loop-Helix domains and are believed to be transcriptional activators.<br>
Nucleotide sequences of these genes or parts thereof can be found in databases and have the following accession numbers: AT-SHP1 (M55553; AV557878; AV556852); AT-SHP2 (M55550; BG459390): AT-77VD (AX320925); a homologue of AT-IND from Brassica rqpa subsp. pekinenis (AT002234); KT-ALC (AX211753; AX211755; AX211760). All these nucleotide sequences are hereby incorporated specifically by reference.<br>
DNA fragments comprising variant sequences of the above mentioned nucleotide sequences can be isolated from other Brassicaceae plants, particularly from other oilseed rape plants, subspecies or varieties by methods commonly known in the other. These methods include hybridization under stringent conditions of genomic or cDNA libraries derived from such other plants, subspecies or varieties with a probe consisting of part or ail of any of the above mentioned genes.<br>
Such variants of genes involved in dehiscence zone and valve margin development or suitable parts thereof may also be identified and isolated using e.g. polymerase chain reaction amplification using an appropriate pair of oligonucleotides having at least about 16 contiguous nucleotides, particularly at least about 50 contiguous nucleotides, more particularly at least about 100 contiguous nucleotides of the nucleotide sequence of the above mentioned genes involved in dehiscence zone and valve margin development. Preferably, the sequence of the oligonucleotides is derived from parts of the nucleotide sequence of the genes involved in development of dehiscence zone and valve margins of pods of Brassicaceae plants, which are different from those parts of these genes encoding common protein motives such as MADS boxes or K-regions or basic heiix-loop-helix regions. Examples of PCR amplified sequences of genes involved in the development of dehiscence zone and valve margins of pods of Brassicaceae plants are DNA molecules having the sequence of SEQ ID NO 2 or SEQ ED No 3. Examples of nucleotide sequences of suitable oligonucleotides primers to amplify parts of genes involved in the development of dehiscence zone and valve margins of pods of Brassicaceae plants are represented in SEQ ID No 4 to SEQ ID<br><br>
"Stringent hybridization conditions" as used herein mean that hybridization will generally occur if there is at least 95% and preferably at least 97% sequence identity between the probe and the target sequence. Examples of stringent hybridization conditions are overnight incubation in a solution comprising 50% formamide, 5 x SSC (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5x Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 fig/ml denatured, sheared carrier DNA such as salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the hybridization support in 0.1 x SSC at approximately 65 °C. Other hybridization and wash conditions are well known and are exemplified in Sambrook et al9 Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor, NY (1989), particularly chapter 11.<br>
As used herein, "a gene endogenous to a Brassicaceae plant" is a gene that naturally occurs in the species of the Brassicaceae family that has been chosen for modulation of the pod shatter resistance.<br>
As used herein, « an agronomically relevant threshability » refers to the resistance of a pod, particularly an oilseed rape pod, to opening along the dehiscence zone of the pod with concurrent release of the seeds, upon application of physical forces that allow complete opening of the pods while preventing damage to the seeds, as they are used e.g. in a combine harvester. A good correlation has been found between the half-life time of pods in a random impact test and their threshability. Random impact tests (RITs) and algorithms to define the half-life time of pods in such RTTs have been described in Bruce et al.9 2001 (J. Agric. Engng Res. 80, 343-350) and Morgan et at.&gt; 1988 (Fields Crop Research 58, 153-165). Both publications are hereby incorporated by reference. Briefly, a sample of immature pods is placed in a closed drum together with steel balls, and the drum is then vigorously agitated for increasing periods of times (e.g. 5s, 10s, 20s, 40s). After each period, the drum is opened and the number of broken and damaged pods is counted. The most accurate estimation of the level of shattering resistance for each line is calculated by fitting a linear x linear curve to all the available data and estimating the time take for half of the pods within a sample to be broken ("pod shatter half life"). It is important however that pods open mainly along the dehiscence zone,  and are not simply pulverized,  as may occur with indehiscent pods. Pod shatter half lives of oilseed rape, as determined in a RIT, which<br><br>
correspond to agronomically relevant threshability should not exceed 60 seconds. Typical values for control lines of commercially available oilseed rape varieties are about 10 seconds. Thus, lines with improved pod shatter resistance with agronomically relevant threshability have a pod shatter half life in RTT between about 10 and about 60 seconds, preferably between about 20 and about 60 seconds, particularly between about 40 and about 60 seconds.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the methods of the invention, the moderate gene silencing can be achieved by employing a relatively weak plant expressible promoter.<br>
As used herein, the term "promoter" denotes any DNA which is recognized and bound (directly and indirectly) by a DNA-dependent RNA-polymerase during initiation of transcription. A promoter includes the transcription initiation site, and binding sites for transcription initiation factors and RNA polymerase, and can comprise various other sites (e.g. enhancers), at which gene expression regulatory proteins may bind.<br>
The term "regulatory region", as used herein, means any DNA, that is involved in driving transcription and controlling (i.e. regulating) the timing and level of transcription of a given DNA sequence, such as a DNA coding for a protein or polypeptide. For example, a 5' regulatory region (or "promoter region") is a dNA sequence located upstream (I.e. 5') of a coding sequence and which comprises the promoter and the 5*-untranslated leader sequence. A 3' regulatory region is a DNA sequence located downstream (i.e. 3') of the coding sequence and comprises suitable transcription termination and or regulation signals, including one or more polyadenylation signals.<br>
As used herein, the term "plant-expressible promoter" means a DNA sequence that is capable of controlling (initiating) transcription in a plant cell This includes any promoter of plant origin, but also any promoter of non-plant origin which is capable of directing transcription in a plant cell, i.e. certain promoters of viral or bacterial origin such as the CaMV35S promoter (Hapster et aL 1988, Mol. Gen. Genet. 212, 182-190), the subterranean clover virus promoter No 4 or No 7 (WO9606932) or 1-DNA gene promoters.<br><br>
As used herein "a relatively weak plant expressible promoter" is a promoter which initiates and controls transcription of the operably linked DNA fragments about 10 to about 100 times less efficient that an optimal CaMV35S promoter. Relatively weak plant expressible promoters include the promoters or promoter regions from the opine synthase genes of Agrobacterium spp. such as the promoter or promoter region of the nopaline synthase, the promoter or promoter region of the octopine synthase, the promoter or promoter region of the mannopine synthase, the promoter or promoter region of the agropine synthase and any plant expressible promoter with comparably activity in transcription initation. Other relatively weak plant expressible promoters may be dehiscence zone selective promoters, or promoters expressed predominantly or selectively in dehiscence zone and/or valve margins of Brassicaceae pods, particularly oilseed rape pods, such as the promoters described in W097/13865.<br>
In this embodiment of the invention, the chimeric gene may comprise a transcribed DNA region encoding a dsRNA, wherein the sense and antisense RNA regions comprise a nucleotide sequence which has a high degree of sequence identity with the endogenous gene (or its complement) of the Brassicaceae plant, the pods of which are to rendered more resistant. Thus, sense and antisense RNA regions may comprise at least about 50, 100 , 200, 500 or more consecutive nucleotides having about 90 % to about 100% sequence identity to the endogenous gene of the Brassicaceae plant or its complement.<br>
For the purpose of this invention, the "sequence identity" of two related nucleotide or amino acid sequences, expressed as a percentage, refers to the number of positions in the two optimally aligned sequences which have identical residues (xlOO) divided by the number of positions compared. A gap, i.e. a position in an alignment where a residue is present in one sequence but not in the other is regarded as a position with non-identical residues. The alignment of the two sequences is performed by the Needleman and Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch 1970) Computer-assisted sequence alignment, can be conveniently performed using standard software program such as GAP which is part of the Wisconsin Package Version 10.1 (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) using the default scoring matrix with a "gap creation penalty of 50 and a gap extension penalty of 3.<br><br>
It will be clear that whenever nucleotide sequences of RNA molecules are defined by reference to nucleotide sequence of corresponding DNA molecules, the thymine (T) in the nucleotide sequence should be replaced by uracil (U). Whether reference is made to RNA or DNA molecules will be clear from the context of the application.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the moderate gene silencing can be achieved by employing a first and second RNA region that have a sequence identity to an endogenous gene involved in dehiscence zone and valve margin development of the pod, or part thereof or their complementary sequences, ranging between about 60 to about 88% sequence identity, preferably ranging between about 60 to about 75 % sequence identity. The length of the sense and antisense RNA regions may be at least 50, 100, 200, 500 or more nucleotides.<br>
It has been observed by alignment of the sense RNA region (or complement of the antisense region) of the Arabidopsis thaliana derived sequence of IND used in the chimeric genes of the Examples and the corresponding region of the nucleotide sequences of the Brassica napus IND genes that there is not a single subregion of 21 consecutive nucleotides which are either identical or have only one mismatch between each of the Brassica napus sequences and the Arabidopsis thaliajia sequence (see Fig 2). The sequences share however several subsequences of 19 consecutive nucleotides with only one mismatch (i.e. having a sequence identity of about 94%). Although not intending to limit the invention to a particular mode of action, it is thought that the absence of nucleotide sequence "words" of 21 nucleotides shared between the dsRNA molecule and the endogenous gene may play an important role in the moderation of the gene silencing, as these 21-mers are generally expected to play an important role in the initiation and maintenance of dsRNA mediated post-transcriptional silencing.<br>
For oilseed rape plants, a moderate gene-silencing response can be conveniently achieved by using a chimeric gene encoding a dsRNA molecule, wherein the sense and antisense region comprise a nucleotide sequence having about 90% or 95% sequence identity, particularly are identical to a nucleotide sequence of at least 19 consecutive nucleotides from a gene involved in dehiscence zone and valve margin development of the silique from Arabidopsis thaliana. The nucleotide sequence may<br><br>
however be longer than 19 nucleotides and may be 50, 100, 200, 500 or even more nucleotides in length.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention, reduced seed shattering in oilseed rape can be achieved by using a chimeric gene encoding a dsRNA molecule wherein the sense and antisense regions correspond to the nucleotide sequence of the IND gene of Arabidopsis thaliana (SEQ ID No 1) from nucleotide +12 to +223 relative to the ATG startcodon of the Arabidopsis thaliana IND gene or its complement, i.e. from the nucleotide at position 27 to the nucleotide at position 237 in SEQ ID No 1.<br>
dsRNA encoding chimeric genes according to the invention may comprise a heterologous intron located in the spacer sequence between the sense and antisense RNA regions in accordance with the disclosure of WO 99/53050 (incorporated herein by reference).<br>

The above T-DNA vectors were introduced into Agrobacterium pGV4000 . This host strain is a rifampicin resistant derivative of C58, cured for pTiC58 (C58ClRifR) (Van Larebeke et al., 1974). The non-oncogenic acceptor Ti plasmid, pGV4000, is derived from the nopaline Ti plasmid pTiC58.The entire T-DNA region from pTiC58 has been substituted yielding pMP90 ( Koncz and Schell ,1986). Plasmid pGV4000<br><br>
has been derived from pMP90 by introducing a chloramphenicol resistance gene as described by Deblaere et al.9 1985.<br>
The resulting Agrobacterium strains were used to transform Arabidopsis plants according to the floral dipping method (Bechtold et al 1993., C.R. Acad Sci. Paris, Sciences de la vie/Life Sciences, 316, 1194-1199) or Brassica napus plants according to the hypocotyl explant inoculation method (essentially as described in De Block et al, 1989, Plant Physiol., 91: 64 or in WO 00/04173). All Brassica napus transformations were performed using a doubled haploid line derived from N90-740.<br>
Example 2: Analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines and Brassica napus lines comprising the chimeric genes of Example 1.<br>
A. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines.<br>
Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines were obtained by transformation using all of the T-DNA vectors of Example 1. The obtained lines were analyzed for podshatter resistance. Pods from untransformed wt Arabidopsis lines open spontaneously at maturity. In contrast, each of the population of transgenic lines, transformed using particular T-DNA vectors, contained transgenic lines, the plants of which developed pods which did not open spontaneously at maturity (indicated herein as podshatter resistant). The fraction of transgenic lines with podshatter resistance in the total population of lines transformed using a particular T-DNA vector varied between 23% and 98% (see Table 1). The physical forces needed to open closed mature pods of the podshatter resistant transgenic lines were determined in a semi-quantitive way by applying pressure between two fingers. Pods which completely open along the dehiscence zone at the slightest pressure were classified as "+", whereas pods which open only at the base of the dehiscence zone, and need harder pressure to open completely were classified as "++". Pods which can only be crushed (and do not open along the dehiscence zone) were classified as "+++".<br>
From the results summarized in Table 1, the following conclusions can be drawn.<br><br>
Using a dsRNA chimeric gene with a strong promoter and a sense/antisense region which is completely homologous to the endogenous IND gene of A. thaliana (pTC0219)<br>
a)	virtually all transgenic lines develop pods which remain closed at maturity<br>
b)	"virtually all pods of these transgenic lines require considerable force to be opened.<br>
Using a dsRNA chimeric gene with a relatively weak promoter and a sense/antisense region which is completely homologous to the endogenous IND gene of A. thaliana (pTKC89)<br>
a)	about 58% of transgenic lines develop pods which remain closed at maturity<br>
b)	about half of the pods of these transgenic lines require only slight to moderate physical forces to be opened.<br>
Using a dsRNA chimeric gene with a strong promoter and a sense/antisense region which has about 65% sequence identity to the endogenous IND gene of A, thaliana (pTC0212 and pTC0218)<br>
a)	only about one third of the transgenic lines develop pods which remain closed at maturity<br>
b)	most of the pods of these transgenic lines require only slight to moderate physical forces to be opened.<br>
Using a dsRNA chimeric gene with a strong promoter and a sense/antisense region which has about 100 % sequence identity to the endogenous SHPl gene of A. thaliana and about 71% or 88 % sequence identity to the endogenous SHP2 gene of A. thaliana (pTC0233 and pTC0234)<br>
a)	only about one fourth to half of the transgenic lines develop pods which remain closed at maturity<br>
b)	most of the pods of these transgenic lines require only slight (pTC0233) to moderate physical forces (pTC0234) to be opened.<br>
From these results it can be concluded that moderate gene silencing using either a -relatively weakr promoter, or a sense/antisense region.that exhibits lower than 88%<br><br>
and particularly around 65% sequence identity to a gene involved in dehiscence zone and valve margin development can be used to generate podshatter resistant Arabidopsis thaliana lines, all of the pods of which open along the dehiscence zone by application of only moderate physical forces.<br><br>
B. Transgenic Brassica napus lines.<br>
Transgenic Brassica napus lines were obtained by transformation using T-DNA vectors pTC0212, pTC0218 and pTC0219 of Example 1. Lines with single copy T-DNA insertions were selected. These lines were analyzed for podshatter resistance. Pods from untransformed wt B. napiis lines remain normally closed at maturity, but open upon application of relatively mildly forces. To determine podshatter resistance, a Random Impact Test (described above) was used to determine the half life of the pods (results summarized in Table 2 and Figure 3).<br>
Non-transgenic control lines have a pod half-life of about 10s in the RIT.<br>
Using a dsRNA chimeric gene with a strong promoter and a sense/antisense region which has about 90 to about 100 % sequence identity to the endogenous B. napus IND<br><br>
genes homologous to the IND gene of A. thaliana (pTC0212 and pTC0218), the pods never opened along the dehiscence zone and were pulverized after a long time in the drum. No meaningful half-life could be determined.<br>
Using a dsRNA chimeric gene with a strong promoter and a sense/antisense region which has about 65 % sequence identity to the endogenous B, napus IND genes homologous to Hie IND gene of A. thaliana (pTC0219) pod half lives of about 15 to about 40 seconds in RTT were determined.<br>
Table 2. Podshatter resistance in trangenic B. napus lines comprising the 35S-AT-Z7VD chimeric gene (determined by RTT).<br><br>
From these results it can be concluded that the methods according to the invention, as exemplified in Arabidopsis thaliana^ yield similar results in oilseed rape crop plants.<br><br><br><br>
