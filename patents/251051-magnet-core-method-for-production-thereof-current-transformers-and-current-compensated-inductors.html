				<td>THE APPLICANT HEREIN STATES THAT THE PRODUCT AS DISCLOSED AND<br>
CLAIMED HEREIN DOES NOT INCLUDE OR IS NOT USABLE IN RELATION TO<br>
ATOMIC ENERGY APPLICATION.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention concerns a magnet core with high modulability for alternating<br>
current and direct current components, a method for production of such a<br>
magnetic core and applications of such a magnet core especially in current<br>
transformers and current-compensated inductors, as well as alloys and bands for<br>
production of such a magnet core.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
High modulability for ac and dc components is required for numerous<br>
applications of magnet cores in which, depending on the case, specific<br>
modulability for ac and dc is necessary. Applications of magnet cores with high<br>
modulability for ac and dc components are present, for example, in current<br>
transformers and current-compensated inductors.<br>
Current-compensated noise suppression inductors are described in DE-A 35 26<br>
047 and DE 195 48 530 Al. They have two windings for one-phase application<br>
and three or more windings for multiphase applications. The windings of noise<br>
suppression inductors are connected so that the magnetic fluxes that are induced<br>
by the operating current rise mutually, whereas<br>
interference currents that flow with the same phase through the two windings<br>
result in magnetization of the soft magnetic core. Because of this the current-<br>
compensated noise suppression inductor produced acts as a very small inductive<br>
resistance with reference to the operating currents, whereas interference<br>
currents, which come from connected equipment, for example, and are closed<br>
via the ground, encounter very high inductance.<br>
The core of the known current-compensated noise suppression inductors is<br>
produced from amorphous or amount of crystalline alloys, preferably band<br>
material. The inductance of the inductor then depends essentially on the relative<br>
permeability of the soft magnetic material of the magnet core, in addition to the<br>
number of windings and the core cross section.<br>
Current transformers with the magnet cores mentioned in the introduction can be used in watt<br>
meters, as described for example in WO 00/30131. Watt meters are used, for example, to record<br>
power consumption of electrical equipment and installations in industry and the household. The<br>
oldest useful principle is the Ferraris meter. The Ferraris meter is based on power metering via<br>
the rotation of a disk connected to a mechanical meter, which is driven by the current- or voltage-<br>
proportional fields of corresponding field coils. For expansion of the functional capabilities of<br>
watt meters, like multiple rate operation or remote reading, electronic watt meters are used in<br>
which current and voltage recording occurs via current and voltage converters. The output signals<br>
of these converters are digitized, multiplied, integrated and stored; the result is an electrical<br>
quantity that is available for remote reading.<br>
One of the possible technical variants of such a current converter is the current transformer<br>
according to the induction principle. Figure 1 shows a substitution circuit where this type of<br>
current transformer and the ranges of the technical data can occur in different applications. A<br>
current transformer 1 is shown here. The primary winding 2, which carries the current Iprim to be<br>
measured and a secondary winding 3, which carries the secondary current Isec are situated on a<br>
magnet core constructed from a soft magnetic material. This current Isec is automatically adjusted<br>
so that the primary and secondary ampere turns in the ideal case are the same size and oppositely<br>
directed. The trend of the magnetic fields in such a current transformer shown in Figure 2, in<br>
which the losses in the magnet core are not considered because of their generally low value. The<br>
current in the secondary winding 3 is then set according to the law of induction so that it attempts<br>
to prevent the cause of its formation, namely the time change of the magnetic flux in magnet core<br>
4.<br>
In the ideal current transformer the secondary current, multiplied by the ratio of number of<br>
windings is therefore negatively equal to the primary current, which is explained by equation (1):<br><br>
This ideal case is never reached because of losses in the working resistance 5, in copper<br>
resistance 6 of the secondary winding and in the magnet core 4.<br>
In real current transformers the secondary current therefore has an amplitude error and a phase<br>
error relative to the above idealization, which is described by equation (2):<br><br>
The output signals of such a current transformer are digitized and further processed in the<br>
electronics of the watt meter.<br>
The electronic watt meters used for power metering in industrial applications operate indirectly<br>
because of the often very high (»100 A), i.e., special primary current transformers are connected<br>
in front of the current input so that only pure bipolar, zero-symmetric alternating currents<br>
(typically 1 ... 6 Aeff) need be measured in the counter itself. For this purpose current<br>
transformers are used constructed from magnet cores of highly-permeable materials, for example<br>
nickel-iron alloys containing about 80 wt% nickel and known under the name "Permalloy".<br>
These have in principle a very low phase error f to achieve low measurement errors, for which<br>
reason they are also equipped with very many (typically more than 1000) secondary windings.<br>
For use in household meters, which can also be used in small industrial installations, these are<br>
not suitable, since with the usual direct connection without primary current transformers<br>
connected in front to current intensities can generally be 100 A and more and because of this the<br>
above described current transformers will be saturated. In addition, these currents can contain<br>
non-zero-symmetric dc fractions that are generated by semiconductor circuits used in modern<br>
electrical equipment (for example, rectifier or phase control circuits) and which saturate current<br>
transformers with highly permeable magnet cores magnetically and therefore distort the power<br>
metering.<br>
The international standards that apply for this of the IEC 62053 stipulate that an electronic watt<br>
meter must be able to measure a maximum amplitude of a unipolar half-wave rectified sinusoidal<br>
current with a maximum additional error of 3 or 6% to comply with the accuracy classes 1 and<br>
2% for a stipulated maximum measurable effective value Imax of a bipolar zero-symmetric<br>
sinusoidal current, the numerical value of which is equal to the maximum effective value. In<br>
addition to these standards there are regional and national provisions that permit as sufficiently<br>
precisely defined behavior power recording even with a low amplitude limit value of the unipolar<br>
current.<br>
To form such current, current converters are known which operates on the basis of open magnetic<br>
circuits or low-permeability magnetic circuits sheared with mechanically introduced air gaps. An<br>
example of such a current converter is a current transformer in which a ferrite-shell core provided<br>
with an air gap (sheared) is used as magnet core. This has satisfactory linearity as a function of<br>
primary current, but because of the relatively low saturation induction of ferrite a comparatively<br>
large volume magnetic core is required in order to achieve a high maximum measurable primary<br>
current with high linearity over the entire current range in the current transformers. These current<br>
transformers also have high sensitivity to external foreign fields so that fielding measures must<br>
also be taken, which are material- and installation-intensive and therefore not very favorable in<br>
terms of cost. In addition, the magnetic values are generally strongly temperature dependent in<br>
ferrites.<br>
Current converters are also known that operate on the basis of iron-free air coils. This principle is<br>
known as the so-called Rogowski principle. The effect of the properties of a soft magnetic<br>
material on measurement accuracy drops out here. Owing to the magnetically open design of<br>
such current converters, they must be equipped with particularly demanding shields against<br>
external fields, which is also cost-intensive because of the material and installation expenditure.<br>
A technically high-value possibility for implementation is the use of current transformers with<br>
relatively low permeability (µ = 1400-3000) magnet cores from fast-solidified amorphous soft<br>
magnetic materials. The very good constancy of this permeability during changes in modulation<br>
guarantees very high linearity of the phase error over the entire current range to be transmitted.<br>
Because of the low permeability value saturation with the dc fractions is avoided within<br>
calculable limits; on the other hand, it leads to the occurrence of a comparatively high phase error<br>
between the primary and secondary current, which must be compensated in watt meters by a<br>
corresponding electronic circuit or software. In previously known variants of electronic watt<br>
meters a compensation range of typically 0.5-5° is present, in which compensation of higher<br>
values of this range, however, requires increasing demands with reference to signal processing<br>
semiconductor circuits and memories, which increases the equipment cost. A serious problem<br>
from the standpoint of manufacturers competing on the market for watt meters are the costs for<br>
the magnetic materials to be used, since the previously used alloys contain about 80 atom% Co,<br>
which leads to a comparatively high material price.<br>
It is the task of the invention to improve a magnet core that has modulability for ac and dc<br>
components in its application-related properties. Another task of the invention is to design the<br>
magnetic core with respect to its properties so that it is suitable for different applications, as well<br>
as applications for such a magnet core. Another task of the present invention is to provide a<br>
particular cost-effective magnet core. A final task of the invention is to provide a production<br>
method for such magnet cores.<br>
The task is solved by a magnet core with the features of the main Claim 1. The task is also solved<br>
by a current transformer having such magnet cores according to Claim 20 and an inductor having<br>
such magnet cores according to Claim 23. Finally the task is solved by a production method<br>
according to Claim 16. Embodiments and modifications of the idea of the invention are objects<br>
of the dependent claims.<br>
In comparison with the prior art a current transformer is significantly improved with a magnet<br>
core according to the invention in its properties (for example temperature trend, phase error,<br>
maximum primary current, maximum unipolar primary current as well as cost) relative to known<br>
current transformers (for example with ferrite cores). The magnet core can also be designed<br>
without an air gap enclosed. In addition to high modulability for ac and dc components, it has<br>
excellent suitable high linearity of current formation especially for current meter applications<br>
over a wide current range at high immunity to external foreign magnetic fields without initial<br>
shielding measures. It has therefore been demonstrated that the magnetic cores according to the<br>
invention are particularly suitable for current transformers and current-compensated inductors.<br>
However, they can also be advantageously used in any other applications.<br>
Because of a simple design of the current transformers and current-compensated inductors<br>
possible by the special properties of the magnet core according to the invention with low core<br>
masses from alloys that also contain no or only limited amounts of the expensive element Co, as<br>
well as with winding with relatively low number of turns, it can also be produced very cheaply<br>
and is therefore particularly suitable for the aforementioned applications. The temperature<br>
dependence of the mentioned properties is also as low as possible.<br>
In laying out a current transformer according to the invention for a stipulated maximum primary<br>
current it was therefore assumed that this current is proportional to the material-specific<br>
saturation induction, the core cross section and inversely proportional to the sum of the values for<br>
the working resistance and the resistance of the secondary winding. The core size (volume) is the<br>
product of core cross section and average magnetic path length. The core mass is obtained by<br>
multiplying by the material density. At the same time the maximum unipolar current amplitude is<br>
proportional to the material-specific saturation induction and to the average magnetic path length<br>
of the core and inversely proportional to the permeability of the material.<br>
A minimal phase error was then achieved, which roughly up to a value of the phase error of<br>
about =8° is proportional to the aforementioned resistance sum and inversely proportional to<br>
permeability. In addition, the greatest possible saturation induction was sought. The amorphous<br><br>
materials with about 80 atom% Co have values for saturation induction of 0.8-1 T. An increase<br>
would permit a reduction of the magnet core with the same maximum current or an increase in<br>
maximum current at the same core size.<br>
It is initially assumed that the core size (core volume) remains constant. The quantities also<br>
generally determined by the meter designer, like number of secondary windings as well as<br>
working resistance should not change either. The current transformer during an increase in<br>
saturation induction from 0.9 T to 1.2 T, as a nanocrystalline material with 10 atom% Ni has, for<br>
example, would therefore be able to form a 33% higher primary current. In addition, such a<br>
design with equivalent maximum unipolar current amplitude with increased saturation induction<br>
and equivalent core size would permit higher permeability, for example an increase from<br>
1500-3000 in an amorphous material with about 80 atom% Co to 2000-4000 for a<br>
nanocrystalline material with 10 atom% Ni. This again leads to a roughly 25% lower phase error,<br>
which significantly reduces the compensation expense in the watt meter. If the possibility for<br>
reducing the core cross section by 25% is then used for equivalent maximum primary current and<br>
the size ratios are correspondingly adjusted for the purpose of reducing the resistance of the<br>
secondary winding, it is possible to half the phase error of 5° to 2.5 with the same working<br>
resistance.<br>
The costs for the core material in this case during use of nanocrystalline material with 10 atom%<br>
Ni could be reduced to about 30% of the material costs and a core made of amorphous material<br>
with about 80 atom% Co.<br>
A preferred variant of a magnet core according to the invention suitable in particular for use in a<br>
current transformer proposes that the magnet core consist of a round band of ferromagnetic alloy<br>
in which at least 50% of the alloy is occupied by five crystalline particles with an average particle<br>
size of 100 nm or less, preferably 50 nm or less (nanocrystalline alloy), having permeability<br>
greater than the housing, preferably 1500 and less than 10,000, preferably 6000, which is set<br>
perpendicular to the direction of magnetization by tempering in a magnetic field. The saturation<br>
induction is then greater than or equal to 1 Tesla.<br>
Further preferred variants also have a saturation magnetostriction ?s 

alloys, whereas in nanocrystalline Fe-based alloys the permeability range in common alloys is<br>
greater than 10,000. The alloy for a magnet core according to the invention has a composition<br>
described essentially with the formula<br>
FeaCobNicCudMeSifBgXh<br>
in which M is at least one of the elements V, Nb, Ta, Ti, Mo, W, Zr, Cr, Mn and Hf, a, b, c, d, e,<br>
f, g are stated in atom%, X denotes the elements P, Ge, C as well as commercial dopants and in<br>
which a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h satisfy the following conditions:<br>

6.5 = f = 18;<br>
5= g = 14;<br>
h 
with 5 = b + c = 45, in which a + b + c + d + e + f = 100.<br>
Magnet cores with an alloy composition a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h that satisfy the following conditions<br>
are preferred;<br>

0.5=d=2;<br>
1=e=6;<br>
6.5=f=18;<br>
5=g=14;<br>
h = 5 atom%<br>
with 5 = b + c = 30, in which a+b+c+d+e+f= 100.<br>
Magnet cores with an alloy composition a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h that satisfy the following conditions<br>
are particularly preferred:<br>
0=b=10;<br>
2<c></c>
0.5=d=2;<br>
1=e=6;<br>
6.5=f=18;<br>
5=g=14;<br>
h 
with 5 = b + c = 20, in which a + b + c + d + e + f = 100.<br>
Excellent results are provided by magnet cores whose alloy compositions satisfy the following<br>
conditions:<br>
0.7 = d = 1.5;<br>
2 = e = 4;<br>
8 = f = 16;<br>
6 = g = 12;<br>
h 
with 5 = b + c = 20, in which a + b + c + d + e + f = 100. Preferably the variants have a Co<br>
content that is less than the Ni content.<br>
It has been shown that such a magnet core the dependence of permeability on magnetization is<br>
very small. The hysteresis loop of the magnet core is therefore very narrow and linear. This<br>
requires the smallest possible ratio of remanence induction to saturation induction of less than<br>
30% if possible, preferably 20% and low coercivity field intensities of less than 1 A/cm if<br>
possible, better 0.2 A/cm. This leads to high constancy of the permeability values. The<br>
nonlinearity of permeability ?µ/µ 
largest value for the difference between minimal and maximal value of the permeability over the<br>
entire measurable magnetization range up to about 5% below the saturation induction of<br>
1.2 Tesla and µ is the average permeability in this magnetization range.<br>
A current transformer with a magnet core according to the invention has, in addition to the<br>
magnet core, at least primary winding and one secondary winding, with which a working<br>
resistance is connected in parallel and which closes off the secondary circuit with low resistance.<br>
Since the permeability of the magnet core in the mentioned range is essentially independent of<br>
magnetization, the absolute phase error and absolute amplitude error of this current converter<br>
with such a magnetic core are then almost constant over a wide primary current range. The<br>
absolute amplitude error can be smaller than 1%. The absolute phase error can be less than 5°.<br>
Because of the good linearity the absolute values of the phase and amplitude errors can be easily<br>
compensated by the electronics or software of the watt meter equipped with it, which leads to<br>
high measurement accuracy for electrical power.<br>
Because of its narrow crystalline structure the magnet core has surprisingly high aging resistance<br>
which permits an upper application temperature limit for the magnet core above 120°C, special<br>
cases even around 150°C. Precisely because of this the current converter with a magnet core is<br>
suitable for use well above room temperature.<br>
Properties of the magnet core are weakly temperature dependent, in which this dependence again<br>
is largely linear. The temperature coefficient of permeability should then have an absolute value<br>
much less than 0.5%/K, preferably less than 0.2%/K.<br>
The invention is also based on the finding that with the alloy of the described composition by<br>
appropriate heat treatment a magnet core with the described properties can be produced. Very<br>
many parameters must be adjusted to each other so that the magnet core has the described<br>
properties.<br>
Because of the nanocrystalline two-phase structure generated during heat treatment with<br>
simultaneously high saturation induction and high thermal stability, the underlying prerequisites<br>
for good soft magnetic properties are met. The core is preferably produced from bands, which in<br>
turn are produced from the alloy according to the invention.<br>
The invention is further explained below by means of the practical examples depicted in the<br>
figures of the accompanying drawings. In the drawings.<br>

different technical data that can occur in an operation,<br>

Figure 1,<br>

function of primary current (in A) for a nominal primary current IprimN of 400 Å<br>
and<br>
Figure 5 shows the hysteresis loop for a preferred alloy according to the invention.<br>
The area of application "current transformers with dc tolerance for electric watt meters" is treated<br>
as an example below. It was found in the pertinent investigations that, in the long known<br>
conventional current transformers with high-permeability cores, satisfaction of the requirements<br>
of the standard series IEC 62053 for dc tolerance is not possible. These standards, which apply<br>
for the requirements of electronic household meters with direct connection, require that even in<br>
the presence of half-wave-rectified (i.e., purely unipolar) sinusoidal currents power recording<br>
must be possible.<br>
Conventional current transformers fail here because the high permeability cores are very quickly<br>
saturated by the unipolar flux that builds up. With diminishing permeability of the core material<br>
the time constant of the flux decline also drops with inductance so that the solution to the<br>
problem was sought in the use of more low-permeable amorphous alloys. However, a<br>
shortcoming here is the comparatively high price, which is mostly caused by the amorphous band<br>
of about 80%Co.<br>
The starting point for the considerations is therefore defined in alternative very low-permeable (µ<br>
preferably about 1500-6000) alloy variants suitable for replacing the amorphous low-<br>
permeability Co-based band with significant cost advantages.<br>
Clarification of the question whether the attainable linearity approaches that of the excellent<br>
Co-based bands in this respect so that the requirements on accuracy of power measurement can<br>
be met is also important here. It can be accepted with some certain that the higher saturation<br>
induction can be transferred to the corresponding application on the way to optimization. A<br>
requirement is perfect functionality according to IEC 62053, which previously had a significant<br>
technical advantage relative to the use of cheaper ferrite cores.<br>
Initially bands were investigated that are varied in Si content and Nb content. The experimental<br>
program included two cores each of each variant with two different temperatures in the<br>
transverse field heat treatment and three alloy compositions in the context of random<br>
experiments in alloy variation bands were cast from the experimental alloys with a width of<br>
6.2 mm and processed to annular band cores. These were treated to achieve the flattest possible<br>
hysteresis loop in the transverse field at different temperatures. Initially the achieved average<br>
permeabilities µav and other base parameters were determined (see Table 1).<br>

At the beginning of the study all cores were inserted stress-free in troughs without filler, which<br>
were then suitably wound for the linearity measurements, in which the values at 25°C were<br>
initially considered. The results are summarized in Table 2.<br>
Table 2: Alloys with V and Ni additives and unfixed linearity (voltage stress-free in the trough).<br>
For a better overview the linearity of the current trends is expressed by the dimensions ?µ/µav, in<br>
which the last two data points on reaching saturation were not included in the average value. The<br>
magnet cores mostly show a linearity that is suitable to ensure the required precision of power<br>
measurement over a wide current range during use of the cores for current transformers in<br>
electronic watt meters. An exception is variant 3B in which a relatively high value with 12.5%<br>
was achieved, which presumably was caused by overtempering in the transverse field.<br>
To determine the applications of the related fixation effect a core of each variant was either<br>
coated with an insulating plastic layer or inserted into an adapted plastic trough with soft elastic<br>
adhesive and wound/measured again. Significantly different pictures for linearity behavior of the<br>
cores were obtained, which is apparent from the two following Tables 3 and 4.<br>
Table 3: Linearity fixed close to production (plastic layer).<br><br>
Table 4: Linearity fixed close to production (plastic trough with self-elastic adhesive).<br>
Table 3 shows a very distinct effect of the plastic layer of linearity of the characteristic via the<br>
magnetostriction caused by the Ni addition the material reacts so strongly to the shrinkage stress<br>
of the layer solidifying at about 120°C and contracting during cooling that the resulting linearities<br>
no longer appear to be useful for use in a precision current transformer. The linearity deviations<br>
reach values that lie by a factor of 9 to more than 50 above the values of magnetostriction-free<br>
amorphous Co-based alloys used for comparison.<br>
A much more favorable behavior is caused by trough fixation. Here, during use of a soft elastic<br>
adhesive the nonlinearities only rise by a maximum of a factor of 2. In each case the variants 1B,<br>
2A, 2B and 3A appear to be useful at room temperature for use of high linear current<br>
transformers. For subsequent considerations concerning use over a broad (for example -40 to<br>
+70°C) temperature range, the temperature properties of the complex permeability were also<br>
considered. For example, the trends for the core 2A-2 show a negative temperature coefficient of<br>
permeability that is almost linear between -40 and +85°C and has a value of about -0.1 %/K for<br>
core 2B-2. The value applies both for amplitude of the existing field of 4 mA/cm and for<br>
15 mA/cm. It was found that a positive temperature coefficient for the current transformer is<br>
favorable to the extent that it behaves opposite the increasing resistance of the copper wire at<br>
increasing temperature and therefore reduces the phase error. During design of the current<br>
transformers, the resulting larger variation of errors with temperature must therefore be kept in<br>
mind. During use of the soft elastic adhesive it was found that a temperature change both at high<br>
and low temperatures leads to addition of linearity deviations of the converter errors. Tensile and<br>
compressive stresses occur here on the core, which are transferred because of the elastic behavior<br>
of the hardened adhesive from the trough material. A significant reduction of this effect could be<br>
achieved by using as filler a soft plastic nonreactive paste instead of a soft elastic reaction<br>
adhesive. Linearity values could therefore be kept almost constant within the temperature range<br>
from -40 to +85°C.<br>
A distinct advantage of the nanocrystalline material is the variability of permeability, which<br>
curing use of trough fixation must also be transported with satisfactory linearity into application.<br>
Because of the expanded useful modulation range a dc-tolerant current transformer can easily be<br>
tuned to an optimum of preloadability. To improve linearities, the magnetostriction can also be<br>
reduced if the percentage of added nickel is reduced by 10% in order to arrive at permeabilities of<br>
4000 or 6400.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show the trend of the amplitude error (in %) and the phase error (in °) as a<br>
function of primary current (in A) for different nominal primary currents IprimN of 640 A<br>
(Figure 3) and 400 A (Figure 4).<br>
Figure 5 finally shows the hysteresis loop (magnetic flux B in T over the field intensity H in<br>
A/cm) for an alloy with 65.2 atom% Fe, 12 atom% Ni, 0.8 atom% Cu, 2.5 atom% Nb,<br>
11.5 atom% Si and 8 atom % B. This alloy is compared with other alloys according to the<br>
invention in Table 5, in which QF stands for the transverse field treatment and LF for<br>
longitudinal field treatment. The alloys marked with an * are comparison alloys that do not<br>
belong to the invention.<br>
Heat treatment in the transverse field (transverse field treatment QF) is always necessary, in<br>
which the permeability can be arbitrarily adjusted with additional heat treatment in the<br>
longitudinal field (longitudinal field treatment LF) which can occur before or after transverse<br>
field treatment. This has the advantage that cores with different properties can be produced from<br>
the same alloy and therefore different classes of current transformers (current classes). The<br>
combination of temperature and duration of transverse field treatment should always have a<br>
stronger effect than temperature and duration of longitudinal field treatment.<br>
Table 5.<br><br>
The values listed in the above Table 5 mean:<br>
1. QF = heat treatment in magnetic transverse field, LF = heat treatment in magnetic<br>
transverse field.<br>
2. Bm was measured at a maximum field intensity of Hm = 8 A/cm for examples 1 to 21<br>
and Hm = 32 A/cm for examples 22 to 24.<br>
3. µ denotes the average permeability, defines the average slope of the hysteresis curve.<br>
4. No. 1 and No. 6 are comparative examples NOT according to the invention.<br>
The numbering of the alloys from Table 5 differs from that in Tables 1-4. The permeability<br>
values between Table 5 and the other tables can therefore easily differ, since different<br>
experimental series are involved.<br>
With the magnet cores according to the invention current transformers can be produced in which<br>
the maximum undistorted amplitude of a half-wave electrified sinusoidal primary current has a<br>
numerical value at least 10%, better 20% of the effective value of the maximum undistorted<br>
bipolar sinusoidal primary current.<br>
