TITLE OF INVENTION	SANJEEVANI STRETCHER  (S.S) for Rescue<br>
INNOVATION BY	:	Mr. Ladkat Rajendra Vithal<br>
396,Kasba Peth, Pune-411011<br>
Maharashtrajndia.<br>
SANJEEVANI STRETCHER (S.S.) Useful in any type of emergency for rescue operation in<br>
water or on ground before victims get proper medication or hospitalization.<br>
It is a very unique concept   for carrying victims or patients as well as for general use.   Non<br>
woven fabric material of spun bond (150 gsm )or any suitable cloth is used for the Sanjeevani<br>
stretcher .    This stretcher is designed for multipurpose use, mainly   to carry the patient and<br>
protect him from infection . As this material is porous,   it also allows for respiration while<br>
keeping patient inside.<br>
Sanjeevani stretcher is one of the best carriers for patient. It is made up of 6 parts as shown in<br>
fig 1 &amp; 2.<br>
Part No 1) - Stretcher -6 feet 6 inches in length and 3 feet in width made of. non woven fabric material (spun bond) (150 gsm) for top and bottom.<br>
Part No 2 ) -Handle - 6 inches in length and 1.5 inches in width ( broad). It is made of . non woven fabric material, ( spun bond) in two layers and 2 cotton strips in two layers are stitched inside the handle to increase its strength .Total eight handles are stitched on the bottom side of the stretcher for lifting the patient so that the weight of the patient is distributed equally all over and one can carry a patient easily with the help of 2 or 4 persons, depending on the weight of the patient .as shown in fig 3 .<br>
Part No 3 ) -ZIP - 9 feet 6 inches long , 8 No. size , double opening /closing system ( 2 runners for chain movement and locking system).<br>
Part No 4 ) -ZIP - 1 foot long , 5 No .size , attached on top side of the stretcher to enable viewing and recognizing the patient ( or dead body) kept inside the stretcher . It is also useful for providing additional ventilation while using it as a sleeping bag .<br>
Part No 5 ) -Sheet of Hitlon (Polyurethane Foam), 25 mm in thickness , 2 feet 3 inches in width and 6 feet 3 inches in length for making the stretcher float. .Hitlon Foam gives plane surface to the stretcher so that the patient gets relaxation to his back or injured spine get proper support. Also it may be used as a mattress when used as a sleep-in-bag .<br>
Part No 6 ) - Strips (4 NOs) - 7 inches in width and 3 feet in length , made of non woven fabric material ( spun bond) and cotton cloth strips stitched at a distance of 3 inches from both ends of the bottom part of the stretcher to bear the weight of the patient , giving extra support to handle and also to insert the Hitlon foam inside the strips so that the Foam may not move from inside.<br>
(2)<br><br>
SANJEEVANI STRETCHER (S.S)<br>
A)	A Compact Stretcher (Useful in rescue from narrow space)   for carrying any<br>
patient or person from any narrow space. If any accident or any mishap occurs on ground floor,<br>
or on road, the rescue is easy ; but if it is in any apartment in highrise building , it is difficult to<br>
help the patient.<br>
In congested city areas, with narrow lanes, and hindrances caused by various obstructions problems are created in carrying patient to hospital. And if he is staying on higher floor and if there is no lift or lift is not working, it is very dangerous to carry such a patient, who is not in a position to walk or move. Also most of the traditional Stretchers are rigid they can not bend while the patient is being carried through the staircase and if the passage is very narrow, it is more difficult to maintain the balance and time consuming, too. In such a case S.S is really a SANJEEVANI (ultimate remedy) for patients. . .It is very flexible and durable it can not be torn easily.<br>
B)	A Floating Stretcher- Many times we find that in rainy season water gets collected (water<br>
logged) in the buildings which are situated near the riverside and it becomes risky to go<br>
through the water with patients . With the help of SS we can easily rescue the patient in this<br>
situation..<br>
C )For injured patient-<br>
A Proper support for injured patient of an accident<br>
Many times , in an accident, the victim is injured badly -some times he gets fractures or deep wounds which may start bleeding profusely.. At such times it is hard to carry the patient carefully . And here   S.S comes to help him .<br>
As SANJEEVANI Stretcher is designed specially for the comfort of the patient, it really gives him relief ,while he is being carried to the hospital, because of the Hitlon sheet and keeping him inside , safely covered to avoid infection , movements and horrible sights for rescuers,<br>
As the patient is getting support from all four sides . Many time due to pain he tries to move , and movement of his body may be the cause of any critical injury ,. If he gives movement to his body may be some of the injured bones or neck may be dislocated. And in this situation patient can get better support of Stretcher . When we carry a patient on the open Stretcher ( Regular Iron or Canvas ) there is not any support, and patient moves on it , but in S.S he is having support from all side so he may not move more, and even to carry such a patient is also easy to the assistants.<br>
D)       For carrying burn patient<br>
SS is design to use every where as a multipurpose Stretcher in all type of accidents. Carrying properly to burn patient is always a difficult task.  A burn patient is trying to move all the time<br>
(3)<br><br>
because of burning pain and it is difficult to control on him, he has got burns the skin is open and some time bleeding , he should be carry properly without any chances of an infection . SS helps to carry such patient, because the cloth used in SS is very smooth so even if touch of SS to skin doesn't give any damages or loses to wounds and it restrict on movement of patient.. Also to see the wounds of such patient is horrible and people never come up to help them . SS has a system to keep patient covered inside , and that is why patient is not open as his wounds and burned body parts are also covered hence people doesn't mind to carry such patient . Also patient is covered in SS ,with ZIP he get protection from infection, dust or any other foreign organ. Many time people use to carry such patient in bed sheet or whatever cloth available on time some time it may stick to wait wound of the patient and it may possible that wounds get loss or any other problem And this time SS is helpful for such a patient to carry him till the hospital.<br>
E)        A perfect Protection in traveling or in picnic:<br>
Most of us are use to go for picnic or trekking or traveling for any reason.<br>
SANJEEVANI Stretcher is not only Stretcher but it is a portable slipping Bag also .   In the<br>
traveling it may not possible that every time we may get any proper bed to sleep .<br>
As well as also we may not get blanket or bed sheet for covering . Here S.S     can be use as a<br>
slipping bag .We can sleep on the inner part and Zip the upper part so it will gives us pleasure of<br>
slipping in    slipping bag. In jungles small creatures are more dangerous than animals. Like<br>
snake. Scorpio, Blood Sucker creatures , Poisonous Lizards, and other, but when some in if using<br>
S.S As slipping bag there is no chance of danger from such creatures because they can not enter<br>
inside of the bag , and we can get protected. Many times these small creatures are become major<br>
cause of death also. And we avoid it.<br>
F)        Death by Drowning:<br>
We often find dead bodies floating on the surface after being drowned in wells ,canals, rivers, seashore . Those bodies look horrible dreadful because of swelling of lips eyes, and some time fingers of hands and legs ,other part of body eaten by fish or other aqua creatures These bodies starts decomposed immediately after being removed from water. The decayed bodies starts giving out rebelling odder . This causes people suffocation &amp; avoid help to carry the dead body to hospital. Also some time we found such bodies are laying open on the ground for long times , in such case we can put these bodies inside the SS so that any person can be ready to help . There is no precaution to cover and carry those dead bodies with rescue workers of fire brigade or Police etc. They use try to pull these dead bodies by naked hands and some time unfortunately any part of body might be harmed , And to touch such bodies is also very tough even to think. And at such places S.S comes really handy to use. Even it is more safer to carry such bodies for postmortem without any loss to dead body .<br><br>
(4) <br>
G)       Mortuary /Postmortem room:<br>
These days we find many of dead bodies just laying around open in Mortuary and in Postmortem room. Here if put in S.S can easily be protected and transferred. Because the Zip facility one can identity the dead person just by opening the zip on the front part.<br>
This will reduce the hesitation to enter the mortuary from common man's mind and there is ventilation to the body in S.S bag because its being pours airflow.<br>
H)       Affordable Cost<br>
SS bag has many benefits - manufacturing cost is very low .therefore they can be kept in every home, Police Station .Municipal wards office, Gardens , Swimming Pools , Theatre, Main square, societies, Hotels , Tourist spot , Bus Stands, Railway Stations, Temples, and can be easily useful in any emergency situation. Being easily washable it can be also re used for any another unfortunate event.<br>
I)        Use as a sleep-in-bag in any emergency :<br>
Every one may have experience of picnic or outing and we find some time we may not get proper facilities of sleeping there like bed, mattress or any other for sleeping comfortably. Here this stretcher can be use as a sleep-in-bag. As it is having full zip Which easily open so one can open the bag and get sleep inside and then close zip from inside . As it is closed from inside we may get proper protection from insects, and other animals also. There is also another Zip on top, for more comfortable breathing one can keep it open .<br>
J)        Use for carrying Dead bodies<br>
K)       Use for keeping Dead bodies in Mortuary:<br>
L)       Use as a Floating bed while enjoying swimming:<br>
The SS is having main facility of floating . The Hitlon sheet keep inside stretcher for floating in water. One can sleep on the floating stretcher and use it as a water bed on surface of water. As it can be very easily float, even a person who doesn't know swimming he can also enjoy it.<br>
M)      Use as a Floating Stretcher bed in rescue in water.<br>
The SS is having main facility of floating . The foam sheet raped inside stretcher which supports to stretcher for floating in water. We can use it in rescue operation in water. As it is having 8 handles it is very easy to carry any person through water. Simply keep a drowning person on the floating stretcher. Now a person getting float on the water.<br>
N)       May use as life-saver floating bed in marine life   .<br>
The SS is having main facility of floating . The foam sheet raped inside stretcher supports to stretcher for floating in water.<br>
(5)<br><br>
O)       It is easily washable and fast drying.<br>
The material of Spin Bond is washable so it can be reuse all the time after each use it can get dry within short time. There is no need to wait for draying up the stretcher . Very easily it get dried and ready for next use. So clots of blood or any another spot can be wash and get cleaned.<br>
P)       Work as Vibration Pad<br>
Apart from any accident or any rescue oration we can use foam as a  Vibration proof made. We can notice that while we are transporting any delicate goods like glass, Television, Washing Machines , Computer, Cupboard , of glass materials, Crockery's , etc . it may get damage while it is to be carrying in any truck or any vehicle because of transporting by the road. In such case Foam sheet gives support and protection to the glass or our valuable goods.<br>
