				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
The present invention concerns a new olefin polymerisation<br>
process for preventing fouling in the polymerisation reactor.<br>
The invention particularly concerns olefin polymerisation<br>
processes using chromium-oxide-type (so-called Phillips type)<br>
or a Ziegler Natta-type catalyst.<br>
Olefin polymerisation processes are well known. Among the<br>
processes, slurry polymerisation in suspension in a solvent or<br>
in the liquid monomer is extensively pr acticed. Such<br>
processes are performed in a stirred tank reactor, or in<br>
closed loop reactors. One or more reactors can be used. In<br>
such processes, solid polymer particles are grown on small<br>
catalyst particles. Released heat of polymerisation is<br>
eliminated through cooling through the reactor's walls and/or<br>
a_heat exchanger.<br>
However, it has been found on an industrial scale that while<br>
the polymer particles are insoluble or substantially insoluble<br>
in the diluent, the polymer product has some tendency to<br>
deposit on the walls of the polymerisation reactor. This so -<br>
called "fouling" leads to a decrease in the efficiency of heat<br>
exchange between the reactor bulk and the coolant around the<br>
reactor. This leads in some cases to loss of reactor control<br>
due to overheating, or to reactor or downstream polymer<br>
processing equipment failure due to formation of agglomerates<br>
(ropes, chunks).<br>
This "fouling" is caused in part by fines and also by the<br>
build up of electrostatic charge on the walls on the reactor.<br><br>
Attempts to avoid fouling during slurry polymerisation have<br>
been made by adding an antifouling agent in the polymerisation<br>
medium. Typically, the antifouling agent acts for example to<br>
make the medium more conductive, thus preventing to some<br>
extent the formation of electrostatic charge, which is one<br>
cause of the build-up of polymer on the wall of the reactor.<br>
US 3,995,097 discloses a process whereby an olefin is<br>
polymerised in a hydrocarbon diluent using a catalyst<br>
comprising chromium oxide associated with at least one of<br>
silica, alumina, zirconia, or thoria. Fouling of the reactor<br>
is said to be reduced by adding a composition, which comprises<br>
a mixture of aluminium or chromium salts of an alkyl salicylic<br>
acid and an alkaline metal alkyl sulphur succinate.<br>
EP 0,005,215 is concerned with a process for polymerising<br>
olefins in a hydrocarbon diluent again using a catalyst<br>
comprising calcined chromium compound associated with at least<br>
one of silica, alumina, zirconia or thoria or using a catalyst<br>
system such as those disclosed in US 2,908,671, 3,919,185 and<br>
3,888,835. The process uses an anti -fouling agent comprising<br>
a compound containing a sulphonic acid residue. The anti -<br>
fouling agent is a composition comprising (a) a polysulphone<br>
copolymer (b) a polymeric polyamine, and (c) an oil soluble<br>
sulphonic acid. In the Example, the additive product known as<br>
Stadis 450 is used as the anti fouling agent.<br>
US 6,022,935 (equivalent to EP 0,803,514) discloses a process<br>
for the preparation of polymers of C 2-C12 alk -1-ene using a<br>
catalyst system containing a metallocene complex. An<br>
antistatic agent is used in the process. It is said that in<br>
general, all antistatic agents which are suitable for<br><br>
polymerisations may be used. Examples given are salt mixtures<br>
comprising calcium salt s of medialanic acid and chromium salts<br>
of N-stearylanthranilic acid, C12-C22 fatty acid soaps of<br>
sulfonic esters of the general formula (RR') -CHOSO3Me, esters<br>
of polyethylene glycols with fatty acids, and polyoxyethylene<br>
alkyl ethers.<br>
EP 0,820,474 is concerned with preventing sheeting problems in<br>
gas phase reactors in polymerisation processes, which comprise<br>
at least one loop reactor followed by at least one gas phase<br>
reactor. These problems are addressed using a fouling<br>
preventive agent that is a mixture of Cr salt of C14-C18 alkyl-<br>
salicylic acid, a Ca dialkyl sulphosuccinate and a copolymer<br>
of alkylmethacrylate with 2-methyl-5-vinylpyridine in solution<br>
in xylene. Chromium-type catalysts, Ziegler-type catalysts and<br>
metallocene catalysts are mentioned.<br>
JP 2000-327,707 discloses a slurry olefin polymerisation<br>
method. The method addresses the problems of fouling and<br>
sheeting of the reactor wall,which is observed particularly<br>
with supported metallocene catalysts. The method is said to be<br>
carried out in the p resence of one compound chosen from<br>
polyalkylene oxide alkyl ether, alkyl diethanolamine,<br>
polyoxyalkylene alkyl amine, and polyalkylene oxide block.<br>
EP 1 316 566 discloses propylene polymerisation in a bulk loop<br>
reactor. The disclosure is concerned specif ically with the<br>
transition from one catalyst type to another in a bulk loop<br>
reactor and with the problems associated therewith. The<br>
process involves injecting a metallocene catalyst and a<br>
Ziegler-Natta catalyst system into the bulk loop reactor.<br>
There is no disclosure in EP 1316566 of the catalyst being a<br><br><br>
chromium-oxide type catalyst. It is mentioned on page 3<br>
paragraph [0009] that in one embodiment, a volume of<br>
antifouling agent may be introduced into a catalyst mixing<br>
system. Three possible antifouling agents are mentioned. The<br>
discussion on pages 10 and 11 clearly teach that an<br>
antifouling agent is used for the metallocene catalyst systems<br>
and not for conventional Ziegler -Natta catalyst systems.<br>
Further, the metallocene catalyst and Ziegler -Natta catalyst<br>
are injected into the loop reactor sequentially in EP 1 316<br>
566 and not simultaneously so that they are not both present<br>
in the reactor at the same time and so that any antifouling<br>
agent present in the metallocene catalyst system will not<br>
contact the Ziegler-Natta catalyst system.<br>
In view of the above, it will be seen that many so called<br>
anti-fouling agents for use in various olefin polymerisation<br>
processes are known. However, there have been some problems<br>
associated with prior known agents, partic ularly in relation<br>
to polymerisation processes using chromium -type catalysts and<br>
sometimes Ziegler-Natta type catalysts. These problems<br>
include an increase of catalyst consumption due to loss of<br>
activity in the presence of the anti -fouling agent. This can<br>
be observed even at the low levels typically used in the<br>
polymerisation process. Catalyst activity loss is linked to<br>
the poisoning of active sites, for example by the polar<br>
moieties of the anti-fouling agent (alcohol and sulphonate „,) .<br>
Other problems with prior known agents relate to problems of<br>
toxicity. This is a particular concern with Cr -based anti-<br>
fouling agent or with agents such as commercial Stadis 450 as<br>
described in EP 0,005,215, because of the solvent type<br>
(toluene)and/or because of the active ingredient.<br><br><br>
Finally, practical problems are encountered with many<br>
previously known anti-fouling agents. These practical<br>
problems arise because some antifouling agents are usable only<br>
with a given catalyst type. This makes transitions between<br>
catalyst systems during processing_more difficult.<br>
Thus, there remains a need to provide new anti -fouling agents<br>
for use in olefin polymerisation processes using chromium -<br>
type catalysts, late Transition Metal-type catalysts, or<br>
Ziegler-Natta type catalysts without the drawbacks of current<br>
products.<br>
This problem has been solved at least partially by the<br>
provision of an olefin polymerisation process carried out in<br>
the presence of an anti -fouling agent and a chromium -type<br>
catalyst, a late Transition Metal type catalys t, or Ziegler<br>
Natta catalyst; characterised in that the anti -fouling agent<br>
comprises an anti-fouling polymer having an average molecular<br>
weight (Mw) of greater than 1000 daltons and containing:<br>
(1)	one or more - (CH2-CH2-O) k- where each k is in the range<br>
from 1 to 50; and<br>
(2)	one or more -(CH2-CH (R) -O) n- where R comprises an alkyl<br>
group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and each n is in<br>
the range from 1 to 50,<br>
and terminated by a R' and a R" end groups, wherein R' is OH<br>
or an alkoxy having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms an d R" is H or an<br>
alkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
In the present process, (CH2CH(R)O)n blocks generally may be<br>
considered to be lipophilic whereas (CH 2CH2O)k blocks may be<br>
considered to be hydrophilic. Preferably, one end of the<br><br><br>
polymer is hydrophilic and the other end or the middle of the<br>
polymer is lipophilic.<br>
Such an anti-fouling agent is known per se, particularly<br>
outside the field of olefin polymerisation. In this regard,<br>
such an agent is known as a washing detergent.<br>
However, it has been surpr isingly found by the present<br>
inventors that such an agent may be used advantageously in an<br>
olefin polymerisation method which uses a chromium -type<br>
catalyst, a late Transition Metal-type catalyst, or Ziegler -<br>
Natta type catalyst. In particular it has been un expectedly<br>
found that improved activity of the catalyst occurs when this<br>
anti-fouling agent is used in a process, which uses a<br>
chromium-type catalyst, as compared with using other known<br>
anti fouling agents such as Stadis 450. In fact, up to twice<br>
the activity has been observed. This is especially unexpected<br>
because catalyst poisoning in presence of an anti -fouling<br>
agent is a particular problem with chromium -type catalysts<br>
because no scavenger such as a metal alkyl is used.<br>
Furthermore, it has been found that no loss of activity occurs<br>
when this anti-fouling agent is used in a process, which uses<br>
a late Transition Metal -type catalyst or a Ziegler -Natta type<br>
catalyst. This is particularly advantageous since, for<br>
logistical reasons, it is preferable to be a ble to use a<br>
single anti-fouling agent in olefin polymerisation processes<br>
regardless of the type of catalyst (i.e. chromium -type, late<br>
Transition Metal-type, Ziegler-Natta type or metallocene. This<br>
is however not possible with most previously known anti -<br>
fouling agents, without loss of activity with one of the<br>
catalyst types.<br><br><br>
Also, importantly, the rheology and mechanical properties of<br>
the resin product are not substantially modified when the<br>
present anti-fouling agent is used.<br>
The present anti-fouling agent has the further advantage in<br>
that it is safer to humans than Cr -compounds or agents using<br>
an aromatic diluent, for example. This is in part because the<br>
present anti-fouling agent does not necessarily require a<br>
solvent, thereby avoiding the presence o f for example toluene.<br>
Preferably, the anti-fouling polymer is a block polymer, more<br>
preferably a triblock polymer.<br>
Preferably, the antifouling polymer is a block polymer of<br>
general formula;<br>
R' - (CH2-CH2-O) k- (CH2-CH (R) -O) „ - (CH2-CH2-O) m-R' (I)<br>
or R' - (CH2-CH (R) -O) a- (CH2-CH2-O) b- (CH2-CH (R) -O) c-R' (II)<br>
where R comprises an alkyl group; R' and R' are end groups; k<br>
is from 1 to 50; n is from 1 to 50; m is greater than or equal<br>
to 1; a is from 1 to 50; b is from 1 to 50; and c is from 0 to<br>
50; k and m and a and c may be the same or different.<br>
Preferably R is a C1 to C3 alkyl group. More preferably, R is<br>
a methyl group.<br>
Preferably, in one embodiment, k is greater than 1 and m is<br>
greater than 1. Also preferably, in another embodiment a is 0<br>
or c is 0.<br><br><br>
Preferred R' and R' groups include H; OH; alkyl, and alkoxy<br>
groups. Preferred alkyl groups are C1 to C3 alkyl groups.<br>
Preferred alkoxy groups are C1 to C3 alkoxy groups. In this<br>
regard, as mentioned above, the ends of the polymer should be<br>
hydrophilic. Therefore, in formulae (I) and (II) above, it is<br>
preferred that R' is OH or an alkoxy group, preferably OH or a<br>
C1 to C3 alkoxy group. Further, it is preferred that R' is H<br>
or an alkyl group, preferably H or a C1 to C3 alkyl group.<br>
A particularly preferred polymer has general formula (III):<br>
R'-(CH2-CH2-O)k-(CH2-CH(CH3)-O)n - (CH2-CH2-O) m-R" (III)<br>
where R', R', k, n, and m independently are as defined<br>
anywhere above.<br>
A further preferred polymer has general formula (IV):<br>
OH- (CH2-CH2-O)k- (CH2-CH (R) -O)n - (CH2-CH2-O)m-H (IV)<br>
where R, k, n, and m independently are as defined anywhere<br>
above.<br>
It will be appreciated that, by virtue of the preferred<br>
molecular weights for the present anti -fouling polymer and the<br>
preferred ethylene oxide contents in the pre sent anti-fouling<br>
polymer given above, preferred values for a, b, c, k, n, and m<br>
can be derived.<br>
It will be understood in the present process that, where<br>
necessary, an activating agent will be needed to activate the<br><br><br>
catalyst (e.g; Ziegler-Natta catalyst) or to modify the<br>
product polymer properties. Suitable activating agents, where<br>
needed, are well known in this art. Suitable activating agents<br>
include organometallic or hydride compounds of Group I to III,<br>
for example those of general formula AlR3 such as Et3Al,<br>
Et2AlCl, and (i-Bu)3Al. One preferred activating agent is<br>
triisobutylaluminium.<br>
When the polymerisation process is a slurry polymerisation<br>
process, it is carried out in suspension in a liquid diluent.<br>
The diluent can be the liquid monomer or comono mer per se<br>
(e.g. propylene, hexene), or an inert liquid such as an<br>
alkane. Preferred alkane diluents include isobutane, propane,<br>
butane, pentane, hexane, isohexane, cyclohexane, and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
The anti-fouling agent may be added at any suitable st age in<br>
the process. The addition can be carried out continuously or<br>
batch wise. The anti-fouling agent may be added to the<br>
polymerisation medium separately or may be mixed with the<br>
monomer or with the comonomer and then added to the<br>
polymerisation medium. Advantageously, the anti -fouling agent<br>
may be added via the monomer header in order to introduce the<br>
agent evenly in the reactor.<br>
The anti-fouling agent desirably is liquid at room temperature<br>
and, as such, the anti-fouling polymer is liquid at room<br>
temperature. There are two principle factors which determine<br>
whether the anti-fouling polymer is liquid at room<br>
temperature. These are: the molecular weight of the anti -<br>
fouling polymer and the wt% ethylene oxide in the anti -fouling<br>
polymer.<br><br><br>
Preferably, the wt% ethylene oxide in the anti-fouling<br>
polymer is in the range of from 5 to 40 wt%, more preferably<br>
from 8 to 30 wt%, even more preferably from 10 to 20 wt%, most<br>
preferably about 10 wt%.<br>
Further, the anti-fouling polymer preferably has a molecular<br>
weight (MW), not higher than 5000. In order to avoid any<br>
poisoning effect on the catalyst and to minimise elution of<br>
residues from the formed polymer product, the molecular weight<br>
is greater than 1000 Daltons, preferably greater than 2000<br>
Daltons, more preferably in the range from 2000-4500 Daltons.<br>
It will be understood from the above that in order to ensure<br>
that the anti-fouling agent is liquid at room temperature, one<br>
must balance the molecular weight of the anti -fouling polymer<br>
and the wt% ethylene oxide in the anti-fouling polymer. It is<br>
to be noted that the activity of the anti -fouling polymer<br>
decreases as the molecular weight increases. Therefore, in<br>
practice, it may be desirable to increase the wt% ethylene<br>
oxide in the anti-fouling polymer in order to ensure that the<br>
anti-fouling agent is liquid at room temperature, rather than<br>
increase the molecular weight of the anti -fouling polymer.<br>
It will be appreciated from the above that the molecular<br>
weight of the anti-fouling polymer should be selected in<br>
combination with the wt% ethylene oxide content in the anti -<br>
fouling polymer. For guidance value, the present inventors<br>
have found that an anti-fouling polymer having an ethylene<br>
oxide content of 10 wt% and a molecular weight in the range of<br>
from 4000 to 4500 is particularly useful in the present<br>
process.<br><br><br>
Generally, the anti-fouling polymer is used at the lowest<br>
possible concentration effective to prevent or substantially<br>
reduce fouling. This can be determined by routine<br>
experimentation. Preferably it is use d at a concentration of<br>
from 0.5 to 20 ppmw in the polymerisation medium, more<br>
preferably from 2 to 10 ppmw.<br>
Preferably the present process may be used to make<br>
homopolymers of ethylene or copolymers or higher order<br>
polymers of ethylene and one or more com onomers. The copolymer<br>
or higher order polymer may be in a random, alternating, or<br>
block configuration. Preferred comonomers are alpha olefins<br>
including, for example, propylene, 1 -butene, 1-hexene, 4-<br>
methyl 1-pentene, 1-octene. The process can further be used<br>
to make homopolymers or copolymers of other alpha olefins, for<br>
example propylene, butene and the like. It has been found that<br>
the present process is particularly effective when making high<br>
density polyethylene, although the process is not so limited.<br>
Where the copolymer or higher order polymer is in a block<br>
configuration, one way of making the polymer is to make the<br>
homopolymer "blocks" and, subsequently, to introduce these<br>
pre-made "blocks" into the polymerisation medium with a<br>
comonomer. Alternatively, the "block" polymer can be made in<br>
a polymerisation medium containing the propylene monomer with<br>
a small quantity of the comonomer.<br>
A preferred reaction temperature range may be said to be from<br>
40°C to 130°C, preferably from 50 to 120°C, more preferably<br>
from 70 to 110°C for ethylene polymers.<br><br><br>
A preferred applied pressure range may be said to be from 5 to<br>
200 bars, more preferably from 30 to 70 barg, depending on the<br>
reactor configuration and on the diluent.<br>
Generally, chromium-type catalysts usable in the present<br>
process comprise a chromium-oxide type catalyst, preferably<br>
chromium oxide associated with at least one of silica,<br>
alumina, titania, aluminophosphate or thoria. Such catalysts<br>
are well known in the art . Preferred chromium-oxide-type<br>
catalysts include Cr on silica, Cr on silica doped with<br>
titania, alumina, aluminophosphate, fluorine or mixtures<br>
thereof, and Cr on aluminophosphate.<br>
Late transition metal catalysts usable in the present process<br>
include nickel complexes and iron complexes such as disclosed<br>
for example in Ittel et al. (S.T. Ittel, L.K. Johnson and M.<br>
Brookhart, in Chem. Rev., 2000,1169.) and in Gibson and<br>
Spitzmesser (V.C. Gibson and S.K. Spitzmesser, in Chem. Rev.,<br>
2003,283.). Catalysts of this type will be well known to a<br>
person skilled in this art.<br>
Generally, Ziegler-Natta type catalysts usable in the present<br>
process comprise a transition metal compound of Group IV -VIII<br>
(mainly Ti, Zr or V) supported on a carrier. Such catalysts<br>
are well known in the art. Examples of Ziegler -Natta catalysts<br>
are TiCl4, TiCl3, VCl4, VOCl3. Titanium chloride supported on a<br>
MgCl2 support or a MgCl2/silica support are preferred.<br>
One bulk reactor type which may be applied in slurry<br>
polymerisation processes is a turbulent flow reactor such as a<br>
continuous pipe reactor in the form of a loop. A continuous<br>
pipe reactor in the form of a loop is operated in liquid full<br><br>
mode, using liquid monomer or a diluent as the liquid medium.<br>
Such a so-called loop reactor is well known and is described<br>
in the Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3 rd edition, vol.16<br>
page 390. This can produce LLDPE and HDPE resins in the same<br>
type of equipment.<br>
A loop reactor may be connected to one or more further<br>
reactors, such as another loop reactor. A loop reactor that is<br>
connected to another loop reactor may be referred to as a<br>
"double loop" reactor.<br>
Other types of bulk reactors such as stirred tank reactors may<br>
be used instead of a loop reactor, again using the bulk<br>
monomer or a diluent as the liquid medium. A stirred tank<br>
reactor also may be used in combination with a loop reactor,<br>
where a first reactor that is a loop reactor is connected to a<br>
second reactor that is a stirred tank reactor.<br>
In some cases it may be advantageous for a gas phase reactor<br>
also to be incorporated. The gas phase reactor may be a<br>
second reactor that is connected to a first reactor such as a<br>
loop reactor or a stirred tank reactor. Alternatively, a gas<br>
phase reactor may be connected as a third reactor in the<br>
apparatus. In the gas phase reactor (if present), the<br>
elastomeric part of a copolymer or higher order polymer<br>
product may be produced. The elastomeric part of the polymer<br>
product gives impact properties to the product. The<br>
elastomeric part of the polymer product typically is comonomer<br>
rich.<br><br><br>
The bulk reactor (s) may be connected to a gas phase reactor,<br>
for example where it is desirable to prepare a "block"<br>
polymer.<br>
The present invention now will be described in further detail<br>
with reference to the attached drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows the re suits of rheological dynamic analysis<br>
(RDA), Gc expressed in Pa.s as a function of Wc expressed in<br>
rad/s performed on resins A and D.<br>
Figure 2 shows the results of RDA Gc expressed in Pa.s as a<br>
function of Wc expressed in rad/s performed on resins B and C .<br>
Figure 3 shows a loop reactor usable in a process according to<br>
the present invention.<br>
The following embodiment describes a loop reactor system:<br>
- A monomer (for example ethylene) polymerises in a liquid<br>
diluent (for example isobutane), hydrogen, catal yst,<br>
activating agent, anti-fouling agent, and optionally in the<br>
presence of a comonomer (for example hexene). A reactor<br>
essentially consists of four or more vertical jacketed pipe<br>
sections (1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e, 1f) connected by trough elbows<br>
(3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e, 3f), see Figure 3 which shows a reactor<br>
with six vertical jacketed pipe sections. There are three<br>
lower trough elbows in the reactor in Figure 3 (3b, 3d, 3f)<br>
and three upper trough elbows (3a, 3c, 3e) . The slurry is<br>
maintained in circulation in the reactor by an axial pump (2) .<br>
The polymerisation heat may be extracted by water cooling<br>
jackets around the vertical pipe sections (legs). The<br><br><br>
reactants, diluent and antifouling agent conveniently are<br>
introduced into one of the lower trough elbows of the r eactor.<br>
Typically, the reactants, diluent and antifouling agent are<br>
introduced close to the circulating pump, for example in<br>
position "4", as shown in Figure 3.<br>
- The product (for example polyethylene) may be taken out of<br>
one or more of the lower trough elbows of the reactor, with<br>
some diluent. Typically, the product is removed from a<br>
different trough elbow to the trough elbow into which the<br>
reactants, diluent and antifouling agent are introduced. For<br>
example, in Figure 3, when the reactants, diluent an d<br>
antifouling agent are introduced at position "4", the product<br>
could be removed from trough elbow 3b or 3d.<br>
Slurry removal can be performed using a wash column or<br>
centrifuge apparatus.<br>
Alternatively, slurry removal can be performed through<br>
settling legs and discontinuous discharge valves. In this<br>
discontinuous discharge system, a small fraction of the total<br>
circulating flow is withdrawn.<br>
Alternatively, a continuous discharge system can be used.<br>
If run in series, the product of the first loop rea ctor<br>
collected through the slurry removal system is reinjected in<br>
the second reactor with additional diluent and monomer. If<br>
required, additional antifouling agent can also be added to<br>
the second reactor. A concentration of the slurry between the<br>
reactors can sometimes be performed, e.g. through the use of<br>
hydro-cyclone systems.<br><br>
If the slurry does not need to be transferred to another<br>
reactor, it is moved to a polymer degassing section in which<br>
the solid content is increased.<br>
- While being depressurised , the slurry is degassed, for<br>
example during transfer through heated flash lines to a flash<br>
tank. In the flash tank, the product and diluent are<br>
separated. The degassing is completed in a purge column. The<br>
powder product is then further additivated and pr ocessed into<br>
pellets or additivated powder.<br>
EXPERIMENTS<br>
I Comparison of Present Antifouling Agent with Stadis 450<br>
Methods<br>
Four resins (A-D) were produced using essentially two<br>
different anti-fouling agents, as follows:<br>
Resin A: a bimodal resin produced using 2.2ppm Stadis 450<br>
(RTM) in IC4;<br>
Resin B: a film resin produced using 2.4ppm Stadis 450 (RTM)<br>
in IC4;<br>
Resin C: a film resin produced using 1.1ppm anti -fouling agent<br>
I (AFAI)in isobutene (IC4);<br>
Resin D: a bimodal resin produced using 1.0ppm anti -fouling<br>
agent I (AFAI) in IC4.<br>
Anti-fouling agent I (AFAI) was in accordance with the present<br>
invention and had a formula:<br><br><br>
Anti-fouling Agent I had an OH value of 25.5 mg kOH/g, an<br>
approximate Mw of 4400, and a 10% w/w ethylene oxide content.<br>
The concentrations of anti-fouling agent I in IC4 and Stadis<br>
450 (RTM) in IC4 were calculated so as to introduce the same<br>
amount of active compound into the reactor in each case. In<br>
this regard, Stadis 450 (RTM) cont ains about 50% toluene<br>
whereas anti-fouling agent I contained no solvent.<br>
The anti-fouling agents (AF) were tested in a polymerisation<br>
reaction using a Cr on silica-titania catalyst (2.5 % titania,<br>
1 % Cr, SA of about 500 m2/g and pore volume of 2.5 ml/g.).<br>
Activation was performed in a fluidised bed, under air flow<br>
for 6 hours, at a given temperature. Complete details of the<br>
polymerisation process are provided in Tables 1 and 2 for each<br>
of resins A to D.<br>
The reactor parameters and analysis are summarised in Table 1<br>
below.<br><br><br><br>
Resins A and D were produced at the same reactor temperature,<br>
equivalent alkyl concentration and the same C2 off-gas. In<br>
these experiments, the melt indices MI2 and HLMI were measured<br>
following the method of standard test ASTM D 1238 at a<br>
temperature of 190 °C and under a load of respectively 2.16 kg<br>
and 21.6 kg. The density was measured following the method of<br>
standard test ASTM D 1505 at a temperature of 23 °C and the<br>
bulk density Bdwas measured following the method of s tandard<br>
test ASTM D 1895.<br>
The antifouling agent I as compared to Stadis 450 (RTM) has a<br>
lower poisoning effect, gives higher catalyst productivity and<br>
generates lower melt index potential.<br><br>
After fluff homogenising, a higher HLMI and density was<br>
measured for resin A.<br>
Waxes content was equivalent for both resins A and D.<br><br>
Resins B and C were produced at the equivalent reactor<br>
conditions as shown in Table 2. No significant difference was<br>
observed between the anti -fouling agents in resins B and C in<br>
terms of properties and productivity, although approximately<br>
10% higher productivity was achieved using anti -fouling agent<br>
I in resin C.<br><br>
Resin Properties<br>
Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) and Rheological Dynamic<br>
Analysis (RDA) were performed on all the resins.<br>
Due to low productivity, the molecular weight distributio n<br>
(MWD) of resin A is broad (see GPC results in Table 3), the<br>
weight average molecular weight (Mw) being equivalent. Taking<br>
into account the melt difference (8.8 g/10' with the anti-<br>
fouling agent in resin D and 14.3 with the anti-fouling agent<br>
in resin A) and the equivalent SR2, more long chain branching<br>
is generated with the anti-fouling agent in resin D and this<br>
is related to the higher catalyst productivity. All properties<br>
were measured on pellets.<br><br>
Mn, Mw and Mz represent respectively the number average<br>
molecular weight, the weight average molecular weight and the<br>
z average molecular weight. RDA results confirm that the Melt<br>
Index of resin A is too high and that resin D contains more<br>
long chain branching and/or has a narrower MWD (see Figure 1)<br><br>
GPC and RDA curves show that film resins B and C are<br>
equivalent (see<br>
Table 4 and Figure 2) . MWD are broad for both resins<br>
indicating low productivity.<br><br>
Mechanical Properties<br>
ESCR and antioxydant (AO) tests were performed on resins A and<br>
D (see Table 5) on homogenised fluff and on pellets. Worse<br>
product resistance was observed with resin A due to the higher<br>
density. Some fractures are also obtained With resin A at 100%<br>
Antarox (the average fracture time for the samples is still of<br>
703 hours).<br><br><br><br>
The ESCR was measured following the method of standard test<br>
ASTM D 1690. The tests were performed on 10 samples of each<br>
resin: 6 samples had an average ESCR of slightly above 700 hr<br>
and 4 samples had an average ESCR of over 1250 hr.<br><br>
