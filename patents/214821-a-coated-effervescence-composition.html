				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention is applicable to compositions which need to be dissolved in an aqueous medium in an easy and fast way. This technology may found application in various fields, e.g., in detergent compositions like laundry detergent compositions, soaking detergent compositions, dish washing compositions or any other compositions for household applications, in pharmaceutical preparations, dental preparations, food and the like. More particularly, the present invention relates to granular detergent compositions intended for the cleaning of fabrics.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
A problem associated to conventional granular compositions which are to be used by the consumer after having been diluted typically with water, is their tendency towards poor dissolution or poor dispensing. That tendency has been exacerbated by the recent trend in for example the detergent industry towards higher bulk density granular compositions and towards   granular  detergent  compositions  which  have  a  higher  content   of active ingredients. Granular detergent compositions of high bulk densities ranging from 650 to 1100 kg/m3 are attractive to consumers but not satisfactorily dissolved into an aqueous medium.<br><br>
Another difficulty with detergent compositions is that they are not easily flushed from the dispenser drawer of a washing machine. Similar problems are encountered when usinÂ°<br>
C?<br>
such granular detergent compositions in a dosing device in the washing drum.<br>
It is  known to use citric acid and carbonate in powder compositions to promote dissolution of for example pharmaceutical preparations and detergents by effervescence.<br>
An issue with such compositions containing paniculate acid and carbonate can be the poor storage stability when they are exposed to moisture, leading to a reduced effervescence. Therefore, it is suggested in for example EP 534525-A, to use large particle size citric acid, which is said to be stable when exposed to moisture.<br>
However, the inventors have now surprisingly found that very small particle size acid materials provide improved effervescence. Surprisingly, they found that the small particle size acid can be used in compositions without incurring stability problems of the effervescence system, in contrast to the teaching of the prior art, whilst providing more efficient and rapid effervescence. They have found that the incorporation of very small particle size  acid sources results not only in an improved dispensing/ dissolution compared to larger particle size acids, but   also in an improved, more rapid sudsing, which   may   be   highly   advantages   in   certain   applications.   An   further   improved effervescence performance and more efficient dispensing and/ or dissolution and/ or sudsing is achieved when the carbon dioxide source is also of a small particle size.<br>
Highly preferred may be that the acid and the carbon dioxide source are in an intimate mixture, preferably in the form of a dry effervescence granule. This not only further improves the stability of the effervescence system, but can also increase the effervescence efficiency, thus resulting in smaller amounts of acid source needed for the desired effervescence, dispensing/ dissolution and/ or sudsing. Furthermore, the inventors have found that can be advantageous that the effervescence granule is of a large particle size, to obtain a more stable, better effervescing granule.<br><br>
The inventors have surprisingly found that when small particle size acid sources are used, a  stronger   and   more  homogeneous   particle  can   be  obtained,   thus   improving   the effervescence performance    Furthermore, when a compacted effervescence granule is required, the compaction pressure can be reduced when the small particle size acid source, and optionally small particle size carbon dioxide source, is employed.   Such a granule dissolves more rapidly and provides thus an improved effervescing.   Additionally, or alternatively,  when the granule is made by agglomeration, it has been found to be beneficial that small particle size acids are used; in particular when a binder is used to form the agglomerates the performance characteristics of the effervescence agglomerate have been found to be less effected by the binder when small acid material is incorporated than when larger panicle size material is used.<br>
Furthermore, the inventors have found that when a coating comprising a specific alkoxylated alcohol is present on the effervescence component, or one or more ingredients thereof, this not only increases the stability of the effervescence component when exposed to moisture, but also suprisingly enhances the production of long lasting suds of high volume.<br>
The enhanced production of long lasting suds of high volume by the coated effervescence component also has the added benefit of giving a clear signal to the user that the detergent composition comprising the coated effervesence component has dissolved and is now, or is ready to start, cleaning soiled articles. This is especially applicable in hand washing applications when the introduction of soiled articles into the washing cycle may not be optimal until the detergent composition has dissolved.<br>
Also, the selected alkoxylated alcohol mentioned above may act as a suds suppresser during later stages of the washing cycle, such as during rinsing, and hence possess a dual role in the washing cycle. The specific alkoxylated alcohol, by acting in this dual manner, has a good impact on formulation space, allowing more room for other optional detergent components, since it helps to negate the need for two separate detergent composition constituents for suds production and suppression.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Acid Source<br>
Suitable acid sources herein are capable of providing solid organic, mineral or inorganic acids, and the sources are thereto preferably in the form of acids, salts or derivatives thereof or a mixture thereof. Derivatives in particular include ester of the acids.<br>
In particular organic acids are preferred. It may be preferred that the acids are mono-, bi-or tri-protonic acids. Such preferred acids include mono- or polycarboxylic acids preferably citric acid, adipic acid, glutaric acid, 3 cetoglutaric acid, citramalic acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, malonic acid. Such acids are preferably used in their acidic forms, and it may be preferred that their anhydrous forms are used, or mixtures thereof. Preferred acid sources are malic acid anhydrate and maleic acid anhydrate. Other preferred acids include sulphonic acids such as toluenesulphonic acid.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that by using citric acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid and/ or malic acid, an improved physical and/or chemical stability upon prolonged storage periods is achieved. Furthermore, it has been found that these materials, in particular tartaric acid have an improved dissolution, resulting in an improved effervescence performance.<br><br>
The acid source and preferably the acid itself is a paniculate compound whereof at least 75%, preferably at least 85% or even at least 90% or even at least 95% or even at least 99% by volume, has a particle size from 0.1 to 150 microns and more preferably from 0.5 to 100 microns and it may even be preferred that at least 65% or even at least 75% or even at least 85% has a particle size from 1.0 to 75 microns or even from 1.0 to 55 microns or even form 1.0 to 25 microns.<br>
The particle size of the acid source and the carbon dioxide source herein after, can be determined by any method known in the art, in particular by laser light scattering or deftraction technique, such as with Malvem 2600 or Sympatec Helos laser light scattering equipment (or defractometer).<br>
It may herein be preferred that the acid source has a volume median particle size of between 1 to 120 microns or even between 5 to 75 microns or even between 5 to 55 microns or even from 5 to 30 microns.<br>
The volume median particle size of the acid source and the carbon dioxide source can be determined by any method known in the art, in particular herein by use of the laser light scattering equipment mentioned herein, which is programmed to provide the volume median particle size.<br>
The acid source herein is preferably obtained by grinding or milling coarse acid source material, having a larger particle size than the acid source herein, just prior to incorporation into the effervescence component. Namely, it has been found that handling of the fine particle size acid sources herein after storage may incur problems, and therefor it may be advantages to store the acid source in a coarser form and ground this material prior to use.<br>
Carbon dioxide Source<br>
Another essential feature of the present invention is a carbon dioxide source. When used<br>
herein, carbon dioxide source includes any material which can provide carbon dioxide<br><br>
when reacting with an acid source upon contact with water. This source in particular includes carbonate, bicarbonate and percarbonate salts or mixtures thereof, in particular bicarbonate and/or carbonate. Suitable carbonates to be used herein include carbonate and hydrogen carbonate of potassium, lithium, sodium, and the like amongst which sodium and potassium carbonate are preferred. Suitable bicarbonates to be used herein include any alkali metal salt of bicarbonate like lithium, sodium, potassium and the like, amongst which sodium and potassium bicarbonate are preferred. Bicarbonate may be preferred to be used in combination with or alternative to carbonate, because it is more weight effective. However, the choice of carbonate or bicarbonate or mixtures thereof in the dry effervescent granules may be made depending on the pH desired in the aqueous medium wherein the dry effervescent granules are dissolved. For example where a relative high pH is desired in the aqueous medium (e.g., above pH 9.5) it may be preferred to use carbonate alone or to use a combination of carbonate and bicarbonate wherein the level of carbonate is higher than the level of bicarbonate, typically in a weight ratio of carbonate to bicarbonate from 0.1 to 10, more preferably from 1 to 5 and most preferably from 1 to 2.<br>
The carbon dioxide source has preferably a volume median particle size from 5 to 375 microns, whereby preferably at least 60%, preferably at least 70% or even at least 80% or even at least 90% by volume, has a particle size of from 1 to 425 microns. More preferably, the carbon dioxide source has a volume median particle size of 10 to 250, whereby preferably at least 60 %, or even at least 70% or even at least 80% or even at least 90% by volume, has a particle size of from 1 to 375 microns; or even preferably a volume median particle size from 10 to 200 microns, whereby preferably at least 60 %, preferably at least 70% or even at least 80% or even at least 90% by volume, has a particle size of from 1 to 250 microns.<br>
In one preferred embodiment the carbon dioxide source has a particle size similar to the acid source, preferably such that at least 60% or even 75% of the carbon dioxide source has a particle size from 1 to 150 microns, whereby preferably the source has a volume median particle size of between 1 to 120 microns, but more preferably at least 60% or even 75% of the source having a particle size from 1 to 100 microns, having a volume<br><br>
median particle size of from 5 to 75, or even preferably at least 60% or even 75% of the source having a panicle size of from 1.0 to 75 microns or even from 1.0 to 55 microns or even form 1.0 to 25 microns.<br>
It may be preferred that the carbon dioxide source of the required particle size is obtained by grinding a larger particle size material, optionally followed by selecting the material with the required particle size by any suitable method.<br>
Intimate effervescence mixture/ effervescent granule and process for its manufacturing The acid source and carbon dioxide source, or at least part thereof are preferably present in an intimate mixture with one another, which means for the purpose of the invention that the acid source and carbon dioxide source are homogeneously mixed. Thus, in one highly preferred embodiment, at least part of the acid source and at least part of the carbon dioxide source are not separate discrete particles. Highly preferred is that the acid source and the carbon dioxide source are present in an effervescence granule, preferably being a dry effervescence granule.<br>
The acid is preferably present in the intimate mixture or the effervescent granules at a level of from 0.1% to 99% by weight of the total granule, preferably from 3% to 75%, more preferably from 5% to 60% and most preferably from 15% to 50%.<br>
The carbon dioxide source is preferably present in the intimate mixture or the effervescent granules at a level of from 0.1% to 99% by weight of the total, preferably from 30% to 95%, more preferably from 45% to 85% and most preferably from 50% to 80%.<br>
By "dry" it is to be understood that the granule is substantially free of water, i.e., that no water has been added or present other than the moisture of the raw materials themselves. Typically, the level of water is below 5% by weight of the total intimate mixture or granule, preferably below 3% and more preferably below 1.5%.<br><br>
It may be preferred that a desiccant is present in the intimate mixture or the effervescence granule, such as overdried inorganic and organic salts, anhydrous salts, in particular overdried silicates and aluminosilicates, anhydrous silicates and/ or sulphate salts.<br>
For optimum effervescence in aqueous medium the weight ratio of acid source to carbon dioxide source in the intimate mixture or the effervescent granule is preferably from 0.1 to 10, preferably from 0.5 to 2.5 and more preferably from 1 to 2.<br>
The effervescent granules are preferably obtainable by a process comprising a granulation step, preferably comprising the step of dry-powder compaction or pressure agglomeration. While all binding mechanisms can occur in pressure agglomeration, adhesion forces between the solid particles, i.e., between the acid, carbon dioxide source and optionally the binder if present,  play an  especially important role.  This  is  because pressure agglomeration, especially high pressure agglomeration, is an essentially dry process that forms new entities (i.e., dry effervescent granules) from solid particles (i.e., the acid, bicarbonate, carbonate source and optionally the binder) by applying external forces to densify a more or less defined bulk mass or volume and create binding mechanisms between the solid particles providing strength to the new entity, i.e. the high external force applied brings the solid particles closely together.   The inventors have surprisingly found that in the present invention reduced pressure may be sufficient to form a stable granule incorporating the small particle size acid source, with preferably small particle size carbon dioxide source as defined above.<br>
The effervescent granules may have any particle size, the preferred particle size depending on the application and the component of the granule.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the effervescence granule has a weight average particle size from 500 microns to 1500 microns whereby preferably at least 70% or even at least 80% by weight of said granule has a particle size from 350 to 2000 microns, or even having a weight average particle size from 650 microns to 1180 microns whereby preferably at least 70% or even 80% by weight of said granule has a particle size from 500 to 1500<br><br>
microns, or even having a weight average particle size from 710 microns to 1000 microns whereby preferably at least 70% or even 80% by weight of said granule has a particle size from 600 to 1180 microns. It has been found that effervescence particles of these particle size parameters, comprising the acid source as defined herein, not only can provide improved dispensing/ dissolution but also can provide an improved sudsing, including more rapid sudsing, and/ or improved foam.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the effervescence granule has preferably a weight average particle size from 200 microns to 500 microns whereby preferably at least 70% of said granule has a particle size from 100 to 710 microns, or even having a weight average particle size from 250 microns to 450 microns whereby preferably at least 70% of said granule has a particle size from 150 to 650 microns. It has been found that effervescence particles of these particle size parameters, comprising the acid source as defined herein, can provide better dispensing and/ or dissolution of the detergent composition than larger effervescence particles, mentioned above<br>
The weight average particle size of the effervescence granule herein and the detergent granules herein after can be determined by any method known in the art, in particular by sieving a sample of the particulate acid relevant material herein through a series of sieves, typically 5, with meshes of various diameter or aperture size, obtaining a number of fraction (thus having a particle size of above, below or between the mesh sizes of the used sieve sizes), whereof the weight is determined (weight fractions). The average particle size per fraction and then the weight average particle size of the material can be calculated, taking in account the weight percentage per fraction (e.g. plotting the weight fractions against the aperture size of the sieves).<br>
The intimate mixture or the effervescent granules may optionally comprise a binder or a mixture of binders. Any binder material known in the art can be used. For example highly suitable are materials which have a melting point above 40 C, put preferably below 200 C or 100C. In general, suitable binders to use herein are those known to those skilled in the art and include anionic surfactants like C6-C20 alkyl or alkylaryl sulphonates or<br><br>
sulphates, preferably C8-C20 aklylbenzene sulphonates, fatty acids, cellulose derivatives such as carboxymethylcellulose and homo- or co- polymeric polycarboxylic acid or their salts, nonionic surfactants, preferably C10-C20 alcohol ethoxylates containing from 5-100 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol and more preferably the C15-C20 primary alcohol ethoxylates containing from 20-100 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol. Of these tallow alcohol ethoxylated with 25 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol (TAE25) or 50 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol (TAE50) are preferred. Other preferred binders include the polymeric materials like polyvinylpyrrolidones with an average molecular weight of from 12 000 to 700 000 and polyethylene glycols with an average weight of from 600 to 10 000.   Copolymers of maleic anhydride with ethylene, methylvinyl ether, methacrylic acid or acrylic acid are other examples of polymeric binders. Others binders further include C10-C20 mono and diglycerol ethers as well as C10-C20 fatty acids.<br>
It may be preferred that the effervescence granule comprises a coating agent, which can be selected from any coating agent known in the art. Preferred coating agents are materials which can be applied to the granule in the form of a melt, which is solid under ambient conditions, such as polymeric materials, nonionic surfactants. These materials may be also used as binding agents, described herein. Also preferred may be coating agent which can be applied to the granule in the form of an aqueous solution or a solution in an organic solvent, including organic and inorganic acids or salts. Furthermore, the granules may also be coated by dusting a particulate material onto the granule, for example desiccants as described herein.<br>
It may be preferred that the intimate mixture or the granule comprises other ingredients, such as detergent actives when employed in detergent compositions. Preferred are surfactants (which may also act as binder and/ or coating agents), bleaching components in particular bleach activators or precursors, catalyst or perhydrogen salts, perfumes, brightners, builders, enzymes.<br><br>
Typically, they compose up to 70 % by weight of the total granule or mixture of one or more binders and/ or other actives, preferably up to 50% and more preferably up to 35%.<br>
The present invention further encompasses a process for manufacturing the effervescent granules of the present invention comprising an acid, carbon dioxide source and optionally a binder, wherein the acid, carbon dioxide source and optionally the binder are in an intimate mixture This process preferably comprises the steps of:<br>
-	first obtaining the acid source of the particle size defined herein, preferably by grinding<br>
larger particle size acid source material as commercially available,<br>
-	mixing the thus obtained acid source with the carbon dioxide source, preferably by<br>
grinding larger particle size acid source material as commercially available, and optionally<br>
mixing a binder and/ or other ingredients, to form a mixture,<br>
-	then submitting the mixture to a granulation step, preferably comprising the step of<br>
extrusion, spheronisation, more preferably compaction or agglomeration.<br>
Optionally, other ingredients can be added to the obtained granule, such as coating agents, which will be discussed in more detail later.<br>
By "granulation step" it is meant that the resulting mixture is made into granules of the required size as defined herein before.<br>
A preferred process to be used herein is roller compaction. In this process the acid and carbon dioxide sources and optionally the binder and other ingredients, after having been mixed together, are forced between two compaction rolls that applies a pressure to said mixture so that the rotation of the rolls transforms the mixture into a compacted sheet/flake. This compacted sheet/flake is then granulated. One way to carry this out is to mill the compacted flake/sheet or to granulate the agglomerate mixture by conventional means. Milling may typically be carried out with a Flake Crusher FC 200Â® commercially available from Hosokawa Bepex GmbH. Depending on the end particle size desired for the effervescent granules the milled material may further be sieved. Such a sieving of the<br><br>
dry effervescent granules can for example be carried out with a commercially available Alpine Airj'et Screen Â®.<br>
According to this process the effervescent raw materials and optionally the binder if present are preferably mixed together without the addition of water and/or moisture apart those coming from the raw materials themselves so as to obtain a dry free flowing powder mixture. Then this dry free flowing powder mixture comprising the effervescent particles (i.e. the acid and carbon dioxide source), and optionally the binder particles if present, undergoes a granulation step, preferably including a pressure agglomeration step, i.e. a dry process step wherein this free flowing powder mixture undergoes high external forces that bring the particles closely together thereby densifying the bulk mass of said particles and creating binding mechanisms between the solid effervescent particles and the binder if present.<br>
Typical roller compactors for use herein is for example Pharmapaktor L200/50PÂ® commercially available from Hosokawa Bepex GmbH. The process variables during the pressure agglomeration step via roller compaction are the distance between the rolls, the feed rate, the compaction pressure and the roll speed. Typical feeding device is a feed screw. The distance between the rolls is typically from 0.5 cm to 10 cm, preferably from 3 to 7 cm, more preferably from 4 to 6 cm. The pressing force is typically between 20 kN and 120 kN, preferably from 30 kN to lOOkN, more preferably from 40 kN to 80 kN, altough lower pressures are possible and may be preferred in the present invention employing file particle size acid sources. Typically, the roll speed is between 1 rpm and 180 rpm, preferably from 2 rpm to 50 rpm and more preferably from 2 rpm to 35 rpm. Typically, the feed rate is between 1 rpm and 100 rpm, preferably from 5 rpm to 70 rpm, more preferably from 8 rpm to 50 rpm. Temperature at which compaction is carried out is not relevant, typically it varies from 0Â° C to 40 Â°C.<br>
It may be preferred that the granules are made under dry-air, having a humidity of below 30%.<br><br>
Coating of the effervescence component<br>
It may be preferred that the effervescence component is coated by any coating agent known in the art, or a mixture thereof. Preferably the coating comprises a surfactant and any other optional detergent ingredient. Usually, the surfactant forms at least 20% by weight of the coating, preferably &gt;75%, more preferably &gt;95% and even more preferably 100%.<br>
The surfactant can be any surfactant known in the art, preferably an alkoxylated alcohol, more preferably an alkoxylated alcohol with an average alkoxylation degree of at least 20, more preferably at least 40, even more preferably from 50- to 80. The alkoxylated alcohol usually has a melting point of at least 40Â°C, preferably at least 50Â°C, more preferably from 60Â°C to 70Â°C. Preferably, the alkoxy groups are ethoxygroups.<br>

polyvinylpyrrolidonepolymers or combinations thereof, whereby these polymers can be cross-linked polymers.<br>
Polymeric Soil Release Agent<br>
Polymeric soil release agents, hereinafter "SRA", can optionally be employed in the present components or compositions. If utilized, SRA's will generally comprise from 0.01% to 10.0%, typically from 0.1% to 5%, preferably from 0.2% to 3.0% by weight.<br>
Preferred SRA's typically have hydrophilic segments to hydrophilize the surface of hydrophobic fibers such as polyester and nylon, and hydrophobic segments to deposit upon hydrophobic fibers and remain adhered thereto through completion of washing and rinsing cycles, thereby serving as an anchor for the hydrophilic segments. This can enable stains occurring subsequent to treatment with the SRA to be more easily cleaned in later washing procedures.<br>
Preferred SRA's include oligomeric terephthalate esters, typically prepared by processes involving at least one transesterification/oligomerization, often with a metal catalyst such as a titanium(IV) alkoxide. Such esters may be made using additional monomers capable of being incorporated into the ester structure through one, two, three, four or more positions, without, of course, forming a densely crosslinked overall structure.<br><br>
Suitable SRA's include a sulfonated product of a substantially linear ester oligomer comprised of an oligomeric ester backbone of terephthaloyl and oxyalkyleneoxy repeat units and allyl-derived sulfonated terminal moieties covalently attached to the backbone, for example as described in U.S. 4,968,451, November 6, 1990 to J.J. Scheibel and E.P. Gosselink.   Such ester oligomers can be prepared by: (a) ethoxylating allyl alcohol; (b) reacting the product of (a) with dimethyl terephthalate ("DMT") and 1,2-propylene glycol ("PG") in a two-stage transesterification/oligomerization procedure; and (c) reacting the product of (b) with sodium metabisulfite in water. Other SRA's include the nonionic end-capped   1,2-propylene/polyoxyethylene   terephthalate   polyesters   of  U.S.   4,711,730, December    8,    1987    to    Gosselink    et    al.,    for    example    those    produced    by transesterification/oligomerization of poly(ethyleneglycol) methyl ether, DMT, PG and poly(ethyleneglycol) ("PEG").   Other examples of SRA's include: the partly- and fully-anionic-end-capped oligomeric esters of U.S. 4,721,580, January 26, 1988 to Gosselink, such   as   oligomers  from   ethylene  glycol  ("EG"),  PG,   DMT  and  Na-3,6-dioxa-8-hydroxyoctanesulfonate; the nonionic-capped block polyester oligomeric compounds of U.S.    4,702,857, October 27,  1987 to Gosselink, for example produced from DMT, methyl (Me)-capped PEG and EG and/or PG, or a combination of DMT, EG and/or PG, Me-capped   PEG   and   Na-dimethyl-5-sulfoisophthalate;   and   the   anionic,   especially sulfoaroyl,  end-capped terephthalate esters of U.S. 4,877,896, October 31,  1989  to Maldonado, Gosselink et al., the latter being typical of SRA's useful in both laundry and fabric conditioning products, an example being an ester composition made from m-sulfobenzoic acid monosodium salt, PG and DMT, optionally but preferably further comprising added PEG, e.g., PEG 3400.<br>
SRA's also include: simple copolymeric blocks of ethylene terephthalate or propylene terephthalate with polyethylene oxide or polypropylene oxide terephthalate, see U.S. 3,959,230 to Hays, May 25, 1976 and U.S. 3,893,929 to Basadur, July 8, 1975; cellulosic derivatives such as the hydroxyether cellulosic polymers available as METHOCEL from Dow; the C1-C4 alkyl celluloses and C4 hydroxyalkyl celluloses, see U.S. 4,000,093, December 28, 1976 to Nicol, et al.; and the methyl cellulose ethers having an average<br><br>
degree of substitution (methyl) per aahydroglucose unit from about 1.6 to about 2.3 and a solution viscosity of from about 80 to about 120 centipoise measured at 20Â°C as a 2% aqueous solution. Such materials are available as METOLOSE SMI00 and METOLOSE SM200, which are the trade names of methyl cellulose ethers manufactured by Shin-etsu Kagaku Kogyo KK.<br>
Additional classes of SRA's include: (I) nonionic terephthalates using diisocyanate coupling agents to link polymeric ester structures, see U.S. 4,201,824, Violland et al. and U.S. 4,240,918 Lagasse et al.; and (II) SRA's with carboxylate terminal groups made by adding trimellitic anhydride to known SRA's to convert terminal hydroxyl groups to trimellitate esters. With the proper selection of catalyst, the trimellitic anhydride forms linkages to the terminals of the polymer through an ester of the isolated carboxylic acid of trimellitic anhydride rather than by opening of the anhydride linkage. Either nonionic or anionic SRA's may be used as starting materials as long as they have hydroxyl terminal groups which may be esterifled. See U.S. 4,525,524 Tung et al.. Other classes include: (III) anionic terephthalate-based SRA's of the urethane-linked variety, see U.S. 4,201,824, Violland et al.;<br>
Other Optional Ingredients<br>
Other optional ingredients suitable for inclusion in the compositions of the invention include colours and filler salts, with sodium sulfate being a preferred filler salt.<br>
Highly preferred compositions contain from about 2% to about 10% by weight of an organic acid, preferably citric acid. Also, preferably combined with a carbonate salt, minor amounts (e.g., less than about 20% by weight) of neutralizing agents, buffering agents, phase regulants, hydrotropes, enzyme stabilizing agents, polyacids, suds regulants, opacifiers, anti-oxidants, bactericides and dyes, such as those described in US Patent 4,285,841 to Barrat et al., issued August 25, 1981 (herein incorporated by reference), can be present.<br><br>
Chlorine-Based Bleach<br>
The detergent compositions can include as an additional component a chlorine-based bleach. However, since the detergent compositions of the invention are solid, most liquid chlorine-based bleaching will not be suitable for these detergent compositions and only granular or powder chlorine-based bleaches will be suitable.<br>
Alternatively, the detergent compositions can be formulated such that they are chlorine-based bleach-compatible, thus ensuring that a chlorine based bleach can be added to the detergent composition by the user at the beginning or during the washing process.<br>
The chlorine-based bleachis such that a hypochlorite species is formed in aqueous solution. The hypochlorite ion is chemically represented by the formula OCT.<br>
Those bleaching agents which yield a hypochlorite species in aqueous solution include alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hypochlorites, hypochlorite addition products, chloramines, chlorimines, chloramides, and chlorimides. Specific examples of compounds of this type include sodium hypochlorite, potassium hypochlorite, monobasic calcium hypochlorite, dibasic magnesium hypochlorite, chlorinated trisodium phosphate dodecahydrate, potassium dichloroisocyanurate, sodium dichloroisocyanurate sodium dichloroisocyanurate dihydrate, trichlorocyanuric acid, l,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin, N-chlorosulfamide, Chloramine T, Dichloramine T, chloramine B and Dichloramine B. A preferred bleaching agent for use in the compositions of the instant invention is sodium hypochlorite, potassium hypochlorite, or a mixture thereof. A preferred chlorine-based bleach can be Triclosan (trade name).<br>
Most of the above-described hypochlorite-yielding bleaching agents are available in solid or concentrated form and are dissolved in water during preparation of the compositions of the instant invention. Some of the above materials are available as aqueous solutions.<br>
Laundrv Washing Method<br><br>
Machine laundry methods herein typically comprise treating soiled laundry with an aqueous wash solution in a washing machine having dissolved or dispensed therein an effective amount of a machine laundry detergent composition in accord with the invention. By an effective amount of the detergent composition it is meant from lOg to 300g of product dissolved or dispersed in a wash solution of volume from 5 to 65 litres, as are typical product dosages and wash solution volumes commonly employed in conventional machine laundry methods. Preferred washing machines may be the so-called low-fill machines.<br>
In a preferred use aspect the composition is formulated such that it is suitable for hard-surface cleaning or hand washing. In another preferred aspect the detergent composition is a pre-treatment or soaking composition, to be used to pre-treat or soak soiled and stained fabrics.<br>

Example 2. Coating the Effervescence Component<br>
Tallow alcohol ethylene oxide condensate (TAE) of type tallow alcohol condensed with 50 to 80 moles of ethylene oxide (TAE 50/80) is melted at 70Â°C. 4.750kg of effervescence component (compacted 64% citnc acid with 36% sodium carbonate) is placed into a rotating drum mixer (Eirich) and the mixer is turned on but not set to rotate. This is to encourage slow mixing of the "fizz particles". 250g melted TAE 50/80 is placed in a heated vessel (outer water jacket ~80Â°C) attached to a Devilbliss spraygun with atomising air at 80Â°C. This is to give 5% of total weight TAE 50/80. The drum mixer is turned on to rotate and the melted TAE 50/80 is sprayed onto the moving effervescence components in such a manner as to adhere onto the surface of the effervescence components, effectively coating the effervescence components. Once all of the melted TAE 50/80 has been sprayed onto the effervescence components, the drum mixer is left to rotate until the TAE 50/80 has hardened on the surface of the effervescence components (i.e. until it has solidified). The TAE 50/80 coated effervescence components are then screened at 1180 micrometers to remove any agglomerated particles. This is particle XIII in regard to the examples.<br><br><br><br>
