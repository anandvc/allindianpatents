				<td>The invention relates to the technical field of the chemical synthesis of bioactive compounds, preferably the processes for the preparation of crop protection agents and intermediates for these processes.<br>
It has been disclosed that 2-amino-4-chloro-1,3,5-triazines which are substituted by organic radicals in the 6-position on the triazine ring can be employed for preparing bioactive aminotriazines, for example herbicidal aminotriazines, the chlorine atom being exchanged for an N-substituted amino radical; cf. WO-A-90/09378, WO-A-96/25404, WO-A-97/00254, WO-A-97/08156, WO-A-97/19936, WO-A-97/29095, WO-A-97/31904, WO-A-97/35481, WO-A-98/10654, WO-A-98/15536, WO-A-98/15537, WO-A-98/15538, WO-A-98/15539; moreover, aminotriazines have been proposed in International Application No. PCT/EP98/00283 and in German Patent Application No. 19826670.7.<br>
The substituted 2-amino-4-chloro-1,3,5-triazines can be obtained in accordance with a known process from the suitably substituted 2,4-dichloro-1,3,5-triazines and ammonia, or amines [J. Med. Chem. 12 (1969)41, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 82 (1960) 3760]. The 6-substituted 2,4-dichloro-1,3,5-triazines, which are employed as starting compounds for this purpose, can be prepared, for example, from cyanuric chloride and Grignard compounds which are substituted in the 6-position on the triazine ring like the organic radical [Helv. Chim. Acta 33 (1950) 1368]. Alternatively, they can be synthesized from trichloromethyl isocyanide dichloride and amidines which are substituted in the 6-position on the triazine ring like the organic radical (cf.DE-A-1178437}.<br>
The disadvantages of the known processes are the limited availability, in particular the lack of availability of the Grignard compounds for the<br><br>
preparation of triazines with alkyl radicals in the 6-position, and frequently poor yields when reacting the dichlorotriazines with ammonia or amines.<br>
It is an object of the invention to prepare in an alternative and preferably advantageous manner 2-amino-4-chloro-l,3,5-triazines which have unsubstituted or substituted aliphatic hydrocarbon radicals in the 6-position. This is also intended to make available some novel triazines of the formula (I).<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of compounds of the formula (I) or salts thereof<br><br>
in which R! is (CrCg)alkyl or (CrCg)cycloalkyl, where each of the two<br>
abovementioned radicals independently of one another is unsubstituted or substituted<br>
by one or more radicals selected from the group consisting of halogen, hydroxyl,<br>
cyano, nitro, thiocyanato, formyl, (CrC8)alkoxy, (CrCg)alkylthio, (Cr<br>
C8)alkylsulfmyl,	(C,-C8)alkylsulfonyI,	[(C,-Cg)-alkyl]carbonyl,	[(Cr<br>
Cg)alkoxy]carbonyl, (C2-C8)alkenyl, (C2-C8)alkynyl, (C3-Q)cycloalkyl, phenyl and, in the case of cycloalkyl, also (C|-C8)alkyl, each of the last-mentioned 11 radicals being unsubstituted or substituted by one or more radicals selected from the group consisting of halogen, (CrC4)alkoxy, (C|-C4)alkylthio and, in the case of cyclic radicals, also (CrC4)alkyl and (CrC4)haloalkyl, and R2, R3 in each case independently of one another are hydrogen, amino, hydroxyl, formyl or unsubstituted or substituted (C,-Cg)alkyl, (CrC8)alkylamino, di[(CrC8)a!kyl] amino, (CrC8)aIkyloxy, aryl, aryloxy,<br><br>
(C3-Cg)cycloalkyl, [(C]-C8)alkyI]carbonyl, [(CrC8)alkoxy]carbonyl, arylcarbonyl, aryloxycarbonyl, (CrC8)alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl or an unsubstituted or substituted heterocyclyl radical, heterocyclyloxy radical, heterocyclylamino radical, each of which has 3 to 6 ring atoms and 1 to 3 hetero ring atoms selected from the group consisting of N, O and S, or R2, R3 together with the nitrogen atom of the group NR2R3 are a heterocyclic radical having 3 to 6 ring atoms and 1 to 4 hetero ring atoms, where, in addition to the nitrogen atom, the other hetero ring atoms which may exist are selected from the group consisting of N, O and S and the heterocycle is unsubstituted or substituted, which comprises converting a compound of the general formula (II)<br><br>
in which X represents (Ci-C4)alkyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more radicals selected from the group consisting of halogen, (CrC4)alkoxy, (Cr 4)alkylthio, (C3-C6)cycloalkyl and phenyl, each of the last-mentioned 4 radicals being unsubstituted or substituted by one or more radicals selected from the group consisting of halogen, (C,-C4)aIkoxy, (Ci-C4)alkylthio and, in the case of cyclic radicals, also (Ci-C4)alkyl and (CrC4)haloalkyl, or represents phenyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more radicals selected from the group consisting of halogen, cyano, nitro, (C,-C4)alkyl, (C,-C4)haloalkyl, (CrC4)alkoxy, (CrC4)haloalkoxy, (Cr C4)alkylthio and [(Ci-C4)alkoxy]carbonyl, or represents a 2-amino-4-thio-1,3,5-triazine radical which is bonded via sulfur and equally substituted, by chlorinatiort in the presence of an essentially anhydrous protic solvent selected from carboxylic acids having 1 to 4 carbon atoms into the compound of the formula (I).<br><br>
The 2-amino-4-thio-l,3,5-triazines (II), which act as starting materials, are known or can be prepared analogously to known processes [cf.DE-A-4139624, Chem. Ber. 100 (1967) 1874-1891, J. Heterocyclic Chem. 27 (1990) 1565-1568, J. Heterocyclic Chem. 23 (1986) 1709-1714].<br>
A chlorinating agent is required in the process according to the invention, for example chlorine, salts of hypochlorous acid, phosphorus pentachloride,<br><br>
phosphoryl chloride (=phosphorus oxychloride) or thionyl chloride, preferably chlorine.<br>
The chlorinating agent is employed, for example, in amounts of 1 to 100 equivalents based on the compound of the formula (II), preferably 1 to 10 equivalents, in particular in equimolar amounts up to an excess, which allows a reaction of the compound of the formula (II) to take place. An equivalent in this context is to be understood as meaning such an amount of chlorinating agent which is required for reacting the compound (II) according to stoichiometrical reasons.<br>
In principle, the chlorination reaction can be carried out without additional solvent and/or diluent (hereinbelow both: solvent), or, most expediently, in the presence of a solvent. Suitable solvents are preferably organic solvents which are largely inert to the chlorinating agent and the compounds of the formulae (II) and (I) under the reaction conditions. Examples of suitable solvents are:<br>
1. Predominantly aprotic organic solvents which are inert under the reaction<br>
conditions, for example<br>
aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons such as, for example, mineral<br>
oils, petroleum ether, cyclohexane or toluene, xylenes, naphthalene<br>
derivatives, ©Solvesso 200 (high-boiling aromatic mixture);<br>
halogenated aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons such as methylene<br>
chloride, dichloroethane, chloroform or chlorobenzene;<br>
cyclic or open-chain ethers such as diethyl ether, di-n-propyl ether,<br>
diisopropyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF),<br>
dioxane, alkylene glycol monoalkyl ethers and alkylene glycol dialkyl<br>
ethers such as, for example, propylene glycol monomethyl ether,<br>
propylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether<br>
or ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, dimethoxyethane, diglyme,<br>
triglyme and tetraglyme;<br>
amides such as dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide and<br>
N-methylpyrrolidone;<br>
ketones such as cyclohexanone, methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK);<br><br>
nitriles such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, butyronitrile and<br>
benzonitrile;<br>
sulfoxides and sulfones such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and<br>
sulfolane,<br>
carboxylic esters such as the esters of mono-, di-and tricarboxylic<br>
acids with aliphatic alcohols having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, for<br>
example ethyl formate, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, n-propyl<br>
acetate, i-propyl acetate, esters of acetic acid with n-, i-, sec- or tert-<br>
butanol,<br>
mixtures of two or more of the abovementioned solvents;<br>
2.       Essentially anhydrous, preferably largely anhydrous, protic solvents and their mixtures or mixtures with the abovementioned aprotic solvents. Examples of protic solvents are<br>
aliphatic alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n- or i-propanol, n-, I-, sec- or tert-butanol, glycols;<br>
carboxylic acids, for example those having 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as formic acid, acetic acid, n-propionic acid or n- and isobutanoic acid.<br>
If the compounds of the formula (II) are chlorinated with chlorine, especially suitable solvents are, for example, methylene chloride, chloroform and concentrated acetic acid, preferably the corresponding anhydrous solvents such as, for example, glacial acetic acid.<br>
The reaction can be carried out within a wide temperature range, in some cases depending on the substrate, the chlorinating agent and the solvent, for example at temperatures between -40°C and the boiling point of the solvent in question, preferably between -20°C and 100°C, in particular between 0°C and 50°C. The reaction temperature should be low enough to avoid side reactions, but high enough to allow a conversion within technically feasible reaction times.<br>
As regards the pressure, particular conditions are not required: as a rule, it<br><br>
is possible or expedient to carry out the chlorination reaction under atmospheric pressure.<br>
Generally customary methods may be employed for working up the reaction mixture. After the reaction, it is possible, for example, to pass an inert gas, for example nitrogen gas, through the mixture so as to remove excess chlorine gas, and subsequently to pour the reaction mixture into water. The product is separated from the water and dried.<br>
If the chlorination reaction is carried out in the presence of solvents which are miscible with water, such as, for example, carboxylic acids, the reaction mixture is preferably put into an aqueous solution of a base. If the chlorination reaction is carried out in the presence of solvents which are not miscible with water such as, for example, halogenated hydrocarbons, a base which is not soluble in this solvent is preferably added to the reaction mixture after chlorination, and the mixture is filtered and the product separated from the solvent and dried. Suitable bases are customary organic and, preferably, inorganic bases, and aqueous solutions of these, for example hydroxides or carbonates of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals.<br>
Some chlorination reactions of 2-amino-4-alkylthio-1,3,5-triazines are already known, but the triazines are substituted by aromatic radicals in the 6-position on the triazine ring. Thus, chlorination reactions for the preparation of 2,4-dich!aro-6-(2-pyridy!)-1,3,5-triazine [Tetrahedron 31 (1975) 1879-1882] or of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(2",4"-dimethylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine [US-A-5084570] from the corresponding alkylthio-1,3,5-triazines have already been described. The conditions for the chlorination reaction which are given in the known protocols cannot be simply used for the 2-amino-4-thio-1,3,5-triazines of the formula (II) which have unsubstituted or substituted alkyl radicals in the 6-position. In contrast to aromatic radicals in the 6-position, the alkylthio-1,3,5-triazines which have unsubstituted or substituted aliphatic radicals in the 6-position and which are employed in accordance with the invention generally require milder chlorination conditions. Moreover, the amino group in the 2-position can sometimes lead to undesired side reactions and thus to yield losses or lower product purities<br><br>
when using the known chlorination conditions.<br>

synthesis of active substances, the radical R1 preferably has the following<br>

The formula (I) and (ll) also encompass all stereoisomers. Such compounds contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms or else double bonds which are not mentioned specifically in the formulae. The stereoisomers which are possible and which are defined by their specific spatial form, such as enantiomers, diastereomers, Z- and E-isomers, can be obtained by customary methods from mixtures of the stereoisomers or else be prepared by stereoselective reactions in combination with the use of stereochemically pure starting materials.<br>
It is preferred to react the compounds (I) with amines of the formula (III)<br>
A-NH-R	(III),<br>
with exchange of the chlorine atom, to give herbicidal aminotriazines of the formula (IV)<br><br><br>
where, in formulae (III) and (IV), the radicals R1, R2, R3 are as defined in formula (I) and A and R are radicals which in conjunction with the remaining molecular structure of the formula (IV) constitute the chemical structure of a herbicidally active aminotriazine.<br>

The definition of the herbicidal aminotriazines from the publications is specifically incorporated by reference; they are thus part of the present description.<br>
In formula (IV), the radical A is preferably a (Ci-C6)alkylene chain which is substituted in the a-position relative to the amino group by an unsubstituted or substituted alkyl radical and in the ©-position by an unsubstituted or substituted aryl, heteroaryl, aryloxy or heteroaryloxy radical and which can also have further substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen, alkyl, alkoxy and hydroxyl.<br>
R is preferably H or alkyl such as (CrC4)alkyl, in particular H.<br>
Especially preferred are the preferred herbicidal aminotriazines which are<br><br>
mentioned in the above publications", in particular the compounds which are in each case defined specifically, such as the preparation examples and the individually defined tabulated examples, as long as the radicals which correspond to the radicals R1, R2 and R3 in formula (IV) are defined within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to a process for the preparation of herbicidal aminotriazines of the formula (IV), which comprises first preparing, in accordance with the invention, a compound of the formula (!) and then reacting it with an amine of the formula (Ml) to give the compound of the formula (IV).<br>
Reaction conditions for reacting the compounds of the formulae (I) and (III) are known in principle from the publications mentioned in connection with the herbicidal aminotriazines (IV) and from the literature cited therein, or can be carried out analogously to the standard reactions known to the skilled worker for reacting heteroaromatic chlorine compounds with amines.<br>
The invention generally also relates to the use of compounds of the formula (I) or salts thereof which have been obtained by the process according to the invention for the preparation of the compounds (I) for the preparation of bioactive substances from the chemical class of the aminotriazines, preferably the herbicidal aminotriazines.<br>
