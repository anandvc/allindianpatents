The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
l<br><br>
"A Screw less Multipurpose Modular Furniture Assembly"<br>
Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a modular furniture assembly. More particularly it relates to a modular furniture assembly configured in the form of table or like work stations.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
In today's business world, flexibility is one of the greatest keys to success, particularly in the case of small and mid-size businesses. A large business may have enough sheer power and leverage to make it on a few core services, but smaller businesses almost always need to be able to diversify in order to survive. In order to allow the necessarily level of flexibility for the company as a whole, one will need to reflect that flexibility in each separate area of his business, not only including the abilities of his employees, but also the very layout of his offices.<br>
This sort of all around flexibility will allow his business to adapt in whatever sorts of ways his current situation might dictate. One of the best ways to accomplish this degree of flexibility in his office space is through the use of modular office furniture. Modular office furniture is often the key to a flexible and productive office.<br>
Modular office furniture is, well, modular, which essentially just means that it is made from pieces which are designed to fit back together in any number of different combinations. In the case of office furniture, modular essentially means that if one need to have an I-shaped desk, one would not have to go out and find such a desk, in the proper measurements. Rather, one might 'build' the desk out of two or more modular desk pieces, and perhaps a piece to join them together better.<br>
This means that one can reconfigure his office space entirely, pretty much at will. With the use of modular office furniture, one can quickly and easily take apart an outdated design, and rework it into a layout that is more beneficial to the specific sort of job one will be doing.<br><br>
Similarly, one can add on pieces as necessary, such as bookcases, and the like, as necessary in order to best facilitate the required tasks.<br>
Another excellent feature of modular furniture is the ability to simply rearrange things. There have been studies that suggest that essentially any change in a previously static workplace environment can inspire an increase in productivity amongst workers. As such, if layouts of the office periodically rework, one may be able to give his business' productivity the boost it needs.<br>
Various kinds of modular furniture capable of being assembled and disassembled by the customer are presently available in market. But these customer-assembled furniture suffers from following deficiencies:<br>
i.	This furniture fails to get the full aesthetic look and finishing as obtained by<br>
factory assembly, <br>
ii.	It is complex and non-flexible, <br>
iii.	It is not easy to assemble and disassemble, <br>
iv.       It consists of screws or like fastening means for the purpose of assembling and<br>
disassembling of the furniture, <br>
