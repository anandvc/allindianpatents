				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF 6CI-FLUOROSTEROIDS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention refers to a stereoselective process for the preparation of 6a-fluorosteroids of formula (I) reported hereinafter, useful in the preparation of anti¬inflammatory pharmaceutical formulations. Prior art<br>
The availability of a process for the preparation of pregnane fluoro derivatives, which might predominantly yield 6 (3-fluoro substituted isomers, well known anti¬inflammatory agents, is very important from a pharmacological point of view, since the corresponding 6 p-fluoro derivatives do not exert any pharmacological action. Many procedures for the preparation of 6-fluoro pregnane derivatives have been developed so far; however, all of them yield mixtures of the two isomers in relatively high 6 p/6 a ratios. It follows that the conversion of isomer 6 (3 into isomer 6a or repeated purifications are required to obtain the pharmacologically active isomer only.<br>
By way of example, US patent 2,961,441 discloses the preparation of 6 p-fluoro-3-keto-A4-pregnenes by fluorination of the corresponding 3-enol esters with perchloryl fluoride, in an inert organic solvent and in the presence of a catalyst. In particular, said patent describes the fluorination on 3,17 a,21-triacetoxy derivative. The process yields 6 (3-fluoro substituted compounds, which are converted into the corresponding 6 a isomers by methods known in the art.<br>
US patent 3,980,778 describes the preparation of the 6 a,9 a-difluoro pregnane derivative of formula<br><br><br>
by fluorination, with perchloryl fluoride, of 3,17 a,21-trihydroxy-16 p-methylpregna-3,5,9-(11)-trien-20-one 3,17,21-triacetate, obtained by causing to react the corresponding 17a,21-dihydroxy-16 p-methylpregna-4,9(11)-diene-3,20-dione 21 acetate with isopropenyl acetate.<br>
Said process yields a 6 p/6 a isomeric mixture in which isomer 6 p predominates. It follows that, with a view to obtaining a pharmaceutically useful final product, the 6 p-fluorosteroid is to be converted into the corresponding 6 a-fluoro compound. In all aforementioned cases, the formation of 3-enol ester, necessary for the steroid activation at the 6-position, brings about the simultaneous acetylation of the hydroxy groups, if any, at 17 a- and 21 -positions.<br>
Said processes suffer from a number of disadvantages; for example they are not stereoselective and require the use of perchloryl fluoride as a fluorinating agent, '_. an esplosive and highly corrosive reagent that must be handled with special care and must be used with very long reaction times.<br>
The use of other fluorinating agents, such as for example Selectfluor®, Accufluor®!<br>
NFSi or Accufluor® NFTh, on the described substrates..yjelds mixtures with still<br>
more unfavourable 6 a:6 p ratios.	'<br>
Therefore, the need for a process for the preparation of 6 a-fluorosteroids, free from the disadvantages of the processes known in the art, is deeply felt. Summary<br>
It has surprisingly been found that a high stereoselectivity of the fluorination at the 6-position can be obtained by operating on substrates obtained in order that the 17 a-hydroxy group remains unreacted, and by using specific fluorinating agents. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of 6 a-fluorosteroids of formula (I)<br><br><br>
wherein R and R' are as defined above, and wherein said electrophilic fluorinating<br>
agent   is   selected   from   the   group   consisting   of  N-fluoro   N-chloromethyl<br>
triethylenediamine bis-tetrafluoroborate, 1-fluoro-4-hydroxy-1,4-diazabicyclo [2.2.2J<br>
octane-bis-tetrafluoroborate, and 1-fluoro-benzenesulfonamide.<br>
The characteristics and advantages of the process of the present invention will be<br>
apparent from the detailed description reported herein.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The fluorination reaction of the present invention is carried out on the compound of<br>
formula (III) using - as a fluorinating agent - an electrophilic fluorinating agent,<br>
selected from the group consisting of Selectfluor® (i.e. N-fluoro N-chloromethyl<br>
triethylenediamine bis-tetrafluoroborate), Accufluor® NFTh (i.e. 1-fluoro-4-hydroxy-<br><br>
1,4-diazabicycle [2.2.2] octane-bis-tetrafluoroborate), and Accufluor® NFSi (i.e. 1-<br>
fluoro-benzenesulfonamide), and preferably Selectfluor®.<br>
The reaction solvent used may be any solvent in which the fluorinating agent is<br>
soluble; for example, the reaction can be carried out in the presence of Accufluor®<br>
NFTh or Selectfluor® using dimethylformamide or acetonitrile as a solvent.<br>
The fluorination reaction of the present invention is typically carried out at a<br>
temperature ranging from -20°C to +50°C, and preferably from 0°C to 30°C.<br>
At the aforementioned fluorination conditions, the deprotection of the 3-ketonic<br>
function takes place simultaneously.<br>
The fluorine position in the compound of formula (I) obtained by fluorination<br>
definitely favours isomer 6 a since the 6 a:6 p ratio is higher than 90:10.<br>
The process of the invention may be used for example to prepare the compound<br><br>
The compound of formula (III), which is used as a substrate for the fluorination of the invention to obtain the compound of formula (I) wherein R' is an acetyl group, can be obtained, e.g. by a single treatment of the compound of formula ()|) with isopropenyl acetate, wherein the protection of the hydroxylic function at the 21-position and of the ketonic function at the 3-position takes place:<br><br><br>
wherein R is as defined above and Ac is an acetyl group.<br>
In said acetylation reaction, isopropenyl acetate may have the double function of<br>
reagent and sole reaction solvent; otherwise, the reaction may be carried out using<br>
isopropenyl acetate as reagent, with addition of a solvent.<br>
Other compounds of formula (III) in which R' is different from an acetyl group, used<br>
as substrates for the fluorination of the invention, can be obtained according to<br>
processes known in the art.<br>
Starting from the compound of formula (I), obtained as described above, it is<br>
possible to obtain the corresponding compounds of formula (I') by processes<br><br>
R2 is chosen from H, OH and a carboxyalkyl group with from 1 to 4 carbon atoms;<br><br>
X is chosen from H, F, CI and Br; and where a double bond may be present<br>
between positions 1 e 2.<br>
