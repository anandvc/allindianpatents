Synthesis of amines and Intermediates for the synthesis thereof<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a novel process (= method) for the manufacture of derivatives, especially precursors, of tryptamine, horsfiline or coerulescine, novel partial reactions and novel intermediates. The derivatives or precursors of tryptamine, horsfiline and coerulescine are useful e.g. in the pharmaceutical area.<br>
Background of the Invention Derivatives of tryptamine 1<br><br>
have been synthesized from substituted anilines. Some pertinent anilines are prepared from 4-nitro benzyl chloride (precursors for anti migraine Pharmaceuticals such as Sumatriptan 2 see: DE 3,320,521, US 4,816,470, Almotriptan 3 see: Res. Disci. 1998, 412, 1088, Rizatriptan 4 see: EP 0497512A2) or Zolmitriptan 5 from 4-nitro phenyl alanine see: WO 91/18897.<br><br>
Scheme 1 Synthesis of aniline precursors for tryptamine derivatives (R = the para-substituents of the aniline moiety in 3, 4, 5 or 6)<br><br>
A variety of strategies have been disclosed for the conversion of the anilines 2, 3, 4 or 5 into the related tryptamine derivative 1. In the most common approach (scheme 2), the aniline A is converted into the corresponding phenyl hydrazine B. This is then reacted with a 4-halogeno-butyraldehyde derivative C (e.g. the dimethyl acetal (see: US 4,816,470) or the sodium sulfite addition product (see: EP 462 837 A2 or US 5,103,020)) or with a derivative of 4-amino butyraldehyde to give tryptamine D. Methylation of the amine of D provides the corresponding drug H. Alternatively, aniline A may be converted into indole E. A variety of pathways for the subsequent conversion of E into H is disclosed in US 5,037,845.<br><br>
Scheme 2. Synthesis of tryptanes from their aniline precursors<br>
One important problem regarding these approaches is the conversion of aniline A into phenyl hydrazine B. The reduction of the diazonium salt derived from A has been performed using tin(ll)chloride in a three to five-fold excess. A range of environmentally more suitable reducing agents has been identified, and is claimed in patent application WO 01/34561.<br>
For a detailed account of problems in the preparation of the phenyl hydrazine that is derived from 2 and its transformation into Sumatriptan see: Heterocycles 1998, 48, 1139. Similar problems can be expected for phenyl hydrazines that are derived from anilines 3, 4, and 5,<br><br>
Thus, the use of a-keto-(_)-valerolactone as the carbonyl component for the Fischer-cyclisation has been suggested as an alternative, see: SK 280586B (Applicant: QUMICA SINT S A (ES); VITA INVEST, Publication date 2000-4-10).<br><br>
Scheme 3: Alternative Carbonyl compounds for the Fischer cyclisation<br>
A quite different approach to synthesize Sumatriptan also requires aniline 2, but the preparation of the phenyl hydrazine is avoided, see: Heterocycles 2000, 53, 665. Here, the diazonium salt from 2 is reacted with a p-ketocarboxylic acid ester, and the formed hydrazone is cyclised to the indole 2-carboxylic acid which is decarboxylated to a derivative of1.<br><br>
Scheme 4: Alternative to the preparation of a phenyl hydrazone (synthesis of the N,N-dimethylpropyl-malonic acid ethyl ester is inconvenient)<br>
A major problem of the Fischer indolisation is that frequently only low yields of the indole are obtained due to the lack of stability of the product under the rather strongly acidic reaction conditions. Moreover, a problem of the Grandberg indolisation is that the reductive di-methylation of the primarily formed tryptamine in an alternative way is prone to low yields as side reactions such as formation of carbazoles and methylation of the indole nitrogen can take place. A solution to both of these problems is provided by using a derivative of N,N-dimethyl-4-aminobutyraldehyde in a modified Fischer indolisation protocol, see: J. Org. Chem. 1994, 59,3738.<br>
In all synthesis variants for derivatives of tryptamine 1 presented so far, the nature of the final product is determined early at the aniline stage. The final product is then obtained through the identical steps of hydrazine synthesis and Fischer indole cyclisation with all the<br><br>
described limitations. The present invention describes a route to late common intermediates for the synthesis of derivatives of tryptamine such as 1 which avoids both the synthesis of phenyl hydrazones and variations of the Fischer indolisation.<br>
The reaction of isatin (or a derivative) with malonic acid in acetic acid, either in the presence or absence of sodium acetate, furnishes the quinolone carboxylic acid 6 instead of the expected product 7, see J. Chem. Soc. 1926, 2902 and Chem. Ben 1914, 47, 354.<br><br>
However, compounds such as 7 are known, and have been prepared for example by reacting isatin or a derivative of it with the Reformatzky reagent of a derivative of bromo acetic acid, see Chem. Ber. 1962, 95, 1138 or Tetrahedron 1967, 23, 901 or with a 15-fold excess of the lithium enolate of tert-butyl acetate, see J. Org. Chem. 1988, 53, 2844. Derivatives of 7 also have been prepared by the condensation of an isatin with methyl acetimidate and subsequent hydrolysis, see Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1967, 701, 139 or by the oxidation of the enolate of a 3-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-oxo-2,3<lihydro-1h-indol-5-yl derivative with davies reagent see heterocycles></lihydro-1h-indol-5-yl>
Analogues of 7 have been obtained when a derivative of isatin wherein R2 is a substituted hydrogen or ethyl was reacted with malonic acid in pyridine (see Garden et al., Tetrahedron 58, 8399-8412 (2002)). In this case the pyridinium salt 8 was obtained, from which the corresponding acid 9 was obtained simply by acidification with hydrochloric acid.<br><br><br>
9 was then transformed into the corresponding ester in the presence of methanol and the ester then reduced with sodium borohydride to yield the corresponding tryptophol 9a:<br><br>
However, it was observed that when R2 is hydrogen (non-N-alkylated isatin) the corresponding esterification does not work. Therefore an alternative procedure employing the potassium salt of the mono-ethyl malonyl ester with 7-ethylisation in a mixture of pyridine, acetic acid and ethanol under reflux was used which gave the corresponding ester that could then be reduced.<br>
General description of the invention<br>
It has now been found surprisingly that when a compound such as 8 is reacted with an appropriate nitrogen base, especially a tertiary amine, such as triethyl amine (given in scheme 7 as an example only), it becomes sufficiently nucleophilic to react either with an active carbonic ester such as 10 (wherein R' is, for example, lower alkyl) or an active amide such as chloro amido carbonic acid derivative 12 (wherein R3and R4 are unsubstituted or substituted alkyl or together form a lower alkylene bridge) to give an ester such as 11 or an N,N-disubstituted alkylamide derivative such as 13 of 9. Very advantageously and surprisingly, the condensation step can conveniently be combined with the derivatisation step, which allows to obtain esters 11 or especially amides 13 of 9 in a one pot reaction. In this context triethylamine cannot be used for the addition reaction of malonic acid to isatin. (In formulae 11 and 13 and their precursors in brackets, R1 represents one or more substitutents and R2 a nitrogen substituent).<br><br><br>
Compounds such as 9, 11 or 13 are also valuable starting mateR1als for further unprecedented conversion reactions into vaR1ous deR1vatives or precursors of tryptamine 1 which are descR1bed in more detail below.<br>
Detailed descR1ption of the invention<br>

wherein X is halogen and R3 and R4 are as defined under formula II, to give the corresponding compound of the formula II.<br>
Further to the above definitions, R1 may also be unsubstituted or substituted cycloalkyl, alkanoyloxy, carboxhydrazido, N-mono- or N,N-disubstituted or unsubstituted amino, unsubstituted or substituted hydrazino, or a residue of a boronic acid or an ester thereof.<br>

In an especially preferred method, NB is a tR1-lower alkylamine, especially tR1ethylamine.The compound of the formula III is preferably obtained by reaction of an isatine deR1vative of the formula VI,<br><br>
wherein n, R1 and R2 have the meanings given under formula I, with malonic acid in the presence of a pyR1dine, especially pyR1dine and/or one or more picolines, in the absence or presence of a N,N-di-(lower alkyl)-lower alkanoylamide, a lower alkanol, e.g. methanol or ethanol, or a di-lower alkylsulfoxide, e.g. dimethylsulfoxide, especially N,N-dimethyl formamide, advantageously in the presence of ethyl acetate as a cosolvens, followed by conversion into the salt of the base NB given in formula III<br>

In an alternative embodiment of the invention, a compound of the formula Xb as just descR1bed is obtained by hydrogenation of the benzylic 3-hydroxy group in a compound of the formula II as just defined.<br><br>
A compound of the formula Xb, e.g. as obtained in the above reactions, can surpR1singly be converted to a spiro oxindole of the formula XI by reaction with formaldehyde or a precursor thereof (e.g. paraformaldehyde):<br>

When the temperature of the mixture reaches 60°C, the bromo isatin starts to dissolve, and a deep red mixture forms. Carbon dioxide starts to evolve, and after about 45 minutes the precipitation of the intermediate pyR1dinium (5-bromo-3-hydroxy-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-3-yl)-acetate starts. The reaction mixture is kept at 80°C for another 3 hours. Then tR1ethyl amine (49.2g, 0.486 mol) iss added, and the pyR1dinium salt dissolves to give a deep brown solution. This solution is allowed to cool to 50°C, and then a solution of dimethyl carbamoyl chloR1de (48 g, 0.442 mol, CAUTION: carcinogen) in 40 g of ethyl acetate is added dropwise duR1ng 30 minutes. Carbon dioxide evolves, and the temperature R1ses to 60°C. After about 45 minutes, the product starts to precipitate from the reaction mixture. The mixture is kept at 60°C for another hour, and then water (500 mL) and 36% HCI (250 mL, 4 mol) are added in that order duR1ng 10 minutes. The product is filtered off, and reslurR1ed in an mixture of acetone/water (500 mL, 1:1, v:v).

The obtained suspension is cooled with an ice bath, and then BF3-etherate (28.3 g, 0.2 mol) is added while the inner temperature is maintained at 20°C. This leads to the formation of a solution after a few minutes. The temperature is kept at 20°C, and 12.0 g of 95% borane dimethylsulfide complex (0.15 mol) is added dropwise duR1ng 10 minutes. The cooling bath is then removed, and the temperature of the mixture R1ses slowly, while a gas is formed. When the temperature reaches 48°C, the product starts to precipitate whilst the temperature continues to R1se until it reaches 58°C. After about 10 minutes the temperature starts to fall to ambient temperature. After 75 minutes, the reaction mixture is quenched with 100 mL of 4 N NaOH (no exothermic reaction), and then the obtained olive green suspension is heated under reflux for 30 minutes. After cooling to ambient temperature, the mixture is filtered, and most of the DME is removed from the filtrate by rotary evaporation (rotavapor). To the residue, acetone (about 100 mL) is added, and the product is allowed to crystallize at 4°C for 30 minutes. The crude product is filtered off and washed with little acetone and pentane to give 22.2 g of beige crystals. These are puR1fied by crystallization from methanol/NoR1te (activated charcoal) (385 mL, 2.2 g) to give 16.2 g of colorless crystals.

After disposal of the inorganic the combined toluene layers are extracted for three times with water (300mL, 2 x 150 mL), and the aqueous layer is again discarded. The toluene layer is then extracted twice with 4N HCI (100mL and 50 mL). DuR1ng the combined acidic extracts, the pH is then adjusted to 14 by the addition of 4 N NaOH. Then the aqueous layer is extracted twice with tert-butyl methyl ether TBME (150 mL and 50 mL), and the combined extracts are washed with bR1ne (50 mL) and then transferred into a 500 mL flask. To the stirred TBME solution, MnO2 (34.8 g, 0.4 mol) is then added, and temporaR1ly the temperature R1ses to 40°C. After one hour the aniline by-product has been converted completely, and then the MnO2 is filtered off.

Example 6: 2-(3-Hydroxy-5-iodo-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1M-indol-3-yl)-N,N-dimethyl-acetamide <br>
A 2 L flask with mechanical stirrer is charged with 5-iodo-isatin (78.1 g, 0.286 mol), malonic acid (35.7 g, 0.343 mol), and pyR1dine (90.4 g, 1.144 mol). The mixture is heated to 80°C. When most of the isatine has dissolved, ethyl acetate (100 mL) is added to prevent blocking<br><br>
of the stirrer by the precipitating pyR1dinium (3-hydroxy-5-iodo-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-3-yl)-acetate. After 1 hour, precipitation of the latter salt starts, and when the mixture has been kept stirR1ng for another 2 hours, a suspension of the salt in an orange solution has formed. To this is added tR1ethyl amine (43.3g, 0.429 mol), and the salt dissolves to give a dark solution. Then a solution of dimethyl carbamoyl chloR1de (40 g, 0.372 mol) in ethyl acetate (50 mL) is added dropwise duR1ng 20 minutes. A solid starts to precipitate, and the mixture is stirred for another 2 hours at 80°C. Then 4 N HCI is added (350 mL), and stirR1ng is continued for 30 additional minutes in order to hydrolyze any excess carbamoyl chloR1de. The mixture is then filtered, and the filter cake is washed with 50% ethanol and the with water.

Example   7:   Preparation   of     [2-(5-lodo-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethyl]-dimethyl-amine: <br>
A 3 L flask is charged with 2-(5-iodo-3-hydroxy-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-3-yl)-A/,/V-dimethyl-acetamide (Example 6) (100 g, 0.277 mol), and 800 mL of DME. The supension is cooled to -15°C, and sodium borohydR1de (31.5 g 96%, 0.832 mol) is added to this mixture, which causes a raise of the temperature by 5°C. To this, BF3-etherate is added dropwise duR1ng 30 minutes (157.6 g, 1.11 mol). Initially there is a strong exothermic reaction (requires slow addition of BF3-etherate) and evolution of a gas. The temperatureis maintained between -15 and -10°C duR1ng the addition. The formed orange slurry is then allowed to warm slowly to ambient temperature (25-27°C), and left stirR1ng over night (17 h). To this mixture, then 4N NaOH (555 mL) is added and the mixture is heated under reflux for 50 minutes. Then DABCO (34.3g) is added, and refluxing the mixture is continued for two additional hours. Then water (250 mL) is added, and the DME is removed on the rotavapor. The obtained orange slurry is then extracted with TBME (1000 mL, 2x 600 mL), and the combined organic layers are washed with water (800 mL) and bR1ne (700 mL), and<br><br>
concentrated on the rotavapor to about 600 mL To the stirred residue, MnO2 (72.4 g), is added, and the exothermic oxidation causes a temperature R1se of 20°C. StirR1ng is continued for one hour, and then the MnO2 is filtered off. Removal of the solvent from the filtrate gives a brown oil, which is dissolved in toluene. The toluene is extracted for three times with 4 N HCI (300 mL, 2 x 150 mL). After adjustment of the pH of the combined aqueous layers to about 10, the product is re-extracted with TBME (3 x 700 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with water (500 mL), and bR1ne (500 mL), and after almost complete removal of the solvent on the rotavapor and standing over night at 4°C some of the product crystallizes (39g, 44.7%). Further concentration of the mother liquors and standing for two additional days gives another crop of the title product (9.5 g, 10.9%), while still about 20 g of mateR1al (about 22%) remains in the mother liquors. 1H-NMR (CDCI3, 300 MHz): 5 2.34 (s, 6 H, NMe2); 2.59-2.66 (m, 2 H, CH2NMe2); 2.85-2.92 (m, 2 H, ArCH2); 6.90 (d, 1 H, 3J = 2.2 Hz, H-2); 7.03 (d, 1 H, 3J = 8.4 Hz, H-7); 7.38 (dd, 1 H, 4J = 1.3 Hz, H-6); 7.91 (d, 1 H, H-4); 8.56 (br s, 1 H, NH). 13C-NMR (CDCI3-D6, 75 MHz) 5 23.71 (ArCH2); 45.65 (N(CH3)2); 60.32 (CH2NMe2); 82.77 (C-5); 113.36 (C-6); 113.86 (C-3); 122.78 (C-2); 127.87 (C-4); 130.29 (C-7); 130.33 (C-8); 135.62 (C-9).<br>

To a solution of [2-(5-iodo-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethyl]-dimethyl-amine (Example 7) (35.0 g, 111.4 mmol) in DMF (250 mL), sodium hydR1de is added (2.81 g, 117 mmol) at RT in portions duR1ng 15 minutes. The mixture is then stirred for another 15 minutes, and then cooled to 4°C. A solution of benzyl chloR1de (14.1 g, 111.4 mmol) in DMF (50 mL) is added duR1ng 20 minutes, and the temperature is maintained duR1ng 4 to 8°C. The mixture is left stirR1ng over night, and then most of the solvent is removed on the rotavapor. To the residue is added water (500 mL), and the product is extracted with TBME (2 x 250 mL). The organic layer is washed with bR1ne (2 x 250 mL), and after removal of the solvent, 28.5 g of a brown oil is obtained. This is dissolved in ethyl acetate (500 mL) and the product is extracted with 4 N Hcl (550 mL). The product is liberated by adding 30% NaOH to the aqueous layer (300 mL), and re-extracted into ethyl acetate (500 mL). The organic layer is washed with bR1ne (2 x<br><br>
250 mL), and the solvent removed to leave 20.2 g of a brown oil which is crystallized from di-isopropyl ether and pentane to give the title product (17.3 g, 38%). Concentrating the aqueous layer of the first gives a precipitate (18.8 g) which is recrystallized from ethyl acetate (250 mL) to give 12.3 g of the N-benzyl ammonium chloR1de of the target.<br>

Under cooling with an ice bath, borane dimethyl sulfide complex (12.0 g, 0.15 mol) is added duR1ng 10 minutes, and then the cooling bath is removed. The temperature R1ses slowly to 55°C, and a suspension forms at about 50°C. When the exothermic reaction has subsided, the mixture is stirred at 75°C for another 30 minutes, and then quenched by adding 4 N NaOH (100 mL). The mixture is heated under reflux for another 30 minutes, and then filtered while still hot. Removal of the solvent on the rotavapor leads to crystallization of the product, which goes to completion on standing in the refR1gerator for 12 hours. The product is filtered off, washed with cold acetone (50 mL, -20°C) and pentane, and dR1ed to give the title product (24.8 g, 75%) as crystals, mp. = 195-200°C. 1H-NMR (DMSO-D6, 300 MHz) 8 2.80, 2.99 (2 s, 3 H each, N(CH3)2); 3.69 (s, 2 H, CH2); 7.19 (d, 1 H, 3J = 2.4Hz, H-2); 7.21 (d, 1 H, 3J = 8.5 Hz, H-7); 7.32 (dd, 1H,4J = 1.7 Hz, H-6); 7.92 (d, 1 H, H-4); 11.04 (br s, 1 H, NH). 13ONMR (DMSO-D6, 75 MHz) 8 31.11 (CH2); 35.70, 37.91 (N(CH3)3); 82.82 (C-5); 108.54 (C-3); 114.51 (C-7); 125.46 (C-2); 128.16 (CM); 129.54 (C-6); 130.85 (C-9); 135.91 (C-8).<br><br>

To a solution of 2-(5-lodo-1H-indol-3-yl)-/VIW-dimethyl"acetamide (24.7g, 75.4 mmol) in DMF (90 mL), under an inert atmosphere sodium hydR1de (1.91 g 95%, 75.4 mmol) is added which leads to the formation of a pale yellow solution. When the evolution of hydrogen has ceased, benzyl chloR1de (9.54 g, 75.4 mmol) is added in three portions over a peR1od of 10 minutes. The mixture warms to 60°C, and after stirR1ng for one hour a suspension forms. On the rotavapor, a part of the DMF (about 80mL) is removed, which leads to crystallization of the product.
