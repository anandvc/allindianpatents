				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Process for manufacturing disulfonic acid compound,<br>
asymmetric Mannich catalyst, process for manufacturing β-aminocarbonyl derivative, and novel disulfonate<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]   The present invention relates to a process for manufacturing a disulfonic acid compound, an asymmetric Mannich catalyst, a process for manufacturing a β-aminocarbonyl derivative, and a novel disulfonate. Background Art<br>
[0002]   It has been known that 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-disulfonic acid is useful.  For example, Patent Document 1 discloses that it can be used as an agent for introducing an asymmetric auxiliary group to an optically active amine. According to the document, when disulfonyl chloride derived from (S)-1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-disulfonic acid with thionyl chloride was allowed to react with racemic 1-phenylethylamine dissolved in acetonitrile, the NMR analysis of the reaction product, that is, a mixture of diastereoisomers of N-(1-phenylethyl)-1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-disulfonic acid amides, showed nonequivalent peaks derived from the proton at the α-position of the phenyl group of the amide portion of each diastereoisomer.  Patent Document 1 describes a process for producing 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-<br>
disulfonic acid in which a compound having SC(=0)NR2 bonded to the 2- and 2'-positions of 1,1'-dinaphthyl is allowed to react with N-bromosuccinimide in the presence of a tertiary alcohol to derived a compound having -S02Br bonded to the 2-and 2'-positions, followed by hydrolysis.<br>
[0003]   It has been known that a β-aminocarbonyl derivative is produced by a Mannich reaction of an aldimine compound and a carbonyl compound.  β-Aminocarbonyl derivatives are used in a variety of fields including the fields of pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals. A process has recently been proposed for producing an optically active β-aminocarbonyl derivative with a high enantiomeric excess (ee) by a Mannich reaction using an optically active phosphoric acid derivative derived from 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-diol as a catalyst (see Non-Patent Document 1). More specifically, when the phosphoric acid derivative has unsubstituted naphthalene rings, the reaction product, optically active β-aminocarbonyl derivative, exhibits an enantiomeric excess as low as 12% ee.  On the other hand, when the naphthalene rings of the phosphoric acid derivative have phenyl groups at the 3- and 3'-positions, the enantiomeric excess is increased to 56% ee. Also, when the phosphoric acid derivative has biphenyl groups at the 3- and 3'-positions, and when the phosphoric acid derivative has 4-(P-naphthyl)phenyl groups at the 3- and 3'-positions, the enantiomeric excesses are as high as 90% ee and 95% ee,<br>
respectively.<br>
Patent Document 1:  JP 2005-132815 A<br>
Non-Patent Document 1:  J. Am. Chem. Soc., vol. 126 (2004),<br>
No. 17, pp. 5356-5357<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
[0004]   Although Patent Document 1 describes a process for producing 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-disulfonic acid, this process includes bromination, and is accordingly not necessarily advantageous.  In addition, Patent Document 1 does not describe details of the process, such as the amounts of the reagents used for the reaction, the reaction conditions and the yield.  It is therefore not easy for even those skilled in the art to replicate the same process.<br>
[0005]   There are not many known models of the synthesis of disulfonic acid by oxidizing dithiol in general organic synthesis.  Possible oxidation reactions include, for example, chromic acid oxidation, periodic acid oxidation, iodine oxidation, oxidation using an aqueous solution of Oxone (trade name of a product available from Du Pont) (2KHS05-K2S04-KHS04) .  However, the inventors of the present invention do not know any successful model of disulfonic acid synthesis by those oxidation reactions of dithiol.  It has been reported about oxidation of dithiol that, for example, disulfide was produced with an yield of 90% by oxidizing dithiol with iodine (J. Org. Chem., vol. 58, pp.<br>
1748-1750 (1993)).  It has also been reported that monothiol was converted to monosulfonic acid by oxygen oxidation, and this reaction produced disulfide as a by-product (Tetrahedron, vol. 21, pp. 2271-2280 (1965)).  The above cases seems to suggest that when thiol groups are present at the sterically adjacent 2- and 2'-positions of a binaphthyl skeleton as in 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-dithiol, there is a high possibility that the two sulfur atoms at the 2- and 2'-positions are bonded to each other to form an intramolecular disulfide by oxidation.  The present inventors attempted the oxidations of 1,1'-binaphthyl 2,2'-dithiol with chromic acid, periodic acid, and Oxone in practice.  However, these oxidations hardly produced disulfonic acid.  The present inventors assume that one of the reasons is the by-production of an intramolecular disulfide, but this has not been confirmed.<br>
[0006]   When a phosphoric acid derivative disclosed in the above-cited Non-Patent Document 1 is used as a catalyst of Mannich reaction, tuning may be performed to find the most suitable catalyst for the substrate (aldimine compound or carbonyl compound) of the Mannich reaction.  For this tuning, many compounds must be tested by introducing various substituents to the 3- and 3'-positions of the naphthalene rings of the phosphoric acid derivative.  Unfortunately, such introduction of substituents is not easy, and tuning is difficult accordingly.<br>
[0007]   The present invention is intended to solve the above issues. An object of the present invention is to produce an axially asymmetric, optically active l,l'-biaryl-2,2'-disulfonic acid compound with a high yield. Another object of the invention is to provide an asymmetric Mannich<br>
catalyst that can produce an optically active β-aminocarbonyl derivative with a high enantiomeric excess, and that facilitates the tuning for the substrate, and a process for manufacturing a β-aminocarbonyl derivative using the same.<br>
[0008]    The present inventors added hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) to a reaction vessel containing optically active 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-dithiol and potassium hydroxide, and performed oxidation with pressurized oxygen to produce the potassium salt of the corresponding disulfonic acid with a high yield.  Thus, the inventors accomplished the invention. In the process for manufacturing a disulfonic acid compound according to the present invention, an axially asymmetric, optically active 1,1'-biaryl-2,2'-dithiol compound is oxidized with pressurized oxygen in the presence of a strong base to produce a salt of a corresponding optically active disulfonic acid compound.<br>
[0009]   According to the manufacturing process of disulfonic acid compound of the present invention, an optically active 1,1'-biaryl-2,2'-dithiol compound is oxidized with environmentally friendly oxygen.  This process<br>
can produce a salt of 1,1'-diaryl-2,2'-disulfonic acid compound with a high yield while maintaining the optical activity.  The resulting salt is purified, for example, through a column, and then quantitatively converted to a free form of the disulfonic acid compound through a cation exchange resin.  The thus obtained disulfonic acid compound can be used in a variety of applications.  For example, the disulfonic acid compound can be used as an agent for introducing an asymmetric auxiliary group to an optically active amine, as disclosed in Patent Document 1, or it may be converted to the ammonium salt to use as an asymmetric Mannich catalyst, as described later in Examples.<br>
[0010]   Furthermore, the present inventors found that an optically active β-amino-α-acylcarbonyl derivative can be produced with a high enantiomeric excess by a Mannich reaction between benzaldehyde imine whose nitrogen is protected and acetyl acetone in the presence of the mixture of optically active 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-disulfonic acid and 2,6-diphenylpyridine in a molar ratio of 1:2, and thus accomplished the present invention.  The asymmetric Mannich catalyst of the present invention is a mixture of an optically active 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-disulfonic acid compound and 2,6-disubstituted pyridine (substituent is aryl or branched alkyl) in a molar ratio of 1:0.75 to 1:3.<br>
[0011]    In a process for manufacturing a β-aminocarbonyl derivative according to the present invention, an aldimine<br>
compound expressed by Ar-CH=NR1 (Ar represents aryl, R' represents tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), benzyloxycarbonyl<br>
(Cbz) or 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl (Troc)) and a carbonyl compound are subjected to a Mannich reaction in the presence of the asymmetric Mannich catalyst to yield an optically active P-aminocarbonyl derivative.<br>
[0012]   A novel disulfonate according to the present invention is a salt of an optically active 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-disulfonic acid compound and 2,6-disubstituted pyridine<br>
(substituent is aryl or branched alkyl).<br>
[0013]   The use of the asymmetric Mannich catalyst of the present invention allows an asymmetric Mannich reaction to produce an optically active P-aminocarbonyl derivative with a high enantiomeric excess.  The use of the catalyst allows easy tuning for the aldimine compound and the carbonyl compound, which are reaction substrates. More specifically, since catalysts having various structures can be obtained by merely mixing an optically active 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-disulfonic acid compound and various types of 2,6-disubstituted pyridine, catalysts having different structures can be prepared more easily than catalysts having various structures produced by introducing substituents to the naphthalene rings as in Non-Patent Document 1. Accordingly, the tuning can be facilitated which is performed to determine which structure the catalyst can have is suitable for the reaction substrate.  This is a great<br>
advantage from an industrial viewpoint.<br>
Brief Description of Drawings<br>
[0014]   Fig. 1 shows the results of X-ray analysis of potassium 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-disulfonate.<br>
Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention [0015]    [Process for manufacturing a disulfonic acid compound]<br>
The optically active 1,1'-biaryl-2,2'-dithiol compound used in a process for manufacturing a disulfonic acid compound of the present invention may be in the R-form or the S-form according to the stereochemistry of axially asymmetric 1,1'-biaryls.  In the present embodiment, an (R)-1,1'-biaryl-2,2'-dithiol compound may be used, or an (S)-1,1'-biaryl-2,2'-dithiol compound may be used.  The biaryl of the 1,1'-biaryl-2,2'-dithiol compound has an aromatic hydrocarbon ring skeleton, and such biaryls include, for example, biphenyl, binaphthyl and biphenanthryl. Among those, preferred is binaphthyl. The biaryl may or may not be substituted.  If the biaryl is substituted, for example, a substituent may be present at at least one of the 3-, 3'-, 6- and 6'-positions.<br>
[0016]   Preferably, the strong base used in the manufacturing process of the disulfonic acid compound of the present invention is, but not limited to, an alkali metal<br>
hydroxide, such as potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide. The strong base is preferably used in a proportion of more than 2 equivalents to the dithiol compound, more preferably 3 equivalents or more, and still more preferably 6 equivalents or more from the viewpoint of stably producing a disulfonate with a high repeatability with a high yield. Although the upper limit of the amount of the strong base to be used is not particularly limited, it is preferably 10 equivalents or less from an economical viewpoint.<br>
[0017]   The pressurized oxygen used in the manufacturing process of the disulfonic acid compound of the present invention is preferably, but not limited to, oxygen pressurized to 5 atmospheres or more from the viewpoint of stably producing a disulfonate with a high repeatability with a high yield.  Oxygen pressurized to 7 atmospheres or more is particularly preferred.  The use of such oxygen further increases the yield.  The upper limit of the pressure of the pressurized oxygen is not particularly limited, but is preferably 20 atmospheres or less, more preferably 10 atmospheres or less, in view of safety and economy.<br>
[0018]   The manufacturing process of the disulfonic acid compound of the present invention may use a reaction solvent, if necessary.  Polar aprotic solvents are preferably used. Exemplary polar aprotic solvents include phosphoric acid amide solvents such as hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA),<br>
carboxylic acid amide solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide, and tetraalkyl urea solvents such as 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, and HMPA is preferred.<br>
[0019]   The manufacturing process of the disulfonic acid compound of the present invention does not limit the reaction temperature.  However, if the reaction temperature is too low, the oxidation reaction can become too slow, and if the reaction temperature is too high, a large amount of by-product can be produced. Accordingly, the reaction temperature is preferably set in the range of 50 to 100°C. The reaction time can be set to a period until the dithiol compound is consumed, or a period until the reaction stops, and it is set, in general, in the range of several hours to several days.<br>
[0020]   In the manufacturing process of the disulfonic acid compound of the present invention, the salt of the disulfonic acid compound prepared by oxidizing l,l'-biaryl-2,2'-dithiol compound may be converted into a free form of the disulfonic acid compound through a cation exchange resin after purification through a column.  For example, silica gel can be used as the column.  The eluent for the column can be, for example, chloroform or methanol.  For example, Amberlite (Rohm &amp; Haas) can be used as the cation exchange resin, and water or methanol can be used as the eluent for the cation exchange resin.<br>
[0021]    [Asymmetric Mannich Catalyst]<br>
The optically active 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-disulfonic acid compound used for the asymmetric Mannich catalyst of the present invention may be in the R-form or the S-form according to the stereochemistry of axially asymmetric 1,1'-binaphthyls (having a chiral axis).  In the present embodiment, (R)-1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-disulfonic acid may be used, or (S)-1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-disulfonic acid may be used.  The naphthalene rings of these compounds may or may not be substituted.  The optically active 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-disulfonic acid compound can be produced using, for example, optically active 1,1'-binaphthol as the starting material by converting its diol portion to dithiol, and then oxidizing the dithiol to disulfonic acid.  Oxidizing agents containing a heavy metal, such as potassium dichromate can promote the oxidation of dithiol.  However, such oxidizing agents have a high environmental load and a problem with waste disposal, and are accordingly not suitable.  The present inventors attempted to oxidize the dithiol with generally used various oxidizing agents. As a result, most reactions did not proceed or many products were obtained except for the case of air oxidation (02 oxidation) .  The products could not be isolated. Accordingly, it is preferable that the dithiol be converted to disulfonic acid by air oxidation. Although the naphthalene rings of 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-disulfonic acid may be substituted, it is preferable not substituted from the viewpoint of producing a<br>
catalyst having a structure as simple as possible.<br>
[0022]    The 2,6-disubstituted pyridine used for the asymmetric Mannich catalyst of the present invention has substituents at the 2- and 6-positions of pyridine.  The substituent may be aryl or branched alkyl.  The aryl group may be an unsubstituted aromatic hydrocarbon group, such as phenyl, naphthyl, phenanthryl or anthranil, or may have a substituent on the ring of the aromatic hydrocarbon group. Examples of the substituents on the ring of the aromatic hydrocarbon group include alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, and alkoxy.  Exemplary alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, and tert-butyl.  Exemplary alkenyl groups include vinyl, allyl, butenyl, and styryl.  Exemplary cycloalkyl groups include cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl.  Exemplary aryl groups include phenyl, biphenyl, naphthyl, binaphthyl, and anthryl.<br>
[0023]    Examples of 2,6-disubstituted pyridine whose<br>
substituents are aryl (2,6-diarylpyridine) include 2,6-<br>
diphenylpyridine; 2,6-di(4-alkylphenyl)pyridines, such as<br>
2,6-di(4-methylphenyl)pyridine, 2,6-di(4-<br>
ethylphenyl)pyridine, 2,6-di(4-n-propylphenyl)pyridine, 2,6-<br>
di(4-isopropylphenyl)pyridine, 2,6-di(4-n-<br>
butylphenyl)pyridine, and 2,6-di(4-tert-<br>
butylphenyl)pyridine ; 2,6-di(4-arylphenyl)pyridines, such<br>
as 2,6-di(4-phenylphenyl)pyridine; 2,6-di(4-<br>
alkoxyphenyl)pyridines, such as 2,6-di(4-<br>
methoxyphenyl)pyridine and 2,6-di(4-ethoxyphenyl)pyridine;<br>
2,6-di(3-alkylphenyl)pyridines, such as 2,6-di(3-<br>
methylphenyl)pyridine, 2,6-di(3-ethylphenyl)pyridine, 2,6-<br>
di(3-n-propylphenyl)pyridine, 2,6-di(3 -<br>
isopropylphenyl)pyridine, 2,6-di(3-n-propylphenyl)pyridine,<br>
2,6-di(3 tert-butylphenyl)pyridine; 2,6-di(3-<br>
arylphenyl)pyridines, such as 2,6-di(3-<br>
phenylphenyl)pyridine; 2,6-di(3-alkoxyphenyl)pyridines, such<br>
as 2,6-di(3-methoxyphenyl)pyridine and 2,6-di(3-<br>
ethoxyphenyl)pyridine; 2,6-di(2-alkylphenyl)pyridines, such<br>
as 2,6-di(2-methylphenyl)pyridine, 2,6-di(2-<br>
ethylphenyl)pyridine, 2,6-di(2-n-propylphenyl)pyridine, 2,6-<br>
di(2-isopropylphenyl)pyridine, 2,6-di(2-n-<br>
butylphenyl)pyridine, and 2,6-di(2-tert-<br>
butylphenyl)pyridine; 2,6-di(2-arylphenyl)pyridines, such as<br>
2,6-di(2-phenylphenyl)pyridine; 2,6-di(2-<br>
alkoxyphenyl)pyridines, such as 2,6-di(2-<br>
methoxyphenyl) pyridine and 2 , 6-di (2 -ethoxyphenyl) pyridine ,-<br>
and 2,6-bis disubstituted phenylpyridines, such as 2,6-<br>
bis(3,4-dimethylphenyl)pyridine, 2,6-bis(3,4-<br>
diethylphenyl)pyridine, 2,6-bis(3,5-dimethylphenyl)pyridine,<br>
2,6-bis(3,5-diethylphenyl)pyridine, 2,6-bis(3,5-<br>
dimethoxyphenyl)pyridine, and 2,6-bis(3,5-<br>
diethoxyphenyl)pyridine.  Among those preferred are 2,6-<br>
diarylpyridines whose aryl groups at the 2- and 6- positions<br>
are phenyl, phenyl having alkyl (may be branched), or phenyl<br>
having phenyl.  The use of these compounds advantageously allows asymmetric Mannich reaction with relatively high yield and good enantiomeric excess.  Examples of 2,6-disubstituted pyridine whose substituents are branched alkyl groups include 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine, 2,6-di-sec-butylpyridine, 2,6-diisobutylpyridine, 2,6-diisopropylpyridine, and 2,6-di(2,4,6-mesityl)pyridine. [0024]   For the asymmetric Mannich catalyst of the present invention, the molar ratio of the 2,6-disubstituted pyridine to the optically active 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-disulfonic acid compound must be set in the range of 0.75 to 3.  If the molar ratio is less than 0.75, the enantiomeric excess of<br>
the optically active (i-aminocarbonyl derivative is undesirably reduced.  If the molar ratio is more than 3, the acidity is undesirably reduced to reduce the yield of β-aminocarbonyl derivative.  In order to increase both the<br>
yield and the enantiomeric excess of β-aminocarbonyl derivative, it is preferable that the molar ratio be set in the range of 1 to 2.5.<br>
[0025]    The asymmetric Mannich catalyst of the present invention may be provided in a mixture prepared by mixing an optically active 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-disulfonic acid compound and a 2,6-disubstituted pyridine in a solvent, or in a mixture prepared by evaporating the solvent from the liquid mixture.  For example, if the solvent of the mixture is the same as the solvent used for the asymmetric Mannich<br>
reaction, the asymmetric Mannich catalyst may be provided in the mixture containing the solvent.  If a different solvent from the solvent used for the asymmetric Mannich reaction is used, the solvent of the mixture may be evaporated and then another solvent for the asymmetric Mannich reaction may be added.  The solvent used for preparing the catalyst is not particularly limited as long as it can dissolve the 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-disulfonic acid compound and the 2,6-disubstituted pyridine.  Examples of such a solvent include nitriles such as acetonitrile, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, amides such as dimethylformamide, and aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene.<br>
[0026]    [Process for manufacturing P-aminocarbonyl derivative]<br>
The amount of asymmetric Mannich catalyst used in the process for manufacturing a β-aminocarbonyl derivative according to the present invention is preferably, but not limited to, 0.1 to 10 mol% relative to the reaction substrate, and more preferably 1 to 5 mol%.  If it is less than 0.1 mol%, the enantiomeric excess can be reduced undesirably.  If it is increased to more than 10 mol%, the yield and the enantiomeric excess are not greatly increased. Such a large amount is disadvantageous in view of economical efficiency.  However, some of the combinations of the reaction substrate and the asymmetric Mannich catalyst may<br>
produce good result even if the amount of asymmetric Mannich catalyst is outside such ranges.<br>
[0027]   The aldimine compound used in the manufacturing process of the β-aminocarbonyl derivative of the present invention is expressed by Ar-CH=NFT (Ar represents an aryl group, and R1 represents tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), or 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl<br>
(Troc)) .  The aryl group in the expression is a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic hydrocarbon group.  Exemplary aromatic hydrocarbon groups include phenyl, naphthyl, phenanthryl, and anthranil.  If the aromatic hydrocarbon group has a substituent, examples of the substituent include alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, and alkoxy.  Exemplary alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, and tert-butyl.  Exemplary alkenyl groups include vinyl, allyl, butenyl, and styryl. Exemplary cycloalkyl groups include cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl.  Exemplary aryl groups include phenyl, biphenyl, naphthyl, binaphthyl, and anthryl.  R1 acts as a protecting group.  If Boc is introduced as the protecting group, deprotection can be performed under highly acidic conditions, such as in trifluoroacetic acid or a hydrochloric acid-ethyl acetate solution.  If Cbz is used as the protecting group, deprotection can be performed by hydrogenation reaction using palladium as a catalyst, or by Birch reduction.  If Troc is used, deprotection can be performed by bringing zinc<br>
powder-acetic acid into a reaction.  If a benzoyl group is used as the protecting group, the enantiomeric excess is significantly reduced.  The carbonyl compound used in the manufacturing process of the P-aminocarbonyl derivative of the present invention is not particularly limited as long as it is a carbonyl compound having hydrogen at the a-position. Preferably, the carbonyl compound is 1,3-dicarbonyl compound, such as 1,3-diketone, 1,3-ketoester, or 1,3-ketoamide.  The 1,3-dicarbonyl compound may have cyclic ketone in its molecule.  The amount of carbonyl compound to be used, which may depend on the reaction conditions, is preferably 0.67 to 1.5 equivalents to the aldimine compound.<br>
[0028]   In the manufacturing process of the P-aminocarbonyl derivative of the present invention, the reaction solvent is preferably, but not limited to, a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent, a nitrile solvent, or a cyclic ether solvent. Exemplary halogenated hydrocarbon solvents include methylene chloride, 1,1-dichloroethane, and 1,2-dichloroethane. Exemplary nitrile solvents include acetonitrile and propionitrile.  Exemplary cyclic ether solvents include tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 1,4-dioxane.  Among those preferred are methylene chloride, acetonitrile and THF. [0029]    In the manufacturing process of the β-aminocarbonyl derivative of the present invention, the reaction temperature is preferably, but not limited to, -40 to 50°C, and more preferably 0 to 3 0°C.  The reaction time can be set<br>
to a period until the reaction substrate is consumed, or a period until the reaction stops, and it is set, in general, in the range of several minutes to several tens of hours.<br>
[0030]   In the manufacturing process of the P-aminocarbonyl derivative of the present invention, contamination of the reaction system with moisture can reduce the yield and the enantiomeric excess. Accordingly, it is preferably that the reaction is conducted in the presence of a desiccant. Examples of the desiccant include magnesium sulfate, sodium sulfate, and calcium sulfate.<br>

The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 minutes.  Then, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the reaction product was dried at 1 to 2 Torrs for 1 hour.  Subsequently, distilled CH2C12 (1.5 mL) was added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes.  The resulting solution was cooled to 0°C, and benzaldehyde imine whose nitrogen is protected with Cbz (compound 8) (59.8 mg, 0.25 mmol in 0.5 mL of CH2C12) and then acetyl acetone (27.5 mg, 0.275 mmol in 0.5 mL of CH2C12) were dropped into the solution over a period of 1 hour.  Then, the reaction mixture was further stirred at 0°C for 30 minutes. After confirming the completion of the reaction by TLC, saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogencarbonate (10 mL) was added, and the mixture was returned to room temperature. The organic phase was extracted from this solution with ethyl acetate (15 mL x 2) .  The extracted organic phase was rinsed with saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride<br>

The resulting concentrate was purified through a silica gel column chromatography (hexane/ethyl acetate = 3/1) to obtain a β-aminocarbonyl derivative (compound 9) shown in Chemical Formula 3 with an yield of 74%.

the equivalent n of 2,6-diphenylpyridine was set as shown in Table 1 for the asymmetric Mannich reactions of Comparative Examples B-l to B-3 and Examples B-6 to B-10.  The results are shown in Table 1 (Table 1 includes the results of Example B-3).  Table 1 clearly shows that when only 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-disulfonic acid was used (Comparative Example B-l) and when the equivalent n was set to 0.2 5 or 0.5 (Comparative Examples B-2 and B-3), the P-aminocarbonyl derivative could be produced with a high yield, but the enantiomeric excess was extremely low.  On the other hand, when the equivalent n was set in the range of 0.75 to 3<br>
(Examples B-3 and B-6 to B-10) , the β-aminocarbonyl derivative was obtained with a high yield and a high enantiomeric excess.  When the equivalent n was 3 (Example B-10), however, the yield tended to be reduced.  This is probably because the acidity was reduced due to the excessive amount of amine (2,6-diphenylpyridine).
