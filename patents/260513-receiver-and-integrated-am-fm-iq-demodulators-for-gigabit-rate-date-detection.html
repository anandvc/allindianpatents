				<td>RECEIVER AND INTEGRATED AM-FM/IO DEMODULATORS FOR GIGABIT-RATE DATA DETECTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to data transmission over wireless radio links, and more particularly to a detectors and receivers for providing fast data transmission over wireless radio links.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Gigabit-rale data transmission has been achieved in the 60-GHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band using ASK modulation with transceiver modules consisting of several GaAs integrated circuits (ICs) mounted on a ceramic substrate. An example of such prior art technology can be found in a publication by K. Ohata et al., "Wireless 1.25 Gb/s Transceiver Module at 60-GHz Band". It is a goal of the present invention to provide a singlc-IC receiver or transceiver in less expensive silicon process technology which supports multiple modulation formats, including ASK modulation.<br>
Product detectors are well known in the literature for detection of ASK or AM signals. Examples of such detectors in the prior art include an excerpt from Solid-Statc Radio Engineering by Krauss, Bostian, and Raab, and from Radio-Frequency Electronics by Hagen. This disclosure describes an improved product detector which is capable of operation at gigabit data rates and with good linearity on millivolt-level IF input signals, which has high input impedance so as not to detune the IF input circuit to which it is connected, and which can be easily powered down so as not to load the IF input circuit or consume power when the receiver is used in other modulation modes.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
This disclosure relates to the goal of providing gigabit-rate data transmission over wireless radio links, using carrier frequencies in the millimeter-wave range (&gt; 30 GHz). More specifically, it describes a circuit for detection of amplitude-shift keyed (ASK) or<br><br>
olhcr amplitude modulations (AM) which can be easily incorporated into an integrated circuit receiver system, making the receiver capable of supporting both complex IQ modulation schemes and simpler, non-coherent on-off or multiple-level keying signals.<br>
This disclosure also describes several novel radio architectures which, with the addition of a frequency discriminator network, have the capability of handling frequency -shift keyed (FSK) or other frequency modulations (FM), as well as AM and complex IQ modulation schemes.

Detailed Description of the Preferred Invention<br>
Fig. 1 shows our novel radio architecture incorporating both quadrature down-conversion and an active ASK/AM detector (5) at the intermediate frequency. The ASK/AM detector output (5) is multiplexed (6) with the 1-channel down-conversion output to enable reuse of the existing baseband low-pass filter and amplifier (9) to filter and amplify the detected ASK/AM signal. An integrated AM detector increases the application space of a 60GHz receiver by providing the ability to detect non-coherent on-off keying signals and other amplitudc-shift-kcycd modulations. These non-coherent modulation formats simplify a radio system design by eliminating the need for carrier phase recovery or other complex baseband 1Q signal processing to demodulate received data. ASK/AM formats arc suitable for highly directional wireless data links which do not suffer from interfering or reflected signals. Complex baseband 1Q signal processing, on the other hand, provides the capability of rejecting interfering and reflected signals, as might be required in an omni-directional wireless data link. Thus, a receiver capable of detecting both modulation modes has wider application.<br>
Figs. 2 and 3 show product detectors that might be used as the ASK detector in Fig. 1, as described in prior art. Fig. 2 is a conceptual diagram showing the modulated input signal (12) applied to both inputs of a mixer (13). Without specifying the implementation details of the mixer, it is impossible to know the transfer function of this arrangement, but if the mixer has equal conversion gains through both inputs, then the output signal (14) is the<br><br>
square of the input signal, an approximation of the desired absolute value function.<br>
Many practical mixer circuits do not have equal conversion gains through both inputs, but rather require a relatively large amplitude signal through one input (the LO-input in Figs. 2-4) and provide a relatively high conversion gain and a linear response characteristic through the other input (the RF-input in Figs. 2-4). Fig. 3 shows a more realistic product detector which uses a limiter or limiting amplifier (18) to provide an approximately constant input signal level to the mixer's LO-inpul (17). If the mixers LO-inpul has a sufficiently large signal level, this circuit provides a closer approximation to the desired absolute value function.<br>
The circuit in Fig. 3 will not work properly at high data rates and low input-signal levels because it does not provide a capability for time-aligning the mixer's RF- and LO-inpul signals (16 and 17, respectively). If the two input signals to the mixer arc misaligned, the detector's output amplitude is reduced and the output pulse is broadened, lowering the detector's effective bandwidth. Circuit simulations indicate that alignment of the two signals within 10-20 degrees of a cycle at the highest input modulation frequency is desirable, which corresponds to 28-56 ps at a modulating frequency of 1 GHz. An improved product detector which provides the capability of time-aligning the input signals is shown in Figs. 4 and 5. This improved product detector also has high input impedance so as not lo detune the IF input circuit to which it is connected, and it can be easily powered down so as not to load the IF input circuit or consume power when the receiver is used in other modulation modes, all features which are advantageous for practical implementation of the architecture in Fig. 1.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, our implementation of the ASK/AM detector includes a double balanced mixer (26) as the detector, and amplifiers in the mixer's RF- and LO-input signal paths, labeled amplifier 1 (27) and amplifier 2 (28), respectively. Amplifier 2 (28) provides a relatively high-gain path lo the mixer's LO-input, while amplifier ] (27) provides a relatively lower-gain, linear path to the mixer's RF-input. The two amplifiers are designed to have matched delays. This is accomplished by using amplifiers which are topologically similar. Resistor RI2 (68) reduces the gain and linearizes amplifier 2 (28), which consists of Q8-11 (37-40) and R10-14 (66-70), while C5 (optional) (84) helps to match the delays and bandwidlhs of amplifiers 1 (27) and 2 (28). That is, the inclusion of degeneration resistor R12 (68) may increase the bandwidth and reduce the delay of amplifier 1 (27) due to the<br><br>
negative feedback it creates, and the inclusion of C5 (84) increases the delay and reduces the bandwidth of amplifier 1 (27) to match amplifier 2 (28), compensating for R12 (68). In many cases, C5 (84) may be unnecessary, and the amplifier delays may be adequately matched due to the topological similarity.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the general circuit architecture which has been implemented in Fig. 5, with Amplifier I (20) in Fig. 4 corresponding to Amplifier I (27) in Fig. 5, etc. The detailed circuit in Fig. 5 also includes an optional input buffer amplifier (29) to raise the input impedance of the circuit, so that it does not load or detune the IF circuitry in Fig. 1.<br>
Circuit simulations were performed on the entire receiver with ASK demodulator, the partial block diagram of which is shown in Fig. 1. The detailed circuit which was actually simulated included a low-noise amplifier with a gain of 20 dB preceding the RF-input (1) shown in Fig. 1. The mixer (2)and the IF amplifier (4) each have a gain of 10 dB, for a total of 40 dB gain between the LNA input and the IF amplifier output. The circuit was simulated for LNA-referred signal levels of-65 dBm to -35 dBm, which resulted in IF signals in the range of 5-500 mV peak at the ASK detector input. The RF-input frequency was 64 GHz and the IF 9.1 GHz.<br>
The simulation results shown in Fig. 6 are for a 1 GHz sinusoidal amplitude modulation of the RF input with 0.9 modulation index. The lower trace (87)in Fig. 6 is the IF waveform (amplitude vs. time), the middle trace (88) is ASK detector output waveform, and the top trace (89) is the detected ASK output after low-pass filtering and amplification through the baseband amplifier. It can be seen that the circuit in Fig. 5 closely approximates the absolute value of the input signal, which when low-pass filtered rc-gencratcs the AM or ASK signal. A 1 GHz sinusoidal modulation is roughly equivalent to on-off (2-levcl ASK) keying at 2 Gb/s.<br>
The simulation results shown in Fig. 7 arc for the entire receiver with the integrated product detector, using a 4-level ASK input at 2 G Symbols/s, which is equivalent to a data rate of 4 Gb/s. The lower trace (90) is the RF input waveform (amplitude vs. time) showing four amplitude levels, the 2"d from the bottom (91) is the IF waveform, the 3" from the bottom (92) is the ASK detector output waveform, and the top (94)is the demodulated ASK output after amplification and low-pass filtering through the baseband amplifier, showing four distinct demodulated levels.<br><br>
There is extensive prior art for AM/ASK detectors, as exemplified by numerous references above. The majority of patented circuits arc diode-based, such as U. S. Patent 3,691,465 to McFadycn, U. S. Patent 4,000,472 to Eastland, U. S. Patent 4,250,457 to Hofmann, U. S. Patent 4,320,346 to Hcalcy, U. S. Patent 4,359,693 to Saucr, U. S. Patent 4,492,926 to Kusakabc. Other detectors use means other than diodes to achieve rectification, including U. S. Patent 3,673,505 to Limberg, U. S. Patent 3965435 to Kriedt, U. S. Patent 4320346 to Hcalcy. Among product detectors (that is, mixer- or multiplier-based detectors), including (J. S. Patent 3,705,355 to Palmer, U. S. Patent 3792364 to Ananias, U. S. Patcnf 6230000 to Tayloe, none were found which employ the matched delay circuitry shown in Figs. 4-5 of the present invention.<br>
The concepts in this disclosure can be extended to include detection of FSK/FM signals as well, with the addition of a discriminator phase-shift network, as shown in Fig. 8. The FSK/FM detector (94) is built using many of the same components as the earlier ASK/AM detector. The phase-shift network H(f) (98) is designed to have 90 of phase shift at the IF carrier frequency. This circuit is well known in the literature and is variously called a delay-line FM detector or quadrature FM demodulator.<br>
Fig. 9 shows how this delay-line FM detector can be merged with an AM product detector into a radio architecture which can demodulate either ASK/AM or FSK/FM signals. Referring to Fig. 9, closing the switch Swl (104) and opening switches Sw2 (105) and Sw3 (106) configures the detector as an AM product detector as shown in Fig. 3. Closing Sw2 (105) and Sw3 (106)and opening Swl (104) configures the detector as a delay-line FM detector, as shown in Fig. 8.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a more specific implementation of the AM-FM detector architecture<br>
which includes the improved AM product detector described in Figs. 4 and 5. In Fig. 10, the<br>
two amplifiers used to time-align the input signal in Fig. 4 (Amp J (20) and Amp2 (21)) are<br>
shown here explicitly as "linear amp" (113) (corresponding to Ampl (20) in Fig. 4) and<br>
"limit amp" (118) (corresponding to Amp 2 (21) in Fig. 4). Also, one possible realization of<br>
the discriminator phase-shift network H(f) (117)is shown for a 9-GHz IF, which is the<br>
frequency used in our receiver. Referring to Fig. 10, closing the switch Swl (114) and<br>
opening switches Sw2 (115) and Sw3 (116) configures the detector as an AM product<br>
detector as shown in Fig. 4. Closing Sw2 (115) and Sw3 (116) and opening Swl (114)	;<br>
configures the detector as a delay-line FM detector, as shown in Fig. 8.<br><br>
Fig. .11 is the most general receiver architecture described. It supports three different modulations: complex 1Q modulation schemes, ASK/AM, and FSK/FM. With switches SwI (124) and SwQ (127) closed (and the others open), the architecture provides IQ demodulation. With SvvAM (125) closed (and the others open), AM demodulation is provided. With SwFM (]26) closed (and the others open), FM demodulation is provided. With both SwAM (125) and SwFM (127) closed (and the others open), simultaneous AM and FM demodulation is provided, which potentially increases the non-coherent data rate by a factor of two. Although not explicitly shown, it should be understood that the improved ASK/AM detector of Fig. 4 could be used in Fig. 11 by providing amplifiers with matched delays in the ASK/AM mixer signal paths. For simultaneous AM and FM demodulation, the AM detector should be as frequency insensitive as possible to limit leakage of FM into its detected output level, and the FM detector should be as amplitude insensitive as possible lo limit leakage of AM into its detected output level.<br>
Fig. 12 shows a specific, transistor-level implementation of our FM detector, which was implemented as part of the receiver architecture in Fig. 11. This general type of FM detector is variously known as a delay-line FM detector, or quadrature FM demodulator, or FM limiter-discriminator, and is well known in the literature. Our improved circuit uses a three-stage limiting amplifier (137), each stage of which has amplitude dependent gain. The amplitude-dependent gain provides relatively high gain for low amplitude input signals and lower gain for higher-amplitude input signals. This amplitude-dependent gain provides a more gradual clipping characteristic for higheramplitude input signals, which minimizes the asymmetry and second-order distortion products present in the output signal, while still providing effective limiting for loweramplitude input signals. Any asymmetry or second-order distortion in the output signal results in an amplitude-dependent DC offset in the limiter output, which results in poorer rejection of amplitude-modulated signals and a lower signal-to-noisc ratio. Thus, our improved limiting amplifier preserves high signal-to-noisc ratio in the presence of AM signals, which would be very important in systems which used simultaneous AM and FM modulation, as shown in Fig. 11.<br>
Fig. 13 reveals details of the limiting amplifiers. Each amplifier stage has two pairs of input transistors, one pair of which is rcsistivcly degenerated (Ql (139), Q3 (141) and R3 (149)) and one pair of which is not (Q2 (140), Q4 (142)). The non-degenerated pair provides high gain for small input signals until the input-signal amplitude reaches the<br><br>
point where the pair's differential output current saturates. The degenerated pair provides lower gain but will accept a larger signal before it saturates. Thus, the overall amplifier's clipping characteristic is made more gradual, providing lower DC offset and fewer second-order distortion products al the output.<br>
Fig. 14 shows the specific circuit implementation of the discriminator filter used in Fig. 12. It is designed to have 90 degrees of phase shift at the center frequency of 8.9 GHz and provide a phase shift which is linear with deviation in input frequency about this center frequency, over a range up to ±2 GHz. This is a practical differential, on-chip implementation of the theoretical network shown in the Fig. 10 inset.<br><br><br>
