				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION <br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates generally to a method of manufacture of a gypsum board<br>
and a device therefor, and more specifically to a method of manufacture of a gypsum<br>
board permitting the targeted delivery of additives to specified locations.<br>
2.	Background Art<br>
Gypsum board, and its production, has received attention in the building industry, and<br>
especially for providing an easily worked building material the consistency of which is<br>
available for general construction use. Desirable characteristics for gypsum board also<br>
include a smooth working surface, consistent thickness throughout, and the ability to provide<br>
finishing enhancements, such as paint or other protective coverings, thereon.<br>
Recent developments in the manufacture of gypsum board have also added to the<br>
durability and versatility of the uses to which gypsum boards may be put. For a fuller<br>
discussion of the developments in the building board field is known as glass reinforced<br>
gypsum (GRG) board, reference is made to the aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 6,524,679,<br>
commonly owned with the present invention, and incorporated by reference has if fully<br>
disclosed herein.<br>
Manufacturing facilities for the production of gypsum board, whether or not glass<br>
mats are utilized for the structural facings, are capital intensive in the costs of space,<br>
equipment and in the down time during which a gypsum board production line is<br>
reconfigured. For production of a variety of gypsum board products, for example, standard<br>
paper faced gypsum board, glass mat backed board, etc., down time of the production line<br>
represents a significant cost in the delay of production of gypsum board and in time wasted<br>
by production workers who remain idle.<br>
It has been further found that further finishing, e.g., painting, of a smooth gypsum<br>
board surface, is made easier because the need for additional prefinishing steps, such as<br>
priming, etc., may be minimized.<br>
In addition, gypsum products, e.g., wallboard, tile, block, casts and the like, have<br>
relatively little resistance to water when not modified by some chemical or physical<br><br>
modification to address the problem of water absorption by the gypsum board. When gypsum<br>
wallboard, for example, is immersed in water, the board may quickly absorb a considerable<br>
amount of water, lose a great deal of its integrity and structural strength, and distort or swell in<br>
different places. Many attempts have been made in the past to improve the water resistance of<br>
gypsum products by adding waterproofing materials within the gypsum slurry. The most<br>
common waterproofing material being used is a hydrophobic emulsion, usually an emulsion<br>
comprising wax, paraffin, asphalt or a silicone compound, e.g., silanes and siloxanes.<br>
As can be expected, modification of gypsum slurry to render it water resistant adds to<br>
the cost of gypsum production, both in terms of the cost of the added substance, and in terms<br>
of the additional equipment necessary to mix and deliver the water resisting compounds to<br>
the gypsum slurry before application. Thus, it has been found desirable to provide a gypsum<br>
board and manufacturing process thereof which can be manufactured at relatively high speed,<br>
has high structural integrity and strength by virtue of using a mat of relatively low diameter<br>
fibers, and may include in a face coating a polymeric additive material providing a surface<br>
ideal for further finishing of the gypsum board, in addition to a means for delivering the<br>
water resistant material targeted to the location on the gypsum board where it would be most<br>
useful, that is on the surface of the finished gypsum board product. While the water resistant<br>
capability is desirable for all of the gypsum layers in a gypsum board, it is now possible to<br>
target specified layers of a multiplayer gypsum board that is made in accordance with the<br>
aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 6,524,679, and other multilayer boards.<br>
As a result of further development obtained through practice and further<br>
consideration of the concepts disclosed and claimed the aforementioned U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,524,679, it has been found additionally desirable to provide a means for delivering specific<br>
desired additives to a specified multilayer density layer of a gypsum board panel, in order to<br>
obtain specified desirable properties. For example, it has been found desirable to increase the<br>
water resistance of the outer face surface of a glass mat gypsum panel made in accordance<br>
with the teachings in the aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 6,524,679. Moreover, in<br>
accordance with the teachings of that patent, the additives should only be targeted to that<br>
layer, for example, the dense slurry layer, in which it is desirable to provide the desired<br>
characteristic, so as to avoid unnecessary cost and weight to the final board panel by adding<br>
costly and sometimes denser additives to layers of the gypsum board that will not provide as<br>
much benefit as those to which the additives are targeted.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention seeks to provide an improved gypsum product and process<br>
therefor. In the present invention, contrary to the prior art, the gypsum product is made by<br>
adding a hydrophobic (that is, water repelling or resisting, the terms being used<br>
interchangeably) substance, such as, but not limited to, paraffin, wax, siloxanes and the like, in<br>
specified locations of the gypsum board where the water repellent properties are most useful,<br>
that is, at the surface and edges of the board. There is additionally provided in accordance with<br>
an embodiment of the present invention a method for providing water resistance to a<br>
predetermined surface of a gypsum product, the method comprising adding a hydrophobic<br>
substance to gypsum slurry that is directed to a specified location on the gypsum board.<br>
Accordingly there is disclosed and claimed herein a method of manufacture of<br>
gypsum board having fiber face sheets, comprising the steps of providing a first gypsum<br>
slurry having a first consistency continuously passing through a first gypsum slurry transport<br>
receptacle, depositing a predetermined amount of said first gypsum slurry onto at least a first<br>
continuous inorganic fiber face sheet, transporting said first continuous fiber sheet through a<br>
gypsum application station, providing a second gypsum slurry having a second consistency<br>
and depositing said second gypsum slurry onto said first fiber sheet and causing said second<br>
gypsum slurry to be essentially evenly distributed over an upwardly facing top surface of said<br>
first fiber sheet, providing a third gypsum slurry having a third consistency and depositing it<br>
onto a second of said continuous fiber sheets, said second inorganic fiber sheet having top<br>
and bottom surfaces, thereby coating said top surface of said second fiber sheet with said<br>
third gypsum slurry, homogeneously mixing an additive into one of said first, second or third<br>
slurries, prior to the steps of providing the gypsum slurries, applying said second inorganic<br>
fiber sheet onto the second gypsum slurry thereby sheathing said second gypsum slurry<br>
within said first and second fiber sheets to form a wet gypsum board product.<br>
For use with an inorganic fiber, such as that disclosed in aforementioned U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,524,679, the method of manufacture of gypsum board having face sheets comprising<br>
inorganic fiber, preferably randomly oriented inorganic fiber, comprises the steps of depositing<br>
a predetermined amount of first gypsum slurry having a first consistency onto at least one<br>
continuous sheet of randomly aligned inorganic fiber material having random interstices<br>
between the fibers by passing at least one continuous inorganic fiber sheet through a gypsum<br>
application station, the station including two applicator wheels through which pass the<br>
inorganic fiber sheet, so as to cause the first gypsum slurry having a first consistency to<br>
penetrate through the random openings between the inorganic fibers and thereby to coat both<br><br>
top and bottom surfaces of the inorganic fiber material with the gypsum having a first<br>
consistency, directing the first inorganic material from the gypsum slurry application station to<br>
a first forming plate, depositing a second gypsum slurry having a second consistency on the<br>
first inorganic fiber material and causing the second gypsum slurry to be essentially evenly<br>
distributed over an upwardly facing top surface of the first inorganic fiber sheet, applying a<br>
third gypsum slurry having a third consistency to a second of at least one continuous inorganic<br>
fiber sheets, and causing the third gypsum slurry to penetrate essentially completely through<br>
random interstices in the second inorganic fiber sheet, applying the second inorganic fiber<br>
sheet onto the second gypsum slurry thereby sheathing the second gypsum slurry within the<br>
first and second inorganic fiber sheet to form a wet gypsum board, passing the wet gypsum<br>
board through a board forming station having a lower forming plate and an upper forming<br>
plate, the upper forming plate comprising sections and defining at least one predetermined<br>
angle relative to the lower forming plate, the vertical separation between the lower plate and at<br>
least one section of the upper plate having a predetermined vertical dimension substantially<br>
equal to the desired thickness of the manufactured gypsum board. Alternatively, a forming<br>
wheel may be utilized to provide gypsum board having a predetermined thickness. Optionally,<br>
an edger bar may be used to smooth and otherwise complete the surface finish of the gypsum<br>
board. In a second embodiment, the method includes adding one or more polymeric additives<br>
to the gypsum slurry of one or both surfaces.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, a multilayer gypsum board comprising a<br>
first layer of set gypsum comprising a first layer of a mixture of set gypsum having an outer<br>
surface and at least one polymeric compound entrained within the set gypsum, and being<br>
impregnated within a thin sheet of randomly aligned inorganic fibers, the outer surface of the<br>
sheet being essentially encased within the set gypsum and polymeric compound, a second layer<br>
comprised of set gypsum, the set gypsum in the second layer being of a lower density than the<br>
set gypsum in the first layer; and a third layer having an outer surface comprising set gypsum<br>
impregnated with a second thin sheet of randomly aligned inorganic fibers, the outer surface of<br>
the third sheet being essentially encased within the set gypsum of the third layer; the set gypsum<br>
in the first being integrally bonded to the gypsum of the second layer and the set gypsum in the<br>
second layer being bonded integrally to the gypsum in the third layer.<br>
One feature of the invention is the use of a turbulator mechanism in the additive<br>
delivery assembly. In a gypsum board forming device comprising a supply of continuous<br>
sheet of material, a gypsum slurry mixer including a gypsum delivery mechanism, disposed<br>
at least at one gypsum delivery station for delivering the gypsum slurry onto the continuous<br><br>
sheet, at least one additive assembly connected to an additive fluid feed for adding a<br>
homogenous stream of an additive to the first gypsum slurry in a first gypsum slurry<br>
transport receptacle, a gypsum core delivery mechanism including a second gypsum slurry<br>
transport receptacle, a sheet joining station for joining the continuous sheet to the core<br>
gypsum, and a gypsum conveyor line, having a belt with a surface for conveying formed<br>
gypsum board from the sheet joining station, the additive assembly including an additive<br>
delivery port in fluid communication with the additive fluid feed, a turbulator disposed in-<br>
line with the additive fluid feed of at least one of the gypsum delivery mechanisms, the<br>
turbulator comprising a fluid constrictor having an outlet, the fluid constrictor outlet being<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the diagrammatical, cross-sectional illustration of Fig. 1, the board forming station<br>
10 of an inventive embodiment of the inventive plant is shown. Although illustrated in cross-<br>
section, the station 10 is shown diagrammatically to clearly depict the separate elements in<br>
relation to each other. Modifications to the arrangement are possible and distances between<br>
the separate elements are not to scale for simplicity of illustration, but a pragmatic and<br>
efficient arrangement will come to mind to a person having ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The inventive plant 10 comprises a supply roll 12 that provides feed of a continuous<br>
sheet of facing material that, in the arrangement shown, defines a bottom-facing sheet 14.<br><br>
The supply roll 12 may feed out a sheet comprising any conventional material used in<br>
gypsum boards, for example, paper or paper board, but for purposes of the present invention,<br>
the material of bottom facing sheet 14 preferably comprises a mat of long inorganic, e.g.,<br>
glass, fibers which will be more clearly described below with reference to the formation of<br>
the inventive gypsum board product, when the inorganic fibers comprise a glasso-glassive<br>
fiber, the products being, sometimes referred to herein as glass reinforced gypsum ("GRG")<br>
boards.<br>
The supply roll 12 pays out the continuous bottom facing sheet 14 over a first<br>
forming table 16, having an upwardly facing surface 18, provides a working surface for<br>
further processing of the bottom facing sheet 14. The first forming table 16 also provides a<br>
support for creaser wheel assembly 20, disposed athwart the surface 18.<br>
The sheet 14 may be extracted from the supply roll 12 by motion of the sheet being<br>
pulled through the board forming station 10 by the belt line, as will be described. The two<br>
creaser wheels are vertically disposed within the creaser wheel assembly 20, one set of<br>
wheels 22 above the bottom facing sheet 14 cooperate with a second set of wheels, referred<br>
to as the wheel anvil 22', below the sheet 14. The creaser wheels 22, 22' rotate on axles and<br>
produce partially cut edge creases on the sheet 14 adjacent to each of the longitudinal edges<br>
of the bottom-facing sheet 14. The edge creases are spaced to allow varying fold thicknesses<br>
and to cause the edges to turn upwardly so as to retain slurry poured onto the bottom-facing<br>
sheet 14 downstream of the creaser wheel assembly 20, as is described below.<br>
A continuous mixer 30, accepting raw materials, i.e. stucco, plaster, gypsum (in<br>
powder form), water and other additives, through one or more inlets, one of which inlets 32<br>
is shown in Fig. 1. The mixer 30 provides a mixing capacity that formulates a desirable<br>
density of wet gypsum slurry by, for example, rotating a mixing blade (not shown) via a<br>
drive shaft 33. Because it is a desirable feature for this invention to produce a multi-layer<br>
gypsum board, the mixer 30 may comprise separate mixing chambers (not shown in Fig. 1)<br>
for providing separate, and different slurry mixtures. A continuous mixer, such as that<br>
utilized in this invention, is described and illustrated in commonly-owned U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,908,521, which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.<br>
The continuous mixer 30 thus provides several outlets for gypsum slurry each having<br>
varying desirable characteristics depending on the function of the slurry layer for which any<br>
specific outlet is producing gypsum slurry. Each outlet includes an output control for<br>
controlling the amount of gypsum slurry permitted to flow through the outlets and into the<br>
gypsum board forming plant. The control may be one or more slurry delivery mechanisms,<br><br>
as described in aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 5,908,521, which have controlled variable<br>
delivery speeds so that only the desired amount of gypsum slurry is pumped through the<br>
outlets.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 1, mixer 30 comprises a first slurry outlet 34, controllable by a<br>
control device 36, that allows for the continuous flow of a slurry mixture having desirable<br>
characteristics, as described in aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 5,908,521. In this<br>
embodiment, mixer 30 is set to provide two types of slurry. Control device 36 delivers a<br>
denser gypsum slurry mixture that is ultimately utilized adjacent the facing of the completed<br>
gypsum board, as will be described below.<br>
The end of the slurry outlet 34 extrudes the gypsum slurry directly onto the bottom-<br>
facing sheet 14, which is continuously moving over the surface 18 of forming table 16.<br>
Slurry outlet 34 preferably comprises a rubber boot, but other types of outlets may be used,<br>
for example flexible hoses or piping. Preferably, the gypsum slurry 38 is poured onto the<br>
upwardly facing surface of the sheet 14 at a position where it is supported by the forming<br>
table surface 18, and a predetermined amount of dense gypsum slurry is deposited over the<br>
continuously moving sheet 14 so as to coat the internal surface of bottom face sheet 14. It<br>
should be noted that this upwardly facing internal surface of sheet 14 is normally destined to<br>
be an inner surface of the bottom-facing sheet 14, and will be facing inwardly from the board<br>
surface when the gypsum board is fully formed. To ensure that the dense gypsum slurry 38<br>
is evenly spread out over the top surface of the bottom face sheet 14, a set of roller wheels<br>
40,42, also referred to herein as roll coaters 40,42, are positioned again vertically over and<br>
under the sheet 14. The wheels 40,42 can rotate in forward or reverse directions.<br>
One advantage and benefit which derives from use of rotating roller wheels 40,42 is<br>
that in addition to providing a smooth, evenly spread surface coating over the mat comprising<br>
the bottom facing sheet 14, the dense slurry layer 38 deposited on the inner mat surface is<br>
forced, by the top roller wheel 40, to extend through the sheet 14 and to form a structurally<br>
integral surface. The surface layer of gypsum slurry 38 may be modified to include<br>
additives, such as an engineered polymer, to provide structural strength and load carrying<br>
capability to the gypsum board product. As will be described, the optional polymer additive<br>
may also present a polymer matrix that provides a water impervious surface having desirable<br>
performance characteristics, such as, plastic sheathing, or water repelling, properties so as to<br>
expand the possible uses of the gypsum board products to both indoor and outdoor use.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the material comprising the bottom-<br>
facing sheet 14 is a mat of randomly aligned mineral, e.g., glass, fibers, having an average<br><br>
fiber diameter of 13-16 µm (.005-.0065 inches), and including a binder to hold the glass fibers<br>
in the form of a glass fiber mat having a desirable thickness. Such glass fiber mats are<br>
known for use in the production of gypsum board, for example, see aforementioned U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,524,679, No. 4,378,405 and WIPO Publication No. WO9809033 (European<br>
Patent No. EP 0 922 146). Use of a mineral fiber mat, which is porous to water generally,<br>
provides added structural strength to the gypsum board. The porous nature of the mineral<br>
fiber mat also permits gypsum slurry to penetrate through the pores between the mineral<br>
fibers and to permeate so as to cover both the top surface and through slurry penetrating the<br>
bottom surface of bottom facing sheet 14 because of slurry penetration. Thus, as the bottom<br>
facing sheet 14 passes through the roll coaters 40, 42, the unset higher density gypsum 38 is<br>
coated over the mineral fibers and is forced in the roll coating process to penetrate through<br>
the bottom facing sheet 14 and coat each of its top and bottom surfaces with an unset denser<br>
gypsum layer 38. Ideally, the high-density gypsum 38 is forced to penetrate 100% through<br>
the glass mat sheet 14, although manufacturing tolerances may permit penetration of<br>
approximately 95-98%.<br>
In a preferred form, the roll coaters 40, 42 cause penetration of the unset denser<br>
gypsum slurry 38 to coat the bottom surface of the glass mat bottom sheet 14. This bottom<br>
surface of the bottom-facing sheet 14 will ultimately become the facing surface of the<br>
completed gypsum board products. Preferably, the unset gypsum slurry 38 is caused to form<br>
a dam 39, which then impregnates a continuous layer of unset gypsum through to the bottom<br>
surface of the glass mat 14 to form a dense slurry gypsum layer having a thickness that is in a<br>
range from approximately 0.01 to 2.0 mm, as measured from the outermost surface of glass<br>
mat 14. Although penetration of the slurry 38 may not result in a continuous layer having a<br>
discrete thickness, nevertheless the process preferably will result in each of the glass fibers,<br>
comprising the glass fiber mat 14, in being coated on its surface so that very few or no<br>
exposed uncoated glass fibers remain.<br>
The speed of rotation of the rollers 40,42 may be adjustable depending on the<br>
viscosity of the density of gypsum slurry 38, the speed of linear travel of the glass fiber mat<br>
14 and the amount of the gypsum slurry 38 to be applied to the mat 14. In effect, the roll<br>
coaters 40, 42 serve to deliver the slurry 38 through the small random openings between<br>
fibers of mat 14 and deposit the material on the top of the fabric web in greater or lesser<br>
amounts, as desired, filling the openings and coating both the bottom face as well as the top<br>
face of mat 14.<br><br>
Although the roll coaters 40,42 are shown rotating in the direction of travel of the<br>
bottom facing sheet 14, it is possible, and in some embodiments of this invention, desirable<br>
to have the roll coaters rotate in the opposite direction from that shown in Fig. 1. In such<br>
case, a mechanism such as a forming belt line/disposed downstream of the roll coaters 40,<br>
42, described below, is utilized to provide a motive force for pulling the bottom facing sheet<br>
14 through the gypsum board forming station 10, even against the reactive forces produced<br>
by counter-rotating coater rolls. Of course, alternatively, other means may be utilized at<br>
different locations in the processing production line to provide the motive force for moving<br>
the sheet 14 through the station 10, for example, another set of rollers downstream (not<br>
shown) that pull the mat 14 toward the right. It should be noted that the gypsum slurry layer<br>
on the top surface of bottom facing sheet need not be absolutely level or completely even<br>
since subsequent steps in the process may provide additional smoothing opportunities, as will<br>
be described below.<br>
Gypsum board with mineral fiber facing sheets may be produced in multiple layers,<br>
including, but not limited to, a strong, more dense upper and lower surface layers and a less<br>
strong and less dense middle layer or core. The layered structure is advantageous as it allows<br>
the gypsum board to have a reduced weight, without sacrificing the composite structural<br>
strength of the final gypsum board product. Thus, and in accordance with the teachings of<br>
aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 5,908,521, the continuous mixer 30 is configured to provide<br>
a second, less dense gypsum slurry, referred to as core gypsum slurry 44 or simply slurry 44,<br>
which comprises the bulk of the material in the finished gypsum board products. The core<br>
gypsum slurry 44 is pumped out of the mixer 30 by a control device 46 and through an outlet<br>
48, which may comprising a rubber boot or hose. A continuous layer of the unset slurry 44 is<br>
caused to form onto the laterally moving combination bottom facing sheet 14 and layer of<br>
dense slurry 38.<br>
The core slurry 44 may comprise a different composition of constituent material than<br>
the dense gypsum slurry 38, for example by the addition of filler or strengthening additives,<br>
as is known, or may simply comprise the same constituent elements but may have a lighter or<br>
less dense consistency because the gypsum slurry 44 contains foaming materials therein,<br>
which are not added to the dense slurry 38. It is known that a longer mixing time for the<br>
unset gypsum causes more of the entrained air bubbles, sometimes referred to as foaming, to<br>
reach the surface of the unset gypsum and thus to be removed from the unset gypsum slurry<br>
material. It is the greater amount of air, entrained as miniscule air bubbles, which gives rise<br>
to the lighter, less dense core gypsum slurry 44.<br><br>
Gypsum slurry, and especially gypsum slurry that has been modified with polymer<br>
additives, has adhesive characteristics in its wet state that present some difficulty in handling.<br>
Accordingly, a film coating 43 is preferably provided on at least one of the roll coaters,<br>
preferably roll coater 42, which allows for easier continuous separation of the coater wheel<br>
 surface from the surface of the wet gypsum surface while simultaneously depositing the<br>
majority of the gypsum slurry 38 on the mat of sheet 14. Materials for such a film coating<br>
surface include appropriate polymers, such as a Teflon® coating, that are capable of<br>
providing a firm surface yet avoiding gypsum slurry adhering or clinging to the surface of the<br>
roll coater wheels.<br>
Another important reason for providing a denser slurry layer, in conjunction with a<br>
lighter core slurry layer in the gypsum board, is that the boundary between the dense slurry<br>
layers 38, and the core slurry layer 44 provides an inhibiting barrier that serves to control and<br>
inhibit the migration of the polymer additives from the surface dense slurry layer 38 to the<br>
core slurry layer 44. This migration is most likely to occur during the conventional heat<br>
rendering process, described below, used for drying the finished board product. The<br>
resulting board product is rendered better equipped to retain the polymer additives in the<br>
surface dense slurry layer 38, which thus form a better, more uniform polymer matrix base or<br>
"root system" for co-polymer formation with finishing products, as is described below.<br>
As the dense gypsum layer 38 dries and cures, the polymer additives entrained therein<br>
migrate toward and through the underlying fiber facing sheet 14 and the migration may<br>
extend into the core slurry layer 44 in the form of tendrils or roots that provide for a greater<br>
integrity in the bond formed between the core gypsum layer 44, the fiber sheet 14 and the<br>
overlying dense slurry layer 38. Moreover, because the lighter gypsum layer 44 includes an<br>
entrained foam, and the dense slurry layer 38 does not, the penetration of the additive<br>
materials is deeper into the layer 44. This bonding produced by the impregnated additive<br>
polymeric material improves matrix formation, ultimately improving the surface hardness<br>
and structural integrity of the finished gypsum board, and provides a strong outer shell to the<br>
board and also improves the load bearing capacity, contributing to its flexibility.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 1, after passing through the roll coaters 40, 42, the bottom<br>
facing sheet 14 passes onto a second forming table 50 having a horizontal forming surface<br>
52. Although the first forming table 16 and second forming table 50 are shown as separate<br>
tables in the diagrammatic rendition of Fig. 1, it is possible and in certain cases preferable,<br>
that the forming table comprises one elongated table (not shown) with several cutout portions<br><br>
within which, for example, the creaser wheel assembly 20, or the roll coaters 40, 42 and<br>
vibrators, are mounted.<br>
To facilitate the transport of the bottom-facing sheet 14, including the weight of the<br>
dense slurry 38 and core slurry 44, a non-stick table deck 59 is disposed over the surface 52<br>
of table 50. Referring now to Fig. 2, which is a detailed view of Fig. 1, an upwardly facing<br>
surface 60 of table deck 59 provides a working surface for the production of gypsum board.<br>
Preferably, the table cover comprises a smooth, non-stick material, such as stainless steel, an<br>
elastomeric material, e.g., rubber, or a polymeric material, e.g., Formica®, and is of sufficient<br>
structural strength to support the moving weight of the slurry 44 deposited on the table 50.<br>
As is evident in the detailed cross-sectional view of Fig. 2, the table deck 59 rests<br>
directly on surface 52 of table 50, so that as the core slurry 44 is deposited on the bottom<br>
facing sheet 14, the weight of the slurry 44 places downward pressure on the sheet 14,<br>
resulting in flattening of the under surface of the sheet 14 against the surface of the table deck<br>
59. However, because of the smooth, non-stick characteristics of the table deck 59, the bottom<br>
facing sheet 14 and slurry 38, 44, freely traverse over the forming tables, as described below.<br>
The cross-sectional view of Fig. 1 also does not show the width of the outlet spouts 34<br>
and 48. Various known configurations may be utilized, including an elongated spout that is<br>
disposed transversely to the direction of board travel. Such spouts may output a sheet of<br>
gypsum slurry across the width of the mat 14. Alternatively, a tubular spout attached to a<br>
rubber boot (as shown) deposits a continuous stream of gypsum slurry onto the glass fiber<br>
sheet 14. That gypsum slurry stream may then be spread out, before reaching the roll coaters<br>
40,42, to provide a smooth surface over the sheet 14 by, for example, diagonally angled vanes<br>
(not shown) or by specially constructed rollers or a dam that spread the gypsum slurry from the<br>
center toward the edges of bottom sheet 14. The exact shape of the spouts is not considered to<br>
be critical to this invention, as long as the function is achieved of evenly spreading the gypsum<br>
slurry over the entire width of the mat of both the bottom and top sheets.<br>
The unset, less dense core gypsum slurry 44 is deposited on the penetrated bottom<br>
facing sheet 14 at or adjacent a third forming table 56, having a top surface 58, for supporting<br>
the combination of penetrated mat 14 and slurry 44. An opening 62 between the second<br>
forming table 50 and third forming table 56 provides a space for disposing a first deck vibrator<br>
64, and another opening 66 provides for mounting a second deck vibrator 68 between the third<br>
forming table 56 and a fourth forming table 70, having a top surface 72. Such vibrators are<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 4,477,300, which is incorporated by reference herein.<br><br>
As shown more clearly in the detailed view of Fig. 2, the table deck 59 extends<br>
between the first and second forming tables 50,56 over the opening 62, and also between the<br>
third and fourth forming tables 56, 70 over the opening 66. Because each of the tables 50, 58,<br>
70 are disposed so that their surfaces 52, 58,72 are coplanar, the table deck 59 mounted onto<br>
the table is vertically fully supported across essentially the full length of the gypsum board<br>
forming station 10, i.e., across the full length defined by second to fourth forming tables 50,<br>
56,70.<br>
Shown in Fig. 2, deck vibrators 64,68 each comprise rolls 74, which are mounted<br>
immediately adjacent sections of the table deck 59 covering the upper portion of the<br>
respective openings 62, 66. Each of the deck vibrator rolls 74 are mounted to rotate around<br>
axles 76, both extending horizontally in a direction transversely to the direction of travel of<br>
the board production line. Each of the rolls 74 has a diameter that is just slightly less than the<br>
radial distance between each axis 76 and the bottom surface 62', 66' of the table deck 59<br>
covering the respective openings 62, 66.<br>
Each deck vibrator 64,68 further comprises a plurality of bumps 78 which extend<br>
radially beyond the outer surface 79 of the deck vibrator rolls 74. Bumps 78 extend<br>
longitudinally along the surface 79 of the rolls 74 in a direction parallel to the axis 76. As the<br>
deck vibrator rolls 74 rotate about axis 76, the bumps 78 routinely strike the underside<br>
surfaces 62', 66' of the table deck 59, which momentarily lifts the table deck 59, together<br>
therewith the bottom facing sheet 14 and slurry 38,44, combination, which agitates the slurry<br>
resting on sheet 14. Such agitation causes the slurry 38 to even out over the upper surface of<br>
the penetrated mat 14 and also causes the slurry 44 to more completely permeate through and<br>
bond with the denser slurry 38 located on the upper surface of the bottom facing sheet 14.<br>
Another feature provided by the deck vibrators 64,68, is the "kneading out" of larger<br>
entrapped foam air bubbles from the bottom surface of the bottom facing sheet 14. As the<br>
bottom-facing sheet 14 passes over the openings 62, 66, the denser slurry 38, which has<br>
penetrated through the mat of bottom facing sheet 14, is still unset and continues to have<br>
entrained air bubbles within the gypsum slurry and adjacent bottom sheet surface. Vibration<br>
from the deck vibrators 64, 68, causes these foam bubbles to reach the surface and exit from<br>
within the penetrated gypsum slurry 38, thus resulting in a smooth outer surface of the<br>
completed gypsum board when the manufacturing process is completed, as in<br>
aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 4,477,300.<br>
Completion of the smoothing operation of the slurry 44, resulting in an essentially<br>
planar combined bottom facing sheet 14 and core slurry 44 is further facilitated by a forming<br><br>
plate in the top and bottom sheet joining station 80 (Fig. 1), disposed downstream, i.e.,<br>
toward the right as seen in Fig. 1, of the deck vibrators 64, 68. The forming plate assembly<br>
of sheet joining station 80 operates in conjunction with a top facing sheet 114 formed by the<br>
sheet coating station sub-assembly 110 having similar elements to those in the main<br>
production line that form the bottom-facing sheet 14.<br>
Top-facing sheet 114 is comprised of a sheet or mat of randomly aligned mineral<br>
fibers, such as glass fibers, and is unrolled from a supply roll 112, similar to the supply roll<br>
12. Similar elements to those used for the production of bottom facing sheet 14 are identified<br>
by like numerals in the 100 series, utilizing the same two last digits as those identifying the<br>
like elements in the production of the bottom sheet 14. Supply roll 112 pays out a continuous<br>
top facing sheet 114, which, in the completed gypsum board, will be adjacent the inner facing<br>
surface of the gypsum board product subsequently used in wall construction.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the top facing sheet 114 may require feeding through various<br>
loops around, for example, rollers 102, so as to avoid interference of the main production line<br>
by the operation of top sheet sub-assembly 110. Top sheet sub-assembly 110 directs the top<br>
facing sheet 114 over a top sheet forming table 116 having an upwardly facing surface 118.<br>
The continuous mixer 30 further comprises a slurry outlet 134 being controllable by a<br>
control device 136 providing a continuous stream of denser gypsum slurry 138 to the sub-<br>
assembly 110 for deposit onto the top facing sheet 114, as shown. A detailed cross-sectional<br>
view of the top sheet production station portion of sub-assembly 110 is illustrated in Fig. 3,<br>
and reference is now jointly made to Figs. 1 and 3. Although in Fig. 1, the preferred<br>
embodiment of two separate slurry controllers 36, 136 are shown for supplying two different<br>
slurry mixtures 38, 138, for respectively, the bottom facing sheet 14 and the top sheet 114, it<br>
may be desirable to have one mixer discharge leading to dual controllers for controlling the<br>
discharge of two or more outlets, similar to that described in aforementioned U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,714,032. Alternatively, a single controller (not shown) may be used with the discharge<br>
outlets having individual valves enabling variable flow of gypsum slurry that is controllable<br>
for each outlet spout depending on the operational needs of the board production process.<br>
Shown in Fig. 1, are separate controllers 36,46,136, each for controlling the output<br>
of a single outlet, i.e., dense gypsum slurry outlets 34,134, or core slurry outlet 48. The<br>
configuration of the continuous mixer 30 provides separate mixing chambers, each attached<br>
to, and feeding gypsum slurry to, a separate outlet, which provides a specific type of gypsum<br>
slurry, as needed. Customization of the slurry provided to each of the outlets 34,48,134<br>
thus enable a gypsum board line operator to provide different slurries, having desirable<br><br>
characteristics, to the location in the manufacturing line where needed. For example, an<br>
outlet, such as outlet 34, may be required to provide a denser gypsum slurry, such as slurry<br>
38. The slurry may be desired to include specified additives, for example, a polymeric<br>
compound, which forms a matrix with the set gypsum after it sets, so as to provide a suitable<br>
surface for further finishing, as will be described below. However, if it is only necessary for<br>
the front facing surface to have such a surface, then using the embodiment shown in Fig. 1<br>
provides the option to include the additive in only the dense gypsum slurry 38, pumped from<br>
controller 36, but not to include such an additive in the slurry 138, which will end up on the<br>
inner, back side of the gypsum board during construction. Alternatively, the gypsum slurry<br>
138 is denser than the core slurry 44, and may have an identical consistency as that of the<br>
slurry 38 coating the bottom facing sheet 14.<br>
Referring again to Figs. 1 and 3 showing the top sheet slurry coating station 110, the<br>
dense gypsum 138 is deposited on the top facing sheet 114, comprised of a mat of glass<br>
fibers, which is moving in the direction shown by arrow A, past the surface of the top sheet<br>
slurry table 116. The top sheet is moving essentially at the same rate as that of the bottom<br>
facing sheet 14 traveling over forming table 16. The gypsum slurry 138 is denser than the<br>
core slurry 44, and may have an identical consistency as that of the slurry 38 coating the<br>
bottom-facing sheet 14.<br>
The top facing sheet slurry coating station 110 comprises a short forming plate 116,<br>
similar to the forming table 16, with the exception that the linear dimension of plate 116 is<br>
much shorter, having a sufficient length to achieve deposition of the gypsum slurry 138 and<br>
to spread out the slurry over the surface of the moving top facing sheet 114 between the<br>
lateral edges of the continuous sheet 114. To assist in the process of spreading the gypsum<br>
slurry 138 over the surface of sheet 114, one or more pneumatic table vibrators, such as<br>
vibrator 148, may be included to vibrate the surface 118 of the table 116.<br>
Applicator wheel 140, having a cylindrical surface 142, rotates about an axle 144,<br>
which axle 144 extends transversely to the direction of travel of the sheet 114. The vertical and<br>
horizontal disposition of axle 144 is important in obtaining the desired result of sheet 114 being<br>
fully impregnated with the dense slurry 138. As shown in Fig. 3, axle 144 is disposed linearly<br>
at a very short distance past the edge 117 of table 116. The axle is vertically disposed just<br>
slightly less than the radius of wheel 140 above the table surface 118 so that the applicator<br>
wheel 140 extends into the space under the plane defined by the table surface 118. As is shown<br>
in Fig. 3, during production the applicator wheel 140 puts downward pressure on top facing<br><br>
sheet 114, which sheet is deflected some slight distance from its linear path followed across the<br>
table surface 118.<br>
The dense gypsum slurry 138 being deposited on the moving top facing sheet 114'<br>
produces a slurry concentration at a dam 139, comprised of excess dense slurry 138, which<br>
collects in the constricted space between the applicator wheel 140 and the top facing sheet<br>
114. The size of dam 139 can vary, depending on the desired characteristics of the resulting<br>
impregnated top facing sheet 114' that is produced by the top sheet coating station 110. For<br>
example, if a greater degree of coating is desired to provide greater structural strength of the<br>
gypsum board, then the size of the dam 139 may be adjusted so that a greater amount of<br>
dense gypsum slurry is impregnated into the interstices between the mineral fibers of the mat<br>
comprising top facing sheet 114. For purposes of distinction, top facing sheet 114 is<br>
designated as impregnated top facing sheet 114' after impregnation by the dense slurry 138.<br>
Working in conjunction with the applicator wheel 140 is downwardly curved<br>
transversely extending directional plate 113, upon which the sheet 114 impinges as it exits<br>
from contact with the applicator wheel 140. The directional plate 113 is preferably mounted<br>
so that the apex 115 is adjacent or within the plane defined by the surface 118. This<br>
positioning causes the sheet 114 to be placed into tension as the applicator wheel 140 pushes<br>
the sheet 114 downwardly from the plane, which disposition assists in the penetration of the<br>
gypsum slurry 138 through the mat of sheet 114. To inhibit the formation of slurry 138 on<br>
the surface 142 of applicator wheel 140, an appropriate thin film coating 143, comprising, for<br>
example, a Teflon® coating, may be optionally disposed on the surface of wheel 140, similar<br>
to the coating 43 of roll coater 42 described above.<br>
The top sheet 114', impregnated with the dense gypsum slurry 138, is directed from<br>
the applicator wheel 140 to a second roller wheel, the transition roller wheel 104, having an<br>
axle 144' that is parallel to axle 144. The transition roller wheel 104 is in the general path<br>
and in the plane defined by the surface 118, and its function is to change the direction of<br>
travel of the top facing sheet 114' so as to render the top surface of the sheet to become the<br>
bottom surface, and vice versa. That is, the surface of the top facing sheet 114 that was on<br>
the bottom adjacent the surface 118, becomes the top surface and the sheet 114' is ready for<br>
delivery to and joining over the core slurry 44, as is described below.<br>
The sheets 114,114' are joined at a sheet joining station 80 (Fig. 1) that is described in<br>
more detail in aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 6,524,679, and the remainder of the discussion<br>
in that patent relating to the board forming structure and methods will be omitted herefrom for<br>
brevity.<br><br>
The features that are significant to the present invention relate to the mixer 30 and the<br>
dispersion of the additives onto one or both of the mats 14,114 before they are assembled at<br>
the gypsum board forming station. As shown in Fig. 1, and described in the parent U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,524,679, the dense slurry layers 38,138 which are deposited onto the mats 14,114<br>
before they are joined with the core slurry layers 44, are first deposited on one or more<br>
specified locations on the mats 14, 114 and then are dispersed across the width of the mats 14,<br>
114 by the rollers to provide a uniformly thick film of dense slurry before they are joined at the<br>
sheet joining station 80. This even layer of dense gypsum is for the most part evenly<br>
distributed and for most additives, the distribution of the additives within the dense slurry 38,<br>
138 is also evenly distributed across the mats 14 or 114 by virtue of the dispersion of the<br>
additive within the dense slurry layer when it is mixed into the dense slurry at controllers 36 or<br>
136. However, for certain types of additives, for example, hydrophobic additives, it has been<br>
found that the mixture into the dense slurry is not always even, but may result in clumps or<br>
uneven dispersion of the hydrophobic additives throughout the dense slurry layer. As a result,<br>
when the dense slurry is dispersed over the mats 14,144, the film of dense slurry may be<br>
evenly and consistently spread out over the surface of the mat, but the additive itself may be<br>
clustered, either randomly or periodically, on the mat. Such as eventuality is undesirable, since<br>
uneven dispersion of the additive on the surface of the gypsum board products often result in<br>
the additive working poorly or inadequately to perform the function for which it was added.<br>
For example, one additive that was found to experience inconsistent dispersion over the<br>
board surface was a wax emulsion. The wax emulsion was added to provide desirable<br>
characteristics to the board surface, for example, to enhance water resistance at the board<br>
surface. However, as is generally well known, water will seek to penetrate into a surface and<br>
will first succeed to do so at a point of least resistance. Thus, water seepage into the core of a<br>
board was facilitated by the uneven dispersion of the way emulsion, and the boards were found<br>
to not meet the exacting standards of water resistance that were required in certain jurisdictions.<br>
Thus, the features of the present invention were developed to provide for more even dispersion<br>
of additives, and especially hydrophobic additives, into the dense gypsum slurry and thus to<br>
provide a consistently more even dispersion of the additive over the complete width profile of<br>
the board.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 4, in which similar elements are identified by the identical<br>
reference numbers, the mixer 30 is shown in a schematic diagram illustrating the additive<br>
delivery system. Mixer 30 may take the form of any of a number of mixer types, but in this<br>
instance, the mixer 30 preferably is a pin mixer 30 known in the art. The pin mixer 30 is the<br><br>
general mixer for all slurry for both the dense slurry layer and the core slurry layers. As<br>
described above, the core slurry 44 is taken directly from the mixer 30 through the controller<br>
46. However, the controller 36 controls the dense slurry 38 as it is siphoned from the pin mixer<br>
30. The pin mixer 30 has an inlet aperture 186 connected to an additive feed pipe 188 that<br>
feeds directly into the dense slurry outlet 34. The pipe 188 is used for delivery of dense slurry<br>
38 to one or both of mats 14, 114 onto which dense slurry 38 or 138, having the appropriate<br>
additives, is desired. Thus, the additive feed pipe 188 is capable of introducing an additive<br>
directly into the slurry stream as it passes through the dense slurry outlet 34.<br>
Although shown being connected to only the one dense slurry outlet 34, it should be<br>
understood that another pipe, similar to pipe 188, may also be attached to other outlets, either<br>
of the dense gypsum slurry, for example, outlet 134, or even to the core gypsum slurry outlet<br>
148, if that is found desirable. The described structure is not to be limited to the single<br>
connection shown, but a feature of the invention is the capability of targeting specified<br>
additives to that gypsum layer where they are desired. Other modifications will also become<br>
apparent to a person having ordinary skill, for example, connecting the additive feed pipe 188<br>
directly to the controller 36 or 136, where the desired additives are mixed into the dense<br>
gypsum slurry stream as other controls and processes are simultaneously occurring.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 4, the additive provided for mixing into the gypsum slurry<br>
streams is contained in an additive reservoir 192. Because the construction described herein is<br>
especially well suited for even dispersion of wax additive, for providing the desirable water<br>
absorption resistance at the surface of the gypsum board. The reservoir 192 contains wax, and<br>
it may require a preheating arrangement and a method of emulsifying the wax into an emulsion<br>
that can be easily dispersed in an aqueous slurry. The reservoir 192 schematically is shown<br>
being separated from the injection port 186, but it may be patentable to provide the reservoir<br>
closer to the pin mixer 30, of physically possible, to maintain the wax in the emulsified<br>
condition prior to delivery.<br>
A transfer pipe 194 is connected at one end to the wax emulsion reservoir 192, which<br>
provides a continuous stream of wax emulsion to the injection port 186, as needed. Filtration<br>
of the wax emulsion may be required, and a filter (not shown) may be disposed in the transfer<br>
pipe 192 to avoid excessively large wax solids from entering the wax emulsion stream to avoid<br>
plugging or clogging the delivery system, as will be described below.<br>
The transfer pipe 192 is connected at the other end to a pump 198 that may include a<br>
flow control for regulating the rotation of the pump 198, or as a separate flow control valve 196<br>
disposed in-line in either the transfer pipe 194 or the additive feed pipe 188, so as to control the<br><br>
rate of flow of the wax emulsion additive to the injection port 186. The wax emulsion rate flow<br>
control is a significant feature of the present invention, as very low flow rates are required for<br>
the additive, so as to maintain the desirable homogeneous consistency and constituent ratio of<br>
the dense gypsum slurry to additive. This permits the invention to achieve the optimum<br>
balance between reducing the cost of unnecessary additive, while also simultaneously<br>
providing a homogeneously applied water resistance, that is, consistently reducing the surface<br>
absorption characteristics, across the compete lateral surface of the board.<br>
To achieve the desired purposes, another significant feature is provide at the injection<br>
port 186, that mixes the additive into the dense gypsum slurry as it is transferred from the pin<br>
mixer 30 to the top and bottom slurry coating stations 110,18, respectively. Thus, there is<br>
provided an additive delivery system 200, disposed in-line at the additive injection port 186<br>
within the end of the additive feed pipe 188 that is attached to and feeds the dense slurry outlet<br>
34. An added impetus beyond gravitational forces for transferring the additive from the<br>
reservoir 192 to the additive delivery system 200 is shown schematically in Fig. 4, and<br>
comprises a pump 198, that may be a positive displacement pump, an air diaphragm pump, or<br>
other appropriate pumping mechanism. Other appropriate pumps comprise a MOYNO pump,<br>
available from Moyno, Inc., of Springfield, Ohio or a TRIPLEX pump, available from Kerr<br>
Pumps, of Sulphur, Oklahoma. The positive displacement is necessary to maintain a positive<br>
pressure on the additive stream to make it available at the additive delivery system 200, when<br>
and as needed. These types of positive displacement pumps are preferable because they avoid<br>
shearing of the emulsion, and so maintain the emulsion in the desired state.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 5, two additive delivery systems 200 are each connected to an<br>
additive feed pipe 34 at separate additive injection ports 186. Although two additive delivery<br>
systems 200 are shown, any number from one to twenty such systems may be utilized,<br>
depending on the amount and types of additives that is desired to be added to the slurry stream<br>
in pipe 34. Each of the systems 200 includes a quick connect coupling 202 to enable the quick<br>
connection to an input additive feed pipe, such as pipe 188 shown in Fig. 4. The quick connect<br>
coupling 202 is prefabricated and is attached to the system 200 and may include a quick<br>
connect hut 204 that provides a sealed fluid communication to the pipe 188 upon a simple<br>
tightening of nut 204.<br>
This arrangement provides for several advantages, including that of selective and easy<br>
attachment of the appropriate additive delivery system 200 to the dense gypsum slurry stream,<br>
depending on the type and characteristics of the board desired for manufacture. Alternatively,<br>
and in view of the below described construction of the system 200, it may be appropriate to<br><br>
connect two or more systems 200 to the same feed pipe (not shown), thereby delivering twice<br>
the amount of slowly injected additive into the slurry stream. This alternative procedure may<br>
be utilized to avoid excessive flow rate that would flow through a single system 200, and would<br>
also ensure more complete mixing of the additive in the gypsum slurry.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1,4 and 5 first gypsum slurry outlet pipe 34, connected to the pin<br>
mixer 30, and extends in an outward direction therefrom. After being discharged from the<br>
controller 36, it is connected to a first input pipe 208 that may be utilized as an extractor for<br>
dense slurry from the slurry stream, in the event such slurry is desired, for example, for testing<br>
or quality control, or if necessary for some other process in the manufacture of the gypsum<br>
board panels.<br>
Downstream along pipe 34 a diaphragm pinch valve assembly 210, comprising a<br>
connecting joint 212 connecting to the pipe 34 at one end, a diaphragm pinch valve 214 at the<br>
other end, and a central section 216, to which an air supply port 218 for the diaphragm pinch<br>
valve 214 is connected. The diaphragm valve 214 is pneumatically driven by the air supply<br>
and can control flow rate of the dense gypsum slurry as it passes through pipe 34.<br>
Immediately downstream of the diaphragm pinch valve assembly 210 there are disposed<br>
the two additive delivery systems 200, but fewer or more of these systems 200 may be<br>
connected to the pipe 34. Although, the preferable configuration of downwardly flowing<br>
systems 200 are shown, in order to be assisted by gravity flow of the additive, it is<br>
contemplated that this orientation may be changed to conserve space, and the systems may be<br>
disposed at an angle to the vertical or even underneath the pipe 34.<br>
The wax emulsion additive providing in the reservoir 192 (Fig. 4) may be any of a<br>
variety of waxes capable of providing water resistance to the surface, for example, one or more<br>
of a paraffin wax emulsion or other known and commercially available materials capable of<br>
providing water resistance characteristics. Furthermore, although described above in terms of<br>
the use of these additives with a fiber mat faced gypsum board, the present invention may also<br>
be used together with standard paper faced gypsum to increase the water resistance<br>
characteristics at the gypsum paper surface interfaces of such boards, or other types of<br>
cementitious boards in which targeted delivery may enhance the value of the products. Other<br>
additives that can be utilized in this method for both the types of panels described in<br>
aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 6,524,679 and for paper face products and any combination of<br>
cementitious and paper to improve or enhance other properties are as follows: polymers, boric<br>
acid, borates, other intumescence-like additives, surfactants, dispersants, retarders, potash,<br><br>
silicates, starches, phosphates, perlite, alumina and any material that can be solubilized or<br>
dispersed in a liquid media may be used.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 6 and 7, perspective views, respectively, of a ready to deploy<br>
and of a deployed additive delivery system 200, shown in alternative embodiments. As shown<br>
in Fig. 6, system 200 includes the quick connect nut 204 for connecting additive feed pipe 188<br>
to the additive inlet port 186. With this quick connect, a user may easily exchange pipes for<br>
providing other alternative additives, as desired, for injection into the dense slurry stream.<br>
For example, a wax emulsion additive has been described above. However, other<br>
chemical additives may be desired to be added by targeting only one of the layers of gypsum.<br>
Also physical additives may also be added for providing other desirable characteristics, for<br>
example to the dense slurry layers. One such exemplary additive may comprise the targeting of<br>
microfiber to the stratified dense slurry layer for providing enhanced structural strength to the<br>
outer layers of the finished gypsum board product. Alternatively, the microfibers may be<br>
introduced to both the dense and core gypsum layers, but in different concentrations, e.g., more<br>
concentrated mixture of microfibers may be added to the dense slurry layer and a less dense<br>
concentration may be added to the core gypsum, utilizing the teachings and structural features<br>
of the present invention.<br>
The microfibers may comprise any of a number of different materials, for example, e-<br>
glass, carbon, mineral fiber, polymeric and/or metallic fibers and the concentrations may be<br>
varied, depending on the specific characteristics of the gypsum layers that are desired. An<br>
appropriate range of concentration of such microfibers may be between 0.1% to 5.0% by<br>
volume. The microfibers may have lengths of from between 1.0 and 25.0 mm, widths of<br>
between 0.002 and 0.025 mm and an aspect ratio of between 1:1 and 25:1, depending on<br>
requirements.<br>
Referring again to the system 200 shown in Figs. 6 and 7, once the quick connect<br>
coupling nut 204 is tightened on to the system 200, there s a sealed flow of the additive<br>
materials, for example, a wax emulsion, through the system 200 and into gypsum slurry pipe<br>
2\34. The system 200 thus includes structural features that control the consistency and<br>
dispersion of the additives within the slurry stream passing through pipe 34, as described<br>
above.<br>
Additive delivery system 200 comprises an enclosing housing 206 that is shown as a<br>
rounded conical housing having a large diameter opening 208 and a small diameter opening<br>
208 and a small diameter opening 209. The small diameter opening 209 is connected by the<br>
quick connect pipe 204 to the additive feed pipe 188, and provides fluid communication so that<br><br>
the additive may flow through the housing 206 toward the inlet port 186. Although shown as<br>
having conical shape, the housing 206 may take any type of shape commensurate with<br>
maintaining the flow of additive into the slurry stream 38 in pipe 34, for example, an oblong<br>
bow or an octagonal enclosure.<br>
Housed within the enclosing housing 206 is a turbulator 220 that extends beyond the<br>
large diameter opening 208 in a longitudinal direction, as shown. The turbulator is fixed as<br>
shown in Fig. 6. It should be noted that Figs. 6 and 7 drawing may not necessarily be,to<br>
scale. The turbulator 220 is a feature of the invention that assists in homogeneous blending<br>
at the injection point of the additive into the slurry stream. The additive feed system 200<br>
includes two insertion/retraction handles 222 that provide the controls for the longitudinal<br>
position of the turbulator 220, so that when in the undeployed position as shown in Fig. 7, the<br>
handles extend radially outwardly to disconnect the turbulator 220 from the receiving neck<br>
234. Pulling the handles 222 toward the housing 206, as shown in Fig. 6, locks the<br>
turbulator 220 in a direction away from the smaller diameter opening 210, and when<br>
connected within the system 200, toward the additive injection port 186. Pulling said handles<br>
in locks the coupling into position, connecting the housing 206 to receiving neck 234. In this<br>
position, tubular constrictor valve 224, injector nozzle 226, and additive outlet opening 228<br>
extend into receiving neck 234 and position the turbulator 220 for desired delivery of<br>
additives. The turbulator 220 comprises a tubular constrictor valve 224, which is attached to<br>
an injector nozzle 226, having an additive outlet opening 228 at the distal end thereof. The<br>
inner diameter of the injector nozzle 226 may be in a range of from about 3/32 to about 3/16<br>
of an inch (2.38 to 4.75 mm), and preferably is about 1/8 of an inch (3.17 mm) in diameter at<br>
the opening 228. The additive outlet opening preferably has an internal opening diameter<br>
that is much smaller than that of the injector nozzle, and may be in a range of from about 3/32<br>
to about 1/16 of an inch (2.38 to 1.59 mm)<br>
The above-described configuration provides egress of wax emulsion solids at an<br>
appropriate flow rate into the dense slurry layer of between 1 lbs./Msf to about 10 lbs./Msf<br>
where Msf is one thousand square feet. The turbulator delivery pattern, that is, the spray of<br>
additive that is delivered to the dense gypsum slurry 38 may comprise one or more known<br>
patterns that can provide the maximum dispersion of the additive material within the slurry<br>
stream, for example, a flat, conical multiple linear injection, or other appropriate geometrical<br>
pattern capable of injecting the additive materials deep into the slurry stream so as to<br>
effectively mix then thereinto. Thus, although shown having a cylindrical delivery tip in Fig.<br>
7, the delivery tip and additive injection opening 228 may take other forms to provide a<br><br>
different delivery pattern and thereby to achieve optimal additive homogenization in the<br>
slurry stream.<br>
The angle of injection also provides a variable additive injection parameter that can be<br>
optimized for obtaining maximum additive penetration and homogeneity of additive in the<br>
slurry stream.<br>
That is, while the angle shown in Fig. 7 is directly perpendicular to the plane of the<br>
end opening 208 of the housing 206, other injection angles can be used as well, and may take<br>
on either an acute angle relative to the direction of slurry flow, and may be either angled with<br>
or against the flow in a range of from about 1° to about 179° relative to the direction of flow.<br>
Optimally, the angle is very close to perpendicular as shown, but practical adjustments in a<br>
range of from about 70° to about 110° possibly provide desired mixing effects of the additive<br>
materials as these are delivered into the slurry stream. For example, an angle which injects<br>
the additive into the stream at an angle against the flow of the fluid stream so that the mixing<br>
occurs more vigorously. However, this may not be desirable in some instances, for example,<br>
if it is not desirable to inject the additive material counter to the slurry stream so as to avoid<br>
excessive agitation or to avoid disturbing the slurry flow. In such a case, it may be preferred<br>
to angle the additive injection direction with the flow of the slurry stream and have the<br>
additive be mixed into the slurry by natural agitation during delivery and spending of the<br>
dense slurry 38 over the mats 14,114 or alternatively, over paper facing.<br>
The turbulator 220 has not been generally utilized for providing additive injection into<br>
the slurry of a gypsum board line during the manufacturing process of gypsum board. Thus,<br>
although such turbulator nozzles are available commercially, for example, from Spraying<br>
Systems, Co. of Wheaton, Illinois, available as Part No. 1/8HH-SS8W, these types of<br>
turbulators have not been made nor used for dispersion of additives directly into a flowing<br>
slurry stream. The aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 4,378,405 to Pilgrim, for example,<br>
teaches a surface modifying additive such as water-proofing agents, in the form of synthetic<br>
resins, to be sprayed onto the glass mat fabric or web, but this suggestion does not necessarily<br>
result in the desired additive on the surface of the gypsum board product, especially if the mat<br>
is essentially encased in the gypsum, as is taught in the aforementioned parent U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,524,679. Others teach the dispersion of the additive in the core gypsum slurry as well<br>
as the surface layers in equal propositions, thus failing to provide the targeted additive<br>
delivery to specific layers.<br>
As an example of the targeted delivery of the wax emulsion additive described above,<br>
it has been found that mixing a first batch of additive to the gypsum slurry mixture in pin<br><br>
mixer 30 in the ration of, for example, 60 lbs./Msf Additive wax emulsion per batch of slurry<br>
mixture, and adding 5 lbs. Additional wax emulsion directly to the dense slurry mixtures 38,<br>
138 at the pipes 34,134, as described above, will result in lesser water resistance<br>
characteristics in the core layer, but in much greater water resistance in the two surface layers<br>
of gypsum that encase the fiber mats 14,114, because of the smaller proportion of dense<br>
slurry to core slurry that is delivered to the gypsum board line. This results in a product that<br>
is lighter in weight, and is significantly better able to repel water or moisture from the surface<br>
layers, where this property is most needed, than is a standard, non-targeted process that<br>
would utilize additive in the amount of 70 lbs. Per batch evenly spread across all three layers.<br>
Referring again to Figs. 6 and 7, the configuration shown provides for the tip 2 of<br>
nozzle 226, including additive outlet opening 228, to be flush with the inside wall of the pipe<br>
34, In this way, the turbulator 220 does not disturb the slurry stream, but nevertheless injects<br>
the additive (wax emulsion) into the slurry 38 as it is transported therethrough. Because of<br>
the continual fluid pressure provided by the pump 198, a vortex of additive wax emulsion is<br>
produced in the slurry stream which ensures more even mixing. Moreover, use of a positive<br>
displacement pump, so as to avoid pulsations in the additive delivery, produces more even<br>
mixing results.<br>
However, the position of the nozzle tip may also be more actively disposed to extend<br>
beyond the inner surface of the wall of the pipe 34, and the additive outlet opening 228 is<br>
disposed in the slurry stream and so to inject the additive more forcefully into slurry mix to<br>
obtain a more robust mixing. However, care must be taken to avoid damage to the nozzle<br>
226, since the gypsum slurry is being transported very rapidly through the pipe 34. This<br>
configuration may be used together with the angled nozzle, described above, in which the<br>
nozzle tip is angled at an acute angle with the flow of the gypsum slurry, so as to minimize<br>
the risk of damage.<br>
The quick connect coupling 210 is attached at the narrowed 209 of the housing 206 to<br>
the nut 204, and at the distal larger end 208 to the receiving neck 234, shown as a hexagonal<br>
housing, but capable of being almost any geometrical shape. When attaching the additive<br>
delivery system 200, care must be taken so that the nozzle 226 is not damaged. Once the<br>
housing 206 is in place and engaged with the receiving neck 234, the handles 222 are rotated<br>
in the upward direction, which locks the system in place. Simultaneously, the locking action<br>
of the handles 222 also extends the nozzle 226 downwardly toward the pipe 34 until the<br>
nozzle additive output opening 228 is flush with the inner wall surface of the pipe 34. The<br>
port 186 is enclosed by a port enclosure 236 that is connected onto the pipe to hermetically<br><br>
seal the port 186, preferably by welding or other appropriate means. An optional nut 238,<br>
and a transitional pipe connector 239 are shown in Fig. 6, but these are not necessary if a<br>
dedicated additive port 186 is provided in the gypsum board line.<br>
Additional modifications are also possiblein the event that a dedicated additive outlet<br>
port 186 is provided. For example, vanes (not shown) or other means may be attached to the<br>
inner wall of pipe 34 or to the end of the nozzle 226, for directing the flow of gypsum slurry<br>
around the outlet port 186 so as to avoid fluid pressure of the moving gypsum slurry stream<br>
being directed onto the nozzle, which because of its shape and size may be then better able to<br>
withstand that pressure.<br>
It is advantageous and preferable that the additive be applied within the dense gypsum<br>
slurry so as to avoid further dispersion thereof, for example, if the additive were simply<br>
sprayed over the surface. In such an example, the water film provided over the surface of the<br>
gypsum board at the point in the gypsum board formation process, known in the gypsum<br>
board industry, may further disperse the additive if applied on the surface only. At this point,<br>
there is a measure of control that can be provided over the board manufacturing process by<br>
introducing formulation additives to increase or decrease the speed of recrystallization of the<br>
gypsum form solution or slurry form.<br>
Ideally, either the polymer additive or the wax emulsion in the gypsum slurry solution<br>
may be used to enhance the bonding strength also between the core slurry 44 and the outer<br>
surface dense slurries 38, 138 and between the dense slurry that extends across and through the<br>
mats of the glass fiber facing sheets 14 and 114'. The polymer may be generating a polymer<br>
matrix that extends from the junction of the lower density core slurry and into the dense slurry<br>
layers 38,138, which have penetrated through the sheets 14,114, and to extend to the gypsum<br>
board surface. The polymer matrix is effectively embedded within the gypsum base and<br>
provides a coalescing surface upon which further finishing can be based, e.g., painting or a<br>
water impervious acrylic cover, that may be added at this stage of the finishing process, for<br>
example, by spray coating.<br>
The surface texture of the front face of the completed gypsum board may additionally<br>
include these additives, which as a part of the underlying matrix, help present a smooth dense<br>
layer of gypsum to which other polymeric, e.g., acrylic, compounds can adhere. As the dense<br>
slurry layer cures, for example, in the drying process, it hardens to provide a stiff surface<br>
capable of retaining a load and repelling water. The surface having the polymer additive,<br>
improves water resistance and the other additives may provide specific sites for chemical<br>
adhesion by other polymers. The composition of a water resistant or impervious coating can<br><br>
additionally comprise one or a combination of the following polymeric compounds:<br>
polyacrylamide, polymethylacrylamide, polyvinyidene chloride (PVDC), polyamide, poly<br>
(hexamethylene adipamide), polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyethylene, cellulose acetate,<br>
polyisobutylene, polycarbonate, polypropylene, polystyrene, styrene, butadiene, styrene<br>
butadiene copolymer, polychloroprene, styrene, butadiene (Neoprene®), natural rubber, poly<br>
(2,6 dimethyl pentene oxide), poly (4-methyl-1-pentene) (Teflon®), natural rubber, poly (2,6<br>
dimethyl pentene oxide), poly 4, methyl pentene-1 and polydimethyl siloxane, and may be<br>
used in either or both of the dense slurry layers, and in different concentrations even in the<br>
core gypsum layer.<br>
Testing of the gypsum board products comparing those with the wax emulsion<br>
additive and those without, revealed a significant increase in water resistance, especially<br>
when utilized with other water resistant additives in the core and modified dense gypsum<br>
slurry layers. The testing results of samples indicate an average increase in water resistance<br>
of at least 300%, and certainly, meeting and exceeding the minimum requirements and<br>
standards promulgated by the Canadian Construction Materials Center. The data appears to<br>
provide support to the theory of better dispersion across the complete surface of the board,<br>
thereby enhancing performance of the surface of the dense slurry layer. Additional benefits<br>
may be obtained by varying the wax emulsion or other compounds used, or a combination of<br>
compositions, or varying other parameters such as the solution strength, the application rate<br>
and the time and condones of curing, so as to increase the final gypsum board product's water<br>
resistance and other desirable characteristics.<br>
