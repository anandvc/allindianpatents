Method for oil change, method to exchange tapes of drafting units on a ring spinning, i.e. ring twisting frame, and a device for the application of the method to exchange such tapes.<br>
The invention relates to a method to change oil and a method to exchange tapes of the drafting units on a ring spinning or ring twisting frame according to the preamble of claim 1 and 2 and further it relates to a device for the application of the method to exchange the tapes according to the preamble of claim 3.<br>
In ring spinning or ring twisting frames maintenance work, such as changing the oil at spinning units and exchanging the tapes on the lower rollers at the drafting units, has to be carried out at regular time intervals. That task has to be carried out manually, in that, in order to change the oil at each single spinning unit, first a mechanical locking part on the upper-part of the spindle is being loosened, the upper spindle part is being lifted off and removed, and then the used oil is being suctioned out of the spindle casing and new oil is being filled in. For this the upper spindle part has to be put aside and after the oil change it has to be picked up again, in order to be inserted back into the spindle casing. That task has to be carried out at each spinning unit with a servicing carriage. It is clear that this is very time consuming and for instance for a ring spinning frame with a length of 30 to 40 metres with a total of about 500 spinning units that task will take almost a whole working week for each side of the frame.<br>
The exchange of tapes on the lower rollers of the drafting units of a ring spinning or ring twisting frame is also still carried out manually. For this task first all tapes on the lower roller are cut apart, and the lower rollers have to be lifted out of the support and have to be laid onto a support table, then the new tapes have to be slipped onto the lower rollers and the roller again has to be put back into the<br><br>
support means of the drafting units. Several persons need to be engaged in fulfilling that task within reasonable time.<br>
Both maintenance jobs described above are carried out once per year, thus requiring an interruption in production on a ring spinning or ring twisting frame of at least one to two weeks.<br>
It is therefore the task as object of the invention to provide a method to change oil and a method to exchange tapes, which requires considerably less time and personnel. It is a further object to provide an especially suitable device for the application of both methods.<br>
Said task is being solved by a method with the characteristic features of claim 1 and 2 and by a device with the characteristic features of claim 3.<br>
The method according to the invention to change oil is characterised in that the tube grippers of a doffer beam, as a part of a device for the mutual exchange of a number of tubes, are being placed onto the upper spindle part, that said upper spindle parts are being seized and together with the doffer beam are being lifted off the spindle casings, after which the used oil is being suctioned off with a suction device and new oil is being filled into the spindle casings, and the upper spindle parts, by means of the doffer beam, are being lowered onto the spindle casings.<br>
The method according to the invention to exchange tapes on the lower rollers of the drafting units of ring spinning or ring twisting frames is characterised in that by means of the doffer beam (11), as part of a device for the mutual exchange of a number of tubes, the lower roller (38) is being lifted off and after the engagement of new tapes is again being lowered into its support means.<br><br>
The device according to the invention for the application of the method to exchange tapes is characterised in that on the doffer beam (11), as part of a device for the mutual exchange of the tubes, cantilever arms (30) are being provided which are spaced at certain distances and of which each is being provided with a support element (37) for the lower roller (38).<br>
In practical application it has proved to be particularly suitable if in place of a tube gripper, a respective cantilever arm is being fastened onto the doffer beam, and that the cantilever arm is being formed as a rod with two ring grooves being spaced to each other, into which a support strap is being fitted for the lower roller.<br>
Further advantages of the invention are disclosed by the depending claim and the following description, by which the invention is being disclosed in more detail in connection with an exemplified embodiment, being shown in the accompanying shematical drawings, wherein shows:<br>
figure 1 a doffer beam with a tube gripper on an upper spindle part of a spinning unit, and<br>
figure 2 a doffer beam with a device for lifting a lower roller.<br>
Figure 1 shows an extruded profile of a doffer beam 11 made of aluminium with a feed channel 12 extending in longitudinal direction and with small iron plates or iron rails 46, which, together with permanent magnets 45 and 45.1, form support elements at a tube gripper 14 on a doffer beam 11. Compressed air can be charged and discharged through opening 17 in the feed channel 12 via line 18 to the cylinder-shaped bellows, i.e. membranes 16 within the single grippers 14, whereas the clear width of the bellows 16 can be alternated. Furthermore reference is made to figure 2 and to the pertaining disclosure of the European Patent EP-B-0 308 877, in which the functioning<br><br>
of the tube grippers 14 is being described in more detail. Variants of tube grippers 14 are also being disclosed in said patent/ which however, are not being considered as an object of the present patent application.<br>
With the rubber-elastic bellow 16 of the tube gripper 14 not only tubes, but also the upper spindle parts 20 of the spinning units 22 can be seized in a here not further shown ring spinning or ring twisting frame. Thereby the doffer beam 11 will be carrying out the same movement as for a mutual exchange of full tubes, as is being disclosed in above mentioned European patent. For this, first the mechanical locking part 24, which presses against a flange 26 on the upper spindle part 20, is being released and the respective spindle upper part 20 is slightly lifted. For this task a skilled maintenance person will need about 5 to 10 seconds, so that for one side of the frame with about 500 spinning units, about three quarters of an hour up to one and a half hours are necessary. As soon as all upper spindle parts 20 are released, they are being seized by the tube gripper 14 of the doffer beam 11 and lifted off, so that the spindle casings 28 are accessible and that the used oil 29 can be suctioned off and that new oil can be filled in. This is carried out with a servicing carriage and can be accomplished within 5 to 10 seconds per spinning unit. Thus, the annual oil change on a spinning frame with for instance 1000 spinning units can be carried out within a normal working day. The non-productive time for a spinning frame can thus be reduced by at least the factor 5.<br>
Figure 2 also shows a doffer beam 11 in schematical illustration, whereas at regular spaces the tube grippers 14 have been replaced by cantilever arms 30. The cantilever arm 30 comprises a vertical rod 32 and a horizontal round rod 34 fastened thereto, which on its free end 35 is being provided with two ring grooves 36 being spaced to each other. Into these ring grooves 36 a support strap 37 is being laid, by which the lower roller 38 of an open drafting unit 39 is being lifted.<br><br>
Before this can be done, the tape 40 shown in a dotted line is being cut apart in known manner and the support strap 37 is being put around the lower roller 38. Said lower roller 38 reaches for instance over half of the length of the ring spinning or ring twisting frame and is approximately 20 to 30 m long. In order to evenly distribute the load on the lower roller 38, respective cantilever arms 30 are being provided in spaces of about 2 to 3 meters, so that in total about 10 to 15 cantilever arms 30 are being provided over the whole length of the doffer beam 11.<br>
In practical application the lower roller 38 is being lifted from the doffer beam 11 by means of the cantilever arms 30, after the tapes 40 have been cut apart by a maintenance person and after the support straps 37 have been put around the lower roller 38. In the lifted up position the new tapes are being slipped over the lower roller 38, whereas they can be slided through between the respective support strap 37 and the lower roller 38, until they are placed in the right position. Afterwards the lower roller 38 is being lowered again and being put into the not further shown support means of the drafting units 39 being arranged next to each other. Then the new tapes are being put around the redirecting bridges 41 and 42. These annual maintenance tasks can thus all be carried out by one single person within a considerably shorter time in comparison with the maintenance task being done in the conventional manner.<br>
Normally the doffer beam is being driven electrically, whereas a programmed control is being provided for the drive. For the described manipulation of the upper spindle parts, the lower roller respectively, preferably programmed modules are being furnished with the control unit.<br><br><br>
