				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a bottom support means for Waste Heat Recovery Boiler (WHRB) inlet gas ducting. In particular this invention relates to an improvement in or relating to s supporting means for Waste Heat Recovery Boiler.<br>
The Waste Heat Recovery Boiler inlet duct comprises a bottom duct portion made of stainless steel and a top duct portion made of alloy steel. The bottom duct is connected to the top duct by a plurality of hanger supports having pins and link arrangements at the ends and in the middle of the duct. Diamond shape plates are provided on either sides of the duct for connecting the ducts with each other rigidly.<br>
There? are certain disadvantages associates- with the prior art, such as failure of hanger links, cracking of diamond plate and other supporting elements. Further the maintenance of the conventional supporting means is very high and the provision for on line inspection of critical support elements are not provided with the conventional supporting means.<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention is to propose an improved bottom support means which obviates the disadvantages associated with the prior art.<br>
Acccsrding to this invention there is provided a bottom support for Waste Heat Recovery Boiler having a bottom duct supported means comprising beam/beams adapted to be connected to the main boiler columns such that to transfer the load, a slide bearing plate being secured to said beam at the location where said bottom duct being rested, a vertical buck stay with a beam being provided to connect the duct wall therewith by means of bolts and nuts, said duct wall being connected to a T-bar level bracings through a T-bar stiffeners and a plate member secured therewith.<br>
In accordance with this invention the bottom duct it connected separately by means of bottom supporting arrangement at T-bar lever. The bottom support arrangement comprises beam/beams connected to the main boiler columns for load transfer. A slide bearing plate is attached on the beam at the palce where the bottom duct rests. A duct wall with external insulation is connected with a vertical buck stay with a beam by means of nut and bolts. Another horizontal beam is secured with the vertical buck and rests on the bearing plate.<br>
The horizontal beam is further connected to the duct at the second level by means of interconnecting structure. Plate stiffeners are provided for strengthening the structural members. The constant load hangers (CLH) support arrangement is also provided at the overhang and is provided with a tie rod having the height adjustment arrangements.<br>
A bottom support means for Waste Heat Recovery Boiler inlet gas ducting according to a preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein : —<br>
	Fig.l       shows  the plan view of the  bottom  support<br>
means,<br>
Fig.2 shows the sectional view of the bottom support means,<br>
Fig.3 shows the sectional view along the lines A-A in Fig.2, and<br>
Fig.4 shows the sectional view along the line B—B in Fig.2.<br>
Referring to the drawings (Fig.l) and according to this invention the bottom support means has a bottom duct 2 is disconnected structurally from the top duct 1 and is supported separately by bottom support means at T-bar level 3. The bottom support arrangement as show<br>
in Fig.2 comprises beam/beams 5 connected to the main boiler columns 4 for load transfer. A slide bearing plate 6 is attached on the beam 5 at the locations where the bottom duct 2 rests on slide bearing plate 6 (Fig.3). The duct wall 7 provided with external insulation 8 thereon is rigidly fastened to the vertical buck stay 9 with a beam 1O by means of nut and bolts 11 &amp; 12. A T—bar stiffener 13 is provided with said duct wall 7 having the duct internal bracings 14 which are attached to the duct with a plate member 15 of the suitable thickness. Another horizontal beam 16 is attached to the vertical buck stay 9 and rests on the bearing plate 6. The horizontal beam 16 is also connected to the duct wall at the second level bracing 18 with plate member 15 secured with the T—bar stiffener 13 which is secured to the duct wall 7. An interconnecting structure 19 is provided between the horizontal beam 16 and vertical buck stay 9 such that to provide additional support to the buck stay 9. The structural member 19 is further strengthened with plate stiffeners 2O as per the requirement. Slide means 21 are provided with the vertical buck stay 9 at the second level bracing location such that to accomodate<br>
the duct thermal expansions. The constant load hanger (CLH) support arrangement as shown in Fig.4 is provided at the overhang. The constant load hanger (CLH) support arangement comprises a CLH 22, tie rod with the height adjustment arrangement 23, 24 and 25. Internal bracings 26 of circular or rectangular cross-sectional are provided for load transfer.<br><br><br>
CLAIM:<br>
1.	A bottom support for waste heat recovery boiler  inlet<br>
gas  ducting  having a bottom duct  supporting  means  comprising<br>
beam/beams  adapted  to be connected to the main  boiler  columns<br>
such  that  to  transfer the load, a slide  bearing  plate  being<br>
secured to said beam at the location where said bottom duct being<br>
rested,  a  vertical  buck stay with a  beam  being  provided  to<br>
connect the duct walla therewith by means of bolts and nuts, said<br>
duct wall being connected to a T-bar level bracings through a  T-<br>
bar stiffeners and a plate member secured therewith.<br>
2.	A bottom support as claimed  in claim 1  wherein  said<br>
duct wall is provided  with external insulation.<br>
3.	A bottom support as claimed in claim 1 wherein a  slide<br>
bearing  plate  is provided on said beam/beams  at  the  required<br>
locations such that to transfer the loada.<br>
4.	A  bottom support as claimed in claim 1  wherein  said<br>
bottom support comprises <clh support means having a clh and tie></clh>
rod with the height adjustment arrangement being provided between<br>
the  horizontal  beam and said vertical buck stay  for  providing<br>
additional support to said vertical purpose.<br>
being provided between the horizontal beam and said vertical buck stay for providing additional support to said vertical purpose.<br>
A bottomm supper-bemoans - substantial ly  as  herein x<br>
