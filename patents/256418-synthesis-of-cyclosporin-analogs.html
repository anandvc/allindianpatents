BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0060]	Cyclosporine derivatives compose a class of cyclic polypeptides, consisting of<br>
eleven amino acids, that are produced as secondary metabolites by the fungus species Tolypocladium inflatum Gams. They have been observed to reversibly inhibit immunocompetent lymphocytes, particularly T-lymphocytes, in the Go or G\ phase of the cell cycle. Cyclosporine derivatives have also been observed to reversibly inhibit the production and release of lymphokines (Granelli-Pipemo et al, 1986). Although a number of cyclosporine derivatives are known, cyclosporine A is the most widely used. The suppressive effects of cyclosporine A are related to the inhibition of T-cell mediated activation events. This suppression is accomplished by the binding of cyclosporine to the ubiquitous intracellular protein, cyclophilin. This complex, in turn, inhibits the calcium- and calmodulin-dependent serine-threonine phosphatase activity of the enzyme calcineurm. Inhibition of calcineurin prevents the activation of transcription factors such as NFATp/c and NF-KB, which are necessary for the induction of the cytoldne genes (IL-2, IFN-y, IL-4, and GM-CSF) during T-cell activation. Cyclosporine also inhibits lymphokine production by T-helper cells in vitro and arrests the development of mature CD8 and CD4 cells in the thymus (Granelli-Piperno et al, 1986). Other in vitro properties of cyclosporine include the inhibition of IL-2 producing T-lymphocytes and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, inhibition of IL-2 released by activated T-cells, inhibition of resting T-lymphocytes in response to alloantigen and exogenous lymphokine, inhibition of IL-1 production, and inhibition of mitogen activation of IL-2 producing T-lymphocytes (Granelli-Piperno et al, 1986).<br>
[0061]	Cyclosporine is a potent immunosuppressive agent that has been demonstrated<br>
to suppress humoral immunity and cell-mediated immune reactions such as allograft rejection, delayed hypersensitivity, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, Freund's adjuvant arthritis and graft vs. host disease. It is used for the prophylaxis of organ rejection subsequent to organ transplantation; for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis; for the treatment of psoriasis; and for the treatment of other autoimmune diseases, including type I diabetes, Crohn's disease, lupus, and the like.<br>
[0062]	Since the original discovery of cyclosporin, a wide variety of naturally<br>
occurring cyclosporins have been isolated and identified and many further non-natural<br><br>
cyclosporins have been prepared by total- or semi-synthetic means or by the application of modified culture techniques. The class comprised by the cyclosporins is thus now substantial and includes, for example, the naturally occurring cyclosporins A through Z.[c.f. Traber et al. (1977); Traber et al. (1982); Kobel et al. (1982); and von Wartburg et al. (1986)], as well as various non-natural cyclosporin derivatives and artificial or synthetic cyclosporins including the dihydro- and iso-cyclosporins; derivatized cyclosporins (e.g., in which the 3'-O-atom of the -MeBmt- residue is acylated or a further substituent is introduced at the a-carbon atom of the sarcosyl residue at the 3-position); cyclosporins in which the -MeBmt-residue is present in isomeric form (e.g., inwhichthe.configurationL across positions 6' and 7 of the -MeBmt-residue is cis rather than trans); and cyclosporins wherein variant ainino acids are incorporated at specific positions within the peptide sequence employing, e.g., the total synthetic method for the production of cyclosporins developed by R. Wenger-see e.g. Traber et al. (1977), Traber et al. (1982) and Kobel et al. (1982); U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,108,985, 4,210,581,4,220,641,4,288,431,4,554,351 and 4,396,542; European Patent Publications Nos. 0 034 567 and 0 056 782; International Patent Publication No. WO 86/02080; Wenger (1983); Wenger (1985); and Wenger (1986). Cyclosporin A analogues containing modified amino acids in the 1 -position are reported by Rich et al. (1986). Immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, and anti-parasitic cyclosporin A analogues are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,384,996; 4,771,122; 5,284,826; and 5,525,590, all assigned to Sandoz. Additional cyclosporin analogues are disclosed in WO 99/18120, assigned to Isotechnika. The terms Ciclosporin, ciclosporin, cyclosporine, and Cyclosporine are interchangeable and refer to cyclosporin.<br>
[0063]	There are numerous adverse effects associated with cyclosporine A therapy,<br>
including nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, cataractogenesis, hirsutism, parathesis, and gingival hyperplasia to name a few (Sketris et al., 1995). Of these, nephrotoxicity is one of the more serious, dose-related adverse effects resulting from cyclosporine A administration. Immediate-release cyclosporine A drug products (e.g., Neoral® and Sandimmune®) can cause nephrotoxicities and other toxic side effects due to their rapid release and the absorption of high blood concentrations of the drug. It is postulated that the peak concentrations of the drug are associated with the side effects (Bennett, 1998). The exact mechanism by which cyclosporine A causes renal injury is not known; however, it is proposed that an increase in the levels of vasoconstrictive substances in the kidney leads to the vasoconstriction of the<br><br>
afferent glomerular arterioles. This can result in renal ischemia, a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and, over the long term, interstitial fibrosis. When the dose is reduced or another irnrnunosuppressive agent is substituted, renal function improves (Valantine and Schroeder, 1995).<br>
[0064]	Accordingly, there is a need for immunosuppressive agents which are<br>
effective and have reduced toxicity.<br>
[0065]	Cyclosporin analogs containing modified amino acids in the 1-position are<br>
disclosed in WO 99/18120, which is assigned to the assignee of the present application, and incorporated herein in its entirety. Also assigned to the present assignee is U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/346,201, in which applicants disclosed a particularly preferred cyclosporin A analog referred to as "ISATX247." This analog is structurally identical to cyclosporin A except for modification at the 1-amino acid residue. Applicants discovered that certain mixtures of cis and trans isomers of ISArx247 exhibited a combination of enhanced potency, and/or reduced toxicity over the naturally occurring and presently known cyclosporins. Certain alkylated, arylated, and deuterated derivatives of ISArx247 were also disclosed.<br>
[0066]	Typically, the disclosed mixtures in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.<br>
60/346,201 range from about 10 to 90 percent by weight of the trans-isomer and about 90 to 10 percent by weight of the os-isomer, in another embodiment, the mixture contains about 15 to 85 percent by weight of the trans-isomer and about 85 to 15 percent of the cis-isomer; in another embodiment, the mixture contains about 25 to 75 percent by weight of the trans-isomer and about 75 to 25 percent by weight of the cir-isomer; in another embodiment, the mixture contains about 35 to 65 percent by weight of the trans-isomer and about 65 to 35 percent by weight of the cw-isomer; in another embodiment, the mixture contains about 45 to 55 percent by weight of the trans-isomer and about 55 to 45 percent of the cis-isomer. In another embodiment, the isomeric mixture is an ISArx247 mixture which comprises about 45 to 50 percent by weight of the trans-isomer and about 50 to 55 percent by weight of the cis-isomer. These percentages by weight are based on the total weight of the composition. In other words, a mixture might contain 65 percent by weight of the (E)-isomer and 35 percent<br><br>
by weight of the (Z)-isomer, or vice versa. In an alternate nomenclature, the m-isomer may also be described as a (Z)-isomer, and the trans-isomer could also be called an (E)-isomer.<br>
[0067]	Accordingly, there is a need in the art for methods of preparation of<br>
cyclosporin analogs, including isomers of ISATX247. Synthetic pathways are needed that produce enriched compositions of the individual isomers, as well mixtures of the isomers having a desired ratio of the two isomers. Methods of preparation of derivatives of ISAi%247 are needed as well.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0068]	Cyclosporine and its analogs are members of a class of cyclic polypeptides<br>
having potent immunosuppressant activity. Despite the advantages these drugs offer with respect to their immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, and anti-parasitic activities, there are numerous adverse effects associated with cyclosporine A therapy that include nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. Accordingly, there is a need for new immunosuppressive agents that are as pharmacologically active as the naturally occurring compound cyclosporin A, but without the associated toxic side effects.<br>
[0069]	Embodiments of the present invention provide certain mixtures of cis and<br>
trans-isomsrs of cyclosporin A analogs, which are pharmaceutically useful. A preferred analog is referred to as ISAJX247. Mixtures of ISATX247 isomers exhibit a combination of enhanced potency and reduced toxicity over the naturally occurring and presently known cyclosporins.<br>
[0070]	The present invention is based in part on the discovery that certain isomeric<br>
mixtures of analogues of cyclosporine provide superior immunosuppressive effects without the adverse effects associated with cyclosporine A. In particular, we have unexpectedly found that isomeric mixtures (i.e., mixtures of both cis- and trans- isomers) ranging from about 10:90 to about 90:10 (trans- to cis-) of cyclosporine analogues modified at the 1-amino acid residue provide superior efficacy and safety. Examples of such analogues are disclosed in WO 99/18120, and include deuterated and non-deuterated compounds. In particular,<br><br>
mixtures in the range of about 45:55 to about 50:50 (trans- to cis-) and in the range of about 50% to about 55% trans- and about 45% to about 50% cis- are found to be particularly efficacious. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that these isomer mixtures exhibit a combination of superior potency and reduced toxicity over naturally occurring and other presently known cyclosporines and cyclosporine derivatives.<br>
[0071]	A particularly preferred analogue (referred to herein as "ISATX247") is<br>
structurally similar to cyclosporine A except for a modified functional group .on the periphery of the molecule, at the 1-amino acid residue. The structure of this particular isomeric analogue mixture compared to the structure of cyclosporine A is shown in FIGS. 1A, IB, 2A, 2B.<br>
[0072]	The isomeric mixtures can be used, among other things, for<br>
immunosuppression, and the care of various immune disorders, diseases and conditions, including the prevention, control, alleviation and treatment thereof. .<br>
[0073]	According to embodiments of the present invention, ISATX247 isomers (and<br>
derivatives thereof) are synthesized by stereoselective pathways that may vary in their degree of selectivity. Stereoselective pathways produce compositions that are enriched in either of the (E) and (Z)-isomers, and these compositions may be combined such that the resulting mixture has a desired ratio of the two isomers. Alternatively, the reactions conditions of a stereoselective pathway may be tailored to produce the desired ratio directly in a prepared mixture. The percentage of one isomer or another in a mixture can be verified using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) or other techniques well known in the art.<br>
[0074]	Each of the pathways typically proceeds with the application of a protecting<br>
group to a sensitive alcohol functional group. In one embodiment the alcohol is protected as an acetate; in other embodiments the protecting groups are benzoate esters or silyl ethers. Although acetate protecting groups are common in the art, it is important to emphasize that in many of the exemplary embodiments described herein certain undesirable side-reactions involving an acetate protecting group may be avoided through the use of protecting groups such as benzoate esters or silyl ethers.<br><br>
[0075]	The protected compound may then serve as a precursor for a variety of<br>
stereoselective synthetic pathways including some that utilize phosphorus-containing reagents as participants in a Wittig reaction, and inorganic elements as members of organometallic reagents. The latter type may proceed through six-membered ring transition states where steric hindrance dictates the configurational outcome. Many organometallic reagents are available, including those that feature inorganic elements such as boron, silicon, titanium, lithium, and sulfur. Individual isomers may be prepared from single or multiple precursors.<br>
[0076]	The ratio of the (E) to (Z)-isomers in any mixture, whether produced<br>
stereoselectively or non-stereoselectively, may take on a broad range of values. For example, the mixture may comprise from about 10 to 90 percent of the (E)-isomer to about 90 to 10 percent of the (Z)-isomer. In other embodiments, the mixture may contain from about 15 to 85 percent by weight of the (E)-isomer and about 85 to 15 percent of the (Z)-isomer; in another embodiment, the mixture contains about 25 to 75 percent by weight of the (E)-isomer and about 75 to 25 percent by weight of the (Z)-isomer; in another embodiment, the mixture contains about 35 to 65 percent by weight of the (E)-isomer and about 65 to 35 percent by weight of the (Z)-isomer; in another embodiment, the mixture contains about 45 to 55 percent by weight of the (E)-isomer and about 55 to 45 percent of the (Z)-isomer. In another embodiment, the isomeric mixture is an ISATX247 mixture which comprises about 45 to 50 percent by weight of the (E)-isomer and about 50 to 55 percent by weight of the (Z)-isomer. These percentages by weight are based on the total weight of the composition, and it will be understood that the sum of the weight percent of the (E)-isomer and the (Z)-isomer is 100 weight percent. In other words, a mixture might contain 65 percent by weight of the (E)-isomer and 35 percent by weight of the (Z)-isomer, or vice versa.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Synthesis<br>
[00107]	Cyclosporin and its analogs are members of a class of cyclic polypeptides<br>
having potent immunosuppressive activity. Despite the advantages these drugs offer with respect to their immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, and anti-parasitic activities, there are numerous adverse effects associated with cyclosporine A therapy mat include nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. Accordingly, there is a need for new immunosuppressive agents mat are as pharmacologically active as the naturally occurring compound cyclosporin A, but without the associated toxic side effects.<br>
[00108]	Applicants have previously disclosed a cyclosporin A analog referred to as<br>
'1SATX247." This analog is structurally similar to cyclosporin A except for modification at the 1-amino acid residue. Applicants discovered that certain mixtures of cis and trans-isomers of ISArx247 exhibited a combination of enhanced potency, and reduced toxicity, over the naturally occurring and presently known cyclosporins.<br>
[00109]	According to embodiments of the present invention, ISArx247 isomers (and<br>
derivatives thereof) are synthesized by stereoselective pathways that may vary in their degree of stereoselectivity. Stereoselective pathways produce compositions that are enriched in either of the (E) and (Z)-isomers, and these compositions may be combined such that the resulting mixture has a desired ratio of the two isomers. Alternatively, the reaction conditions of a stereoselective pathway may be tailored to produce the desired ratio directly in a prepared mixture.<br>
[00110]         The chemical name of one immunosuppresive cyclosporin analog of the present invention, called ISArx247, is chemically described by the name cyclo{{E^)-(2S,3R,4R)-3-hydroxy-4-memyl-2-(memylammo)-6,8-nonadienoyl}-L-2-aminobutyryl-N-methyl-glycyl-N-methyl-L-Leucyl-L-valyl-N-methyl-L-leucyl-L-alanyl-D-alanyl-N-methyl-L-leucyl-N-methyl-L-leucyl-N-methyl-L-valyl}. Its empirical formula is C63H111N11O12, and<br><br>
it has a molecular weight of about 1214.85. The term "ISArx247" is a trade designation given to this pharmacologically active compound.<br>
[00111]	The structure of IS ATX247 has been verified primarily through nuclear<br>
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Both the !H and 13C spectra were assigned using a series of one and two dimensional NMR experiments, and by comparison to the known NMR assignments for cyclosporin A. The absolute assignment of the (E) and (Z)-isomers of ISATX247 was confirmed by Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) experiments. Additional supporting evidence was provided by mass spectral analysis, which confirmed the molecular weight, and by the infrared spectrum, which was found to be very similar to cyclosporin A. The latter result was expected, given the similarity between the two compounds.<br>
[00112]	The structure of cyclosporin A is illustrated in FIG. 1 A. The structure<br>
includes identification of the 11 amino acid residues that comprise the cyclic peptide ring of the molecule. These 11 amino acid residues are labeled with numbers increasing in a clockwise direction, starting with the amino acid shown at the top center of the ring (and identified with reference label "1-amino acid"). The first amino acid is enclosed in a dashed box for clarity. The side chain of the 1-amino acid residue has been drawn out chemically since it is at this general location that the synthetic reactions described herein take place. Conventionally, the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group of an amino acid is labeled as the a-carbon, with progressive letters in the Greek alphabet used to label adjacent carbons in a direction down the chain, away from the peptide ring. In the case of cyclosporin A, as shown in FIG. 1 A, the p-carbon of the side chain is bonded to a hydroxyl group, and there is a trans-oriented double bond between the e and ^-carbons of the side chain.<br>
[00113]	Another schematic of the cyclosporin A structure is drawn in FIG. IB, where a<br>
different portion of the molecule has been enclosed in a dashed box. This figure defines the nomenclature to be used in the present description, where the term "CsA" refers to the portion of the cyclosporin A enclosed in the box. The present nomenclature provides a shorthand means of displaying the region where the synthetic reactions described herein will take place (i.e., the side chain of the 1-amino acid residue, which has been drawn outside the dashed box in FIG. IB), without having to re-draw the remainder of the molecule each time a, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , <br><br><br><br><br><br>
