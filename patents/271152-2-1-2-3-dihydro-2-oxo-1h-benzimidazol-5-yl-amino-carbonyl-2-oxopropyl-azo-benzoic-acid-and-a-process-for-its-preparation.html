2-l[1-[[(2,3-Dihydro-2-oxo-1H-benzimidazol-5-yl)amino]carbonyl]-2-oxopropyI]azo]-benzoic acid and a process for its preparation<br>
the    present   invention    is    directed    to    2-[[1-[[(2,3-dihydro-2-oxo-1H-benzimidazol-5-l)amino]carbonyl]-2-oxopropyllazol-benzoicacid {C.I. Pigment Yellow 151)<br>
  , characterized by a E' (black/white) in masstone below 22.0 ± 0.7, a process for its preparation and its use for pigmenting macromotecular organic naterials of natural or synthetic origin. The pigment has high opacity and high color strength.<br>
JS-A-4,024,124 describes monoazo acetoacetylaminobenzimidazolone pigments containing carboxy group. In example 1 the preparation of C.I, Pigment Yellow 151 is disclosed. The crude pigment obtained by coupling in an aqueous medium is dried after isolation, powdered, refluxed for 2 hours in glacial acetic acid, suction-filtered, washed and dried. A pigment of soft grain, good tinctorial strength and dear shade is obtained in this manner.<br>
US-A-4,906,735 discloses an improved process for the manufacture of C.I. Pigment Yellow 151 by coupling the components in an aqueous medium in the presence of an oxethylation product of an alcohol or alcohol mixture having from 8 to 14 carbon atoms and 3 to 10 mols of ethylene oxide, and heating the aqueous pigment suspension after complete coupling. The pigment thus obtained avoids an after-treatment in anhydrous organic solvents. The pigment is obtained in a fornn, which can be compared with that of example 1 of US-A-4,042,124.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a novel 2-[t1-[[(2,3-dihydro-2-oxo-1 H-benzimidazol-5-yl)aminolcarbonyl]-2-oxopropyl]azo]-benzoic acid (C.I. Pigment Yellow 151) having unique and surprising color characteristics.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to 2-[[1-[[(2,3-dihydro-2-oxo-1H-benzimidazoi-5-y()amino]carbony(]-2-oxopropyl]azo]-benzoic acid (C.I. Pigment Yellow 151);<br><br><br>
The color strength of the compound (pigment) is 6 to 55 %, especially 10 to 36 % higher than the color strength of Hostaperm® Yellow H4G (Clariant AG) as standard in white reduction (5:95).<br>
The 2-[[1-[I{2,3-dihydro-2-oxo-1H-benz!midazol-5-yI)amino]carbonyl]-2-oxopropyllazo]-benzoic acid having an essentially cubic to cuboidal particle shape with an average particle size (D50 %) in the range of 0.30 to 0.45 µm, especially below 0.40, very especially in the range of 0.34 to 0.39 measured by Joyce Ldbl disc centrifuge and a specific surface area (BET) in the range of 20 to 25 m2/g shows high opacity and high color strength and excellent weatherability behavior. As shown by electron microscopy, the average aspect ratio of length to width and/or height is below 1:2.5 with respect to the majority of the particles.<br>
FIG. 1 is a transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of Hostaperm® Yellow H4G (Clariant AG; 2-[[1-[[(2,3-dihydro-2-oxo-1H-benzimidazol-5-yl)amino]carbonyl]-2-oxopropyl]a2o]-benzoic acid; C.[. Pigment Yellow 151).<br>
FIG. 2 is a TEM of 2-[p-[[(2,3-dihydro-2-oxo-1H-benzimidazo!-5-yt)arninD]carbonylJ-2-oxopropyl]a2o]-benzoic acid (C.I. Pigment Yellow 151) according to the present invention.<br>
As evident from the TEMs the pigment of the present invention has a cubic, or cuboidal particle form, whereas Hostapemi® Yellow H4G has a more rod-like particle fomn.<br>
The CLE. color space values of the pigment of the present invention in masstone measured as described in Application Example 1b are L* = 83.9 - 85.6, especially 84,3 - 85,6, C* = 86.1 -90.1, especially 86.3-90.1, h = 86.4 - 88.4, especially 86.6 - 88.4.<br>
The CLE. color space values of the pigment of the present invention in white reduction<br><br>
(5:95) measured as described in Application Example 1c are L* = 32.6 - 93.4, C- = 42,7-50.9, h= 96.9-98.3.<br>
In addition, the invention provides a process for the manufacture of the compound of the<br><br>
by coupling of diazotized anthranilic acid (1-aminobenzene-2-carboxylic acid) with 5-acetoacetylamino-benzimidazolone in an aqueous medium followed by a themial after-treatment, wherein the thermal after-treatment is carried out at a pH above 5.5,<br>
The thermal after-treatment is especially carried out at a pH of from 6.0 - 7,3, very especially B,5-7.3,<br>
Advantageously, the preferably aqueous solutions or suspensions of the starting materials are fed to the reactor coniinuous}y. subsequently, or simultaneously and preferably in equivalent amounts. The classic process assistants such as resins, surfactants and other additives may likewise be used in the process of the invention.<br>
The starting material for the diazotization reaction is anthranilic acid (1-aminobenzene-2-carboxylic acid).<br>
The coupling component is 5-acetoacetylamino-benzimidazolone.<br>
The azo coupling is preferably carried out in aqueous solution, but it is also possible to use organic solvents, if appropriate mixed with water, for example aromatic hydrocarbons, hydrochlorocarbons, glycol ethers, nitriles, esters, dimethylformamide, tetramethylurea and N-methylpyrroiidone.<br>
Diazotizations are carried out at temperatures of-15 to +80 °C, preferably-12 to +10 X, and azo couplings at-10 to 90 °C, preferably at-5 to 40 °C,<br><br>
The diazotisation is carried out, for example, with a nitrite, for example an alkali metal nitrite, such as sodium nitrite, in a medium containing a mineral acid, for example in a medium containing hydrochloric acid, generally at temperatures of from -15 to80C, preferably from -12 to 10°C. Excess nitrite is destroyed with standard scavengers such as urea or sulfamic acid.<br>
The coupling to the coupling component is effected in a manner known per se, at acidic or neutral to weakly alkaline pH values, for example a pH value of from 1 to 8, and tempera¬tures of, for example, from -10 to 90oC, preferably from -5 to 40X.<br>
To carry out the azo coupling reaction according to the invention, a solution or suspension of the diazonium salt and a solution or suspension of the coupling component can be continuously, subsequently, or simultaneously introduced into a reactor and continuously mixed with each other therein and reacted.<br>
The process according to the invention is advantageously carried out by slowly adding a solution or suspension of the coupling component, especially a basic solution or suspension of the coupling component to a freshly prepared solution or suspension of the diazotised compound. After the reaction is almost completed, the pH is maintained in the neutral range, for example at from pH 4.5 to 8, especially 4.5 to 7.0, very especially 6.1 to 7.0 by addition of an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solution, such as sodium hydroxide solution. The resulting pigment suspension is stirred until the reaction is complete followed by the thermal aftertreatment. The product is isolated by filtration. The obtained presscake is dried in an oven with or without vacuum and finally pulverized or pulverized and sieved.<br>
For both the diazotization and the azo coupling, the reactant solutions may be admixed with buffer solutions, preferably of organic acids and salts thereof, for example acetic acid/acetate buffer, citric acid/citrate buffer, or of inorganic acids and salts thereof, for example phosphoric acid/phosphate or carbonic acid/carbonate.<br>
Advantageously, sodium dihydrogenphosphate, or sodium acetate is added to the diazo solution before the coupling reaction.<br>
After termination of the addition the pigment suspension is optionally diluted with water and heated for 1 to 24 hours, especially 6 to 15 hours at a temperature above SO^C, especially of<br><br>
from 90 to 110 °C, very especially 98 to 102 "C at a pH above 5.5, especially 6.0 - 7.3. very especially 6.5 - 7.3. The pH is adjusted by addition of an acid, especially a weal

The pigment prepared according to the invention is useful for dyeing or printing hydroxyl-containing or nitrogenous natural organic and also synthetic substrates. Such substrates include for example synthetic or natural fiber materials and also leather materials comprising predominantly natural or regenerated cellulose or natural or synthetic polyamides. It is particularly useful for dyeing and printing textile material based on acetate, polyester, polyamide, polyacrylonitrile, PVC and polyurethane fibers and also wool or in particular cotton. To this end, the pigment can be applied to the textile materials by the usual exhaust, padding or printing processes.<br>
The pigment of the invention is useful as colorant in electrophotographic toners and developers, for example one- or two-component powder toners (also known as one- or two-component developers), magnet toners, liquid toners, latex toners, polymerization toners and also specialty toners.<br>
Typical toner binders are addition polymerization, polyaddition and polycondensation resins, such as styrene. styrene-acrylate, styrene-butadiene, acrylate, polyester, phenol-epoxide resins, polysulfones, polyurethanes, individually or in combination, and also polyethylene and polypropylene, which may each include further ingredients, such as charge control agents, waxes or flow assistants, or are subsequently modified with these additives. The pigment of the invention is further useful as colorant in powders and powder coatings, especially in triboelectrically or electrokinetically sprayable powder coatings used for surface coating of objects composed for example of metal, wood, plastic, glass, ceramic, concrete. textile material, paper or rubber.<br>
Powder coating resins used are typically epoxy resins, carboxyl- and hydroxyl-containing polyester resins, polyurethane and acrylic resins together with customary hardeners. Combinations of resins are also used. For instance, epoxy resins are frequently used in combination with carboxyl- and hydroxyl-containing polyester resins.

and also dicyandiamide and derivatives thereof, capped isocyanates, bisacylurethanes,<br>
phenolic and melamine resins, trigtycidyl isocyanurates, oxazoljnes and dicarboxylic acids.<br>
The pigment of the invention is also useful as colorant in inks, preferably Inkjet inks, for<br>
example on an aqueous or nonaqueous basis, microemulsion inks and also in such inks as<br>
operate according to the hot-melt principle.<br>
Inkjet inks generally include a total of 0.5 to 15% by weight, preferably 1.5 to 8% by weight,<br>
(reckoned dry) of one or more of the compounds according to the invention. Microemulsion<br>
inks are based on organic solvents and water with or without an additional hydrotropic<br>

Solvent based Inkjet inks preferably include 0.5 to 15% by weight of one or more compounds<br>
according to the invention, 85 to 99.2% by weight of organic solvent and^or hydrotropic<br>
compounds.<br>
Hot-melt inks are based mostly on waxes, fatty acids, fatly alcohols or sulfonamides that are<br>
solid at room temperature and liquefy on heating, the preferred melting range lying between<br>
about 60 "C and about 140 °C. Hot-melt Inkjet inks consist essentially for example of 20 to<br>
90% by weight of wax and 1 to 10% by weight of one or more of the compounds according to<br>
the invention. They may further include 0 to 20% by weight of an additional polymer (as "dye<br>
solvent"), 0 to 5% by weight of dispersant, 0 to 20% by weight of viscosity modifier, 0 to 20%<br>
by weight of plasticizer, 0 to 10% by weight of tack additive, Oto 10% by weight of<br>
transparency stabilizer (prevents crystallization of waxes, for example) and also 0 to 2% by<br>
weight of antioxidant. Typical additives and assistants are described for example in US-A-<br>
