				<td>MOUNTING STRUCTURE OF A PLASTIC SHEET FOR A VEHICULAR<br>
EXTERIOR COMPONENT<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to mounting structures of a plastic sheet for a vehicular exterior component, in which the plastic sheet is mounted together with a reinforcing sheet on a body panel of a vehicle using mounting clips, and more particularly to a mounting structure that lends itself to mounting a large plastic sheet for a vehicular exterior component.<br>
The "mounting structure of a plastic sheet for a vehicular exterior component" will hereinaiiter be referred to simply as "mounting structure" as appropriate.<br>
In recent years, most vehicular exterior components such as bumpers, air dam skirts, and tailgate garnishes arc designed integrally with a body and formed of thermoplastic resin such as polypropylene in one piece. The plastic sheets for use with these vehicular exterior components would be subject to alteration of shape due to deformation caused by a thermal expansion or contraction under high temperature conditions, and could thereby mar its beautifully designed appearance. Therefore, the plastic sheet for a vehicular exterior component is typically mounted on a body panel with a reinforcing sheet such as a steel frame attached thereto.<br>
In order to mount the plastic sheet for a vehicular exterior component together with the reinforcing sheet on the body panel, a known mounting clip, of which a distal end has a pair of resilient stoppers shaped like an arrowhead, and a proximal end has a flange, is used customarily. In a conventional mounting structure utilizing such a mounting clip, a plurality of mounting holes are formed in both of the plastic sheet and that reinforcing sheet in such a manner that the mounting holes arranged in these sheets<br><br>
may exactly correspond with each other. A plurality of mounting clips are inserted in the mounting holes, and thus the reinforcing sheet is fixed on the plastic sheet. Similarly, the reinforcing sheet fixed on the plastic sheet is further fixed on the body panel by inserting another set of the mounting clips in a plurality of mounting holes formed in both of the reinforcing sheet and the body panel in such a manner that the mounting holes made in these sheets may exactly correspond with each other. Accordingly, the plastic sheet for a vehicular exterior component is mounted together with the reinforcing sheet on the body panel.<br>
In such a conventional mounting structure as described above, a first mounting structure for fixing the reinforcing sheet on the plastic sheet and a second mounting structure for further fixing on the body panel of the vehicle the reinforcing sheet fixed on the plastic sheet are provided separately, and thus two sets of mounting clips are required: one for the first mounting structure; the other for the second mounting structure.  Moreover, the reinforcing sheet needs to include two sets of the mounting holes: one for the first mounting structure; the other for the second mounting structure. That is, the conventional mounting structure would disadvantageous^ require a great number of mounting clips to be used and a great number of process steps (and man-hours) to  be performed,  thus making  the  structure  complicate,  and  lowering workability of mounting operation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, it is an exemplified general object of the present invention to provide a mounting structure of a plastic sheet for a vehicular exterior component, which is improved  workability of mounting operation.<br><br>
In order to achieve the above object, there is provided a mounting structure of a plastic sheet for a vehicular exterior component according to one exemplified aspect of the present invention (as set forth in claim 1).   In this mounting structure, the plastic sheet is mounted together with a reinforcing sheet on a body panel with a mounting clip.  The mounting clip is shaped like a column having an arrowhead-shaped elastic stopper formed at a distal end thereof, a first engageable groove and a second engageable groove formed on side surfaces of a base portion near a proximal end thereof, and a flange formed on the side surfaces in a midsection thereof.  The plastic sheet includes a first cutaway opening a periphery of which engages with the first engageable groove when the base portion of the mounting clip slides into the first cutaway opening.    The reinforcing sheet includes a second cutaway opening a periphery of which engages with the second engageable groove when the base portion of the mounting clip slides into the second cutaway opening. The body panel includes a fixing hole a periphery of which is held between the elastic stopper and the flange when the elastic stopper formed at the distal end of the mounting clip is inserted in the fixing hole.<br>
With this mounting structure according to the first exemplified aspect of the present invention, first, the reinforcing sheet is superposed on the back of the plastic sheet, and the base portion of the mounting clip is placed at open sides of the first cutaway opening of the plastic sheet and  the second cutaway opening of the reinforcing sheet,    Then, the first engageable groove and the second engageable groove are positioned at the peripheries of the first cutaway opening and the second cutaway opening, respectively. Subsequently, the base portion of the mounting clip is slid toward the first and second cutaway openings, and the first and second engageable grooves are engaged with the peripheries of the first and second cutaway openings. Next, the elastic stopper formed at the distal end of the mounting clip that projects<br><br>
from the reinforcing sheet is inserted into the fixing hole from the outside of the body panel, so that the periphery of the fixing hole is held between the elastic stopper of the mounting clip and the flange. Through a simple operation process as described above, the reinforcing sheet is fixed on the plastic sheet with the mounting clip, and the reinforcing sheet is fixed on the body panel with the same mounting clip; consequently, the plastic sheet for a vehicular exterior component is mounted together with the reinforcing sheet on the body panel.<br>
A mounting structure of a plastic sheet for a vehicular exterior component according to another aspect of the present invention (as set forth in claim 2) is the same mounting structure as described above except further including the following features: the first cutaway opening, the second cutaway opening, and the fixing bole are formed at a plurality of corresponding spots in the plastic sheet, the reinforcing sheet, and the body panel, respectively; and the first cutaway openings and the second cutaway openings are formed to orient in nonparalle) directions so that the first direction in which the base portions of the mounting clips slide to fit into some of the first and second cutaway openings formed at some of the spots is not parallel to the second direction in which the base portions of the mounting clips slide to fit into the others of the first and second cutaway openings formed at the others of the spots.<br>
With this mounting structure according to the second exemplified aspect of the present invention, the plastic sheet for a vehicular exterior component is mounted together with the reinforcing sheet on the body panel with a plurality of the mounting clips used at a plurality of the spots, following the same operation process as undergone for implementing the mounting structure according to the first aspect of the present invention. Once the three components are fastened together, one relative direction in which some of the first and second cutaway openings may slide with respect to the base portions of the mounting clips is not parallel to the other relative<br><br>
direction in which the others of the first and second cutaway openings may slide with respect to the base portions of the mounting clips: therefore, the plastic sheet and the reinforcing sheet are restrained from sliding and shifting relative to the base portions of the mounting clips. Consequently, the plastic sheet is securely mounted together with the reinforcing sheet on the door panel.<br>
A mounting structure of a plastic sheet for a vehicular exterior component according to yet another aspect of the present invention (as set forth in claim 3) is a mounting structure in which the plastic sheet is mounted together with a reinforcing sheet on a body panel with a mounting clip.   The mounting clip is shaped like a column having an arrowhead-shaped elastic stopper formed at a distal end thereof, a first engageable groove and a second engageable groove formed on side surfaces of a base portion near a proximal end thereof, and a flange formed on the side surfaces in a midsection thereof. The plastic sheet includes a first fixing hole a periphery of which engages with the first engageable groove when the elastically deformable base portion of the mounting clip is inserted by utilizing transient deformation thereof into the first fixing hole. The reinforcing sheet includes a second fixing hole a periphery of which engages with the second engageable groove when the elastically deformable base portion of the mounting clip is inserted by utilizing transient deformation thereof into the second fixing hole.   The body panel includes a third fixing hole a periphery of which is held between the clastic stopper and the flange when the clastic stopper formed at the distal end of the mounting clip is inserted in the third fixing hole.<br>
With this mounting structure according to the third exemplified aspect of the present invention, first, the reinforcing sheet is disposed at the back of the plastic sheet, and the distal end of the mounting clip is then inserted into the second fixing hole of the reinforcing sheet utilizing elastic deformation thereof: thereby, the periphery of the second fixing hole engages with the. second engageable groove.   Subsequently, the<br>
distal end .of the mounting clip that projects from the reinforcing sheet is inserted into the first fixing hole of the plastic sheet utilizing elastic deformation thereof; thereby, the periphery of the first fixing hole engages with the first engageable groove. Next, the elastic stopper formed at the distal end of the mounting clip that projects from the reinforcing sheet is inserted into the third fixing hole from the outside of the body panel, so that the periphery of the third fixing hole is held between the clastic stopper of the mounting clip and the flange. Through a simple operation process as described above, the reinforcing sheet is fixed on the plastic sheet with the mounting clip, and the reinforcing sheet is fixed on the body panel with the same mounting clip; consequently, the plastic sheet for a vehicular exterior component is mounted together with the reinforcing sheet on the body panel.<br>

The mounting bracket 3B located at the fourth place from the left in FIG. 2 also has a mount part in which a first cutaway opening 3D having a left side thereof open is formed. In contrast, the mounting bracket 3B located at the fifth place from the left in FIG. 2 has a mount part in which a first cutaway opening 3D having a right side thereof open is formed. These first cutaway openings 3D each have, for example, vertical sides of 9 mm or so.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, a second cutaway opening 4A having a bottom side thereof open is formed at a spot on the reinforcing sheet 4 which spot corresponds with the first cutaway opening 3C of the mounting bracket 3B located at the third place from the left in FIG- 2-   The same second cutaway opening 4-A is also formed at a spot<br>
which corresponds with the first cutaway opening 3C of the mounting bracket 38 located at the second place from the left in FIG. 2-. These second cutaway openings 4A each have, for example, horizontal sides of 10 mm or so.<br>
On the other hand, as shown in FIG. 4, a second cutaway opening 4B having a left side thereof open is formed at a spot on the reinforcing sheet 4 which spot corresponds with the first cutaway opening 3C of the mounting bracket 3B located at the first place from the left in FIG. 2. The second cutaway opening 4B is formed at a fight side of a .quadrangular insertion hole 4C provided in the reinforcing sheet 4 by cutting away an area extending rightwards from a midsection of the right side of the insertion hole 4C, so that the second cutaway opening 4B is contiguous at the open side (left side) thereof with the insertion hole 4G. The same second cutaway opening 4B is also formed at a spot on the reinforcing sheet 4 which spot corresponds with the first cutaway opening 3D of the mounting bracket 3B located at the fourth place from the left in FIG. 2, and the insertion hole 4C is formed contiguously with each of these second cutaway openings 4B. Another contiguous set of the second cutaway opening 4B and the insertion hole 4C, which combine to assume a mirror image of the above equivalents provided at the spots located at the fourth place from the left in FIG. 2, is formed so that the second cutaway opening 4B is located at a spot on the reinforcing sheet 4 which spot corresponds with the first cutaway opening 3D of the mounting bracket 3B located at the fifth place from the left in FIG. 2,  These second cutaway openings 4B each have, for example, vertical sides of 22 mm or so and horizontal sides of 18 mm or so.<br>
The mounting clip 5 is, as shown in FIGs. 5 through 9, integrally molded out of synthetic resin of a little elasticity such as polyacetal resin. The mounting clip 5 has a substantially columnar shape consisting of a proximal end, a distal end. and side surfaces of a base portion extending between edges of the both ends. Formed at the<br>
distal end of the mounting clip 5 is an arrowhead-like elastic stopper 5A (see FIG. 6). On the side surfaces of the base portion near the proximal end of the mounting clip 5 are formed a first engageable groove 5B and a second engageable groove 5C. whereas on the side surfaces in a midsection of the mounting clip 5 is formed a rectangular flange 5D.<br>
The elastic stopper 5A is as shown in FIG. 6, symmetrically formed with a center thereof contiguously provided at a distal end of a column 5E that projects from the flange 5D, so that the elastic stopper 5A is shaped like an arrowhead attached to the shaft. A pair of barb-like portions outwardly extending from the tip of the elastic stopper 5A is elastically formed so that each barb-like portion may deform toward the column 5E. The elastic stopper 5A is shaped in such a form that each of stepwise portions 5A1, 5A1 of the barb-like portions and the flange 5D may hold the door panel 2 by sandwiching inner edges thereof that surround the fixing hole 2A of the door panel 2 when the elastic stopper 5A is inserted into the fixing hole 2A (see FIG. 2) by making use of elastic deformation of the barb-like portions thereof.<br>
Two opposite sides of the quadrangular column 5E are opposed to the barb-like portions of the elastic stopper 5A, while the other two opposite sides are each provided with a reinforcing rib 5F that projects from these sides as shown in FIGs, 5A through 8, On a surface of the flange 5D is provided, as shown in FIG. 10, a cushion sheet 6 that is interposed between a contact surface of the door panel 2 and the surface of the flange 3D.<br>
The first engageable groove 5B, as shown in FIG. 10, serves to engage with a periphery of the first cutaway opening 3C or 3D formed in the mount part of the mounting bracket 3B. Provided on side surfaces of a base portion 5G (located near the proximal end of the columnar mounting clip 5) shaped like a quadrangular prism are a first engageable piece 5M and a second engageable piece 51 that perpendicularly<br>
project from the side surfaces. The first ensageable groove 5B is, as shown in FIGs. 5A through 7. formed between the first eagageable piece 5H and the second engageable piece 51. The first engageable piece 5H is comprised of a pair of overhangs that project at an end of the base portion 5G from two opposite sides facing the same direction as a pair of the ribs 5F project toward. The second engageable piece 51 is comprised of a pair of overhangs that project from a position spaced at a predetermined interval from the first engageable piece 5H on the above two opposite sides of the base portion 5G. In order to broaden an opening between both sides of the first engageable groove 5B. as shown in FIGs. 5A and 6, a beveled face 5H1 is formed at an inner surface of the first engageable piece 5H opposed to the second engageable piece 51.<br>
The second engageable groove 5C, as shown in FIG. 10, serves to engage with a periphery of the second cutaway opening 4A or 4B formed in the reinforcing sheet 4. The second engageable groove 5C is, as shown in FIG. 5 A, 6, and 7, formed between the second engageable piece 51 and the flange 5D. In order to broaden an opening between both sides of the second engageable groove 5C, as shown in FIGs. 5A and 6, an arcuate face curved with a gentle curvature is formed at an inner surface of the second engageable piece 51 opposed to the flange 5D.<br>
As shown in FIGs; 5 A and 9, the mounting clip 5 is provided with a. rectangular parallelepiped depression 51, which is formed at an end face of the base portion 5G.<br>
The above-described mounting structure of a plastic sheet for a vehicular exterior component according to one exemplified embodiment of the present invention is embodied by mounting the tailgate garnish 3 as a plastic sheet on the door panel 2 as a body panel as shown in FIG. 1 following the process steps as will be described below. First, as shown in FIG. 2. the channel-shaped reinforcing sheet 4 is disposed at the back of the tailgate garnish 3 along the upper edge thereof. Thereafter, the<br>
reinforcing sheet 4 is superposed upon each mounting bracket 3B provided ai the back of the tailgate garnish 3. The second cutaway openings 4A and 4B of the reinforcing sheet 4 are then aligned with the first cutaway openings 3C and 3D of the mounting brackets 3B. After all, each mounting bracket 3B of the tailgate garnish 4 is secured to the reinforcing sheet 4 with the mounting clips 5 in sequence, and the reinforcing sheet 4 is mounted on an inside surface of the tailgate garnish 3 along the upper edge thereof.<br>
In this mounting operation, for example, when the mounting bracket 3B of the tailgate garnish 3 as shown in FIG. 3 is fixed onto the reinforcing sheet 4, the mounting clip 5 is located so that the base portion 5G of the mounting clip 5 faces the underside of the first cutaway opening 3C formed in the mount part of the mounting bracket 38 and the second cutaway opening 4A formed in the reinforcing sheet 4 at the outset. Then, the first engageable groove 5B is positioned at right and left peripheries of the first cutaway opening 3C, while the second engageable groove 5C is positioned at right and left peripheries of the second cutaway opening 4A.<br>
Subsequently, the base portion 5G of the mounting clip 5 is slid up toward the first cutaway opening 3C and the second cutaway opening 4A. Consequently, the first engageable groove 5B is engaged with the right and left peripheries of the first cutaway opening 3G and the second engageable groove 5C is engaged with the right and left peripheries of the second cutaway opening 4A. At this stage, a broadened opening toward the both ends of the first engageable groove 5B formed with a beveled surface 5H1 inside each end of the first engageable piece SH and a broadened opening toward the both ends of the second engageable groove 5C formed with a curved inner surface of the second engageable piece 51 serve to have the mounting clip 5 smoothly slid up, so that the first engageable groove 5B and the second engageable groove 5C<br>
may be easily engaged with the right and left peripheries of the first cutaway opening 3C and the second cutaway opening 4A.<br>
On the other hand, for example, when the mounting bracket 3 B of the tailgate<br>
garnish 3 as shown in FIG. 4 is fixed onto the reinforcing sheet 4, the base portion 5G<br>
of the mounting clip 5 is inserted in the insertion hole 4C of the reinforcing sheet 4 at<br>
the outset, and is located so that the base portion 5G faces the left side of the first<br>
cutaway opening 3D formed in the mount part of the mounting bracket 3B and the<br>
second cutaway opening 4B formed in the reinforcing sheet 4.    Then, the first<br>
engageable groove 5B of the base portion 5G of the mounting clip 5 is positioned at<br>
top and bottom peripheries of the first cutaway opening 3D, while the second<br>
engageable groove 5C is positioned at top and bottom peripheries of the second<br>
cutaway opening 4B.<br>
Subsequently, the distal end 5G of the mounting clip 5 is slid to the right toward the first cutaway opening 3D and the second cutaway opening 4B. Consequently, the first engageable groove SB is engaged with the top and bottom peripheries of the first cutaway opening 3D and the second engageable groove 5C is engaged with the top and bottom peripheries of the second cutaway opening 4B. At this st&amp;gc, a broadened opening toward the both ends of the first engageable groove SB formed with a beveled surface 5H1 inside each end of the first engageable piece 5H and a broadened opening toward the both ends of the second engageable groove 5C formed with a curved inner surface of the second engageable piece 51 serve to have the mounting clip 5 smoothly slid to the right, so that the first engageable groove 5B and the second engageable groove 5C may be easily engaged with the right and left peripheries of the first cutaway opening 3C and the second cutaway opening 4A.<br>
After each mounting bracket 3B of the tailgate garnish 3 is fixed on the reinforcing sheet 4 with the mounting clips 5 in sequence in accordance with the<br>
process steps as described above, the barb-like ponions of the elastic stopper 5A extending from the tip of each mounting clip 5, which projects from the reinforcing sheet 4, are inserted from outside into each fixing hole 2A of the door panel 2. Accordingly, each stepwise portion 5Al of the barb-like portions of the elastic stopper 5A and the flange 5D hold the door panel 2 by sandwiching the inner edges thereof that surrounds the fixing hole 2A of the door panel 2. At this stage, the cushion sheet 6, which may be provided on a surface of the flange 5D, allows the outer surface of the door panel.2 to contact with the flange 5D of the mounting clip 5 through the cushion sheet 6, serving to prevent the outer surface of the door panel 2 from being marred.<br>
According to the above-described embodiment of the mounting structure of a plastic sheet for a vehicular exterior component, a simplified operation process as above may be achieved, in which the reinforcing sheet 4 is fixed onto the tailgate garnish 3 with the mounting clips 5, and the reinforcing sheet 4 is then fixed onto the door panel 2 with the same mounting clips 5. so that the tailgate garnish 3 together with the reinforcing sheet 4 is mounted onto the door panel 2.<br>
Moreover, under the condition where the tailgate garnish 3 with the reinforcing sheet 4 is mounted on the door panel 2, among all the cutaway openings formed in the tailgate garnish 3 and the reinforcing sheet 4, the first cutaway openings 3C of the tailgate garnish 3 and the second cutaway openings 4A of the reinforcing sheet 4, which are formed at some spots corresponding to each other, orient in a direction that permits the base portions 5G of the mounting clips 5 to slide only downwardly. On the other hand, the first cutaway openings 3D of the tailgate garnish 3 and the second cutaway openings 4B of the reinforcing sheet 4; -which are formed at other spots corresponding to each other, orienl in a direction that permits the base ponions 5G of the mounting clips 5 to slide only to the left. Accordingly, the relative direction in<br>
which the first cutaway openings 3C and the second cutaway openings may slide with respect to the base portions 5G of the mounting clips 5 is not parallel to the relative direction in which the first cutaway openings 3D and the second cutaway openings 4B may slide; therefore, the tailgate garnish 3 and the reinforcing sheet 4 are restrained from sliding and shifting relative to the base portions SO of the mounting clips 5. Consequently, the tailgate garnish 3 is securely mounted, together with the reinforcing sheet 4, on the door panel 2.<br>
Thus, the above-discussed embodiment of the mounting structure of a plastic sheet for a vehicular exterior component allows the tailgate garnish 3 to be mounted, together with the reinforcing sheet 4, on the door panel 2 with a simplified process of operation., with the result that the mounting operation may be improved. Further, the simple structure employing the mounting clips 5 that are dual-purpose parts capable of fastening three components of the tailgate garnish 3, the reinforcing sheet 4 and the door panel 2 together contributes to the reduced number of the mounting clips 5 required and the reduced number of the second cutaway openings 4A, 4B to be made in the reinforcing sheet 4, reducing the number of process steps, and thus man-hours as well, required to make the second cutaway openings 4A, 4B in the reinforcing sheet 4. Next, a description will be given of a variation of the above embodiment of the mounting structure of a plastic sheet for a vehicular exterior component The features of the variation will be explained though specific illustration is not provided. Assume that the mount part of each mounting bracket 3B provided on the tailgate garnish 3 as shown in FIG. 2 has first fixing holes formed in place of the first cutaway openings 3C. 3D. and the reinforcing sheet 4 has second fixing holes formed in place of the second cutaway openings 4A, 4B.   It is likewise to be understood that a plurality of third fixing holes similar to the above fixing holes 2A are formed in the door panel 2.<br>
The first fixing hole is formed into a quadrangular hole having dimensions that permit insertion of the elastically deformed first engageable piece 5H provided at the base portion 5G of the mounting clip 5 as shown in FlGs. 5 through 9- When the first engageable piece 5H passes through the first fixing hole, a pair of overhangs of the first engageable piece 5H of the mounting clip 5 engages with peripheries of the first fixing hole. In this embodiment, slits for facilitating elastic deformation may preferably be provided in the paired overhangs of the first engageable piece 5H.<br>
The second fixing hole is formed into a quadrangular hole having dimensions that permit insertion of the elastically deformed second engageable piece 51 provided at the base portion 5G of the mounting clip 5. When the second engageable piece 51 passes through the second fixing hole, a pair of overhangs of the second engageable piece 51 of the mounting clip 5 engages with peripheries of the second fixing hole. Slits for facilitating elastic deformation may also preferably be provided in the paired overhangs of the second engageable piece 51.<br>
The above-described variation of the mounting structure of a plastic sheet for a vehicular exterior component is embodied by mounting the tailgate garnish 3 on the door panel 2 following the process steps as will be described below. First, as shown in FIG. 2, the channel-shaped reinforcing sheet 4 is disposed at the back of the tailgate garnish 3 along the upper edge thereof. Thereafter, the first fixing hole of the reinforcing sheet 4 is superposed upon and -aligned with the second fixing hole of each mounting bracket 3B. After all, the base portions 50 of the mounting clips 5 are fitted into the first fixing hole of the mounting bracket 3B through the second fixing hole of the reinforcing sheet 4.<br>
In operation of fitting each mounting clip 5 as described above, the first engageable piece 5H is elastically deformed and passes through the first fixing hole of the mounting bracket 3B, and the second engageable piece 51 is elastically deformed<br>
and passes through the second fixing hole of the reinforcing sheet 4. As a result, the first engage-able groove SB of the mounting clip 5 engages with the peripheries of the first fixing hole, and the second engageable groove 5C of the mounting clip 5 engages with the peripheries of the second fixing hole. After all, the reinforcing sheet 4 is secured to the tailgate garnish 3 through the mounting clips 5.<br>
Following the operation steps as described above, each mounting bracket 3B of the tailgate garnish 3 and the reinforcing sheet 4 arc secured with a plurality of the mounting clips 5 in sequence, and then the elastic stopper 5A at the tip of each mounting clip 5, which projects from the reinforcing sheet 4, is fitted into the corresponding third fixing hole from an outer side of the door panel 2. Accordingly, as shown in FIG. 10, the stepwise portions 5A1, 5A1 of the elastic stopper 5A and the flange 5D hold the peripheries of the fixing hole 2A with the cushion sheet $ interposed between the flange 5D and the door panel. With such a simple process of operation steps the reinforcing sheet 4 is secured to the tailgate garnish 3 via the clips 5. and the reinforcing sheet 4 is secured to the door panel 2 via the same mounting clips 5; thus, the tailgate garnish 3, together with the reinforcing sheet 4, is mounted on the door panel 2.<br>
Therefore, according to the variation of the embodiment of the mounting structure, the tailgate garnish 3, together with the reinforcing sheet 4, may be mounted on the door panel 2 through a simplified process of operation, which thus improves the workability of the mounting operation. Moreover, the mounting clips 5 are used to join and fasten three components of the tailgate garnish 3, the reinforcing sheet, and the door panel 2 together, and this simplified mounting structure contributes to the reduced number of the mounting clips 5 required, and the reduced number of the second cutaway openings 4A, 4B to be formed in the reinforcing sheet 4, reducing the<br>
number of process steps, and thus man-hours as well, required to make the second<br>
cutaway openings 4A. 4B in the reinforcing sheet.<br>
Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been<br>
described above, various modifications and changes may be made in the present<br>
invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.<br>
For example, the mounting structure of a plastic sheet for a vehicular exterior<br>
component according to the present invention is applicable, not only to the tailgate<br>
garnish 3 mounted together with the reinforcing sheet 4 on the door panel 2. but also<br>
to a side sill garnish mounted together with a reinforcing sheet on a side panel of a<br>
vehicle body.<br>
As  described  above,  with a  mounting  structure  according  to  the  first<br>
exemplified aspect of the present invention, first, the reinforcing sheet is superposed<br>
on the back of the plastic sheet, and the base portion of the mounting clip is placed at an open side of the first cutaway opening of the plastic sheet and the second cutaway opening of the reinforcing sheet.   Then, the first engageable groove and the second engageable groove is positioned at the peripheries of the first cutaway opening and the second cutaway opening, respectively. Subsequently, the base portion of the mounting clip is slid toward the first and second cutaway openings, and the first and second engageable grooves are engaged with the peripheries of the first and second cutaway-openings. Next, the elastic stopper formed at the distal end of the mounting clip that projects from the reinforcing sheet is inserted into the fixing hole from the outside of the body panel, so that the periphery of the fixing hole is held between the elastic stopper of the mounting clip and the flange.  Through a simple operation process as described above, the reinforcing sheet is fixed on the plastic sheet with the mounting clip, and the reinforcing sheet is fixed on the body panel with the same mounting clip.<br><br>
Accordingly, the mounting structure according to the first exemplified aspect of the present invention allows the plastic sheet for a vehicular exterior component to be mounted together with the reinforcing sheet on the body panel, thus improving the workability of mounting operation. The simplified structure in which the same mounting clip is used for fastening three components of the plastic sheet, the reinforcing sheet, and the body panel together contributes to the reduced number of the mounting clips required, when the three components are fixed at a plurality of spots, arid the reduced number of the second cutaway openings to be formed in the reinforcing sheet, reducing the number of process steps, and thus man-hours as well, required to make the second cutaway openings in the reinforcing sheet, thus further improving the workability of the mounting operation.<br>
With a mounting structure according to the second exemplified aspect of the present invention, the plastic sheet for a vehicular exterior component is mounted together with the reinforcing sheet on the body panel with a plurality of the mounting clips used at a plurality of the spots, following the same operation process as undergone for implementing the mounting structure according to the first aspect of the present invention.   Once the three components arc fastened together, one relative direction in which some of the first and second cutaway openings may slide with respect to the base portions of the mounting clips is not parallel to the other relative direction in which the others of the first and second cutaway openings may slide with respect to the base portions of the mounting clips; therefore, the plastic sheet and the reinforcing sheet are restrained from sliding and shifting relative to the base portions of the mounting clips.  Consequently, the plastic sheet is securely mounted together with the reinforcing sheet on the door panel.<br>
With a mounting structure according to the third exemplified aspect of the present invention, first, the reinforcing sheet is disposed at the back of the plastic sheet.<br>
and the distal end of the mounting clip is then inserted into the second fixing hole of the reinforcing sheet utilizing elastic deformation thereof; thereby, the periphery of the second fixing hole engages with the second engageable groove. Next, the elastic stopper formed at the distal end of the mounting clip that projects from the reinforcing sheet is inserted into the third fixing hole from the outside of the body panel, so that the periphery of the third fixing hole is held between the clastic stopper of the mounting clip and the flange. Through a simple operation process as described above, the reinforcing sheet is fixed on the plastic sheet with the mounting clip, and the reinforcing sheet is fixed on the body panel with the same mounting clip.<br>
Accordingly, the mounting structure according to the third exemplified aspect of the present invention allows the plastic sheet for a vehicular exterior component to be mounted together with the reinforcing sheet on the body panel, thus improving the workability of mounting operation. The simplified structure in which the same mounting clip is used for fastening three components of the plastic sheet, the reinforcing sheet, and the body panel together contributes to the reduced number of the mounting clips required, when the three components arc fixed at a plurality of spots, and the reduced number of the second fixing holes to be formed i» the reinforcing sheet, reducing the number of process steps, and thus man-hours as well, required to make the second fixing holes in the reinforcing sheet, thus further improving the workability of the mounting operation.<br><br><br><br><br>
