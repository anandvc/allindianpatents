PRIORITY CLAIM AND CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application is related to and claims domestic priority from prior U.S.<br>
Provisional Application Serial Number 60/337,359 (attorney docket number 50277-<br>
1866), filed on November 30, 2001, entitled "Realizing Session and Synchronous<br>
Semantics Based on Asynchronous Messaging Protocols", by Zhou Ye and Calvin Wang,<br>
the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes as if<br>
fully set forth herein.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to providing requested information to users and<br>
more specifically to providing information to users with a protocol other than the protocol<br>
expected by the service that provides the information.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] As the popularity of the Internet grows, more and more people are accessing<br>
the Internet with their mobile devices. Many of the applications that people access on the<br>
Internet are session based. Sessions allow for multiple requests and multiple responses to<br>
complete a task.<br>
[0004] Many of today's mobile devices that access the Internet are required to have a<br>
Web browser that communicates with session based web applications. Web browsers<br>
provide menus and hyperlinks for users to navigate through web applications (hereinafter<br>
referred to as "user navigation capabilities") However, many people have mobile<br>
devices that do not have Web browsers. Instead these mobile devices typically use<br>
asynchronous protocols, such as e-mail and Short Message Service (SMS).<br>
Asynchronous protocols only allow for a single request, and a single response to that<br>
request, for a given task.<br>
[0005] Therefore it can clearly be seen that there is a need for providing web<br>
capabilities, such as sessions and user navigation capabilities, to mobile devices, which<br>
use a vast array of asynchronous protocols.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] Techniques are provided for servicing requests that are issued in a protocol<br>
other than the protocol expected by the service. For example, many people want to use<br>
their mobile devices to interact with services, which require the ability to have multiple<br>
related messages in a session. However, their mobile devices do not have protocols that<br>
support interacting with such services. One technique provided herein is to interpose an<br>
intermediary between the mobile devices and the services to provide session capabilities<br>
on behalf of the mobile devices.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014] A method for servicing requests that are issued in a protocol other than the<br>
protocol expected by the service is described, for the purposes of explanation, numerous<br>
specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present<br>
invention. It will be apparent, however, that the present invention may be practiced<br>
without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are<br>
shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present<br>
invention.<br><br>
A SYSTEM OVERVIEW<br>
[0015] FIG. 1A is a block diagram of a system used for servicing requests that are<br>
issued in a protocol other than the protocol expected by the service. A client device 100<br>
is used for requesting services with a message 101. The client device 100 transmits<br>
message 101 with an asynchronous protocol such as email or SMS. Message 101<br>
contains a request for a service and contains information for locating the service (151,<br>
152, or 153). In one case, a to-address in message 101 is used for locating a specific<br>
service. In another case, a to-address in message 101 is used for locating a site 150 and<br>
part of message 101 's content is used for locating a specific service 151 within the site<br>
150.<br>
[0016] A transport handler 120 encapsulates one or more asynchronous protocol<br>
handlers such as e-mail protocol handler 121, SMS protocol handler 122, and other<br>
protocol handlers 123. Each protocol handler (121, 122, 123) processes a particular type<br>
of asynchronous protocol. Therefore, transport handler 120 is capable of communicating<br>
with whatever asynchronous protocol that client device 100 uses. The protocol handler<br>
(121, 122, or 123) transmits the contents of message 101 to intermediary 140. According<br>
to one embodiment, message 101 's content is in text (hereinafter referred to as "text<br>
formatted request").<br>
[0017] Intermediary 140 receives message 101 's content from one of the protocol<br>
handlers (121, 122, 123), translates message 101 's content into a format that the services<br>
(151, 152, or 153) understands, forwards the request to the service (151, 152, or 153), and<br>
maintains session context as will be described in more detail. For example, message<br>
101 's content is used (1) to fill in fields of a web page or (2) to select a hyperlink, as will<br>
be described in more detail. According to one embodiment, the filled in web page is in<br>
Oracle's mobile XML™.<br>
[0018] The service protocol handler 180 provides web protocols such as Hyper Text<br>
Transfer Protocol (HTTP). According to one embodiment, the service protocol handler<br>
180 is provided by an Internet Service Provider (ISP). According to another embodiment,<br>
the service protocol handler 180 is a Java API that is used to register services (151, 152,<br>
153). A service (151, 152, or 153) provides information in response to message 101.<br>
According to one embodiment, the response to message 101 is a web page. For example,<br>
the response to message 101 maybe in Oracle's mobile XML™. Service 151 is on Site<br>
150.<br>
[0019] Application mapping 160 contains an address-to-application mapping where<br>
valid to-addresses are mapped to applications (130, 140). An application (130 or 140)<br><br>
listens for specific to-addresses by registering the to-addresses with the transport handler-<br>
120. Registering the to-addresses creates mapping entries in the application mapping<br>
160. For example, when intermediary 140 registers a particular to-address, an entry is<br>
created in application mapping 160 that maps the particular to-address to intermediary<br>
140.<br>
[0020] According to one embodiment, service mapping 170 maps the message 101 's<br>
to-address to a specific service. According to another embodiment, service mapping 170<br>
maps the message 101 's to-address plus part of message 101's content to a specific<br>
service 151 within the site 150. These embodiments are described in more detail<br>
hereinafter.<br>
AN OPERATIONAL EXAMPLE<br>
[0021] A person enters an email message 101 on client device 100. Message 101<br>
contains a to-address that specifies service 152. Message 101 is intercepted by the<br>
transport handler 120. Since message 101 is an email, the e-mail protocol handler 121<br>
receives message 101 from client 100, uses message 101 's to-address to locate an entry in<br>
application mapping 160, and uses the entry to determine which application (130 or 140)<br>
to forward the message 100 to. Assuming the entry maps to intermediary 140, the e-mail<br>
protocol handler 121 forwards message 100 to intermediary 140. Intermediary 140 uses<br>
the message 100's to-address or the message 100's to-address plus part of message 100's<br>
contents to locate an entry in the service mapping 170. The entry in the service mapping<br>
170 is used to determine which service (151, 152, or 152) the contents of message 101 are<br>
to be forwarded to. Assuming that service 152 expects requests in the form of a filled out<br>
web page, intermediary 140 uses the contents of message 101 to fill out the web page,<br>
communicates the filled out web page to service 152, and maintains session context as<br>
will be described in more detail hereinafter. Assuming that service 152 expects to receive<br>
requests using the HTTP protocol, service protocol handler 140 intercepts the filled out<br>
web page and transmits it to service 152 using HTTP. Then service 152 transmits a<br>
response and the process is reversed.<br>
ADDRESSING CONSIDERATIONS<br>
[0022] FIG. IB is a block diagram that shows a message in which the to-address<br>
corresponds to a site and the message content is used to locate a service within the site.<br>
The message 101 designates a to-address 102 and a message body. The to-address 102 is<br><br>
<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f1989f85b188df929e9c">[email&#160;protected]</a> includes a site-wide address 106, y.com. For example, the site-wide address<br>
106, y.com, corresponds to a site, not to a specific service.<br>
[0023] The message body contains an instruction 103. According to one<br>
embodiment, the instruction 103 has two parts - a short name 104 and a prompter 105.<br>
Instruction 103, "ST ORCL", specifies a particular service provided by the specified site<br>
and provides a parameter value related to that service. Specifically, the "ST" designates a<br>
stock quote service and "ORCL" designates that the stock is for Oracle.<br>
[0024] Intermediary 140 is an application that listens for the to-address 102,<br>
<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d3babda793aafdb0bcbe">[email&#160;protected]</a>. Site 150 is at the site-wide address 106, y.com. Service 151 is a stock<br>
service in site 150 at address y.com/finance/stock. Since the to-address 102 included a<br>
site-wide address 106, y.com, a short name 104, "ST", is used to designate a service 151<br>
within the site 150. Intermediary 140 transmits the prompter 105, "ORCL", to service<br>
151.<br>
[0025] If site-wide addressing is used with the SMS protocol, the to-address is a<br>
phone number like 1234567. Then phone number 1234567 designates the site 150. The<br>
short message 104, "ST", is used to designate the service 151 within site 150.<br>
[0026] FIG. 1C is a block diagram that shows a message in which the to-address<br>
corresponds to a specific service. The to-address 102 is <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b6c5c2d9d5ddf6cf98d5d9db">[email&#160;protected]</a>. The service-level<br>
address 107 is also <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3546415a565e754c1b565a58">[email&#160;protected]</a>. The message body contains an instruction 103,<br>
"ORCL", to obtain a quote for Oracle stock. According to one embodiment, the<br>
instruction 103 has one part - prompter 105.<br>
[0027] Intermediary 140 listens for the to-address 102, <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c7b4b3a8a4ac87bee9a4a8aa">[email&#160;protected]</a>. Service 151 is<br>
a stock quote service, which is at stock.y.com. Intermediary 140 transmits the prompter<br>
105, "ORCL", to service 151.<br>
[0028] FIG. ID is a block diagram that shows a message in which the to-address<br>
corresponds to a particular application. The to-address 102 is <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ea83849eaa83849ec4898587">[email&#160;protected]</a>. The to-<br>
address 102 includes an application address 108, int.com.<br>
[0029] Intermediary 140 listens for the to-address 102, <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c0a9aeb480a9aeb4eea3afad">[email&#160;protected]</a>. Intermediary<br>
140 is at the application address 108, int.com. Intermediary 140 uses the short name 104,<br>
"ST", to determine the service address of service 151. In this example, service 151 can<br>
be contacted by the intermediary using either site-wide addressing, y.com/finance/stock,<br>
or service-level addressing, stock.y.com. Intermediary 140 transmits the prompter 105,<br>
"ORCL", to service 151. Although these examples describe transmitting the prompter<br>
105 to the service 151, other items may be transmitted in addition to or instead of the<br>
prompter 105.<br><br>
USER NAVIGATION CAPABILITIES AND SESSIONS<br>
(0030] FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating message flow between a client device, an<br>
intermediary, and a service. According to one embodiment, a person can request<br>
information from a service that returns a web page. The web page may include menu<br>
items and/or hyperlinks (hereinafter referred to as "web formatted response"). According<br>
to one embodiment, the menu items and the hyperlinks are translated into text format for<br>
display on the mobile device. This is accomplished by translating the menu items and<br>
hyperlinks into descriptive text preceded by a user selectable reference number.<br>
[0031] The reference numbers preceeding the descriptive text connect menus in a<br>
menu tree. As the user traverses the menu tree by selecting reference numbers,<br>
intermediary 140 maintains a session context by saving the selected reference numbers.<br>
Therefore, intermediary 140 has knowledge of where the user currently is in the menu<br>
tree. According to one embodiment, the session context is maintained as a part of a state<br>
machine.<br>
[0032] According to one embodiment, the session context is stored and maintained by<br>
intermediary 140. When intermediary 140 receives a request from a client device 100,<br>
intermediary 140 inspects the device ID associated with the request. If a session context<br>
does not already exist for that device ID, intermediary 140 creates a session context.<br>
According to one embodiment, the session context includes the device ID of client device<br>
100, reference numbers the user selects, and the web formatted response. The session<br>
context is released when the session ends.<br>
[0033] According to one embodiment, the session is terminated when a timer runs<br>
out. According to a second embodiment, the session context is used to determine when to<br>
terminate the session. For example, the session is terminated when the session context<br>
indicates that the user has exited the service. According to a third embodiment, both the<br>
session context and a timer are used to determine when to terminate the session<br>
depending on which condition occurs first. For example, the session ends at the earliest<br>
of a timer ending or the user exiting the menu tree.<br>
[0034] Menu 204 and menu 208 below illustrate a menu tree where selecting the<br>
reference number 2 on menu 204 results in menu 208 being displayed to the user. For<br>
example, a user may request addresses of eating establishments nearest the user's home<br>
by entering a to-address 102, <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2940474f4669465b484a454c44464b40454c074a4644">[email&#160;protected]</a>, and an instruction 103, "yp<br>
eating_establishments home" (hereinafter referred to as the "initial request in text 201").<br>
The short name "yp" stands for Yellow Pages and the "home" parameter indicates that the<br>
eating establishments should be close to the user's home.<br><br>
[0035] The user's initial request in text 201 is transmitted to a service (151, 152, or<br>
153). FIGS. 1B, 1C, and 1D are also examples of initial requests in text 201. The<br>
intermediary 140 intercepts the initial request in text 201 and uses its contents to create<br>
the initial request in web format 202. The service address is derived based on the to-<br>
address 102 in the initial request in text 201 as already described herein. The service 152<br>
responds with a first web page 203. In this example, the first web page 203 has two<br>
hyperlinks: a first for fine restaurants and a second for burger joints. Intermediary 140<br>
intercepts the first web page 203, associates the first web page 203 with the session<br>
context, translates the first web page 203 into a text formatted message, menu 204, and<br>
transmits the menu 204 to the client device 100. Menu 204 is displayed on the client<br>
device 100 as follows:<br><br>
[0036] The reference number "2" (205) is entered on the client device 100 as a<br>
request for a list of burger joints near the user's home area. Intermediary 140 saves the<br>
reference number "2" in the session context. Intermediary 140 translates the reference<br>
number "2" into a response the service 152 understands by using the first web page 203.<br>
For example, intermediary 140 translates the user selected reference number "2" into a<br>
selection of the second hyperlink, which is for burger joints, in the first web page 203.<br>
The selection of the second hyperlink 206 is communicated to the service 152. The<br>
service 152 responds with a second web page 207, which is a list of burger joints. The<br>
second web page 207 has four hyperlinks: a first for Burger King, a second for Carl's<br>
Junior, a third for McDonalds, and a fourth for Wendy's. Intermediary 140 intercepts the<br>
second web page 207, associates the second web page 207 with the session context,<br>
translates the second web formatted response into menu 208, and transmits the menu 208<br>
to the client device 100. Menu 208 is displayed on the client device 100 as follows:<br><br><br>
[0037] The reference number "3" (209) is entered on the client device 100 as a<br>
request for the McDonald's address nearest the user's home. Intermediary 140 saves the<br>
reference number "3" in the session context<br>
{0038] Intermediary 140 translates the reference number "3" (209) into a response the<br>
service 152 understands by using the second web page 207. For example, intermediary<br>
140 translates the user selected reference number "3" into a selection of the third<br>
hyperlink, which is for McDonalds, in the second web page 207. The selection of the<br>
third hyperlink 210 is communicated to a service 152. The service 152 responds with<br>
McDonald's address in web format 211. Intermediary 140 intercepts the McDonald's<br>
address in web format 211, translates McDonald's address in web format 211 into<br>
McDonald's address in text format 212, and transmits McDonald's address in text format<br>
212 to the client device 100. If service 1 52 transmits the McDonald's address to<br>
intermediary 140 in text, then no translation is necessary. McDonald's address in text<br>
format 212 is displayed on the client device 100.<br>
(0039] At this point, intermediary 140 determines that the user's initial request in text<br>
201 has been satisfied. The user entered three requests: the initial request in text 201,<br>
reference number "2" (205) and reference number "3" (209). The user received 3<br>
responses - Menu 204, Menu 208, and the McDonald's address 212. The three requests<br>
and three responses involved in completing the task is an example of a session. As can be<br>
seen, maintaining session context provides session capabilities and user navigation<br>
capabilities for mobile devices communicating with asynchronous protocols.<br>
[0040] According to one embodiment, the user can escape from the middle of<br>
navigating a menu tree and proceed with a new request by entering an escape key. For<br>
example, if the user decides to check Oracle stock prices after requesting eating<br>
establishments but before receiving an eating establishment's address, the user can enter<br>
an escape key. Then the user can request Oracle stock prices as already described herein.<br>
A CONTINUOUS ACTIVE CONNECTION IS NOT REQUIRED<br>
[0041 ] Unlike web applications that support sessions, a continuous active connection<br>
is not required for the duration of a "session" since asynchronous protocols are used<br>
between client device 100 and intermediary 140. For example, when a person using a<br>
mobile device, communicating with a synchronous web protocol, enters a tunnel,<br>
communications are interrupted. The connection has to be reestablished in order for the<br>
person to receive the requested information. In contrast, when a person using a client<br>
device 100, communicating with an asynchronous protocol, enters a tunnel and<br><br>
communications are interrupted, the person can still receive the remaining information<br>
once the person is out of the tunnel.<br>
HARDWARE OVERVIEW<br>
[0042] FIG. 3 is a block diagram that illustrates a computer system 300 upon which<br>
an embodiment of the invention may be implemented. Computer system 300 includes a<br>
bus 302 or other communication mechanism for communicating information, and a<br>
processor 304 coupled with bus 302 for processing information. Computer system 300<br>
also includes a main memory 306, such as a random access memory (RAM) or other<br>
dynamic storage device, coupled to bus 302 for storing information and instructions to be<br>
executed by processor 304. Main memory 306 also may be used for storing temporary<br>
variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions to be<br>
executed by processor 304. Computer system 300 further includes a read only memory<br>
(ROM) 308 or other static storage device coupled to bus 302 for storing static information<br>
and instructions for processor 304. A storage device 310, such as a magnetic disk or<br>
optical disk, is provided and coupled to bus 302 for storing information and instructions.<br>
[0043] Computer system 300 may be coupled via bus 302 to a display 312, such as a<br>
cathode ray tube (CRT), for displaying information to a computer user. An input device<br>
314, including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to bus 302 for communicating<br>
information and command selections to processor 304. Another type of user input device<br>
is cursor control 316, such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys for<br>
communicating direction information and command selections to processor 304 and for<br>
controlling cursor movement on display 312. This input device typically has two degrees<br>
of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis (e.g., y), that allows the<br>
device to specify positions in a plane.<br>
[0044] The invention is related to the use of computer system 300 for implementing<br>
the techniques described herein. According to one embodiment of the invention, those<br>
techniques are performed by computer system 300 in response to processor 304 executing<br>
one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in main memory 306. Such<br>
instructions may be read into main memory 306 from another computer-readable<br>
medium, such as storage device 310. Execution of the sequences of instructions<br>
contained in main memory 306 causes processor 304 to perform the process steps<br>
described herein. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place<br>
of or in combination with software instructions to implement the invention. Thus,<br><br>
embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware<br>
circuitry and software.<br>
[0045] The term "computer-readable medium" as used herein refers to any medium<br>
that participates in providing instructions to processor 304 for execution. Such a medium<br>
may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media,<br>
and transmission media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic<br>
disks, such as storage device 310. Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as<br>
main memory 306. Transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber<br>
optics, including the wires that comprise bus 302. Transmission media can also take the<br>
form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio-wave and infra-red<br>
data communications.<br>
[0046] Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy<br>
disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium, a CD-<br>
ROM, any other optical medium, punch cards, papertape, any other physical medium with<br>
patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory<br>
chip or cartridge, a carrier wave as described hereinafter, or any other medium from<br>
which a computer can read.<br>
[0047] Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or<br>
more sequences of one or more instructions to processor 304 for execution. For example,<br>
the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. The<br>
remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the<br>
instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer system<br>
300 can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infra-red transmitter to convert<br>
the data to an infra-red signal. An infra-red detector can receive the data carried in the<br>
infra-red signal and appropriate circuitry can place the data on bus 302. Bus 302 carries<br>
the data to main memory 306, from which processor 304 retrieves and executes the<br>
instructions. The instructions received by main memory 306 may optionally be stored on<br>
storage device 310 either before or after execution by processor 304.<br>
[0048] Computer system 300 also includes a communication interface 318 coupled to<br>
bus 302. Communication interface 318 provides a two-way data communication coupling<br>
to a network link 320 that is connected to a local network 322. For example,<br>
communication interface 318 may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card<br>
or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of<br>
telephone line. As another example, communication interface 318 may be a local area<br>
network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN.<br><br>
Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication<br>
interface 318 sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry<br>
digital data streams representing various types of information.<br>
[0049] Network link 320 typically provides data communication through one or more<br>
networks to other data devices. For example, network link 320 may provide a connection<br>
through local network 322 to a host computer 324 or to data equipment operated by an<br>
Internet Service Provider (ISP) 326. ISP 326 in turn provides data communication<br>
services through the world wide packet data communication network now commonly<br>
referred to as the "Internet" 328. Local network 322 and Internet 328 both use electrical,<br>
electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the<br>
various networks and the signals on network link 320 and through communication<br>
interface 318, which carry the digital data to and from computer system 300, are<br>
exemplary forms of carrier waves transporting the information.<br>
[0050] Computer system 300 can send messages and receive data, including program<br>
code, through the network(s), network link 320 and communication interface 318. In the<br>
Internet example, a server 330 might transmit a requested code for an application program<br>
through Internet 328, ISP 326, local network 322 and communication interface 318.<br>
[0051 ] The received code may be executed by processor 304 as it is received, and/or<br>
stored in storage device 310, or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this<br>
manner, computer system 300 may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.<br>
[0052] In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference<br>
to specific embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications<br>
and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of<br>
the invention. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an<br>
illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.<br><br>
