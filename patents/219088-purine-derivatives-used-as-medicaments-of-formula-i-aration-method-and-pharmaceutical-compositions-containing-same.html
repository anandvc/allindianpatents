				<td>DERIVATIVES OF PURINE, THEIR PREPARATION PROCESS AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM<br>
The present invention relates to new derivatives of purine, their preparation process, the new intermediates obtained, their use as medicaments, the pharmaceutical compositions containing them and the new use of such derivatives of purine.<br>
Therefore a subject of the invention is new derivatives of purine having anti-proliferative properties and in particular derivatives of purine endowed with an inhibitory effect vis-a-vis cycline-dependent kinase proteins i.e. abbreviated to 'cdk' which will be used in the rest of the text.<br>
Study of the molecular mechanisms which control the cell cycle has allowed the regulatory role of the cdk thus defined to be demonstrated.  The cdk's are proteins constituted by at least two sub-units, a catalytic sub-unit (of which cdc2 is the prototype) and a regulatory sub-unit (cycline).  A certain number of cdk's are thus known.  The cdk's therefore fors proteinic complexes each of which is involved in a phase of the cell cycle.<br>
Numerous documents in the literature describe the existence and the role of cdk's and as an example there can be mentioned in particular document WO 97/20842.<br>
Several kinase inhibitors have been described such as butyrolactone, flavopiridol and 2(2-hydroxyethylamino)-6-benzylamino-9-methylpurine called olomoucine.<br>
A subject of the present invention is therefore the products of formula (I):<br>

It should be noted that: such conversion reactions of substituents to other substituents can also be carried out on the starting products as well as on the intermediates defined above before continuing the synthesis according to the reactions indicated in the process described above.<br>
Under preferential conditions for the implementation of the invention, the process described above can be carried out as follows:<br>
The reaction of the product of formula (II) with a<br><br>
product of formula (III) in order to produce a product of formula (IV) can be carried out in particular in the presence of DEAD, DIAD (diisopropyl azodicarboxylate) or also of triphenylphosphine P(phenyl)3 in a solvent such as THF or CH2-C12 or also DMF.<br>
In the product of formula (III), the R2 radical represents in particular an alkyl, cycloalkyl, tetrahydrofuryl or tetrahydrothienyl radical.<br>
There can be mentioned in particular the following products of formula (III) : cyclopentanol, 3-hydroxy-tetrahydrofuran, 3-hydroxytetrahydrothiophene,2-hydroxybutanol and 3-hydroxypentanol.<br>
The products of formula (IV) thus obtained are subjected according to route 1) as defined above to the action of the product of formula (V) as defined above in which n represents the integer 0 and Z represents the-CH2- radical when n is equal to 1, in particular in an alcohol such as butanol at a temperature of approximately 80Â°C or in DMF in order to produce a product of formula (VIII) as defined above.<br>
The products of formula (IV) are subjected according to route 2) to the action of the product of formula (VI) as defined above in which Z represents -S02/ in particular in THF, DME, Cs2C03, K2C03 or also Na2C03 in order to produce a product of formula (IX) as defined above.<br>
The products of formula (IV) are subjected according to route 3 to the action of the product of formula (VII) as defined above in which Z represents the -(CH2)2NHR3- radical, in particular in butanol at a temperature of approximately 75Â°C for approximately 2 or 3 hours in order to produce a product of formula (X) as defined above.<br>
The product of formula (X) thus obtained can be subjected to the action of a product of formula (XI) or (XI)A as defined above in DME, Cs2CO3 or also CH2C12 and N(Et)3 for approximately one hour at ambient temperature in order to produce respectively a product of formula (XII) or (XII)A as<br><br>
defined above.<br>
The product of formula (X) can also be subjected to the action of an aldehyde of formula (XVII) in particular in an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol, in the presence of NaBH4 or NaBH3CN in order to produce a product of formula (XIII) as defined above.<br>
For the other values of Z, the corresponding products are prepared according to routes 4, 5 and 6 of the process as follows: the products of formula (IV) are subjected according to route 4 to the action of the product of formula (XVIII) in which Z represents CO in order to produce a product of formula (M^ as defined above.<br>
The reaction of the product of formula (IV) with the product of formula (XVIII) can be carried out under the same conditions as those for the reaction of the product of formula (IV) with the product of formula VI in order to produce the product of formula (IX) in which Z represents S02. The products of formula (IV) are subjected to the action of ammonia in order to produce a product of formula (XIX). The product of formula (XIX) can then be subjected either according to route 5 to the action of the product of formula (XX) in which Z represents COO in order to produce a product of formula (M2) as defined above, or according to route 6 to the action of the product of formula (XXI) in which Z represents CONH in order to produce a product of formula (M3) as defined above.<br>
The reactions of the product of formula (XIX) with the products of formulae (XX) or (XXI) can be carried out in DME or THF, in the presence of Cs2C03 or K2C03 .<br>
The products thus obtained of formulae (VIII),(IX), (XII), (XII) A, (XIII), (Mi), (M2) and (M3) , as defined above are subjected according to route a) to the action of a compound of formula (XIV) as defined above in which Y represents -NR5, for a condensation reaction which if appropriate can be carried out at a temperature of<br><br>
approximately 140Â°C: such a condensation reaction can be followed by a salification reaction in the presence of hydrochloric acid for example or also of tartaric, citric or methane sulphonic acid, in an alcohol such as for example ethanol or methanol in order to produce products of formula (Ix) as defined above.<br>
The products of formula (Ix) are therefore products of formula (I) in which the optionally reactive functions are optionally protected and in which Y represents -NR5- as defined above.<br>
The products of formulae (VIII), (IX), (XII), (XII)A, (XIII), (Mi), (M2) and (M3) , as defined above can also be subjected according to route b) to the action of a compound of formula (XV) as defined above in which Y represents the oxygen atom, for a condensation reaction for example in the presence of NaH in THF or DMF at ambient temperature or while heating: such a condensation reaction can be followed by a salification reaction in the presence of hydrochloric acid for example or also of tartaric, citric or methane sulphonic acid, in an alcohol such as for example ethanol or methanol in order to produce products of formula (ly) as defined above.<br>
The products of formula (ly) are therefore products of formula (I) in which the optionally reactive functions are optionally protected and in which Y represents -0- as defined above.<br>
The products of formulae (VIII), (IX), (XII), (XII)A&gt; (XIII) , (MJ.) , (M2) and (M3) , as defined above can also be subjected according to route c) to the action of a compound of formula (XVI) as defined above in which Y represents the sulphur atom, for a condensation reaction in the presence of a base such as Na2C03 or NaH in THF or DMF at ambient temperature or while heating: such a condensation reaction can be followed by a salification reaction in the presence of hydrochloric acid for example or also of tartaric, citric or<br><br>
methane sulphonic acid, in an alcohol such as for example ethanol or methanol in order to produce products of formula (Iz) as defined above.<br>
The products of formula (Iz) are therefore products of formula (I) in which the optionally reactive functions are optionally protected and in which Y represents -S- as defined above.<br>
The amine function of the compounds of formulae (Ix), (ly) and (Iz) as defined above, protected by a group such as Boc or CH2-phenyl can be released under the usual conditions known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
The saponification reaction can be carried out according to the usual methods known to a person skilled in the art, such as for example in a solvent such as methanol or ethanol, dioxane or dimethoxyethane, in the presence of soda or potash.<br>
The reduction or oxidation reactions of the product of formula (Ix) to a product of formula (I) can be carried out according to the usual methods known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
According to the values of RI', R2', R5', Re', RS', 2', DI' and D2', the products of formulae (Ix), (ly) and (I2) do or do not constitute products of formula (I) and can lead to products of formula (I) , or be converted to other products of formula (I) by being subjected to one or more of the reactions a) to k) indicated above.<br>
Thus the various reactive functions which can be carried by certain compounds of the reactions defined above can, if necessary, be protected: these can be for example hydroxyl, acyl, free carboxy or also amino and monoalkylamino radicals which can be protected by the appropriate protective groups.<br>
The following non-exhaustive list of examples of protection of reactive functions can be mentioned: - the hydroxyl groups can be protected for example by alkyl radicals such as tert-butyl, trimethylsilyl, tert-<br><br>

The products of formula (I) as defined above as well as their addition salts with acids have useful pharmacological properties.<br>
The products of the present invention as defined above, have kinase inhibitory properties of great selectivity.<br>
The cdk's play a central role in the initiation, the development and the completion of the events of the cell cycle and thus, the inhibitory molecules of cdk are capable of limiting undesirable cell proliferations such as those observed in cancers, psoriasis, fungal growth, parasites (animals, protists): such inhibitory molecules of cdk are thus also capable of intervening in the regulation of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Kinases which are particularly sensitive to the inhibitory effects of the derivatives of the present invention are in particular cdkl, cdk2, cdk4, cdk5 and cdk7.<br>
The products of the present invention are therefore endowed with antimitotic properties.<br>
The products of the present invention have in addition to their specific inhibitory properties of kinases, useful cellular effects such as antiproliferative properties and in particular effects on apoptosis.<br>
It is known from the work described in the literature such as in WO 97/20842, that relationships exist between the<br><br>
cell cycle and apoptosis.  Among the routes leading to apoptosis, certain are dependent on kinases.<br>
The products of the present invention are in particular useful for tumour therapy.<br>
The products of the invention can also therefore increase the therapeutic effects of the anti-tumor agents which are currently used.<br>
The products of formula (I) of the present invention therefore have quite particularly antimitotic and anti-neurodegenerative properties.<br>
These properties justify their use in therapeutics and a particular subject the invention is as medicaments, the products of formula (I) as defined above, said products of formula (I) being in all possible racemic, enantiomeric and diastereoisomeric isomer forms, as well as the addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable mineral and organic acids or with mineral and organic bases of said products of formula<br>
