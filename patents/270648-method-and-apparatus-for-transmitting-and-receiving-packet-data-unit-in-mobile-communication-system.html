				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING<br>
PACKET DATA UNIT IN MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a mobile communication<br>
system, and in particular, to a method and apparatus for transmitting and<br>
receiving Packet Data Units (PDUs) in a User Equipment (UE) or a Node B.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Currently, Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard is under discussion as the<br>
next generation mobile communication system succeeding the UMTS system.<br>
LTE is a technology for implementing communication for high-speed packet<br>
transmission at about 100 Mbps, aimed at deployment in around 2010. To this end,<br>
several schemes are now under discussion, and a typical one of the schemes<br>
moves a radio protocol function of a Radio Network Controller (RNC) to an e-<br>
Node B to maximally approximate it to radio channels.<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary configuration of a next<br>
generation LTE mobile communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG 1, as illustrated, Evolved UMTS Radio Access<br>
Networks (E-UTRANs) 110 and 112 are simplified to a 2-node configuration of<br>
Evolved Node Bs (ENBs) (or Node Bs) 120, 122, 124, 126 and 128, and anchor<br>
nodes 130 and 132. A User Equipment (UE) 101 accesses an Internet Protocol<br>
(IP) network by means of the E-UTRANs 110 and 112.<br>
The ENBs 120 to 128 correspond to the legacy Node Bs of the UMTS<br>
system, and are connected to the UE 101 over radio channels. Unlike the legacy<br>
Node Bs, the ENBs 120 to 128 perform more complex functions. In LTE, since<br>
all user traffics, including the real-time services such as Voice over IP (VoIP), are<br>
serviced over a shared channel, there is a need for an apparatus for gathering<br><br>
status information of UEs and performing scheduling using the information, and<br>
the ENBs 120 to 128 take charge of this function.<br>
Like High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) and/or High Speed<br>
Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA), LTE also has Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest<br>
(HARQ) performed between the ENBs 120 to 128 and the UE 101. However,<br>
since it is not possible to satisfy various Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements<br>
only with HARQ, outer-ARQ can be performed in upper layers, and the outer-<br>
ARQ is also performed between the UE 101 and the ENBs 120 to 128.<br>
To realize a data rate of a maximum of 100 Mbps, LTE is expected to use<br>
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) as a radio access<br>
technology in a 20-MHz bandwidth. In addition, Adaptive Modulation &amp; Coding<br>
(AMC) that determines a modulation scheme and a channel coding rate<br>
depending on the channel status of UEs will be applied.<br>
Many next generation mobile communication systems, including LTE,<br>
use both HARQ and ARQ as an error correction technique.<br>
The term 'HARQ' as used herein refers to a technique for soft-combining<br>
previously received data with its retransmitted data without discarding the<br>
previously received data, thereby increasing a reception success rate. More<br>
specifically, an HARQ receiving side determines the presence/absence of an error<br>
in a received packet, and then sends an HARQ positive Acknowledgement<br>
(HARQ ACK) signal or an HARQ negative Acknowledgement (HARQ NACK)<br>
signal to a transmitting side according to the presence/absence of an error. Then<br>
the transmitting side carries out retransmission of the HARQ packet or<br>
transmission of a new HARQ packet according to the HARQ ACK/NACK signal.<br>
The HARQ receiving side soft-combines the retransmitted packet with the<br>
previously received packet to reduce an error occurrence rate.<br>
The term 'ARQ' refers to a technique for checking sequence numbers of<br>
received packets, and issuing a retransmission request for a missing packet if any.<br><br>
This technique does not soft-combine the previously-received packet with its<br>
retransmitted packets. In the LTE system, the ARQ operation is managed by a<br>
Radio Link Control (RLC) protocol layer, and the HARQ operation is managed<br>
by a Media Access Control (MAC) or Physical (PHY) layer.<br>
FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating a protocol structure for an LTE system. In<br>
FIG. 2, layers of a transmitting side and a receiving side are shown in a<br>
symmetrical manner.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, an LTE system includes Packet Data Convergence<br>
Protocol (PDCP) entities 201 and 215, and RLC entities 203 and 213 per service.<br>
The PDCP entities 201 and 215 are in charge of an operation such as<br>
compression/decompression of an IP header. The RLC entity 203 reassembles<br>
RLC Service Data Units (SDUs) 217, or a packet output from the PDCP entity<br>
201, in an RLC PDU 219 in an appropriate size, and the RLC entity 213 outputs<br>
RLC SDUs 227 to the PDCP entity 215 by combining an input RLC PDU 225,<br>
and performs an ARQ operation and the like.<br>
MAC entities 205 and 211 are connected to several RLC entities 203 and<br>
213 formed in one UE, and perform an operation of multiplexing the input RLC<br>
PDU 219 to a MAC PDU 221 and demultiplexing the RLC PDU 225 from a<br>
received MAC PDU 223.<br>
Physical layers 207 and 209 make an OFDM symbol by channel-coding<br>
and modulating upper layer data and transmit the OFDM symbol over a radio<br>
channel; or demodulate and channel-decode OFDM symbols received over a<br>
radio channel and transfer the decoded OFDM symbols to an upper layer.<br>
Undepicted HARQ entities possibly provided between the MAC layers<br>
205 and 211 and the physical layers 207 and 209 exchange the MAC PDUs 221<br>
and 223 with each other through a predetermined HARQ operation.<br>
Generally, 'Layer 2 (L2)' refers to the PDCP, RLC and MAC layers 201<br><br>
to 205 (211 to 215), and 'Layer 1 (L1)' refers to the physical layers 207 and 209.<br>
The PDCP, RLC, MAC entities 201 to 205 (211 to 215) exist in pair for a<br>
transmitting side and a receiving side. For example, the transmitting-side RLC<br>
entity 203 and the receiving-side RLC entity 213 are associated with each other<br>
on a one-to-one basis.<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating a structure of RLC PDUs in a<br>
conventional mobile communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the transmitting-side RLC entity 203 transmits RLC<br>
PDUs 312 and 314 to the receiving-side RLC entity 213.<br>
In structures of the conventional RLC PDUs 312 and 314, headers 311<br>
and 313 include therein D/C field, Sequence Number field, P field, HE field,<br>
Length Indicator (LI) fields 321, 323 and 325, and Extension Bit fields 322, 324<br>
and 326.<br>
The LI fields 321, 323 and 325 are fields for generally indicating an end<br>
of each of RLC SDUs 301 to 304 included in the RLC PDUs 312 and 314, and<br>
the Extension Bit fields 322, 324 and 326 are fields for indicating whether the<br>
next succeeding field is an LI field or data (i.e., payload).<br>
The D/C field is a field indicating whether the current transmission PDU<br>
is a data PDU or a control PDU, and Sequence Number indicates a transmission<br>
number according to a transmission order of PDUs. The P field is polling bits for<br>
a polling operation, and the HE field indicates whether the next transmission octet<br>
is a start of data or an LI field.<br>
A description will now be made of structures of the RLC PDUs 312 and<br>
314 in FIG. 3 when the RLC SDUs 301 and 302 are transmitted on one RLC PDU<br>
312 and a part 327, which was cut out from the RLC SDU 302 without being<br>
transmitted in the previous transmission, is transmitted in the next RLC PDU 314<br><br>
along with the RLC SDUs 303 and 304.<br>
In FIG. 3, when several RLC SDUs 301 and 302 are included in one RLC<br>
PDU 312 or an RLC SDU 327, which was cut out without being transmitted in<br>
the previous transmission, is transmitted, the LI fields 321, 323 and 325 are each<br>
formed with 7 bits in the headers 311 and 313 in order to indicate the<br>
inclusion/partial-transmission, and the Extension Bit fields 322, 324 and 326 for<br>
indicating whether the next succeeding field is LI or data is added thereto.<br>
Specifically, in FIG. 3, the LI field 321 included in the header 311<br>
indicates an end point of the RLC SDU 301 in a payload of the RLC PDU 312,<br>
the LI field 323 included in the header 313 indicates an end point of the RLC<br>
SDU 302 in a payload of the RLC PDU 314, and the LI field 325 indicates an end<br>
point of the RLC SDU 303 in the payload of the RLC PDU 314.<br>
Since the LI fields generally indicate end points of SDUs included in the<br>
payload of each PDU as stated above, when several SDUs are bound together in<br>
one PDU during transmission, the number of LI fields increases with the number<br>
of RLC SDUs included in the payload of the PDU.<br>
The LI indicates an offset from a start point of the current transmission<br>
PDU up to an end point of an SDU which is transmitted together in the payload of<br>
the PDU. Therefore, the LI is not a simple indicator but expresses a substantial<br>
value, and the receiving-side RLC entity 213 separates each SDU from the PDU<br>
using the LI according to a math expression.<br>
In the header of an RLC PDU, the LI and Extension Bit are formed<br>
together in one byte (i.e., octet), and the LI field is followed by the Extension Bit<br>
field.<br>
When the transmitting-side RLC entity 203 transmits the RLC PDU<br>
generated as stated above, the receiving-side RLC entity 213 performs an<br>
operation of FIG 4 to check the LI.<br><br>
FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an operation for checking the<br>
conventional Extension Bit and LI.<br>
In step 401, the receiving-side RLC entity 213 extracts an octet including<br>
an LI field from a header of an RLC PDU received from the opposing RLC entity<br>
203, and extracts Extension Bit by performing a masking work. The receiving-<br>
side RLC entity 213 checks in step 403 whether the extracted Extension Bit is ' 1'.<br>
If it is '1', the receiving-side RLC entity 213 proceeds to step 405, and if it is not<br>
' 1', the receiving-side RLC entity 213 proceeds to step 407.<br>
In step 405 where the extracted Extension Bit is '1', the receiving-side<br>
RLC entity 213 determines that an LI field and an Extension Bit field of another<br>
RLC SDU exist in the next octet, and then proceeds to step 409. However, in step<br>
407 where the extracted Extension Bit is not T, the receiving-side RLC entity<br>
213 determines that data exists from the next octet, and then proceeds to step 409.<br>
In step 409, since the extracted Extension Bit is present after the LI field,<br>
the receiving-side RLC entity 213 right-shifts the octet including the LI field by 1<br>
bit before extracting the LI field, and checks LI included in the LI field in step<br>
411.<br>
To check an LI value included in an RLC PDU, the receiving-side RLC<br>
entity 213 of the conventional asynchronous system should perform masking for<br>
determining Extension Bit and then perform again a shift operation for LI after<br>
reading out a byte in which the LI is included. The shift operation should be<br>
performed for every octet including an LI field regardless of the contents of<br>
Extension Bit. Therefore, there is a demand for a scheme capable of efficiently<br>
checking LI in the receiving-side RLC entity 213.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in<br>
detail with reference to the annexed drawings. In the following description, a<br>
detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein<br>
has been omitted for clarity and conciseness. Terms used herein are defined based<br>
on functions in the present invention and may vary according to users, operators'<br>
intention or usual practices. Therefore, the definition of the terms should be made<br>
based on contents throughout the specification.<br>
The concept of the present invention will be described first. The present<br><br>
invention introduces an efficient operation of a receiving side by consecutively<br>
positioning an LI field and an Extension Bit field in generating a header of a PDU<br>
in a mobile communication system.<br>
A detailed description of the present invention will be given herein with<br>
reference to an RLC layer of a Wideband Code Division Multiple Access<br>
(WCDMA) system which is a UMTS-based OFDM communication system.<br>
However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the efficient<br>
position setting for Extension Bit, aimed by the present invention, can be applied<br>
even to other mobile communication systems supporting the similar technical<br>
background and channel format with a slight modification without departing from<br>
the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
FIG 5 is a diagram illustrating structures of RLC PDUs according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A description will now be made of structures of RLC PDUs 512 and 514<br>
in FIG. 5 when RLC SDUs 501 and 502 are transmitted on one RLC PDU 512<br>
and a part 527, which was cut out from the RLC SDU 502 without being<br>
transmitted through the RLC PDU 512, is transmitted along with RLC SDUs 503<br>
and 504 through the RLC PDU 514 which is the next transmission.<br>
In the RLC PDUs 512 and 514, if several RLC SDUs 501 and 502 are<br>
included in one RLC PDU 512, or the part 527 which was cut out without being<br>
transmitted in the previous transmission is transmitted, Extension fields 521, 523<br>
and 525 indicating whether their succeeding next fields are LI fields or data (i.e.,<br>
payloads) are each formed with 1 bit in headers 511 and 513 to indicate the<br>
inclusion/partial-transmission, and LI fields 522, 524 and 526 each are formed<br>
with 7 bits after the Extension fields 521, 523 and 525.<br>
That is, from a comparison between the structure of the RLC PDUs in the<br>
conventional asynchronous mobile communication system described with<br>
reference to FIG. 3 and the structure of the RLC PDUs in the new asynchronous<br><br>
mobile communication system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention described with reference to FIG 5, it can be understood that positions of<br>
the LI field and the Extension Bit field are exchanged.<br>
Therefore, the transmitting-side RLC entity according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention generates a PDU by inserting more than two SDUs in a<br>
payload of the PDU, and forms an LI field in a header of the PDU by generating a<br>
Length Indicator (LI) indicating an end point of each of the remaining SDUs<br>
except for the last SDU. The transmitting-side RLC entity forms the Extension<br>
Bit field by generating each Extension Bit in which an extension bit indicating the<br>
presence/absence of another LI field following each LI field is included. Further,<br>
the transmitting-side RLC entity generates the header so that each LI field<br>
succeeds its associated with the Extension Bit field, generates a PDU with the<br>
generated header and SDUs, and then transmits the generated PDU. Herein, an<br>
end point of the last SDU, since it is equal to an end point of the PDU, can be<br>
determined from all Length Indicators of the PDU delivered from the MAC layer<br>
in the same way as the conventional method.<br>
With reference to Table 1 and Table 2, a description will now be made of<br>
an analysis on the meanings of Extension Bit in the structure of the RLC PDU<br>
according to different embodiments of the present invention, in which the analysis<br>
is made in a different way from the conventional one.<br>
Table 1 shows meanings of Extension Bit in the structure of the RLC<br>
PDU according to a first embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
In Table 1, Extension Bit=l indicates that the next field is an LI field, and<br><br>
Extension Bit=0 indicates that the next field is data.<br>
Table 2 shows meanings of Extension Bit in the structure of the RLC<br>
PDU according to a second embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
As shown in Table 2, the meanings of Extension Bit in the structure of the<br>
RLC PDU according to an embodiment of the present invention can be set in the<br>
opposite manner from the meanings of the conventional Extension Bit. Since<br>
Extension Bit=0 indicates that the next field is another LI field as defined in Table<br>
2, the receiving-side RLC entity can omit a masking operation for removal of<br>
Extension Bit.<br>
FIG 6 is a flowchart illustrating an operation for receiving a structure of<br>
an RLC PDU and checking Extension Bit and LI according to the first<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In FIG. 6, an LI field is used for distinguishing each RLC SDU bound in<br>
an RLC PDU during its transmission. LI is set with a series of numerical values<br>
indicating an offset from a start point of a payload included in the RLC PDU up<br>
to an end point of the RLC SDU, and Extension Bit indicates whether the next 1<br>
byte is an LI field or a start point of the payload.<br>
The structure of the RLC PDU according to the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention is provided by applying the Extension Bit to which the<br>
meanings of Extension Bit defined in Table 1 are applied, to the RLC PDU<br>
structure according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
In step 601, the receiving-side RLC entity detects one octet including an<br>
LI field and an Extension Bit field from a header of an RLC PDU received from<br>
the opposing RLC entity, and determines whether a value of the octet exceeds a<br>
predetermined range (e.g., 0x80). If it is determined in step 601 that the value of<br>
one octet including an LI field and an Extension Bit field is greater than or equal<br>
to the predetermined range 0x80, the receiving side entity proceeds to step 603,<br>
and if the value is less than the predetermined range 0x80, the receiving side<br>
entity proceeds to step 607.<br>
In step 603 where the octet value is greater than or equal to the<br>
predetermined range, the receiving-side RLC entity determines that an LI field<br>
and an Extension Bit field for another RLC SDU exist in the next octet. The<br>
receiving-side RLC entity removes Extension Bit by masking Most Significant<br>
Bit (MSB) of the octet in step 605, and checks LI included in the LI field<br>
remaining in the octet in step 609, to separate each SDU according to the LI.<br>
However, in step 607 where the octet value is less than the predetermined<br>
range, the receiving-side RLC entity 213 determines that a payload (i.e., SDUs)<br>
exists from the next octet, and checks LI included in an LI field corresponding to<br>
the octet in step 609.<br>
Here, if a value of one octet including the LI field and Extension Bit field<br>
exceeds 0x80, the receiving-side RLC entity 213 recognizes Extension Bit as T,<br>
and if the value of one octet including the LI field and Extension Bit field does<br>
not exceed 0x80, the receiving-side RLC entity 213 recognizes Extension Bit as<br>
'0'. In this manner, the receiving-side RLC entity 213 can extract even Extension<br>
Bit. This is possible because a difference between 0 and 1 is definitely<br>
distinguished as Extension Bit comes at MSB.<br>
Shown in FIG. 6 is an exemplary structure of the general UMTS RLC<br>
PDU in which an LI field is composed of 7 bits and an Extension Bit is composed<br>
of 1 bit. A comparison value (i.e., 0x80) used for calculating a value of Extension<br>
Bit is subject to change according to the number of bits in the LI field.<br><br>
FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating an operation for receiving a structure of<br>
an RLC PDU and checking an Extension Bit and an LI according to the second<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The structure of the RLC PDU according to the second embodiment of<br>
the present invention is provided by applying the Extension Bit to which the<br>
meanings of Extension Bit defined in Table 2 are applied, to the RLC PDU<br>
structure according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In step 701, the receiving-side RLC entity detects one octet including an<br>
LI field and an Extension Bit field from a header of an RLC PDU received from<br>
the opposing RLC entity, and determines whether a value of the octet exceeds a<br>
predetermined range, i.e., 0x80.<br>
If it is determined in step 701 that the value of one octet including an LI<br>
field and an Extension Bit field is less than 0x80, the receiving side entity<br>
proceeds to step 703, and if the octet value is greater than or equal to 0x80, the<br>
receiving side entity proceeds to step 705.<br>
In step 703, the receiving-side RLC entity determines that an LI field and<br>
an Extension Bit field of another RLC SDU exist in the next octet, and checks LI<br>
included in the LI field remaining in the octet in step 709, to separate each SDU<br>
according to the checked LI.<br>
In step 705, the receiving-side RLC entity determines that a payload<br>
exists from the next octet. Thereafter, the receiving-side RLC entity removes<br>
Extension Bit by masking MSB of the octet in step 707, and checks LI included<br>
in the LI field remaining in the octet in step 709, to separate each SDU according<br>
to the checked LI.<br>
Therefore, when the transmitting-side RLC entity transmits several LI<br>
fields on one RLC PDU using the RLC PDU structure according to the second<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the receiving-side RLC entity can check<br><br>
each Extension Bit and each LI by performing N comparisons, where N is the<br>
number of LI fields, and one masking, for a header of the RLC PDU.<br>
A description will now be made of application of the RLC PDU structure<br>
according to first and second embodiments of the present invention in the next<br>
generation asynchronous system such as LTE. In LTE, LI and Extension Bit exist,<br>
and unlike in the conventional WCDMA asynchronous system, LI can be used as<br>
even a value indicating a length of each RLC SDU in the corresponding RLC<br>
PDU. Nevertheless, since LI in LTE also indicates a particular value, it is possible<br>
to apply the position of the Extension Bit field formed in one byte together with<br>
LI field in the RLC PDU structure during its transmission so that the Extension<br>
Bit field is situated in front of the LI field, according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention described with reference to FIG 5.<br>
With reference to FIGs. 8A and 8B, a description will now be made of a<br>
comparison between the conventional case where several LI fields are applied to<br>
one RLC PDU and the new case where several LI fields are applied to one RLC<br>
PDU according to the first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 8A is a diagram illustrating a structure of an RLC PDU for the<br>
conventional case where several LI fields are applied to one RLC PDU, and FIG.<br>
8B is a diagram illustrating a structure of an RLC PDU for the new case where<br>
several LI fields are applied to one RLC PDU according to the first embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
If the conventional scheme described in FIG. 4 is applied to N LI fields as<br>
shown in FIG. 8A, the receiving-side RLC entity performs N shifting, N<br>
comparisons, and N maskings.<br>
However, if the first and second embodiments of the present invention are<br>
applied as shown in FIG. 8B, the receiving-side RLC entity performs only N<br>
comparisons and (N-l) maskings (for MSB removal).<br>
As a result, if the transmitting-side RLC entity generates and transmits<br><br>
RLC PDUs in the RLC PDU structure based on the first and second embodiments<br>
of the present invention, the receiving-side RLC entity can perform an efficient<br>
operation compared with the conventional entity as N is greater.<br>
