				<td>Description<br>
The invention relates to a multipack for cigarettes -cigarette mulcipack - for a group of cigarette packs arranged in rows, said group being enclosed by a multipack blank made of (thin) cardboard.<br>
Multipacks for cigarettes, that is to say so-called cigarette multipacks, constitute packaging units which are commonly provided throughout the world for both consumers and retailers. A multipack usually con^rises ten cigarette packs, which are mostly formed in two rows of five packs each. The two rows of packs have their large surfaces (front side and rear side) butting against one another.<br>
The object of the invention is to propose a multipack for cigarettes which ensures easier handling - for the removal of the cigarette packs - has a relatively Email material consumption and, furthermore, ensures that the pack contents are presented to better effect.<br>
In order to achieve this object, the multipack according to the invention is characterized by the following features:<br>
a)	the group of cigarette packs is open on at least one (large-surface-area) side, ihat is to say it is not, or predominantly not, covered by the multipack blank,<br>
b)	the cigaretre packs are arranged such that a (large-surf ace- area) front side of the same is positioned in the region of the oper. side of the multipack blank.<br><br>
c) the unit comprising the cigarette packs and the multipack blank is (fully) enclosed by an outer wrapper rade of transparent material, namely by a cellophane or plastic filn.<br>
Accordingly, in the case cf the multipack according to the invent i en, the mul::ipack blank is designed such that a preferably large-surface-area (front) wall is com&gt;pletely, or more or less completely, absent, with the result that the cigarerte packs are exposed in this region. These packs are positioned such that, in the region of the open pack side, the front surfaces of the cigarette packs, that is to say the specifically configured visible surfaces, are exposed and are thus directly visible. The consumer can thus see the contents of the multipack directly. Nevertheless, the outer film wrapper ensures that the multipack remains a closed unit.<br>
For production reasons, but also for presentation reasons, the multipack blank, according to a further feature of the invention, may be configured such that a border strip is provided preferably on one side in the region of the open (front) side of the multipack. The configuration of this border strip may correspond to the shape and/or the configuration of the front side of the cigarette packs.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a multipack for cigarettes - cigarette multipack - for a group of cigarette packs arranged in rows, said group being enclosed by a multipack blank made of (thin) cardboard, characterized by the following features:<br>
a)	the group of cigarette packs is open on at least one (large-surface-area) side -top side- that is to say it is not, or predominantly not, covered by the multipack blank,<br>
b)	the cigarette packs are arranged such that a (large-surface-area) front side of the same is positioned in the region of the open top side of the multipack blank,<br>
c)	the unit comprising the cigarette packs and the multipack blank is (fully) enclosed by an outer wrapper made of transparent material, namely by a cellophane or plastic film.<br>
Further details and features of the cigarette multipack according to the invention are explained more specifically hereinbelow with reference to the exemplary embodiments illustrated in the drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1     shows a perspective view of a multipack for cigarettes.<br>
Figure 2     shows a spread-out multipack blank for a multipack according to figure 1.<br><br>
Figure 3  shows,  in a  illustration  corresponding  to fig^jre 1, another embodlnient o£ a multipack.<br>
Figure 4  shovs a  spr=si-out  multipack blank  for a ^lUlcipack accircing to figure 3,<br>
Figure 5  shows a perspec-ive view of a third exemplary erroodi.Tient of a -ultipack, and<br>
Figure 6  shows a multipack blank for a pack according to figure 5.<br>
The drawings relate to nultipacks for cigarettes, that is to say to so-called cigarette multipacks. A group of cigarette packs 10 is enclosed by a multipack blank 11. The multipack blank consists of a strong but foldable material, in particular of (Chin) cardboard.<br>
For the exemplary embodiment of figure 1, the multipack blank is designed (figure 2) and folded such that a large-surface-area side of the multipack,■ namely a top side 12, is free or open. The pack contents - the group of cigarette packs 10 - are merely enclosed by a base wall 13, two elongate side walls 14, 15 and by two small-surface-area end walls 16, 17. The cigarette packs 10 are free or uncovered in the region of the open top side 12.<br>
The cigarette packs 10 are positioned within the multipack, or the multipack blank 11, in a formed group, to be precise in two rows, of which the top row in figure 1 is visible in the region of the top side 12. Within the row, the cigarette packs 10 have their narrow side surfaces butting against one another. A front side IS of the cigarette packs of the top row is directed toward the top side 12, that is to say ic is exposed and thus visible.<br><br>
In the case of the exer.plary embodiment sho&gt;,-n, the front side IS of the cigarette packs 10 is configured specifically, namely with curved closing edges 19 and 20 belonging to a lid and a box part. The closing edges 19, 2 0 are spaced apart and run parallel co one another. .-. subregion of a collar arranged wichin the cigarette pac!
The unit corprising the cigarette packs 10 and the multipack blank 11 is enclosed by an outer wrapper 22. The latter consists of a transparent or see-through film (cellophane or plastic). The outer wrapper 22 preferably fully encloses the multipack, that is to say it encloses it in the region of all sides. Overlapping folding tabs of the outer wrapper 22 are connected to one another in a known manner by adhesive bonding or by heat sealing.<br>
For the purpose of opening the multipack, the outer wrapper 22 is provided with an opening aid, to be precise with a tear-open strip 23 running all the way round. In the present case, this is arranged in the longitudinal center of the elongate, cuboidal multipack, with the result that opening the tear-open strip 23 running all the way round - with the aid of an exposed grip end 31 - produces two (approximately) equally sized subregions of the outer wrapper 22, which can easily be removed from the pack. The tear-open strip 23 may also be positioned eccentrically, for example such that a "cap" of the outer wrapper 22 can be removed once the tear-open strip 23 has been removed.<br><br>
For the purpose of forming the end walls 16, 17,	the<br>
multipack bla-ik, 11 is provided with inner tabs 24,	25,<br>
which are provided in extension of the side walls	14,<br>
15. A (rectangular}  cover tab 2 6 is located in	the<br>
region of the base wail 13. This cover tab forms	the<br>
outside  of  the  end  wall  16,   17  and  extends<br>
(approximatelvj over the entire surface area of	the<br>
same.<br>
Folding lines 27 for separating off the base wall 13 from the side walls 14, 15 are provided with punched cuts 28, which facilicate the folding operation when the group of cigarette packs 10 are wrapped.<br>
The exemplary embodiment according to figures 3 and 4 differs from that described above in that the open side of the multipack, that is to say the top side 12. has a border strip 29 at one border. This border strip extends in the region of the open top side 12, over the entire length of the same. The border strip 29 makes it easier for the group of cigarette packs 10 to be wrapped by the multipack blank 11 and, furthermore, is suitable for carrying decorative printing and/or printed information. The border strip 29 is not connected to Che end walls 16, 17. The border strip 29 is held in abutment against the cigarette packs 10, or the front sides 18 thereof, by the outer wrapper 22. The border strip 29 can be moved freely once the outer wrapper 22 has been removed.<br>
In the case of the exemplary embodiment according to figures 5 and 6, a specifically configured border strip 29, namely with a contoured border edge 30, is provided. In the present case, said border edge is of approximately undulating design and is adapted to the design of the front sides 18 of the cigarette packs 10. namely to the configuration of the closing edge 19, 20.<br><br>
By virtue of the multipack blank 11 interacting with Che outer wrapper 22, the multipack described ensures a large stable and closed pack for cigarette packs. The folding tabs of the end walls 15, 17 are connected to one another, in particular by adhesive bonding, with the result that the di.Tiensional stability of the multipack, which is open or.  one side, is ensured.<br><br>
