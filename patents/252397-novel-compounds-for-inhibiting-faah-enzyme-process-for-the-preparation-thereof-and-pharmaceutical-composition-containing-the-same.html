a carbon chain which can have from 1 to 3 carbon<br>
atoms;<br>
alkyl is understood to mean a saturated,<br>
linear or branched, aliphatic group; for example a<br>
C1-6-alkyl group represents a linear or branched<br>
carbon chain of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, more<br>
particularly a methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl,<br>
butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, pentyl or hexyl;<br>

or branched divalent carbon chain of 1 to 3 carbon<br>
atoms, more particularly a methylene, ethylene,<br>
1-methylethylene or propylene;<br>

The compounds of the invention can be<br>
prepared according to the method illustrated by the<br>
following scheme.<br><br><br>
The compounds of the invention can be<br>
prepared by reacting an amine of general formula (II),<br>
in which R1, A, R2, p, m and n are as defined in the<br>
general formula (II), with a carbonate of general<br>
formula (III), in which Z represents a hydrogen atom or<br>
a nitro group, R3 is as defined in the general formula<br>
(I) and R represents a methyl or ethyl group, in a<br>
solvent, such as toluene, dichloroethane, acetonitrile<br><br>
or a mixture of these solvents, at a temperature of<br>
between 0°C and 80°C. The carbamate-esters of general<br>
formula (IV) thus obtained are subsequently converted<br>
to compounds of general formula (I) by aminolysis using<br>
an amine of general formula R4NH2, where R4 is as<br>
defined in the general formula (I). The aminolysis<br>
reaction can be carried out in a solvent, such as<br>
methanol or ethanol, or a mixture of solvents, such as<br>
methanol and tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) or (IV)<br>
in which R1 represents a group of aryl-aryl, aryl-<br>
heteroaryl, heteroaryl-aryl or heteroaryl-heteroaryl<br>
type can also be prepared by reaction of the<br>
corresponding compounds of general formula (I) or (IV)<br>
for which R5 is substituted by a chlorine, bromine or<br>
iodine atom or by a triflate group in the position<br>
where the R7 group has to be introduced with an aryl- or<br>
heteroarylboronic acid derivative according to the<br>
Suziki reaction conditions (Chem. Rev., 1995, 95, 2457-<br>
2483) or with an aryl- or heteroaryltrialkylstannane<br>
derivative according to the Stille reaction conditions<br>
(Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 1986, 25, 504-524).<br>
The carbonates of general formula (III) can<br>
be prepared according to any method described in the<br>
literature, for example by reaction of an alcohol of<br>
general formula HOCHR3COOR, where R represents a methyl<br><br>
or ethyl group, with phenyl or 4-nitrophenyl chloro-<br>
formate in the presence of a base, such as<br>
triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine.<br>
The compounds of general formula (II) and the<br>
amines of general formula R4NH2, when their method of<br>
preparation is not described, are commercially<br>
available or are described in the literature or can be<br>
prepared according to various methods described in the<br>
literature or known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
	The compounds of general formula (IV) in<br>
which R1, A, R2, R3, p, m and n are as defined in the<br>
general formula (I) and R represents a methyl or ethyl<br>
group are novel and also form part of the invention.<br>
They are of use as synthetic intermediates in the<br>
preparation of the compounds of general formula (I).<br>
The examples which will follow illustrate the<br>
preparation of a few compounds of the invention. These<br>
examples are not limiting and only illustrate the<br>
invention. The microanalyses, the IR and NMR spectra<br>
and/or the LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography coupled to Mass<br>
Spectroscopy) confirm the structures and the purities<br>
of the compounds obtained.<br>

Celsius.<br>
The numbers shown in brackets in the titles of the<br>
examples correspond to those in the 1st column in the<br><br>
table below.<br>

The chemical structures and the physical<br>
properties of a few compounds according to the<br>
invention are illustrated in the following table. In<br>
this table:<br>
- all the compounds are in the free base form,<br>
- n-butyl represents a linear butyl group.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The compounds of the invention have formed<br>
the subject of pharmacological trials which make it<br>
possible to determine their inhibitory effect on the<br>
enzyme FAAH (Fatty Acid Amido Hydrolase).<br>
The inhibitory activity was demonstrated in a<br>
radioenzymatic test based on the measurement of the<br>
product of hydrolysis ( (1-3H)ethanolamine) of ((1-3H)<br>
ethanolamine)-anandamide by FAAH (Life Sciences (1995),<br>
56, 1999-2005 and Journal of Pharmacology and<br><br>
Experimental Therapeutics (1997), 283, 729-734). Thus,<br>
mouse brains (minus the cerebellum) are removed and<br>
stored at -80°C. The membrane homogenates are prepared<br>
at the time of use by homogenization of the tissues<br>
with a Polytron in a 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0)<br>
comprising 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA. The enzymatic<br>
reaction is subsequently carried out in 70 µl of buffer<br>
comprising bovine serum albumin free from fatty acids<br>
(1 mg/ml). The test compounds, at various<br>
concentrations, the ( (1-3H)ethanolamine)-anandamide<br>
(specific activity of 15-20 Ci/mmol), diluted to 10 µM<br>
with non-radiolabelled anandamide, and the membrane<br>
preparation (400 µg of frozen tissue per assay) are<br>
successively added. After 15 minutes at 25°C, the<br>
enzymatic reaction is halted by addition of 140 µl of<br>
chloroform/methanol (2:1). The mixture is stirred for<br>
minutes and is then centrifuged at 3500 g for 15<br>
minutes. An aliquot (30 µl) of the aqueous phase<br>
comprising the (1-3H) ethanolamine is counted by liquid<br>
scintillation.<br>
Under these conditions, the most active<br>
compounds of the invention exhibit IC50 values<br>
(concentration which inhibits the control enzymatic<br>
activity of FAAH by 50%) of between 0.001 and 1 µM.<br>
For example, compounds Nos. 39 and 40 in the<br>
table exhibit IC50 values of 0.095 and 0.098 µM<br><br>
respectively.<br>
It is therefore apparent that the compounds<br>
according to the invention have an inhibitory activity<br>
on the enzyme FAAH.<br>
	The in vivo activity of the compounds of the<br>
invention was evaluated in a test for analgesia.<br>
Thus, the intraperitoneal (i.p.)<br>
administration of PBQ (phenylbenzoquinone, 2 mg/kg in a<br>
0.9% sodium chloride solution comprising 5% of ethanol)<br>
to male OF1 mice weighing 25 to 30 g causes abdominal<br>
tractions, on average 30 twisting or contracting<br>
motions during the period from 5 to 15 minutes after<br>
injection. The test compounds are administered, orally<br>
(p.o.) or intraperitoneally (i.p.) in suspension in<br>
0.5% Tween 80, 60 minutes or 120 minutes before the<br>
administration of PBQ. Under these conditions, the most<br>
powerful compounds of the invention reduce by 3 5 to 70%<br>
the number of tractions induced by the PBQ, within a<br>
range of doses of between 1 and 3 0 mg/kg.<br>
For example, compound No. 57 in the table<br>
reduces by 37% and by 74% the number of tractions<br>
induced by the PBQ, at a dose of 3 mg/kg p.o., at 60<br>
minutes and at 120 minutes respectively.<br>
The enzyme FAAH (Chemistry and Physics of<br>
Lipids, (2000), 108, 107-121) catalyses the hydrolysis<br>
of endogenous derivatives of amides and esters of<br><br>
various fatty acids, such as N-arachidonoylethanolamine<br>
(anandamide), N-palmitoylethanolamine,<br>
N-oleoylethanolamine, oleamide or<br>
2-arachidonoylglycerol. These derivatives have various<br>
pharmacological activities by interacting, inter alia,<br>
with the cannabinoid and vanilloid receptors.<br>
The compounds of the invention block this<br>
decomposition pathway and increase the tissue level of<br>
these endogenous substances. They can therefore be used<br>
in the prevention and treatment of pathologies in which<br>
endogenous cannabinoids and/or any other substrate<br>
metabolized by the enzyme FAA.H are involved.<br>
