Description<br>
PIGMENT DISPERSIONS WITH POLYMERIC DISPERSANTS HAVING<br>
PENDING CHROMOPHORE GROUPS Technical field<br>
[0001]  The present invention relates to stable pigment dispersions and pigmented inkjet inlcs comprising colour pigments that are stabilized by polymeric dispersants having pending chordophone groups which exhibit a structural similarity with the colour pigment.<br>
Background art<br>
[0002] Pigment dispersions are made using a dispersant. A dispersant is a<br>
Substance for promoting the fomentation and stabilization of a dispersion of pigment particles in a dispersion medium. Dispersants are generally surface-active materials having an anionic, cationic or non-ionic structure. The presence of a dispersant substantially reduces the dispersing energy required. Dispersed pigment particles may have a tendency to re-agglomerate after the dispersing operation, due to mutual attraction forces. The use of dispersants also counteracts this re-agglomeration tendency of the pigment particles.<br>
[0003]  The dispersant has to meet particularly high requirements when used for inkjet inks. Inadequate dispersing manifests itself as increased viscosity in liquid systems, loss of brilliance and/or hue shifts. Moreover, particularly good dispersion of the pigment particles is required to ensure unimpeded passage of the pigment particles through the no2:zles of the print head, which are usually only a few micrometers in diameter. In addition, pigment particle agglomeration and the associated blockage of the printer nozzles has to be avoided in the standby periods of the printer.<br>
[0004]  Polymeric dispersants contain in one part of the molecule so-called anchor groups, which adsorb onto the pigments to be dispersed. In a spatially separate part of the molecule, polymeric dispersants have polymer chains sticking out and whereby pigment particles are made compatible with the dispersion medium, i.e. stabilized.<br>
[0005]  The properties of polymeric dispersants depend on both the nature of the monomers and their distribution in the polymer. Polymeric dispersants<br><br>
obtained by randomly polymerizing monomers (e.g. monomers A and B polymerized into ABBAABAB) or by polymerizing alternating monomers (e.g. monomers A and B polymerized into ABABABAB) generally result in a poor dispersion stability. Improvements in dispersion stability were obtained using graft copolymer and block copolymer dispersants.<br>
[0006]  Graft copolymer dispersants consist of a polymeric backbone with side chains attached to the backbone.<br>
CA 2157361 (DU PONT) discloses pigment dispersions made by using a graft copolymer dispersant with a hydrophobic polymeric backbone and hydrophilic side chains.<br>
[0007]  Block copolymer dispersants containing hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks have been disclosed in numerous inkjet ink patents. US 5859113 (DU PONT) discloses an AB block copolymer dispersant with a polymeric A segment of polymerized glycidyl (meth)acrylate monomers reacted with an aromatic or aliphatic carboxylic acid, and a polymeric B segment of polymerized alkyl (meth)acrylate monomers having 1-12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, hydroxy alkyl (meth)acrylate monomers.<br>
[0008]  In the design of polymeric dispersants for aqueous inkjet inks, the above mentioned anchor groups, which adsorb onto the pigments to be dispersed, are generally hydrophobic groups exhibiting an affinity for the pigment surface.<br>
[0009]    EP 0763580 A (TOYO INK) discloses an aqueous type pigment<br>
dispersing agent having a portion which has a high affinity with a pigment and which has at least one type selected from the group consisting of an organic dye, anthraquinone and acridone only at a terminal end or at both terminal ends of at least one aqueous polymer selected from the group consisting of an aqueous linear urethanic polymer and an aqueous linear acrylic polymer. EP 0763378 A (TOYO INK) discloses similar pigment dispersing agents for non-aqueous pigment dispersions.<br>
[0010]   US 5420187 (TOYO INK) discloses a pigment-dispersing agent obtained by polymerizing an addition-polymerizable monomer having an acidic functional group and other addition-polymerizable monomer in the<br><br>
presence of a polymerization initiator, the polymerization initiator being a diazotization product prepared by diazotizing at least one compound selected from the group consisting of an anthraquinone derivative having an aromatic amino group, an acridone derivative having an aromatic amino group and an organic dyestuff having an aromatic amino group. In this pigment-dispersing agent, the colorant is located in the polymeric backbone itself.<br>
[0011]    US 2003044707 (TOYO INK) discloses a dispersing agent for a pigment, comprising a specific compound having a structure wherein a phthalocyanine type molecular skeleton which is adsorptive on the pigment and an oligomer unit or polymer unit which prevents re-agglomeration of the pigment to bring out the effect of dispersion are covalently bonded, and having affinity for a medium or a solvent.<br>
[0012]   US 2004194665 (BASF) relates to pigment dispersions comprising for a pigment dispersant a substituted perylene derivative in which the substituent has a satirically stabilizing and/or electrostatic ally stabilizing effect. The perylene derivatives are used to disperse pigments with a quite different chemical structure such as quinacridone pigments.<br>
[0013]   WO 2005056692 (SUN CHEMICAL) discloses highly concentrated<br>
colorant dispersions comprising: (a) at least about 45 wt. % of a pigment; and (b) a polymeric colored dispersant having the structure A- (B-X)n, wherein: A is an organic chromophore; B is a covalently bonded linking moiety; X is a branched or linear C50-C200 polymeric covalently linked hydrocarbon; and n is an integer from 1 to 4. The chromophore group A is present In the polymeric dispersant either as an end group or in the polymeric backbone. The polymeric dispersants are used for dispersing pigments with quite different chemical structure compared to the chromophore group A.<br>
[0014]   For consistent image quality, the Inkjet ink requires a dispersion stability capable of dealing with high temperatures (above SO^'C) during transport of the ink to a customer and changes in the dispersion medium of the Inkjet ink during use, for example, evaporation of solvent and Increasing concentrations of humectants, penetrates and other additives.<br><br>
Quinacridone pigments are very suitable for manufacturing magenta Inkjet<br>
Inks but the stability remains problematic. [0015]  Therefore, it is highly desirable to be able to manufacture stable<br>
pigmented magenta Inkjet Inks based on quinacridone pigments using a<br>
polymeric dispersant obtained by simple synthesis. Objects of the invention [0016]  It is an object of the present invention to provide magenta Inkjet inks using<br>
a polymeric dispersant obtainable by uncomplicated synthesis. [0017]  It is a further object of the present invention to provide magenta Inkjet inks<br>
based on quinacridone pigments with high dispersion stability. [0018]  It is a further object of the present invention to provide Inkjet inks<br>
producing images of high Image quality with a high optical density. [0019]  Further objects of the Invention will become apparent from the description<br>
hereinafter. Summary of the invention [0020]   It has been surprisingly found that magenta Inkjet inks based on<br>
quinacridone pigments with high optical density and high stability were<br>
obtained using a colored polymeric dispersant having pending<br>

pigment on a homopoly-mers backbone, [0021]  Objects of the present invention have been realized with a pigment<br>

The initiator can be a thermal initiator, but is preferably a photo-initiator. The photo-initiator requires less energy to activate than the monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers to form the polymer. The photo-initiator suitable for use in the curable fluid may be a Norrish type I initiator, a Norrish type II initiator or a photo-acid generator.<br>
Polymeric dispersants<br>
[0055]  The polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention contains one or more pending chromophore groups linked by a linking group to a polymeric backbone.<br>
[0056]  The polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention preferably has a polymeric backbone with a polymerization degree DP between 5 and 1000, more preferably between 10 and 500 and most preferably between 10 and 100.<br>
[0057]  The polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention preferably has a number average molecular weight Mn between 500 and 30000, more preferably between 1500 and 10000.<br>
[0058]  The polymeric dispersant has preferably a polymeric disparity PD smaller than 2, more preferably smaller than 1.75 and most preferably smaller than 1.5.<br>
[0059]  The polymeric dispersant is used in the pigmented inkjet ink in an amount of 5 to 600 wt%, preferably 10 to 100 wt% based on the weight of the pigment.<br>
Polymeric backbones<br>
[0060]  The polymeric backbone of the polymeric dispersant used in the<br>
pigmented inkjet ink according to the present invention is required for the compatibility between polymeric dispersant and dispersion medium.<br><br>
[0061] In a preferred embodiment the polymeric backbone of the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented inkjet ink according to the present invention is a homopolymer<br>
[0062]   It is not required that the polymeric backbone has an affinity for the pigment. For example, the polymeric backbone of a dispersant for aqueous inkjet inks can be a homopolymer of acrylic acid monomers. A homopolymer is generally incapable of dispersing pigments, but the presence of a pending chromophore group exhibiting a similarity with the pigment ensures an adequate affinity between polymeric dispersant and pigment surface.<br>
[0063]  For aqueous based inkjet inks, the homopolymer is preferably a polymer of (meth)acrylic acid monomers or macromonomers such as mPEG (meth)acrylates. For solvent based inkjet inks, the homopolymer is preferably a polymer of alky! or functional alkyl meth(acrylates) and macromonomers such as polyesters (meth)acrylates.<br>
[0064]  In one embodiment the polymeric dispersant can be prepared by<br>
copolymerization with a monomer containing a chromophore group. It was observed that the pigment-based monomers containing a chromophore group were stable in the presence of radicals. This polymerization method offers the advantage of well-controlled design of polymeric dispersants for a wide variety of dispersion media. Classical free radical polymerization (FRP) techniques for preparing statistical copolymers in a one reactor polymerization and ATRP for preparing block copolymers were possible to prepare the polymeric dispersant. Using this preparation method the polymeric backbone can also be a statistical copolymer, a block copolymer, a graft copolymer, a comb polymer or an alternating copolymer. Also suitable as polymeric backbone is a gradient copolymer as disclosed by MATYJASZEWSKI, K., et al. Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization. Chem. Reviews2001. volley, p.2921-2990. Sometimes it can be useful to include a number of monomers with a high affinity for the pigment surface to enhance certain properties of the inks, e.g. dispersion stability. For example, the polymeric backbone of a dispersant for aqueous inkjet inks may contain hydrophobic monomers to increase the affinity of<br><br>
the polymeric dispersant for the pigment surface. However in enhancing this affinity for the pigment surface, however care should be taken that enough of the polymeric backbone sticks out to make the pigment particles compatible with the dispersion medium. In graft copolymers the use of grafted chains of methoxypolyethyleneglycol (MPEG) has been found to be very advantageous in aqueous Inkjet ink. For solvent-based Inkjet inks the use of grafted chains of polyester were found to be very advantageous. A preferred MPEG macromonomer is BISOMER™ MPEG 350MA (methoxypolyethyleneglycol methacrylate) from LAPORTE INDUSTRIES LTD.<br>
[0065]  Preferred grafted chains of polyester in non-aqueous Inkjet inks are derived from 5-valerolactone , £-caprolactone and/or C1 to C4 alkyl substituted E-caprolactone. The grafted chains can be introduced into the polymeric dispersant through CD! coupling of a polyester-OH chain with a carboxylic acid group of, for example, an acrylic acid monomer in the polymeric backbone of the dispersant. However, it was observed that grafting by free radical polymeri2:ation, wherein the polyester chain already coupled to the carboxylic acid group of an acrylic acid monomer was used as a macro-monomer, not only resulted in better dispersion quality and stability of the Inkjet inks but also were obtained by a more reproducible polymeric dispersant synthesis requiring less purification.<br>
[0066]   For radiation curable inks with the dispersion medium comprising or<br>
consisting of monomers and/or oligomers, many (co)polymers having good solubility in the dispersion medium were found to be suitable for the polymer backbone of the polymeric dispersant.<br>
[0067]  The copolymeric backbone consists preferably of no more than 2 or 3 monomer species.<br>
[0068]  The monomers and/or oligomers used to prepare the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention can be any monomer and/or oligomer found in the Polymer Handbook, Vol. 1+2. 4th edition. Edited by J. BRANDRUP, et al. Wiley-lnterscience , 1999.<br>
[0069]  Suitable examples of monomers include: acrylic acid, methacrylic acid,<br>
maleic acid, acryloyloxybenzoic acid and methacryloyloxybenzoic acid (or<br><br>
their salts), maleic anhydride; alkyl(meth)acrylates (linear, branched and cycloalkyi) such as methyl(meth)acrylate, n-butyl(meth)acrylate, tert-butyl(meth)acrylate, cyclohexyl(meth)acrylate and 2-ethylhexyl(meth)acrylate; aryl(meth)acrylates such as benzyl(meth)acrylate and phenyl(meth)acrylate; hydroxyalkyl(meth)acrylates such as hydroxyethyl(meth)acrylate and hydroxypropyl(meth)acrylate; (meth)acrylates with other types of functionalities (e.g. oxirane, amino, fluoro, polyethylene oxide, phosphate-substituted) such as glycidyl (meth)acrylate, dimethylaminoethyl(meth)acrylate, trifluoroethyl acrylate, methoxypolyethyleneglycol (meth)acrylate and<br>
tripropyleneglycol(meth)acrylate phosphate; alkyl derivatives such as ally! glycidyl ether; styrenics such as styrene, 4-methylstyrene, 4-hydroxystyrene, and 4-acetoxystyrene; (meth)acrylonitrile; (meth)acrylamides (including N-mono and N,N-disubstituted) such as N-benzyl (meth)acrylamide; maleimides such as N-phenyl maleimide, N-benzyl maleimide and N-ethyl maleimide; vinyl derivatives such as vinylcaprolactam, vinylpyrrolidone, vinylimidazole, vinylnaphthalene and vinyl halides; vinylethers such as vinylmethyl ether; and vinylesters of carboxylic acids such as vinyiacetate and vinylbutyrate.<br>
Linking groups<br>
[0070]  The pending chromophore group is linked by a linking group to the<br>
polymeric backbone. The linking group contains at least one carbon atom, one nitrogen atom, one oxygen atom, one phosphorous atom, one silicon atom, one sulphur atom, one selenium atom or one tellurium atom.<br>
[0071]  The linking group consists of all atoms between the polymeric backbone and the first atom of the aromatic group by which the pending chromophore group is linked to the polymeric backbone.<br>
[0072]  The linking group has preferably a molecular weight smaller than the<br>
molecular weight of the pending chromophore group, more preferably the linking group has a molecular weight smaller than 80% than the molecular weight of the pending chromophore group, and most preferably the linking<br><br>
group has a molecular weight smaller than 50% than the molecular weight of the pending chromophore group.<br>
[0073]  In one embodiment, the linking group is the result of modification of the<br>
polymeric backbone with a chromophore having a reactive group. Suitable reactive groups on the chromophore include thiols groups, primary or secondary amino groups, carboxylic acid groups or salts thereof, hydroxyl groups, isocyanate groups and epoxy groups. Typical covalent bonds formed by reaction of the chromophore with the polymeric backbone include an amide, an ester, a urethane, an ether and a theater.<br>
[0074]  In another embodiment, the polymeric dispersant is prepared by<br>
copolymerizing monomers of the polymeric backbone and monomers containing a chromophore group. In this case the linking group is already present In the monomer. This polymerization method offers the advantage of well-controlled design of polymeric dispersants for a wide variety of dispersion media.<br>
Pending chromophore groups<br>
[0075]  The pending chromophore group of the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention exhibits a similarity with the colour pigment of the pigmented Inkjet ink. Preferably the pending chromophore group has a molecular weight smaller than 93% of the molecular weight of the colour pigment.<br>
[0076]  The pending chromophore group of the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention may be represented by Formula (II)<br><br>
wherein,<br>
L is a linking group funning a covalent bond with said polymeric backbone;<br><br>
and<br>
R1 to R8 are independently selected from the group consisting of<br>
hydrogen, an alkyl group and a halogen.<br>
[0077]  Preferably at most 45 % of the monomer units of the polymeric backbone of the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention have a pending chromophore group.<br>
[0078] Preferably at least 2 % of the monomer units of said polymeric backbone of the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention have a pending chromophore group.<br>
[0079] Preferably between 5 and 30 % of the monomer units of the polymeric backbone of the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention have a pending chromophore group.<br>
[0080]  More preferably between 10 and 30 % of the monomer units of the<br>
polymeric backbone of the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention have a pending chromophore group.<br>
[0081]  The pending chromophore group is preferably present in the range of 1 to 30 percentage, more preferably in the range 5 to 20 percentage based on the monomeric units of the polymeric backbone. Polymeric dispersants having a homopolymer or statistical copolymer as polymeric backbone with more than 45 percent of the monomeric units of the polymeric backbone having pending chromophore groups exhibit problems of solubility of the polymeric dispersant in the dispersion medium and deterioration of the dispersing properties due to the fact that the dispersant would go flat on the pigment surface. However, in the case of a well-defined block-copolymer a good dispersion can be obtained with 50 percent of the monomeric units of the polymeric backbone having pending chromophore groups. This well-defined block-copolymer preferably has at least one block containing no pending chromophore groups.<br>
[0082]   In some cases, the dispersion stability of the pigment according to the present invention can be further improved by increasing the number of pending chromophore groups in the polymeric dispersant. In a preferred embodiment, two, three or more pending chromophore groups are located<br><br>
in close proximity of each other on the polymeric backbone. Close proximity means preferably less than 50 monomeric units, more preferably less than 20 monomeric units and most preferably less than 10 monomeric units between two pending chromophore groups. It is believed that the dispersion stability improvement by more pending chromophore groups is due to the dynamic character of the attaching and detaching of the pending chromophore group to the pigment surface. By increasing the number of pending chromophore groups, the probability that all pending chromophore groups will be in a "detached state" at the same time is expected to decrease.<br>
Synthesis<br>
[0083]  The polymerization process may be a condensation polymerization, in<br>
which the chain growth is accompanied by elimination of small molecules such as water or methanol or an addition polymerization, in which the polymer is formed without the loss of other materials. Polymerization of the monomers can be conducted according to any conventional method such as bulk polymerization and semi-continuous polymerization.<br>
[0084]  The synthesis is preferably perfomied by a controlled radical<br>
polymerization (CRP) technique. Suitable polymerization techniques include ATRP (atom transfer radical polymerization), RAFT (reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization), MADIX (reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer process, using a transfer active xanthenes), catalytic chain transfer (e.g. using cobalt complexes), GTP (group transfer polymerization), or nit oxide (e.g. TEMPO) mediated polymerizations.<br>
[0085]   In one embodiment the polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention is prepared by a post-polymerization modification with a chromophore. The chromophore is covalently linked to the polymer backbone of the polymeric dispersant. The post-polymerization modification can be any suitable reaction, e.g. an esterification reaction.<br>
[0086]  An esterification reaction suitable for post-polymerization modification can be performed using N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole (GDI). In a first step, the<br><br>
carboxyiic moieties of the polymer are activated with GDI to fonn an intermediate imidazole, which is then esterified with the chromophore having a reactive hydroxyl group. The completion of the first step can be observed when the CO2 degassing stops. Synthesis scheme with R representing the chromophore group:<br><br>
Side products of the reaction can be removed by acidifying the aqueous medium used for precipitation of the polymer (hydrolysis of remaining activated esters and protonation of imidazole that remains in water, in this way achieving the separation from the polymer). If the final modified polymer is water-soluble (e.g. modified homopolymer of acrylic acid), a dialysis can be performed to purify the polymer.<br>
Monomers with a chromophore group<br>
[0087]  The monomer with a chromophore group for the preparation of the<br>
polymeric dispersant used in the pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention can be represented by the general formula:<br><br>
A represents an ethylenically unsatured polymerisable functional group;<br>
L represents a divalent linking group; and<br>
B represents a substituted or unsubstituted quinacridone moiety. [0088]  In a preferred embodiment, the ethylenically unsatured polymerisable<br>
group is selected from the group consisting of a styrene, an acrylate, a<br>
methacrylate, an acrylamide, a methacrylamide, a maleimide, a vinyl ester<br>
and a vinyl ether. [0089]  A suitable monomer with a substituted or unsubstituted quinacridone<br>
moiety can be represented by Formula (GEN-I)<br><br><br><br><br>

[0110]  Suitable humectants include traction, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. glycerol, urea, thiourea, ethylene urea, alkyl urea, alkyl thiourea, dialkyl urea and dialkyl thiourea, idols, including ethanediols, propanediols, propanetriols, butanediols, pentanediols, and hexahedrons; glycols, including propylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, and mixtures and derivatives thereof.

Preparation of a pigmented Inkjet ink<br>
[0111]  The pigmented Inkjet ink according to the present invention may be<br>
prepared by precipitating or milling the pigment in the dispersion medium in the presence of the polymeric dispersant.<br>
[0112]   Mixing apparatuses may include a pressure kneader, an open kneader, a planetary mixer, a dissolver, and a Dalton Universal Mixer, Suitable milling and dispersion apparatuses are a ball mill, a pearl mill, a colloid mill, a high-speed disperser, double rollers, a bead mill, a paint conditioner, and triple rollers. The dispersions may also be prepared using ultrasonic energy.<br>
[0113]  Many different types of materials may be used as milling media, such as glasses, ceramics, metals, and plastics. In a preferred embodiment, the grinding media can comprise particles, preferably substantially spherical in shape, e.g. beads consisting essentially of a polymeric resin or yttrium stabilized zirconium beads.<br>
[0114]   In the process of mixing, milling and dispersion, each process is preferably perfomied with cooling to prevent build up of heat.<br>
[0115]   In the process of mixing, milling and dispersion, each process is performed with cooling to prevent build up of heat, and for radiation curable Inkjet inks as much as possible under light conditions in which actinic radiation has been substantially excluded.<br><br>
[0116]  The Inkjet ink according to the present invention may contain more than<br>
one pigment, the Inkjet ink may be prepared using separate dispersions for each pigment, or alternatively several pigments may be mixed and co-milled in preparing the dispersion.<br>
[0117]  The dispersion process can be carried out in a continuous, batch or semi-batch mode.<br>
[0118]  The preferred amounts and ratios of the ingredients of the mill grind will vary widely depending upon the specific materials and the intended applications. The contents of the milling mixture comprise the mill grind and the milling media. The mill grind comprises pigment, polymeric dispersant and a liquid carrier such as water. For Inkjet inks, the pigment is usually present in the mill grind at 1 to 50 wt%, excluding the milling media. The weight ratio of pigment over polymeric dispersant is 20:1 to 1:2.<br>
[0119]  The milling time can vary widely and depends upon the pigment,<br>
mechanical means and residence conditions selected, the initial and desired final particle size, etc. In the present invention pigment dispersions with an average particle size of less than 100 nm may be prepared.<br>
[0120]  After milling is completed, the milling media is separated from the milled particulate product (in either a dry or liquid dispersion foci) using conventional separation techniques, such as by filtration, sieving through a mesh screen, and the like. Often the sieve is built into the mill, e.g. for a bead mill. The milled pigment concentrate is preferably separated from the milling media by filtration.<br>
[0121]   In general it is desirable to make the Inkjet inks in the form of a<br>
concentrated mill grind, which is subsequently diluted to the appropriate concentration for use in the Inkjet printing system. This technique permits preparation of a greater quantity of pigmented ink from the equipment. By dilution, the Inkjet ink is adjusted to the desired viscosity, surface tension, colour, hue, saturation density, and print area coverage for the particular application.<br>
Spectral Separation Factor<br><br>
[0122]  The spectral separation factor SSF was found to be an excellent measure to characterize a pigmented Inkjet ink, as it takes into account properties related to light-absorption (e.g. wavelength of maximum absorbance Amax, shape of the absorption spectrum and absorbance-value at Amax) as well as properties related to the dispersion quality and stability.<br>
[0123]  A measurement of the absorbance at a higher wavelength gives an<br>
indication on the shape of the absorption spectrum. The dispersion quality can be evaluated based on the phenomenon of light scattering Induced by solid particles in solutions. When measured in transmission, light scattering in pigment inks may be detected as an increased absorbance at higher wavelengths than the absorbance peak of the actual pigment. The dispersion stability can be evaluated by comparing the SSF before and after a heat treatment of e.g. a week at  ,<br>
[0124]  The spectral separation factor SSF of the ink is calculated by using the data of the recorded spectrum of an ink solution or a jetted image on a substrate and comparing the maximum absorbance to the absorbance at a higher reference wavelength Aref .The spectral separation factor is calculated as the ratio of the maximum absorbance Amax over the absorbance Fab at a reference wavelength.<br>
SSF  -   	<br>
[0125]  The SSF is an excellent tool to design Inkjet ink sets with large colour<br>
gamut. Often Inkjet ink sets are now commercialized, wherein the different inks are not sufficiently matched with each other. For example, the combined absorption of all inks does not give a complete absorption over the whole visible spectrum, e.g. "gaps" exist between the absorption spectra of the colorants. Another problem is that one ink might be absorbing In the range of another ink. The resulting colour gamut of these Inkjet ink sets is low or mediocre,<br>

Red E5B02 from CLARIANT was used. [0128]  The chemical structure of the colour pigments used is listed in Table 2.<br><br><br>
1.	Measurement of SSF<br>
[0129]  The spectral separation factor SSF of the ink was calculated by using the data of the recorded spectrum of an Ink solution and comparing the maximum absorbance to the absorbance at a reference wavelength. The choice of this reference wavelength is dependent on the pigment(s) used: if the colour ink has a maximum absorbance Amax between 400 and 500 nm then the absorbance Aret must be determined at a reference wavelength of 600 nm,<br>
If the colour ink has a maximum absorbance Amax between 500 and 600 nm then the absorbance Aret must be determined at a reference wavelength of 650 nm,<br>
If the colour ink has a maximum absorbance Amax between 600 and 700 nm then the absorbance Aret must be determined at a reference wavelength of 830 nm. [0130] The absorbance was determined in transmission with a Shimadzu<br>
UV-2101 PC double beam-spectrophotometer. The ink was diluted to have a pigment concentration of 0.002%. In the case of a magenta ink, the ink was diluted to have a pigment concentration of 0.005%. A spectrophotometric measurement of the UV-VIS-NIR absorption spectrum of the diluted ink was performed in transmission-mode with a double beam-spectrophotometer using the settings of Table 3. Quartz cells with a path length of 10 mm were used and water was chosen as a blank.<br><br>
[0131]  Efficient pigmented Inkjet inks exhibiting a narrow absorption spectrum and a high maximum absorbance have a value for SSF of at least 30.<br>
2.	Dispersion stability<br><br>
[0132]  The dispersion stability was evaluated by comparing the SSF before and after a heat treatment of one week at 80X. Pigmented Inkjet inks exhibiting good dispersion stability have a SSF after heat treatment still larger than 30.<br>
3. Polymer analysis<br>
[0133]  Unless otherwise specified all polymers have been characterized with gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) using the following methods. Random or block copolymers were analyzed with NMR by dissolving them in a denudated solvent. For ^H-NMR ± 20 mg polymer was dissolved in 0.8 mL CDCI3 or DMS0-d6 or acetonitrile-d3 or D2O (with or without NaOD addition). Spectra were recorded on a Varian ANOVA 400 MHz instrument equipped with an ID-probe. For "^SC-NMR ± 200 mg polymer was dissolved in 0.8 mL CDCI3 or DMS0-d6 or acetonitrile-d3 or D2O (with or without NaOD addition). Spectra were recorded on a Varian Gemini2000 300 MHz equipped with a SW-probe.<br>
[0134]   Mn, Mw and polydispersity (PD) values were determined using gel<br>
permeation chromatography. For polymers dissolvable in organic solvents PL-mixed B columns (Polymer Laboratories Ltd) were used with THF+5% acetic acid as mobile phase using polystyrene with known molecular weights as calibration standards. These polymers were dissolved in the mobile phase at a concentration of Img/mL. For polymers dissolvable in water PL Aquagel OH-60, OH-50, OH-40 and/or OH-30 (Polymer Laboratories Ltd) column combinations were used depending on the molecular weight region of the polymers under investigation. As mobile phase water/methanol mixtures adjusted to pH 9.2 with e.g. disodiumhydrogen phosphate were used with or without the addition of neutral salts e.g. sodium nitrate. As calibration standards poiyacrylic acids with known molecular weights were used. The polymers were dissolved in either water or water made basic with ammonium hydroxide at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Refractive index detection was used.<br>
[0135]  An example is now given to illustrate the calculation of the average composition of a random (= statistical) copolymer P(MAA-c-EHA).<br><br>
The Mn of the copolymer was determined with GPC to be 5000,<br>
The molar percentage of each monomer type by NMR was determined to<br>
be: 45 mole% MAA and 55 mole% EHA.<br>
Calculation:<br>
(0.45 X MMAA) + (0.55 x MEHA) = 140.09<br>
5000 /140.09 = total number of monomeric units in average polymer<br>
chain = 36<br>
Average number of MAA units = 0.45 x (5000/140.09) = 16 units<br>
Average number of EHA units = 0.55 x (5000/140.09) = 20 units<br>
Thus, the average composition is P(MAAi6-c-EHA2o).<br>
4.	Particle size<br>
[0136]  The particle size of pigment particles in pigmented Inkjet ink was<br>
determined by photon corelation spectroscopy at a wavelength of 633 nm with a 4mW Hone laser on a diluted sample of the pigmented Inkjet ink. The particle size analyzer used was a Malvern™ nano-S available from Goffin-Meyvis.<br>
[0137]  The sample was prepared by addition of one drop of ink to a covet containing 1.5 mL water and mixed until a homogenous sample was obtained. The measured particle size is the average value of 3 consecutive measurements consisting of 6 runs of 20 seconds. For good ink jet characteristics (jetting characteristics and print quality) the average particle size of the dispersed particles is preferably below 150 nm.<br>
5.	Calculation of %MW<br>
[0138]  The %MW is calculated as the ratio of the molecular weight of the pending chromophore group over the molecular weight of the colour pigment multiplied by 100.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0139]  This example illustrates that stable magenta Inkjet inks can be prepared using a polymeric dispersant having a pending chromophore group. The polymeric backbone of the dispersant is a homopolymer, which is known to have poor dispersing capability.<br>
Polymeric dispersant DISP-2<br><br><br>
Chromophore MAG-1<br>
[0142]  25 g (80 mmol) PV19 was suspended in 200 mL DMSO. 17.9 g (160<br>
mmol) Kobe was added and the suspension was heated to TO'C. 21.64 g (104 mmol) 2-(2-bromoethoxy)-tetrahydro-2H-pyran was added and the reaction was allowed to continue for 3 hours at 70'C. After cooling down to room temperature, 300 mL of water is added. The crude intennediate was isolated by filtration, washed with water and dried. The crude intennediate was suspended in 500 mL acetone. 8.0 mL HCI (cone.) was added and the reaction was allowed to continue for 1 hour at room temperature. N-hydroxyethyl-quinacridone was isolated by filtration, washed with aceton, resuspended in aceton, again isolated by filtration and dried. The crude product was used for polymer modification without further purification. The yield was 92 %.<br><br><br>
Synthesis of polymeric dispersant DISP-2<br>
[0144]  The reaction was performed in a three-necked round-bottomed flask that was equipped with a stirrer, a cooler and a bubble-counter on top. 2 g of the poiyacrylic acid homopolymer (VERSICOL E5 as powder form) was introduced in the flask and dissolved in 40 mL of anhydrous dimethylacetamide (DMA). A slight flux of nitrogen was circulated through the flask. After (VERSICOL E5) was dissolved, 2,24 g of 1.1'-carbonyldiimidazole (CD!) was added and CO2 evolution was observed. The reaction was further stirred at room temperature for 1 hour after which 1.97 g of the chromophore MAG-1 in combination with 84.5 mg of the catalyst dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) were added. The heterogeneous mixture was stirred and heated to SO^'C for 20 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and was treated by slowly adding 10 mL of a 2% v/v of acetic acid/water solution.<br>
The heterogeneous mixture obtained was basified to pH 10 with NaOH and filtrated to remove remaining precipitates. The solution was dialyzed in water (Regenerated Cellulose Dialysis Membrane of MWCO of 1,000 Dalton - SPECTRA/POR™ 6) for two days and precipitates that appeared were filtered off again. The obtained solution was freeze-dried to give a reddish and fluffy powder. Yield of DISP-2 was 4.8 g.<br>
[0145]  Analytical results of DISP-2: GPC: Mn = 2698; Mw = 24843; PD = 9.21 (aqueous GPC; calibrated vs. PAA-standards) Although that the desired modification did take place, the degree of<br><br>
substitution of DISP-11 with the chromophore MAG-1 could not be<br>
estimated by NMR. Preparation of  0146]  Tie magenta inkjet inks were prepared in the same manner to obtain a<br>
composition as described in Table 4, except that different dispersants<br><br>
[0147]  An ink composition was made by mixing the pigment, the dispersant and about half of the water with a dissolver and subsequently treating this mixture with a roller mill procedure using yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide-beads of 0.4 mm diameter ("high wear resistant zirconia grinding media" from TOSOH Co.). A polyethylene flask of 60 mL was filled to half its volume with grinding beads and 20 g of the mixture. The flask was closed with a lit and put on the roller mill for three days. The speed was set at 150 rpm. After milling the dispersion was separated from the beads using a filter cloth. Under stirring, the surfactant Surfynol™ 104H and the biocide Propel™ Ultra 5, glycerol, 1,2-propanediol and the remaining water were added. This mixture was stirred for 10 minutes and filtered. The filtration was performed in two steps. First, the ink mixture is filtered using a (plastipak) syringe with a microfiber disposable filtercapsule with 1pm pore diameter (GF/B microfiber from Whitman Inc.) Then the same procedure is repeated on the filtrate. After the second filtration the ink is ready for evaluation.<br>
[0148]  Using the above method, the comparative inkjet ink COMP-1 and the inventive inkjet ink INV-1 were prepared according to Table 5.<br><br><br>
[0150] From Table 6 it is clear that, although an homopolymer was used as the polymeric backbone for the dispersant, in the inventive pigmented Inkjet inks INV-1 and INV-2 the pigments were dispersed exhibiting a high dispersion quality and stability. The SSF of the inventive magenta Inkjet inkslNV-1 and INV-2 were larger than 30 and therefore can be used to compose Inkjet ink sets with high colour gamut.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
