				<td>Description<br>
Arrangement and method for converting a digital signal with a<br>
large voltage swing into a digital signal with a voltage swing<br>
which is smaller than the latter<br>
The invention relates to an arrangement for converting a first<br>
digital signal - referred to below as digital high-voltage<br>
signal for short - with a first voltage swing into a second<br>
digital signal - referred to below as digital low-voltage<br>
signal for short - with a second voltage swing which is smaller<br>
than the first voltage swing. In this context, the terms high-<br>
voltage signal and low-voltage signal only express the relative<br>
voltage ratio between the two signals and do not relate to<br>
absolute voltage ranges; the absolute voltage range is not<br>
important for the invention; for example, the two signals may<br>
each be in a voltage range of between 0 and 5 V or else in a<br>
voltage range of several hundred volts. For example, the high-<br>
voltage signal may have a voltage swing of between 0 and 10-<br>
300 V and the low-voltage signal may be in a range of between 0<br>
and 5 V. In this case, the term voltage swing should be<br>
understood as meaning the difference between the maximum<br>
voltage value and the minimum voltage value of the respective<br>
signal.<br>
An arrangement for converting a digital high-voltage signal<br>
into a digital low-voltage signal may be formed, for example,<br>
by a resistive voltage divider having at least two non-reactive<br>
resistors which are connected in series. If a digital high-<br>
voltage signal is externally applied to the series circuit, a<br>
digital voltage signal can be tapped off from each of the non-<br>
reactive resistors connected in series, which voltage signal<br>
has a smaller<br><br>
voltage swing than the digital high-voltage signal applied to<br>
the input. However, such an arrangement has the disadvantage<br>
that relatively high electrical losses occur since the digital<br>
high-voltage signal is always applied to the series circuit<br>
comprising the non-reactive individual resistors.<br>
The invention is based on the object of specifying an<br>
arrangement for converting a digital high-voltage signal into a<br>
digital low-voltage signal, in which as small electrical losses<br>
as possible occur. In addition, the intention is to<br>
simultaneously achieve DC isolation between the digital high-<br>
voltage signal and the digital low-voltage signal in a<br>
relatively simple manner.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by means of<br>
an arrangement having a threshold value detection device which<br>
compares an input signal, which is applied to the input and<br>
corresponds to the digital high-voltage signal or has been<br>
formed using the latter, with a threshold value and which - if<br>
the input signal exceeds the threshold value - generates a<br>
pulse sequence comprising switch-on and switch-off pulses. The<br>
switch-on pulses - have a predefined switch-on duration and a<br>
predefined switch-on amplitude and the switch-off pulses have a<br>
predefined switch-off duration and a predefined switch-off<br>
amplitude. In this case, the switch-off amplitude is smaller<br>
than the switch-on amplitude.  In addition,  the arrangement<br>
according to the invention has a DC isolation device which is<br>
connected to the output of the threshold value detection device<br>
and forwards the pulse sequence from the threshold value<br>
detection device, with electrical isolation, to a signal output<br>
of the DC isolation device.  The invention also provides a<br>
signal recovery device which is connected to the DC isolation<br>
device and<br><br>
generates the digital low-voltage signal using the pulse<br>
sequence which is applied to the signal output of the DC<br>
isolation device.<br>
A fundamental advantage of the arrangement according to the<br>
invention can be seen in the fact that only relatively small<br>
electrical losses occur in said arrangement. This is because a<br>
pulse sequence is generated in the arrangement according to the<br>
invention if the digital high-voltage signal has a binary logic<br>
"1"; this makes it possible to operate the DC isolation device<br>
and the signal recovery device in an electrically active manner<br>
during a logic one only when the pulse sequence generates<br>
switch-on pulses rather than permanently. During the switch-off<br>
pulses, the DC isolation device may be deactivated, as a result<br>
of which the power consumption of the entire arrangement is<br>
reduced. In this case, the power consumption of the arrangement<br>
is determined by the ratio of the switch-on duration of the<br>
switch-on pulses relative to the switch-off duration of the<br>
switch-off pulses.<br>
Another fundamental advantage of the arrangement according to<br>
the invention can be seen in the fact that DC decoupling is<br>
achieved between the digital high-voltage signal and the<br>
digital low-voltage signal as a result of the DC isolation<br>
device; electrical losses caused by the DC isolation device are<br>
small in this case since - as explained - the latter is<br>
electrically situated between the threshold value detection<br>
device, which is used to generate the pulse sequence having the<br>
switch-on pulses and the switch-off pulses, and the signal<br>
recovery device and is thus operated only while switch-on<br>
pulses are present.<br>
The digital high-voltage signal is preferably used to supply<br>
power to the threshold value detection device; for this<br>
purpose,<br><br>
a voltage regulator is preferably connected to the threshold<br>
value detection device, the digital high-voltage signal being<br>
applied to the input of said voltage regulator and said voltage<br>
regulator using this high-voltage signal to form a supply-<br>
voltage for the threshold value detection device.<br>
The voltage regulator is particularly preferably a step-down<br>
controller which ensures that the supply voltage for the<br>
threshold value detection device has a smaller voltage swing<br>
than the digital high-voltage signal at the input of the<br>
voltage regulator. The voltage regulator is preferably used to<br>
set the supply voltage for the threshold value detection device<br>
in such a manner that it has an electrical power loss which is<br>
as minimal as possible overall.<br>
In order to ensure that the threshold value detection device,<br>
the DC isolation device and the downstream signal recovery<br>
device overall generate as little power loss as possible, it is<br>
considered to be advantageous if the switch-off amplitude of<br>
the switch-off pulses is as small as possible and is ideally<br>
0 V.<br>
The signal recovery device is particularly preferably<br>
configured in such a manner that it uses the pulse sequence<br>
applied to the signal output of the DC isolation device to<br>
generate the digital low-voltage signal in such a manner that<br>
the latter has a signal profile which is proportional to the<br>
signal profile of the digital high-voltage signal, apart from<br>
any temporal offset. The binary information contained in the<br>
digital low-voltage signal particularly preferably corresponds<br>
to that in the digital high-voltage signal.<br><br>
The signal recovery device may be formed, for example, by an<br>
integrating element, for example by a corresponding operational<br>
amplifier circuit, or may comprise such an element.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, the signal recovery device may<br>
also have a microprocessor circuit which is used to form the<br>
low-voltage signal, the signal profile of which corresponds to<br>
that of the digital high-voltage signal, from the pulse<br>
sequence from the threshold value detection device.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for converting a first<br>
digital signal (high-voltage signal) into a second digital<br>
signal (low-voltage signal) with a smaller voltage swing.<br>
In this respect, the invention is based on the object of<br>
specifying a method in which as little power loss as possible<br>
is generated during conversion and in which DC isolation is<br>
nevertheless achieved between the high-voltage signal at the<br>
input and the low-voltage signal at the output.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by virtue<br>
of the fact that the first digital signal is compared with a<br>
threshold value, that, if the first digital signal exceeds the<br>
threshold value, a pulse sequence comprising switch-on and<br>
switch-off pulses is generated, the switch-on pulses having a<br>
predefined switch-on duration and a predefined switch-on<br>
amplitude and the switch-off pulses having a predefined switch-<br>
off duration and a predefined switch-off amplitude, and the<br>
switch-off amplitude being set to be smaller than the switch-on<br>
amplitude, that the pulse sequence is subjected to electrical<br>
isolation so as to form an electrically isolated<br><br>
pulse sequence, and that the electrically isolated pulse<br>
sequence is used to generate the second digital signal.<br>
Advantageous refinements of the method according to the<br>
invention are specified in subclaims.<br>
As regards the advantages of the method according to the<br>
invention and the advantages of advantageous refinements of the<br>
method according to the invention, reference is made to the<br>
statements made above in connection with the arrangement<br>
according to the invention.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below using exemplary<br>
embodiments. In this case, by way of example:<br>
figure 1 shows a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of<br>
an arrangement for converting a digital high-voltage signal<br>
into a digital low-voltage signal,<br>
figure 2 shows the temporal profile of the signals occurring<br>
in the arrangement according to figure 1,<br>
figure 3 shows an exemplary embodiment of an electrical<br>
circuit, the function of which corresponds to the block diagram<br>
according to figure 1,<br>
figure 4 shows an exemplary embodiment of a signal recovery<br>
device for the arrangement according to figures 1 and 3, and<br>
figure 5 shows another exemplary embodiment of a signal<br>
recovery device for the arrangement according to figures 1 and<br><br><br>
Figure 1 illustrates an arrangement 10 for converting a first<br>
digital binary signal - referred to below as digital high-<br>
voltage signal Uh - into a second digital binary signal -<br>
referred to below as low-voltage signal Un for short. The<br>
digital high-voltage signal Uh has, for example, a voltage Uh<br>
of between 10 V and 300 V in the case of a logic or binary<br>
"one" and a voltage of ze2:o volts in the case of a logic or<br>
binary "zero". It is assumed below by way of example that the<br>
voltage Uh is 300 volts for a logic "one".<br>
On the input side, the arrangement 10 comprises a voltage<br>
regulator 20 whose signal input E20 has the digital high-<br>
voltage signal Uh applied to it. The voltage regulator 20 uses<br>
the digital high-voltage signal Uh applied to the input to<br>
generate a supply voltage Uv and outputs the latter at an<br>
output A20. A voltage supply connection V30 of a threshold<br>
value detection device 30 is connected to the output A20 of the<br>
voltage regulator 20. The supply voltage Uv generated by the<br>
voltage regulator 20 is used to supply the threshold value<br>
detection device 30 with electrical power for its operation. In<br>
addition, the threshold value detection device 30 has a signal<br>
input E30 which has the digital high-voltage signal Uh applied<br>
to it.<br>
A DC isolation device 40 whose signal output A40 is connected<br>
to a signal recovery device 50 is arranged downstream of an<br>
output A30 of the threshold value detection device 30. The<br>
signal recovery device 50 generates the digital low-voltage<br>
signal Un at the output.<br>
The arrangement according to figure 1 can be operated as<br>
follows:<br><br>
If an input voltage which exceeds a minimum voltage (for<br>
example at least 5 V) that has been predefined for operation of<br>
the voltage regulator 20 is applied to the input E20 of the<br>
voltage regulator 20, the voltage regulator 20 is activated.<br>
During operation of the voltage regulator 20, the latter<br>
generates, at its output A20, the supply voltage Uv which,<br>
irrespective of the specific level of the high-voltage signal<br>
Uh, is largely constant on account of the regulator properties<br>
of the voltage regulator 20. The output voltage Uv may. be, for<br>
example, 5 V, to be precise irrespective of whether the high-<br>
voltage signal Uh generates a voltage of 10 volts or 300 volts<br>
in the case of a logic one.<br>
As soon as the supply voltage Uv is provided by the voltage<br>
regulator 20 at the voltage supply connection V30 of the<br>
threshold value detection device 30, the threshold value<br>
detection device. 30 is also activated. This results in the<br>
threshold value detection device 30 comparing the digital high-<br>
voltage signal Uh applied, to its signal input E30 with a<br>
threshold value (for example at least 5 V) which has been<br>
firmly predefined or firmly set in the threshold value<br>
detection device 30.<br>
If the digital high-voltage signal Uh. exceeds this threshold<br>
value, the threshold value detection device 30 generates a<br>
pulse sequence P1 comprising a multiplicity of switch-on and<br>
switch-off pulses which alternate; this is illustrated in<br>
figure 2. In this case, the switch-on pulses have a predefined<br>
switch-on duration and a predefined switch-on amplitude; a<br>
corresponding situation applies to the switch-off pulses which<br>
likewise have a predefined switch-off duration and a predefined<br>
switch-off amplitude. For example, the threshold value<br>
detection device 30 generates a<br><br>
pulse sequence having switch-on pulses which have a switch-on<br>
amplitude Ae of 5 V and a switch-on duration Tein of one<br>
millisecond, for example. The switch-off pulses have, for<br>
example, a switch-off amplitude Aa of 0 V and a switch-off<br>
duration Taus of 1 ms.<br>
In contrast, if the digital high-voltage signal Uh undershoots<br>
the threshold value predefined in the threshold value detection<br>
device 30, the threshold value detection device 30 preferably<br>
generates a DC voltage which is as small as possible at the<br>
output, for example a DC voltage of 0 V. In this case, only a<br>
single voltage potential (for example of 0 V) rather than a<br>
pulse sequence is thus applied to the DC isolation device 40.<br>
When the described pulse sequence P1 is present, the DC<br>
isolation device 40 which is, for example, an optocoupler<br>
likewise generates a pulse sequence at its signal output A40,<br>
which pulse sequence is DC-isolated from the pulse sequence P1<br>
which is applied to the input and is formed by the threshold<br>
value detection device 30. Said pulse sequence has the<br>
amplitude Ae' and is denoted using the reference symbol P2 in<br>
figure 2.<br>
The pulse sequence P2 formed by the DC isolation device 4 0<br>
passes to the signal recovery device 50 which uses the pulse<br>
sequence P2 applied to the input to form the digital low-<br>
voltage signal Un. For this purpose, the signal recovery device<br>
50 generates, at the output, a signal having a logic binary "1"<br>
in the form of an output voltage of, for example, 5 V if a<br>
pulse sequence P2 having alternating switch-on and switch-off<br>
pulses is applied to the input; if, however, a pulse sequence<br>
is not applied because the DC isolation device 40 does not<br><br>
provide a corresponding pulse sequence P2, the signal recovery<br>
device 50 generates a logic binary "0", preferably with a<br>
voltage potential of 0 V, at its output A50.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates, by way of example, the temporal profile<br>
of the digital high-voltage signal Uh, of the pulse sequences<br>
P1 and P2 at the output of the threshold value detection device<br>
30 and the DC isolation device 40, respectively, and of the<br>
resultant digital low-voltage signal Un.<br>
Figure 3 shows an exemplary embodiment of a specific circuitry<br>
implementation of the block diagram according to figure 1. The<br>
voltage regulator 20 which has the digital high-voltage signal<br>
Uh applied to its input can be seen.<br>
In addition, the threshold value detection device 30 which may<br>
comprise an operational amplifier 100, for example, can be<br>
seen. The digital high-voltage signal Uh is applied to one of<br>
the two signal inputs E1OOa of the operational amplifier 100.<br>
The other signal input E1OOb of the operational amplifier 100<br>
is connected to a reference voltage Uref which determines the<br>
threshold value of the threshold value detection device 30, as<br>
described.<br>
A pulse sequence generator 110, which generates a pulse<br>
sequence comprising successive switch-on and switch-off pulses<br>
when a corresponding drive signal is applied by the operational<br>
amplifier 100, is connected to the output A100 of the<br>
operational amplifier 100. The pulse sequence formed by the<br>
pulse sequence generator 110 corresponds to the pulse sequence<br>
P1 illustrated in figure 2.<br><br>
The output A110 of the pulse sequence generator 110 is<br>
connected to an optocoupler 130 which forms the DC isolation<br>
device 40 according to figure 1. The signal recovery device 50,<br>
which generates the digital low-voltage signal Un from the<br>
pulse sequence P2 from.the optocoupler 130 which is applied to<br>
the input, is connected to the output A130 of the optocoupler.<br>
Figure 4 shows an exemplary embodiment of the signal recovery<br>
device 50 according to figures 1 and 3. A resistor R and a<br>
capacitor C can be seen, one input E210a of an operational<br>
amplifier 210 being connected to the point 200 at which said<br>
resistor and capacitor are connected. A reference voltage Uref2<br>
(for example Uref2 = 2.5 V.) is applied to another input E210b<br>
of the operational amplifier 210.<br>
If a pulse sequence P2 is applied to the signal recovery device<br>
50, the operational amplifier 210 generates a signal having a<br>
logic "1" at the output. If, however, only a potential of 0 V<br>
rather than a pulse sequence is applied to the input E50 of the<br>
signal recovery device 50, the operational amplifier 210<br>
generates an output voltage Un of 0 V at the output A50. The<br>
circuit formed by the resistor R, the capacitor C and the<br>
operational amplifier 210 thus makes it possible to use the<br>
pulse sequence P2 applied to the input to generate a digital<br>
output signal Un which is proportional to the digital high-<br>
voltage signal Uh at the input of the threshold value detection<br>
device 30, apart from a phase shift or a temporal offset.<br>
Figure 5 shows another exemplary embodiment of a technical<br>
implementation of the signal recovery device 50 according to<br>
figures 1 and 3. A microprocessor device 300 which<br><br>
converts a pulse sequence P2, which is applied to the input,<br>
into a square-wave signal can be seen, the square-wave signal<br>
always having a logic "1" if alternating switch-on and switch-<br>
off pulses are applied to the input and otherwise having a<br>
logic "0".<br><br>

1-6,<br>
characterized in that<br><br>
the signal recovery device comprises a microprocessor circuit<br>
(300).<br>
9.	A method for converting a first digital signal (Uh) with a<br>
first voltage swing into a second digital signal (Un) with a<br>
voltage swing which is smaller than the first voltage swing,<br>
characterized in that<br>
the first digital signal is compared with a threshold<br>
value (Uref),<br>
in that, if the first digital signal exceeds the threshold<br>
value,  a pulse sequence  (P1)  comprising switch-on and<br>
switch-off pulses  is  generated,  the  switch-on pulses<br>
having  a  predefined  switch-on  duration  (Tein)  and  a<br>
predefined switch-on amplitude  (Ae)  and the switch-off<br>
pulses having a predefined switch-off duration (Taus) and<br>
a predefined switch-off amplitude,  and the switch-off<br>
amplitude being set to be smaller than the switch-on<br>
amplitude,<br>
in that the pulse sequence (P1) is subjected to electrical<br>
isolation so as to form an electrically isolated pulse<br>
sequence (P2), and<br>
in that the electrically isolated pulse sequence (P2) is<br>
used to generate the second digital signal.<br>
10.	The method as claimed in claim 9,<br>
characterized in that<br>
the electrically isolated pulse sequence (P2) is used to<br>
generate the second digital signal in such a manner that the<br>
latter has a signal profile which is proportional to the signal<br>
profile of the first digital signal, apart from a temporal<br>
offset.<br><br>
The invention relates, inter alia, to an arrangement<br>
(10) for converting a first digital signal *Uh) with a first<br>
voltage swing into a second digital signal (Un) with a voltage<br>
swing which is smaller than the first voltage swing.<br>
The invention provides a threshold value detection<br>
device (30) which compares an input signal, which is applied to<br>
the input and corresponds to the first digital signal<br>
or has been formed with the latter, with a threshold value (Uref)<br>
and which if the input signal exceeds the threshold<br>
value- generates a pulse sequence (PI) comprising switch-on<br>
and switch off pulses. A DC isolation device (40) which is conneced to the output (A30) of the threshold value detection device<br>
(30) of the threshold value detection device (30) forwards the<br>
pulse sequence (PI), with potential isolation, to a signal<br>
recovery device (50) which generates the second digital signal<br>
using the pulse sequence (P2) which is applied to the signal out<br>
put (A50) of the DC isolation device.</td>
