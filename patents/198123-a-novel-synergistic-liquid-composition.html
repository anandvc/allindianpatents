				<td>This invention relates to a novel liquid composition, which is used to reduce the nicotine content and other bad elements in the tobacco. The novel composition will be herein after called as "ABATE TOBACCO LIQUID <br>
As cigarette makers face new challenges, the pressure to understand tobacco smoke is greater than ever. There is more to smoke than meets the eye. As per the information available, each thin wisp of cigarette smoke is actually a dynamic mixture of more than 5,000 chemical compounds.<br>
The smoke that cigarette smokers draw into their lungs is "mainstream" smoke, while the smoke that comes off the burning tip of a cigarette is "Sidestream" smoke. Sidestream smoke actually contains higher sidestream smoke is not filtered and because cigarettes bum at a lower temperature when they are smoldering, leading to a less complete, dirtier combustion. The air pollution resulting from sidestream and extracted mainstream smoke is called secondhand smoke or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), and people who breathe this smoke are known as passive smokers or involuntary smokers.<br><br>
Of the thousands of chemicals in tobacco smoke, important.   Nicotine makes tobacco addictive.   The addiction to tobacco keeps people smoking long enough and heavily enough for the other chemicals in tobacco to cause heart disease, cancer, and other diseases.<br>
Tar is another substance, which is bad for mouth, throat and lungs; it is believed to cause lung cancer, emphysema and bronchial diseases. Another dangerous substance in cigarette smoke is carbon monoxide, which can cause serious heart problems.<br>
Lot of research has been done on reducing the Nicotine content in tobacco before the same is made into any one form of smoking articles. The known methods for reducing the nicotine content of tobacco generally involve the removal of the nicotine percent in the tobacco by subjecting the same to extreme conditions which remove other solubles along with nicotine. This, however, affects the flavor and aroma properties of the tobacco product.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,848,373 proposes treating the moist tobacco with an alkalinizing agent and maintaining the mixture in an aerobic environment at a pressure of about one atmosphere and a temperature in the range of 40° -<br><br>
120° F for a period of 4 to 14 weeks, however, this process is also a long drawn process.<br>
Indian Patent No. 111574 suggests the use of an aqueous emulsion which will serve as a coating for tobacco leaves for reducing the Nicotine content thereof The said film forming substance is selected from higher aliphatic alcohol ox ethylene derivative thereof, waxes, polyvinyl acetate and polyvinyl alcohol.<br>
Although, these techniques have resulted in lowering some of the bad constituents of tobacco, they do not remove all of them. Further, there has been a reduction in the flavor of the tobacco product. Accordingly, it is desired to develop a much simple and easy way of processing tobacco to reduce the Nicotine and other undesirable components contained therein.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a liquid composition consisting essentially of orbital, propylene glycol. Sodium Benzoate, polyethylene glycol, glycerol, calcium propionate, formaldehyde and calcium oxide.<br><br>
A further object of then present invention is to provide the process for treating tobacco to reduce the nicotine content as well as other undesirable elements such as tar, chloride, sugar etc.<br>
Further, the liquid composition of the present invention is not a mere admixture resulting in the aggregation of the properties of the components thereof but has synergistic effects which is evident from the foregoing description and examples. Preparation of the liquid composition:<br>
The components, mentioned above, are taken in the following proportions and mixed thoroughly with water using conventional mixing techniques.<br>
COMPOSITION<br><br>
Components	Proportion<br>
Sorbitol	2 to 5%<br>
Propylene Glycol	10 to 15%<br>
Sodium Benzoate	2 to 5%<br>
Polyethylene Glycol	3 to 10%<br>
Glycerol	10 to 15%<br>
Calcium Propionate	25 to 30%<br>
Formaldehyde	2 to 5%<br>
Calcium Oxide	30 to 35%<br>
Water Base	100%<br>
Note: The above liquid composition (ABATE) doesn"t contain any chemicals and it is composed of naturally available edible ingredients. It is totally harmless. The method of preparation is a very simple process.<br><br>
The Process of reducing the nicotine content:<br>
The tobacco is treated with the abate tobacco liquid, prepared as herein<br>
above described, to reduce the percentage of nicotine and other elements (to<br>
reduce the bad elements) at the time of pre-manufacturing of cigarettes.<br>
The First Method:<br>
The cigarette tobacco is mixed thoroughly with the abate tobacco liquid in a<br>
vessel. When the wet tobacco is taken out and squeezed within a cloth (or<br>
compressed), it is observed that a dark brownish colored liquid pours out.<br>
Then the wet tobacco is dried for about 10 minutes and maintained to the<br>
required moisture.<br>
In this process, it is observed that the tobacco retains its color even after the<br>
dark liquid is removed out. The treated tobacco is foimd to contain reduced<br>
proportion of nicotine and chloride.<br>
The Second Method:<br>
In this method, the cigarette manufacturing process was kept in mind. The<br>
cigarette tobacco is collected on a white paper and the tobacco solvent is<br>
sprinkled on it, mixed thoroughly, and allowed to be absorbed for some<br>
time.<br><br>
Here also, when the treated tobacco was analyzed, the results obtained proved that nicotine, chloride, and sugar contents were reduced. So, this method also proved to be successful even though not as effective as the first method. In both the methods, the most common factor is that neither the color nor the taste of the cigarette changed. In addition, the byproduct obtained from the above process i.e. dark brown colored liquid can be used for different purposes.<br>
The above by product obtained from tobacco can be used in medicines, industrial purposes, and the money, which is invested in this concept returns with profits.<br>
Before manufacturing cigarettes, the tobacco leaves contain moisture of about 14-15%, in addition to that another 14-15% water is added to the tobacco and is retained, say about 1-2 hours. Later on, the leaf tobacco will be processed, by passing it through the chamber of hot air in order to reduce the moisture contents and maintain the required optimum moisture. After processing the leaf tobacco, it is sent to next chamber to cut into small pieces as required, as required for manufacturing the cigarettes.<br><br>
In the above process of the present invention, there are two ways of reducing the nicotine:<br>
1)	By distilling the tobacco to the maximum extent; the by products obtained can be used for various purposes.<br>
2)	The other process is, as mentioned above, the abate tobacco liquid can be sprayed on the tobacco leaves, the same tobacco can be kept for 1-2 hours, then the tobacco will be dried through by passing hot air, thus nicotine and other parameters will be reduced in the usual process without any additional machinery or technology requirement. In this process, there is reduction of nicotine only to some extent.<br>
To refine one kilo of cigarette tobacco, the recommended "Abate tobacco liquid" i.e. 1 to 1.75 kg per one kilo of tobacco is added to the same and then allow the tobacco to absorb the liquid to about 5 to 10 minutes. After absorbing the liquid, the tobacco is compressed and the absorbed liquid is removed through the compression. Then the tobacco has to be dried through passing the hot air in a cylindrical chamber to maintain the required level of about 15 to 16% moisture, and further process and manufacture the cigarettes.<br><br>
Examples: The tobacco liquid is prepared in the proportion mentioned above and 4 samples were prepared i.e.l) Regular cigarette tobacco which is used in the normal tobacco manufacturers and 2) Extracted Nicotine cigarette tobacco 3) Treated cigarette tobacco &amp; 4) cigarette tobacco using the tobacco liquid of the present invention.<br>
The said samples were tested in a laboratory and the following table illustrates the nicotine contents.<br>

The benefits of using this tobacco liquid on tobacco is given below:<br>
The hquid can be used to reduce nicotine, tar, chloride, sugar and<br>
other bad elements from the normal cigarette tobacco.<br>
By using the liquid, it reduces bad elements from the cigarette, thus,<br>
the smoker will be happy with less health hazards.<br>
The Para - Smoker will also be satisfied, because he is not either<br>
directly or indirectly affected by the smoking of the active smoker.<br>
The liquid keeps reducing the bad and harmful elements present in the<br>
cigarette tobacco, but there will be no change in the color, or in the<br>
flavor or taste. It bums like a normal cigarette.<br>
The regular cigarette smoker does not find the difference in smoking,<br>
when he smokes the modified cigarette, which consists of less<br>
nicotine &amp; tar.<br>
By smoking the cigarettes, which consist of less nicotine, the<br>
smoker"s lifespan is also increased.<br>
The materials used to prepare the above said liquid are locally<br>
available.<br>
The cost of the liquid is not expensive.<br><br>
To remove bad elements in tobacco while manufacturing, it has to be<br>
passed thru a drying chamber, wherein the moisture should be<br>
maintained as per the requirement.<br>
Throughout the process, the tobacco will retain the softness.<br>
Weight of tobacco will reduce after the process by absent 2 to 4%<br>
when compared to the normal tobacco.<br>
For processing the tobacco using this process, there might be a<br>
requirement of additional one or two machinery.<br>
.eading laboratories have conducted international standard tests on the<br>
refined tobacco  treated by the process of the present invention and<br>
even one of the leading cigarette manufacturers in India has tested.<br>
The results are satisfactory.<br>
The By-products obtained in the process, is also in the filed of<br>
medicine, tanning and other uses.<br><br><br>
