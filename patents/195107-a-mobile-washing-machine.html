				<td>II	FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The present invention relates to a mobile washing machine with moving rollers having moving rollers disposed in the lower part of<br>
the front side or other of the washing machine main body<br>
III	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hitherto, the washing machine had fixed bases disposed at four corners of the lower part of the washing machine main body, and was installed on the plane of installation through these fixed bases<br>
In such conventional constitution, if the place of installation and place of use of the washing machine are different, the washing machine main body must be moved, but since the fixed bases do not roll when moving, it is hard to move, and sometimes it cannot be moved by one person<br>
Accordingly, there is also a washing machine having rotatable moving rollers provided in the lower part of the washing machine main body, but the moving rollers may rotate due to vibration and the washing machine main body may be moved during operation, or the vibration may increase, and it may be difficult to install depending on the direction of the moving rollers when installing on a slope<br>
- 1A-<br><br>
IV SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is hence an object of the invention to solve the above problems, by allowing to move the washing machine main body easily by moving rollers, and to install on a slight slope so as not to move during operation by the setting bases after installation<br>
To achieve the object, according to the invention, setting bases are disposed at four corners in the lower part of the washing machine main body, moving rollers are disposed at outward positions of the setting bases at front corners at least in the lower part of the washing machine main body, the lower end of the moving rollers is higher than the lower end of the setting bases, and there is a step against the lower end of the setting bases, and therefore when moving the washing machine main body, it can be easily moved by the moving rollers by inclining the washing machine main body to the front direction, and after installation, it can be installed by the setting bases only, so that it can be installed on a slight slope, while not moving during operation<br>
Preferably, adjustable bases adjustable in height are provided at front corners of the washing machine main body, and a step against the lower end of the adjustable bases is provided by setting the lower end of the moving rollers higher than the lower end of the average height of the adjustable bases, and by setting this step equal to or more than the height adjusting width of the adjustable bases, since the step is larger than the adjusting width of adjustable bases, if the adjustable bases are manipulated when<br>
2<br><br>
installing, the moving rollers do not contact with the plane of installation, so that the height adjusting effect of the adjustable bases is not lost<br><br>
