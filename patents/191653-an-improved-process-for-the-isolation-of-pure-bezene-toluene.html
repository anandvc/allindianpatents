SEAL OF PARTIES<br>
In  witness  whereof  the  parties  hereto  have  signed this<br>

For and on behalf of CSIR/IIP      For and on behalf of BPCL<br>
ANNEXURE - I PLAN OF WORK<br>
1.   Generation of the phase equilibrium data<br>
Literature survery will be made to assist in solvent selection for aromatic extraction from naphtha fraction.<br>
Basic. LLE/VLE date will be generated in batch units with model hydrocarbon mixture for the screening of new solvents/solvent combinations.<br>
The above study will be to use actual naphtha feed with the selected solvents/solvent combinations. Attempts will be made to coorelate the LLE/VLE date generated above by appropriate solutions models.<br>
2.   Generation of Mass Transfer Data on Continuous Units i)   Extraction studies<br>
Mass transfer studies will be carried out in continuous extractions units for the best sol vent/solvent combination under different operating conditions. To recover the traces of solvent in the raffinate phase, obtained in the above runs, raffinate wash study will be carriedout in extraction column using different water-to-raffinate phase ratio. Attempts will be made to simulate the data generated.<br>
ii)  Distillateion studies<br>
Hydrocarbons recovering from the extract phase will be studied in continuous distillation unit to see the purity and recovery of hydrocarbons under differnt operating conditions.<br>
Time Estimate<br>
Total time for this project will be about two years from<br>
the day solvent and feed samples are received at IIP,<br>
Dehradun.<br><br><br><br><br>
