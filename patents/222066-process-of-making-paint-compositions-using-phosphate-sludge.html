3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Process of making Paint Composition Using Phosphate Sludge and Paint Compositions Therefrom<br>
Background of Invention<br>
For protecting iron/steel sheets from corrosion, Zinc Phosphating pretreatment process of these sheets is carried out in various Industries. Zinc phosphate pretreatment process provides a corrosion resistant base for subsequent coating films. The byproduct of this Zinc phosphating process is a Pale Yellow colored sludge. This sludge mainly comprises of Ferric Phosphate (FePo4).<br>
The phosphating and sludge formation reaction can be explained as follows:<br>
PHOSPHATE COATING REACTION<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Currently voluminous amounts of the waste sludge are being disposed off as land fills, adding to the environmental burden.<br>
The sludge, a product of chemical reaction, is of consistent quality. The dried sludge is cream colored, insoluble in water and most industrial solvents.<br>
The properties of the phosphate sludge make it suitable for use in paint formulations as a Pigment / Extender / Additive / Mattening agent.<br>
Owing to the color of the sludge, paint can be made in yellow and other shades. The sludge may be used as available or it may be treated to make it more suitable for use in paints.<br>
The principal object of this invention is therefore to manufacture Paint Composition from Phosphate Sludge and method of making the same. Another object of this invention is to provide a Cost effective method of preparing Paint.<br>
Still further object is to provide different paint compositions using the Phosphate Sludge.<br>
2<br><br>
Accordingly, there are provided Paint Compositions comprising about 1 to 90% of Phosphate Sludge as Pigment/ Extender /Additive/ Mattening agent with water based or solvent based polymer binder, thickener, additive and suitable solvents.<br>
A method of making the above Paint Composition based on Phosphate Sludge by mixing the Sludge in suitable proportions to give a fine stable coating dispersion in a suitable waterborne or organic solvent borne film forming medium. The sludge may be used as available or it may be treated to make it more suitable for use in Paints.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Novel aqueous and powder coating compositions are described herein. The novelty of the invention lies in the use of waste Ferric Phosphate (FePo4) sludge obtained from metal pretreatment zinc phophating process. The disclosed coating compositions are made using the sludge as such and after treating the sludge to neutralize and dry it.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The sludge as such is composed of fine paste and small lumps, has a pale yellow appearance and contains phosphoric acid and water.<br>
Aqueous coating compositions have been formulated with the sludge sample as such.<br>
Additionally, the sludge sample may be pretreated in various ways to make it suitable for use in more different coatings compositions. The following constitutes one such process to treat the phosphate sludge. This is not exhaustive; other methods may be employed to treat the sludge.<br>
Sludge pretreatment<br>
Equal quantities of the sludge and deionised water was mixed. The pH of the solution is raised to pH7 by addition of Soda ash and /or triethyl amine and or sodium hydroxide and / or potassium hydroxide and / or mono ethanol amine, under constant stirring.<br>
This neutralized mixture thus obtained is filtered with a vacuum filter. The filtrate is given at least three washings with deionised water. The resultant filtrate was dried at 105°C.<br>
The properties of the dried sludge are as follows:<br><br>
Physical properties	Sludge<br>
Appearance	Cream<br>
Solubility	Insoluble in water &amp; most industrial solvents<br>
Volatile content	0.10%-0.5%<br>
Specific gravity	2.60-2.90<br>
Novel aqueous and powder coating compositions are disclosed herein, formulated using the phosphate sludge as such and after pretreatment.                                 <br>
           							 3<br><br>
The Aqueous Coating Compositions were formulated comprising Phosphate sludge (1-90%), Dispersing agent (0.5-2.00%), Emulsifier (0.01-5%), Freeze-thaw stabiliser (0-5%), Thickner (1-3%), Pigments (5-50%), Biocidal additives (0.01-20%), Adjuvants (0.01-20%), Binder (5-50%), and remaining water to make a coating composition.<br>
The powder coating compositions were formulated comprising dry pretreated waste phosphate sludge in powder form (1-50%) with resin (5-80%), matting hardener (0-10%), flow control agent (0-2%), degassing agent (0-2%), pigments (1-30%), plasticizer (0-2%), anticaking agent (0.02-2%),<br>
