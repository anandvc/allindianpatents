				<td>METHOD FOR TRANSESTERIFICATION OF ESTERS<br>
Technical field<br>
The invention relates to a method for transesterification of at least one component<br>
including at least one ester group with at least one component including at least<br>
one hydroxyl group.<br>
Prior art<br><br>
In the aluminum production according to the Bayer process, Al2O3 is released from<br>
finely grinded bauxite with the aid of caustic soda lye. After seeding with<br>
crystallization nuclei, pure AI(OH)3 (gibbsite) is precipitated from the sodium<br>
aluminate solution obtained therein, from which electrolytic metallic aluminum is<br>
obtained after further process steps. There remains a mixture, which chemically<br>
considered is mainly composed of ferric oxides or hydroxides, respectively,<br>
titanium oxides, alumina residues, quartz sand, calcium oxide, sodium oxide and<br>
residual caustic soda lye. Due to its red color caused by ferric oxide, this residue<br>
is designated as "red mud".<br><br>
According to the quality of the used bauxite, 1 to 1.5 tons of red mud arise as non-<br>
avoidable attendant to each produced ton of aluminum. The amount arising<br>
therein each year is several millions of tons and presents a serious environmental<br>
and disposal problem together with the already present red mud waste. The main<br>
problem is the high alkalinity of the red mud due to its content of caustic soda lye<br>
with pH values between 11 and 13. Moreover, toxically acting aluminum ions<br>
together with iron compounds present a great danger to the ground water and<br>
additionally aggravate environmentally compatible storage. Currently, the disposal<br>
of the red mud is effected substantially by storing in sealed disposal sites. The<br>
caustic soda lye exiting on the floor of the disposal site is collected and recycled<br>
into the Bayer process. However, this form of storage is costly and expensive,<br>
since large disposal site areas and plants are required and high cost arise for the<br>
transport of the red mud. Additionally, the long-term cost arising by the deposition<br>
can only be difficultly calculated and present an additional economical problem.<br><br>
Numerous attempts have been made to convert the red mud considered as waste<br>
product heretofore into utilizable reusable materials and to feed to economical<br>
utilization. Therein, in the first place, each useful approach has to aim at reduction<br>
of the highly alkaline pH value, but should also exploit the potential contained in<br>
the red mud as much as possible and offer a comprehensive utilization of the<br>
obtained components in the second place. The processing is aggravated in that<br>
the particles of the red mud have a very small diameter on average in the range<br>
between 0.1 urn and 1 urn caused by the production process.<br><br>
A newer method by Virotec International LTD, protected as "Basecon™<br>
technology", achieves a reduction of the pH value to about 9 by the conversion of<br>
red mud with sea water, and thereby opens various possibilities of application for<br>
the dealkalized red mud such as the employment as flocculating agent or as<br>
treating agent for acidic wastewaters or acidic soils, respectively.<br>
The circumstance that the use of about 1 million of tons annually within the scope<br>
of this method corresponds to less than 2 % of the annual production and thus it is<br>
not suitable to cope with the annually arising amount of red mud, and especially<br>
does not present any solution for the already deposited red mud waste, is to be<br>
considered disadvantageous in this method. Furthermore, it is to be considered<br>
disadvantageous that wide use of the various reusable materials contained in the<br>
red mud does not occur, and thus the present economical and ecological potential<br>
is not exploited.<br><br>
Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide a method, which allows<br>
material utilization of the already deposited as well as of the annually newly arising<br>
red mud as wide as possible.<br>
Presentation of the invention<br>
The object is solved according to the invention by a method for transesterification<br>
of an ester with an alcohol using red mud as reaction-promoting component,<br>
including the features of claim 1.<br><br>
Advantageous developments with convenient and non-trivial further developments<br>
of the invention are described in the further claims.<br>
According to the invention, red mud is employed as a reaction-promoting<br>
component in a method for transesterification of one or more compounds<br>
including at least one ester group with one or more compounds including at least<br>
one hydroxyl group. Such a method offers very different advantages. Besides<br>
large amounts of caustic soda lye, red mud also contains various metal oxides<br>
and hydroxides and thus serves as a highly basic and catalytically active reaction<br>
component transferring the alcoholic compounds into alcoholates and permits the<br>
transesterification reaction. Besides this basic ester alcoholysis, at the same time,<br>
basic ester hydrolyses also proceed to the residual water bound in the red mud, in<br>
which the components containing ester groups are cleaved into the corresponding<br>
carboxylic acids and alcohols. In this reaction, hydroxide ions are consumed such<br>
that the pH value of the red mud decreases. Consumption of alkaline components<br>
in the course of the reaction would present a clear disadvantage under normal<br>
conditions, since either the alkaline components have to be replaced constantly or<br>
the reuse of the catalyst would have to be abandoned. However, in the method<br>
according to the invention, these facts are utilized in advantageous manner, since<br>
red mud is available in virtually unlimited amount and the alkaline components<br>
contained in the red mud constitute no cost factor, but on the contrary the essence<br>
of the problem and are to be consumed in an amount as large as possible. The<br>
method according to the invention therefore provides in one step transesterified<br>
products, free alcoholic compounds, salts of free carboxylic acids and dealkalized<br>
red mud, which usually can be separated from each other very simply. In this<br>
manner, the method according to the invention permits a comprehensive material<br>
utilization of red mud obtaining various reusable materials, wherein both already<br>
deposited and newly arising red mud can be employed without problem and be<br>
utilized in great amounts.<br>
In an advantageous development of the invention, the method includes the<br>
following steps: a) mixing the component including the at least one ester group,<br>
the component including at least one hydroxyl group and the red mud, b) heating<br><br>
and/or mixing the produced mixture for the duration of a predetermined time<br>
interval, and c) separating at least one first liquid phase from at least one second<br>
phase, wherein the liquid phase includes at least one carboxylic acid alkyl ester<br>
and the second phase includes at least dealkalized red mud. In many cases,<br>
transesterifications are already started by mixing the reactants. However, often,<br>
these reactions proceed slowly such that heating the reaction mixture becomes<br>
required. Therefore, the component including an ester group, the alcoholic<br>
component and the red mud are mixed and subsequently heated with stirring for a<br>
certain time. In this manner, the required activation energy can be supplied to the<br>
reaction and a conversion of the educts as fast and complete as possible can be<br>
achieved with large neutralization of the red mud. After completion of the reaction,<br>
the individual reaction products separate into at least two different phases and can<br>
be separated from each other. Therein, a first liquid phase contains at least one<br>
carboxylic acid ester as a product of the transesterification. The dealkalized red<br>
mud settles in most cases without problem within short time and forms a solid<br>
phase, in which also salts of the free carboxylic acids can be present. According to<br>
educt and product composition and reaction sequence, the red mud can also be<br>
present as a polymorphous, colloidal suspension due to its small particle size<br>
instead of solid precipitate, but which has a clear phase boundary line to the first<br>
liquid phase and is simply identifiable by its intense red coloration.<br>
In another advantageous development of the method according to the invention,<br>
the component including at least one ester group is a vegetable oil. Vegetable oils<br>
predominantly consist of mono-, di- and triglycerides and are available worldwide<br>
in great variety and in large amounts. Besides various other conceivable vegetable<br>
oils, especially palm oils, soya oils or rape oils are suitable as an educt for the<br>
method according to the invention, since economically considered they present<br>
inexpensive and globally available educts, and are to be appreciated as largely<br>
unproblematic under environmental aspects due to their biological degradability.<br>
The German Federal Environmental agency for example categorizes vegetable<br>
oils in the water hazard classification 1 and thus as only slightly hazardous to<br>
water. Since, within the scope of the method according to the invention, it is not<br>
required to employ highly pure oils, by use of roughly pressed or contaminated<br>
vegetable oils, additional cost can be saved. In this manner, even waste products<br><br>
of the vegetable oil industry can be provided to advantageous utilization and also<br>
be used for obtaining reusable material. Moreover, vegetable oils have a certain<br>
portion of free fatty acids, by which already a part of the alkaline red mud<br>
components can be neutralized. Therein, the corresponding salts of the fatty acids<br>
develop, which ultimately are soaps. According to the invention, they can be<br>
separated as an additional reusable material and be used for various purposes. A<br>
reusable material also developing during this method is glycerin, which is released<br>
by the basic ester hydrolysis from the glycerides contained in the vegetable oil.<br>
For example, glycerin finds a use in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry as<br>
a valuable basic or raw material and can be obtained in large amount by the<br>
method according to the invention. All main and by-products of the reaction can<br>
thus be further used as an educt of the method according to the invention in<br>
employment of vegetable oils and present themselves a reusable material.<br>
ln another advantageous development of the method according to the invention,<br>
the component of the transesterification including at least one hydroxyl group<br>
includes one or more alcohols of the group of methanol, ethanol, propanol and<br>
butanol. Combined with the use of vegetable oil as the component including ester<br>
groups, fatty acid alkyl esters can be obtained in particularly simple manner, which<br>
present the currently most environmentally compatible fuel for diesel vehicles as<br>
the so called biodiesel. The advantages of the product biodiesel are known to the<br>
person skilled in the art. Biodiesel has appreciably lower exhaust gas values than<br>
fossil fuel, is almost sulfur-free, nontoxic, CO2-neutral and biologically degradable.<br>
Additionally, the exhaust of carbon black of an automobile filled up with biodiesel<br>
is halved.<br>
A simple and cost-effective reaction sequence is achieved in the method<br>
according to the invention in that either the component including ester group or<br>
the component including hydroxyl group functions itself as a solvent and is used<br>
for dissolving or suspending the remaining components, respectively.<br>
In another advantageous development of the method according to the invention,<br>
in the first method step a), first the red mud is suspended in the component<br>
including the hydroxyl group, and subsequently the component including the ester<br><br>
group is mixed thereto. Thereby, sticking of the red mud can be prevented and a<br>
mixture as homogenous as possible can be produced, which is the premise for a<br>
fast conversion of the reactants.<br>
ln another advantageous development of the method according to the invention,<br>
the temperature of at least one component is adjusted to a predetermined<br>
temperature value before admixture thereof. Thereby, it has been manifested<br>
advantageous to preheat especially the component including the ester group<br>
before admixture thereof. For example, this can be effected by use of a pipe heat<br>
exchanger and presents a simple method to activate the reaction on the one hand<br>
and to return thermal energy arising during the method into the process in energy<br>
and cost saving manner on the other hand.<br>
In another advantageous development of the method according to the invention,<br>
the reaction mixture is heated to about 60 °C for the period of one hour preferably<br>
with stirring in step b). In most cases, thus, optimum compromise between<br>
economy, reaction duration and maximization of yield is achieved.<br>
In another advantageous development of the method according to the invention,<br>
after step a) and particularly during step b), a fourth component is collected, which<br>
includes at least one component gaseous at room temperature and normal<br>
pressure. Gaseous compounds collected in step b) can be further utilized<br>
advantageously in manifold manner. Therein, one possible use is in the thermal<br>
utilization of reaction gases and the recycling of the thermal energy obtained<br>
therein into the process, for example for preheating the educts or for heating the<br>
reaction mixture.<br>
In another advantageous development of the method according to the invention,<br>
after step b), a fifth and a sixth component are separated from the mixture in an<br>
additional step d), wherein the fifth component includes at least one compound of<br>
the group of the C1 to C4 monoalcohols and the sixth component includes at least<br>
water. Depending on the employed educts and the selected process sequence, it<br>
has proven advantageous to remove the developed or non-reacted alcohols,<br>
respectively, or those employed as a solvent from the reaction mixture after<br><br>
execution of the reaction. Therein, preferably, present residual water is also<br>
removed. In this manner, recovery of reusable materials can be achieved on the<br>
one hand, and the subsequent separation of the at least two phases to be<br>
performed in step c) can be facilitated and accelerated on the other hand.<br><br>
In another advantageous development of the method according to the invention,<br>
the additional step d) therein includes a variation of temperature and/or pressure<br>
conditions. Therein, heating the reaction mixture above the boiling point of the<br>
compounds to be removed with subsequent distillation of the fifth and sixth<br>
components presents a simple possibility. For example, if only the alcohols<br>
methanol or ethanol are to be removed together with residual water, increase of<br>
the temperature of the reaction mixture to about 98 °C on normal pressure<br>
conditions is sufficient.<br>
ln another advantageous development of the method according to the invention,<br>
the variation of the temperature conditions includes regulation of the temperature<br>
value to about 80 °C, and the variation of the pressure conditions includes<br>
regulation of the pressure value to a value greatly reduced with respect to the<br>
normal pressure, especially below 250 hPa. These variations of the temperature<br>
and pressure conditions result in appreciable acceleration of the distillation<br>
process. These variations are advantageous especially if the fifth component also<br>
includes longer-chain alcohols such as propanol or butanol, since they have<br>
boiling points of 97 °C and 118 °C, respectively. However, the variations are not<br>
restricted to the application to these compounds and are also conceivable for<br>
removing water, methanol or ethanol. The variation of the pressure conditions can<br>
preferably be achieved with the aid of customary diaphragm pumps. Suitable<br>
parameter values for example for distilling an ethanol-water mixture are a<br>
temperature of about 80 °C and a pressure below 250 hPa.<br>
ln another advantageous development of the method according to the invention,<br>
the method includes an additional step e) after step d), in which the fifth and sixth<br>
component collectively separated in step d) is separated. For example, if in step d)<br>
an ethanol-water mixture is collectively separated, it has manifested<br>
advantageous to separate again the distilled ethanol-water mixture in the sense of<br><br>
a long-term raw material utilization into its individual components and to use the<br>
alcohol for example for another method run. However, application of step e) to all<br>
of the separable mixtures such as for example methanol-water or propanol-water<br>
is also conceivable. In another advantageous development of the method according to the invention,<br>
step e) includes at least one process for separating homogeneous mixtures,<br>
especially an extractive distillation process. Since alcohol and water often form<br>
homogeneous, azeotropic mixtures, which cannot be completely separated by<br>
simple rectification, for this case, the use of a suitable separating process is<br>
provided. Therein, besides extractive distillation processes, all of the other suitable<br>
separating processes such as for example membrane separating processes also<br>
lend themselves. In the extractive distillation process, a third compound is<br>
admixed to the azeotropic boiling binary mixture as an entrainer, thereby<br>
producing a ternary mixture. Ideally, glycerin lends itself as an entrainer, which<br>
presents a product of the reaction in the use of vegetable oils as a<br>
transesterification educt, for example, and therefore is available in great amount.<br>
However, further suitable compounds such as paraffin oil or ethane diol are also<br>
conceivable as entrainers.<br><br>
Another advantageous development of the invention results if step c) includes at<br>
least one distillation and/or filtering and/or sedimentation and/or decantation<br>
process. The separation of the first liquid phase from the second phase containing<br>
the red mud by a decantation step advantageously exploits the different values of<br>
specific gravity of the individual reaction products. Thus, the individual<br>
components of the reaction mixture can be practically quantitatively separated<br>
from each other in simple and inexpensive manner. For separating the mixture,<br>
sedimentation and filtering processes are also suitable. Separation with the aid of<br>
distillation processes is also conceivable in order to advantageously separate<br>
volatile from non-volatile components, especially the red mud.<br>
In another advantageous development of the method according to the invention,<br>
at least one sedimentation process includes separation of red mud sediments.<br><br>
Another advantageous development of the method according to the invention<br>
includes at least one filtering process, wherein the filtering step is effected by<br>
means of red mud sediments. By execution of sedimentation and filtration in<br>
series, the red mud sediments obtained in the first sedimentation step can<br>
advantageously constitute the active filter component in the following filtering step.<br>
Due to the small particle size of the red mud, thus, one obtains an extremely<br>
powerful filter element with high retention action for solid components in<br>
particularly simple and cost-reducing manner. Instead of a sedimentation step, it is<br>
also conceivable to first filter out red mud with a coarse filter element and to use it<br>
as a filter element in further filtering steps.<br>
In another advantageous development of the method according to the invention,<br>
at least one filtering process includes a filtering step by means of a vacuum filter.<br>
Since, in such case, it is not required to perform an additional sedimentation step<br>
before filtration, thus, appreciable saving of time and cost reduction associated<br>
therewith due to the higher throughput of reaction mixture result.<br>
In another advantageous development of the method according to the invention,<br>
the vacuum filter is formed in multiple stages. Due to the small particle size of the<br>
red mud, it has manifested advantageous to use a multi-stage vacuum filter for<br>
avoiding occlusion of a single filter element.<br>
In another advantageous development of the method according to the invention,<br>
at least one part of the filter cake produced by the filtering step is thermally utilized<br>
and especially combusted. The main component of the filter cake consists of red<br>
mud, which binds various combustible reaction products due to its large surface<br>
area. If one uses for example vegetable oil as component of the method including<br>
ester group, thus, the red mud filter cake contains glycerin, soaps and carboxylic<br>
acid esters as combustible components besides residues of the alcoholic<br>
component after completion of the reaction.<br>
In another advantageous development of the method according to the invention,<br>
plastic and/or wood and/or biological waste is admixed to the filter cake before<br>
thermal utilization. Besides admixture of combustible waste products such as<br><br>
plastic, wood or biological waste, the admixture of straw, pulp or combustible<br>
organic waste is also conceivable. This step thus also opens the possibility to<br>
make available material categorized as waste to an advantageous further use.<br>
ln another advantageous development of the method according to the invention,<br>
the thermal energy arising in the thermal utilization is returned to at least one of<br>
the method steps a) to c) and/or optionally d) and/or e). The thermal energy can<br>
for example serve for preheating an educt of the reaction before admixture<br>
thereof, for heating the reaction mixture to the predetermined temperature value<br>
or for performing a separating step following the reaction, especially a distillation<br>
step. Alternatively, utilization of the thermal energy for current generation is also<br>
conceivable.<br>
In another advantageous development of the method according to the invention,<br>
the method includes an additional step f) after step c), which includes separation<br>
of at least one component including at least glycerin. For example, if one uses<br>
vegetable oils as component including ester group as an educt in step a) of the<br>
method, thus one obtains glycerin as a reaction product of the transesterification<br>
among other things. Since glycerin itself is an important reusable material and can<br>
be further used in manifold manner, therefore, it is advantageously separated from<br>
the remaining mixture in step f).<br>
In another advantageous development of the method according to the invention,<br>
the method includes an additional step g) after step f), in which the at least one<br>
component including at least glycerin is separated into at least two degrees of<br>
quality. This is advantageous especially if the separated glycerin does not have<br>
the purity required for direct further use. Therefore, by step g), it is ensured that<br>
the requirements of the respective purposes of further use are correspondingly<br>
considered in the processing process.<br><br>
In another advantageous development of the method according to the invention,<br>
the method includes a further step h) after step c), which includes the separation<br>
of at least one salt of at least one carboxylic acid containing sodium ions from at<br>
least one separated phase. If salts of carboxylic acids containing sodium ions<br><br>
arise during the transesterification by basic ester hydrolysis, it is advantageously<br>
provided to separate these compounds also presenting reusable materials in the<br>
additional method step h). If for example vegetable oil is employed as the<br>
component of the method including ester group, the thus obtained carboxylic acid<br>
salts present the salts of fatty acids and are thus to be referred to as soaps.<br>
Another advantage of the method according to the invention is in that reusable<br>
materials can be obtained from products considered as waste heretofore, and<br>
even the by-products developing during reaction, which are normally undesired,<br>
present themselves reusable materials. These additional developing reusable<br>
materials can be employed in particularly advantageous manner for various<br>
purposes of use.<br>
Another advantageous development of the invention includes the use of the salt of<br>
at least one carboxylic acid separated in step h) and containing at least sodium<br>
ions, as a plant treating agent, especially in case of pest infestation. The use of<br>
this carboxylic acid salt as a pesticide is advantageous not only economically,<br>
since it allows the utilization of a reaction product of the method according to the<br>
invention, but also ecologically, since the carboxylic acid salts are biologically<br>
degradable and thus largely harmless under environmental aspects.<br>
In another advantageous development of the invention, the salt of at least one<br>
carboxylic acid containing sodium ions and used as a plant treating agent is<br>
diluted with at least one solvent, especially water. Thereby, the desired target<br>
concentration can be adjusted simply and depending on situation without<br>
restriction of the action or the biological compatibility. Thus, the carboxylic acid<br>
salt can be easily applied to the plant material to be treated as an aqueous<br>
solution with the aid of usual agricultural apparatuses.<br>
Another advantageous development of the invention includes the use of the salt of<br>
at least one carboxylic acid containing at least sodium ions and separated in step<br>
h) as a detergent, especially in cleaning and/or washing agents. The use of the<br>
separated carboxylic acid salt as a detergent is advantageously favored by the<br><br>
soapy character of this class of compound and allows additional economical<br>
utilization of a product of the method according to the invention.<br>
The dealkalized red mud arising by the method has in itself a great bandwidth of<br>
possible purposes of use.<br>
Another advantageous development of the invention includes the use of the<br>
separated, dealkalized red mud as iron-contributing component of an iron fertilizer<br>
particularly usable in the agriculture. The sufficient supply of plants with iron is of<br>
great importance especially in the agriculture, since iron promotes the chlorophyll<br>
formation and thereby the growth especially in woods and lawn. Therein, the red<br>
mud can be used in its neutral form or be specifically adjusted to a slightly basic<br>
pH value according to the purpose of employment. This is advantageous<br>
particularly with respect to the increasing acid rain, since thus regulation to the<br>
natural pH value of the soil is achieved.<br>
Another advantageous development of the invention provides that the iron<br>
fertilizer additionally includes at least limestone. The additional admixture of<br>
limestone advantageously accounts for the requirements of the agricultural plant<br>
cultivation and combines various plant growth promoting characteristics in one<br>
product, since regulated lime supply presents the basis of each fertilization.<br>
Additionally, the admixed lime provides for regulation of the pH value of the iron<br>
fertilizer.<br>
Further advantages, features and details of the invention appear by way of the<br>
following descriptions of several embodiments.<br>
Example 1:<br>
For neutralization of alkaline red mud as complete as possible, with simultaneous<br>
extraction of as many reusable materials as possible, in a first embodiment, 400<br>
ml rape oil as component including ester groups, 100 ml ethanol (96 %) as<br>
component including hydroxyl groups and 400 g red mud as reaction-promoting<br>
component are employed for the transesterification method.<br><br>
First, at room temperature, ethanol and red mud are mixed and homogenized in a<br>
reaction vessel. The homogenized mixture is mixed with rape oil and heated to 60<br>
°C with stirring. Therein, start of the reaction often is noticeable by development of<br>
gaseous compounds. After a reaction time of about one hour, the temperature is<br>
increased to about 100 °C until boiling of the mixture in order to remove excess<br>
ethanol and water from the reaction mixture. The distilled ethanol-water mixture is<br>
collected and can be separated into its individual components by methods<br>
common to the person skilled in the art. The remaining product mixture is first<br>
roughly filtered through a glass fiber filter. The filter cake containing mainly red<br>
mud is subsequently used itself as a filter body and has an excellent separating<br>
power due to the small particle size. The filtrate is filtered two more times with the<br>
aid of the red mud filter until red coloration is no longer recognizable in the filtrate.<br>
The turbid filtrate now has a neutral pH value and is transferred to a separating<br>
funnel. Within about 30 minutes to 2 hours, separation of the mixture into three<br>
phases is effected, which are separated from each other in simple manner by<br>
decanting. Therein, the first separated phase with a specific gravity of 1.22 g/cm2<br>
contains glycerin as reusable material, the second phase consists of a suspension<br>
of various fatty acid salts, and the third phase contains rape ethyl ester with a<br>
specific gravity of 0.87 g/cm3 usable as biodiesel.<br>
Example 2:<br>
In a premixer known per se with a volume of 1 m3, 0.5 t of red mud with a water<br>
portion of about 30 % (w/w, corresponding to ca. 150 I) and 500 I methanol (ca. 90<br>
%) are stirred. Instead of methanol, alternatively, ethanol, another alcohol or a<br>
mixture of different alcohols can also be used. Subsequently, the alcohol/water<br>
mixture is extracted. The water content in the red mud thereby decreases to ca.<br>
10 % (w/w), thereby appreciably improving the further processing of the red mud<br>
mass. The highly alkaline alcohol/water mixture is separated into 96 % alcohol<br>
and water by vacuum liquid extraction. The highly alkaline water is subsequently<br>
employed in a gas washing device following a steam generator.<br><br>
In second working process, subsequently, bioalcohol with 96 % ethanol is added<br>
in an amount of 250 I corresponding to two and a half times the amount required<br>
for the transesterification and stirred for a few minutes. Subsequently, the liquid<br>
mass is pumped to a transesterification reactor with ca. 1.5 m3 volume and<br>
unfiltered rape oil from the press is fed in a volume of ca. 1 m3. The rape oil is<br>
previously preheated to 60-70 °C, which is preferably effected with the aid of heat<br>
recovery from one of the following reaction stages.<br>
The mixture is subsequently heated to temperatures greater than 50 °C,<br>
advantageously to at least 60 °C, with stirring and maintained at this temperature<br>
for ca. one hour. By control of the pH value of the solution, the completion of the<br>
process can be determined in simple manner, and optionally additional vegetable<br>
oil or additional alcohol/red mud mixture, respectively, can be fed thereafter, in<br>
order to achieve a nearly complete conversion. Subsequently, the temperature is increased to ca. 80 °C and the mixture of<br>
remaining residual water and alcohol not consumed in the transesterification is<br>
sucked off with reduced pressure at ca. 250 hPa. For pressure reduction, for<br>
example, a diaphragm vacuum pump can be used. Subsequently, separation into<br>
water and alcohol is again effected through a following liquid extraction stage. The<br>
alcohol is recycled, the water is neutral and can be utilized as normal service<br>
water.<br>
The remaining ester/glycerin/soap mixture is pumped off through plural sediment<br>
filters, filtered and then pumped into a decanter, wherein separation into 3 phases<br>
quickly results due to the differences of specific gravity, which can each be<br>
pumped off separately and be used as an individual product. The alkali-free,<br>
neutral red mud sediment contains comparatively much combustible residual<br>
solution and is thermally utilized, optionally with addition of wood waste or the like.<br>
The mineral residue remaining after oxidation can be utilized as iron fertilizer or be<br>
further cleaved into magnetite and a cement addition component and separately<br>
be utilized.<br>
Example 3:<br><br>
Red mud from a disposal site with a water content between 24 and 27 % (w/w) is<br>
first heated to ca. 60 °C in a vacuum reactor with a coarse vacuum of about 100<br>
mbar with residual heat of a later combustion stage, thereby extracting water by<br>
vacuum distillation and extracting a major part of the water. After ca. 30 min., only<br>
a few percent of water are still contained. The dried red mud is then sucked off<br>
into a further reactor.<br>
In the next step, methanol is added in a proportion of methanol: red mud of about<br>
1:2 (v/w) and the mixture is intensely mixed in order to bring the methanol to all of<br>
the mineral grain surfaces and promote the formation of sodium methanolate by<br>
reaction with the NaOH chemisorbed to the surfaces. Therein, the reaction<br>
temperature is approximately between 40 and 50 °C, the reaction duration is<br>
usually between 10 and 15 min. Subsequently, vegetable oil preheated to a temperature between 50 and 70 °C<br>
preferably with waste heat of the process, for example rape, soya or palm oil, is<br>
added into the reactor in a proportion between 1:1 and 1:2 (v/w) based on red<br>
mud. The mixture temperature is maintained at 60-65 °C and the reaction is<br>
performed for about 30 min, wherein shorter reaction times are usually not<br>
reasonable due to the extremely high surface area of the red mud. During the<br>
reaction, the mixture is intensely mixed. Therein, several processes occur:<br>
Therein, the main reaction is in the transesterification of the vegetable oil with the<br>
formation of methyl esters of the free fatty acids or fatty acids released from the<br>
vegetable oil, respectively.<br>
The secondary side reactions substantially include saponification reactions<br>
between free caustic soda lye and free fatty acids formed by ester cleavage or<br>
already contained in the vegetable oil with formation of soap and glycerin in<br>
presence of water, the hydrolysis of proteins, phospholipids, among other things<br>
by the highly alkaline solution at the beginning of the process, as well as the<br>
neutralization of the caustic soda lye or the sodium carbonate, respectively, with<br>
formation of sodium salts of the fatty acids.<br><br>
After completion of the transesterification, a non-polar solvent - for example<br>
hexane - is pumped from a reservoir into the reactor in an amount corresponding<br>
to the vegetable oil. Subsequently, all of the non-polar or predominantly non-polar<br>
components, respectively, are extracted with intense mixing, which mainly include<br>
non-reacted vegetable oil as well as the developed methyl esters.<br>
In the next step, the extract is pumped into a sedimenter. After 20-30 min. settling<br>
time, individual, clearly separated fractions can be extracted. In the upper portion,<br>
therein, methyl esters and vegetable oil can be found, below a mixture of<br>
methanol, soap, glycerin and water, and as the last phase finally a bottom<br>
substantially consisting of neutralized red mud. The liquid fractions are extracted,<br>
wherein hexane and non-reacted methanol, respectively, are each distilled in<br>
vacuum in following reactor units and are subsequently returned into the cycle.<br><br>
The excess vegetable oil and the developed methyl esters are finally finely filtered<br>
and are available as valuable products. Therein, the yield of methyl ester is<br>
usually at least 40 %. Soap, glycerin and water can be converted in a further<br>
reaction step, wherein soda, water and hydrocarbons develop, which can be<br>
collected and further used as additional reusable materials.<br>
The bottom is also pumped off, optionally two or multiple times extracted with<br>
hexane for increasing the fuel yield and settled. After rough filtering out through a<br>
drum filter, the developed filter cake is transferred to a pellet press through a<br>
screw tunnel by conveying screw. In the pellet press, besides the pellets, pressed-<br>
out liquid additionally arises, which virtually contains all of the components of the<br>
previous steps. It is collected and periodically again pumped back into the reactor<br>
together with new or previously recovered vegetable oil, respectively, for complete<br>
utilization.<br><br>
The pellets are transferred into a furnace or steam generator, optimized for this<br>
mode of energy carrier, respectively, in which the organic components are then<br>
combusted to CO2 and water. Due to the high energy content of the vegetable oil,<br>
therein, correspondingly high energy amounts can be released. The generated<br><br>
water steam is advantageously utilized as a heating medium - for example for<br>
preheating the vegetable oil - potential excesses can be converted into electricity.<br>
Additionally, energy from the oxidation of iron hydroxides to hematite contained in<br>
the red mud is released. The remaining ash which is neutral or can be adjusted to<br>
a slightly basic pH value is subsequently deposited or can be used as a filler,<br>
building material, soil improver or mineral fertilizer after reduction and separation<br>
of the iron mineral.<br><br>
