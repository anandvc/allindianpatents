CHROMATOGRAPHIC MEDIA<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	The   invention   relates   to   the   preparation   and   use   of   novel<br>
chromatographic media, preferably mixed mode polymeric chromatographic media for separation and purification of various biomolecules such as peptides, proteins and antibodies. More particularly, the present invention discloses novel chromatographic media, preferably mixed anion exchangers, mixed anion-cation exchangers and hydrophobic exchangers. The chromatographic media is prepared by modification of polymers with polyethyleneimine and functionaltzation thereof. It has been unexpectedly discovered that these mixed mode polymeric media offer enhanced separation capability and protein binding capacity.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002]	The analysis of protein mixtures by ion exchange chromatography<br>
media is well documented, such as by, Pete Gagnon, Purification Tools for Monoclonal Antibodies", Validated Biosystems, Inc., (1996). More recently, the development of protein-based drugs and vaccines has increased the need for larger scale purification of protein mixtures. It is highly desirable that ion exchange chromatographic media be able to be utilized in this area.<br>
[0003]	One   way   of   preparing   such   chromatography   media   materials,<br>
particularly anion exchangers containing primary and secondary amine functionality, is by coating the internal surface of porous silica materials with polyethyleneimine (PEI). For example, coating of the internal surface of silica particle with polyethyleneimine followed by immobilization through crosslinking has been disclosed in Alpert and Regnier, J, Chromatoqr. 185. 375 - 392 (1979), and the use of materials prepared in that fashion for the chromatographic separation of synthetic oligonucleotides has been described in Lawson et al., Anal. Biochem. 133, 85-93<br><br>
(1983).<br>
[0004]	Similarly, the preparation of PE1 coated porous silica particles or<br>
controlled pore glass particles obtained by covalent binding of poiyethyleneiminopropyl-trimethoxy silane has been disclosed in US 4,540,486 of JT Baker Chemical Co. The same patent discloses the formation of chromatographic resins having mixed weak base/weak add functionality by reaction of the PE1 coated silica with cyclic carboxylic anhydrides. It has been shown that these materials, when used in a chromatographic column, can separate mixtures of cytochrome C, aifal-ackJ glycoprotein, ovalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin (weak base media) or ovalbumin, cytochrome C, hemoglobin and lysozyme (mixed weak base/weak acid media). The efficacy of the PEI derivatized porous silica, or its carboxylated version in purifying immunoglobulin G has also been demonstrated in US 4,606,825 of JT Baker Chemical Co.<br>
[0005]	The acylated form of the PEI coated silica described above can be<br>
further converted into a mixed weak acid/strong acid functionality media by the introduction of sulfonic groups, as disclosed in US 4,721,573 of JT Baker Chemical Co. A column packed with this sulfonated media allows the separation of a mixture of cytochrome C, hemoglobin, lysozyme and ovalbumin, as well as the separation of the protein components of hybridoma cell culture medium.<br>
[0006]	Silica particles to which PEI has been covalently bound can also be<br>
converted to hydrophobic chromatographic media by reaction with monoacyl chlorides or linear carboxylic anhydrides where the acyl group can be a linear hydrocarbon chain, a phenyl group or a substituted phenyl group. A silica based weak base/reverse phase chromatographic media prepared in that fashion using butyryl chloride separates cytochrome C, myoglobin, lysozyme ovalbumin and alpha-ehympotrypslnbgen, as disclosed in US 4,551,245 of JT Baker Chemical Co.<br>
[0007]	Agarose beads bearing ion exchange groups at the end of a polyvinyl<br><br>
alcohol (PVA) arm has been disclosed in WO 98/58732 to Amersham. However, unlike in the present invention, the PVA spacer arms do not contribute any ion exchange capacity to the product, nor does it in itself provide one of the functionalities in a mixed mode product.<br>
[0008]	One of the major disadvantages of silica based chromatographic<br>
packings is their lack of stability at high pH. This is particularly the case for applications involving the purification of drugs, since treatment of the equipment with 1N sodium hydroxide is a common sterilization practice.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009]	The present invention provides chromatographic media that is able to<br>
minimize or avoid this lack of stability at high pH. The invention also provides mixed mode chromatographic media. It has been discovered that one possible way to avoid this instability problem is to use chromatographic packings based on a polymeric support derivatized on the surface of the polymer (i.e., not cross-linked) with PEI, which surface derivatized media can be further functionalized by reaction of a functionalization reagent with terminal amino groups of the polyethyleneimine on the surface of the polymeric resin. In accordance with this invention there preferably can be provided mixed mode media, such as for example, media with mixed primary, secondary and tertiary amine exchange sites, media with both weak anion and weak cation exchange sites, media with weak anion, weak cation and strong cation exchange sites, media with weak anion and hydrophobic (reverse phase) exchange sites, and media with weak anion and strong anion. Furthermore, it is unexpectedly discovered that such polyethyleneimine derivatized polymeric and functionalized derivatives thereof-based chromatographic media provide different and unique separation characteristics. In one aspect of the present invention there is provided" polymeric chromatographic media for bioseparations. This invention differs from current polymeric chromatographic media by method of preparation and characteristics of the media as these current chromatographic media are simple ion<br><br>
exchangers. Also, the media of the present invention differs from current silica based media in terms of method of preparation, composition* use and performance. Surprisingly, polymeric mixed mode media prepared according to this invention have enhanced separation and binding capacities.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0011]	This invention concerns the preparation and use of novel polymeric<br>
chromatographic media and preferably mixed mode polymeric chromatographic media. In accordance with the present invention, polymeric media is prepared using polymeric particles derivatized with polyethyteneimine, and preferably such polyethyleneimine derivatized polymeric particles further functionalized with appropriate reactants.<br>
[0012]	Polymeric  materials  used  for the  chromatographic  separation  of<br>
proteins will preferably have certain properties, such as,<br>
1)	the pore sizes is sufficiently large to allow rapid diffusion of molecules as large as protein in and out of the resin particles;<br>
2)	interactions between the proteins and the non-functionalized polymer are to be weak to avoid Hnon specific interactions" and allow recovery of the desired protein in high yields;<br>
3)	the resin particles are to be rigid to avoid compression and loss of flow rate under the pressure encountered in chromatographic operations; and<br>
4)	the resin should be chemically stable under all conditions encountered in the separation process.<br>
[0013]	The   polymeric   resin   particles   to   be   surface   derivatized   with<br><br>
polyethyieneimine can be any suitable polymeric resin particles capable of being<br>
derivatized with polyethyieneimine and, with such polyethyieneimine derivatized<br>
polymers or further functionalized derivatives thereof being useful as<br>
chromatographic separation media. Examples of polymeric resin particle suitable for<br>
derivatization with polyethyieneimine in accordance with this invention include, but<br>
are not limited to cellulose, agarose, epoxidized or halogenated polystyrenes,<br>
epoxidized or halogenated polyacrylates or potymethacrylates, and epoxidized or<br>
halogenated polydMnylbenzenes. For examples, porous poly(meth)acrytates, highly<br>
cross-linked resins based on (meth)acrylic monomers bearing multiple polymerizable<br>
double bonds, such as ethylene glycol dimethacryiate (US 4,118,347 to Showa<br>
Denko, pentaerythritol trimethacrylate (US 4,256,842 to Toyo Soda) , trimethylol<br>
propane trimethacrylate (US 4,582,860 to Rohm and Haas) or glycerol<br>
dimethacryiate (US 2,254,634 to Mitsubishi) prepared in the presence of a pore<br>
forming agent, have been shown to provide materials with the desired properties.<br>
Furthermore, the addition of functional monomers to the polymerization mixture<br>
affords final product with functional groups to which other molecules can be bound<br>
through the formation of covalent bonds. Example of such monomers are glycerol<br>
methacrylate (-OH groups) (US 2,254,634 to Mitsubishi, 1993), dimethylaminoethyl<br>
methacrylate (tertiary amines) or glycidyl methacrylate (US 4,118,347 to Showa<br>
Denko, US 4,256,842 to Toyo Soda, US 4,582,860 to Rohm and Haas). As<br>
examples of suitable functionalization reagents suitable for reaction with the PEI<br>
surface-derivatized polymeric resin particles are, for example, acid anhydrides such<br>
as cyclic carboxylic anhydrides such as glutaric and succinic anhydrides,<br>
unsaturated carboxylic anhydrides such as maleic anhydride, sulfonation agent such<br>
as bisulfites such as sodium meta-bisulfite, alkyl chlorides or anhydrides such as<br>
butryl chloride and acetic or butyric anhydride,and alkyl chlorides containing<br>
quaternary	ammonium	functionality	such	as	(3-chloro-2-<br>
hydroxypropyl)trimethylammonium chloride, and mixtures of these functionalization reagents.<br>
[0014]	In one embodiment of this invention, an anion exchanger with mixed<br><br>
primary and secondary and tertiary amine sites is prepared by reacting polyethyleneimine with a polymeric support bearing epoxy or halo groups such as chloro, bromo, iodo groups. Such polymeric support can be any suitable synthetic polymer or natural polymer resin such as poly(meth)acrylatef cellulose, polystyrene-divinylbenzene, and agarose. Examples of such commercially available resins are Tosoh Biosciences Toyopearl AF-epoxy 650M, epoxy activated Sepharose 6B. These materials can be reacted with one of the terminal amino group of polyethyleneimine of various molecular weights through the formation of chemically stable alpha-hydroxy amino groups. Some of the properties of materials prepared in that manner, according to following examples 1 through 5, are summarized in Table 1.<br>
[0015]	In a second embodiment, mixed mode media with weak anion and<br>
weak cation exchange sites are prepared by reacting the PEI functionalized polymeric beads with cyclic carboxylic acid anhydrides, such as glutaric or succinic anhydride in the following examples 6 to 10.<br>
[0016]	In a third embodiment, mixed mode media having weak anion, weak<br>
cation and strong cation sites were prepared by reacting the PEI derivatized polymer with an unsaturated carboxylic acid anhydride followed by sulfonation, as described in examples 11 through 13.<br>
[0017]	In a fourth embodiment, mixed mode media having weak anion and<br>
hydrophobic (reverse phase) sites were prepared by reacting the PEI derivatized polymer with alkyl chloride (examples 14 through 18) or monobasic acids anhydrides Examples 19 through 24): Reactions with butyryl chloride were performed for 2 hr. at room temperature using either toluene or dioxane as the solvent. Triethylamine was used to scavenge the hydrochloric acid produced as a by-product of the reaction.<br>
[0018]	In a fifth embodiment, mixed mode media are obtained by reaction of<br>
the PEI coated resin with butyric anhydride conducted in 1-methoxy~2-propanol for 3<br><br>
r. at 60 °C. as set forth in following Examples 20-22.<br>
)019]	Mixed mode weak base/reverse phase resins where the hydrophobic<br>
loiety is a methyl group or a combination of methyl and butyl groups can be repared by using acetic anhydride or sequential addition of butyric and acetic nhydride, as shown in Example 24 (acetic anhydride) or in Examples 20 and 23 unmixed anhydrides) respectively. As such, it is possible to vary and select proper lydrophobictcty by using one to a combination of reagents.<br>
3020]	In a sixth embodiment, mixed mode media having weak anion, and<br>
itrong anion (quaternary ammonium) sites were prepared by reacting the PEI lerivatized polymer with alkyl chlorides containing terminal quaternary ammonium unctionality. More particularly, the PEI derivatlzed polymer is reacted with (3-chioro-&gt;-hydroxypropyl) trimethylammonium chloride in aqueous sodium hydroxide at 70-80 lC as shown in following Examples 25 to 30.<br>
P021]	In accordance to the present invention, it has been unexpectedly<br>
discovered that these polymeric mixed mode chromatographic media offer<br>
enhanced separation capability as well as high capacity and stability. For example,<br>
the polymeric mixed mode anion exchange media can separate lysozyme,<br>
immunoglobulin G, bovine serum albumin, beta- lactoglobulin A and beta-<br>
lactoglobulin B while PEI-siiica based media cannot separate all of these proteins as<br>
shown in Figure 1. The mixed mode cation exchange media can separate BSA, IgG,<br>
Cytochrome-C and Lysozyme efficiently, as shown in Figure 2, while the mixed<br>
mode silica media cannot separate all these proteins.<br>
[0022]	EXAMPLES<br>
[0023]	Example 1<br>
12 g epoxy bearing methacryate polymer with average particle size of 35 micron diameter and 250 ml dioxane are placed in a 1L round bottom flask equipped with a funnel, agitator, reflux condenser and positive nitrogen pressure<br><br>
inlet and stirred for 30 min to allow the resin to swell. 20 g polyethyleneimine (PEI, average molecular weight 600 Daltons) is added and the funnel rinsed with an additional 150 ml dioxane. The stirred mixture is refluxed overnight. After allowing the mixture to cool, the mixture is transferred to a filter flask, drained, washed once with dioxane, three times with methanol and dried under vacuum at 60°C. Elemental analysis: 57.8% C, 7.4% H and 5.6 % N.<br>
[0024]	Example 2<br>
5 g epoxy bearing methacryate polymer and 150 ml of dioxane are placed in a 500 ml round bottom flask equipped with an agitator and reflux condenser. 30 g of PEI (average molecular weight 1200 Daltons) are added and the mixture is refluxed overnight. After allowing to cool, the mixture is transferred to a filter flask, drained, washed twice with dioxane, three times with methanol and dried. Elemental analysis: 55.7% C, 7,8 % H, 5.5 % N<br>
[0025]	Example 3<br>
5 g epoxy bearing methacrylate polymer and 150 ml of a 50/50 mixture of dioxane and water are placed in a 500 ml round bottom flask equipped with an agitator and reflux. 30 g of PEI (average molecular weight 1200 Daltons) are added and the mixture is refluxed overnight (89 °C). After allowing to cool, the mixture is i transferred to a filter flask, drained, washed twice with dioxane, three times with methanol and dried. Elemental analysis indicates that the final product contains: 57.5% C, 7.4 % H, 2.5 % N<br>
[0026]	Example 4<br>
5 g epoxy bearing methacrylate polymer and 100 ml of a 30 wt % solution of 10,000 daltons average molecular weight PEI in dioxane are placed in a 250 ml round bottom flask equipped with an agitator, nitrogen inlet and reflux condenser and the stirred mixture is refluxed overnight. After allowing to coot, the mixture is transferred to a filter flask, drained, washed three times with 60 °C water, three times with methanol and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. Elemental<br><br>
analysis indicates that the final product contains: 56.5% C, 7.8 % H, 6.4 % N<br>
[0027]	Example 5<br>
5 g epoxy bearing methacrylic resin and 100 ml of a 30 wt % solution of 10,000 daltons average molecular weight PEI in water are placed in a 250 ml round bottom flask equipped with an agitator and reflux condenser and the stirred mixture is refluxed for 17 1/2 hr. After allowing to cool, the mixture is transferred to a filter flask, drained, washed three times with water, three times with methanol and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. Elemental analysis indicates that the final product contains 56.9% C, 7.5% H and 3.2% N.<br>
[0028]	As the results in Table 1 indicate, the presence of water in the system<br>
has a detrimental effect on nitrogen incorporation, while similar nitrogen contents are obtained when PEI of various molecular weight are reacted with the resin in dry dioxane (albeit at a lower PEI to polymer ratio then in example 1).<br><br><br>
pure dioxane, as opposed to dioxane/water mixture or pure water, give a higher degree of functionalization, as indicated by the nitrogen content of the final product When pure dioxane is used as the solvent (first row of Table 1), there does not appear to be a significantly higher level of nitrogen introduction as the molecular weight of the PEI is increased from 600 to 10,000 Daltons.<br>
[0030]	Example 6:<br>
30 g PEI polymer prepared as in example 1 is washed with twice its volume of 100 % ethanol and twice with its volume of 1-methoxy-2-propanol to remove any residual moisture.

[0034]	Example 10<br>
The reaction was conducted as in Example 9 except 10 g PEI polymer prepared according to Example 1 and 6.6 g succinic anhydride are used. Elemental analysis indicates that the final product contains: 54.46 %C, 7.96 %H and 4.6%N.<br><br><br><br>
