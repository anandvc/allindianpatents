				<td>[0001] This application claims priority from US provisional patent<br>
application, number 60/621,743, Attorney's docket number 199-0402PUS, filed on<br>
October 25, 2004 with the same title and assigned to the same assignee, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] This invention relates to a microphone assembly and an audio<br>
system, and relates generally to microphone assembly in a system which needs to<br>
convert sound waves to electrical signals.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
[0003] A microphone is a basic and essential element in any audio<br>
systems. There are many types of microphones in use currently. Generally, they<br>
are classified in four categories as listed in Figure 1. The first one is an omni-<br>
directional microphone 102. It has a uniform polar response, i.e., the sound waves<br>
from any directions can be accepted and an electrical signal is generated with the<br>
same gain. A second type of microphone, a dipole microphone 104, can respond to<br>
sound waves mainly from two opposite directions. Sound waves coming from other<br>
direction have a much smaller gain. The sound wave coming from a direction that<br>
is 90Â° to the axis of the microphone element is not accepted, i.e. the gain is null. A<br>
third type of microphone is a cardioid microphone 106, which can accept sound<br>
waves from one primary direction. The response gain decreases as the incident<br>
angle of a sound wave deviates from the primary direction. The response gain drop<br>
can be substantial when the incident angle is greater than a threshold. The gain<br>
reaches null at 180 degrees from the primary direction. A fourth type of microphone<br>
is a hyper-cardioid microphone 108. Hyper cardioid microphone 108 is like a hybrid<br>
of a dipole microphone and a cardioid microphone. It has a primary direction and a<br>
secondary direction, which is the opposite of the primary direction. It can respond<br>
to sound waves in both the primary and the secondary directions, but its gain for the<br>
secondary direction is less than the gain for the primary direction.<br>
[0004] An array of microphones may also be assembled to emulate the<br>
properties of the above four types of microphones in some applications. For<br>
example, non-directional microphones may be grouped together. A controller may<br>
process the signals in such a way so as to generate a signal that is highly<br>
directional, so this array of microphones acts as if it is a directional microphone.<br>
Another example is discussed in US Patent Number 5,715,319, where several<br>
directional microphones are arranged in a circular array. The resulting microphone<br>
array acts similarly to a non-directional or omni-directional microphone. In this<br>
application, a microphone element can refer to a generic single element<br>
microphone, or a multiple-element-array, which behaves similar to a single element<br>
microphone. For example, a unidirectional microphone can be a single cardioid<br>
microphone, or a microphone array that accepts sound waves from a primary<br>
direction and rejects sound waves from most other directions. The microphone<br>
elements within the microphone array may be non-directional, bi-polar or hyper-<br>
cardioid or some combination.<br>
[0005] Any one of the four types of microphones identified above has<br>
various disadvantages in audio systems, especially in audio conferencing and video<br>
conferencing applications. For example, an omni-direction microphone, which<br>
gathers sound from all directions equally, can be used in recording studios where<br>
the noise and reverberation level can be made to low, but gives poor quality in<br>
audio or video conferencing applications, because of its inability to reject<br>
reverberation and noise in a typical untreated room environment A cardioid<br>
microphone only accepts sound waves directed towards the microphone and rejects<br>
most sound waves coming from other directions. This type of microphone may<br>
provide a higher signal to noise ratio (SNR) and a better sound quality, but it can<br>
only cover a very small area in the conference room. Participants in an audio or<br><br>
video conference may have to take turns speaking to the microphone. In some<br>
conference room setups, several such microphones can be connected to the<br>
system simultaneously, so most participants of the conference have a microphone<br>
nearby available to speak into. But this type of arrangement complicates the<br>
conference room and makes the room cluttered.<br>
[0006] Although it is generally accepted that one may have to hold a<br>
microphone while giving a lecture in a large auditorium, it is still unnatural and<br>
inconvenient. In a conference situation, it is even worse. In an actual meeting,<br>
meeting participants would like to watch people's expressions on their face and<br>
other body language as they speak.<br>
[0007] There are prior art devices that avoid many of the limitations of the<br>
microphone elements. For example, a Polycom SoundStation VTX-1000<br>
speakerphone from the assignee of the current invention uses three microphone<br>
elements to provide better room coverage, SNR and frequency response. This<br>
speakerphone fulfills many requirements in a conference setting such that it<br>
appears on most conference room tables.<br>
[0008] It is more desirable to eliminate the inconvenient microphones, or at<br>
least to keep them out of sight during a conversation and minimize their<br>
interference. It is desirable to have a microphone system that can provide coverage<br>
of the entire conference room, while at the same time keeping the sound quality<br>
high and maximizing the signal to noise ratio. It is desirable to have a microphone<br>
system that can provide other high quality sound processing.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] The current invention uses multiple unidirectional microphone<br>
elements in a microphone assembly. The microphone assembly is installed<br>
overhead, generally above all the desired sound sources. The signals from these<br><br>
multiple microphone elements are fed into a microphone steering processor which<br>
mixes and gates the signals to ensure the best signal/noise ratio. The steering<br>
processor may also track the sound source dynamically when such tracking (source<br>
locating) is desired. The resulting audio signal from the steering processor may be<br>
further processed, such as echo canceling, noise reduction and automatic gain<br>
control. The microphones of the current invention can cover a large conference<br>
room. They are also scalable, that is, when the conference room grows, capacities<br>
of the microphones can grow accordingly by adding more microphones.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a microphone assembly in a room,<br>
wherein the room has a ceiling and a floor to accommodate people, and wherein<br>
the room has overhead space between any people and the ceiling, the microphone<br>
assembly comprising: a support member such as described herein; and a plurality<br>
of unidirectional microphone elements such as described herein attached to the<br>
support member, wherein all microphone elements are maintained in the overhead<br>
space by the support member.<br>
There is also provided an audio system, wherein a portion of the audio<br>
system is in a room, wherein the room has a ceiling and a floor to accommodate<br>
people, and wherein the room has overhead space between the people and the<br>
ceiling, the audio system comprising: an overhead microphone assembly in the<br>
room, wherein the overhead microphone assembly comprises, a support member;<br>
and a plurality of unidirectional microphone elements attached to the support<br>
member, wherein all microphone elements are maintained in the overhead space<br>
by the support member; an amplifier; a loudspeaker coupled to the amplifier; and a<br>
signal processor coupled to all microphone elements and the amplifier, wherein the<br>
processor module is operable to select and mix the electric signals from the<br>
microphone elements to form an audio signal, and send the audio signal to the<br>
amplifier.<br>

[0016] Figures 6 and 7 compare the angular and frequency responses of a<br>
microphone according to one embodiment of the current invention.<br>
[0017] Figure 8a and 8b illustrate a setup in a conference room according<br>
to an embodiment of the current invention.<br>
[0018] Figure 9 is a block diagram showing the signal processing for a<br>
microphone.<br>
[0019] Figures 10a, 10b, 10c, 10e, 10f and 10g illustrate some physical<br>
arrangements of a ceiling microphone according to embodiments of the current<br>
invention.<br>
[0020] Figure 2 shows a typical conference room arrangement 244. A conference participant<br>
210 sits at a conference table 222, facing a video monitor 252 at a side wall 242. A<br>
microphone 202 (or several microphone elements in a speakerphone such as a Polycom<br>
SoundStation VTX-1000 speakerphone) may be placed on the conference table 222.<br>
Speech 232 may propagate within the conference room and may be reflected by walls,<br>
e.g. 242, and ceiling 240. The reflected sound waves, which may also be referred to as<br>
room reverberation, are typically undesired and should be rejected by the microphone if<br>
possible, it can be done when a cardioid microphone is used. The cardioid microphone<br>
only accepts sound waves in one direction. The reflected sound waves, which arc in the<br>
opposite direction, are rejected. This way, the cardioid microphone can reject the<br>
unwanted first-stage reverberations from the room, leading to an improvement of the<br>
direct to reverb ratio.<br>
[0021] Since a single cardioid microphone element can only accept sound waves in a small area<br>
along the direction of its primary direction, according to an embodiment of the current<br>
invention, several microphone elements are implemented in a microphone so that the<br>
microphone can accept sound from many directions when necessary. In Figures 3a-3c,<br>
the sound response coverage of a microphone with three cardioid microphone elements is<br>
shown. The cardioid microphone elements are connected to a mic-steering controller<br>
(e.g. as shown in Figure 9), which controls and processes the signals generated by the<br>
cardioid microphone elements. In this embodiment, there are three elements 302, 304<br>
and 306, each spaced 120 degrees apart. The corresponding response coverage is shown<br>
in Figures 3a-3c. The mic-steering controller chooses the best microphone element by<br>
detecting the best audio qualities among the three elements. As shown in Figures 3a-3c,<br>
when a human talker speaks, the nearest clement is typically selected to provide the best<br>
quality audio signal. In Figure 3a, when the participant 310 speaks, the microphone<br>
clement 302 is activated, which has a response 312. The other microphone elements 304<br>
and 306 arc disabled, or ignored by the mic-steering controller. Similarly, when<br>
participant 320 speaks, only microphone element 304 is activated to provide a response<br>
314. When participant 330 speaks, only microphone element 306 is activated to provide<br>
a response 316. In Figure 3a-3c, the talkers 310, 320 and 330 are shown as three different<br>
conference room, or some combinations in between.<br>
[0022] When more than one participant speaks, then more than one microphone element may be<br>
chosen. The mic-steering controller is designed to intelligently differentiate between the<br>
human speech and other noises, such as air conditioning noise, so that it is not "fooled"<br>
by noises. This ensures that the best audio quality is always retained when a talker (or<br>
instructor in long distance education applications) walks around in a room equipped with<br>
air conditioning. The tracking speed of the controller is virtually instantaneous since no<br>
mechanical moving part is involved. The mic-steering controller simply determines<br>
which microphone clement is selected, and whose signal is further processed by the<br>
controller or other down stream processors, if any. The mic-steering controller may also<br>
perform gating and mixing to combine the signals from more thar one microphone<br>
element to form an output microphone signal.<br>
[0023] The microphone according to the above embodiment is shown to be much better than the<br>
existing commercial microphones. Figure 4 shows the equal audio-quality contours. A<br>
commercially available omni-directional microphone is used as a reference. The distance<br>
for the omni-directional to generate a fairly good audio is about 8 feet, as shown by<br>
contour 414. The same quality contour 412 for the above embodiment of the current<br>
invention is also shown. The contour 412 is almost 14 feet away from the microphone<br>
and covering about 600 square feet in area.<br>
[0024] Figures 5-7 shows more properties of the microphone of the above embodiment. Figure 5<br>
shows a frequency response curve 510 at the direction of a microphone element Figure 6<br>
further shows the frequency response for different angles of incidence. Since the<br>
microphone has three identical cardioid elements placed 120 degrees apart and that the<br>
cardioid elements are symmetric, it is only necessary to exam the performance of one<br>
element at 0 degree to +60 degree. The performance curves at -60 degree to 0 degree are<br>
symmetrical to those at 0 degree to '60 degree. As shown in Figure 6, the frequency<br>
responses for all incident degrees, ranging from 0 degree to 60 degree arc almost<br>
overlapping with each other, indicating very uniform angular responses. This implies that<br>
the audio tonality remains the same wherever a talker walks in a room around the<br>
though the frequency responses are not flat, they can be flattened by a single frequency<br>
equalizer.<br>
[0025] Figure 7 shows more detail polar responses for various frequencies, ranging from 250 Hz<br>
to 3500 Hz. The plots (702 - 714) indicate the wide-angle sound pickup while the<br>
average front-back rejection remains very good, 20 dB at 1000 Hz and 15 dB at 3500 Hz.<br>
[0026] In the above embodiment, three cardioid microphone elements are included in one<br>
microphone. More or less number of elements may be implemented based on the<br>
property of the microphone element and the need of a particular application. In<br>
particular, when the conference room or lecture hall is greater than the 600 square feet<br>
coverage provided by a single microphone as discussed ahove, more microphones can.be<br>
installed in cooperation with each other under the control of a mic-steering controller. In<br>
one embodiment, three microphones are installed in a lecture hall. The total coverage is<br>
1800 square feet, which is a huge conference room that can seat about 150 people<br>
comfortably. Depending on the need, other arrangements are possible.<br>
{0027] Figures 8a and 8b show a typical conference room arrangement according to one<br>
embodiment of'the current invention using two microphones as discussed above. Figure<br>
8a is a top view and Figure 8b is a side view. The conference room is equipped with a<br>
video monitor 8101 and a video camera 8105 at one end of the conference room. The<br>
conference table 8119 is placed in the middle of the conference room. The microphones<br>
8110 and 8120 are overhead microphones. They are maintained in place above the<br>
conference participants. In this conference room, there are no other objects in between<br>
the overhead microphones and the conference participants. The microphone elements in<br>
an overhead microphone can receive sound waves from the conference participants<br>
directly. In one embodiment, the overhead microphones arc hung from the ceiling and<br>
above all conference participants. This way, there are no microphones and associated<br>
wires or other, components lying around the conference table interfering with the<br>
conference participants. More details about the assembly are discussed below in<br>
reference to Figures 10a-g. In this embodiment, each microphone 8110 or 8120 has three<br>
cardioid microphone elements 8111-8116. Conference participants, such as 8121, 8122<br>
by any one of the six microphone elements 8111-8116. Since the microphones arc place<br>
overhead, i.e. above all participants, sometimes near the ceiling, only direct speech<br>
sounds 8132 and 8134 are accepted by the microphones 8110 and 8120. The first stage<br>
reflected sounds, or room reverberation 8142 or 8144 are rejected by the microphones<br>
8110 and 8120. loudspeakers 8102 and 8104 arc installed to reproduce speech sound<br>
from far end sites of the conference. Echoes or feedbacks between the microphones and<br>
loudspeakers are eliminated by audio signal processing. There are many available<br>
methods for audio echo cancellation and feedback elimination. Any one of them may be<br>
used in this embodiment of the current invention.<br>
[0028] The implementation of overhead microphone arrays removes microphones from a<br>
conference table in a conference setting. Comparing to typical table-top microphones or<br>
speakerphones having embedded microphones, an overhead microphone array is "out of<br>
sight" from conference participants and does not interfere with the conference<br>
participants. At the same time, the overhead microphone as acoustically more "in sight"<br>
than any desk top microphones. When there are more than a few people in a conference,<br>
most people behind the first row do not have a direct line-of-sight to the table top<br>
microphone. Speech from these pcopic behind the first row is not very well received by<br>
the microphone due to the interference of people or objects in between. On the other<br>
hand, an overhead microphone is implemented above all conference participants,<br>
regardless how many they are. As long as the microphone is maintained overhead, its<br>
height is only a design choice, mostly ucsthetic choice. It could be on the ceiling, below<br>
but close to the ceiling, or only .slightly above people when they arc seated. Typically, the<br>
top half of a room, i.e. the space from the middle between the floor and the ceiling of a<br>
room to the ceiling of the room, is considered overhead space of the room. In most<br>
conference rooms, there is nothing in between the overhead microphone and a talker<br>
below in the room. The overhead microphone can always receive direct sound waves<br>
from any talkers in the room so that the microphone signal generated has the best acoustic<br>
quality.<br>
used for two separate audio channels. These two independent audio channels may form a<br>
stereo audio field. They can be transmitted independently to other sites of the conference.<br>
Similarly, if other sites arc also equipped with multiple audio channels and arc received<br>
by the local site, they can be formed into space differentiating stereo audio field. The<br>
space differentiating stereo audio field can be combined with the video display to<br>
simulate more life-like conference experience.<br>
(0030) Figure 9 illustrates a block diagram for signal processing for the emlxodiment shown in<br>
Figure 8a and 8b. The microphone elements 8111 -8116 are grouped in two microphones:<br>
elements 8112, 8114 and 8116 are for microphone 8110 as shown in Figure 8a; elements<br>
8111, 8113 and 8115 arc for microphone 8120. The signals from microphone elements<br>
are [ed into two steering controllers 942 and 941 respectively. The steering controller<br>
942 and 941 operates independently to form two separate audio channels. The operation<br>
of the steering controller 941 or 942 is the same, i.e. to detect, select and mix the best<br>
signal quality from the elements in the connected microphone. When one element is<br>
identified as the best source of signal, then only that signal is passed as signal 954 to<br>
downstream processing components. The signals from other elements may be discarded.<br>
If more than one clement is selected, then a mixing takes place in the steering controller<br>
to form signal 954. A similar process takes place to form signal 953 out of steering<br>
controller 941. Audio signal 954 or 953 is typically fed into a signal processor, such as<br>
an acoustic echo canceller 962 or 961 to remove the echoing signal due to the<br>
loudspeakers in the conference room. The substantially echo free signals 952 and 951 are<br>
then fed into a processor 971 for further processing if necessary. For example, the nudio<br>
signals may be frequency equalized to correct the non-flat frequency responses as shown<br>
in Figures 5-7; the noise in the audio signals may be reduced to improve intelligibility or<br>
white noise be added to compensate echo cancellation or noise reduction; signal strength<br>
may also be adjusted to compensate the different gains in the microphone. The audio<br>
signals may also be encoded for transmission in a network system, such as Internet,<br>
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) or Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS).<br>
The conditioned signal 957 is transmitted to other sites in the conference. For clarity, the<br>
steering, echo cancellation and other processing are shown to be performed by different<br>
processor. They may also be divided and performed by two or more processors with a<br>
different distribution of tasks.<br>
[0031] Figures 10a-g illustrate more details of the overhead microphones used in the conference<br>
systems shown in Figure 8. Figure 10a is a side view and Figure 10b is a top view. In<br>
this embodiment shown in Figure 10a, there is a supporting structure 8223 including a<br>
pole 8222 and others. The supporting structure 8223 secures the microphone 8110 to the<br>
ceiling of a conference room. The lower end of the pole 8222 holds the body of the<br>
microphone 8110. The microphone 8110 has three microphone elements 8112, 8116 and<br>
8114. Each element is a cardioid microphone element Each has a 120-degree angular<br>
responsive range. They are arranged 120-degree apart to each other. This way, the<br>
microphone 8110 can accept sound from 360-dcgree around. If the microphone elements<br>
used in a microphone have different angular responsive range, then the number of<br>
microphone elements used would be different. Each element in the microphone is<br>
coupled to a mic-stccring controller (not shown). The connection between microphone<br>
elements and the controller can be of many different ways. It is possible that the<br>
processor is located at a different location and is connected to the elements via a simple<br>
wired connection. The wires from the microphone elements go through the center ofthc<br>
supporting pole 8222, through the space above the ceiling to a controller located in<br>
another part of the conference room.<br>
[0032] It is more desirable in some situations to put a processor onboard the microphone so that<br>
only processed microphone signals are sent to an audio system. Figure 10c shows a<br>
processor 8225 within the microphone 8110. This way, less amount of information needs<br>
to be communicated between the microphone elements and the controller. The processor<br>
may also perform other signal processing tasks, especially the tasks related only to the<br>
microphone itself, such as automatic gain control, frequency response equalization and<br>
noise reduction. Since the microphone elements and an on-board signal processor are<br>
low power consumption components, they may be powered by small batteries for<br>
extended period of time. With an additional radio transceiver, which may also be a low<br>
power consumption component, the microphone can be made into a wireless microphone,<br>
flexible and can be added or removed from any location easily. The transceiver in the<br>
microphone can transmitted its signals to an audio system which is capable of<br>
communicating with wireless microphones.<br>
(0033] In another embodiment, the microphone 8110 may also include a back shield 8220 that is<br>
located immediately above the microphone elements. This way, any sound waves from<br>
above back shield 8220 are blocked by back shield 8220. The noise from above, such as<br>
noises due to air conditioner vents, florescent lighting etc., is blocked from reaching the<br>
microphone elements. Since most background noise in a conference room is the noise<br>
from sources overhead, this arrangement of microphone elements with a back shield may<br>
reduce the need of noise reduction processing. Another, benefit of the back shield 8220 is<br>
that it can help boost the microphone sensitivity gain if a talker is right underneath the<br>
microphone 8110. The sound pressure is doubled due to the boundary effect of the back<br>
shield. This effect is used to the advantage because some sound energy is lost if a talker<br>
is seated right underneath the microphone 8110 due to the diffraction of the talker's head,<br>
and due to the cardioid directivity. The doubled sound pressure helps compensate the<br>
energy loss and equalize the microphone element response. Due to the reduced acoustic<br>
noise and increased acoustic signal, the signal processing requirement, especially the<br>
noise reduction requirement, is reduced.<br>
[0034] The size of the back shield can vary. To provide maximum benefit of shielding, it is<br>
desirable to make the back shield as large as possible, much larger compared to each<br>
microphone element. When the microphone elements are arranged in a circle, the radius<br>
of the back shield 8220 is typically at least twice as large as the radius of that circle 8121<br>
as shown in Figure 10b. The back shield may be made of any sound reflecting or sound<br>
absorptive materials. In one embodiment, a clear round plastic plate having a diameter of<br>
27 inches is used as a shield. The diameter of a typical shield is about 12 inches to 30<br>
inches.<br>
(0035| The back shield may also be installed on each individual microphone element, rather than<br>
one shield for all elements. One example is shown in Figure 10d and 10e. A back shield<br>
for each individual microphone element can be smaller. For example the individual<br>
smaller than shiold 8220. An individual shield may also be better oriented to provide<br>
better blocking of unwanted noise.<br>
[0036] Kach microphone element may be placed individually, or they may be enclosed together<br>
in the same housing as shown in Figure 10f and 10g. The bottom of the housing 8224 is<br>
sound permeable (as indicated by a broken line) to allow sound waves from below, e.g.<br>
speech from conference participants, to reach the microphone elements. The top (and the<br>
sides of the housing, if any) is solid (as indicated by a solid line) such that they are sound<br>
impermeable. Sound waves from directions other than below cannot reach the<br>
microphone elements inside the housing. The housing 8224 itself can provide some<br>
shielding and reflecting effects. To provide better shielding, a back shield 8220 is<br>
attached immediately above the microphone housing 8224.<br>
[0037] The overhead microphone assembly can be installed in a conference room and used in a<br>
conference system. It can also be used in many other applications, such as a video<br>
conference or just a meeting in that room. An audio system can amplify a participant's<br>
speech so every one in the room can hear the speech. Once a speech is captured by an<br>
overhead microphone assembly, the speech signal may be utilized in any ways, such as<br>
being amplified and reproduced at the same location, transmitted to a far end site,<br>
broadcasted through a radio or recorded in a permanent media for future reproduction..<br>
[0038] The overhead microphone assembly as shown in Figures 10a and 10b is secured in place<br>
by a hollow rod attached to the ceiling of the conference room. It can also be secured in<br>
place overhead by any other methods. For example, the microphone may be attached to .<br>
the bottom of a hanging light fixture or a decorative object It may also be attached to a<br>
supporting arm extended from a side wall. To reduce vibration noise from mechanical<br>
equipment in the building, vibration absorbing isolators may also be inserted between the<br>
microphone and its supporting structure or the ceiling. '<br>
j<br>
[0039] Ceiling mounted microphones have been used in many prior art applications. Most of<br>
them are used for security and surveillance purposes. In those applications, it is more<br>
concerned about the invisibility of the microphones, e.g. visible size of the microphone,<br>
type of omni-directional microphone element. Some prior art ceiling mounted<br>
microphones are used in conference room, but the sound quality is less than desirable. As<br>
discussed earlier, omni-directional microphone elements typically do not provide good<br>
quality audio signals in a conference room setting, especially when there are more than n<br>
couple of people participating in the conference.<br>
[0040) The current invention utilizes overhead microphones that have multiple microphone<br>
elements. The microphones according to the embodiments of the current invention can<br>
greatly improve the sound qualify, increase the area coverage, reduce acoustic noise level<br>
received by the microphone and reduce the microphone interference with conference<br>
participants. It greatly improves the liveliness of a teleconference.<br>
[0041] Although the examples discussed above are using the overhead microphones in<br>
conference rooms, overhead microphones may be used in many other locations where<br>
high quality microphones are desired. Such locations include, but not limited to, class<br>
rooms, auditoriums and performing art theaters etc.<br>
[0042] While illustrative embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it<br>
will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
