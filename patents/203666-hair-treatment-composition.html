&amp;<br>
2.	Applicant	-        (a) Hindustan Lever Limited<br>
(b)	of Hindustan Lever House,  165/166, Backbay<br>
Reclamation, Mumbai-400 020, Maharashtra, India.<br>
(c)	an Indian Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
199/MUMNP/2004<br><br><br>
WO (13/032929)<br><br>
PCT/EP02/10273<br><br>
This invention relates to cosmetic and personal care 5  compositions containing one or more polymers, to a method of treating hair with the polymers and to the use of the polymers for the cosmetic treatment of hair.<br>
The desire to have the hair retain a particular shape or<br>
10  style is widely held.  The most common approach for accomplishing styling of hair is the application of a composition to dampened hair, after shampooing and/or conditioning, or  to dry, styled hair.  These compositions provide temporary styling benefits and can readily be<br>
15  removed by water or shampooing.  To date, the materials employed in hair care compositions to provide styling benefits have generally been natural or synthetic resins and have been applied in the form of, for example, sprays, mousses, gels and lotions,<br>
20<br>
Recently, it has become desirable to have a high level of style retention, or strong hold, delivered from a hair spray composition.  In a typical hair spray, hold is achieved by the use of commercially available styling polymers, such as<br>
25  AMPHOMER (TM), supplied by National Starch Chemical Company, LUVIMER(TM) , supplied by BASF, GANTREZ (TM) , supplied by ISP Chemicals and also silicone graft copolymers, supplied by Mitsubishi Chemicals.<br>
3 0  Typically, the styling polymers have a carbon backbone comprising various hydrophilic and hydrophobic vinylic<br><br>
WO 03/032929<br><br>
PCT/EP02/10273<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
monomers.  These polymers csn be non-ionic or they can carry a charge, usually a negative charge.  The hydrophilic monomer is employed to render the polymer water-soluble and the hydrophobic monomer is generally selected to enhance 5  humidity resistance of the styling resins.<br>
There remains a need for further cosmetic and personal care compositions that provide acceptable hair styling benefits without accompanying sensory negatives.<br>
10<br>
The design and construction of the so called self-assembling supramolecular polymers, which can be defined as arrays of small molecules held together by secondary forces, has been described, for example, in J. M. Lehn, Angew.   Chem.,   Int.<br>
15 Ed.   Eng.,   1990, 29, 1304, C. M. Paleos and D. Tsiourvas, Angew.   Chem.,   Int.   Ed.   Eng.,   1995, 34, 1696 and N. Zimmerman, J. S. Moore, and S. C. Zimmerman, Chem.   Ind., 1998, 604.  One approach is the exploitation of specific hydrogen bonding molecules. Most systems are based on AA (or<br>
2	0  A2) type monomers or components (hydrogen bonding acceptors)<br>
plus BB (or B2) type monomers (hydrogen bonding donors) or AA + BB type (or A2 + B2) complimentary pairs.  Several examples of components or building blocks that could be used in this way to produce such architectures have been described. 25<br>
Sijbesma et a.1   (Science, 1997, 278, pp 1601-1604) teaches a reversible self-assembling polymer system in chloroform as solvent.  The system comprises two linked 2-ureido-4-pyrimidone units.  The 2-ureido-4-pyrimidone units can<br>
3	0  dirnerise via a self-complementary array of four co-operative<br>
hydrogen bonds.  Sijbesma et al  suggests that polymer<br><br>
WO 03/032929<br><br>
PCT/EP02/10273<br><br>
-   3    -<br>
networks with thermodynamically controlled architectures can be formed for use in coatings and hot melts.<br>
Hirschberg et al (Nature, 2000, 407, pp 167-170)describes 5  bifunctionalised ureidotriazone units, optionally connected by a spacer, carrying solublising chains at the periphery. Through dimerisation via  self-complementary quadruple hydrogen bonding and solvophobic interactions, the ur^idotrio.rcnc units connected by a spacer assemble into 10  supramolecular random coil polymers in chloroform and helical columns in dodecane as solvent.<br>
Clearly, neither Sijbesma et al  nor Hirschberg et al contemplates the use of hydrogen bonding polymers in 15  cosmetic compositions for personal use.<br>
WO 97/36572 discloses deodorant compositions which are thickened with siloxane-urea copolymers. Organopolysiloxanes which generate intramolecular or 20  intermolecular cross-linking are disclosed as hair setting agents in EP 0 640 643.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a hair treatment composition comprising: at least one polymer<br>
25  comprising at least two hydrogen-bonding moieties, which may be the same or different, covalently bonded to each other by at least one polymeric, oligomeric or monomeric linker, each moiety having at least 3 groups capable of forming a hydrogen bond with the same moiety or a different moiety;<br>
30  and from 0.1 to 50 % by weight of the total composition of a<br><br>
WO 03/03292973	PCT/EP02/102 <br>
-   4   -<br>
hair conditioning agent and/or a cosmetically acceptable surfactant.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides the use of a 5  polymer of the composition of the first aspect of the invention in a cosmetic or personal care composition.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating hair comprising (Applying to the hair at least one 10  polymer of the composition of the first aspect of the invention.<br>
In yet another aspect, the invention provides the use of a polymer of the composition of the first aspect of the 15  invention in the cosmetic treatment of hair.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to a compound having the following structure:<br><br>
20  Where X is oxygen or an amide (NH) group and R is either a covalent linking unit, linking the hydrogen-bonding moiety to a polymeric, oligomeric or monomeric linker, or a side group selected from H, Ci-C24 alkyl, C2.24 alkenyl, C2.24 alkynyl, aryl, aralkyl or heteroaryl groups optionally<br><br><br><br>
WO 03/032929	PCT/KP02/102 <br><br>
-   5   -<br>
substituted, or polyoxyethylene or polyoxypropylene or a random or block copolymer thereof.<br>
A method of preparing the compound above is also described. 5  The method comprises selecting a polymer having at least two amino or hydroxy groups or mixtures thereof and reacting the polymer with trimellitic anhydride.<br>
The personal care compos i 11"^ according to the present 10  invention include at least one polymer comprising at least two hydrogen-bonding moieties, which may be the same or different, covalently bonded to each other by at least one polymeric, oligomeric or monomeric linker, each moiety having at least 3 groups capable of forming a hydrogen bond 15  with the same or different moieties.<br>
Cosmetic and personal care compositions of the invention, particularly hair styling compositions, comprise at least one polymer which is capable of hydrogen bonding either 20  wholly or partially to itself and/or wholly or partially to other, for example polymeric, molecules including, for example, natural or synthetic hair fibres, in order to provide improved hold, for example.<br>
25  The at least one polymer preferably comprises at least two hydrogen-bonding moieties which may be the same or different, each hydrogen-bonding moiety having at least 3, preferably at least 4, groups capable of forming a hydrogen bond with the same or different moieties.<br>
30<br><br>
WC03/032929<br><br>
PCT/F:P02/10273<br><br>
-   6   -<br>
Each hydrogen-bonding moiety may have hydrogen-bonding donor and/or acceptor groups.  Preferably each hydrogen-bonding moiety has both donor and acceptor groups.  However, it is possible for hydrogen-bonding moieties to have only donor or acceptor groups.  Thus, for example, a polymer having hydrogen-bonding moieties with solely donor groups may be used together with a polymer having hydrogen-bonding moieties with solely acceptor groups.  Also, for instance, o^e polvu.^j. may comprise both hydrogen-bonding moieties which are wholly donor groups and hydrogen-bonding moieties which are wholly acceptor groups.<br>
Preferred polymers additionally have some monomeric units having only one hydrogen bonding group.  Such mono-functional monomers are present as chain stoppers and can be used to control the molecular weight of the polymer.  It is preferable if these mono-functional monomers are present at 10% or less of the total number of monomeric material comprising the polymer, more preferably less than 5%.<br>
The polymers according to the present invention are also, referred to as "hydrogen-bonding polymers" in order to distinguish them, where necessary, from other polymers which may be present in the compositions or methods of the invention.<br>
The hydrogen-bonding moiety comprising at least 3 hydrogen bonding groups preferably has the same structure as the corresponding moiety with which it forms hydrogen bonds when the moiety contains an even number of hydrogen bonding groups.  When the hydrogen-bonding moiety contains an odd<br><br>
WO 03/032929<br><br>
PCT/F.P02/10273<br><br>
-    7    -<br>
number of hydrogen bonding groups, the corresponding moiety with which it bonds must be complementary.  This is particularly preferred when the hydrogen-bonding polymer forms hydrogen bonds to other hydrogen-bonding polymers, 5  whether in an intramolecular or intermolecular fashion. However, the hydrogen-bonding polymer of the present invention may also be capable of forming hydrogen bonds to polymers such as, for example, keratin or other polymers or monomers that occur, for example, in natural or synthetic<br>
10  hair. In such cases.- the corresponding moiety with which the hydrogen-bonding moiety forms hydrogen bonds is suitably the same or different but preferably different. Preferably, the hydrogen-bonding polymer is capable of forming at least six, more preferably at least eight, hydrogen bonds to other<br>
15  polymers and monomers.<br>
The one or more polymers may bond to each other substantially only as a result of hydrogen-bonding interactions.  However, other non-covalent forces may also 20  contribute to the bonding such as, for example,<br>
electrostatic forces, van der Waal's forces and, when the hydrogen-bonding moieties comprise one or more aromatic rings, pi-pi stacking.<br>
25  The strength of each hydrogen bond preferably varies from 1-40 kcal/mol, depending on the nature and functionality of the donor and acceptors involved.<br>
Thus, suitable compositions may comprise a single hydrogen-3 0  bonding polymer according to the present invention or mixtures of, for example, 2  or more hydrogen bonding<br><br>
WO 03/032929<br><br>
PCT/EP02/10273<br><br>
-    8   -<br>
polymers according to the present invention.  Suitable mixtures, for use in the compositions of the present invention preferably comprise from 2 to 5 different polymers.  More preferably, suitable mixtures for use in 5  compositions according to the present invention comprise two different hydrogen-bonding polymers.<br>
Also preferred are mixtures of hydrogen-bonding polymers comprising two hydrogen-bonding aiuiiet^es with hydrogen-<br>
10  bonding polymers comprising more than two hydrogen-bonding moieties (eg, from 3 to 10 hydrogen-bonding moieties, such as 3 hydrogen-bonding moieties) .  Such mixtures can provide varying degrees of cross-linking interactions between the polymers and this can be used to tailor the properties of<br>
15  the composition.  The polymers in the mixture are preferably compatible and compatibility can be determined readily by those skilled in the art.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, however, only one 2 0  hydrogen-bonding polymer according to the present invention is present in the compositions.<br>
The at least one polymer according to the invention suitably comprises from 2 to 10 0 hydrogen-bonding moieties,<br>
25  preferably from 2 to 20, more preferably from 2 to 10<br>
hydrogen-bonding moieties.  For example, the at least one polymer may comprise 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 hydrogen-bonding moieties.  It is particularly preferred if the hydrogen-bonding polymer according to the invention<br>
30  comprises 2 hydrogen-bonding moieties.<br><br>
WO 03/032929<br><br>
PCT/EP02/10273<br><br>
-   9   -<br>
Polymers of the invention may be linear, branched or hyperbranched.  Hydrogen-bonding moieties may suitably be present at the two or more ends of the polymer chain and/or along the one or more backbones of the polymer. 5<br>
The hydrogen-bonding moieties according to the present invention suitably comprise less than ten, preferably less than five, repeat units of the same or different building bl'.'Cks, or monomers, in a linear sequence. It is<br>
10  particularly preferred if the hydrogen-bonding moieties comprise one building block. As used herein the term "building block" refers to any molecular unit that is not in itself a polymer. The building block is also suitably a functionalised molecule that comprises in addition to carbon<br>
15  and hydrogen at least three heteroatoms selected from the<br>
group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus and fluorine and mixtures thereof.<br>
The at least two hydrogen-bonding moieties are suitably the 20  same or different and comprise at least one building block which is the same or different. Preferably, however, the hydrogen-bonding polymer comprises hydrogen-bonding moieties that are all the same, in that they comprise the same building block.<br>
25<br>
Suitable hydrogen-bonding moieties for the purposes of the present invention are those having at least three, preferably at least four, groups which are capable of forming a hydrogen bond with the same or different moieties.<br>
3 0  It is particularly preferred that the hydrogen-bonding<br><br>
WO 03/032929<br><br>
PCT/EP02/10273<br><br>
-   10   -<br>
moieties have four groups that are capable of forming a hydrogen bond with the same or different moieties.<br>
The groups in the hydrogen-bonding moieties which are 5  capable of forming a hydrogen bond with the same or different moieties may suitably be selected from, for example, &gt;C=0, -COO-, -COOH, -0-, -OH, -NH2, &gt;N-H, &gt;N-, -CONH-, -F, -C=N- groups and mixtures thereof.<br>
10  Preferably the groups are selected from &gt;C=0, -O-H, -NH2, &gt;NH, -CONH-, -C=N- and mixtures thereof.<br>
Particularly suitable examples of hydrogen-bonding moieties include heterocycles and derivatives thereof, such as, for<br>
15  example, derivatives of pyrimidone and triazine, comprising at least three groups that are capable of forming a hydrogen bond to the same or different moieties.  It is sometimes possible in the case of, for example, heterocyclic compounds for two or more structurally distinct compounds to exist in<br>
20  rapid equilibrium ie, for tautomers to be present, usually through the. shift, of a proton..  The amount of each tautomer present will be determined, amongst other factors, by relative stability.  All, some or none of the tautomeric forms of a particular heterocycle may be suitable candidates<br>
25  for hydrogen-bonding moieties according to the present invention.  However, the tautomers of a heterocycle are considered to fall within the scope of the present invention only when they are capable of satisfying the requirement of having at least three groups capable of forming a hydrogen<br>
30  bond with the same or different moieties.<br><br>
WO 03/032929<br><br>
PCT/EP02/10273<br><br>
-   11   -<br>
Other suitable hydrogen-bonding moieties include short peptides comprising one, two or three peptide bonds.  For example, the hydrogen-bonding moieties may have the formula -(Al)(A2)(A3)(A4)-Q, wherein Al, A2, A3 and A4 are the same 5  or different amino acid residues and Q is OH, NH2 or a derivative thereof (eg, derivatised by alkylation or acylation of either 0 or N).  Amino acid residues may be derived from natural amino acids (eg, arginine) or synthetic amino acids.<br>
10<br>
Hydrogen bonds are relatively weak, non-covalent interactions usually formed between an electronegative atom, such as, for example, oxygen, where the oxygen atom may either be cpvalently bound to another usually less<br>
15  electronegative atom, such as, for example, carbon, by a<br>
single or a double covalent bond, or a nitrogen atom either covalently bound to another usually less electronegative atom by a single or a double covalent bond, or a fluorine atom, covalently bound to another atom, and an electron<br>
20  deficient, or electropositive, hydrogen atom.<br>
The hydrogen atom is typically electron deficient due to the fact that it is covalently bonded to a more electronegative atom such as for example, oxygen or nitrogen.  The term 25  "hydrogen bond", as used herein, is interchangeable with the terms "hydrogen bridge" and "cross-linked hydrogen bond".<br>
The terms electronegative and electropositive as used herein will be readily understood by the person skilled in ths art 3 0  to mean the tendency of an atom to attract the pair of electrons in a covalent bond so as to lead to an<br><br>
WO 03/032929<br><br>
PCT/KP02/10273<br><br>
-   12   -<br>
unsymmetrical distribution of electrons and hence the formation of a dipole moment.<br>
Electronegativity (see pages 14 to 16) and hydrogen bonding 5  (see pages 75 to 79) are discussed more fully in, for<br>
example, Advanced Organic Chemistry by J. March, 4t:h Edition, published by J. Wiley &amp; Sons, 1992.<br>
It is well known in the art that although hydrogen bonds in 10  themselves may be relatively weak, at least compared to covalent and ionic bonds, when a significant number of hydrogen bonds are capable of being formed, for example, between at least two molecules, the overall interaction between the at least two molecules may be relatively strong. 15<br>
The hydrogen-bonding moieties according to the present invention have at least three groups that are capable of forming a hydrogen bond with the same or different moieties. The moieties may be those in the same polymer molecule or,<br>
2	0  alternatively, with the same or different moieties in a<br>
different polymer molecule, according to the, present invention ie, the hydrogen bonds formed between the polymers of the present invention may be intramolecular but preferably they are intermolecular. 25<br>
The hydrogen-bonding moieties, as defined herein, include any optional linker groups connecting the hydrogen-bonding moieties to the polymeric, oligomeric or monomeric linker.<br>
3	0  The polymer according to the present invention satisfies two<br>
requirements, ie, the combination of the ability to form<br><br>
WO 03/032929<br><br>
PCT/EP02/10273<br><br>
-   13   -<br>
intermolecular hydrogen bonds and having at least two hydrogen-bonding moieties capable of hydrogen bonding to each other, to form so-called "supramolecular arrays".<br>
5  Supramolecular arrays are non-covalently bonded assemblies of molecules, typically with two or three-dimensional ordering, which are usually formed reversibly under thermodynamic control.  The arrays can be oligomeric or polymeric, depending on, for example, factors such as the<br>
10  concentration of the "monomer" and the shape of the<br>
"monomer" .  The term monomer may in this general context refer to a polymeric or monomeric species but in the context of the present invention will be restricted to the at least one hydrogen bonding polymer.<br>
15<br>
Thus, the at least one hydrogen bonding polymer according to the present invention may suitably be present in cosmetic or personal care compositions according to the present invention or on hair treated with the polymers or<br>
20  compositions of the invention as at least one, preferably more than one, distinct supramolecular array.  Where more than one supramolecular array is present, the arrays may have the same or varying size ie, the number of "monomeric" hydrogen bonding polymers may be the same or different.  As<br>
25  will be appreciated by the person skilled in the art, the size of the supramolecular array or arrays will depend on the particular physical conditions such as concentration and temperature.<br>
30  Alternatively, the hydrogen-bonding polymer according to the present invention may be present in the form of both a<br><br>
WO 03/032929<br><br>
PCT/EI&gt;02/H)273<br><br>
-   14    -<br>
supramolecular array or arrays (which includes arrays of two or more polymers) and the "monomeric" polymer form or may exist wholly in the "monomeric" polymer form.<br>
5  The hydrogen-bonding moieties comprising the polymer of the present invention may also be capable of forming hydrogen bonds both to and between naturally occurring polymers such as, for example, keratin as well as other polymers, such as for example, man-made polymers, for example nylon and 10  terylene.  The hydrogen bonds may be formed either to or between hydrogen-bonding moieties present either wholly or partially as part of a supramolecular array or may only form part of the "monomeric" hydrogen-bonding polymer.<br>
15  It is desirable that the at least one polymer according to the present invention is substantially linear.  It is also preferable that the hydrogen-bonding moiety has an essentially flat structure.  In a particularly preferred embodiment, the conformation of the hydrogen-bonding moiety<br>
20  is restricted by the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond.<br>
Suitably the hydrogen-bonding moiety comprises a structural element, or building block, having the general formula (I) , 25  (II) or (III)<br><br>

wherein R1  is H,   C1-C24 alkyl,   C2-24 alkenyl,   C2-24  alkynyl aryl,   aralkyl or heteroaryl,   optionally substituted, 5      preferably H,   and R2  and R3 may be either a  covalent  linking unit,   linking the hydrogen-bonding moiety to a polymeric, oligomeric or monomeric  linker,   or a side group  selected from H,   C1.-C24  alkyl,   C2-24  alkenyl,   C2.24 alkynyl,   aryl, aralkyl  or heteroaryl groups optionally substituted,   or<br>

Also suitable for use as a preferred hydrogen bonding moiety is trimellitic acid (TMA) (benzene-1,2,4-tricarboxilic acid),and derivatives thereof.  The general structure of trimellitic acid is given below:<br>

DMA Protocol 5<br>
A TA Instruments Dynamic Mechanical Analyser (DMA) 2980 was used to measure physical properties of hair arrays with the instrument operating in a 3 point bending mode.  The wet hair array wa» plctce-d on the 5 ram bexiding clamp and the DMA<br>
10  chamber was programmed to heat from ambient to 10 0°C at 3°C/minute and cool to 10°C at the same rate.  An off-set force or static force of 0.07 N was applied to the hair array and the applied dynamic force was varied during the temperature cycle to maintain a fixed oscillation amplitude<br>
15  of 20 fim  at an oscillation frequency of 1Hz.  The auto-tension level was set to 150% to guarantee that the static force would increase in line with the dynamic force and therefore keep the measurements stable over a wide range of applied forces.  A number of physical properties of the<br>
2 0  array were measured throughout the heating and cooling<br>

intervals along the array.  When the adhesive was set, the<br><br>

hair switch was cut-using a scalpel at the adhesive joints to give eight 2 cm bundles per switch.  The tip-ends of the fibres were not used for DMA measurements.<br>
5<br>
Treatment<br>
The hair arrays were weighed before application of 2 drops of polymer scluficn (typically 1-4 v/eight %) and the 10  treatment was massaged into the array.  The weight of the wet switch was then recorded and the ratio of weights of treatment to dry array noted (typically 0.3-<br>
0.4).  The storage modulus data was normalised to give a 15  weight ratio of 0.35 for all samples.<br><br>

Gafquat 755N is Polyquaternium-11 from ISP<br>
For Polymers A,B and C and Polymer A/Gafquat 755N blend, the 10  chamber was raised and cooling took place under ambient<br>
conditions (21 °C, 40% RH) to confirm that the high levels of storage modulus were maintained in the presence of humidity. For the remaining experiments, the chamber maintained an atmosphere of dried air throughout the experiment. 15<br>
The results show that the polymers of the invention provide stiffening and therefore styling benefits when applied to<br><br>
