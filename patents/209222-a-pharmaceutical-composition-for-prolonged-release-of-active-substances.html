ion-strength independent sustained release pharmaceutical formulation<br>
the present invention is related to a pharmaceutical formulation with a substantially sustained release behavior which is independent of the ion-strength of the dissolution medium, e.g. the gastrointestinal fluid. The sustained release is achieved over a time period up to 16 hours. The dosage form combines one or more active substances with a mixture of hydrophilic polymer carriers resulting in a gel forming matrix formulation.<br>
Hydrophilic gel forming matrix formulations are well know dosage forms to control the dissolution behavior of active substances. The mechanism by which the active substance is released, starts with the hydration of the dosage form surface to form a gel structure. Simultaneously the active substance at the formulation surface dissolves in the dissolution medium. In the stationary phase, the dissolution medium continuously penetrates the gel structure and the gel expands. The active substance dissolves in the dissolution medium and is transported to the outer layer of the gel. Meanwhile, erosion of the outer layers of the gel occurs. Finally the release levels off, caused by the decreased concentration gradient of the active substance in the formulation and the penetrated dissolution medium. This mechanism is described in the prior art, e.g. Manford Robinson, The Theory and Practice of Industrial Pharmacy. 2nd edition. Chapter 14: "Sustained Action Dosage Fonns".<br>
Hydrophilic polymers used in the above described formulations are mostly polysaccharide carriers such as the cellulose derivates hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC) or combinations of these cellulose derivatives.<br>
Formulations of these type are described in numerous patents and patent applications, e.g. in US 4,871,548 and EP-A-0923934.<br>
US 4,871,548 discloses a controlled release dosage form comprising an active compound and a mixture of at least a low viscosity cellulose ether and a high viscosity cellulose ether. EP-A-0923934 discloses a modified release matrix formulation of cefaclor and cephalexin comprising 5-35% of a mixture of hydrophilic polymers of different grades, wherein the hydrophilic polymers comprise about 0.1% to about 20% by weight of medium viscosity hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and about 0.1% to about 20% of low viscosity hydroxypropylcellulose<br><br>
Although the above mentioned formulations are described as sustained release formulations in general, this sustained release only appears when the concentration of salts, the ion-strength, in the dissolution medium is low. The release rate of the active substance from the above mentioned formulation may be substantially dependent on the ion-strength. A high ion-strength may even lead to so-called dose-dumping. In this case the total amount of active substance is released in a very short time, which may lead to undesired, and even dangerous high blood levels of the active substance. A high ion-strength often occurs direct after taking a meal. As. patients often take their medication just after a meal there is a high risk that ion-strength dependent formations give rise to unwanted fast release of active substance instead of the desired sustained release.<br>
WO 98/47491 describes a sustained release formulation wherein the control of the release of the active substance is based on a combination of two so called 'intelligenf polymers, having opposing wettability characteristics, one demonstrating a stronger tendency towards hydrophobicity and the other a stronger tendency towards hydrophilicity. In this formulation dose dumping can only be prevented by coating with an enteric coating.<br>
It is the objective of the present invention to provide a sustained release formulation which is substantially independent from the ion-strength of the dissolution medium, which is normally the gastrointestinal fluid even when the fonnulation is not coated. It is obvious for a person skilled in the art that the formulation should also meet the normal physical and phamriaceutical requirements in the art, such as good flowing properties of the powder during tabletting, a crushing strength of compressed tablets of at least 30 N, a friability below 1 % at a compression force between 10 and 40 KN, uniformity of content and sufficient stability. Further it is a requirement that the fonnulation can be prepared using normal formulation procedures and equipment, so that no large investments are necessary.<br>
This objective can be achieved, according to the present invention, by a pharmaceutical hydrophilic gel forming matrix formulation having a prolonged release of one or more active substances upon exposure to gastrointestinal fluids, characterized in that said release is substantially ion-strength independent.<br>
Prolonged release is defined as a (gradual) release of the active substance from the dosage form over a time period of 45 minutes or more. This period starts usually with<br><br>
the administration of the dosage fonn, or with the start of in-vitro dissolution test (the moment the dosage form is brought Into the dissolution medium).<br>
By the tenn substantially ion-strength independent is meant that the release rate profile of the active substance is not significantly changed (according to General Chapter 711: Physical tests and Determinations in USP 24 (Â± 10% of label claim)) when the ion strength (1) is varied between 0.05 and 0.45 mol/l. The ion strength (I) is defined as I = â1/2czin which c is the concentration of the different ions in the solution andz1their respective charge number (Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 71st edition, David R. Lide ed., page 2-18, Boston, CRC Press Inc.; 1990-1991).<br>
Although a coating is not essential to achieve the independency of the ion-strength, the formulation is optionally coated with a coating material in order to achieve another desired effect, such as masking of the taste or application of color. Suitable coating materials are known in the art and are for example HPMC, acrylics, ethylcellulose (see Graham Cole ed.. Pharmaceutical Coating Technology, London, Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd.; 1995)<br>
The hydrophilic gel forming matrix has the form of tablets or of a multi-particulate dosage form and preferably contains a mixture of at lease two hydrophilic high viscosity cellulose ethers. Although the presence of a hydrophobic cellulose ether such as ethylcellulose will normally have no detrimental effect on the release properties of the present formulation, preferably no substantial amount of said hydrophobic cellulose ether is present. With a substantial amount of hydrophobic cellulose ether is meant an amount greater than 20% of the total weight of the gel fonning polymers.<br>
Cellulose ethers are well known in the art and are available in phamiaceutical grades and with different average molecular weights leading to different viscosities of a solution of these cellulose ethers. For the purpose of this patent application, hydrophilic polymers may be characterized by their viscosities in a 2% w/w aqueous solution as low viscosity (less than about 1000 mPas), medium viscosity (about 1000 mPas to about 10,000 mPas) and high viscosity (greater than about 10,000 mPas)<br>
Hydrophilic hydroxypropyl methylcellulose polymers (HPMC's) which may be used in the present invention are available in different viscosity grades from Dow Chemical<br><br>
Co. under the brand name MethocelÂ® and from Shin Etsu under the brand name<br>
MetoloseÂ®.<br>
Examples  of low viscosity polymers are  Methocel  E5Â®,  Methodcel  E-15LVÂ®,<br>
Methocel E50LVÂ®, Methocel K100LVÂ® and Methocel F50LVÂ®, whose 2% aqueous<br>
solutions at 25o'C have viscosities of 5 mPas, 15 mPas, 50 mPas, 100 mPas and 50<br>
mPas, respectively.<br>
Examples of medium viscosity HPMC's are Methocel E4MÂ® and Methocel K4M,<br>
whose 2% aqueous solutions at 25*^0 have viscosities of 4000 mPas.<br>
Examples of high viscosity HPMC's are Methocel K15MÂ® and Methocel K100MÂ®<br>
whose 2% aqueous solutions at 25 C have viscosities of 15,000 mPas and 100,000<br>
mPas.<br>
Hydrophilic hydroxyethylcellulose polymers (HEC's) which may be used  in the<br>
present invention are available in different viscosity grades from AQUALON under<br>
the brand name NatrosolÂ® and from Amerchol Corporation under the brand name<br>
CellosizeÂ®.<br>
Examples of low viscosity polymers are Natrosol LÂ® en Natrosol JÂ®, whose 2%<br>
aqueous solutions at 25 Â°C have viscosities of 10 mPas and 20 mPas. respectively.<br>
Examples of medium viscosity polymers are Natrosol GÂ® and Natrosol KÂ® whose<br>
2% aqueous solutions at 25 Â°C have viscosities of 200 mPas and 1500 mPas,<br>
respectively.<br>
Examples of high viscosity polymers are Natrosol MÂ® and Natrosol HHÂ® whose 2 %<br>
aqueous solutions have viscosities at 25 Â°C of 4000 mPas and 90000 mPas,<br>
respectively.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the formulation comprises a<br>
mixture of a high or medium viscosity hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) and a<br>
high or medium viscosity hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), The ratio between the high or<br>
medium viscosity HPMC and the high or medium viscosity HEC is 1/0.85 to 1/1.2,<br>
preferably is 1/0.9 to 1/1.1, even more preferably is 1/0.95 to 1/1.05 and most<br>
preferred is 1/1. The formulation optionally may comprise a low viscosity HPMC. In<br>
that case the ratio between high or medium viscosity HPMC and low viscosity HPMC<br>
is in the range between 1/0.01 and 1/0.2 and preferably is between 1/0.01 and 1/0.1<br>
and even more preferably is between 1/0.02 and 1/0.05.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that formulations having the above mentioned<br>
composition can be used to prepare tablets that have a release rate that is<br><br>
independent of the ion-strength in the range that is normal in the gastro-intestinal fluid. Said normal range is between 0.17 and 0.35 mol/L.<br>
Apart from its independence from the ion-strength, the release controlling principle of the formulation is also substantially independent from the pH in the range between pH = 1.3 and pH = 7.4. This means that the release rate of active substance is not influenced by the pH in those cases where the active substance release is not limited by the solubility of the active substance substance, i.e. that the differences in release values (in %) at a given point in time are less than 20% of the label claim (see Chapter Dissolution Specifications (page 1080-81) in FIP Guidelines for Dissolution Testing of Solid Oral Products (Final Draft, 1995), Drug infonnation Journal 1996, Vol 30, 1071-84) within the whole pH range between 1.3 and 7.4.<br>
Because of its optimal properties as a sustained release fonnulation, the formulation according to the present invention can be used in the treatment of a large series of diseases in the case that sustained release properties are desirable. Examples of active substances that can be formulated into a sustained release formulation are active substances for the treatment of CNS disorders, including schizophrenia, episodic paroxysmal anxiety (EPA) disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), phobia and panic, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, Parkinson's disease, general anxiety disorder, autism, delirium, multiple sclerosis. Alzheimer disease/dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases, severe mental retardation and dyskinesias, such as Huntington's disease or Gilles dela Tourett's syndrome, anorexia, bulimia, stroke, addiction/dependency/craving, sleep disorder, epilepsy, migraine; attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); cardiovascular diseases including heart failure, angina pectoris, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, cardiac hypertrophy, hypotension, hypertension - e.g. essential hypertension, renal hypertension, or pulmonary hypertension, thrombosis, arteriosclerosis, cerebral vasospasm, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral ischemia, cerebral infarction, peripheral vascular disease, Raynaud's disease, kidney disease - e.g. renal failure; dyslipidemias; obesity; emesis; gastrointestinal disorders including irritable bowel syndrom (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), gastroesophagal reflux disease (GERD), motility disorders and conditions of delayed gastric emptying, such as postoperative or diabetic gastroparesis. and diabetes, ulcers - e.g. gastric ulcer; diarrhoea; other diseases including osteoporosis; gynecological disorders, inflammations; infections such as bacterial, fungal, protozoan and viral infections, particularly infections caused<br><br>

Example 1b Release properties of several formulations<br>
The release of the active substance from the hydrophilic matrix tablets is measured in the USP apparatus II using paddles rotating at 50 rpm in either an USP dissolution buffer medium pH 6.8 of 0.05 molar (M), 0.17 M and 0.34 M prepared from di sodium hydrogen phosphate.2aq and citric acid.laq (coded as R G and H respectively) or in a half-change dissolution medium prepared from 0.1 M aqueous hydro chloride solution in the first part of the test (90 minutes) followed by 0.2 M pH 6.8 by adjusting with tri sodium phosphate. 12 aq in the second part of the test. To increase the ionic strength of the aqueous solution during the test, sodium chloride is added to the solution. 1 liter dissolution medium of part two contains an amount of sodium chloride of respectively 0 gram (dissolution medium A). 10 gram (dissolution medium B), 15 gram (dissolution medium C), 30 gram (dissolution medium D1 and D2), and 50 gram (dissolution medium E1 and E2). In the dissolution media B, C, DI and El the sodium chloride is only added in the second part of the test. In the dissolution media D2 and E2 75% of the sodium chloride is added in the first part of the test and 25% in the second part. The release of the active substance is measured over 16 hours with sample intervals of one hour during the first two hours followed by sample intervals of two hours over the remaining test period. Samples may be analysed on-line with a HPLC system or by UV spectroscopy The release of the different active compounds from the fonnulation is given in the tables 4a - 4c.<br>
From the release data as given in the tables 4a-4c is can be concluded that the release of active substance from the formulation according to the present invention is substantially independent from the pH and the ion-strength, as differences in release values are less than 20%. Further it can be concluded that there is no substantial<br><br>
difference between the release profile when the ion-strength is increased at low pH (pH1.2) and at higher pH (pH 6.8)<br><br><br>
