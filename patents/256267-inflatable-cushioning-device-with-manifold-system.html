				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to a fluid cell for use in a mattress or support<br>
surface which allows for discrete support of a body and a support surface which allows for<br>
discrete support of a body. The present invention includes reforming elements that are<br>
resilient fluid cells having a spring bias.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Heretofore, inflatable cushioning devices for use with body supports, such as a<br>
mattress, sofa, seat, or the like, typically included a plurality of air cells or bladders that are<br>
inflated to support a person. The air cells provide support to the person, and can be inflated to<br>
a desired pressure level to provide the person with a predetermined level of comfort and<br>
support.<br>
In the medical field, cushioning devices including a plurality of air cells are often used<br>
to provide different levels of support under various portions of a patient's body. For example,<br>
a mattress may include separate air cells located in the upper, middle, and lower portions of<br>
the mattress. These air cells can be inflated to different pressures to support the upper,<br>
middle, and lower portions of the patient's body with different pressures.<br>
In hospitals which provide care to patients confined to a bed for extended periods of<br>
time, the patients often suffer from the effects of excess pressure transmitted to their bodies.<br>
As known in the medical field, continuous pressure applied to a patient's body can cause soft<br>
tissue damage. When the external pressure exerted on the patient's skin causes blood carrying<br>
capillaries to close, soft tissue degeneration may occur. This soft tissue damage may lead to<br>
the formation of pressure sores. For example, continuous pressure applied to a patient's heel<br>
can cause a pressure sore to develop on the heel. The multi-cell cushioning devices described<br>
above can be used to relieve the pressure applied to a specific portion of a patient's body. In<br>
the case of a patient's heel, for example, this may be accomplished by inflating the air cell<br>
under the patient's leg so that the heel is lifted from the mattress. Thus, the continuous heel<br>
pressure is relieved and the formation of a bed sore on the heel is prevented.<br>
Air cushion devices typically require an external pump to inflate the air cells in the<br>
device. Alternatively, the air cushion devices are pre-inflated in the manufacturing plant and<br>
are shipped to a field location for use. A problem may develop when the atmospheric<br>
2<br><br>
pressure at the inflation location is different from the atomospheric pressure at the field<br>
location where the device is used. For example, if the field location atmospheric pressure is<br>
lower than the atmospheric pressure at the inflation location, the air cells in the field will<br>
expand and become firmer.<br>
Hospitals rate pressure relief support systems as "treatment products" if they<br>
sufficiently reduce the pressure upon a patient's body, reduce tissue trauma, and facilitate the<br>
healing of skin ailments, such as burns, pressure sores, etc. Typical pressure relief support<br>
systems which qualify as "treatment products" are embodied in beds which contain motors<br>
and pumps to vary the shape and pressure within the mattress. Such beds are very expensive<br>
and require the operator to undergo extensive training to learn how to use and operate the<br>
system. Furthermore, the "treatment products" often require extensive maintenance due to the<br>
failure of the numerous moving mechanical parts. Also, these complicated pressure relief<br>
support systems cannot be used on typical box spring mattress supports, and require<br>
specialized bed frames. The complicated design of these beds makes their repair very<br>
difficult, and often requires the complete replacement of the entire system for proper<br>
servicing. A further difficulty is that during power outages, these mattresses lose pressure<br>
leaving a patient on a hard surface to develop pressure sores if action is not taken. Thus, a<br>
need exists to arrive at a body support which adequately addresses these disadvantages.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a cushioning device for a mattress, seat, sofa, or<br>
the like where support is obtained from a fluid such as atmospheric air. The cushioning<br>
device has few moving parts, is user controllable, requires minimal maintenance, and is easily<br>
repairable. The cushioning device of the present invention includes a support system<br>
apparatus, a sleeve apparatus, a jacket, a topper cushion, and an outer cover.<br>
The support system apparatus includes at least one support cell for providing lifting<br>
support for a body. Each support cell includes an envelope containing a fluid. Application of<br>
an external load on an outer surface of the envelope causes the envelope to deform into a<br>
compressed form. The envelope includes a reforming element that is capable of providing a<br>
reforming force to the interior surface of the envelope, to return the envelope to its original<br>
unloaded form. The reforming element is preferably made from a resilient foam material,<br>
however, other resilient means can be used.<br>
3<br><br>
An inlet port, outlet port, intake valve, and an exhaust valve are included in each<br>
support cell. The inlet and outlet ports are located directly on the fluid cell and are positioned<br>
adjacent or proximate one another. The exhaust valve in each support cell is connected to an<br>
exhaust control system via a lateral conduit which extends directly from the fluid cell. The<br>
intake valve in each support cell is connected to an intake control system. Each intake valve<br>
includes an intake check valve allowing fluid to flow into the support cell, while preventing<br>
fluid from flowing out of the support cell. Each exhaust valve includes an exhaust check<br>
valve allowing fluid to flow out of the support cell, while preventing fluid from flowing into<br>
the support cell. The intake control system is connected to a fluid supply reservoir. The<br>
exhaust control system is connected to a fluid exhaust reservoir. Preferably, the fluid included<br>
in the supply and exhaust reservoirs is air, however, any suitable fluid, e.g., water or nitrogen,<br>
can be used. The fluid supply and exhaust reservoirs may comprise the same reservoir, and<br>
may comprise an ambient source of fluid such as atmospheric air.<br>
In use, the weight of a body of a person, patient, or animal resting on the envelope<br>
deforms the envelope. For illustration purposes, a patient will be used as an example of a<br>
body resting on a the envelope. The pressure of the fluid within the envelope increases as the<br>
volume of the envelope decreases under deformation. As the pressure of the fluid increases,<br>
the fluid in the envelope flows out of the envelope through the exhaust valve and into the<br>
exhaust control system. Next, the fluid flows from the exhaust control system into the fluid<br>
exhaust reservoir. Furthermore, as the envelope deforms to conform to the irregular shape of<br>
the patient, the area of the envelope supporting the load increases. Equilibrium is achieved<br>
when the forces within the envelope, including the pressure of the fluid within the envelope<br>
multiplied by the area of the envelope supporting the load, plus the force provided by the<br>
reforming element equal the weight of the load.<br>
A controllable pressure relief valve is included in the exhaust control system so that a<br>
maximum pressure level of the fluid within the envelope can be set and maintained.<br>
Different selected maximum pressure levels of the fluid allow the support cell to<br>
accommodate different weights or allow different degrees of conformation between the patient<br>
and the envelope surface. Preferably, the maximum pressure level of the fluid is set to ensure<br>
that the interface pressure under the entire contact surface of the patient is below the pressure<br>
that may cause soft tissue damage such as pressure sores to occur.<br>
As the weight of the patient is removed from the support cell, the reforming element<br>
4<br><br>
xerts an outward force on the interior surface of the envelope. As the envelope expands, a<br>
partial vacuum is created in the interior space of the envelope, causing fluid to be drawn back<br>
into the interior space of the envelope. The fluid is drawn from the fluid supply reservoir into<br>
the intake control system, through the intake valve, and into the interior space of the envelope.<br>
The intake valve includes a one way intake check valve that permits fluid to re-enter the<br>
interior space of the envelope, while preventing fluid from exiting the interior space of the<br>
envelope.<br>
The support cells included in the present invention can use atmospheric pressure as the<br>
pressure source for inflation. Therefore, when the fluid supply and exhaust reservoirs<br>
comprise atmospheric air, non-powered inflation can be accomplished without the need for<br>
expensive blowers, pumps or microprocessors as required by previously available "treatment<br>
products". A plurality of support cells can be interconnected via a lateral conduit to the intake<br>
control system and via a lateral conduit to the exhaust control system to create a support<br>
system apparatus. Interconnecting the support cells allows a constant pressure to be<br>
maintained across the fluid cells. The support system apparatus can support a patient by<br>
providing self adjusting pressure management to the entire contact surface of the patient. The<br>
support system apparatus provides a low interface pressure under the entire surface of the<br>
patient being supported. For example, if the patient is lying on the support system apparatus,<br>
the support system apparatus ensures that the interface pressure under the entire contact<br>
surface of the patient is below the pressure that may cause soft tissue damage to occur.<br>
The support system apparatus also has the ability to self-adjust every time a patient<br>
moves, or is repositioned on the support system apparatus. When the pressure distribution<br>
applied to the support system apparatus changes, the support cells within the support system<br>
apparatus automatically inflate or deflate as necessary, to maintain a low interface pressure<br>
under the entire patient.<br>
Another embodiment of the current invention provides for separately controlled<br>
support zones within the support system apparatus. Each support zone comprises at least one<br>
support cell. Each support cell includes at least one intake valve and at least one exhaust<br>
valve. The intake valve for each support cell in each support zone is connected to a manifold<br>
system, including a conduit having a plurality of lateral conduits extending therefrom,<br>
included in the intake control system. The exhaust valves from each support cell in a single<br>
support zone are connected to a manifold system, including a conduit having a plurality of<br>
5<br><br>
lateral conduits extending therefrom, included in a single exhaust control system. Each<br>
support zone has a separate exhaust control system. The intake control system is connected to<br>
the fluid supply reservoir. The exhaust control system for each support zone is connected to<br>
the fluid exhaust reservoir. Generally the pressure level in each support zone is set at a<br>
different level. For example, if the support system apparatus comprises a mattress in a bed,<br>
the upper, middle, and lower zones of the support system apparatus can be set to provide a<br>
different level of pressure or firmness for the upper, middle, and lower portions of the<br>
patient's body.<br>
The sleeve apparatus includes a cell cover surrounding each support cell. For a<br>
plurality of support cells, each cell cover is attached to an adjacent cell cover. The cell cover<br>
allows the surface of the envelope of the support cell to slide freely along a first side of the<br>
cell cover, without transmitting this sliding movement to a second side of the cell cover. The<br>
second side of the cell cover can be the side on which a patient is lying. Therefore, movement<br>
of the support cell is not transmitted to the patient, thereby preventing factional or shear force<br>
abrasion damage to the skin of the patient. In the event that repair of a support cell becomes<br>
necessary, the sleeve apparatus allows each support cell to be easily removed and replaced.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides an additional alternating<br>
pressure system for providing alternating supply pressure to a plurality of zones. The<br>
alternating pressure system can be used in combination with the support system apparatus.<br>
Each zone includes at least one support cell. The alternating pressure system includes a<br>
pressurized fluid supply source including a pump, a pressurized fluid tank, etc. Additionally,<br>
the alternating pressure system includes a control system for sequentially supplying fluid<br>
pressure to the plurality of zones. The raising and lowering of the alternating zones under a<br>
patient provides beneficial movement of the skeleton and tissue in the patient. The movement<br>
helps stimulate circulation and lymph fluid movement in the patient. When the alternating<br>
pressure system is deactivated or fails, the support system apparatus continues to provide self<br>
adjusting pressure management to the patient's body.<br>
The jacket houses the support system apparatus, the intake and exhaust control<br>
systems, and portions of the alternating pressure system. The jacket can be made from any<br>
suitable stretchable material, and is preferably is formed from a stretchable fabric material.<br>
The topper cover provides further resilient torso support. The topper cover may be<br>
formed from a layered fiber filled material or other suitable material. The topper may include<br>
6<br><br>
a resilient heel support unit to reduce pressures on the sensitive heel region of a patient. The<br>
topper cover may rest above the jacket, and may be covered by the outer cover. Alternatively,<br>
the topper cover may rest above the support system apparatus.<br>
The outer cover provides a low friction and low shear surface further protecting the<br>
patient from frictional tissue damage. Additionally, the outer cover provides a waterproof and<br>
stain resistant surface. For medical uses the outer cover can be made from an anti-microbial<br>
type material.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides a support surface or mattress<br>
containing a plurality of support cells that are discrete fluid cells having reforming capability.<br>
The discrete fluid cells each have a spring bias. Application of an external load on an outer<br>
surface of a fluid cell causes the fluid cell to deform into a compressed form when the load<br>
has a force which is greater than the sum of the forces within the fluid cell, including the<br>
pressure of the fluid inside the fluid cell multiplied by the area of the fluid cell supporting the<br>
load, plus the reforming force of the fluid cell. Once the load is reduced, the reforming force<br>
of the fluid cell causes the fluid cells to reform to original unloaded form. Equilibrium is<br>
achieved when the forces within the envelope, including the pressure of the fluid within the<br>
envelope multiplied by the area of the envelope supporting the load, plus the force provided<br>
by the reforming element equal the weight of the load. The fluid cells exert variable force and<br>
expand and compress depending on the load encountered.<br>
The support system apparatus containing the spring biased fluid cells also includes a<br>
base housing, or casing, which receives the fluid cells and affixes the cells together to form a<br>
mattress construct. The fluid cells within the casing are connected to the intake control<br>
system and the exhaust control system, including a controllable pressure relief valve, to create<br>
a support system apparatus. Both fluid cell movement and the firmness and softness of the<br>
fluid cells are determined by the properties of the fluid cell and the pressure level at which the<br>
controllable pressure relief valve is set. For example, variables such as base material height,<br>
ILD (Incidence of Load Deflection), density of the fluid cell material, air pressure, fluid cell<br>
height, air flow control, air sound control, direction of air flow, and speed of air movement all<br>
affect the response of the fluid cell to a force. Air sound control is achieved using sound<br>
control battening which reduces the sound during intake and exhaust of the air cell.<br>
The cushioning device of the present invention allows a user in the field to adjustably<br>
set the maximum pressure level in each support cell. When surrounded by atmospheric air,<br>
7<br><br>
the support system apparatus is self-inflating, self-adjusting, and does not require expensive<br>
pumps and control systems as required by related "treatment product" art. Also, since there<br>
are fewer moving parts in the present invention, maintenance and repairs are simple and<br>
reasonable in cost compared to the complex related art.<br>
The cushioning device of the present invention can be used in combination with any<br>
support device where self adjusting dynamic pressure support of the person or patient is<br>
required. For example, these support devices can be mattresses, sofas, seats, etc.<br>
A first general aspect of the present invention provides a fluid cell for use in a support<br>
surface comprising:<br>
a spring bias in said fluid cell of said support surface to reform said fluid cell such that<br>
each said fluid cell collapses when loaded with a load having a force which is greater than the<br>
sum of the forces within the fluid cell, including the pressure of the fluid inside the fluid cell<br>
multiplied by the area of the fluid cell supporting the load, plus the reforming force of the<br>
fluid cell, and said fluid cell reforms when said load is reduced to a load having a force which<br>
is less than the sum of the forces within the fluid cell and the reforming force of the fluid cell,<br>
wherein said fluid cell is self inflating.<br>
A second general aspect of the present invention provides a support surface<br>
comprising:<br>
a plurality of self-inflating fluid cells, wherein each said self-inflating fluid cell has a<br>
spring bias to reform said self-inflating fluid cell and at least one port; and<br>
a casing adapted to receive said plurality of self-inflating fluid cells, wherein said<br>
casing affixes said self-inflating fluid cells together to form a mattress construct.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Although certain preferred embodiments of the present invention will be shown and<br>
described in detail, it should be understood that various changes and modifications may be<br>
made without departing from the scope of the appended claims. The scope of the present<br>
invention will in no way be limited to the number of constituting components, the materials<br>
thereof, the shapes thereof, the relative arrangement thereof, etc., and are disclosed simply as<br>
an example of the preferred embodiment. The features and advantages of the present<br>
invention are illustrated in detail in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference<br>
numerals refer to like elements throughout the drawings. Although the drawings are intended<br>
to illustrate the present invention, the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, there is illustrated a perspective view of a cushioning device 10 in<br>
accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The cushioning device 10<br>
can be used in combination with any support device where self-adjusting dynamic pressure<br>
support of a person or patient 56 (FIG. 14) is required. For example, the support device may<br>
include a mattress, sofa, seat, etc. The cushioning device 10 includes a support system<br>
apparatus 12 comprising at least one support cell 14, a sleeve apparatus 16 (FIG. 5), a jacket<br>
18 (FIG. 5), and a topper cushion 20.<br>
The support system apparatus 12 includes at least one support cell 14 for providing<br>
lifting support for a patient 56. An intake valve 40 and an exhaust valve 42 are included in<br>
each support cell 14. As illustrated in FIG. 1, the cushion device 10 also includes two end<br>
walls 24, 26, and two side walls 28, 30. The end walls 24, 26, and the side walls 28, 30 can<br>
be formed from a resilient material such as foam or rubber. The topper cushion 20 rests on<br>
top of the jacket 18 and provides further cushioning to a body. The topper cushion 20 can be<br>
composed of any resilient material, for example, foam, down feathers, an inflatable air<br>
cushion, etc.<br>
10<br><br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a partial cross-sectional view of the support cell 14A including an<br>
envelope 34A and a reforming element 32A. The envelope 34A contains a fluid 36. The<br>
application of an external load on the envelope 34A causes the envelope 34A to deform into a<br>
compressed form. The reforming element 32A provides a reforming force to the interior<br>
surface 38A of the envelope 34A. The reforming force causes the envelope 34A to return to<br>
its original form when the external load is removed from the envelope 34A. The reforming<br>
element 32A is preferably a resilient foam material, however, other resilient means can be<br>
used such as a coiled spring 500 (FIG. 17) or a bellows 520 (FIG. 18). The coiled spring 500<br>
is surrounded by a resilient material 502. The bellows 520 may be formed from a pliable<br>
resilient material such as plastic and filled with a fluid such as air. Similar to the fluid cell<br>
614 shown in FIG. 23, the reforming element may have a double, or twin, helical pattern 530<br>
on its outer construct.<br>
An example of a support system apparatus 12 for a mattress includes a plurality of<br>
support cells 14A, 14B, 14C, and 14D is illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 3. An example of interior<br>
cells, 14A, and 14D, and end cells, 14B and 14C, are depicted in FIGs. 1 and 3. Intake valves<br>
40A, 40B, 40C, 40D, and exhaust valves 42A, 42B, 42C and 42D are also illustrated in FIG.<br>
3. Each intake valve 40 includes an intake check valve 48 allowing fluid 36 to flow into the<br>
support cell 14, while preventing fluid 36 from flowing out of the support cell 14. Each<br>
exhaust valve 42 includes an exhaust check valve 50 allowing fluid 36 to flow out of the<br>
support cell 14, while preventing fluid 36 from flowing back into the support cell 14. Each<br>
exhaust valve 42 is connected to an exhaust conduit via T-intersection 60A, 60B, 60C, and<br>
60D in a manifold 60 included in an exhaust control system 46. Each intake valve 40 is<br>
preferably connected to an intake conduit via T-intersection 58A, 58B, 58C, and 58D in a<br>
manifold 58 included in an intake control system 44.<br>
The intake control system 44 is connected to a fluid supply reservoir 52. The exhaust<br>
control system 46 is connected to a fluid exhaust reservoir 54. Generally, the fluid 36<br>
included in the fluid supply reservoir 52 and the fluid exhaust reservoir 54 is air, however, any<br>
suitable fluid 36 (e.g. water or nitrogen) can be used. The fluid supply reservoir 52 and the<br>
fluid exhaust reservoir 54 may comprise the same reservoir, and may comprise an ambient<br>
source of fluid 36 such as atmospheric air.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 14, the weight of a body such as a patient 56 resting on the<br>
cushion device 10 deforms the envelope 34 in each support cell 14. The pressure of the fluid<br>
11<br><br>
36 within each envelope 34 increases as the volume of the envelope 34 decreases under<br>
deformation. As the pressure of the fluid 36 increases, the fluid 36 in each envelope 34 flows<br>
out of the envelope 34 through a corresponding exhaust valve 42 and into the exhaust control<br>
system 46 (FIGS. 1 and 3) such that the pressure of each fluid cell is independent of the<br>
pressure of each other fluid cell. Next, the fluid 36 flows from the exhaust control system 46<br>
into the fluid exhaust reservoir 54. Furthermore, as each envelope 34 deforms to conform to<br>
the irregular shape of the patient 56, the area of the envelope 34 supporting the load increases.<br>
Equilibrium is achieved when the forces within the envelope 34, including the pressure of the<br>
fluid 54 within the envelope 34 multiplied by the area of the envelope 34 supporting the load,<br>
plus the force provided by the reforming element 32, equal the weight of the load.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 3 a controllable pressure relief valve 62 is included in the<br>
exhaust control system 46 and is attached to an end 64 of the exhaust conduit 60. The outlet<br>
66 of the controllable pressure relief valve 62 is attached to the fluid exhaust reservoir 54.<br>
The controllable pressure relief valve 62 controls the maximum pressure level of the fluid 36<br>
in the exhaust conduit 60 and in each envelope 34 in each support cell 14. A rotatable knob<br>
68 or other adjusting mechanism on the controllable pressure relief valve 62 allows a user to<br>
adjust the regulated maximum pressure level. Different selected maximum allowable<br>
pressures in the support cells 14A, 14B, 14C, and 14D allow the support system apparatus 12<br>
to accommodate patients 56 of different weights. Also, the setting of different maximum<br>
allowable pressures in the support cells 14A, 14B, 14C, and 14D allows different degrees of<br>
conformation between the patient 56 and the surface of each envelope 34. The maximum<br>
pressure is preferably set to ensure that the interface pressure under the entire contact surface<br>
of the patient 56 is below the pressure that may cause tissue damage. The cushioning device<br>
10 of the present invention allows a user in the field to adjustably set the maximum pressure<br>
level in each support cell 14. The maximum pressure is preferably above about 6 inches of<br>
water but is optimally in the range of about 8 to 12 inches of water. Other ranges may also be<br>
used, depending on operational requirements, user preferences, etc.<br>
FIG. 13 illustrates the patient 56 resting on a conventional mattress 72. High pressure<br>
regions on the patient 56 are indicated by the force arrows PA, PB, PC, PD, and PE. FIG. 14<br>
illustrates the patient 56 resting on a cushion device 10 of the present invention. As shown,<br>
the cushion device 10 provides a low uniform interface pressure PX that supports the entire<br>
contact surface of the patient 56. This interface pressure is below the pressure that may cause<br>
12<br><br>
tissue damage, thereby preventing the formation of pressure sores and other injuries.<br>
As the weight of the patient 56 is removed from each support cell 14, the reforming<br>
element 32 (FIG. 2) in each envelope 34 exerts a reforming force on the interior surface 38 of<br>
each envelope 34. As each envelope 34 expands, a partial vacuum is created in the interior<br>
space 70 of each envelope 34. The vacuum draws the fluid 36 from the fluid supply reservoir<br>
52 into the intake control system 44. Next, the fluid 36 is drawn from the intake control<br>
system 44 through a corresponding intake valve 40 into the interior space 70 of each envelope<br>
34. When the fluid supply reservoir 52 and the fluid exhaust reservoir 54 comprise<br>
atmospheric air, inflation can be accomplished without the need for expensive blowers, pumps<br>
or microprocessors as required by previously available "treatment products". The support<br>
system apparatus 12 of the present invention also has the ability to self-adjust every time a<br>
patient 56 moves, or is repositioned on, the support system apparatus 12. When the pressure<br>
distribution applied to the support system apparatus 12 changes, the support cells 14 within<br>
the support system apparatus 12 automatically inflate or deflate to restore the low interface<br>
pressure PX under the entire patient (FIG. 14).<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 4 and provides for<br>
separately controlled support zones "A", "B" and "C" within a support system apparatus 80.<br>
Each support zone "A", "B" and "C" includes at least one support cell 14. Each support cell<br>
14 includes at least one intake valve 40 and at least one exhaust valve 42. As illustrated in<br>
FIG. 4, each intake valve 40A-40H is connected to the intake control system 44. The exhaust<br>
valves 42A and 42B in zone "C" are connected to an exhaust control system 82. The exhaust<br>
valves 42C, 42D, 42E and 42F in zone "B" are connected to an exhaust control system 84.<br>
The exhaust valves 42G and 42H in zone "A" are connected to an exhaust control system 86.<br>
Each intake valve 40A-40H allows fluid 36 to flow into each support cell 14A-14H,<br>
respectively, while preventing fluid 36 from flowing back out of each support cell 14A-14H,<br>
respectively. Each exhaust valve 42A-42H allows fluid 36 to flow out of each support cell<br>
14A-14H, respectively, while preventing fluid 36 from flowing back into each support cell<br>
14A-14H, respectively. The intake control system 44 is connected to the fluid supply<br>
reservoir 52. The exhaust control systems 82, 84, and 86 are connected to the fluid exhaust<br>
reservoir 54. Generally, the fluid 36 included in the fluid supply reservoir 52 and the fluid<br>
exhaust reservoir 54 is atmospheric air, however, other fluids 36 can be used.<br>
Each exhaust control system 82, 84, and 86 includes a pressure relief valve 88, 90, and<br>
13<br><br>
92, respectively, that maintains the pressure of the fluid 36 in zones "A", "B" and "C" below a<br>
selected level. A rotatable knob 68 or other adjusting system included in each pressure relief<br>
valve 88, 90, and 92 allows a user to set the maximum pressure level of the fluid 36 in each<br>
zone "A", "B" and "C".<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a cross-sectional view of the support system apparatus 80 and zones<br>
"A", "B" and "C" taken along line 5--5 of FIG. 4. When atmospheric air is supplied to the<br>
fluid supply reservoir 52, there is no need for blowers or pumps to supply the pressurized fluid<br>
36. Each support cell 14A-14H self-inflates when the weight of the patient 56 is removed as<br>
described above for the support system apparatus 12. Each exhaust control system 82, 84 and<br>
86 allows the maximum pressure level of the fluid 36 in each zone "A", "B" and "C" to be<br>
individually set. FIG. 6 illustrates an example of different pressure levels set in zones "A",<br>
"B" and "C". For example, if the support system apparatus 80 is included in a mattress in a<br>
bed (not shown), a different level of pressure or firmness can be provided for the upper,<br>
middle, and lower portions of the patient's body 56.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, the sleeve apparatus 16 includes a cell cover 96 surrounding each<br>
support cell 14. Each support cell 14. Each cell cover 96A, 96B, 96C, 96D, 96E, 96F, 96G,<br>
and 96H, is attached to each adjacent cell cover 96 by connections 98A, 98B, 98C, 98D, 98E,<br>
98F, and 98G. For example, the connections 98A-98G can be formed by a glued, heat sealed<br>
or sewn connection. Each cell cover 96 allows the exterior surface 100 of a corresponding<br>
envelope 34 to slide freely along an interior surface 102 of the cell cover 96, without<br>
transmitting this movement to an exterior surface 104 of the cell cover 96. For example as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 5, the support cell 14A includes the envelope 34A, which is surrounded by<br>
the cell cover 96A. The exterior surface 100A of the envelope 34A is free to slide along the<br>
interior surface 102A of the cell cover 96A. This sliding movement is not transmitted to the<br>
stationary exterior surface 104A of the cell cover 96A. The stationary exterior surface 104A<br>
is located on the side of the outer cover 22 (FIG. 11) on which the patient 56 is lying, so that<br>
the sliding movement of the envelope 34A is not transmitted to the patient. Therefore, the cell<br>
covers 96 of the sleeve apparatus 16 prevent frictional shear force abrasion damage to the skin<br>
of the patient 56.<br>
Another embodiment of a support system apparatus 106, provides an additional<br>
alternating pressure system 130 for providing alternating supply pressure to a plurality of<br>
zones "E" and "F" as illustrated in FIG. 7. The alternating pressure system 130 can include<br>
14<br><br>
any means for supplying the fluid 36 under pressure including a pump, compressor, etc. Also,<br>
included in the alternating pressure system 130 is any means such as a valve (not shown) for<br>
periodically switching the pressurized fluid 36 between conduit 132 and 134. Each support<br>
zone "E" and "F" comprises at least one support cell 14. Each support cell 14 includes at least<br>
one intake valve 40 and at least one port 43. Each intake valve 40 includes a check valve (not<br>
shown) allowing fluid 36 to flow into the support cell 14, while preventing fluid 36 from<br>
flowing out of the support cell 14. Each port 43 allows unimpeded fluid 36 flow into or out of<br>
the support cell 14. As illustrated in FIG. 7, each intake valve 40J-40Q is connected to the<br>
intake control system 44.<br>
The ports 43Q, 430, 43M, and 43K in zone "E" are connected to conduit or manifold<br>
108. The ports 43 J, 43L, 43N, and 43P in zone "F" are connected to conduit or manifold 110.<br>
A first end 112 of conduit 108 is connected to a check valve 114, and a second end 118 of<br>
conduit 108 is connected to a shut off valve 120. A first end 122 of conduit 110 is connected<br>
to a check valve 124, and a second end 126 of the conduit 110 is connected to a shut off valve<br>
128. Conduit 132 connects the shut off valve 120 with the alternating pressure system 130.<br>
Conduit 134 connects the shut off valve 128 with the alternating pressure system 130.<br>
Conduits 136 and 138 connect the check valve 114 and the check valve 124 with the exhaust<br>
control system 140.<br>
The shut off valve 120 can be a "quick disconnect" type that allows fluid 36 to flow<br>
through the shut off valve 120 when the conduit 132 is connected, and prevents any flow of<br>
the fluid 36 flow when the conduit 132 is disconnected. The shut off valve 128 can also be a<br>
"quick disconnect" type that allows fluid 36 to flow through the shut off valve 128 when the<br>
conduit 134 is connected, and prevents any flow of the fluid 36 when the conduit 134 is<br>
disconnected. Check valve 114 allows fluid 36 to flow from conduit 108 into conduit 136,<br>
and prevents fluid 36 from flowing from conduits 136 and 138 into conduit 108. Check valve<br>
124 allows fluid 36 to flow from conduit 110 into conduit 138, and prevents fluid 36 from<br>
flowing from conduits 138 and 136 into conduit 110. The exhaust control system 140<br>
includes a pressure relief valve 142 similar to the pressure relief valves described above.<br>
When shut off valves 120 and 128 are closed, the pressure relief valve 142 maintains<br>
the pressure of the fluid 36 below a selected level in the conduits 108 and 110. Each intake<br>
valve 40J-40Q allows fluid 36 to flow into each support cell 14J-14Q, respectively, while<br>
preventing fluid 36 from flowing out of each support cell 14J-14Q, respectively, (FIG. 7).<br>
15<br><br><br>
Each intake valve 40J-40Q is connected to the intake control system 44, which is connected to<br>
the fluid supply reservoir 52. Generally, the fluid 36 included in the fluid supply reservoir 52<br>
is atmospheric air, however, any other suitable fluids can be used. Conduits 108 and 110 are<br>
connected through ports 43 J-43Q to the zones "E" and "F". Therefore, the pressure relief<br>
valve 142 maintains the pressure of the fluid 36 below a selected level in zones "E" and "F".<br>
A rotatable knob 144 or other adjusting system included in the pressure relief valve 142<br>
allows a user to set the maximum pressure of the fluid 36 in the zones "E" and "F". The<br>
pressure relief valve 142 is connected to the fluid exhaust reservoir 54. When using<br>
atmospheric air, and with the shut off valves 120 and 128 closed, the support system apparatus<br>
106 is self-inflating and self-adjusting.<br>
The alternating pressure system 130 supplies alternating high and low pressure fluid<br>
36 to conduits 108 and 110. When conduit 132 is connected to shut off valve 120, and<br>
conduit 134 is connected to shut off valve 128, the alternating pressure is supplied to conduits<br>
108 and 110. The conduits 108 and 110 supply the alternating fluid 36 pressure to zones "E"<br>
and "F".<br>
For example, a high pressure fluid 36 may be supplied to the conduit 108 from the<br>
alternating pressure system 130, and a low pressure fluid 36 may be supplied to conduit 110,<br>
creating a high fluid 36 pressure in zone "E" and a low fluid 36 pressure in zone "F". The<br>
fluid 36 flows through check valve 114 to conduit 136 and 138, but is prevented by check<br>
valve 124 from flowing into conduit 110. The fluid 36 flow provided by the alternating<br>
pressure system 130 is much higher than the flow passing out through the pressure relief valve<br>
142, so that the high pressure fluid 36 fills the zone "E" support cells 14K, 14M, 140, and<br>
14Q as illustrated in FIG. 8. FIG. 9 illustrates the pressure levels in the support cells in zones<br>
"E" and "F". For this condition, the support cells 14 in zone "E" rise under the patient 56 and<br>
the support cells 14 in zone "F" lower under the patient 56.<br>
Next, a high fluid 36 pressure is supplied to conduit 110 and a low fluid 36 pressure is<br>
supplied to conduit 108, forcing a high pressure fluid 36 into zone "F" and a low pressure<br>
fluid 36 into zone "E". The fluid 36 flows through check valve 124 to conduit 138 and 136,<br>
but is prevented by check valve 114 from flowing back into the conduit 108. The fluid 36<br>
flow provided by the alternating pressure system 130 is much higher than the flow passing out<br>
through the pressure relief valve 142, so that the high pressure fluid 36 fills the zone "F"<br>
16<br><br><br>
support cells 14J, 14L, 14N, and 14P. FIG. 10 illustrates the pressure levels in the support<br>
cells 14 in zones "E" and "F". For this condition, the zone "F" support cells 14 rise under the<br>
patient 56 and the zone "E" support cells 14 lower under the patient 56.<br>
The alternating rising and lowering of the support cells 14 in the zones "E" and "F"<br>
under the patient 56, provides beneficial movement of the skeleton and tissue in the patient<br>
56. The movement helps stimulate circulation and lymph fluid movement in the patient 56.<br>
The alternating pressure system 130 includes a computerized control system 131 that<br>
is programmed to supply alternating pressures to a plurality of support cells 14 in any<br>
sequence that is desired by the user.<br>
Another embodiment of a support system apparatus 180 with a plurality of support<br>
cells 14 is illustrated in FIG. 16. This embodiment shows another example of the shape of<br>
support cells 14AA-14SS. The support cells 14 can be inter-connected in a manner similar to<br>
the support system apparatus 12 and the support system apparatus 106 to provide the support<br>
system apparatus 180 with self-inflating, self-adjusting, zoned pressure control, and<br>
alternating pressure support and movement to a person lying on the support system apparatus<br>
180. The computerized control system 131 included in the alternating pressure system 130<br>
may be programmed to supply alternating pressures to the plurality of the support cells 14AA-<br>
14SS in any sequence that is desired by the user.<br>
FIG. 11 illustrates a cut-away perspective view of a mattress cushioning device 200.<br>
The mattress cushioning device 200 includes a torso support system 220, a heel support<br>
system 240, and a sleeve apparatus 260, the jacket 18, the topper cushion 20, and the outer<br>
cover 22. The torso support system apparatus 220 includes a plurality of support cells 14, the<br>
side wall 28, the end wall 26, and the side wall 30. The side walls 28 and 30 and the end wall<br>
26 are formed from a resilient material. The sleeve apparatus 260 includes cell covers 96.<br>
Each cell cover 96 surrounds a support cell 14 to prevent sliding and frictional motion to be<br>
transmitted to the patient 56. The support cells 14 provide self-inflating and self-adjusting<br>
pressure support to the torso region of a patient 56 resting on the support system apparatus<br>
220. The support cells 14 extend in a longitudinal direction of the mattress cushioning device<br>
200. Also, alternating pressure can be applied to the individual support cells 14 under the<br>
patient 56 to provide therapeutic movement to the body of the patient 56.<br>
The heel support system apparatus 240 includes a plurality of support cells 14, the end<br>
wall 29, a side wall 242, and a side wall 244. The heel support system 240 provides support<br>
17<br><br>
for the heel area of a patient 56. The support cells 14 extend in a transverse direction on the<br>
mattress cushioning device 200.<br>
The jacket 18 surrounds the torso support system apparatus 220 and the heel support<br>
system apparatus 240. The topper cushion 20 lies on top of the jacket 18 and provides further<br>
cushioning and comfort to the patient 56. The topper cushion 20 can be composed of any<br>
resilient material, for example, foam, down feathers, an inflatable air cushion, etc.<br>
The outer cover 22 is illustrated in FIGS. 11 and 12. The outer cover 22 of the<br>
mattress cushioning device 200 provides a low friction and low shear surface further<br>
protecting the patient 56 from frictional tissue damage. Additionally, the outer cover 22<br>
provides a waterproof and stain resistant surface. For medical uses the outer cover 22 can be<br>
made from an anti-microbial type material. The outer cover 22 includes end walls 202 and<br>
204, side walls 206 and 208, a top wall 210 and a bottom wall 212. A closure 214 joins an<br>
upper portion 216 to a lower portion 218 of the outer cover 22. The closure 214 may<br>
comprise, for example, a zipper, snaps, hook and eye fasteners, etc. The side walls 206 and<br>
208 can include stretchable panels 222 and 224 that allows the outer cover 22 to expand and<br>
contract as the support cells 14 rise and fall within the outer cover 22. The displacement of<br>
the support cells 14 is accommodated by the stretchable panels 222 and 224 so that stretching<br>
of the top wall 210 is prevented. Thus, the top wall does not transmit shear forces to the<br>
patient 56 resting on the top wall 210. Flexible handles 226 can be attached to the outer cover<br>
22 to allow a user to grasp and move the mattress cushioning device 200.<br>
An embodiment of a seat cushioning device 260 in accordance with the present<br>
invention is illustrated in FIG. 15. The seat cushioning device 260 includes three supporting<br>
sections 262,264, and 266. Each section 262,264, and 266 includes at least one support cell<br>
14. The support cells 14 can be inter-connected in a manner similar to the support system<br>
apparatus 12, the support system apparatus 180, and the support system apparatus 106 to<br>
provide the seat cushioning device 260 with self-inflating, self-adjusting, zoned pressure<br>
control, and alternating pressure support and movement to a person sitting on the seat<br>
cushioning device 260. For example, the supporting sections 262, 264, and 266 may each<br>
include an intake valve 263 and an exhaust valve 265. The exhaust valves 265 are<br>
interconnected by an exhaust control system 267 having a controllable pressure relief valve<br>
269. As in previous embodiments of the present invention, the pressure relief valve 269 is<br>
provided to control the maximum pressure level of the fluid in each of the supporting sections<br>
18<br><br>
262, 264, and 266.<br>
Another embodiment of a support system apparatus 612 is illustrated in FIG. 19,<br>
which includes at least one support cell, or fluid cell 614, that fits into a holding mechanism<br>
or casing 620, a topper cushion 650 positioned above the cells to provide further cushioning,<br>
and an outer cover 652. The embodiment shown in FIG. 19 shows another example of the<br>
shape of support cells 614A-614O. The support cells 614 can be interconnected in a manner<br>
similar to the support system apparatus 12 and the support system apparatus 106 to provide<br>
the support system apparatus 612 with self-inflating, self-adjusting, zoned pressure control,<br>
and alternating pressure support and movement to a person lying on the support system<br>
apparatus 612. The computerized control system 131 included in the alternating pressure<br>
system 130 may be programmed to supply alternating pressures to the plurality of the support<br>
cells 614A-614O in any sequence that is desired by the user.<br>
The support system apparatus 612 includes at least one support cell or fluid cell 614<br>
for providing support of a patient 56. The fluid cell 614 may be referred to as a pod. The<br>
greater the number of fluid cells 614, the more responsive the apparatus will be to a weight or<br>
load. FIG. 23 illustrates side view of a typical fluid cell 614 having a helical pattern 530 on<br>
its outer construct, a vertical rotational axis 540, and a plurality of ports, 640A and 640B. The<br>
fluid cells 614 may have a single helical pattern or a double helical pattern on the outer<br>
construct. However, the fluid cell 614 may also be any fluid cell which has a spring bias<br>
which effects the reformation of the fluid cell such that the fluid cell collapses when loaded<br>
with a load having a force which is greater than the sum of the forces within the fluid cell,<br>
including the pressure of the fluid inside the fluid cell multiplied by the area of the fluid cell<br>
supporting the load, plus the reforming force of the fluid cell, and said fluid cell reforms when<br>
said load is reduced to a load having a force which is less than the sum of the forces within the<br>
fluid cell and the reforming force of the fluid cell. In other words, once the fluid cell 614 is<br>
compressed with the weight of a person or article, the fluid cell 614 exerts a reforming force<br>
so as to reform when the weight is reduced. The application of an external load on the fluid<br>
cell 614 causes the fluid cell 614 to deform into a compressed form. The fluid cell 614<br>
provides a reforming force which causes the fluid cell 614 to return to its original form when<br>
the external load is removed from the fluid cell 614 such that the fluid cell is self-inflating.<br>
The fluid cell 614 is formed from a resilient material that can contain a fluid such as<br>
air, water, or nitrogen. The fluid cell 614 may be formed from plastic resin or any elastomeric<br>
19<br><br>
material that may be compression molded. However, the fluid cell 614 could also be a metal<br>
coiled spring 500 (FIG. 17) which is surrounded by a resilient material as a surface cover 502.<br>
The surface cover 502 may be fabric, waterproof material, rubber, plastic, moisture wicking<br>
material, microfiber, or any material which would resiliently or yieldingly cover the spring<br>
500 and be resiliently or yieldingly supported by the spring 500 while containing a fluid. The<br>
fluid cell 614 could also be in the form of a bellows 520 (FIG. 18) which is formed from a<br>
pliable resilient material such as plastic and filled with fluid such as air.<br>
Both fluid cell movement and the firmness and softness of the fluid cells are<br>
determined by the properties of the fluid cell 614, and the pressure level at which the<br>
controllable pressure relief valve 62 is set. For example, variables such as base material<br>
height, ILD (Incidence of Load Deflection), density of the fluid cell material, air pressure,<br>
fluid cell height, air flow control, air sound control, direction of air flow, and speed of air<br>
movement all affect the response of the fluid cell to a force. In addition, the height of the fluid<br>
cell, the diameter of the fluid cell, the wall thickness of the fluid cell, the type of resin used to<br>
form the fluid cell, and the pitch or angle of the helix coupled with the OD and ID radius of<br>
the helix contribute to controlling the firmness of the fluid cells 614. The fluid cells 614 can<br>
contain air, or any suitable fluid (e.g., air, nitrogen, water, etc.).<br>
The embodiment in FIG. 23 shows a cylindrical fluid cell or pod 614 having a double<br>
or twin helix pattern 530. The double helix design 530 controls stability and deflection of the<br>
fluid cell 614 such that the fluid cell 614 closely maintains its alignment parallel to its vertical<br>
rotational axis 540 during compression and reformation. FIGs. 23 and 24 show that each<br>
fluid cell 614 has a plurality of ports 640. There may be an intake port 640A and an exhaust<br>
port 640B. The intake port 640A may contain an intake check valve 642A allowing fluid 36<br>
to flow into the support cell 614, while preventing fluid 36 from flowing out of the support<br>
cell 614. Likewise, each exhaust port 640B may include an exhaust check valve 642B<br>
allowing fluid to flow out of the fluid cell while preventing fluid 36 from flowing back into<br>
the fluid cell 614.<br>
Air sound control is achieved using sound control battens 648, as shown in FIG. 24, in<br>
either the ports 640 or the conduits extending from the fluid cells 614. FIG. 24 shows that a<br>
sound control batten 648 in may be included in the intake and/or exhaust ports 640A and<br>
640B, or in the conduit 363 operatively connected to the fluid cells 614. The sound control<br>
batten 648 is for reducing the sound during intake and exhaust of the fluid cell 614. The<br>
20<br><br>
sound control batten 648 can be reticulated foam, a variegated surface, or any material that<br>
would fit within a port, conduit, or connection extending from the port, and function to reduce<br>
the sound of air movement during intake and exhaust. The sound control batten 648 may be<br>
formed from a flexible or rigid material. A sound control batten 648 may also be included in<br>
the embodiments shown in FIGs. 1, 3, 4, 7, and 16.<br>
An example of a support system apparatus 612 for a mattress includes a plurality of<br>
fluid cells 614A, 614B, 614C, 614D, 614E, 614F, 614G, 614H, 6141, 614J, 614K, 614L,<br>
614M, 614N, and 6140 as is illustrated in FIG. 19. The fluid cells 614 are held together by a<br>
base housing, or casing, 620, which is adapted to receive or accept the fluid cells 614. The<br>
casing 620 is a holding mechanism that controls air pod movement about the surface. The<br>
casing 620 may be composed of air or foam or other porous or non-porous materials. The<br>
casing 620 may be a foam casing, plastic webbing, or any configuration that affixes the fluid<br>
cells 614 together to form a mattress, cushion, or support apparatus. FIG. 19 shows a casing<br>
620 that is a foam casing including bays 622 for receiving the fluid cells 614. The casing 620<br>
functions as a fluid cell receiver and is a means of affixing the fluid cells together to form a<br>
mattress construct. The casing 620 provides fluid cell stability by utilizing variable heights<br>
(H) of the base, by altering the ILD, density and air pressure of the mass of the base housing<br>
(not limited to foam), and the relationship of base material to the number of fluid cells in a<br>
given area. The casing 620 supports, houses, and prevents movement of the fluid cells 614<br>
and the air supply system 630.<br>
FIG. 20A shows a side view of an embodiment of a casing 620 with the fluid cells 614<br>
installed therein, and FIG. 20B shows a side view of a casing 620 without the fluid cells 614<br>
installed therein. Dotted lines indicate that the casing 620 in this foam embodiment may be<br>
various heights (H), which would affect the depth of the bays 622. For example, as shown in<br>
FIG. 20A, the casing may be a height (H) which is a small portion of the height of the fluid<br>
cells 614. Conversely, the casing 620 can extend vertically up to, or near to, the same height<br>
as the fluid cells 614. In order to hold the fluid cell 614 within the casing, the casing can<br>
include threaded constructs 624 in the openings or bays 622 adapted to receive the threaded<br>
(i.e., helical) exterior of the fluid cells 614.<br>
FIG. 21 shows another embodiment of a casing 620 having a plurality of pads 621. At<br>
least one of the pads, in this embodiment the top pad, or first pad, 626, is adapted to accept the<br>
plurality of fluid cells. For example, as shown in FIG. 21, the pad includes openings or bays<br>
21<br><br>
622 that generally conform to the shape of the fluid cells 614 and secure the fluid cells 614<br>
during use of the apparatus 612. The casing 620 may have one or more side walls 628, and a<br>
bottom pad, or second pad, 627.<br>
FIG. 22 shows a top perspective view of a casing 620 without the fluid cells installed<br>
and illustrates the bays 622A-622O for receiving the fluid cells 614. The casing 620 may<br>
include paths 660 between the bays 622 for receiving the conduits which interconnect the<br>
fluid cells 614 (FIG. 22). The paths 660 can be openings or slits in the casing 620 and may be<br>
cut or molded into the base housing 620.<br>
FIG. 19 shows that the support system apparatus has a topper cushion 650 and an outer<br>
cover 652. The topper cushion 650 rests above of the fluid cells 614 and casing 620 to<br>
provide further cushioning. The topper cushion 650 may be formed from a layered fiber filled<br>
material or any other suitable material that provides cushioning such as foam, wool, or a<br>
moisture wicking material. The casing 620, fluid cells 614, and topper cushion 650 are<br>
contained by an outer cover 652 which may have a low friction and low shear surface for<br>
further protecting the patient from frictional tissue damage. Additionally, the outer cover 652<br>
provides a waterproof and stain resistant surface. The outer cover 652 can be expandable,<br>
waterproof, or moisture wicking. The outer cover 652 may include one or more stretchable<br>
panels to provide expansion space.<br>
For medical uses, the outer cover 652 can be made from an anti-microbial type material.<br>
The foregoing description of the present invention has been presented for purposes of<br>
illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the<br>
precise form disclosed, and many modifications and variations are possible in light of the<br>
above teaching. For example, the cushioning device of the present invention is suitable for<br>
