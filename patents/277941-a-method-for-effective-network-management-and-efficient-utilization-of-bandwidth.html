				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
<br>
Partial or full use of El/VC-12 interface as a control channel for SDH/SONET Network Elements.<br>
<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
<br>
The conventional scheme uses the SDH/SONET overhead bytes Dl to D3 or D4 to D12 as the control channel for connecting remotely located Network Elements (NEs) to the NMS stations. The conventional scheme has two main drawbacks.<br>
<br>
1.	This scheme demand that all the NE connected in a network must use the same type of protocols and messaging structure to connect various NEs.<br>
<br>
2.	Also the bandwidth of the available control channel is limited to either 192Kbps or 576Kbps as per the Data Communication Channel (DCC) bytes used.<br>
<br>
The new scheme provides a transparent way to skip alien vendor equipments connected in between NEs. The scheme also enhances the bandwidth capacity of the control channel to 2 Mbps. This is made possible by using an available El traffic port as a control channel to carry the NMS control packets.<br>
<br>

<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to develop a system for effective network management and efficient utilization of bandwidth in an alien vendor equipments-based SDH/SONET network.<br>
<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
<br>
The primary embodiment of the present invention is a method for effective network management and efficient utilization of bandwidth in SDH/SONET network, said method comprising steps of: connecting El/VC-12 channel as control channel into an High-level Data Link Control (HDLC) channel of the network using VCxx cross connect in the SDH/SONET, and building logic into logic modules of equipments in said network for performing effective network management and efficient utilization of the bandwidth.<br>
<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the El/VC-12 channel bandwidth is either partially or fully selected.<br>
<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the method provides for cross-connection and de-mapping of predetermined bandwidth into HDLC Channels.<br>
<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention-the method provides more bandwidth using El/VC-12 port as a control charmel to carry NMS control packets compared to Data Communication Channel (DCC).<br>
<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the control channel is selected from a group comprising DSl/VCll, DSI/VC12, E3/VC3, DS3/VC3.<br>
 <br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the packet framing structure is selected from a group comprising frame relay, Generic Frame protocol (GFP) and Ethernet.<br>
<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is a system for effective network management and efficient utilization of bandwidth in SDH/SONET network comprising; a node connected to the network with ElA'^C-12 channel as control channel using VCxx cross connect, and a logic module of the node having TDM switch to connect the El channel to the node.<br>
<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the logic module selects the El/VC-12 channel bandwidth either partially or fully as the control channel.<br>
<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention El/VC-12 port as the control channel provides a more bandwidth compared to Data Communication Channel (DCC).<br>
<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the node either maps or demaps network management control packets.<br>
<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the control channel is selected from a group comprising DSl/VCl 1, DSIAVC12, E3AVC3, DS3/VC3.<br>
<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the packet framing structure is selected from a group comprising frame relay, Generic Frame protocol (GFP) and Ethernet.<br>
<br>
The new scheme uses the VCxx cross-connect fabric available in SDH/SONET multiplexers to connect the El chaimel selected as a control channel into a High-level Data Link Control (HDLC) channel available in the processing complex of the system. A cross-connect which has access to lower-rate channels in higher-rate multiplexed signals and can rearrange those charmels. An SDH/SONET cross-connect accepts various SDH rates, accesses the STM-l signals, and connects payloads. SDH/SONET cross-connect may be used to interconnect a much larger number of STM-ls. The cross-connect can be<br>
used for grooming i.e. consolidating or segregating of STM-ls or for broadband traffic management. For example, it may be used to segregate high bandwidth from low-bandwidth traffic and send them separately to the high-bandwidth (for example video) switch and a low-bandwidth (voice) switch.<br>
<br>
The TDM mode working of the HDLC channel is used to treat the selected El channel as an enhanced bandwidth DCC channel. The logic is buiU into the logic modules available in products. Even it is possible to select a partial bandwidth from the full 2 Mbps of El channel as the relevant control channel by using the programmable logic in the Hardware and Software. Such programmable logic consists of 64Kbps capacity TDM switch which connects from said El channel to processor sub system. The software can switch only the required capacity for selecting partial bandwidth.<br>
<br>
El channel is a Layer 1 circuit. It carries clear charmel HDLC as layer 2 protocol. This HDLC channel is terminated on control sub-system to map/demaps NMS control packets. HDLC is a group of protocols for transmitting (synchronous) data Packets between Point-to-Point nodes. In HDLC, data is organized into a frame. HDLC protocol resides with Layer 2 of the OSI model, the data link layer. HDLC uses zero insertioiVdeletion process i.e. bit stuffing to ensure that the bit pattern of the delimiter flag does not occur in the fields between flags. The HDLC frame is synchronous and therefore relies on the physical layer to provide method of clocking and synchronizing the transmission and reception of frames.<br>
<br>
Since SONET/SDH is a point-to-point circuit, PPP is well suited to use over these links. Point to Point Protocol (PPP) in HDLC-like framing presents an octet interface to the physical layer. The octet stream is mapped into the SONET STS-SPE/SDH Higher Order VC, with the octet boundaries aligned with the SONET STS-SPE/SDH Higher Order VC octet boundaries. The PPP frames are located by row within the SONET STS-SPE/SDH Higher Order VC payload. Because frames are variable in length, the frames are allowed to cross SONET STS-SPE/SDH Higher Order VC boundaries.<br>
<br>
Network Management involves a solitary network consultant monitoring network activity with an outdated protocol analyzer. In other cases, network management involves a distributed database, auto polling of network devices, and high-end workstations generating real-time graphical views of network topology changes and traffic. In general, network management is a service that employs a variety of tools, applications, and devices to assist human network managers in monitoring and maintaining networks.<br>
<br>
The usage of networks has proliferated over the last decade. Networks are now emerging as a conduit for integrated access, transport, and switching of voice, high-speed data, and video. Multiple technologies support such diverse requirements adding to the complexity. This complexity stipulates efficient management of Network Elements (NE), Element Management System (EMS) and that involves integrating multiple vendor equipment, management systems, and software applications.<br>
<br>
Figure 1 provides for a broad perspective of methodology of instant invention. It also shows the El management in the network and alien NEs as well as proposed NEs. Figure 2 shows the El and VC12 interfaces in SDH/SONET network element. El interfaces are terminated on physical El ports or embedded in VC12 circuit which in turn is carried in SDH interface.<br>
<br>
Mechanisms adopted to skip the alien vendor equipments:<br>
<br>
In a typical transport networks, all SDH/SONET NE can switch at VCxx level. In order to carry E1/VC12 interface through the alien network, all the alien NE needs to switch the management E1/VC12 circuit like any other traffic carrying circuit. There is no change required in alien NE functionality.<br>
<br>
Figure 2 shows a scenario where NMS is connected on NE. The NMS software (Tejas NMS, (6)) connects to Tejas NE (5) using an Ethernet link. The Tejas NE (5) processes the control information on Ethernet link and maps it into E1A^C12 channel rather than the conventional way of putting it in DCC control channel. The alien NE (1, 8) is programmed to cross connect E1/VC12 channel. The Tejas NE (2) can understand the E1/VC12 channels as control channels and thus can respond to NMS system.<br>
<br>
Figure 3 shows a scenario where NMS can directly coimect to alien NEs El port. In this case the Tejas NMS (6) connects to Alien NE (1) through a router. Router maps Ethernet <br>
packets from Tejas NMS to El interface. Alien NE (1) maps the physical El transparently into VC12 and does a cross connection. Intermediate alien NE (1,8) cross connects the E1/VC12 channel. The Tejas NE (2) can understand the E1/VC12 channels as control channels and thus can respond to Tejas NMS system.<br>
<br>
The invention is inventive in nature and not obvious to a normal person because it requires detailed knowledge of the DCN architecture, the SDH/SONET Cross-connect fabric behavior as well as the principles of TDM usage method in HDLC channels. This combination is rare in the field since it spans multiple domains of control plane and data plane architecture and an inventive way to make them use each other.<br>
