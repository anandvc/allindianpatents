PUMP ROTOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a pump rotor used in an internal gear pump that<br>
pumps in and pumps out fluid by changing the cell volume formed between gear tooth<br>
surfaces of an inner pump rotor and an outer pump rotor.<br>
BACKGROUND ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]<br>
This type of pump rotor has been widely used in an internal gear pump such as<br>
lubricant oil pump, oil pump for automatic transmission or the like in a vehicle (for example,<br>
refer to Patent Document 1). The internal gear pump includes an inner pump rotor having<br>
outer gear teeth; an outer pump rotor having inner gear teeth that mesh with the outer gear<br>
teeth; and a casing having a pumping-in port, through which fluid is pumped in, and a<br>
pumping-out port, through which the fluid is pumped out. The internal gear pump pumps in<br>
and pumps out the fluid by changing the cell volume formed between gear tooth surfaces of<br>
the rotors so as to carry the fluid when the rotors mesh with each other and rotate. In addition,<br>
the rotors mesh with each other and rotate while both end surfaces of the rotors in the<br>
direction of the rotation axes and an outer circumferential surface of the outer pump rotor<br>
slide on an inner surface of the casing.<br>
[0003]<br>
Meanwhile, the internal gear pump, in general, is disposed between a fluid (for<br>
example, lubricant oil) supplier (for example, cylinder head) and an oil pan, which stores the<br>
fluid, and communicates with the oil pan through a strainer. When the internal gear pump is<br><br>
2<br>
activated, the fluid in the oil pan is supplied to the inside of the internal gear pump from the<br>
strainer, and pumped in and pumped out by changing the cell volume in the internal gear<br>
pump, as described above, so as to be supplied to the cylinder head or the like.<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No.<br>
H11-343985<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]<br>
Meanwhile, when an internal gear pump is activated, the lubricating ability between<br>
an inner surface of a casing and both end surfaces of both rotors in a direction of rotation axes,<br>
and the inner surface of the casing and an outer circumferential surface of an outer pump rotor<br>
is provided by fluid supplied to the inside of the pump from an oil pan. That is, generally, no<br>
device is provided separately in order to supply lubricant oil for the lubricating ability inside<br>
of the internal gear pump.<br>
As a result, when the internal gear pump is reactivated, no lubricant oil exists or only<br>
a small amount of lubricant oil exists, if any, between the inner surface of the casing and the<br>
end surfaces, and the inner surface of the casing and the outer circumferential surface of the<br>
outer pump rotor. Thereby, the lubricating ability between the inner surface of the casing and<br>
the end surfaces, and the inner surface of the casing and the outer circumferential surface are<br>
rarely secured. Therefore, the pump rotor can easily be galled when the internal gear pump is<br>
repeatedly used.<br>
[0005]<br>
The present invention was conceived in view of the above described problem points<br>
and it is an object thereof to provide a pump rotor having an improved anti-galling.<br><br>
3<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM<br>
[0006]<br>
In order to achieve the above object, a pump rotor according to the present invention<br>
is a pump rotor used in an internal gear pump including an inner pump rotor having outer gear<br>
teeth; an outer pump rotor having inner gear teeth that mesh with the outer gear teeth; and a<br>
casing having a pumping-in port, through which a fluid is pumped in, and a pumping-out port,<br>
through which the fluid is pumped out, the pump rotor pumping in and pumping out the fluid<br>
by volume change of cells formed between gear tooth surfaces of the rotors so as to carry the<br>
fluid when the rotors mesh with each other and rotate, wherein the pump rotor is formed from<br>
a sintered material of Fe-Cu-C and has a density not less than 6.6 g/cm3 and not more than 7.1<br>
g/cm3, and at least an outer circumferential surface of the outer pump rotor and both end<br>
surfaces perpendicular to rotation axes of the rotors are non-grinded surfaces and have ten<br>
point height of irregularities Rz not less than 4 urn and not more than 10 m.<br>
[0007]<br>
According to the present invention, since the outer circumferential surface of the<br>
outer pump rotor and the end surfaces perpendicular to the rotation axes of the rotors, which<br>
slide on the inner surface of the casing when the internal gear pump is activated, are non-<br>
grinded surfaces and have the ten point height of irregularities not less than 4 m and not<br>
more than 10 um, part of the fluid pumped into the inside of the internal gear pump during<br>
activation can be retained at the outer circumferential surface and the end surfaces when the<br>
internal gear pump stops after activation. That is, when the internal gear pump stops, a part of<br>
the fluid can be retained at fine holes on the non-grinded surfaces, that is, part of the fluid can<br>
be absorbed into the surface portions of the outer circumferential surface and the end surfaces.<br>
Therefore, the part of the fluid can act as the lubricant oil between the inner surface of the<br><br>
4<br>
casing and the outer circumferential surface of the outer pump rotor, and the inner surface of<br>
the casing and the end surfaces of the rotors when the internal gear pump is reactivated after<br>
stopped, and thus the anti-galling of the pump rotor can be improved.<br>
[0008]<br>
In addition, since the pump rotor is formed from a sintered material of Fe-Cu-C and<br>
has a density not less than 6.6 g/cm3 and not more than 7.1 g/cm3, the breaking strength and<br>
surface durability of the pump rotor can be secured to the minimum necessary value. In this<br>
case, the pump rotor is fabricated by pressure forming, sintering, and sizing. The pump rotor<br>
is formed from the above material and has the above density; therefore, collapses of<br>
intersecting ridge portions between the end surfaces and the gear tooth surfaces of the pump<br>
rotor can be prevented from expanding due to crushing of the intersecting ridge portions<br>
during the sizing process. As a result, it is possible to suppress the leakage of the fluid in the<br>
cells from the intersecting ridge portions to a gap between the end surfaces and the inner<br>
surface of the casing when the internal gear pump is activated and to make the cells divided<br>
by the intersecting ridge portions, the gear tooth surfaces, and the inner surface of the casing<br>
have high liquid-tightness.<br>
[0009]<br>
In this case, it is desirable that the intersecting ridge portions between the end<br>
surfaces and the gear tooth surfaces have a rising amount of 0.01 mm or less in the direction<br>
of the rotation axes from the end surfaces and a protruding amount of 0.05 mm or less in the<br>
radius direction from the gear tooth surfaces.<br>
[0010]<br>
In this case, it is possible to make the intersecting ridge portions into contact with the<br>
inner surface of the casing in the internal gear pump having the pump rotors since the<br>
intersecting ridge portions have the rising and protruding amounts in the above ranges. As a<br><br>
5<br>
result, the cells are divided by the intersecting ridge portions, the gear tooth surfaces and the<br>
inner surface of the casing, thereby the cells can have high liquid-tightness, and thus the<br>
leakage of the fluid in the cells through a gap between the end surfaces and the inner surface<br>
of the casing can be assuredly suppressed when the internal gear pump is activated.<br>
[0011]<br>
Furthermore, setting the rising amount in the above range result in making the<br>
intersecting ridge portions of the end surfaces be in contact with the inner surface of the<br>
casing; therefore, partial wear does not easily occur on the inner surface, and the lifespan of<br>
the internal gear pump can be prevented from being shortened.<br>
Still furthermore, since the protruding amount is set in the above range, the<br>
intermediate portions of the rotors in the thickness direction can be in contact with each other<br>
when the teeth of the gears mesh with each other, while the intersecting ridge portions are in<br>
contact with each other. Therefore, the respective cells can be assuredly divided in the<br>
circumferential direction, and the fluid-carrying performance of the pump rarely deteriorates.<br>
EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012]<br>
According to the present invention, the anti-galling property of the pump rotor can be<br>
improved.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0015]<br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawings.<br>
An internal gear pump 10 shown in FIG. 1 includes an inner pump rotor 20 having<br>
"n" outer gear teeth 21 ("n" is a natural number, "n" = 9 in the present embodiment); an outer<br>
pump rotor 30 having (n+1) (i.e., 10 in the present embodiment) inner gear teeth 31 that mesh<br><br>
8<br>
with the outer gear teeth 21 respectively; and a driving shaft 60 inserted in an attaching hole<br>
22 formed at the inner pump rotor 20. All components are stored in a casing 50.<br>
[0016]<br>
A rotary driving force is transmitted to the attaching hole 22 by the rotation of the<br>
driving shaft 60 around an axis 01 thereof, and the inner pump rotor 20 also rotates around<br>
the axis 01. In addition, the outer gear teeth 21 mesh with the inner gear teeth 31 so as to<br>
transmit the rotary driving force of the rotor 20 to the outer pump rotor 30; thereby the rotor<br>
30 rotates around an axis 02 of the rotor 30.<br>
In this case, the rotors 20 and 30 rotate while both end surfaces of the rotors 20 and<br>
30 in the rotation axes 01 and 02, that is, the end surfaces 20a and 30a perpendicular to the<br>
rotation axes 01 and 02 and an outer circumferential surface 30b of the outer pump rotor 30<br>
are in contact with an inner surface 50a of the casing 50.<br>
[0017]<br>
In this case, a plurality of cells C are formed along the rotating direction of the rotors<br>
20 and 30 between the gear tooth surfaces of the inner pump rotor 20 and the outer pump<br>
rotor 30. The cells C are divided separately at the front and rear sides of the rotating direction<br>
of the rotors 20 and 30 by the outer gear teeth 21 of the inner pump rotor 20 are contact with<br>
the inner gear teeth 31 of the outer pump rotor 30 respectively, and both side surfaces are<br>
divided by the inner surface of the casing 50, thereby fluid-carrying chambers are formed<br>
separately. In addition, the rotation of the rotors 20 and 30 accompanies the rotational<br>
moving of the cells C; and the volume of the cells C continuously increases and decreases on<br>
a cycle of one rotation.<br>
[0018]<br>
The casing 50 includes a pumping-in port 51 which communicates with the cells C<br>
when the volume of the cells C increases, and a pumping-out port 52 which communicates<br><br>
9<br>
with the cells C when the volume of the cells C decreases, and the fluid pumped into the cells<br>
C through the pumping-in port 51 is carried and pumped out through the pumping-out port 52<br>
while the rotors 20 and 30 rotate.<br>
[0019]<br>
In this case, the rotors 20 and 30 according to the present embodiment are formed<br>
from a sintered material of Fe-C-Cu containing at least Cu not less than 1% and not more than<br>
4% by weight and C not less than 0.2% and not more than 1.0% by weight, for example, Fe-<br>
0.7C-2.0Cu, Fe-0.8C-l .5Cu-4.0Ni-0.5Mo or the like. If Cu is less than 1% by weight, solid-<br>
solution hardening of Fe (hardness, strength) is not sufficient; and if Cu is more than 4% by<br>
weight, the expansion during a sintering process is greatly, therefore, the rotor is hard to shape<br>
with a high precision. If C is less than 0.2% by weight, solid-solution hardening of Fe<br>
(hardness, strength) is not sufficient; and if C is more than 1.0% by weight, the fluidity of the<br>
powder deteriorates during the powder shaping, therefore, it becomes impossible to form the<br>
rotor uniformly in density throughout the entire area.<br>
In addition, the rotors 20 and 30 have a density of not less than 6.6 g/cm3 and not<br>
more than 7.1 g/cm3, and at least the outer circumferential surface 30b of the outer pump rotor<br>
30 and the end surfaces 20a and 30a of the rotors 20 and 30 in the direction of the rotation<br>
axes 01 and 02 are non-grinded surface having ten point height of irregularities Rz of not<br>
less than 4 urn and not more than 10 m. Furthermore, the rotors 20 and 30 have porosity of<br>
not less than 10% and not more than 20%.<br>
[0020]<br>
In the present embodiment, the entire outer surfaces of the rotors 20 and 30,<br>
including the end surfaces 20a and 30a and the outer circumferential surface 30b, are non-<br>
grinded surfaces and have the ten point height of irregularities Rz in the above range. In<br>
addition, fluctuations of distances (thickness) R1 between the end surfaces 20a and 20a, and<br><br>
10<br>
30a and 30a in the rotors 20 and 30 are not less than 0.02 mm and not more than 0.10 mm<br>
throughout the respective end surfaces 20a and 30a.<br>
[0021]<br>
Meanwhile, a fluctuation of an outer diameter R2 of the outer pump rotor 30 is not<br>
less than 0.06 mm and not more than 0.15 mm. In addition, the difference between the inner<br>
diameter of the inner surface 50a of the casing 50 and the outer diameter R2 of the outer<br>
pump rotor 30 is not less than 0.06 mm and not more than 0.35 mm, and the differences<br>
between the depth of the inner surface 50a of the casing 50 and the thickness R1 of the rotors<br>
20 and 30 are not less than 0.02 mm and not more than 0.10 mm.<br>
[0022]<br>
Furthermore, in the present embodiment, intersecting ridge portions 20c and 30c<br>
between the end surfaces 20a and 30a and the gear tooth surfaces have a rising amount Y of<br>
0.01 mm or less in the direction of the rotation axes 01 and 02 from the end surfaces 20a and<br>
30a and a protruding amount Z of 0.05 mm or less in the radius direction from the gear tooth<br>
surfaces in the respective rotors 20 and 30. That is, the respective intersecting ridge portions<br>
20c and 30c have the rising amount Y and the protruding amount Z in the above ranges, and<br>
the intersecting ridge portion 20c protrudes outward in the radius direction with a curved<br>
surface and the intersecting ridge portion 30c protrudes inward in the radius direction with a<br>
curved surface.<br>
[0023]<br>
Next, a manufacturing method of the inner pump rotor 20 and the outer pump rotor<br>
30 having the above structure will be described. The rotors 20 and 30 are manufactured as<br>
follows: powder is compression-shaped to produce a green compact. The green compact is<br>
sintered and then performed a sizing. After that, the rotors 20 and 30 are obtained by<br><br>
11<br>
removing burrs without surface grinding. Hereinafter, a shaping method of the green compact<br>
will be described.<br>
[0024]<br>
FIGS. 5 to 8 show important parts of a powder-shaping device 1000 that shapes the<br>
green compact. In these drawings, reference symbol 110 is an upper punch, reference symbol<br>
120 is a lower punch, reference symbol 130 is a core rod, reference symbol 140 is a die,<br>
reference symbol 150 is a shoebox, reference symbol 160 is a measuring device that measures<br>
the distance between the punches (bottom dead point-adjusting linear scale), and P is a<br>
powder.<br>
[0025]<br>
The die 140 includes a shaping hole, and the core rod 130 is disposed at the center of<br>
the shaping hole. A cylindrical space formed between the shaping hole and the core rod 130<br>
is shut by the cylindrical lower punch 120 fitted from the bottom and the cylindrical upper<br>
punch 110 fitted from the top so as to form a cavity 100a. The material powder P is pressed<br>
in the cavity 100a, and thus a green compact Zl (see FIG. 8) is shaped along the shape of the<br>
cavity 100a.<br>
[0026]<br>
The shoebox 150 that fills the material powder P in the cavity 100a is shaped like a<br>
box with the bottom surface open and slides back-and-forth (right-and-left in the drawings) on<br>
an upper surface of the die 140 in a state in which a bottom surface thereof is in contact with<br>
the upper surface of the die 140. The material powder P is supplied from a hopper (not<br>
shown) into the shoebox 150. The shoebox 150 advances to a position shown in FIG. 5,<br>
under which the cavity 100a exits, and then falls the material powder P stored therein into the<br>
cavity 100a; and the cavity 100a is filled with the material powder P .<br>
[0027]<br><br>
12<br>
The upper punch 110 is fixed to an upper punch-supporting member 110A that is<br>
held by a platform 100b via a frame 170 so as to move vertically with respect to the plat form<br>
100b, thereby the upper punch 110 can move vertically in conjunction with the upper punch-<br>
supporting member 110A. The upper punch-supporting member 110A being fixed the upper<br>
punch 110 is vertically driven mechanically by a mechanism (first driving device), for<br>
example, crank mechanism, knuckle press, cam mechanism or the like. The material powder<br>
P filled in the cavity 100a can be compressed by lowering the upper punch 100 down to the<br>
bottom dead point.<br>
[0028]<br>
The lower punch 120 is fixed to a lower punch-supporting member 120A and can<br>
move vertically in conjunction with the lower punch-supporting member 120A by a piston<br>
181 of a hydraulic cylinder 180 (second driving device) fixed to the platform 100b. A filling<br>
amount-adjusting linear scale 161 is attached between the lower punch 120 (lower punch-<br>
supporting member 120 A) and the platform 100b in order to detect the position of the lower<br>
punch 120 from the platform 100b. When a control unit 190 receives detecting signals from<br>
the filling amount-adjusting linear scale 161, the control unit 190 controls the amount of fluid<br>
in the hydraulic cylinder 180 in order to move the piston 181, i.e., the lower punch 120 to a<br>
desired position.<br>
[0029]<br>
The bottom dead point-adjusting linear scale (measuring device) 160 is fixed<br>
between the upper punch supporting member 110A and the lower punch supporting member<br>
120 A, and outputs measured values of the distance between the upper punch supporting<br>
member 110A and the lower punch supporting member 120A, that is, the space between the<br>
upper punch 110 and the lower punch 120 as signals. The control unit 190 which receives the<br>
signals stores previously determined target values, thereby, the control unit 190 controls the<br><br>
13<br>
fluid flow in the hydraulic cylinder 180 to correlate the measured values with the target values.<br>
The target value is set so that the thickness of the cavity 100a becomes the target thickness<br>
between the upper punch 110 and the lower punch 120.<br>
In addition, shoebox position detecting signals are also inputted to the control unit<br>
190. The shoebox position detecting signals are outputted from a shoebox position detecting<br>
sensor (not shown) and show the position of the shoebox 150.<br>
[0030]<br>
Next, a shaping method of the green compact using the powder shaping device 100<br>
having the above structure will be described.<br>
First, the upper punch 110, the lower punch 120 and the die 140 are placed at the<br>
initial predetermined positions, respectively, before the pressure forming.<br>
[Filling Process]<br>
The shoebox 150 is advanced (advancing process) to a position shown in FIG. 5,<br>
under which the cavity 100a exists, and then the material powder P is filled in the cavity 100a.<br>
In this case, the shoebox 150 is advanced from the rear side (right in FIG. 5) to the front side<br>
(left in FIG. 5) so as to be placed at the position shown in FIG. 5, thereby the shoebox 150<br>
opens above the cavity 100a at the rear side first, then at the front side. Therefore, due to the<br>
rear side of the cavity 100a facing the opening of the shoebox 150 for a longer time, the<br>
material powder P is filled into the cavity 100a with a higher density at the rear side.<br>
[0031]<br>
Next, as shown in FIG. 6, while retreating the shoebox 150 from the position, under<br>
which the cavity 100a exists (retreating process), the lower punch 120 is moved up with<br>
respect to the die 140 at the initial stage of the retreating process. That is, when surplus<br>
material powder P existing on the die 140 and the core rod 130 is removed by the front wall<br>
of the shoebox 150 while the shoebox 150 retreats, part of the material powder P filled in the<br><br>
14<br>
rear side of the cavity 100a is pushed up on the die 140 by the lower punch 120 moving up<br>
after the front wall of the shoebox 150 retreats from the front side of the cavity 100a and then<br>
removed by the shoebox 150. Therefore, the amount of the material powder P filled in the<br>
cavity 100a is adjusted at the front and rear sides of the cavity 100a. As a result, the volume<br>
of the material powder P becomes large at the front side of the cavity 100a and small at the<br>
rear side of the cavity 100a.<br>
[0032]<br>
In addition, as shown in FIG. 7, the moved-up lower punch 120 is moved down away<br>
with respect to the die 140 and placed back to the initial position after the shoebox 150 is<br>
retreated from the position, under which the cavity 100a exists, completely. As a result, the<br>
material powder P that was pushed up upper than the die 140 at the front side of the cavity<br>
100a is filled back in the cavity 100a (i.e., the die 140), and thus the material powder P filled<br>
in the cavity 100a is high at the front side and low at the rear side.<br>
[0033]<br>
That is, since the material powder P falls from the shoebox 150 by gravity so as to<br>
fill the cavity 100a, the rear side of the cavity 100a faces the opening of the shoebox 150 for a<br>
longer time, thereby a larger amount of material powder P is filled at the rear side of the<br>
cavity 100a. As a result, when the powder is evenly high throughout the cavity 100a, the rear<br>
side of the cavity 100a is filled with a larger amount of material powder P; therefore the<br>
density of the green compact is not uniform when the material powder P is compressed in<br>
such a state.<br>
Contrary to the above, in the present embodiment, the material powder P is filled<br>
higher at the front side having a low density and lower at the rear side having a high density.<br>
Therefore, the filling amount of the material powder P along the moving direction of the<br><br>
15<br>
shoebox 150 can be balanced, and the material powder P is filled evenly throughout the cavity<br>
100a.<br>
[0034]<br>
[Punch-Driving Process]<br>
FIG. 8 shows a pressure forming process, in which the upper and lower punches are<br>
driven.<br>
(First Driving Process)<br>
First, as shown in FIG. 8(a), the upper punch 110 is moved down to the bottom dead<br>
point (mechanically movable bottom position) while the lower punch 120 is fixed, and then<br>
the material powder P in the cavity 100a is compressed. Even though the upper punch 110 is<br>
designed to move down to the ideal bottom dead point in the device, in practice, it is<br>
impossible to move the upper punch 110 down to the ideal bottom dead point due to the<br>
flexure or the like of the device.<br>
[0035]<br>
The ideal bottom dead point of the upper punch 110 is set at a point, at which the<br>
upper punch 110 and the lower punch 120 fixed to the initial position forms the cavity 100a<br>
therebetween, for example, about 1 mm thicker than the target thickness of the green compact.<br>
That is, the thickness of the cavity 100a is larger than the target thickness even when no<br>
flexure, elongation or the like of the device occurs and the upper punch 110 is moved down to<br>
the ideal bottom dead point; therefore the green compact thinner than the target thickness is<br>
not formed.<br>
[0036]<br>
(Second Driving Process)<br>
Next, as shown in FIG. 8(b), the lower punch 120 is moved up from the initial<br>
position until the thickness of the cavity 100a becomes the target thickness by driving the<br><br>
16<br>
fluid-pressure cylinder 180 while a crank that mechanically drives the upper punch 110 is<br>
stopped and the upper punch 110 is fixed to the bottom dead point. In this case, the lower<br>
punch 120 is moved up by feeding back the measured values measured by the bottom dead<br>
point-adjusting linear scale 160.<br>
[0037]<br>
That is, the control unit 190 controls the amount of fluid in the hydraulic cylinder<br>
180 when receiving the detecting signals from the filling amount-adjusting linear scale 161,<br>
and the space between the punches 110 and 120 is measured by the bottom dead point-<br>
adjusting linear scale 160. Then, the control unit 190 controls and drives the fluid-pressure<br>
cylinder 180 and moves the lower punch 120 up until the measured value reaches the target<br>
thickness.<br>
[0038]<br>
In this case, sometimes, the upper punch 110 is slightly pushed up due to the lower<br>
punch 120 moving up. However, the lower punch 120 is moved up while the measured value<br>
of the space between the punches 110 and 120 is fed back, thereby the shortage of the moving<br>
amount of the upper punch 110 is offset by the lower punch 120 driven until the thickness of<br>
the cavity 100a reaches the target thickness, and thus the thickness of the green compact<br>
reaches the target value.<br>
[0039]<br>
In addition, as shown in FIG. 8(c), the upper punch 110 is moved up, and the core<br>
rod 130 and the die 140 are moved down with respect to the lower punch 120 so that the<br>
green compact Zl is removed from the die 140. Furthermore, the lower punch 120 which was<br>
moved up in the second driving process is moved back to the initial position and is set to a<br>
state for forming the next green compact.<br><br>
17<br>
As described above, it is possible to obtain the green compact Zl having the entirely<br>
uniform density and the target thickness.<br>
[0040]<br>
Next, after burning, the green compact Zl is performed a sizing process by a well-<br>
known method and reformed, and then burrs are removed without a surface-grinding process;<br>
thus the inner pump rotor 20 and the outer pump rotor 30 are formed.<br>
[0041]<br>
According to the pump rotors 20 and 30 of the present embodiment described above,<br>
since at least the outer circumferential surface 30b of the outer pump rotor 30 and the end<br>
surfaces of the rotors 20 and 30 in the direction of the rotation axes 01 and 02, which are<br>
contact with the inner surface 50a of the casing 50 when the internal gear pump 10 is<br>
activated, are non-grinded surface having the ten point height of irregularities Rz not less than<br>
4 m and not more than 10 m, part of the fluid pumped in to the inside of the pump during<br>
the activation can be retained at the outer circumferential surface 30b and the end surfaces 20a<br>
and 30a even when the internal gear pump 10 is stopped after the activation.<br>
[0042]<br>
That is, when the internal gear pump 10 is stopped, part of the fluid B2 can be<br>
retained at fine holes Bl which open at the non-grinded surfaces, that is, part of the fluid B2<br>
can be soaked into the surface portions of the outer circumferential surface 30b and the end<br>
surfaces 20a and 30a as shown in FIG. 4(a). Therefore, the part of the fluid B2 exudes from<br>
the holes Bl and can act as lubricant oil between the inner surface 50a of the casing 50 and<br>
the outer circumferential surface 30b of the outer pump rotor 30, and the inner surface 50a of<br>
the casing 50 and the end surfaces 20a and 30a of the rotors 20 and 30 when the internal gear<br>
pump 10 is reactivated, and thus the anti-galling of the pump rotors 20 and 30 can be<br>
improved.<br><br>
18<br>
[0043]<br>
On the contrary, when the outer circumferential surface 30b and the end surfaces 20a<br>
and 30a are grinded, the ten point height of irregularities Rz decreases to be about 0.8 m ore<br>
more to about 3.2 m or less, and the holes B1 on the surfaces 30b, 20a and 30a, which open<br>
before the grinding process, are closed as shown in FIG. 4(b), and the volume of the holes B1<br>
decrease. Therefore, it becomes difficult to retain the part of the fluid B2 and to have an<br>
improved anti-galling like the present embodiment shown in FIG. 4(a).<br>
[0044]<br>
In addition, in the present embodiment, since the rotors 20 and 30 are formed from a<br>
sintered material of Fe-Cu-C and have a density of not less than 6.6 g/cm3 and not more than<br>
7.1 g/cm3 , the breaking strength and the surface durability of the rotors 20 and 30 can be<br>
secured to the necessary minimum, and the intersecting ridge portions 20c and 30c of the<br>
rotors 20 and 30 are crushed during the sizing process, thereby the chamfering amount of the<br>
ridge portions 20c and 30c can be decreased. As a result, it is possible to suppress the leakage<br>
of the fluid in the cells C to a gap between the end surfaces 20a and 30a and the inner surface<br>
50a of the casing 50 from the intersecting ridge portions 20c and 30c when the internal gear<br>
pump 10 is activated and, thus, to make the cells C divided by the intersecting ridge portions<br>
20c and 30c, the gear tooth surfaces, and the inner surface 50a of the casing 50 have high<br>
liquid-tightness.<br>
[0045]<br>
Particularly, in the present embodiment, since the intersecting ridge portions 20c and<br>
30c are not chamfered during the sizing process, and the rising amount Y in the direction of<br>
the rotation axes O1 and O2 from the end surfaces 20a and 30a becomes 0.01 mm or less and<br>
the protruding amount Z in the radius direction from the gear tooth surfaces becomes 0.05<br>
mm or less, the intersecting ridge portions 20c and 30c can be in contact with the inner<br><br>
19<br>
surface 50a of the casing 50 in the internal gear pump 10. As a result, the cells C are divided<br>
by the intersecting ridge portions 20c and 30c, the gear tooth surfaces, and the inner surface<br>
50a of the casing 50, thereby it is possible to make the cells C have high light-tightness and to<br>
suppress the leakage of the fluid from inside of the cells C to the gap between the end surfaces<br>
20a and 30a and the inner surface 50a of the casing 50 when the internal gear pump 10 is<br>
activated. Therefore, the fluid-carrying performance of the internal gear pump 10 can be<br>
improved.<br>
[0046]<br>
Furthermore, since the rising amount Y is set in the above range, the intersecting<br>
ridge portions 20c and 30c of the end surfaces 20a and 30a are in contact with the inner<br>
surface 50a of the casing, partial wear does not easily occur on the inner surface 50a,<br>
therefore, the lifespan of the internal gear pump 10 is rarely shortened as a result of the partial<br>
wear.<br>
[0047]<br>
Still furthermore, since the protruding amount Z is set in the above range, the<br>
intermediate portions of the rotors in the thickness direction can be prevented from not<br>
contacting with each other when the gears mesh with each other, while the intersecting ridge<br>
portions are in contact with each other. Therefore, the respective cells can be assuredly<br>
divided in the circumferential direction, and the fluid-carrying performance of the pump<br>
rarely deteriorates.<br>
[0048]<br>
Still furthermore, in the present embodiment, since the rotors 20 and 30 are formed<br>
from the green compact Z1 formed by the powder-shaping device 100 shown in FIGS. 5 to 8,<br>
the precision of the size, that is, the thickness of the rotors 20 and 30 in the direction of the<br>
rotation axes O1 and O2 rarely deteriorates even when no grinding process is performed on<br><br>
20<br>
the end surfaces 20a and 30a after the sizing process. Therefore, it is possible to exclude the<br>
grinding process from the fabrication process of the rotors 20 and 30 and to form the rotors 20<br>
and 30 having the improved anti-galling efficiently with no deterioration of the precision.<br>
[0049]<br>
Among the above effects, the anti-galling of the pump rotors was tested for<br>
verification.<br>
The test pieces for this test were formed from sintered material of Fe-C-Cu<br>
containing at least 1.5 to 2.5% by weight of Cu and 0.6 to 0.75% by weight of C, and formed<br>
into disc-shape. These test pieces were processed by one of two processes (i.e., one is<br>
processed by grinding them after the sizing process, while the other is not processed by<br>
grinding after the sizing process). Five test pieces having different density and surface<br>
roughness Rz are prepared in the respective types (total of 10 examples).<br>
The anti-galling load was measured for the respective test pieces. Herein, the anti-<br>
galling load was measured as follows: the test piece was disposed on the surface of a plate-<br>
shape test material (surface roughness 3.2 Rz) made of a FC material and then rotated around<br>
an axis thereof at the circumferential speed of about 3.1 m/s while a lubricant oil was supplied<br>
between the contacting surfaces of the test piece and the test material. At this process, loads<br>
were applied to the test piece step by step in the thickness direction, and a load was measured<br>
when a galling was generated on the contacting surface of the test piece. After that, the load<br>
was divided by the area of the contacting surface of the test piece.<br>
[0050]<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates the result. It was verified from the result that the anti-galling load<br>
can be improved if the test piece had the density of not less than 6.6 g/cm3 and not more than<br>
7.1 g/cm3and the ten point height of irregularities Rz of not less than 4 urn and not more than<br>
10 m.<br><br>
21<br>
[0051]<br>
Meanwhile, the technical scope of the present invention is not limited to the above<br>
embodiment, and can be modified in various manners within the spirit and scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
For example, the numbers of the outer gear teeth 21 and the inner gear teeth 31 are<br>
not limited to that of the above embodiment. Furthermore, even though the intersecting ridge<br>
portions 20c and 30c protrude with curved surfaces respectively in the above embodiment, the<br>
intersecting ridge portions 20c and 30c can be chamfered during the sizing process if the C<br>
(chamfering amount) is 0.2 mm or less.<br>
[0052]<br>
In addition, the powder-shaping device 100 can employ the following construction<br>
instead of the construction shown in FIGS. 5 to 8.<br>
The construction of a CNC press device 201 will be described with reference to FIG.<br>
10. The CNC press device 201 shown in FIG. 10 includes a die 205 having a cavity 200a, in<br>
which the material powder P is filled, an upper punch 208 and a lower punch 209. The die<br>
205 and the upper punch 208 moves up and down respectively, and the lower punch 209 is<br>
fixed.<br>
[0053]<br>
The die 205 is fixed to a lower slider 203 that slides in a lower guide 202 through a<br>
lower ram 204 and moved up and down by the driving of a driving unit (not shown) such as<br>
ball screw mechanism or the like. The lower punch 209 fixed to a fixing plate 213 is disposed<br>
under the die 205 and fitted into the cavity 200a from the bottom.<br>
[0054]<br>
The upper punch 208 capable of entering the cavity 200a is disposed above the lower<br>
punch 209 while facing and coaxially with the lower punch 209. The upper punch 208 is<br><br>
22<br>
attached to an upper guide 210 that slides in an upper slider 206 through an upper ram 207<br>
including an oil hydraulic piston 222 to which an upper punch plate 223 is fixed to and an oil<br>
hydraulic cylinder 221. The upper slider 206 is coupled to a crank shaft 212 rotated by a<br>
driving motor M (first driving device) through a link mechanism 211. The driving motor M is<br>
a servo motor that is driven or stopped according to a program stored in a computer (control<br>
unit) 220.<br>
[0055]<br>
The upper ram 207 includes the oil hydraulic cylinder 221 fixed to the upper guide<br>
210 and the oil hydraulic piston 222 attached to the upper punch plate 223. An oil hydraulic<br>
supplying hole 221a is provided at the oil hydraulic cylinder 221, and hydraulic pressure is<br>
supplied from an oil hydraulic unit 226 (second driving device) through a hydraulic supplying<br>
pipe 225 connected to the oil hydraulic supplying hole 221a. Using a hydraulic servo valve<br>
224 provided at the hydraulic supplying pipe 225 and driven by the computer 220, hydraulic<br>
control is performed.<br>
That is, the upper ram 207 is driven up and down as a whole by the driving motor<br>
(first driving device) M, and the oil hydraulic piston 222 is driven up and down by the oil<br>
hydraulic unit (second driving device) 226.<br>
[0056]<br>
In addition, the device 201 includes a linear scale (measuring unit) 214 between the<br>
upper punch plate 223, to which the upper punch 208 is fixed, and the fixing plate 213, to<br>
which the lower punch 209 is fixed, in order to measure the space between the upper punch<br>
plate 223 and the fixing plate 213. The measured value of the linear scale 214 is transmitted<br>
to the computer 220, and then the computer 22 calculates and outputs the driving signals of<br>
driving motor M and hydraulic servo valve 224 on the basis of the measured values.<br>
[0057]<br><br>
23<br>
The fabricating method of the green compact using the CNC press device 201 having<br>
the above construction will be described.<br>
[Punch Driving Process]<br>
The upper punch 208, the lower punch 209 and the die 205 are disposed at the initial<br>
predetermined positions before the pressure forming.<br>
[0058]<br>
(First Driving Process)<br>
The upper ram 207 is moved down to the bottom dead point (mechanically movable<br>
bottom position) while the lower punch 209 and the die 205 are fixed, and then the cavity<br>
200a in which the material powder P filled is closed.<br>
[0059]<br>
(Second Driving Process)<br>
When the angle of the crank reaches 180°, at which the upper ram 207 reaches the<br>
bottom dead point, the driving motor M that mechanically drives the upper ram 207 is stopped<br>
by the computer 220, and then the upper punch 208 stops moving down along with the upper<br>
ram 207. In addition, the hydraulic servo valve 224 is driven as the upper ram 207 stops, and<br>
the oil hydraulic cylinder 221 is supplied with hydraulic pressure until the measured value of<br>
the linear scale 214 reaches the set value (the value when the thickness of the cavity 200a<br>
reaches the target value) in order to move down the oil hydraulic piston 222, that is, the upper<br>
punch 208 is moved down. Furthermore, the die 205 is moved down half as much as the<br>
lowering-stroke of the upper punch 208 as the upper punch 208 is moved down by hydraulic,<br>
thereby the material powder P in the cavity 200a is pressed from top and bottom, supplied<br>
uniform pressure, and compressed so as to have a vertically uniform density.<br>
