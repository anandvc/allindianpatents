				<td>This invention relates to mixing apparatus and, in particular, to mixing apparatus<br>
whereby food product can be mixed prior to consumption.<br>
It has been proposed to provide mixing apparatus, more particularly blending apparatus,<br>
in which a container of product fitted with a lid is blended by blending apparatus within<br>
the container.<br>
The present invention is intended to provide improved apparatus for mixing food<br>
products and which is specially adapted to be cost effective and sufficient for one trip<br>
use.<br>
According to the invention mere is provided mixing apparatus comprising a container<br>
base and a container lid, the container lid having mounted thereon mixing means, the<br>
mixing means extending through the lid and having, at one end, means for connection<br>
to a drive motor external to the container and, at the other end, a mixing element for<br>
mixing the contents of the container when the drive means is operated, the mixing<br>
means comprising a shaft portion looatable through an opening in the lid and<br>
incorporating the connection means, and a mixing element portion associated with the<br>
shaft portion for rotation therewith, the container lid comprising a rim portion defining<br>
a circumferential slot into which the top edge of the container is located when the lid<br>
and container are assembled.<br>
Preferably the container lid rim portion is formed with successive, oppositely-directed<br>
circumferential portions, one of the portions lying closely adjacent to the inner side<br>
wall of the container when the lid and container are assembled, and defining one side of<br>
the slot, and extending into the container.<br>
Conveniently the other of said circumferential portions is spaced inwardly of the side<br>
wall and has a curvilinear join with said one portion.<br>
In one arrangement the circumferential slot is defined by an outer portion arranged to<br>
extend around the outer top edge of the container, and an inner portion arranged to<br>
extend into the container and the inner portion extends over a greater distance than the<br>
outer portion in the axial direction of the container, such distance being between twice<br>
and six times said distance.<br>
In one arrangement, the mixing element portion incllides an opening through which the<br>
shaft portion is located to lock into said opening.<br>
The mixing means is assembled on to the lid, the shaft portion being first inserted<br>
through one end of the lid opening, and men the mixing element portion is locked onto<br>
the shaft portion at the opposite end of the shaft.<br>
It is also possible to have one piece mixing means which is assembled with the lid as<br>
one piece.<br>
Preferably the mixing portion clips onto the shaft portion and is secured thereto by<br>
shoulder means on the shaft portion. The mixing and shaft portions may be united by<br>
welding them together.<br>
The apparatus may comprise a support for an assembled container and lid with the lid<br>
located on the support, and a clamping member movable to engage the end of the<br>
container opposite the lid and locate the assembly during operation of the mixing means<br>
in which the clamping member is reciprocally movable and, upon contacting the<br>
container to clamp the assembly, applies a predetermined force to the container in the<br>
direction towards the support<br>
In one arrangement the clamping member is connected to a fixed member through<br>
spring means and, upon the clamping force exceeding a predetermined level, the spring<br>
means compresses and a signal is generated to stop movement of the imping member,<br>
m such arrangement the clamping member may incllide a clamping surface engageable<br>
with the container and extending beyond the side edges of the container and comprising<br>
switch means for detecting an obstruction to a clamping action.<br>
Conveniently, the container lid is nestable or stackable with other container lids, one<br>
being located inside the other.<br>
Container lids assembled with the mixing means are also, preferably, arranged to be<br>
stackable or nestable.<br>
Lubrication, and/or cooling means may be provided to permit the contents of the<br>
container, during mixing, to contact and lubricate and/or cool the co-operating surfaces<br>
of the shank portion and the opening into the lid. Such lubricating means may incllide<br>
longitlidinal slots in the side walls of the opening which constitute a sleeve.<br>
A container lid may incllide a product access opening with closure means so that, after<br>
completing a mixing operation, the opening is openable to access the contents.<br>
The container lid may incllide holding means for holding product arranged to be mixed<br>
with the material in the container before, during or after operation of the mixing means.<br>
The holding means may incllide a pocket having an opening for introducing the product<br>
into the pocket.<br>
The pocket may have mesh means for permitting product in the container to enter into<br>
the pocket<br>
The pocket may be arranged to contain carbonation means for carbonating product in<br>
the container. Alternatively or in addition the pocket may contain flavour or other<br>
additives for the product<br>

Fig. 15 is a vertical section through blending apparatus, and<br>
Fig. 16 is a vertical section through other blending apparatus.<br>
Referring to the drawings and firstly Figs. 1-3, there is shown three versions of<br>
mixing apparatus of which each comprises common elements inclliding a container or<br>
container base 10, usually in the form of a paper cup tapering inwardly towards the<br>
lower end 10A and having towards the upper end a rolled lip 10B. Instead of the<br>
container 10 being formed of paper, it may be of plastics, for example of injection<br>
moulded plastics.<br>
In use, the container is assembled with a lid 12 with a turned over peripheral edge 13<br>
which is fitted over the lip or rim 10B and carries assembled therewith a blending<br>
element 14 arranged for rotation relative to the lid 12.<br>
The blending element 14 is rotated by a drive motor 40 having an upwardly directed<br>
drive shaft 41 arranged to engage with the blending element 14 for driving engagement<br>
during me blending operation.<br>
In Figs. 1 - 3, the container 10 and assembled blending element 15 with lid 12 are<br>
shown inverted in a position in which product within the container is blended. In this<br>
position, the container is inverted with the lid 12 lowermost and the assembly is<br>
supported on an annular supporting member 42 which locates under the outer edge of<br>
the lid 12.<br>
The container 10 is supported and seated in a tapered seating or holder 43 which is<br>
tspered to the outer shape of the container 10 and extends towards me upper end of the<br>
container so mat the upper edge of the holder 43 engages under the container lip 10B.<br>
This arrangement of holder 43, shaped seating 42 and the upper edge of flu lid 12<br>
ensures in each case that the seal between the lid and the container is maintained<br>
through all stages of the operation of the blending apparatus, inclliding when the<br>
container is inverted, and when the blender is operating prior to blending, the container<br>
is located in the holder when upright or inclined towards the user.<br>
Usually the holder 43 is initially in an upright or vertically inclined position with its<br>
wider end uppermost The container 10 is located in the holder by dropping the<br>
assembled container and lid into the holder. The holder is then inverted to the position<br>
shown in which the lid is located onto the support 42 with the blending element 14<br>
located over the drive motor 40. A downwards clamping force P is usually applied to<br>
the holder 43 to maintain it in its inverted position ready for a blending operation. The<br>
motor 40 is operated and the drive shaft 41 engages the blending element 14 through an<br>
opening 20 directed outwards from the lid 12. Rotation of the drive 41 causes the<br>
blending element 14 to rotate within product located within the container 10. This<br>
action blends the product or otherwise mixes it to ensure that it is adequately mixed or<br>
blended within the container.<br>
When the mixing action has taken place for the required length of time, the clamping<br>
force F is released, the  drive shaft 41 is disengaged from the blending element 14 and<br>
the cup holder with the container therein is removed from the support 42, inverted and<br>
released from the holder 43 and the product within the container is ready for<br>
consumption. As thus for described it is assumed that the contents of the container to<br>
be blended are at the temperature and consistency required but, if necessary, the<br>
contents may be heated or cooled prior to the blending operation. In the case of product<br>
which needs to be heated, mis may be achieved by directing microwave radiation at<br>
product within the container prior to or when in situ on the blending apparatus.<br>
It will be seen mat the embodiments of Figs. 1, 2 and 3 differ from each other<br>
primarily in the shape of the lid 12. Thus in the case of the Fig. 1 embodiment, the lid<br>
12 is generally planar lying generally at a right-angle to the central axis of the<br>
container. The lid 12 is formed with a central circular opening 11 defined by<br>
downwardly, axially projecting members 13 flanked by a depression 15.<br>
In Fig. 2, the lid 12 is of more complex form, although still having an outer rim 13 and<br>
a central opening 11. In Fig. 2, the lid is formed with a part spherical central portion<br>
12A in the middle of which is the opening 11, and the outer edge of the spherioal<br>
portion 12A is turned through approximately 180 degrees to form an outer portion 12B<br>
in alignment with and closely adjacent the inner walls of the container 10 towards the<br>
upper edge thereof. The semi-spherical portion 12A, as shown has a tangential portion<br>
12C and the transition between the portions 12C and 12B is through right-angle bends<br>
at 12D. Alternatively, the bends 12D may be replaced by a curvilinear transition.<br>
It will be seen that the portion 12D is below the level of the upper end of the container<br>
and that the semi-spherical portion 12A projects above the upper edge of the container<br>
and the portion 12A may provide a transparent region through which the internal part of<br>
the container may be viewed. It will also be noted that the region in which the blending<br>
element 14 is operated, when in the inverted position, as shown, is a partial sphere<br>
which assists in ensuring an efficient blending operation of product in the container.<br>
The edge of the container opening is located between portions 12B and 13 of the lid<br>
which together define a circumferential slot, the radially inner side of which extends<br>
along the inner wall of the container and in contact therewith.<br>
The arrangement of Fig. 3 shows a farther alternative form of lid 12, somewhat similar<br>
to the lid 12 of Fig. 2 but in which the part semi-spherical portion 12A is of reduced<br>
dimensions so that the upper end of the portion 12A lies substantially level with the<br>
upper end of the container 10.<br>
The arrangement of Fig. 3 still provides a region in which the blender 14 operates<br>
which has curved lower surfaces to assist in ensuring an adequate blending action, and<br>
the lid may be of transparent material<br>
The embodiments of Figs. 2 and 3 are particularly useful in ensuring a good seating of<br>
the lid 12 on the container 10 to reduce the possibility of any leakage or unseating of<br>
the lid from the container. One way in which this is achieved is for the portion 12B of<br>
the lid 12 to extend along the inner side walls of the upper end of the container giving<br>
excellent sealing qualities and a seating within the container.  This arrangement also<br>
permits a minimal loss of capacity of the container and this can be overcome by<br>
allowing the portion 12A of the lid of the container to project beyond the upper end of<br>
the  container. The use of a cup holder 43 further assists in maintaining a seal between<br>
the rim 10B and the lid 12, as shown enlarged in Figs.   1, 2 and 3.  Details of the<br>
construction of the blender 14 and its associated lid are as described in relation to the<br>
later described embodiments.  The extent to which the portion 12B extends into the<br>
container can be varied in obtaining an adequate seal   It is preferred that the axial<br>
extent of the portion 12B be between two and twelve times the depth of the outturned<br>
edge 13. That is (Fig. 8A) Y-between 2X and 12X<br>
Referring now to Figs. 4-7, there is shown a lid 12 and associated blending element<br>
14 of which similar parts are given the same reference numerals as in the preceding<br>
embodiment. The blending element 14 is of one piece construction and has a shaft 16<br>
at one end of which is an outwardly projecting lip 19. At the other end of the shaft 16<br>
is located a set of blending blades 17 which extend generally radially outwards from the<br>
axis.<br>
The shaft 16 is located into a central opening in the lid 12 and around the opening,<br>
integral with the lid, are formed arcuate, axially-directed dementi 30 which are<br>
circumferentially spaced from one another to leave gaps 31. Along each edge of each<br>
element 30 there is formed an angled surface 32 and by provision of the gaps 3 land me<br>
angled surfaces 32 mere is provided means for admitting product within the container<br>
during blending into the small space between the shaft 16 and the elements 30. By this<br>
means the outer surface of the shaft is lubricated and cooled. This may be necessary<br>
since the blending element 14 can be rotated at high speed during a blending operation<br>
and the shaft 16 is of relatively large diameter to provide structural strength to the<br>
element 14. If product being blended is cold and the blending process is short, such<br>
lubrication may not be necessary but lubrication is desirable. Since the container is<br>
normally inverted during blending, the blending element 14 is immersed in the product<br>
and product gains access to the outer surface of the shaft 14. Such product provides a<br>
film of lubricant/coolant between the shaft and the element 30.<br>
The shaft 16 is located in the opening by applying axially directed preesure while<br>
entering the shaft 16 into the opening and when the lip 19 has extended through the<br>
opening it locates into a recess at the outer end of the opening to secure the blending<br>
element to the lid. The outer end of the element 14 is formed with an internal<br>
depression and shape, as at 20, to enable the drive shaft 41 to enter and fully engage in<br>
the opening 20 and drive the blending element 14 during a blending operation. The<br>
fitting of the shaft 41 in the opening is intended to bring about a strong connection<br>
during vigorous blending, which may incllide blending ice cream.<br>
In the arrangement of Figs 4 - 7, the outer rim 13 of the lid is formed with slits 34<br>
extending in a generally axial direction from the rim 14 towards the top of lid. Such<br>
slits 34 assist in locating the lid on the container, the rim being able to be flexed<br>
outwards during such engagement This may be of particular importance when the<br>
container is made from paper/cardboard. This arrangement also has application when<br>
the lid 1b arranged to be fitted to containers which are of slightly different sizes since<br>
the flexibility provided by the slits permits the lid to be fitted to different size<br>
containers with different size rims. The slits may have a width of some 1 mm and<br>
extend to closely adjacent the inner edge of the rim.<br>
Referring now to the lid assembly of Figs. 8-10, the same reference numbers are used<br>
for similar parts to these of the previous embodiments and the lid assembly of Figs. 8 -<br>
10 corresponds with that of Fig. 3. It will be seen that the blender element is, in mis<br>
case, formed of two portions (see in particular Fig. 10) of which one portion 14A is<br>
termed a shaft portion and the other portion 14B is termed a blade portion.The shaft<br>
portion 14A is formed with a cylindrical portion 50 which is located within the opening<br>
in the lid defined by the elements 30 which together define bearing surfaces for the<br>
blending element 14. At one end of the cylindrical portion SO is a flange 51 which<br>
locates in the depression 15 formed around the central opening in the lid to thereby<br>
secure the blending element at one end thereof.<br>
The portion 14A has a further cylindrical part 52 about which is located the bladed<br>
portion 14B of the element in use. Intermediate the portions 50 and 52 is provided a<br>
portion 54 in which can be seated the bladed portion 14B, when assembled.<br>
In practice, the shaft portion 14A is inserted into the opening in the lid, men from the<br>
opposite side of the lid is introduced the bladed portion 14B having a central opening<br>
56 into which is inserted the portion 52. The bladed portion 14B is then pushed over<br>
the shaft portion 14A to locate the two portions together and the portions are men<br>
locked in position by engaging the inner edge of the opening 56 into a groove on the<br>
portion 54 or a shoulder is provided on the portion 52 over which the bladed portion 42<br>
is located to prevent release.<br>
With this arrangement, the two portions 14A and 14B are locked together as one, after<br>
fitting to the lid 12 and are rotatable relative to the lid within the opening to enable the<br>
blending action to be performed.<br>
The outer side of the blending element 14 lies flush with the upper surface of the lid to<br>
provide a neat appearance and, once assembled, the lids and blending elements sre<br>
nestable together for transportation purposes, as seen in Fig. 11.   To assist in such<br>
nesting together, there is provided lugs 56 against which the portions 12D of the lid are<br>
arranged to engage.<br>
In order to provide tor easy access to product to be consumed from the container 10, the<br>
lid is provided with an opening 58 displaced to one side of the central axis and having<br>
to the upper open side a closure member 60 which locates into the aperture 58 and is<br>
hinged at 62 to enable the closure 60 to be opened and closed acoording to the<br>
requirements of the user.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 11, there is shown a series of lids of the kind illustrated in Figs.<br>
8-9 which have been nested together after manufacture and assembly of the blending<br>
elements with the lids. The same reference numerals are used in relation to the same<br>
parts. It will be seen that the portions 12D locate in the gap between the portions 12C<br>
and 12B on an adjacent lid but me portion 12D engages up against lugs 56 whereby the<br>
lids may be readily denested from one another. However it is not essential mat the lids<br>
be nestable.<br>
The shaft portions 52 of the blending elements locate within the opening at the drive<br>
shaft end of the blending element when nested together. Flat portions of the blades 17<br>
of the blending element 14 rest against the upper surface of the lids at 12B to assist in<br>
enabling the lids to be nested and denested.<br>
This nesting facility permits the assembled lids and blending elements to be transported<br>
occupying limited volume to a location where the lids are to be assembled on to the<br>
container bases.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 12, mere is shown a detailed view of part of a lid similar to mat<br>
of Figs. 8 - 9 in which there is formed in the upper side of the lid in the region 12B a<br>
pocket 60 depending downwardly into the container and having opening 62 in the side<br>
walls giving access into the pocket from within the container. Towards the outer side<br>
of the pocket 60 is formed an opening 64 giving access into the pocket for a holder 66<br>
which is shaped to be a close fit within the pocket 60, sealing the openings 62 and<br>
preventing product from passing out of the pocket 60 to the outside of the container.<br>
The holder 66 may contain any additive which is required to make to the product during<br>
mixing but, in particular, additives which when contacted by the products within the<br>
container will react with me product to create a desired effect In one arrangement the<br>
holder 66 contains material which when contacted by the product will carbonate the<br>
contents of me container. Such carbonation will commence when product in the<br>
container reaches the opening 62 and enters the holder 66. Reaction between the<br>
contents and the carbonation material will set up a carbonation action and tins will take<br>
place when the container is inverted and the contents blended.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 13 an arrangement for a similar purpose to that of Fig. 12 is<br>
provided and the same references are used for similar parts. The arrangement of Fig.<br>
13 primarily differs in that rather than the holder 66 sealing the opening 64, the<br>
equivalent holder 67 of earbonating product is located in a pocket 60 which is provided<br>
with a closure member 68 which seals the opening 64 at the upper end of the pocket 60.<br>
The closure 68 is pivoted towards the side edge 13 of the lid to be moved about me<br>
pivot between an open condition, as shown, and a olosed condition in which the closure<br>
68 has been pivoted into position over the opening 64.<br>
The holder 67 of this embodiment may be in the form of a liquid permeable bag and<br>
arranged so that upon contact by the contents of the container, the carbonation material<br>
is activated to release carbon dioxide into the body of the product<br>
During use of the container and lid assembly various means can be employed to ensure<br>
good fitting together of the units to avoid leakage and ensure integrity of the assembly.<br>
The fitting of the lid onto the container, as described, is intended to ensure this.<br>
Moreover rather than having to rely on the operator, the assembly can, at the filling<br>
location, or, if filling takes place at the dispensing location, be provided with a<br>
clamping mechanism whereby after the  fitting the lid to the container a pressure plate or<br>
other clamp is applied between the ends of the container and lid until a predetermined<br>
pressure has been reached and this pressure is released. The assembly can then be<br>
inverted and the product is ready to be blended.<br>
After fitting the lid to the container the perts may be united by heat sealing or<br>
otherwise.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 14 in which the same reference nombers are given to similar parts<br>
of the previoua embodiments, an alternative form of lid 12 and associated blending<br>
meana is shown. The lid 12 is similar to that shown in Figs. 3, 8 and 9 having an outer<br>
rim 13 which fits over the outer edge of a containar end and an inner portion 12B which<br>
extends into the container in contact with or closely adjacent to the inner wall of the<br>
containg towards its outer edge, the portion 13 and portion 12B defining between them<br>
a circumferential slot into which the open edge of the container is located.<br>
Aa previously described the container lid has an outwardly convex portion 12A, 12B,<br>
which merges with the portion 12B through a turned over portion 12D.<br>
Centrally of the outwardly convex portion 12A, 12B there is provided an opening O<br>
into which is to be located a two part blending means 14. The shaft part 14A of the<br>
blending means 14 has at one end connection means for connecting the blending means<br>
to the motor drive 41 and has a abaft 16 which over its outer surface 50 locates in an<br>
opening 56 in the blending element part 14B.<br>
Assembly of the blending means with the lid 12 is by locating shaft part 14A through<br>
the opening O and through the opening 56 in the part 14B. The surface SO may be<br>
formed with a shoulder to locate with the outer end of the opening 56, or the parts 14A<br>
and 14B may be welded together after assembly. The surface 50 locates with the<br>
surfaces of the opening O to define a bearing surface which is of relatively small<br>
diameter to reduce the potential for the bearing surfaces to overheat<br>
Also formed in the portion 12B of the lid 12 is an opening 58 which is provided ss an<br>
access opening for accessing the contents of the container after blending, for example<br>
through a straw.<br>
To be located over the opening 58 during blending is a removable closure or label 58A<br>
which is adhesively applied to the lid and is peelable therefrom when required.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 15 there is shown an alternative arrangement for supporting an<br>
assembly of container 10 and lid 12 daring a blending operation. The assembled<br>
container 10 and lid 12 are located inverted on a support 42 of a housing for the drive<br>
motor, as previously described.<br>
Located above the assembly in the blending position is a clamping arrangement 75<br>
inclliding a reciprocal container engagement member 77 carried an the lower end of an<br>
actuator 78 which is in turn driven by an actuator motor 80 to move up and down<br>
towards and away from the container.<br>
The clamping assembly is mounted on a rigid mounting bracket 82 for movement<br>
relative thereto through a compression spring 84, the assembly being movably<br>
supported by a support bolt 86. Movement of the assembly towards me bracket 82 is<br>
against the resistance of the compression spring 84 and mere is also provided a switch<br>
88 which detects movement of the actuator relative to the bracket 82 against the action<br>
of the spring 84.<br>
The clamping member 77 is arranged to engage the narrow end of the container 10 to<br>
clamp it into position during blending and as the central portion 77A which ia shaped to<br>
match the cross-section of the container to be engaged. Bxtending around the central<br>
area 77A is a safety ring 88 in the form of an annular ring movable rotative to the<br>
member 77 against spring means 77B. Movement of the ring 88 against the spring<br>
means is detected by a switch 79 which, when actuated, stops movement of the actuator<br>
78 and actuator motor 80. This arrangement ensures mat obstructions between the<br>
member 77 and the container, such as an operator's fingers, are detected to stop<br>
operation of the clamping arrangement<br>
In operation of the clamping assembly of Fig. 15 after an assembly of container and lid<br>
hss been placed on the support 42, the actuator motor is actuated to cause the clamping<br>
member 77 to move downwards into engagement with the end of the container. A<br>
predetermined pressure is applied to the end of the container to bring about a clamping<br>
action between the support 42 and the clamping member 77 and between the lid 12 and<br>
the container 10. This ensures that the assembly of container and lid is adequately<br>
made and support is sufficient during the blending operation. Due to the way in which<br>
the clamping arrangement is supported at its upper end there is detected a<br>
predetermined pressure on the container through movement relative to the bracket 22<br>
which is detected by the switch 88 which is irrespective of the size of the container so<br>
the container can have an axial dimension at positions P1 or P2 or at any positions in<br>
between. Whatever the size of the container, as soon as the predetermined clamping<br>
pressure has been reached the clamping operation is complete and there is no further<br>
movement of the clamping member.<br>
It will be appreciated that the blending apparatus can be programmed to operate<br>
according to the size of container used and the  contents of the container which may<br>
require different blending times. As described blending apparatus detects the size of<br>
container which may also determine the blending duration. However, in addition, the<br>
operator can set the blending duration through the operator controls.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 16 there is shown blending apparatus in which the same reference<br>
numbers are, again, given to parts similar to those of previous embodiments. The<br>
apparatus shown in Fig. 16 incllides a container 10 and a combined lid 12 and blending<br>
means 14 which are of similar form to those shown in Fig. 3 and others of the drawings.<br>
The assembled containers and lid are inverted for a blending operation to the position<br>
shown and such inversion can be done manually or by locating the containers 10 in a<br>
holder 43 shaped to the external shape of me container 10.<br>
The holder 43 may be rotatable about axis A-A from an upright position in which the <br>
container is located into the  holder, to an inverted position in which the blending means<br>
14 it placed in driving engagement with the  drive motor 40 for a blending operation.<br>
The container 10 is generally made of stiff coated paper or card which is formed with<br>
an overlapped portion running in the lengthwise direction of the container. This<br>
construction can result in potential problems with leakage between the lid and the<br>
inside wall of the container where the overlap occurs.<br>
In order to mitigate any potential leakage there is provided a clamping arrangement<br>
whereby the outer surface of the container adjacent the lid has applied to it inwardly<br>
directed clamping forces to assist in sealing the inner surface of the container against<br>
the inwardly directed portion of the lid which locates against said inner surface.<br>
In the illustrated arrangement clamping is by providing an air chamber 90 extending<br>
around the outside of the container 10 towards its wide end and having a radially inner<br>
flexible wall 92 which is arranged to contact the outer wall of the container so that<br>
when the chamber 90 has compressed gas admitted the wall 92 is caused to extend<br>
radially inwards against the container wall. It compresses against the wall to seal the<br>
wall against the lid and thereby seal against any leaks.<br>
To assist in the sealing action, there may be inserted into lid over the outwardly<br>
directed circumferential opening extending around the lid portion 12C, a circular<br>
abutment member 94. Thus, as the wall 92 filled with compressed gas to expand<br>
inwardly against the container wall, abutment member 94 acts as an abutment to resist<br>
such movement and act to assist as a seal.<br>
Compressed gas to the chamber 90 is supplied by a suitable compressor through an<br>
inlet tube 96 and the tube 96 and chamber 90 are incorporated into the holder 43 which<br>
holder is directed downwardly to hold the assembly onto me base 42 during blending,<br>
as shown by the arrows F.<br>
The chamber 90 is inflated or charged wim gas at the commencement of the container<br>
inversion action and, upon completion of the blending, me tube is deflated so that the<br>
container with its blending contents can be removed from the holder 43.<br>
Air to the chamber 90 may be ducted through tube 98 from an inlet 99 tying along the<br>
axis A so that the air can be ducted before and during blending and whilst the holder is<br>
rotated.<br>
Instead of using the inflated ring arrangement shown in Fig. 16, a mechanical clamping<br>
arrangement can be used whereby a metal ring (not ahown) in me position of chamber<br>
90 extendi around me container and is moved radially in and out to clamp the<br>
container.<br>
Usually clamping around the container will be needed before the container is inverted,<br>
during blending, and until the container is upright again.<br>
