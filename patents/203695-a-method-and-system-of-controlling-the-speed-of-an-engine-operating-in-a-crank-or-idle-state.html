GRANTED<br>

1<br><br>
Field Of Invention<br>
This invention relates to a method for disabling an internal combustion     engine of a vehicle suffering an engine speed runaway condition.   In particular,    the invention relates to vehicles comprising speed related engaging devices, for example, continuously variable transmissions and. viscous couplings. Background<br>
The application of continuously variable transmissions to vehicles has become more prevalent over recent years, particularly in regard to scooters,     motorcycles,   all-terrain   vehicles   (ATVs)  and   certain   other  small   vehicle applications.    Such vehicles comprising a continuously variable transmission (CVT) are generally relatively simple to operate in that the driver or rider only needs to control throttle or accelerator actuation and not concern themselves with  manual  shifting  between gears as is  required  in  certain  alternative 1|5   arrangements  Broadly speaking, typical CVT arrangements have a threshold engagement speed or speed range at which the engine effectively becomes coupled to the drive-train or wheels of the vehicle.  This threshold engagement speed or speed range is typically set above the idle speed of the engine such that throttle actuation from idle will increase engine speed and subsequently cause 2p    the CVT to engage resulting in vehicle motion.   Accordingly, a CVT may be considered a speed related or speed dependent engagement device.<br>
An alternative type of speed dependent engagement device may be a torque converter of an automatic transmission unit which typically requires engine<br>
speed to reach a certain threshold leve before" the torque converter will enable<br>
   the engine of a vehicle to be coupied to the drive-train thereof. Among the<br>
requirements of such a torque converter are to disengage the engine from the <br>
-driving-wheels,- enable -re-engagement to the-drive-train smoothly and wihout<br>
shock and to allow for variable leverage between the engine and the wheels for<br>
variations in applied load, either as a result of environment or operator input.<br>
	Other forms of speed dependent engagement devices may for example be<br>
defined as such by the presence of viscous couplings or a particular centrifugal clutch arrangement. The common element of such devices is that vehicle motion, is only possible once a certain engine speed threshold has been exceeded. As<br>
2<br>
AMENDED SHEET IPEA/AU<br><br>
wiii be discussed further hereinafter, so-<br>
 me such speed dependent engagement devices may pose the problem that if the speed of the engine were to exceed the threshold speed at a point in time where vehicle motion was not desired, a driver or rider may be caught unawares and nave to act quickly to avoid an accident from ensuing. That is, a certain safely issue may exist which needs to be addressed.<br><br><br>
Upon starting of an engine and providing there is no driver demand on the engine, most engines typically go through a crank phase and an idle phase. This is generally true of a majority of veh- cle engines and not just those which comprise a speed dependent engagement device.    In certain engines, and typically those which are coupled to an automatic transmission comprising a torque converter, engine operation can not begin unless the engine is disengaged from the vehicle drive-train, such as for example when "park" is selected. In other engines, and particularly those comprising a CVT or equivalent type of speed' dependent engagement device, no such requirement may be necessary and the fuel and ignition systems of the engine can be operated by an engine control system during a crank mode to effect initial operation of the engine. Furthermore, whilst certain engine applications comprising a CVT may require that the brake be applied before engine cranking can ocqur, such a relationship between the brake and the ability to crank the engine may not in fact be a function of, or under the control of, the engine control system,<br>
Subsequent to successful commencement of engine operation, the control<br>
system then typically provides for a predetermined idle speed to be established<br>
and maintained during an idle phase of operation:At this point the engine<br>
           throttle is typically closed ana tneengine remains dis-engaged from_the drive<br>
train of the vehicle. As the driver dermand increases from idle, the engine will<br>
  eventually engage the vehicle drive-train through the transmission unit whereafter<br>
engine operation will be dependent upon, amongst other things, the load imposed<br>
by the operator and road conditions,<br>
	During the crank and idle modes of operation, it is normally expected that<br>
the engine speed will not exceed a predetermined threshold level. "This is particularly so in engines fitted with speed dependent-engagement devices where<br>
engagement speed may cause the engine<br>
unexpected attainment of a threshold<br>
3<br>
AMENDED SHEET IPEA/AU<br><br>
to be coupled to the vehicle drive-train resulting in vehicle motion at a time when it Is not desired or expected. Still further, and regardless of the transmission unit to which the engine is coupled, it is normally expected that the engine speed will be below some predetermined threshold level during the crank and idle modes of operation.<br>
If however, as a result of some mechanical or system error the fuel delivery means of the engine fuel system remains fully open or the engine fuel system were for some reason to deliver more fuel than is required during such a crank or idle mode, a significantly higher volume of fuel may be delivered to a combustion chamber of the engine possibly resulting in an undesirable increase in engine speed.   The engine may thus experience a speed "runaway" condition with the engine speed potentially increasing to a level significantly in excess of the normal engine idle speed.    Such a situation is obviously undesirable as a speed "runaway" condition when no load is applied to the engine may result in damage       to the engine. Further, should this coincide with a mechanical failure, prematurely coupling the engine with the vehicle drive-train, the vehicle may lurch forward and even "drive" off.   Not only would this create a significant safety hazard, but the impact ioading to the drive system may also cause significant impact and fatigue damage.<br>
More particularly, and as alluded to hereinbefore, the unexpected attainment of a threshold engagement speed where the engine is coupled to a speed dependent engagement device would result in the engine becoming coupled to the vehicle drive-train resulting in vehicle motion at a point in time during which it would not be expected or desired by the driven order That is in<br>
2p    the case of a scooter-comprising a CVT-mechanism for example, an unexpected-<br>
 increase  engine speed during the crank of idle modes of operation may result<br>
in the CVT becoming engaged to the engine causing subsequent motion of the<br>
scooter.<br>
A similar situation may also arise from a control system error where a          significantly higher fuelling rate than is actually desired is effected, thus causing   . an increase in the engine speed. Consequently, the effect may be the same as   -the aforementioned failure of a fuel delivery means, in that a significantly higher' volume of fuel will be delivered to the combustion chamber. Again, If this results<br>
4<br>
AMENDED SHEET' IPEA/AU<br><br>
in the coupling of the engine to the vehicle drive-train by a speed dependent engagement device or alternatively coincides with a mechanical failure which couples the engine with the vehicle drive-train, such a combination will present a substantia] hazard.<br>
. In controlling such emergency or undesirable situations, a mechanical fail safe system could be incorporated into the drive-train, adding further weight and expense to the entire vehicle system.    For example, such a mechanical emergency system could be focussed on disengaging the engine from the drive train should an engine speed runaway event be evident.   However, in certain        applications, such a rapid disengagement may itself cause damage to the engine or vehicle system perhaps comparable to the damage the runaway event itself may cause. Thus, whilst having means to rapidly terminate a runaway event may be a useful safety feature, certain mechanical systems may themselves raise issues of expense and damage, possibly negating the benefits of including the         safety system.<br>
Statement Of Invention<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to minimize the chances of a<br>
runaway event occurring, as a result of mechanical or system failure, using a<br>
relatively simple and inexpensive means when' compared to the prior art,<br>
	Hence, in one aspect of the invention there is provided a method of<br>
controlling the speed of an engine operating in a crank or idle state, said engine connected to a vehicle drive-train through a speed related engagement device having a predetermined engagement speed or speed range at which the engine becomes coupled to the vehicle drive-train, including the steps of determining   when the ehgine is operating in said crank or idle state; determining whether the engine speed is above an upper threshold speed, and controlling the ehgme<br>
when the engine speed is above the upper threshold speed so as to effect a<br>
reduction in the engine speed to avoid an engine speed runaway event.<br>
Conveniently, the engine is disabled by preventing fuel delivery events to 30   the engine when the engine speed is determined to be outside the predetermined<br>
speed range.<br>
Preferably, the method of controlling the speed of the engine includes disabling all the scheduled events associated with the generation of a combustion .<br>
5<br>
AMENDED SHEET<br>
IPEA/AU<br><br><br><br><br><br>
event In at ieasi one combustion chamber of the engine. The scheduled events associated with the generation" of combustion typically include a fuel delivery event and an ignition event In a single fluid fuel system, fuel metering may   typically take place during the fuel delivery event itself, whilst In a two fluid fuel system, a specific fuel metering event may be scheduled as a separate event to the fuel delivery event. Accordingly, this separate fuel metering event may be one of the scheduled events, which is disabled so as to avoid an engine runaway condition or event. Other suitable methods may also be employed to control or restrict the engine speed in order to prevent an engine speed runaway condition.<br>
Whilst disengaging the engine from the vehicle drive-train has the potential to cause harm to the engine and the drive-train, if the engine itself can be disabled it will have the same effect as a stall situation and thus have little or no detrimental effect on the vehicle system whilst still preventing a foreshadowed hazard caused by the speed runaway event.<br>
Preferably, said engine is connected to a vehicle drive-train through a speed related engagement device. As mentioned hereinbefore, such speed related engagement devices typically have a predetermined engagement speed or speed range at which the engine becomes coupled to the vehicle drive-train. Conveniently, the predetermined speed range outside of which the engine is disabled is selected such that an upper threshold speed is below the engagement speed of the speed dependent engagement device. In this way, if the engine speed were to unexpectedly increase during the crank or idle state, coupling of the engine to the vehicle drive-train would not occur as the predetermined engagement speed of the speed dependent engagement device would not-be<br><br>
     attained-by-the-engine: That is, the-combustion-related events-such-as-fuel<br>
metering,   fuel   delivery  and/or   ignition   would   be   disabled   prior  to the<br>
predetermind engagement speed being attained, hence causing the engine to cease operation.<br>
Conveniently, an engine management control system arranged to control       engine operation may determine the speed of the engine and compare this with the predetermined engagement speed for the device such that the engine can be  disabled prior to this engagement speed.being attained.<br>
6<br>
"AMENDED SHEET IPEA/AU<br><br>
As part of the engine management control system, there is typically<br>
encoded ideal ranges within which the engine speed during the crank or idle state<br>
would be expected to fall. The control system will thus react to an engine speed<br>
falling outside these ranges by disabling the engine. The present invention is<br>
targeted at those instances where, through mechanical or system failure, the<br>
engine speed is caused to increase such that it exceeds the pre-determined<br>
ranges or limits. Accordingly, in this embodiment of the invention, when a<br>
maximum upper limit is reached or exceeded, the present invention provides<br>
means to disable the engine so as to prevent an engine speed runaway event.<br>
	More preferably, the speed related engagement device may be a<br>
continuously variable transmission (CVT) or a viscous coupling. Such CVTs typically have a threshold CVT speed or speed range at which the CVT enables coupling of the engine to the vehicle drive-train. Conveniently, the upper threshold speed at which the engine is disabled is set at a level below the    threshold CVT speed. Alternatively, the upper threshold speed may be the threshold CVT speed for the device.<br>
Conveniently, having made a comparison of engine speed with the upper threshold speed, the control system may implement a strategy to disable the engine. Comparing the engine speed to the upper threshold speed, said upper       threshold speed being set at a level less than is desired for the engagement of the speed related engagement device, ensures that the engine is disabled if the engine speed exceeds the upper threshold speed thus ensuring that no vehicle motion or runaway will ensue.<br>
More preferably, the engine may be disabled by any one of  or a<br>
      combinatipn of cutting fiel and air events in the case of a fuel Injection system, or<br>
disabling the ignrton system<br>
          Even- more - preferabiy the  vehicle for which - the - present-invention is<br>
applicable may be a scooter or a motorcycle.<br>
Conveniently, where the upper threshold speed is selected to be below the     engagement speed of a speed dependent engagement device, the engine control<br>
system may be programmed such that a number of opportunities are provided to control the engine speed prior to effecting.cessation of engine operation.' For example, the control system, may allow the engine speed to equal or exceed the<br>

AMENDED SHEET<br><br>
upper threshold speed one or two times  each time endeavouring to control the engine speed down to a level below the threshold speed, prior to disabling the engine to prevent an engine speed runaway.event. Conveniently, subsequent to the engine speed becoming equal to or greater than the upper threshold speed, the control system may seek to reduce the engine speed to a more desirable level by reducing the fuelling rate to the engine. If on each occasion following an attempted reduction of the fuelling rate the engine speed subsequently once again equals or exceeds the upper threshold level, the control system than takes measures as alfuded to hereinbefore to effect cessation of engine operation,    Conveniently, In attempting to reduce the fuelling rate to the engine, the control system may seek to enforce the engine to operate at a predetermined idle speed. Such a strategy of enforcing the adoption of a preset idle speed may also not be limited to use only after the engine speed has made several excursions above the upper threshold speed.  Indeed, rather than effect cessation of engine operation as alluded to previously when the upper threshold speed or threshold CVT speed is equaled or exceeded, in certain engine applications, the control system may preferably endeavour to control the engine speed by various means such that it is reduced down to a predetermined idle speed.<br>
The present invention is particularly applicable to clean-bum engines or      engines which operate with a stratified charge at some points of the operating load range. For example, the present invention has applicability to engines which comprise the Applicant's dual fluid fuel injection system. In this fuel injection system, the fuel metering and fuel delivery events are separated into distinct events and a metered quantity of fuels typically delivered ihto a combusion<br>
chamber of the engine entrained in a quantity of compressed air such a system<br>
is further, discussed, in. the Applicant's .US.Patent No.RE36768 and published PCT Patent Application No. WO99/20895, the contents of which are included,-herein by way of reference.<br>
In such a dual fluid fuel injection system, and in particular one where fuel is<br>
     delivered directly into the cylinders of the engine, the fuel spray delivered from the<br>
fuel delivery injectors is typically stratified during the crank and idle modes of<br>
engine operation. That is, the- air/fuel ratio is generally learier'than it would be'at "<br>
other operating points.   More particularly, the air/fuel ratio tolerance throughout<br>
8<br>
AMENDED SHEET<br><br>
the modes is much greater than that exprienced by comparable engines which<br><br><br>
air/fue 'ratio that is stoichiometric or have a large air/fuel ratio window they<br>
operate across the load range with an<br>
homogeneous. As a result, such engines<br>
can operate within when running in stratfied mode, and unlike engines running<br>
with a homogeneous air/fuel ratio, are much less likely to rich mis-fire or<br>
experience unstable combustion if the air 'fuel ratio varies significantly. Hence, if<br>
additional fuel over and above that determined by the engine management<br>
control system is delivered into the engine combustion chamber(s) of such an<br><br>
engine, then because of the large air/<br><br>
fuel ratio operating window, additional<br><br>
torque output can result from the additional fuel resulting in increasing engine speed.   In such engines, torque and nonce engine speed are in fact directly<br><br>
 modes of operation.<br>
proportional to the fuelling rate during such<br>
Hence it can be appreciated that egine speed runaway scenarios may be more of an issue for such stratified criarge engines as any unexpected or<br>
     undesired increase in the fuelling rate will be more likely to result in increased engine speed rather than misfires or a loss of torque. Accordingly, if such an engine is fitted with a speed dependent engagement device such as a CVT, if such an increase in engine speed were sufficient to cause ihe engine to become coupled  to  the  vehicle drive-train  (ie:   by  exceeding  the  threshold   CVT<br>
      engagement speed or engaging the torque converter), then vehicle runaway may result if the driver is taken unaware.   More generally, even if coupling of the<br><br>
engine to the vehicle drive-train does<br><br>
not occur, an uncontrolled increasing<br><br>
engine speed may result in damage to the engine from over-revving or prolonged<br><br>
operation at or above an engine speed<br><br>
which may cause engine deteriorationv-<br><br>
This may hence also apply to homogenous type engines controlled by a drive by wire system where air-flow to the engine can be controlled independentlyof driver<br>
demand  Hence an unexpectedUncreass in the fuelling rate in such an engine may not necessarily result in misfire or unstable operation as a modified airflow as determined by the ECU may also result in an increase in torque and hence<br>
engine speed<br>
Description Of Preferred Embodiment<br>
It will be convenient to further describe the present invention with respect to the accompanying drawing which illustrates a possible arrangement of the<br>

invention. Other arrangements of the invention are possible, and consequently the particularity of the accompanying drawings is not to be understood as superseding the generality of the precedin  description of the invention.<br>

The engine further comprises a dual fluid fuel injection system for effecting   the delivery of fuel entrained in air directly into the combustion chambers of the engine. Accordingly, a combustion event requires the scheduling of a fuel metering event, a fuel delivery event and an ignition event. The fuel delivery event may also be considered an air event as typically an air injector would be controlled to effect delivery of the metered quantity of fuel via air to the engine. 2|0    The prevention of any one or more of these scheduled events will typically result<br>
in no subsequent combustion event within This in turn would result in a drop in engi<br>

In essence the purpose of the control strategy is to determine whether the ingine is operating  within either a 'cranof idle mode of operation, and if so, to ensure that the engine speed does not exceed the CVT engagement threshold<br>

strategy is terminated and the ECU maintains normal operation of the engine. This may, for example, occur when the engine is operating at part or high load and the engine is coupled to the vehicle d ive-train and is effecting vehicle' motion in accordance with driver demand.<br>
If however the ECU has determined that one of the two relevant states is current, the control system determines at Step 3, through the associated data acquisition system, the speed at which the engine is currently operating.<br>
ng the crank or idle states is expected to an engine speed falling outside, and<br>
As part of the engine management control system, there is encoded ideal<br>
ranges within which the engine speed du to fall. The control system will thus react<br>
more particularly, exceeding these sped ranges. The present invention is targeted at those instances where, throjgh mechanical or system failure, the control system is unable to exert sufficient control over the engine so as to bring the speed within the pre-determined limts. For example, such a scenario may arise where a fuel metering injector were to become stuck in the open position., and as such result in an increased and uncontrolled supply of fuel to the engine.<br>
Thus, at Step 3, the measured engine speed is compared with a threshold speed which is lower than the CVT engagement threshold speed. That is, a threshold speed may be set at a predetermined level slightly below the CVT engagement speed such that the ECU may be able to take action upon this lower threshold speed being exceeded and thus ensuring that the CVT engagement speed is never attained by the engine dur ng the crank or idle states.<br><br>
Alternatively, the measured engine<br><br>
speed may be compared with the CVT<br><br>
engagement threshold speed itself at Step 3. If the engine speed is below-this engagement threshold speed, then-the-ECU is controlling the engine as expected and normal engine operation is maintained. if however" the" engine speed  is <br>
determined as being greater than or equal to the engagement threshold speed,<br>
then the ECU must take action to ensure that the vehicle drive-train is not<br><br>
engaged during either the detected crank<br><br>
or idle mode of operation.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
On reaching Step 4, the ECU disables the ignition, fuel and air. events to<br><br><br><br>

Hence, where fuel metering is effected by pump, no signal is provided to the device<br><br>
a separate fuel injector or fuel metering such that no fuel is metered into the-air<br><br>

As an alternative to disabling the engine by disabling each of these events, one or more of the fuel metering, air or ignition events may be disabled to reduce engine speed or provide for cessation of engine operation Step 3B. Further, other means of preventing a combustion event from occurring may also or alternatively be employed.<br>
As alluded to hereinbefore, a slight variation to the control'strategy as described above may in certain circumstances be applicable to certain engine     applications. That is, following Step 3 arid having determined that the threshold speed has been equaled or exceeded by the engine speed, the control system may initially endeavour to reduce the engine speed to a level below that of the threshold    speed    Step    3B;    assuming   this    to    be    a    first    attempt (Step 3A). If following this attempt the engine speed simply increases once again [0   to a level equal to or greater than the threshold speed, the control system may make yet a further attempt to reduce or control the engine speed down to a more desirable level.   If the engine speed again proceeds to equal or exceed the threshold speed subsequent to this second speed reduction attempt by the contro system then "the- control  strategy -proceeds  to Step 4 as previously-<br>
   described at which cessation of engine operation is typically effected, Hence, provided the engagement threshold spepd of a CVT or similar device is not/<br>
. exceeded, the control system (as_shpwn at Step_3A of the flow diagram) may be programmed to, for a predetermined nu Tiber of times, attempt to control the engine speed down to a more desirable evel prior to ceasing engine operation altogether.   Such a variation to the con:rol strategy would typically allow any " once-off insignificant excursions of the engine speed above the threshold speed (i.e., where the threshold speed is set below the engagement speed of any speed<br><br>
AMENDED SHEET<br><br>

related engagement device) to not result in instant shutdown or disabling of the engine.<br><br>
Such a variation may be effectec<br><br>
by the control system seeking to reduce<br><br>
engine speed to below the threshold speed by reducing the fuelling rate to the engine. Other means for reducing the engine speed may however also be used-<br>
tem may seek to control the engine speed rather than effect cessation of engine<br>
In certain arrangements, the control sys down to a predetermined idle speed operation.<br>
ft is to be appreciated that, although a step or ramping function step has not been included in the flow diagram, such functions may be Incorporated Into the control system, as required.<br>
Further, although the main embodiment has primarily been discussed with reference to speed dependent engagement devices, it is equally applicable as a means to prevent an engine speed rur away condition in general where such a 15   condition may be detrimental to engine operation and durability.    That is, regardless of the transmission unit associated with an engine, or in cases where an engine is "declutched" from the driviig wheels of the vehicle, the invention is equally applicable as a means to prevent the attainment of unexpected or undesirable engine speeds during a crank or idle operating state.   Still further, 20    whilst the main embodiment discusses a direct injected fuel system, the invention also has applicability to port or manifold injected engines. The invention may also have applicability to other engine operating states or modes where the engine speed should not be able to exceed a predetermined threshold speed and result  in a speed or vehicle runway conditioh.<br><br>

Unlike expensive mechanical mechanical<br><br>
