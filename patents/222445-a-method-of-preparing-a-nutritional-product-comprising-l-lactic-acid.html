				<td>Chemically Acidified Formula<br>
The present invention relates to a nutritional formula, a process of manufacturing<br>
a nutritional formula, the use of L(+)-lactic acid in the preparation of a nutritional<br>
formula and to the use of isolated or purified L(+)-lactic acid for preventing<br>
growth of pathogens in nutritional formulas.<br>
The Background Art<br>
Gastrointestinal infections, leading to diarrhoea, are still one of the principle<br>
causes of death during infancy. Bacterial infections, caused by the pathogen or its<br>
toxins, are mainly due to bacterial contamination of water or food.<br>
Formula feeding may increase risks for gastrointestinal infections if<br>
contamination cannot be substantially excluded or if external factors favour<br>
growth of infective agents, such as warm humid seasons in tropical or subtropical<br>
countries. Typical bacterial pathogens are enteropathogentic and<br>
enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, for example.<br>
However, viruses (rotaviruses, caliciviruses) and protozoic parasites, such as<br>
Cryptosporidiwn are also frequently associated with infant diarrhoea.<br>
Breast-feeding reduces the exposure to these pathogens and also supplies the<br>
infant with protective antibodies against food-borne pathogens, resulting in lower<br>
incidence of diarrhoea. However, breast-feeding is not always possible, for<br>
example if a mother has to leave her child at home or with childcare during work.<br>
Furthermore, breast-feeding is not recommended if there is a risk of HIV<br>
transmission (Weinberg G. The dilemma of postnatal mother-to-child<br>
transmission of HIV: to breastfeed or not? Birth 2000; 27(3).<br>
One way of solving the problem is the addition of a specific anti-microbial agent,<br>
as is taught in WO 96/25054. However, for infants the consumption of antimicrobial<br>
agents on a regular base should be avoided because of potential<br>
damage to the liver and, in addition because anti-microbial agents often exhibit<br>
undesirable side effects.<br>
A nutritionally safe and effective way of inhibiting growth of bacteria in a<br>
reconstituted infant formula is acidification. Under the trademarks Pelargon®,<br>
•A<br>
Bionan® and Bioguigoz® (SOCIETEE DES PRODUITS NESTLE) powdered<br>
infant formulas are commercialised that have, upon reconstitution, a relatively<br>
low pH, thus reducing the risk of gastrointestinal infections.<br>
However, the process through which acidification is achieved for these formulas<br>
is time and cost intensive: the basic ingredients of an infant formula are<br>
fermented with lactic acid bacteria until a specific pH is achieved, the<br>
fermentation is interrupted, the liquid is pasteurised and processed to a powder.<br>
The fermentation has to be controlled carefully, because it may provide growth<br>
possibilities for pathogenic bacteria and also for bacteriophages, which can<br>
interfere with the fermentation process.<br>
Furthermore, the pH of the formulas of the state of the art can hardly be adjusted<br>
very accurately with respect to the final product and cannot be standardised on a<br>
very specific value.<br>
However time-consuming the fermentation of nutritional formulas may be, it has<br>
the benefit that the acidification occurs slowly and steadily over a prolonged<br>
time, which is an advantage as far as the acidification of the product itself is<br>
concerned. A quick acidification of complex compositions such as nutritional<br>
formulas, which comprise a range of completely different components (proteins,<br>
carbohydrates, lipids) is delicate and often results in precipitation of certain<br>
components, phase separation or simply unsatisfactory formulas.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a nutritional formula<br>
with a bacteriostatic activity whereby the formula can be prepared more<br>
economically (without fermentation), is nutritionally safe and does not comprise<br>
antimicrobial agents other than lactic acid.<br>
In addition, it is an object to provide a nutritional formula with an inhibitory<br>
effect of bacterial growth similar to that of formulas acidified by fermentation.<br>
It is a further objective to provide a reconstitutable nutritional formula<br>
comprising protein from various origins such as cow's milk but also soy, rice,<br>
carob seed germ flour and other protein sources, which is in particular suitable<br>
for babies and infants and the protein source of which provides a balanced<br>
amino-acid profile, preferably similar to that of human milk.<br>
It is another objective to obtain an infant formula, which is acidified with an acid<br>
that has no adverse effects in infants.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Remarkably, a way was found to prepare nutritional formulas based on direct<br>
acidification with L(+)-lactic acid, having bacteriostatic activity and being<br>
nutritionally safe for infants.<br>
Consequently, in a first aspect the present invention provide's a nutritional<br>
formula, wherein the pH of the formula, in its liquid state, is in the range of 3.5 to<br>
6, wherein the formula comprises lactic acid and whereby at least 70% by weight<br>
of the lactic acid is present as the enantiomer of L(+)-lactic acid., characterized in<br>
that the formula is directly acidified.<br>
In a third aspect the invention provides a method of preparing the nutritional<br>
formula according to the invention, comprising the steps of<br>
- mixing and hydrating a carbohydrate source and/or a protein source,<br>
- adding diluted L-(+) lactic acid until a pH of about 3.5 - 6 is obtained.<br>
In a fourth aspect the invention provides the use of isolated L(+)-lactic acid in the<br>
preparation of acidified nutritional formulas.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides the use of isolated or purified<br>
L(+)-lactic acid for preventing growth of pathogens in nutritional formulas.<br>
An advantage of the present invention is that the formula shows bacteriostatic<br>
activity and a fermentation step may be avoided.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that it provides, for the first time, a<br>
directly acidified nutritional formula comprising predominantly the L(+)<br>
enantiomer of lactic acid and which is suitable for infant nutrition.<br>
Yet another advantage of the present invention is that it provides an acidified<br>
nutritional formula that can be produced quickly.<br>
r<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Within the context of this specification the word "comprises" is taken to mean<br>
"includes, among other things". It is not intended to be construed as "consists of<br>
only".<br>
Within the context of the present invention L(+)-lactic acid is understood as an<br>
equivalent of S(+)-2-hydroxy propionic acid.<br>
The term "directly acidified" refers to the fact that acid is directly added to the<br>
nutritional formula during its preparation. The acidity of L(+)-lactic acid is not<br>
obtained by a fermentation process of the formula, wherein lactic acid bacteria<br>
produce the lactic acid and the formula is thus continuously acidified over a time<br>
span of usually 2-10 hours.<br>
The term "protein source" is not intended to be construed as including only<br>
proteins, but includes any matter that is proteinogenic, that is, may be ustilized<br>
by the human or animal body to synthesize proteins. Examples, besides intact<br>
proteins, are hydrolysed proteins and free amino acids.<br>
All percentages are percentages by weight, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
The fact that the formula is directly acidified may easily be determined with<br>
analytical methods detecting the presence of live or dead lactic acid bacteria or<br>
the presence of metabolites of such acidifying bacteria.<br>
For example, quantitative DNA analysis may be suitable to determine if a<br>
formula has been fermented by a lactic acid bacterium or directly acidified.<br>
Species-specific DNA probes of lactic acid bacteria have been described in the<br>
scientific literature and may easily be conceived and used by the skilled person.<br>
If the nutritional formula comprises bacterial DNA of a fermenting bacterium in<br>
amounts higher to the DNA corresponding to 105 bacteria/g formula (dry matter),<br>
the formula has been fermented.<br>
Other methods for determining if a nutritional formula has been subjected to a<br>
fermentation process may be selected depending on the remaining ingredients of<br>
the nutritional formula. For example, individual free amino acids, small peptides<br>
and/or non-protein nitrogen may be determined if the formula is based on intact<br>
protein, because the activity of fermenting lactic acid bacteria changes the<br>
concentration of these compounds.<br>
Free amino-acids, peptides and other metabolites are usually specific for the<br>
fermenting activity or metabolism of a specific strain of fermenting bacteria and<br>
the presence of these metabolites is to be analysed after having determined, by<br>
DNA analysis, for example, which lactic acid bacteria has fermented the formula.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term "in its liquid state" refers to the<br>
fact that the formula may be a liquid formula, for example a shelf-stable or a<br>
chilled liquid formula, or, alternatively, a powdered formula.<br>
In case of a powdered formula, "in its liquid state" refers to the liquid, hydrated<br>
or reconstituted nutritional formula obtained usually by adding a predetermined<br>
amount of water to a predetermined amount of powdered formula. Usually, the<br>
amounts of water and/or powder are specific for a particular powdered formula.<br>
With respect to total lactic acid of the nutritional formula, L(+)-lactic acid is<br>
predominantly present, meaning that at least 70%, preferably at least 80%, more<br>
preferably at least 90%, even more preferably at least 95% by weight of lactic<br>
acid is present in the L(+) form. For example, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of total<br>
lactic acid is present in the form of L(+)-lactic acid.<br>
The term "isolated" or "purified" L(+)-lactic acid refers to lactic acid wherein the<br>
L(+) enantiomer is present, in relation to the other enantiomer of lactic acid, in<br>
the weight percentages given above.<br>
Within the context of the present invention, the term "reconstitutable" formula<br>
refers to the fact that a formula is present basically in the form of a powder or<br>
otherwise predominantly dry structure and may be prepared ad hoc by addition of<br>
a defined amount of liquid, such as water and optional stirring, for example.<br>
Within the context of the present invention, the term "solution" in the context of<br>
the manufacturing of the present invention, is not intended to be construed as<br>
liquids were all ingredients are completely dissolved. To the contrary, for the<br>
sake of convenience the term solution is also used when actually an emulsion<br>
and/or a dispersion is present.<br>
Preferably, the pH of the formula, optionally after reconstitution with water, is in<br>
the range of 3.5 to 6, preferably 3.5 - 5.5, more preferably in the range of 4.0 to<br>
5.3, even more preferably in the range of 4.5 to 5.0, such as 4.6 to 4.8, for<br>
example.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the nutritional formula is a powdered<br>
nutritional formula. For example, it is a powdered and reconstitutable, or,<br>
alternatively, a liquid ready-to-drink formula.<br>
If the nutritional composition according to the invention is powdered, 100-150 g,<br>
preferably 120-140 g of the powdered may preferably be reconstituted with 900<br>
ml water.<br>
In case that a powdered composition is prepared according to the present<br>
invention, there is a specific advantage as compared to the preparation of<br>
biologically acidified compositions: Since a fermentation step is avoided, the<br>
optional drying process will be much more efficient, due to the fact that a<br>
fermentable solution with low dry-matter content may be avoided. The whole<br>
process may be conducted at higher dry matter, thus superseding evaporationstep<br>
or drying of a solution at a high water content.<br>
In an embodiment, the nutritional formula according to the present invention is<br>
an infant formula.<br>
In another embodiment, the nutritional formula according to the present<br>
invention further comprises a protein source, a carbohydrate source and a lipid<br>
source.<br>
In an embodiment of the nutritional formula comprising a protein source, the<br>
protein source comprises a protein source selected from the group of whole or<br>
skimmed milk powder, casein, whey protein, soy protein, rice protein, carob seed<br>
protein, germ flour protein, and/or mixtures thereof.<br>
r<br>
In still another embodiment of the nutritional formula according to the<br>
embodiment wherein the protein source comprises whey and casein, the casein<br>
and/or whey protein is intact or not hydrolysed.<br>
However, the formula may also comprise hydrolised protein sources, such as<br>
partially or totally hydrolysed whey and/or casein, or vegetal protein sources, for<br>
example.<br>
In an embodiment, the method according to the present invention comprises a<br>
further step of adding a lipid source. In a preferred embodiment, the step of<br>
adding a lipid source is conducted before adding L-(+) lactic acid.<br>
Preferably, the formula does not comprise remainders, waste or residues of<br>
bacteria used to acidify the nutritional formula. The formula may, in contrast,<br>
comprise living probiotics, such as encapsulated, spray dried probiotic microorganisms<br>
that may be added in powder form to a powdered nutritional formula.<br>
The product according to the present invention may be obtained in any suitable<br>
way. In principle, ingredients suitable for nutritional formulas may be selected<br>
from a number of different sources.<br>
A protein source, for example, may be selected from animal and/or vegetal<br>
origin. For example, proteins from legumes, such as soy-protein, cereals, meat, or<br>
milk may be used. For example, whole milk and/or skimmed milk and/or their<br>
respective powders may be selected. Preferably, the protein source comprises<br>
whey and/or casein. Casein may be in the form of a salt (sodium or potassium<br>
caseinate), micellar, enzymatically hydrolysed or otherwise processed casein.<br>
Whey protein may be sweet or acid whey and may be hydrolysed or not. If sweet<br>
whey is used, it may be treated to the end that the CGMP fraction is removed<br>
(see for example, EP 0880 902). Hydrolysis may be conducted enzymatically or<br>
by aid of acid. It may be a complete or a partial hydrolysis, yielding poly-, oligopeptides<br>
or free amino acids. Preferably, non-hydrolysed casein and/or whey<br>
protein is used to prepare the formula according to the present invention.<br>
If milk protein is used as a protein source, the milk protein may be casein, whey,<br>
or further purified fractions, such as lactalbumin, for example. Preferably the<br>
nutritional formula comprises, in percent by weight of the total protein source,<br>
30-70%, preferably 40-60% whey and 70-30%, preferably 60-40% casein, more<br>
preferably 45-55% whey and 55-45% casein.<br>
For example, the formula may be cow's milk based with an unchanged ratio of<br>
caseins to whey proteins. In this embodiment, the formula is a casein<br>
predominant formula. In an alternative embodiment, the may have a modified<br>
ratio of caseins and whey proteins, that is, an adapted formula, in which whey<br>
protein is in equal proportion with casein or predominant over casein.<br>
Alternatively, the formula according t the present invention may an "all-whey"<br>
formula, in which whey protein may be the exclusive protein source, for<br>
example.<br>
The protein source may provide 8-20% of the energy of the nutritional formula.<br>
Preferably, the protein source provides 9-17%, more preferably 10-15%, for<br>
example 12% of the energy of the formula.<br>
The carbohydrate source in the nutritional formula can be carbohydrate suitable<br>
for use in infant formulas, if an infant formula is to be prepared. Typical<br>
carbohydrate sources include sucrose, maltodextrin, maltose, lactose, com syrup,<br>
corn syrup solids, rice syrup solids, starches, and the like. Preferably, the<br>
carbohydrate source includes lactose and starch or a derivative thereof that can be<br>
easily digested and absorbed by infants. Source of starch and/or maltodextrin<br>
may be cereal flour or derivatives thereof, in particularly wheat, barley, rice<br>
and/or cornflour, and/or a starch, particularly wheat, barley, rice, tapioca, potato<br>
and/or corn starch, for example. Also glucose and/or fructose may be present.<br>
For full term formulas, the carbohydrate source preferably comprises lactose,<br>
which may, at least partially, be provided by whole, preferably skimmed milk<br>
powder, for example.<br>
For example, an infant formula may comprise, in percent by weight, 5-25%,<br>
preferably 10-20%, more preferably 12-18% of maltodextrin.<br>
The digestible carbohydrate source may provide 50-70% of the energy of the<br>
formula, for example. Preferably the carbohydrate source provides 55-65%, more<br>
preferably 57-63%, for example 60% of the energy of the formula.<br>
7<br>
The lipid source may comprise any fat, oil or other lipid, which is suitable for use<br>
in nutritional formulas such as infant formulas, for example. Typical lipid<br>
sources include milk fat, safflower oil, egg yolk lipid, canola oil, olive oil,<br>
coconut oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, palm olein, low eruic rapeseed oil, soybean<br>
oil, sunflower oil, fish oil, and microbial fermentation oil containing long-chain,<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acids. These oils may be in the form of high oleic forms<br>
such as high oleic sunflower oil and high oleic safflower oil. The lipid source<br>
may also be in the form of fractions derived from these oils such as palm olein,<br>
medium chain triglycerides (MCT), and esters of fatty acids such as arachidonic<br>
acid, linoleic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, docosahexaeonic acid, linolenic<br>
acid, oleic acid, lauric acid, capric acid, caprylic acid, caproic acid, and the like.<br>
If the formula is intended for pre-term infants, the lipid source preferably<br>
contains medium chain triglycerides; for example in an amount of 10-40%,<br>
preferably 15-35% by weight of the lipid source.<br>
The lipid source may provide 18-40% of the energy of the formula, for example.<br>
Preferably, the lipid source provides 20-35%, more preferably 25-30%, for<br>
example 27% of the energy of the formula.<br>
An infant formula may further contain ingredients, which are designed to meet<br>
the nutritional needs of the human infant. In particular, it is preferred that the<br>
infant formula is "nutritionally complete"; that is it contains adequate nutrients to<br>
sustain healthy human life for extended periods. Preferably, the formula<br>
comprises vitamins, minerals and trace elements in recommended amounts.<br>
For example, the formula may comprise magnesium, zinc, iron, copper, iodine,<br>
selenium, preferably in the form of biologically available salts. Furthermore, the<br>
formula may comprise vitamin C, A, E, Bl, B2, B6, B12, D3, Kl<br>
(Phylloquinone) PP (Nicotinamide), Calcium-D-panthenate, D-Biotin, Taurin<br>
and nutritionally suitable mixtures thereof, for example.<br>
In addition, the formula further comprises a food grade emulsifier, such as<br>
lecithin, for example.<br>
The formula may further comprise further ingredients, for example with specific<br>
nutritional benefits or other desirable effects.<br>
For the preparation of the reconstitutable formula there exist a great number of<br>
suitable ways and the manufacturer is given various possibilities to adapt the<br>
process to specific requirements and to modify the end-product according to<br>
specific preferences.<br>
For example, it was found that L+ lactic acid may be added in-line or batch-wise,<br>
into a tank, which may influence preferred process parameters.<br>
For the purpose of the present description, a few alternative procedures are<br>
exemplary depicted below.<br>
For example, the following steps may be conducted in the given sequence:<br>
Mixing non-fat solids (mainly a protein source and/or a carbohydrate source) and<br>
adding water to obtain a solution,<br>
Optionally, wet-adding minerals at this moment and/or dry-adding them at the<br>
end,<br>
Preferably, pre-heating of the solution to 30-70, preferably 40-60°C,<br>
Adding a lipid-mix, for example, in-line to the pre-heated solution,<br>
Homogenizing the solution comprising the lipid source at high pressure,<br>
Cooling the solution to below 15°C, preferably below 10°C,<br>
Adding L(+)-lactic acid,<br>
Heating the solution to substantially reduce bacterial load,<br>
Optionally: evaporation step, to increase dry matter and facilitate drying,<br>
Drying, for example by spray drying,<br>
Adding further minerals and/or vitamins,<br>
The process according to the present invention may comprise further steps, for<br>
example, after adding L(+)-lactic acid, adjusting the pH with a food-grade base<br>
and/or acid to between 3.5-6. Such a step may be useful to (fine-) adjust the pH<br>
more accurately to a selected value.<br>
While the above procedure yields good product characteristics, an alternative<br>
sequence of steps is given below, for example:<br>
Mixing non-fat solids (mainly a protein source and/or a carbohydrate source) and<br>
adding water to obtain a solution,<br>
Optionally, wet-adding minerals at this stage or later and/or dry-adding them at<br>
the end,<br>
Preferably, cooling the solution to below 15°C, preferably below 10°C,<br>
Adding L(+)-lactic acid, preferably in the form of a 40-70wt.-% solution.<br>
Preferably, pre-heating of the solution to 30-70, preferably 40-60°C,<br>
Preferably, dding a lipid-mix, for example, in-line to the pre-heated solution,<br>
Homogenizing the solution comprising the lipid source at high pressure,<br>
Heating the solution to substantially reduce bacterial load,<br>
Optionally: evaporation step, to increase dry matter and facilitate drying,<br>
A further way of producing the nutritional composition according to the present<br>
invention may comprise the steps of, for example:<br>
hydrating at least a protein and a carbohydrate source to obtain a solution,<br>
heat-treating the solution to substantially reduce bacterial load,<br>
adding L+ lactic acid to the heat treated solution, and<br>
homogenizing the heat-treated and directly acidified solution.<br>
Lipids may also be added, for example after dissolution of protein and<br>
carbohydrate source, but preferably prior to the heat treatment.<br>
If a powdered composition is to be produced, the homogenized and acidified<br>
solution comprising the carbohydrate, protein and optionally lipid source may be<br>
powdered by drying, for example spray-drying. In this case, minerals and/or<br>
vitamins may also be dry-added after drying.<br>
If a liquid product is to be produced, the product may preferably be sterilized<br>
(UHT) and aseptically filled. In this case, an evaporation step is usually not<br>
necessary.<br>
If L+lactic acid is added as indicated above (in-line), this has the advantage that<br>
the heat-treatment may be applied on a pH-neutral product. This reduces product<br>
fouling and simplifies the process in general, longer production runs are possible<br>
and cleaning of the material is easier.<br>
A preferred process alternative for obtaining a powdered formula is given below<br>
in a more detailed manner.<br>
V,<br>
Accordingly, the protein and carbohydrate source, for example skimmed milk<br>
powder, casein, whey and/or maltodextrin may be hydrated 'and dispersed in<br>
water to obtain a dispersion or solution with a dry matter content of 15-40%,<br>
preferably 20- 35%, more preferably 18-33%, most preferably 23-28% by<br>
weight. The solution is given time to allow for a proper hydration of the protein.<br>
Alternatively, hydration may conveniently take place at lower contents of solids,<br>
for example if specific ingredients so require or if a liquid, ready-to-drink<br>
composition is to be prepared, for example.<br>
In a further step, minerals may be added to the solution. However, minerals and<br>
vitamins may equally be added, for example dry-mixed, at the end.<br>
The lipid source, if present, may be added at this moment. For example, it may<br>
be added after a pre-heating of the solution to 50 - 90°C, preferably 60 - 75°C.<br>
Thereby, the lipid source optionally including soy lecithin maybe added directly<br>
into a tank comprising the solution. Alternatively, lipids may be added in-line<br>
directly into the tube with the flowing solution.<br>
The solution is preferably subjected to a heat treatment with the purpose of<br>
reducing bacterial load or facilitating homogenization or drying. For example, the<br>
solution may be heated to 95-120°C, preferably 100-110°C for 2 to 15 seconds,<br>
preferably 3 to 8 seconds, for example by direct steam injection with a Koreco<br>
steam injector.<br>
L(+)-lactic acid may be added in any suitable way, depending on the particular<br>
process to be used (batch-wise or in-line). For example, it may be added in<br>
sufficient amount in the form of a concentrated powder. Preferably, however,<br>
L(+)-lactic acid is diluted with water to obatin a solution.<br>
Depending on the way L+lactic acid is added, different dilutions may be<br>
preferred. For example, if L+lactic acid is added batch-wise, it is preferably<br>
slowly added to a cooled solution at below 15°C, preferably below 10°C to a tank<br>
with the solution comprising a protein source, such as milk proteins and/or<br>
carbohydrates and optionally lipids, for example. Dilutions of 5-50% , preferably<br>
10-15% by weight of L(+)-lactic acid may conveniently be used.<br>
Preferably, however, L+lactic acid may be added in-line to the heat-treated<br>
solution at about ambient temperatures, for example. For example, L+lactic acid<br>
may be diluted to 35-65%, preferably 40-60% by weight of L+lactic acid in<br>
water, and then added in-line. For example, L+lactic acid may be added in-line to<br>
the product-stream before homogenization.<br>
In case L+-lactic acid is added in-line in the form of an about 50%-solution, it<br>
may be added in a rate of about 1.2-1.8 kg per 100 kg of the preferably heattreated<br>
solution, preferably about 1.5 kg of diluted L+lactic acid per 100 kg of<br>
the solution, for example, depending on the acidity and pH to be obtained.<br>
PH may be controlled by in-line measurement, for example, allowing for<br>
adjusting pH during the in-line adding by way of a feedback mechanism.<br>
Preferably, pH is adjusted to 4.0 to 5.0, more preferably to 4.2 to 4.8, even more<br>
preferably to 4.3 to 4.6.<br>
L(+)-lactic acid is commercially available, for example under the trademark<br>
PURAC® FCC 50 (PURAC biochem, Arkelsedijk 46, PO Box 21, 4200 AA<br>
Gorinchem, the Netherlands).<br>
The amount of L(+)-lactic acid added depends on the exact pH or acidity wished<br>
to obtain. For example, based on the dry weight of the formula, it may comprise<br>
0.5-3.5%, preferably 1-3%, more preferably 1.7-2.3% by weight of L(+)-lactic<br>
acid.<br>
Preferably, a homogenisation step may be conducted before drying, in order to<br>
obtain an even, regular powder, for example. Hence, the concentrated solution<br>
may be preheated to 65-80°C, preferably 70-75°C and homogenised at a pressure<br>
of 100-200 bar, preferably 130-170bar, for example. While any suitable<br>
equipment may be used, an Alpha-Laval high pressure homogenizer is mentioned<br>
by way of example.<br>
It may be useful to conduct an evaporation step before drying the solution in<br>
order to increase dry matter content. For example, the heated solution may be<br>
flashed into an evaporator, for example into a Scheffers or Niro falling-film<br>
evaporator in which the solution is .concentrated up to 30 to 60%, preferably 45-<br>
55% dry matter.<br>
Before spray drying, soy lecithin may be added to the solution, especially in case<br>
the lipid source has been added before acidification and without soy lecithin.<br>
Spray drying may be conducted in order to obtain a powder suitable for<br>
reconstitution with water, for example. Other drying methods are possible and<br>
may be selected as well, such as fluidized bed drying, freeze drying, roller-drying<br>
for example.<br>
If desired, additional ingredients may be added to the powder directly at the end<br>
and not to the solution, for example. This is particularly true for heat-sensitive<br>
ingredients, such as some vitamins, other beneficial metabolites, essential and<br>
non-essential molecules such as amino acids, such as taurine and L-carnitine, for<br>
example, and certain bio-active molecules, if not yet added to the solution, for<br>
example. Hence, the powder may be completed with a vitamin premix providing<br>
essential vitamins in amounts that are sufficient to cover basic requirements<br>
calculated on the base of the recommended daily consumption of the<br>
reconstituted formula.<br>
In case that a liquid product is to be prepared, for example a ready-to-drink (rtd)<br>
formula or a concentrate, the process includes a UHT-sterilisation step followed<br>
by aseptic filling, for example. In this case, the process is generally conducted at<br>
a dry-matter content of 10-15%, preferably 12-14% by weight as from the<br>
beginning to the end.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration only and in no way<br>
should be construed as limiting the subject matter of the present application.<br>
Percentages and parts are by weight unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Example 1:<br>
A directly acidified, L-(+) lactic acid containing, powdered infant formula is<br>
prepared by using the ingredients of given in Table 1 below.<br>
Table 1: Ingredients for an Infant Formula in Percent<br>
and soy lecithin. The lipid source is then added in-line, that I, directly in the tube<br>
with the flowing product before the high-pressure homogenizer.<br>
The solution including the added lipid source is heated to 105°C by direct steam<br>
injection by a steam injection valve and hold at the temperature for 5 seconds.<br>
Then the product is directly flashed into an evaporator, in which the product is<br>
concentrated up to 40-50% total solids (dry matter) by a Scheffers falling-film<br>
evaporator.<br>
Thereafter, the concentrated solution is conducted to a buffer tank for<br>
homogenisation, where it is pre-heated to 75°C, homogenised at 150 bars with a<br>
high pressure pump and then spray dried.<br>
The powdered solution is then supplied with the vitamin premix, the mineral<br>
premix and a small part of the maltodextrin.<br>
The powder obtained is a formula particularly suitable for infants that may be<br>
reconstituted with tap water (20 g powder with 137 ml water, for example). The<br>
recommended daily serving size for a 3 month old baby would be 153 g powder<br>
and 900 ml water.<br>
The pH of the reconstituted formula is 4.5.<br>
Example 2: Alternative preparation of an acidified nutritional formula<br>
A ready-to-drink formula was prepared based on the ingredients, percentages and<br>
the procedure according to Example 1, with the exceptions that no soy lecithin is<br>
present. Furthermore, the process is conducted at a dry-matter content in the<br>
range of 12-14% by weight and an UH-treatment is conducted at the end, before<br>
aseptically filling into packs of 240 ml:<br>
- mixing and hydrating carbohydrates and proteins,<br>
- pre-heating the solution to about 50°C,<br>
- pre-heating the lipid source to about 50°C, adding a lipid source (in line).<br>
- homogenising the solution,<br>
- adding L-(+) lactic acid to obtain a pH between 4.3-4.4,<br>
- UHT-treating the solution for sterilisation,<br>
- aseptically filling the dispersion into packs of 240 ml.<br>
A ready to drink formula with a dry-matter content of 12.5% is obtained.<br>

Skimmed milk, maltodextrin, sucrose and native starch are dissolved in water at<br>
about 50°C at a dry-matter content of 31% by weight.<br>
Fat is added at the same temperature, and dry matter content is adjusted to 30%<br>
by weight.<br>
The solution is heated to 70°C with a plate heater, then a heat treatment to reduce<br>
bacterial load is conducted at 110°C for 10s by direct steam injection.<br>
The solution having dry matter content of 36% and 70°C is flushed into a buffer<br>
tank. From there, the solution is led to the homogeniser.<br>
f<br>
L+ lactic acid is added at 25°C in the form of a 50% solution in-line into the tube<br>
leading to the homogeniser. PH is measured in-line and L+ lactic acid is added in<br>
amounts as to obtain a pH of 5.0. The L+ lactic acid solution is added at a rate of<br>
1.5 kg per 100 kg of the hydrated and heat-treated solution.<br>
A two-stage homogenisation is conducted at 100 bar and 20 bar, respectively,<br>
and dry matter is preferably at about 36% at this moment.<br>
Thereafter, the homogenised solution is spray-dried and a powdered nutritional<br>
composition is obtained. The powdered composition was completed with<br>
sufficient amounts of minerals and vitamins and filled into cans.<br>
The powdered composition was reconstituted (13g powder in 90 ml water), and a<br>
reconstituted composition is obtained, having a pH in the range of 4.9-5.1.<br>
The powdered composition obtained has essentially the same product<br>
characteristics as the powderes obtained according to Examples 1-2. However,<br>
the process according to the present example is more efficient and allows for<br>
higher turnover.<br>

The Infant formula of Example 1 and different commercially available infant<br>
formulas were subjected to microbiological tests with various gastrointestinal<br>
pathogens. Table 1 lists the different formulas and indicates the pH that is<br>

MlCROBIAL CULTURES<br>
Escherichia coli 0157:H7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus,<br>
Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella dysenteriae FSM 1, 2 and 3,<br>
Enterobacter sakazakii, Vibrio cholerae 0:139, Candida albicans and Rotavirus<br>
WA (Human Rotavirus serotype 1), Hochi (Human Rotavirus serotype 4) and<br>
SA11 (Simian Rotavirus corresponding to Human Rotavirus serotype 3) were all<br>
from the strain collection of the Nestle Research Centre. Numbers behind the<br>
species name indicate serotype of the strain. These strains are most likely<br>
representative for other pathogenic strains of the same species. Any pathogen<br>
from these species, which is not particularly selected or genetically modified,<br>
would probably behave accordingly in the below-given experimental setting.<br>
CHALLENGE TEST<br>
Bacterial strains were grown individually in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI, Oxoid<br>
CM225) for 18 to 20 h at 37°C. After dilution with Tryptone Salt (0.1 % tryptone<br>
(Oxoid LR42 + 0.85% NaCl) to a concentration of ca. 105 CPU/ml, suspensions<br>
of strains belonging to the same species were pooled and aliquots of 1 ml were<br>
subsequently added to bottles containing 100 ml of the freshly prepared<br>
reconstituted infant formula thus yielding an initial concentration of ca 103<br>
cfu/ml. For Candida the same procedure was followed except that it was grown<br>
in Yeast and Malt extract broth (YM, Difco 0711-17-1).<br>
After inoculation the bottles were incubated in a water bath at 4, 25 or 37°C and<br>
growth or inactivation was monitored by enumeration after 0, 3 and 6 hours. For<br>
this purpose the following media were employed: Violet Red Bile Glucose agar<br>
(VRBG, Oxoid CM 485) for the Enterobacteriaceae, MYP (Merck 5267) for B.<br>
cereus, Baird-Parker Agar (Oxoid CM 275) for S. aureus, Cholera Medium<br>
(TCBS, Oxoid CM 333) for V. cholerae, KF Streptococcus agar (Oxoid CM 701)<br>
for Ent. faecalis, DG18 (Oxoid CM729) for C. albicans and Pseudomonas Agar<br>
(Oxoid CM559) for Ps. aeruginosa. In order to determine the reproducibility of<br>
the results some of the challenge tests were performed in triplicate.<br>
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<br>
MICROBIOLOGICAL QUALITY<br>
To verify that the starting material itself was not contaminated several<br>
microbiological tests were performed. The results (data not shown) demonstrate<br>
that all the infant formulas were free (
Enterobacteriacae, Ps. aeruginosa, B. cereus, S. aureus, Enterococci, yeasts<br>
and moulds. Total plate counts were less than 50 cfu/ml.<br>
FATE OF MICROBIAL PATHOGENS IN RECONSTITUTED INFANT FORMULA<br>
In the first challenge test, four commercially available infant formulas were<br>
separately inoculated with eight different bacterial pathogens and one spoilage<br>
yeast. The temperature was found to have a major effect on the behaviour of the<br>
various pathogens. At 4°C the tested pathogens apparently did not grow nor die<br>
in any of the products during the 6h following reconstitution. At 25°C, most<br>
bacteria showed some (albeit slow) growth in the pH-neutral products, but in the<br>
acidified product "D" no growth occurred. The yeast C. albicans did not grow<br>
nor die off in any of the products.<br>
At 37°C, all bacteria grew quite well in the pH-neutral products, but no or only<br>
very little growth occurred in the infant formula with a low pH. For Ps.<br>
aeruginosa exposure to the acidified product at 37°C had a clear bactericidal<br>
effect. C. albicans counts again showed little variation.<br>
As these results showed that the fermented product had a clear bacteriostatic<br>
effect on pathogenic bacteria the question was raised whether this was solely due<br>
to the presence of lactic acid and the reduced pH or whether other inhibitory<br>
factors were involved. To address this a second challenge test was performed in<br>
which the antimicrobial properties of the fermented product ("D") were<br>
compared with those of a directly acidified non-fermented product ("E"), the<br>
formula obtained in Example 1.<br>
It was found that for the fate of the pathogens, it did not make any difference<br>
whether they were exposed to the non-fermented acidified product or to the<br>
fermented product. The Enterobacteriaceae (S. typhimurium, Sh. dysenteriae and<br>
E. coli O157:H7) resisted fairly well under the conditions tested (6 hours at 25<br>
and 37°C), but for V. cholerae the exposure to this environment quickly became<br>
lethal at both temperatures. Already within three hours it was no longer<br>
detectable.<br>
In the same experiment the influence of the pH was further investigated; it was<br>
found that already at pH 5.0 Salmonella and E. coli O157 were no longer<br>
inhibited, whereas Shigella started to grow at pH 5.2. For Vibrio, on the other<br>
hand, this pH was still bactericidal.<br>
This example study shows that pH-neutral infant formulas may support rapid<br>
growth of enteric pathogens when stored at 25 or 37°C after reconstitution. To<br>
prevent the risk that such products become hazardous, they should only be stored<br>
for a short time or under refrigeration. For acidified formulas, the most relevant<br>
pathogens cannot grow at pH of 5.0 or lower. Products which have been acidified<br>
through fermentation with lactic acid bacteria have similar bacteriostatic<br>
properties as formulas which have been acidified through direct addition of lactic<br>
acid and both may provide a safe alternative for the feeding of infants in<br>
situations where breast-feeding may not be possible.<br>
In addition, direct acidification of powdered infant formulas with L(+)-lactic acid<br>
substantially reduces the manufacturing time and loss if compared to formulas<br>
acidified by fermentation.<br><br>
