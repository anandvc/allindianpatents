COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10; Rule 13)<br>
TITLE A PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATION<br><br>
APPLICANT<br>
CIPLA LIMITED<br>
AN INDIAN COMPANY<br>
OF  289 BELLASIS ROAD, MUMBAI CENTRAL, MUMBAI 400 008<br>
INDIA<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is performed.<br><br><br>
- 1A-<br>
This application is divided out of the Indian Patent Application no. : 733/MUMNP/2004<br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical products and formulations. More particularly the present invention relates to pharmaceutical products and formulations useful for preventing or minimising allergic reactions. More particularly, but not exclusively, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical products and formulations for nasal and ocular use.<br>
Such allergic reactions commonly comprise the allergy-related and vasomotor-related symptoms and the rhinovirus-related symptoms.<br>
It is known to use antihistamines in nasal sprays and eye drops to treat allergy-related conditions. Thus, for example, it is known to use the antihistamine azelastine (usually as the hydrochloride salt) as a nasal spray against seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis, or as eye drops against seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis.<br>
It is also known to treat these conditions using a corticosteroid, which will suppress nasal and ocular inflammatory conditions. Among the corticosteroids known for nasal use are, for example, beclomethasone, mometasone, fluticasone, budesonide and cyclosenide. Corticosteroids known for ocular anti-inflammatory use include betamethasone sodium, dexamethasone sodium and prednisolone acetate, for example.<br>
It would be highly desirable, however, to provide a treatment that combines the effects of anti-histamine treatments and steroid treatments, in a phartnaceutically acceptable formulation, which is tolerated in situ, without significantly disrupting the potency of the constituent pharmaceuticals.<br>
We have now found that, very surprisingly, azelastine (4-[(4-Chlorophenyl)methyl]-2-(hexahydro-l-methyl-lH-azepin-4-yl)-l(2H)-phthalazinone), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or physiologically functional derivative thereof, preferably in salt form and even more preferably in the form of the hydrochloride salt, can advantageously be combined with a steroid, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or physiologically functional derivative thereof, to provide a stable, very effective combination product or formulation preferably for nasal or ocular treatment. The combination can provide, in a single administration or dosing regime, the antihistaminic properties of azelastine and the anti-<br><br>
2<br>
inflammatory (and / or other) properties of the steroid, without any significant interference between the two, or adverse reaction in situ.<br>
In one aspect the invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising azelastine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or physiologically functional derivative thereof, and a steroid, preferably a corticosteroid, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or physiologically functional derivative thereof, the formulation preferably being in a form suitable for administration nasally or ocularly.<br>
The term "physiologically functional derivative" as used herein denotes a chemical derivative of any of the specific therapeutic agents described herein having the same or similar physiological function as the free base therapeutic agent and, for example, being convertible in the body thereto. According to the present invention, examples of physiologically functional derivatives include esters.<br>
The preferred forms of formulations of the invention are nasal drops, eye drops, nasal sprays, nasal inhalation solutions or aerosols or insufflation powders.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention can comprise stable aqueous solutions of azelastine or one or more of its salts, in combination with steroids which may be beclomethasone, mometasone, fluticasone, budesonide or cyclosenide, which can be used in the form of inhalation solution, pressurized aerosoL eye drops or nasal drops, and in a particular preferred embodiment, in the form of a spray (preferably a nasal spray). The spray can, for example, be formed by the use of a conventional spray-squeeze bottle or a pump vaporizer. In addition, it is also possible to use compressed gas aerosols. In a preferred embodiment, 0.03 to 3 mg of azelastine base and 0.05 to 0.15 mg of the steroid should be released per individual actuation.<br>
The formulations preferably contain a preservative and/or stabilizer. These include, for example: ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (edetic acid) and its alkali salts (for example dialkali salts such as disodium salt, calcium salt, calcium-sodium salt), lower alkyl p-hydroxybenzoates, chlorhexidine (for example in the form of the acetate or gluconate) and phenyl mercury borate. Other suitable preservatives are: pharmaceutically useful quaternary ammonium compounds, for example cetylpyridinium chloride, tetradecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide, generally known as "cetrimide", benzyldimethyl-[2-[2-[p-(l,l,3,3-tetramethyl-butyl)phenoxy]ethoxy]-ammonium chloride, generally known as "benzethonium chloride" and myristyl picolrnium chloride. Each of these compounds may be used in a<br><br>
3<br>
concentration of 0.002 to 0.05%, for example 0,02% (weight/volume in liquid formulations, otherwise weight/weight). Preferred preservatives among the quaternary ammonium compounds are, however, alkylbenzyl dimethyl ammonium chloride and mixtures thereof, for example the compounds generally known as "benzalkonium chloride".<br>
The total amount of preservatives in the formulations (solutions, ointments, etc.) is preferably from 0.001 to O.lOg, preferably O.Olg per 100ml of solution/suspension or lOOg of formulation.<br>
In the case of preservatives, the following amounts of individual substances can, for example, be used: thimero sal 0.002-0.02%; benzalkonium chloride 0.002 to 0.02% (in combination with thimero sal the amount of thimero sal is, for example =0.002 to 0.005%;); chlorhexidine acetate or gluconate 0.01 to 0.02%; phenyl mercuric/nitrate, borate, acetate 0.002-0.004%; p-hydroxybenzoic acid ester (for example, a mixture of the methyl ester and propyl ester in the ratio 7:3): preferably 0.05-0.15, more preferably 0.1%.<br>
The preservative used is preferably a combination of edetic acid (for example, as the disodium salt) and benzalkonium chloride. In this combination, the edetic acid is preferably used in a concentration of 0.05 to 0.1%, benzalkonium chloride preferably being used in a concentration of 0.005 to 0.05%, more preferably 0.01%.<br>
In the case of solutions/suspensions reference is always made to percent by weight/volume, in the case of sohd or semi-solid formulations to percent by weight/weight of the formulation.<br>
Further auxiliary substances which may, for example, be used for the formulations of the invention are: polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sorbitan fatty acid esters such as sorbitan trioleate, polyethoxylated sorbitan fatty acid esters (for example polyefhoxylated sorbitan trioleate), sorbimacrogol oleate, synthetic amphotensides (tritons), ethylene oxide ethers of octylphenolformaldehyde condensation products, phosphatides such as lecithin, polyethoxylated fats, polyethoxylated oleotriglycerides and polyethoxylated fatty alcohols. In this context, polyethoxylated means that the relevant substances contain polyoxyethylene chains, the degree of polymerisation of which is generally between 2 to 40, in particular between 10 to 20. These substances are preferably used to improve the solubility of the azelastine component.<br>
It is optionally possible to use additional isotonization agents. Isotonization agents which may, for example, be used are: saccharose, glucose, glycerine, sorbitol, 1,2-propylene<br><br>
4<br>
glycol and NaCl.<br>
The isotonization agents adjust the osmotic pressure of the formulations to the same osmotic pressure as nasal secretion. For this purpose these substances are in each case to be used in such amount that, for example, in the case of a solution, a reduction in the freezing point of 0.50 to 0.56 degree C is attained in comparison to pure water.<br>
In Example 1, it is possible to use instead of NaCl per 100 ml of solution, for example: Glucose 1H20 3.81g; saccharose 635%; glycerine 2.2g; 1,2-propylene glycol 1.617g; sorbitol 3.84g (in the case of mixtures of these substances correspondingly less may optionally be used).<br>
Moreover, it is possible to add thickening agents to solutions according to the present invention to prevent the solution from flowing out of the nose too quickly and to give the solution a viscosity of about 1.5 to 3, preferably 2 mPa.<br>
Such thickening agents may, for example, be: cellulose derivatives (for example cellulose ether) in which the cellulose-hydroxy groups are partially etherified with lower unsaturated aliphatic alcohols and/or lower unsaturated aliphatic oxyalcohols (for example methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose), gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, tragacanth, ethoxose (water soluble binding and thickening agents on the basis of ethyl cellulose), alginic acid, polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylic acid, pectin and equivalent agents. Should these substances contain acid groups, the corresponding physio logically acceptable salts may also be used.<br>
In the event of the use of hydroxypropyl cellulose, 0.1% by weight of the formulation, for example, is used for this purpose.<br>
In the event of the use of Avicel RC 591 or CL11, 0.65-3.0% by weight of the formulation, for example, is used for the purpose.<br>
It is also possible to add to the formulations buffer substances such as citric<br>
acid/sodium    hydrogensulphate    borate    buffer,	phosphates	(sodium<br>
hydrogenorthophosphate, disodium hydrogenphosphate), trometamol or equivalent conventional buffers in order, for example, to adjust the formulations to a pH value of 3 to 7, preferably 4.5 to 6.5.<br>
The amount of citric acid is, for example, 0.01 to 0.14g, preferably 0.04 to 0.05g, the amount of disodium hydrogenphosphate 0.1 to 0.5g, preferably 0.2 to 0.3g per 100 ml of solution. The weights given relate in each case to the anhydrous substances.<br><br>
5<br>
In the case of solutions and suspensions, the maximum total concentration of active agent and buffer is preferably less than 5%, in particular less than 2% (weight/volume).<br>
For the nasal application, a solution or suspension can preferably be used which is applied as an aerosol, i.e. in the form of a fine dispersion in air or in another conventional carrier gas, for example by means of a conventional pump vaporizer.<br>
Application as a dosage aerosol is, however, also possible. Dosage aerosols are defined as being pressure packings which contain the azelastine or its salts in combination with steroid, in the form of a solution or suspension in a so-called propellant The propellant may be a pressurized liquid chlorinated, fluorinated hydrocarbon or mixtures of various chlorinated, fluorinated hydrocarbons as well as propane, butane, isobutene or mixtures of these among themselves or with chlorinated, fluorinated hydrocarbons which are gaseous at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), such as HFC 134a, and HFC 227a can also be used, and are preferred for environmental reasons. The pressure packing has a dosage or metering valve which, on actuation, releases a defined amount of the solution or suspension of the medicament. The subsequent very sudden vaporization of the propellant tears the solution or suspension of azelastine into the finest droplets or minute particles which can be sprayed in the nose or which are available for inspiration into the nose. Certain plastic applicators may be used to actuate the valve and to convey the sprayed suspension into the nose.<br>
In the case of application as an aerosol, it is also possible to use a conventional adapter.<br>
