				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
METHOD OF PROCESSING DATA IN A RECEIVER APPARATUS WITHIN A<br>
WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AND RECEIVER APPARATUS<br>
THEREFOR<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1] The present invention relates to a data processing apparatus and method in a<br>
wireless communication system and, more particularly, to an error processing<br>
apparatus and method for processing data unit associated with, for example, AMR<br>
(Adaptive Multi Rate) codec.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2] A universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS) is a European-type, third<br>
generation IMT-2000 mobile communication system that has evolved from a European<br>
standard known as Global System for Mobile communications (GSM). UMTS is<br>
intended to provide an improved mobile communication service based upon a GSM<br>
core network and wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA) wireless<br>
connection technology.<br>
[3] In December 1998, a Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) was formed<br>
by the ETSI of Europe, the ARIB/TTC of Japan, the T1 of the United States, and the<br>
TTA of Korea. The 3GPP creates detailed specifications of UMTS technology. In<br>
order to achieve rapid and efficient technical development of the UMTS, five technical<br>
specification groups (TSG) have been created within the 3GPP for standardizing the<br>
UMTS by considering the independent nature of the network elements and their<br>
operations.<br>
[4] Each TSG develops, approves, and manages the standard specification within a<br>
related region. Among these groups, the radio access network (RAN) group<br>
(TSG-RAN) develops the standards for the functions, requirements, and interface of<br>
the UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN 100), which is a new radio access<br>
network for supporting W-CDMA access technology in the UMTS.<br>
[5] Figure 1 illustrates an exemplary basic structure of a general UMTS network.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the UMTS is roughly divided into a terminal or user equipment<br>
(UE) 50, a UTRAN 100, and a core network (CN) 200.<br>
[6] The UTRAN 100 includes one or more radio network sub-systems (RNS) 110.<br>
Each RNS 110 includes a radio network controller (RNC) 111 and a plurality of Node-<br>
Bs 112 managed by the RNC 111. The RNC 111 handles the assignment and<br>
management of radio resources and operates as an access point with respect to the core<br>
network 200.<br>
[7] The Node-Bs 112 receive information sent by the physical layer of the terminal<br>
50 through an uplink, and transmit data to the terminal 50 through a downlink. The<br>
Node-Bs 112 operate as access points of the UTRAN 100 for the terminal 50:<br>
[8] The services provided to a specific terminal 50 are roughly divided into the<br>
circuit switched (CS) services and the packet switched (PS) services. For example, a<br>
general voice conversation service is a circuit switched service, while a Web browsing<br>
service via an Internet connection is classified as a packet switched (PS) service.<br>
[9] For supporting circuit switched services, the RNCs 111 are connected to the<br>
MSC 210 of the core network 200, and the MSC 210 is connected to the GMSC 220<br>
that manages the connection with other networks.<br>
[10] For supporting packet switched services, the RNCs 111 are connected to the<br>
SGSN 230 and the GGSN 240 of the core network 200. The SGSN 230 supports the<br>
packet communications with the RNCs 111 and the GGSN 240 manages the<br>
connection with other packet switched networks, such as the Internet.<br>
[11] Various types of interfaces exist to allow the network components to transmit<br>
and receive information to and from each other for mutual communication. An<br>
interface between the RNC 111 and the core network 200 is defined as an Iu interface.<br>
In particular, the Iu interface between the RNCs 111 and the core network 200 for<br>
packet switched systems is defined as "Iu-PS," and the Iu interface between the RNCs<br>
111 and the core network 200 for circuit switched systems is defined as "Iu-CS."<br>
[12] Figure 2 illustrates a structure of a radio interface protocol between the terminal<br>
50 and the UTRAN 100 according to the 3GPP radio access network standards. As<br>
shown in Figure 2, the radio interface protocol has horizontal layers comprising a<br>
physical layer, a data link layer, and a network layer, and has vertical planes<br>
comprising a user plane (U-plane) for transmitting user data and a control plane<br>
(C-plane) for transmitting control information.<br>
[13] The user plane is a region that handles traffic information with the user, such as<br>
voice or Internet protocol (IP) packets. The control plane is a region that handles<br>
control information for an interface with a network, maintenance and management of a<br>
call, and the like.<br>
[14] The protocol layers in Figure 2 can be divided into a first layer (L1), a second<br>
layer (L2), and a third layer (L3) based on the three lower layers of an open system in-<br>
terconnection (OSI) standard model.<br>
[15] The first layer (L1), namely, the physical layer, provides an information transfer<br>
service to an upper layer by using various radio transmission techniques. The physical<br>
layer is connected to an upper layer called a medium access control (MAC) layer, via a<br>
transport channel. The MAC layer and the physical layer exchange data via the<br>
transport channel.<br>
[16] The second layer (L2) includes a MAC layer, a radio link control (RLC) layer, a<br>
broadcast/multicast control (BMC) layer, and a packet data convergence protocol<br>
(PDCP) layer.<br>
[17] The MAC layer handles mapping between logical channels and transport<br>
channels and provides allocation of the MAC parameters for allocation and re-<br>
allocation of radio resources. The MAC layer is connected to an upper layer called the<br>
radio link control (RLC) layer, via a logical channel.<br>
[18] Various logical channels are provided according to the type of information<br>
transmitted. In general, a control channel is used to transmit information of the control<br>
plane and a traffic channel is used to transmit information of the user plane.<br>
[19] A logical channel may be a common channel or a dedicated channel depending<br>
on whether the logical channel is shared. Logical channels include a dedicated traffic<br>
channel (DTCH), a dedicated control channel (DCCH), a common traffic channel<br>
(CTCH), a common control channel (CCCH), a broadcast control channel (BCCH),<br>
and a paging control channel (PCCH). The BCCH provides information including in-<br>
formation utilized by a terminal 50 to access a system. The PCCH is used by the<br>
UTRAN 100 to access a terminal 50.<br>
[20] The MAC layer is connected to the physical layer by transport channels and can<br>
be divided into a MAC-b sub-layer, a MAC-d. sub-layer, a MAC-c/sh sub-layer, and a<br>
MAC-hs sub-layer according to the type of transport channel being managed. The<br>
MAC-b sub-layer manages a BCH (Broadcast Channel), which is a transport channel<br>
handling the broadcasting of system information. The MAC-c/sh sub-layer manages a<br>
common transport channel, such as a forward access channel (FACH) or a downlink<br>
shared channel (DSCH), which is shared by a plurality of terminals. The MAC-d sub-<br>
layer manages a dedicated channel (DCH), which is a dedicated transport channel for a<br>
specific terminal 50.<br>
[21] The RLC layer supports reliable data transmissions and performs segmentation<br>
and concatenation on a plurality of RLC service data units (RLC SDUs) delivered<br>
from an upper layer. When the RLC layer receives the RLC SDUs from the upper<br>
layer, the RLC layer adjusts the size of each RLC SDU in an appropriate manner based<br>
upon processing capacity and then creates data units by adding header information<br>
thereto. The data units, called protocol data units (PDUs), are transferred to the MAC<br>
layer via a logical channel. The RLC layer includes a RLC buffer for storing the RLC<br>
SDUs and/or the RLC PDUs.<br>
[22] Each RLC PDU transferred to the MAC layer is called a MAC SDU. The terms<br>
"MAC SDU" and "RLC PDU" are synonymous. The MAC layer may generate a MAC<br>
PDU by ailing a header to the MAC SDU. The MAC layer transmits the MAC PDU<br>
to the physical layer through a suitable transport channel.<br>
[23] Figure 3 illustrates a format of the MAC PDU. The MAC layer identifies the<br>
UEs 50 and the logical channels. There are two reasons for identification. First, the<br>
UEs 50 must be distinguished from one another since many UEs share a common<br>
transport channel. Second, the logical channels must be distinguished from one another<br>
because logical channel multiplexing is performed. With regard to the uplink, the<br>
receiving end (i.e., the UTRAN 100) cannot determine which UE 50 sent the data units<br>
nor which logical channel was used to send the data units without any identification.<br>
[24] The MAC layer adds one or more identification parameters to form a header of<br>
the MAC PDU; a TCTF (target channel type field), a UE-ID type, a UE-ID, and/or a<br>
GT (Control/Traffic) field. In the related art, a MAC healer is added to each MAC<br>
SDU (Service Data Unit) within a MAC PDU such that MAC SDUs that are<br>
transmitted during the same TTI (transmission time interval) have different MAC<br>
headers added thereto.<br>
[25] Identification of the UE 50 (i.e., a UE-ID field) is necessary when a dedicated<br>
logical channel (such as DCCH or DTCH) is mapped to a common transport channel<br>
(such as the RACH, FACH, CPCH, DSCH or USCH). To identify the UE 50, the<br>
MAC layer may add a radio network temporary identity (RNTI), which is one type of<br>
UE identification, to the UE-ID field of the header. There are three types of RNTIs; a<br>
U-RNTI (UTRAN RNTI), a C-RNTI (Cell RNTI), and a DSCH-RNTI. Thus, a UE-ID<br>
type field that indicates the type of RNTI added is also transmitted as part of the<br>
header.<br>
[26] There are two types of identifications for a logical channel; a TCTF and a GT<br>
field. The TCTF is required for the transport channel when a dedicated logical channel<br>
(such as a DCCH and DTCH) is mapped together with other logical channels.<br>
[27] Referring to FDD (Frequency Division Duplex), the TCTF for the FACH<br>
identifies the mapped logical channel as a BCCH, a CCCH, or a CTCH, or as a<br>
dedicated logical channel (DCCH or DTCH), while the TCTF for the RACH identifies<br>
the mapped logical channel as a CCCH or a dedicated logical channel. However, the<br>
TCTF does not identify the particular type of dedicated logical channel that was used.<br>
[28] The identification of a dedicated logical channel is provided by the C/T field.<br>
The C/T field is required because, unlike other logical channels, several dedicated<br>
logical channels can be mapped to one transport channel. Each of the dedicated logical<br>
channels mapped to one transport channel has a logical channel identifier, which is<br>
used as the C/T field value. However, if only one dedicated logical channel is mapped<br>
to one transport channel, the C/T field is not necessary.<br>
[29] Table 1 below shows the different identifiers of a MAC header that are used<br>
according to the mapping relationship between logical channels and transport channels<br>
for FDD. In Table 1, a C/T field exists when several dedicated logical channels<br>
(DCCH or DTCH) are mapped. Also, "N' indicates that there is no header, "-"<br>
indicates that there is no mapping relationship, and "UE-ID" indicates that bC/Th a UE-<br>
ID field and a UE-ID type field exist. A UE-ID field always exists together with a UE-<br>
ID type field.<br><br>
[30] The RLC layer will be explained in more detail as follows.<br>
[31] A basic function of the RLC layer is to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of<br>
each radio bearer (RB) and their corresponding data transmissions. Since the RB<br>
service is a service that the second layer of the radio protocol provides to higher layers,<br>
the entire second layer affects the QoS. In particular, the RLC layer has significant<br>
influence on the QoS.<br>
[32] The RLC provides an independent RLC entity for each RB in order to guarantee<br>
the particular QoS of the RB. Three RLC modes are provided to support various types<br>
of QoS; a transparent mode (TM), an unacknowledged mode (UM), and an ac-<br>
knowledged mode (AM). Since the three RLC modes (TM, UM, AM) support<br>
different QoS requirements, there are differences in their operation and the specific<br>
functions performed by each. The particular RLC for each mode is referred to as TM<br>
RLC, UM RLC, and AM RLC.<br>
[33] In the transparent mode (TM), a TM RLC adds no protocol overhead to the<br>
RLC SDU that is transferred from a higher (upper) layer such that the TM RLC lets the<br>
SDU pass "transparently." Because data processing time at the TM RLC is short, real-<br>
time circuit data transmissions, such as voice and streaming data in the circuit service<br>
domain (CS domain), are handled in the user plane. Because there is no protocol<br>
overhead within the TM RLC, uplink transmission of RRC messages from an un-<br>
specified terminal 50 and downlink transmission of RRC messages that are broadcast<br>
to all terminals (UE) 50 within a cell are handled in the control plane.<br>
[34] Unlike the transparent mode, protocol overhead is added at the corresponding<br>
RLC in a non-transparent mode. Nan-transparent modes are divided into an unac-<br>
knowledged mode (UM) and an acknowledged mode (AM). Unacknowledged mode<br>
provides no reception acknowledgement for the transferred data, while acknowledged<br>
mode provides acknowledgement for the transferred data.<br>
[35] In unacknowledged mode, a UM RLC adds a PDU header including a sequence<br>
number (SN) to each PDU that is transferred, thereby allowing the receiving side to<br>
identify which PDUs were lost during transmission. The user plane handles broadcast/<br>
multicast data transmissions or real-time packet data transmissions, such as voice (e.g.,<br>
VoIP) and streaming data in the packet service domain (PS domain). The control plane<br>
handles transmission of those RRC messages, among all RRC messages delivered to a<br>
specific terminal 50 or terminal group within a cell region, that need no ac-<br>
knowledgement response.<br>
[36] As in UM, a PDU header including SN is added to construct a PDU in ac-<br>
knowledged mode. However, unlike UM, a receiving side provides reception ac-<br>
knowledgement of the PDU sent from a transmitting side. In AM, the receiving side<br>
provides acknowledgement in order to request re-transmission of any PDUs that have<br>
not been properly received. This function of re-transmission is the distinguishing char-<br>
acteristic of an AM RLC. The object of an AM RLC is to guarantee error-free data<br>
transfers through re-transmissions. To achieve error-free data transfers, the user plane<br>
handles transmission of non-real-time packet data, such as TC/TP in the PS domain,<br>
and the control plane handles transmission of those RRC messages, among all the RRC<br>
messages transmitted to a specific terminal 50, that require acknowledgement.<br>
[37] When data is received from a peer (i.e., another party) through a wireless<br>
section, the physical layer performs a CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Code) check on data<br>
blocks to determine whether there is an error in each data block. If an error is detected,<br>
the physical layer transfers the CRC error information together with a corresponding<br>
data block to the MAC layer.<br>
[38] Upon receiving a MAC PDU together with the CRC error information from the<br>
physical layer, the MAC layer determines that the corresponding PDU is an erroneous<br>
PDU and discards the corresponding MAC PDU. If there is no CRC error information<br>
on the MAC PDU, the MAC layer transfers the MAC PDU to the RLC layer as soon as<br>
it is received.<br>
[39] Since data with a CRC error is discarded in the MAC layer, when RLC PDUs<br>
are transferred from the MAC layer, the RLC layer considers them as normal PDUs<br>
and processes the PDUs according to a normal PDU processing procedure.<br>
[40] The above-described data processing procedure follows initial standards. Data<br>
processing procedures of the MAC layer and the RLC layer have been modified to<br>
support an adaptive multi rate (AMR) codec. An AMR codec is a voice com-<br>
munication (speech) codec of the UMTS standardized by ETSI that applies a bit rate<br>
allocation between a voice and a channel coding to optimize speech quality in various<br>
wireless channel states. In an AMR codec, the received data is used even if the data<br>
has an error. If the received data is usable by the AMR codec, but is discarded only<br>
because it has a CRC error, wired/wireless resources are wasted. Accordingly, in order<br>
to effectively support (he AMR codec, operations of the MAC layer and the RLC layer<br>
are modified.<br>
[41] If the MAC PDU transferred from the physical layer contains a CRC error, the<br>
MAC layer transfers the corresponding PDU to the RLC layer. When the MAC layer<br>
transfers the PDU containing a CRC error to the RLC layer, it informs the RLC layer<br>
of the existence of the CRC error so that the RLC layer can suitably process the cor-<br>
responding PDU. However, this process indicates only that there is an error in the PDU<br>
and fails to indicate which part of the PDU is erroneous.<br>
[42] If a received MAC PDU containing a CRC error includes a header, the MAC<br>
layer cannot rely on the header of the received MAC PDU because it may be<br>
erroneous. Because the header may be erroneous, the MAC layer cannot check<br>
whether the MAC PDU has reached the intended destination (or a target UE 50) nor<br>
determine through which logical channel to the RLC layer it is to transfer the MAC<br>
SDU included in the MAC PDU. Therefore, the MAC layer discards the corresponding<br>
MAC PDU.<br>
[43] If the RLC layer is in the TM state and a PDU received from the MAC layer<br>
contains a CRC error, the RLC layer operates according to a pre-set value of a variable<br>
(for example, error handling scheme) for processing data with errors, referred to as a<br>
"delivery of erroneous SDUs." The delivery of erroneous SDUs is not set in every TM<br>
RLC, but rather is set only when a logical channel connected to the TM RLC is a<br>
dedicated traffic channel (DTCH).<br>
[44] The delivery of erroneous SDUs is set for a TM RLC using the DTCH and has<br>
three possible pre-set values; no, yes, and no detect. The pre-set values of delivery of<br>
erroneous SDUs are set by the RRC at an initial stage of setting a RB and the RRC<br>
transfers the information to the MAC layer. The RLC layer processes the error-<br>
containing PDU according to a value set for the delivery of erroneous SDUs.<br>
[45] If the delivery of erroneous SDUs is set as "no," the TM RLC checks the CRC<br>
error information transferred together with the PDU from the MAC layer. If the cor-<br>
responding PDU is contains an error, the TM RLC discards the corresponding PDU<br>
immediately.<br>
[46] If the delivery of erroneous SDUs is set as "yes," the TM RLC checks the CRC<br>
error information transferred together with the PDU from the MAC layer. If the cor-<br>
responding PDU contains an error, the TM RLC informs an upper layer that the PDU<br>
contains an error when transmitting the PDU to the upper layer.<br>
[47] If the delivery of erroneous SDUs is set as "no detect," the TM RLC does not<br>
check the CRC error information which has been received together with the PDU from<br>
the MAC layer and processes the PDU containing the error as a normal PDU and<br>
transfers it to the upper layer.<br>
[48] Figure 4 is a flow chart of a related art data processing method 200 of the MAC<br>
layer.<br>
[49] When the MAC PDU is transferred from a lower layer (step S210), the MAC<br>
layer checks whether there is a CRC error in the received MAC PDU (step S220).<br>
[50] If the received MAC PDU does not have an error, the MAC layer processes the<br>
MAC PDU according to a normal processing procedure (step S230). If, however, there<br>
is an error in the MAC PDU, the MAC layer checks whether there is a MAC header in<br>
the received MAC PDU (step S240).<br>
[51] If there is no MAC header in the received MAC PDU, the MAC layer processes<br>
the MAC PDU according to the normal processing procedure (step S230). If there is a<br>
MAC header in the MAC PDU, the MAC layer discards the MAC PDU (step S250).<br>
[52] Figure 5 is a flow chart of a related art data processing method 300 of the RLC<br>
layer.<br>
[53] When an RLC PDU is transferred from the MAC layer (step S310), the RLC<br>
layer checks whether a variable (delivery of erroneous SDUs) for processing error data<br>
has been set (step S320).<br>
[54] If the variable has been set, the RLC layer processes a received RLC PDU<br>
according to a set error data processing procedure (step S340). If the variable has not<br>
been set, the RLC layer processes the received RLC PDU according to a normal<br>
processing procedure (step S330).<br>
[55] When the MAC layer and the RLC layer process the PDU in the above-<br>
described manner, the MAC layer transfers a corresponding MAC PDU to the RLC<br>
layer even if there is an error in the MAC PDU received from the physical layer as<br>
long as there is no MAC header in the MAC PDU. If there is no header in the MAC<br>
PDU, the transport channel and the logical channel are mapped in a 1:1 ratio.<br>
[56] For example, there are various channel combinations such DTCH-DCH,<br>
DCCH-DCH, PCCH-PCH and BCCH-BCH. Among them, only the DTCH-DCH<br>
combination is related to the AMR codec. The variable (delivery of erroneous SDUs)<br>
is set and the AMR codec uses data with a CRC error only when the RLC layer is in<br>
the TM state and data transmission is made through the DTCH-DCH channel<br>
combination.<br>
[57] Though not related to the AMR codec, a MAC PDU containing an error can be<br>
transferred to the RLC layer when the RLC layer is in the TM state and data<br>
transmission is made through the DCCH-DCH, PCCH-PCH or BCCH-BCH channel<br>
combination. Furthermore, a MAC PDU containing an error can be transferred to the<br>
RLC layer when the RLC layer is in an AM state or in an UM state and data<br>
transmission is made through the DTCH-DCH or DCCH-DCH channel combination.<br>
In these situations, because the RLC layer is not related to the AMR codec, the<br>
variable (delivery of erroneous SDUs) is not set and the RLC layer handles the data<br>
containing a CRC error as normal data and processes it. When the RLC layer handles<br>
the data containing a CRC error (i.e., CRC error data) as normal data, problems may<br>
arise.<br>
[58] When the RLC layer is in the TM state, the data transferred through the DCCH,<br>
PCCH and BCCH is the data that the RRC layer uses to manage radio resources. If the<br>
TM RLC transfers CRC error data transferred through such channels to the RRC layer,<br>
the TM RLC operates properly. However, the CRC error data transferred to the RRC<br>
layer may cause the RRC layer to malfunction or cause a communication error if the<br>
RRC layer uses an incorrect variable.<br>
[59] Furthermore, when the RLC layer is in the AM state or in the UM state, the<br>
existence of an RLC header may cause problems in the RLC layer. The AM RLC or<br>
UM RLC codes data using the SN included in the header and updates its own security<br>
environment set information. If there is an error in the SN, coding cannot be performed<br>
properly and synchronization of the security environment set information between the<br>
terminal 50 and the UTRAN 100 cannot be properly achieved. Restoration of coded<br>
data transmitted thereafter would not be possible, leading to communication errors.<br>
[60] Moreover, the PDU header of the AM RLC or UM RLC has information<br>
regarding the boundary surfaces (regions) of the SDU included in the PDU. If the CRC<br>
error data is related to the SDU boundary surface information, the RLC layer cannot<br>
reconstruct the RLC SDU to its original form and serious communication errors may<br>
occur.<br>
Disclosure<br>
[61] An object of the present invention is to provide a data processing method for<br>
supporting a codec that determines whether detected error data is related to the codec.<br>
The error data is transferred to an upper layer only when it is related to the codec.<br>
[62] In one aspect of the invention, a data processing method is provided which<br>
determines whether error data transferred to a specific protocol layer is to be provided<br>
to a codec. If the transferred data is to be provided to the codec, the data is processed<br>
according to an error data processing procedure. If the transferred data is not to be<br>
provided to a codec, the data is discarded.<br>
[63] In a preferred embodiment, a method of processing data in a receiver apparatus<br>
used in a wireless communication system is provided. The data processing method<br>

RLC layer that the CRC check result sent from the MAC layer mat indicates whether<br>
the data unit has an error; and discarding the data unit when the data unit has error and<br>
when an error handling scheme is not provided. Preferably, the error handling scheme<br>
comprises an instruction associated with a delivery of erroneous SDU. The data unit<br>
comprises a protocol data unit.<br>
[64] According to one aspect of the invention, when the data unit has error by<br>
examining the CRC check result and when the error handling scheme is provided, then<br>
the error handling scheme indicates one of deliver the data unit to a higher layer with<br>
an error indication, discard the data unit, and deliver the data unit to a higher layer<br>
without an error indication.<br>
[65] According to another embodiment of the invention, a method of processing data<br>

a second manner, the selection of one of the first manner and the second manner based<br>
upon at least an operation mode. Preferably, the data unit is processed in the first<br>
manner if the operation mode is one of unacknowledged mode (UM) and ac-<br>
knowledged mode (AM), and the data unit is processed in the second manner if the<br>
operation mode is transparent mode (TM).<br>
[66] According to one aspect of the invention, the first manner comprises discarding<br>
the data unit in the RLC layer. The second manner comprises checking whether an<br>
error handling scheme has been provided. If the error handling scheme is not provided,<br>
the data unit is discarded. If the error handling scheme is provided, then the data unit is<br>
processed according to the error handling scheme. Preferably, the error handling<br>
scheme comprises an instruction associated with a delivery of erroneous SDU. The<br>
delivery of erroneous SDU instruction indicates one of deliver an erroneous SDU to a<br>
higher layer with an error indication, discard an erroneous SDU, and deliver an<br>
erroneous SDU to a higher layer without an error indication.<br>
[67] According to another aspect of the invention, the data unit received from the<br>
MAC layer does not include a header information associated with the MAC layer. Al-<br>
ternatively, the data unit received from the MAC layer is associated with a logical<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
[83] The present invention relates to a data processing method for supporting an AMR<br>
codec that determines whether detected error data is related to a codec such that the<br>
error data is transferred to an upper layer only when it is related to the codec. The<br>
present invention allows the RLC layer or the MAC layer to prevent transfer, to the<br>
upper layer, of protocol data units having CRC errors that have been processed ir-<br>
respective of the codec.<br>
[84] Referring to Figure 6, a flow chart of a data processing method 400 in<br>
accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. Specifically,<br>
the method 400 is a data processing method of the MAC layer for supporting data<br>
associated with, for example, the speech codec, such as AMR. However, the present<br>
invention may be also applicable to data associated with real time data, stream data,<br>
data encoded with various types of codec, etc.<br>
[85] When a MAC PDU is received from a lower layer, such as a physical layer,<br>
(step S410), the MAC layer checks whether there is a CRC error in the received MAC<br>
PDU (step S420). If there is no error in the received MAC PDU, the MAC layer<br>
processes the received MAC PDU according to a normal processing procedure (step<br>
S430). If there is an error in the MAC PDU, the MAC layer checks whether there is a<br>
MAC header in the received MAC PDU (step S440).<br>
[86] If there is a MAC header in the MAC PDU, the MAC layer discards the MAC<br>
PDU (step S450). If there is no MAC header in the MAC PDU, the MAC layer checks<br>
whether an error handling scheme (for example, instruction or parameter related to<br>
delivery of erroneous SDUs or data units) for processing error data has been set (step<br>
S460). The absence of a MAC header means that the mapping of the transport channel<br>
and the logical channel at a 1:1 ratio. In other words, there is no multiplexing of<br>
multiple logical channels into one transport channel. Because of such relationship, the<br>
MAC header is not necessary since the MAC header identifies a plurality of logical<br>
channel data mapped into, for example, one transport channel.<br>
[87] If the error handling scheme is not set or, alternatively, not configured, the<br>
MAC layer discards the received MAC PDU (step S450). If the error handling scheme<br>
has been set, the MAC layer processes the received MAC PDU according to a set error<br>
data processing procedure (step S480).<br>
[88] If the error handling scheme for processing the error data has been set, the state<br>
of the error handling scheme (for example, yes; no; no detect) provides instructions to<br>
the MAC layer. There are three possible error handling schemes; deliver the data unit<br>
to a higher layer with an error indication, discard the data unit, and deliver the data unit<br>
to a higher layer without an error indication.<br>
[89] Accordingly, if the data contains a CRC error, only the data that the upper layer<br>
requests is processed according to the set error data processing procedure and<br>
transferred to the RLC layer. If there is a CRC error in the received data, the MAC<br>
layer determines whether the received data is related to the AMR codec. The MAC<br>
layer transfers the received data to the RLC layer preferably when the data is related to<br>
the AMR codec. This is because the data related to the AMR codec or speech data is<br>
preferably mapped from a logical channel to a transport channel (which is preferably<br>
performed in the MAC layer) in a 1:1 ratio, thus eliminating the need for a MAC<br>
header information.<br>
[90] Referring to Figure 7, a flow chart of a data processing method 500 in the RLC<br>
layer in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention is illustrated.<br>
Specifically, the method 500 is a data processing method of the RLC layer for<br>
supporting data associated with the speech codec, such as AMR.<br>
[91] When an RLC PDU is received from the MAC layer (step S510), the RLC layer<br>
examines the CRC check result to determine whether there is error in the received<br>
RLC PDU (step S520). If there is no error in the RLC PDU, the RLC layer processes<br>
the received RLC PDU according to a normal processing procedure (step S530). If<br>
there is error in the received RLC PDU, the RLC layer checks whether an error<br>
handling scheme (for example, instruction or parameter related to delivery of<br>
erroneous SDUs or data units) for processing error data has been set (step S540).<br>
[92] If the error handling scheme has not been set or, alternatively, not configured, in<br>
the RLC layer, the RLC layer discards the received RLC PDU (step S550). If the error<br>
handling scheme has been set, the RLC layer processes the received RLC PDU<br>
according to the set error data processing procedure (step S560).<br>
[93] If the error handling; scheme for processing the error data has been set, the state<br>
of the error handling scheme (for example, yes; no; no detect) provides instructions to<br>
the RLC layer. There are three possible error handling schemes; deliver the data unit to<br>
a higher layer with an error indication, discard the data unit, and deliver the data unit to<br>
a higher layer without an error indication.<br>
[94] It should be noted that the checking of me 'error data processing procedure' of<br>
the environment set up might be omitted in certain circumstances. This is because the<br>
data transferred to the AMR codec is transferred via the DTCH among the logical<br>
channels, and of the three types of modes, the RLC only operates in TM. Namely, if<br>
the RLC operates in TM and when a PDU is received through a logical channel other<br>
than the DTCH, or if the RLC operates in AM or UM and the PDU is received via any<br>
logical channel, the RLC may discard the error data simultaneously upon receipt<br>
thereof. Here, it can be considered that the 'error data processing procedure' is set to<br>
be an 'error data discard procedure,' and thus the environment set up for such<br>
situations is not necessary.<br>
[95] Accordingly, if the data contains a CRC error, only the data that the upper layer<br>
(such as RRC layer) requests is processed according to the set error data processing<br>
procedure and transferred to the RLC layer. If there is a CRC error in the received<br>
data, the RLC layer determines whether the received data is related to the AMR codec.<br>
The MAC layer transfers the received data to the RLC layer only when the data is<br>
related to the AMR codec. This is because the data related to the AMR codec or<br>
speech data is preferably mapped from a logical channel to a transport channel (which<br>
is preferably performed in the MAC layer) in a 1:1 ratio, thus eliminating the need for<br>
a MAC header information. Also, the speech data may be either partially or fully<br>
recovered in a receiver device despite error contained therein by using certain<br>
decoding process.<br>
[96] Figure 8 illustrates a flow chart of a data processing method 600 in the RLC<br>
layer in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[97] When an RLC PDU is transferred to the RLC layer from the MAC layer (step<br>
S610), the RLC layer examines the CRC check result to determine whether there is<br>
error in the received RLC PDU (step S620). If there is no error in the RLC PDU, the<br>
RLC layer processes the received RLC PDU according to a normal processing<br>
procedure (step S630). If there is error in the received RLC PDU, the RLC layer<br>
checks whether the presentstate is AM or UM state (step S640). If either the AM or<br>
UM state, the RLC layer discards the PDU received from the MAC layer (step S670).<br>
If the RLC layer is in the TM state and the error handling scheme (for example,<br>
delivery of erroneous SDUs) is configured the RLC layer processes the PDU according<br>
to predetermined error data processing procedure (step S660). If the error handling<br>
scheme is not configured, then the RLC layer discards the received RLC PDU (step<br>
S670).<br>
[98] If the error handling scheme for processing the error data has been set, the state<br>
of the error handling scheme provides instructions to the RLC layer. Similar to the<br>
above, there are three possible error handling scheme states; deliver the data unit to a<br>
higher layer with an error indication, discard the data unit, and deliver the data unit to a<br>
higher layer without an error indication.<br>
[99] Figure 9 illustrates a block diagram of mobile station according to the preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention. BC/Th the mobile station and the network system<br>
may utilize the present invention. Referring to Figure 9, the mobile station 700<br>
comprises a processor (or digital signal processor) 710, RF module 735, power<br>
management module 705, antenna 740, battery 755, display 715, keypad 720, memory<br>
730, SIM card 725 (which may be optional), speaker 745 and microphone 750.<br>
[100] A user enters instructional information, such as a telephone number, for<br>
example, by pushing the buttons of a keypad 720 or by voice activation using the<br>
microphone 750. The microprocessor 710 receives and processes the instructional in-<br>
formation to perform the appropriate function, such as to dial the telephone number.<br>
Operational data may be retrieved from the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card 725<br>
or the memory module 730 to perform the function. Furthermore, the processor 710<br>
may display the instructional and operational information on the display 715 for the<br>
user's reference and convenience.<br>
[101] The processor 710 issues instructional information to the RF section 735, to<br>
initiate communication, for example, transmit radio signals comprising voice com-<br>
munication data. The RF section 735 comprises a receiver and a transmitter to receive<br>
and transmit radio signals. An antenna 740 facilitates the transmission and reception of<br>
radio signals. Upon receiving radio signals, the RF module 735 may forward and<br>
convert the signals to baseband frequency for processing by the processor 710. The<br>
processed signals would be transformed into audible or readable information outputted<br>
via the speaker 745, for example.<br>
[102] It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention can be readily implemented using, for example, the processor 710 or<br>
other data or digital processing device, either alone or in combination with external<br>
support logic.<br>
[103] Although the present invention is described in the context of mobile com-<br>
munication, the present invention may also be used in any wireless communication<br>
systems using mobile devices, such as PDAs and laptop computers equipped with<br>
wireless communication capabilities. Moreover, the use of certain terms to describe the<br>
present invention should not limit the scope of the present invention to certain type of<br>
mobile communication system, such as cdma2000. The present invention is also<br>
applicable to other wireless communication systems using different air interfaces and/<br>
or physical layers, for example, TDMA, CDMA, FDMA, WCDMA, etc.<br>
[104] The preferred embodiments may be implemented as a method, apparatus or<br>
article of manufacture using standard programming and/or engineering techniques to<br>
produce software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof. The term "article<br>
of manufacture" as used herein refers to code or logic implemented in hardware logic<br>

Industrial Applicability<br>
[106] As so far described, the data processing methods of the present invention have the<br>
following advantages. The problem of the conventional art, regarding malfunction at<br>
the RRC layer and the RLC layer caused by transferring data containing error to an<br>
upper layer without considering whether the data is for AMR codec, is alleviated.<br>
Furthermore, the efficiency of wired/wireless resources can be improved and wired/<br>
wireless resources can be effectively managed.<br>

13. The method as claimed in claim 12, wherein the data unit is discarded in the event of the error<br>
handling scheme being not provided.<br>
14. The method as claimed in claim 12, wherein the data unit is processed according to the error<br>
handling scheme in the event of the error handling scheme being provided.<br>
15. A method of processing data by a radio link control (RLC) entity, the method comprising :<br>
receiving a radio link control protocol data unit (RLC PDU) having a cyclic redundancy code<br>
(CRC) error; and<br>
selectively processing the RLC PDU having the CRC error either in a first manner or in a second<br>
manner according to whether the RLC entity is in non-transparent mode or in transparent mode,<br>
wherein the first manner is performed when the RLC entity is in non-transparent mode, such that<br>
the RLC PDU is discarded, and<br>
wherein the second manner is performed when the RLC entity is in transparent mode, such that<br>
the RLC PDU is either further processed or discarded.<br>
16. The method as claimed in claim 15, wherein the second manner is performed, by the RLC entity<br>
in transparent mode, in the event of an instruction associated with a delivery of erroneous service data<br>
units (SDUs) being configured.<br>
17. The method as claimed in claim 16, wherein in the second manner, the RLC PDU is further<br>
processed by selecting from at least one of delivering the RLC PDU together with an error indication to<br>
a higher protocol layer, discarding the RLC PDU, or delivering the RLC PDU without an error<br>
indication to a higher protocol layer.<br>
18. The method as claimed in claim 16, wherein in the second manner, the RLC PDU is further<br>
processed, whereby, in the event of the delivery of erroneous SDUs being set as "no," the RLC entity<br>
checks the CRC error information transferred together with the RLC PDU, and in the event of the RLC<br>
PDU containing an error, the RLC entity discards the RLC PDU immediately.<br>
19. The method as claimed in claim 16, wherein in the second manner, the RLC PDU is further<br>
processed, whereby, in the event of the delivery of erroneous SDUs being set as "yes," the RLC entity<br>
checks the CRC error information transferred together with the RLC PDU, and in the event of the RLC<br>
PDU containing an error, the RLC entity informs an upper layer that the PDU contains an error when<br>
transmitting the RLC PDU to the upper layer.<br>
20. The method as claimed in claim 16, wherein in the second manner, the RLC PDU is further<br>
processed, whereby, in the event of the delivery of erroneous SDUs being set as "no detect," the RLC<br>
entity does not check the CRC error information which has been received together with the RLC PDU,<br>
and processes the RLC PDU containing the error as a normal PDU and transfers such to the upper<br>
layer.<br>
21. The method as claimed in claim 15, wherein the RLC PDU is associated with adaptive multi-<br>
rate (AMR) codec processing.<br><br>
A method (600) for processing data in a receiver apparatus within a wireless communication<br>
system is provided. The data processing method (600) uses the receiver apparatus comprising a<br>
medium access control (MAC) layer and a radio link control (RLC) layer for processing data units. The<br>
data processing comprises communicating a data unit and a cyclic redundancy code (CRC) check result<br>
associated with the data unit from the MAC layer to the RLC layer, examining in the RLC layer that the<br>
CRC check result sent from the MAC layer that indicates whether the data unit has an error (S620) ;<br>
and processing the data unit in accordance with a method of processing data in a receiver apparatus<br>
within a wireless communication system, the receiver apparatus comprising a medium access control<br>
(MAC) layer and a radio link control (RLC) layer for processing data units, the method comprising the<br>
steps of : communicating a data unit and a cyclic redundancy code (CRC) check result associated with<br>
the data unit from the MAC layer to the RLC layer ; determining in the RLC layer that the CRC check<br>
result indicates the data unit has an error; and processing the data unit in accordance with one of a first<br>
manner and a second manner, the selection of one of the first manner and the second manner based<br>
upon at least an operation mode, wherein the second manner comprises checking whether an error<br>
handling scheme has been provided. A receiver apparatus, for processing data in a wireless<br>
communication system is also provided.</td>
