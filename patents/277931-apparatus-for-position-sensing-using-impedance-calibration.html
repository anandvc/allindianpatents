CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S.<br>
Patent Application No. 11/030,934 filed January 7, 2005,<br>
which is assigned to the assignee of the present patent<br>
application and whose disclosure is incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to sensing<br>
the position of an object placed within a living body,<br>
and specifically to position sensing using impedance<br>
measurements.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tracking the position of intrabody objects, such as<br>
sensors, tubes, catheters, dispensing devices, and<br>
implants, is required for many medical procedures.<br>
Systems have been developed that determine the position<br>
of an intrabody object by measuring voltage differentials<br>
between electrodes on an intrabody object and on the<br>
surface of the body. The voltage differentials correspond<br>
to the impedance between the electrodes. Methods for<br>
impedance-based position sensing are disclosed, for<br>
example, in U.S. Patent 5,983,126 to Wittkampf and in<br>
U.S. Patent 6,456,864 to Swanson, both of whose<br>
disclosures are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Wittkampf also describes a method for calibrating<br>
the position sensing apparatus using two electrodes<br>
spaced from each other on a catheter by a known distance.<br>
BIO5066USCIP1<br>
 <br>
Measuring the voltages between each of the catheter<br>
electrodes and each of three body surface electrodes x,<br>
y, and z, permits a correlation between intrabody<br>
position and voltages in the x, y and z directions.<br>
Similar methods for sensing voltage differentials<br>
between electrodes are disclosed by U.S. Patent 5,899,860<br>
to Pfeiffer; U.S. Patent 6,095,150 to Panescu; and U.S.<br>
Patents 6,050,267 and 5,944,022 to Nardella, all of whose<br>
disclosures are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Embodiments of the present invention provide<br>
efficient apparatus and methods for determining in real-<br>
time the position of a target probe placed within a<br>
living body. In these embodiments, electric currents are<br>
driven between one or more electrodes on the target probe<br>
and electrodes placed on the body surface. The impedance<br>
between the target probe and each of the body surface<br>
electrodes is measured and is used to calculate an<br>
estimated position of the target probe. A reference probe<br>
is also placed within the body, at a known location, and<br>
the impedance between the reference probe and each of the<br>
body surface electrodes is also measured. The impedance<br>
measurement for the reference probe is used to generate<br>
an impedance-based position estimate, which is compared<br>
with the known location of the reference probe. The<br>
difference between the estimated position and the known<br>
location is used to determine correction factors, which<br>
are applied to the estimated position of the target<br>
probe, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the estimate.<br>
2<br>
BIO5066USCIP1<br>
 <br>
The process of determining correction factors and<br>
applying the correction factors to the estimated position<br>
of the target probe may be performed in real-time. In an<br>
alternative embodiment, the correction factors may be<br>
determined prior to performing the target probe impedance<br>
measurements. In the alternative embodiment, a single<br>
probe may be used initially as the reference probe to<br>
determine correction factors and may subsequently be used<br>
as the target probe.<br>
When correction is performed in real-time,<br>
measurement errors due to impedance deviations are<br>
incorporated in real-time into the correction factors.<br>
This aspect of the invention may be used, for example, to<br>
compensate for changes of impedance of the body-surface<br>
electrodes.<br>
Such apparatus and methods are useful, inter alia,<br>
in medical procedures, such as mapping the heart or<br>
performing ablation to treat cardiac arrhythmias.<br>
There is therefore provided, in accordance with an<br>

surface electrodes.<br>
Determining the correction factor may include<br>
periodically repeating a measurement of the first<br>
characteristics and updating the correction factor<br>
responsively to the repeated measurement.<br>
In some embodiments, placing the target probe may<br>

probe. In such embodiments, the target probe may be a<br>
catheter,  and  performing  the  medical  procedure  may<br>

BIO5066USCIP1<br>
 <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS<br>
Fig. 1 is an illustration of a position sensing<br>
system 20, in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. System 20 is used in determining the<br>
position of a target probe, such as a target catheter 22,<br>
which is inserted into an internal body cavity, such as a<br>
chamber of a heart 24 of a subject 26. Typically, the<br>
target catheter is used for diagnostic or therapeutic<br>
treatment, such as mapping electrical potentials in the<br>
heart or performing ablation of heart tissue. Target<br>
catheter 22 or other target intrabody device may<br>
alternatively be used for other purposes, by itself or in<br>
conjunction with other treatment devices. (The term<br>
"target" is used in the present patent application and in<br>
the claims to denote a probe or other device whose<br>
position is to be determined by a position sensing<br>
system. The term "target" is used solely for the sake of<br>
convenience and clarity, in order to distinguish the<br>
target probe from a reference probe, and should not be<br>
construed as limiting in any way the form or function of<br>
elements to which the term is applied.)<br>
The distal tip of target catheter 22 comprises at<br>
least one target electrode 44. Target electrode 44 is<br>
connected by wires through the insertion tube of target<br>
catheter 22 to driver circuitry in a control unit 28.<br>
Target electrode 44 may be of any suitable shape and size<br>
to implement a position sensing function described<br>
hereinbelow, and may be used for other purposes, as well,<br>
such as for electrophysiological sensing or ablation.<br>
Impedance-based position sensing is typically performed<br>
11<br>
BIO5066USCIP1<br>
 <br>
using a catheter with three electrodes, but fewer or more<br>
electrodes may also be used, as in the example provided<br>
herein.<br>
A reference probe 42, which may be essentially<br>
identical to target catheter 22, is also inserted into<br>
the body of subject 26 and positioned at a known<br>
reference location. By way of example, for cardiac<br>
procedures, the reference location may be in the coronary<br>
sinus, or any other known location in the region of the<br>
chest cavity. The coronary sinus is a convenient choice,<br>
because invasive cardiologists are generally capable of<br>
introducing a catheter into the coronary sinus with<br>
relative ease and high reliability. Optionally, the<br>
coordinates of the reference location may be determined<br>
using a pre-acquired or real-time image, such as a MR I,<br>
x-ray, or ultrasound image.<br>
Reference probe 42 comprises at least one reference<br>
electrode 46. Like target electrode 44, electrode 46 is<br>
connected by wires to driver circuitry in control unit<br>
28. Similarly, electrode 44 may be of any suitable shape<br>
and size, and may be used for other purposes, as well.<br>
The control unit is connected by wires through a<br>
cable 30 to body surface electrodes, which typically<br>
comprise adhesive skin patches 32, 34, and 36. In<br>
alternative embodiments of the invention, the electrodes<br>
on the body surface may vary in number and may take other<br>
forms, such as subcutaneous probes or a handheld device<br>
operated by a medical practitioner 38.<br>
12<br>
BIO5066USCIP1<br>
 <br>
Patches 32, 34 and 36 may be placed at any<br>
convenient locations on the body surface in the vicinity<br>
of the target catheter and reference probe. For example,<br>
for cardiac applications, patches 32, 34, and 36 are<br>
placed around the chest of subject 26. There is no<br>
special requirement regarding the orientation of the<br>
patches relative to each other or to the coordinates of<br>
the body. In particular, there is no requirement that the<br>
placement of the patches be along fixed axes.<br>
Consequently, patch placement can be determined so as to<br>
interfere as little as possible with the medical<br>
procedure being performed.<br>
Control unit 28 may also drive a display 40, which<br>
shows the positions of target catheter 22 and reference<br>
catheter 42 inside the body.<br>
A process for calculating position coordinates based<br>
on impedance measurements is described in the<br>
aforementioned U.S. Patent Application No. 11/030,934. A<br>
related process is described in U.S. Patent Application<br>
No. 11/177,861 filed on July 8, 2005 which is also<br>
assigned to the assignee of the present patent<br>
application and whose disclosure is incorporated herein<br>
by reference. Methods described in the aforementioned<br>
patent applications or other methods for impedance-based<br>
position sensing may be applied by control unit 28 to<br>
measure the impedance between target electrode 44 and<br>
patches 32, 34 and 36 and to derive from the measured<br>
impedance  a  point,  PT1,  representing  the position of<br>
13<br>
BIO5066USCIP1<br>
 <br>
target catheter 22. The three-dimensional coordinates of<br>
PT1, represented as (xT1, yT1, zT1) , are an approximation to<br>
the actual position of target electrode 44.<br>
Impedance-based position sensing methods are also<br>
employed by control unit 28 to calculate a point<br>
representing the position of reference electrode 46. The<br>
difference between the calculated position of the<br>
reference probe and the known position is used to derive<br>
correction factors to improve the accuracy with which the<br>
position of the target probe is determined.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic detail view illustrating how<br>
correction factors may be derived and used, in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention. Using the<br>
impedance-based position sensing methods described above,<br>
a point 48, referred to hereinbelow as PRI, is calculated<br>
as the raw location of reference electrode 46. Point PRl =<br>
(XR1, yR1, ZR1) , is an uncorrected approximation for the<br>
location of reference electrode 46. A more precise<br>
location of the reference electrode, PR2, comprising<br>
coordinates (xR2, yR2, zR2) , may be obtained using the<br>
imaging methods described above. Alternatively, this more<br>
precise location may be determined a priori based on<br>
anatomical considerations (for example, the known<br>
location of the coronary sinus relative to other<br>
anatomical features), without the use of imaging. It may<br>
be understood that in embodiments of the present<br>
invention, any convenient location may be used as the<br>
origin for the coordinate system. A typical coordinate<br>
14<br>
BIO5066USCIP1<br>
 <br>
origin is an external reference point, or one of patches<br>
32, 34, and 36, or one of points PR1 and PR2.<br>
A difference vector, [dx, dy, dz], representing the<br>
distance between point PR1 and the more precise location<br>
PR2 may obtained by subtracting from the PR1 coordinates<br>
(XR1, yR1, zR1) the respective PR2 coordinates (xR2, yR2,<br>
zR2) , such that dx = (xR1 - xR2) , dy = (yR1 - yR2) , and dz =<br>
(ZRI - ZR2) .<br>
The factors dx, dy, and dz of the difference vector<br>
may be used as correction factors to determine with<br>
greater accuracy the position of target probe 22. Using<br>
the impedance-based position sensing methods described<br>
above, the location of target electrode 46 is calculated<br>
as being at the point PT1 = (xT1, yT1, zT1) . A more accurate<br>
determination of the target electrode position may be<br>
obtained by subtracting from PT1 the difference vector,<br>
[dx, dy, dz] , thereby giving a point PT2 = (xT2, yT2, zT2) ,<br>
wherein xT2 = (xT1 - dx) , yT2 = (yT1 - dy) , and zT2 = (zT1 -<br>
dz) .<br>
Correction factors may alternatively or additionally<br>
be derived from a ratio vector, rather than from the<br>
difference vector. A ratio vector, [rx, ry, rz],<br>
representing the ratio of coordinates of PR1 to the<br>
coordinates of the more precise location PR2 may obtained<br>
by dividing the PR1 coordinates by the respective<br>
coordinates of PR2, such that rx = (xR1/xR2) , ry = (yR1/<br>
yR2) , and rz = (zR1/zR2) . The more accurate estimate, PT1,<br>
of the target electrode position may then be obtained by<br>
15<br>
BIO5066USCIP1<br>
 <br>
dividing PT1 by the ratio vector, [rx, ry, rz] , thereby<br>
giving a point PT2 = (xT2, yT2, ZT2) , wherein xT2 = (xT1/rx) ,<br>
yT2 = (yT1/ry) , and ZT2 = (zT1/rz). Optionally, the<br>
position of the target probe may be corrected using a<br>
combination of multiplicative and additive factors.<br>
The impedance measured between the target probe and<br>
patches 32, 34 and 36 may be affected over time by<br>
factors such as the lifting of a patch or increased<br>
moisture on the skin. Such factors may consequently<br>
introduce errors into the position measurements. For<br>
example, a patch may partially lift from the skin,<br>
thereby increasing the impedance at that patch.<br>
Compensation for such impedance changes is provided by<br>
generating and applying the correction factors on a real-<br>
time basis, whereby the reference impedance measurements<br>
are repeated periodically. Correction factors from the<br>
reference measurement may then be applied to the target<br>
measurement. Changes in the calculated value of PTi due to<br>
changing factors of impedance will also be reflected in<br>
changes to the calculated value of PRi. Consequently, the<br>
derived correction factors will provide compensation for<br>
changing factors of impedance. Continual measurement of<br>
the reference impedance may also be used to detect and<br>
compensate for organ motion, due to patient breathing,<br>
for example.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, target probe 22 also<br>
serves  as reference  probe  42.Target  probe  22  is<br>
positioned at the known location and used to generate<br>
correction factors.  Subsequently, the target probe is<br>
16<br>
BIO5066USCIP1<br>
 <br>
moved to perform the desired medical procedure, and<br>
impedance-based position measurements of the target probe<br>
are corrected using the measured correction factors. In<br>
this embodiment, a correction protocol may be<br>
established, whereby the target probe is returned to the<br>
known reference location, or to a new reference location,<br>
at regular intervals, in order to generate up-to-date<br>
correction factors. Alternatively, impedance variations<br>
may be corrected by methods such as those described in<br>
the abovementioned U.S. Patent Application No. 11/177,861<br>
filed on July 8, 2005.<br>
The methods described hereinabove provide a means of<br>
determining a point location of target probe 22. In<br>
further embodiments of the present invention, additional<br>
target electrodes may be employed so as to provide a<br>
means for determining the complete three-dimensional<br>
orientation of target probe 22.<br>
System 20 represents an embodiment of the invention<br>
as it may be used in a catheter-based procedure for<br>
diagnosis or treatment of conditions of the heart, such<br>
as arrhythmias. The system may be used in generating a<br>
map of the heart (for example, an electrical map, wherein<br>
the electrodes on the catheter are used alternately for<br>
position sensing and for measuring electrical potentials<br>
generated in the heart tissue). The catheter position<br>
may be superimposed on this map or on another image of<br>
the heart. System 20 can be used, as well, in the<br>
diagnosis or treatment of intravascular ailments, which<br>
may involve angioplasty or atherectomy. The principles of<br>
17<br>
BIO5066USCIP1<br>
 <br>
system 20 may also be applied, mutatis mutandis, in<br>
position-sensing systems for the diagnosis or treatment<br>
of other body structures, such as the brain, spine,<br>
skeletal joints, urinary bladder, gastrointestinal tract,<br>
prostrate, and uterus.<br>
It will thus be appreciated that the embodiments<br>
