				<td>A VEHICLE DRIVEN BY HUMAN EFFORT<br><br>
The present invention relates to a vehicle driven by human effort and having at least two wheels, such as a bicycle or a tricycle.<br>
Vehicles driven by human effort such as bicycles are already known in the art, characterized in that they comprise a pedal drive system in which the energy from the legs is converted from a reciprocating motion into a circular motion by a so-called wheel - and - crank system.<br>
Such wheel - and - crank system has a drawback in that, due to constructional and functional reasons, the crank is of a moderate size, i.e. during the reciprocating motion, it has a reduced length equalling the leg swing. This entails only a small torque that can be transmitted to the wheel or crown.<br>
Moreover, there is a further drawback due to the fact when the person assumes a posture so as to be able to exert on the pedals a force not greater than the weight thereof, this entails reduction in the torque transmitted to the wheel or crown.<br>
Therefore, the object of the present invention is to solve the drawbacks of the state of the art by providing a vehicle driven by human effort and having at least two wheels, provided with a crank-wheel drive system suitable for converting the driving torque into higher values, so as to ensure higher values for the driving torque and reduced stress for the person as compared to vehicles known in the art.<br>
-1-<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a vehicle driven by human effort and having at least two wheels with a high efficiency crank-wheel driving system, of easy realisation, sturdy and, last but not least, of low cost.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a vehicle driven by human effort having at least two wheels, said vehicle comprising a first frame, a handlebars rotatably mounted on said first frame and connected to at least one of said wheels, a second frame integrally connected to the first frame at the front portion thereof and above said handlebars, characterized by a resting means for, a person driving said vehicle provided on said first frame, first driving means for producing a swinging reciprocating motion around an axis of rotation, and second driving means adapted to convert the swinging reciprocating motion of said first driving means into a rotary motion around said axis of rotation, said first driving means and said second driving means being rotatably mounted on said second frame.<br>
A detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be disclosed hereinafter, given by way of example and not for limitative purposes, making reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein :<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of the vehicle of the present invention; and<br>
Figure 2 is an elevational side view of the vehicle of the present invention.<br>
With reference to Figures 1 and 2, the vehicle of the present invention comprises a first frame 1 to which a front fork 2 is hinged. The fork is rotatably<br>
-2-<br><br>
connected to a front wheel 3 and connected at the upper end thereof to a handlebars 4 in a known manner. Likewise, a rear wheel 5 is rotatably connected to the first frame 1 in a known manner.<br>
At the central backward portion of the first frame 1 a seat 6 for the resting of the person on the first frame 1 is provided. Also, a seat back 7 for the resting of the back region of the person is provided.<br>
At the front region of the first frame 1, in an upper position and above the handlebars 4, a second frame "8 is integrally connected to the first frame 1. The second frame 8 has, at the upper end thereof, a crown 9 rotatably mounted onto the second frame 8. The crown 9 is in turn coaxially connected with a pair of cranks 10, one on each side of the crown 9. It is to be noted that the cranks 10 are remarkably longer than those known in the art, and are preferably positioned above the handlebars 4.<br>
The connection of the cranks 10 with the crown 9 is of the freewheel or sprocket wheel type, so as to make the cranks 10 capable of performing a swinging reciprocating motion around the axis of rotation (100) of the crown 9, and transmitting the torque to the crown 9 only in one direction of rotation thereof, and being freely rotatable in the opposite direction of rotation.<br>
The crown 9 is connected by means of a chain or the like to a second crown 11 rotatably and centrally mounted on the first frame 1 at the lower part thereof. The second crown 11 is in turn connected to the hub of the wheel 5 by means of a chain or the like in a known manner.<br>
-3-<br><br>
In the connection between the first crown 9 and the second crown 11, a torque conversion by a suitable reduction gear can be provided.<br>
tion is that<br>
A first advantage of the invention is that the combination of the<br><br>
members of the invention is such as to drive the rear  wheel 5 with a driving<br><br>
torque that is markedly higher than known in the art, thus remarkably decreasing<br>
the stress on the person at same driving energy. In fact, at the same stress of the person, a torque which is remarkably higher than that of the state of the art is applied to the crown 9 by choosing a suitable length of the cranks 10.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention derives from the fact that the person, once seated, can exert on the cranks 10 a thrust with his legs that is higher than the weight thereof, due to the fact that, when the person is resting his back region on the seat back 7, the seat back provides a reaction member to the leg thrust.<br>
A further advantage of the present invention derives from the fact that, when seated, the person has a lesser wind resistance than that of the similar vehicles known in the art.<br>
To persons skilled in the art it will be apparent that the present invention is susceptible of several further modifications and embodiments without departing from the spirit of the invention and from the scope of the invention as claimed hereinafter.<br>
-4-<br><br>
