TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
SOLID DOSAGE FORM COMPRISING SOLID DISPERSION AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a solid dosage form comprising a solid dispersion produced for improving the solubility of a poorly soluble drug and a method for producing the same. In particular, the present invention relates to a solid dosage form comprising a solid dispersion, which rapidly can be disintegrated and allow a drug to be dissolved, and a method for producing the same.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Poorly soluble drugs have high crystallinity and extremely low solubility in water. Thus, bioavailability or internal absorption of preparations produced from these drugs is low, and thus there is the problem that the drug action is insufficient. As a technique for solving this problem, a solid dispersion has been developed in which molecules of a poorly soluble drug are dispersed in a high molecular weight carrier, such as a cellulose derivative, in an amorphous state.<br>
Conventional solid dispersions are used as preparations in the form of capsules containing a solid obtained by spray-drying<br><br>
a cosolvent in which a poorly soluble drug and a carrier are dissolved, or in the form of fine granules or granules as they are. However, the form of tablets, which is a commonly solid dosage form, is most preferable because tablets are easily prescribed and used in a fixed dose, and easily handled and used by patients in use.<br>
It is known that in the case of tablets produced from a solid dispersion powder, the porosity of the tablets is often lowered not only due to a reduced specific surface area, but also due to plastic deformation of amorphous drug molecules during a compression force and strong compressibility between high molecular weight carrier particles. This low porosity leads to slow permeation of water molecules into the tablets in administration, and to slow disintegration of the tablets, and thus the solid dispersion cannot exert its original effect of improving the solubility. Furthermore, the viscosity of a water-soluble high molecular weight substance or enteric high molecular weight substance serving as a carrier increases during hydration or dissolution, and thus a type of hydrogel layer is formed on the surface of the tablets during dissolution, so that water is further prevented from infiltrating.<br>
As means for solving these problems, PCT Applciation Japanese Phase Publication 2005-517690 has proposed a tablet that contains a solid dispersion powder obtained by spray-drying, a disintegrant, and an excipient comprising porosigen.<br><br>
Furthermore, Japanese Patent Application Unexamined Publication No. 5-262642/1993 has proposed a powder in which a water-soluble high molecular weight base, and if necessary, an excipient and a disintegrant are added to a poorly soluble drug. However, a concentration-enhancing polymer and a water-soluble high molecular weight base, serving as carriers, are added in large amounts, and thus the drug release from the preparation is poor, so that the dissolution speed tends to be lowered. Furthermore, in the case of a solid dispersion powder obtained by spray-drying as in PCT Application Japanese Phase Publication No. 2005-517690, it is necessary that after the solid dispersion powder is mixed with the other ingredients, the mixture is compressed and pulverized for formation of a granulated powder for tableting. The particle size of the solid dispersion powder prepared by spray-drying in this manner is small, and thus when it is simply mixed with an excipient, segregation is caused, so that the ingredients become non-uniform in the powder for tableting. Moreover, this process makes the operation complicated, and the solid dispersion may be recrystallized in compression. Furthermore, the disintegrant is added after the solid dispersion has been prepared, and thus when the solid dispersion is aggregated and bonded in the tablet due to high bonding strength of the carrier, aggregation may be formed and dispersed in water during disintegration, lowering the solubility of the drug. Japanese Patent Application Unexamined Publication No.<br><br>
2004-67606 has proposed a tablet using fine granules obtained by: spraying a solution containing itraconazole, which is a poorly soluble drug, a water-soluble polymer, and an enteric polymer, on a mixed powder of an excipient and a disintegrant; and granulating and drying the resultant. However, due to its poor disintegration, it takes as long as 360 minutes for the drug to be dissolved from the tablet. Thus, the disintegration of the tablet is not improved.<br>
Hirasawa et al. (Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan, 124 (1), 19-23(2004)) has proposed a tablet produced from a product obtained by: loading an ethanol dispersion liquid as a binding fluid containing nilvadipine, which is a poorly soluble drug, crospovidone, and methylcellulose, into a mixed powder of materials such as lactose, methylcellulose, and low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose; and agitating and granulating the resultant. However, in the ethanol solution containing nilvadipine, and crospovidone and methylcellulose, serving as carriers, the components are not dissolved. Thus, it seems that the solution functions only as an agent for dispersing and diluting amorphous nilvadipine, because a co-dissolved state is not obtained. In order to disperse amorphous drug molecules in a polymer serving as a carrier, it is necessary to obtain a co-dissolved state in a cosolvent in which these components are dissolved. Thus, it seems that the solid dispersion of amorphous nilvadipine described in Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society<br><br>
of Japan (124(1), 19-23(2004)) does not have sufficient solubility. Furthermore, due to the influence of the water-soluble polymer, the disintegration is suppressed, and thus it may be difficult to obtain a preparation that can be rapidly dissolved.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention was completed in view of the above-described circumstances, and provides a solid dosage form comprising a solid dispersion, which allows a drug in the preparation to be rapidly dissolved without compromising the solubility of the solid dispersion, and a method for producing the same.<br>
The inventors had conducted an in-depth study in order to solve the above-described problem and found that when special low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose is used as a disintegrant, disintegration is not lowered in tablets obtained by compression a solid dispersion, and a solid dosage form rapidly can be disintegrated and allow a drug to be dissolved. As a result, the present invention has been achieved.<br>
More specifically, the present invention provides a solid dosage form comprising a solid dispersion, dispersion comprising a poorly soluble drug, a water-soluble polymer and a disintegrant, wherein the disintegrant is low-substituted tiydroxypropylcellulose having an average particle size of 10 to<br><br>
100 urn and a specific surface area measured by BET method of at least 1.0 m2/g and serving as a disintegrant. The solid dosage form comprising the solid dispersion preferably may contain an excipient. Moreover, the present invention provides a method for producing a solid dosage form comprising a solid dispersion, the method comprising steps of: spraying a water-soluble polymer solution in which a poorly soluble drug has been dispersed or dissolved, on a powder in which low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose having an average particle size of 10 to<br>
100 urn and a specific surface area measured by BET method of at least 1.0 m2/g and serving as a disintegrant; and granulating the resultant and drying.<br>
According to the present invention, a solid dosage form with excellent solubility is obtained. The solid dosage form in the form of a granulated product has high solubility, while the solid dosage form in the form of a tablet is disintegrated within 10 minutes after introduction to a dissolution medium and can release at least 70% by weight of a poorly soluble drug.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention is described in more<br>
detail.<br>
A poorly soluble drug used in the present invention has<br>
extremely low solubility in water, and poor absorption in ordinary<br>
oral administration. For example, the poorly soluble drug refers<br><br>
to a drug that is "practically insoluble or insoluble" or "very slightly soluble" as prescribed in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia Fifteenth Edition.  "Solubility" of a drug in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia Fifteenth Edition refers to the degree of dissolution of the drug, powdered in the case of a solid, within<br>
3 0 minutes in a solvent at 20 ± 5°C, by shaking for 3 0 seconds each time at 5-minute intervals. If a drug is "practically insoluble or insoluble", then the amount of a solvent (water, in this specification) required for dissolving 1 g or 1 ml of the drug is 10,000 ml or more. If a drug is "very slightly soluble", then the amount of a solvent required for dissolving 1 g or 1 ml of the drug is 1,0 00 ml or more and less than 10,000 ml.<br>
Specific examples of the poorly soluble drug used in the present invention include, but are not limited to, nifedipine, phenacetin, phenytoin, digitoxin, nilvadipine, diazepam, griseofulvin, and chloramphenicol.<br>
In the present invention, molecules of the poorly soluble drug are dispersed in an amorphous state, and thus a water-soluble polymer is used as a carrier. The water-soluble polymer is a polymer that is "very soluble (the amount of water required for dissolving 1 g or 1 ml of the drug is less than 1 ml)", "freely soluble (the amount of water required for dissolving 1 g or 1 ml of the drug is 1 ml or more and less than 10 ml)", or "soluble<br><br><br>
Japanese Pharmacopoeia Fifteenth Edition, when the polymer is<br>
added to hot water (70°C or higher) and the mixture is agitated and dispersed, the amount of the hot water ranging from half to the total amount required for dissolution, and cold water or ice water in an amount of the balance is added during the agitation in a case where the amount of the hot water used is less than the total amount required- Specific examples thereof include: alkylcellulose such as methylcellulose; hydroxyalkylcellulose such as hydroxyethylcellulose and hydroxypropylcellulose; hydroxyalkylalkylcellulose such as hydroxyethylmethylcellulose and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose; polyvinyl alcohol; and polyvinyl pyrrolidone. Of these, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose is particularly preferable.<br>
The content of the water-soluble polymer is 1 to 75% by weight, preferably 1 to 50% by weight, more preferably 1 to 35% by weight, and particularly preferably 1 to 2 0% by weight, with respect to the total amount of the solid dosage form.  If the content of the water-soluble polymer is less than 1% by weight, then it may be difficult to obtain a completely amorphous state of the poorly soluble drug in the solid dispersion.  If the content is more than 75% by weight, then the ratio of the water-soluble polymer in the preparation becomes large, which may not be preferable in that the dose and the size of the preparation become large and in that the disintegration is lowered.<br>
The weight ratio of the water-soluble polymer added to the<br><br>
poorly soluble drug is preferably 1 to 5 when taking the poorly soluble drug as 1. If the ratio of the water-soluble polymer is less than 1, then the poorly soluble drug in the solid dispersion may not be in a completely amorphous state. If the ratio is more than 5, then the ratio of the water-soluble polymer in the preparation becomes large, and thus the size of the preparation becomes large and the dissolution speed is lowered, which may not be suitable for a commonly used preparation.<br>
As a solvent used when preparing the solid dispersion that contains the water-soluble polymer and the poorly soluble drug, a solvent is preferable in which the poorly soluble drug is well dissolved and the water-soluble polymer is also dissolved. Examples thereof include: methanol, ethanol, methylene chloride, and acetone; mixed solvents thereof; and solvent mixed with water. The solvent maybe selected as appropriate based on the solubility of the poorly soluble drug and the water-soluble polymer in the solvent.<br>
The solvent is added in an amount in which the solid concentration is preferably 3 to 18% by weight, and particularly preferably 3.5 to 12% by weight.<br>
Examples of the excipient used in the present invention include lactose, cornstarch, saccharose, mannite, anhydrous calcium phosphate, crystalline cellulose, and their mixtures. It is particularly preferable to use a mixed powder containing lactose and cornstarch in a weight ratio of 7:3.<br><br>
It should be noted that the content of the excipient is preferably an amount (balance) obtained by excluding the poorly soluble drug, the water-soluble polymer, and a disintegrant described later.<br>
As the disintegrant of the present invention, low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose may be used that has an<br>
average particle size of 10 to 100 /zm and a specific surface area measured by the BET method of 1. 0 m2/g or more, because it provides<br>
granulated products with high flowability and ensures high solubility from the compression preparation.<br>
The average particle size of the low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose of the present invention may be 10 to 100 ,um, and preferably approximately 20 to 60 //m. If the average particle size is less than 10 l±m, then aggregability increases because the hydroxypropylcellulose is in the form of fine powder, and thus the flowability of the powder may be lowered.  If the<br>
average particle size is more than 100 iim,  then uniformity with the drug is lowered, and thus the product may be non-uniform. The average particle size can be measured using a HELOS&amp;RODOS (manufactured by Sympatec) for measuring particle size distribution with laser diffractometry.<br>
Furthermore, the specific surface area of the low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose of the present invention may be 1. 0 m2/g or more. The reason for this is that if the specific surface area is less than 1.0 m2/g, then high compressibility may<br><br>
not be obtained.<br>
It is known that generally, higher specific surface area of a powder provides higher compressibility of the powder. The specific surface area analysis is a method for obtaining the specific surface area of a sample based on the amount of molecules adsorbed to the surface of particles of the powder at the temperature of liquid nitrogen, the molecules having adsorption occupying area that has been known. For the specific surface area analysis, the BET method can be used that is based on physical adsorption of inert gas at low temperature and low humidity. In the measurement, for example, MICROMERITICS GEMINI 2375 (manufactured by SHIMADZU CORPORATION) can be used.<br>
Generally, specific surface area can be increased by reducing average particle size. However, as described above, if average particle size is too small, then the aggregability of a powder increases, and the f lowability of the powder may be lowered. In the present invention, using compaction-grinding, a powder is provided that has high specific surface area although its average particle size is sufficient for securing the flowability of the powder.<br>
The low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose preferably has a bulk density of 0.3 0 g/ml or more.<br>
Herein, "bulk density" refers to the bulk density in a loosely filled state, and is measured by uniformly supplying a sample from above (23 cm) , through a sieve with 24 mesh according<br><br>
to JIS, to a cylindrical vessel (material: stainless steel) with a diameter of 5.03 cm and a height 5.03 cm (volume 100 ml) , and performing weighing after leveling at the upper surface. These operations are performed using a powder tester (PT-D) manufactured by Hosokawa Micron Corporation.<br>
The low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose of the present invention preferably has an elastic recovery ratio of 7% or less when being subjected to compression at a compression force of 50 MPa. Accordingly, a dense molded product can be formed in a compressed state.<br>
The elastic recovery ratio refers to an indicator of the compressibility of a powder. The elastic recovery ratio can be calculated from the following equation, based on the thickness of a tablet obtained by compression a powder in a tablet weight of 480 mg and at a compression force of 50 MPa, using a flat shape (a tableting tester (manufactured by SANKYO PIO-TECH. CO., Ltd.)) with a flat contact face for a tablet diameter of 11.3 mm.<br>
Elastic recovery ratio = {(tablet thickness after 30 seconds - minimum tablet thickness)/(minimum tablet<br>
thickness)} x 100 Herein, "minimum tablet thickness" refers to the lowest point obtained when the powder is compressed by an upper punch of a flat shape unit with a fixed lower punch, that is, the thickness obtained when the tablet is compressed to the extent possible.  "Tablet thickness after 3 0 seconds" refers to the<br><br>
tablet thickness at 3 0 seconds after the upper punch is removed upward.<br>
The swelling properties of the low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose can be measured, for example, in the following manner: the low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose is molded at a compression force of 1 t into a tablet having a flat face with a diameter of 15 mm; the tablet is swollen by dropping water thereonto; and the swelling properties are evaluated as the swollen volume increase ratio and the swollen volume increase rate at that time. When alkali cellulose is used in which the weight ratio of sodium hydroxide with respect to anhydrous cellulose is 0.1 to 0.3, the swollen volume increase ratio is preferably 300% or more, and the swollen volume increase rate is preferably 100%/min or more.<br>
The swollen volume increase ratio can be obtained in the following manner: the powder is molded at a compression force of 1 t into a tablet having a flat face with a diameter of 15 mm; a punch with a pipe is attached instead of the upper punch; the tablet is caused to absorb water for 10 minutes by dropping water through this pipe onto the tablet contained in a mortar; and the swollen volume increase ratio is obtained at that time. The water is dropped at a rate of 1 ml/min for 10 minutes. The increase in the volume can be calculated from the following equation, based on a change in the thickness of the tablet.<br><br>
Swollen volume increase ratio =<br>
(difference in tablet thickness between before and after adding water / tablet thickness before adding<br>
water) x 100<br>
It should be noted that in the equation above, "difference in tablet thickness between before and after adding water" refers to a value obtained by subtracting the tablet thickness before adding water from the tablet thickness after adding water for 10 minutes.<br>
Furthermore, the swollen volume increase ratio of the low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose powder is preferably 300% or more in view of swelling properties, which are important properties as the disintegrant.  If the swollen volume increase ratio is less than 300%, then the disintegration time of a preparation produced from the powder may be longer.<br>
The swollen volume increase rate refers to an initial swelling ratio at 30 seconds after starting the addition of water, when the swollen volume increase ratio is measured under the same condition as the above-described method, and can be calculated from the following equation.<br>
Swollen volume increase rate =<br>
(difference in tablet thickness before and after initially adding water / tablet thickness before<br>
adding water) x 100/0.5 In the equation above, "difference in tablet thickness<br><br>
before and after initially adding water" refers to a value obtained by subtracting the tablet thickness before adding water from the tablet thickness at 3 0 seconds after starting the addition of water.<br>
The swollen volume increase rate of the low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose powder of the present invention is preferably 100%/min or more in view of swelling properties, which are important properties as the disintegrant. If the swollen volume increase rate is less than 100%/min, then the disintegration time of a preparation produced from the powder may be longer.<br>
The low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose of the present invention is a powder having high flowability and preferably<br>
having a repose angle of 42° or less, the repose angle being one type of indicators of the flowability of a powder. The repose angle refers to an angle formed by a horizontal plane and a generatrix of a corn that is a deposition formed by dropping the sample onto the plane. For example, using a powder tester PT-D (manufactured by Hosokawa Micron Corporation) , the repose angle can be calculated by allowing the sample to flow from a height of 75 mm onto a disc-shaped metal stage having a diameter of 80 mm, until a constant angle is obtained, and then measuring the angle formed by the deposited powder and the stage. The smaller this angle is, the better the flowability of the powder is.<br>
As described in Japanese Patent Application No. 2006-215401,<br><br>
the low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose of the present invention can be obtained in the following manner: an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is added and mixed with powdered pulp, and thus alkali cellulose is produced in which the weight ratio of sodium hydroxide with respect to anhydrous cellulose is 0.1 to 0.3; the alkali cellulose is etherified; the sodium hydroxide is neutralized after performing or without performing a dissolution step; the resultant is washed and dried; and then the dried product is compaction-ground in a pulverization step.<br>
More specifically, a method for producing a low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose powder comprises the steps of: (1) adding and mixing an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution with powdered pulp such that the weight ratio of sodium hydroxide with respect to anhydrous cellulose is 0.1 to 0.3 so as to produce alkali cellulose; (2) etherifying the obtained alkali cellulose so as to obtain a crude reaction product; (3) neutralizing the sodium hydroxide contained in the obtained crude reaction product; (4) washing and dehydrating the resultant; (5) drying the resultant; and (6) pulverizing by compaction-grinding. Furthermore, a method for producing a low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose powder that has a number of moles substituted per anhydrous glucose unit of 0.05 to 1.0, that is insoluble in water, and that is swollen by absorbing water, comprises the steps of: (1) adding and mixing an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution with powdered pulp such that the weight ratio of sodium hydroxide with respect to<br><br>
anhydrous cellulose is 0.1 to 0.3 so as to produce alkali cellulose; (2) etherifying the obtained alkali cellulose so as to obtain a crude reaction product; (3) neutralizing the sodium hydroxide contained in the obtained crude reaction product without performing a dissolution step of dissolving part or whole of the crude reaction product; (4) washing and dehydrating the resultant; (5) drying the resultant; and (6) pulverizing by compaction-grinding.  In the wash and dehydration step, the resultant is preferably washed and dehydrated such that the water content is 65% by weight or less.<br>
First, any pulverization method may be applied for obtaining powdered pulp that is used as a raw material.  The<br>
average particle size thereof is preferably 60 to 300 £tm. It is inefficient from an industrial viewpoint to prepare powdered<br>
pulp having an average particle size of less than 60 /im. If the average particle size is more than 300 i±mt then the uniformity with the aqueous sodium hydroxide solution may be poor.<br>
The step of producing alkali cellulose is preferably performed by dropping or spraying the aqueous sodium hydroxide solution to the powdered pulp and mixing the resultant. At that time, the sodium hydroxide acts as a catalyst in the etherif ication. The alkali cellulose may be produced preferably by using either a method in which mixing is performed in an internally-agitating type reaction device, and then etherification is successively performed, or a method in which<br><br>
alkali cellulose prepared in another mixing device is charged into a reaction device, and etherification is performed.<br>
Furthermore, it was found that the amount of the sodium hydroxide in the alkali cellulose affects not only the reaction efficiency but also the swelling properties and the compressibility of final products. The optimum amount of the sodium hydroxide in the alkali cellulose may be 0.1 to 0.3 in the weight ratio of the sodium hydroxide with respect to anhydrous cellulose (referring to the balance obtained by removing water from the pulp) . If the amount is less than 0.1, then the swelling properties, in particular, the volume increase ratio when the product is swollen by absorbing water may be lowered, the disintegration may be lowered, and the compressibility also may be lowered. Furthermore, if the amount is more than 0.3, then the swollen volume increase ratio and the swollen volume increase rate when absorbing water (described later) may be lowered, and the compressibility also may be lowered.<br>
The sodium hydroxide is preferably added as an aqueous 2 0 to 40% by weight solution.<br>
The following etherif ication step is performed by charging the alkali cellulose into a reaction device, performing nitrogen purge, and then charging propylene oxide into the reaction device as an etherifying agent, thereby causing a reaction. The ratio of the propylene oxide charged is preferably approximately 0.1 to 1.0 mole with respect to 1 mole of anhydrous glucose units.<br><br>
The reaction temperature is approximately 4 0 to 80 °C, and the reaction time is approximately 1 to 5 hours.<br>
It should be noted that after the etherification step, a dissolution step may be performed, if necessary. The dissolution step is performed by dissolving part or whole of the crude reaction product after the etherification in water or hot water. The amount of water or hot water used varies depending on the amount of the crude reaction product to be dissolved, but the amount of water for dissolving whole of the crude reaction product is usually 0.5 to 10 in the weight ratio with respect to the low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose in the crude reaction product.<br>
In order to further improve the load in the wash and dehydration step described later, and the compressibility of low-substituted cellulose ether, it is preferable not to perform the dissolution step.<br>
In the following neutralization step, since the sodium hydroxide used as the catalyst remains in the reaction product, neutralization is preferably performed by loading the crude reaction product into water or hot water containing acids in an amount equivalent to the sodium hydroxide. Alternatively, neutralization may be performed by adding water or hot water containing the equivalent amount of acids to the reaction product.<br>
Examples of the acids that are used herein include mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid,<br><br>
and organic acids such as fomic acid and acetic acid.<br>
In the following wash and dehydration step, while washing the obtained neutralized product preferably using water or hot water, dehydration is performed by a method preferably selected f rom centrifugation, suction filtration, and pressure filtration, for example. The low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose in an obtained dehydrated product cake is in the form of fibers as in the raw material pulp. The dehydrated product obtained after performing the dissolution step has a dehydration ratio of approximately 70 to 90% by weight, although this ratio depends on the number of moles substituted. The dehydration ratio of the dehydrated product obtained without performing the dissolution step is usually 65% by weight or less, so that the load in the following drying step can be reduced, and the productivity is improved. Furthermore, it is advantageous in that the steps can be simplified because the dissolution step is not included.<br>
Furthermore, in view of the compressibility of the product, when a fibrous substance is pulverized, the obtained product has higher specific surface area and thus higher compressibility.<br>
The drying step of drying the obtained dehydrated product is preferably performed using a drier such as a f luidized bed drier<br>
or a drum drier at 60 to 120°C.<br>
The pulverization step may be performed by compaction-grinding the dried product obtained by the above-described method.<br><br>
For this compaction-grinding, a pulverizer such as a roller mill, a ball mill, a bead mill, or a millstone mill can be used. In a roller mill, with a centrifugal force or gravity load accompanying its rotational movement, rollers or balls roll over while compressing/shearing a pulverization target on a mill wall. Examples thereof include an IS mill manufactured by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Ltd., a VX mill manufactured by Kurimoto, Ltd., and an MS roller mill manufactured by MASUNO SEISAKUSHO LTD. A ball mill uses, as a milling medium, steel balls, magnetic balls, cobbled stones, or the like. Examples thereof include a ball mill manufactured by KURIMOTO TEKKO KK, a tube mill manufactured by Otsuka Iron Works, and a planetary ball mill manufactured by FRITSCH. A bead mill is similar to the ball mill, but is different therefrom in that the diameter of balls used is smaller and in that acceleration of the balls can be further increased by rotating the internal portion of the device at high speed. Examples thereof include a bead mill manufactured by Ashizawa. A millstone mill can grind a powder by rotating a millstone at narrow clearance at high speed. Examples thereof include Serendipiter manufactured by MASUKO SANGYO CO., LTD.<br>
The roller mill is particularly preferable because it reduces foreign metal substances mixed in, requires small installation area, and provides high productivity.<br>
When fibrous particles serving as a pulverizatoin raw<br><br>
material are repeatedly compaction-ground, the fibrous and hollow tubular form derived from the raw material pulp is lost, and thus primary particles can be made smaller, so that the specific surface area is increased. Also, since the fibrous form derived from the raw material pulp is lost, a powder having uniform particle shape can be obtained.<br>
It has been considered that the compressibility of low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose produced by conventional impact pulverization is exerted by intertwining of fibrous substances. When fibrous particles are increased based on this idea for improving the compressibility, the flowability is lowered. However, a low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose powder produced by compaction-grinding exhibits surprisingly high compressibility, although the fibrous form has been lost due to the compaction-grinding.<br>
Next, preferably, the pulverized product is sieved following the usual method, and thus the targeted low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose powder can be obtained. The opening of<br>
a sieve herein may be approximately 38 to 180 iim.<br>
The thus obtained low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose powder has high flowability, excellent compressibility, and excellent swelling properties, regardless of the fibrous form derived from raw material pulp. Furthermore, due to its excellent compressibility and excellent disintegration, the amount of this powder added to a tablet can be reduced, and thus the size of the<br><br>
tablet can be made smaller. Moreover, the compression force in production of the tablet can be made lower, which provides the advantage of being able to reduce physical influences such as recrystallization of the solid dispersion during process.<br>
In the present invention, in addition to the low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose, for example, carmellose, carmellose sodium, carmellose calcium, croscarmellose sodium, hydroxypropyl starch, sodium carboxymethyl starch, crospovidone, and their mixtures can be used.<br>
The content of the disintegrant is preferably 1 to 98% by weight, and more preferably 1 to 6 0% by weight, with respect to the total amount of the solid dosage form. If the content of the disintegrant is less than 1% by weight, then it may be difficult to disintegrate the solid dosage form because the amount of the dinintegrant is small. If the content is more than 98% by weight, then an effective amount of drug may not be contained.<br>
In the solid dosage form of the present invention, the granulated product refers to a powder and a granule prescribed in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia Fifteenth Edition.<br>
In a case where the solid dosage form is in the form of a tablet, a lubricant may be added, if necessary. Examples of the lubricant include magnesium stearate, sucrose fatty acid ester, polyethylene glycol, talc, and stearic acid.<br>
In a case where the lubricant is added, the amount of the lubricant added is preferably 0.5 to 2% by weight with respect<br><br>
to the total amount of the preparation excluding the lubricant. If the amount of the lubricant added is less than 0.5% by weight, then sufficient lubricative properties may not be obtained, so that the preparation adheres to a mortar or a punch during tableting. If the amount is more than 2% by weight, then the hardness may decrease and the disintegration may be lowered.<br>
Next, a method for producing the solid dosage form comprising the solid dispersion according to the present invention is described.<br>
In a case where the solid dosage form comprising the solid dispersion of the present invention is a granulated product, the granulated product may be obtained preferably in a method comprising steps of: spraying a water-soluble polymer solution in which the poorly soluble drug has been dispersed or dissolved, on a mixed powder of the excipient and the disintegrant; and granulating the resultant and then drying. More specifically, in a state where the mixed powder of the excipient and the disintegrant may be allowed to flow in a granulating device, the water-soluble polymer solution prepared in advance in which the poorly soluble drug has been dispersed or dissolved may be sprayed on the mixed powder, the resultant may be granulated and dried, and then the particle size may be regulated.<br>
Examples of the granulating device include a f luidized bed granulating device, a high-speed agitation granulating device, a rolling granulating device, and a dry granulating device. The<br><br>
fluidized bed granulating device is particularly preferable because it does not apply mechanical shear to the granulated product.<br>
There is no particular limitation on the method for producing the solid dosage form of the solid dispersion of the present invention, except that a low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose having an average particle size of 10 to<br>
100 /iin, and a specific surface area measured by the BET method of 1.0 m2/g or more is used as the disintegrant. For example, the following method can be used.<br>
The water-soluble polymer is completely dissolved in the above-described solvent such as ethanol or water, and then the poorly soluble drug is loaded thereinto, and thus the solid dispersion solution is obtained. Herein, it is possible to load ingredients constituting the solid dispersion solution into the solvent at a time, but it is preferable to dissolve the water-soluble polymer first in order to achieve the stability of the drug in the finally obtained solid dosage form and to shorten the dissolution time of the poorly soluble drug. There is no particular limitation on the concentration of the solid<br>
dispersion solution, but the concentration is preferably 400 mPa-s or less, and particularly preferably 100 mPa-s or less, because the solution is to be sprayed.<br>
While the mixture of these various ingredients such as the disintegrant is allowed to flow, for example, in the fluidized<br><br>
bed granulating device, the solid dispersion solution is sprayed thereon, and the resultant is granulated and dried, and thus the granulated product can be obtained. In the spray/granulation step, the charge air temperature is preferably 150°C or lower, and particularly preferably 100°C or lower, considering a case in which an organic solvent is used.<br>
The discharge air temperature is preferably 3 0°C or higher, and particularly preferably 4 0°C or higher. The spray rate is preferably 50 g/min or less, and particularly preferably 3 0 g/min or less. The spray air pressure is preferably 250 kPa or less, and particularly preferably 200 kPa or less. Furthermore, after the spraying, in the drying step performed in order not to leave the solvent in the obtained granulated product, the charge air temperature is preferably 150°C or lower, and particularly preferably 100°C or lower, and the drying time is preferably 10 to 60 minutes.<br>
The obtained granulated product can be used as it is. However, the obtained granulated product can be, for example, sieved or pulverized for obtaining a solid dosage form having more uniform particle size distribution. For example, the particle<br>
size may be regulated with a sieve with an opening of 500 um, for example.<br>
On the other hand, in a case where the solid dosage form of the solid dispersion is a tablet, the tablet may be obtained by performing compression in a tableting machine, using the<br><br>
granulated product obtained by the above-described method as a powder for tableting, and adding a lubricant thereto, if necessary.<br>
For the tablet ing, for example, a rotary tablet ing machine, or a single tablet ing machine may be used. However, there is no limitation to this, and a specially customized tableting machine also may be used. The compression force during tableting is 1 to 130 kg/cm2, and particularly preferably 10 to 100 kg/cm2.<br>
When the thus obtained granulated product of the solid dispersion is evaluated following "Dissolution Test, Method 2" described in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia Fifteenth Edition, the concentration of the drug dissolved within 5 minutes after administration is 70% or more with respect to the dose, that is, high solubility is exhibited.<br>
When the obtained tablet of the solid dispersion is evaluated following "Disintegration Test" described in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia Fifteenth Edition, the tablet is disintegrated within 10 minutes after administration, and when the tablet is evaluated following "Dissolution Test, Method 2" described in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia Fifteenth Edition, the concentration of the drug dissolved within 10 minutes after administration is 70% or more with respect to the dose, that is, high disintegration and high solubility are exhibited.<br>
The solid dosage form obtained in the present invention may be coated by known methods in order to provide taste-masking or<br><br>
odor-masking, to make the preparation enteric, or to achieve slow release of the preparation. Examples of the coating agent used at that time include: enteric polymers such as cellulose acetate phthalate, methacrylic acid copolymer L, methacrylic acid copolymer LD, methacrylic acid copolymer S, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate, and carboxymethylethylcellulose; stomach-soluble polymers such as polyvinyl acetal diethylaminoacetate and aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer; and the water-soluble polymers described above.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention is specifically described by way of examples and comparative examples, but the present invention is not limited to these examples.<br><synthesis examples to><br>
Synthesis example of the low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose<br>
powder<br>
First, 8 06 g of powdered pulp (750 g in an anhydrous state) was charged into a 10 L internally-agitating type reaction device, 3 03 g of 26% sodium hydroxide solution was charged into the<br>
reaction device, then mixing was performed at 45°C for 30 minutes, and thus alkali cellulose was obtained in which the weight ratio<br><br>
of sodium hydroxide with respect to anhydrous cellulose was 0 .105 . Next, nitrogen purge was performed, 123 g of propylene oxide (0.164 parts by weight with respect to cellulose) was added to the resultant, then the mixture was reacted at a jacket<br>
temperature of 60°C for 1.5 hours, and thus 1232 g of hydroxypropylcellulose crude reaction product was obtained in which the number of moles substituted with hydroxypropoxyl groups per anhydrous glucose unit was 0.28. The etherification efficiency was 61.4%.<br>
Next, 23 6 g of 50% by weight acetic acid was added and mixed in the 10 L internally-agitating type reaction device, thereby performing neutralization. The neutralized product was washed<br>
in hot water at 90°C and dehydrated, using a batch-type centrifuge at a rotational speed of 3000 rpm. The water content of the dehydrated product was 58.2% by weight. The dehydrated product<br>
was dried at 8 0°C for one whole day and night in a shelf drier.<br>
The dried product was pulverized using a batch-type planetary ball mill P-5 manufactured by FRITSH, at 255 rpm for 60 minutes . The pulverized product was sieved through sieves with<br>
openings of 38, 75, and 180 /zm, and thus the low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose powders (Samples 1 to 3, respectively) having a hydroxypropoxyl group content of 10.9% by weight were obtained. These powders were evaluated by the above-described method, in terms of average particle size, specific surface area, bulk density, repose angle, elastic recovery ratio,<br><br>
compressibility, swollen volume increase ratio, and swollen volume increase rate. Table 1 shows the evaluation results.<br><br><examples to and comparative examples><br>
Solid dispersion solutions were prepared by dissolving predetermined amounts (listed in Table 2) of nifedipine and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) (hydroxypropoxyl group 8.7%<br>
by weight, methoxyl group 28.8% by weight, 6 mPa-s) , in a mixed solvent containing ethanol and water in a weight ratio of 8:2. Then, in a state where a mixture of predetermined amounts (listed in Table 2) of low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose (L-HPC) , lactose (Pharmatose manufactured by DMV International), and cornstarch (cornstarch W manufactured by NIHON SHOKUHIN KAKO) was allowed to flow in a fluidized bed granulating device (Multiplex MP-01 manufactured by POWREX CORPORATION) , the solid dispersion solutions were sprayed on the mixture, the resultants were granulated and dried, the particle size was regulated with a sieve<br><br>
of 30 mesh (opening 500 £tm) , and thus granulated products were obtained. The granulating and drying conditions at that time are as below.<br>
Inlet air temperature: 60 °C,<br>
discharge air temperature: 40°C;<br>
Spray rate: 10 g/min,<br>
spray air pressure: 200 kPa;<br>
Inlet air temperature in drying step: 75°C, drying time: 15 minutes.<br><comparative example><br>
A granulated product was produced as in Example 1, except that powders excluding the low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose in Example 1 were prepared in the composition in Table 2.<br><comparative examples and><br>
Granulated products were produced as in Example 1, except that low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose (L-HPC) (hydroxypropoxyl group 10.9% by weight, average particle size 44<br>
lira,   specific surface area 0.92 m2/g, bulk density 0.44 g/ml, repose angle 39°, elastic recovery ratio 3.8%, swollen volume change ratio 250%, swollen volume change rate 200%/min) was used<br>
instead of the low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose in Example<br><br>
Table 2 shows results obtained by observing the granulated products of the respective formulae, in terms of a flowing state of the granulated products in the granulating step.<br>
In the evaluation of a flowing state, if the flowing state is "Excellent", then the flowability is particularly good. If the flowing state is uGood", then the flowability is good. If the flowing state is "Poor" , then the flowability is comparatively poor, and there are indications that blocking (referring to a state in which powder is retained and does not flow in layers) occurs in layers. If the flowing state is "Disable", then the fluid is blocked in layers and cannot flow.<br>
As shown in Table 2, the granulated products in Examples 1 to 3 using Samples 1 to 3 were excellent in flowability, but the flowability of the granulated product in Comparative Example 1 or 2 was poorer than those of Examples 1 to 3 . Furthermore, in Comparative Example 3, the flowability of the granulated powder was lowered during process, and blocking occurred in layers, so that it was impossible to complete granulation.<br><br><br><drug solubility of examples to and comparative><br>
The granulated products obtained in Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2 were tested in an amount of 1800 mg (containing 90 mg of nifedipine) following Paddle method of Dissolution Test in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia Fifteenth Edition. As the conditions for Dissolution Test, the rotational speed was set to 100 rpm, and 900 ml of water was used as a test fluid. For the sake of reference, 90 mg of nifedipine bulk powder was also tested in a similar manner. Table 3 shows the results.<br>
All of the granulated products in Examples 1 to 3 exhibited solubility higher than that of the granulated products of the comparative examples. On the other hand, the granulated product<br><br>
of Comparative Example 2 exhibited solubility improved more than that in a case in which the disintegrant was not added (Comparative Example 1) , but the degree of the improvement was smaller than that of the examples. On the contrary, in a case where the amount of the disintegrant was large (Comparative Example 3) , blocking occurred during fluidized bed granulation, and thus it was difficult to perform good granulation.<br>
In the evaluation above, it has been confirmed that the granulated products of the solid dispersions of the present invention allow the drug to be dissolved rapidly and at high rate.<br><br><examples to and comparative examples><br>
Using the granulated products prepared in Examples 1 to 3 as powders for tableting, 201 mg of tablets were produced (Examples 4 to 6) by adding 0.5% by weight of magnesium stearate as a lubricant to the powders for tableting, mixing the resultants,<br><br>
and processing the mixtures in a rotary tableting machine (Vergo manufactured by Kikusui Seisakusho Ltd.) at a molding pressure of 20 kg/cm2. As comparative examples, using granulated products prepared in Comparative Examples 1 and 2 as powders for tableting, tablets were produced (Comparative Examples 4 and 5) as in Example 4. The obtained tablets were tested in terms of hardness and disintegration. Table 4 shows the results.<br>
The tablets obtained in Examples 4 to 6 exhibited appropriate hardness and excellent disintegration. On the other hand, in the tablets obtained in Comparative Examples 4 and 5, appropriate hardness was obtained but the disintegration time became longer.<br><br>
-Drug solubility of Examples 4 to 6 and Comparative Examples 4 id 5&gt;<br><br>
Dissolution Test as in Examples 1 to 3 was performed on 1809 mg of the tablets (containing 90 mg of nifedipine) obtained in Examples 4 to 6 and Comparative Examples 4 and 5. Furthermore, for the sake of reference, 90 mg of nifedipine bulk powder was also tested in a similar manner. Table 5 shows the results.<br>
In the tablets obtained in Examples 4 to 6, the dissolution rate was by no means inferior to that from the granulated products. On the other hand, in the tablet in which the low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose serving as the disintegrant was not added (Comparative Example 4) and the tablet obtained in Comparative Example 5, the solubility was not substantially improved.<br>
In the evaluation above, it has been confirmed that the tablets of the solid dispersions of the present invention have excellent disintegration, and rapid and high solubility.<br><br><examples to><br>
Granulated products were obtained as in Examples 1 to 3,<br><br>
using predetermined amounts (listed in Table 6) of nifedipine, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), lactose (Pharmatose manufactured by DMV International), and cornstarch (cornstarch W manufactured by NIHON SHOKDHIN KAK0) , in the mixing ratios in Table 6.<br>
Table 6 shows results obtained by observing the granulated products of the respective formulae, in terms of a flowing state of the granulated products in the granulating step.<br>
In the evaluation of a flowing state, if the flowing state is "Excellent", then the flowability is particularly good. If the flowing state is "Good*, then the flowability is good. Examples 7 to 10 exhibited good flowability.<br><br>

Using the granulated products prepared in Examples 7 and 8 as powders for tableting, tablets were produced (Examples 11 and 12) as in Examples 4 to S in which 0 .5% by weight of magnesium stearate was added as a lubricant and mixed with the powders for tableting. The obtained tablets were tested in terms of hardness and disintegration as in Examples 4 to 6. Table 8 shows the results.<br>
The tablets obtained in Examples 11 and 12 exhibited appropriate hardness and excellent disintegration.<br><br><br><drug solubility of examples and><br>
Dissolution Test from tablets was performed as in Examples 4 to 6, on 1890 mg of the tablets (containing 90 mg of nifedipine) obtained in Examples 11 and 12. Table 9 shows the results.<br>
In the tablets obtained in Examples 11 and 12, the dissolution rate of the drug was by no means inferior to that from the granulated powders. Furthermore, the solubility was improved by increasing the amount of the disintegrant added.<br>
In the evaluation above, it has been confirmed that the tablets of the solid dispersions of the present invention have excellent disintegration, and rapid and high solubility.<br><br><br><br>
