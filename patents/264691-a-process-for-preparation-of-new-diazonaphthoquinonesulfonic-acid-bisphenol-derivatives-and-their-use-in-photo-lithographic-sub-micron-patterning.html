(Formula Removed) <br><br>
Where DNQ represents a 2-Diazo-1-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonyl, 2-Diazo-1-naphthoquinone-5-sulfonyl, 1-Diazo-2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonyl groups and R, R1 represents an alkyl, aryl and substituted aryl groups.<br>
A positive photoresist composition includes (A) An alkali-soluble resin, in which part of phenolic hydroxyl groups, (B) A diazonaphthoquinonesulfonic esters and (C) A compound, which generates an acid upon irradiation of light with a wavelength of 365 nm. This positive photoresist composition can form a fine pattern of about sub micron (0.5 micron) in the photolithographic process using i-ray (365 nm) is excellent in focal depth range properties in such an ultra fine region and has a high sensitivity.<br>
Photoresist compositions are used in micro lithography processes for making miniaturized electronic components such as in the fabrication computer chips and integrated circuits. Generally, in these processes a coating film of a photo resist composition is first applied to a substrate material, such as silicon wafers used for making integrated circuits. The coated substrate is then baked to evaporate any solvent in the photoresist composition and to fix the coating onto the substrate. The baked coated surface of the substrate is next subjected to an image wise exposure to radiation<br>
This radiation exposure causes a chemical transformation in the exposed areas of the coated surface. Visible light, ultraviolet (UV) light, electron beam and X-ray radiant energy are the radiation types commonly used today in micro lithographic processes. After this image wise exposure, the coated substrate is treated with a developer solution to dissolve and remove either the radiation-exposed or the unexposed areas of the coated surface of the substrate.<br>
There are two types of photo resist composition, negative working and positive working. When negative working photoresist compositions are exposed image-wise to radiation, the areas of the resist composition exposed to the radiation become less soluble to a developer solution (e.g. a cross-linking reaction occurs) while the unexposed area of the photoresist coating remain relatively soluble in such a solution. Thus, treatment of an exposed negative-working resist with a developer causes removal of the non-exposed areas of the photoresist coating and the creation of a negative image in the coating. Thereby uncovering a desired portion of the underlying substrate surface on which the photoresist composition was deposited.<br>
On the other hand, when positive-working photoresist compositions are exposed image-wise to radiation, those areas of the photoresist composition exposed to the radiation become more soluble to the developer solution (e.g. a rearrangement reaction occurs) while those areas not exposed remain relatively insoluble to the developer solution. Thus treatment of an exposed positive-working photoresist with the developer causes removal of the exposed areas of the coating and the creation of a positive image in the photoresist coating. Again, a desired portion of the underlying substrate surface is uncovered.<br>
After this development operation, the now partially unprotected substrate may be treated with a substrate-etchant solutions, plasma gases, or have metal or metal composition deposited in the spaces of the substrate where the photoresist coating was removed during development. The areas of the substrate where the photoresist coating still remains are protected. Later, the remaining areas of the photoresist coating may be removed during a stripping operation, leaving a patterned substrate surface. In some instances it is desirable to heat treat the remaining photoresist layer, after the development step before the etching step, to increase its adhesion to the underlying substrate.<br>
Positive-acting photoresists comprising novolak resins and diazonaphthoquinone compounds as photoactive compounds are well known in the art. Condensing formaldehyde and one or more multi-substituted phenols, in the presence of an acid catalyst, such as oxalic acid, typically produce Novolak resins. Photoactive compounds are generally obtained by reacting multihydroxyphenolic<br>
compounds with diazonaphtoquinonesulforiic acids or their derivatives. Novolaks may also be reacted with diazonaphtoquinonesulforiic acid and combined with a polymer.<br>
Additives, such as surfactants, are often added to a photoresist composition to improve the coating uniformity of the photoresist film.<br>
The prepared photoresist composition solution, can be applied to a substrate by spin coating, for example the photoresist solution can be adjusted with respect to the percentages of solids content, in order to provide coating of the desired thickness, given the type of spinning equipment utilized and the amount of time allowed for the spinning process.<br>
The photoresist coatings produced by the desired procedure are particularly suitable for application to silicon /silicon dioxide oxide coated wafers, such as are utilized in the production of microprocessors and other miniaturized integrated circuits components. The substrate may also comprise various polymeric resins especially transparent polymers such as novolak resin. The substrate may have an adhesion promoted layer of a suitable, such as one containing HMDS.<br>
Photoresist sample are filtered with first two prefiltered of porosity 2 micron. Then filtration by 0.45 micron filters twice. Similarly filtration by 0.20 micron filters twice.<br>
For the preparation of photolithographic plate, we have taken 3g of novolak resin in 10ml of cellosolve acetate stirred for 10 mints, for this solution 300mg of photoactivaing compound is added, stirred for 10 mints. This photoresist material was filtered through 0.2 micron filters to remove undissolved particles. The viscosity of the photoresist composition is 20 cSt. After completion of filtration this photoresist material is ready for coating on silicon wafer. Before coating silicon wafer, silicon wafer cleaning is important. First cone. H2S04 washing followed by fuming HNO3 washing to remove inorganic impurities after this, the wafer was washed with D.I water several times, then with appropriate organic solvents (acetone, MeOH) to remove any water insoluble other impurities. After completion of washing dried in oven at 150°C for 30 mints.<br>
The prepared photoresist material was coated on the silicon wafer using with 2000-4000 RPM speed and one can get 1.5-1.0 micron thickness layer on the silicon<br>
plate. After completion of coating, photoresist coated silicon wafer are put in oven at 90°C for 30 mints to remove volatile solvents from the coating (this is called soft baking). After completion of soft bake, photomask is aligned on the photoresist coated silicon wafer and exposed to UV light (365 mn) for 10 sec.<br>
After completion of all this operations developed photoresist wafers are hard bake at 120°C for 30 mints. All this operations are conducted under yellow light/amber safe light. After completion of these operations the wafers are developed using tetramethylammoniumhydroxide (TMAH), very diluted aqueous alkaline solution to remove exposed areas of the photoresist, in the presence of UV light diazoaphthoquinonesulfonic acid bisphenol derivative loses molecular nitrogen leading to the formation of ketocarbene which rearranges to a unstable ketene and this in the presence of solvent medium, finally formation of corresponding indene carboxylic acid takes place. Thus formed acid goes into 2.38% developer aqueous alkaline solution with in 15 sec, development is very good one can get very fine pattern with fingers opened up at 0.5 micron. The results obtained are given in Table.<br>

51.90g (0.480 mole) m-Cresol, 1.94g (0.017 mole) p-Cresol, 13.86g (0.113 mole) 2,3-Xylenol, 43.62g (1.454 mole) aqueous solution of formaldehyde were charged in a three-necked flask of one-liter capacity equipped with a stirrer, a reflux condenser and a thermometer, and 0.226g (0.001 mole) oxalic acid dihydrate was added thereto while stirring the mixture at 90°C. After 30 minutes, the bath temperature was raised to 130°C, and the reaction mixture was further stirred for 3 hours and 30 minutes under reflux. Subsequently, the reflux condenser was replaced with a Liebig condenser, and the bath temperature was raised to 200°C. Over about 1 hour, followed by removal of unreacted formalin, water and the like. After the distillation the reaction was carried out further 1 hour under atmospheric pressure, the pressure was gradually reduced to 1mm Hg and unreacted monomers and the like were distilled off. The distillation under reduced pressure took 2 hours.<br>
The temperature was lowered to room temperature and the melted alkali-soluble novolak resin was recovered (Scheme 1). The weight average molecular weight of the thus-obtained novolak resin was 2400-5400 in terms of polystyrene.<br>

Sodium salt of diazonaphthoquinonesulfonate (2.72g, 0.01 mol) was taken in to 25 ml_ of dichloromethane and cooled to -50°C. Added triethylamine (2.02g, 0.02mol) to the above solution and maintained the temperature at -50°C. Then added triphosgene (3.2g, 0.01 mol) in 15 mL dichloromethane very slowly and maintaining the temperature at -50°C with stirring over a period of 20 min. The reaction mixture was stirred magnetically for 60 min at -50°C and then the reaction mixture was brought to 0°C. The conversion of diazonaphthalenesulfonic acid or its sodium salt to the corresponding sulfonylchloride can be conveniently monitored by UV-Visible absorption spectrometry. To the reaction mixture added bisphenol (0.0047mol) in 3 mL dichloromethane and followed by triethylamine (2.02g, 0.02mol) in 3 mL dichloromethane. Stirring was continued for the 60 min at 0°C. Reaction mixture was brought to room temperature, dichloromethane and triethylamine was distilled off at room temperature under vacuum. The remaining solid residue was mixed with cold soda water (0.9 g, Na2C03 in 25 mL water) and stirred for 10 min. The solid was filtered, washed with copious amounts of water and dried in a vacuum desiccator containing phosphorus pentoxide. All these operations were conducted in<br>
a yellow room/dark room. After the isolation of the ester product was photolysed (365 nm) to ascertain photoactivating property. The ester formation can be conveniently monitored by UV-Visible absorption spectrometry. The yield is quantitative.<br>

sulfonicacid bisphenol derivatives (Excluding light)<br>
Sodium salt of diazonaphthoquinonesulfonate (10.88g, 0.04mol) was taken in to 100 mL of dichloromethane and cooled to -50°C. Added triethylamine (8.08g, 0.08mol) to the above solution and maintained the temperature at -50°C. Then added triphosgene (12.17g, 0.041mol) in 60 mL dichloromethane very slowly and maintaining the temperature at -50°C with stirring over a period of 20 min. The reaction mixture was stirred magnetically for 60 min at -50°C and then the reaction mixture was brought to 0°C. The conversion of diazonaphthalenesulfonic acid or its sodium salt to the corresponding sulfonylchloride can be conveniently monitored by UV-Visible  absorption  spectrometry.   To  the   reaction   mixture  added   bisphenol<br>
 (0.0188mol) in 15 ml_ dichloromethane and followed by triethylamine (8.08g, 0.08mol) in 15 mL dichloromethane. Stirring was continued for the 60 min at 0°C. Reaction mixture was brought to room temperature, dichloromethane and triethylamine was distilled off at room temperature under vacuum. The remaining solid residue was mixed with cold soda water (3.6g, Na2CO3 in 100 mL water) and stirred for 10 min. The solid was filtered, washed with copious amounts of water and dried in a vacuum desiccator containing phosphorus pentoxide. All these operations were conducted in a yellow room/dark room. After the isolation of the ester product was photolysed (365 nm) to ascertain photoactivating property. The ester formation can be conveniently monitored by UV-Visible absorption spectrometry. The yield is quantitative.<br>
General procedure for the preparation of bisphenols:<br>
Gaseous hydrogen chloride was passed gradually into a mixture of two moles phenol and one mole of ketone while stirring and maintaining the mixture at temperature between 15-20°C. A total of hydrogen chloride was added in a period of 3 hours. Reaction mixture color change is observed. The mixture was then dissolved with heating in chlorobenzene and washed with two portions of nearly boiling water to remove hydrogen chloride there from the chlorobenzene layer was next neutralized. Water, chlorobenzene and unreacted phenol were distilled off at atmospheric pressure. The pressure was then reduced and the distillation continued until phenol no longer distilled from the mixture. The yield of the reaction is quantitative. ADVANTAGES<br>
