				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to tea tablets and, in particular, black tea tablets<br>
selectively adapted to favour ready and convenient consumption of tea with good<br>
taste and flavour as well as better shelf life vis-a-vis conventionally available<br>
brewed tea. The invention is also directed to the process for manufacture of black<br>
tea tablets for achieving synergistic combination on one hand favour providing the<br>
tea in convenient to handle and consume tablet form and on the other hand retain<br>
the desired taste and flavour of tea. The tea tablets of the invention which enable<br>
consumption of tea by direct chewing, sucking or by simple dissolving the tablet in<br>
hot or cold water is a unique specialty directed to meet the need for wide<br>
acceptability of tea as a cost-effective, convenient and tasteful beverage by<br>
providing for variety and convenience in its manner of. consumption, thereby<br>
making tea more acceptable as a fast and ready beverage for today's fast lifestyle<br>
of individuals. The black tea tablets of the invention apart from being convenient<br>
to use and consume, is also of desired shelf life and very convenient for carrying<br>
from one place to another. The tea tablet can be advantageously obtained of<br>
varying flavour and taste to meet the diverse and varied taste and flavour<br>
requirements of wide ranging consumers thereby making tea more attractive and<br>
tasteful throughout the world.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Tea is well known all over the world especially as a hot refreshing beverage. Tea<br>
as a beverage is mostly brewed from black tea. The conventional process of<br>
manufacturing black tea involves processing of plucked green tea leaves including<br>
withering, maceration, and fermentation, and drying operation. Usually such<br>
manufacturing process lead to black tea particles of varying sizes, which are<br>
graded according to the size and market requirements. It Is also known to blend<br>
grade and variety of sources to provide desired taste and flavour to tea. The<br>
processing involving fermentation causes the cotouriess green leaf polyphenols to<br>
undergo indigenous enzyme mediated oxidation to produce colour poly phenols<br>
called Theaflavins (TF) and Theamblgins (TR). These colour polyphenols are<br>
responsible for imparting colour characteristics to black tea and its liquor quality<br>
and characteristics. Also, the insoluble generated during fermentation can be cold<br>
or hot water insoluble. More importantly, many compounds present in black tea are<br>
only sparingly soluble in cold water, which usually affects the taste of tea when<br>
1<br><br>
brewed in cold water, and also contribute towards unwanted turbidity to the<br>
brewed tea as a beverage. Accordingly usually traditional black tea leaves brewed<br>
in cold-water result In a beverage weak in both colour and taste. Thus black tea is<br>
usually known for brewing in the hot and boillng water.<br>
US 6,761,918 discloses a method of processing black tea leaves to produce black<br>
tea particles, wherein the maceration is directed to producing dhools of varying<br>
grades; followed by Fennenting the dhools; spraying the fermented dhools with a<br>
tea extract solution, the extract solution consisting of a solution of specially made<br>
cold water soluble tea extract; drying the tea dhools, the drying lowering the<br>
moisture content and ceasing the oxidation of the poly phenols by leaf enzymes and<br>
producing black tea which can be brewed in cold water.<br>
US 5250317 disdoses product from treatments of black tea wherein black tea<br>
leaves are oxidized to provide treated leaves from which aqueous tea extracts<br>
which have minimal turbidity, particularly when cooled may be obtained. The<br>
oxidation reaction is performed on black tea leaves, which contain moisture only In<br>
an amount such that the oxidation reaction occurs at located sites on and within<br>
the tea leaf structure.<br>
US 6811799 discloses manufacture of improved black tea wherein fresh tea leaves<br>
or green tea are converted to black tea using tyrosinase oxidation which alters<br>
catechins (a group of green tea polyphenols) toTheaflavins. Theaflavins are unique<br>
black tea polyphenols and a potential anti-sunbum and chemo preventive agents.<br>
The oxidation reaction is performed on leaves which contain moisture only in an<br>
amount that the oxidation reaction occurs under the condition of temperature of<br>
20º-50º C, air or oxygen supply and pH 5-0 to 7.5 at localized sites on or within the<br>
tea leaves structure. The moisture is supplied by moistening fresh tea leaves or dry<br>
green tea to a limited degree with a proper amount and concentration of<br>
monopnenol, catechol and polyphenol oxidases and tyrosinase or their<br>
combinations. Obtained black tea contains much more Theaflavins than regular<br>
black tea and is therefore a more helpful beverage than that produced through the<br>
use of conventionally processed black tea.<br>
US 5,663,736 discloses a powder instant black tea drink mix which would be<br>
readily soluble and free of turbidity problems even when brewed in cold water. The<br>
process involves subjecting the leaves to extraction with hot water at a<br>
temperature of between about 60° and 130° C separating the tea leaves from the<br>
2<br><br>
extract concentrating the first extract to a solid content of between about 5-12%<br>
and cooling the first extract to a temperature of between 5° and 15°C in order to<br>
form an insoluble tea cream which is separated from the first concentrated extract.<br>
This tea cream is mixed with the spent black tea leaves or with green tea leaves to<br>
form a mixture which is extracted with water at a temperature greater than about<br>
70° C in order to obtain a second extract which is separated from the spent leaves.<br>
The first and second extract are mixed, concentrated to the desired solid content<br>
and dried to form the powder drink mix,<br>
It would be dearly evident from the above that black tea constitutes one of the<br>
most commonly accepted tea as a beverage and there has been a continuous need<br>
in the art to provide processes for manufacture of black tea which would retain<br>
desired flavour and taste. Importantly the above state of art reveals tne attempt to<br>
provide for black tea leaves in a form which would also enable Its brewing in cold<br>
water and also favour avoiding problems of turbidity resulting from insoluble<br>
contents.<br>
The above state of art reveals the need for impatting convenience In consumption<br>
of tea retaining desired taste and flavour. Importantly to add to such convenience<br>
various processes have been developed to impart good eye appeal and taste to the<br>
consumer during brewing of black Eea. Moreover, the need for convenience in the<br>
form of the tea is further evident from the provision of instant black tea drink mix.<br>
With the fast changing life-style of Individuals and the fast pace of life in today's<br>
world even the above known varieties of black tea are at times found to be not<br>
ready and convenient versions of tea are not convenient enough for ready<br>
consumption for immediate taste and flavour of tea apart from being also difficult<br>
to maintain desired storage stability. Thus problem with such conventional black<br>
varieties presently available is not only necessarily in terms of its taste and flavour<br>
but essentially complexities in terms of its convenience for ready consumption,<br>
easy and convenient storage stable from of carrying the tea maintating desired<br>
taste and flavour of black tea. Moreover, with the growing concerns on availability<br>
of safe and pure drinking water consumption of brewed tea is again in some places<br>
found to be health hazardous. In particular the conventional black tea in all<br>
presently available forms would require brewing in hot or cold water to generate<br>
desired taste and flavour. Such brewing necessarily requires source of hot or cold<br>
water and also gadgets to pour, store and brew the tea leave before its taste and<br>
flavour is imparted to the beverage. Such procedure of preparation of tea Is<br>
3<br><br>
necessarily time consuming and complex at times in today's fast fife style leading<br>
to the loss of popularity and wide acceptability of tea as a beverage.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for black tea in a<br>
ready to consume tablet form, which would enable direct consumption of tea with<br>
good taste and flavour and would therefore be consumer friendly and readily<br>
acceptable to one and all especially in today's fast lifestyle.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for synergistic black tea<br>
tablets in a form, which can be easily and conveniently carried by Individuals for<br>
ready consumption by chewing or sucking or by simple and fast dissolving in hot or<br>
cold water retaining its usual taste and flavour in a storage stable form.<br>
Yet another abject of the present invention Js to provide for synergistic black tea<br>
tablets, which can be cost-effective and readtfy and safely consumed by chewing,<br>
sucking and or dissolving in hot and cold water with a selective and synergistically<br>
improved taste.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to provide black tea in tablet<br>
form, which would avoid the conventional requirement of allowing for the brewing<br>
of the tea to impart taste and flavour to the beverage and also avoid the problems<br>
of torbidity flowing from insoluble usually found In conventional brewable tea<br>
varieties.<br>
Yet further object of the present Invention is directed to impart convenience factor<br>
in the usual process of tea consumption to meet today's fast changing life-style of<br>
Individuals especially the younger generation who are fond of accepting only ready<br>
and fast consumable products Instead of ground through the hassles of preparation<br>
of tea.<br>
Yet further object to the present invention is directed to a synergistic formulation<br>
for black tea tablets, which would be adapted for consumption by way of chewing,<br>
and/or sucking and/or dissolving In cold water thereby imparting the much<br>
required convenience to drinking/serving tea with good taste of tea and its flavour.<br>
4<br><br>
Yet another object of the present Invention is directed to a formulation for black<br>
tea tablets and its process for manufacture, which would enable imparting<br>
flexibility, and consumer convenience based options of its consumption in variety of<br>
forms, which would be much simpler than even conventional tea bags.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is directed to provide for a formulation<br>
for black tea tablets and its process for manufacture which would have the<br>
convenience of consumption in variety of forms selected from chewing, sucking or<br>
dissolving in hot or cold water and yet have desired shelf life much more than<br>
conventional/instant tea presently available.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to providing black tea tablet<br>
of good taste and flavour wherein the taste and flavour can be modified and made<br>
more consumers selective and acceptable by possible addition of variety of flavour<br>
and taste to the baste tablet formulation.<br>
Yet farther object of the present Invention is directed to provide for black tea in<br>
tablet form by way of selective formulation and process of its manufacture which<br>
would favour arresting quality defcertotatton i.e. the enzymatic deterioration of<br>
quality parameters such as TF In comparison to conventional black tea and its<br>
usual quality detenoration on storage.<br>

	b)	filtering through cotton to obtain filtrate;<br>
	c)	concentrating the filtrate in Thin Flim Evaporator in the temperature<br>
		range of 40 To 70° C preferably at about 50° C to thereby obtain the<br>
		concentrated extract.<br>
Importantly, in accordance with an aspect of the above invention. It Is found that<br>
when the step of exposing the formulation to essential tea flavour Is carried out<br>
subsequent to the tablet formation it selectively and surprisingly favours for<br>
effective flavour imparting, retention and storage stability to the tea tablets.<br>
In the above formulation the binder is preferably selected from Sucrose, Starch,<br>
Fructose-IP or Food grade.<br>
It is found that the above disclosed tea tablet formulation on one hand favours<br>
maintaining the desired tablet form of the tea and on the other hand achieves a<br>
suprising synergistic taste and flavour which facilitates its dtrect consumption by<br>
chewing or sucking to impart desired taste and flavour or black tea. Moreover It is<br>
9<br><br>
also found by way of the invention that by selective use of Sodium Citrate and<br>
binder in combination with the dried tea extract, it is possible to impart special<br>
taste and flavour maintaining desired shelf life for the same.<br>
Advantageously the tea tablet of the invention achieve surprisingly improved taste<br>
and flavour of black tea even at much tower levels of dried tea extract than that<br>
usually used to make a conventional cup of tea. Such an aspect of the formulation<br>
provides for significant economizing of the provision of tea for consumption with<br>
good taste and flavour for its wide scaJe popularity and consumption in a<br>
convenient form for readily acceptability in any pttrt of the worid.<br>
The tea tablets as above can also include optional flavouring agents such as<br>
Ginger, Cardamom, Rose Mint, Raspberry, Strawberry, Vanilla and like flavours.<br>
Importantly it is found by way of the present Invention that the tea tabtets<br>
produced not only retain more flavour and taste than the Inherent characteristic of<br>
the conventional brewed tea but also more importantly provides convenience and<br>
much desired flexibility in its use and manner of consumption. The convenience of<br>
the tea tablets of the invention is such that it can he carried in phials or in<br>
aluminium strip/blister packs anywhere. Moreover the taste and flavour of the tea<br>
tablets are found to have desired higher shelf life than conventional tea, which<br>
again adds to its convenience.<br>

mom temperature. Next the mix was ground, dried about 60° C and compressed<br>
using tabteting machine to obtain the tea tablets. Finally the tablets were exposed<br>
to essential flavour in a chamber for retention of good flavour by the tablet.<br>
The tablets obtained as above were found to be readily taken by chewing/sucking<br>
or dissolving in hot or cold water for a refreshing drink with good taste and flavour.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Under this example the same set: of procedures as under example 1 above were<br>
followed except that the flavour was obtained at the time of mixing of the<br>
ingredients and not following the step pf post tablet exposure to Flavour.<br>
A comparative analysis of the taste and flavour retention and storage stability<br>
revealed that the tablets obtained following the post tablet exposure to flavour<br>
retained better flavour and taste as compared to the tablets having flavour added<br>
prior to tablet formation. Importantly, considering the readily and instant<br>
consumption of the tablets of the invention, such improved retention of flavour and<br>
taste was found important and of extreme relevance to the characteristics of the<br>
tea tablet of the inversion.<br>
11<br><br>
EXAMPLE 3-6<br>
Under the following Examples 3 to 6 tea tablets suitable for direct consumption by<br>
chewing or sucking were obtained as detailed hereunder In Table I:<br><br>
The tea taster for identification of quality subjected the tea tablets obtained as<br>
above to perception test- The results obtained revealed the following results as<br>
provided in the Table II hereunder:<br><br>
As would be apparent from the above, In accordant with an aspect of the<br>
invention the selective advantages In the use of the selective combination of<br>
ingredients in the tablet formulation in achieving the desired quality are dearly<br>
apparent.<br>
12<br><br>
In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, the amount of dried tea<br>
extract required in the tablet of the invention to achieve comparable characteristics<br>
as that of conventional tea was studied and the results are detailed hereunder In<br>
Table III:<br>
Comparative study of taste and shelf life of the tea tablets used in accordance with<br>
the invention vis-a-vis the conventional black tea.<br><br>
It would be clearly apparent from the above that the tea tablets of the Invention<br>
involving less amount of dried tea extract apart from being of improved storage<br>
stability due to its bonded form are able to provide better or atteast comparable<br>
Caste and flavour in lesser amount of the tea extract vis-a-vis higher amount of<br>
black tea used for conventional cup of tea. This provides for the selective<br>
synengistic combination in the formulation of the invention, which is also<br>
advantageous being directed significantly economical as regards need for lesser<br>
quantity of tea extract in the formulation to achieve like flavour and taste.<br>
13<br><br>
It is thus possible by way of the present invention to provide for black tea in a<br>
ready to consume tablet form, which would enable direct consumption of tea with<br>
good taste and flavour and would therefore be consumer friendly and readily<br>
acceptable to one and all especially in today's fast lifestyle. The synergistic black<br>
tea tablets in a form, which can be easily and conveniently carried by individuate<br>
For ready consumption by chewing or sucking or by simple and fast dissolving in<br>
hot or cold water retaining its usual taste and flavour in a storage stable form. The<br>
tea tablets being cost-effective and yet attractive for consumption given the<br>
convenience of its consumption and storage stability is supposed to provide for<br>
wide popularity and acceptability of tea tablets as an effectively tasted and<br>
flavoured tea product.<br>
Importantly, the tea tablets of the invention would avoid the conventional<br>
requirement of allowing for the brewing of the tea to impart taste and flavour to<br>
the beverage and also avoid the problems of turbidity flowing from insoluble<br>
usually found in conventional brew able tea varieties. The tea tablets would thus<br>
impart convenience factor in the usual process of tea consumption to meet today's<br>
fast changing Iife-style of individuals especially the younger generation who are<br>
fond of accepting only ready and fast consumable products instead of going<br>
through the hassles of preparation of tea. Also the tea tablets which are supposed<br>
to maintain good amounts of health ingredients such as antioxidants properties,<br>
and-carcinogenic properties, anti-hypertensive, lower cholesterol Of blood, glucose<br>
(evets will also be beneficial to impart the much desired characteristics ready form<br>
of tea for fast and reedy consumption by individuate as a health safeguarding<br>
product formulation apart from serving as a ready refreshment.<br>
