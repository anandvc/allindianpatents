The present invention concerns a honeycomb body having a top side, an underside, a first end and a second end. and two lateral edge regions, wherein the honeycomb body has a flattened cross-sectional region and wound sheet metal layers. They are preferably already coated with catalytic active "material. At least a portion of the sheet metal layers is structured. The invention further provides a silencer or muffler for an exhaust gas system of an internal combustion engine and a housing having a top shell portion, and a bottom shell portion which form a cavity and also a process for the production of a honeycomb body having a top side, an underside, a first end and a second end and two lateral edge regions.<br>
Honeycomb Bodies which have a plurality of passages through which a fluid can flow and which are surrounded by a metallic tubular casing are known for example from EP 0 049 489, EP 0 121 174. EP 0 121 175, EP 0 245 737 or EP 0 245 738. They show different basic forms of catalytic converter carrier bodies which are preferably used in exhaust systems of motor vehicle internal combustion engines.<br>
In the case of small engines, being engines with a cubic capacity of less than 250 cc, in particular less than 50 cc, for example in the case of motor-driven saws, lawnmowers or the like, in particular honeycomb bodies which are of small dimensions for exhaust gas cleaning are used. In such arrangements, for reasons of space, the honeycomb bodies often have to be arranged in a partitioning wall in a cup-like enlargement of the exhaust gas system, with the cup-like enlargement simultaneously performing a sound-damping function.<br>
Such is known for example from OE 38 29 668 or US No. 3 597 165. EP 0 470 113 also describes a honeycomb body which is fitted in a partitioning wall extending substantially perpendicularly to the through-flow direction. Features disclosed therein for small engines can also be used in this invention.<br><br>
2<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a honeycomb body which, by virtue of its structure, has a particular degree of stability in respect of its sheet layers relative to each other. A further object of the invention is to provide a silencer or muffler and a housing with which the honeycomb body co-operates in a space-saving and stabilising fashion. Still another object of the invention is to provide a process for the production of a honeycomb body for the previous aims.<br>
That object is attained by a honeycomb body having the features of claim 1, a silencer having the features of claim 20. a housing having the features of claim 28 and a process having the features of claim 30. Advantageous developments are recited in the respective appendant claims.<br>
A honeycomb body having a top side, an underside, a first end and a second end as well as a first lateral edge region and a second lateral edge region has a flattened cross-sectional region and wound sheet layers. Of the sheet layers, at least a portion is structured, while the wound sheet layers are preferably already coated with catalytically active material. All sheet layers have a first common fixing zone arranged in the first lateral edge region. Unlike the situation with round honeycomb bodies which for example have transverse struts in the honeycomb body, the honeycomb body according to the invention is flattened, or made oblate, which of itself already imparts a particular degree of stability to the honeycomb body. On the other hand the flattened or oblate cross-sectional region makes it possible to prevent all sheet layers from suffering from so-called "telescoping" by virtue of the provision of the fixing zone in the lateral edge region. It is precisely in a situation involving vibrations occurring over a prolonged period of time on a honeycomb body that the honeycomb body suffers from the risk of individual layers coming loose and coming out at the ends of the honeycomb body. That however is prevented by virtue of the provision of the common fixing zone. In addition the fixing zone forms a location of particular stability for the entire honeycomb body. That is preferably achieved by at least a first and a second common fixing zone, wherein the first common fixing zone is arranged in the first lateral edge region of the honeycomb body and the second common fixing zone is arranged in the second edge region of the honeycomb body. The common fixing zones may each involve a respective point or spot region, but they may also each extend along a respective line. It is preferred if two common fixing zones are disposed approximately in opposite relationship. That particularly stabilises the honeycomb body. In addition that affords advantages from the production procedure point of view as production steps which are necessary under some circumstances for the fixing zones are effected at approximately the same level on both lateral edge regions. The arrangement of the fixing zones is in particular also to be so selected that the honeycomb<br><br>
3<br>
body has one or more preferential directions in which it enjoys particular strength.<br>
A common fixing zone can be formed for example by all sheet layers being squeezed together in said zone. If the sheet layers are wound, that winding is effected in the region of the fixing zone in such a way that the sheet layers come to bear snugly against each other. They can no longer be displaced by virtue of the friction which obtains between them. The mobility of the sheet layers, which is prevented by the friction involved, can be enhanced and also replaced by a durable connection of at least outward sides to adjacent inward sides of the sheet layers relative to each other. That can be effected by soldering, welding, adhesive means or other possible forms of connection. That also includes structural configurations in respect of the sheet layers, which ensure that outward and inward sides involve a positively locking engagement. These can involve interlacing configurations, tooth configurations or also notch configurations as well as corresponding fold configurations of the sheet layers.<br>
A portion of the sheet layers is structured. In order however that all sheet layers provide a fixing zone which is arranged in the lateral edge region, the structurings must be flattened there at least to such an extent that adjacent inward and outward sides come to bear against each other. Such a flattening is promoted by virtue of the fact that, in the region of the fixing zone, the structurings of the structured sheet layer are at least smaller than in the rest of the flattened cross-sectional region. The shaping of the flattened cross-sectional region can in that way be of a regular configuration at least in a certain portion and a transition in respect of the structuring can then be limited to the region of the fixing zone and regions adjacent thereto. That permits the honeycomb body to be constructed with preferential directions in respect of its elasticity characteristic and in respect of its strength characteristic.<br>
In particular a corrugation configuration, a curvature configuration, a scallop configuration or a fold configuration in a sheet fall to be considered as the structuring. It may also have microstructures as well as small incisions and openings. In regard to the structuring and the nature and form of the layer, attention is directed in particular to EP 0 484 364, WO 93/20339. EP 0 152 560 and DE 296 11 143.<br>
Even if a honeycomb body according to the invention obviates the risk of telescoping of one or more sheet layers, the honeycomb body in an advantageous configuration nonetheless enjoys a degree of flexibility. That permits it to adapt itself to its location of installation and to react to vibration, jarring and impacts without material damage. For that purpose the honeycomb body is of such a construction in a layer-wise manner that at least a portion<br><br>
4<br>
of one of the layers is flexible. In an embodiment of a layer of that kind comprising a structured sheet and a non-structured sheet flexibility is achieved by virtue of the yielding nature of the structuring. It can be of a corrugated, folded or also other configuration. In another embodiment flexibility is achieved by spacing of the sheets forming the sheet layer. When the honeycomb body is compressed, it is elastically deformable at least as long as the spacing between the two sheets of the layer has not yet been closed up.<br>
Another configuration of the honeycomb body is such that it is wound, produced in a layered arrangement or made up from sheet metal or at least in part from ceramic, in such a way that the honeycomb body retains its shape even under load. That includes a certain degree of elasticity of at least a portion of the. honeycomb body. In the event of the honeycomb body being overloaded, in a development it has predetermined areas which suffer plastic deformation. They are then capable of preventing the honeycomb body from being destroyed by absorption of the deformation energy. The durability in respect of shape of the honeycomb body can be put to use insofar as it can serve as a load-bearing portion of a structure.<br>
By virtue of the fixing zones, not only is the honeycomb body itself particularly stable and strong, but rather that stability can also be put to use in conjunction with other components which surround or are disposed in the proximity of the honeycomb body. Besides stabilisation by the fixing zones it may therefore be advantageous if the honeycomb body has means for additional positional fixing of at least a portion of the honeycomb body. They are capable of absorbing forces which act on or in the honeycomb body, and thus relieving the load on the connection of the sheet layers at the common fixing zone. In a further development those means are also capable of imparting stability to the honeycomb body and adjacent components. It is possible to use as such means for example strut means, reinforcement means, pins or the line which are disposed in or on the honeycomb body. ,<br>
An advantageous embodiment of the honeycomb body is of such a configuration that its layer construction is also used as a means for additional positional fixing. The corresponding sheet layer has a first sheet and a second sheet, wherein the first sheet is thicker than the second sheet. For reasons of elasticity it is particularly desirable for the thinner second sheet to be structured while the first sheet bears on or against that structure. If in contrast the notion of stability is to the fore, the first sheet has a structure. If it is necessary for the honeycomb body to have different properties in different regions, for example by virtue of its manner of installation, the construction of a layer may be varied by changing the structuring and non-structuring of a sheet, or both sheets may also be<br><br>
5<br>
structured.<br>
In a further, extremely stable embodiment of a honeycomb body at least one of the two fixing zones bears against a reinforcement. That reinforcement may be an additional sheet insert, a reinforced sheet but also a wall. Likewise a component which is arranged around the honeycomb body may serve as the reinforcement. A particular configuration in accordance with this concept involves making a portion of the honeycomb body a wall of a silencer or muffler, for example by arranging the layers of the honeycomb body around a wall. The same also applies however in regard to a wall of an exhaust gas system. That wall of the exhaust gas system and in particular the silencer or muffler may serve to subdivide the flow of gas but equally also to guide the flow thereof. For example bend systems which bring together the individual pipes or ducts from the engine block are known. They can now be of such a design configuration that one or more walls of that system are formed by the honeycomb body. In addition silencers or mufflers are also known, which are subdivided by partitioning walls. Those partitioning walls may also be a component of a honeycomb body. The wall around which the sheet layers are arranged or which is a component of the honeycomb body desirably has means for positioning the sheet layers. Equally however the layers arranged around the wall may have that. The wall/layer co-operation then provides for a particular fixing effect as well as an enhanced level of stability. The means for mutual positioning are recess means, teeth or notch means which the layer and/or the wall have and which fix them together.<br>
The honeycomb body with a flattened cross-sectional region and at least two common fixing zones for all sheet layers which are respectively arranged at the lateral edge regions is also suitable for the honeycomb body itself being a component of a portion of an exhaust gas system. That means that the honeycomb body is no longer embedded in the exhaust gas system but rather forms a flow portion, upstream and downstream of which other flow portions of the exhaust gas system are connected thereto. For that purpose the honeycomb body does not necessarily need a tubular casing which is disposed around it. On the contrary the honeycomb body forms the tubular casing itself. The honeycomb body can then be connected thereat to the respective flow portions of the exhaust gas system.<br>
A preferred area of use of the honeycomb body is in a catalytic converter arrangement in an exhaust gas system of an internal combustion engine, in particular a small engine. In that case the honeycomb body is disposed in a space in the exhaust gas system. A particularly space-saving arrangement is afforded if the honeycomb body is disposed in a silencer or muffler of the exhaust gas system. That space-saving construction in conjunction with the non-telescopability of the honeycomb body also permits accurate matching of<br><br>
6<br>
the dimensions as between a silencer or muffler of an exhaust gas system of an internal combustion engine and a honeycomb body according to the invention. A suitably designed silencer or muffler therefore has means which are intended to receive a honeycomb body of that kind. In accordance with this aspect of the invention, for example for reasons of easy manageability of installation of the silencer or muffler in the exhaust gas system it is preferable for the honeycomb body to be integrated into the silencer or muffler. A simplification in terms of integration is also afforded by the silencer or muffler having means for fixing the honeycomb body. The means for holding same may also embody this. Suitable means for receiving. integration and/or fixing purposes are walls of the silencer or muffler as well as projections in the silencer or muffler but also transverse web or bar portions or regions which are shaped to correspond to the honeycomb body.<br>
A development of a silencer or muffler of that kind provides at least in respect of a portion thereof means which are intended for engagement into at least one layer of the honeycomb body. They serve for fixing purposes but they can also have a stabilising effect. Teeth, recesses or the like or also curvature portions can be used as such means, in which case, when the honeycomb body is arranged in relation to a wall of the silencer or muffler, it then has the appropriate means. As the honeycomb body itself has a material value which can be increased by a catalytic coating the silencer or muffler is desirably so designed that the honeycomb body can be interchangeably fitted in position. That also affords an advantage in another respect. When the honeycomb body has reached a condition in which, used as a catalytic converter, it no longer operates in accordance with the statutory requirements, it is possible to replace just the catalytic converter alone. The exhaust gas system as such does not then also need to be replaced. Structural matching of the silencer or muffler and the honeycomb body in that way is found to be environmentally friendly and saves time in regard also to recycling and reutilising used vehicles or other used articles.<br>
In a further embodiment of a silencer or muffler with a honeycomb body as described hereinbefore a part of the silencer or muffler exerts a force, in particular a clamping force, on the honeycomb body. That can be effected by the means for holding the honeycomb body and also by the means for fixing same. The force prevents the honeycomb body or one or more sheet layers thereof from shifting out of the inserted position thereof when the silencer or muffler is in operation over a prolonged period of time. An effect of that kind can be enhanced by a portion of the honeycomb body being squeezed by the silencer or muffler.<br>
Apart from the areas of use described hereinbefore, in relation to exhaust gas systems of internal combustion engines, the invention however also affords<br><br>
7<br>
a compact, stable and at the same time particularly robust arrangement of a honeycomb body as described above. For that purpose a top shell portion and a bottom shell portion of a housing form a cavity, wherein the housing has a receiving means for a wall which separates the cavity into two regions. The honeycomb body is now arranged around that partitioning wall. The honeycomb body, like also the housing, may have all features as described hereinbefore. The housing may therefore be a silencer or muffler, but equally it may also be a component of a chemical or other installation in which a construction of that kind is required.<br>
The invention further provides a process for the production of a honeycomb body having a top side, an underside, a first end and a second end and at least a first lateral edge region. wnerein the honeycomb body has a flattened cross-sectional region with wound metal sheet jayers. of which at least a portion is structured. The proocess involves the following steps:<br>
1. forming a layer.<br>
2. winding the layer around itself or around a reinforcement, in that<br>
operation,<br>
3. forming the lateral edge region with<br>
4. production of a first fixing zone corresponding to those of the<br>
honeycomb body described hereinbefore.<br>
The layer is coated with a catalytically active material prior to or after the winding operation, whereby the honeycomb body produced can itself be used as a catalytic converter. Accordingly it is used in exhaust gas systems of internal combustion engines, in particular small engines. Other areas of use in which an exhaust gas flow must be subjected to catalytic treatment can however also be satisfied with a honeycomb body of this kind. In order to achieve particular stability for the honeycomb body, the formation of the lateral edge region with a fixing zone is achieved by shaping the layer. The honeycomb body can then be produced in a continuous working procedure without there having to be an interruption therein. To increase the level of stability and in particular the rigidity in respect of shape of the honeycomb body the production procedure provides that, besides the first fixing zone in the first lateral edge region a second fixing zone is disposed in a second lateral edge region of the honeycomb body, which are preferably disposed in approximately mutually opposite relationship after production.<br>
Further advantageous configurations and features according to the invention are set forth in the following description of the drawing. Desirable combinations of the features disclosed therein with the features already described above afford further advantageous embodiments of the<br>
invention. In the accompaning drawing: <br>

Figure 16 shows a honeycomb body with an external tooth arrangement.<br>
Figure 1 shows a honeycomb body 1 with a top side 2, an underside 3, a first lateral edge region 4 and a second lateral edge region 5. The honeycomb body 1, in a view from the front with its first end 6. has a flattened or oblate cross-sectional region and has wound sheet metal layers 7. The layers 7 are made up from a structured sheet 8 and an unstructured sheet 9. All layers 7 have common fixing zones 10, 11 which are arranged in the lateral edge regions 4, 5. The first fixing zone 10 is disposed approximately centrally of the honeycomb body 1. The second fixing zone 11 is disposed opposite the first fixing zone 10. At each of the first fixing zone 10 and the second fixing zone 11 all sheets 8, 9 of the sheet layers 7 bear jointly against each other. A thick sheet 12 is disposed between the first fixing zone 10 and the second fixing zone 11. The sheet 12 extends between the two fixing zones 10, 11 and serves as a basis for the honeycomb body in production thereof. For example a first structured sheet 8.1 with a first unstructured sheet 9.1 can be fitted onto that thick sheet 12 at the first fixing zone 10 and then progressively arranged on the thick sheet 12. At the end of the thick sheet 12 which is opposite to the first fixing zone 10 the first structured sheet 8.1 and the first unstructured sheet 9.1 are passed therearound so that they form the second structured sheet 8.2 and the second<br><br>
9<br>
unstructured sheet 9.2. So that the second fixing zone 11 is formed the structured sheets 8 and the unstructured sheets 9 are passed so closely around the thick sheet 12 that all sheets 8, 9 of the layers 7 bear against each other in fractional contact. By means of a first ram 13 the sheet layers are now pressed together in the region of the second fixing zone 11. That pressing operation is repeated at the opposite end. using the second ram 14. In that way it is possible to change the shape of the structuring, but also to provide an assistance effect in terms of wrapping the sheets around the thick sheet 12 which acts as a reinforcement means. In a somewhat modified production procedure the honeycomb body 1 which is slowly brought into existence is turned around its longitudinal axis in such a way that a single ram 13 is sufficient to apply pressure to the sheet layers 7 in the respective fixing zones 10 and 11.<br>
Figure 2 shows another honeycomb body 1, in a view in which its axial extent and its first end 6 can be clearly seen and its second end 15 is indicated. The honeycomb body 1 again has wound sheet layers 7 which are made up from structured sheet 8 and unstructured sheet 9. Arranged in the centre of the honeycomb body 1 is a reinforcement 12 around which the layers 7 are wound. The corrugation configuration of the structured sheets 8 changes over the cross-section so that particularly in the interior of the honeycomb body 1 there is an extremely flattened cross-sectional region, the flattening of which decreases somewhat in an outward direction. The honeycomb body 1 further has four common fixing zones of which two can be seen from the view in Figure 2. The one fixing zone 16 forms a point or spot region while the other fixing zone 17 extends along a line. The position of the two fixing zones 16 and 17 is naturally dependent on the construction of the honeycomb body 1. If it changes over the axial extent thereof the fixing zones 16 and 17 are correspondingly displaced in the lateral edge regions. The first ram 13 illustrated can be used in at least two ways. If on the one hand the honeycomb body while it is being formed is turned in the course of the production procedure the first ram 13 presses the respective sheet layer 7 against the lateral edge region in such a way that the common fixing zones 16 and 17 are produced. On the other hand the first ram 13 is also capable of deforming the entire honeycomb body 1 or parts thereof in such a way that it has a flattened or oblate cross-sectional region.<br>
Figure 3 shows various possible arrangements of the honeycomb bodies in an exhaust gas system 18 of an internal combustion engine 19. For example three honeycomb bodies 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 are arranged in the bend region 20. A further honeycomb body 1.4 is disposed downstream thereof in the region where the flows are brought together. The silencer or muffler 21 is indicated by the conical enlargement and subsequent reduction. A honeycomb body 1.5 is<br><br>
10<br>
also disposed therein. The shape of the illustrated honeycomb bodies 1.1 to 1.5 always has a flattened cross-sectional region. The first honeycomb body 1.1 arranged in the bend region 20 for example also enlarges in a conical configuration. That also applies in regard to the second honeycomb body 1.2 while the third honeycomb body 1.3 in the bend region 20 is admittedly of about the same width, but in return it has a curvature.<br>
Figure 4 clearly shows the way in which a honeycomb body can also be produced. A layer 7 with a first structured sheet 8.3, a second structured sheet 8.4 and an unstructured sheet 9.3 are provided with a catalytic coating 22. The sheets 8.3, 9.3 and 8.4, 9.3 respectively are connected together at their regions which are respectively in contact with each other. That is effected by means of soldering, spot welding or similar connecting procedures. At a bending mandrel or bar 23 the sheet layer 7 is now wound therearound at the respective ends thereof as indicated by the arrows and thus in this case is folded together more or less in half.<br>
Figure 5 shows the way in which a sheet layer 7 which has been wound together in that way can be subjected to further processing. A first ram 13 moves towards the first lateral edge region 4 and in so doing bends the structured sheet 8.3 over in such a way that a common first fixing zone 10 is formed. In order to be able to offer a counterpart support for the first ram 13 the bending mandrel or bar 23 remains in the sheet layer 7, in the movement of the first ram 13. Suitable selection of the shape of the bending mandrel or bar 23 makes it possible to subsequently impart a configuration to the lateral edge region 4. It can also be seen from Figure 5 that, depending on the desired properties of the honeycomb body, the first structured sheet 8.3 is of a different material thickness or gauge from the unstructured sheet 9.3, and vice versa. The elasticity characteristic of the honeycomb body can be adjusted in that way. The structuring, in this case the corrugation configuration, of the second structured sheet 8.4 which is now disposed at an inward position can also be such that a space or spacing is provided for the honeycomb body to behave elastically.<br>
Figure 6 shows an arrangement of a honeycomb body 1 surrounded by a silencer or muffler housing 24 shown in broken line. The honeycomb body 1 is again made up of sheet layers 7. Integrated in the honeycomb body 1 is a wall 25 of the silencer 21 which subdivides the space in the silencer into an upper space 26 and a lower space 27. An exhaust gas flow 28 is introduced into the upper space 26 by way of a first connection 29 and guided by the arrangement of the wall 25 through a first part of the honeycomb body 1 to openings 30 into the lower space 27. There the exhaust gas flow 28 flows through the other part of the honeycomb body 1. The gas flow 28 then leaves the silencer through a second connection 31. The honeycomb body 1 with its flattened<br><br>
11<br>
cross-section is particularly adapted to the shape of the silencer housing 24. It has in particular means by which the wall 25 is so held that the honeycomb body 1 which is integrated therewith is stably fixed.<br>
Figure 7 shows a first honeycomb body 32 and a second honeycomb body 33 in a silencer or muffler 21. An exhaust gas flow 28 is again passed through the silencer 21, as indicated by the arrows. The silencer 21 has a top shell portion 34 and a bottom shell portion 35. between which the two honeycomb bodies 32 and 33 are arranged. A partition wall 36 is disposed between the first honeycomb body 32 and the second honeycomb body 33. The partition wall 36 subdivides the silencer 21 into the upper space 26 and the lower space 27. The partition wall 36 also has teeth 37 or recesses 38 which co-operate with a layer 7 of the respective first honeycomb body 32 and the second honeycomb body 33. In that way the two honeycomb bodies 32 and 33 are fixed with respect to the partition wall 36. The top shell portion 34 also has a first groove 39 and a second groove 40. They also serve for positioning of the first honeycomb body 32. The top shell portion 34 also has teeth 37 which engage into a layer 7 of the first honeycomb body 32. The top shell portion 34, the bottom shell portion 35 and the partition wall 36 are connected together by securing means 41. Those securing means 41 are releasable so that the honeycomb bodies 32 and 33 can be replaced. The top shell portion 34 and the bottom shell portion 35 are also of such a design configuration that, when the silencer 21 is assembled, for example by tightening the securing means 41, the top and bottom shell portions 34 and 35 can apply a pressure to the first and second honeycomb bodies 32 and 33 respectively such that the teeth 37 or raised portions 42 engage into them, clamp them and/or also squeeze at least portions of layers 7. Also indicated in broken lines are displaced connections 29.1 and 31.1 which have advantages in terms of flow dynamics over the first connection 29 and the second connection 31.<br>
Figure 8 shows how a reinforcement 12 or also a wall 25 can be connected to a sheet 43 of a subsequent layer 7. A ram 44 with ram patterns 45 moves towards the reinforcement 12 and presses the sheet 43 into suitable recesses 46. The recesses 46 prevent telescoping of the subsequently formed sheet layers 7 and in that way form a common fixing zone for the subsequent honeycomb body. At least in that region the sheets 43 which are subsequently disposed in mutually superposed relationship can be connected together by soldering or the like.<br>
Figure 9 shows a production process for a further honeycomb body 1. This honeycomb body 1 is produced by structured sheets 8 and unstructured sheets 9 being stacked one within the other. The ends 47 of the structured and unstructured sheets 8 and 9. which project beyond the actual honeycomb body core which is subsequently formed, are bent over as indicated by the arrows<br><br>
12<br>
so as to form a first lateral edge region 4 and a second lateral edge region 5. The common fixing zones can then be produced therein by suitable fixing procedures. In a development of this production process the projecting ends 47 are of such a length that they can be shaped around the sheet layers 7 formed from the structured sheets 8 and unstructured sheets 9, to constitute a casing of the honeycomb body 1. For that purpose the operation of bending the ends 47 is advantageously effected not only for one sheet but for all sheets, irrespective of whether the sheets are structured sheets 8 or unstructured sheets 9, jointly in one working step. An advantageous procedure for that purpose is that the structured sheets 8 and the unstructured sheets 9, without the ends 47 being bent over, are firstly stacked, and only then is that entire stack turned in such a way that the ends 47 of all sheet layers<br>
7	are wound round. That can be effected by rotating the honeycomb body 1<br>
itself or also by means of shaping devices which engage the ends 47 from the<br>
exterior.<br>
Figure 10 shows another production process for a honeycomb body 1. This is formed by winding an individual sheet 48 about itself. The individual sheet 48 has structured regions 49 and unstructured regions 50. Arranging unstructured regions 50 in mutually superposed relationship, at the lateral edge regions 4 and 5 which are formed in that way, affords possible ways of producing fixing zones at those locations.<br>
Figure 11 also shows a production process for a honeycomb body 1. Similarly to the process described with reference to Figure 1. a first ram 13 and a second ram 14 are displaced in such a way as to be able to press against the sheet layer. Unlike the situation with the honeycomb body in Figure 1 however the honeycomb body which is produced here does not have a thick sheet 12 for stabilisation purposes. On the contrary, a structured sheet 8 and an unstructured sheet 9 are introduced into a rotary body 51, as in the case of a sardine can opener, into a slot 52 in the rotary body 51. The two sheets<br>
8	and 9 are wound on in the form of a layer when the rotary body 51 is<br>
rotated. The form of the honeycomb body 1 produced in that way is dependent<br>
on the geometry of the rotary body 51. The cavity which is formed in the'<br>
interior of the honeycomb body 1 produced in that way can be more likely large<br>
or also kept small, depending on the respective requirements involved. An<br>
additional honeycomb body can further be introduced into that cavity. In a<br>
further development of the process the rotary body 51 is left in the honeycomb<br>
body 1 and by virtue of its thickness serves as a stabilisation means and a<br>
receiving means for the honeycomb body which can be additionally introduced.<br>
Figure 12 shows a further honeycomb body 1. This honeycomb body 1 again has a top side 2. an underside 3. a first lateral edge region 4 and a second lateral edge region 5. The first lateral edge region 4 has a first fixing<br><br>
13<br>
zone 10 with which all sheet layers 7 of the honeycomb body 1 are connected together. In this case also the honeycomb body is of a flattened or oblate cross-section, even if the length relationships as between the first lateral edge region 4 and the second lateral edge region are different. The same moreover also applies in regard to the top side 2 and the underside 3. The differences in length between the edge regions 4. 5 and the top side 2 or the underside 3 respectively may also be such that the lateral edge regions 4, 5 are longer. The sides themselves may in that connection be straight, concave, convex or of some other shape. Honeycomb bodies according to the invention may also have more than those four sides, for example they may be of a hexagonal or other polygonal structure.<br>
Figure 13 shows the arrangement of a first honeycomb body 1.1. a second honeycomb body 1.2 and a third honeycomb body 1.3 which are designed in accordance with the invention, in a silencer or muffler housing 24. The silencer housing 24 has a top shell portion 34 and a bottom shell portion 35. The top shell portion 34 is closed and held to the bottom shell portion 35 by way of an interengaging closure mechanism 53. End regions 54 of the walls of the top shell portion 34 and the bottom shell portion 35 each form a respective kind of hook 55. Those hooks 55 are of such a configuration that, when the top shell portion 34 is pressed onto the bottom shell portion 35. the end regions 54 of the top shell portion 34 are urged inwardly and the end regions 54 of the bottom shell portion 35 are urged outwardly. In that way the hooks 55 which are thus disposed in mutually opposite relationship can hook into each other. The internal configuration of the silencer housing 24 can be used in different ways for the honeycomb body or bodies 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 which are to be arranged therein. While the first honeycomb body 1.1 which is shown in section is disposed alone in the silencer housing 24. the arrangement of the second honeycomb body 1.2 and the third honeycomb body 1.3 shows how the three-dimensional geometry of the top shell portion 34 and the bottom shell portion 35 with their hook configurations can be used for holding a respective honeycomb body in the upper space 26 and the lower space 27 respectively. In the case of the first honeycomb body 1.1 in contrast a part of the closure mechanism 53 engages into the honeycomb body 1.1 itself and thus fixes it in the silencer housing 24.<br>
Figure 14 shows a further silencer or muffler housing 34 with a top shell portion 34 and a bottom shell portion 35. The silencer housing 24 as such is again of such a design configuration that it fixes the honeycomb body or bodies to be arranged in its interior, by virtue of its shape. The honeycomb body may therefore be not only more or less quadrangular but equally also concave or convex. In addition the silencer housing can also be of such a design configuration that a honeycomb body 1 can also be arranged therein, in<br><br>
14<br>
a comparable manner to the arrangement shown in Figure 12. In arriving at the design configuration, in that respect consideration will be given to where the common fixing zone or zones are disposed as. in conjunction with the silencer housing 24, those zones are also capable of imparting stability to the silencer housing 24.<br>
Figure 15 shows a housing 56 which can be used as a silencer or muffler housing 24. The silencer housing 24 has a base body 57 and it has inwardly extending corrugation-like portions 58 which are of such a configuration that they engage into corresponding recesses 59.in the honeycomb body 1 arranged in the interior of the silencer housing 24. and thus fix the honeycomb body 1. The base body 57 comprises a first part 57.1 and a second part 57.2 which each have a bent-over end 60. The bent-over end 60 also engages into the honeycomb body 1. A first cover 62 and a second cover 63 are disposed on the base body 57 for laterally covering it over and for preventing the gas flow 61 flowing through the honeycomb body 1 from flowing out of same. Disposed in the first cover 62 are inwardly extending curvature portions or recesses<br>
64	which engage into corresponding recesses 59 in the honeycomb body 1. The<br>
honeycomb body 1 is laterally fixed by virtue of that arrangement. This way<br>
of closing the silencer housing 24 by means of covers which are to be fitted<br>
laterally permits the honeycomb body to be replaced by being pushed in and out<br>
of the base housing 57.<br>
Figure 16 shows a further honeycomb body 1 which has a tooth configuration<br>
65	at its first lateral edge region 4. The tooth configuration 65 is<br>
advantageously disposed in that lateral edge region which also includes a<br>
fixing zone. In that way, when the honeycomb body 1 is pushed in, for example<br>
into a silencer housing, it is prevented from sliding out again. That can be<br>
adjusted by virtue of the orientation of the tooth configuration 65. In<br>
conjunction with other means which prevent the honeycomb body from slipping<br>
in the silencer housing, the honeycomb body remains durably fixed in position.<br>
The tooth configuration 65 however may not only be disposed on the outside of<br>
the honeycomb body. Sheets of the honeycomb body itself may also have the<br>
tooth configuration in order thus for example to provide that the sheet layers<br>
are in mutually hooking relationship.<br><br>
