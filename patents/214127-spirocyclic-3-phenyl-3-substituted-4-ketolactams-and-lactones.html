COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"SPIROCYCLIC      3-PHENYL-3-SUBSTITUTED-4-KETOLACTAMS      AND-LACTONES"<br>
BAYER   AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT,   a   German   company,      of   D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
Le A 35 451-Foreien Countries Gam/li/NT<br>
-1-<br><br>
The invention relates to novel phenyl-substituted 4-ketolactams and -lactones, to<br>
5	processes and intermediates for their preparation and to their use as pesticides,<br>
microbicides and herbicides.<br>
It is already known that certain 3-phenyl-3-substituted-4-ketolactams and -lactones act as insecticides, acaricides and/or herbicides (JP-A-10-258 555). 10<br>
However, the herbicidal, acaricidal and insecticidal efficacy and/or activity spectrum, and the compatibility of these compounds with plants, and in particular with crop plants, are not always satisfactory.<br>
15	This invention now provides novel compounds of the formula (I)<br><br>
O	W<br>
in which<br>
20	W       represents cyano, halogen, alkyl,  alkenyl,  alkynyl,  alkoxy, haloalkyl  or<br>
haloalkoxy,<br>
X        represents hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy or cyano,<br>
25	Y        represents hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy or cyano,<br>
Z	represents hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy or cyano,<br><br>
Le A 35 451-Foreien Countries<br>
-2-<br>
-A-B- represents the groups<br><br>
5<br>
G        represents halogen or nitro,<br>
represents Cj-Cg-alkyl,<br>
10	R3       represents hydrogen or Cj-C^alkyl,<br>
and<br>
Q        together with NH represents the cycle (1), together with oxygen represents the<br>
15	cycle (2) and together with sulphur represents the cycle (3),<br>
moreover, the invention provides novel compounds of the formula (I) in which<br>
-A-B- represents the group 20<br>
c) <br>
and<br>
W	represents halogen or alkyl,<br>
25	X	represents hydrogen, halogen or alkyl,<br>
Y	represents hydrogen, halogen or alkyl,<br>
Z	represents hydrogen, halogen or alkyl,<br><br>
Le A 35 451-Foreign Countries<br>
-3-<br>
where at least one of the radicals W, X and Y represents alkyl and at least one of the radicals W, X and Y represents halogen,<br>
G        represents halogen or nitro, 5<br>
R2 and R3 independently of one another represent hydrogen or CpC^alkyl and<br>
Q together with NH represents the cycle (1), together with oxygen represents the cycle (2) and together with sulphur represents the cycle (3).<br>
10<br>
Depending inter alia on the nature of the substituents, the compounds of the formula (I) can be present as geometrical and/or optical isomers or isomer mixtures in varying composition which, if appropriate, can be separated in a customary manner. The present invention provides both the pure isomers and the isomer mixtures, their<br>
15	preparation and use and the compositions comprising them. However, for the sake of<br>
simplicity, only compounds of the formula (I) are referred to hereinbelow, although this is meant to refer both to the pure compounds and, if appropriate, to mixtures having different proportions of isomeric compounds.<br>
20	The compounds of the formula (I) can be present both as mixtures and in the form of<br>
their pure isomers. Mixtures of the compounds of the formula (I) can, if required, be separated in a manner known per se by physical methods, for example by chromatographic methods.<br><br>

Le A 35 451-Foreign Countries<br>
-40-<br>
When used as insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention can<br>
furthermore be present in their commercially available formulations and in the use<br>
forms, prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with synergistic agents.<br>
Synergistic agents are compounds which increase the action of the active compounds,<br>
5	without it being necessary for the synergistic agent added to be active itself.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially<br>
available   formulations   can   vary   within   wide   limits.   The   active   compound<br>
concentration of the use forms can be from 0.0000001 to 95% by weight of active<br>
10	compound, preferably between 0.0001 and 1% by weight.<br>
The compounds are employed in a customary manner appropriate for the use forms.<br>
When used against hygiene pests and pests of stored products, the active compound<br>
15	is distinguished by an excellent residual action on wood and clay as well as by a good<br>
stability to alkali on limed substrates.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or<br>
20	those obtained by conventional biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast<br>
fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been<br>
25	explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably,  plants of the  plant cultivars  which  are in each  case<br>
commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. Plant<br>
cultivars are understood as meaning plants with novel properties ("traits") which are<br>
30	grown by conventional  cultivation,  by mutagenesis  or by recombinant DNA<br>
techniques. These may be cultivars, biotypes or genotypes.<br><br>
Le A 35 451-Foreign Countries<br>
-41-<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth<br>
conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the<br>
invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example,<br>
5	reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an<br>
increase in the activity of the substances and compositions to be used according to<br>
the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures,<br>
increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering<br>
performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better<br>
10	quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage<br>
stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering)<br>
15	which are preferably to be treated according to the invention include all plants which,<br>
in the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance,<br>
20	easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or<br>
a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or<br>
25	viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active<br>
compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton<br>
30	and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the<br>
plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the<br><br>
Le A 35 451-Foreign Countries<br>
-42-<br>
plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes<br>
CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CrylUA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb<br>
and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants").<br>
Traits which are also particularly emphasized are the increased resistance of plants to<br>
5	fungi, bacteria and viruses  by systemic  acquired resistance  (SAR),  systemin,<br>
phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and the correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example<br>
10	the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be<br>
present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example  maize,  cotton,   soya  beans),  KnockOut®  (for example  maize),<br>
15	StarLink®   (for  example   maize),   Bollgard®   (cotton),   Nucotn®   (cotton)   and<br>
NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape),<br>
20	IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for<br>
example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, which<br>
25	cultivars will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly<br>
advantageous manner with the compounds of the formula I or the active compound<br>
mixtures according to the invention. The preferred ranges stated above for the active<br>
30	compounds or mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular<br><br>

The active compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention are also suitable for controlling arthropods which infest agricultural productive livestock, such as, for example,  cattle,  sheep,  goats,  horses,  pigs,  donkeys,  camels,  buffalo,  rabbits,<br>
20	chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese and bees, other pets, such as, for example, dogs, cats,<br>
caged birds and aquarium fish, and also so-called test animals, such as, for example, hamsters, guinea pigs, rats and mice. By controlling these arthropods, cases of death and reduction in productivity (for meat, milk, wool, hides, eggs, honey etc.) should be diminished, so that more economic and easier animal husbandry is possible by use<br>
25	of the active compounds according to the invention.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are used in the veterinary sector in<br>
a known manner by enteral administration in the form of, for example, tablets,<br>

by weight.<br><br>
Le A 35 451-Foreign Countries<br>
-47-<br>
The amount of the compositions or concentrates employed depends on the nature and<br>
occurrence of the insects and on the medium. The optimum amount employed can be<br>
determined for the use in each case by a series of tests. In general, however, it is<br>
5	sufficient to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of<br>
the active compound, based on the material to be preserved.<br>
Solvents and/or diluents which are used are an organic chemical solvent or solvent<br>
mixture and/or an oily or oil-like organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture of low<br>
10	volatility and/or a polar organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water,<br>
and if appropriate an emulsifier and/or wetting agent.<br>
Organic chemical solvents which are preferably used are oily or oil-like solvents<br>
having an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30°C, preferably<br>
15	above 45°C. Substances which are used as such oily or oil-like water-insoluble<br>
solvents of low volatility are appropriate mineral oils or aromatic fractions thereof, or solvent mixtures containing mineral oils, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkylbenzene.<br>
20	Mineral oils having a boiling range from 170 to 220°C, white spirit having a boiling<br>
range from 170 to 220°C, spindle oil having a boiling range from 250 to 350°C, petroleum and aromatics having a boiling range from 160 to 280°C, terpentine oil and the like, are advantageously employed.<br>

replaced in part by organic chemical solvents of high or medium volatility, providing that the solvent mixture likewise has an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, and that the insecticide/fungicide mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture. 5<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, some of the organic chemical solvent or<br>
solvent mixture or an aliphatic polar organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture is<br>
replaced. Aliphatic organic chemical solvents containing hydroxyl and/or ester and/or<br>
ether groups, such as, for example, glycol ethers, esters or the like, are preferably<br>
10	used.<br>
Organic chemical binders which are used in the context of the present invention are the synthetic resins and/or binding drying oils which are known per se, are water-dilutable and/or are soluble or dispersible or emulsifiable in the organic chemical<br>
15	solvents employed, in particular binders consisting of or comprising an acrylate resin,<br>
a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin, polycondensation or polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, phenolic resin, hydrocarbon resin, such as indene-cumarone resin, silicone resin, drying vegetable oils and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural<br>
20	and/or synthetic resin.<br>
The synthetic resin used as the binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion,<br>
dispersion or solution. Bitumen or bituminous substances can also be used as binders<br>
in an amount of up to 10% by weight. Dyestuffs, pigments, water-repelling agents,<br>
25	odour correctants and inhibitors or anticorrosive agents and the like which are known<br>
per se can additionally be employed.<br>
It is preferred according to the invention for the composition or concentrate to<br>
comprise, as the organic chemical binder, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd<br>
30	resin and/or one drying vegetable oil. Alkyd resins having an oil content of more than<br><br>

45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight, are preferably used according to the invention.<br>
All or some of the binder mentioned can be replaced by a fixing agent (mixture) or a<br>
5	plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent evaporation of the<br>
active compounds and crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of the binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers originate from the chemical classes of phthalic acid esters, such as<br>

phosphate, adipic acid esters, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, stearates, such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates, such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or higher molecular weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic acid esters.<br>
15	Fixing agents are based chemically on polyvinyl alkyl ethers, such as, for example,<br>
polyvinyl methyl ether or ketones, such as benzophenone or ethylenebenzophenone.<br>
Possible solvents or diluents are, in particular, also water, if appropriate as a mixture<br>
with one or more of the abovementioned organic chemical solvents or diluents,<br>
20	emulsifiers and dispersing agents.<br>
Particularly effective preservation of wood is achieved by impregnation processes on a large industrial scale, for example vacuum, double vacuum or pressure processes.<br>
25	The ready-to-use compositions can also comprise other insecticides, if appropriate,<br>
and also one or more fungicides, if appropriate.<br>
Possible additional mixing partners are, preferably, the insecticides and fungicides<br>
mentioned in WO 94/29 268. The compounds mentioned in this document are an<br>

The active compounds according to the invention also have very good fortifying action in plants. Accordingly, they can be used for mobilizing the defences of the plant against attack by undesirable microorganisms.<br>
15	In the present context, plant-fortifying (resistance-inducing) substances are to be<br>
understood as meaning those substances which are capable of stimulating the defence system of plants such that, when the treated plants are subsequently inoculated with undesirable microorganisms, they show substantial resistance against these mircroorganisms.<br>
20<br>
In the present case, undesirable microorganisms are to be understood as meaning phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses. Accordingly, the substances according to the invention can be used to protect plants for a certain period after the treatment against attack by the pathogens mentioned. The period for which protection is<br>
25	provided generally extends over 1 to 10 days, preferably 1 to 7 days, after the<br>
treatment of the plants with the active compounds.<br>
The fact that the active compounds are well tolerated by plants at the concentrations<br>
required for controlling plant diseases permits the treatment of above-ground parts of<br>
30	plants, of propagation stock and seeds, and of the soil.<br><br>

A mixture with other known active compounds, such as herbicides, or with fertilizers and growth regulators, is also possible.<br>
25	In addition, the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention also have<br>
very good antimycotic activity. They have a very broad antimycotic activity spectrum in particular against dermatophytes and yeasts, moulds and diphasic fungi (for example against Candida species, such as Candida albicans, Candida glabrata), and Epidermophyton floccosum, Aspergillus species, such as Aspergillus niger and<br>
30	Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichophyton species, such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes,<br><br>
Microsporon species such as Microsporon canis and audouinii. The list of these fungi by no means limits the mycotic spectrum covered, but is only for illustration.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or the use<br>
5	forms prepared therefrom, such as ready-to-use solutions, suspensions, wettable<br>
powders, pastes, soluble powders, dusts and granules. Application is carried out in a<br>
customary manner, for example by watering, spraying, atomizing, broadcasting,<br>
dusting, foaming, spreading, etc. It is furthermore possible to apply the active<br>
compounds by the ultra-low-volume method, or to inject the active compound<br>
10	preparation or the active compound itself into the soil. It is also possible to treat the<br>
seeds of the plants.<br>
When using the active compounds according to the invention as fungicides, the application rates can be varied within a relatively wide range, depending on the kind<br>
15	of application. For the treatment of parts of plants, the active compound application<br>
rates are generally between 0.1 and 10,000 g/ha, preferably between 10 and 1000 g/ha. For seed dressing, the active compound application rates are generally between 0.001 and 50 g per kilogram of seed, preferably between 0.01 and 10 g per kilogram of seed. For the treatment of the soil, the active compound application rates<br>
20	are generally between 0.1 and 10,000 g/ha, preferably between 1 and 5000 g/ha.<br><br>

Example L<br>
Critical concentration test/soil insects - treatment of transgenic plants<br>
5	Test insect:	Diabrotica balteata - larvae in soil<br>
Solvent:	7 parts by weight of acetone<br>
Emulsifier:	1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
10	To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active<br>
compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent, the stated amount of emulsifier is added and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
15	The preparation of active compound is poured onto the soil. The concentration of the<br>
active compound in the preparation is virtually immaterial, only the amount by weight of active compound per volume unit of soil, which is stated in ppm (mg/1), matters. The soil is filled into 0.25 1 pots, and these are allowed to stand at 20°C.<br>
20	Immediately after the preparation, 5 pre-germinated maize corns of the soltivar<br>
YIELD GUARD (trademark of Monsanto Comp., USA) are placed into each pot. After 2 days, the corresponding test insects are placed into the treated soil. After a further 7 days, the efficacy of the active compound is determined by counting the number of maize plants that emerged (1 plant = 20% activity).<br><br>
