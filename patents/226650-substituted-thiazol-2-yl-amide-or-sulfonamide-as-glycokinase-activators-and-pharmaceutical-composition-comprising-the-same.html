In starting compounds and intermediates which are converted to the compounds of the invention in a manner described herein, functional groups present, such as amino, thiol, carboxyl and hydroxy groups, are optionally protected by conventional protecting groups that are common in preparative organic chemistry. Protected amino, thiol, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups are those that can be converted under mild conditions into free amino thiol, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups without the molecular framework being destroyed or other undesired side reactions taking place.<br>
The purpose of introducing protecting groups is to protect the functional groups from undesired reactions with reaction components under the conditions used for carrying out a desired chemical transformation. The need and choice of protecting groups for a particular reaction is known to those skilled in the art and.depends on the nature of the functional group to be protected (hydroxyl group, amino group, etc.), the structure and stability of the molecule of which the substituent is a part and the reaction conditions.<br>
Well-known protecting groups that meet these conditions and their introduction and removal are described, e.g., in McOmie, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Plenum Press, London, NY (1973); and Greene and Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", John Wiley and Sons, Inc., NY (1999).<br>
The above-mentioned reactions are carried out according to standard methods, in the presence or absence of diluent, preferably, such as are inert to the reagents and are solvents thereof, of catalysts, condensing or said other agents, respectively and/or inert atmospheres, at low temperatures, room temperature (RT) or elevated temperatures, preferably at or near the boiling point of the solvents used, and at atmospheric or super-atmospheric pressure.

The aforesaid possible isomers or mixtures thereof are within the purview of this invention.<br>
Any resulting mixtures of isomers can be separated on the basis of the physicochemical differences of the constituents, into the pure geometric or optical isomers, diastereomers, racemates, for example, by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization.<br>
Any resulting racemates of final products or intermediates can be resolved into the optical antipodes by known methods, e.g., by separation of the diastereomeric salts thereof, obtained with an optically active acid or base, and liberating the optically active acidic or basic compound. In particular, the thiazolyl moiety may be employed to resolve the compounds of the present invention into their optical antipodes, e.g., by fractional crystallization of a salt formed with an optically active acid, e.g., tartaric acid, dibenzoyl tartaric acid, diacetyl tartaric acid, di-O,O'-p-toluoyl tartaric acid, mandelic acid, malic acid or carnphor-10-sulfonic acid.

The activity of compounds according to the invention may be assessed by the following methods or methods well-described in the art:<br>
The glucokinase activation in vitro may be determined by measuring the activation of recombinant GST-GK by a compound of the present invention in the absence or the presence of GKRP, a 68,000 Da protein inhibitor of GK. In these assays, formation of glucose-6-phosphate is coupled directly to the formation of thioNADH. GST-GK catalyzes the reaction of glucose and Mg-ATP to produce glucose-6-phosphate and ADP. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) reduces thionicotinamide (thioNAD) to thioNADH. The assay measures the formation of NADH at 405 nM.<br>
The basic GK assay components are as follows: 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.1), 25 mM KCI, 2.5 mM MgCI2, 1 mM ATP (Sigma A-5394), 1 mM DTT, 1 mM thioNAD (Sigma T-7375), 80 units/mL G6PDH (Sigma G-5885), 10 mM glucose and 8.7 mg/mL GST-GK (110 nM). For assessing reversal of GK inhibition by GKRP, 20 //M Fructose-1-phosphate (F-6-P) and 25 //g/rnL of recombinant GKRP (370 nM) are added to these assay components. F-1-P at 1 //M is used as a control in the GK/GKRP assay. F-1-P reverses inhibition of GST-GK by GKRP.<br>
The assay is done in standard, 96-well, round-bottom plates and the total assay volume is 25 JJL Compounds are serially diluted into 100% DMSO and 0.5//L of diluted compound in 100% DMSO is added to the assay plate. Assay reagents (24.5 //L) are added using a Zyrnark robotic platform. Buffer, containing HEPES, MgCI2, KCI, thioNAD, G6PDH, F-6-P, glucose, GKRP and GST-GK, are added (5//L) using the Zymark 8-channel hand pipet. The reaction is then initiated by adding 19.5//L of buffer containing HEPES, MgCI2l KCI, DTT and ATP using the Zymark Reagent Addition Station/Reagent Addition Module. The plates are then delivered via the Zymark XP arm to a Thermomax plate reader and read kinetically over three min at 405 nM at RT. Units are expressed as milli-optical density per minute (rnOD/min).<br>
The glucokinase activation in rat hepatocytes may be determined as follows:<br>
Hepatocytes are isolated by collagenase perfusion of the livers of overnight-fasted male Harlen Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Raleigh, NC) as previously described (see Berry et alM J. Cell Biol., Vol. 43, pp. 506-520 (1969)). The cells are washed three times each with 100 mL of glucose-free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Gibco BRL) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and then suspended in glucose-free<br><br>
DMEM/5% FBS. Cells are plated in collagen coated 24-well plates (Becton Dickinson) at a density of 3 x 105 cells/well in 1 mL of William's Medium E (Sigma) supplemented with 5% FBS, and incubated at 37°C in 5% CC&gt;2/95% air. After cell attachment (-4 h), the medium is replaced with serum-free DMEM containing 5 mM glucose and 10 nM dexamethasone (Sigma), and cells are cultured further for 16-20 h prior to use.<br>
The rate of glucose phosphorylation is determined by the release of 3H2O from [2-3H]glucose. The medium from the cultured hepatocytes is removed, and the cells are pre-incubated in 150//L of fresh serum-free DMEM containing 5 mM glucose and compound (1, 10 and 30 pM) or DMSO for 3 h at 37°C. The final concentration of DMSO is 0.2%. The medium is then removed and 150 /JL of a fresh mixture of DMEM/5 mM glucose containing compound or DMSO, and 1 /yCi of [2-3H]glucose (NEN) is added. As a positive control for stimulation of glucose phosphorylation, cells are pre-incubated in serum-free DMEM/5 mM glucose medium containing DMSO for 3 h and then are incubated for 1 h in labeled glucose medium containing 0.5 mM fructose/DMSO (precursor of F-1-P, AnalaR® from BDH). All conditions are tested in quadruplicate where one well per plate received 200//L of the appropriate medium plus labeled glucose (instead of 150//L) of which 50 JJL is immediately removed and placed in a 1.2 mL microfuge tube (Costar) containing 10//L of 1 N HCI. This sample is used as a 0-minute time point for determining background 3H2O release (exchange values). Following the addition of the labeled glucose media, hepatocytes are incubated at 37°C on a slow moving rocker for 1 h.<br>
On termination of the incubation, 50 pL of the culture medium is collected into microfuge tubes containing 10 //L of 1 N HCI, and determination of 3H2O. The tubes are left uncapped and each is placed inside a 20 mL glass scintillation vial (Wheaton) containing 1.5 mL of deionized water. The vials are capped tightly and incubated at 37°C in a dry incubator for 2 days (3H20 from the reaction mixture will equilibrate with the water in the vial). A standard curve is generated using [3H]H2O (NEN) to correct for exchange. 50 fjL aliquots of serial dilutions of the labeled water are added to 10 //L of 1 N HCI and exchange is performed as described for the samples (typically, approximately 90% exchange is observed). The microfuge tubes are then removed from the vials carefully to minimize the removal of any water from the vial and 18 mL of scintillation cocktail (Ready Safe, Beckman Coulter) is then added to each vial. The H-labekecovered from [2- H]glucose in the water is determined using a Beckman Model LS500 scintillation counter and the counts (minus the 0-time point) are corrected for recovery of 3H2O. The amount of glucose de-tritiated in nanomoles/h per<br><br>
106 cells is calculated, and the results are expressed as percent increase over the DMSO control.<br>
Our compounds exhibit high affinity, selectivity, improved potency as well as good oral bioavailability, pharmacokinetic profile and safety.<br>
Our compounds are particularly useful for treating diabetes or IGT without a serious risk of hypoglycemia, and have the potential to decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases in patients especially in individuals with type 2 diabetes or IGT. Thus, our compounds would be appropriate to use for long-term treatments, particularly for use in diabetes, in diabetes prevention such as in IGT patients. Our compounds exhibit a stronger control of the fasting plasma glucose level, postprandial plasma glucose level, serum triglycerides level, haemoglobin A1c level without a serious risk of hypoglycemia or fat mass increase. Furthermore, they exhibit long duration of action, long-term tolerability, safety and lower glycaemic peaks as well as a better daily control of the plasma insulin level. Our compounds have the advantage to augment hepatic glucose metabolism, glucose usage in the liver and glucose-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic islets with a higher efficacy which should provide greater efficacy as a monotherapy.<br>
