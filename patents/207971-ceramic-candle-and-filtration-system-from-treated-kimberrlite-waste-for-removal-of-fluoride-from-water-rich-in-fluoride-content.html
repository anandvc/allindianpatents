Development of Ceramic Candle and Filtration system from treated Kiinberrlite Waste<br>
for removal of Fluoride from Water rich in Fluoride Content.<br>
1 The invention relates to a development of Ceramic Candle and nidation system Horn Healed<br>
Kimberrlite Waste available at Panna Diamond Mine (3 - 4 Million Tones allcr recovery of<br>
diamonds) for removal of Fluoride from Water rich in lluoiide Content.<br>
Background:<br>
It lias been found that Fluorosis is a chronic menace affecting huge population woildwidc.   As<br>
per the survey conducted by Technology mission, aiound 25-30 million peo|)le in 8700 villages<br>
are suffering from Fluorosis.   Fluorosis results from excess intake of Fluoride mainly through<br>
drinking water.   Although it is known that small amount of lluoiide is required for general<br>
health as an activator for some enzyme system and for the dental caries, excess intake leads to<br>
dental and skeletal Fluorosis.   WHO has set the guidelines of 1.5 mg/L lluoiide as maximum<br>
permissible limit in potable water.<br>
Existing Scenario of fluoride removal methods:<br>
1.	Lime and Alum Method<br>
'    Ref:     Jendrickson 1984, Mgcngcia (1988, Rao 1988 and Nowlakhe- 1978.<br>
Current status:-	La en Field tested, applicable at community level and in Central<br>
treatment Plants.    Successful field tests have been done in rural pails of India and Kenya.  Conflicting views with respect to its efficiency.<br>
2.	Lime:<br>
Ref:-    Choi - 1979, Hendrickson 1984, Mjengera - 1988 Rabosky and Miller - 1974<br>
Current status:-        Lab and field tested, well known process Trained operators are<br>
needed. Poor removal efficiency at low fluoride concentrations.<br>
3.	And co:<br>
Ref:-    O'Brien- 1983.<br>
Current status:-        The process is sophisticated, but the consumption of chemicals<br>
is low but reduction of fluoride concentration below I mg 171 is possible. The facilities<br>
1	for using the Andco process are supplied by Andco Lnviionmenlal process inc.   USA<br>
as package plants. But not proved popular.<br><br>
4.	Polyaluminium Chloride:<br>
Ref&gt;    Mjcngcra- 1988.<br>
Current status:-	Lab   tests   only.      High   removal   capacity   of  (lie   chemical<br>
polyaluminium chloride possibility to develop the method for application at Community level.  But requires regeneration system<br>
5.	Aluminum Sulphate (Alum):<br>
Ref:     Hendrickson, 1984<br>
Current status:-	Lab and field tested, well know process.   Trained operatois aie<br>
needed.<br>
6.	Calcium Chloride:<br>
â– \	Ref: Diver, 1982, Hendrickson - 1984<br>
Current status:- Process is well known and well I lained operators are lecjuiied<br>
7	Gypsum and Fluoritc:-<br>
Ref:-   Graaff, Van. De 1991. Schuiling, 1991, 1990.<br>
Current status:- Lab tests o.nly, well known process. Very simple method, application at house-hold and community level is possible Method can be used as a first step in which the bulk of fluoride is removed, followed by a more expensive adsoption method in which the rest of fluoride is removed.<br>
8.	Magnestie (Mg Coj):<br>
Ref:     Mjengera, 1988.<br>
Current status:- The method has been tested in the Laboratory. The removal efficiency depends on the contract time allowed. Maximum observed removal efficiency is 81% but the PH increase substantially, this making the treatment unfit.<br>
9.	Dolomite: (Semi - Calcined dolomite)<br>
'   Ref:-    Shablovskayaetal. 1988.<br>
Current status:- The method has been tested in the Laboratory. The experiments indicate that the average residual concentration of fluoride is between 1.0 and 1.5 mg/L, which corresponds to the WHO level.<br>
The capacity of the filter medium was 400 g F/ni3 which is about two time less than the capacity of granules of activated aluminum oxide, used for water defluoridation. But the life of material was limited.<br><br>
(ADSORPTION - ION - I
10.	Dcfliioron - I<br>
Ref:      Hendrickson- 1984.<br>
Current status:- The medium is reported to have poor hydiaulic properties and high attritional losses. Trained technical operalois aie needed lor media regeneration. Application in treatment plant only.<br>
1.	Activated   alumina   (Complex,   Granulated   activated   alumina,   lluidi/.ed   activated<br>
alumina)<br>
Ref:      Barbicr- 1984, Belle- 1984, llepp- 1979 Mazounie - 1984, Mjcngera, 1988 Schoeman- 1985 abd 1987.<br>
Current status:- The method has been well documented and studied A number of publications have demonstrated the advantage over other excess fluoride removal methods. The method is quite suitable for municipal plants in developed countries and has been applied in several countries. But not suitable at domestic level because of regeneration problem after short period of time.<br>
12.       Clays as natural adsorbents.<br>
Ref:-    Chaturvedi, 1988, Gitonga, 1985, Jinadasa, 1988, Mjcngera, 1988, Weerasootiya - 1989.<br>
Current status:-	Only Lab tested,  Huoiide Concentration can be lowered to<br>
approximately 1 nig F/L. Simple method which can be developed for application at household and community level.<br>
The objective of the invention is to devise system for removal ofllouride from water<br>
rich in flouride for common villagers who have no access for good potable water. The<br>
devise has been made in such away that a villager also can handle the system without<br>
depending upon trained persons or chemicals to be used for regeneration activities as<br>
illustrated in above activities.<br>
Thus, according to this invention a system has been made to remove llouride from<br>
water rich in flouride content by utilizing the waste material known as Kimbei lite<br>
waste after activation.<br>
The invention will be more clearly described with reference to fig-1 of accompanying<br>
drawing of the filtration system<br><br>
Referring to fig-1, a container (A) with multiple holes at the bollom is tided with course cloth to cover the holes, over the cloth calcined &amp; chemically surface tieated Kimberlite waste is filled (5kgs). This serves two put poses,<br>
i)	Filtering off water with suspended impurities,<br>
ii)	Arresting the ilouride content in the water to the extent of 10-20%<br>
iii)        The second chamber (13) is fitted with thiee caudles made from treated<br>
Kimberlite waste. The fitting is done by known manner. The candle pieparation<br>
is also carried by known manner,<br>
iv)        The treatment is carried by tieating Kimbcilite waste with 0.1 N I Id for 4 hrs<br>
after filtration the Kimberlite waste is washed with water and remove all<br>
chloride ions. The surface aica increases from 54.4 I to 28 1.42 m;/g .<br>
v)	The filtered water is collected in the third chamber. In this chamber, granulated<br>
activated charcoal available in the tnaikcl is placed in order to remove smell of clay and any colour present in the water. In third chamber there is central tube which has got number of holes around less than size of granulated activated charcoal. The water after passing through candles, gets associated with activated charcoal before getting collected in fourth. The above slated system will take care of 20 liters of water to average family consumption. After alternate month calcined Kimberlite has to be replaced and candles made from treated Kimberlite has to be replaced after ever three months The system will take care of I0-ppm (louiide content in the water and reduces to 1.0-1.5-ppm level which is within WHO prescribed limits.<br><br><br><br><br>
