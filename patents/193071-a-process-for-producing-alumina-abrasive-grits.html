FIRIKG   SOL-GEL   RLOMIHA   PARTICLES<br>
Backgroun4  of  the  invention<br>
This invention relates to aluminous abrasive grits and particularly to sol-gel alumina abrasive materials with improved grinding performance.<br>
Sol-gel alumina abrasives are conventionally produced by drying a sol or gel of an alpha alumina precursor, (which is usually but not essentially, boehmite) , at about 125 to 200'C to remove- the water component of the gel; breaking up the dried gel into particles of the desired size for abrasive grits; perhaps claiming the particles, (generally at a temperature of from about 400-800°C) to form an intermediate form of alumina; and then finally firing the claimed pieces at a temperature sufficiently high to convert them from an intermediate form such as gamma alumina to the alpha alumina form. Simple sol-gel processes are described for example in USPP 4,314,827; 4,518,397; 4,881,951 and British  Patent  Application  2,099,012.<br>
In a particularly desirable form of sol-gel process, the alpha alumina   precursor   is    "seeded"   with   a   material   having   the   same<br><br>
crystal  structure  as,   and  lattice  parameters  as  close  as  possible to,    those   of   alpha   alumina   itself.      The   "seed"   is   added   in   as finely    divided    form    as    possible    and    is    dispersed    uniformly throughout  the  sol  or  gel.     It  can  be  added  abs  initial  or  it  can  be formed    in   situ.        The    function   of    the    seed    is    to    cause    the transformation  to  the  alpha  form  to  occur  uniformly  throughout  the precursor at  a  much  lower  temperature  than  is  needed  in  the  absence of   the   seed.      This   process   produces   a   crystalline   structure   in which   the   individual   crystals   of   alpha   alumina,    (that   is   those areas    of    substantially    the    same    crystallographic    orientation separated  from  adjacent  crystals  by  high  angle  grain  boundaries), are   very   uniform   in   size   and   are   essentially   all   sub-micron   in diameter.      Suitable   seeds   include   alpha   alumina   itself   but   also other   compounds   such   as   alpha   ferric   oxide,    chromium   suboxide, nickel   titan ate   and   a   plurality   of   other   compounds   that   have lattice  parameters  sufficiently  similar  to  those  of  alpha  alumina to  be   to   cause  the   generation  of   alpha   alumina   from   a precursor   at   a   temperature   below   that   at   which   the   conversion normally   occurs   in   the   absence   of   such   seed.    Examples   of   such seeded     sol-gel     processes     are     described     in     USPP     4,623,364; 4,744,802;   4,954,462;   4,964,883;    5,192,339;    5,215,551;    5,219,806 and  many  others.<br>
The optional claiming of the dried sol-gel is often preferred so as to minimize the time needed at the elevated firing temperatures. This is because the firing operation performs the tasks of converting the transitional alumina forms to the alpha form and the sintering of the alpha alumina to close up residual porosity and ensure that the particles have adequate density and hardness to function well as abrasive grits. It is known that excessive time at sintering temperatures, which are generally between 1300 and 1400°C for seeded sol-gel materials and about lOCC higher than that for unseeded sol-gel alumina, can lead to crystal growth,    since  crystal  growth  is  generally regarded as  undesirable.<br><br>
it is considered appropriate to carry out the claiming separately and so minimize the time at such elevated temperatures. This procedure is followed in spite of the extra cost of maintaining two high  temperature  operations.<br>
Since the drying operation is followed by a crushing and screening operation the grain is reduced to room temperature and the heat used to dry the grain is given up to the surroundings. This  is  of  course  very  inefficient.<br>
The crushing operation is performed after the drying because,<br>
at this point the material is relatively easily broken up. If it<br>
were left till after the firing operation, the material would be so<br>
hard that excessive amounts of energy would be required. It is<br>
therefore    common-sense    to    crush    at    the    pre-fired    stage.	In<br>
addition it is considered that firing will be more efficient since the particles will more rapidly reach the firing temperature in the furnace  if  they  are  small.<br>
It has now been found possible to significantly reduce the energy consumption involved in the production of alumina by a sol-gel process. This is achieved by a manipulation of the process in a manner that is completely contrary to the intuitive reasoning used in designing conventional processes. The novel process produces alpha alumina particles in a very desirable form that is fully dandified and well adapted to use in abrasive applications. Moreover the system is flexible enough to permit design of the abrasive  grits  obtained.<br>
General  Description  of  the  Invention<br>
The process of the invention comprises feeding a dried but not fired sol-gel alumina having a volatilizable content of at least 5% by weight, directly into a furnace held at d temperature above 400 C and   controlling   the   temperature   and   residence   time   to   produce   an<br><br>
When the lumps of dried gel are placed in the furnace the vaporizable material in the lumps expands explosively causing them to fly apart leaving smaller particles which are highly suitable for use in grinding applications. If the residence time in the furnace is sufficiently long, the smaller particles that remain are rapidly converted to the alpha phase and sinter very quickly to the essentially fully dandified form. The violent nature of this process has led to it being described familiarly as "explosive comminution" though in a preferred embodiment the process goes beyond comminution and includes firing to the alpha phase and, in some cases sintering to essentially theoretical density. Where the temperature is somewhat lower, the amount of comminution may be reduced somewhat and may chiefly result in the break-up of the larger pieces and the creation of weakness lines in the remaining pieces that render them easily broken up in a subsequent comer operation. This however is also regarded as explosive communities.<br>
Therefore "explosively comminuted" material is understood to be formed when dried sol-gel alumina particles are fed into the furnace and are at least partially broken into smaller particles without  the  use  of  any  externally  imposed  force.<br>
When the furnace residence time is relatively short or the<br>
furnace temperature is relatively low, the sintering process and<br>
even the conversion to the alpha phase may not be completed when<br>
the material exits the furnace. In such event some or all of the<br>
particles may be porous to some degree and these relatively loosely<br>
consolidated larger particles may be broken up by a light milling<br>
operation before being sintered to a density in excess of 95% of<br>
theoretical in a separate furnace or by a second passage through<br>
the rotary furnace. This is sometimes preferred since a very<br>
intense explosive comminution can lea to the product of<br>
significant amounts of very fine particles that may be less useful<br>
in     some    abrasive     applications.	The     less     severe    explosive<br><br>
When the lumps of dried gel are placed in the furnace the vaporizable material in the lumps expands explosively causing them to fly apart leaving smaller particles which are highly suitable for use in grinding applications. If the residence time in the furnace is sufficiently long, the smaller particles that remain are rapidly converted to the alpha phase and sinter very quickly to the essentially fully densified form. The violent nature of this process has led to it being described familiarly as "explosive comminution" though in a preferred embodiment the process goes beyond comminution and includes firing to the alpha phase and, in some cases sintering to essentially theoretical density. Hence the temperature is somewhat lower, the amount of comminution may be reduced somewhat and may chiefly result in the break-up of the larger pieces and the creation of weakness lines in the remaining pieces that render them easily broken up in a subsequent comic "ton operation. This however is also regarded as explosive comminution.<br>

significant amounts of very fine particles that may be less useful<br>
in    some    abrasive     applications.	The     less     severe    explosive<br><br>
comminution has the effect of making even apparently unbroken particles very easy to comminute in a subsequent operation. Alternatively and sometimes preferably, the fired material that has not been completely explosively comminuted, which often has a degree of porosity, may be at least partially impregnated with a volatilizable liquid such as water and passed once more through the rotary  furnace  to  complete  the  comminution  process.<br>
Adjustment of the firing conditions to produce a product that is porous as described above also affords the opportunity of impregnating the porous material with solutions of modifying agents such as for example an aqueous solution of a soluble salt of magnesium, yttrium, a transition element, rubidium, cesium cry a rare earth metal. On sintering these materials will usually generate the modifying oxide in a very effective form and simultaneously generate further amounts of volatilizable material that  can  be  used  to  bring  about  explosive  comminution.<br>
Abrasive grain prepared in the above way often has an unexpectedly better grinding performance than grain obtained by more conventional processes. It is theorized that this may be because the comminution technique does not impose physical strains on the material of the type that„could give rise to defects in the abrasive grit structure. Regardless of theory this performance improvement  is  surprising  and  significant.<br>
Drawings<br>

Figure  2   shows  a  simplified  elevation  of  an  apparatus  adapted  for<br>
the    implementation    of    one    embodiment    of    the    process    of    the<br>

Detailed  Description  of  the  Invention<br>
From    the    drawing    presented    as    Figure     l,     which     is    a<br><br>
Differential Thermal Analysis trace following a seeded sol-gel as its temperature is raised/ it will be seen that there is an endothenn at about 400'C. This indicates the loss of volatiles including water and acid and salt decomposition products. It is this loss of volatiles that causes the explosive comminution. Clearly the faster this loss occurs, the more explosive the decomposition will be. By about 600"C the amount of volatiles to be removed has significantly diminished and conversion to the anhydrous phases of alumina such as gamma alumina is complete. At higher temperatures still, the conversion to the alpha phase begins. With seeded sol-gel materials, this occurs at about 1150°C or even lower. This is indicated by the peak in Figure 1. In an unseeded sol-gel, the trace will be very similar except that the alpha conversion peak will occur at a rather higher temperature, perhaps  lasso  or  so.<br>
To practice the invention it is only necessary to heat at a temperature at which the volatiles begin to be driven off. clearly higher temperatures than the minimum favor a very rapid decomposition that has the 'maximum explosive effect. However if the heating is sufficiently rapid even modest temperatures at the lower  end  of  the  above  ranges  can  be  used  effectively.<br>
If temperatures at the lower end of the above ranges, (that is where alpha alumina has still not been formed), are used, the explosively comminuted material must be subjected . to a further firing operation to complete the conversion to the alpha phase and (if desired) sinter the material to essentially theoretical density, (generally taken to be in excess of 95%). While this involves further expense, it does allow the use of rotary furnace materials that are much more sturdy and far less expensive that the silicon carbide tubes that are standard for furnaces in which all operations  are  performed  at  the  same  time.<br><br>
The sol-gel alumina is typically dried at temperatures below about 200°C and more preferably at much lower temperatures such as from  about  75  to  about  175°C.<br>
As has been indicated above, it is highly desirable to provide that the large particles of dried sol-gel material are heated as rapidly as possible to achieve the maximum expansion and explosive comminution. The apparatus illustrated in simplified elevation and partial cross-section in Figure 2 is well suited to meet these requirements. Uncrushed dried particles of a sol-gel alumina about 0.5 to about 1 cm in diameter are fed into the hopper, 1, from which they are fed through a vibratory feeder, 2, to a secondary feeder, 3. This secondary feeder discharges particles into an air educator, 4, which in turn accelerates the particles using a stream of compressed air entering through port, 5, which carries the particles through a conduit, 6, and into a rotary furnace, 7, having upper and lower ends, at a point, 8, adjacent the hot zone within the furnace. In use the particles explode when they enter the hot zone and comminuted particles exit the lower end, 9, of the furnace.<br>
In an explosive comminution process the heating of the lumps' of dried gel is preferably done rapidly to achieve the maximum explosive effect. While several furnace designs other than that illustrated in Figure 2 could be adapted to meet this requirement, a highly suitable furnace for carrying out the process is a rotary furnace comprising a tube inclined at an angle to the horizontal and rotating about its axis, said tube being heated by externally applied heat. The rotation of the tube ensures that the lumps or particles inside the tube are in constant movement such that no one part of a lump or particle is heated by contact with the tube to the exclusion of another part. The speed of rotation and the angle of incline of the tube determine the residence time inside Use furnace.     These  parameters  are  preferably  adjusted  to  ensure  that<br><br>
the evaporation of the vaporizable materials from inside the lumps happens rapidly rather than gradually. This is to enable the particles formed after the explosive breakup of the Imps to spend the  maximum  time  firing  and  dandifying.<br>
other furnace designs can be used as desired including batch furnaces optionally with fluidized beds and furnaces with microwave or  induction  heating.<br>
A rotary furnace for use with firing temperatures of the order of those needed to sinter alumina conveniently has a silicon carbide tube. This is because of its ability to stand up to the physical demands of the process including the temperature variations along the length and the different loads at different point along the tube length. silicon carbide is also able to withstand any acidic gases that might be generated, for example as nitrate  residues  are  eliminated.<br>
If however it is intended to carry out the explosive comminution and conversion to the alpha form at temperatures below those at which full sintering occurs, it is possible to use metal alloys capable of withstanding temperatures of up to about   such as "Inconel",<br>
Using a rotary furnace, the process of the invention requires a residence time in the hot zone of from about 1 second to about 30 minutes and preferably from about 2 seconds to about 20 minutes. To achieve such residence times the angle of elevation of the tube is preferably from about 1° to about 60° and more preferably from about 3" to about 20" and the speed of rotation is preferably about 0.5 to about 20 rpm and more preferably from about 1 to about 15 rpm.<br>
When firing a seeded sol-gel alumina the firing temperature in the  hot   zone   of   a   rotary   furnace   is   usually   from   about   AOO°C   to<br><br>
  and more preferably from about eoCC to about 1400'C. For an unseeded sol-gel alumina the hot zone is preferably maintained at a temperature of from about 400"c to about lesCC and more  preferably  from  about  600°c  to  about  ISSCC.<br>
The particles obtained by the explosive comminution process of the invention tend to have pronounced aspect ratios, that is, they have one dimension that is substantially longer than any other. Such particles are particularly useful in coated abrasive applications.<br>
The process of the invention is applicable to all types of sol-gel particle production particularly where these are intended for abrasive applications. The sol-gel can be seeded or unseeded, the only difference in the conditions used is that a higher sintering temperature is generally required when the sol-gel is unseeded.<br>
Because the process of the invention permits the elimination of the physical comminution stage typical of the prior art, the dried gel can be fed directly into the furnace from the drier. This  saves  considerable  time  and  energy  costs.<br>
Description  of  Preferred  Embodiments<br>
The process of the present invention is now described with particular reference to the firing of a seeded sol-gel alumina in a rotary furnace. These examples are for the sake of illustration only and are intended to imply no essential limitations on the essential  scope  of  the  invention.<br>
Example  1<br>
A Ross mixer was charged with 74,657gm of deionized water and a slurry of alpha alumina seeds having a BET surface area of about 120mVgra  wade   by   adding   6,000gm   of   a   6%   slurry   of   the   seeds   in<br><br>
deionized    water    to    10,OOOgm    of    deionized    water.	Boehmite,<br>
("Disperal" sold under that trademark by Condi GmbH), in an amount of 36,00kg was also added and the mix was evacuated and agitated for 5 minutes. A solution of i,67igm of 70% nitric acid in 5,0l4gm of deionized water was then added while the stirred mixture was maintained under vacuum and stirred for a further 5 to lo minutes. The vacuum was then released and the mixture was gelled by passing the mixture through an in-line mixer-homogenizer while injecting into the mixture a solution of 1,671gm of 70% nitric acid in 5,014gm  of  deionized  water.<br>
The gel was dried and broken up into lumps of from about 0.25cin to icm in size and these lumps were fed into a furnace. The dried sol-gel lumps were fed directly into a rotary furnace comprising a silicon carbide tube 213cm in length and I5cra in diameter, with a 50cm hot zone maintained at 1405°C. The tube was inclined  at  6"  to  the  horizontal  and  rotated  at  about  18  rpm.<br>
The lumps were explosively comminuted to a range of particle sizes from which SOT sized grits were separated for physical testing. The time for the material fired to transit the rotary furnace was about 1 to 2 minutes. The fired grits had a density in excess of 3.8gm/cc and comprised micro crystallites of alumina about  0.2  micron  in  diameter.<br>
For the sake of comparison the same sol-gel formulation was dried in the same way, roll-crushed to produce -24 mesh particles which were then claimed at about SOCC before being fired in a conventional  manner   in  a  conventional  rotary  furnace.<br>
The two samples were then made up into abrasive belts using exactly the same amounts of grit, backing, maker and size coats. Each belt carried 590gm of grit per square meter of surface area and  was   6.4cm  wide  and   152.4cm  long.      The   belts  were  run  at   9,000<br><br>
surface meters per minute and were used to cut a 304 stainless steel bar for 4 minutes under a water coolant at an applied force of  6.8kg.<br>
The belt made using the conventional grits cut 74g during this period while the belt made with the explosively crushed grits cut 94g,   or  a  27%  improvement  over  the  conventional  belt.<br>
Example  2<br>
Dried lumps of seeded sol-gel alumina at room temperature with a size of about +24T were fed directly at a rate of about 2.25 to about 4.5kg/hour into the hot zone of a rotary furnace maintained at lOOCC using an apparatus substantially as described in Figure 2. The furnace was the same as was used in Example 1 except that the tube was rotated at about 10 rpm and was inclined at about 7° to the horizontal. The gel particles were explosively comminuted in the furnace and the particle size distribution was as described in  Table  5  below.<br>
