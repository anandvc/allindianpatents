3. Preamble to the description<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this<br>
invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
This invention relates to a cast-extruded or a cast-cast combined water soluble film and a method/process for producing the same.<br>
More particularly, this invention relates to a combined water soluble film wherein atleast one layer is a solution cast water soluble film on a liner and atleast one layer is a preformed water soluble film, preferably a thermally extruded water soluble film. The said water soluble films may be edible or non edible. The said water-soluble film on a liner is coated with a tie-coat to enable coating of a water-based binder used for combining the water soluble films without dissolving/damaging WSF on liner. The water based binder used for combining the said water soluble! films may be incorporated with active ingredients like flavours, perfumes, detergents, enzymes, softeners, active agents for cleaning laundry, dishes, floorings, walls, furniture; various agrochemicals like pesticides, insecticides, weedicides, fungicides, bio-pesticides; agro nutrients like urea, fertilizers; dyes, pigments, fluff, pulp, super absorbents and active pharma ingredients like vitamins, drugs, medicine. The said combined water soluble film so achieved will be a substantially pinhole free multi-layered water soluble film of desired mechanical strength at low cost.<br>
The Background of Invention<br>
Water soluble films (WSFs) are commercially well known in the market. These films are usually used for packaging purpose such as liquid detergents, agrochemicals, toilet blocks, laundry bags, fish baits, pigments and dyestuffs, liquid chemicals and for embroidery purpose such as for making lace or can be used as a backing or a topping for embroidery. However, these applications are by no means limiting. These films may be biodegradable.<br>
These films are produced by solution cast method or by extrusion method. Solution cast films are cast from a slot, which controls thickness and weight, onto a steel belt or steel drum or a suitable liner etc.<br>
Extruded films can be blown (bubble type) or slit-die cast (Extrusion curtain type).<br>
In blown film extrusion, the molten polymer from the extruder enters the die and is<br>
forced around a mandrel and emerges from a ring shaped die. The extruded film tube is<br>
2<br><br>
then expanded to a specific diameter by air pressure from the center of the mandrel. As<br>
the bubble expands, the film thickness decreases.<br>
In slit die extrusion or flat film extrusion, the WSF is produced by extruding molten<br>
polymer through a slit-die and then cooling it on chilled rollers or in a water bath. In flat<br>
film extrusion, it is important to cool the material within a short distance of the die head<br>
so that a clear film is produced and necking (reduction in; width) does not occur..<br>
These films can be co-extruded in multiple layers or can be fed through multiple hoppers<br>
and/or screws. Manufacturing process and the blend will determine the quality of the<br>
film.<br>
All types of extrusion methods are thermally reactive and create pinholes in the resultant<br>
films. These pinholes are due to various reasons including improper thermal reactions,<br>
changes in polymer's molecular weight, improper gauge variation, uneven relative<br>
humidity acceptance, improper polymer melts, etc. Pinholes are detrimental to the final<br>
quality of the product being packed and are not acceptable to the industry. The films so<br>
formed have less "shrink back" property.<br>
Another problem of this method is control of moisture equilibrium within the WSF. This<br>
equilibrium is vital to get the right mechanical properties of WSF.<br>
But this process is economical to produce. So there was a need for pinhole free or<br>
substantially pinhole free water soluble film.<br>
Solution cast manufacturing process is a well accepted process to produce water soluble film with considerably less pinholes. In this process the polymers and additives are all dissolved completely in solvents, like, but not limited to, water of varying qualities and varying temperatures, while mixing in a batch mixing reactor. This leaves less possibility of pinholes as the polymers melts/dissolves in near totality. The additives mix properly and completely and thus the resultant film is of better quality. Moisture equilibrium, thickness and solubility can be finely controlled in this process.<br>
But this process is expensive, as the solution has to be cast on metal belt or a conveyor or a detachable liner and cured after the solvents dry out.<br>
3<br><br>
So there has been a need for an economical and substantially pinhole free water soluble film, with optimal mechanical properties.<br>
Combining two water soluble films had their own set of problems. One cannot blow a film on top of a solution cast film, as blown films are in a bubble form and solution cast films are in web forms individually wound.<br>
One cannot do T Die extrusion of a water soluble film on a solution cast film web as the film shall not come out unstuck from the chilling cylinder, which is inherent part of the T die extrusion process.<br>
Similar problems shall be faced during any of the combination of thermally activated extruded film with cast film.<br>
Similarly, one cannot cast a wet mix solution, which is usually cast on a conveyor at about 10°C to 95°C, preferably between 30°C to 70°C, more preferably between 35°C to 60°C. Casting such a wet/ liquid solution on a web of blown/extruded film shall dissolve partially or completely the web, prior to the combination web reaching the dryers and prove it to be commercially unviable.<br>
Also, while dispersing the active ingredient into the water soluble film, it has been noticed that some active ingredients like perfumes which are mixed in the batch used for forming the water soluble film layer diminishes after some time during storage, thereby affecting the quality.<br>
The Indian prior art 443/MUM/2001, relates to process for manufacturing embedded/entrapped water-soluble film (WSF) system and water soluble film (WSF) system manufactured by the said process. This invention describes the process for manufacturing water soluble films (WSFs) for diverse applications, in which a variety of substances such as detergents, enzymes, softeners, perfumes; agrochemicals like pesticides, fungicides, herbicides, weedicides, insecticides; agro nutrients like urea,<br>
4<br><br>
fertilizers; dyes, pigments, hazardous chemicals, fluff, pulp, super absorbents, active<br>
agents for cleaning laundry, dishes, floorings, walls and the like are embedded for<br>
delivering them in precise and desired quantities<br>
The above patent relates, to a water soluble film embedded/entrapped with active<br>
ingredients for precise delivery of active ingredients. It is restricted to embedding active<br>
ingredients within WSF and does not describe a process of combining two water soluble<br>
films.<br>
Another Indian patent, 1158/MUM/2001 discloses novel pin-hole free multi-layered films consisting partially or fully water soluble films layered! with substantially pin-hole free barrier coatings that are partially insoluble or fully water-soluble or dispersible and methods of manufacturing. The patent describes the detachable and/or non detachable substrate based multi-layered films with water soluble! or partially water-soluble films layered with substantially pin-hole free barrier coatings and methods of manufacturing the same.<br>
The above patent relates to a pinhole free multi-layered film by barrier coating on a water soluble film along with a liner. However, the patent does not describe a process of combining two water soluble films.<br>
Combination of two layers of water soluble films is desirable but difficult due to hydrophilic properties of both the layers. Various trials were taken and experiments conducted for combining the two layers of any types of water soluble films. This resulted in one of the film dissolving just on applying the coating of an adhesive, creating a hole or a void even before the next layer is brought for lamination. Experiments were even done for combining two layers of water soluble films by using adhesives base on hydrocarbon based solvents like, but not limited to xylene, toluene, MEK, MIBK, but the anchorage of these adhesives was not satisfactory.<br>
Hence, the main object of the present invention is to provide a cast-extruded or a cast-cast combined water soluble film, wherein the water soluble film on a liner is coated with a time-delay tie-coat to enable coating of a binder used for combining the layers of water<br>
5<br><br>
soluble films to achieve a substantially pinhole free multi-layered water soluble film of desired mechanical strength at low cost.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a combined water soluble film in which the properties like smell of the active ingredient such as perfume is retained for a longer period as the perfume is added to the binder and/or the tie-coat and which will remain blocked between the outer layers of the water soluble film and thereby improving the quality of perfumed/flavoured film.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a combined water soluble film, wherein other active ingredients like flavours, perfumes, detergents, enzymes, softeners, active agents for cleaning laundry, dishes, floorings, walls, furniture; various agrochemicals like pesticides, insecticides, weedicides, fungicides, bio-pesticides; agro nutrients like urea, fertilizers; dyes, pigments, fluff, pulp, super absorbents and active pharma ingredients like vitamins, drugs, medicine are added to the binder and/or the tie-coat for different applications.<br>
