				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to the manufacture of high dimensional<br>
cored wires containing de - sulphuriser compounds for removing sulphur from<br>
"hot metal" and a process for making the same. More particularly this invention<br>
pertains to high dimensional cored wires filled with a granular or powdery<br>
sulphur removing material selected from the group of calcium carbide, calcium<br>
oxide (lime), calcium metal, magnesium, magnesium-aluminium alloy, and<br>
preferably fine granules of reactive powders having a coat of inorganic or/and<br>
organic material, or even without a coating and simple granules with the<br>
mixtures of such inorganic or organic materials and a process for preparing<br>
such high dimensional cored wires.<br>
The present invention constitutes an improvement in or modification<br>
of the invention described and claimed in my main Patent Application<br>
No.725/KOL/2006 dated 20.07.2006. In the complete specification of my said<br>
main Patent Application there is descirbed and claimed high dimensional cored<br>
wires containing oxygen removers formed from cold-rolled steel sheet, said<br>
oxygen remover or de-oxidant material being in finely divided granular or<br>
powdery form coated with a protective coating material such as herein described,<br>
the diameter of the said cored wires varying between 13 and 40 mm, preferably<br>
between 19 and 34 mm, and the coated de-oxidant material filled in the core is<br>
held in place in compacted form by the seaming locks provided during formation<br>
of the said cored wires after filling.<br>
The said main Patent Application also relates to a process for preparing<br>
high dimensional cored wires containing oxygen removers comprising the steps<br>
of-<br>
(a) slitting cold-rolled steel sheet of thickness varying between 0.2<br>
and upto 1 mm and required width of 90-110 mm, providing for the<br>
double seaming locks;<br>
(b) feeding the slit coils into forming rolls which gives the slits the<br>
desired near round shape with diameter of 13 to 40 mm, preferably<br>
between 19 and 34 mm;<br>
(c) filling reactive aluminium powder/granules or other de-oxidants<br>
from bunkers or feeders into the blank spaces of the wire;<br>
(d) sealing the powder/granule filled wire, either singly or doubly,<br>
by the time it comes out of the last forming roll;<br>
(e) coiling the thus formed wire over a mandrel with inner diameter<br>
varying from 200 mm to 2.5 metres in diameter, generally of around<br>
1 metre in diameter, depending on customer requirement;<br>
(f) applying a thin film of oil or anti-rust solution to the exposed<br>
surface or outer layer of the coil to prevent rust formation, and<br>
(g) strapping and/or wrapping the coils with plastic/stretch film for<br>
preventing moisture ingress and then placing over wooden or steel pallets<br>
for delivery to the customer.<br>
De-sulphurisation plays an important role in the process of iron making<br>
and for which calcium carbide with lime and hydrocarbon and magnesium or<br>
magnesium aluminium alloys with lime with or without hydrocarbons have been<br>
conventionally used. The term de-sulphuriser means a chemical compound,<br>
alloy or element which will remove the active sulphur present in the liquid metal<br>
and form a sulphide as its final product, usually as a distinct phase and easily<br>
separable from the liquid metal. Iron making is integral to the steel making<br>
process and de-sulphurisation of hot metal is an important processing<br>
step, which determiners the quality of steel. Sulphur, if present in iron and<br>
consequently steel in the active/elemnental form, will deteriorate the quality of<br>
steel and will also result in difficulties in steel making. The steel thus made will<br>
have lesser demand and consequetly lesser price realization. Steel makers are<br>
in regular search of a better and more economical method for removing sulphur<br>
in the steel.<br>
The existing process of de-sulphurisation involves pneumatic injection of<br>
the finely powdered de-sulphuriser reagent through a ceramic lance into the<br>
hot metal, involving either mono or co-injection of the reagents. That is either<br>
just calcium carbide based reagent is injected or both calcium carbide and<br>
magnesium-based reagents are co-injected simultaneously as per determined<br>
process.<br>
The process suffers from the following limitations :<br>
a) The calcium caride based reagent is highly explosive in nature<br>
and requires extensive and very elaborate safety precautions to be<br>
taken in its handling and storage.<br>
b) The reagent in the storage tanks requires regular purging with<br>
dry nitrogen to ensure that it does not settle down and jam the exit<br>
injection pipelines.<br>
c) An extensive and elaborate pollution control system needs to be<br>
installed to clean the oxide of nitrogen that are formed when the injected<br>
nitrogen surfaces from the molten metal and comes in contact with the<br>
oxygen in air. These fumes also contain some calcium carbide and other<br>
powder which also needs to be handled carefully so that no explosion<br>
takes place in the pollution equipment.<br>
d) The recovery of the reagent is also limited and is not more than<br>
40-45% by wt.<br>
e) Explosive license is required for the whole de-sulphuriser plant<br>
and all the rules and regulations regarding working in an explosive<br>
area need to be observed meticulously.<br>
f) Investment in the plant and equipment are considerable.<br>
g) Plant requires considerable space and close monitoring.<br>
The present invention aims at overcoming the foregoing shortcomings of<br>
the prior art and carry out production of de-sulpurisation of hot metal more<br>
efficiently and effectively and with lower consumption of the reagents.<br>
The process has the objective of economizing the hot metal<br>
de-sulphurisation by cored wire injection by reducing the quantum of steel used<br>
as a sheath for encasing the powdery/granular de-sulphuriser reagents by<br>
using the higher dimension cored wire.<br>
This invention has also the objective to further enhance the recovery of<br>
the de-sulphuriser reagents, simultaneously reducing the quantum of<br>
consumpton and time of feeding of the de-sulphuriser to the liquid metal.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a technique to use<br>
magnesium or magnesium-aluminium alloy scrap as de-sulphurisers after<br>
converting them into granules or calcium carbide powder/granules as<br>
desulphuriser reagent, mixed with lime and hydrocarbons, followed by coating<br>
with a material like graphite, low density polythene, polyamide, low molecular<br>
weight vinyl acetate polymer, talc, steatite, calcium silicide, powdered lime,<br>
hydrocarbons and the like to prevent fusion or adhesion of the granular<br>
particles into a single mass while being pressed and drawn in the wire as well as<br>
generate the required amount of gas when in contact with the moltel hot metal<br>
to ensure intimate mixing of the powdered reagent in the hot metal, resulting in<br>
good reaction and high sulphur removal.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide high dimensional<br>
cored wires containing de-sulphuriser granules coated with graphite which<br>
while being drawn, the contents become tightly packed, thereby imparting<br>
dimensional rigidity and stiffness to the wire.<br>
A further object of the invention is to impart thermal stability to the<br>
wire so that it remains cool for a longer time than thinner wires and is able to<br>
penetrate deeper into the hot metal and thus has better thermal stability<br>
to prevent deformation and which will eventually result in better action and<br>
recovery of the reagents.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide high dimentional cored wires<br>
with a non-adherent coating of polymeric material on the inside surface of the<br>
said cored wires.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide high dimentional cored<br>
wires containing de-sulphurising agents in granular form without coating but<br>
mixed with the aforementioned coating material (s) filled into the same wire.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for<br>
preparing high dimensional cored wires containing de-sulphurising agents in<br>
a granular form and coated with a protective coating to prevent sticking and<br>
fusing into a single mass while being pressed and drawn into wire.<br>
The foregoing objects are achieved by the present invention which<br>
pertains to high dimentional cored wires containing de-sulphurising agents<br>
for removal of sulphur from hot metal characterized in that said wires contain<br>
sulphur-removers or de-sulphurising agent(s) formed from cold rolled steel sheet,<br>
said sulphur-removers or de-sulphurising agent(s) being in finely divided granular<br>
or powdery form coated with a protective coating material such as herein<br>
described, the diameter of said cored wires varying between 19 and 40 mm,<br>
and the coated de-sulphurising agent(s) filled in the core is held in place in<br>
compacted form by the seaming locks provided during formation of the said<br>
cored wires by being pressed and drawn after filling, to generate gas for<br>
dispersing the said de-sulphurising agent(s) throughout the hot metal and<br>
promote intimate mixing, better reaction and removal of sulphur from hot metal<br>
as sulphides.<br>
The subject invention also relates to a process for high dimensional<br>
cored wires containing sulphur removers as defined above and comprising<br>
the steps of -<br>
a) slitting cold rolled steel sheet of thickness varying between 0.2 mm<br>
and upto 1 mm, and required width of 90-110 mm, providing for the<br>
double seaming locks;<br>
b) coating the slit coils with plastic or BOPP (bi-axially oriented poly<br>
propylene) film to prevent the reaction of the chemicals with the cold<br>
rolled steel strip;<br>
c) feeding the slit coils into forming rolls which gives the slits the<br>
desired near round shape with a diameter of 13 to 40 mm;<br>
d) filling reactive de-sulphuriser powder/granules or other<br>
de-sulphrisers such as herein described from bunkers or feeders into the<br>
empty spaces of the wire to ensure that the wire is tightly packed with the<br>
powders, this powder density varying for wires of different diameters;<br>
e) sealing the powder/granule filled wire, either singly or doubly by<br>
the time it comes out of the last forming roll;<br>
f) coiling the wire thus formed over a mandrel with inner diameter<br>
varying from 200 mm to 2.5 meters in diameter, generally of around<br>
1.2 meter in diameter, depending on customer requirement;<br>
g) applying a thin film of oil or anti-rust solution to the exposed<br>
surface or outer layer of the coil to prevent rust formation, and<br>
h) strapping and/or wrapping the coils with plastic/stretch film for<br>
preventing moisture ingress and then placing over wooden or steel pallets<br>
for delivery to the customer.<br>
In the above process, even uncoated slit coils may be used, avoiding use of<br>
expensive 'BOPP' film, if the shelf life is short. The prererred diameter of rolls<br>
formed from the slit coils varies between 19 and 34 mm.<br>
As regards BOPP tape, it is being increasingly used since it is strong and<br>
does not tear easily like other plastic materials. An additional advantage with<br>
the BOPP tape is that at very high molten metal temperature, it would form<br>
gases which would help in stirring the hot metal ensuring enhanced removal of<br>
sulphur.<br>
The most frequently used de-sulphuriser is either metallic magnesium or<br>
calcium carbide. The former is generally coated with 5% CaO (lime) to reduce<br>
the risk of an accident, and for the latter during its handling, the area is purged<br>
with gaseous nitrogen.<br>
Oil and anti-rust solution appl'ed to the outer surface of the finished coil<br>
are obtained from petroleum fraction which are viscous and greasy, acting as an<br>
effective barrier against rust-forming agents.<br>
As pointed out earlier, de-sulphurisers may be selected from calcium<br>
carbide, and mixed with calcium oxide (lime), hydrocarbons or calcium metal,<br>
magnesium, magnesium-aluminium alloy, and preferably fine granules of<br>
reactive magnesium based regent or regents of calcium carbide powders having<br>
a coat of inorganic or/and organic metarial, preferably lime and hydrocarbons,<br>
or even without a coating and simple granules with the mixtures of inorganic or<br>
organic materials.<br>
Size of de-sulphuriser granules should optimally be around 10 mesh, but<br>
finer or coarser granules may just as well be used; however, care should be<br>
taken to prevent handling loss. While drawing the granular desulphuriser<br>
reagent -filled wire, the contents become tightly packed, imparting dimensional<br>
stability and stiffness to the wire, thereby ensuring ease of handling the coil.<br>
De-sulphurisation by changing the form of desulphuriser reagent<br>
addition, which is carried out by injecting high dimentional cored wire filled<br>
with highly reactive de-sulphurisation reagent in fine granular form and coated<br>
with an organic material like graphite for better recovery and achieving the<br>
optimum level of sulphur and with lesser consumption of the de-sulphurisation<br>
reagent are unique features of this invention. The coating is not limited to<br>
organic materials but can also include inorganic coating materials as well,<br>
like calcium oxide, talc, chalk powder, and the like. De-sulphurisation in<br>
accordance with the present invention can be carried out in hot metal at<br>
any stage it travels from the blast furnace to the steel making area as per<br>
requirement of the steel maker.<br>
A notable feature of this invention is to use scrap magnesium or<br>
magnesium aluminium alloy of any grade in granular or powdered form as the<br>
de-sulphurisers, suitably coated with organic or inorganic coating material as<br>
described hereinbefore. Use of scrap/waste magnesium or magnesium aluminium<br>
alloy effectively adds to the economy of the overall process.<br>
As an additional feature of this invention, i.e. winding of the powder-filled<br>
coil is subjected to 'coreless coiling' so that the coil can be uncoiled from inner<br>
diameter of the stationary coil generally called a flipping coil, either vertical or<br>
horizontal. The coil can also be made into a spool with a core made of either<br>
wooden, synthetic, metal or any such materials.<br>
The novel products of this invention, namely, high dimensional cored wire<br>
filled with fine granules of the de-sulphuriser reagents powder/granules coated<br>
with graphite and securely held inside, is provided with seaming locks. By 'high<br>
dimensional' it is implied that dimensions of the cored wire ranges between 13<br>
mm and 40 mm, optimally between 19 mm and 34 mm, and the internal diam-<br>
eter of the wound wire over the mandrel vary between 200 mm to 2.5 meters and<br>
the weight of each coil may range between 1 MT to around 20 MT depending on<br>
customer, storage and handling requirements. The high dimension as stated<br>
has the technical advantage of providing thermal stability, which ensure deeper<br>
penetration of the wire into the melt thus resulting in better recovery of the<br>
reagents.<br>
The present invention will be further illustrated by the consumption data<br>
of the reagents as per the reduction in sulphur levels that has been achieved as<br>
mentioned in the table and the example given below. It is to be understood that<br>
the invention is not restricted to the results given therein.<br>
Various advantages of the products of the present invention may be briefly<br>
outlined as under :<br>
1. An increasing amount of de-sulphuriser reagents can be filled per<br>
unit length of wire, and as more material is compacted per meter of wire of<br>
larger dimension, the cost of the steel sheathing becomes less.<br>
2. There is substantial rise in the feeding rate, thereby saving feeding<br>
time and resulting in an enhanced time available for steel making.<br>
3. Due to larger dimension, better rigidity and stiffness, the high<br>
dimensional wire allows for deeper penetration into steel, thereby resulting in<br>
better recovery and homogenization of the de-sulphurisers.<br>
4. Coated fine granules of the de-sulphurisation reagents is used as<br>
filler material for making high dimensional cored wire resulting in an estimated<br>
10-15% higher recovery than the conventional pneumatic injection system for<br>
reagents.<br>
5. Since the de-sulphuriser reagent is steel sheathed cored wire and<br>
is also "flipping type", there is a saving on the transportation (since normal<br>
trucks can be used to transport the material, unlike explosive licensed storage<br>
tanks for the conventional de-sulphurisation reagent) and easier storage since it<br>
can be stored anywhere unlike in the de-sulphuriser reagent for the pneumatic<br>
injection system. The storage cost is drastically reduced and the shelf life is also<br>
higher since the de-sulphuriser reagent is encased in a tightly covered steel<br>
sheath and is water and moisture proof.<br>
As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without<br>
departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be<br>
understood that the above-described experimental data are not limited by any<br>
of the details of the foregoing description, unless otherwise specified, but rather<br>
should be construed broadly within its spirit and ambit as defined in the claims<br>
appended hereafter, and therefore all changes and modifications that fall within<br>
the meets and bounds of the claims, or equivalences or such meets and bounds,<br>
are therefore intended to be embraced by the appended claims.<br>
