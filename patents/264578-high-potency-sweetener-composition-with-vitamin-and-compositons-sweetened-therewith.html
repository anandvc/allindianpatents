				<td>HIGH-POTENCY SWEETENER COMPOSITION WITH VITAMIN AND COMPOSITIONS SWEETENED THEREWITH<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to a functional sweetener and orally ingestible compositions containing same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
â–º	Nutrition usually focuses on the relationship between food and human health from<br>
the perspective of ensuring all essential nutrients are adequately supplied and utilized to optimize health and well being. As diseases typically related to nutritional deficiency were managed, there has been a recognition that many nutrients have health benefits beyond basic nutrition. Accordingly, functional ingredients have been identified as playing a key role in an individual's overall health.<br>
"Functional ingredients" offer potential health benefits beyond basic nutrition when incorporated into foods, beverages, and other orally ingested products. Such ingredients have been shown to help reduce the risk of or manage a number of health concerns, including cancer, heart and cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal health, menopausal symptoms, osteoporosis, and vision. Since 1993, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved numerous health claims for the labeling of food products with information related to the health benefits of functional food (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, A Food Labeling Guide (2000)).<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Although not yet approved by the FDA for the purposes of labeling, numerous other functional foods are believed to provide health benefits beyond those listed above, such as reduced inflammation.<br>
Functional ingredients generally are classified into categories such as carotenoids, dietary fiber, fatty acids, flavonoids, isothiocyanates, phenols, plant sterols and stands (phytosterols and phytostanols); polyols; prebiotics/probiotics; phytoestrogens; soy protein; sulfides/thiols; amino acids; proteins; vitamins; and minerals. Functional ingredients also may be classified based on their health benefits, such as cardiovascular, cholesterol-reducing, and anti-inflammatory.<br>
Health trends also have promoted an increased use of non-caloric high-potency sweeteners in consumer diets. Although natural caloric sweetener compositions, such as<br>
sucrose, fructose, and glucose, provide the most desirable taste to consumers, they are caloric. Numerous natural and synthetic high-potency sweeteners are non-caloric; however, they exhibit sweet tastes that have different temporal profiles, maximal responses, flavor profiles, mouthfeels, and/or adaptation behaviors than that of sugar.<br>
5	For example, the sweet tastes of natural and synthetic high-potency sweeteners are<br>
slower in onset and longer in duration than the sweet taste produced by sugar and thus change the taste balance of a food composition. Because of these differences, use of natural and synthetic high-potency sweeteners to replace a bulk sweetener, such as sugar, in a food or beverage, causes an unbalanced temporal profile and/or flavor profile.   In<br>
) addition to the difference in temporal profile, high-potency sweeteners generally exhibit (i) lower maximal response than sugar, (ii) off tastes including bitter, metallic, cooling, astringent, licorice-like taste, etc., and/or (iii) sweetness which diminishes on iterative tasting. It is well known to those skilled in the art of food/beverage formulation that changing the sweetener in-a composition requires re-balancing of the flavor and other taste components (e.g., acidulants). If the taste profile of natural and synthetic high-potency sweeteners could be modified to impart specific desired taste characteristics to be more sugar-like, the type and variety of compositions that may be prepared with that sweetener would be expanded significantly. Accordingly, it would be desirable to selectively modify the taste characteristics of natural and synthetic high-potency sweeteners.<br>
It also would be desirable to improve the taste of ingestible compositions that include functional ingredients to promote their use and the resulting health benefits.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Generally, this invention addresses the above described need by providing a functional sweetener composition having improved temporal profile and/or flavor profile and a method for improving the temporal profile and/or flavor profile of a functional sweetener composition. In another particular embodiment, this invention provides a functional sweetened composition comprising a sweetenable composition in combination with a functional sweetener composition having an improved temporal profile and/or flavor profile, and a method for improving the temporal profile and/or flavor profile of the functional sweetened composition.   In particular, this invention improves the temporal<br><br>
profile and/or flavor profile by imparting a more sugar-like temporal profile and/or flavor profile. More particularly, this invention comprises a functional sweetener composition or a functional sweetened composition comprising at least one vitamin; at least one high-potency sweetener; and at least one sweet taste improving composition.<br>
Objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms and abbreviations used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention pertains. Although methods and compositions similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in practice of the present invention, suitable methods and compositions are described without intending that any such methods and compositions limit the invention herein.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Reference now will be made in detail to the presently proffered embodiments of the invention. Each example is provided by way of explanation of embodiments of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment, can be used on another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover such modifications and variations within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
Embodiments of this invention include functional sweetener compositions and functional sweetened compositions comprising at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, at least one sweet taste improving composition, and at least one functional ingredient. Also embodied in this invention are methods for making functional sweetener compositions and functional sweetened compositions.<br>
I.	Functional Ingredients<br>
In a particular embodiment, a sweetener composition comprises at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, at least one sweet-taste improving composition, and at least one functional ingredient. The functional ingredient desirably comprises at least one vitamin.<br>
Since their discovery at the beginning of the 20th century vitamins have been known to constitute an important part of a healthy diet. Vitamins are organic compounds that the human body needs in small quantities for normal functioning. The body uses vitamins without breaking them down, unlike other nutrients such as carbohydrates and proteins. To date, thirteen vitamins have been recognized, including vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, vitamin Bl, vitamin B2, vitamin B3, vitamin B5, vitamin B6, vitamin B7, vitamin B9, vitamin B12, and vitamin C. Many of vitamins also have alternative chemical names, non-limiting examples of which are provided below.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Various other compounds have been classified as vitamins by some authorities. These compounds may be termed pseudo-vitamins and include, but are not limited to, compounds such as ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10), pangamic acid, dimethylglycine, taestrile, amygdaline, flavanoids, para-aminobenzoic acid, adenine, adenylic acid, and s-methylmethionine. As used herein, the term vitamin includes pseudo-vitamins.<br>
Vitamins can be classified as either fat- or water-soluble. Fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the cells of the body and are not easily excreted, thus, they do not need to be consumed as frequently. However, fat-soluble vitamins are more likely to reach toxic levels in the body as compared with water-soluble vitamins. Four of the thirteen compounds that have been classified as vitamins are fat-soluble, including vitamins A, D, E, and K.<br>
Water-soluble vitamins dissolve easily in water and travel freely throughout the body. Excess amounts of water-soluble vitamins are usually excreted by the kidneys. Nine of the thirteen compounds that have been classified as vitamins are water-soluble,<br><br>
including vitamin Bl, vitamin B2, vitamin B3, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, folic acid, biotin, pantothenic acid, and vitamin C.<br>
Generally, vitamins must be obtained from external sources because the human body is unable to synthesize these compounds from other nutrients. Exceptions include vitamins K and B7, which are produced by microorganisms in the intestines, and vitamin D, which is synthesized in the skin with the help of ultraviolet radiation in sunlight. In addition, vitamins A and B3 can be produced from precursors P-carotene and tryptophan, respectively. All vitamins can be obtained through the ingestion of food or beverage. As used herein, the term vitamin includes precursors, including, but not limited to, P-carotene and tryptophan.<br>
Vitamins are essential for normal growth and development and also are important to maintaining good health. They are necessary in order for the body to process proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Vitamins also are essential for proper functioning of the nervous system and for building cells and tissues. They serve as catalysts or reagents in numerous processes within the body. An inadequate diet can lead to vitamin deficiencies, causing illnesses such as scurvy, rickets, pellagra, and beriberi. These illnesses are avoidable with proper vitamin intake.<br>
In addition to their importance in normal bodily function, vitamins can provide additional health benefits. For example, vitamins A, C, and E are antioxidants. Antioxidants help to control free radicals in the body. Free radicals are highly reactive atoms or molecules having an unpaired electron that can damage cells and tissues in the body. A buildup of free radicals may contribute to diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, and some forms of cancer. By neutralizing free radicals within the body, antioxidants can lower the incidence of such diseases. Because of their nutritional and functional benefits, it would be desirable to supplement food and beverages with vitamins.<br>
As used herein, the at least one vitamin may comprise a single vitamin or a plurality of vitamins as a functional ingredient for the sweetener compositions provided herein. Generally, according to particular embodiments of this invention, the at least one vitamin is present in the sweetener composition or sweetened orally ingestible composition in an amount sufficient to promote health and wellness.<br><br>
According to a desirable embodiment, p-carotene is provided in the sweetener composition in an amount from about 250 to about 350 ug per serving. According to another embodiment, vitamin B2 is provided in the sweetener composition in an amount from about 0.1 to about 0.2 mg per serving. According to still another embodiment, vitamin B3 is provided in the sweetener composition in an amount from about 1.5 to about 2.0 mg per serving. According to yet another embodiment, vitamin B6 is provided in the sweetener composition in an amount from about 0.1 to about 0.3 mg per serving. According to another embodiment, vitamin B12 is provided in the sweetener composition in an amount from about 0.4 to about 0.6 ug per serving. According to still embodiment, vitamin C is provided in the sweetener composition in an amount from about 50 to about 70 mg per serving. According to yet embodiment, vitamin D is provided in the sweetener composition in an amount from about 2.0 to about 3.0 ug per serving. According to another embodiment, vitamin E is provided in the sweetener composition in an amount from about 2.5 to about 3.5 mg per serving.<br>
According to particular embodiments of this invention, the sweetener compositions provided herein further may comprise at least one functional ingredient different than the vitamins described above. According to particular embodiments of this invention, non-limiting examples of such functional ingredients include naturally nutrient-rich or medicinally active food, such as garlic, soybeans, antioxidants, fibers, glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, ginseng, ginko, Echinacea, or the like; other nutrients that provide health benefits, such as amino acids, minerals, carotenoids, dietary fiber, fatty acids such as omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids, DHA, EPA, or ALA which can be derived from plant or animal sources (e.g., salmon and other cold-water fish or algae), flavonoids, phenols, polyols, prebiotics/probiotics, phytoestrogens, sulfides/thiols, policosanol, saponin, rubisco peptide, appetite suppressants, hydration agents, autoimmune agents, C-reactive protein reducing agents, or anti-inflammatory agents; or any other functional ingredient that is beneficial to the treatment of specific diseases or conditions, such as diabetes, osteoporosis, inflammation, or cholesterol.<br><br>
II.        Natural and/or Synthetic High-Potency Sweeteners<br>
The sweetener compositions provided also comprise at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener.    As used herein the phrases "natural high-potency sweetener",   "NHPS",   "NHPS   composition",   and   "natural   high-potency   sweetener composition" are synonymous. "NHPS" means any sweetener found in nature which may be in raw, extracted, purified, or any other form, singularly or in combination thereof and characteristically have a sweetness potency greater than sucrose, fructose, or glucose, yet have less calories.   Non-limiting examples of NHPSs suitable for embodiments of this invention include rebaudioside A, rebaudioside B, rebaudioside C, rebaudioside D, rebaudioside E, rebaudioside F, dulcoside A, dulcoside B, rubusoside, stevia, stevioside, mogroside IV, mogroside V, Luo Han Guo sweetener, siamenoside, monatin and its salts (monatin SS, RR, RS, SR), curculin, glycyrrhizic acid and its salts, thaumatin, monellin, mabinlin,   brazzein,   hernandulcin,   phyllodulcin,   glycyphyllin,   phloridzin,   trilobatin, baiyunoside,    osladin,    polypodoside    A,    pterocaryoside    A,    pterocaryoside    B, mukurozioside, phlomisoside I, periandrin I, abrusoside A, and cyclocarioside I.   NHPS also includes modified NHPSs. Modified NHPSs include NHPSs which have been altered naturally.   For example, a modified NHPS includes, but is not limited to, NHPSs which have been fermented, contacted with enzyme, or derivatized or substituted on the NHPS. In one embodiment, at least one modified NHPS may be used in combination with at least one NHPS.  In another embodiment, at least one modified NHPS may be used without a NHPS.    Thus, modified NHPSs may be substituted for a NHPS or may be used in combination with NHPSs for any of the embodiments described herein.  For the sake of brevity, however, in the description of embodiments of this invention, a modified NHPS is not expressly described as an alternative to an unmodified NHPS, but it should be understood that modified NHPSs can be substituted for NHPSs in any embodiment disclosed herein.<br>
In one embodiment, extracts of a NHPS may be used in any purity percentage. In another embodiment, when a NHPS is used as a non-extract, the purity of the NHPS may range for example from about 25% to about 100%. According to other embodiments, the purity of the NHPS may range from about 50% to about 100%; from about 70% to about 100%; from about 80% to about 100%; from about 90% to about 100%; from about 95%<br><br>
to about 100%; from about 95% to about 99.5%; from about 96% to about 100%; from about 97% to about 100%; from about 98% to about 100%; and from about 99% to about 100%.<br>
Purity, as used here, represents the weight percentage of a respective NHPS compound present in a NHPS extract, in raw or purified form. In one embodiment, a steviolglycoside extract comprises a particular steviolglycoside in a particular purity, with the remainder of the stevioglycoside extract comprising a mixture of other steviolglycosides.<br>
To obtain a particularly pure extract of a NHPS, such as rebaudioside A, it may be necessary to purify the crude extract to a substantially pure form. Such methods generally are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
An exemplary method for purifying a NHPS, such as rebaudioside A, is described in the co-pending patent application no. 60/805,216, entitled "Rebaudioside A Composition and Method for Purifying Rebaudioside A," filed on June 19, 2006, by inventors DuBois, et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Briefly described, substantially pure rebaudioside A is crystallized in a single step from an aqueous organic solution comprising at least one organic solvent and water in an amount from about 10 % to about 25 % by weight, more particularly from about 15 % to about 20 % by weight. Organic solvents desirably comprise alcohols, acetone, and acetonitile. Non-limiting examples of alcohols include ethanol, methanol, isopranol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, tert-butanol, and isobutanol. Desirably, the at least one organic solvent comprises a mixture of ethanol and methanol present in the aqueous organic solution in a weight ratio ranging from about 20 parts to about 1 part ethanol to 1 part methanol, more desirably from about 3 parts to about 1 part ethanol to 1 part methanol.<br>
Desirably, the weight ratio of the aqueous organic solvent and crude rebaudioside A ranges from about 10 to about 4 parts aqueous organic solvent to 1 part crude rebaudioside A, more particularly from about 5 to about 3 parts aqueous organic solvent to 1 part crude rebaudioside A.<br><br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the method of purifying rebaudioside A is carried out at approximately room temperature. In another embodiment, the method of purifying rebaudioside A further comprises the step of heating the rebaudioside A solution to a temperature in a range from about 20Â°C to about 40Â°C, or in another embodiment to a reflux temperature, for about 0.25 hours to about 8 hours. In another exemplary embodiment, wherein the method for purifying rebaudioside A comprises the step of heating the rebaudioside A solution, the method further comprises the step of cooling the rebaudioside A solution to a temperature in the range from about 4Â°C to about 25Â°C for about 0.5 hours to about 24 hours.<br>
According to particular embodiments, the purity of rebaudioside A may range from about 50% to about 100%; from about 70% to about 100%; from about 80% to about 100%; from about 90% to about 100%; from about 95% to about 100%; from about 95% to about 99.5%; about 96% to about 100%; from about 97% to about 100%; from about 98% to about 100%; and from about 99% to about 100%. According to particularly desirable embodiments, upon crystallization of crude rebaudioside A, the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition comprises rebaudioside A in a purity greater than about 95 % by weight up to about 100% by weight on a dry basis. In other exemplary embodiments, substantially pure rebaudioside A comprises purity levels of rebaudioside A greater than about 97 % up to about 100% rebaudioside A by weight on a dry basis, greater than about 98 % up to about 100% by weight on a dry basis, or greater than about 99 % up to about 100% by weight on a dry basis. The rebaudioside A solution during the single crystallization step may be stirred or unstirred.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the method of purifying rebaudioside A further comprises the step of seeding (optional step) the rebaudioside A solution at an appropriate temperature with high-purity crystals of rebaudioside A sufficient to promote crystallization of the rebaudioside A to form pure rebaudioside A. An amount of rebaudioside A sufficient to promote crystallization of substantially pure rebaudioside A comprises an amount of rebaudioside A from about 0.0001 % to about 1 % by weight of the rebaudioside A present in the solution, more particularly from about 0.01 % to about 1 % by weight. An appropriate temperature for the step of seeding comprises a temperature in a range from about 18Â°C to about 35Â°C.<br><br>
In another exemplary embodiment, the method of purifying rebaudioside A further comprises the steps of separating and washing the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition. The substantially pure rebaudioside A composition may be separated from the aqueous organic solution by a variety of solid-liquid separation techniques that utilize centrifugal force, that include, without limitation, vertical and horizontal perforated basket centrifuge, solid bowl centrifuge, decanter centrifuge, peeler type centrifuge, pusher type centrifuge, Heinkel type centrifuge, disc stack centrifuge and cyclone separation. Additionally, separation may be enhanced by any of pressure, vacuum, and gravity filtration methods, that include, without limitation, the use of belt, drum, nutsche type, leaf, plate, Rosenmund type, sparkler type, and bag filters and filter press. Operation of the rebaudioside A solid-liquid separation device may be continuous, semi-continuous or in batch mode. The substantially pure rebaudioside A composition also may be washed on the separation device using various aqueous organic solvents and mixtures thereof. The substantially pure rebaudioside A composition can be dried partially or totally on the separation device using any number of gases, including, without limitation, nitrogen and argon, to evaporate residual liquid solvent. The substantially pure rebaudioside A composition may be removed automatically or manually from the separation device using liquids, gases or mechanical means by either dissolving the solid or maintaining the solid form.<br>
In still another exemplary embodiment, the method of purifying rebaudioside A further comprises the step of drying the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition using techniques well known to those skilled in the art, non-limiting examples of which include the use of a rotary vacuum dryer, fluid bed dryer, rotary tunnel dryer, plate dryer, tray dryer, Nauta type dryer, spray dryer, flash dryer, micron dryer, pan dryer, high and low speed paddle dryer and microwave dryer. In an exemplary embodiment, the step of drying comprises drying the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition using a nitrogen or argon purge to remove the residual solvent at a temperature in a range from about 40Â°C to about 60Â°C for about 5 hours to about 100 hours.<br>
In yet another exemplary embodiment, wherein the crude rebaudioside A mixture comprises substantially no rebaudioside D impurity, the method of purifying rebaudioside A  further  comprises  the  step  of slurrying the  composition  of substantially  pure<br><br>
rebaudioside A with an aqueous organic solvent prior to the step of drying the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition. The slurry is a mixture comprising a solid and an aqueous organic or organic solvent, wherein the solid comprises the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition and is only sparingly soluble in the aqueous organic or organic solvent. In an embodiment, the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition and aqueous organic solvent are present in the slurry in a weight ratio ranging from about 15 parts to 1 part aqueous organic solvent to 1 part substantially pure rebaudioside A composition. In one embodiment, the slurry is maintained at room temperature. In another embodiment, the step of slurrying comprises heating the slurry to a temperature in a range from about 20 to about 40Â°C. The substantially pure rebaudioside A composition is slurried for about 0.5 hours to about 24 hours.<br>
In still yet another exemplary embodiment, the method of purifying rebaudioside A further comprises the steps of separating the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition from the aqueous organic or organic solvent of the slurry and washing the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition followed by the step of drying the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition.<br>
If further purification is desired, the method of purifying rebaudioside A described herein may be repeated or the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition may be purified further using an alternative purification method, such as the column chromatography.<br>
It also is contemplated that other NHPSs may be purified using the purification method described herein, requiring only minor experimentation that would be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The purification of rebaudioside A by crystallization as described above results in the formation of at least four different polymorphs: Form 1: a rebaudioside A hydrate; Form 2: an anhydrous rebaudioside A; Form 3: a rebaudioside A solvate; and Form 4: an amorphous rebaudioside A. The aqueous organic solution and temperature of the purification process influence the resulting polymorphs in the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition. Figures 1-5 are exemplary powder x-ray diffraction (XRPD) scans of polymorphs Form 1 (hydrate), Form 2 (anhydrate), Form 3A (methanol solvate),<br><br>

Table 1: Rebaudioside A Polymorphs<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The type of polymorph formed is dependent on the composition of the aqueous organic solution, the temperature of the crystallization step, and the temperature during the drying step. Form 1 and Form 3 are formed during the single crystallization step while Form 2 is formed during the drying step after conversion from Form 1 or Form 3.<br>
Low temperatures during the crystallization step, in the range of about 20Â°C to about 50Â°C, and a low ratio of water to the organic solvent in the aqueous organic solvent results in the formation of Form 3. High temperatures during the crystallization step, in the range of about 50Â°C to about 80Â°C, and a high ratio of water to the organic solvent in the aqueous organic solvent results in the formation of the Form 1. Form 1 can be converted to Form 3 by slurrying in an anhydrous solvent at room temperature (2-16 hours) or at reflux for approximately (0.5-3 hours). Form 3 can be converted to Form 1 by slurrying the polymorph in water at room temperature for approximately 16 hours or at reflux for approximately 2-3 hours. Form 3 can be converted to the Form 2 during the drying process; however, increasing either the drying temperature above 70Â°C or the drying time of a substantially pure rebaudioside A composition can result in decomposition of the rebaudioside A and increase the remaining rebaudioside B impurity in the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition. Form 2 can be converted to Form 1 with the addition of water.<br>
Form 4 may be formed from Form 1, 2, 3, or combinations thereof, using methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Non-limiting examples of such methods include melt-processing, ball milling, crystallization, lyophilization, cryo-grinding, and<br><br>
spray-drying. In a particular embodiment, Form 4 can be prepared from a substantially pure rebaudioside A composition obtained by the purification methods described hereinabove by spray-drying a solution of the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition.<br>

III.       Sweet Taste Improving Compositions<br>
The sweetener composition also comprises a sweet taste improving composition, non-limiting examples of which include carbohydrates, polyols, amino acids and their corresponding salts, polyamino acids and their corresponding salts, sugar acids and their corresponding salts, nucleotides, organic acids, inorganic acids, organic salts including organic acid salts and organic base salts, inorganic salts, bitter compounds, fiavorants and flavoring ingredients, astringent compounds, proteins or protein hydrolysates, surfactants, emulsifiers, flavonoids, alcohols, polymers, other sweet taste improving taste additives imparting such sugar-like characteristics, and combinations thereof.<br>
In one embodiment, a single sweet taste improving composition may be used in combination with a single natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener. In another embodiment of the present invention, a single sweet taste improving composition may be used in combination with one or more natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweeteners. In yet another embodiment, one or more sweet taste improving compositions may be used in combination with a single natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener. In a further embodiment, there may be a plurality of sweet taste improving combinations used in combination with one or more natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweeteners.<br>
In a particular embodiment, combinations of at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener and at least one sweet taste improving composition suppress, reduce, or eliminate undesirable taste and impart sugar-like characteristics to the sweetener. As used herein, the phrase "undesirable taste" includes any taste property which is not imparted by sugars, e.g. glucose, sucrose, fructose, or similar saccharides. Non-limiting examples of undesirable tastes include delayed sweetness onset, lingering sweet aftertaste, metallic taste, bitter taste, cooling sensation taste or menthol-like taste, licorice-like taste, and/or the like.<br>
In one embodiment, a sweetener composition exhibits a more sugar-like temporal and/or sugar-like flavor profile than a sweetener composition comprising at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, but without a sweet taste improving composition is provided. As used herein, the phrases "sugar-like characteristic," "sugarlike taste," "sugar-like sweet," "sugary," and "sugar-like" are synonymous.   Sugar-like<br><br>
characteristics include any characteristic similar to that of sucrose and include, but are not limited to, maximal response, flavor profile, temporal profile, adaptation behavior, mouthfeel, concentration/response function behavior, tastant and flavor/sweet taste interactions, spatial pattern selectivity, and temperature effects. These characteristics are dimensions in which the taste of sucrose is different from the tastes of natural and synthetic high-potency sweeteners. Whether or not a characteristic is more sugar-like is determined by expert sensory panel assessments of sugar and compositions comprising at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, both with and without a sweet taste improving composition. Such assessments quantify similarities of the characteristics of compositions comprising at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, both with and without a sweet taste improving composition, with those comprising sugar. Suitable procedures for determining whether a composition has a more sugar-like taste are well known in the art.<br>
In a particular embodiment, a panel of assessors is used to measure the reduction of sweetness linger. Briefly described, a panel of assessors (generally 8 to 12 individuals) is trained to evaluate sweetness perception and measure sweetness at several time points from when the sample is initially taken into the mouth until 3 minutes after it has been expectorated. Using statistical analysis, the results are compared between samples containing additives and samples that do not contain additives. A decrease in score for a time point measured after the sample has cleared the mouth indicates there has been a reduction in sweetness perception.<br>
The panel of assessors may be trained using procedures well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In a particular embodiment, the panel of assessors may be trained using the Spectrumâ„¢ Descriptive Analysis Method (Meilgaard et al, Sensory Evaluation Techniques, 3rd edition, Chapter 11). Desirably, the focus of training should be the recognition of and the measure of the basic tastes; specifically, sweet. In order to ensure accuracy and reproducibility of results, each assessor should repeat the measure of the reduction of sweetness linger about three to about five times per sample, taking at least a five minute break between each repetition and/or sample and rinsing well with water to clear the mouth.<br><br>
Generally, the method of measuring sweetness comprises taking a lOmL sample into the mouth, holding the sample in the mouth for 5 seconds and gently swirling the sample in the mouth, rating the sweetness intensity perceived at 5 seconds, expectorating the sample (without swallowing following expectorating the sample), rinsing with one mouthful of water (e.g., vigorously moving water in mouth as if with mouth wash) and expectorating the rinse water, rating the sweetness intensity perceived immediately upon expectorating the rinse water, waiting 45 seconds and, while wating those 45 seconds, identifying the time of maximum perceived sweetness intensity and rating the sweetness intensity at that time (moving the mouth normally and swallowing as needed), rating the sweetness intensity after another 10 seconds, rating the sweetness intensity after another 60 seconds (cumulative 120 seconds after rinse), and rating the sweetness intensity after still another 60 seconds (cumulative 180 seconds after rinse). Between samples take a 5 minute break, rinsing well with water to clear the mouth.<br>

Thus, any salt forms which may be derived from the sweet taste improving compositions may be used with the embodiments of the present invention as long as the salts of the sweet taste improving additives do not adversely affect the taste of the at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweeteners or the orally ingestible compositions comprising the at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener. The salt forms of the additives can be added to the natural and/or synthetic sweetener composition in the same amounts as their acid or base forms.<br>
In particular embodiments, suitable sweet taste improving inorganic salts useful as sweet taste improving additives include, but are not limited to, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium sulfate, potassium citrate, europium chloride (EuCU), gadolinium chloride  (GdCl3),  terbium  chloride  (TbCb),  magnesium  sulfate,  alum,  magnesium<br><br>
chloride, mono-, di-, tri-basic sodium or potassium salts of phosphoric acid (e.g., inorganic phosphates), salts of hydrochloric acid (e.g., inorganic chlorides), sodium carbonate, sodium bisulfate, and sodium bicarbonate. Furthermore, in particular embodiments, suitable organic salts useful as sweet taste improving additives include, but are not limited to, choline chloride, alginic acid sodium salt (sodium alginate), glucoheptonic acid sodium salt, gluconic acid sodium salt (sodium gluconate), gluconic acid potassium salt (potassium gluconate), guanidine HC1, glucosamine HC1, amiloride HC1, monosodium glutamate (MSG), adenosine monophosphate salt, magnesium gluconate, potassium tartrate (monohydrate), and sodium tartrate (dihydrate).<br>
It has been discovered that combinations of at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener and at least one sweet taste improving composition improve the temporal profile and/or flavor profile, including the osmotic taste, to be more sugar-like. One of ordinary skill in the art, with the teachings of the present invention, may arrive at all the possible combinations of natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweeteners and sweet taste improving compositions. For example, non-limiting combinations of the natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener and sweet taste improving compositions include:<br>
1.	at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener and at least one carbohydrate;<br>
2.	at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener and at least one polyol;<br>

15.	at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, at least one carbohydrate, at least one amino acid, and at least one other sweet taste improving additive.<br>
These fifteen major combinations further may be broken down into further combinations in order to improve the overall taste of the natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener or the orally ingestible compositions comprising the natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener.<br>

In accordance with particular embodiments, non-limiting examples include powder form, granular form, packets, tablets, sachets, pellets, cubes, solids, and liquids.<br>
In an embodiment, a tabletop functional sweetener composition comprises a single-serving (portion control) packet comprising a dry-blend of a functional sweetener formulation.    Dry-blend formulations generally may comprise powder or granules.<br><br>
Although the tabletop functional sweetener packet may be of any size, an illustrative non-limiting example of conventional portion control tabletop sweetener packets are approximately 2.5 by 1.5 inches and hold approximately 1 gram of a sweetener composition having a sweetness equivalent to 2 teaspoons of granulated sugar (~ 8 g). The amount of natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener in a dry-blend tabletop functional sweetener formulation will vary due to the varying potency of different natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweeteners. In a particular embodiment, a dry-blend tabletop functional sweetener formulation may comprise a natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener in an amount from about 1 % (w/w) to about 10 % (w/w) of the tabletop functional sweetener composition.<br>
Solid tabletop functional sweetener embodiments include cubes and tablets. A non-limiting example of conventional cubes are equivalent in size to a standard cube of granulated sugar, which is approximately 2.2 x 2.2 x 2.2 cm3 and weigh approximately 8 g. In one embodiment, a solid tabletop sweetener is in the form of a tablet or any other form known to those skilled in the art.<br>
A tabletop functional sweetener composition may also be embodied in the form of a liquid, wherein the NHPS is combined with a liquid carrier.    Suitable non-limiting examples of carrier agents for liquid tabletop functional sweeteners include water, alcohol, polyol, glycerin base or citric acid base dissolved in water, and mixtures thereof. Due to the varying potencies of the different high-potency sweeteners, the amount of high-potency sweetener in a liquid tabletop functional sweetener formulation will also vary. The sweetness equivalent of a tabletop functional sweetener composition for any of the forms described herein or known in the art may be varied to obtain a desired sweetness profile.    For example, a tabletop functional sweetener composition may comprise a sweetness comparable to that of an equivalent amount of standard sugar.   In another embodiment, the tabletop functional sweetener composition may comprise a sweetness of up to 100 times that of an equivalent amount of sugar.   In another embodiment, the tabletop functional sweetener composition may comprise a sweetness of up to 90 times, 80 times, 70 times, 60 times, 50 times, 40 times, 30 times, 20 times, 10 times, 9 times, 8 times, 7 times, 6 times, 5 times, 4 times, 3 times, and 2 times that of an equivalent amount of sugar.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the tabletop functional sweetener composition may also be formulated for targeted uses, for example, in beverage, food, pharmaceutical, cosmetics, herbal/vitamins, tobacco, and in any other products which may be sweetened. For example, a tabletop functional sweetener composition for baking may be formulated having additional protecting agents such as encapsulants. Other forms will be readily apparent to those skilled in the tabletop sweetener art.<br>
Commonly used methods for making powder or granulated functional sweetener formulations for packets include fluid bed agglomeration processes. Other methods for making tabletop sweetener compositions are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Those skilled in the art appreciate that the amount of natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener and amount and types of sweet taste improving composition, bulking agent, and/or anti-caking agent can be modified in order to tailor the taste of the tabletop sweetener composition to a desired profile and end use.<br>
Specific embodiments of tabletop sweetener compositions and methods of making tabletop functional sweetener compositions are disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/805,209, filed on June 19, 2006, by DuBois, et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>

Example F<br>
A solution of rebaudioside A ( &gt;97% pure by HPLC ) was prepared in double distilled water (12.5 gm in 50 mL, 25 % concentration) by stirring the mixture at 40Â°C for 5 minutes. An amorphous rebaudioside A polymorph was formed by immediately using<br><br>
the clear solution for spray drying with the Lab-Plant spray drier SD-04 instrument (Lab-Plant Ltd., West Yorkshire, U.K.). The solution was fed through the feed pump into the nozzle atomizer which atomized it into a spray of droplets with the help of a constant flow of nitrogen / air. Moisture was evaporated from the droplets under controlled temperature conditions (about 90 to about 97Â°C) and airflow conditions in the drying chamber and resulted in the formation of dry particles. This dry powder (11-12 g, H20 6.74 %) was discharged continuously from the drying chamber and was collected in a bottle. The solubility in water at room temperature was determined to be &gt; 35.0 %.<br>
Example Set G<br>
Sensory evaluation of the samples prepared in Example Set G was carried out under the following protocol, similar to that described hereinabove. In this test protocol, none of the samples were swallowed. All samples were expectorated and the mouth was rinsed with water after the tasting. Immediately upon sensing maximal sweetness, the sample was expectorated, the mouth was rinsed with water and the rate of sweetness decay ("Sweetness Linger") was measured, where attention was focused on the sweetness 3-4 min after the water rinse. After sample tasting was complete, a salty oyster cracker was chewed followed by a water rinse, and at least 5 minutes followed before tasting the next sample. The sweetness linger was rated by a panel of experts in the sensory evaluation of foods and beverages using the following scale: 0 = no sweetness linger, 1 = very slight sweetness linger, 2 = slight sweetness linger, 3 = moderate sweetness linger, 4 = moderately high sweetness linger, 5 = high sweetness linger.<br>
The "Sweetness Linger" rating for sucrose observed by this protocol is defined as 0. The Sweetness Linger of a 500 ppm of REBA control sample is defined as 5. Experimental samples were tasted by the same protocol, always allowing sufficient time between samples to ensure re-equilibration of the sensory system. Re-tasting of control samples during the course of the experiment was allowed and encouraged.<br>
The comparison taste test was performed between two controls and addition of sweet taste improving additive on the onset and/or sweetness linger.<br><br>
Control Samples<br>
REBA is a natural non-caloric sweetener with a very clean flavor profile (i.e., only sweet) and an acceptable sweetness onset rate but with a sweetness which lingers quite noticeably more than that of carbohydrate sweeteners.<br>
The effects of formulation change on the sweetness linger of 400 ppm REBA (equivalent to 8 g sucrose) in a citric acid/potassium citrate composition equivalent to that in a diet lemon-lime beverage were evaluated. The sweetness linger rating of this solution was determined to be 5.<br>
8 g of sugar was dissolved in 100 ml of citrate buffer. The sweetness linger rating of this control sample was determined to be 0.<br>
