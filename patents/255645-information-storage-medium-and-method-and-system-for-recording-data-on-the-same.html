Description<br>
INFORMATION STORAGE MEDIUM AND METHOD AND<br>
SYSTEM FOR RECORDING DATA ON THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]		The present invention relates to an information storage medium and a method and a<br>
system recording data on the same, and more particularly, to an information storage<br>
medium, which includes a plurality of recording layers having a layout structure of a<br>
lead-in area, a lead-out area, and a user data area to improve a recording speed and<br>
recording performance, and a method and a system recording data, on the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]		In general, an information storage medium is used in relation to a non-contact type<br>
optical pickup device for recording/reproducing data. A type of optical disk as an<br>
example of the information storage medium is divided into a compact disk (CD) or a<br>
digital versatile disk (DVD) based on the information recording capacity. In addition,<br>
examples of an erasable optical disk include 650 MB CD-R, CD-RW, and 4.7 GB<br>
DVD+RW. Furthermore, an HD-DVD having a recording capacity of 20 GB is being<br>
developed.<br>
[3]		In order to increase the recording capacity, a shorter wavelength is used as a<br>
recording light source, and the numerical aperture of an object lens is increased. In<br>
addition, a plurality of information recording layers are used. US Patent No, 5,881,032<br>
issued on March 9, 1999 discloses a DVD-ROM having a plurality of information<br>
recording layers.<br>
[4]		A sector address structure of a disk having dual information recording layers is<br>
shown in FIG. 1 A. The disk in FIG. 1A has a first information recordicg layer L1 and a<br>
second information recording, layer L2 that have lead-in areas la and 2a and lead-out<br>
areas lb and 2b, respectively. ON the first information recording layer L1, a first sector<br>
address X is increased in a direction from an inner perimeter Rin of the disk to an outer<br>
perimeter Rout of the disk. On the second information recording layer L2, a second<br>
sector address X is increased in a direction from the outer perimeter Rout to the inner<br>
perimeter Rin of the disk.<br>
[5]		On the other hand, a multi -layered optical disk having more than two information<br>
recording layers can he divided into an opposite track path (OTP) and a parallel track<br>
path (PTP) based on directions of recording/reproducing data on/from the disk- The<br>
OTP reproduces data from the fust information recording layer L1 in a direction from<br>
the inner perimeter Rin to the outer perimeter Rout and reproduces data from the<br>
second information recording layer L2 in a direction from the outer perimeter Rout to<br><br>
WO2005/083690	3	PCT/KR2005/000512<br>
the inner perimeter Rin, as shown in FIG. 1B. In other words, the. track spiral<br>
directions of the OTP optical disk, are alternately formed on each of the information<br>
recording layers. In addition, FIG. 1C denotes an OTP multi-layered optical disk<br>
having first through fourth information recording layers L1, L2, L3, and L4. In the<br>
OTP multi-layered optical disk, first through fourth lead-in areas la, 2a, 3a, and 4a and<br>
first through fourth lead-out areas lb, 2b, 3b, and 4h are alternately formed at the inner<br>
perimeter regions and the outer perimeter regions of the first through fourth in-<br>
formation recording layers Ll, L2, L3, and L4 of the disk, respectively. The data is<br>
reproduced from the first information recording layer Ll in the direction from the inner<br>
perimeter Rin to the outer perimeter Rout, from the second information recording layer<br>
L2 in the direction from the outer perimeter Rout to the inner perimeter Rio, from the<br>
third information recording layer L3 in the direction from the inner perimeter Rin to<br>
the cater perimeter Rout, and from the fourtti information recording layer L4 in the<br>
direction from the outer perimeter Rout to the inner perimeter Rin<br>
[6]		FIG. 2 denotes a PTP dual-layered optical disk having a first information recording<br>
layer Ll from which data is reproduced in a direction from an inoer perimeter Rin to<br>
an outer perimeter Rout and a second information recording layer L2 from which data<br>
is reproduced in a direction from the inner perimeter Rin to the outer perimeter Rout.<br>
In other words, track spiral directions of the information recording layers are the same.<br>
A first lead-in area la is formed at the inner perimeter portion of the first information<br>
recording layer L1, a first lead-out area lb is formed at the outer perimeter portion of<br>
the first information recording layer Ll, a second lead-in area 2a is formed at the inner<br>
perimeter portion of the second information recording layer L2, and a second lead-out<br>
area 2b is formed at the outer perimeter portion of the second informatioa recording<br>
layer L2.<br>
[7]		In the case of a multi-layered recordable disk, the lead-in areas la, 2a, 3a, and 4a<br>
and the lead-out areas 1b, 2b, 3b, and 4b include information about the disk and<br>
various conditions about recording. Accordingly, user data can be properly recorded<br>
and reproduced when reproducing the user data from the lead-in areas 1a, 2a, 3a, and<br>
a and the lead-out areas lb. 2b, 3b, and 4b.<br>
[8]		When the amount of the data to be recorded on the multi-layered information<br>
storage medium is smaller than the capacity of the information recording layers, there<br>
is an empty area on at least one information recording layer.<br>
[9]		A method of processing the empty area of the information recording layer should<br>
be determined, for various information storage, media. FIG. 3 A illustrates a single-<br>
layered recordable information storage medium, and FIG. 3B illustrates a dual layered<br>
recordable information storage medium. The locations aod the capacities of lead-in<br>
areas, lead-out areas, and user data areas are fixed.<br><br>
WO2005/083690	4	PCT/KR2005/000512<br>
[10]		On the other hand, the data may be recorded on the entire area of the data area of<br>
the first information recording layer L1 and on a portion of the data area of the second<br>
information recording layer L2, as shown in FIG. 4. When a beam passes through the<br>
first information recording layer L1 and the second information recording layer L2, the<br>
beam may pass through a portion L1R of the first information recording layer L1 on<br>
which the data is recorded and a portion L2N of the second information recording layer<br>
L2 on which the data is not recorded, or the beam may pass through portions L1R and<br>
L2R of the first and second information recording layers L1 and L2 on which the data<br>
is recorded. Thus, when the reproducing conditions of the areas through which the<br>
beam passes are different, a reproducing characteristic may be affected.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[11]		As described above, when determining the layout of an information storage<br>
medium, the consistency and unity with the information storage medium of a particular<br>
type should be considered and the reproducing performance of a multi-layered in-<br>
formation storage medium should be considered. In addition, it is important to improve<br>
a recording speed according to the increase of a recording capacity.<br>
[12]		For example, a convenlsonal recordable DVD has a single information recording<br>
layer and a capacity of 4.7 GB. On the other hand, a conventional DVD-ROM has a<br>
capacity of 8.5 GB and dual information recording layers. However, in order to back<br>
up the data from a DVD-ROM having a capacity of 8.5 GB, a recordable DVD having<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
[33]		Reference will now be made in dertail to the embodiments of the present invention,<br>
examples of which arc illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like<br>
reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout. The embodiments are<br>
described below to explain the present invention by referring to the figures.<br>
[34]		An information storage medium according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention has a plurality of information recording layers. Referring to FIG. 5A, each of<br>
the information recording layers includes a data area on which user data is recorded,<br>
and a lead-in area and a lead-out area that are arranged at an inner perimeter and an<br>
outer perimeter of the data area, respectively.<br>
[35]		The information storage medium according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention may be applied to a recordable information storage medium, and more e-f-<br>
ficiently, to a recordable information storage medium on which the amount of data, to<br>
be recorded is determined before recording data.<br>
[36]		When an information storage medium includes a plurality of information recording<br>
layers, the amount of data to be recorded is divided into the number of the information<br>
recording layers in order to record the same amount of data on each of the information<br>
recording layers. In other words, the capacities and the locations of ihe data areas and<br><br>
WO2005/083690	7	PCT/KR2005/000512<br>
	the lead-out areas may vary according to the amount of the data to be recorded.<br>
[37]			FIG. 5A illustrates an opposite track path (OTP) dual layer information storage<br>
medium, and FIG. 5B illustrates a parallel track path (FTP) dual layer information<br>
storage medium. Referring to FIG. 5 A, the dual layer information storage medium<br>
includes a first information recording layer L1 and a second information recording<br>
layer L2, and the information recording layers LI and L2 include lead-in areas 20-L1<br>
and 20-L2, data areas 30-L1 and 30-L2, and lead-out areas 40-L1 and 40-L2, re-<br>
spectively. In addition, when the amount of data to be recorded is predetermined, the<br>
amount of data is divided into halves and each half is allotted to the data areas 30-L1<br>
and 30-L2, respectively. The reference character C denotes the maximum of the user<br>
data to be recorded.<br>
[38]		In addition, the lead-out areas 40-L1 and 40-L2 are arranged at the outer perimeters<br>
of the data areas 30-LI and 30-L2 of the information recording layers to record the<br>
data in a pattern having a lead-out property. Thus, a location of the lead-out areas<br>
40-L1 and 40-L2 varies depending on the amount of data recorded.<br>
[39]		In this case, the lead-in area and the lead-out area that are located in the middle in a<br>
data recording direction may be referred to as a middle area or a connection area. In<br>
other words, the lead-out area 40-L1 of the first information recording layer L1 and the<br>
lead-out area 40-L2 of the second information recording layer L2 in FIG. 5 A, and the<br>
lead-out area 40-Ll of the first information recording layer L1 and the lead-in area<br>
20-L2 of the second information recording layer L2 may be referred to as the middle<br>
areas or the connection areas.<br>
[40]		On the other hand, an information storage medium according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention includes a dedicated area for use by a recording and/or re-<br>
producing apparatus (hereinafter referred to as a drive) in order for the drive to read<br>
recording inforrmation before recording user data. The dedicated area, may include., for<br>
example, a test area for performing a lest for detecting an optimum recording power of<br>
a recording medium and/or an area of recording information about recording histories<br>
of the drive.<br>
[41]		However, the test in the drive is performed before recording the user data, thus it is<br>
impossible to recognize the amount of data to be recorded. Therefore, the drive cannot<br>
determine the location of performing the test. As a result, the location of a test area<br>
should be fixed.<br>
[42]		Referring to FIGS. 5A and 5B, dedicated areas for use by a drive, for example, test<br>
areas 45-L1 and 45-L2 may be fixed at the outmost perimeter of the information<br>
recording layers L1 and L2. When an information storage medium is loaded in the<br>
drive, the drive performs tests using the test areas 45-L1 and 45-L2 and records data.<br>
Thereafter, the drive records the pattern having the lead-out property at the outer<br><br>
WO2005/083690	8	PCT/KR2005/000512<br>
perimeter of data areas 30-L1 and 30-L2. which are set depending on the size of the<br>
data to be recorded. The lead-out property is a data pattern to prohibit a pickup from<br>
separating from an information storage medium.<br>
[43]		In the case where an empty area exists in the test areas 40-L1 and 40-L2 when the<br>
recording of the pattern having the lead-out property is finished, the areas 43-Ll and<br>
43-L2 between the lead-out areas 40-L1 and 40-L2 and the test areas 45-L1 and 45-L2.<br>
respectively, remain empty. Since the empty areas 43-Ll and 43-L2 are present, a<br>
recording time cart be reduced compared to a case where the pattern having the lead-<br>
out property is recorded at the outmost perimeter of a recording medium. In addition,<br>
in order to efficiently move a pickup between recording layers, the recording may be<br>
performed according to an OTP type.<br>
[44]		FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate an OTP multi-layered information storage medium and<br>
a PTP multi-layered information storage medium including first through fourth in-<br>
formation recording layers Ll, L2, L3, and L4, respectively.<br>
[45]		The first through fourth information recording layers L1, L2, L3, and L4 include<br>
lead-in areas 20-L1, 20-L2, 20-L3. and 20-L4, data areas 30-H, 30-L2, 30-L3, and<br>
30-L4. lead-out areas 40-L1,40-L2,40-L3, and 40-L4, and dedicated areas for a drive<br>
45-L1,45-L2,45-L3, and 45-L4, respectively.<br>
[46]		The amount of data, to be recorded is divided to be approximately equally<br>
distributed among the data areas 30-L1,30-L2, 30-L3, and 30-L4 each having the same<br>
capacity thai are formed on the first through fourth information recording layers L1,<br>
L2, L3, and L4, respectively. In addition, the lead-out areas 40-L1, 40-L2,40-L3, and<br>
40-L4 are arranged following the data areas 30-Ll, 30-L2, 30-L3, and 30-L4 on which<br>
the user data is recorded. The reference character C designates a maximum amount of<br>
user data that may be recorded. The pattern having a lead-out property is recorded on<br>
the lead-out areas 40-L1, 40-L2, 40-L3, and 40-L4.<br>
[47]		The dedicated areas 45-L1, 45-L2, 45-L3, and 45-L4 may be arranged at the<br>
outmost perimeter of the information recording layers L1, L2, L3, and L4. When areas<br>
remain between the lead-out areas 40-L1, 40-L2, 40-L3, and 40-L4 and the dedicated<br>
areas 45-L1, 45-L2, 45-L3, and 45-L4, these areas are empty 43-Ll, 43-L2, 43-L3 and<br>
43-L4.<br>
[48]		FIG. 7 illustrates a system recording/reproducing data on/from an information<br>
storage medium according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[49]			A system recording/reproducing data includes a pickup unit 50, a recording/re-<br>
producing signal process unit 60, and a control unit 70. More specifically, the system<br>
includes a laser diode 51 of radiating a beam, a collimating lens 52 of collimating the<br>
beam radiated from the laser diode 51, a beam splitter 54 of converting the path of the<br>
incidence beam, and an objective lens 56 of concentrating the beam from the beam<br><br>
WO2005/083690	9	PCT/KR2005/000512<br>
splitter 54 on an information storage medium D.<br>
[50]		The beam reflected from the information storage medium D is reflected on the<br>
beam splitter 54 and received by an optical detector, for example, a quadrant optical<br>
detector 57. The beam received by the optical detector 57 is converted into electric<br>
signals by passing through an operation circuit unit 58 and output as RF signals, In<br>
other words, channel Ch1 detects a sum of signals and differential signal channel Ch2<br>
detects push-pull signals.<br>
[51]		Referring to FIG. 5A, by way of example, the control unit 70 performs a test in test<br>
areas 45-L1 and 45-L2 of the information storage medium D before recording data on<br>
the information storage medium D. In addition, the control unit 70 records ap-<br>
proximately the same amount of user data on each of the information recording layers<br>
L1 and L2 of the informaiion storage medium D. The control unit 70 controls the<br>
pickup unit 50 to radiate a recording beam of a proper power, which is obtained by the<br>
test, to record. the user data on the information storage. medium D. When, the recording,<br>
of the user daia is finished, the pattern of a lead-out property is recorded in at least one<br>
of the lead-out areas 40-L1 or 40-L2.<br>
[52]		In addition, when areas 43-L1 and 43-L2 remain between the data areas and the<br>
test areas 45-L1 and 45-L2, the control unit 70 finishes the recording without recording<br>
data on the areas 43-L1 and 43-L2 (i.e., the areas are left empty).<br>
[53]		In order to reproduce the data from the information storage medium D, a beam<br>
reflected from, the information storage medium D is input to the optical detector 57 by<br>
passing through the objective lens 56 and the beam splitter 54. The signals input to the<br>
optical detector 57 are converted into electric signals by the operation circuit unit 58<br>
and output as RF signals.<br>
[54]		A method of recording data according to aspects of the present invention<br>
recognizes the amount of data to be recorded on an information storage medium when<br>
the information storage medium is loaded on a drive, and performs a test on a<br>
dedicated, area for the drive, for example, a test area of the information storage<br>
medium. Thereafter, the amount of the data is divided to allot data areas having ap-<br>
proximately the same amount on each of information recording layers. Then, the data<br>
is recorded based on the allotted amount of data, and the data having a lead-out<br>
property is recorded following the data areas on the information recording layers.<br>
[55]		On the other hand, when areas remain between the lead-out areas and the dedicated<br>
areas for the drive, these areas are empty.<br><br>
