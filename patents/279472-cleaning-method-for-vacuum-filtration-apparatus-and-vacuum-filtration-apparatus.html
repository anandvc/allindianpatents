				<td>CLEANING METHOD FOR VACUUM FILTRATION APPARATUS AND VACUUM FILTRATION APPARATUS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No 2004-275815, filed September 22,2004, the contents of which are incorporated herem by reference<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a cleaning method for a vacuum filtration apparatus and a vacuum filtration apparatus which filters slurry provided on a filtering cloth running m a substantially honzontal direction, by performing vacuum suction of the slurry using a vacuum tray disposed under the filtenng cloth<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
Refinement operations have been performed which, by performing filtenng operations, separate mother liquor from slurry and extract crystal components, or punfy the crystal components    For example, when extracting crystal components of an organic matter dissolved in a solvent by separating the crystal components from the mother liquor, conventionally, such extraction has been performed using a centnfuge, a contmuous-type filtering machine, or honzontal tray filters, etc    In such a case, liquid is cooled when contacting and passing through a cake layer and a filtenng cloth, due to reasons such as (l) the liquid contaimng the crystal components being a saturated solution, and (n) at the beginning of the filtenng operations, the filtering cloth and an upper surface section (a grid plate) of a vacuum tray both being m a room temperature<br>
condition which is generally lower than operating temperatures, and the upper surface<br>
section having large heat capacity influences the thermal condition of the slurry    As a<br>
result, crystal components are recrystallized and adhere, in particular, to through holes of<br>
the filtering cloth, and through holes and leg portions of the grid plate, thereby causing<br>
clogging of the through holes and blockage of a flow path of the filtered liquid    This<br>
kind of problem occurs regardless of the type of the machine (1 e, a batch operation type<br>
or a contmuous operation type) and remarkably lowers filtering performance    As a<br>
result, crystal components having higher purity cannot be obtained and yield is lowered<br>
For these reasons, periodical cleaning of the filtering cloth and the grid plate is required,<br>
thereby causing lowered availability of the machine    This land of problem also anses in<br>
the case in which the above-mentioned mechanical filtering operations are performed for<br>
purifying eutectic slurries or crystal components of solid solutions<br>
In the case in which the temperature difference between the dissolution temperature of the crystals of organic matter dissolved in the solvent and the crystal extraction temperature is less than 10 C, or in the case in which crystal components having a dissolution temperature of equal to or less than 30 C are recrystallized by separating it from mother liquor, the above-mentioned problem can be solved by utilizmg a special filtering apparatus such as the one disclosed m Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No H02-126902    However, in order to extract crystal components having temperature conditions beyond the above using the above-mentioned apparatus, the apparatus needs to be modified correspondingly    As a result, problems arise, in which the structure of the apparatus becomes complex and thereby the construction cost thereof increases<br>
In order to solve the problems explained above, for example, Japanese Patent No 3,497,206 discloses a cleaning method for a vacuum filtration apparatus, in which liquid<br>
containing crystal components is separated via a filtering cloth into the crystal<br>
components and mother liquor by vacuum trays disposed under the filtering cloth    In<br>
this cleaning method, in some of the vacuum trays, crystals adhered to the underside of<br>
the filtering cloth are collected by dissolving them by supplying a tray cleaning liquid on<br>
the underside of the filtering cloth and filling the vacuum trays with it    On the other<br>
hand, the other vacuum trays are operated as a vacuum tray for forming a cake, a vacuum<br>
tray for washing a cake, and vacuum tray for drying a cake, and the same kind of<br>
cleaning operations are performed for each of these vacuum trays<br>
However, when extracting the crystal components of the organic matter<br>
dissolved in the solvent by separating it from the mother liquor as explained above m the<br>
above-mentioned vacuum filtration apparatus, all of the plural vacuum trays are normally<br>
accommodated in a gastight room and are thus shielded from the outside    In this case,<br>
smce the vacuum trays are enclosed in the gastight room, it is difficult to confirm the<br>
status of the crystals adhered onto the grid plate and the filtering cloth    Therefore,<br>
timing for supplying the tray cleaning liquid to the underside of the filtering cloth has to<br>
be set to the time after which operating time determined in advance has passed<br>
However, in this case, although the tray cleaning liquid is supplied every time at the same<br>
timing, there are cases in which the amounts of crystals adhered onto the filtering cloth<br>
change dependmg on, for example, fluctuations of operating status etc of the vacuum<br>
filtration apparatus    Accordingly, there are cases m which the grid plate is cleaned<br>
although it does not need cleaning, or conversely, the grid plate is not cleaned although it<br>
needs cleaning    That is, there is a problem in that it is difficult to perform cleaning at a<br>
good timing    If the timing for the cleaning is late, then filtering performance of the<br>
vacuum filtration apparatus will be lowered and inadequate cleaning or inadequate<br>
drying will happen, thereby causing deterioration in the product quality    On the other<br>
 hand, if the timing for the cleaning is too early, then the tray cleaning liquid will be<br>
wasted<br>
The present invention was made in view of the above circumstances and an<br>
object thereof is to provide a cleaning method for a vacuum filtration apparatus, and a<br>
vacuum filtration apparatus, both of which can smoothly remove crystals deposited on<br>
and adhered to a filtenng cloth and a grid plate at a good timing, thereby preventing<br>
cloggmg of through holes and blockage of a flow path for the filtered liquid<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to achieve the above object, the present invention provides a cleaning method for a vacuum filtration apparatus including a filtering cloth for carrymg a slurry and running m a substantially horizontal direction, a vacuum tray disposed under the filtenng cloth, a vacuum line connected to the vacuum tray, a vacuum suction device for performing vacuum suction of the slurry via the vacuum line, the vacuum tray, and the filtenng cloth, and a cleaning liquid supply device for supplymg a cleaning liquid to the vacuum tray    The cleaning method mcludes measuring a vacuum pressure m the vacuum line, and cleaning the vacuum tray based on the vacuum pressure<br>
In addition, in order to achieve the above object, the present invention also provides a vacuum filtration apparatus including a filtenng cloth for carrying a slurry and running m a substantially honzontal direction, a vacuum tray disposed under the filtenng cloth, a vacuum line connected to the vacuum tray, a vacuum suction device for performing vacuum suction of the slurry via the vacuum line, the vacuum tray, and the filtenng cloth, a cleaning liquid supply device for supplying a cleaning liquid to the vacuum tray, a vacuum pressure measunng device for measunng a vacuum pressure m the vacuum line, and a control device for making the cleaning liquid supply device<br>
 <br>
supply the cleamng liquid to the vacuum tray for cleaning the vacuum tray based on the<br>
vacuum pressure<br>
According to either one of the cleaning method for a vacuum filtration apparatus and the vacuum filtration apparatus of the present invention, timmg for supplymg cleaning liquid to the vacuum tray is determined based on the vacuum pressure in the vacuum line    Thus, it becomes possible to confirm the amount of the crystal components of the slurry deposited and adhered onto a grid plate of the vacuum tray etc, regardless of fluctuations of operating status etc, of the vacuum filtration apparatus, and therefore, cleamng of the grid plate etc, can be performed at a good timing    That is, the vacuum pressure will mcrease if the amount of the crystal components deposited on the grid plate etc, is large, while the vacuum pressure will decrease if the amount of the crystal components deposited on the grid plate etc, is small    Thus, it can be arranged such that cleamng for the vacuum tray is performed when the vacuum pressure becomes higher than a predetermined value such as -40 kPaG    By domg this, deterioration of product quality caused by insufficient cleaning or insufficient drying, and wasting of the cleamng liquid can be prevented<br>
Accordingly, since crystals deposited on the filtering cloth and the grid plate etc, can smoothly be removed at a good timing, clogging of through holes and blockage of a flow path of the filtered liquid can be prevented<br>
A plurality of the vacuum trays and corresponding vacuum lines may be provided along a running direction of the filtering cloth, and referring to the vacuum pressure in at least one of the vacuum lines, cleamng of the vacuum tray connected to the vacuum line to whose vacuum pressure referral is made may be performed Alternatively, a plurality of said vacuum trays and corresponding vacuum lines may be provided along a running direction of the filtering cloth, the vacuum pressures in each of<br>
the vacuum lines may be measured, and only the vacuum tray in which the vacuum<br>
pressure exceeds a predetermined value may be cleaned<br>
In these cases, it becomes possible to avoid cleaning of vacuum tray which does not need cleaning at the time, thereby preventing waste of cleaning liquid Accordingly, high-efficiency cleaning can be realized<br>
It may be arranged such that the vacuum tray is cleaned while the cleaning liquid is supplied such that the cleaning liquid overflows from the vacuum tray<br>
For example, if the cleaning liquid does not overflow from the vacuum tray and maintains a liquid-level of a predetermined height m the vacuum tray, there is a possibility that a liquid-surface portion of the cleaning liquid will cool through the cleaning processes, thereby resulting in temperature drop    Therefore, there is a possibility that crystal components dissolved in the liquid-surface portion of the cleaning liquid will be recrystalhzed and deposited onto a wall surface of the vacuum tray contacting the liquid-surface portion<br>
In contrast, according to the present mvention, since the cleaning liquid is supplied such that it overflows from the vacuum tray, a standing fluid body will not be formed    Accordingly, it becomes possible (1) to prevent recrystalhzation of the crystal components on the wall of the vacuum tray, (u) to prevent temperature drop of the cleaning liquid in the vacuum tray, and (in) to accelerate dissolution of the crystal components deposited onto the grid plate etc , into the cleaning liquid    As a result, insufficient cleaning can be prevented<br>
Furthermore, by raising the height of the liquid surface of the cleaning liquid by making it overflow from the vacuum tray, close to the underside of the filtering cloth, not only the gnd plate but also the lower surface of the filtenng cloth can be immersed in the cleaning liquid    As a result, the crystal components of the slurry deposited onto the<br>
ower surface of the cleaning cloth can be cleaned and removed<br>
The cleaning method for a vacuum filtration apparatus may further include maintaining a temperature of the cleamng liquid higher than a recrystallization temperature of a crystal component contained in the slurry    Alternatively, the vacuum tray may include a vacuum tray for forming a cake, a vacuum tray for washing a cake, and a vacuum tray for drying a cake, each arranged along a running direction of the filtenng cloth, and the vacuum pressure measunng device and the cleamng liquid supply device may be provided at least for the vacuum line connected to the vacuum tray for drying a cake<br>
At the vacuum tray for drying a cake, since the amount of mother liquor contained m the slurry is small and since the amount of a gas to be sucked is large, temperature of the filtered liquid easily drops, thereby resulting m the recrystallization of the crystal components especially onto the grid plate etc<br>
In contrast, according to the present invention, since the vacuum tray for drying a cake m which the crystal components are easily deposited is provided with the vacuum pressure measunng device and the cleamng liquid supply device, the recrystalhzed crystal components can be effectively dissolved and removed<br>
Especially, if a plurality of vacuum trays for drying a cake and corresponding vacuum lines are provided, and if a vacuum pressure measunng device and the cleamng liquid supply device are provided to each of the vacuum lines, it becomes possible to continue drying processes of the vacuum trays for drying a cake while one of the vacuum tray for drying a cake is in cleaning    As a result, it becomes possible to perform cleamng without stopping suction filtrations of the filter liquid in the vacuum filtration apparatus, thereby realizing high-efficiency cleamng operations<br>

As shown in FIG 1, the tray cleaning liquid supply device 26 is provided with an automatic valve SV8 connected to the first tray 16C for drying a cake, an automatic valve SV9 connected to the second tray 16D for drying a cake, an automatic valve SVIO connected to the first tray 16E for drying a cake, a third temperature measuring device 26 A for measuring the temperature of the tray cleaning liquid before it is supplied into the first tray 16C for drying a cake through the third tray 16E for drying a cake, a second heater 26B for heating the tray cleaning liquid, a control valve CV4 for controlling the flow rate of a heating medium supplied to the second heater 26B based on the measurement results of the third temperature measuring device 26 A, and a pump (not shown in the figures) for supplying the tray cleaning liquid to the first tray 16C for drying a cake through the third tray 16E for drying a cake, via the automatic valves SV8 to SVIO    By adopting this configuration, temperature of the tray cleaning liquid supplied to the first tray 16C for drying a cake through the third tray 16E for drying a cake via the automatic valves SV8 to SVIO, is controlled such that the temperature becomes 5 C to 10 C higher than the temperature at which crystallization of the mother liquor begins<br>
The vacuum filtration apparatus of the present embodiment is equipped with a controller which is not shown in the figures    The vacuum pressure measuring devices 27A to 27C, the automatic valves SV5 to SV7 and SV8 to SVIO, and the above-mentioned pump of the tray cleaning device 26, are connected to the controller Output signals output from the vacuum pressure measuring devices 27A to 27C are transmitted through the controller to the pump and the automatic valves SV5 to SV7 and SV8 to SVIO    That is, when the vacuum pressures measured by the vacuum measuring devices 27A to 27C are lower than a predetermined value (for example, -40 kPaG), the<br>
controller closes the automatic valves SV8 to SV10, opens the automatic valves SV5 to<br>
SV7, stops supplying the tray cleaning liquid into the first tray 16C for drying a cake to<br>
the third tray 16E for drying a cake, and supplies the filtered liquid recovered from the<br>
slurry S through the filtering section 11A into the third header pipe 24    On the other<br>
hand, when the vacuum pressures are higher than the predetermined value, the controller<br>
opens the automatic valves SV8 to SV10, closes the automatic valves SV5 to SV7, stops<br>
supplying the filtered liquid mto the third header pipe 24, and supplies the tray cleaning<br>
liquid mto the first tray 16C for drying a cake to the third tray 16E for drying a cake<br>
Based on the measurement results of the vacuum pressure measuring devices 27A to 27C, the controller opens and closes the automatic valves SV5 to SV7 and SV8 to SV10 respectively, thereby cleaning the first tray 16C for drying a cake to the third tray 16E for drying a cake respectively    That is, the automatic valve SV5 and SV8 are opened and closed based on the measurement results of the first vacuum pressure measuring device 28A, the automatic valves SV6 and SV9 are opened and closed based on the measurement results of the second vacuum pressure measuring device 28B, and the automatic valves SV7 and SV10 are opened and closed based on the measurement results of the third vacuum pressure measuring device 28C<br>
Next, the way to use the vacuum filtration apparatus having the above-mentioned configuration will be explained<br>
Firstly, in normal operation, the same as in conventional apparatuses, the slurry supply device 13 supplies the slurry S onto a position of the filtering section 11A which is above the tray 16A for forming a cake, and vacuum pressure applied onto the tray 16A for forming a cake will suck and filter the liquid in the slurry S, and thereby form a cake Subsequently, the cake layer is moved and disposed above the tray 16B for washing a cake by the filtering section 11A    Then, the cake washing device 21 will provide the<br>
cake washing liquid L onto the cake layer, thereby washing the cake    Furthermore, this<br>
cake layer is dned by carrying it sequentially from the first tray 16C for drying a cake to<br>
the third tray 16E for drying a cake    Meanwhile, the filtered liquids recovered by each<br>
of the vacuum trays 16 will pass through the header pipes 22 to 24, and will be<br>
introduced into the corresponding gas-and-hquid separation tanks 31 to 33, and thereby<br>
separated into gas and liquid<br>
Liquid levels of the filtered liquids in the gas-and-hquid separation tanks 31 to<br>
33	are continuously measured by the corresponding liquid level measurmg devices 36 to 38, and based on the measurement results, the filtered liquids in the gas-and-hquid separation tanks 31 to 33 are transferred to the arbitrary processes through the pumps 39 to 41 for filtered liquid and the automatic valves SV1 to SV3     On the other hand, since each of the gasses exhausted from the gas-and-hquid separation tanks 31 to 33 contains a little solution, the solution is thermally condensed and is removed by making the gasses pass through the cooler 35, and is subsequently returned into the second gas-and-hquid separation tanks 32    By performing this process, the gas sucked by the vacuum pump<br>
34	is made to be in a dried condition, and is subsequently returned into the gastight room R through the room temperature control line 50    At this time, since temperature of the gas needs to be maintained higher than the crystal-depositing temperature of the mother liquor, temperature in the gastight room R is regularly measured by the second temperature measuring device 52    And, corresponding to an output from the second temperature measuring device 52, the temperature of the gas is controlled by the first heater 51 and the control calve CV2, such that the temperature becomes 5°C to 20°C higher than the temperature at which the mother liquor begins crystallization    By performing this process, the temperature in the gastight room R is maintained in a constant temperature condition having a predetermined temperature<br>
In the temperature of the cake washing liquid L is also regularly measured by a<br>
fourth temperature measuring device (not shown in the figures)    In addition,<br>
corresponding to the measurement results of the fourth temperature measuring device,<br>
the temperature of the cake washing liquid L is controlled such that the temperature<br>
becomes 5°C to 10 C higher than the temperature at which the mother liquor begins<br>
crystallization    By performing this process, the temperatures of the mother liquor and<br>
the filtered liquid are maintained higher the temperature at which the mother liquor<br>
begins crystallization    As a result, it becomes possible to prevent deposition of the<br>
crystals and to obtain stable operation for many hours<br>
However, even when the vacuum filtration apparatus is operated with the above-mentioned countermeasures in order to prevent deposition of the crystals, there is a possibility that the crystal components of the slurry S will adhered to the lower surface of the filtering section 11 A, and to the grid plates 161 of the first tray 16C for drying a cake through the third tray 16E for drying a cake<br>
Hereinafter, a case in which the crystal components are stacked and adhered onto the first tray 16C for drying a cake will be explained    In this case, vacuum pressure between (l) the part of the lower face of the filtering section 11A which corresponds to the first tray 16C for drying a cake and (u) the vacuum suction device 30 rises    And, if the first vacuum pressure measuring device 27A provided on the third header pipe 24A detects that the vacuum pressure becomes higher than the predeterrmned value, then an output signal from the first vacuum pressure measuring device 27A is transmitted to the automatic valves SV8 and SV5 and the pump through the controller As a result, the automatic valve SV8 will open and the automatic valve SV5 will close Then, while vacuum suction by the first tray 16C for drying a cake is stopped, the tray cleaning liquid in which the flow rate and the temperature are controlled m advance by<br>
the tray cleaning liquid supply device 26 will be supplied into the first tray 16C for<br>
drying a cake    On the other hand, although the vacuum suction of the first tray 16C for<br>
drying a cake is stopped, vacuum suction operations by the other vacuum trays 16 (l e ,<br>
the tray 16A for forming a cake, the tray 16B for washing a cake, the first tray 16C for<br>
drying a cake, the second tray 16D for drying a cake, and the third tray 16E for drying a<br>
cake) will be continued<br>
Filtering operation is continued for a predetermined time while the tray cleaning liquid introduced mto the first tray 16C for drying a cake overflows therefrom such that the grid plate 161 is immersed in the tray cleaning liquid and such that the lower surface of the filtering section 11A is dipped in the tray cleaning liquid    Meanwhile, m accordance with the back-and-forth motions of each of the vacuum trays 16, the tray cleaning liquid will be automatically shaken, thereby performing an effective cleaning operation    Especially, smce the tray cleaning liquid is supplied such that a little of the tray cleaning liquid overflows from the first tray 16C for drying a cake, the cleaning liquid contaimng the crystal components will not keep touchmg an inner wall of the first tray 16C for drying a cake and will not be cooled    Therefore, recrystallization of the crystal components onto the inner wall can be prevented    After a predetermined time has been passed, supply of the tray cleaning liquid is stopped by closmg the automatic valve SV8, and the tray cleaning liquid is recovered as a filtered liquid by opemng the automatic valve SV5<br>
In order to clean the second tray 16D for drying a cake, the automatic valve SV6 is closed and the automatic valve S V9 is opened, and thereby a cleaning operation the same as the one mentioned above is performed    Also, in order to clean the third tray 16E for drying a cake, the automatic valve SV7 is closed and the automatic valve SV10 is opened, and thereby a cleaning operation the same as the one mentioned above will be<br>
performed<br>
As explained above, according to the vacuum filtration apparatus of the present embodiment, since timing for supplying the tray cleamng liquid into the vacuum trays 16 is determined based on the vacuum pressure in the vacuum lme 20, it becomes possible to confirm the status of the crystal components deposited and adhered onto the grid plate 161 etc, regardless of fluctuations of operating status etc, of the vacuum filtration apparatus    Accordingly, cleamng of the grid plate 161 etc, can be performed at a good timing    That is, the vacuum pressure will increase if the amount of the crystal components deposited on the grid plate 161 etc , is large, while the vacuum pressure will decrease if the amount of the crystal components deposited on the grid plate 161 etc , is small    Thus, it can be arranged such that the vacuum trays 16 are cleaned when the vacuum pressure becomes higher than a predetermined value such as -40 kPaG    By doing this, deterioration of product quality caused by insufficient cleamng or insufficient drying, and wasting of the cleaning liquid can be prevented<br>
In addition, smce the vacuum pressure in the vacuum line 20 is measured for each of the first tray 16C for drying a cake through the third tray 16E for drying a cake, and since only a vacuum tray in which the vacuum pressure exceeds the predetermined value is cleaned, it becomes possible to prevent waste of cleamng liquid and to realize high-efficiency cleamng<br>
In addition, while cleaning the first tray 16C for drying a cake, by continuing drying processes of the second tray 16D for drying a cake and the third tray 16E for drying a cake, it becomes possible to continue cleamng operations without stopping suction filtrations of the filtered liquid in the vacuum filtration apparatus, thereby realizing high-efficiency cleamng operations    Furthermore, smce suction filtration by the vacuum filtration apparatus is continued while the grid plate 161 is immersed in the<br>
tray cleamng liquid, the tray cleaning liquid will be automatically shaken, thereby<br>
realizing high-efficiency cleaning operations<br>
Furthermore, since the tray cleamng liquid is supplied into the vacuum trays 16 such that the tray cleamng liquid overflows from the vacuum trays 16, not only the grid plate 161 but also the lower face of the filtering section 11A can be dipped mto the tray cleamng liquid    As a result, the crystal components deposited and adhered both to the grid plate 161 and to the filtering section 11A can be dissolved and removed satisfactorily<br>
That is, if each of the cleamng liquids does not overflow from the vacuum trays 16 and maintains a liquid-level of a predetermined height in the vacuum trays 16, there is a possibility that each of liquid-surface portions of the cleamng liquids will be cooled through the cleamng process, thereby resultmg in temperature drop thereof    Therefore, there is a possibility that crystal components dissolved in the liquid-surface portions of the cleamng liquids will be recrystallized and deposited onto wall surfaces of the vacuum trays 16 contacting the liquid-surface portions<br>
In contrast, accordmg to the vacuum filtration apparatus of the present embodiment, smce the cleamng liquid is supplied such that it overflows from the vacuum trays 16, standing fluid body will not be formed    Accordingly, it becomes possible (I) to prevent recrystalhzation of the crystal components on the walls of the vacuum trays 16, and (u) to prevent temperature drop of the cleamng liquids in the vacuum trays 16    As a result, dissolution of the crystal components deposited on the grid plate etc , into the cleamng liquid is accelerated, and thereby insufficient cleamng can be prevented<br>
Furthermore, by raismg the height of the liquid surface of the cleamng liquid so that it overflows from the vacuum trays 16, close to the underside of the filtering section 11 A, not only the grid plate 161 but also the lower surface of the filtering section 11A can<br>
be immersed in the cleaning liquid    As a result, the crystal components of the slurry S<br>
deposited onto the lower surface of the filtering section 11A can be cleaned and removed<br>
Especially, according to the vacuum filtration apparatus of the present embodiment, since<br>
the temperature of the cleaning liquid is maintained higher than a recrystalhzation<br>
temperature of the crystal components, dissolution of the crystal components into the tray<br>
cleaning liquid can be further accelerated<br>
At the first tray 16C for drying a cake through the third tray 16E for drying a cake, since the amount of mother liquor contained in the slurry S is small and since the amount of gas to be sucked is large, the temperature of filtered liquid easily drops, thereby resultmg m the recrystalhzation of the crystal components especially onto the gnd plate 16 etc    In contrast, according to the vacuum filtration apparatus of the present mvention, since the vacuum trays 16 in which the crystal components are easily deposited are provided with the vacuum pressure measuring devices 27A to 27C and the cleaning liquid supply device 26, the recrystalhzed crystal components deposited in the vacuum filtration apparatus can be effectively dissolved and removed    In addition, according to the vacuum filtration apparatus of the present embodiment, even when one of the plurality of the first tray 16C for drying a cake through the third tray 16E for drying a cake is in cleaning, it is possible to contmue drying processes of the others, thereby enablmg realization of high-efficiency cleaning operations<br>
While a preferred embodiment of the invention has been described and illustrated above, it should be understood that this is exemplary of the invention and is not to be considered as limiting    Additions, omissions, substitutions, and other modifications can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present mvention    Accordingly, the invention is not to be considered as being limited by the foregoing description, and is only limited by the scope of the appended claims<br>
