				<td>Technical Field<br>
The invention is based on a method for manufacturing a lamp according to the followings description.  This is a method for manufacturing a lamp with a lamp vessel which has at least one open, cylindrically formed end into which an electrode system is introduced and which is subsequently sealed gastightly.<br>
Prior Art<br>
In methods previously used for manufacturing a lamp, whether incandescent or tubular fluorescent lamps, the electrode systems are introduced into the lamp vessels by means of a flare mount and sealed in gastightly. The electrode system can be squeezed into the open end or ends only with very small tube diameters.<br>
The flare mounting method requires in the stem an additional pumping tube via which the lamps are pumped, rinsed and filled with the necessary substances. Because this pumping tube has to be sealed gastightly after the filling procedure, this results in an additional manufacturing step.<br>
In addition, in a flare mount, a metal or plastic base addition is required which is attached to the flare mount by means of adhesive cement.<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
The flare mount and the attachment of the base require a complex machinery.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to make available a method for manufacturing a lamp as status in the specification in which it is possible to dispense with a pumping tube and a subsequent attachment to a base, and the machinery for manufacturing the lamp is thus simplified.<br>
This object if achieved by means of the defining features of the invention. Further advantageous refinements can be found in the dependent claims.<br>
In the method according to the invention, the lamp vessel is inserted gastightly with the at least one open cylindrical end into a pumping head, the pumping head bearing, on a holder, a sealing plate with the electrode system and the connecting pins in such a way that when the lamp vessel is inserted into the pumping head the sealing plate comes to bear perpendicularly with respect to the axis of the cylindrical end of the lamp vessel. The holder can be placed along the axis of the lamp vessel. The sealing plate has here an external contour which is a little smaller than the internal contour of the open end of the lamp vessel. This makes it possible to pump the lamp vessel, rinse it and fill it with gases and possibly further filling substances to the desired amount via the pumping head. The edge of the sealing plate and the lamp vessel are then heated at the level of the sealing plate from the outside using a power source so that the end of the lamp vessel buckles in at the level of the sealing plate and connects gastightly to the edge of the sealing plate. Finally,<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
the open end of the lamp vessel which protrudes beyond the sealing plate is cut off.<br>
The most simple form of the method is when the cylindrical end of the lamp vessel has a circular internal contour, and the sealing plate has a circular edge.<br>
It is advantageous for a vacuum tight sealing of the lamp vessel that the power source rotates about the lamp vessel and the sealing plate during the heating procedure. However, with certain vessels it may also be advantageous if the lamp vessel and the sealing plate rotate on the power source during the heating procedure. A gas burner is preferably used here as the power source.<br>
In the event that the lamp to be manufactured is a fluorescent lamp with a tubular lamp vessel with a continuously circular cross section, and to manufacture the lamp a glass tube which is open at both ends is used, the two ends of said glass tube are inserted simultaneously or successively into the pumping head with a circular sealing plate which is attached to a mount and has the electrode system and the connecting pins .<br>
In the case of an incandescent lamp with a light bulb-shaped lamp vessel, in which case to manufacture it a light bulb-shaped glass vessel is used which has a circular-cylindrical open end, the circular-cylindrical open end is inserted into the pumping head with a circular sealing plate which is attached to a mount and has the electrode system and the connecting pins.<br>
The electrode system is advantageously composed of a mount and a single coil filament which is attached to it and which is mounted on the side of the sealing plate facing away from the open end of the lamp vessel. On the side of the sealing plate facing the open end of the lamp vessel, electric<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
connecting pins are mounted and electrically connected to the single coil filament via current feeder lines.<br>
The sealing plate is advantageously composed of insulating glass. It can however also be composed of metal, in which case the current feeder lines are surrounded by insulating material, for example glass solder, in the region where they pass through the sealing plate. However, the sealing plate can also be composed of a glass stem at whose edge a metal ring is mounted.<br>
If the single coil filament bears an emitter, the current feeder lines for forming the emitter are advantageously electrically connected to a power source.<br>
The invention also relates to a lamp manufactured according to the present method.<br>
Description of the drawings<br>
The method according to the invention will be explained in more detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows the method setup at the start of the manufacturing method according to the invention for manufacturing a tubular low pressure discharge lamp,<br>
Figure 2 shows the method setup during the heating of the sealing plate and lamp vessel,<br>
Figure 3 shows the method setup after disconnection of the protruding end of the lamp vessel,<br>
Figure la shows the method setup at the start of the manufacturing method according to the invention for manufacturing a light bulb-shaped incandescent lamp.<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
Figure 1 shows the method setup at the start of the manufacturing method according to the invention for manufacturing a tubular low pressure discharge lamp.<br>
The tubular lamp vessel 1 with circular internal cross section is inserted here by its two ends into one pumping head 2 in each case, the two seals, 3, 4 providing a vacuum tight seal from the surroundings. In the present figures 1 to 3, just one end 5 which is inserted into a pumping head 2 is shown for the sake of simplicity.<br>
The pumping head 2 also bears, on a holder 6, a sealing plate 7 made of glass, to which an electrode system composed of a single coil filament 8 and an integration cap 9 is attached on the side facing away from the pumping head 2, and connecting pins 10, which are connected to the single coil filament 8 via current feeder lines 11, are attached on the side facing the pumping head 2. In addition, the connecting pins 10 for forming a getter material are placed in electrical contact via cables 12.<br>
The tubular lamp vessel 1 can then be pumped, rinsed and filled with the required filling materials via an opening 13 on the pumping head 2, which is indicated by the double arrow.<br>
Figure 2 shows the following method step of the method according to the invention. The method setup is essentially the same here as in the method setup indicated in figure 1. However, an energy source in the form of a gas burner 14 is additionally arranged in the position of the sealing plate 7. By rotating the lamp vessel 1 and the sealing plate 7 using the pumping head 2, the lamp vessel 1 at this point and the edge of the sealing plate 7 are heated until the lamp vessel 1 buckles in at this point and connects gastightly to the edge of the sealing plate 7.<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
The further method step whose setup is illustrated in figure 3 shows the end 14 which is cut off from the gastightly sealed lamp vessel 1. After the pumping head 2 is flooded with atmospheric air via the opening 13, on the basis of figure 2, the end 14 can be pulled off the sealed.-in lamp 15 and cut off by displacing the pumping head 2, and the disconnection point on the lamp 15 is molten. After the holder 6 is then pulled off from the connecting pins 10 and the pumping head 2 is pulled off, the finished lamp 15 can be removed, and after the release of the seal 3, the end 14 can be removed.<br>
Instead of tubular low pressure discharge lamps, the method according to the invention can also be applied in the lamps with a light bulb-shaped lamp vessel such as an incandescent lamp.<br>
Figure la shows the method setup for manufacturing an incandescent lamp at the start of the method, the setup corresponding very largely to the method setup shown in figure 1 for tubular low pressure discharge lamps. For this reason, the same parts of the setup are designated by the same numbers as in figure 1. Instead of the tubular lamp vessel, a light bulb-shaped lamp vessel 16 with a circular-cylindrical open end 17 is inserted into the pumping head 2 here. The sealing plate 18 bears here, on the side facing away from the pumping head 2, a single coil filament 19 which is connected to the connecting pins 21 via current feeder lines 20.<br>
The sequence of the rest of the method for manufacturing an incandescent lamp corresponds in its basic method steps to the method for manufacturing a tubular low pressure discharge lamp. For this reason, the further method steps have not been presented.<br><br>
