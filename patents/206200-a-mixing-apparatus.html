				<td>   A   MIXING APPARATUS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a mixing apparatus, and more particularly to a mixing apparatus wherein raw material is crushed to fine particles of desirous size and mixed uniformly by multi-layed mixing blocks which are additionally attachable, the cost is decreased because more emulsifier or other additional treatment is not required, the efficiency of crushing and mixing is increased because the movement of raw material and the collision between the crushed particles are increased, and the capacity may be increased easily.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Conventionally, emulsion fuel is known as the fuel that water and oil which are crushed to fine particles and mixed each other. And, in order to increase fuel combustion efficiency, the emulsion fuel has been used for a large-sized boiler or a ship engine and the like. And, various kinds of mixing apparatuses have been invented for making the emulsion fuel. Further, the above mixing apparatuses are used in order to crush various kinds of fluids finely and to mix them uniformly. And, the fuel which are crushed and mixed like this are used in a factory and the like.<br>
The above prior mixing apparatus includes a single rotation unit which is mounted in a case and is rotated by a motor, and a fixing unit which is mounted in the case parallel to the rotation unit. Here, at the facing side of the rotation unit and the fixing unit, a plurality of projections are formed along the circumferential direction at a predetermined interval so that they form concentric circles which are alternately engaged with each other.<br>
Accordingly, if a fluid, that is, a raw material is supplied in the center of the rotation unit which is rotating at a high speed, the liquid is rotated along the projections of the rotation unit so that it passes the spaces between the respective projections owing to centrifugal force and is outwardly discharged through the<br>
-1-<br><br>
discharge holes formed at the periphery of the case. Then, the liquid alternately passes the respective arrays of the projections of the rotation unit and the fixing unit so that it continuously collides with the respective projections. Accordingly, the fluid is crushed to fine particles and mixed together so that it is emulsified in fine particles.<br>
However, the mixing apparatus has the problem that, if the fluid supplied in its center passes between the rotation unit and the fixing unit, because it is rapidly discharged through the discharge holes of the case or is discharged toward the outside through a centrifugal vane, the fluid may not be crushed to particles of desirous size. Accordingly, the mixing apparatus has the problem that much troubles may be caused and much time is wasted because the user stores the emulsified fluid in a tank and emulsifies the fluid once again in order to crush the fluid to desirous size. Further, the mixing apparatus has the problem that additional equipments are increased and the emulsified material may be separated each other and returned to the original state while it is stored in the tank.<br>
Accordingly, in case of emulsifying the fluid by the prior mixing apparatus, an emulsifler like a surface active agent is usually mixed into the fluids in order that the supplied fluids may be mixed uniformly and the mixed fluids may not be easily separated each other. However, the emulsification method like the above has the problems that the cost is increased and the environment is polluted because an emulsifier like a surface active agent may be additionally required besides pure fuel or raw material, and the emulsion fuel may be separated into water and oil while preheating the fuel.<br>
And, the fluid supplied into said mixing apparatus is rotated along the rotation unit in the spaces between the projections of the rotation unit so that it flows outwardly because of centrifugal force at the moment that the spaces between the projections of the rotation unit are opened to the spaces between the projections of the fixing unit. Here, while said fluid is going to flow toward the tangential direction of the rotation unit because of centrifugal force, the spaces between the<br>
-2-<br><br>
projections of the fixing unit filled with said fluids may radially form the rectangular spaces which are different in angle from the flowing direction of the fluids. Accordingly, the fluid flown in the rectangular space may be resisted in its acceleration movement, and the emulsification efficiency maybe remarkably decreased.<br>
Further, because the respective projections of the mixing apparatus are made by forming a plurality of concentric ring type protrusions on one surface of a disk and by slitting said protrusions toward the radial direction, the size of the projections grows larger toward the outer side in the radial direction. Accordingly, the mixing apparatus has the problem that the efficiency of crushing and mixing is decreased remarkably when the fuel passes the spaces between the projections so that the capacity may not be easily increased.<br>

The arrays of the projections 27, 28 are formed with concentric circle .shape and the arrays of the projections 27, 28 are alternately engaged with the<br>
-9-<br><br>
adjacent arrays of the projections 28, 27. And, among the disks 34, 36, 44, 46, the diameter of the disks 34, 44 directed.to.the inlet 118 of the housing 114. as shown in Figure 4. is smaller than that of.the housing.-114 or the diameter of the housing is larger than that of said disks 34, 44. Accordingly, a predetermined space is formed between the outer periphery of said disks 34. 44 and the inner wall of the housing 114 so that inflow holes 37, 47 opened to the fluid passages 39, 49 are formed between the disks 34, 44 and the housing 114. And, the disks 114 directed to the outlet 112 of said housing 114 have exhaust holes 35, 45 which are opened to said fluid passages 39, 49.<br>
Further, a boss 31 is mounted at the center of said rotation unit 104 and the boss 31 is combined with the shaft 102 of the motor 100 by spline. And, among the disks 44, 46 of the fixing unit 106, as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 7, the diameter of one disk. 44 is larger than that of the mixing space 41 ant the periphery of said disk 44 is inserted into the connection portion of the housing 114 which are piled up in multiple layers so that the disk 44 is fixed in the housing.<br>
And, as shown in Figure 5 and Figure 7, a plurality of fluid guide blades 62 are mounted at the fluid passage 39 in the rotation unit 104, and they are slanted to the rotation direction of the rotation unit 104 toward radial outer side. And, a plurality of fluid guide blades 63 are mounted at the fluid passage 49 of the fixing unit 106, and they are slanted to the direction which is opposite to the rotation direction of the rotation unit 104..toward the outer side of thejgdigl direction. Accordingly, the fluid passing the respective fluid passages 39, 49 is guided by the fluid guide blades 62, 63 and flows toward the inner side of the diametric direction.<br>
The mixing units 104, 106, may be additionally attachable in multiple layers. As shown in Figure 2, an upper disk member 108 is mounted on the fixing unit 106. The upper disk member 108 is engaged with the fixing unit 106 and crushes the fluid to particles and mixes it. The upper disk member 108 is fixed at the shaft 102 of the motor 100 by spline and is rotated with the shaft 102. The arrays of<br>
-10-<br><br>
the projections 26 are formed at the lower surface of the upper disk member 108, and they are alternately engaged with the arrays of the projections 28 of the fixing unit 106. A plurality of blades 29 are mounted at the periphery of the upper disk member 108, and they discharges the emulsified or mixed material to the outside through the outlet 112 of the upper housing 51.<br>
As shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, a base cover block 12 is fixed on the flange_10 of the motor 100 by a plurality of bolts, and the lower housing 24 is fixed on the base cover block 12. A bearing cover 20 is mounted in the inner side of the base cover block 12. A bearing 22 and a sleeve 32 are mounted in the shaft hole 3.0 of the lower housing 24 sequently. Here, the sleeve 32 is mounted at the shaft 102 of the motor 100, and a plurality of teeth are formed at the outer periphery of the sleeve 32 so that various fluids supplied through the inlet 118 of the lower housing 24 may be firstly crushed to particles and mixed by the sleeve 32. <br>
And, the rotation unit 104 is mounted on the lower housing 24, and the arrays of the projections 28 formed at the lower surface of the rotation unit 104 are alternately engaged with the arrays of the projections 27 formed at the upper surface of the lower housing 24. Accordingly, the rotation unit 104 is rotated with the shaft 102 so that it crushes the supplied fluid to fine particles and mixes the particles.<br>
The fixing unit 106 is mounted on the rotation unit 104, and the arrays of the projections 27 formed at the lower surface of the fixing unit 106 are alternately engaged with the arrays of the projections 28 formed on the upper surface of the rotation unit 104. And, as shown in Figure 7, an insertion hole 104 is formed in the center of the lower disk 44 of the fixing unit 106, and a sleeve 42 is inserted into the insertion hole 107. The sleeve 42 is slidably combined at the periphery of the shaft 102. Accordingly, the sleeve 42 keeps the space between the fixing unit 1Q6 and the rotation unit 104 so that the shaft 102 may be rotated smoothly and the fluid does not flow backward toward the lower direction through the insertion hole 107.<br>
-11-<br><br>
The rotation unit 104 and the fixing unit 106 are alternately piled up in multiple layers. And, the upper disk member 108 is mounted on the upper fixing block 106 and it is fixed at the periphery of the shaft 102. Here, the arrays of the projections 26 of the upper disk member 108 are alternately engaged with the arrays of the projections 28 of the upper fixing block 106.<br>
According to the invention, as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 4, the fluid supplied through the inlet 118 of the lower housing 24 passes the insertion hole 30. so that it is preliminarily crushed to fine particles and mixed by the teeth of the sleeve 32 which is rotated with the shaft 102. And, the crushed and mixed fluid is supplied between the lower disk member 110 and the rotation unit 104.<br>
Next, said fluid is rotated along the rotation unit 104, and it alternately passes the arrays of the projections 25 of the lower disk member 110 and the arrays of the projections 27 of the rotation unit 104 owing to the centrifugal force. At this time, the fluid repeats the rotation movement(so to speak, the movement which is rotated along the rotation direction of the rotation unit 104) by the arrays of the projections 27 of the rotation unit 104 and the suspension of the rotation movement by the arrays of the projections 25 of the lower disk member 110 so that it is crushed and mixed. At the same time, the fluid is rotated in the spaces 25a, 27a between the respective projections 25, 27(so to speak, it is rotated along the wall of the projections 25, 27 arrayed in the spaces 25a, 27a between the respective projections 25, 27) so that it is crushed to fine particles and mixed owing to the collision between the particles.<br>
Like the above, the fluid which passed between the lower disk member 110 and the rotation unit 104, as shown in Figure 7, flows in the fluid passage 39 between the lower and the upper disks 34, 36 of the rotation unit 104 and is supplied between the rotation unit 104 and the fixing unit 106 through the outflow hole 35 of the center of the upper disk 36. Here, the fluid guide blades 62 of Figure 5 are mounted in the fluid passage 39__of the rotation unit 104 so that the fluid supplied to the periphery of the rotation unit 104 flows in the inner side of the rotation unit 104 bv the fluid guide blades 62. In the end, the supplied fluid<br>
-12-<br><br>
is smoothly flown by the fluid guide blades 62.<br>
Next, the fluid supplied between the rotation unit 104 and the fixing unit 106 flows toward the outer periphery through the respective arrays of the projections 27, 28 of the rotation unit 104 and the fixing unit 106 according as the rotation unit 104 is rotated at a high speed. And, the fluid which flows toward the outer periphery is crushed in particles and mixed uniformly in the same method as the fluid is crushed and mixed between the lower disk member 110 and the rotation unit 104. In the result, the fluid is emulsified in more fine particles.<br>
Accordingly, the mixing apparatus of the invention emulsifies the fluid to fine particles of desirous size by repeating the above procedures by means of multi-laved mixing block 104, 106 and supplies the emulsified fluid to various apparatus(for example, a boiler or a ship engine) which are connected to its outlet 112.<br>
The mixing apparatus of the invention may emulsify the fluid of desirous size and supply the emulsified fluid to the apparatus connected to it because the mixing block 104, 106 may be additionally attachable whenever the user may add up a plurality of the intermediate housing 40 between the upper housing 24 and the lower housing 51 of Figure 2 and exchange the shaft 102 for the shaft 102 of the corresponding length. According to the mixing apparatus of the invention, the static emulsification material which is not separated into different substance may be supplied to the apparatus connected to the mixing apparatus, and a plurality of mixing machines are not required in order to make emulsification material of desirous size. And, the mixing apparatus of the invention does not require additional equipments like a tank for storing the emulsified material for some time.<br>
And, according to the mixing apparatus of the invention, the fluid filled in the spaces 27a of the respective projections 27 of the rotation unit 104 is rotated in a predetermined angle and flows toward the spaces 28a between the respective projections 28 of the fixing unit 106. Here, the both sides of the projection 27, 28<br>
-13-<br><br>
is formed with concave curve surface, and the end of the inlet side approximately corresponds to the direction where the fluid is flown by centrifugal force. Therefore, because the fluid supplied in the space 27a, 28a is not resisted in its acceleration movement and is rotated along the concave curve surface of the projections 27, 28 at a high speed, and the collision between the crushed particles may be increased so that the efficiency of crushing and mixing mav be increased remarkably.<br>
Like the above, the mixing apparatus has advantage that no emulsifier for stabilizing the emulsified material is not required additionally, the cost may be decrease, and environment pollution is not caused at all.<br>
Besides, the respective projections 27, 28 is made by drilling the ring-shaped protrusions formed on one side of the respective disks 34, 36, 44, 46 in a predetermined space. Accordingly, the mixing apparatus may increase the efficiency of crushing and mixing the fluid because the size of the projections 27, 28 are formed uniformly although the respective mixing units 104, 106 is enlarged. And, the capacity of the mixing apparatus may be easily increased and a great amount of the fluid may be emulsified into desirous size and supplied to the machines connected to it.<br>
And, according to the mixing apparatus, the fluid guide blades 62, 63 are mounted in the respective mixing units 104, 106 and they guide the fluid discharged to the periphery of the mixing units 104, 106 into the center of the mixing units 104, 106. Therefore, although the capacity of the mixing units 104, 106 is increased, the fluid passing the mixing units 104, 106 may flow smoothly.<br>
The mixing apparatus may crush and mix a powder material as well as the fluid. The mixing apparatus may be applied to the chemical goods like adhesives, paint, greese, insecticide, herbicide, liquid fertilizer, the foods like nectar, fruit juice, vegetable juice, edible solid, the cosmetic.like lotion,.cream, gel, lip stick, toothpaste, and the industrial field utilizing oil. Besides, the mixing apparatus may be applied to the various fields. Accordingly, the mixing apparatus of the invention has the advantages that raw<br>
-14-<br><br>
material may be crush to fine particles of desirous size and mixed uniformly by means of multi-layed mixing blocks which are attachable additionally, and the emulsified material is supplied to the connected machine, the cost may be decreased because no emulsifier is required additionally, the efficiency of crushing and mixing may be increased because the movement of raw material is increased, and a great amount of raw material may be crushed and mixed uniformly because the capacity may be increased easily.<br>
