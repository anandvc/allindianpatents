Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of a pesticide for use in the agriculture and horticulture fields.<br>
The use of phytochemical pesticides is known in the art. Such pesticides are like pyrethrum from chrysanthemum and neem used pesticides from neem kernal and neem oil. There are certain disadvantages associated with the chemical pesticide. One of the main disadvantages is that these pesticides are toxic in nature and thus the product become toxic.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the conventional chemical pesticides are not biodegradable.<br>
Another disadvantage associated with the neem-based pesticide is that it is not so effective and it is required for use.<br>
Therefore, the main object of this invention is to provide a natural pesticide, which obviates the disadvantage associated with the prior art.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a pesticide, which is not toxic in nature.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a pesticide, which does not damage the fertility of the soil.<br><br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for preparation of pesticide comprising treating cut and crushed leaves, flowers, fruits and tender stem of calotropis, gigantean and/or calotropis procera, nerium oleander and hydrocarpus each separately with dichloro ethane to get the extract and solid parts thereof, the residual masses obtained after treatments of the above cut and crushed leaves, flower, tender stem, fruits and/or stems, each of which is dissolved in diethylene glycols or polyethylene glycol separately and filtered, the filtrates so obtained are mixed in the range of 40-60% Calotropis extract, 20-30% Hydrocarpus extract, 20-30% Oleander extract in order to prepare the pesticide formulation, taking the said formulation in a glass beaker separately and adding 30% hydrochloric acid with or without zinc chloride thereof, stirring said beaker for a period of 1-3 hours at a temperature of 15-50°C and cooled, an ionic emulsifier and nonyl phenol ethylene oxide is then added therein and mixed well, to which antioxidants alongwith para amino benzoic acid is mixed in order to obtain amber liquid or turbid liquid for use as a pesticide.<br>
In accordance with this invention leaves, flowers, tender stem and fruits, seeds of calotropis, oleander and hydrocarpus are cut into small pieces and crushed gently. The crushed leaves flowers, tender stem, fruits and seeds are subjected to the step of extraction/treatment separately by using dichloroethane or methanol in the ratio of 1:2-8 at a temperature of 30°C to 60°C under stirring for a period of 2-8 hours. The hot extraction mixture so obtained is cooled and filtered. The solid mass is squeezed to get the liquid separated therefrom. ;The extract so obtained is distilled under vacuum at a temperature of 40°C-60°C to remove the<br><br>
solvent. The residual mass is collected. The solid mass obtained after filtration is triturated with methanol in the ratio of 1:2-8 at a temperature of 40-100°C under stirring for a period of 2-8 hours. The solution is cooled and filtered. The residue is squeezed to remove the liquid contents therefrom. The extract so obtained is distilled in the vacuum to remove the methanol therefrom. The solid mass obtained after the above step is again treated with water in the ratio of 1:2-10 at a temperature of 40-100°C for a period of 2-8 hours and filtered in the hot condition. The residue is squeezed to remove the liquid therefrom. The solution is distilled and the residual mass is collected. The water solution so obtained is distilled under vacuum at a temperature of 40-80°C to remove water therefrom and the residual mass is collected.<br>
The residual masses obtained after processing of calotropis, oleander and hydro carpus separately are dissolved in diethylene glycol or polyethylene glycol and is filtered and the filtrate is collected. The filtrate obtained from the above materials are mixed in the range of 40-60% Calotropis extract, 20-30% Hydrocarpus extract, 20-30% Oleander extract with each other to prepare formulation.<br>
The above formulation is taken into a glass beaker and 30% hydrochloric acid with or without zinc chloride (anhydrous) is added thereto. The solution is stirred for a period of 1-3 hours at a temperature of 15-50°C and cooled. Non ionic emulsifier for example tween 80 and nonyl phenol ethylene oxide 9-12 mole is added therein and mixed well. Antioxidants for example butylated hydroxy anisole ordibutyl hydroquinon alongwith para amino-benzoic acid is added and mixed well. The resultant clear<br><br>
