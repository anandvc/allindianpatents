SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for preparing star<br>
shaped branched polyisoprene.<br>
It is generally recogized in the art that polydienes have useful<br>
application as elastomers mainly in the tyre sector and as well as viscosity<br>
index improvers or tackiness agents.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Synthesis of polydienes and block copolymers of styrene and dienes by<br>
anionic polymerization has been reported by Morton and Fetters (Rubber<br>
Chem. &amp; Tech. 1975, 48, 359) and Mc-Grath (Anionic Polymerization Kinetics,<br>
Mechanisms and Synthesis 1981; ACS Symposium Series Vol 166) and is<br>
known, in the polymer art, to provide precise control over many important<br>
properties such as molecular weight and distribution, stereochemistry, end<br>
group functionally, topology etc.<br>
While synthesizing polymers using bench top method, it has been<br>
recognized in the past by many workers from Phillips Petroleum Company (eg.<br>
in US Patent 3755273, issued Agu 28, 1973, dutch Patent 7700168 and Shell<br>
Oil Company (e.g in US Patent 4116917, issued Sept. 26,1978) that<br>
: 3 :<br>
deleterious impurities such as protonic: compounds<br>
carbonyl compounds, halogen compounds,, oxidizing agents<br>
etc. can kill some of the growing chains and thu*<br>
broaden the molecular weight distribution.<br>
For carrying out polymerization of isoprene<br>
in cyclohexane the usual procedure has been to titrate<br>
such impurities present in the initial feed comprising<br>
of solvent and monomer by butyl lithium (BuLi) at a<br>
temperature of about 30~3!:Pc before the addition of<br>
required quantity of BuLi. The polymerizations were<br>
carried out for 2.5-3 hrs at 50°C. The reaction is<br>
extended by 5 hours at 80° C for the synthesis of star<br>
polymers.<br>
Shell Oil Company in an earlier disclosure<br>
US Patent 3553295, dated Jan 5,, .1971), had indicated<br>
that cyclohexane could be purified by adopting steps<br>
like BuLi scavenging, activated alumina treatment and<br>
molecular sieves treatment. Hoover and Me~Brath<br>
(Polymer Preprints 1986 Sept, 150-1) have reported<br>
purification of cyclohexane by percolation over<br>
activated alumina (for deinhibition) and molecular<br>
sieves (for dehydration) in pressence of nitrogen which<br>
had previously been purified by percolation over<br>
molecular sieve.<br>
: 4 :<br>
Shell Cil Company in its disclosure (US<br>
Patent 3553295, issued Jan 5, 1971) had indicated that<br>
isoprene could be purified "by treatment with activated<br>
alumina to reduce the level of reactive impurities.<br>
In a comprehensive procedure for the<br>
purification of isoprene required for stereo-specific<br>
polymerization purpose, Ceausescu ( in Stereospecific<br>
Polymerization of Isoprene Pergamon Press Ltd., 1983),<br>
had adopted treatment with maleic anhydride for the<br>
steps of ( i.) the removal of eye. 1 open tad iene, (ii)<br>
distillation with a 5-TP column under purified nitrogen<br>
for removal of oxygen and the inhibitor and (iii)<br>
percolation over molecular sieves 5A for the removal of<br>
moisture, carbonyl compounds and acetylenic<br>
hydrocarbons. Hoover and Me Grath (Polymer Preprints<br>
1986 Sept, 150-1) have adopted purification procedure<br>
for isopreru?, similar to the one adopted for cyclohexane<br>
but haves cautioned against excessive monomer residence<br>
times over molecular<br>
s 5 s<br>
sieves which might result in inaitu polyroerization and<br>
column fouling.<br>
Recently, J.E. He Gretth et.el have<br>
^repor ted , 253-4)<br>
purification of technical grade divinyl benzene (DVB) by<br>
stirring with calcium hydride followed by exposure to<br>
neutral alumina and vacuum distillation from dibutyl<br>
inagnessiuiB,<br>
The prior art methods discussed above have<br>
the disadvantage of very long reaction durations of 7—9<br>
hours for the synthesis of star-shaped polyisoprene<br>
including 2.5-3 hours for linear polymer.<br>
Another limitation of the prior art methods is<br>
virtual absence of any description on the process<br>
details for regulating the temperature etc. during the<br>
polymerization.<br>
Another disadvantage of the prior art methods<br>
is lack of adequate details for developing a complete<br>
purification methodology for solvent, taonomer and<br>
coupling agent.<br>
Prior art methods have also not reported the methods<br>
a* storage of purified solvent and monomers and subsequent<br>
handling i-f any, without any loss to their purity levels.<br>
While the above are the major disadvantages of the<br>
prior art methods, there are various other related aspects<br>
regarding the monitoring of quality/purity levels of solvent and<br>
monomers, activation of deinhibitors and dehydrants, purification<br>
of inert gas and regeneration of oxygen removing catalysts, which<br>
have not been described.<br>
OBJECT AND DESCRIPTION QF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
It is therefore, an object of this invention to propose<br>
an improved polymerization process for the preparation of<br>
hamopolymers and star polymers of i&amp;oprerte with narrow molecular<br>
weight distribution.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a<br>
polymerization process for the preparation of homopolymers and<br>
star polymers of isoprene which is completed within short period<br>
of time say 2 hr-<br>
Still a further abject af this invention is to propose<br>
a polymerization process for the preparation of homopolymers and<br>
star polymers of isoprene having included therein an improved<br>
method for the purification of solvent, monomer and coupling<br>
agent.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to propose a<br>
polymerization process for the preparation of<br>
homopolymers and star polymers of isoprene and having<br>
included therein an improved method<br>
: 7 :<br>
of storage of purified solvent and manomers without any loss to their purity<br>
levels.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent<br>
from the ensuing description.<br>
According to this invention there is provided an improved process for<br>
preparing star shaped branched polyisoprene characterized by the steps of<br>
heating a solvent being cyclohexane in a reaction vessel to a reaction<br>
temperature of 40-56°C, adding thereto isoprene premixed with a known<br>
catalyst selected from secondary butyl lithium and normal butyl lithium,<br>
allowing the temperature to rise due to the presence of the reaction till a<br>
steady state temperature is achieved, heating said reaction mixture to a<br>
temperature higher than said steady state temperature for completion of the<br>
polymerization step, and then reacting the linear polyisoprene with a coupling<br>
agent.<br>
It has not been found that isoprene manomer can be polymerized using<br>
Butyl Lithium catalyst within half an hour of the start of the reaction.<br>
Additional one hour is required for converting the linear homopolyisoprene<br>
into star branched polyisoprene as a result of coupling reaction, with divinyl<br>
benzene.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the entire polymerization is<br>
completed within a period of 25-30 minutes with quantitative conversion and<br>
molecular weight close to the oretical molecular weights with narrow<br>
molecular<br>
! 8 S<br>
weight distribution. The polymerization process is a<br>
multistep process comprising in the addition o-f monower<br>
premixed with defined catalyst quantity to a solvent in<br>
a reaction vessel at a given temperature and regulation<br>
o-f the temperature for polymerisation. Addition of DVB,<br>
at this stage is carrried out for the synthesis of star<br>
branched polyisoprene which takes an hour more. The<br>
reaction is otherwise terminated<br>
: 9 :<br>
The present invention involves regeneration<br>
of oxygen removing catalysts, activation of deinhibitors<br>
and dahydrants, proper cleaning, purification and drying<br>
of glasswares, purification of solvent, monomer and<br>
coupling agent, storage and handling of purified<br>
solvent, monomer and coupling agent and storage, assay<br>
and handling of n-butyllithium.<br>
The inert gas such as nitrogen or argon is<br>
required to be absolutely free from oxygen and moisture.<br>
Conseguently, inert gas belonging to analytical reagents<br>
grade was further purified by passing through oxygen<br>
removal tower, packed with BASF catalyst R3-11 duly<br>
regemsratecl and gas drying tower packed with any<br>
powerful dehydrant such as activated molecular sieves<br>
5A. The inert gas so purified is used in all the<br>
purification, transfer and polymerisation operations.<br>
The alumina was activated at 180-200 C°for 3-<br>
4 hrs under a purified stream of inert gas. Similarly,<br>
the molecular sieves 5A was activated at 300-350°C for<br>
6-8 hrs under the purified stream of inert gas. The<br>
activated alumina/sieves were preserved by storage<br>
either in an electric oven maintained at 120-130 C°or in &gt;
a glove box.<br>
: 10 :<br>
The air-less-wares and equivalent glass wares<br>
were scrupluously and meti culously cleaned with the<br>
help of a good quality detergent solution for the<br>
removal of any physical and chemical contaminants. The<br>
cleaned glasswars were dried in an electric: oven at 120-<br>
130 t for a period not less than 12 hrs.<br>
The dried glassares were assembled hot and<br>
cooled under a stream of purified inert gas till they<br>
attained room temperature.<br>
For the purpose of storage of BuLi solutions,<br>
the catalyst solutions were packaged using sure/seal<br>
system and storing the bottles containing the BuLi<br>
solution, in a refrigerated storage cabinet.<br>
The synthesis of polyisoprenes and<br>
starbranched polyisoprene were carried out in<br>
eyelohexane.<br>
Accordingly, in accordance with the<br>
objectives of this invention suitable purification<br>
methods for eyelohexane, followed by subsequent storage<br>
methods with a view to obtain solvent ready for anionic<br>
polymerisation, were adopted. Quality checks for the<br>
purity levels in terms of moisture content, were made<br>
s 11<br>
The solvent generally contains 4C*-5fiJ ppm<br>
moisture though higher moisture levels are not uncommon.<br>
The gross moisture front the solvent is removed by having<br>
the solvent re-fluxed over sodium wire in presence of<br>
the benzophenene -followed by distillation. This etep<br>
results in reduction of moisture level to 15-20 ppm.<br>
The next step in purification of solvent is<br>
scavenging of catalytic poisons by refluK from isoprenyl<br>
l i t h i um or a combination of 1.1-diphenyi ethyl ene and<br>
BuLi , followed by distillation over vigruew column.<br>
The storage of the solvent between two<br>
consecutive steps is an important aspect. Many methods<br>
like storage over a bed of activated molecular sieve* or<br>
under inert gas can be adopted. However, the best<br>
results are obtained by storing the solvent in glove<br>
box.<br>
The last step for the purif i cation comprises<br>
of percolation over alumina and molecular sieves 5A<br>
packed in a column (70cm x 2.5cm ) in a Is2 wt. ratio<br>
at a preferred rate of '299 *l/hr. This step ensures<br>
complete removal of inhibitors and moisture present at<br>
trace level.<br>
! 12 :<br>
It is observed that no systematic account of<br>
the puri.ficat*cm method for isoprene has been presented<br>
in the 1iterature. Accordingly, in accordance with the<br>
objectives of this invention, purification methods for<br>
isoprene, followed by subsequent storage methods with a<br>
view to obtain monomer ready for anionic polymerization,<br>
were developed. Like for cyclohexane, rnoisutre levels<br>
of the monomer was also measured at various steps of<br>
purification.<br>
In the -first step of the purification of<br>
isoprene, monomer was purified by stirring with freshly<br>
sublimed maieic anhydride at i7. loading at 
hrs for the removal of cyclopentadiene and<br>
dicyclopentadiene inhibitors.<br>
In the second step, the monomer was stirred<br>
over BuLi and distilled over vigruex column.<br>
Storage of isoprene between two consecutive<br>
steps was carried out by covering the fiask containing<br>
: 13 :<br>
the? monomer with plastic sheets and storing in freezer.<br>
In the next step of the purification of<br>
monomer, the monomer was percolated over alumina and<br>
molecular sieves 5A using a set up similar to that<br>
adopted for the solvent. This step ensures complete<br>
removal of inhibitors and moisture present, at trace<br>
level.<br>
The monomer thus purified has moisture level<br>
less than 1C ppm and is quite suitable for anionic<br>
polymerization purposes.<br>
The coupling agent used for the synthesis of<br>
star-branched polyisoprene, is DVB. Method for the<br>
purification of DVB followed by subsequent storage<br>
methods with a view to obtain the coupling agent ready<br>
for carrying out coupling reactions, was developed.<br>
Like for cyclohexane and isoprene, moisture levels of<br>
the coupling agent was also monitore^d.<br>
The technical grade DVB, inhibited with<br>
antioxidant. „ is supplied as its solution in ethyl<br>
styrene isomers (55%). As their boiling points are very<br>
close to each other and as the isomers do not.<br>
14 s<br>
participate in the coupling reactions their separation<br>
from DVB has not been considered necessary.<br>
For the removal of inhibitors, two methods<br>
were employed. According to the -first method, the DVB<br>
Mas utashed with saturaed solution of sodium hydroxide or<br>
potassium hydroxide, followed by washing with water for<br>
the removal of alkali and storage over fused CsCl-&gt; in<br>
freezer. In the second method, the divinyl benzene was<br>
percolated over activated alumina. Both the methods<br>
give DVB of required purity level,<br>
In the second step, catalytic poisons and<br>
moisture were removed by scavenging DVB by divinyl<br>
benzyl lithium anion, formed by DVB, cyclobexane and<br>
BuLi f prior to distillation at reduced pressure 910 mm<br>
Hg). The use of this scavenging mixture leads to<br>
instantaneous polymerization in many cases and<br>
accordingly DVB has to be distilled at reduced pressure<br>
against anionic polymerization. The use of divinyl<br>
benzyl lithium as a scavenging agent has accordingly,<br>
turned cH.it to be not a very satisfactory proposition and<br>
« t *=* - il Aw *<br>
consequently, in a later development the scavenging<br>
mixture comprising of cyclohewane, 1,1 diphenylethylene<br>
and BuLi were used, which provided to be quite<br>
satisfacotry.<br>
DVB thus puri-fied has a moisture level of<br>
less than 10 ppm and is quite suitable -for- carrying out<br>
coupling reactions.<br>
The solvents, monomer and coupling agent are<br>
quite suitable, if the polymerizations are taken<br>
instantaneously. If it is desired to carry out<br>
polymerization on subsequent days, then in instant<br>
invention, the solvent, monomer and coupling agent have<br>
been stored by two methods successfully. According to<br>
the first method, the solvent is stared in the flask<br>
either over a bed of activated molecular sieves 5A, or<br>
under inert gas. The monomer iBoprene is once again<br>
stirred over BuLi and distilled over a vigruex column,<br>
in order to rule out the possibility of pressure and<br>
future growth of any polyi.soprene nuclei as a result of<br>
percolation over mole cul ar sieves, and the<br>
flask duly covered with plastic sheets is<br>
stored in a freezer, LVB is similarly<br>
16 :<br>
stored after the removal of inhibitor. On the day of<br>
carrying out. polymerization, required quantity of<br>
solvent, monomer or coupling agent can be respectively<br>
treated with scaventing mixture and distilled into the<br>
reaction flask or addition funnel with pressure<br>
equilizer type or a flask, as the case may be. In the<br>
second method, the solvent, monomer and coupling agent<br>
are transferred sure-seal way directly inside the glove<br>
box, except that the solvent is stored at room<br>
temperature and the monomer and DVB are stored in a<br>
refrigerated storage cabinet maintained at -20°C to -<br>
30°C. On the day of carrying out the reaction, required<br>
quantity of solvent, monomer or coupling agent is<br>
transferred out sure-seal way, without any need of<br>
terminal purification steps.<br>
The polymerization process involves multisteps.<br>
In the first step, transfer of solvent to the reaction<br>
vessel is carried out either by distillation or sureseal<br>
way. The reaction vessel comprises of an inert gas<br>
inlet, a thermo well pocket and a<br>
s 17 s<br>
te-f Ion-coated magnet. Th« reaction vessel containing<br>
the solvent is placed in an oil bath mounted on to a<br>
magnetic starrer. The temperature of the bath is<br>
achieved by an immersion heater and regulated by &amp;<br>
contact thermometer—jumo relay assembly. The inert gas<br>
inlet is connected to the purified inert gas stream with<br>
outlet provided through a double walled condenser<br>
mounted onto the reaction vessel. Ice cold water<br>
circulation is commenced through the condenser to arrest<br>
the escape of monomer during its addition and<br>
pol yrner i 2 at i on.<br>
The next step of the process comprises °^<br>
addition of monomer prefixed with required catalyst<br>
quantity to the reaction vessel maintained at set<br>
temperature of the solvent. In the instant invention,<br>
it has been experienced that this set temperature is<br>
40°C and above if the catalyst selected for the<br>
polymerization is sec—BuL.i . If the catalyst chasers for<br>
the polymerization is n-BuLi, then this set temperature<br>
is 5O°C and above. With the commencement of addition of<br>
ButLi mixed isoprene to the solvent maintained at the set<br>
temperature, the- temperature of the feed starts rising<br>
due to the rapid initiation of polymerization.<br>
s 18 t<br>
In fact, such rapid initiation steps are<br>
responsible for a narrow molecular weight, distribution<br>
and any attempt at. this juncture? to disturb this rise in<br>
temperature by way of attempting to iow-jr the<br>
temperature o-f the oil bath, by replacing the hot oil<br>
by cold 01 i is likely to result in .immature termination<br>
of growing polymeric chain. Accordingly, in the third<br>
step of processT when an estotherroicity by about 15-26°C<br>
has been attained in a period of 8-18 minutes o-f the<br>
completion of addition o-f monomer and the temperature of<br>
the feed no longer rises, the temperature of the bath is<br>
quickly raised to a temperature higher than the maximum<br>
of the temperature attained. Under this condition, the<br>
reaction is allowed to run for 15 minutes. In the<br>
instant invention, a time of 15 minutes has been found<br>
to be sufficient for attaining quantitative conversion.<br>
For preparing the star branched polymer, the<br>
reaction is continued further in presence of DVB,<br>
Appearance of blood red colour and its stability are<br>
indicative of the start and continuance of the coupling<br>
reaction. In the instant invention, a time of 1 hourhas<br>
been found to be<br>
5 19 !<br>
sufficient for obtaining maximum star content.<br>
The last step is the recovery of the polymer<br>
from the polymer solution. This comprises of<br>
precipitation into a large excess of methanol, which has<br>
been predoped with 0.5"/. antioxidant such as ditert-butyl<br>
paracresol. The step avoids the degradation of polymer<br>
during storage. The polymer so precipitated is dried in<br>
vacuum oven at 50--6
Specific Example of the Invention<br>
Under mentioned examples illustrated the<br>
process for the synthesis of polyisoprenes and<br>
starbranched polyisoprenes at 20-50g batch size levels,<br>
following the philosophy as contained in the detailed<br>
description section of the instant invention. These<br>
examples should be considered only as illustrative in<br>
nature and in no case, should be considered to limit the<br>
scope of this invention.<br>
Moisture levels of the solvent, monomer and<br>
DVB were measured by Karl Fischer moisture titrator.<br>
The average molecular weights Mw,Mn and molecular<br>
: 20 s<br>
weight, distribution (Hw/fln) and star content were<br>
determined by GPC using linear polyisoprene standards.<br>
Example<br>
1.5 liter eyelohexane was taken in a solvent<br>
repurification still and 15g sodium wire was pressed<br>
into it. The solvent was refluxed for 8 hours and<br>
stored under purified Ar. The solvent was subsequently<br>
distilled into 3-neck 2-L RB flask. The distilled<br>
solvent was scavenged by refluxing from isoprenyl<br>
lithium (formed by iml isoprene., 10 ml eye lohexane and<br>
10 mmol n-BuLi) with the appearance of deep crange<br>
colour for 2 hours and distilled over a vigruex column<br>
into single neck 2™L flask. The solvent, contained in<br>
the flask was stored under purified Ar. The solvent was<br>
dried by percolation over activated alumina and<br>
molecular sieves 5A. The purified solvent was stored<br>
under purified Ar till use.<br>
On the date of carrying out reaction 600 ml<br>
of cyclahexane was transferred into a 3 neck RB flask<br>
and scavenged by refluxing from iaoprenyl lithium<br>
(formed by 0.5 ml isoprene, 5 ml eyelohexane<br>
s 21 :<br>
and 5 atttoi n— BuLi with the appearance of deep orange<br>
colour -for 2 hr and distilled 230 r»l over a vigruex<br>
column into 4 -neck 500 ml reaction -flask. The moisture<br>
level of the solvent was 7 ppm.<br>
2,<br>
1.5 liter cycl. ohex ane was taken in a solvent<br>
repurif ication still and 15 g. sodium wire was pressed<br>
into it. ©.5 g. benzophenene was also added. The<br>
solvent was re-fluxed -for 8 hrs. and stored under<br>
purified Ar. The solvent was subsequently distilled<br>
