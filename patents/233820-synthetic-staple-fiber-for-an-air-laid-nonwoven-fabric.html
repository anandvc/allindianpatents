SYNTHETIC STAPLE FIBERS FOR AN AIR-LAID NONWOVEN FABRIC<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to synthetic staple<br>
fibers for an air-laid nonwoven fabric. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to synthetic<br>
staple fibers for an air-laid nonwoven fabric which<br>
exhibit a good air opening property and are appropriate<br>
to produce an air-laid nonwoven fabric having excellent<br>
quality.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Currently, nonwoven fabrics have been widely used in<br>
fields of daily commodities, sanitary materials and<br>
medical treatment materials. Moreover, in recent years,<br>
a research on, and a development of, an air-laid nonwoven<br>
fabric capable of being produced at a high speed, and<br>
having excellent bulkiness, air-permeability and liquid<br>
permeability have advanced. Many proposals have been<br>
made for such air-laid nonwoven fabrics in which staple<br>
fibers consisting of a synthetic resin, for example, a<br>
polyolefin resin and a polyester resin and having<br>
excellent handing property and mechanical properties are<br>
used (e.g., Patent Reference 1, and the like).<br>
A high air opening property is important to the<br>
staple fibers for the air-laid nonwoven fabric, and thus<br>
the quality of the resultant air-laid nonwoven fabric is<br>
controlled by the opening property of the staple fibers.<br>
For example, according to the investigation performed by<br>
the inventors of the present invention, the staple fibers<br>
for an air-laid nonwoven fabric having sheath layers<br>
formed from a high density polyethylene and located at<br>
the peripheral surfaces of the staple fibers, for<br>
example, poly(ethylene terephthalate)/high density<br>
polyethylene core-in-sheath type composite fibers and<br>
polypropylene/high density polyethylene core-in-sheath<br>
type composite fibers as described in Patent Reference 2<br>
exhibit an improved high air opening property. In the<br>
air laid web formed from the above-mentioned conjugate<br>
staple fibers, the contents of unopened fiber bundles, in<br>
each of which several tens of staple fibers are arranged<br>
in parallel with each other, pill-like defects formed by<br>
entanglement of staple fibers are low and thus the<br>
resultant nonwoven fabric has an improved web quality<br>
compared with conventional fabrics.<br>
However, even when the staple fibers as disclosed in<br>
the Patent Reference 1, and the conjugate fibers as<br>
disclosed in Patent Reference 2, namely conjugate fibers<br>
having high density polyethylene sheath components, are<br>
employed, the resultant nonwoven fabric is unsatisfactory<br>
in quality, because the water content, the individual<br>
fiber thickness and crimping condition of the staple<br>
fibers or the conjugate staple fibers influences on<br>
generation of defects on the resultant nonwoven fabric,<br>
and the generation of the defects has not yet been<br>
sufficiently controlled.<br>
Patent Reference 1: WO 97/48846<br>
Patent Reference 2: Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Publication (Kokai) No. 11-81116<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
(Problems to Be Solved by the Invention)<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide<br>
synthetic staple fibers for an air-laid nonwoven fabric,<br>
having good air opening property and enabling a nonwoven<br>
fabric having excellent quality to be produced, without<br>
specifically limiting the type of the synthetic polymers<br>
for forming the fibers, the individual fiber thickness,<br>
the crimping conditions and the water content.<br>
(Means for Solving the Problems)<br>
In order to solve the above problems, the inventors<br>
of the present invention have intensively carried out<br>
investigations, while they have paid attention to the<br>
cross-sectional profile of staple fibers. As a result,<br>
the inventors of the present invention have found that<br>
some types of staple fibers having specific crosssectional<br>
profiles are hardly influenced by the water<br>
content of the fibers, have a good air opening property<br>
and enable an air-laid nonwoven fabric having an<br>
excellent quality to be produced. The present invention<br>
was completed on the basis of the finding. The inventors<br>
of the present invention have further continued the<br>
investigation, and found that the air opening property of<br>
the staple fibers is affected by the thickness of the<br>
fibers, the number of crimp of the fibers and the type of<br>
the polymeric material from which the fibers are formed.<br>
In this connection, it has been further found that the<br>
above-mentioned various problems can be simultaneously<br>
solved by appropriately establish the cross-sectional<br>
profile of the staple fibers.<br>
The synthetic staple fibers, of the present<br>
invention, for an air-laid nonwoven fabric, which staple<br>
fibers have a fiber length of 0.1 to 45 mm and a crosssectional<br>
profile having 1 to 30 concavities each<br>
satisfies the requirement; D/L = 0.1 to 0.5, wherein D<br>
represents a largest distance between a tangent line<br>
drawn to a pair of convexities from which an opening of<br>
the concavity is defined, and a bottom of the concavity,<br>
measured in a direction at right angles to the tangent<br>
line, and L represents a distance between two points of<br>
contact of the pair of convexities with the tangent line.<br>
The synthetic staple fibers of the present<br>
invention, for an air-laid nonwoven fabric, preferably<br>
have a water content of 0.6% by mass or more but not more<br>
than 10% by mass.<br>
The synthetic staple fibers of the present<br>
invention, for an air-laid nonwoven fabric, preferably<br>
have a thickness of 5 dtex or less.<br>
The synthetic staple fibers of the present<br>
invention, for an air-laid nonwoven fabric, preferably<br>
have a number of crimps of 0 to 5 crimps/25 mm or 15 to<br>
40 crimps/25 mm.<br>
In the synthetic staple fibers, of the present<br>
invention, for an air-laid nonwoven fabric, preferably,<br>
in each of the staple fibers, at least a portion of the<br>
peripheral surface of the staple fiber is formed from at<br>
least one member selected from the group consisting of<br>
polyester resins, polyamide resins, polypropylene resins,<br>
high pressure method low density polyethylene resins,<br>
linear low density polyethylene resins and elastomer<br>
resins.<br>
The synthetic staple fiber, of the present<br>
invention, for an air-laid nonwoven fabric optionally<br>
further comprises at least one functional agent adhered<br>
to the surface of the staple fiber, in an amount of 0.01<br>
to 10% by mass on the basis of the mass of the staple<br>
fiber.<br>
In the synthetic staple fiber of the present<br>
invention for an air-laid nonwoven fabric, the functional<br>
agent is selected from the group consisting of deodorant<br>
functional agents, antibacterial functional agents, flame<br>
retardant functional agents and insect-repellent<br>
functional agents.<br>
(Effect of Invention)<br>
An air-laid nonwoven fabric having few defects and<br>
being excellent in quality can be obtained using the<br>
synthetic staple fibers of the present invention even<br>
with a high water content at which conventional staple<br>
fibers are difficult to open. Moreover, according to the<br>
present invention, even at small thickness, a high number<br>
of crimps or a low number of crimps (including no crimp),<br>
or, even in the presence of a resin or functional agent<br>
having a high friction value and coated on the surfaces<br>
of the staple fibers, the resultant synthetic staple<br>
fibers can be easily opened and converted to a nonwoven<br>
fabric having a high quality.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The synthetic staple fibers, of the present<br>
invention, for an air-laid nonwoven fabric have a fiber<br>
length of 0.1 to 45 mm and a cross-sectional profile, at<br>
right angles to the longitudinal axis of the fiber,<br>
having 1 to 30 concavities each, satisfies the<br>
requirement:<br>
D/L = 0.1 to 0.5<br>
wherein D represents a largest depth of the concavity,<br>
namely a largest distance between a tangent line drawn to<br>
a pair of convexities from which an opening of the<br>
concavity is defined, and a bottom of the concavity,<br>
measured in a direction at right angles to the tangent<br>
line, and L represents a largest opening distance, namely<br>
a distance between two points of contact of the pair of<br>
convexities with the tangent line.<br>
Fig. 1 is an explanatory view of a cross-sectional<br>
profile of an embodiment of the staple fibers of the<br>
present invention.<br>
In Fig. I, a staple fiber 1 has three lobar<br>
convexities 2a, 2b and 2c and three concavities 3a, 3b,<br>
and 3c formed between the convexities. One concavity,<br>
for example, the concavity 3a has a largest opening<br>
distance L which is represented by a distance between<br>
contacts 4a and 4b of a tangent line 4 drawn to contours<br>
of two convexities 2a and 2b by which the two end<br>
portions of the opening of the concavity 3a are defined,<br>
with the contours of the two convexities 2a and 2b.<br>
Also, the largest depth D of the concavity 3a represent a<br>
largest distance between the tangent line 4 and the<br>
contours of the concavity 3a. The L and D values of<br>
other concavities 3b and 3c can be determined in the same<br>
manner as mentioned above.<br>
In the cross-sectional profile of the synthetic<br>
staple fibers of the present invention, the D/L ratios of<br>
all the concavities must be in the range of from 0.1 to<br>
0.5.<br>
In the staple fibers of the present invention, if<br>
the fiber length is less than 0.1 mm, the resultant<br>
nonwoven fabric exhibits an insufficient mechanical<br>
strength, or the resultant staple fibers are agglomerated<br>
to form fiber masses which are difficult to open. Also,<br>
if the fiber length of the staple fibers of the present<br>
invention is more than 45 mm, the resultant staple fibers<br>
exhibit an insufficient opening property. Preferably,<br>
the fiber length of the staple fibers of the present<br>
invention is in the range of from 1 to 45 mm, more<br>
preferably from 3 to 40 mm.<br>
Further, in the cross-sectional profile of the<br>
staple fibers of the present invention, the ratio D/L<br>
value is less than 0.1, the open spaces formed between<br>
the staple fibers in the resultant nonwoven fabric<br>
decrease to cause the fibers located adjacent to each<br>
other to be approximately brought into close contact with<br>
each other and thus a function of trapping water from the<br>
fibers decrease, and the resultant staple fibers exhibit<br>
an insufficient air opening property.<br>
Accordingly, in this case, the desired air-laid<br>
nonwoven fabric having a high quality cannot be obtained.<br>
Also, if the ratio D/L value is more than 0.5, sometimes,<br>
a convexity of a staple fiber fits in a concavity of<br>
another staple fiber located adjacent to the staple fiber<br>
and thus the air opening property of the staple fibers<br>
decreases. Preferably the D/L ratio value is in the<br>
range of from 0.15 to 0.35, more preferably from 0.20 to<br>
0.30.<br>
In the cross-sectional profile of the staple fibers<br>
of the present invention, when the number of the<br>
concavities is 1 or more per fiber, the above-mentioned<br>
effects can be attained, and the larger the number of the<br>
concavities, the better the air opening property of the<br>
resultant staple fibers. However, if the number of the<br>
concavities is more than 30 per fiber, the D/L ratio<br>
value is difficult to control within the above-mentioned<br>
range. Preferably, the number of the concavities is 2 to<br>
20 per fiber, more preferably 3 to 10 per fiber.<br>
In the case of the conventional staple fibers, an<br>
increase in water content of the fibers to 0.6% by mass<br>
or more, causes the air opening property of the resultant<br>
staple fibers to decrease, and thus the resultant<br>
nonwoven fabric exhibit a degraded quality. Compared<br>
with this, in the case of the staple fibers of the<br>
present invention, the air opening property is good even<br>
when the water content is high. The reason for the<br>
above-mentioned performance of the staple fibers of the<br>
present invention is assumed to be that the water, which<br>
usually promotes the agglomeration of the staple fibers<br>
with each other, is trapped in the concavities formed in<br>
the peripheries of the staple fibers and thus the amount<br>
of water which promotes the agglomeration of the staple<br>
fibers decreases. If the water content is too high, the<br>
air opening property of the staple fibers even in the<br>
case where the staple fibers are those of the present<br>
invention, decreases and becomes insufficient. Thus, the<br>
water content of the staple fibers of the present<br>
invention may be 0.6% by mass or more but preferably not<br>
more than 10% by mass, more preferably not more than 3%<br>
by mass.<br>
Also, the inventors of the present invention have<br>
found that, not only in the case where the water content<br>
is high as mentioned above, but also in the case where<br>
the thickness of the fibers is small, the number of<br>
crimps is high, the number of crimps is low or the number<br>
of crimps is zero, or the fiber surface is coated with a<br>
resin or a functional agent having a high frictional<br>
property, the resultant synthetic staple fibers of the<br>
present invention exhibit a good air opening property,<br>
and thus an air-laid nonwoven fabric having a high<br>
quality can be produced from the staple fibers of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The conventional staple fibers having a thickness of<br>
5 dtex or less, particularly 2.5 dtex or less, are<br>
difficult to open by the air opening method, and thus an<br>
air-laid nonwoven fabric having a high quality is<br>
difficult to obtain. Compared with this, the staple<br>
fibers of the present invention have appropriate<br>
concavities formed on the peripheries of the fibers, to<br>
cause sufficient spaces to be formed between staple<br>
fibers adjacent to each other. Therefore, even when the<br>
staple fibers are densely massed, an air flow can easily<br>
penetrate into the gaps between the staple fibers to<br>
sufficiently open the staple fibers, and thus an air-laid<br>
nonwoven fabric having a high quality can be obtained.<br>
However, even in the case of the staple fibers of the<br>
present invention, there is a tendency that, if the<br>
thickness of the staple fiber is too low, the air opening<br>
property of the staple fibers becomes insufficient.<br>
Therefore, the thickness of the staple fibers of the<br>
present invention is preferably in the range of from 0.1<br>
to 5 dtex, more preferably from 0.1 to 2 dtex.<br>
When the conventional staple fibers are opened,<br>
there is a problem that the low number of crimps on the<br>
staple fibers in the range of from 0 to 5 crimps/25 mm<br>
including no crimp, cause non-opened fiber bundles to be<br>
formed with a high frequency, and a high number of crimps<br>
on the staple fibers in the range of from 15 crimps/25 mm<br>
or more causes the staple fibers to be entwined with each<br>
other during the air opening procedure to form fiber<br>
pills. Compared with this, the staple fibers of the<br>
present invention have an improved air opening property<br>
for the reasons as mentioned above and, thus, the<br>
generation of the non-opened fiber bundles and the fiber<br>
pills can be reduced and an air-laid nonwoven fabric<br>
having excellent quality can be produced from the staple<br>
fibers. Accordingly, when the staple fiber of the<br>
present invention having a crimp number selected from low<br>
crimp number range is used, a non-bulky, smooth and flat<br>
nonwoven fabric can be obtained, and when the staple<br>
fibers of the present invention having a crimp number<br>
selected from high crimp number range are used, a bulky<br>
nonwoven fabric having a high porosity can be obtained.<br>
In every case, the resultant nonwoven fabric has a very<br>
low non-opened fiber bundle and fiber pill defect number,<br>
and excellent quality. In any case, as mentioned above,<br>
if the crimp number is too large, the generation of the<br>
pills is promoted, in the high crimp number range, the<br>
number of crimps is preferably in the range of from 15 to<br>
40 crimps/25 mm, more preferably from 15 to<br>
30 crimps/25 mm. The above-mentioned crimps may be twodimensional<br>
crimps in the zig-zag form, or cubic crimps<br>
in a spiral or omega (Q) form.<br>
The staple fibers of the present invention may<br>
comprise only one type of resin or may be a composite<br>
fibers comprising two or more sections formed from two or<br>
more types of resins and combined into a fiber form, or a<br>
polymer blend fibers formed from a blend of two or more<br>
types of resins. Preferably, in the staple fiber of the<br>
present invention, at least a portion of a surface of the<br>
fiber is formed from at least one member selected from<br>
polyester resins, polyamide resins, polypropylene resins,<br>
high-pressure-method low-density polyethylene resins,<br>
linear low-density polyethylene resins and elastomer<br>
resins. In this type of staple fiber, of the present<br>
invention, the effects of the present invention is<br>
particularly exhibited. Namely, the conventional staple<br>
fibers formed from the above-mentioned types of resins<br>
have a high frictional property between fibers and thus<br>
cannot exhibit a sufficient opening property. Compared<br>
with this, in the staple fibers of the present invention,<br>
the specific cross-sectional profile of the fibers<br>
enables the contact area of the staple fibers with each<br>
other to be small and, thus, the friction of the staple<br>
fibers with each other during the air opening procedure<br>
to be reduced, the air opening property of the staple<br>
fibers to be enhanced, and a high quality air-laid<br>
nonwoven fabric to be produced.<br>
The staple fibers of the present invention in which<br>
the above-mentioned synthetic resin is located in the<br>
fiber surfaces include single phase fibers formed from a<br>
member of the above-mentioned resins, polymer blend<br>
fibers formed from a polymer blend in which a member of<br>
the above-mentioned resins is melt, mixed in an amount of<br>
50% or more by mass based on the mass of the fibers, with<br>
an other resin, core-in-sheath or eccentric core-insheath<br>
type composite fibers in which a member of the<br>
above-mentioned resins is contained as a sheath<br>
component, islands-in-sea type composite fibers in which<br>
a member of the above-mentioned resins is contained as a<br>
sea component, and side-by-side type, multi-layered type<br>
and segment pie type composite fibers in which a member<br>
of the above-mentioned resins is located in the surfaces<br>
The polyester resins usable for forming the staple<br>
fibers of the present invention include (1) aromatic<br>
polyesters, for example, polyethylene terephthalate,<br>
polytrimethylene terephthalate, polybutylene<br>
terephthalate, polyhexamethylene terephthalate and<br>
polyethylene naphthalate; (2) polymers and copolymers<br>
comprising poly(a-hydroxycarboxylic acid), for example,<br>

poly(p-propiolactone); (4) poly(p-hydroxyalkanoate)s<br>

component comprising propylene with a minor component<br>
comprising ethylene or an a-olefin, for example, butene-<br>
1, hexene-1, octene-1, or 4-methylpentene-l.<br>
The polyamide resins usable for the staple fibers of<br>
the present invention include nylon 6, nylon 66 or<br>
nylon 12.<br>
The other resins usable for the staple fibers of the<br>
present invention include, for example, high density<br>
polyethylene, medium density polyethylene, high pressureprocessed<br>
low density polyethylene, linear low density<br>
polyethylene, and fluorine-containing resins.<br>
The above-mentioned fiber-forming synthetic resins<br>
optionally contain various additives, for example,<br>
delustering agents, heat stabilizers, anti-foam agents,<br>
tinting agents, flame retardants, antioxidants,<br>
ultraviolet ray-absorbers, fluorescent brightening agents<br>
and coloring pigments.<br>
The staple fibers of the present invention can be<br>
produced by, for example, the following procedures.<br>
Namely, a fiber-forming synthetic resin is meltextruded<br>
through a melt-spinneret for producing filaments<br>
having a desired cross-sectional profile, the extruded<br>
filamentary melt streams are taken up at a speed of 500<br>
to 2000 m/min, to produce undrawn filament yarn. In this<br>
procedure, a single type of polymer or a polymer blend is<br>
used, the resin is melted, the resin melt is extruded<br>
through a melt-spinning hole as shown in Fig. 2(a) or (b)<br>
to produce a fiber having a cross-sectional profile as<br>
shown in Fig. 2(A) or (B). The fiber having the crosssectional<br>
profile as shown in Fig. 2(A) have the same<br>
three concavities as those in the fiber having the crosssectional<br>
profile as shown in Fig. 1. Also, in the<br>
cross-sectional profile as shown in Fig. 2-(B), a single<br>
concavity is formed. The fibers shown in Figs. 2-(A) and<br>
 (B) are formed from a single type of fiber-forming<br>
synthetic resin or a blend of two or more fiber-forming<br>
synthetic resins. In the case of a core-in-sheath type<br>
composite fiber, two types of resins are melted, the two<br>
types of resin melts are combined in a cylindrical nozzle<br>
arranged upstream to the melt-spinning hole to form a<br>
core-in-sheath structure, and the combined melt stream is<br>
extruded through a melt spinneret having melt-spinning<br>
holes as shown in Figs. 3-(d) to (f), to produce<br>
composite fibers having the cross-sectional profiles as<br>
shown in Figs. 3-(D) to (F). Also, in the melt spinning<br>
procedure as mentioned above, a cooling air is blown<br>
toward the resin melt filamentary streams to cool and<br>
solidify the melt streams. In this procedure, the D/L<br>
ratio of the cross-sectional profile of the resultant<br>
fibers can be controlled within the range of from 0.1 to<br>
0.5, by appropriately controlling the flow rate of the<br>
cooling air and the location at which the cooling air<br>
flow comes into contact with the filamentary melt<br>
streams. The resultant undrawn filament yarn is drawn in<br>
air at room temperature or in hot water at a temperature<br>
of 60 to 95°C in a single stage or a plurality of stages,<br>
at a total draw ratio of 1.2 to 5.0. The drawn filament<br>
yarn is oiled with an oiling agent, is optionally crimped<br>
by using a stuffing crimper and, thereafter, is cut into<br>
a desired fiber length, to provide the staple fibers of<br>
the present invention.<br>
The fiber having the cross-sectional profile shown<br>
in Fig. 3-(D) is constituted from a fiber-forming<br>
synthetic resin for forming a core portion 11 and another<br>
fiber-forming synthetic resin for forming a sheath<br>
portion 12, to form a core-in-sheath type composite<br>
structure having three concavities. The fiber having the<br>
cross-sectional profile shown in Fig. 3-(E) is formed<br>
from a core portion 11-forming synthetic resin and a<br>
sheath portion 12-forming synthetic resin different from<br>
each other into a core-in-sheath composite structure<br>
having a single concavity. The fiber having the crosssectional<br>
profile shown in Fig. 3-(F) is constituted from<br>
a core portion 11-forming synthetic resin and a sheath<br>
portion-forming synthetic resin into a core-in-sheath<br>
type composite structure having 8 concavities.<br>
There is no limitation to the composition of the<br>
oiling agent usable for the above-mentioned procedures.<br>
Preferably, an oiling agent comprising 30 to 90% by mass<br>
of an alkalic metal salt of an alkylphosphoric acid<br>
having 10 to 20 carbon atoms and 10 to 70% by mass of a<br>
polydimethylsiloxane and/or a polyoxyethylenepolyoxypropylene-<br>
graft copolymerized polysiloxane, to<br>
promote the opening property of the fibers. Preferably,<br>
the oiling agent is applied at an amount of 0.01 to 5% by<br>
mass. If the application amount of the oiling agent is<br>
less than 0.01% by mass, when the resultant staple fibers<br>
are subjected to an air-laid nonwoven fabric-producing<br>
procedure, static electricity is easily generated, and if<br>
the application amount of the oiling agent is more than<br>
5% by mass, the resultant staple fibers are easily<br>
adhered to each other to form staple fiber bundles, and<br>
thus exhibit a degraded air opening property. When the<br>
staple fibers of the present invention having the<br>
specific irregular cross-sectional profile, as the<br>
contact area of the staple fibers with each other become<br>
small, and the influence of the change in frictional<br>
property of the staple fibers due to the application of<br>
the oiling agent becomes small on the air opening<br>
property of the resultant staple fibers, the variety in<br>
means for impacting a function, for example,<br>
hydrophilicizing function, water-repellent function,<br>
antibacterial function, deodorant function or aromatic<br>
function to the fibers can be expanded.<br>
The melt-spinning holes shown in Fig. 2-(c) and<br>
Fig. 3-(g) are used for producing conventional staple<br>
fibers (comparative) having the cross-sectional profiles<br>
as shown in Fig. 2-(C) and Fig. 3-(G). The cross-<br>
sectional profile shown in Fig. 2-(C) is circular, and in<br>
the core-in-sheath type cross-sectional profile shown in<br>
Fig. 3-(G), a core portion 11 having a circular crosssectional<br>
profile is arranged within a sheath portion 12<br>
having a circular'cross-sectional profile.<br>
To produce an air-laid nonwoven fabric from the<br>
staple fibers of the present invention, a conventional<br>
method can be used. By using the staple fibers of the<br>
present invention, the air-laid nonwoven fabric having a<br>
high quality can be produced. Particularly, the number<br>
of defects which is represented by a total number of nonopened<br>
fiber bundles and fiber pills having a diameter of<br>
5 mm or more, contained in 1 g of the resultant web, is<br>
preferably 10 or less. The term "non-opened fiber<br>
bundles" represents fiber bundles formed from the nonopened<br>
fibers bundled in parallel to each other and<br>
having a cross-sectional major axis of 1 mm or more.<br>
When the staple fibers of the present invention are<br>
used, the number of defects generated during the<br>
production of the air-laid nonwoven fabric is extremely<br>
small, and thus a desired web can be formed with high<br>
stability.<br>
The synthetic staple fibers of the present invention<br>
optionally contains various functional agents, for<br>
example, at least one member selected from deodorant<br>
functional agents, antibacterial functional agents, flame<br>
retardant functional agents and insect-repellent<br>
functional agents. In the staple fibers of the present<br>
invention, the functional agent may be mixed into the<br>
fiber-forming synthetic resin and preferably the<br>
functional agent is applied and fixed to the peripheral<br>
surfaces of the staple fibers.<br>
In the conventional staple fibers for the air-laid<br>
nonwoven fabric, an increase in the application amount of<br>
the functional agent on the staple fiber surfaces,<br>
particularly in an application amount of 0.05% by mass or<br>
more, causes the air opening property of the resultant<br>
staple fibers to be reduced and the quality of the<br>
resultant nonwoven fabric to be degraded. When the<br>
staple fibers of the present invention are used, the air<br>
opening property of the staple fiber is good even when<br>
the functional agent is applied in a large amount as<br>
mentioned above. The reasons for this advantage is<br>
assumed that the functional agent, or a solution or<br>
emulsion thereof is trapped in the concavities formed on<br>
the peripheral surfaces of the staple fibers, and as a<br>
result, the distribution density of the functional agent<br>
adhered to the fiber surfaces is reduced.<br>
In view of the functioning property, the concavities<br>
allow the functional agent to be held in a large amount<br>
in the concavities, and thus, the functional agent can be<br>
held in an amount sufficient to exhibit the desired<br>
function on the surface of the staple fibers. Even when<br>
the functional agent is applied in the state of a liquid,<br>
the resultant functional agent-coated layer on the staple<br>
fiber surfaces exhibit a high resistance to removal<br>
during the formation of the air-laid nonwoven fabric in<br>
which a high speed air flow is applied to the staple<br>
fiber, due to a high surface tension of the coating<br>
layer. Thus, the functional agent layer on the staple<br>
fibers of the present invention exhibit a high<br>
durability. However, if the functional agent is applied<br>
in too a high amount, the air opening property of the<br>
staple fibers may be degraded. The amount of the<br>
functional agent to be imparted to the staple fibers of<br>
the present invention is preferably in the range of from<br>
0.01 to 10% by mass, more preferably from 0.01 to 3% by<br>
mass. In the method for applying and fixing the<br>
functional agent, to evenly drop the functional agent in<br>
the concavities of the staple fibers with a high<br>
efficiency, the functional agent is preferably applied in<br>
the state of a liquid, such as a solution in water or an<br>
organic solvent or an emulsion, prepared by dissolving or<br>
emulsifying the functional agent in the state of a<br>
liquid, paste, or solid in water or an organic solvent<br>
(for example, alcohols or acetone). If the functional<br>
agent is applied in the state of a paste or solid, the<br>
functional agent is distributed in a high distribution<br>
density on portions other than the concavities, of the<br>
staple fibers, and this distribution may cause the air<br>
opening property of the staple fibers to be degraded.<br>
Preferably, the functional agent is applied to the fibers<br>
in the form of a filament tow by a conventional oiling<br>
method, for example, an oiling roller method or spray<br>
method, and then the functional agent-finished filament<br>
tow is cut into staple fibers.<br>
There is no limitation to the type of the functional<br>
agent. The functional agent usable for the present<br>
invention includes surface treatment functional agents<br>
which are difficult to be applied in the state of a blend<br>
with the oiling agent, for example, deodorants,<br>
antibacterial agent, flame retardants and insect (vermin)<br>
repellent agents.<br>
In the deodorants, organic deodorants soluble in<br>
water or an organic solvent and capable of evenly<br>
dispersing are preferably employed rather than inorganic<br>
deodorants. As an example, a liquid extract obtained by<br>
extract-separating from leaf portions of theaceae plants,<br>
for example, camellia. In practice, green Lea dry<br>
distillation extract S-100 (trademark), made by<br>
SHIRAIMATSU SHINYAKU K.K, is usable. To effectively<br>
function, the deodorant is preferably retained in an<br>
amount of 0.01% by mass or more, more preferably 0.02% by<br>
mass or more, on the staple fibers.<br>
The antibacterial agent includes, as an example,<br>
tertiary ammonium antibacterial agents. In practice,<br>
NIKKANON RB (trademark, N-polyoxyethylene-N,N,Ntrialkylammonium<br>
salt), made by NIKKA KAGAKU K.K. is<br>
preferably used. Also, amino glycosides (glycosides of<br>
aminosaccharide with monosaccharide, multi- or<br>
polysaccharide), for example, ST-7, ST-8, ST-9, ST-835,<br>
ST-836, and ST-845 (trademark), made by K.K. BIOMATERIAL,<br>
are preferable examples of the antibacterial agent. To<br>
effectively function, the antibacterial agent is<br>
preferably retained in an amount of 0.01% by mass or<br>
more, more preferably 0.02% by mass or more, on the<br>
staple fibers.<br>
The flame retardants include, for example,<br>
halogenated cycloalkane compounds. The term "halogenated<br>
cycloalkane compounds" includes compounds in which at<br>
least one hydrogen atom in cyclic saturated hydrocarbons,<br>
or saturated hydrocarbon compounds having at least one<br>
cyclic saturated hydrocarbon structure is substituted by<br>
a halogen atom. The halogenated cycloalkane compounds<br>
include, for example, 1,2, 3, 4, 5,6-hexabromocyclohexane,<br>
1,2,3,4- or 1,2,4,6-tetrabromocyclooctane and<br>
1,2,5,6,9,10-hexabromocyclododecane, 1,2-bis(3,4-<br>
dibromocyclohexyl)1,2-dibromoethane, and substituted<br>
compounds in which the bromine atoms in the mentioned<br>
bromocompounds, are substituted by chlorine atoms. The<br>
flame retardants usable for the present invention are not<br>
limited to the above-mentioned compounds. To impart a<br>
good flame retardant property, the halogenated<br>
cycloalkane compounds are preferably retained in an<br>
amount of 0.5% by mass or more on the staple fibers.<br>
The vermin-repellent agents include pyrethroid<br>
components, for example, 3-phenoxybenzyl-dl-cis/trans-3-<br>
(2, 2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethyl-cyclopropane-lcarboxylate<br>
(Common name: Permetrin), (3-<br>
phenoxyphenyl)methyl ester of 2-dimethyl-3-(2-<br>
methylpropenyl)cyclopropane carboxylic acid (Common name:<br>
Phenotrin). To function effectively, the verminrepellent<br>
agent is preferably retained in an amount of<br>
0.01% by mass or more, more preferably 0.1% by mass or<br>
more, on the staple fibers.<br>

40%) under the conditions of the rate of drum rotation of<br>
200 rpm; the number of rotation of a needle roll of 900<br>
rpm; and the transportation speed of the web of 30 m/min.<br>
Ten samples each having a mass of 1 g were randomly<br>
collected from 10 respective sites of the web. For each<br>
sample, the number of non-opened fiber bundles having a<br>
cross-sectional major axis of 1 mm or more) and pills<br>
having a diameter of 5 mm or more per g of the sample,<br>
was counted. The average of the total number of defects<br>
per g of the web sample was calculated. When the number<br>
of defects was 10 or less, the web passed the test.<br>
Example 1<br>
A high density polyethylene (HOPE) having a MFR of<br>
20 g/10 min and a Tm of 131°C and a poly(ethylene<br>
terephthalate) (PET) vacuum dried at 120°C for 16 hours<br>
and having an intrinsic viscosity [r\] of 0.61 and a Tm of<br>
256°C were melted separately from each other by separate<br>
extruders to prepare a polyethylene melt having a<br>
temperature of 250°C and a polyester melt having a<br>
temperature of 280°C. The polyethylene melt was used as a<br>
sheath component A and the polyester melt was used as a<br>
core component B. The sheath component (A) resin melt<br>
streams and the core component B resin melt streams were<br>
combined in a combination mass ratio A:B of 50:50 through<br>
a melt-spinneret for forming a core-in-sheath type<br>
composite yarn having 450 extrusion holes in the form as<br>
shown in Fig. 3(d), to form a core-in-sheath type<br>
composite resin melt streams, and the resultant core-insheaLh<br>
Lype composite streams were melt-extruded through<br>
the spinneret. In this melt-spinning procedure, the<br>
spinneret temperature was established at 280°C, and the<br>
extrusion rate was established at 150 g/min. Then, the<br>
extruded composite filamentary resin melt streams was air<br>
cooled with a cooling air flow having a temperature of<br>
30°C at a location 30 mm below the spinneret, and wound at<br>
a speed of 1,150 m/min, to provide an undrawn filament<br>
yarn. The undrawn filament yarn was drawn at a draw<br>
ratio of 3 in hot water at 75°C. An oiling agent<br>
comprising 80 parts by mass of potassium salt of<br>
laurylphosphoric acid and 20 parts by mass of<br>
polyoxyethylene-modifled silicons was imparted in a<br>
pickup of the oiling agent of 0.22% by mass to the drawn<br>
filament yarn. The oiling agent-applied drawn filament<br>
yarn was crimped with plane zigzag type crimps in the<br>
number of crimps of 17 crimps/25 mm and a percentage of<br>
crimp of 8%, by using a stuffing crimper. The resultant<br>
filament yarn was then dried at 105°C for 60 minutes, and<br>
cut with a rotary cutter into a fiber length of 5 mm.<br>
The resultant staple fibers had a thickness of 1.1 dtex,<br>
and had a cross sectional profile as shown in Fig. 3-(D).<br>

A poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) vacuum dried at<br>
120°C for 16 hours and having an intrinsic viscosity [r\]<br>
of 0.61 and a Tm of 256°C was melted at a temperature of<br>
280°C and the resultant resin melt was extruded through a<br>
melt spinneret having 450 extrusion holes with the form<br>
as shown in Fig. 2-(a). The spinneret temperature was<br>

melt streams were air-cooled by blowing cooling air at<br>
30°C at a location 35 mm below the spinneret, and the<br>
resultant filament bundle were wound at a speed of 1,000<br>
- 25 -<br>

filament yarn was drawn at a draw ratio of 3.2 in hot<br>
water at 70°C, and then further drawn at a draw ratio of<br>
1.15 in hot water at 90°C. The resultant drawn filament<br>
yarn was oiled with an oiling agent comprising potassium<br>
salt of laurylphosphoric acid and polyoxyethylenemodified<br>
silicone in a mass ratio of 80/20 in a pickup of<br>

Example 15<br>
A polyester elastomer (EL) vacuum dried at 35°C for<br>
48 hours, having an intrinsic viscosity [r\] of 0.8 and a<br>
Tm of 152°C, and comprising hard segments comprising a 15%<br>
by mole of isophthalic acid-copolymerized poly(butylene<br>
terephthalate) and the soft segments comprising a<br>
poly(tetramethylene glycol) having an average molecular<br>
weight of 1,500, and a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)<br>
dried at 120°C for 16 hours and having an intrinsic<br>
viscosity [TJ] of 0.61 and a Tm of 256°C, were separately<br>
melted with separate extruders to provide a EL melt<br>
having a temperature of 240°C and a PET melt having a<br>
temperature of 280°C. The EL melt was used for sheath<br>
component A, and the PET melt was used tor a core<br>
component B. The EL melt and the PET melt were extruded<br>
in a mass ratio A/B = 50/50 through a melt-spinneret<br>
having 450 extrusion holes as shown in Fig. 3-(d) for a<br>
core-in-sheath type composite fiber, to form core-insheath<br>
type composite filamentary resin melt streams. In<br>
this procedure, while the spinneret temperature was<br>
controlled to 280°C, and the extrusion rate was controlled<br>
to 310 g/min. Moreover, the extruded filamentary resin<br>
melt streams were air cooled with cooling air at 30°C at a<br>
location 30 mm below the spinneret, and the resultant<br>
undrawn filament yarn was wound at a speed of 1,100<br>
m/min. The resultant undrawn filament yarn was then<br>
drawn at a draw ratio of 2.6 in hot water at 70°C, and<br>
further drawn at a draw ratio of 1.15 in hot water at<br>
90°C. Then the drawn filament yarn was oiled with a<br>
oiling agent comprising potassium salt of<br>
laurylphosphoric acid and polyoxyethylene-modifled<br>
silicone in a mass ratio of 80:20 in a pickup of the<br>
oiling agent 0.25% by mass. The oiled filament yarn was<br>
fed into a stuffing crimper to impart plane zigzag type<br>
crimps at a number of crimps of 8 crimps/25 mm and a<br>
percentage of crimp of 6%. The resultant crimped<br>
filament yarn was then dried at 70°C for 60 minutes, and<br>
cut into a fiber length of 5 mm with a rotary cutter.<br>
The resultant staple fibers had a thickness of 2.5 dtex<br>
and a cross sectional profile as shown in Fig. 3-(D).<br>

filamentary streams. In this procedure, the spinneret<br>
temperature was controlled to 280°C, and the extrusion<br>
rate was controlled to 190 g/min. Moreover, the extruded<br>
filamentary resin melt streams were air cooled with a<br>
cooling air flow at 30°C at a location 30 mm below the<br>
spinneret, and wound the resultant undrawn filament yarn<br>

terephthalate) (PET) vacuum dried at 120°C for 16 hours<br>
and having an intrinsic viscosity [r|] of 0.61 and a Tm of<br>
256°C were melted separately from each other by separate<br>
extruders to prepare a polyethylene melt having a<br>
temperature of 250°C and a polyester melt having a<br>
temperature of 280°C. The polyethylene melt was used as a<br>
sheath component A and the polyester melt was used as a<br>
core component B. The sheath component (A) resin melt<br>
streams and the core component B resin melt streams were<br>
combined in a combination mass ratio A:B of 50:50 through<br>
a melt-spinneret for forming a core-in-sheath type<br>
composite yarn having 450 extrusion holes in the form as<br>
shown in Fig. 3 (d), to form a core-in-sheath type<br>

air cooled with a cooling air flow having a temperature<br>
of 30°C at a location 30 mm below the spinneret, and wound<br>
at a speed of 1,150 m/min, to provide an undrawn filament<br>
yarn. The undrawn filament yarn was drawn at a draw<br>

solution of a deodorant functional agent S-100<br>
(trademark, green tea dry distillation extract, made by<br>
SHIRAIMATSU SHINYAKU K.K.), in a concentration of 10% by<br>
mass was applied to the crimped filament yarn to an<br>
extent such that the aqueous solution is picked up in an<br>
amount of 1% by mass on the filament yarn (a theoretical<br>
