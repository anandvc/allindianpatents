AUTHORING ARBITRARY XML DOCUMENTS USING DHTML AND<br>
XSLT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to authoring extensible markup language (XML) documents using dynamic hypertext markup language (DHTML)<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Extensible markup language (XML) is increasingly becoming the preferred format for transferring data. XML is a tag-based hierarchical language that is extremely rich in terms of the data that it can be used to represent. For example, XML can be used to represent data spanning the, spectrum from semi-structured data (such as one would find in a word processing document) to generally structured data (such as that which is contained in a table). XML is well-suited for many types of communication including business-to-business and client-to-server communication.<br>
Given the breadth of data that can be represented by XML, challenges arise when one wishes to provide a user interface to the data that a user can use to manipulate the data or the structure that contains the data. The classical approach to the user interface problem, outside of the XML environment, has been to use different UI technologies for different types of data (e.g. document, tabular data). This approach is clearly not the best when, with XML, it is more likely that a user will encounter and wish to interact with data that is both structured and unstructured. There have been some attempts at solving the problem of enabling a user to manipulate an XML document, but to date, they are extremely inflexible<br>
&gt;<br><br><br>
and do not appreciate the full power behind XML and XSL-T, the latter being a transformation that could be used to transform XML into Dynamic HTML or DHTML. For more information on XML, XSLT and XSD, the reader is referred to the following documents which are the work of, and available from the W3C (World Wide Web consortium): XML Schema Part 0: Primer, Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0, XML Schema Part 1: Structures, and XSL Transformations (XSLT) Version 1.0.<br>
Consider, for example, Fig. 1 which illustrates an XML document 100, an XSLT transformation (XSL-T) 102, a resultant DHTML document 104, and an XML schema or XSD file 106. XML document 100 can be represented as a tree-like structure where each node of the tree is a corresponding XML tag. The XML document 100 must conform to an XML schema that is specified by XSD 106. XSL-T 102 is a transformation process that utilizes one or multiple templates to transform the XML document tree into a different type of tree—here a DHTML tree. The DHTML document 104 displays the data that is described in the XML tree. XSL-T is simply a collection of templates that enable the data to be presented, through DHTML in a way that can be defined by a software developer.<br>
Consider, for example, an email message that might have several fields, i.e. "subject", "to", and the like. Each of these fields might be represented in XML as tags. For example, the "subject" field might be represented as an XML tag "subj". XSL-T creates an engine that attempts to match a current node to various templates, selects one, and may find within that template mode nodes to match. The XSL-T that transforms the XML representation of the email might include a template that matches the "subj" tag. The template would then list the string that is associated with the "subj" tag, but might place the word "Subject:" before the" string in the DHTML that is ultimately displayed for the user. This is but a very<br><br>
simple example of the transformation process that can take place using XSL-T. XSL-T can also be used to add information to the information that is represented     in an XML document. For example, various headings or other information can be      using XSL-T, with the accompanying data underneath the heading coming from the XML document. Essentially, then, XSL-T provides an extremely robust and flexible way of transforming the data that is described by the XML into a DHTML presentation. One manifestation of XSL-T is that the resultant DHTML structure may bear little resemblance to the corresponding XML-tree structure that contains the data that is used by the XSLT to provide the DHTML.<br>
The transition from XML to DHTML is then accomplished through XSL-T. This is generally a one way transition in which data that is described in XML is transformed into a presentation format for the user. Preserving the user experience of being able to interact with the data through its presentation format (e.g. DHTML) is crucial.   While the transformation from XML to DHTML is fairly straightforward, there has been no clear transformation that would be the inverse of this transformation (i.e. transforming DHTML to XML) in a manner that is flexible and appreciates the full power of XSL-T. That is, while there are simple solutions to this problem, the robust nature of XSL-T and the differences in the corresponding XML and DHTML trees make it extremely difficult to attempt inverse transformation solutions.<br>
 There are solutions that enable a user to enter data in a DHTML document which is then copied back to the XML document. These solutions do not, however, enable a user to change the structure of the XML tree that represents the data. Additionally, there are solutions that are hardcoded solutions that can enable some-manipulation-of the XML tree given a DHTML modification, but the hardcoded nature of the solutions make them very specific to the data and XML<br><br>
tags with which they are used.  For example, one of the XSL-T templates might include a hardcoded solution that allows a user to make structural changes to a table, such as adding a new row.  This hardcoded solution is then only usable in connection with the table for which it was specifically defined.   If a developer wishes to use the hardcoded solution for a different table, they must physically alter the programmatic solution to specifically apply to their situation. There are solutions which enable authorship of arbitrary XML through user-friendly views, but not through DHTML and XSL-T.   Exemplary products include Arbortext's Adept Editor, SoftQuad's XMetal, INRIA's Thot, and FrameMaker's Framemaker for SGML.<br>
[ Accordingly, this invention arose out of concerns associated with providing user interfaces that enable a user to manipulate a DHTML document with the manipulations being transferred back to the XML tree that represents the data of the DHTML presentation in a flexible, repeatable manner.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Methods   and systems  of authoring XML using  DHTML views are described.   Various user interfaces can be automatically or semi-automatically provided in a DHTML view that enable a user to interact with a DHTML view and change values (e.g. text or properties) of an associated DHTML tree.   Value changes are translated to modifications of an associated XML structure.    A transformation, e.g. an XSL-T, is applied to the modified XML structure which then changes the DHTML view to reflect the user's interaction.  The interfaces, some of which are termed "in document" interfaces, permit a user to interact with a "DHTML  view "and  have   value" modifications automatically  made   to a corresponding XML document that describes data that is associated with the<br><br><br>
DHTML view. Presentation of the various "in documenf interfaces takes place by considering not only an XML schema (of which the XML document is an instance), but an XSL-T (XSLT transformation) that was utilized to transform the XML document into the DHTML view.<br>
In addition, the notion of a crystal is introduced and is used to map changes in a DHTML view directly back to a corresponding XML document. A crystal, in a basic form, includes one or more behaviors and associated XSL-T.   In the illustrated example, a behavior is implemented as binary code that is associated with or attached to DHTML tags that are generated by the XSL-T. The crystals are used to transform XML into the DHTML views.   The behaviors of a crystal are defined to be data-shape specific or dependent, with the data shape being defined by the XML document.   The behavior is not necessarily dependent upon any schema, data or tags. Because of its data-shape dependent nature, crystals can be packaged for reuse with various XML documents which have no relation to one another other than a shape that is defined by the XML.<br>
Behaviors can be attached to DHTML tags that are generated by the XSL-T. The behaviors ensure that user interactions with the DHTML view are mapped directly back to the XML document. In this way, the XML document can be authored to reflect the changes that are made to the DHTML view by the user.<br>

Overview<br>
Methods  and systems  of authoring XML using DHTML views  are described. In one implementation, various user interfaces can be automatically or semi-automatically provided in a DHTML view that then enable a user to interact with a DHTML view and change values (e.g. text or properties) of an associated DHTML tree.   Value changes are translated to modifications of an associated XML structure. A transformation, e.g. an XSL-T, is applied to the modified XML structure which then changes the DHTML view to reflect the user's interaction. The interfaces, some of which are termed "in document" interfaces, permit a user to interact with a DHTML view and have those interactions reflected in a corresponding XML document that describes data that is associated with the DHTML view.  These modifications can be made regardless of the complexity of the XSL-T that was utilized to transform the XML into the DHTML. Presentation of the various in document interfaces takes place by considering not only an XML schema (of which the XML document is an instance), but an XSL-T (XSLT transformation) that was utilized to transform the XML document into the DHTML view.<br>
In anotherimpiementation, the notion of a crystal is introduced. A crystal,<br>
in a basic form, includes one or more behaviors and associated XSL-T.   The<br><br><br>
I<br><br>
crystals are used to transform XML into the DHTML views.  The behaviors of a crystal are defined to be data-shape specific or dependent, with the data shape being defined by the XML document.  The behavior is not necessarily dependent upon any schema, data or tags.    Because of its data-shape dependent nature, crystals can be packaged for reuse with various XML documents which have no relation to one another other than a shape that is defined by the XML.   In the described implementation, behaviors are attached to the DHTML tags that are generated by the XSL-T.   The behaviors ensure that user interactions with the DHTML view are mapped directly back to the XML document.  In this way, the XML document can be authored to reflect the changes that are made to the DHTML view by the user.   Because crystals are data shape-dependent and not schema dependent, as the shape is defined by the XML document, they can be used for authoring fragments of XML belonging to different schemas; those fragments simply share the same shape.<br>
In this document, the following terminology will be used:<br>
•	Schema - a file (e.g. an XSD file) describing the schema for a particular type of XML document; schemas typically contain predefined tags and attributes that define the shape of the XML trees that represent an XML document; the schema provides a structure that each XML document must comply with; while editing an XML document, the schema is accessible through an instantiated DOM (document object model) (XDR DOM). Alternately, relevant information can be obtained from the schema and cached for use.<br>
•	XML document - an instance of an XML schema. Theoretically, for one schema there could be an infinite number of documents that instantiate the schema. When editing a document, the initial version and the final version of the document both adhere to the same schema, though the documents themselves are different. While processing, the XML document is instantiated through ah instantiated DOM (XML DOM).      <br><br><br><br>
• XSLT transformation - an XML file that transforms the XML document into an HTML view; for each XML document there could be any number of XSLT transformations, each creating a different HTML view over the same document. An XSL-T file consists of one or more templates that match elements in the XML document. The XSL-T file that is initially authored by the application author is transformed by NetDocs when applied "in edit mode into a NetDocs editing aware XSL-T. This transformation may break out templates into multiple templates, and add the appropriate behaviors (see below) based on NetDocs-specific hints added by the application developer. While editing the XML document, the transformed XSL-T is accessible to NetDocs through an instantiated DOM (XSL-T DOM).<br>
• DHTML view - this is the result of the XSLT transformation applied on the XML document. The DHTML tree contains visual cues for displaying the data, but also behaviors. These behaviors are introduced by the XSLT transformation. While there could be behaviors introduced by the author of the XSLT transformation, there are behaviors introduced by NetDocs when it applies the transformation. These latter behaviors hold the logic for: o   Copying to the XML DOM the values of the HTML leaf nodes that<br>
are modified o Determining, based on the cursor location in the HTML document, what editing services are available in the editing context. The editing context is determined by the HTML context in conjunction with the XSD context and the XSL-T template that was applied to generate that part of the view. The service is made known to the user<br>
■	In-place (in the editing area) for pre-defined UI structures (e.g. table, grid, calendar control, label)<br>
■	Enabling the appropriate XML editing context blocks in the NetDocs ContextBlock area.<br>
o   Modifying the structure of the XML DOM based on the editing<br>
service selected o   Incrementally updating the HTML view, by refreshing just the part<br>
of the view that is affected by the changes to the XML DOM.<br>
Exemplary Computing Environment<br>
The embodiment described just below can be employed in connection with various computer systems. A computer system, for purposes of this document,  can be considered as any computing device that includes some type of processor, i.e. a<br><br><br><br>
microprocessor, and some type of operating system. Thus, a computer system can<br>
be construed to include, without limitation, traditional desktop computers, more<br>
powerful servers, various hand-held devices such as cell phones, pocket-held<br>
computer devices and the like.<br>
	Fig. 2 shows an exemplary computer system that can be used to implement<br>
the  embodiments  described herein.     Computer  130  includes  one or more processors or processing units 132, a system memory 134, and a bus 136 that couples   various   system components  including  the  system  memory  134  to processors 132. The bus 136 represents one or more of any of several types of bus structures, including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, an accelerated graphics port, and a processor or local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures.   The system memory 134 includes read only memory (ROM) 138 and random access memory (RAM) 140. A basic input/output system (BIOS) 142, containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer 130, such as during start-up, is stored in ROM 138.<br>
Computer 130 further includes a hard disk drive 144 for reading from and writing to a hard disk (not shown), a magnetic disk drive 146 for reading from and writing to a removable magnetic disk 148, and an optical disk drive 150 for reading from or writing to a removable optical disk 152 such as a CD ROM or )     other optical media. The hard disk drive 144, magnetic disk drive 146, and optical disk drive 150 are connected to the bus 136 by an SCSI interface 154 or some other appropriate interface.   The drives and their associated computer-readable media  provide   nonvolatile   storage   of computer-readable   instructions,   data structures, program modules and other data for computer 130.   Although the exemplary _ environment described herein employs  a hard disk,  a removable magnetic disk 148 and a removable optical disk 152, it should be appreciated by<br><br>
those skilled in the art that other types of computer-readable media which can store data that is accessible by a computer, such as magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital video disks, random access memories (RAMs), read only memories (ROMs), and the like, may also be used in the exemplary operating      environment.<br>
A number of program modules may be stored on the hard disk 144, magnetic disk 148, optical disk 152, ROM 138, or RAM 140, including an operating system 158, one or more application programs 160, other program modules 162, and program data 164. A user may enter commands and information      into computer 130 through input devices such as a keyboard 166 and a pointing device 168. Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like.   These and other input devices are connected to the processing unit 132 through an interface 170 that is coupled to the bus 136. A monitor 172 or other type of display device is also connected to the bus 136 via an interface, such as a video adapter 174. In addition to the monitor, personal computers typically include other peripheral output devices (not shown) such as speakers and printers.<br>
Computer 130 commonly operates in a networked environment using<br>
logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer<br>
176. The remote computer 176 may be another personal computer, a server, a<br>
router,.a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically<br>
includes many or all of the elements described above relative to computer 130,<br>
although only a memory storage device 178 has been illustrated in Fig. 2. The<br>
logical connections depicted in Fig. 2 include a local area network (LAN) 180 and<br>
a   wide   area   network   (WAN)   182.	Such  networking   environments   are<br><br>
commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets, and the Internet.<br>
When used in a LAN networking environment, computer 130 is connected to the local network 180 through a network interface or adapter 184. When used in a WAN networking environment, computer 130 typically includes a modem 186 or other means for establishing communications over the wide' area network 182, such as the Internet. The modem 186, which may be internal or external, is connected to the bus 136 via a serial port interface 156. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the personal computer 130, or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.<br>
Generally, the data processors of computer 130 are programmed by means of instructions stored at different times in the various computer-readable storage media of the computer. Programs and operating systems are typically distributed, for example, on floppy disks or CD-ROMs.   From there, they are installed or loaded into the secondary memory of a computer. At execution, they are loaded at least partially into the computer's primary electronic memory.   The invention described herein includes these and other various types of computer-readable storage media when such media contain instructions or programs for implementing the steps described below in conjunction with a microprocessor or other data processor.   The invention also includes the computer itself when programmed according to the methods and techniques described below.<br>
For purposes of illustration, programs and other executable program components such as the operating system are illustrated herein as discrete blocks, although it is recognized that such programs and components reside at various<br><br>
times in different storage components of the computer, and are executed by the data processor(s) of the computer.<br>
Exemplary Implementation<br>
The inventive methods and systems discussed below are configured for use in connection with an implementation, aspects of which are described in the documents incorporated by reference above. That implementation essentially provides a single application program having a single navigable window that can be navigated to multiple different functionalities that are provided by the application program. The functionalities are extensible and can be extended via a network such as the Internet.<br>
Use of Schema and XSL-T to Generate a User Interface<br>
When a user interacts with a DHTML document for the purpose of changing, in some way, the document through either manipulation of one or more of its values or properties, it is important that those manipulations be made, in a consistent manner, to the XML document that describes the structure of the data behind the DHTML document. In order to manipulate the XML document that describes the structure of the data behind the DHTML, there needs to be a way to transform user interactions in the DHTML to changes in the XML document. This is the problem of finding an inverse of the transformation function that is provided by the XSL-T.<br>
In one implementation, the described embodiment addresses this problem by automatically (or semi-automatically, with some hint given by the application developer) generating an appropriate user interface  (UI) within  the "DHTML document that allows the user to manipulate or interact with the DHTML<br><br><br><br>
document.    The presentation of the UI takes into account not only the XML<br>
schema, but also the XSL-T transformations that were utilized to provide the DHTML. This represents a significant departure from other XML authoring solutions that look only to the XML schema to determine what can and cannot be added to an XML document. The UIs thus allow user interaction with the DHTML view (e.g. adding and/or deleting structure) to be directly transferred back to the XML document.<br>
There are many various potential types of UIs that can be presented to a user to enable them to interact with a document. Some examples include, without limitation, context blocks which are automatically added to a window based upon the user's context. Context blocks are discussed in more detail in the Application entitled "Task Sensitive Methods And Systems For Displaying Command Sets", incorporated by reference above.    Other forms of UIs can include so-called widgets which are decorations within a document itself that allow a user to interact with the document.   For example, if a document contains a table, there can be additional adornments around the table on which a user can click to add or delete a row or column, or to move items around within the column. Another type of UI is an accelerator which allows interaction through the keyboard. For example, if you press "Control-L" some type of predefined action is implemented.<br>
In this described embodiment, a decision process is undertaken that decides which UIs to present to a user and when to present them. That is, there are potentially a number of different UI choices that can be made depending on what a user is doing in a particular document and where they are in the document. An inventive approach is to utilize a number of different parameters and based upon analysis of the parameters make a decision on which UI to present to a user so that<br><br>
they can interact with the DHTML view.    In the described embodiment, the following parameters can be used:<br>
    Selection of where a user is in a particular DHTML document. This<br>
5	translates to where a user is in a particular XML document because<br>
the  selection  initially starts   on the  DHTML  side  and  has  a correspondence on the XML side;<br>
•	The portion of the XML schema that corresponds to the user's<br>
selection;<br>
	•   The UI types that would be desirable to generate; and<br>
•	The XSL-T file<br>
In the XSL-T file, there are certain constructs that can be suggestive of certain structures in the resultant DHTML. For example, the XSL-T file may include a "xsl:for-each" construct (i.e. for each customer, take a certain action). This construct is suggestive of a repetitive structure in the DHTML, such as a table or a paragraph. That is, if there are a number of customers, then repeating a certain action would repetitively define a certain type of structure. By considering these XSL-T constructs, certain UI types can be identified that can be displayed for the user.<br>
An example is table editing. For example, if expenses are optional, according to the schema, initially there may be no expenses in a table. The XSL-T would have a "for-each" construct to render each expense, but since there are none in the XML doc, nothing is displayed. The UI should in this case produce a context block for adding an expense.<br>
Once the first expense is created, by re-applying the XSLT transformation,<br>
a table is now viewable.  At this point, based on the XSL-T hint that there is a<br>
"for-each" associated with an expense, and the schema information that multiple<br>
"expenses can be added, a decision is made to not show the "Add expense" as a<br><br>
context block, but to add an appropriate in-doc UI that would now take over the functionality of adding additional expenses as new rows to the table.<br>
When addressing the problem of which UI to display for the user to enable interaction with a document, it is desirable to keep the overall appearance that is presented to the user as uncluttered as possible.   For example, many different context blocks could be presented to user, each with its own engagable buttons that can be engaged by a user for interacting with the DHTML view. This is not desirable though because it can potentially clutter the context block area. It would be more ideal to have "in document" UIs (e.g. widget UIs) within a document that are specific to the document itself and which allow a user to interact with the , document.   An "in document" UI is a UI that appears within a portion of the document and enables user interaction with a portion of the document.  Consider, for example, a Word document that contains an embedded drawing.   When the user clicks on the embedded drawing, the drawing can appear within a frame that contains one or more buttons that can be clicked on to manipulate the drawing, e.g. a rotate button to rotate the drawing. The buttons that are associated with the embedded drawing are considered as "in document" UIs.<br>
In order to provide these types of UIs, the described embodiment examines the XSL-T file to identify which UI candidates are more suited to have their functionalities provided by "in document" UIs.<br>
For example, if the schema specifies that multiple expenses are allowed, and the XSL-T has a "for-each" construct for expenses, by looking at the first element introduced by the XSL-T after an expense is matched, it could determine what kind of helpful UI to add. If an DHTML TABLE is created, then it should be 5 adorned with table-editing widgets, but if there is SPAN, for example, then create a context block, and not an in-doc UI.<br><br>
That is, the above-described context blocks are not "in document" because they are provided within a pane that is disposed adjacent a document area within which a user can work on a document. One goal of the described embodiment is to identify UIs, based upon the analysis discussed below, that are the best candidates for incorporation as "in document" UIs that specifically adorn document portions and permit user interaction with the document itself.<br>
Consider that, without taking into account the XSL-T in the analysis of which UIs to present to a user, the only UIs that could be presented would not be in-document UIs.   The context blocks are the most generic UI constructs in the present example.  But if we know that we have a table created in DHTML, then the context blocks can be replaced by in-doc constructs. By inspecting the XSL-T we can find out what DHTML construct is created by the XSLT transformation. That is, without consideration of the XSL-T, only generic UIs, e.g. the context block UIs, would likely be generated. For example, if a user is working within a DHTML document that contains a table, a context block can be provided that enables the user, through manipulation of various "out of document" UIs to manipulate the table, e.g. adding a row, column and the like.  By considering the XSL-T, the UI that is produced can be refined and the context blocks, or at least a portion of the functionality that is provided by the context blocks, can be replaced with other types of in document UIs .  The XSL-T is thus used for refinement of the UIs,<br>
Fig. 3 shows a flow diagram that describes steps in a UI generation method in accordance with this described embodiment. Step 300 makes a selection in a DHTML document. This step is implemented by a user moving their cursor to a particular area within  'a  document. Step 302 determines, based upon the user's selection, the corresponding selection in the XML. document.   For example, if a<br><br>
user has selected a particular portion of a table used to display a specific fragment of the XML document, then this step determines the exact fragment of the XML document that corresponds to the user's selection.   Based on the selection in the XML document, step 304 determines the appropriate place in the XML schema that corresponds to the selection and the various types of actions that can be taken from this selection. The various types of actions correspond to the various ways in which a user might manipulate the portion of the document that they have selected.     Step  306  then produces the appropriate  operations that can be undertaken for the various action types. For example, if the user is working in a table, this step might produce operations for adding a row or column or deleting a row or column.    Once the operations are produced by step 306, step 308 determines, from the XSL-T file, what type of UI to display for the user.   If the XSL-T is not considered in this process, then the available UIs would be presented as context blocks (i.e. not "in document" UIs). By using the XSL-T, the described embodiment refines the production of context blocks by reducing the number of context blocks that are produced and, instead, producing "in document" UIs that now relocate the functionality that would otherwise be provided by the context blocks.<br><br><br>
Manipulation of XML Structures Using Crystals<br>
Recall that one of the benefits of XML is the richness with which data can be described. XML, by its very nature, can provide a wide variety of variations of data. Because of this, UI solutions for interacting with data (displayed in DHTML using XSL-T) have been hardcoded and specific to individual schemas. This is a manifestation of the ease with which hardcoded solutions can be provided through XSL-T.<br>
"In one described embodiment, the notion of a crystal is introduced to enable interactions with a DHTML view to be directly mapped back to the XML file or tree. Advantageously, the crystals are configured to work on various data shapes, independent of the XML schemas. This means that when the data has a particular shape, as defined by the XML tree that contains the data, specific crystals that are configured for that particular shape can be used to render the DHTML and also ensure that user interactions with the DHTML view are directly mapped back to the XML tree. The crystals do not care about the specific data that is provided by the data shape, nor the schema or tags that are used to contain the data.<br>
Consider, for example, Fig. 4 which shows an XML document 400, a crystal 402 and the resultant DHTML document 404. In one basic form, a crystal comprises one or more behaviors 406 and the basic XSL-T 408 that is utilized to transform the XML into the DHTML.   The behaviors are implemented, in this particular example, as binary code that is associated with or attached to the DHTML tags that are generated by the XSL-T.    Consider, for example, the hierarchical tree  that is  shown directly below XML document 400.     This hierarchical tree represents a portion of an XML tree that is maintained in memory. In this example, the tree has a "products" root node and a "product 1" node that is a child of the "products" root node.   Underneath the "product 1" node are three<br><br>
children nodes labeled "name", "quantity", and "price". This XML tree may thus represent a portion of a purchase order that is utilized to purchase various products. When rendered by the crystal 402, the resulting DHTML view is shown at 410. This DHTML view is diagrammed directly above view 410 as a tree with a behavior associated with a DHTML tag. The DHTML view is essentially a table that contains data that is provided by the XML document. Assume now that a user wishes to modify the purchase order by adding an additional product with a corresponding quantity and price.  In the past, the solution to this problem might be to hardcode a function that added a specific "product tag" to the XML and then, correspondingly, to the DHTML view. This is a very inflexible solution that is tied specifically to the schema and tags of the XML document.    In the described example, modification of the XML document takes place via the behavior or behaviors that are associated with the crystal 402. Specifically, the behavior that is defined for this particular XML tree structure includes the modifications that can be made to the XML document and a mapping that maps the changes to the DHTML view using application of XSL-T. This behavior is data shape-dependent and not schema- or data-dependent.<br>
This is diagrammatically illustrated in Fig. 4 by the DHTML tree structure shown underneath the DHTML view 404. There, a node corresponding to the "product" node is shown adorned with a behavior. This behavior is binary code that enables a user to interact, via an appropriate UI (such as an in document "add product" button 411 attached to the table) with the DHTML view and have any defined modifications made by the user mapped back to the appropriate XML tree. When a user interacts with the DHTML view, the XML tree is structurally manipulated (as by adding the appropriate tags and structure), and then the XSL-T is invoked to redisplay the DHTML view.<br><br>
In the purchase order example, assume that the user adds a new product to the DHTML view table by clicking on "add producf button 411 which adds a new row to table 410. In this example, when the new product is added, the behavior or binary code maps the modification back to the XML tree and incorporates the modification by making a structural change to the XML tree. In this specific example, the structural change would include adding a branch to the XML tree to represent the newly-added product. This added branch is shown as the dashed branch on the "Products" XML tree.<br>
Consider the second XML tree 412 shown directly below the Products XML tree.  That tree is an "Addresses" XML tree and is associated with addresses that might appear in an address book.   This data is extremely different from the data that is associated with the Products XML tree. In fact, there is no relation at all between the data. Notice, however, that the Addresses XML tree has the same shape as the XML tree appearing directly above it. In the described embodiment, a similar crystal can be used to render a DHTML address book that contains entries for a name, street and zip code. The crystal would likely contain slightly different XSL-T for labeling purposes, but can contain the same exact behavior that was utilized in the above example to manipulate the structure of the Products XML tree.   To this extent, a user interface button 411 is provided on the Address table and includes the same behavior as the user interface button associated with the Products table.   Thus, when a user adds an entry to their address book, the behavior, or binary code, that is associated with the DHTML "Address" tag would ensure that any changes made to the DHTML view are mapped directly back to the corresponding XML document.<br>
The crystals can advantageously be prepackaged software containers that include the behaviors that are specific to the shape of the data and not necessarily<br><br><br>
dependent upon the schema or specific data that may be contained by an XML document.     This approach is very well suited to handling complex XSLT transformations which naturally flow from the robustness that XSL-T provides. By incorporating and associating behaviors  in the DHTML tree, problems associated  with  handling   complex  XSLT transformations   insofar   as  XML authoring is concerned are solved. This approach is extremely flexible and is not tied to any one schema or specific data, as were the solutions in the past.  This approach also provides the application developer with the ability to develop complex XSL-T, without worrying about how the underlying XML is going to be manipulated responsive to a user manipulating the DHTML document.   Further, because the approach utilizes crystals having behaviors that are specific to data shape and not specific to schema or data, the crystals are reusable across any XML documents that have shapes that correspond to the shapes for which the various crystals were designed.<br>
Fig. 5 is a flow diagram that shows steps in a method in accordance with the embodiment described above.    Step 500 defines multiple crystals each of which include one or more behaviors.   In the described example, behaviors are implemented as binary code. The behaviors are specific to a data shape and do not depend on a schema or specific data. Step 502 uses one or more of the crystals to render a DHTML view from an XML document.   Step 504 attaches at least one behavior to a DHTML tag.  The behavior ensures that any modifications that are made to the DHTML view are mapped back to and appropriately change the XML document that contains the data in the DHTML view.  Step 506 interacts with the DHTML view in some way, based upon user input via a UI.   This step can be implemented by a user interacting with some type of structure, for example a table, within the DHTML view.   Responsive to the user interaction with the DHTML<br><br>
view, step 508 uses the behavior to map the user's interaction back to the XML document and make the appropriate structural changes in the XML tree that contains the data. For example, the XML branch in Fig. 4 off of the "Products" node, indicated with a dashed line, might be the result of a user who adds a new       product to the purchase order provided in the DHTML view.<br>
Example<br>
The above approach is very flexible and can be conveniently used by application developers to provide applications.    Assume that an independent software vendor (ISV) develops applications for end users and he wants to construct a purchase order.  The ISV can select an appropriate XML schema for the purchase order which would then define the types of tags that the purchase order can contain. The ISV would need to write the appropriate XSL-T that could present the purchase order in DHTML in a ISV-defined manner. Perhaps the ISV wants to make the purchase order specific to a particular company.   The XSL-T provides a way for the ISV to do this. That is, each ISV may wish to present their data differently in a way that is specific to the ISV. Thus, while they each may use the same schema, there will be many different instances of the schema each of which can be potentially very different from the others.  One goal of the crystal-based implementation discussed above, is that it should be very easy for ISVs to develop applications based on XML.   Accordingly, when the ISV writes their XSL-T, they can incorporate various behaviors that are provided by multiple different crystals.   These crystals are predefined so that the ISV need not worry about defining them.  They can simply select the crystals that are appropriate for their shape of data, and incorporate them with XSL-T.   Now, when the XML is<br><br><br>
transformed into DHTML, user interactions with the DHTML view can be mapped to the underlying XML document.<br>
