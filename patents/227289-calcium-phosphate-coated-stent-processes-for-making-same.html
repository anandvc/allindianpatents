				<td>CALCIUM PHOSPHATE COATED IMPLENTABLE MEDICAL DEVICE<br>
AND PROCESSES FOR MAKING SAME<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to novel calcium phosphate-coated implantable medical<br>
devices and processes of making same. The unique calcium-phosphate coated<br>
implantable medical devices minimize immune response to the implant. The coated<br>
implantable devices have the capability to store and release one or more medicinally<br>
active agents into the body in a controlled manner.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cardiovascular stents are widely used in coronary angioplasty procedures to enlarge<br>
coronary arteries and thereby allow better blood circulation. Typically this is<br>
accomplished by a balloon angioplasty procedure wherein a contracted stent, usually<br>
in the form of a metallic mesh tube, is moved in to the site of blood vessel narrow-<br>
ing along a guide wire. Once the stent is in place an internally situated balloon<br>
expands it radially. After expansion the balloon is deflated and removed from vessel<br>
while the stent remains expanded in place. The stent thus provides a scaffold<br>
support for the walls of the blood vessel, enlarging the vessels aperture and increas-<br>
ing blood flow. This operation saves millions of lives annually around the world.<br>
Unfortunately the placement of metallic stents often leads to harmful side effects. A<br>
relatively large proportion of patients (up to half of the population, according to<br>
some statistics) experience an immune response to the implanted stent called<br>
inflammatory restenosis, and other negative effects, which lead to a re-narrowing of<br>
the vessel. This typically requires repeat surgical treatment within 1-2 years of the<br>
original balloon angioplasty operation.<br>
The mechanisms that lead to restenosis and other immune responses associated with<br>
the implantation of a medical device are initiated by damage to the vessel lining<br>
during the surgical procedure. Such damage is very difficult to avoid entirely, but<br>
its effects, i.e. inflammation and/or infection, may be diminished through modifica-<br>
tions to the surface of metallic implantable medical devices. The most common<br>
surface modification of implanted medical devices is the application of a thin<br>
polymer film coating. These coatings are frequently impregnated with medically<br>
active agent(s) such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents and other, more<br>
complex drugs. These medically active agents are released from the coating<br>
through leaching to the arterial wall and the blood stream, often aided by dissolution<br><br>
of the carrier film. Typically, biodegradable polymers such as polylactic acid,<br>
polyglycolic acid, and others, frequently in combination with heparin and other<br>
anti-thrombogenic agents, are selected in such drug delivery systems. A particular<br>
advantage of the polymer coatings on stents is that the coatings are flexible and<br>
generally non-thrombogenic.<br>
In the past, polymeric materials have been used for drug delivery control and have<br>
enjoyed substantial clinical success for certain drug systems. Unfortunately, even<br>
biodegradable polymers, although more bio-frendly than the native metallic<br>
surface, are still recognized by living tissue as foreign objects. Therefore the<br>
bio-degradation process is frequently accompanied by inflammatory response of the<br>
tissue. In some critical applications, such as cardiovascular stents, it has been<br>
determined that polymer coated stents do not perform according to expectations in<br>
longer term (in excess of 1 year) of use. Furthermore, in many instances relatively<br>
rapidly resorbing polymer coatings are quickly depleted from the stent surface with<br>
concomitant loss of the long-term affects of the drug and harmful exposure of me<br>
bare metal surface to contact tissue. This may result in an adverse response of the<br>
tissue, leading to inflammation, restenosis (in the case of stents), and requiring<br>
repetitive surgical intervention.<br>
There is therefore a strong need to discover materials for coating implantable<br>
medical devices that are entirely biocompatible and thus do not cause any adverse<br>
effects in the tissue. Furthermore, ideally this coating material will be able to<br>
deliver one or more pharmaceutically active agents to a targeted site. Studies have<br>
shown that porous coatings may accept the required load of drugs through adsorp-<br>
tion and then release the drugs in a controlled manner. The drug release process is<br>
dependant on surface properties of the coating material and the adsorption proper-<br>
ties, molecular size, and other characteristics of the drug.<br>
One group of materials exhibiting desired characteristics has been known for a long<br>
time, and is used extensively for the surface modification of large rigid implants<br>
such as artificial hips in the human body. These materials are members of the<br>
family of calcium phosphates (CaP) and include hydroxy apatite (HA), di- and<br>
tri-calcium phosphates, as well as partially or fully amorphous calcium phosphates.<br>
These materials are mineral components of hard tissue and as such are fully<br>
bio-compatible and bio-resorbable with no side effects. Calcium phosphate, in<br>
particular hydroxyapatite (HA), is a principal inorganic component of bone, and<br><br>
thus offers entirely new perspectives for coating-based drug encapsulation and drug<br>
delivery systems.<br>
Hydroxyapatite ceramics, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, belong to the class of calcium phos-<br>
phate (CaP) based bioactive materials that are used for a variety of biomedical<br>
applications, including matrices for drug release control [M. Itokazu et al.,<br>
Biomaterials, 19,817-819,1998; F. Minguez et al Drugs Exp. Clin. Res., 16[5],<br>
231-235,1990; W. Paul and C. P. Sharma, J. Mater. Sci. Mater. Med., 10,<br>
383-388,1999], Other members of the CaP family, such as dicalcium phosphate<br>
(CaHPO4.H2O) or tricalcium phosphate (Ca3(PO4)2), have also been used for<br>
similar purposes. The CaP family of materials has been long recognized as having<br>
a high degree of biocompatibility with human tissue.<br>
The use of calcium phosphate coatings, including HA coatings, thermally deposited<br>
on implantable devices has been limited by the fact that such coatings used to date<br>
have had thicknesses of &gt; 0.01 mm and have exhibitedbrittle behaviour when in<br>
bulk form. This characteristic has limited their use to applications where a solid<br>
support structure, such as dental or hip implant, does not allow for much deforma-<br>
tion of the structure. In such cases, the potential for coating damage is limited and<br>
osseo-integration with the tissue occurs in an improved manner. HA coated<br>
implants in particular have been shown to possess excellent biocompatibility and<br>
provide accelerated integration of the implant with the surrounding tissue. The<br>
bio-resorption rate of such coatings can be controlled through adjustment of their<br>
crystallinity and chemical composition, e.g. by the incorporation of carbonate<br>
groups and other methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
A method alternative to thermal coating is the biomimetic deposition of HA films at<br>
room temperature (BM-HA). This technique has been used for a variety of biomedi-<br>
cal applications, for example drug delivery [H. B. Wen et al, J. Biomed. Mater.<br>
Res., 41, 227-36,1998; S. Lin and A. A. Campbell, US Pat 5958430, 1999; D. M.<br>
Liu et al J. Mater. Sci. Mater. Med., 5, 147-153,1994; K. de Groot et al, J.<br>
Biomed. Mater. Res., 21, 1375-1381,1987]. This forming mechanism is driven by<br>
supersaturation of Ca2+ and PO43-, under appropriate solution pH, where HA is the<br>
most stable phase. As the process proceeds at or near room temperature, the<br>
apatitic crystals which form through nucleation and growth may incorporate<br>
biologically active species, such as antibiotics, anti-cancer drugs, anti-inflammatory<br>
agents, etc. The deposition rates for BM-HA are in the range of 0.05-0.5/μm/h.<br><br>
This relatively low deposition rate may be enhanced significantly if electric field is<br>
applied to the metallic substrate being coated, e.g. stent, in a solution containing<br>
proper concentration of calcium and phosphorous ions. This variant of coating is<br>
usually referred to as Electro-Chemical Deposition (ECD), and the resulting film<br>
termed as ECD-HA. As ECD also proceeds at (or near) room temperature, drug<br>
encapsulation is also possible in ECD-HA. The physiological solutions for BM-HA<br>
formation are naturally water-based, which makes it impossible to encapsulate<br>
hydrophobic bioactive agents into BM-HA coatings. The biomimetic HA films (both<br>
BM-HA and ECD-HA) may be deposited on implantable medical devices at room<br>
temperature, which is of great advantage for drug encapsulation during deposition.<br>
Unfortunately, the bonding strength BM-HA and ECD-HA to metallic surfaces is<br>
generally significantly lower than that of sol-gel HA (termed here SG-HA). At the<br>
same time, bonding strength of BM-HA or ECD-HA to previously consolidated<br>
hydroxyapatite is high, generally in excess of 40 MPa. In this respect building<br>
additional BM-HA or ECD-HA film on top of the already existing, well-bonded to<br>
the metallic substrate film of SG-HA provides a novel and inventive route to<br>
achieve high bonding strength, controlled porosity, and drug encapsulation capabil-<br>
ity of the films deposited at room temperature.<br>
Another alternative for room (or near-room) temperature deposition of porous<br>
calcium phosphate films, in particular hydroxyapatite, for drug impregnation and<br>
encapsulation, is so-called calcium phosphate cement (CPC) route. In this previ-<br>
ously disclosed process (refer to US Patent Application No. US2002/0155144 Al<br>
"Biofunctional Hydroxyapatite Coatings and Microspheres for in-situ Drug Encap-<br>
sulation", by T. Troczynski, D. Liu, and Q. Yang), fine particles of calcium<br>
phosphate precursor Ca(OH)2 and calcium phosphate salt monocalcium phosphate<br>
anhydrate, are milled and mixed in ethanol, followed by film deposition and<br>
impregnation by sodium phosphate solution (refer to the Example 4 below for<br>
details of this procedure). As a result of this process, microporous,<br>
semi-amorphous CPC-HA results, suitable for delivering drugs through leaching<br>
and during film resorption. Similarly as above, CPC-HA film bonds poorly to<br>
metallic surfaces, such as those of implants or stents. However, CPC-HA film<br>
deposited on previously consolidated surface of HA, such as SG-HA, achieves high<br>
bonding strength, generally in excess of 40 MPa. In this respect building additional<br>
CPC-HA film on top of the already existing, well-bonded to the metallic substrate<br>
film of SG-HA provides a novel and inventive route to achieve high bonding<br><br>
strength, controlled porosity, and drug encapsulation capability of the films depos-<br>
ited at room temperature.<br>
Electric field-assisted thin film deposition technologies have the great advantage of<br>
the resulting film uniformity, especially for complex substrates such as stents. One<br>
such technology termed Electro-Phoretic Deposition (EPD) is well known method in<br>
ceramic processing. In this method fine particles of a ceramic (generally about a<br>
micrometer or less in size) suspended in a liquid attain electric charge through<br>
interaction with the liquid or through addition to the suspension of surface-active<br>
species. The simplest example of such EPD system is oxide (or hydroxide, such as<br>
hydroxyapatite) ceramic powder suspended in water and acid (such as nitric acid)<br>
mixture. In such environment protons will have a tendency to absorb on surface of<br>
the ceramic particles, providing positive charge to the particles. Upon application<br>
of electric field, such charged particles would migrate to the negative electrode<br>
(cathode). Exactly opposite would happen in basic environment, i.e. negatively<br>
charged particles of ceramic would migrate to the positive electrode (anode). EPD<br>
is an excellent technique for deposition of ceramic films, including calcium phos-<br>
phate films, as disclosed in US Pat. No. 5,258,044, dated Nov. 2, 1993 ("Electro-<br>
phoretic Deposition of Calcium Phosphate Material on Implants", by D.D. Lee).<br>
Unfortunately, EPD films must be sintered at relatively high temperature to gain<br>
sufficient structural integrity. For example, the EPD films of calcium phosphate<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,258,044, had to be sintered at between 600°C and<br>
1350°C. These temperatures are high enough to induce substantial change to the<br>
metallic substrate, e.g. in terms of surface oxidation or microstructural changes<br>
(e.g. grain growth).<br>
Drug encapsulation in HA has been achieved in the past by simple<br>
post-impregnation of a sintered, porous HA ceramic [K. Yamamura et al, J.<br>
Biomed. Mater. Res., 26, 1053-64,1992]. In this process, the drug molecules<br>
simply adsorb onto the surface of the porous ceramic. The drug release is accom-<br>
plished through desorption and leaching of the drug to the surrounding tissue after<br>
exposure to physiological fluid. Unfortunately, most of the adsorbed drug molecules<br>
release from such system in a relatively short period of time. Impregnation of drug<br>
material into porous sintered calcium phosphate microspheres has been reported in<br>
the patent literature. "Slow release" porous granules are claimed in U.S. Patent<br>
5,055,307 [S. Tsuru et al, 1991], wherein the granule is sintered at 200-1400°C and<br>
the drug component impregnated into its porosity. "Calcium phosphate<br><br>
microcarriers and microspheres" are claimed in WO 98/43558 by B. Starling et al<br>
[1998], wherein hollow microspheres are sintered and impregnated with drugs for<br>
slow release. D. Lee et al. [WO98/16209] claim poorly crystalline apatite wherein<br>
macro-shapes harden and may simultaneously encapsulate drug material for slow<br>
release. It has been suggested to use porous, composite HA as a carrier for<br>
gentamicin sulfate (GS), an aminoglycoside antibiotic to treat bacterial infections at<br>
infected osseous sites [J. M. Rogers-Foy et al, J. Inv. Surgery 12 (1997) 263 -<br>
275]. The presence of proteins in HA coatings did not affect the dissolution<br>
properties of either calcium or phosphorus ions and that it was solely dependent on<br>
the media [Bender S. A. et al. Biomaterials 21 (2000) 299-305].<br>
Stents are disclosed in several patent publications. U.S. patent publication No.<br>
2002/0007209 Al, published January 17, 2002, de Sheerder et al., discloses an<br>
expandable metal tube prosthesis with laser cuts in the walls. The prosthesis can be<br>
coated with titanium nitride (TiN) for bio-compatibility. The holes in the walls of<br>
the prosthesis can be used to locally administer medicines and the like.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,387,121 Bl, issued May 14, 2002, Alt, assigned to Inflow<br>
Dynamics Inc., discloses a stent constructed with a tubular metal base. The stent<br>
can be constructed to have three layers (see Figure 2). The first layer 15 is typi-<br>
cally 316L stainless steel. The intermediate layer 50 is formed of a noble metal or<br>
an alloy thereof, preferably selected from a group consisting of niobium, zirconium,<br>
titanium and tantalum (see column 7, lines 58-61). The third or outer layer 80 is<br>
preferably composed of a ceramic-like metal material such as oxide, hydroxide or<br>
nitrate of metal, preferably iridium oxide or titanium nitrate, as a bio-compatible<br>
layer that serves as a primary purpose to avoid tissue irritation and thrombus<br>
formation.<br>
EP 0 950 386 A2, published October 20, 1999, Wright et al., assigned to Cordis<br>
Corporation, discloses a thin walled stent which is formed as a cylinder with a<br>
plurality of struts. The struts have channels formed therein. Therapeutic agents can<br>
be deposited in the channels. Rapamycin specifically is mentioned as a therapeutic<br>
agent which can be deposited in the channels to prevent restenosis (re-narrowing) of<br>
an artery.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to an implantable medical device with a calcium phosphate<br>
coating comprising: (a) stent; and (b) calcium phosphate coating on the stent, said<br>
coating having desired bonding and porosity characteristics.<br>
The calcium phosphate coating of the device can be hydroxyapatite. The thickness<br>
of the calcium phosphate coating can be between about 0.00001 mm and 0.01 mm,<br>
and preferably about 0.001 mm to 0.0001 mm. The tensile bond strength between<br>
the substrate and the calcium phosphate coating can be greater than about 20 MPa.<br>
The calcium phosphate coating can be deposited on the device as particles having a<br>
diameter between about 1 μm. and 100 μm and a thickness of between about 1 μm to<br>
10 μm. The particles can cover about 20% to about 90% of the surface of the<br>
substrate.<br>
The stent of the implantable medical device can be constructed of stainless steel, cobalt<br>
alloy, titanium cobalt-chromium or metallic alloy. The calcium phosphate coating can<br>
be porous and the pores can retain a drug. The rate of release of the drug from the pores<br>
can be controlled in an engineered manner.<br>
The substrate can have a first calcium phosphate coating and a second calcium<br>
phosphate coating and the drug can be contained in both the first and the second<br>
coating or only in one coating. The drug can be one which inhibits restenosis. The<br>
calcium phosphate coating can be dicalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate or<br>
tetracalcium phosphate. The device can be a human or animal tissue implantable<br>
device. The device can be a stent which is coated with calcium phosphate.<br>
The invention is also directed to a process of coating an implantable medical device<br>
with a calcium phosphate coating comprising: (a) hydrolyzing a phosphor precursor<br>
in a water or alcohol based medium; (b) adding a calcium salt precursor to the<br>
medium after the phosphite has been hydrolyzed to obtain a calcium phospate gel;<br>
(c) depositing the calcium phosphate gel as a coating on the surface of a substrate;<br>
and (d) calcining the calcium phosphate coating at a suitable elevated temperature<br>
and for pre-determined time to obtain a crystallized calcium phosphate having<br>
desired crystallinity, bonding and porosity characteristics.<br><br>
The deposition of the coating on the substrate can be performed by aerosol deposi-<br>
tion, dip-coating, spin-coating, electrophospate coating or electrochemical coating.<br>
The calcium phosphate coating can be calcined at a temperature of at least about<br>
350°C. The calcium phospate gel can be hydroxyapatite gel.<br>
The porosity of the calcium phosphate coating can be controlled and can retain a<br>
drug. The rate of release of drug can be controlled. The calcium phosphate coating<br>
can be hydroxyapatite, dicalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate or tetracalcium<br>
phospate.<br>
The phosphate precursor can be an alkyl phosphite or a triethyl phosphate. The<br>
calcium precursor can be a water-soluble calcium salt. The water soluble calcium<br>
salt can be calcium nitrate.<br>
The invention is also directed to a process of coating a soft tissue implantable device<br>
with a calcium phosphate coating comprising: (a) providing a soft tissue<br>
implantable substrate; (b) depositing a calcium phosphate coating on the substrate<br>
utilizing a biomimetic deposition process; or (c) depositing the calcium coating on<br>
the substrate utilizing a calcium phosphate cement deposition process; or (d)<br>
depositing the calcium phosphate coating on the substrate utilizing an electro-<br>
phoretic deposition process; or (e) depositing a calcium phosphate coating on the<br>
substrate utilizing an electrochemical deposition process.<br>
The device can be a calcium phosphate coated stent. The calcium phosphate coating<br>
can be hydroxyapatite. The calcium phosphate coating can be deposited disconlinu-<br>
ously on the substrate as discrete particles.<br>
A first calcium phosphate coating can be deposited on the substrate utilizing an<br>
aerosol-gel process, a sol-gel process or an electro-phoretic deposition process or an<br>
electro-chemical deposition process and a second calcium phosphate coating can be<br>
deposited on the first coating or the substrate utilizing an aerosol-gel process, a sol-<br>
gel process, a biomimetic process, a calcium phosphate cement process, an electro-<br>
phoretic deposition process or an electrochemical deposition process.<br>
The calcium phosphate coating can contain and elude a drug. The calcium phos-<br>
phate coating can be coated with a hydrogel film. The calcium phosphate can be<br>
deposited on the substrate as discontinuous non-equiaxial particles. The non-<br><br>
equiaxial particles can have an average size of about 0.1 μm and a thickness up to<br>
about 0.01 mm. The first and second coatings can contain a drug.<br>
The ratio of calcium to phosphate in the sol-gel precursor can be engineered to<br>
enable various phosphate phases to be obtained. The calcium phosphate phase can<br>
be hydroxyapatite, dicalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate or tetracalcium<br>
phospate.	ACCOMPANYING<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Throughout the following description specific details are set forth in order to<br>
provide a more thorough understanding of the invention. However, the invention<br>
may be practiced without these particulars. In other instances, well known elements<br>
have not been shown or described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the<br>
present invention. Accordingly, the specification and drawings are to be regarded<br>
in an illustrative, rather than a restrictive, sense.<br>
The invention in one embodiment is directed to implantable medical devices with a<br>
flexible thin film calcium phosphate bio-compatible and bio-resorbable coating that<br>
has the ability to act as a high capacity drug carrier. Such CaP coatings have no<br>
side-effects during coating dissolution into body fluids, and can be designed with a<br>
high level of control of coating dissolution rate and microstructure, which also<br>
determine the drug retention and release characteristics.<br>
Of all the types of implantable medical devices that exist, me coronary stents<br>
utilized in balloon angioplasty procedures provide a useful model for testing the<br>
effectiveness of sol-gel deposited thin flexible CaP coatings on such stents due to<br>
the fact that such stents are designed to be flexible. The use of such stents in the<br>
examples below sihould not however, be considered as limiting the application of<br>
the CaP coatings described only to stenys. The invention has broad application to<br>
virtually any type of body implantable device.<br>
We have determined unexpectedly that the intrinsic brittle behaviour of CaP ceases<br>
to limit me system strain capability if the strongly bonded coating is sol-gel depos-<br>
ited and is thinner than approximately 0.001mm. Experiments involving repeated<br>
contraction/expansion of such thin CaP sol-gel coated stents reveal that there is no<br>
separation of the coating from the stent, nor visible damage to the coating, if the<br>
coating is thinner than about 0.001mm and is strongly bonded to the substrate (the<br>
tensile bond strength should be larger than about 40MPa, as measured in model<br>
strength experiments according to ASTM C-633 standard).<br>
In addition, we have discovered that if the novel sol-gel process for deposition of<br>
calcium phosphates, in particular hydroxyapatite (HA) synthesis (as previously<br>
disclosed in our US Pat. No. 6,426,114 Bl, Jul. 30, 2002, "Sol-Gel Calcium<br><br>
Phosphate Ceramic Coatings and Method of Making Same", by T. Troczynski and<br>
D. Liu) is used, the resulting thin flexible coating has controlled porosity which<br>
may be utilized to retain drugs within the coating, and release the drugs at a<br>
controlled rate.<br>
The invention pertains to a sol-gel (SG) process for synthesis of calcium phosphate,<br>
in particular, hydroxyapatite (HA), thin film coatings on implantable medical<br>
devices. The process allows the HA to be obtained in a controlled crystallized form,<br>
at a relatively low temperatures, i.e. starting at = 350°C. This is an unexpectedly<br>
low crystallization temperature for HA sol-gel synthesis. The process provides<br>
excellent chemical and physical homogeneity, and bonding strength of HA coatings<br>
to substrates. The low process temperature avoids substrate metal degradation due<br>
to thermally-induced phase transformation, microstructure deterioration, or oxida-<br>
tion.<br>
Disclosed herein is a method wherein uniform films of hydroxyapatite by the<br>
electro-phoretic deposition (EPD) method (EPD-HA) are deposited on complex<br>
stent surface, and there is no need to pursue sintering in excess of 500°C to achieve<br>
substantial structural integrity of the film and its high bonding strength to the<br>
metallic substrate. In this method, the first step is me well-known EPD of the HA<br>
film, for example as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,258,044, using suspension of<br>
sub-micrometer particles of HA in water. This film is dried and then heat treated at<br>
500°C for 10-60 minutes to initiate sintering of HA. The film is still too weak and<br>
too poorly bonded for practical use as a coating on stent or other medical device or<br>
implant, but is sufficiently strong to survive the subsequent processing step compris-<br>
ing impregnation by aero-sol-gel HA droplets. The droplets penetrate porosity of<br>
the previously deposited EPD-HA, strongly aided by the capillary suction. Thus,<br>
majority of the pores of the EPD-HA film are penetrated by the sol-gel precursor of<br>
HA, all the way to the metallic substrate. This composite film can be now dried<br>
and sintered at a relatively low temperature or 400-500°C, due to the very high<br>
activity of the sol-gel component of the film. The sol-gel film bonds the particles of<br>
HA deposited by EPD, and bonds well to the metallic substrate during the heat<br>
treatment Thus, both the film uniformity (due to EPD process) and low-temperature<br>
sinterabiliry (due to sol-gel process) have been achieved. This novel and inventive<br>
hybrid technology for uniform HA coatings on stents has the ability to produce<br>
films in thickness range from about 1 micron to above 100 microns, with porosity<br>
in the range from about 10 vol% to about 70 vol%. Such porous thick HA films<br><br>
are excellent carriers for drugs loaded through impregnation into open porosity of<br>
the film. Details of such hybrid process, and its several variants, for preparation of<br>
HA films on stents, are given in the examples below.<br>
Problems with drug delivery in vivo are frequently related to the toxicity of the<br>
carrier agent, the generally low loading capacity for drugs, and the aim to control<br>
drug delivery resulting in self-regulated, timed release. With the exception of<br>
colloidal carrier systems, which support relatively high loading capacity for drugs,<br>
most organic systems deliver inadequate levels of bioactive drugs. Sol-gel films<br>
heat-treated at relatively low temperatures closely resemble the properties of<br>
colloidal films, in terms of accessible surface area and porosity size.<br>
The sol-gel process according to the invention allows the calcium phosphate to be<br>
obtained in a crystallized form, at relatively low temperature, i.e. approximately<br>
350-500°C. Variation of the heat treatment temperature and time provides for<br>
control of coating crystallinity (i.e. a more amorphous, more easily resorbable<br>
coating can be processed at lower temperatures) as well as coating porosity (higher<br>
porosity and smaller average pore size at lower temperatures). Variation of Ca/P<br>
ratio in the sol-gel precursor mix allows one to obtain various calcium phosphate<br>
phases, for example, hydroxyapatite, dicalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate or<br>
tetracalcium phosphate.<br>
The invention in one embodiment is directed to a sol-gel process for preparing<br>
calcium phosphate, such as hydroxyapatite, which comprises: (a) hydrolysing a<br>
phosphor precursor in a water or alcohol based medium; (b) adding a calcium salt<br>
precursor to the medium after the phosphite has been hydrolysed to obtain a calcium<br>
phosphate gel such as a hydroxyapatite gel; (c) depositing the gel on the surface of<br>
an implantable medical device; and (d) calcining the calcium phosphate, such as<br>
hydroxyapatite, at a suitable elevated temperature and for pre-deterrnined time to<br>
achieve desired crystallinity, bonding and porosity characteristics for the coating on<br>
the device. The deposition of the gel can be done by any number of methods, such<br>
as aero-sol deposition, dip-coating, spin-coating, electrophoretic deposition.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the phosphor precursor can be an alkyl phosphite and<br>
the alkyl phosphite can be triethyl phosphite. Further the calcium precursor can be<br>
a water-soluble calcium salt and the water soluble calcium salt can be calcium<br>
nitrate. The crystallized calcium phosphate can be calcined at a temperature of at<br><br>
about 350°C or higher. The metallic implantable medical device can be stainless<br>
steel, cobalt alloy, a titanium substrate or other metallic alloy substrate.<br>
We have discovered that if certain specific characteristics of the calcium phosphate<br>
coatings are maintained, the coatings become highly flexible while maintaining their<br>
chemistry, high bio-compatibility, and bio-resorbability. The most important<br>
characteristics are (a) coating thickness, and (b) the strength of the coating bonding<br>
to the metallic substrate. We have repeatedly demonstrated (refer to the examples<br>
below) that if CaP coating thickness is maintained below about 0.001mm, and its<br>
bonding strength to the metallic substrate is above approximately 40 MPa, the<br>
substrate-coating system retains the strain capabilities of the substrate alone, i.e. the<br>
system maintains its integrity during deformation.<br>
Furthermore, we have discovered that thicker CaP coatings deposited discontinu-<br>
ously on metallic substrate, i.e. in the form of separate "islands" and "patches"<br>
approximately 1-100μm in diameter, retain high resistance against substrate defor-<br>
mation. Our experiments have shown that stents coated with such 1-100μm patches,<br>
about 1-10μm thick, can be crimped and then expanded without damage to the<br>
patches of ceramic. These patches can be deposited on the substrate through a<br>
variety of methods discussed above, such as BM-HA, ECD-HA, CPC-HA (all at<br>
room or near-room temperature), or BPD-HA, SG-HA and combinations thereof<br>
(these two techniques including heat treatment at elevated temperatures). These<br>
coating deposition techniques are illustrated in the following examples. The<br>
discontinuous CaP film coated medical implant may have some fraction of an area<br>
of the metallic substrate exposed to living tissue, which may again lead to the<br>
adverse tissue reaction described above. This problem can be avoided by combin-<br>
ing discontinuous CaP films with a continuous bio-compatible and<br>
non-thrombogenic polymer. Thus, a composite CaP - polymer coating on medical<br>
implant is the result. Furthermore, a thin (
can be combined with a thicker discontinuous CaP coating.<br>
The effects of this process (described in detail in the Examples) are shown in the<br>
representative Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1A illustrates stainless steel (316L) stent<br>
coated with discontinuous ASG-HA thin film; Figure 1B is a magnification of the<br>
sector of (A) indicated by the rectangle. Figure 2A illustrates a stainless steel<br>
(316L) stent coated with discontinuous ASG-HA thin film and crimped, with no<br><br>
damage to the coating. Figure 2B is the same, stent after expansion, showing no<br>
damage to the coating.<br>
Our discovery of flexible continuous/discontinuous CaP films or CaP/ polymer<br>
films opens up a range of new applications of highly biocompatible CaP coatings<br>
for medical implants, particularly, but not limited to those that require deformation<br>
capability such as coronary stents.<br>
A sol-gel (SG) process provides superior chemical and physical homogeneity of the<br>
final ceramic product compared to other routes, such as solid-state synthesis, wet<br>
precipitation, or hydrothermal formation. The SG process allows the desired<br>
ceramic phase, e.g. thin film CaP coating, to be synthesized at temperatures much<br>
lower than some of the alternate processes. In the SG coating process substrate<br>
metal degradation due to thermally induced phase transformations and<br>
microstructure modification or oxidation, is avoided. SG widens green-shaping<br>
capability, for example, and it is a very convenient method for deposition of thin<br>
ceramic coatings.<br>
Sol-Gel deposition of HA (SG-HA) films at elevated temperatures (350-500°C) was<br>
disclosed previously in U.S. Patent No. 6,426,114 Bl. Sol-gel (SG) processing of<br>
HA allows molecular-level mixing of the calcium and phosphor precursors, which<br>
improves the chemical homogeneity of the resulting calcium phosphate. The<br>
crystallinity of the calcium phosphate phase can be enhanced by appropriate use of<br>
water treatment during processing. Variation of Ca/P ratio in the sol-gel precursor<br>
mix allows one to obtain any of a number of calcium phosphate phases, for exam-<br>
ple, hydroxyapatite, dicalcium phosphate, tricalciurn phosphate or tetracalcium<br>
phosphate. The versatility of the SG method provides an opportunity to form thin<br>
film coatings, either continuous or discontinuous, in a rather simple process of<br>
dip-coating, spin-coating or aero-sol deposition.<br>
A high degree of HA crystallinity is frequently required for longer-term bioactive<br>
applications, because partially crystalline, or amorphous calcium phosphate, such as<br>
HA, coatings are rapidly resorbed by living tissue. For the presently disclosed<br>
application of thin HA films on implantable medical devices, control of crystallinity<br>
of the HA coating is possible through variation of the time/temperature history<br>
during processing. This allows control of the coating resorption rate and thus rate of<br>
release of the drugs impregnated into microporosity of the coating.<br><br>
Ceramics produced by sol-gel processing can be designed to include high fraction of<br>
pores, with well-defined (narrowly distributed) pore size. This is a consequence of<br>
the chemical route to the final oxide ceramic produced through SG. Only a small<br>
fraction of the original precursor mass is finally converted to the ceramic oxide, the<br>
remaining fraction being released during heat treatment, usually in the form of gas,<br>
is usually as a combination of water and carbon dioxide. Thus, the released gases<br>
leave behind a large fraction of porosity, up to 90% in some instances, depending<br>
on the drying conditions and heat treatment time and temperature. These pores can<br>
be as small as several nm in diameter, again depending on the drying conditions and<br>
heat treatment time and temperature. Effectively, the accessible surface area of<br>
such sol-gel derived oxide ceramics can reach several hundred square meters per<br>
gram of the oxide, making it an excellent absorbent of gas or liquid substances, or<br>
solutions. For example, the average-pore size in sol-gel HA treated at relatively<br>
low temperature of 400°C is about 5 nm in diameter, with 90% of pore diameters<br>
falling within the range of 1-30 nm. This unique porosity characteristic is widely<br>
utilized to produce desiccants, filters and membranes of sol-gel derived ceramic. In<br>
this respect sol-gel derived ceramic oxides have a great advantage over polymers,<br>
which are in general difficult to process to possess high porosity and high accessible<br>
surface area. In the present invention, we utilize this unique property of sol-gel<br>
derived CaP coatings on medical implants, especially stents, possessing high<br>
accessible surface area to make it a high-capacity drug carrier.<br>
In the text of this application, it is understood that when appropriate, the term<br>
"calcium phosphate" (CaP) is used generically and includes minerals such as<br>
hydroxyapatite, dicalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate, tetracalcium phosphate<br>
and amorphous or partially amorphous calcium phosphate. Studies on the sol-gel<br>
route to thin film calcium phosphate coatings on implantable medical devices,<br>
particularly stents, performed by the inventors have led to an unexpected break-<br>
through in process development. The method according to the invention has<br>
produced CaP coatings after heat treatment in air, starting at about 350°C. We have<br>
unexpectedly discovered that the film is highly flexible if it is thinner than about<br>
0.001mm, thereby allowing damage-free manipulation of a CaP coated deformable<br>
implantable medical device, for example the contraction and expansion of a CaP<br>
coated stent. Preferably, the coating has a thickness between about 0.0001 and<br>
0.001 mm. Furthermore, in this application, we have discovered that the film can<br>
accept drugs into its fine porosity, thereby allowing it to address the adverse<br><br>
phenomena related to common medically implanted devices, i.e. the restenosis that<br>
occurs after placement of a coronary stent in a blood vessel.<br>
The calcium phosphate coating according to the invention has been deposited on<br>
stents and other metallic surfaces using variety of techniques, including dip-coating,<br>
spin-coating, aero-sol deposition electrophoretic deposition. The coatings were<br>
deposited on stents made of 316L stainless steel and tubes, and on other metallic<br>
substrates including cobalt-iron alloy and titanium.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
To demonstrate the feasibility of the unique processing concepts outlined above, the<br>
following examples are described below for stainless steel substrate and coronary<br>
stents. The procedures outlined below can be applied to other implantable medical<br>
devices.<br>
Example 1<br>
In the first stage of the process, phosphite sol was hydrolysed in a water-ethanol<br>
mixture (a concentration of 3M) in a sealed beaker until the phosphite was com-<br>
pletely hydrolysed (which is easily recognized by loss of a characteristic phosphite<br>
odour), at ambient environment. A Ca salt (2M) was then dissolved in anhydrous<br>
ethanol, and the solution was then rapidly added into the hydrolysed phosphite sol.<br>
The sol was left at ambient environment for 8 hours, followed by drying in an oven<br>
at 60°C. As a result of this process, a white gel was obtained. For the sol contain-<br>
ing Ca/P ratio required to produce HA, the gel showed a pure (single phase) apatitic<br>
structure with a Ca/P ratio of 1.666, identical to stoichiometric HA, after calcining<br>
at a temperature as low as 350°C. Varying the Ca/P ratio allows other calcium<br>
phosphates, such as dicalcium phosphate (Ca/P = 1) or tricalcium phosphate (Ca/P<br>
= 1.5), to be obtained. A coating produced using this process, and applied to 316<br>
SS substrate, showed adhesive strength of about 40MPa after curing at a tempera-<br>
ture 
Example 2<br>
In another variant of the process, a pure water-based environment was used. The<br>
aqueous-based sols were prepared in the same manner as described above in<br>
Example 1 for the ethanol-based system. A higher rate of hydrolysis of the<br>
phosphite sol was observed. The mixed sol was dried while stirring. After 8 hours<br><br>
aging, a white gel appeared. For the sol containing a Ca/P ratio required to<br>
produce HA an apatitic structure with Ca/P ratio of 1.663, close to stoichiometric<br>
HA, resulted after calcining the gel at a temperature of 350°C. Both the etha-<br>
nol-based and aqueous-based gels showed essentially the same apatitic structure at<br>
relatively low temperatures. This invention provides a method of synthesizing the<br>
HA ceramics via an aqueous-based sol-gel process.<br>
Example 3<br>
A CaP coating was deposited on the surfaces of a group of electropolished stainless<br>
steel stents through aerosol-gel processing. The stents were first treated in 2.4 N<br>
phosphoric acid solution for 10 minutes at 70°C to clean the surface and produce<br>
microroughness for increased bonding of the coating. The treated stents were<br>
ultrasonically cleaned and dried. The CaP sol was prepared by (a) hydrolysing a<br>
phosphor precursor (phosphite); (b) adding a calcium salt precursor to the medium<br>
after the phosphite has been hydrolysed to obtain a calcium phosphate sol such as a<br>
hydroxyapatite sol. The sol was atomized into ~ 4μm large particles using ultrasoni-<br>
cally assisted atomizer, and the resulting aerosol fed into a coating chamber. This<br>
specific deposition technique is referred to as Aero-Sol-Gels (ASG) deposition and<br>
the resulting hydroxyapatite film as ASG-HA.<br>
The clean stent was inserted into the coating chamber filled with flowing CaP<br>
aerosol-gel for a period of 30 seconds, while maintaining the aerosol flow at 0.1<br>
liter/min and chamber temperature at 50°C. The temperature of the coating chamber<br>
affects the deposition mode of the coating, producing a uniform, film like coverage<br>
of the surface as evidenced by SEM. The coating was dried at 60°C and heat treated<br>
at 450 °C for 15 min to crystallize CaP to form hydroxyapatite thin film. The<br>
procedure produces a thin coating covering uniformly the surface of the stent. The<br>
thickness of the coating is measured using ellipsometry in the range of 50-150nm.<br>
The subsequent SEM studies on the crimped and expanded coated stents show no<br>
evidence of cracking or delamination of the coating. This proves me reliability of<br>
the uniform, thin continuous CaP coating during the deployment and implantation<br>
of the stent into the coronary artery.<br>
Example 4<br>
CaP coating has been deposited on the surface of an electropolished stainless steel<br>
stents through aerosol-gel processing (ASG), as described in Example 37 The<br>
chamber temperature was maintained at 25 °C. The coating was dried at 60 °C and<br><br>
heat treated at 450°C for 15 min to crystallize CaP to form hydroxyapatite thin film.<br>
The procedure explained above produces a coating comprising of isolated island of<br>
approximately 2-6 μm in size and 0. l-2μm in thickness, scattered uniformly on the<br>
surface of the stent, and covering about 70% of the surface of the stent, as shown in<br>
Figures 1A and 1B. Subsequent SEM studies on the crimped and expanded coated<br>
stents showed no evidence of cracking or delamination of the coating, as shown in<br>
Figures 2A and 2B. This proves the reliability of the discontinuous CaP coating of<br>
variable thickness during the deployment and implantation of the stent into the<br>
coronary artery.<br>
Example 5<br>
Stainless steel metallic substrates (316L) were coated with a 0.6-0.8μm thin layer<br>
of apatite (ASG-HA) as described in Example 3. One group of samples was<br>
annealed at 400 °C for 20min to achieve crystalline SG-HA(C) film and another<br>
group at 375 °C for 60min to achieve amorphous SG-HA(A) film. These films were<br>
used as nucleation site for precipitation of BM-HA film. The SG-HA coated<br>
samples were immersed into "simulated body fluid" (SBF) of ionic composition (in<br>
units of mmol/1) 142 Na+, 5.0 K+, 2.5 Ca2+, 1.5 Mg2+, 103 Cl-, 25 HCO3. 1.4<br>
HPO42-, and 0.5 SO42-. The SBF was buffered at pH 7.4 with tris(hydroxymethyl)-<br>
aminomethane and HC1. This in-vitro static deposition (i.e. the SBF was not<br>
renewed during the deposition period) at - 24°C produced good quality, dense<br>
3-5μn thick BM-HA film deposits on flat SG-HA substrates. The crystalline<br>
SG-HA(C) film is coated with dense BM-HA, whereas amorphous SG-HA(A) film<br>
is coated with porous BM-HA. The properties of the underlying SG-HA surface<br>
modification film can be used to vary the properties, e.g. porosity, of the nucleated<br>
and deposited top BM-HA film for drug encapsulation.<br>
Example 6<br>
Stainless steel metallic stents (316L) were coated with " 0.1μm thin CaP coatings as<br>
described in Example 3. An inorganic colloidal slurry containing calcium phos-<br>
phate precursor Ca(OH)2 and calcium phosphate salt monocalcium phosphate<br>
anhydrate, was ball milled in ethanol. The two starting inorganic ingredients had<br>
particle size 0.3-2μm and 0.5-4μm, respectively. The initial Ca/P ratio in the slurry<br>
was kept at 1.5. As dissolution and precipitation are the principal mechanisms for<br>
apatite development in such system, 5 wt% of submicron, crystalline hydroxyapatite<br>
powder was used as seeds for heterogeneous nucleation of CPC-HA. The thin CaP<br>
film surface-modified sample was dip coated in the ethanol suspension of the<br><br>
precursors. After single dip coating, an approximately 10μm thick layer of porous<br>
precursor powder mixture developed on the substrate due to rapid evaporation of<br>
ethanol. Due to the colloidal nature of the precursors slurry, this film develops<br>
sufficient structural integrity (i.e. strength and hardness) to accept the next process-<br>
ing step. In this step, the film is exposed to sodium phosphate water-based solution<br>
(0.25 M), which is allowed to soak into the open pores of the film, and then placed<br>
in an incubator at 37°C, 100% relative humidity, for 24 h. During incubation, the<br>
colloidal precursors react with the phosphate liquid and precipitate HA. In order to<br>
assess the possibility of using this double-coating route for controlled drug release,<br>
amethopterin (Sigma Chemicals, USA) was employed as a model drug, in an<br>
amount of 5 % based on solid phase content of CPC-HA precursors. The drug was<br>
mixed with the colloidal suspension of the precursors, before dip coating was<br>
performed. During incubation period, 20μm thick CPC-HA coating precipitated<br>
encapsulating the drug molecules within the nanopores of the crystallizing HA.<br>
After encapsulation, a drug release study was conducted by immersion of the<br>
substrates into 20 ml of phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH=7.4) at constant ratio of<br>
(CPC coating weight)/(volume of PBS) of 1 mg/ml. A reference sample coated<br>
with hydrogel film was also tested for drug release kinetics. The hydrogel film<br>
was prepared by dipping the CPC-HA layer containing the drug into a polymer<br>
solution containing 3% polyvinyl alcohol. After drying, the weight gain of the " 20<br>
mg CPC-HA layer due to the additional hydrogel coating was " 0.5 mg, corre-<br>
sponding to the content of polymer film in the CPC-HA matrix of about 2.5%. The<br>
samples of PBS liquid with released drug were periodically taken out (i.e. entire<br>
liquid was emptied) and refilled with the same amount of 20 ml of PBS. The drug<br>
concentration in the supernatant was determined via an UV-Visible spectroscopy.<br>
Although a burst effect was detected for both coatings over the initial period of<br>
about 8 h, a slower release is evident for the sample post-coated with hydrogel. A<br>
linear relationship was obtained between the amount of drug released and (time)1/2<br>
for the release time greater than 8 h.<br>
Example 7<br>
The stent was submerged into water-based, diluted suspension of sub-micron<br>
particles of hydroxyapatite, containing approximately 2wt% of HA in the suspen-<br>
sion. DC voltage of 5V was applied to the stent, for times varying from 5 seconds,<br>
to 10 minutes. As the particles of HA naturally attain positive charge in such<br>
solution, they are attracted to the stent surface which is also a negative electrode<br>
(cathode) in this system. The buildup of HA particles attracted to the stent (cath-<br><br>
ode) allows to produce an extremely uniformly coated surface, thickness of the<br>
coating varying as a function of time of application of voltage. The film uniformity<br>
is the biggest advantage of such Electro-Phoretic Deposition (EPD) processing,<br>
which is difficult to reproduce using other methods such as sol-gel processing. For<br>
the short time of 10 sec, the EPD-HA coating thickness is about 1 micrometer.<br>
This type of EPD-HA coating on 316L stainless steel stent is illustrated in Fig. 3.<br>
For the longer times of several minutes, the coating thickness may exceed 10<br>
micrometers. Thus, in this EPD process, a controlled thickness, uniform HA film<br>
may be produced. The as deposited film constitutes loosely bonded particles of<br>
HA, of porosity generally in excess of 50vol%. In order to increase structural<br>
integrity and bonding strength to the substrate of such EPD film, heat treatment is<br>
necessary at temperatures at least 500°C, for times at least 10 minutes.' The heat<br>
treatment of EPD films proceeds at higher temperatures and longer times than<br>
sol-gel films, because HA particles deposited in the EPD process are less reactive<br>
than those deposited in the sol-gel process. The goal of such heat treatment is to<br>
increase interparticle bonding, while providing sufficient residual porosity to<br>
maintain low stiffness and flexibility of the film, and to provide room for drug<br>
impregnation. The need for higher temperature and longer times heat treatment of<br>
EPD films is a disadvantage, as the heat treatment process may adversely affect<br>
properties of the metallic substrate of the stent.<br>
Example 8<br>
The HA was deposited on a 316L stainless steel stent surface through EPD process<br>
as described in the Example 7. The uniformly deposited EPD film was heat treated<br>
at 500°C for 10 minutes to achieve minimal structural integrity of the film, suffi-<br>
cient to survive handling and preventing re-fluxing of the film upon contact with<br>
liquid medium. Such EPD-coated stent was exposed to droplets of sol in the<br>
aero-sol-gel process described in Example 3. The sol droplets have penetrated open<br>
porosity of the EPD film, and, by capillary attraction, located themselves mostly<br>
within negative curvature of the necks between EPD deposited HA particles. Such<br>
composite coating was heat treated again at 500°C for 10 minutes. Now the active<br>
sol-gel component of the coating allowed achieving high structural integrity of the<br>
film, while EPD component of the coating allowed achieving high uniformity of<br>
coverage by the film. A uniform, porous HA film was achieved in this novel<br>
combined process.<br><br>
Example 9<br>
The electrochemical deposition (ECD) of hydroxyapatite HA has been conducted in<br>
the mixed aqueous solution of Ca(NO3)2 4H2O and NH4-H2PO4. In this process HA<br>
is deposited on the cathodic (negatively biased) surface of stent or implant by the<br>
following reaction: 10Ca2+ + 6P043- + 20H - Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2. ECD was<br>
conducted in the mixed aqueous solution of 0.02329 M Ca(NO3)2 4H2O and<br>
0.04347 M NH4H2PO4. The stainless steel specimen, i.e. stent, was the cathode,<br>
and platinum was used as the anode. The pH was controlled at 4.0 with the<br>
addition of sodium hydroxide. The environment temperature was controlled at<br>
40 °C ± 1°C. The coating morphology deposited at low current density (ImA/crr2)<br>
was a thin uniform porous structure, 1-2 micrometers thick for deposition time of<br>
0.5-1 minute, as illustrated in Fig. 4.<br>
Example 10<br>
The HA was deposited on a 316L stainless steel stent surface through ASG-HA<br>
process as described in the Example 4. The discontinuous network of HA patches<br>
left some of the stent surface uncoated. 5V DC bias voltage was applied to such<br>
pre-coated stent, and the stent submerged into suspension of submicron HA parti-<br>
cles. The uncoated metallic surface of the stent preferentially attracted HA particles<br>
leading to preferential electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of HA in these areas, to<br>
build the coating about 1 micrometer thick in about 10 seconds. The coated stent<br>
was heat treated at 500C for 10 minutes. The EPD-HA coated areas show increased<br>
porosity as compared to ASG-HA coated areas, suitable for impregnation with drug<br>
carrying liquid. Such composite engineered HA coating shows unique properties<br>
regarding mechanical performance and drug release properties.<br>
Example 11<br>
The HA was deposited on a 316L stainless steel stent surface through ASG-HA<br>
process as described in the Example 3, followed by the process of ECD-HA<br>
deposition as described in Example 9, but on top of the already heat treated<br>
ASG-HA. Such composite engineered coating allowed to achieve substantially<br>
higher bonding strength (as compared to ECD-HA deposited directly on metallic<br>
surface), and capability of drug encapsulation during deposition of ECD-HA on top<br>
of ASG-HA.<br><br>
Example 12<br>
The HA was deposited on two 316L stainless steel stents surface through ASG-HA<br>
process as described in the Example 4. The coated stents were evaluated in the<br>
standard thromboresistance test in dogs. Minimal thrombosis with a grade of 1<br>
(defined as thrombus found at one location only) was observed in one out of two<br>
test sites. In the second test site, no thrombosis (grade 0) was observed.<br>
The process for coating of calcium phosphate, in particular HA, bioactive ceramics,<br>
on implantable medical devices disclosed herein offers the following advantages in<br>
comparison to other processes and other coating materials on implantable medical<br>
devices:<br>
(1)	The coating process, including CaP sol synthesis, can be completed<br>
in ambient environment (i.e. air), in less than 24 hours.<br>
(2)	The thin (
flexibility to survive substantial strain, e.g. during crimping and<br>
expanding of a coated stent, without coating damage or spallation<br>
(3)	Porous CaP coatings can be produced, with controlled amount and<br>
size-of the pores, which allows design flexibility in choice and<br>
absorption/release characteristics for the drug impregnated into the<br>
coating<br>
(4)	The synthesis requires low temperature (~ 350°C) and short time (
1 hour) of calcination for formation of high quality, highly adhesive<br>
CaP coating. Low temperature calcination of the novel CaP coatings<br>
on metals permits thermal treatment in an air environment without<br>
the risk of metal oxidation and possible property degradation due to<br>
microstructural deterioration or phase transformations.<br>
It will be clear for the person skilled in the art of sol-gel processing that coating<br>
deposition parameters, such as time, the flow rate of the aerosol, temperature of the<br>
coating chamber or the concentration of the sol-gel solution can be customized for<br>
different implantable medical device materials and applications producing various<br>
degree of coverage on the surface. Similar manipulation and optimization of<br>
process parameters may be applied to other coating methods disclosed, i.e. dip- and<br>
spin-coating and electrophoresis, biomimetic coating, electrochemical deposition<br>
coating, calcium phosphate cement coating, electrophoretic deposition coating, as<br>
well as coating porosity distribution and ratio of the inorganic phase (CaP) to<br>
organic phase (biodegradable polymer). These parameters were optimized for the<br><br>
particular CaP coatings on the implantable medical devices described in the forego-<br>
ing examples.<br>
It is well known that crystallinity and microporosity of hydroxyapatite directly<br>
affects its dissolution rate in body fluids. Different heat treatment regimes and<br>
temperatures can be adopted to produce various degrees of crystallinity and<br>
microporosity to control the degradation of the coating into die body environment.<br>
This advantage is of a great importance where drug delivery capabilities are added<br>
to the implantable medical device surface coated with sol-gel derived CaP. Similar<br>
deposition process can be applied to coating other metallic surfaces, such as Ti<br>
substrates or other alloys, such as Cobalt-Chromium-Nickel-Molybdenum-Iron. A<br>
thin uniform thin HA coating is obtained. The results of this experiment provide<br>
basic evidence of the feasibility of the as described coating on implantable medical<br>
devices composed of non-metallic materials such as polymers.<br>
The nature of the process for CaP coatings deposition according to the invention is<br>
such that it can be easily incorporated into the current production practice of<br>
metallic implantable medical devices. The water-based liquid precursors to CaP<br>
ceramic coatings, simple deposition technique (e.g. dipping or spin-coating or<br>
aerosol deposition or electrophoretic deposition, and others) and low-temperature<br>
heat treatment in air make the process not unlike simple painting-curing operation<br>
which can be commercialized with relatively small effort.<br>
As will be apparent to those skilled in the art in the light of the foregoing disclo-<br>
sure, many alterations and modifications are possible in the practice of this inven-<br>
tion without departing from the scope thereof. Accordingly, the scope of the<br>
invention is to be construed in accordance with the substance defined by the<br>
