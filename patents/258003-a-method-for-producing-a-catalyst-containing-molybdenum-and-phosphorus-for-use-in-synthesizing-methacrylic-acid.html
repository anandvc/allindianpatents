BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The catalyst for use in synthesizing methacrylic acid which is produced<br>
by the method of the present invention (hereinafter, also merely expressed as<br>
catalyst) is a composite oxide containing at least molybdenum and phosphorus.<br>
The composite oxide preferably contains a structure of heteropolyacid and/or<br>
heteropolyacid salt. The fact that the catalyst is the composite oxide and<br>
contains the structure of heteropolyacid and/or heteropolyacid salt can be<br>
confirmed with XRD.<br>
Further, the catalyst preferably contains an alkaline metal besides<br><br>
molybdenum and phosphorus, and may contain, in addition to these elements,<br>
copper, vanadium, iron, cobalt, nickel, zinc, magnesium, calcium, strontium,<br>
barium, titan, chromium, tungsten, manganese, silver, boron, silicon, aluminum,<br>
gallium, germanium, tin, lead, arsenic, antimony, bismuth, niobium, tantalum,<br>
zirconium, indium, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, lanthanum, cerium, or the like.<br>
The catalyst is preferably the composite oxide represented by the following<br>
compositional formula (1).<br><br>
In the formula (1), Mo, P, Cu, V and O represent molybdenum,<br>
phosphorus, copper, vanadium, and oxygen, respectively; X represents at least<br>
one element selected from the group consisting of potassium, rubidium, cesium,<br>
and thallium; Y represents at least one element selected from the group<br>
consisting of iron, cobalt, nickel, zinc, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium,<br>
titan, chromium, tungsten, manganese, silver, boron, silicon, aluminum, gallium,<br>
germanium, tin, lead, arsenic, antimony, bismuth, niobium, tantalum, zirconium,<br>
indium, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, lanthanum, and cerium; a, b, c, d, e, f, and g<br>
represent atomic ratios of respective elements; when a is 12, b is in the range of<br>
from 0.1 to 3, c is in the range of from 0.01 to 3, d is in the range of from 0.01 to 3,<br>
e is in the range of from 0.01 to 3, f is in the range of from 0 to 3, and g<br>
represents the atomic ratio of oxygen necessary for fulfilling the requirement of<br>
the atomic ratio of each component above.<br>
In the method for producing the catalyst of the present invention, a slurry<br>
containing at least molybdenum and phosphorus and having specific viscosity in<br>
the range of 2.5 x 10-4 to 7.0 x 10-4 m2/s, which is a value obtained by dividing<br>
viscosity (unit: kg/(m-s)) by specific gravity (unit: kg/m3) (hereinafter, also merely<br>
expressed as slurry), is prepared (step (a)); the slurry is dried (step (b)); and the<br>
dried material thus obtained is calcined at 300 to 500째C (step (c)).<br><br>
The slurry containing at least molybdenum and phosphorus and having<br>
the specified specific viscosity mentioned above can be prepared, using raw<br>
materials of respective component elements of the catalyst (hereinafter,<br>
expressed as catalyst raw materials), with conventional coprecipitation method,<br>
oxide mixing method, or the like. The catalyst raw materials to be used in the<br>
preparation of the slurry are not particularly limited and nitrates, carbonates,<br>
acetates, ammonium salts, oxides, halides, oxoacids, and oxoacid salts of<br>
respective component elements of the catalyst can be used in combination. As<br>
the raw material of molybdenum, for example, ammonium paramolybdate,<br>
molybdenum trioxide, molybdic acid, and molybdenum chloride can be used.<br>
As the raw material of phosphorus, for example, phosphoric acid, phosphorus<br>
pentoxide, and ammonium phosphate can be used. As the solvent, for<br>
example, water, ethyl alcohol, and acetone can be listed and water is preferably<br>
used.<br>
As the preferable procedure for preparing the slurry, for example, a<br>
method of suspending in water the raw material of molybdenum such as a<br>
molybdenum oxide or ammonium paramolybdate followed by mixing the other<br>
catalyst raw materials with the suspension thus obtained is listed. The other<br>
catalyst raw materials can be used as they are or by properly dissolving or<br>
suspending them in liquid media such as water. Further, aqueous ammonia<br>
may be added in the course of mixing the catalyst raw materials or after the<br>
mixing.<br>
The foregoing slurry having the specified specific viscosity, for example,<br>
can be produced by concentrating the slurry having specific viscosity which is<br>
lower than the target specific viscosity. Concentration means the operation of<br>
heating the slurry and vaporizing the solvent in the slurry. The concentration,<br>
for example, can be carried out by heating a vessel such as a reaction vessel<br><br>
containing the slurry using heat source such as electric heater or steam. The<br>
temperature of the slurry at the time of the concentration is not particularly<br>
limited, however, it is preferably 50째C to 110째C, more preferably 90째C to 108째C,<br>
furthermore preferably 95째C to 105째C. The viscosity and the specific gravity of<br>
the slurry during the concentration are properly measured by sampling the slurry,<br>
and the concentration is finished when the specific viscosity reaches the target<br>
specific viscosity in the range of 2.5 x 10-4 to 7.0 x 10-4 m2/s, preferably in the<br>
range of 3.0 x 10-4 to 6.5 x 10-4 m2/s. Specific viscosity is a value calculated by<br>
dividing the viscosity (unit: kg/(ms)) by the specific gravity (unit: kg/m3).<br>
Viscosity is measured by sampling a portion of the slurry and using B type<br>
viscometer. The measurement of the viscosity is preferably carried out after the<br>
slurry is stirred. Specific gravity is calculated by sampling a portion of the slurry,<br>
measuring its mass and its volume and dividing the mass by the volume.<br>
Measurements of the viscosity and the specific gravity of the slurry during its<br>
concentration may be carried out either continuously or intermittently, however, it<br>
is preferable to carry out intermittently at intervals of within 5 minutes.<br>
"Concentration is finished" means that vaporization of water is<br>
suppressed as far as possible by a method of, for example, stopping heating.<br>
Concretely, it is preferable to stop heating and put the lid on the reaction vessel.<br>
In the present invention, the prepared slurry having the specified specific<br>
viscosity can be dried immediately, however, it can also be stored in the state of<br>
slurry before dried. When the slurry is stored, the specific viscosity of the slurry<br>
is kept in the range of 2.5 x 10-4 to 7.0 x 10-4 m2/s, preferably in the range of 3.0<br>
x 10-4 to 6.5 x 10-4 m2/s. The storage time of the slurry is not particularly limited<br>
as long as the specific viscosity of the slurry is within the foregoing range.<br>
However, the storage time is preferably 30 days or less, more preferably 5 days<br>
or less, because the productivity of the catalyst becomes higher as the storage<br><br>
time becomes shorter.<br>
In the present invention, the slurry having the specific viscosity in the<br>
range of 2.5 x 10-4 to 7.0 x 10-4 m2/s is dried (step (b)). For drying, a device that<br>
can dry the slurry in a short time such as spray dryer, drum dryer and slurry dryer<br>
can be used. The temperature at the time of drying is not particularly limited,<br>
however, it is preferably 120째C to 500째C, more preferably 130째C to 400째C,<br>
furthermore preferably 140 째C to 350 째C. The drying time is not particularly<br>
limited, however, it is preferably 0.1 second to 10 minutes, more preferably 0.3<br>
second to 5 minutes. Drying is preferably carried out to the extent that the<br>
water content of the dried material to be obtained becomes less than 3% by<br>
mass. Water content of the dried material can be measured with Kett Moisture<br>
Tester by sampling a portion of it.<br>
Subsequently, the dried material thus obtained is calcined at 300 to<br>
500째C, preferably at 300 to 450째C. The calcination is ordinarily carried out under<br>
the flow of oxygen-containing gas such as air and/or under the flow of inert gas.<br>
The calcination time is ordinarily 0.5 hour or more, preferably 1 to 40 hours.<br>
When the molded catalyst is produced, the calcined material obtained by<br>
calcining the dried material without modification may be molded, however, it is<br>
preferable to previously mold the dried material and then calcine the molded<br>
article thus obtained. The method of molding is not particularly limited and<br>
various molding methods such as tablet molding, extrusion molding and<br>
granulation can be used. When molding is carried out, additives or filling<br>
materials such as inorganic salts which include barium sulfate and ammonium<br>
sulfate; lubricants which include graphite; organic materials which include<br>
cellulose, starch, polyvinyl alcohol, and stearic acid; hydroxyl sols which include<br>
silica sol and alumina sol; and inorganic fibers which include whisker, glass fiber,<br>
and carbon fiber may be properly added with the view of producing molded<br><br>
articles having a uniform specific surface area, pore volume, and pore<br>
distribution in good reproducibility, improving mechanical strength of the molded<br>
articles, or the like. The shape of the molded article is not particularly limited<br>
and spherical shape, cylindrical shape, ring shape or plate shape can be listed.<br>
The reason why the catalyst that can produce methacrylic acid in high<br>
yield can be produced by carrying out the above-mentioned procedure is not<br>
clear, however, it is presumed that an intermediate of the crystal structure which<br>
functions advantageously in gas-phase catalytic oxidation reaction of<br>
methacrolein be formed when the specific viscosity of the slurry is in the<br>
foregoing specified range.<br>
Next, the method for producing methacrylic acid through gas-phase<br>
catalytic oxidation of methacrolein with molecular oxygen by using the catalyst of<br>
the present invention thus obtained will be explained.<br>
In the gas-phase catalytic oxidation (hereinafter, also merely expressed<br>
as reaction), the raw gas containing at least methacrolein and molecular oxygen<br>
is contacted with the catalyst. Ordinarily, a tubular reactor filled with the catalyst<br>
is used for the reaction. Industrially, a multitubular reactor is used.<br>
Concentration of methacrolein in the raw gas to be used in the reaction<br>
can be set in a wide range, however, it is preferably 1 to 20% by volume,<br>
particularly preferably 3 to 10% by volume. The raw methacrolein sometimes<br>
contains a small amount of impurities such as water, lower saturated aldehydes,<br>
and the like which do not substantially affect the reaction, and the raw gas may<br>
also contain those impurities originating from methacrolein.<br>
The amount of molecular oxygen in the raw gas is preferably 0.4 to 4<br>
times by mole as much as that of methacrolein, particularly preferably 0.5 to 3<br>
times by mole. As a source of molecular oxygen in the raw gas, using air is<br>
industrially advantageous, however if necessary, pure oxygen-enriched air can<br><br>
be used. Further, the raw gas is preferably diluted with an inert gas such as<br>
nitrogen or carbon dioxide, steam, or the like.<br>
The reaction pressure is preferably from atmospheric pressure to 5 atm,<br>
more preferably from atmospheric pressure to 3 atm. The reaction temperature<br>
is preferably 200 to 450째C, more preferably 250 to 400째C. The contact time of<br>
the raw gas with the catalyst is preferably 1.5 to 15 seconds, more preferably 2<br>
to 7 seconds.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be explained with reference to<br>
Examples and Comparative Examples. The term "part(s)" in the Examples and<br>
Comparative Examples means part(s) by mass. Quantitative analysis of the<br>
raw gas and the products were carried out with gas chromatography.<br>
Conversion of the raw methacrolein, selectivity to and per pass yield of the<br>
product methacrylic acid are defined as follows:<br>
Conversion of methacrolein (%)	= (B/A) x 100;<br>
Selectivity to methacrylic acid (%)	= (C/B) x 100; and<br>
Per pass yield of methacrylic acid (%) = (C/A) x 100.<br>
In these formulae, A represents mole number of methacrolein supplied,<br>
B represents mole number of methacrolein reacted and C represents mole<br>
number of methacrylic acid produced.<br>
In the Examples and Comparative Examples, viscosity (kg/(m-s)) of the<br>
slurry was measured by B type viscometer after sampling a portion of the slurry,<br>
and sufficiently stirring the sample not to segregate the solids constituent.<br>
Specific gravity (kg/m3) of the slurry was calculated by sampling a portion of the<br>
slurry, measuring its volume (m3) and its mass (kg) and dividing the mass by the<br>
volume. During concentration of the slurry, these measurement were carried<br>
out at intervals of 5 minutes. Specific viscosity (m2/s) was calculated by<br><br>
dividing the viscosity (kg/(m.s)) by the specific gravity (kg/m3). Water content of<br>
the dried material was measured with Kett Moisture Tester.<br>
The fact that the catalyst is a composite oxide and contains the structure<br>
of heteropolyacid and/or its salt was confirmed with XRD.<br>
Example 1<br>
To 400 parts of pure water, 100 parts of molybdenum trioxide, 7.3 parts<br>
of 85% by mass aqueous phosphoric acid, 4.2 parts of vanadium pentoxide, 0.9<br>
part of copper oxide, and 0.2 part of iron oxide were added and stirred under<br>
reflux condition for 5 hours. The resultant liquid was cooled to 50째C and 37.4<br>
parts of 29% by mass aqueous ammonia was dropped to it and stirred for 15<br>
minutes. Subsequently, a solution obtained by dissolving 9.0 parts of cesium<br>
nitrate in 30 parts of pure water was dropped to it and stirred for 15 minutes to<br>
obtain a slurry.<br>
The slurry was heated to 101째C and the concentration was started while<br>
it was stirred. At the beginning of the concentration, the viscosity of the slurry<br>
was 0.03 kg/(m-s), the specific gravity was 1.25 x 103 kg/m3, and the specific<br>
viscosity was 2.4 x 10-5 m2/s. The temperature was kept at 101째C during the<br>
concentration, and heating was stopped and the concentration was finished<br>
when the viscosity of the slurry was 0.70 kg/(m-s), the specific gravity was 1.56 x<br>
103 kg/m3, and the specific viscosity was 4.5 x 10-4 m2/s. The time spent for the<br>
concentration was 2 hours.<br>
The slurry right after the concentration was dried with a spray dryer at<br>
the inlet temperature of 300째C and the outlet temperature of 120째C. The water<br>
content of the dried material thus obtained was 0.9% by mass. To 100 parts of<br>
the dried material, 2 parts of graphite was added and the mixture thus obtained<br>
was molded to ring shape having an outer diameter of 5 mm, an inner diameter<br>
of 2 mm, and a length of 5 mm with a tablet molding machine. The molded<br><br>
articles thus obtained were calcined at 375째C for 10 hours under air flow and a<br>
composite oxide catalyst having the composition of Mo12P1.1Cu0.2V0.8Cs0.8Fe0.05<br>
(oxygen and its atomic ratio were abbreviated, and the same hereinafter) and<br>
containing the structure of heteropolyacid and its salt was obtained.<br>
The catalyst was filled in a reactor and mixed gas composed of 5% of<br>
methacrolein, 10% of oxygen, 30% of water vapor, and 55% of nitrogen<br>
(volume%) was passed through it with the reaction pressure of 1013 hPa<br>
(pressure at the exit of the reactor), the reaction temperature of 285째C, and the<br>
contact time of 3.6 seconds to carry out the reaction for synthesizing methacrylic<br>
acid. The result is shown in Table 1.<br>
Example 2<br>
The same procedure as in Example 1 was carried out except that the<br>
concentration was finished when the viscosity of the slurry was 0.53 kg/(ms), the<br>
specific gravity was 1.52 x 103 kg/m3, and the specific viscosity was 3.5 x 10-4 <br>
m2/s, to produce the catalyst of the same composition and to synthesize<br>
methacrylic acid. The result is shown in Table 1.<br>
Example 3<br>
The same procedure as in Example 1 was carried out except that the<br>
concentration was finished when the viscosity of the slurry was 0.88 kg/(m.s), the<br>
specific gravity was 1.60 x 103 kg/m3, and the specific viscosity was 5.5 x 10-4 <br>
m2/s, to produce the catalyst of the same composition and to synthesize<br>
methacrylic acid. The result is shown in Table 1.<br>

The same procedure as in Example 1 was carried out except that the<br>
concentration was finished when the viscosity of the slurry was 1.30 kg/(m.s), the<br>
specific gravity was 1.63 x 103 kg/m3, and the specific viscosity was 8.0 x 10-4 <br>
m2/s, to produce the catalyst of the same composition and to synthesize<br><br>
methacrylic acid. The result is shown in Table 1.<br>

m2/s, to produce the catalyst of the same composition and to synthesize<br>
methacrylic acid. The result is shown in Table 1.<br>

The same procedure as in Example 1 was carried out except that the<br>
concentration was finished when the viscosity of the slurry was 0.10 kg/(ms), the<br>
specific gravity was 1.25 x 103 kg/m3, and the specific viscosity was 8.0 x 10-5<br>
m2/s, to produce the catalyst of the same composition and to synthesize<br>
methacrylic acid. The result is shown in Table 1.<br>
Example 4<br>
In 200 parts of pure water, 100 parts of ammonium paramolybdate was<br>
dissolved, and to the resultant solution, 3.4 parts of ammonium methavanadate,<br>
a solution obtained by dissolving 8.2 parts of 85% by mass aqueous phosphoric<br>
acid in 30 parts of pure water, a solution obtained by dissolving 1.1 parts of<br>
copper nitrate in 30 parts of pure water, and a solution obtained by dissolving 3.8<br>
parts of iron nitrate in 10 parts of pure water were added in this order, and the<br>
resultant liquid was heated to 90째C while stirred, and kept at 90째C while stirred<br><br>
for 5 hours. To the resultant liquid, a solution obtained by dissolving 9.2 parts of<br>
cesium nitrate in 100 parts of pure water was added and stirred for 15 minutes to<br>
obtain a slurry.<br>
The slurry was heated to 101째C and the concentration was started while<br>
it was stirred. At the beginning of the concentration, the viscosity of the slurry<br>
was 0.02 kg/(ms), the specific gravity was 1.22 x 103 kg/m3, and the specific<br>
viscosity was 1.6 x 10-5 m2/s. The temperature was kept at 101째C during the<br>
concentration, and heating was stopped and the concentration was finished<br>
when the viscosity of the slurry was 0.68 kg/(m.s), the specific gravity was 1.58 x<br>
103 kg/m3 and the specific viscosity was 4.3 x 10-4 m2/s. The time spent for the<br>
concentration was 2.5 hours.<br>
The slurry right after the concentration was dried with a drum dryer at the<br>
temperature of 300째C. The water content of the dried material thus obtained<br>
was 1.0% by mass. To 100 parts of the dried material, 2 parts of graphite was<br>
added and the mixture thus obtained was molded to ring shape having an outer<br>
diameter of 5 mm, an inner diameter of 2 mm, and a length of 5 mm with a tablet<br>
molding machine. The molded articles thus obtained were calcined at 380째C<br>
for 6 hours under air flow and a composite oxide catalyst having the composition<br>
of Mo12P1.5Cu0.1V0.6Cs1Fe0.2 and containing the structure of heteropolyacid and<br>
its salt was obtained.<br>
The catalyst was filled in a reactor and mixed gas composed of 5% of<br>
methacrolein, 10% of oxygen, 30% of water vapor, and 55% of nitrogen<br>
(volume%) was passed through it with the reaction pressure of 1013 hPa<br>
(pressure at the exit of the reactor), the reaction temperature of 285째C, and the<br>
contact time of 3.6 seconds to carry out the reaction for synthesizing methacrylic<br>
acid. The result is shown in Table 1.<br>
Example 5<br><br>
The same procedure as in Example 4 was carried out except that the<br>
concentration was finished when the viscosity of the slurry was 0.85 kg/(m.s), the<br>
specific gravity was 1.60 x 103 kg/m3, and the specific viscosity was 5.3 x 10-4 <br>
m2/s, to produce the catalyst of the same composition and to synthesize<br>
methacrylic acid. The result is shown in Table 1.<br>
Comparative Example 5<br>
The same procedure as in Example 4 was carried out except that the<br>
concentration was finished when the viscosity of the slurry was 0.26 kg/(ms), the<br>
specific gravity was 1.37 x 103 kg/m3, and the specific viscosity was 1.9 x 10-4 <br>
m2/s, to produce the catalyst of the same composition and to synthesize<br>
methacrylic acid. The result is shown in Table 1.<br>
Comparative Example 6<br>
The same procedure as in Example 4 was carried out except that the<br>
concentration was finished when the viscosity of the slurry was 1.30 kg/(m.s), the<br>
specific gravity was 1.65 x 103 kg/m3, and the specific viscosity was 7.9 x 10-4 <br>
m2/s, to produce the catalyst of the same composition and to synthesize<br>
methacrylic acid. The result is shown in Table 1.<br>
Example 6<br>
To 800 parts of pure water, 100 parts of molybdenum trioxide, 3.1 parts<br>
of vanadium pentoxide, and 6.7 parts of 85% by mass aqueous phosphoric acid<br>
were added and stirred under reflux condition for 6 hours. To the liquid thus<br>
obtained, 2.4 parts of copper acetate was added and further stirred under reflux<br>
condition for 3 hours. The resultant liquid was cooled to 40째C and a solution<br>
obtained by dissolving 11.2 parts of cesium bicarbonate in 100 parts of pure<br>
water was dropped to it and a solution obtained by dissolving 5.6 parts of<br>
ammonium carbonate in 100 parts of pure water was further dropped to it at<br>
40째C and stirred for 15 minutes to obtain a slurry.<br><br>
The slurry was heated to 101째C and the concentration was started while<br>
it was stirred. At the beginning of the concentration, the viscosity of the slurry<br>
was 0.02 kg/(m.s), the specific gravity was 1.11 x 103 kg/m3, and the specific<br>
viscosity was 1.8 x 10-5 m2/s. The temperature was kept at 101째C during the<br>
