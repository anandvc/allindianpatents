				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PRESS FORMING SYSTEM, PRESS FORMING METHOD, AND<br>
COMPUTER PROGRAM<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]   The present invention relates to a press-forming system, a press-forming method, and a computer program, and in particular, belongs to an art suitable for use to press-form a material.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]   Conventionally, an actual process is performed on a basis that adequate .forming conditions, for example, such as a mold shape, a lubricating condition, a forming speed, a blank-holder force, temperatures of a mold and a material to be press-processed are defined in advance by each material by an experience, an experimental production, a simulation by a finite element method, or the like, when a deep-drawing process, a bending process, a cutting process, and so on by using a press-process device are performed for a metallic material.<br>
[0003]   On the other hand, various metallic materials to be the material are a plate material, a pipe material, a bar material, a wire material, a granular material, and so on obtained from a row material and a scrap passing through multi processes such as a melting - a smelting - a molding - a<br>
%rolling - a heat treatment - a secondary press-process.  Consequently, it is inevitable that a certain degree of variation exists in a mechanical characteristic value of a formed product caused by a variation of process conditions resulting from a variation of chemical components, a nonuniformity of temperature, and so on.  Accordingly, there is a case when a poor forming may occur because formability is different by each portion of the material or a production lot, even if the adequate forming conditions are defined in advance as stated above. It goes without saying that a quality control in a material manufacturing process is performed more rigorously, to avoid the poor forming.  However, an excessive quality control may cause an increase of material cost, and it is not preferable. [0004]   Besides, there is a case when the poor forming may occur caused by environmental changes during the press-process, for example, such as a temperature change of a mold caused by a continuous press-process, an abrasion of the mold, changes of a temperature and a humidity of an atmosphere even if the mechanical characteristic value of the material is the same.<br>
[0005]   An art performing a forming by controlling forming conditions in accordance with conditions of a material and a mold is disclosed in consideration of the above-stated problems (refer to Patent Document 1}.  In such art, a relation is asked in advance<br>
etween a shape of a press material, mechanical properties and chemical properties of the press material, lamination characteristics such as a plating, and a physical quantity of a surface situation and so on such as oil quantity, and a blank-holder load capable of obtaining a predetermined press quality.  An adequate blank-holder load is asked in accordance with an actual physical quantity from the relation between the predetermined physical quantity of the press material and the press-forming condition capable of obtaining the predetermined press quality, and an air pressure of an air cylinder is controlled so that a press-process is performed with the adequate blank-holde.r load .<br>
[0006]   Besides, an art is disclosed in which press conditions are adjusted based on machine information and mold information unique to a press-process device (refer to Patent Documents 2, 3).<br>
Further, an art is disclosed in which a material to be processed is adjusted to be a predetermined bending angle in a bending press-process using a press brake (refer to Patent Documents 4, 5, 6). [0007]   By the way, material characteristics and environments when the material to be processed is press-processed change momentarily.<br>
However, it is extremely difficult to predict the above-stated variation of material characteristics, environmental changes when the material to be<br><br>
liprocessed is press-processed beforehand, although it is disclosed that the blank-holder load is controlled based on the material characteristics, the information unique to the press-process device, and the mold information, in the above-stated Patent Documents 1 to 3.  Besides, it is difficult to measure a complicated three-dimensional shape such as a drawing press-process and a cutting press-process on the moment, besides, the material to be press-processed during the press-process is engaged by the mold, and therefore, it is very difficult to measure a proper shape, although it is disclosed that the forming conditions are adjusted in accordance with a deformed state of the mat.erial to be press-processed during the press-process, in the above-stated Patent Documents 4 to 6.<br>
As it can be seen from the above, there has been a problem that it is difficult to perform the press-process in good state in the conventional arts. [0008]   Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Hei 7-266100<br>

Summary of the Invention<br>
[0009]   The present invention is made in consideration of the above-stated problems, and an object thereof is to enable a press-process better than the conventional manners.<br>
[0010]   In a press-forming system according to the present invention, a computer for controlling a press machine is connected to a network.

[0021]    The strain sensor 102b is to detect a distortion of a mold constituted by the die 102a, the punch 102d, and so on.  The load cell 102c is to detect a punch reaction force and so on.  The blank-holder 102e is to prevent an occurrence of wrinkles when the material to be processed 300 is press-proces sed.<br>
Incidentally, it goes without saying that members necessary for the press-process of the material to be processed 300 such as an air cylinder, a hydraulic<br>
Wylinder, a heater, a hydraulic controller are provided at the press-forming device 102 in addition to the ones shown in Fig. 3.<br>

[0023]   The speed control device 103a is to control a forming speed defined by a drive speed and so on of the die 102a.  The blank-holder force control device 103b is to control the blank-holder pressure (blank-holder force) provided by the blank holder 102e to the material to be processed 300.  The temperature control device 103c is to control the temperature of the mold.<br>
[0024]   The mold distortion measuring unit 103d is to measure a distortion of the mold by reading a detected value of the strain sensor 102b.  The punch reaction force measuring unit 103e is to measure the punch reaction force by reading a detected value of the load cell 102c.  The mold temperature measuring unit 103f is to measure the temperature of the mold and the material to be processed 300 by reading a detected value of a temperature sensor (thermocouple)<br>
Iwttached to the die 102a, the punch 102d, and so on. [0025]   The material to be processed deformation measuring unit 103g is to measure a degree of deformation of the material to be processed 300.

[0026]   The state quantity storage unit 103h is to store a history of state quantity of the press-.forming device 102 measured by the mold distortion measuring unit 103d, the punch reaction force measuring unit 103e, the mold temperature measuring unit 103f, the material to be processed deformation measuring unit 103g, the state measuring unit 103j as stated above.<br>
As stated above, in the present embodiment, a process condition control means is constituted by the control device 103.<br>
[0027]   The condition setting calculation device 104 has a forming condition input portion 104a, a material identification number input portion 104b, a material identification number transmission portion 104c, a material characteristic data receiving portion 104d, a material characteristic data decryption portion 104e, and a forming condition<br>
Icalculation portion 104f.<br>
[0028]   The forming condition input portion 104a is to input and store basic forming conditions based on an operation of an operation portion by a user.  In the present embodiment, the forming condition input portion 104a inputs the blank-holder force, the forming speed, the mold temperature, and so on as the basic forming conditions.<br>
The material identification number input portion 104b is to input the material identification number based on a user's operation for a material characteristic inquiry screen 401 as shown in Fig. 4A The material identification number transmission<br>
. portion 104c is to transmit the material identification number (production lot number) to the material characteristic data providing device 101 when a transmission button is pressed by the user after the material identification number (production lot number) is inputted for the material characteristic inquiry screen 401 shown in Fig. 4A. [0029]   The material characteristic data receiving portion 104d is to receive an encrypted material characteristic data transmitted from the material characteristic data providing device 101 as a replay for the material identification number transmitted by the material identification number transmission port ion 104 c.<br>
The material characteristic data decryption portion 104e is to decrypt the encrypted material<br>
%fcharacteristic data to be used for a calculation of the forming conditions.<br>
Incidentally, in the condition setting calculation device 104 of the present embodiment, a material characteristic receive screen 402 as shown in Fig. 4B is displayed on a monitor after the material characteristic data is received at the material characteristic data receiving portion 104d, and the material characteristic data is decrypted. However, the decrypted material characteristic data may be directly used for the calculation of the forming conditions without displaying on the monitor, to make the material characteristic data invisible for the user, and thereby, a reuse (unauthorized copy) of the material characteristic data can be prevented.<br>
[0030]   The forming condition calculation portion 104f is to calculate the forming conditions in the press-forming device 102 by using the material characteristic data received by the material characteristic data receiving portion 104d, the state quantity of the press-forming device 102 stored in the state quantity storage unit 103h, and so on. [0031]   Next, an example of operations of the press-forming system of the present embodiment is described with reference to the flow charts in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.<br>
At first, at the step SI, the press-forming system waits until the material to be processed 300<br>
set to the pres s-forming device 102.  When the material to be processed 300 is set to the press-forming device 102, the process goes to the step S2, and the material identification number input portion 104b of the condition setting calculation device 104 judges whether the material identification number is inputted and the transmission button is pressed or not based on the user's operation for the material characteristic inquiry screen 401 shown in Fig. 4A. [0032]   When the material identification number is inputted and the transmission button is pressed as a result of the above judgment, the process goes to the step S3, and the material identification number transmission portion 104c of the condition setting calculation device 104 transmits the material identification number judged to be inputted at the step S2 to the material characteristic data providing device 101.<br>
Next, at the step S4, the material identification number receiving portion lOla of the material characteristic data providing device 101 judges whether the material identification number transmitted at the step S3 is received or not. [0033]   When the material identification number is received as a result of this judgment, the process goes to the step S5, and the material characteristic search portion lOlb of the material characteristic data providing device 101 obtains the material characteristic data corresponding to the material<br>
Identification number judged to be received at the step S4 from the material characteristic database 106<br>
Next, at the step S6, the material characteristic data encryption portion lOlc of the material characteristic data providing device 101 encrypts the material characteristic data searched at the step S5.<br>
Next, at the step S7, the material characteristic data transmission portion lOld of the material characteristic data providing device 101 transmits the material characteristic data encrypted at the step S6 to the condition setting calculation device 104 .<br>
Next, at the step 38, the material characteristic data receiving portion 104d of the condition setting calculation device 104 judges whether the encrypted material characteristic data transmitted at the step S7 is received or not.<br>
[0034]   When the material characteristic data is received as a result of this judgment, the process goes to the step S9, and the material characteristic data decryption_ portion 104e of the condition setting calculation device 104 decrypts the material characteristic data.<br>
Next, at the step S10, the material<br>
characteristic data receiving portion 104d stores the decrypted material characteristic data at the step S9.<br>
Next, at the step Sll, the forming condition input portion 104a of the condition setting calculation device 104 judges whether the basic<br>
Worming conditions are inputted based on the user's operation or not.  When the basic forming conditions are inputted as a result of this judgment, the process goes to the step 512, and the forming condition input portion 104a stores the basic forming conditions inputted at the step Sll.<br>
[0035]   Next, at the step S13, the state measuring unit 103j of the control device 103 measures the hardness, the surface roughness, the friction coefficient, and so on of the material to be processed 300 which is set at the step SI, and stores the material characteristic measurement data based on the measured hardness, surface roughness, and friction coef.ficient of the material to be pro.cessed 300.<br>
Next, at the step S14, the forming condition calculation portion 104f of the condition setting calculation device 104 reads the history of the state quantity of the press-forming device 102 stored in the state quantity storage unit 103h of the control device 103.  At this time, the forming condition calculation portion 104f also reads the material characteristic measurement data stored at the step S13 .<br>
[0036]   Next, at the step S13, the forming condition calculation portion 104f corrects the forming conditions of the press-forming device 102 based on the material characteristic data stored at the step S10, the basic forming conditions stored at the step<br>
%K512, and the history of the state quantity of the press-forming device 102 and the material characteristic measurement data read at the step S14. [0037]   Concretely speaking, in the present embodiment, an initial value "C0(i)" of the forming condition is corrected by using a following (expression 1) .<br>
CO'(i) = C0(i) x (1 + I (Tl(i, j) x P(j) / P0(j) - 1))); i = 1 to L, j = 1 to M ... (expression 1)<br>
In the above-stated (expression 1), "CO' (i)" is the forming condition after the correction.  "Tl(i, j)" is an influence function matrix representing a relation between a deviation of the material characteristic of the material to be processed.300 relative to a standard value, and a correction amount of the forming condition.  "P(j)" is an actual performance value of each material characteristic. "P0(j)" is the standard value of each material characteristic.  "M" is the number of material characteristics.  "L" is the number of setting values of the forming condition.<br>
[0038]   Here, the initial value "C0(i)" of the forming conditions may be constant during the forming, or changed during the forming.  When it is changed during the forming, for example, a setting value for a stroke amount of the punch 102d may be provided. [0039]   There is a method in which respective components of the influence function matrix "Tl(i, j)" are asked from a change of an optimal forming<br>
'ifeondition (sensitivity analysis) relative to changes of various material characteristics, by using a forming simulation by a finite element method. Besides, there also is a method in which the respective components are asked statistically from a relation between a variation of the material characteristics and the forming conditions and product quality (crack, wrinkle, springback, surface distortion, and so on) in an actual mass production press.  Further, there also is a method and so on in which an actual measured value of the product quality is inputted to the press-forming device 102 as an instruction data, and for example, it is created and updated by using a learning function by a neural network.  Incidentally, a constitution and a method of formulation of the material characteristic value and the forming condition are not limited to the above, and arbitrary settings are possible. [0040]   Next, at the step S16, the control calculation unit 103i reads the forming conditions of the press-forming device 102 corrected at the step S15, and outputs a control command based on the read forming conditions to the speed control device 103a, the blank-holder force control device 103b, and the temperature control device 103c.  The speed control device 103a, the blank-holder force control device 103b, and the temperature control device 103c control the press-forming device 102 based on this control command.  Accordingly, the press-process of the<br>
Ifiaterial to be processed 300 is started. [0041]   Next, at the step S17, the mold distortion measuring unit 103d, the punch reaction force measuring unit 103e, the mold temperature measuring unit 103f, and the material to be processed deformation measuring unit 103g measure the state quantity of the press-forming device 102 during the press-process.<br>
Next, at the step S18, the forming condition calculation portion 104e judges whether a difference of the state quantity measured at the step S17 and a target state quantity defined in advance is within a tolerance range or not.  When the difference is within the tolerance range as a result of this judgment, the process goes to the step S19, and the control calculation unit 1031 judges whether the press-process (forming) of the material to be processed 300 is completed or not, for example, based on the measured result of the material to be processed deformation measuring unit 103g. [0042]   When the press-process (forming) of the material to be processed 300 is completed as a result of this judgment, the process goes to the step S20, and the state quantity measured at the step S17 is stored in the state quantity storage unit 103h.  The process then goes back to the step SI, and waits for an acceptance of the next material to be processed 300.  On the other hand, when the press-process (forming) of the material to be processed 300 is not<br>
Completed, the process goes back to the step S17, and the state quantity is measured again.<br>
[0043]   When it is judged that the difference of the state quantity measured at the step S17 and the target state quantity defined in advance is not within the tolerance range at the above-stated step S18, the process goes to the step S21, and the forming condition calculation portion 104f corrects the forming condition.  The process then goes back to the step S17, and the state quantity is measured again.<br>
[0044]   Concretely speaking, in the present embodiment, the forming condition "CO'(i)" asked by<br>
.the above-stated (expression 1) is corrected by using a following (expression 2).<br>
C(i) = CO'(i) x (1 + Z (T2(i, k) x S(k) / S0(k) -1))); i = 1 to L, k = 1 to N ... (expression 2)<br>
In the above-stated (expression 2), "C(i)" is a correction value of the forming condition.  "T2(i, k)" is an influence function matrix representing a relation between a deviation of the measured various state quantities relative to a standard value and a correction amount of the forming condition.  "S(k)" is the state quantity measured at the step S17. "S0(k)" is the standard value of the state quantity. "N" is the number of the state quantities. [0045]   There is a method in which respective components of the influence function matrix "T2(i, k)" are asked from the change of the optimal forming<br>
Condition (sensitivity analysis) relative to the changes of various material characteristics by using the forming simulation by the finite element method, as same as the respective components of the influence function matrix "Tl(i, j ) " .  Besides, there also is a method in which the respective components are asked statistically from the relation between the variation of the material characteristics and the forming condition and the product quality (crack, wrinkle, springback, surface distortion, and so on) in the actual mass production press.  Further, there also is a method and so on in which the actual measured value of the product quality is inputted to the press-forming device 102 as the instruction data, and for example, it is created and updated by using the learning function by the neural network. Incidentally, the constitution and the method of formulation of the state quantity are not limited to the above, and arbitrary settings are possible. [0046]   As stated above, in the present embodiment, the actual performance value and the standard value of the material characteristic are compared, the forming conditions such as the forming speed and the blank-holder pressure are corrected in accordance with the compared result, and the press-process of the material to be processed 300 is to be started with the corrected forming conditions.  Therefore, it becomes possible to reduce the occurrences of cracks and wrinkles as much as possible, and to suppress<br>
^Influences of variable factors difficult to predict such as the variation of the material characteristics, the environmental change when the material to be processed 300 is press-processed.  Accordingly, it becomes possible to obtain the adequate forming conditions, and to obtain good formed products. [0047]   Incidentally, in the flow charts in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, a case is described in which the forming conditions are corrected every time when one piece of material to be processed 300 is press-processed, but it is possible to correct the forming conditions by the production lot as a unit.  In this case, for example, the process is to be transferred to the step S16 not to the step SI after the process of the step S20 is completed in the flow chart in Fig. 6. [0048]   Besides, in the present embodiment, the material identification number (production lot number) is inputted by the operation of the operation portion such as a keyboard or a mouse provided at the condition setting calculation device 104, but the material identification number is not necessarily to be inputted as stated above.  For example, a barcode storing information relating to the production lot number is attached to the material to be processed 300, this information of the barcode is read by a barcode reader, the production lot number of the material to be processed 300 is discriminated from the read barcode information, and the discriminated production lot number is to be transmitted to the<br>
Wiaterial characteristic data providing device 101.<br>
Further, it can be constituted such that the production lot number stored in an 1C tag, a disk recording medium such as a flexible disk and a magnetic optical disk is to be transmitted to the material characteristic data providing device 101. [0049]   -First Example-Next, a first example of the present embodiment is described.<br>
In the present example, at first, a cold rolled high tensile strength steel sheet with a tensile strength of 590 [MPa], a sheet thickness of 1.4 [mm],<br>
a size of a sheet surface of 1000 [mm] x 500 [mm] is made to be a material to be processed.<br>
Next, the condition setting calculation device 104 receives actual performance values of the tensile strength, 0.2% proof stress, a total elongation, and the sheet thickness from the material characteristic data providing device 101 as the material characteristic data.<br>
Next, setting values of the forming speed and the blank-holder pressure are corrected by each production lot by using the above-stated (expression 1) based on the actual performance values of the material characteristics before the press-process of the material to be processed 300 is performed. Concretely speaking, for example, the standard value wPO(j)" of the material characteristics in the material to be processed 300 as in a following<br>
^expression 3), the actual performance value " P (j ) " of the material characteristics as in a (expression 4), the standard value "C0(i)" of the forming conditions as in a (expression 5), and the influence function matrix "Tl(i, j)" as shown in a (expression 6) are respectively substituted to the above-stated (expression 1), and then, the correction value "CO' (i)" of the forming conditions as in a following (expression 7) is obtained.<br>
SfOOSl]   Next, a test press is performed, and the punch reaction force measuring unit 103e and the mold distortion measuring unit 103d respectively measure the punch reaction force and the mold distortion during the forming.  After it is confirmed that the press-processed product obtained by performing the test press is a non-defective without any cracks, wrinkles, or the like, the forming condition calculation portion 104f of the condition setting calculation device 104 sets the forming speed and the blank-holder pressure obtained by the above-stated<br>
(expression 7), and measured maximum value of the punch reaction force, and maximum value of the mold distortion,.as the standard values of the state quantity.  In the example shown in the above-stated<br>
(expression 3) to (expression 7), the forming condition calculation portion 104f sets the standard value " S 0 ( k ) " of the state quantity shown in the following.<br>
 [0053]   The forming condition calculation portion 104f calculates the forming condition vC(i)" by using the above-stated (expression 2), and outputs the<br>
^Calculated forming condition "C(i)" to the control calculation unit 103i of the control device 103.  The control calculation unit 1031 starts the press-process of the material to be processed 300 based on this forming condition "C(i)".<br>
After that, the maximum value of the punch reaction force and the maximum value of the mold distortion during the forming are measured every time when the press-process is performed, and the forming speed and the blank-holder pressure are corrected in accordance with the difference between the measured maximum value of the punch reaction force and maximum value of the mold distortion, and the set standard value.<br>
[0054]   Concretely speaking, for example, when the measured value "S(k)" of the state quantity defined from the maximum value of the punch reaction force and the maximum value of the mold distortion during the forming becomes to be as shown in a following<br>
(expression 9), the forming condition calculation portion 104f substitutes the setting value "CO'(i)" of the forming condition shown in the (expression 7), the standard value " S 0 ( k ) " of the state quantity shown in the (expression 8), and the influence function matrix "T2(i, k)" shown in a following<br>
(expression 10) to the (expression 2), and obtains the correction value "C(i)" of the forming condition as shown in a following (expression 11). Incidentally, in the above description, the influence<br>
^function matrix "T2(i, k)" is to be set in advance [0055]<br>
 [0056]   As stated above, in the present example, the punch reaction force and the mold distortion during the press-process are measured in addition to the material characteristic data received from the material characteristic data providing device 101, and the forming speed and the blank-holder pressure are corrected in accordance with the measured results Therefore, it becomes possible to obtain the more adequate forming conditions of the material to be processed 300, and to obtain a better formed product.<br>
[0057]   Incidentally, in the present example, the forming speed and the blank-holder pressure are corrected every time when the press-process is performed, but they may be corrected by every plural press-processes.  Besides, the maximum value of the punch reaction force and the maximum value of the mold distortion during the press-process are made to<br>
the standard value "S0(k)" of the state quantity, but the standard value " S 0 ( k ) " of the state quantity can be set by totally judging from a time-series data of the punch reaction force and a time-series data of the mold distortion during the press-process.  For example, values at plural points of the time-series data may be used to evaluate the standard value "S0(k)" of the state quantity.<br>
[0058]   Further, in the present example, the press-process is performed without changing the forming speed and the blank-holder pressure shown in the (expression 11), but these values may be changed during the press-process in accordance with a punch stroke and so on. [0059]   -Second Example-Next, a second example of the present embodiment is described.<br>
As stated above, the condition setting calculation device 104 receives the actual performance values of the tensile strength, the 0.2% proof stress, the total elongation, and the sheet thickness from the material characteristic data providing device 101 as the material characteristic data also in the present example.  In addition, in the present example, the condition setting calculation device 104 inputs a material characteristic data which cannot be provided by the material characteristic data providing device 101, namely, the material characteristic data which cannot<br>
known by an operator of the material characteristic data providing device 101, based on an operation by a user of the operation portion provided at the condition setting calculation device 104. Incidentally, here, a case is described as an example when an actual performance value of a lubricant film thickness is inputted as an example of such material characteristic data.<br>
[0060]   The forming condition calculation portion 104f corrects the forming conditions such as the forming speed and the blank-holder pressure by using the (expression 1) based on the received material characteristic data and the inputted material characteristic data.<br>
Concretely speaking, for example, the forming conditions are corrected by substituting the standard value "P0(j)" of the material characteristics shown in a following (expression 12), the influence function matrix "T1(i, j ) " shown in a following<br>
(expression 13), and the actual performance value "P(j)" of the material characteristics defined from the above-stated material characteristic data to the<br>
(expres sion 1) .<br>
[0061]<br>
[Formula 4]<br><br>
 [0062]   As stated above, in the present example, the forming conditions are corrected with considering the material characteristic data which can be known only at the user side using the condition setting calculation device 104, in addition to the material characteristic data received from the material characteristic data providing device 101, and therefore, it is possible to suppress an influence of variable factors such as a lubricity between the mold and the material to be processed 300 and a surface property, in addition to the variation of the material characteristics and the environmental change Accordingly, a more adequate forming condition can be obtained.<br>
[0063]   -Third Example-Next, a third example of the present embodiment is described.<br>
As stated above, the condition setting calculation device 104 receives the actual<br>
""performance values of the tensile strength, the 0.2% proof stress, the total elongation, and the sheet thickness from the material characteristic data providing device 101 as the material characteristic data also in the present example.  However, in the present example, a representative value of the production lot (for example, the representative value of 100 sheets of materials to be processed 300) is received as the material characteristic data.<br>
[0064]   Besides, in the present example, the condition setting calculation device 104 inputs the material characteristic data having a large variety depending on the material to be processed 300, based on the operation of the operation portion by the user provided at the condition setting calculation device 104.  In the present embodiment, an actual performance value of Vickers hardness of the material to be processed 300 before the press-process is inputted as an example of such material characteristic data.<br>
[0065]   The forming condition calculation portion 104f corrects the forming conditions such as the forming speed and the blank-holder pressure by using the (expression 1) based on the received material characteristic data and the inputted material characteristic data.<br>
Concretely speaking, for example, the standard value "P0(j)" of the material characteristics shown in a following (expression 14), the influence<br>
^function matrix "11(1, j)" shown in a following (expression 15), and the actual performance value "P(j)" of the material characteristics defined from the above-stated material characteristic data are substituted to the (expression 1) to set the forming conditions. [0066]<br>
 [0067]   As stated above, in the present example, the material characteristic data which has a large effect on the press-process unless it is considered by each material to be processed 300, is measured at the user side separately, and the forming conditions are corrected with considering the measured material characteristic data.  Iherefore, it is possible to press-process the material to be processed 300 adequately even if the material characteristic data received from the material characteristic data providing device 101 is the representative value of<br>
e production lot. [0068]   -Fourth example-Next, a fourth example of the present embodiment is des cribed.<br>
As stated above, the condition setting calculation device 104 receives the actual<br>
performance values of the tensile strength, the 0.2% proof stress, the total elongation, and the sheet thickness from the material characteristic data providing device 101 as the material characteristic data also in the present example.  In addition, in the present example, when the punch reaction force during the press-process exceeds a tolerance range, the blank-holder pressure is adjusted so that the punch reaction force is within the tolerance range, and the press-process is continued with the adjusted bank-holder pressure.<br>
[0069]   Concretely speaking, for example, the standard value "P0(j)" of the material characteristics in the material to be processed 300 as in a following (expression 16), the actual performance value "P(j)" of the material characteristics as in a (expression 17), the standard value "00(1)" of the forming conditions as in a (expression 18), and the influence function matrix "Tl(i, j)" as shown in a (expression 19) are respectively substituted to the (expression 1), and the correction value "CO'(i)" of the forming conditions as in a following (expression 20) can be<br>
 [0071]   The press-process is started in accordance with the correction value "CO'(i)" of the forming conditions.  After the press-process is started, the punch reaction force during the press-process is measured by using the punch reaction force measuring unit 103e as stated above, and the maximum value of the measured punch reaction force is stored in a recording medium provided at the condition setting calculation device 104 every time when the press-<br>
rocess is performed.<br>
The forming condition calculation portion 104f of the condition setting calculation device 104 judges whether a moving average value of 10 points of the punch reaction forces stored in the recording medium is within the tolerance range which is set in advance or not, and when it is not within the tolerance range, the blank-holder pressure is adjusted as stated above, and the press-process is continued.<br>
[0072]   In an example shown in Fig. 7, a moving average 703 of 10 points of a measured value 702 of the punch reaction force exceeds the tolerance range<br>
(450 [Ton] or more and 550 [Ton] or less) when the press-processes are performed for approximately 50 times.  Accordingly, a blank-holder pressure 701 is reduced from 150 [Ton] to 145 [Ton], and the press-process is continued to make the moving average 703 of the 10 points of the measured values 702 of the punch reaction force is within the tolerance range.<br>
[0073]   Concretely speaking, for example, when the measured value "S(k)" of the state quantity defined from the maximum value of the punch reaction force becomes as in an (expression 21) shown in the following, the correction value "CO'(i)" of the forming conditions shown in the (expression 20), the influence function matrix "T2(i, k)" as in a following (expression 22), and the standard value "S0(k)" of the state quantity as in a following<br>
(expression 23) are substituted to the (expression 2),<br>
the correction value "C(i)" of the forming conditions as in a following (expression 24) is obtained.  Incidentally, in the above description, the influence function matrix "T2(i, k)" is to be set in advance. [0074]<br>
, the blank-holder pressure is adjusted so that the punch reaction force is within the tolerance range when the punch reaction force during the press-process exceeds the tolerance range, and the press-process is continued with the adjusted blank-holder pressure, in addition to the material characteristic data received from the material characteristic data providing device 101.  Therefore, it becomes possible to reduce the occurrence of defective products nd to perform the press-process of the predetermined number of materials to be processed 300 more adequately.<br>
[0076]   Incidentally, in the present example, a case is described as an example when the blank-holder pressure is adjusted so that the punch reaction force is within the tolerance range, and the press-process is continued with the adjusted blank-holder pressure. However, it is not limited to the embodiment as stated above, and at least any one of the blank-holder pressure, the forming speed, or the mold temperature may be adjusted so that the state quantity exceeding the tolerance range is within the tolerance range, when the state quantity of at least, any one of the punch reaction force, the mold temperature, the mold distortion amount, the deformation amount of the material to be processed 300, or the temperature of the material to be processed 300 exceeds the tolerance range during the press-process.<br>
[0077]   Besides, a current value and an actual performance value in the past of the state quantity such as the punch reaction force are compared, and process conditions such as the blank-holder pressure may be adjusted in accordance with the compared result.  Concretely speaking, for example, when a difference between the current value and the actual performance value in the past of the state quantity such as the punch reaction force exceeds a<br>
%f)redetermined value, the blank-holder pressure is adjusted so that the difference does not exceed the predetermined value.<br>
Further, the moving average value of the 10 points of the state quantity of the punch reaction force and so on is to be judged whether it is within the tolerance range set in advance or not, but the moving average value of the state quantity within a predetermined time may be judged whether it is within the tolerance range set in advance or not. [0078]   -Fifth Example-Next, a fifth example of the present embodiment is described.<br>
As stated above, the c.ondition setting calculation device 104 receives the actual<br>
performance values of the tensile strength, the 0.2% proof stress, the total elongation, and the sheet thickness from the material characteristic data providing device 101 as the material characteristic data also in the present example.  However, in the present example, the received material characteristic data is encrypted in the material characteristic data providing device 101, and the press-forming is performed in a procedure described in the first example after the material characteristic data is decrypted in the condition setting calculation device 104.  At this time, the material characteristic data providing device 101 is managed by a material manufacturer, and a transmission history file (client<br>
%?iame, connection date and time, amount of transmission data, and so on) is updated every time when the material characteristic data is transmitted to a customer using the condition setting calculation device 104.  The transmission history file is periodically aggregated to bill in accordance with a total communication amount.  Accordingly, it is possible for the customer to obtain accurate material characteristic data by each material while securing a confidentiality of the data.  Therefore, it is not necessary for the operator to experientially correct the forming conditions each time, and an effect can be obtained in which a quality variation of the formed products is reduced.  Besides, works to prepare a conventional paper-based mil sheet are drastically reduced for the material manufacturer by the encryption and the billing.  In addition, effects of preventing reuses (unauthorized copy) of the material characteristic data, and further enabling to cover administrative and maintenance expense of this system can be obtained, while securing the confidentiality of the material characteristic data.
