				<td>The invention concerns a sliver-delivering machine and a sliver coiler (can press, can coiler) which is coupled to this machine, the machine being, in particular, a carding machine and possessing a drive for the sliver delivery elements and the sliver coiler possessing its own separate drive.<br>
Such arrangements are known from e.g. EP-A-512683, DE-C-3734425 and WO 92/04266. The advantages of the sliver coiler possessing its own drive (known as an "autonomous sliver coiler") are stated in DE-C-3734425. The drive for the sliver coiler is normally controlled by means of a sensor signal which samples the sliver feed between the card outlet and the sliver coiler. This signal is used to control a feedback control device provided specially for the sliver coiler drive. Other products (e.g. the Triitzschler DK760 card) comprise so-called servo shafts or servo-oxes which are controlled by an integral control device, each shaft being controlled separately. Such servo shafts are described in US-4530134, but without a sliver coiler (can press).<br>
Although the known devices operate perfectly they are expensive, either because they require additional elements or because the elements themselves are expensive, or both.<br>
There is a modem drive system for a textile machine based on frequency conversion - see, for example, "Three-phase motors with frequency converters for textile machines" (Textil Praxis International 1992, January, Page 37, 38). This type of drive for the card is described in e.g. DD-A-224626, a number of (single) converters being used in this case. Surprisingly, it transpires that such drive systems can be extended to include the sliver coiler. This is surprising because the document states that faulty drafts can easily occur in the sliver run between the machine and the sliver coiler and it is assumed that faulty drafts cannot be avoided without special drive system measures.<br>
According to this invention, the drive for the sliver delivering elements of the machine and the drive for the sliver coiler each have one or more frequency-controlled three-phase motors, and there is a common frequency converter or pair of frequency converters for supplying power to these motors, the paired converters being coupled together in order to produce the same output frequency or output frequencies in a reselectable ratio. The three-phase motors are preferably asynchronous motors, i.e., motors which have a slip such that they exhibit a load-dependent speed characteristic at a constant supply frequency. Such a characteristic can be used (in spite of the risk of a faulty draft) because it transpires that the load variations to be anticipated in operation exhibit types of behavior at the determining points which are so similar that in practice the difference in the relative speed errors (i.e. the speed difference relative to the synchronous speeds) remains within very narrow limits (acceptable tolerances).<br><br>
Accordingly, the invention proposes a drive system for a sliver-producing textile machine, characterized in that both the sliver-delivering elements and the sliver coiler are driven by motors which have a load-dependent speed characteristic. The drive system comprises, preferably, a motor control unit which is designed so that any motor slip produced during operation remains within predefinable limits. The control unit preferably possesses a controllable power circuit which supplies the said motors. Preferably, the frequency of the electric power supplied by the power circuit is controllable, the power circuit comprising, for example, one or more frequency converters and the said motors then preferably being controllable by means of the supply frequency.<br>
For reasons of cost, three-phase asynchronous motors (squirrel-cage motors) are normally chosen, but the use of other motors capable of being controlled by the supply frequency (e.g. reluctance motors or even synchronous motors) is not precluded. The preferred type of motor is the so-called geared motor. The effective speed of such a motor is affected by both the supply frequency and the transformation or reduction ratio of the gear assigned to the motor. The gear can comprise change points so that the effective speed can be set for a given supply voltage. Preferably, however, the complete system is arranged so that change points are not necessary.<br>
The drive for the sliver coiler can comprise a number of motors, for example a first motor for the sliver feed rollers and the tube gear and a second motor for the revolving disc. Alternatively, there may be only one motor in the sliver coiler (of DE-C-3734425), in which case the motor power must then be transferred mechanically between the upper and lower parts of the sliver coiler.<br>
The invention is of particular importance in the card, due to the fact that the acceptable tolerances for faulty drafts in the intermediate product of this machine are wider than, for example, in connection with a regulated second passage draw frame. The invention is therefore not intended for use in the autoleveller draw frame.<br>
Present card delivery speeds range from 10 m/min. to 300 m/min. The sliver count normally lies within the range of 3.5 to 6.5 kit. The drive motors for the sliver-delivering elements of the card (outlet) have rotational speeds of between 150 and 4500 rpm at supply frequencies of between 5 and 150 Hz. A frequency converter power output of between 1.5 and 3 kyat is required to supply power to both the card outlet and the sliver coiler.<br>
Examples of the invention are now described in greater detail, with reference to the embodiments illustrated in the figures.<br>

Fig. 6 shows a schematic representation of a first variant according to this invention.<br>
Fig. 6A shows a detail from Fig. 6.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a second variant according to the invention.<br>
The card unit shown in Figure 1 comprises a feeding chute 20 which contains fibre material from a flock conveyor system 22, indicated in schematic form, fi"om which it forms a batt 24 which is transferred to the feed device 26 of the card 28. The card itself is of conventional construction, with a licker-in 30, a cylinder 32, a revolving flat device 34 and a doffer 36 which forms part of the output 38. The output is described below with reference to Figures 2 and 3. Formed within the card output is a sliver 44 which is delivered to the sliver coiler (can press or can coiler) 42 where the sliver is laid in coils in a can 40.<br>
The output according to Fig. 2 comprises, in addition to the doffer 36, a take-off roller 46, a cleaning roller 48, a transfer roller 50 and a pair of gripping rollers 52. Reference 54 denotes a suction extraction system which is not directly relevant to this invention and is not described farther. The arrangement illustrated has been described, in a substantially simplified form, in the Swiss Patent Applications 2673/93 of 8th September 1993 and 142/94 of 18th January 1994.<br>
Fig. 3 again shows a gripping roller 52, viewed fool above, in combination with a so-called crossband 56 by means of which the web 58 delivered from the pair of gripping rollers is deflected laterally and combined by means of a deflection roller 60 to form a sliver 40 (see also Fig. 1) (e.g. according to EP-A-549534). The sliver 40 is drawn off by means of a pair of stepped rollers 62 through a fiinnel 64 and delivered food the card (machine) 28 at a predefined speed. A unit comprising a pair of stepped rollers suitable for this purpose is described in EP-A-370232.<br>
The sliver coiler 42 is an autonomous machine with its own drive (as explained more fully below) and can be installed as required in relation to the card 28. It comprises a fi-ame 66 (Fig. 4) with a top section 68, a base section 70 and, located between these, a can mounting section (without reference number). The main working elements of the sliver coiler are shown in schematic form in Fig. 5 and comprise<br>
a revolving plate 72 in the base section 70<br>
a tube gear 74 in the top section 68<br>
a pair of feed rollers 76 above (or below) the tube gear 74 The can 40 is positioned on the revolving plate 72 and fastened (by means not illustrated) so as to be incapable of rotation relative to the plate 72. The revolving plate 72 is rotated around a vertical axis by means of the sliver coiler drive described below, the can 40 being driven together with the disc. The tube gear 74 is rotated, independently of the sliver coiler drive, around a second vertical axis (e.g. according to EP-A-394773), the sliver 44 being drawn over a guide 78 into the can 40 where it is laid in coils of a predefined form. The sliver is passed into the guide channel 78 through the pair of guide rollers 76, each of the rollers being rotated around its own horizontal longitudinal axis by the sliver coiler drive.<br><br>
An embodiment of a drive for the card itself is described in e.g. the German Utility Model Application G 9312638.7 of 24th August 1993. The drive comprises a main drive motor (not illustrated) for the cylinder 32 (Fig. 1) and the revolving flat 34. The main drive motor can be constructed according to e.g. EP-A-557242. There is also a drive motor 80 for the doffer 38 and the other working elements of the output 38 up to and including the pair of stepped rollers 62 (Fig. 3), as indicated schematically in Fig. 1 by the arrows radiating from the drive 80.<br>
The drive for the sliver coiler 42 can be assumed to be a drive according to DE-C-3734425 in which the sliver coiler drive comprises either one or, if necessary, two three-phase motors which (or each of which) is controlled by means of a frequency converter assigned solely to the sliver coiler. The output frequency of the converter is determined basically by a signal generated by sliver feed rollers. The sHver feed rollers according to DE-C-3734425 correspond to the stepped rollers 62 (Fig. 3). According to DE-C-3734425, a signal is also derived from a fine-adjustment sensor which samples the tension of a sliver loop, forming a closed-loop control circuit. The sliver coiler is practically "fully autonomous" in relation to the textile machine (which is not illustrated in the DE Patent Specification) since it is possible to derive a signal from the sliver feed rollers without the necessity for altering the design of the machine itself To achieve this, it is necessary, however, for the sliver coiler to possess elements which are actually already present in the machine, the control signals required for the sliver coiler also being already "available" in the machine itself<br>
Fig. 6 shows, in schematic form, a first variant according to this invention in which reference 82 denotes the casing of the card output section and reference 80 again denotes the drive for the output. In a cost-effective embodiment, this drive 80 comprises a sleeplessly controllable maintenance-free asynchronous motor 83 (e.g. a squirrel-cage motor) which is supplied with electrical power by means of a frequency converter 84. The output frequency of the converter 84 can be set through an input unit 86 integrated into the card programmable controller 88. An arrangement of this type is presently the common state of the art for the card, i.e., the elements 80, 83, 84, 86 and 88 (or their equivalents) are virtually indispensable for a modem card.<br>
The converter 84 normally comprises a rectifier 90 (Fig. 6A) which receives alternating current from a 3-phase network and delivers direct current to an intermediate circuit 92. A controllable power circuit 94 converts direct current from the intermediate circuit 92 into alternating current having a frequency which is determined by a converter controller using a signal from the controller unit 88. This (single-phase or three-phase) alternating current is delivered to the motor 83.<br>
The output frequency of the frequency converter 84 defines, as a single value, the synchronous speed of the motor 83. The effective rotational speed of the motor shaft, however, is not solely dependent on this synchronous speed. This speed also depends on the load to which the motor is subjected, i.e., a so-called "slip" is produced in the motor 83 between the rotor and the stator. This fact alone would not cause any problem at all if the slip were predictable. In practice, however, it varies continuously in relation to the instantaneous load ratios, which cannot be precisely predicted.<br>
Accordingly, the known systems have employed special measures of one kind or another in order to allow for the continuously varying ratios, with resultant increased constructional complexity and costs.<br><br>
Although the slip cannot be controlled, the "slip behavior" (i.e. the progression of the slip variations in relation to load changes) can be estimated with respect to both direction and order of magnitude. In the output section, this relates essentially to frictional losses and compression work, for example as the sliver is drawn through the funnel 64 (Fig. 3). Such load components are dependent on the sliver count and the delivery speed. Over a delivery speed range of up to 300 m/min. it is possible to select asynchronous motors which have a maximum slip of 3% under these conditions.<br>
The frequency converter 84 will normally be designed so that it is also capable of supplying the necessary power to the sliver coiler, this being due to the fact that the card must be constructed for driving a mechanically coupled sliver coiler. There is therefore no problem in tapping off from the converter output the energy required for an "autonomous" sliver coiler, e.g. by means of a socket output 99 in the card casing 82, and feeding this via a cable 98 to a drive motor 100 for the sliver coiler. The motor 100 is a simple three-phase geared motor which, like the motor 83, is controlled directly by the power derived fool the frequency converter.<br>
In the variant according to Fig. 6, the arrangement corresponds to the sliver coiler according to DE-C-3734425 insofar as the motor 100 directly drives the working elements of the top section and indirectly drives the working elements of the base section through a drive 102 and a transmission medium 104. In this variant, the slip behavior of the motor 100 is the same as the corresponding behavior of the motor 83, due to the fact that it is determined by the same operating parameters. This means that the anticipated difference between the slip occurring in the motor 83 and that occurring in the motor 100 is approximately constant, with a consequent absence of significant faulty drafts (draft variations). This unexpected outcome of a closer examination of the overall system permits the use of a motor 100 which, like the motor 83, can be selected on the basis of cost-effectiveness.<br>
The variant according to Fig. 7 differs from that according to Fig. 6 insofar as there is a motor 106 for the working elements of the top section 68 and a motor 108 for the working elements of the base section 70. Power is supplied to each motor 106, 108 of the sliver coiler drive directly from the frequency converter 84 via the cable 98. In this variant, the power to be delivered by the motor 108 varies according to the fining of the can. This can result in the slip difference between the motor 106 and the motor 108 varying by an order of magnitude of 1 to 2%. However, this variation during filling of a can is not serious - it results only in a sought variation in the separations between the first and the last coils, which is not significant for further processing.<br>
Draft changes can be effected by change wheels in the gears. In the preferred solution there is no change wheel in the gear between the motor 83 and the pair of stepped rollers 62 since otherwise, if there is no draft change, a transformation or reduction ratio change at this point necessitates a corresponding change by the change wheels of the motor 100 or 106 which determine the draft.<br>
Application of the invention is dependent on the slip behaviors of the drive for the machine output being the same as that of the sliver coiler drive. This requirement can be fulfilled even if not all elements in the output are driven by a single motor. Normally, however, the output between the doffer and the delivery point will be actuated by only one drive source.<br><br>
