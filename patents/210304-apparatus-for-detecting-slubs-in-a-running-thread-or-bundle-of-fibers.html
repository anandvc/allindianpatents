Case No. 99 00 75<br>
Apparatus for Detecting Slubs in a Running Thread or Bundle of Fibers<br>
Description<br>
This invention relates to an apparatus for detecting slubs in a running thread or bundle of fibers, comprising a fork-like guiding member fixed at one end, which can be deflected in running direction of the thread or bundle of fibers and can be returned to the starting position by spring force, through whose gap of adjustable width the thread or the bundle of fibers is running, and which is coupled with a movement detector.<br>
Detectors for detecting slubs have already been used, in which the thread or the bundle of fibers passes through a gap between two plates, one plate being pivotally mounted. The gap is defined by the parallel edges of the two plates; a slub in the thread or in the bundle of fibers swivels the movable plate downwards, and this swivel movement is detected by a detector. This system is rather sluggish and furthermore has the disadvantage that slubs get caught at the plate edges, which frequently leads to broken threads. Agglutinations as a result of lubricant deposits make the known system even more sluggish in operation, and cleaning is necessary relatively frequently. For this purpose, the spinning operation must disadvantageously be interrupte.In CA 9l1717 A a similar apparatus is described, in which the thread or the bundle of fibers passes through the gap of a fork-like guiding member formed by a leaf spring fixed at one end. In the case of a slub of the thread or the bundle of fibers, the guiding member is slightly deflected in running direction of the thread or the bundle of fibers. By means of the strain gauge mounted on the leaf spring, the<br><br>
-2-<br>
amount of deflection is detected and evaluated for instance by means of a frequency detector.<br>
It is the object underlying the invention to remedy this deficiency and detect slubs in a running thread or a bundle of fibers in a simple and operationally reliable way. The thread or the bundle of fibers with the slub should be able to run on easily, as it is advantageous in particular for spinning plants.<br>
An apparatus for detecting slubs in a running thread (2) or bundle of fibers, comprising a fork-like guiding member (4) fixed at one end, which can be deflected in running direction of the thread or bundle of fibers and can be returned to the starting position by spring force, through whose gap of adjustable width the thread or the bundle of fibers is running and which is connected with a movement detector (10), characterized in that the guiding member (4) is attached to an axis of rotation (5) and the portion of the gap facing away from the axis of rotation is divergent while the portion of the gap facing the axis of rotation is parallel.<br>
Further advantageous aspects of the apparatus as claimed in claim 1 are included in claims 2 to 6.<br>
The guiding member cooperates with a helical spring such that the guiding member which has been moved away from the starting position by a slub of the thread or bundle of fibers is returned to its starting position.<br>
The apparatus in accordance with the invention is represented in the drawing by way of example and will be explained below. In the accompanying drawing :<br><br>
-    2a-<br>
Fig. 1	shows the apparatus in a horizontal section along line M of Pig. 2<br>
in a schematic representation, and<br>
Fig, 2	shows the apparatus in a vertical section along ling II-II of Fig. 1.<br>
On a vertical wail(l), which for instance belongs to a spinning plant, the apparatus for detecting slubs in a thread(2) is disposed. In Figs. 1 and 2 it is assumed that the thread(2) is moving vertically from the top to the bottom in the direction of the arrow(3), for instance through a draw-off mechanism which is not shown here.<br><br>
-3-<br>
The thread(2) passes through a fork-like guiding member(4), whose gap is formed by the two pins(4a,4b). The pins(4a,4b), which may be ceramic-coated pins, form a parallel gap in the portion facing the axis of rotation(5) and a diverging gap in the portion facing away from the axis of rotation(5). The spacing of the pins(4a,4b) may be adjustable, which is, however, not represented in the drawing.<br>
The guiding member(4) is attached to the horizontal axis of rotation(5), which is pivotally mounted in the housing(6). Through an opening(6a) in the housing(6) the guiding member(4) extends to the outside. To the axis of rotation(5), there is connected a lever arm(7) serving as signal arm, which by means of a helical spring (8) can be moved back into the starting position to a stationary stop(9), cf Fig, 2. The lever arm(7) extends through an opening(la) in the vertical wall(l).<br>
When the running thread(2) has a slub, the slub briefly exerts a force acting in running direction of the thread(2) onto the guiding member(4), which force swivels the guiding member(4) downwards, as is represented in Fig. 2 in broken lines. The impact caused by the slub is relatively small, and the slub itself can slide downwards on the pins(4a,4b). Due to the diverging enlargement of the spacing of the pins(4a,4b) in the portion facing away from the axis of rotation(5), the guiding member(4) again releases the thread after a short swivel movement, which thread can thus run on undisturbed. At the same time, the guiding member(4), which has been returned by the spring force of the helical spring(8), swivels back into the starting position. When the thread(2) comes from a spinning plant, it has already cooled down when reaching the guiding member(4) and is no longer or hardly plastic.<br>
The construction has been made such that agglutinations and malfunctions, in particular due to lubricant being deposited, cannot occur. This is achieved by enclosed bearings and a largely closed housing(6).<br>
When the guiding member(4) is swivelled in running direction of the thread(2), the lever arm(7) is swivelled upwards, as is represented in Fig. 2 in broken lines. The lever arm (7) moves away from the range of action of a detector(l0), which is stationarily mounted. This movement of the lever arm(7) is indicated by the detector(l0) in a manner known per se, so that for instance the attraction of an operator is attracted. The operator now is able to take the necessary measures and perform for instance cleaning work on the spinning plant. To be able to change the restoring force of the helical spring(8), the lever arm(7) has a<br><br>
-4-<br>
plurality of eyelets(ll), into which the helical spring(8) can optionally be hung. In addition, the helical spring(8) can be connected with a system of adjustable length, e.g. a threaded pin(8a), cf. Fig. 2, so that an infinitely variable adjustment of the spring force is possible.<br><br>
