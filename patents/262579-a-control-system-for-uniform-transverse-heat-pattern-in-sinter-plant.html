BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates broadly to a sinter plant and, more particularly, to a control system for uniform transverse temperature distribution across a sinter plant to improve sinter quality and thereby improving productivity.<br>
2.	DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Sinter is a very important raw material for blast furnace. Sintering is a process where raw materials like iron ore fines, coke breeze and even limestone, dolomite etc. are agglomerated together. Raw materials are collected at different bunkers and are allowed to fall in a conveyer in certain proportion. The raw materials are passed through a drum called "Nodulising Drum", for proper mixing of raw materials. Water is sprayed on dry raw-mix to form granules. Subsequently sinter-mix granules are transported by conveyer to a bunker. From this bunker wet sinter-mix is charged to sinter machine pallet through a drum feeder. The flow of raw-mix passes through a furnace called ignition furnace where its uppermost layer is first ignited. As coke present in raw-mix burns through combustion, its components are fused and sinter is formed. The machine speed is adjusted in such a manner that just at the discharging end, whole raw material is converted into sinter and sintering process is completed.<br>
The exhaust gas temperature in wind boxes just below the pallet is an index for assessing progress of sintering. In most of the conventional sinter plants, the exhaust gas temperature in wind boxes is measured with the help of thermocouples installed just beneath the pallet. The temperatures of last three wind boxes are very crucial, as they indicate the completion of sintering. The burn through point (BTP) temperature is attained at the last wind box. BTP is the maximum temperature at the last wind box. At BTP the combustion at bottommost layer of raw-mix is in progress. The sharp decline in temperature after BTP indicates that combustion is completed at ail layers and all raw-mix layers are fully sintered. The BTP control system monitors the last three wind box temperature and controls the machine speed in such a manner that sintering is just completed at the last wind box.<br>
Known prior arts for a control system for temperature distribution across a sinter plant to improve sinter quality include EP Pat. No. 1466718 dated 2004-10-13 to Chung and Allanic; US Pat. application No. 2003222066 dated 2003-12-04 to Low and Ake; WO Pat. Application No.9511100 dated 1995-04-27 to Benda and Parasco; JP Pat. No. 63241124 dated 1988-10-06 to Nakahara; GB Pat. No. 1131842 dated 1968-10-30 to Metallgeseltschaft AG and GB Pat. No. 1046729 dated 1966-10-26 to Sawada.<br><br>
3<br>
In EP Pat. No. 1466718 there is provided a method and apparatus for forming three dimensional objects by laser sintering that utilizes a broad area thermal vision system such as an infrared camera that can measure multiple temperatures across the target area and use that temperature data as feed back to a control system that both adjusts a zoned radiant heater system and adjusts scan speed and laser power to control temperatures across the target area.<br>
A thermocouple control system for selective laser sintering part bed temperature control has been delineated in US Pat. application No. 2003222066. The said system comprises of thermocouple disposed within a part bed of the sintering machine and a temperature transmitter in communication with the thermocouple. As per their invention the control circuitry, in communication with control logic, controls the part bed temperature.<br>
WO Pat. Application No.9511100 discloses a temperature-controlled laser sintering system. The power control circuit controls a modulator that modulates the power of the laser beam so as to maintain the thermal radiation emission (and thus the temperature at the sintering location) at a substantially constant<br>
level.<br>
To improve productivity of a sintering machine of an exhaust gas circulation system without degrading cold strength, by controlling a temperature of circulating gas by adjustment of steam pressure in an evaporation part of a waste heat boiler through which an exhaust gas is passed, a method for controlling temperature of circulating gas for sintering has been disclosed in JP Pat. No. 63241124.<br>
GB Pat. No. 1131842 narrates improvements in or relating to sintering machine. In this patent a control system for the speed of the conveyer of a sintering machine has been disclosed. The location of the maximum of the temperature curve along the conveyer is determined by feeding signals representing the temperatures in suction-boxes.<br>
Two sets of controlling variables, including the temperature and pressure of the waste gases is monitored are monitored by automatic control systems as delineated by GB Pat. No. 1131842.<br>
After an exhaustive study on the relevant patent documents and on existing conventional sinter plant it has been found that air filtration velocity is more by the side of the pallet than at the middle. This is known as "Rim Zone" effect. This differential air velocity causes non-uniform sintering across the pallet width causing differential exhaust gases temperatures across the width of pallet. Due to rim zone effect, sintering is not uniformly completed across pallet width. This seriously affects the quality of sinter, which is a very important raw material for blast furnace. Conventional way to avoid this non-uniform temperature distribution is to slow down the sinter machine speed so that raw-mix gets<br><br>
4<br>
sufficient time for sintering. However, this will result in lowering the productivity level, which cannot be compromised.<br>
Thus, it would be desirable to devise a sintering system, and more particularly, more particularly, a control system for uniform transverse temperature distribution across a sinter plant to improve sinter quality and thereby improving productivity, that obviates the pitfalls of current sintering schemes and provides an evenly sintered part.<br>
3. SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>

5. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The methodology adopted in the present invention is to control the sinter bed height and consequently air filtration velocity across the pallet width to attain uniform transverse temperature pattern as depicted in Fig. 3. This methodology is based on the concept that more bed height corresponds to less air filtration velocity and less bed height corresponds to more air filtration velocity. The control system facilitates a unique method of adjusting bed height of sinter-mix in pallet in order to attain uniform temperature across the width.<br><br>
8<br>
In order to monitor temperature across pallet, the transverse cross sectional area of pallet is logically divided into three zones. The mid point temperature of every zone is an indicative of average temperature of respective zone. It is measured by K-type thermocouples (1) installed with tip exactly at the centre of each zone. Mid point temperature of every zone is measured for the last three wind-boxes to monitor width-wise temperature variation as welt as BTP detection. Fig. 5 illustrates the thermocouple (1) installation in order to monitor temperature across pallet, according to the present invention.<br>
Charging of raw-mix from bunker to pallet can be regulated by sector gate. The opening or closing of this sector gate defines the bed height. However, with only one sector gate, bed height is uniform across the pallet width. As pallet is logically divided in three zones, three sector gates are installed to facilitate bed height variation across the pallet width. Position of these sector gates is varied by means of three electro mechanical actuators. The data acquisition system is implemented through Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) acting as Level - 1 automation (7) and a high level PC acting as Level - 2 (8). These have been delineated in Fig. 6. The temperature data of the last three wind-boxes and machine speed are analysed by a logic-based rules in Level - 2 PC (5). The application of the said logic-based rules calculates the desired sector gate opening / closing position to attain uniform transverse heat pattern. The valve position set points are downloaded to PLC that finally drives the actuator through MCB panels (3).<br>
The present invention has been tested in Sinter Plant # 2 of Durgapur Steel Plant (DSP). The total length between furnace and discharge end in Sinter Plant # 2 of DSP is found to be approximately 66 m and width 3 m. the air required for combustion of raw-mix is made available by creating a suction under the bed by a high capacity exhauster. Air permeates through the sinter mix in sinter bed and moves towards exhauster through series of wind-boxes along the length of sinter machine just below the pallet. The air, thus, helps in agglomerating the raw-mix layer by layer. There are 33 wind boxes connected to the wind main at Sinter Plant # 2 of DSP. A temperature distribution pattern at different wind box location according to the present invention is depicted in Fig. 4.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates the system configuration according to the present invention. The Level - 0 of automation (6) system comprises of a means for temperature transmission (2), a plurality of K-type thermocouples (1), a digital encoder, a plurality of actuators and a plurality of isolators. Level - 1 of the said automation (7) system consists of Schneider Electrics(tm) PLC, a plurality of input / output cards and Ethernet data highway. The logic-based rules reside in a PC-based system that in turn is a part of Level - 2 (8) of the said automation system. The Level - 2 (8) is connected to Level - 1 (7) through the said high-speed Ethernet data highway.<br><br>
9<br>
The logic-based rules are developed in modular form using high level object oriented logics. The communication driver between the said PLC platform and the said object oriented logics is developed using concepts of OPC (Object Linking and Embedding for Process Control). The data logging and control rule-based systems are developed on PLC using Schneider Electrics, PL7 Pro PLC standard software. Operator's friendly Human Machine Interface (HMI) has been developed to facilitate the users with graphics, trends, reports, etc. The logic-based rules for HMI have been run in Schneider Electrics, Vijeo Look HMI.<br>
The developed control system calculates the desired gate opening with respect to actual sinter bed temperature profile. The gate position set-points are downloaded to PLC that finally actuates the sector gates for adjusting the material flow at centre and both sides of pallet to maintain uniform width-wise<br>
temperature.<br>
In the present invention, the three sector gate positions are derived from mathematical correlation equations, logic-based rules and plant production schedule. The mathematical correlation equations are used to calculate the average deviation of different zonal temperatures. The average zone temperature is calculated for a cycle of 03 minutes by the following equations (1), (2) and (3).<br><br>
where,  Tcox = average temperature on coke oven (co) side at ith iteration; <br>
Tmdx = average temperature on middle (md) at ith iteration; <br>
Tofx = average temperature on blast furnace (bf) side at ith iteration; and<br>
x = wind boxes.<br>
N = No. of interations<br>
The total average zonal temperature is derived by the following equations (4) through (6).<br><br><br>
10<br><br>
where,   ? = number of wind-boxes for which trial is conducted; <br>
             x = wind boxes; <br>
TAvg8 = average temperature on coke oven (co) side;<br>
TAvgbf = average temperature on blast furnace (bf) side; and <br>
TAvgmd = average temperature on middle (md).<br>
The temperature deviations are calculated as follows:<br><br>
The sector gate control signal is generated depending upon desired values of difference as shown in equations (7) and (8). Based on ?T8and ?Tbf, the inventive control system generates signal to open or shut the sector gates for a determined values of ?SG8 ?SGbf and ?SGmd. A flow chart of the said logic-based system to calculate sector gate value position according to the present invention has been indicated in Fig. 7. The ?SG8, ASGbfand ASGmdare defined below:<br>
?SG8 = determined values for sector gate opening of coke oven (co) side;<br>
?SGbf = determined values for sector gate opening of blast furnace (bf) side; and<br>
?SGmd = determined values for sector gate opening of middle (md).<br>
Accompanying Fig. 8 illustrates a HMI screen indicating the exhaust gas temperature of the said last three wind boxes, machine speed etc. according to the present invention and Fig. 9 delineates a HMI screen elucidating trend of three temperatures, viz., left, center and right, of a particular wind box according to the present invention.<br>

The present invention relates to a control system for uniform transverse temperature distribution across a sinter plant to improve sinter quality and thereby improving productivity. The said control system, according to the present invention, for uniform transverse heat pattern in sinter plant to control the sinter bed height and consequently air filtration velocity across the pallet width thereby attaining uniform transverse temperature pattern, the said control system comprising: a plurality of level of automation (6, 7, 8) to automate the sintering process<br>
facilitating in monitoring of width-wise temperature profile of sinter bed in sinter<br>
machine before discharging; a communication driver in a PLC platform; three different sector gates controlled by the said PLC having a predetermined<br>
bed height across pallet width, the said bed height being differentially adjusted<br>
to achieve uniform transverse temperature profile whereby position of the said<br>
three  sector  gates  being  varied  by  means  of three  electro-mechanical<br>
actuators; operator's friendly HMI to facilitate the users with graphics, trends, reports and<br>
controlling parameters of the said sinter plant, the progress of sintering, BTP<br>
and machine speed being effectively analysed by the said HMI; a plurality of object oriented logic-based rules for the said HMI to calculate a<br>
desired sector gate opening / closing value position so as to attain uniform<br>
transverse heat pattern; a means for bi-directional data communication (4) between the said PLC and the<br>
said object oriented logic; a plurality of particular OPC-based (Object Linking &amp; Embedding for Process<br>
Control) client logic-based rules for bi-directional data communication between<br>
the said PLC and the said logic rules; and a plurality of K-type thermocouples (1) installed with tip exactly at the centre of<br>
each of the three zones of the transverse cross sectional area of pallet in order<br>
to monitor temperature across pallet, the mid point temperature of every zone<br>
being an indicative of average temperature of respective zone measured for the<br>
last three wind-boxes to monitor width-wise temperature variation as well as<br>
BTP detection; a means for temperature transmission (2) in communication with the said plurality<br>
of K-type thermocouples (1) incorporated into existing control circuitry in<br>
communication with the said logic-based rules.<br></td>
