POWER GRID LOAD MANAGEMENT FOR PLUG-IN VEHICLES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The subject matter described herein generally relates to charging<br>
systems and methodologies for plug-in electric and hybrid electric vehicles.<br>
More particularly, the subject matter described herein relates to a system and<br>
related methods for centralized management and controlling of the charging of<br>
an onboard energy storage system of plug-in vehicles.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] Hybrid electric and other fuel efficient vehicles are becoming<br>
increasingly popular. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in fully<br>
electric vehicles represent another category of vehicle that has less<br>
dependency on petroleum-based fuel. These vehicles are known as plug-in<br>
hybrid vehicles because their onboard energy storage systems (e.g., battery<br>
packs) are recharged by connecting (plugging in) the vehicle to an outlet, a<br>
charger or other voltage source, as well as from regenerative capture. In<br>
contrast to the conventional hybrid electric vehicles currently on the market, a<br>
plug-in hybrid vehicle can utilize its onboard energy storage system as the<br>
primary propulsion system for an extended range (up to 50 miles in some<br>
cases). After the onboard energy storage system has been depleted of its<br>
usable energy, an internal combustion engine (ICE) and/or a fuel cell in the<br>
plug-in hybrid vehicle is used as the primary propulsion system. Another type<br>
of plug-in hybrid vehicle (i.e., range extended electric vehicle) uses electricity<br>
as its sole propulsion system - an ICE or a fuel cell is used to recharge the<br>
onboard energy storage system as needed during operation. Although<br>
regenerative braking can be used to partially recharge the onboard energy<br>
storage system in these plug-in hybrid vehicles, recharging is typically<br>
performed by a charger that is connected to the local power grid architecture.<br><br>
[0003] The number of plug-in vehicles currently in operation is rather low.<br>
However, it is reasonable to forecast that the number of plug-in vehicles on the<br>
road will steadily increase over time. Indeed, it is likely that in the future a<br>
large number of plug-in vehicles will need to be recharged at the same time or<br>
during the same extended period of time (e.g., overnight or during working<br>
hours). This will create high demands on power grid architectures, which<br>
deliver power across cities, counties, states, and countries. For example,<br>
overloading of a power grid architecture may occur when a large number of<br>
plug-in vehicles are concurrently plugged in for purposes of recharging. In<br>
practice, a power grid architecture cannot be expected to handle full power<br>
demand at all electrical outlets at any given time. Accordingly, when charging<br>
plug-in vehicles, it cannot be assumed that power from the respective power<br>
grid architecture will always be available (due to high power demands during<br>
certain hours of the day, the dependency on variable power sources such as<br>
wind generated energy and solar energy, and other practical factors).<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY<br>
[0004] A method of controlling the charging of an onboard energy storage<br>
system of a plug-in vehicle is provided. The method involves: transmitting a<br>
charge request for the onboard energy storage system to a remote command<br>
center associated with the plug-in vehicle; receiving a charge command from<br>
the remote command center in response to the charge request; and regulating<br>
charging of the onboard energy storage system in accordance with the charge<br>
command.<br>
[0005] Another method of controlling the charging of an onboard energy<br>
storage system of a plug-in vehicle is provided. This method involves:<br>
receiving, from the plug-in vehicle, a charge request for the onboard energy<br>
storage system; obtaining vehicle location data that indicates a location of the<br>
plug-in vehicle; determining, from the charge request and the vehicle location<br>
data, whether to charge the onboard energy storage system; and in response to<br>
the determining step, transmitting a charge command to the plug-in vehicle,<br><br>
the charge command comprising data that regulates charging of the onboard<br>
energy storage system.<br>
[0006] A system for controlling the charging of onboard energy storage<br>
systems of plug-in vehicles is also provided, where each of the plug-in<br>
vehicles comprises a charge control module for its onboard energy storage<br>
system. An embodiment of the system includes: a remote command center<br>
configured to support data communication with the plug-in vehicles; a power<br>
grid architecture for delivery of electrical energy; and chargers coupled to the<br>
power grid architecture, the chargers being configured to provide charging<br>
energy from the power grid architecture to the onboard energy storage systems<br>
of the plug-in vehicles. In this embodiment the remote command center is<br>
configured to remotely regulate charging of the onboard energy storage<br>
systems of the plug-in vehicles using charge commands transmitted from the<br>
remote command center to the plug-in vehicles.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0013] The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or<br>
implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief<br>
summary or the following detailed description.<br>
[0014] Techniques and technologies may be described herein in terms of<br>
functional and/or logical block components and various processing steps. It<br>
should be appreciated that such block components may be realized by any<br>
number of hardware, software, and/or firmware components configured to<br>
perform the specified functions. For example, an embodiment of a system or a<br>
component may employ various integrated circuit components, e.g., memory<br>
elements, digital signal processing elements, logic elements, look-up tables, or<br>
the like, which may carry out a variety of functions under the control of one or<br>
more microprocessors or other control devices. In addition, those skilled in<br>
the art will appreciate that embodiments may be practiced in conjunction with<br>
any number of data transmission protocols and that the system described<br>
herein is merely one suitable example.<br>
[0015] For the sake of brevity, conventional techniques related to signal<br>
processing, data transmission, electric power systems, power grid management<br>
and control, vehicle telematics systems and services, and other functional<br>
aspects of the systems (and the individual operating components of the<br>
systems) may not be described in detail herein. Furthermore, the connecting<br>
lines shown in the various figures contained herein are intended to represent<br>
example functional relationships and/or physical couplings between the<br>
various elements. It should be noted that many alternative or additional<br>
functional relationships or physical connections may be present in an<br>
embodiment of the subject matter.<br><br>
[0016] The following description may refer to elements or nodes or<br>
features being "connected" or "coupled" together. As used herein, unless<br>
expressly stated otherwise, "connected" means that one element/node/feature<br>
is directly joined to (or directly communicates with) another<br>
element/node/feature, and not necessarily mechanically. Likewise, unless<br>
expressly stated otherwise, "coupled" means that one element/node/feature is<br>
directly or indirectly joined to (or directly or indirectly communicates with)<br>
another element/node/feature, and not necessarily mechanically.<br>
[0017] System and method embodiments are described below with<br>
reference to a practical deployment of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. It<br>
should be appreciated that the system and method embodiments can be<br>
equivalently practiced in the context of a fully electric vehicle, and the scope<br>
and application of the techniques and technologies described herein are not<br>
limited to any particular vehicle type or configuration.<br>
[0018] A plug-in hybrid vehicle utilizes a charger to recharge its onboard<br>
energy storage system (e.g., battery pack). In practice, the charger is a<br>
relatively high power unit that provides power in the kilowatt range. For<br>
example, a plug-in hybrid vehicle may utilize a relatively low power onboard<br>
charger (1.5 kilowatts) or a relatively high power onboard or external charger<br>
(6.6 kilowatts). An external charger may be deployed as a standalone<br>
component that is plugged into a standard AC outlet (e.g., a 110 volt outlet or<br>
a 220 volt outlet). The techniques and technologies described here are<br>
compatible for use with plug-in vehicles that use onboard and/or external<br>
chargers.<br>
[0019] The system described here leverages a vehicle telematics system<br>
such as the ONSTAR® communication system. As used herein, a vehicle<br>
telematics system is a system that combines telecommunications with<br>
informatics (informatics being the science, practice, and engineering of<br>
information systems). In practice, a vehicle telematics system might leverage<br>
a cellular system. Similarly, modern cell phones use cellular service to obtain<br>
GPS and other information. This GPS feature allows utility companies to<br><br>
locate where vehicles are actually charging their vehicle and obtain charge<br>
command information needed for load leveling of the utility grid. Conversely,<br>
the cellular GPS feature can help the user find where to charge the vehicle.<br>
Both the ONSTAR® communication system and cell phones or cellular based<br>
technologies can be used to deploy the embodiments described herein.<br>
[0020] Telematics systems support data communication (usually wireless)<br>
between one or more onboard vehicle systems and a remote command center,<br>
entity, network, or computing architecture. Telematics systems typically<br>
support bidirectional data transfer such that the remote command center can<br>
provide services to the user of the vehicle, upgrade software-based vehicle<br>
components, receive diagnostic vehicle data for storage and/or processing,<br>
receive emergency calls from a user of the vehicle, etc. Telematics systems<br>
are capable of tracking the current locations of compatible vehicles using<br>
satellite-based global positioning system (GPS) technology. Telematics<br>
systems are well known to those familiar with the automotive industry, and as<br>
such they will not be described in detail here.<br>
[0021] The system described here links a telematics system with an<br>
onboard electrical energy storage system of a plug-in vehicle. More<br>
specifically, the system allows the telematics system to communicate with the<br>
onboard charge control module and processing logic that regulates the<br>
charging of the onboard energy storage system of the vehicle. Information<br>
from the charge control module, such as the state of charge (SOC) and/or state<br>
of health (SOH) of a battery cell or a battery pack, can be sent to the onboard<br>
telematics system module using the onboard data communication bus or<br>
architecture. The onboard telematics system module can then send the<br>
SOC/SOH data, GPS-based vehicle location data, and other data to a remote<br>
command center (which may be maintained by the telematics system provider<br>
and/or another entity such as a utility company).<br>
[0022] In an embodiment where the remote command center is associated<br>
with the telematics system provider, the remote command center can relay the<br>
SOC/SOH data and the vehicle location data to one or more power utility<br><br>
companies, which then utilize this information to control, manage, and<br>
regulate the charging of vehicles and, if needed, determine how to best<br>
allocate power across one or more power grid architectures according to<br>
current power consumption demands. Notably, such power grid load<br>
balancing can be accomplished wirelessly from the plug-in vehicles to the<br>
utility companies. The data communication between a vehicle and its host<br>
telematics system, and between that telematics system and the utility<br>
companies, may be performed in accordance with one or more wireless data<br>
communication protocols, such as, without limitation: cellular; satellite;<br>
BLUETOOTH® wireless data communication; or IEEE 802.11 (any<br>
applicable variant).<br>
[0023] The use of a data communication link between plug-in vehicles and<br>
utility companies (via a telematics system) enables the utility companies to<br>
remotely regulate and control the duration of charging periods, when charging<br>
occurs, and/or charging power levels. In addition, the system described here<br>
allows the utility companies to better perform load leveling and power<br>
distribution, which can be important when weather dependent power sources<br>
(solar or wind) are used for the power grid. The system will also enable the<br>
utility companies to perform load balancing and power distribution when<br>
needed based upon plug-in vehicle charging demand, geographic location,<br>
time, and possibly other factors. One important benefit relates to power grid<br>
stabilization during peak use hours. The system allows the utility companies<br>
to bring load on-line or shed load very quickly as needed. This ability is an<br>
enabler to allow higher percentages of renewable power sources (e.g., wind or<br>
solar), which have power generating characteristics that can change in a matter<br>
of minutes.<br>
[0024] FIG. 1 is a simplified schematic diagram of an embodiment of a<br>
system 100 for controlling the charging of onboard energy storage systems of<br>
plug-in vehicles 102. FIG. 1 represents a geographical area supported by a<br>
power grid architecture 104 that is configured and designed for the delivery of<br>
electrical energy, where the geographical area can be of any practical size.<br><br>
For this example, the illustrated geographical area includes a plurality of cities<br>
106 (labeled City A, City B, and City C for convenience).<br>
[0025] Power grid architecture 104 represents the systems, infrastructure,<br>
power lines, transformers, power distribution equipment, control systems, and<br>
other components that are utilized to provide power to cities 106. In this<br>
regard, power grid architecture 104 obtains energy from one or more power<br>
sources 108. Power sources 108 may include any number of different energy<br>
generation sources, including, without limitation: nuclear sources; fossil fuel<br>
sources; wind power generators; hydroelectric; or solar power generators.<br>
Using well known techniques and technologies, power grid architecture 104<br>
processes and distributes power from power sources 108 as needed throughout<br>
cities 106. In practice, power grid architecture 104 may include a number of<br>
distributed power sources 108, which may be deployed locally within cities<br>
106. In practice, power grid architecture 104 may be managed by one or more<br>
power utility companies. For simplicity, this example assumes that power grid<br>
architecture 104 is supported and managed by one utility company, which<br>
maintains at least one power utilities control center 110 for power grid<br>
architecture 104. In practice, power utilities control center 110 may be<br>
included within power grid architecture 104 itself.<br>
[0026] Power utilities control center 110 is suitably configured to manage,<br>
regulate, and otherwise control the operation of power grid architecture 104.<br>
For example, power utilities control center 110 can control the distribution of<br>
power throughout power grid architecture 104, perform power load balancing<br>
throughout power grid architecture 104, carry out rolling controlled blackouts<br>
within power grid architecture 104, and support any number of known and<br>
conventional power management and control operations. In addition, power<br>
utilities control center 110 may manage the importation or exportation of<br>
power to other power grid architectures in different geographical locations.<br>
As described in more detail below, this embodiment of power utilities control<br>
center 110 is coupled to a remote command center 112 to facilitate data<br>
communication that supports plug-in vehicle charging techniques. Remote<br><br>
command center 112 generally represents the systems, infrastructure,<br>
processing capabilities, and architecture associated with a telematics system<br>
that supports data communication with vehicles, including plug-in vehicles<br>
102. In FIG. 1, the link 114 represents one or more wireless and/or wired data<br>
communication links between remote command center 112 and power utilities<br>
control center 110. Link 114 facilitates data communication in accordance<br>
with any number of known wired and/or wireless data communication<br>
protocols. In FIG. 1, the link 116 represents one or more wireless and/or<br>
wired data communication links between remote command center 112 and at<br>
least one data communication network 118. Link 116 facilitates data<br>
communication in accordance with any number of known wired and/or<br>
wireless data communication protocols.<br>
[0027] In FIG. 1, data communication network(s) 118 generally represents<br>
the systems, infrastructure, processing capabilities, data transmission lines,<br>
wireless data communication channels, and architecture that supports the<br>
processing, routing, transmission, and/or transport of data between remote<br>
command center 112 and plug-in vehicles 102. Data communication<br>
network(s) 118 may be compatible with any number of known network types,<br>
techniques, technologies, and protocols (wired or wireless). Wireless data<br>
communication protocols, techniques, or methodologies supported by data<br>
communication network(s) 118, include, without limitation: RF; IrDA<br>
(infrared); BLUETOOTH®; ZigBee (and other variants of the IEEE 802.15<br>
protocol); IEEE 802.11 (any variation); IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX or any other<br>
variation); Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum; Frequency Hopping Spread<br>
Spectrum; cellular/wireless/cordless telecommunication protocols; wireless<br>
home network communication protocols; paging network protocols; magnetic<br>
induction; satellite data communication protocols; wireless hospital or health<br>
care facility network protocols such as those operating in the WMTS bands;<br>
GPRS; and proprietary wireless data communication protocols such as<br>
variants of Wireless USB. Wired data communication protocols, techniques,<br>
or methodologies supported by data communication network(s) 118 include,<br><br>
without limitation: Ethernet; home network communication protocols; USB;<br>
IEEE 1394 (Firewire); hospital network communication protocols; and<br>
proprietary data communication protocols.<br>
[0028] Data communication network(s) 118 communicate with plug-in<br>
vehicles 102 via respective data communication links 120. Although shown as<br>
wireless links, data communication links 120 need not be wireless. Certain<br>
embodiments of plug-in vehicles 102 may be suitably configured to support<br>
wired data communication with data communication network(s) 118 (using,<br>
for example, a USB cable connected to a computer). For this embodiment,<br>
data communication links 120 represent cellular network links - current<br>
implementations of telematics systems leverage the existing cellular network<br>
service.<br>
[0029] System 100 also cooperates with GPS satellites (not shown) that<br>
provide raw location data to onboard GPS systems located in plug-in vehicles<br>
102. The onboard GPS systems can process the raw location data for use with<br>
an onboard navigation system. In addition, the onboard GPS systems provide<br>
the raw location data (and/or processed vehicle location data derived from the<br>
raw location data) to remote command center 112 via data communication<br>
network(s) 118. Remote command center 112 utilizes the vehicle location<br>
data to support the plug-in vehicle charging techniques described in more<br>
detail below.<br>
[0030] System 100 may include any number of chargers 122, which are<br>
coupled to power grid architecture 104. Although depicted as distinct<br>
components, a charger 122 may instead be integrated into a plug-in vehicle<br>
102, or integrated into another structure such as a building or a vehicle<br>
charging station. Chargers 122 are suitably configured to provide charging<br>
energy from power grid architecture 104 to the onboard energy storage<br>
systems of plug-in vehicles 102. Notably, remote command center 112 is<br>
configured to remotely regulate charging of the onboard storage systems of<br>
plug-in vehicles 102 by chargers 122.<br><br>
[0031] As described in more detail below, remote command center 112<br>
transmits charge commands (via data communication network(s) 118) to plug-<br>
in vehicles 102, where the charge commands control whether or not plug-in<br>
vehicles 102 will be able to utilize the power provided by power grid<br>
architecture 104. For example, remote command center 112 can transmit<br>
charge enable commands for processing by the charge control modules of<br>
plug-in vehicles 102, where the charge enable commands activate a charging<br>
state of the onboard energy storage systems. On the other hand, remote<br>
command center 112 can transmit charge disable commands for processing by<br>
the charge control modules of plug-in vehicles 102, where the charge disable<br>
commands activate a non-charging state of the onboard energy storage<br>
systems. Therefore, assuming that plug-in vehicles 102 are configured to<br>
charge only in response to received charge enable commands, remote<br>
command center 112 can remotely control when any given plug-in vehicle 102<br>
is charged. In this manner, remote command center 112 can generate a<br>
charging schedule for plug-in vehicles 102 coupled to power grid architecture<br>
104, where the charging schedule is influenced by the current and/or the<br>
forecasted power load conditions for power grid architecture 104.<br>
[0032] FIG. 2 is a simplified schematic representation of an embodiment<br>
of a plug-in vehicle 200 that is suitable for use in system 100. Indeed, each<br>
plug-in vehicle 102 may include the components depicted in FIG. 2. Plug-in<br>
vehicle 200 is a hybrid electric vehicle; however, the charging techniques and<br>
concepts described here are also applicable to a pure electric plug-in vehicle or<br>
a range extended electric vehicle. The illustrated embodiment of plug-in<br>
vehicle 200 includes, without limitation: an onboard energy storage system<br>
202; a charge control module 204 coupled to onboard energy storage system<br>
202; a propulsion system 206; wheels 208; a fuel supply 210 for propulsion<br>
system 206; an electric propulsion system 212 coupled to onboard energy<br>
storage system 202; an onboard telematics system 214 coupled to charge<br>
control module 204; and an onboard GPS system 216 coupled to onboard<br>
telematics system 214. Electronic devices, electronic control modules, and<br><br>
processing components of plug-in vehicle 200 may be coupled together using<br>
a data communication bus, conductive elements, and/or any suitably<br>
configured interconnection architecture. FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram that<br>
depicts various electrical and mechanical connections and couplings in a very<br>
simplified manner for ease of description. An embodiment of plug-in vehicle<br>
102 will of course utilize additional physical components and devices that are<br>
well known in the automotive industry.<br>
[0033] Onboard energy storage system 202 may be realized as a<br>
rechargeable battery pack having a single battery module or a plurality of<br>
individual battery modules. In this regard, onboard energy storage system 202<br>
may utilize lithium-ion batteries, nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries, lead<br>
acid batteries, or lithium polymer batteries connected to produce the desired<br>
operating voltage. Plug-in vehicle 200 may include an energy management<br>
controller (not shown), which obtains, derives, monitors, and/or processes a<br>
set of parameters associated with onboard energy storage system 202. These<br>
parameters may include, without limitation: current; voltage; SOC; SOH;<br>
battery internal resistances; battery internal reactances; and power output. In<br>
some embodiments, the energy management controller may be incorporated<br>
into charge control module 204. The parameters obtained by the energy<br>
management controller can be utilized by the charging system to determine<br>
whether onboard energy storage system 202 needs to be charged and, if so, to<br>
what extent.<br>
[0034] Onboard energy storage system 202 provides electrical energy that<br>
enables electric propulsion system 212 to provide traction power to wheels<br>
208. Certain embodiments of plug-in vehicle 200 employ a motor generator<br>
(MoGen), which is dynamically coupled to propulsion system 206 (e.g., an<br>
internal combustion engine (ICE) or a fuel cell (FC) propulsion system). This<br>
MoGen functions as either a motor to propel plug-in vehicle 200 or a<br>
generator to charge onboard energy storage system 202, depending on the<br>
operating state of plug-in vehicle 200 (i.e., braking, accelerating, or operating<br>
at a constant speed on a highway). The MoGen is preferably an AC induction<br><br>
machine, but it may comprise any known electrical motor/generator<br>
technology including but not limited to DC machines, synchronous machines,<br>
and switched reluctance machines. In practice, plug-in vehicle 200 may have<br>
two MoGens: one utilized to drive the rear wheels; and another utilized to<br>
drive the front wheels.<br>
[0035] The MoGens can be controlled by a suitably configured electrical<br>
control system, DC-DC converters, power inverter modules (PIMs), and the<br>
like. A control module in plug-in vehicle 200, including charge control<br>
module 204, may comprise any type of processing element or vehicle<br>
controller known in the art, and it can be equipped with nonvolatile memory,<br>
random access memory (RAM), discrete and analog input/output (I/O), a<br>
central processing unit, and/or communications interfaces for networking<br>
within an automotive communications network. In this regard, charge control<br>
module 204 (and possibly other illustrative blocks, modules, processing logic,<br>
and circuits described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein)<br>
may be implemented or performed with a general purpose processor, a content<br>
addressable memory, a digital signal processor, an application specific<br>
integrated circuit, a field programmable gate array, any suitable programmable<br>
logic device, discrete gate or transistor logic, discrete hardware components,<br>
or any combination thereof, designed to perform the functions described<br>
herein. A processor may be realized as a microprocessor, a controller, a<br>
microcontroller, or a state machine. A processor may also be implemented as<br>
a combination of computing devices, e.g., a combination of a digital signal<br>
processor and a microprocessor, a plurality of microprocessors, one or more<br>
microprocessors in conjunction with a digital signal processor core, or any<br>
other such configuration.<br>
[0036] Moreover, the steps of a method or algorithm described in<br>
connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be embodied directly<br>
in hardware, in firmware, in a software module executed by a processor, or in<br>
any practical combination thereof. A software module may reside in RAM<br>
memory, flash memory, ROM memory, EPROM memory, EEPROM<br><br>
memory, registers, a hard disk, a removable disk, a CD-ROM, or any other<br>
form of storage medium known in the art. In this regard, an exemplary storage<br>
medium can be coupled to a processor such that the processor can read<br>
information from, and write information to, the storage medium. In the<br>
alternative, the storage medium may be integral to the processor. As an<br>
example, the processor and the storage medium may reside in an ASIC.<br>
[0037] The subject matter and certain aspects of the embodiments thereof<br>
may be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions,<br>
such as program modules, executed by one or more computing modules,<br>
controllers, or other devices. Generally, program modules include routines,<br>
programs, objects, components, data structures, and/or other elements that<br>
perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types.<br>
Typically, the functionality of the program modules may be combined or<br>
distributed as desired in various embodiments. A computing device that<br>
performs computer-executable instructions typically includes at least some<br>
form of computer readable media. Computer readable media can be any<br>
available media that can be accessed by a computing device and/or by<br>
applications executed by a computing device.<br>
[0038] Referring again to FIG. 2, in the generator mode, the MoGens<br>
generate electrical energy that is transferred, via the PIMs, to onboard energy<br>
storage system 202 and the DC-DC converters. The direction of current flow<br>
for the MoGens is determined according to the particular operating state of<br>
plug-in vehicle 200. The DC-DC converters provide and regulate a DC bus<br>
that is pulse-width-modulated by the PIMs to supply time varying current to<br>
the MoGens. In a regenerative state (such as during braking) or charging<br>
condition, current will flow from the MoGens, via the PIMs, to charge<br>
onboard energy storage system 202 and provide current to the DC-DC<br>
converters. In a state where the MoGens are needed to provide propulsion,<br>
current will flow from onboard energy storage system 202 to the MoGens, via<br>
the DC-DC converters and PIMs, to power the MoGens.<br><br>
[0039] For the embodiments described here, the SOC and/or the SOH of<br>
onboard energy storage system 202 is dynamically tracked to determine when<br>
to charge onboard energy storage system 202. In certain embodiments, the<br>
SOC is controlled to be within the range of 20% to 80% so that the charge<br>
acceptance and efficiency during regenerative braking can be realized.<br>
However, controlling onboard energy storage system 202 to any SOC<br>
percentage is within the scope of the embodiments described herein. Plug-in<br>
vehicle 200 may employ any appropriate technique to obtain the SOC and/or<br>
SOH of onboard energy storage system 202. For example, such techniques are<br>
disclosed in United States patent number 6,639,385 and in United States<br>
patent application publication number 2004/0162683A1 - the relevant content<br>
of these patent documents is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0040] For embodiments where propulsion system 206 is an ICE, fuel<br>
supply 210 can be a supply of gasoline, alcohol, ethanol, diesel fuel, or the<br>
like. For embodiments where propulsion system 206 is a fuel cell, fuel supply<br>
210 can be a supply of hydrogen, an alcohol, a hydrocarbon, or the like. The<br>
specific type of fuel in fuel supply 210 and the particular configuration and<br>
operation of propulsion system 206 are unimportant for purposes of the<br>
charging system and methodologies described here and, therefore, will not be<br>
described in detail.<br>
[0041] Onboard telematics system 214 is suitably configured to facilitate<br>
data communication with a host remote command center (e.g., remote<br>
command center 112 depicted in FIG. 1). Onboard telematics system 214 can<br>
communicate with the remote command center using a wireless data<br>
communication link 218 as shown and/or a wired link. Onboard GPS system<br>
216 is suitably configured to obtain GPS data from a GPS satellite system.<br>
For this embodiment, onboard GPS system 216 processes the received GPS<br>
data as needed, and provides vehicle location data to onboard telematics<br>
system 214. In turn, onboard telematics system 214 can send the vehicle<br>
location data to the remote command center.<br><br>
[0042] Components of plug-in vehicle 200 cooperate to support the<br>
charging techniques and methodologies described herein. In this regard, FIG.<br>
3 is a flow chart that depicts an embodiment of a plug-in vehicle charging<br>
process 300, which may be performed by plug-in vehicles 102/200, and FIG. 4<br>
is a flow chart that depicts an embodiment of a plug-in vehicle charging<br>
control process 400, which may be performed by remote command center 112<br>
and/or power utilities control center 110. The various tasks performed in<br>
connection with these processes may be performed by software, hardware,<br>
firmware, or any combination thereof. For illustrative purposes, the following<br>
description of these processes may refer to elements mentioned above in<br>
connection with FIG. 1 or FIG. 2. In practice, portions of these processes may<br>
be performed by different elements of the described system. It should be<br>
appreciated that a given process may include any number of additional or<br>
alternative tasks, the tasks shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 need not be performed<br>
in the illustrated order, and a given process may be incorporated into a more<br>
comprehensive procedure or process having additional functionality not<br>
described in detail herein.<br>
[0043] As described above, the onboard telematics system of the plug-in<br>
vehicle will receive or generate vehicle location data that indicates the location<br>
of the plug-in vehicle. In preferred embodiments, the vehicle location data<br>
represents the current position of the plug-in vehicle as derived from GPS<br>
data. Process 300 provides the vehicle location data to the remote command<br>
center (task 302) or otherwise makes the vehicle location data accessible by<br>
the remote command center. From the perspective of the remote command<br>
center, process 400 obtains or receives the vehicle location data (task 402)<br>
from the plug-in vehicle. Notably, this exchange may occur at any time, and it<br>
need not be triggered by the user or the plug-in vehicle requesting a charge.<br>
[0044] The following description of process 300 and process 400 assumes<br>
that the plug-in vehicle has been connected to a compatible charger (i.e.,<br>
plugged in) and that the user desires to charge the onboard energy storage<br>
system of the plug-in vehicle. For this embodiment, process 300 initiates the<br><br>
charging procedure by transmitting a charge request (task 304) for the onboard<br>
energy storage system. The charge request is transmitted to an appropriate<br>
remote command center that is associated with the plug-in vehicle (for<br>
example, one to which the plug-in vehicle has subscribed). From the<br>
perspective of the remote command center, process 400 receives and processes<br>
the charge request (task 404). The charge request may be conveyed during a<br>
cellular network call established between the onboard telematics system and<br>
the remote command center. The charge request can convey data indicative of<br>
various information. For example, the charge request may convey any of the<br>
following items, without limitation: an identifier of the plug-in vehicle; the<br>
name of the driver or owner; the vehicle location data; SOC data that indicates<br>
the SOC of the onboard energy storage system; SOH data that indicates the<br>
SOH of the onboard energy storage system; the time; an anticipated window<br>
of time during which the plug-in vehicle will remain plugged in; priority data<br>
that indicates a relative charging priority for the plug-in vehicle (e.g., "charge<br>
immediately," or "charge within the next 60 minutes," or "charge whenever<br>
possible"); or the charge capability indicating the amount of energy the system<br>
can accept and/or the rate at which it can be charged.<br>
[0045] The remote command center can process the received charge<br>
request and any relevant data associated therewith to determine whether to<br>
charge the onboard energy storage system of the plug-in vehicle. In practice,<br>
this determination is influenced by a number of factors and considerations, and<br>
the remote command center may utilize an appropriate software application<br>
that analyzes and processes the available data to arrive at a decision. An<br>
important influencing factor relates to the current power load conditions for<br>
the power grid architecture to which the plug-in vehicle is connected. In this<br>
regard, the remote command center can identify the particular power grid<br>
architecture corresponding to the vehicle location data (task 406) and analyze<br>
power load conditions for the identified power grid architecture (task 408). In<br>
practice, the vehicle location data should be accurate enough to enable the<br>
remote command center and/or the corresponding power utilities control<br><br>
center to unambiguously determine which power grid architecture (or a sub-<br>
grid thereof) provides power to the charger servicing the plug-in vehicle. The<br>
load balancing analysis can consider the current loading on the identified<br>
power grid architecture and/or other power grid architectures as needed such<br>
that the governing utility company can regulate, divert, and allocate power<br>
throughout its territory in an effective and intelligent manner. For example, if<br>
the power grid architecture (or sub-grid) to which the plug-in vehicle is<br>
connected is overloaded or is approaching an overloaded condition, then the<br>
remote command center may determine that the plug-in vehicle should not be<br>
immediately charged. On the other hand, if the power grid architecture (or<br>
sub-grid) to which the plug-in vehicle is connected is only lightly loaded, then<br>
the remote command center may determine that the plug-in vehicle can be<br>
charged at any time and for a relatively long period of time.<br>
[0046] Another influencing factor is the priority data received from the<br>
plug-in vehicle. The priority data can be automatically generated by an<br>
onboard subsystem or it can be entered/selected by the operator of the plug-in<br>
vehicle using an appropriate user interface. The illustrated embodiment of<br>
process 400 analyzes the charging priority data (task 410) as an additional data<br>
point that influences the determination of whether or not to charge the plug-in<br>
vehicle. Thus, the remote command center can be configured to favor plug-in<br>
vehicles that send priority data that indicates an urgent charging need over<br>
plug-in vehicles that do not send any priority data, and over plug-in vehicles<br>
that send priority data that indicates a less urgent need to charge.<br>
[0047] The SOC or SOH may also influence the decision to enable<br>
charging or disable charging. For example, the remote command center can<br>
be configured to favor plug-in vehicles that send SOC/SOH data that indicates<br>
a relatively low charge condition of the onboard energy storage system, while<br>
disfavoring plug-in vehicles that send SOC/SOH data that indicates a<br>
relatively high charge condition of the onboard energy storage system.<br>
[0048] The status of the power grid, loading conditions of the power grid,<br>
and/or other characteristics of the power grid architecture may influence<br><br>
vehicle charging. For example, in the event of a power shortage or sudden<br>
change in the available power, the remote command center can disable<br>
charging, thus shedding load on the power system architecture.<br>
[0049] Depending upon the system deployment, the remote command<br>
center can determine whether to charge the onboard energy storage system:<br>
(1) independently (i.e., based upon data obtained from the vehicle and data<br>
obtained from the power utilities control center); (2) as instructed by the<br>
power utilities control center (i.e., the remote command center may<br>
communicate with the power utilities control center and function as an<br>
intermediary for the vehicle); or (3) based upon recommendations provided by<br>
the utilities control center. This determination will influence the type of<br>
charge command transmitted to the plug-in vehicle, where a charge command<br>
includes data, instructions, or control parameters that regulates charging of the<br>
onboard energy storage system of the vehicle. In this regard, if process 400<br>
determines to charge the plug-in vehicle (query task 412), then the remote<br>
command center will generate and transmit a charge enable command to the<br>
telematics system of the plug-in vehicle (task 414). On the other hand, if<br>
process 400 determines to not charge the plug-in vehicle, then the remote<br>
command center will generate and transmit a charge disable command to the<br>
telematics system of the plug-in vehicle (task 424).<br>
[0050] From the perspective of the plug-in vehicle, process 300 receives a<br>
charge command (task 306) from the remote command center, where this<br>
charge command is received in response to the charge request transmitted<br>
during task 304. Thereafter, process 300 regulates charging of the onboard<br>
energy storage system in accordance with the received charge command<br>
(which may be a charge enable command or a charge disable command). If<br>
process 300 receives a charge enable command (query task 308), then process<br>
300 will activate a charging state for the plug-in vehicle and begin charging<br>
the onboard energy storage subsystem (task 310). If not, then the received<br>
charge command is a charge disable command, and process 300 leads to task<br>
318. This technique allows the remote command center to remotely control<br><br>
whether or not the plug-in vehicle can charge from the charger to which it is<br>
connected. For this embodiment, the plug-in vehicle continues to charge<br>
unless it receives a subsequent charge disable command; it becomes fully<br>
charged, or it is disconnected from the charger.<br>
[0051] If the plug-in vehicle receives a charge disable command after<br>
receiving the initial charge enable command (query task 312), then process<br>
300 leads to task 318. If not, then process 300 leads to query task 314. If<br>
query task 314 determines that the onboard energy storage system has been<br>
fully charged or if the plug-in vehicle has been disconnected from its charging<br>
power source, then process 300 transmits a suitably formatted charge<br>
termination notification to the remote command center (task 316). If not, then<br>
process 300 may be re-entered at query task 312 to repeat the processing loop<br>
represented by query task 312 and query task 314. The charge termination<br>
notification informs the remote command center of the fully charged state or<br>
of the disconnected state of the plug-in vehicle. This charge termination<br>
notification can be used by the remote command center as a prompt to update<br>
records for the plug-in vehicle, to initiate the generation and transmission of a<br>
final charge disable command, or the like. In certain embodiments, in<br>
conjunction with the transmission of this charge termination notification the<br>
plug-in vehicle automatically generates an internal charge disable command or<br>
otherwise switches out the onboard energy storage system from the charger to<br>
prevent overcharging. This functionality could be implemented by on onboard<br>
charge controller that is suitably designed to prevent overcharging of the<br>
battery by monitoring battery voltage and temperature.<br>
[0052] As briefly mentioned above, task 318 is performed when the initial<br>
charge command is a charge disable command (query task 308) or when a<br>
subsequent charge disable command is received (query task 312). In<br>
connection with task 318, process 300 will activate a non-charging state for<br>
the plug-in vehicle and prevent or stop charging of the onboard energy storage<br>
subsystem. While in the non-charging state, the plug-in vehicle consumes<br>
little or no energy from the charger, even though it remains coupled to the<br><br>
power grid architecture. For this embodiment, the plug-in vehicle remains in<br>
its non-charging state unless it receives a subsequent charge enable command,<br>
it becomes fully charged, or it is disconnected from the charger.<br>
[0053] If the plug-in vehicle receives a charge enable command after<br>
receiving the initial charge disable command (query task 320), then process<br>
300 leads to task 310, which activates the charging state for the plug-in<br>
vehicle. If a subsequent charge enable command is not received, then process<br>
300 leads to query task 322. If query task 322 determines that the onboard<br>
energy storage system is fully charged or if the plug-in vehicle has been<br>
disconnected from its charging power source, then process 300 leads to task<br>
316 to transmit a charge termination notification as described previously. If<br>
not, then process 300 may be re-entered at query task 320 to repeat the<br>
processing loop represented by query task 320 and query task 322. Overall,<br>
process 300 provides for the remote management and regulation of charging<br>
of the plug-in vehicle.<br>
[0054] Referring again to FIG. 4, the remote command center generates<br>
and transmits a charge enable command to the plug-in vehicle during task 414.<br>
If process 400 receives a charge termination notification from the plug-in<br>
vehicle (query task 416), then process 400 ends. In practice, the remote<br>
command center may update its records for the plug-in vehicle in response to<br>
the charge termination notification. If a charge termination notification is not<br>
received, then process 400 may continue to analyze the power load conditions<br>
for the power grid architecture (task 418) and the charging priority data as<br>
originally received or as updated (task 420). This ongoing monitoring of the<br>
current power load conditions is desirable to enable the charging system to<br>
react in real time (or substantially real time) to changing conditions. If the<br>
current conditions indicate that charging can be sustained, then process 400<br>
can be re-entered at query task 416 to repeat the loop represented by tasks 416,<br>
418, 420, and 422. If the current conditions indicate that charging can no<br>
longer be sustained, then process 400 leads to task 424.<br><br>
[0055] As mentioned above, task 424 is performed when query task 412<br>
determines that charging should not be initiated, or when query task 422<br>
determines that charging cannot be continued. For task 424, the remote<br>
command center generates and transmits a charge disable command to the<br>
plug-in vehicle. If process 400 subsequently receives a charge termination<br>
notification from the plug-in vehicle (query task 426), then process 400 ends.<br>
If a charge termination notification is not received, then process 400 may<br>
continue to analyze the power load conditions for the power grid architecture<br>
(task 428) and the charging priority data as originally received or as updated<br>
(task 430). Again, this ongoing monitoring of the current power load<br>
conditions is desirable to enable the remote command center to remotely<br>
enable/disable charging of the plug-in vehicle in response to changing power<br>
load conditions. If the current conditions indicate that charging can now be<br>
sustained, then process 400 can be re-entered at task 414 to generate and<br>
transmit a charge enable command to the plug-in vehicle. If, however, the<br>
current conditions indicate that charging cannot be sustained, then process 400<br>
can be re-entered at query task 426 to repeat the loop represented by tasks 426,<br>
428, 430, and 432. Overall, process 400 enables the remote command center<br>
to enable, disable, and re-enable charging of the plug-in vehicle as necessary.<br>
[0056] In an alternate embodiment, the plug-in vehicle need not wait for<br>
an initial charge enable command to begin charging its onboard energy storage<br>
system. Instead, the plug-in vehicle can immediately begin charging after<br>
connection with a compatible charger and after sending its charge request<br>
message to the remote command center. In this embodiment, charging will<br>
continue until the plug-in vehicle receives a charge disable command from the<br>
remote command center. Of course, charging will be terminated when the<br>
onboard energy storage system is fully charged or if the plug-in vehicle is<br>
disconnected from the power grid architecture.<br>
[0057] The embodiment described above in connection with process 300<br>
and process 400 contemplates a charging state and a non-charging state. An<br>
alternate embodiment of the charging control system may be configured to<br><br>
also support one or more partial or reduced power charging states, where the<br>
onboard energy storage system is charged at a reduced rate relative to the<br>
normal charging state. Such intermediate charging states can be activated<br>
when the power utility company would like to manage energy consumption by<br>
plug-in vehicles while still providing some charging.<br>
[0058] The remote charging control system and methodologies described<br>
above can also be modified to give the power utilities companies more direct<br>
control over the charging cycles. In such a modified embodiment, the plug-in<br>
vehicle chargers are external to the vehicles, and the power utilities companies<br>
are given the ability (either directly or via the remote command center) to<br>
control whether or not power is available at the chargers. In other words, the<br>
decision and switching intelligence is implemented in the chargers rather than<br>
in the plug-in vehicles as described previously. To support this alternate<br>
system embodiment, each compatible charger is suitably configured with<br>
appropriate hardware, software, and/or firmware that enables it to<br>
communicate with the remote command center and/or the power utilities<br>
control center. Compatible chargers are also configured to respond to a<br>
received charge enable command or a received charge disable command in the<br>
manner described above in the context of onboard vehicle processing. In other<br>
words, these charge commands activate the charging and non-charging states,<br>
which are maintained by the chargers themselves. Of course, a practical<br>
embodiment may be suitably configured to support this modified charging<br>
methodology in addition to the charging methodology described in more detail<br>
above. For example, this additional feature is possible with off-board<br>
(external) chargers that would be in the range of 6.6 kW and higher. In<br>
contrast, an onboard 110 volt (1.5 kW) plug-in charger represents a<br>
completely self-contained charging system for the vehicle.<br>
[0059] The techniques and technologies described here enable power<br>
utility companies to monitor, regulate, and manage the charging of plug-in<br>
vehicles such that charging of a plurality of plug-in vehicles can be scheduled<br>
in an appropriate manner, for example, to suit the power load balancing needs<br><br>
of the power grid. The remote charge control system will help utility<br>
companies to best utilize grid infrastructure and assure that power is available<br>
throughout the grid when needed.<br>
