TRANSFORMATION SYSTEM IN THE FIELD OF FILAMENTOUS FUNGAL HOSTS<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The subject invention pertains to a novel transfonnation system in the field of filamentous fungal hosts for expressing and secreting heterologous proteins or polypeptides. The invention also covers a process for producing large amounts of polypeptide in an economical manner. The system comprises a transfonned or transfected fungal strain of the genus Chrysosporium^ more particularly of Chrysosporium Ivcknofwense and mutants or derivatives diereof. It also covers transformants containing Chrysosporium coding sequences. Novel mutant Chrysosporium strains are disclosed as are novel enzymes derived therefrom.<br>
Background to the invention.<br>
A number of hosts for gene expression and methods of transformation have heem disclosed in the prior art. Bacteria are often mentioned e.g. Escherichia coli, K coli is however a microorganism incapable of secretion of a number of proteins or polypeptides and as such is undesirable as host cell for production of protein or polypeptide at the industrial level. An additional disadvantage for £. co//, which is valid also for bacteria in general, is that prokaryotes cannot provide additional modifications required for numerous eukaryotic proteins or polypeptides to be produced in an active form. Glycosylation of proteins and proper folding of proteins are examples of processing required to ensure an active protein or polypeptide is produced. To ensure such processing one can sometimes use mammalian cells; however, the disadvantage of such cells is that they are often difficult to maintain and require expensive media. Such transformation systems are therefore not practical for production of proteins or polypeptides at the industrial level. They may be cost efficient for highly priced pharmaceutical compounds requiring relatively low amounts, but certainly not for industrial enzymes.<br>
A number of ftmgal expression systems have been developed e.g. Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus awamori, Aspergillus nidulcms, Trichoderma reesei. A number of others have been suggested but for various reasons have not found wide-spread acceptance or use. In general terms the ideal host must fulfil a large number of criteria:<br>
-	The ideal host must be readily fermented using inexpensive medium.<br>
-	The ideal host should use the medium efficiently.<br>
-	The ideal host must produce the polypeptide or protein in high yield, i.e. must exhibit high protein to biomass ratio.<br>
-	The ideal host should be capable of efficient secretion of the protein or polypeptide.<br>
-	The ideal host must enable ease of isolation and purification of the desired protein or polypeptide.<br>
-	The ideal host must process the desired protein or polypeptide such that it is produced in an active form not requiring additional activation or modification steps.<br><br>
but no report of expression of heterologous protein from such a strain has been provided.<br>
In 1997 a patent issued to Hawaii Biotechnology Group for transfonned Neurospora for<br>
expression of nianunalian peptide such as chymosin. The transfomudon of auxotn^c Neurospora<br>
crassa occurred with spheroplasts. Endogenous transcriptional reguhtfory regions w^re uitroduMd and<br>
cotransformation was carried out Nothing is mentioned concerning other hosts and other<br>
transformation protocols. Nothing is apparent from the disclosure concerning the degree of<br>
expression. It is doubtful whether the degree of expression is high, as immunotechniques (which are<br>
useful for detecting small amounts of protein) are die only techniques used to illustrate the presence of<br>
the protein. No actual isolation of the protein is disclosed	.<br>
WO 97/26330 of Novo Nordisk suggests a method of obtaining mutants of filamentous fungal parent cells having an improved property for production of heterologous polypq)tide. The method comprises first finding a specific altered morphology followed by assessing whether a transformant produces more heterologous polypeptide than the parent The method is illustrated only for strains of Fusarium A3/S and Aspergillus oryzae. The method is suggested to be applio^le for Aspergillus, Trichoderma, Thielavia, Fusarium, Neurospora, Acremonitun, Tolyplocadium, Humicola, Scyiaiidium, Afyceliophthora or Mucor. As stated above the unpredictability in the art and also the unpredictability of the methcKl of the cited application do not provide a goierally applicable teaching with a reasonable expectation of success.<br>
Detailed description of the invention.<br>
We now describe an alternative fim^l expression system with the simplicity of use of the above-mentioned Aspergilli and Trichoderma fulfilling the above requirements. The new system has not been taught or suggested in the prior art. The new system according to the invention provides the additional advant£^es that transformation rates are higher than those for the frequently used Trichoderma reesei system. In addition the culture conditions offer the additional bonus of being advantageous for the expressed polypeptide. Where reference is made in this specification and in the appending claims to "polypeptides" or "polypeptides of interest" as the products of the expression system of the invention, this term also comprise proteins, i.e polypeptides having a particular function and/or secondary and/or tertiary structure.<br>
The pH of the culture medium can be neutral or alkaline thus no longer subjecting the produced protein or polypeptide to aggressive and potentially inactivating acid pH. It is also possible to culture at acid pH such as pH 4 for cases where the protein or polypeptide is better suited to an acidic environment Suitably culture can occur at a pH between 4.0-10.0. A preference however exists for neutral to alkaline pH as the host strain exhibits better growth at such pH, e.g. between 6 and 9. Growth at alkaline temperature which can be from pH 8 up and can even be as hi^ as 10 is also a good alternative for some cases. Also the cultivation temperature of such host strains is advantageous<br><br>
to the stability of some types of produced polypeptide. The cultivation temperature is suitably at a temperature of 25-43^C A temperature in the range fix&gt;m 4(K; down to 23^ or 3(K^ is also advantageously q)plied. Clearly such conditions are of particular interest for production of mammalian polypeptides. The selected temperature will depend on cost effectiveness of the cultivation and sensitivity of the polypeptide or cultivation strain. The conditions will be determined by the skilled person without undue burden on a case-by-case basis, as is common in the art<br>
It has also been ascertained that the biomass to viscosity relation and tiie amount of protein produced is exceedingly favourable for die host according to die invention. Comparisons hkve been carried out with Trichoderma longibrqchiatum (formerly also known as Triciukkrma reeset) and with Aspergillus niger. Trichoderma longibrachiatum gave 2.5-5 g/I biomass, Aspergillus niger gave 5-10 g/1 biomass and the host according to the invention gave 0.5-1 g/I biomass under their respective optimised conditions. This thus offers 5-10 fold improvement over the commercially used strains. These commercial strains are strains which themselves are considered in the art to be high producers of proteins and they are successfully used for commercial protein production. They have been cultured under their optimal conditions developed and run viably in large-scale commercial fermenters. The same strains were used to illustrate enormous improvement in viscosity values for cultures of the host according to the invention. At the end of the fermentation process Trichoderma longibrachiatum gave a value of 200-600 cP (Centipoise), Aspergillus niger gave a value of 1500-2000 cP and the host according to the invention gave a value below 10 cP. This thus provides at least 20-200 fold improvement for viscosity values over the commercially used strains. A quite surprising further aspect was that the protein levels determined for the host cells according to the invention were much higher than for the commercial Aspergilli and Trichoderma reesei strains, even with the above mentioned surprisingly low biomass and viscosity levels. In summaiy an easy to use versatile improved transformation system and expression system with improved culturing conditions has hereby been introduced. Hie strains according to the invention produce surprisingly higher protein levels under these improve conditions and in addition they do such in a shorter fermenter time.<br>
The subject invention is directed at mutant Chiysosporium strains comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a heterologous protein or polypeptide, said nucleic acid sequence being operably linked to an expression regulating region and optionally a secretion signal encoding sequence and/or a carrier protein encoding sequence. Preferably a recombinant strain according to the invention will secrete the polypeptide of interest. This will avoid the necessity of disrupting the cell in oider to isolate the polypeptide of interest and also minimise the risk of degradation of the expressed product by other components of the host cell.<br>
Chrysosporium can be defined by morphology consistent with that disclosed in Bamett and Hunter 1972, Illustrated Genera of Imperfect Fungi, 3rd Edition of Burgess Publishing Company. Other sources providing details concerning classification of fungi of the genus Chrysosporium are<br><br>
known e.g...Sutton Classification (Van Oorschot, C.A.N. (1980) "A revision of Chysosporhm and allied genera" in Studio in Mycology No. 20 of the CBS in Baam The Netfierlands pl-36). CBS is one of the depository institutes of the Budapest Treaty. According to these teachings the genus Chysosporium falls within the family MonUicu^eae which belongs to tfie order Hyphomycetales. The criteria that can be used are the following:<br>
1.	Signs of Hvphomvcetales order:<br>
Conidia are produced directly on mycelium, on separate sporogenous cells or on distinct conidiophores.<br>
2.	Signs of Moniliaceae family:<br>
Both conidia and conidiophores (if present) are hyaline or brightly coloured; conidiophores are single or in loose clusters.<br>
3.	Signs of Chrvsosporium Corda 1833 genus:<br>
Colonies are usually spreading, white, sometimes cream-coloured, pale brown or yellow, felty and/or powdery. Hyphae are mostly hyaline and smooth-walled, with irregular, more or less orthotopic branching. Fertile hyphae exhibit little or no differentiation. Conidia are terminal and lateral, thallic, borne all over the hyphae, sessile or on short protrusions or side branches, subhyaiine or pale yellow, thin- or thick-walled, subgiobose, clavate, pyriform, orobovoid, 1-celled, rarely 2-celled, truncate. Intercalary conidia are sometimes present, are solitary, occasionally catenate, subhyaiine or pale yellow, broader than the supporting hyphae, normally I-celled, truncate at both ends. Chlamydospores are occasionally present.<br>
Another source providing information on fungal nomenclature is ATCC (US). Their website is http://www.atcc.org. CBS also has a website (http//www.cbs.knaw.nl) providing relevant information. VKM in Moscow is also a reliable source of such information; the e-mail address for VKM is http://www.bdt.org.br.bdt.msdn.vkm/general. Another source is http//NT.ars-grin.gov/-fungaldatabases. All these institutions can provide teaching on the distinguishing characteristics of a Chrysosporitan.<br>
Strains defined as being of Myceliophthora thermophila are not considered to define Chysosporium strains according to the definition of the invention. In the past there has been considerable confusion over the nomenclature of some Afyceliophthora strains. Preferably the Chrysosporium according to the invention are those which are clearly distinguishable as such and cannot be confused with Myceliophthora, Sporotrichum or Phanerochaete chysosporium.<br>
The following strains are defined as Chrysosporium but the definition of Chrysosporium is not limited to these strains: C botryoides, C carmichaelii, C crassitunicatum, C europae, C evolceannui, C farinicola, C fastidium, C, flliforme, C georgiae, C. globiferum, C. globiferum var. articulatum, C globiferum var. niveum, C hirundo, C hispanicum, C holmii, C, indicvm, C inops, C<br><br>
keraiinophilum, C. kreiseiik C. kuzuroviaman, C lignorum, C lobatum, C luchtawense, C. lucknowense Garg 27K/ C medium, C. medium var. spissescens, C. mephiticum, C. nmrdariun% C merdarium var. roseum, C minor, C pannicola, C panmm, C. parvum var. crescens, C pilosum, C pseudomerdarium, C. pyriformis, C. qwensiandicwn, C. sigleri C. sulfisreum, C syrwhroman, C. tropicum, C. undulatum, C. vallenareme, C. vespertiUum, C. zonatum.<br>
C. lucknowense forms one of the species of Chysosporium that have raised particular interest as it has provided a natural high producer of cellulase proteins (WO 98/15633 and related US 5,811,381). The characteristics of this Chysosporium lucknoweme are:<br>
Colonies attain 55 mm diameter on Sabouraud glucose agar in 14 days, are cream-coloured, feity and fluffy; dense and 3-5 mm high; margins are defined, regular, and fimbriate; reverse pale yellow to cream-coloured. Hyphae are hyaline, smooth- and thin-walled, little branched. Aerial hyphae are mostly fertile and closely septate, about 1-3.5 mm wide. Submerged hyphae are mfertile, about 1-4.5 mm wide, with the thinner hyphae often being contorted. Conidia are terminal and lateral, mostly sessile or on short, frequently conical protrusions or short side branches. Conidia are solitary but in close proximity to one another, 1-4 conidia developing on one hyphal cell, subhyaline, fairly thin- and smooth-walled, mostly subglobose, also clavate orobovoid, 1-celled, 2.5x 11 x 1.5-6 mm, with broad basal scars (1-2 mm). Intercalaiy conidia are absent Chlamydospores are absent. ATCC 44006, CBS 251.72, CBS 143.77 and CBS 272.77 are examples of Chysosporium lucknowense strains and odier examples are provided in WO 98/15633 and US 5,811^81.<br>
A further strain was isolated from this species with an even higher production capacity for celluiases. This strain is called CI by its internal notation and was deposited with the International Depository of the All Russian Collection of micro-organisms of the Russian Academy of Sciences Bakrushina Street 8, Moscow, Russia 113184 on August 29, 1996, as a deposit acccnding to the Budapest Treaty and was assigned Accession Number VKM F-3500D. It is called Chysosporium lucknowense Garg 27K. The characteristics of the CI strain are as follows:<br>
Colonies grow to about 55-66 nun diameter in size on potato-dextrose ^ar in about 7 days; are white-cream-coloured, feity, 2-3 mm high at the center; margins are defined, regular, fimbriate; reverse pale, cream-coloured. Hyphae are hyaline, smooth- and thin-walled, little branched. Aerial hyphae are fertile, septate, 2-3 mm wide. Submerged hyphae are infertile. Conidia are terminal and lateral; sessile or on short side branches; absent; solitaiy, but in close proximity to one another, hyaline, thin- and smooth-walled, subglobose, clavate or obovoid, 1-celled, 4-10 nun, Chlamydospores are absent. Intercalary conidia are absent.<br>
The method of isolation of the CI strain is described in WO 98/15633 and US 5,811,381. Strains exhibiting such morphology are included within the definition of Chysosporium according to the invention. Also included within the definition of Chysosporium are strains derived from Chysosporium predecessors including those that have mutated somewhat either naturally or by induced<br><br>
mutagenesis. In particular the inventicw covers mutants of Chysosporium obtained by induced mutagenis, especially by ti combination of irradiation and chemical mutagenesis.<br>
For example strain CI was mutagenised by subjecting it to ultraviolet light to generate strain UV13-6. This strain was subsequently further mutated with N-methyl-NT'^ittro-NHiitrosoguanidine to generate strain NG7C-19. The latter strain in turn was subjected to mutation by ultraviolet light resulting in strain UV18-25. During this mutation process the morphological characteristics have varied somewhat in culture in liquid or on plates as well as under die microscope. With each successive mutagenesis the cultures showed less of the flufiy and felty appearance on plates that are described as being characteristic of Chysosporium, until the colonies attained a. flat and matted appearance. A brown pigment observed with the wild type strain in some media was also less prevalent in mutant strains. In liquid culture the mutant UV 18-25 was noticeably less viscous than the wild type strain CI and the mutants UV 13-6 and NG7C-19. While all strains maintained the gross microscopic characteristics of Chysosporium, the mycelia became narrower with each successive mutation and widi UV 18-25 distinct fragmentation of the mycelia could be observed. This mycelial fhigmentation is likely to be the cause of the lower viscosity associated with cultures of UV18-25. The ability of the strains to sporulate decreased with each mutagenic step. The above illustrates that for a strain to belong to the genus Chysosporium there is some leeway firom the above morphological definition. At each mutation step production of cellulase and extracellular proteins has in addition also increased, while several mutations resulted in decrease of protease expression. Criteria with which fungal taxonomy can be determined are available fiom CBS, VKMF and ATCC for example.<br>
In paiticular the anamorph form of Chysosporium has been found to be suited for the production application according to the invention. The metabolism of the anamorph renders it extremely suitable for a high degree of expression. A teleomorph should also be suitably as the genetic make-up of the anamorphs and teleomorphs is identical. The difference between anamorph and teleomorph is that one is the asexual state and the other is the sexual state. The two states exhibit different morphology under certain conditions.<br>
It is preferable to use non-toxic Chrysosporium strains of which a number are known in the art as this will reduce risks to the environment upon large scale production and simplify production procedures with the concomitant reduction in costs.<br>
An expression-regulating region is a DNA sequence recognised by the host Chysosporium strain for expression. It comprises a promoter sequence operably linked to a nucleic acid sequence encoding the polypeptide to be expressed. The promoter is linked such that the positioning vis-a-vis the initiation codon of the sequence to be expressed allows expression. The promoter sequence can be constitutive or inducible. Any expression regulating sequence or combination thereof capable of permitting expression of a polypeptide from a Chysosporium strain is envisaged. The expression regulating sequence is suitably a fungal expression-regulating region e.g. an ascomycete regulating<br><br>
region. Suitably the fungal expression regulating regicm is a regulating region from any of the following genera of fungi: Aspergillus, Trichoderma, Chrysosporium, Hansemda, Mn^or, Pichia, Neurospora, Tolypocladium, Rhizomucor, Fusarium, Penicillium, Saccharomyces, Talaromyces or alternative sexual forms thereof like Emericella, Ifypocrea e.g. the cellobiohydrolase {Homoter from Trichoderma^ glucoamylase promoter from Aspergillus, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase promoter from Aspergillus, alcohol dehydrogenase A and alcohol dehydrogenase R promoter of Aspergillus, TAKA amylase promoter from Aspergillus, phosphoglycerate and cross-pathway control promoters of Neurospora, aspartic proteinase promoter of Rhizomucor miehei, lipase promoter of Rhizomucor miehei and beta-galactosidase promoter of Penicillium canescens. An expression regulating sequence from the same genus as the host strain is extremely suitable, as it is most likely to be specifically adsq^ted to the specific host. Thus preferably the expression regulating sequence is one from a Chrysosporium strain.<br>
We have found particular strains of Chrysosporium to express proteins in extremely large amounts and natural e^qsression regulating sequences from these strains are of particular interest. These strains are internally designated as Chrysosporium strain CI, strain UV13-6, strain NG7C-I9 and strain UV18-25. They have been deposited in accordance with the Budapest Treaty with the All Russian Collection (VKM) depository institute in Moscow. Wild type CI strain was deposited in accordance with the Budapest Treaty with the number VKM F-3S00 D, deposit date 29-08-1996, CI UVl 3-6 mutant was deposited with number VKM F-3632 D, and deposit date 02-09-1998, CI NG7c-19 mutant was deposited with number VKM F-3633 D and deposit date 02-09-1998 and CI UV18-25 mutant was deposited with number VKM F-3631 D and deposit date 02-09-1998.<br>
Preferably an expression-regulating region enabling high expression in the selected host is applied. This can also be a high expression-regulating region derived from a heterologous host, such as are well known in the art. Specific examples of proteins known to be expressed in large quantities and thus providing suitable expression regulating sequences for the invention are without being limited thereto hydrophobin, protease, amylase, xylanase, pectinase, esterase, beta-galactosidase, ceiluiase (e.g. endo-giucanase, cellobiohydrolase) and polygalacturonase. The high production has been ascertained in both solid state and submerged fermentation conditions. Assays for assessing the presence or production of such proteins are well known in the art. The catalogues of Sigma and Megazyme for example provide numerous examples. Megas^me is located at Bray Business Park, Bray, County Wicklow in Ireland. Sigma Aldrich has many affiliates world wide e.g. USA P.O. Box 14S08 St. Louis Missouri. For ceiluiase we refer to commercially available assays such as CMCase assays, endoviscometric assays, Avicelase assays, beta-glucanase assays, RBBCMCase assays, Ceilazyme C assays. Alternatives are well known to a person skilled in the art and can be found from general literature concerning the subject and such information is considered incorporated herein by reference. By way of example we refer to "Methods in Enzymology Volume 1, 1955 right through to<br><br>
volumes 297-299 of 1998. Suitably a Chrysosporium (HDinoter sequence is iqiplied to ensure good recognition thereof by the host<br>
We have found that heterologous expression-regulating sequences woric as efficiently in Chrysosporium as native Chrysosporitm sequences. This allows well known constructs and vectors to be used in transformation of Chrysosporium as well as offering numerous other possibilities for constructing vectors enabling good rates of expression in this novel egression and secretion host For example standard Aspergillus transformation techniques can be used as described for example by Christiansen et al in Bio/TechnoL 6:1419-1422 (1988). Other documents providing details of Aspergillus transformation vectors, e.g. US patents 4,816,405, 5,198;}45, 5,503,99.1, 5,364,770 and 5,578,463, EP-B-215.594 (also for Trichoderma) and their contents are incorporated by reference. As extremely high expression rates for ceilulase have been ascertained for Chrysosporium strains, the expression regulating regions of such proteins are particularly preferred. We refer for specific examples to the previously mentioned deposited Chrysosporium strains.<br>
A nucleic acid construct comprising a nucleic acid expression regulatory region from Chrysosporium^ preferably from Chrysosporium lucknowense or a derivative thereof forms a separate embodiment of the invention as does the mutant Chrysosporium strain comprising such operably linked to a polypeptide to be expressed. Suitably such a nucleic acid construct will be an expression regulatory region from Chrysosporium associated with ceilulase or xylanase expression, preferably cellobiohydroiase expression, more specifically expression of a 55 kDa cellobiohydrolase. The Chrysosporiimt promoter sequences of an endoglucanase of 25 kDa (C1-EG5) and of an endo-glucanase of 43 kDa (CI-EG6), wherein the molecular weights are determined according to SDS PAGE (with the molecular weights according to amino acid sequence data bemg 21.9 kDa and 39.5 kDa), are provided by way of example. Thus, the Chrysosporium promoter sequences of hydrophobin, protease, amylase, xylanase, esterase, pecdnase, beta-galactosidase, ceilulase (e.g. endoglucanase, cellobiohydrolase) and polygalacturonase are considered to also fall within the scope of the invention. Any of the promoters or regulatory regions of expression of enzymes disclosed in Table A or B can be suitably employed. The nucleic acid sequence according to the invention can suitably be obtained from a Chrysosporium strain according to the invention, such strain being defined elsewhere in the description. The maimer in which promoter sequences can be determined are numerous and well known in the art. Nuclease deletion experiments of the region upstream of the ATG codon at the beginning of the relevant gene will provide such sequence. Also for example analysis of consensus sequences can lead to finding a gene of interest. Using hybridisation and amplification techniques one skilled in the art can readily arrive at the corresponding promoter sequences.<br>
The promoter sequences of CI endoglucanases were identified in this manner, by cloning the corresponding genes, and are given in SEQ ID No.*s 2 (EG5) and 1 (EG6), respectively. Other preferred promoters according to the invention are the 55 kDa cellobiohydrolase (CBHl) promoter<br><br>
and the 30 kDa xylanase (XylF) promoters, as the en^ones are expressed at hi^. level by their own promoters. The corresponding promoter sequences can be identified in a straightforward manner by cloning as described below for the endoglucanase promoters, using the partial sequence information given in SEQ ID No. 4 (for CBHl) and SEQ ID No. 5 (for XylF), respectively. The promoters of the carbohydrate-degrading enzymes of Chrysosporium, especially CI promoters, can advantageously be used for expressing desired polypeptides in a host organism, especially a fungal or other microbial host organism. Promoter sequences having at least 60%, preferably at least 70%, most preferably at least 80% nucleotide sequence identity with the sequence given in SEQ ID No's I and 2, or with the sequences found for other Chrysosporium genes, are part of the present invention.<br>
For particular embodiments of the recombinant strain and the nucleic acid sequence according to the invention we also refer to the examples. We also refer for the recombinant strains to prior art describing high expression promoter sequences in particular those providing high expression in fungi e.g. such as are disclosed for Aspergillus and Trichoderma, The prior art provides a number of expression regulating regions for use in Aspergillus e.g. US 5,252,726 of Novo and US 5,705,358 of Unilever. The contents of such prior art are hereby incorporated by referoice.<br>
The hydrophobin gene is a fungal gene that is highly expressed. It is thus suggested that the promoter sequence of a hydrophobin gene, preferably ftom Chrysospprium, may be suitably applied as expression regulating sequence in a suitable embodiment of the invention. Trichoderma reesei and Trichoderma harzianum gene sequences for hydrophobin have been disclosed for example in the prior art as well as a gene sequence for Aspergillus Jumigatus and Aspergillus nidulans and the relevant sequence information is hereby incorporated by reference (Munoz et al, Curr, Genet 1997,32(3);225-230; Nakari-Setala T. et al, Eur. 1 Biochem. 1996 15:235 (l-2):248-255, M. Parta et al. Infect. Immun. 1994 62 (10): 4389-4395 and Stringer M.A. et al. MoL Microbiol. 1995 16(l):33-44). Using this sequence information a person skilled in the art can obtain the expression regulating sequraces of Chrysosporium hydrophobin genes without undue experimentation following standard techniques as suggested already above. A recombinant Chrysosporium strain according to the invention can comprise a hydrophobin-regulating region operably linked to the sequence encoding the polypeptide of interest.<br>
An expression regulating sequence can also additionally comprise an enhancer or silencer. These are also well known in the prior art and are usually located some distance away from the promoter. The expression regulating sequences can also comprise promoters with activator binding sites and repressor binding sites. In some cases such sites may also be modified to eliminate this type of regulation. Filamentous lungal promoters in which creA sites are present have been described. Such creA sites can be mutated to ensure the glucose repression normally resulting from the presence of the non-mutated sites is eliminated. Gist-Brocades' WO 94/13820 illustrates this principle. Use of such a promoter enables production of the polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid sequence regulated<br><br>
by the promoter in the presence of glucose. The same principle is also ^parent from WO 97/09438. These promoters can be used either with or without their creA sites. Mutants in ^ich the creA sites have been mutated can be used as expression regulating sequences in a recombinant strain according to the invention and the nucleic acid sequence it regulates can then be expressed m tfie presence of glucose. Such Chrysosporiwn promoters ensure derepression in an analogous manner to that illustrated in WO 97/09438. The identity of creA sites is known from the prior art Alternatively, it is possible to apply a promoter with CreA binding sites that have not been mutated in a host strain with a mutation elsewhere in the repression system e.g. in the creA gene itself, so that the strain can, notwithstanding the presence of creA binding sites, produce the protein or polypqitide in die presence of glucose.<br>
Terminator sequences are also expression-regulating sequences and these are operably linked to the 3* terminus of the sequence to be expressed. Any fungal terminator is likely to be functional in the host Chrysosporium strain according to the invention. Examples are^ nidulans trpC terminator (1), ^. niger alpha-glucosidase terminator (2),^^. niger glucoamylase terminator (3), Mvcor miehei carboxyl protease terminator (US 3,578,463) and the Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase terminator. Naturally Chrysosporium terminator sequences will function in Chrysosporium and are suitable e.g. EG6 terminator.<br>
A suitable recombinant Chrysosporium strain according to the invention has the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed operably linked to a sequence encoding the amino acid sequence defined as signal sequence. A signal sequence is an amino acid sequence which when operably linked to the amino acid sequence of the expressed polypeptide allows secretion thereof fix&gt;m the host fungus. Such a signal sequence may be one normally associated with the heterologous polypeptide or may be one native to the host It can also be foreign to both host and the polypeptide. The nucleic acid sequence encoding die signal sequence must be positioned in frame to permit translation of die signal sequence and the heterologous polypeptide. Any signal sequence capable of permitting secretion of a polypeptide from a Chrysosporium strain is envisaged. Such a signal sequence is suitably a fungal signal sequence, preferably an ascomycete signal sequence.<br>
Suitable examples of signal sequences can be derived from yeasts in general or any of the following specific genera of fungi: Aspergillus, Trichoderma, Chrysosporium, Pichia, Neurospora, Rhizomucor, Hansenula, Humicola, Mucor, Tolypocladium, Fusarium, Penicillium, Saccharomyces, Talaromyces or alternative sexual forms thereof like Emericella, Hypocrea. Signal sequences that are particularly useful are often natively associated with the following proteins a cellobiohydrolase, an endoglucanase, a beta-galactosidase, a xylanase, a pectinase, an esterase, a hydrophobin, a protease or an amylase. Examples include amylase or glucoamylase of Aspergillus or Humicola (4), TAKA amylase of Aspergillus oryzae, alpha-amylase of Aspergillus niger, carboxyl peptidase of Mucor (US 5,578,463), a lipase or proteinase from Rhizomucor miehei, cellobiohydrolase of Trichoderma (5),<br><br>
beta-galactosidase of Penicillium canescens and alpha mating &amp;ctor ofSaccharomyces,<br>
Altemativety'the signal sequence can be from an amylase or subtilisin gene of a strain of Bacillus, A signal sequence from the same genus as the host strain is extremely suitable as it is most likely to be specifically adapted to the specific host thus preferably the signal sequence is a signal sequence of Chrysosporium, We have found particular strains of Chrysosporium to excrete proteins in extremely large amounts and naturally signal sequences from these strains are of particular interest. These strains are internally designated as Chrysosporitm strain CI, strain UV13-6, strain NG7C-19 and strain UV18-25. They have been deposited in accordance with the Budapest Treaty as described elsewhere in this description. Signal sequences from filamentous fungi, yeast and bacteria are useful. Signal sequences of non-fungal origin are also considered useful, particularly bacterial, plant and mammalian.<br>
A recombinant Chrysosporium strain according to any of the embodiments of the invention can further comprise a selectable marker. Such a selectable marker will permit easy selection of transformed or transfected cells. A selectable maricer often encodes a gene product providing a specific type of resistance forei^ to the non-transformed strain. This can be resistance to heavy metals, antibiotics and biocides in general. Prototrophy is also a useful selectable maiicer of the non-antibiotic variety. Non-antibiotic selectable markers can be preferred where the protein or polypeptide of interest is to be used in food or pharmaceuticals with a view to speedier or less complicated regulatory approval of such a product. Very often the GRAS indication is used for such markers. A number of such markers are available to the person skilled in the art. The FDA e.g. provides a list of such. Most commonly used are selectable maricers selected from the group conferring resistance to a drug or relieving a nutritional defect e.g the group comprising amdS (acetamidase), hph (hygromycin phosphotransferase), pyrG (orotidine-S-phosphate decarboxylase), trpC (anthrantlate synthase), argB (omidiine carbamoyltransferase), sC (sulphate adenyltransferase), bar (phosphinodiricin acetyl-transferase), glufosinate resistance, niaD (nitrate reductase), a bleomycin resistance gene, more specifically Sh ble, sulfonylurea resistance e.g. acetolactate synthase mutation iivl. Selection can also be carried out by virtue of cotransformation where the selection maricer is on a separate vector or where the selection marker is on the same nucleic acid fragment as the polypeptide-encoding sequence for the polypeptide of interest.<br>
As used herein the term heterologous polypeptide is a protein or polypeptide not normally expressed and secreted by the Chrysosporium host strain used for expression according to the invention. The polypeptide can be of plant or animal (vertebrate or invertebrate) origin e.g. mammalian, fish, insect, or micro-organism origin, with the proviso it does not occur in the host strain. A mammal can include a human. A micro-organism comprises viruses, bacteria, archaebacteria and fungi i.e. filamentous fungi and yeasts. Sergey's Manual for Bacterial Determinology provides adequate lists of bacteria and archaebacteria. For pharmaceutical purposes quite often a preference<br><br>
will exist for human proteins thus a recombinant host according to the invention forming a preferred embodiment will be a host wherein the polypeptide is of human origin. For purposes such as food production suitably the heterologous polypeptide will be of animal, plant or algal origin. Such embodiments are therefore also considered suitable examples of the invention. Alternative embodiments that are useful also include a heterologous polypeptide of any of bacterial, yeast, viral, archaebacterial and fungal origin. Fungal origin is most preferred.<br>
A suitable embodiment of the invention will comprise a heterologous nucleic acid sequence with adapted codon usage. Such a sequence encodes the native amino acid sequence of the host from which it is derived, but has a different nucleic acid sequence, i.e. a nucleic acid sequence in which certain codons have been replaced by other codons encoding the same amino acid but ^ich are more readily used by the host strain being used for expression. This can lead to better expression of the heterologous nucleic acid sequence. This is common practice to a person skilled in the art. This adapted codon usage can be carried out on the basis of known codon usage of fungal vis-&amp;-vis non-fungal codon usage. It can also be even more specifically adapted to codon usage of Chrysosporium itself. The similarities are such that codon usage as observed in Trichoderma, Humicola and Aspergillus should enable exchange of sequences of such organisms without adaptation of codon usage. Details are available to the skilled person concerning the codon usage of these fungi and are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The invention is not restricted to the above mentioned recombinant Chrysosporium strains, but also covers a recombinant Chrysosporium strain comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a homologous protein for a Chrysosporium strain, said nucleic acid sequence being operably linked to an expression-regulating region and said recombinant strain expressing more of said protein than the corresponding non-recombinant strain under the same conditions. In the case of homologous polypeptide of interest such is preferably a neutral or alkaline en^one like a hydrolase, a protease or a carbohydrate degrading enzyme as already described elsewhere. The polypeptide may also be acidic. Preferably the recombinant strain will express the polypeptide in greater amounts than the non-recombinant strain. All comments mentioned vis-a-vis the heterologous polypeptide are also valid (mutatis mutandis) for the homologous polypeptide cellulase.<br>
Thus the invention also covers genetically engineered Chrysosporium strains wherein the sequence that is introduced can be of Chrysosporium origin. Such a strain can, however, be distinguished from natively occurring strains by virtue of for example heterologous sequences being present in the nucleic acid sequence used to transform or transfect the Chrysosporium, by virtue of the fact that multiple copies of the sequence encoding the polypeptide of interest are present or by virtue of the fact that these are expressed in an amount exceeding that of the non-engineered strain under identical conditions or by virtue of the fact that expression occurs under normally non-expressing conditions. The latter can be the case if an inducible promoter regulates the sequence of interest<br><br>
contrary to the non-recombinant situation or if another factor induces the expression than is the case in the non-engineered strain. The invention as defined in the preceding embodiments is not intended to cover naturally occurring Chysosporium strains. The invention is directed at strains d^ved dirough engineering either using classical genetic technologies or genetic engmeering mediodologies.<br>
All the recombinant strains of the invention can comprise a nucleic acid sequence encoding a heterologous protein selected from carbohydrate-degrading enzymes (cellulases, ?Q^]anases, mannanases, mannosidases, pectinases, amylases, e.g. glucoamylases, a-amylases, alpha- and beta-galactosidases, a- and p-glucosidases, p-glucanases, chitinases, chitanases), proteases (endoproteases,<br>
amino-proteases, amino-and carboxy-peptidases), other hydrolases (lipases, esterases, phytases), oxidoreductases (catalases, glucose-oxidases) and transferases (transglycosylases, transglutaminases, isomerases and invertases).<br><br>
Note:      * all other molecular weights by SDS PAGE<br>
*	enzymes were taken in equal protein contents<br>
*	xyl = xylanase<br>
*	endo = endoglucanase<br>
*** gal = galactosidase<br>
*	glue = glucosidase<br>
*CBN = cellbiohydrolase<br>
*PGU = polygalacturonase<br><br><br><br>
The most interesting products to be produced accoprding to invention are cellulases, xylanases, pectinases, lipases and proteases, wherein cellulases and xylanases cleave beta-l,4-bonds, and cellulases comprise endoglucanases, ceilobiohydrolases and beta-glucosidases. These proteins are extremely useful in various industrial processes known m the art Specifically for cellulases we refer e.g. to WO 98/15633 describing ceilobiohydrolases and endoglucanases of use. The contents of said application are hereby incorporated by reference. We also refer to Tables A and B providing further details of interesting Chrysosporium proteins.<br>
It was found according to the invention, that Chrysosporium mutants can be made that have reduced expression of protease, thus making tiiem even more suitable for the production of proteinaceous products, especially if the proteinaceous product is sensitive to protease activity. Thus the invention also involves a mutant Chrysosporium strain which produces less protease than non-mutant Chrysosporium strain, for example less than C lucknowense strain CI (VKM F-3500 D). In particular the protease acitivity of such strains is less than half the amount, more in particular less than 30% of the amount produced by CI strain. The decreased protease activity can be measured by known methods, such as by measuring the halo formed op skim milk plates or BSA degradation.<br>
An embodiment of the invention diat is of particular interest is a recombinant Chrysosporium according to the invention wherein the nucleic acid sequence encoding the polypeptide of interest encodes a polypeptide that is inactivated or unstable at acid pH i.e. pH below 6, even below pH 5,5, more suitably even below pH 5 and even as low as or lower than pH 4. This is a particularly interesting embodiment, as the generally disclosed fungal expression systems are not cultured under conditions that are neutral to alkaline, but are cultured at acidic pH. Thus the system according to the invention provides a safe fungal expression system for proteins or polypeptides that are susceptible to being inactivated or are unstable at acid pH.<br>
Quite specifically a recombinant strain as defined in any of the embodiments according to the invention, wherein the nucleic acid sequence encoding the polypeptide of interest encodes a protein or polypeptide exhibiting optimal activity and/or stability at a pH above 5, preferably at neutral or alkaline pH (i.e. above 7) and/or at a pH higher than 6, is considered a preferred embodiment of the invention. More than 50%, more than 70% and even more than 90% of optimal activities at such pH values are anticipated as being particularly useful embodiments. A polypeptide expressed under the cultivation conditions does not necessarily have to be active at the cultivation conditions, in fact it can be advantageous for it to be cultured under conditions under which it is inactive as its active form could be detrimental to the host. This is the case for proteases for example. What is however required is for the protein or polypeptide to be stable under the cultivation conditions. The stability can be thermal stability. It can also be stability against specific compositions or chemicals, such as are present for example in compositions or processes of production or<br><br>
application of, die polypeptide or protein of interest LAS in detergent compositicMis comprising celiulases or lipases, etc. Is an example of a chemical often detrimental to proteins. The time periods of use in q^plications can vary from short to long exposure so stability can be over a varying length of time varymg per application. The skilled person will be able to ascertain the correct conditions on a case by case basis. One can use a number of conmiercially available assays to detennine the optimal activities of the various en^onatic products. The catalogues of Sigma and Meg/aayxne for example show such. Specific examples of tests are mentioned elsewhere in the description. The manufacturers provide guidance on the application.<br>
We have surprisingly found that a Chysosporium strain that can be suitably used to transform or transfect with the sequence of interest to be expressed is a strain exhibiting relatively low biomass. We have found that Chysosporium strains having a biomass two to five times lower than that of Trichoderma reesei when cultured to a viscosity of 200-600 cP at the end of fermentation and exhibiting a biomass of 10 to 20 times lower than that of Aspergillus niger when cultured to a viscosity of lSOO-2000 cP under corresponding conditions, i.e. their respective optimal cultivation conditions can provide a high level of expression. This level of expression far exceeds that of tfie two commercial reference strains at a much lower biomass mA at much lower viscosity. This means that the yield of expression of such Chysosporium strains will be appreciably higher than from Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma reesei. Such a transformed or transfected Chysosporium strain forms a suitable embodiment of the invention.<br>
We find a biomass of 0,5-1,0 g/1 for Chysosporium strain C 1(18-25) as opposed to 2,5-5,0 g/1 for Trichxierma reesei and 5-10 g/1 of Aspergillus niger under the above described conditions. In the Examples we provide details of this process.<br>
In a suitable embodiment a recombinant Chysosporium strain according to the invention produces protein or polypeptide in at least the amount equivalent to the production in moles per liter of cellulase by the strain UV13-6 or C-19, and most preferably at least equivalent to or higher than that of the strain UV18-25 under the corresponding or identical conditions, i.e. their respective optimal cultivation conditions.<br>
Unexpectedly we have also found that expression and secretion rates are exceedingly high when using a Chysosporium strain exhibiting the mycelial morphology of strain UV18-25 i.e. fragmented short mycelia. Thus a recombinant strain according to the invention will preferably exhibit such morphology. The invention however also covers non-recombinant strains or otherwise engineered strains of Chrysosporium exhibiting this novel and inventive characteristic. Also covered by the invention is a recombinant Chrysosporium strain in any of the embodiments described according to the invention further exhibiting reduced sporulation in comparison to CI, preferably below that of strain UV13-6, preferably below that of NG7C-I9, preferably below that of UV18-25 under equivalent fermenter conditions. Also covered by the invention is a recombinant Chysosporium<br><br>
strain in any of the embodiments described according to the mvention fuitha* exhibiting at least the amount of protein production ratio to biomass in comparison to CI, preferably in comparison to that of any of strains UV13-6, NG7C-19 and UV18-25 under equivalent fermenter conditions. The invention however also covers non-recombinant strains or otherwise engineered strains of Chrysosporium exhibiting this novel and inventive characteristic as such or in combination with any of the other embodiments.<br>
Another attractive embodiment of the invention also covers a recombinant Chrysosporium strain exhibiting a viscosity below that of strain NG7C-19, preferably below that of UV18-25 under corresponding or identical fermenter conditions. The invention however also covers non-recombinant strains or otherwise engineered strains of Chrysosporium exhibiting this novel and inventive characteristic as such or in combination with any of the other embodiments. We have determined that the viscosity of a culture of UV18-25 is below 10 cP opposed to that of Trichoderma reesei being of the order 200-600 cP, with that of Aspergillus niger being of the order 1500-2000 cP under their respective optimal culture conditions at the end of fermentation. The process used for such determination is provided in the examples.<br>
Viscosity can be assessed in many cases by visual monitoring. The fluidity of the substance can vary to such a large extent that it can be nearly solid, sauce like or liquid. Viscosity can also readily be ascertained by Brookfleld rotational viscometry, use of kinematic viscosity tubes, ialling ball viscometer or cup type viscometer. The yields from such a low viscosity culture are higher than from the commercial known higher viscosity cultures per time unit and per cell.<br>
The processing of such low viscosity cultures according to the invention is advantageous in particular when the cultures are scaled up. The subject Chrysosporium strains with the low viscosity perform very well in cultures as large as up to 150,000 liter cultures. Thus any culture size up to 150,000 litres provides a useful embodiment of the invention. Any other conventional size of fermentation should be carried out well with the strains according to the invention. The reasoning behind this is that problems can arise in large scale production with the formation of aggregates that have mycelia that are too dense and/or are unevenly distributed. The media as a result cannot be effectively utilised during the culture thus leading to an inefficient production process in particular in large scale fermentations i.e. over 150,000 liters. Aeration and mixing become problematic leading to oxygen and nutrient starvation and thus reduced concentration of productive biomass and reduced yield of polypeptide during the culture and/or can result in longer fermentation times. In addition high viscosity and high shear are not desirable in commercial fermentation processes and in current commercial processes they are the production limiting factors. Ail these negative aspects can be overcome by the Chrysosporium host according to the invention which exhibits much better characteristics than Trichoderma reesei, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus oryzae that are commercially used in this respect i.e. exhibits better protein production levels and viscosity properties<br><br>
and biomass figures.<br>
A Chrysosporium strain selected fiom CI, UV13-6, NG7C-19 and UV18-25 illustrates various aspects of the invention exceedingly well. The mvention however also covers recombinant strains or otherwise engineered strains of Chrysosporium derived irom the four deposited strains Aat also exhibit any of the novel and inventive characteristics as such or in combination. The deposit data for these strains have been presented elsewhere in the description. The mvention also covers recombinant strains or otherwise engineered strains of Chrysosporium derived from the four deposited strains that also exhibit any of die novel and inventive characteristics as such or in combination. A Chrysosporium strain according to the invention also comprises a strain exhibiting under the corresponding culture conditions a biomass at least twice as low as that of Trichoderma reesei, suitably even more up to 5 times lower than that of Trichoderma reeseiy specifically of a Trichoderma reesei exhibiting a viscosity of 200-600 cP as disclosed under the conditions of the examples. A Chrysosporium strain according to tfie invention also comprises a strain producing the polypeptide in at least the amount in moles per liter of cellulase by the strain CI, UVI3-6, NG7C-19 or UV18-2S under the corresponding or identical conditions.<br>
Chrysosporium strains according to the invention are further preferred if they exhibit optimal growth conditions at neutral to alkaline pH and temperatures of 2S-43^C. A preference can exist for neutral and even for alkaline pH. Such production conditions ve advanU^eous to a number of polypeptides and proteins, in particular those susceptible to attack by acidic pH or those that are inactive or unstable at low temperatures. It is however also an embodiment of the invention to include Chrysosporium strains that can be cultured at acidic pH as this can be useful for certain proteins and polypeptides. A suitable acidic pH lies from 7.0. An acidic pH lower than 6.5 is envisaged as providing a good embodiment of the invention. A pH around 5,0-7,0 is also a suitable embodiment. A neutral pH can be 7.0 or around 7 e.g. 6.5-7.5. As stated elsewhere the pH of optimal interest depends on a number of factors that will be apparent to the person skilled in the art. A pH higher than 7.5 is alkaline, suitably between 7.5-9.0 can be used.<br>
When comparing data of strains according to the invention with other strains perhaps having other optimal conditions (e.g. Aspergillus and Trichoderma) for viscosity measurements, biomass determination or protein production comparisons should be made using the relevant optimal conditions for the relevant strain. This will be obvious to the person skilled in the art.<br>
A Chrysosporium strain according to any of the above-mentioned embodiments of the invention, said strain further exhibiting production of one or more of the fungal enzymes selected from the carbohydrate-degrading en^mes, proteases, other hydrolases, oxidoreductase, and transferases mentioned above is considered a particularly useful embodiment of the invention. The most interesting products are specifically cellulases, xylanases, pectinases, lipases and proteases. Also useful as embodiment of the invention however is a Chrysosporium strain exhibiting production of<br><br>
one or more fungal enzymes that exhibit neutral or alkaline optimal stability and/or activity, preferably alkaline optimal stability and/or activity, said etayme being selected from carbohydrate-degrading enzymes, hydrolases and proteases, preferably hydrolases and carbohydrate-degrading enzymes. In the case of non-recombinant Chrysosporium, such enzymes are suitably other than cellulase as disclosed in WO 98/15633. Enzymes of particular interest are ?Q^lanases, proteases, esterases, alpha galactosidases, beta-galactosidases, beta-glucanases and pectinases. The enzymes are not limited to the aforementioned. The conmients vis-^-vis stability and activity elsewhere in the description are valid here also.<br>
The invention also covers a method of producing a polypeptide of interest, said method comprising culturing a Chrysosporium strain in any of the embodiments according to the invention under conditions permitting expression and preferably secretion of the polypeptide and recovering the subsequently produced {polypeptide of interest.<br>
Where protein or polypeptide is mentioned, variants and mutants e.g. substitution, insertion or deletion mutants of naturally occurring proteins are intended to be included that exhibit the activity of the non-mutant. The same is valid vis-a-vis the coiresponding nucleic acid sequences. Processes such as gene shuffling, protein engineering and directed evolution site directed mutagenesis and random mutagenesis are processes through which such polypeptides, variants or mutants can be obtained. US 5,223,409, US 5,780,279 and US 5,770,356 provide teaching of directed evolution. Using this process a library of randomly mutated gene sequences created for example by gene shuffling via error prone PCR occurs in any cell type. Each gene has a secretion region and an immobilising region attached to it such that the resuhing protein is secreted and stays fixed to the host surface. Subsequently conditions are created that necessitate the biological activity of the particular polypeptide. This occurs for a number of cycles ultimately leading to a final gene with the desired characteristics. In other words a speeded up directed process of evolution. US 5,763,192 also describes a process for obtaining DNA, RNA, peptides, polypeptides or protein by way of synthetic polynucleotide coupling stochastically generated sequences, introduction thereof into a host followed by selection of the host cell with the corresponding predetermined characteristic.<br>
Standard cloning and protein or polypeptide isolation techniques can be used to arrive at the required sequence information. Parts of known sequences can be used as probes to isolate other homologues in other genera and strains. The nucleic acid sequence encoding a particular enzyme activity can be used to screen a Chrysosporium libraty for example. A person skilled in the art will realise which hybridisation conditions are appropriate. Conventional methods for nucleic acid hybridisation construction of libraries and cloning techniques are described in Sambrook et al (Eeds) (1989) hi "Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual" Cold Spring Harbor, Press Plainview, New York, and Ausubel et al (Eds) "Current Protocols in Molecular Biology" (1987) John Wiley and Sons, New York. The relevant information can also be derived from later handbooks and patents, as well as<br><br>
from various commercialiy available kits in the field.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, said method comprises culturing a strain according to the invention under conditions pennitting egression and preferably secretion of the protem or polypeptide or precursor thereof and recovering the subsequently produced polypeptide and optionally subjecting the precursor to additional isolation and purification steps to obtain the polypeptide of interest. Such a method may suitably comprise a cleavage step of the precursor into the polypeptide or precursor of interest The cleavage step can be cleavage with a Kexr2 like protease, any basic amino acid paired protease or ^ex-2 for example when a protease cleavage site links a well secreted protein carrier and the polypeptide of interest A person skilled in the art can readily find Kex-2-Iike protease sequences as consensus sequence details for such are available and a number of alternatives have already been disclosed e.g. furin.<br>
Suitably in a method for production of the polypeptide according to any of the embodiments of the invention the cultivation occurs at pH higher than 5, preferably 5-10, more preferably 6-9. Suitably in such a method the cultivation occurs at a temperature between 25-43 ^, preferably 30-40°C. The Chrysosporium strain used in the method according to the invention is quite suitably a recombinant Chrysosporium strain according to any of the embodiments disclosed. The method according to the invention in such a case can further be preceded by the step of production of a recombinant Chrysosporium strain according to the invention. The selection of the appropriate conditions will depend on the nature of the polypeptide to be expressed and such selection lies well within the realm of normal activity of a person skilled in the art.<br>
The method of production of a recombinant Chrysosporium strain according to the invention is also part of the subject invention. The method comprises stably introducing a nucleic acid sequence encoding a heterologous or homologous polypeptide into a Chrysosporium strain, said nucleic acid sequence being operably linked to an expression regulating region, said introduction occurring in a manner known per se for transforming filamentous fungi. As stated above numerous references hereof are available and a small selection has been cited. The information provided is sufficient to enable the skilled person to carry out the method without undue burden. The method comprises introduction of a nucleic acid sequence comprising any of the nucleic acid elements described in the various embodiments of the recombinant Chrysosporium according to the invention as such or in combination.<br>
By way of example the introduction can occur using the protoplast transformation method. The method is described in the examples. Alternative protoplast or spheroplast transformation methods are known and can be used as have been described in the prior art for other filamentous fungi. Details of such methods can be found in many of the cited references and are thus incorporated by reference. A method according to the invention suitably comprises using a non-recombinant strain of Chrysosporium according to the invention as starting material for introduction of the desired<br><br>
sequence encoaing me poiypepnae or inieresi.<br>
The subject invention also covers a method of producing Chrysosporium enxyme, said method comprising culturing a Chrysosporium strain according to any of the embodiments of the invention as described above in or on a cultivation medium at pH higher than 5, preferably S-10, more preferably 6-9, suitably 6-7.5,7.5-9 as examples of neutral and alkaline pH ranges.<br>
The subject invention also covers such a method using a cultivation medium at a temperature between 25-43 ^'C, preferably 30-40*»C. The combination of preferred pH and temperature is an especially preferred embodiment of the method of producing Chrysosporium engine according to the invention.<br>
More in general the invention further covers a method of producing enzymes exhibiting<br>
neutral or alkaline optimal activity and/or stability, preferably alkaline optimal activity and/or<br>
stability. The preferred ranges vis-^-vis pH and optimal activity as well as assays with which to<br>
determine such have been provided elsewhere in the description. The enzyme should be selected from<br>
carbohydrate-degrading enzymes, proteases, other hydrolases, oxidoreductases, and transferases, as<br>
described above, said method comprising cultivating a host cell transformed or transfected with the<br>
corresponding enzyme-encoding nucleic acid sequence. Suitably such an en2yme will be a<br>
Chrysosporium enzyme. A suitable method such as this comprises production specifically of cellulase, xylanase, pectinase, lipase and protease, wherein cellulase and xylanase cleave p-l,4-bonds and<br>
cellulase comprises endoglucanase, cellobiohydrolase and P-glucosidase. The method accordmg to the invention can comprise cultivating any Chrysosporium host according to the invention comprising nucleic acid encoding such aforementioned enzymes. Suitably the production of non-recombinant Chrysosporium hosts according to the invention is directed at production of carbohydrate degrading en:^mes, hydrolases and proteases. In such a case the enzyme is suitably other than a cellulase. Suitable examples of products to be produced are given in Tables A and B. Methods of isolating are analogous to those described in WO 98/15633 and are incorporated by reference.<br>

An enzyme as disclosed in WO 98/1S633 is excluded. Enzymes according to the invention are represented by die enzymes of Table B. Enzymes with combinations of the pi values and molecular weights mentioned above are also covered.<br>
The invention is also concerned with the (over)production of non-protein products by the mutant (recombinant) strains of the invention. Such non-protein products include primary metabolites such as organic acids, amino acids, and secondary such as antibiotics, e.g. penicillins and cephalosporins. These products are the result of combinations of biochemical pathways, involving several fungal genes of interest. Fungal primary and secondary metabolites and procedures for producing these metabolites in fungal organisms are well known in the art. Examples of the production of primary metabolites have been described by Mattey M., The Production of Organic Acids, Current Reviews in Biotechnology, 12, 87-132 (1992). Examples of the production of secondary metabolites have been described by Penalva et al. The Optimization of Penicillin Biosynthesis in Fungi, Trends in Biotechnology 16,483-489 (1998).<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLES OF BIOMASS AND VISCOSITY DETERMINATIONS<br>
The following operating parameter data ranges have been determined for fungal fermentations using<br>
three different ftmgal organisms. The three fungal organisms compared are: Trichoderma longi-<br>
brachiatum (formerly 71 reeseiX Aspergillus niger and Chrysosporium lucknowense (UV18-25).<br>
Viscositv:<br>
Viscosity is determined on a Brookfield LVF viscometer using the small sample adapter and spindle<br>
number 31.<br>
Turn the water-circulating pump on S minutes prior to viscometer use to equilibrate the water jacket. The water bath temperature should be 30®C.<br>
Obtain a fresh sample of fermentation broth and place 10 ml of the broth in the small sample spindle. Select the spindle speed to give a reading in the range 10-80. Wait four (4) minutes and take the reading from the viscometer scale. Multiply the reading by the factor given below to get the viscosity in centipoise (cP).<br><br><br>
organism using the above procedure:<br>
Viscosity in cP<br>
r. longibrachiaium	200 - 600<br>
Aniger	1,500-2,000<br>
C lucknoweme (UV18-25)	LT 10<br>
Biomass:<br>
Biomass is determined by the following procedure:<br>
Preweigh 5.5 cm filter paper (Whatman 54) in an aluminium weighing dish. Filter S.O ml whole broth through the 5.5 cm paper on a Buchner funnel, wash the filter cake with 10 mi deionised water, place the washed cake and filter in a weiring pan and dry overnight at 60^C. Finish drying at lOO^C for 1 hour, then place in desiccator to cool.<br>
Measure the weight of dried material. Total biomass (g/1) is equal to the difference between the initial and finals weights multiplied by 200. The following biomass ranges have been determined for fermentations using the specified fungal organism using the above procedure:<br>
Biomass in g/I<br>
T longibrachiaium	2.5 - 5<br>
A. niger	5-10<br>
C/wcJbiowe/i^eCUV 18-25)	0.5- 1<br>
Protein:<br>
Protein levels were determined using the BioRad Assay Procedure from Sigma Company. Protein<br>
levels were highest for the Chrysosporium,<br>
The data presented above represent values determined 48 hours into the fermentation process until<br>
fermentation end; All values of Aspergilli and Trichoderma are for commercially relevant fungal<br>
organisms and reflect actual commercial data.<br>
A fungal strain such as C. lucknowense (UV 18-25) has the advantage that the low viscosity permits the use of lower power input and/or shear the in the fermentation to meet oxygen demands for those cases where shear stress on the product may be detrimental to productivity due to physical damage of the product molecule. The lower biomass production at high protein production indicates a more efficient organism in the conversion of fermentation media to product. Thus the Chrysosporium provides better biomass and viscosity data whilst also delivering at least as much protein, and in fact a lot more protein than the two commercially used systems which obviously are better than for typically deposited Aspergillus or Trichoderma reesei strains in general public collections.<br>
The high protein production with low biomass concentration produced by C lucknowense<br><br>
(UV18-25) would allow development of fermentation conditions with higher multiples of increase in biomass, if increasing biomass results in increased productivity, for the desired product before reaching limiting fermentation conditions. The present high levels of biomass and viscosity produced by the T. longibrachiaitm and A, niger organisms restrict the increase of biomass as the present levels of biomass and viscosity are near limiting practical fermentation conditions.<br>
EXAMPLES OF TRANSFORMATION COMPARING CHRYSQSPORIUM. TRICHQDERMA AND TOLYPOCLADIUM GEODES<br>
Two untransformed Chrysosporium CI strains and one Trichoderma reesei reference strain were tested on two media (Gs pH 6,8 and Pridham agar, PA, pH 6,8). To test the antibiotic resistance level spores were collected from 7 day old PDA plates. Selective plates were incubated at 32°C and scored after 2,4 and S days. It followed that the C-1 strains NG7C-19 and UV18-2S clearly have a low basal resistance level both to phleomycin and hygromycin. This level is comparable to that for a reference T. reesei commonly used laboratory strain. Thus there is clear indication these two standard fungal selectable markers can be used well in Chrysosporium strains. Problems with other standard fungal selectable markers should not be expected.<br>
Selection of Sh-ble (phleomycin-resistance) transformed Chrysosporium strains was succesfully carried out at SO ^g/ml. This was also the selection level used for T. reesei thus showing that differential selection can be easily achieved in Chrysosporium, The same comments are valid for transformed stmins with hygromycin resistance at a level of ISO )xg/ml.<br><br>
The protoplast transformation technique was used on Chrysosporium based on the most generally applied fungal transformation technology. All spores from one 90mm PDA plate were recovered in 8ml ICl and transferred into a shake flask of SOml ICl medium for incubation for IS hours at 35*^C and 200 rpm. After this the culture was centrifuged, the pellet was washed in MnP, brought back into solution in 10ml MnP and lOmg/ml Cayiase C3 and incubated for 30 minutes at 35°C with agitation (150 rpm).<br><br>
The solution was filtered and the filtrate was subjected to centrifiigation for 10 minutes at 3500 rpm. The pellet was washed with 10 ml MnPCa^"*. This was centrifuged for 10 minute at 2S'&gt;C. Then SO microlitres of cold MFC was added. The mixture was kept on ice for 30 minutes whereupon 2»S mi PMC was added. After IS minutes at room temperature 500 microlitres of the treated protoplasts were mixed to 3 ml of MnR Soft and immediately plated out on a MnR plate containing phleomycin or hygromycin as selection agent. After incubation for five days at 30^C transformants were analysed (clones become visible after 48 hours). Transformation efficiency was determined using 10 microgrammes of reference plasmid pAN8-I^^ The results are presented in the following Table D.<br><br>
The results show that the Chrysosporium transformants viability is superior to that of Trichoderma. The transformability of the strains is comparable and thus the number of transformants obtained in one experiment lies 4 times higher for Chrysosporium than for T reeseL Thus the Chrysosporium transformation system not only equals the commonly used T. reesei system, but even outperforms it. This improvement can prove especially useful for vectors that are less transformation efficient than pAN8-l. Examples of such less efficient transformation vectors are protein carrier vectors for production of non-fungal proteins which generally yield 10 times fewer transformants.<br>
A number of other transformation and expression vectors were constructed with homologous Chrysosporium protein encoding sequences and also with heterologous protein encoding sequences for use in transformation experiments with Chrysosporium, The vector maps are provided in the figures 6-11.<br>
The homologous protein to be expressed was selected from the group of cellulases produced by Chrysosporium and consisted of endoglucanase 6 which belongs to family 6 (MW 43 kDa) and the heterologous protein was endoglucanase 3 which belongs to family 12 (MW 25 kDa) of Pemciilium,<br>
pF6g comprises Chrysosporium endoglucanase 6 promoter fragment linked to endoglucanase 6 signal sequence in frame with the endoglucanase 6 open reading frame followed by the endoglucanase 6 terminator sequence. Transformant selection is carried out by using cotransformation<br><br>
with a selectable vector.<br>

pUTllS2 comprises Aspergillus nidulans glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase A promoter linked to endoglucanase 6 signal sequence in frame with the endoglucanase 6 open reading frame followed by the A. nidulans anthranilate synthase (trpC) terminator sequence. In addition this vector carries a second expression cassette with a selection marker i.e. the phleomycin resistance gene (Sh-ble gene).<br>
pUTllSS comprises A. nidulans glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase A promoter linked to Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase signal sequence in frame with the carrier protein Sh-ble which in turn is linked in frame to the endoglucanase 6 open reading frame followed by the A. nidulans trpC terminator sequence. This vector uses the technology of the carrier protein fused to the protein of interest which is known to very much improve the secretion of the protein of interest<br>
plJT1160 comprises Aspergillus nidulans glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase A promoter linked to Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase signal sequence in frame widi the carrier protein Sh-ble which in turn is linked in frrune to the endoglucanase 3 open reading frame of Penicillium followed by the A. nidulans trpC terminator sequence.<br>
pUTI162 comprises Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase promoter linked to endoglucanase 3 signal sequence in frame with the endoglucanase 3 open reading frame of Penicillium followed by the T. reesei cellobiohydrolase terminator sequence. In addition this vector carries a second expression cassette with a selection marker i.e. the phleomycin resistance gene (Sh-ble gene).<br><br><br>

CI protoplasts were transformed according to Durand et al. ^ adapted to CI (media &amp; solutions composition is given elsewhere): All spores from one 90mm PDA plate of untransformed CI strain were recovered in 8ml ICI and transferred into a shake flask with SOml ICl medium for incubation 15 hours at 35^C and 150 rpm. Thereupon, the culture was spun down, the pellet washed in NfnP, resolved in 10ml MnP + lOrag/ml Caylase C3, and incubated 30 min at 35°C with agitation (150 rpm). The solution was filtrated and the filtrate was centrifiiged 10 min at 3500 rpm. The pellet was washed with 10ml MnPCa^"^. This was spun down lOmin at 3500 rpm and the pellet was taken up into 1ml MnPCa^ 10^g of pUT720 DNA were added to 200^1 of protoplast solution and incubated lOmin at room temperature ("20«*C). Then, SOjil of cold MFC was added. The mixture was kept on ice for 30min whereupon 2.5ml PMC was added. After 15min at room temperature 500^1 of the treated protoplasts were mixed to 3ml of MnR Soft and immediately plated out on a MnR plate containing phleomycin (50ng/ml at pH6.5) as selection agent. After 5 days incubation at 30°C, transformants were analysed (clones start to be visible after 48 hours).<br>
The Sh ble production of CI transformants (phleomycin-resistant clones) was analysed as<br><br>
follows: Primary transformants were toodipicked to GS+phleomycin (SyLg/ml) plates and grown for S days at 32^ for resistance verification. Each validated resistant clone was subcloned onto GS plates. Two subclones per transformant were used to inoculate PDA plates in order to get spores for liquid culture initiation. The liquid cultures in ICl were grown 5 days at IT'^C (shaking 200 rpm). Then, die cultures were centrifuged (SOOOg, lOmin.) and SOO^l of supernatant were collected. From these samples, the proteins were precipitated with TCA and resuspended in Western Sample Buffer to 4 mg/mi of total proteins (Lowry Method ^. 10^1 (about 40(ig of total proteins) were loaded on a 12% acrylamide/SDS gel and run (BioRad Mini Trans-Blot system).

ISOLATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF CI PROTEINS<br>
The process for obtaining various proteins is described as are a number of characteristics of the proteins. The tables A, B and J provide details of purification scheme and activities. Isolation occurs from the Chysosporium culture filtrate using DEAE-Toyopearl ion exchange chromatography analogously to the method described in WO 98/15633, which is incorporated herein by reference. The non-bound fraction (F 60-31 CF) obtained from this chromatography was purified using Macro Prep Q ion exchange chromatography after equilibration to pH 7,6. The non-bound fraction (NBNB) was pooled and bound proteins were eluted in 0-1 M NaCl gradient. The NBNB fraction provided major protein bands of 19, 30, 3 S and 46 kD and a minor one of 51 kD. In 0-1 M NaCl gradient protein peaks were eluted from various fractions. 39-41 included 28, 36 and 60 kD proteins, 44-48 included<br><br>
28, 45 and 66 kD as major protein bands with 33, 36, SS, 60 and 67 kD proteins, the 49-SI fraction gave 30,36, 56 and 68 kD proteins and the 52-59 fraction included major 33 and 55 kD proteins and minor 28 and 36 kD proteins. The pooled NBNB fraction was fiuther purified by hydrophobic chromatography on Phenyl Superose. The NBNB fraction was equilibrated with 0,03M Na-phos{rfiate buffer pH 7,0 containmg 1,2 M <nh4 and applied to a column. adsorbed proteins were eluted in m gradient. thus homogeneous xylanase with mw kd pi respectively obtained as was protease></nh4>
The xylanases did not possess MUF cellobiase activity and are thus true xylanases. The alkaline 30 kD xylanase (pi 9.1) possessed high activity within a very broad pH range from 5-8 maintaining 65% of maximum activity at pH 9-10; it is a member of the xylanase F family; its partial nucleotide and amino acid sequences are depicted in SEQ ID No. 5. The partial amino acid sequence depicted corresponds to about amino acids 50-170 from die N terminus of the mature protein. Xylanases according to invention have at least 60%, preferably at least 70%, most preferably at least 80% sequence identity of the partial amino acid s^uence of SEQ ID No. 5. The corresponding xylanase promoter, which is a preferred embodiment of the invention, can be identified using the partial nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID No. 5. The 51 kD xylanase (pi 8,7) possessed maximum activity at pH 6 and retained at least 70% of its activity at pH 7,5 and it retained at least 50% of its activity at pH 8,0. It was not very stable with only 15% activity at pH 5,5 and 4% at pH 7,5. The Michaelis constant toward birch xylan was 4,2 g/1 for 30kD xylanase and 3,4 g/l for 51 kD xylanase. Temperature optimum was high and equal to 70^C for both xylanases.<br>
The 30 kD protease activity measured towards proteins of the NBNB fraction appeared to be equal to 0,4 x IO.3 units/ml at 50*^C and pH 7,90 kD. The fraction exhibited activity toward dyed casein of 0,4 art)itrary units/mg (pH 7). Addition of urea as chaotropic agent resulted in 2-3 times increase of protease activity. The effect of the protease on xylanase activity was significant. Only 30% xylanase activity remained at pH 10,3 and SO^'C after 30 minutes of incubation. At pH 8 95% of the xylanase activity remained. LAS addition resulted in a dramatic decrease of xylanase activity at pH 8 and 10,3 with only 50% xylanase activity after 10 minutes of incubation with or without protease inhibitor PMSF. The 30 kD protease was alkaline with pH optimum at pH 10-11. The activity is inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and not by iodoacetic acid, pepstatin A and EDTA which characterises it as a serine type protease. The protease is not active towards CI proteins at neutral pH and 50*=*C without chaotropic agents. Increase of pH and the addition of chaotropic agents such as LAS, SDS and urea significantly increase proteolysis.<br>
The 39-41 fraction was purified by hydrophobic chromatography on plenol superose. Fractions were equilibrated with 0,03M Na phosphate buffer pH 7,2 containing 1,5 M (NH4)2S04 and applied to a column. Adsorbed proteins were eluted in 1,5-0 M (NH4)2S04 gradient. Thus homogenous xylanase with MW 60 kD and pi 4,7 was obtained. This xylanase possessed activities<br><br>
towards xylan, MUF-cellobioside, MUF-^^loside and MUF-lactoside, This xylanase probabty belongs to &amp;mi]y 10 (family F). Ibis xylanase was stable at pH frcmi 5 to 8 during 24 boins and regained more ±m 80% activity at SO^'C. It retained 70% activit/ at pH S-7 at SO^'C. It kept 80% activity during S horns and 35% during 24 hours at 50^ and pH 9. At pH 10 60% activity was retained at 50^ and 0,5 hours of incubation. After 5 hours of incubation at pH 8 and 60K: 45% activity was found decreasing to 0 afier 24 hours. It had a pH optimum within the pH range of 6-7 and kept 70% activity at pH 9 and 50% of its activity at pH 9,5. The Michaeiis constant toward birch ^lan was 0,5 gA. Temperature optimum was hi^ and equal to 80^C.<br>
Fraction 4448 was Iben purified by chromatofocusing on Mono P. A pH gradient fix)m 7,63-5,96 was used for the elution of the proteins. As a result 45 kD endoglucanase was isolated wiA a pi of 6. The 45 kD endo had maximum activity at pH 5 toward CMC and at pH 5-7 toward BBB-CMC. The 45 kD endo retained 70% of its maximal activhy toward CMC at pH 6,5 and 70% of its maximal activity toward RBB-CMC was retained at pH 7,0; 50% of its maximal activity toward CMC was retained at pH 7 and 50% of its maximal activity toward RBB-CMC was retained at pH 8. The Michaeiis constant toward CMC was 4,8 g/I. T^oaperature optimum was hi^ and equal to SO^'C. Other proteins 28,33,36,55,60 and 66 kD were eluled mixed togedier.<br>
Fraction 52-58 was purified by chromatofocusing on Mono P too widi a pH gradient 7,6-4,5. Individual 55 kD endoglucanase widi pi 4,9 was obtained Hie 55 kD eodo was neutral It has a broad pH optimum from 4&gt;6 and 70% activity was retained at pH 7,0 both for CMC and RBB-CMC and 50% activity was retained at pH 8 for both CMC and RBB-CMC. Tbe Midiaelis constant towaxd CMC was 1 gA. Temperature optimum was hi^ and equal to 80°C. A number of fractions also held proteins with MW of 28,33 and 36 kD,<br>
45, 48 and 100 kD proteins were isolated firom bound DEAE Toyopearl fraction of F 60-S UF cone of Chysosporium culture fix&gt;m fractions 50-53 using Macro Prep Q chromatography.<br>
Fraction 50-53 was equilibrated witii 0.03 M imidazole HCL buffer, pH 5.75 and was applied to a column and tiie adsoibed proteins were eluted in 0,1-0,25 MNaCl gradi^ for 4 h. As a result 45 kD (pi 4.2), 48 kD (pi 4.4) and 100 kD (pi 4.5) proteins were isolated in homogenous states (figure 17).<br>
The 45 kD is supposedly a alpha beta-galactosidase by virtue of its activity toward p-nitrophenyl alpha-galactoside and p-nitrophenyl beta-galactoside. The pH optimum was 4,5 70% activity was maintained at pH 5,7 and 50% of its activity was retained at pH 6,8. The traaperature optimum was 60°C (figure 18).<br>
The 48 kD protein was a cellobiohydrolase having high activity toward p-nitrophenyl beta-glucoside and also activities toward MUF cellobioside, MUF lactoside and p-nitrophenyl bu^te. The 48 kD protein had a pH optimum of 5 toward CMC and 5-6 toward RBB-CMC (figure 19).<br>
The 100 kD protein with pi 4,5 possessed activity onfy toward p-nitrophenyl butyrate. It is<br><br>
probably an esterase but i$ not a feruloyl esta:ase as it had no activity ^gainst meOryl ester of tC (figfs 20» 21).<br>
The 90 kD protease wifti pi 4,2 was isolated firm the boand fiaction and the activity measured towards proteins of the NBMB fiaction q)peared to be equal to 12 x 10^ unitsM at SV*C and pH 7,90 kD. Tlie fraction exhibited activity toward dyed casein of 0,01 arbitrary unitsAng (pH 7). Addition of urea as chaotropic agent resulted in 2-3 fold increase of protease activity as did addition of IAS at both pH 7 and 9 (50^). The 90 kD protease was neutral with pH optimum at pH 8. The activity is inhibited by phenybneOiylsulfonyl fluoride ^&gt;MSF) and not by iodoacetic acid, pqsstatin A and EDTA ^^ch characterises it as a smne type protease.<br>
Also isolated from the bound fraction were 43 kD endoglucanase with pi A2 (fraction 33-37) and 2S kD ^idoglucanase with pi 4.1 (fraction 39-43). 55 kD cellobiol^drolase with pi 4.9 (fraction 39-43) and 65 kD polygalacturonase with pi 4.4 (fraction 39-43). The endoglucanases did not possess activity towards avicel or MUF cellobioside and possessed hig^ activity toward MC, RBB-CMC, CMC41, beta-glucan and mdoglucanase. The 25 iD endo did not produce ^ucose from CMC and tiie 43 kD endo did. No glucose was formed Scam aviceL The pH optimum for die 43 Id) protein was 4,5 witii 70% maximum activity maintained at pH 72 and 50% atpH 8. The 43 kD endo kspt 70% activity at pH 5 and 6 durii% 25 hours of incubation. Jt kept only 10% at pH 7 during tiiis incubation period. The 25 kD endo had pH optimum of a^ivity at pH 5 toward CMC and broad pH optimum of activity toward RBB-CMC with 70% of the maximum activity being kept at pH 9 and with 50% of the maximum activity being at pH 10. It kept 100% activity at pH 5 and 6 and 80% at pH 7, 8, 8.6 and 9.6 during 120 hours of incubation. The 25 kD endo had a temperature c^timum of activity at 70°C. The 43 kD endo had a t^nperatuie optimum of activity at 60^C. The Michaelis constants towards CMC were 62 and 12,7 ^ for 25 and 43 kD mdo respectively. The polygalacturonase is a pectinase. The Michaelis constant toward PGA was 3.8 g/l. The pH optimum of PGU activity is wifliin pH range 5-7 and T optimum within 50-65«'C.<br>
Genes encoding C lucknawense protems v/cxt obtained using PCR and characterised by sequence analysis. The corresponding frill genes were obtained by screening (partial) gene libraries using the isolated PCR fragments. The full gene of die 43 kD endoglucanase (EG6, Family 6) of the CI sixain has been cloned, sequenced and analysed (includmg 2.5 kb promote region and 0.5 kb terminator region). Its nucleotide and amino acid sequences are depicted in SEQ ID No. 1. Predicted molecular weight of die mature protein is 39,427 Da and predicted pi is 4.53, which values correspond well with the measured values. Protein alignment analysis with other glycosyl hydrolases of die family 6.2 shows that C1-EG6 does not include a cellulose-buiding domain (CBD) Homology analysis using SwissProt SAMBA software (Smith &amp; Waterman algorithm, Gap penalty 12/2, alignment 10, Blosum62 matrix) shows that C1-EG6 has 51.6% identity with Fusarium oxysporum EG-B (over 376 amino acids), 51.0% identity witii Agaricus bisporus CBH3 (over 353 amino acids), and 50.7%<br><br>
identity wi&amp; Trichoderma reesei CBH2 (over 367 amino acids). Hie putative signal sequmce nms Met 1 to Arg 28. The promoter ccmtains several potential CreA binding sites, so it is v^ likefy that this i»x)moter would be subject to glucose repression in a fim^<br>
Similarly, fte full gene of the 25 kD endogiucanase (EG5, Family 45) of the CI strain has be« cloned, sequenced and analysed (includmg 33 kb promoter region and 0.7 kb terminator region). Hie nucleotide and amino acid sequences are depicted in S£Q ID No. 2. Predicted molecular weig}it of tiie mature protein is 21,858 Da and predicted pi is 4.66, which values correspond well with &amp;e measured values. This is the smallest fungal endogiucanase known to date. Protein alignment analysis with odier gfycosyl hydrolases of tiie fiunily 45 shows that C1-EG5 does not include a cellulose-bindmg domain (CBD), nor a cobesin/dockerin domain. Homology analysis using NCBI-BIASTP2 software (Gap penalty 11/1, alignment 10, Blosum62 matrix) shows that die closest homologous protein to C1-EG5 is Fysarhan oxysporum EG-K with 63% identity. The putative signal sequence runs M^ 1 to Ala 18. The promote contains many potential CieA bmding sites, so it is very likely diat this promoter would be subject to glucose repression ta a fungal strain widi working CreA<br>
regulation.<br>
Furdiennore, an additional endogiucanase was found by PCR based on fEonily 12 cellulases homology analysis. The partial nucleotide and amino acid sequence of tiiis additional mdogjucanase (EG3, Family 12) is given in SEQ ID No. 3.<br>
The S51d&gt; protem was a cellobiohydrolase (referred to herein as CBHl) with activity gainst MUF-cellobioside, MUF lactoside, FP and avicel, also t^ainst p-nitrophenyl p*glucoside, cellobiose<br>
and p-nitropbenyl lactoside. Its activity toward MUF cellobioside is inhibited by cellobiose. Ibe<br>
inhibition constant 0,4 mM was determined. Tbe Michaelis constant toward MUF cellobioside was<br>
0,14 mM, toward MUF lactoside was 4 mM and toward CMC was 3,6 ^ The pH optimum is radier<br>
broad from 4,5 to 7. 50% of maximum activity toward CMC and 80% activity toward RBB«CMC is<br>
kept at pH 8. 70-80% activity withm pH 5-8 is kept during 25 hours of incubation. The temperature<br>
optimum is 60-70^C. CBHI is probably a member of the cellobiohydrolase &amp;mily 7; its partial<br>
nucleotide and amino acid sequences are depicted in SEQ ID No. 4. The partial ammo acid sequence<br>
depicted corresponds to about amino acids 300-450 from the N terminus of the mature protein. A<br>
cellobiohydrolase according to the invention has at least 60%, preferably at least 70%, most<br>
preferably at least 80% sequence identity of the partial amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 4. The<br>
corresponding CBH promoter, which is a preferred embodiment of the invention, can be idwitified<br>
using the partial nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID No. 4. A synergistic effect was obsMved between 25<br>
kD endo and 55 kD CBH during avicel hydrolysis. Synergism coefficient was maximal at the ratio of<br>
25    kD    endo    to    55    kD    CBH    80:20.    The    Ksyn    was    1,3    at    its    maximum.<br><br><br><br>
The expression level of five main Chfysosporbm genes was studied by Northern analysis. Various strains of C. lucknoweme were grown in rich medhim contaming phamiedia with ceUulose and lactose (medium 1) or rich medium containing phaimedia and glucose (medium 2) at 33 *C. After 48 h, mycelium was harvested and RNA was isolated. The RNA was trybridised wiOi 5 differokt probes: EGS, £G6, EG3, XylF and CBH. After ^qiosure, the Northern blots were strqiped and hybridised again with a probe for ribosomal L3 as a cmtrol foe fte amount of mRNA on the blot ^fost strains showed very high response for CBH and hi^ response for XylF in medium 1; m medi 2, half of tiie strain showed higjh response for all gcmes, and ^ other half showed low response. The order of expression strength vm deducted from these data as CBH &gt; XylF &gt; EG5 &gt; EG3 &gt; EG6. Tables A, B and J illustrate tiie details of the above.<br>
