AS ORIGINALLY FILED<br>
Mesoporous metal-organic framework<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a porous metal-organic framework and a process for preparing it and its use.<br>
Porous metal-organic frameworks are known in the prior art.<br>
They typically comprise at least one at least bidentate organic compound coordinated to at least one metal ion. Such metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are described, for example, in US-A 5,648,508, EP-A 0 790 253, M.O. Keefe, J. Sol. State Chem. 152 (2000). 3-20; H. Li et al., Nature 402 (1999), 276; M. Eddaoudi, Topics in Catalysis 9 (1999), 105-111; B. Chen et al., Science 291 (2001), 1021-1023, and DE-A 101 11 230.<br>
The metal-organic frameworks studied in the prior art have a variety of uses. They can be used, for example, for storage, separation or chemical reaction of substances. In particular, they can be used as supports for catalysts or catalysts.<br>
In the search for further applications or to improve the properties of such metal-organic frameworks, numerous combinations of metal ions and at least bidentate organic compounds have been tested. Recently, metal-organic frameworks in which the metal ion is a main group element of the Periodic Table have also come under consideration.<br>
T. Loiseau et al., Chem. Eur. J. 10 (2004), 1373-1382, describe, for example, porous aluminum terephthalate. However, this has pores of comparably small size. This is in a range as is also known and customary for other metal-organic frameworks based on other metals such as zinc. This is particularly disadvantageous for reactions in which comparatively large-volume reactants are reacted in a diffusion-limited reaction.<br><br>
Z.-Z. Lin et al., Eur. J. Inorg. Chem, 2005, 77-81, describe a framework based on ln'"-BTC (BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid). However, the framework obtained in this way has poor absorption properties, if any. This is particularly disadvantageous for applications in the field of separation or storage of compounds, in particular gases.<br>
There is therefore a continuing need for the provision of new metal-organic frameworks which have at least partly superior properties compared to the frameworks known in the prior art.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a porous metal-organic framework which has the properties indicated above.<br>
This object is achieved by a porous metal-organic framework comprising at least one at least bidentate organic compound coordinated to at least one metal ion, wherein the at least one metal ion is Al'" and the at least one at least bidentate organic compound is a six-membered aromatic hydrocarbon ring A in which one or more ring carbons may be replaced by nitrogen and which has three substituents X and optionally one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of R, NRR', OR, SR, F, CI and Br, where R, R' are each, independently of one another, hydrogen, methyl which may optionally be substituted by one or more fluorine atoms or ethyl which may optionally be substituted by one or more fluorine atoms and each X is, independently of the others, C(=0)0", C(=S)0', C(=0)S', C(=S)S" or a protonated form thereof.<br>
It has been found that frameworks as described above have a comparatively high proportion of large-volume pores (mesopores) and likewise have comparatively high specific surface areas, which leads to advantages in the applications described below. This is particularly surprising since these properties are not retained when aluminum is replaced by its analogue indium in the same group of the Periodic Table or an organic compound substituted by only two groups X is used in place of the organic compound substituted by three groups X for building up a metal-organic framework. This is particularly true when the organic compound is a benzenetricarboxylate.<br><br>
In addition, the X-ray diffraction patterns of the framework of the Invention barely display the sharp signals in the range from 5 to 30° (2 9), in particular from 5 to 12°, characteristic of the abovementioned frameworks known from the prior art.<br>
The metal-organic framework comprises at least one at least bidentate organic compound which is a six-membered aromatic hydrocarbon ring A in which one or more ring carbons may be replaced by nitrogen and which has three substituents X and optk&gt;nally one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of R, NRR', OR, SR, F, CI and Br, where R, R' are each, independently of one another, hydrogen, methyl which may optionally be substituted by one or more fluorine atoms or ethyl which may optionally be substituted by one or more fluorine atoms and each X is. independently of the others, C(=0)0", C(=S)0". C(=0)S', C(=S)S" or a protonated form thereof. Further organic compounds, in particular one or more monodentate ligands, may also occur in the framework. However, preference is given to the mole fraction of the first-mentioned organic compound which has to be present in at least 50%, more preferably at least 75% and particularly preferably at least 90%, of the total amount of the organic compounds in the framework.<br>
The ring A is preferably a benzene, pyridine, pyridazine, pyrimidine, pyrazine or triazine ring. A is particularly preferably benzene.<br>
Furthermore, the ring A has three substituents X. These are carboxylate groups and/or their thio analogues. At least part of the carboxylate groups and/or thio analogues occurring on A in the framework can be present in protonated form.<br>
In addition, the ring A can have one or more further substituents. These are the functional groups R, NRR', OR, SR, F. CI and Br, where R and R' can each be, independently of one another, hydrogen, methyl or ethyl. The methyl and ethyl groups can also be monofluorinated or polyfluorinated. However, the ring A preferably has no further substituents apart from X.<br>
The organic compound is particularly preferably 1,2,3-, 1,2,4- or 1,3,5-benzene-tricarboxylate or an at least partially protonated analogue thereof. Very particular<br><br>
preference is given to 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate.<br>
The metal-organic framework of the invention comprises pores, in particular micropores and/or mesopores. Micropores are defined as pores having a diameter of 2 nm or less and mesopores are defined by a diameter in the range from 2 to 50 nm, in each case in accordance with the definition given in Pure Applied Chemistry 57 (1985), pages 603 - 619, in particular on page 606. The presence of micropores and/or mesopores can be checked by means of sorption measurements, with these measurements deternining the uptake capacity for nitrogen of the metal-organic frameworks at 77 K in accordance with DIN 66131 and/or DIN 66134.<br>
The metal-organic framework of the invention preferably has an average pore diameter of from 2 to 10 nm, particularly preferably from 3 to 9 nm. Particular preference is given to the dispersion of the pore sizes being not more than +/-5 nm. Furthermore, the most frequently occurring pore diameter is preferably in a range from 3 to 9 nm.<br>
The specific surface area, calculated according to the Langmuir model in accordance with DIN 66135 (DIN 66131, 66134), of a metal-organic framework according to the invention in powder form is preferably at least 800 m2/g. The specific surface area is more preferably at least 1000 m2/g and particularly preferably at least 1300 m2/g. The specific surface area is very particularly preferably at least 1500 m2/g.<br>
Preference is given to at least 50% of the pore volume being formed by pores having a pore diameter of from 2 to 10 nm (mesopores). The proportion of the pore volume Is preferably at least 65%, very particularly preferably at least 80%. The pore volume is preferably at least 0.8 ml/g, more preferably at least 1.1 ml/g.<br>
Shaped MOF bodies can have a low specific surface area. However, this is preferably more than 10 m2/g, more preferably more than 50 m2/g and even more preferably more than 500 m2/g.<br>
Apart from the above-described pores, a shaped body comprising the metal-<br><br>
organic framework of the invention also has larger pores whose size distribution can vary. However, preference is given to more than 50% of the total pore volume, in particular more than 75%, being made up by pores having a pore diameter of up to 1000 nm. However, a large part of the pore volume is preferably formed by pores from two diameter ranges. Further preference is therefore given to more than 25% of the total pore volume, in particular more than 50% of the total pore volume, being fomned by pores which are in a diameter range of from 100 nm to 800 nm and more than 15% of the total pore volume, in particular more than 25% of the tc^l pore volume, being fomied by pores in a diameter range up to 10 nm. The pore distribution can be determined by means of mercury porosimetry.<br>
The present invention further provides a process for preparing a framework according to the invention, which comprises the step<br>
reaction of at least one metal compound with at least one at least bidentate organic compound which can coordinate to the metal ion, wherein the metal is Al'" and the at least one at least bidentate organic compound is a six-membered aromatic hydrocarbon ring A in which one or more ring carbons may be replaced by nitrogen and which has three substituents X and optionally one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of R, NRR', OR, SR, F, CI and Br, where R, R' are each, independently of one another, hydrogen, methyl which may optionally be substituted by one or more fluorine atoms or ethyl which may optionally be substituted by one or more fluorine atoms and each X is, independently of the others, C(=0)0', C(=S)0", C(=0)S', C(=S)S* or a protonated form thereof.<br>
The reaction preferably takes place in a nonaqueous organic solvent while stirring at a pressure of not more than 2 bar (absolute).<br>
The pressure is more preferably not more than 1230 mbar (absolute). Even more preferably, the reaction takes place under atmospheric pressure.<br>
The metal-organic framework of the invention can also be prepared in water as solvent with addition of a base.<br><br>
However, the use of a nonaqueous organic solvent makes it possible to dispense with the base. It is, however, likewise possible to add a base. The organic solvent itself can also serve as base.<br>
Preferred starting materials when using an aluminum salt in the synthesis are the hydrates of aluminum chbride or nitrate, particularly preferably the chloride.<br>
Furthermore, the metal compound used for preparing the porous metal-organic framework of the invention can preferably be nonionic and/or the counterion to the Al'" cation can be derived from a protic solvent. The use of an appropriately chosen nonionic compound makes it possible to avoid the presence of the metal in the form of a salt in the reaction to fomi the porous metal-organic framework and may thus make it possible to avoid any difficulties in the removal of the corresponding anion of the metal salt, as long as no further interfering salts are produced from the metal compound in the reaction. If the counterion is a solvent anion, this can, when chosen appropriately, be present after the reaction as solvent, which may be identical to or different from the nonaqueous organic solvent used. In the latter case, preference is given to this solvent being at least partially miscible with the nonaqueous organic solvent.<br>
Nonionic compounds or counterions to the metal cation which can be derived from protic solvents can be, for example, metal alkoxides, for example methoxides, ethoxides, propoxides, butoxides. Oxides or hydroxides are likewise conceivable.<br>
The nonaqueous organic solvent is preferably a C1-6-alkanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N-diethylformamide (DEF), acetonitrlle, toluene, dioxane, benzene, chlorobenzene, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), pyridine, tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethyl acetate, optionally halogenated C1-200-alkane, sulfolane, glycol, N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), y-butyrolactone, alicyclic alcohols such as cyctohexanol, ketones such as acetone or acetylacetone, cyclic ketones such as cyclohexanone, sulfolene or a mixture thereof.<br>
A C1-6-alkanol is an alkanol having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples are<br><br>
methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, i-propanol, n-butanol, i-butanol, t-butanol, pentanol, hexanol and mixtures thereof.<br>
An optionally halogenated C1-200-alkane is an alkane which has from 1 to 200 carbon atoms and in which one or more to all hydrogen atoms may be replaced by halogen, preferably chlorine or fluorine, in particular chlorine. Examples are chlorofomn, dichloromethane, tetrachloromethane, dichloroethane, hexane, heptane, octane and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferred solvents are DMF, DEF and NMP. Particular preference is given to DMF.<br>
The tenri "nonaqueous" preferably refers to a solvent which has a maximum water content of 10% by weight, more preferably 5% by weight, even more preferably 1% by weight, still more preferably 0.1% by weight, particularly preferably 0.01% by weight, based on the total weight of the solvent.<br>
The maximum water content during the reaction is preferably 10% by weight, more preferably 5% by weight and even more preferably 1 % by weight.<br>
The term "solvenf encompasses both pure solvents and mixtures of different solvents.<br>
Furthermore, the process step of reaction of the at least one metal compound with the at least one at least bidentate organic compound is preferably followed by a calcination step. The temperature set here is typically above 250°C, preferably from 300 to 400°C.<br>
The calcination step can remove the ligand present in the pores.<br>
In addition or as an alternative thereto, the removal of ligand from the pores of the porous metal-organic framework can be effected by treatment of the framework formed with a nonaqueous solvent. Here, the ligand is removed in the manner of an "extraction process" and, if appropriate, replaced in the framework by a solvent molecule. The extraction process preferably takes place before a calcination, if the<br><br>
latter is provided.<br>
The treatment is preferably carried out for at least 30 minutes and can typically be carried out for up to two days. This can occur at room temperature or at elevated temperature. It is preferably carried out at elevated temperature, for example at at least 40°C, preferably 60°C. Further preference is given to a reaction at the boiling point of the solvent (reflux).<br>
The treatment can be carried out in a simple vessel by slurrying and stirring the framework. It is also possible to use extraction apparatuses such as Soxlet apparatuses, in particular industrial extraction apparatuses.<br>
Suitable solvents are those mentioned above, i.e. C1-6-alkanol, DMSO, DMF, DEF, acetonitrile, toluene, dioxane, benzene, chlorobenzene, MEK, pyridine, THF, ethyl acetate, optionally halogenated C1-200-alkane, sulfolene, glycol, NMP or mixtures thereof.<br>
The solvent used for extraction can be identical to or different from that used for the reaction of the at least one metal compound with the at least one at least bidentate organic compound. In particular, it is not absolutely necessary that the solvent used in the extraction is water-free.<br>
A preferred extractant is methanol, ethanol, acetone. MEK or a mixture thereof. Particular preference is given to methanol.<br>
The present invention further provides a process for preparing the metal-organic framework of the invention, in which Al'" is made available for the reaction by means of anodic oxidation.<br>
The preparation of metal-organic frameworks by an electrochemical route is described in WO-A 2005/049892.<br>
The metal-organic framework of the invention can be present in powder form or as agglomerate. The framework can be used as such or it is converted into a shaped body. Preferred processes here are extrusion or tableting. In the production of<br><br>
t<br>
shaped bodies, the framework can comprise further materials such as binders, lubricants or other additives which are added during production. It is likewise conceivable for the framework to comprise further constituents, for example adsorbents such as activated carbon or the like.<br>
The possible geometries of these shaped bodies are subject to essentially no restrictions. Examples are, inter alia, pellets such as disk-shaped pellets, pills, spheres, granules, extrudates such as rod extrudates, honeycombs, grids and hollow bodies.<br>
All suitable processes are in principle possible for producing these shaped bodies. In particular, the following processes are preferred:<br>
kneading/pan milling of the framework either alone or together with at least one binder and/or at least one pasting agent and/or at least one template compound to give a mixture; shaping of the resulting mixture by means of at least one suitable method, for example extrusion; optionally washing and/or drying and/or calcination of the extrudate; optionally finishing.<br>
Application of the framework to at least one optionally porous support material. The material obtained can then be processed further by the method described above to give a shaped body.<br>
Application of the framework to at least one optionally porous substrate.<br>
Kneading/pan milling and shaping can be carried out by any suitable method, as described, for example, in Ullmanns Enzyklopadie der Techntschen Chemte, 4th edition, Volume 2, p. 313 ff. (1972).<br>
For example, the kneading/pan milling and/or shaping can preferably be carried out by means of a piston press, roll press in the present or absence of at least one binder material, compounding, pelletization, tableting, extrusion, coextrusion, foaming, spinning, coating, granulation, preferably spray granulation, spraying, spray drying or a combination of two or more of these methods.<br><br>
Very particular preference is given to producing pellets and/or tablets.<br>
The kneading and/or shaping can be carried out at elevated temperatures, for example in the range from room temperature to 300°C, and/or at elevated pressure, for example in the range from atmospheric pressure to a few hundred bar, and/or in a protective gas atmosphere, for example in the presence of at least one noble gas, nitrogen or a mixture of two or more thereof.<br>
The kneading and/or shaping is, according to a further embodiment, carried out with addition of at least one binder, with the binder used being able in principle to be any chemical compound which ensures the desired viscosity for kneading and/or shaping the composition. Accordingly, binders can, for the purposes of the present invention, be either viscosity-increasing or viscosity-reducing compounds.<br>
Preferred binders include, for example, aluminum oxide or binders comprising aluminum oxide as described, for example, in WO 94/29408, silicon dioxide as described, for example, in EP 0 592 050 A1, mixtures of silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide as described, for example, in WO 94/13584, clay minerals as described, for example, in JP 03-037156 A, for example montmorillonite, kaolin, bentonite, hallosite, dickite, nacrite and anauxite, alkoxysilanes as described, for example, in EP 0102 544 B1, for example tetraalkoxysilanes such as tetramethoxysilane, tetraethoxysilane, tetrapropoxysilane, tetrabutoxysilane, and, for example, trialkoxysilanes such as trimethoxysilane, triethoxysilane, tripropoxysilane, tributoxysilane, alkoxytitanates, for example tetraalkoxytitanates such as tetramethoxytitanate, tetraethoxytitanate, tetrapropoxytitanate, tetrabutoxytitanate, and, for example, trialkoxytitanates such as trimethoxytitanate, triethoxytitanate, tripropoxytitanate, tributoxytitanate, alkoxyzirconates, for example tetraalkoxyzirconates such as tetramethoxyzlrconate, tetraethoxyzirconate, tetrapropoxyzirconate, tetrabutoxyzirconate, and, for example, trialkoxyzirconates such as trimethoxyzirconate, triethoxyzirconate, tripropoxyzirconate, tributoxyzirconate, silica sols, amphiphilic substances and/or graphites. Particular preference is given to graphite.<br>
As viscosity-increasing compound, it is also possible, for example, to use, if appropriate in addition to the abovementioned compounds, an organic compound<br><br>
and/or a hydrophilic polymer such as cellulose or a cellulose derivative such as methylcellulose and/or a polyacrylate and/or a polymethacrylate and/or a polyvinyl alcohol and/or a polyvinylpyrrolidone and/or a polyisobutene and/or a polytetrahydrofuran and/or a polyethylene oxide.<br>
As pasting agent, preference is given to using, inter alia, water or at least one alcohol, for example a monoalcohol having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, e.g. methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol or 2-methyl-2-propanoi, or a mixture of water and at least one of the alcohols mentioned or a monohydric alcohol such as a glycol, preferably a water-miscible polyhydric alcohol, either alone or as a mixture with water and/or at least one of the monohydric alcohols mentioned.<br>
Further additives which can be used for kneading and/or shaping are, inter alia, amines or amine derivatives such as tetraalkylammonium compounds or amino alcohols and carbonate-comprising compounds such as calcium carbonate. Such further additives are described, for instance, in EP 0 389 041 A1, EP 0 200 260 A1 or WO 95/19222,<br>
The order of addition of the additives such as template compound, binder, pasting agent, viscosity-increasing substance in shaping and kneading is in principle not critical.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the process of the invention, the shaped body obtained by kneading and/or shaping is subjected to at least one drying operation which is generally carried out a temperature in the range from 25 to 300°C, preferably in the range from 50 to 300°C and particularly preferably in the range from 100 to 300°C. It is likewise possible to carry out drying under reduced pressure or under a protective gas atmosphere or by spray drying.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, at least one of the compounds added as additives is at least partly removed from the shaped body during this drying operation.<br>
The present invention further provides for the use of the porous metal-organic<br><br>
framework of the invention for the uptake of at least one substance for the purposes of its storage, separation, controlled release or chemical reaction and also as support material, for example for metals, metal oxides, metal sulfides or other framework structures, and in catalysis.<br>
The at least one substance can be a gas or a liquid. The substance is preferably a gas.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the terms "gas" and "liquid" are used in the interests of simplicity, but gas mixtures and liquid mixtures or liquid solutions are likewise encompassed by the term "gas" or "liquid".<br>
Preferred gases are hydrogen, hydrocarbons, in particular methane, ethane, ethene, acetylene, propane, n-butane and i-butane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, oxygen, sulfur oxides, halogens, halogenated hydrocarbons, NF3, SFe, ammonia, boranes, phosphanes, hydrogen sulfide, amines, formaldehyde, noble gases, in particular helium, neon, argon, krypton and xenon.<br>
Particular preference is given to the use of a metal-organic framework according to the invention for the storage of hydrogen and for diffusion-limited reaction with large-volume reactants. Preference is also given to the storage of comparatively large substances which typically cannot be stored, or be stored only unsatisfactorily, in other metal-organic frameworks or other porous materials such as zeolites. Examples are dyes (pigments) or small proteins, e.g. enzymes.<br>
The abovementioned reactions can be hydrogenations, oxidations in the liquid phase, metathesis in the liquid phase, alkoxylations, etherifications, esterifications, alkylations, hydrolyses or comparable reactions. Typical large reactants in diffusion-limited reactions can be, for example, polyols, substituted benzenes, dyes or other compounds.<br>

Examples<br><br>
Example 1       Atmospheric-pressure preparatiori/characterization of an AI-BTC MOF<br>
7.8 g of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid and 22.9 g of AI(NO3)3*9H2O are suspended in 520.5 g of DMF in a glass flask and stirred under reflux at130°C for 4 days. After cooling, the solid is filtered off, washed with 2x100 ml of DMF and 4x100 ml of methanol and dried at 200°C in a vacuum drying oven for 16 hours. The sample is subsequently after-treated at 330°C in a muffle furnace (100 l/h of air) for 3 days (heating at about 75°C/h). 8.4 g of an AI-BTC MOF having a surface area of 1791 m2/g (determined using N2 by the Langmuir method) are obtained. The X-ray diffraction pattem (XRD) is shown in fig. 1. For all diffraction patterns, the sample is prepared unground under an N2 bell jar and coated with a Styroflex film to make it airtight. The diffraction pattem of the sample is recorded on a D5000 instrument from Siemens using a Cu anode at a step width of 0.02° and a step rate of 3.6 s. The diffraction pattern shows, untypically for MOFs, barely any reflections and has a very amorphous appearance. The pore distribution is shown in fig. 8. In fig. 8 the pore volume V (ml/g) is depicted as a function of the pore diameter d (nm). Here, the unusually high (for MOFs) proportion of mesopores is apparent.<br>
Example 2      Hydrothermal preparation/characterization of an AI-BTC MOF<br>
2.46 g of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid and 8.7 g of AI(NO3)3*9H2O are suspended in 33 ml of DMF. The mixture is heated at 170°C in a Berghoff autoclave (Teflon liner) for 1 day. After cooling, the solid is filtered off, washed with DMF and methanol and dried at 200°C in a vacuum drying oven for 5 hours. The sample is subsequently after-treated at 330°C in a muffle furnace (100 l/h of air) for 3 days (heating at about 75°C/h). 2.5 g of an AI-BTC MOF having a surface area of 1516 m2/g (determined using N2 by the Langmuir method) are obtained. The XRD is shown in fig. 2. The diffraction pattern shows, untypically for MOFs, barely any reflections and has a very amorphous appearance.<br>
Transmission electron micrographs (TEM) are shown in fig. 3 and fig. 4. These clearly show the presence of crystalline substructures.<br><br>
The transmission electron micrograph is recorded by admixing the sample with a little ethanol and rubbing it between 2 glass microscope slides. This is then spread out thinly and dabbed off with a specimen support grid to which a Formvar/carbon film has been applied. The micrographs were recorded using a 200 kV FEG TEM from FEI. Instrument designation: Tecnai G2.<br>
Example 3      Preparation/characterization of an Al-BTC MOF<br>
