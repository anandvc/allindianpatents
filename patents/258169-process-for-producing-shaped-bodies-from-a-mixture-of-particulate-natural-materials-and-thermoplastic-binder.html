Process for producing shaped bodies foci a mixture of particulate natural materials and thermoplastic binder<br>
The invention relates to a process for the production of mouldings from a mixture of particulate natural materials and thermoplastic binder  the mixture being shaped into a moulding with temperature and/or pressure increase.<br>
Natural fibres, in particular wood fibres, have recently increasingly been used in combination with thermoplastics for the production of wood plastic composites.  For this purpose, the wood fibres or wood flour are mixed with a thermoplastic binder and processed by means of extrusion to give mouldings. WO-A 96/34045 discloses a process for the production of mouldings, in which natural fibre materials are processed as a mixture with thermoplastics.  The preparation of plastic moulding materials by extrusion of a mixture of natural fibre and thermoplastic is also disclosed in WO-A 03/008494.  The proportion of natural fibres is introduced in the form of pellets bound with thermoplastic.<br>
These natural substances  which are present, for example, in the form of wood fibres, wood flour or woodchips contain a considerable amount of residual moisture in the air-dry state. Thermoplastics, such as polyolefins, polyvinyl chloride or ABS, are not capable of absorbing the water released during processing in an amount significant for the process.  In the thermoplastic processing, for example by means of extrusion, of mixtures of such natural substances and thermoplastics, the residual water present therefore leads to uncontrolled bubble formation in the mouldings, owing to the abrupt evaporation occurring at the processing temperatures.  This can take place to such an extent that the cohesion of such a moulding is no longer guaranteed.<br>
WO-A 03/035373 and WO-A 2004/090022 therefore propose additionally using a water-binding biopolymer, starch or protein in the production of mouldings from natural fibre and<br><br>
thermoplastic.  A disadvantage thereby is that the mixture also comprises a third component in addition to the natural fibre and the thermoplastic binder, and the strength of the moulding is reduced.<br>
It was therefore the object to provide a process for the production of mouldings from natural fibre material and thermoplastic binder, which leads to mouldings having a high mechanical strength, and in which no additional process steps are required for removing the residual water or no additives are required for binding residual water.<br>
The invention relates to a process for the production of mouldings from a mixture of particulate natural materials and thermoplastic binder, the mixture being shaped into a moulding with temperature and/or pressure increase, characterized in that the thermoplastic binder is used in the form of a polymer powder composition redispersible in water, containing one or more polymers, one or more protective colloids and optionally ant blocking agent.<br>
Suitable particulate natural materials are, for example, wood fibres, wood flour and woodchips.  Vegetable natural materials, such as cotton fibres, jute fibres, sisal fibres, hemp fibres, flax fibres and wood fibres and wood flour, are preferred.  The proportion of the natural materials in the mixture to be processed by a thermoplastic method is 20 to 98% by weight, preferably 50 to 80% by weight, based in each case on   the total weight of the mixture.<br>
Polymer powders redispersible in water are designated as powder composition which are obtainable by means  of drying of the corresponding aqueous dispersions for the base polymers in the presence of protective colloids.  On the basis of this preparation process, the finely divided resin of the dispersion is surrounded by a sufficient amount of a water-soluble protective colloid.  During the drying, the protective colloid acts as a jacket which prevents the particles from<br><br>
sticking together.  On redispersion in water, the protective colloid dissolves again in water and an aqueous dispersion of the original polymer particles is produced (Schulze J. in TIZ, No. 9, 1985).<br>
Suitable polymers are those based on one or more monomers from the group consisting of vinyl esters, (meth)acrylates, vinylaromatics, olefins, 1,3-dienes and vinyl halides and optionally further monomers copolymerizable therewith.<br>
Suitable vinyl esters are those of carboxylic acids having 1 to 12 C atoms.  Vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl butyrate, vinyl 2-ethylhexanoate, vinyl laurate, 1-methylvinyl acetate, vinyl pivalate and vinyl esters of a-branched monocarboxylic acids having 9 to 11 C atoms, for example VeoVa9'* or VeoValOâ€™ (trade names of Resolution) are preferred. Vinyl acetate is particularly preferred.<br>
Suitable monomers from the group consisting of acrylates or methacrylates are esters of straight-chain or branched alcohols having 1 to 15 C atoms.  Preferred methacrylates or acrylates are methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl acrylate, propyl methacrylate, n-butyl acrylate, n-butyl methacrylate, tert-butyl acrylate, tert-butyl methacrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate.  Methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, n-butyl acrylate, tert-butyl acrylate and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate are particularly preferred.<br>
Preferred vinylaromatics are styrene, methylstyrene and vinyltoluene.  A preferred vinyl halide is vinyl chloride. The preferred olefins  are ethylene, propylene and the preferred dienes are 1,3-butadiene and isoprene.<br>
Optionally, 0.1 to 5% by weight, based on  the total weight of monomer mixture, of auxiliary monomers, may also be copolymerized.  0.5 to 2.5% by weight of auxiliary monomers are preferably used.  Examples of auxiliary monomers are<br><br>
ethylenically unsaturated mono- and dicarboxylic acids, preferably acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, fumaric acid and maleic acid; ethylenically unsaturated carboxamides and carbonitriles, preferably acrylamide and acrylonitrile; mono-and diesters of fumaric acid and maleic acid, such as the diethyl and diisopropyl esters, and maleic anhydride, ethylenically unsaturated sulphonic acids or salts thereof, preferably vinylsulphonic acid and 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulphonic acid.  Further examples are precrosslinking comonomers, such as polyethylenically unsaturated comonomers, for example diallyl phthalate, divinyl adipate, diallyl maleate, allyl methacrylate or triallyl cyanurate, or postcrosslinking comonomers, for example acrylamidoglycolic acid {AGA}, methylacrylamidoglycolic acid methyl ester (MAGME), N-methylolacrylamide INMA), N-methylolmethacrylamide, N-methylolallyl carbamate, alkyl ethers such as the isobutoxy ether or esters of N-methylolacrylamide, of N-methylolmethacrylamide and of N-methylolallyl carbamate.  Epoxide-functional comonomers, such as glycidyl methacrylate and glycidyl acrylate, are also suitable.  Further examples are silicon-functional comonomers, such as acryloyloxypropyltri(alkoxy)silanes and methacryloyloxypropyltri(alkoxy)silanes, vinyltrialkoxysilanes and vinylmethyldialkoxysilanes, it being possible, for example, for ethoxy and ethoxypropylene glycol ether radicals to be present as alkoxy groups.  Monomers having hydroxyl or CO groups, for example hydroxyalkyl methacrylates and acrylates, such as hydroxyethyl, hydroxypropyl or hydroxybutyl acrylate or methacrylate, and compounds such as diacetoneacrylamide and acetylacetoxyethyl acrylate or methacrylate may also be mentioned.<br>
The choice of monomers or the choice of the proportions by weight of the comonomers is effected so that in general a glass transition temperature Tg of 
 <br>
calorimetry (DSC).  The Tg can also be calculated approximately in advance by means of the Fox equation. According to Fox T. G., Bull. Am. Physics Soc. 1, 3, page 123 (1956), the following is true: 1/Tg = xl/Tgl + x2/Tg2 + ... + xn/Tgn, where xn represents the mass fraction (% by weight/100) of the monomer n and Tgn is the glass transition temperature in Kelvin of the homopolymer of the monomer n.  Tg values for homopolymers are mentioned in Polymer Handbook 2nd Edition, J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1975).<br>
Homo- or copolymers which contain one or more monomers from the group consisting of vinyl acetate, vinyl esters of a-branched monocarboxylic acids having 9 to 11 C atoms, vinyl chloride, ethylene, methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl acrylate, propyl methacrylate, n-butyl acrylate, n-butyl methacrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate and styrene are preferred.  Particularly preferred are copolymers with vinyl acetate and ethylene; with vinyl acetate, ethylene and a vinyl ester of a-branched monocarboxylic acids having 9 to 11 C atoms; with n-butyl acrylate and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate and/or methyl methacrylate; with styrene and one or more monomers from the group consisting of methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, n-butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate; with vinyl acetate and one or more monomers from the group consisting of methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, n-butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate and optionally ethylene; with 1,3-butadiene and styrene and/or methyl methacrylate and optionally further acrylates; it being possible for said mixtures optionally also to contain one or more of the abovementioned auxiliary monomers.<br>
The preparation of the polymers is effected by the emulsion polymerization process or by the suspension polymerization process in the presence of protective colloids, preferably by the emulsion polymerization process, the polymerization temperature being in general 20Â°C to 100Â°C, preferably 60Â°C to 90Â°C, and, in the copolymerization of gaseous comonomers, such<br><br>
as ethylene, it also being possible to work under pressure, in general between 5 bar and 100 bar.  The initiation of the polymerization is effected with the water-soluble or monomer-soluble initiators or redox initiator combinations customary for emulsion polymerization or suspension polymerization. Examples of water-soluble initiators are sodium persulphate, hydrogen peroxide and azobisisobutyronitrile.  Examples of monomer-soluble initiators are dicetyl peroxydicarbonate, dicyclohexyl peroxydicarbonate and dibenzoyl peroxide.  Said initiators are used in general in an amount of 0.01 to 0.5% by weight, based on the total weight of the monomers.  Redox initiators used are combinations of said initiators in combination with reducing agents.  Suitable reducing agents are, for example, sodium sulphite, sodium<br>
hydroxymethanesulphinate and ascorbic acid.  The amount of the reducing agent is preferably 0.01 to 0.5% by weight, based on the total weight of the monomers.<br>
For controlling the molecular weight, regulating substances may be used during the polymerization.  If regulators are used, they are usually employed in amounts of from 0.01 to 5.0% by weight, based on the monomers to be polymerized and are metered separately or premixed with reaction components. Examples of such substances are n-dodecyl mercaptan, tert-dodecyl mercaptan, mercaptopropionic acid, methyl mercaptopropionate, isopropanol and acetaldehyde.  Preferably, no regulating substances are used.<br>
For stabilizing the polymerization batch, protective colloids are used, optionally in combination with emulsifiers. Suitable protective colloids are partly hydrolysed or completely hydrolysed polyvinyl alcohols;<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidones; polyvinyl acetals; polysaccharides in water-soluble form, such as starches (amylose and amylopectin), celluloses and the carboxymethyl, methyl, hydroxyethyl and hydroxypropyl derivatives thereof; proteins, such as casein or caseinate, soya protein, gelatine; ligninsulphonates; synthetic polymers, such as<br><br>
poly(meth)acrylic acid, copolymers of (meth)acrylates with carboxy-functional comonomer units, poly(meth)acrylamide, polyvinylsulphonic acids and the water-soluble copolymers thereof; melamine-formaldehyde sulphonates, naphthalene-formaldehyde sulphonates, and styrene/maleic acid and vinyl ether/maleic acid copolymers.  Partly hydrolysed or completely hydrolysed polyvinyl alcohols are preferred.  Partly hydrolysed polyvinyl alcohols having a degree of hydrolysis of 80 to 95 mol% and a Hoppler viscosity in 4% strength aqueous solution of 1 to 30 mPa-s (Hoppler method at 20Â°C, DIN 53015) are particularly preferred.<br>
After the end of the polymerization, post polymerization can be effected using known methods, for example by post polymerization initiated with a redox catalyst, for removing residual monomers.  Volatile residual monomers can also be removed by means of distillation, preferably under reduced pressure, and optionally while passing through or passing over inert entraining gases, such as air, nitrogen or steam.  The aqueous dispersions obtainable therewith have a solids content of 30 to 75% by weight, preferably of 50 to 60% by weight.<br>
For the preparation of the polymer powder compositions redispersible in water, the dispersions are dried, for example, by means of fluidized-bed drying, freeze drying or spray drying, optionally after addition of further protective colloids as a drying aid.  The dispersions are preferably spray-dried.  The spray drying is effected in customary spray drying units, it being possible to effect the atomization by means of airless, binary or multi-material nozzles or by means of a rotating disc.  The exit temperature is generally chosen to be in the range from 45Â°C to 120Â°C, preferably 60Â°C to 90Â°C, depending on unit, Tg of the resin and desired degree of drying.  The viscosity of the feed to be atomized is adjusted by means of the solids content so that a value of  35%, preferably &gt; 40%.<br><br><br>
thermoplastics.  Examples of conventional thermoplastics are polyethylene, polypropylene, PVC, ABS and polyvinyl acetate solid resin.  The proportion by weight of these thermoplastics in the mixture with the redispersible polymer powder preferably should not exceed 70% by weight.  Optionally, the redispersible polymer powder may also be used as a mixture with crosslinking agents.  Examples of these are epoxide crosslinking agents, such as Epicote.<br>
Optionally, further additives customary in the thermoplastic processing of plastics may also be present in the mixture. Examples of these are dyes, pigments, stabilizers, plasticizers, lubricants and flameproofing agents.<br>
For the production of the mouldings, the particulate natural materials and the polymer powder composition redispersible in water, and optionally further additives, are mixed with one another, for example in a hot mixer, and processed by means of the customary thermoplastic shaping techniques to give mouldings.  Preferably, the processing is effected by means of extrusion with appropriate devolatilization zone and injection moulding.  The processing temperature is in general 60Â°C to 200Â°C, preferably 90Â°C to 150Â°C.  The procedure is preferably effected at elevated pressure, preferably at pressures of 10 to 600 bar abs.  The production of the mouldings can also be effected via the granule stage.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that, with the use of a polymer powder composition redispersible in water, no pre-drying of air-dried wood having a water content of about 8% by weight and no addition of water-binding additives are required in the thermoplastic processing.  The production of mouldings is therefore considerably facilitated by the process according to the invention.<br>
The following examples serve for further explaining the<br>
invention:<br><br>
The following constituents were used for testing;<br>
RD powder 1 {RDP 1):<br>
Dispersion powder stabilized with polyvinyl alcohol and based on a polyvinyl acetate homopolymer having a Tg = 30Â°C (Vinnex LL 2510 from Wacker Chemie AG).<br>
RD powder 2 (RDP 2):<br>
Dispersion powder stabilized with polyvinyl alcohol and based on an ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer having a Tg = -1Â°C (Vinnex LL 2504 from Wacker Chemie AG).<br>
Comparative thermoplastic (CT):<br>
Polyvinyl acetate solid resin having a Tg = 30Â°C (Vinnapas UW<br>
1 from Wacker Chemie AG).<br>
Wood fibre (air-dried):<br>
Lignocel BK 40/90 from Rettenmaier<br>
Starch:<br>
Emsize E9 from Emsland Starke<br>
Pigment:<br>
Titanium dioxide Kronos 2000 from Kronos.<br>
Lubricant:<br>
Calcium stearate Caesit 1 from Barlocher.<br>
Rigid profiles (Table 1) and flexible profiles (Table 2) were<br>
produced by means of extrusion.<br>
For this purpose, the mixtures stated in the tables, in the<br>
amounts stated there (parts by weight), were processed using a<br>
twin-screw extruder having counterrotating screws to give<br>
profiles.  The processing temperature was 100Â°C to 130Â°C.<br>
The mixtures were also processed on an injection moulding<br>
unit.<br>
The extrudability, the injection mouldability and the bubble<br>
formation during the extrusion were visually assessed.<br><br>
The mechanical properties, such as modulus of elasticity (E modulus) and flexural strength (FS) were determined on pressed sheets measuring 80 mm x 10 mm x 4 mm according to DIN EN ISO 178.<br>
The results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2:<br>
Table 1:<br><br>
Rigid profile	Ex. l'	Ex. 2	Comp. 3	Comp. 4<br><br>
RDP 1 [parts by wt.]	25	25		<br>
VT PVAC [parts by wt.]			25	25<br>
Wood fibres [parts by wt.]	55	75	55	75<br>
Starch [parts by wt.]	20		20	<br>

FS [N/mmâ€™]	63	65	65	65<br>
Extrudability Injection mouldability	very qood	very good	good	poor<br>
Bubble formation	no	no	no	yes<br>
The results show that, with the use of redispersible thermoplastics as binders, the extrudability and injection mouldability and the properties of the end product are substantially improved compared with conventional thermoplastic.  This is clear especially in the case of the formulations without added starch: a non-redispersible PVAC solid resin cannot absorb the water liberated from the wood during the processing, which results in increased bubble formation and limited cohesion of the profile geometry.<br><br>
