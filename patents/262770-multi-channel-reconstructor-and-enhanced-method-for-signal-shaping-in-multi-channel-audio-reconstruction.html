Enhanced method for signal shaping in multi-channel audio<br>
reconstruction<br>
Description<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a concept of enhanced<br>
signal shaping in multi-channel audio reconstruction and in<br>
particular to a new approach of envelope shaping.<br>
Background of the Invention and Prior Art<br>
Recent development in audio coding enables recreation of a<br>
multi-channel representation of an audio signal based on a<br>
stereo (or mono) signal and corresponding control data.<br>
These methods differ substantially from older matrix based<br>
solutions, such as Dolby Prologic, since additional control<br>
data is transmitted to control the recreation, also<br>
referred to as up-mix, of the surround channels based on<br>
the transmitted mono or stereo channels. Such parametric<br>
multi-channel audio decoders reconstruct N channels based<br>
on M transmitted channels, where N &gt; M, and the additional<br>
control data. Using the additional control data causes a<br>
significantly lower data rate than transmitting all N<br>
channels, making the coding very efficient, while at the<br>
same time ensuring compatibility with both M channel<br>
devices and N channel devices. The M channels can either be<br>
a single mono channel, a stereo channel, or a 5.1 channel<br>
representation. Hence, it is possible to have an 7.2<br>
channel original signal, downmixed to a 5.1 channel<br>
backwards compatible signal, and spatial audio parameters<br>
enabling a spatial audio decoder to reproduce a closely<br>
resembling version of the original 7.2 channels, at a small<br>
additional bit rate overhead.<br><br>
These parametric surround coding methods usually comprise a<br>
parameterization of the surround signal based on time and<br>
frequency variant ILD (Inter Channel Level Difference) and<br>
ICC (Inter Channel Coherence) parameters. These parameters<br>
describe e.g. power ratios and correlations between channel<br>
pairs of the original multi-channel signal. In the decoding<br>
process, the re-created multichannel signal is obtained by<br>
distributing the energy of the received downmix channels<br>
between all the channel pairs as described by the<br>
transmitted ILD parameters. However, since a multi-channel<br>
signal can have equal power distribution between all<br>
channels, while the signals in the different channels are<br>
very different, thus giving the listening impression of a<br>
very wide sound, the correct wideness is obtained by mixing<br>
signals with decorrelated versions of the same, as<br>
described by the ICC parameter.<br>
The decorrelated version of the signal, often also referred<br>
to as wet or diffuse signal, is obtained by passing the<br>
signal through a reverberator, such as an all-pass filter.<br>
A simple form of decorrelation is applying a specific delay<br>
to the signal. Generally, there are a lot of different<br>
reverberators known in the art, the precise implementation<br>
of the reverberator used is of minor importance.<br>
The output from the decorrelator has a time response that<br>
is usually very flat. Hence, a dirac input signal gives a<br>
decaying noise burst out. When mixing the decorrelated and<br>
the original signal, it is for some transient signal types,<br>
like applause signals, important to perform some post-<br>
processing on the signal to avoid perceptuality of<br>
additionally introduced artefacts that may result in a<br>
larger perceived room size and pre-echo type of artefacts.<br>
Generally, the invention relates to a system that<br>
represents multi-channel audio as a combination of audio<br>
downmix data (e.g. one or two channels) and related<br>
parametric multi-channel data. In such a scheme (for<br><br>
example in binaural cue coding) an audio downmix data<br>
stream is transmitted, wherein it may be noted that the<br>
simplest form of downmix is simply adding the different<br>
signals of a multi-channel signal. Such a signal (sum<br>
signal) is accompanied by a parametric multi-channel data<br>
stream (side info). The side info comprises for example one<br>
or more of the parameter types discussed above to describe<br>
the spatial interrelation of the original channels of the<br>
multi-channel signal. In a sense, the parametric multi-<br>
channel scheme acts as a pre-/post-processor to the<br>
sending/receiving end of the downmix data, e.g. having the<br>
sum signal and the side information. It shall be noted that<br>
the sum signal of the downmix data may additionally be<br>
coded using any audio or speech coder.<br>
As transmission of multi-channel signals over low-bandwidth<br>
carriers is becoming more and more popular these systems,<br>
also known under "spatial audio coding", "MPEG surround",<br>
have been well developed recently.<br>

In a spatial audio decoder, the multi-channel upmix is<br>
computed from a direct signal part and a diffuse signal<br>
part, which is derived by means of decorrelation from the<br>
direct part, as already mentioned above. Thus, in general,<br>
the diffuse part has a different temporal envelope than the<br>
direct part. The term "temporal envelope" describes in this<br>
context the variation of the energy or amplitude of the<br>
signal with time. The differing temporal envelope leads to<br>
artifacts (pre- and post-echoes, temporal "smearing") in<br>
the upmix signals for input signals that have a wide stereo<br>
image and, at the same time, a transient envelope<br>
structure. Transient signals generally are signals that are<br>
varying strongly in a short time period.<br>
The probably most important examples for this class of<br>
signals are applause-like signals, which are frequently<br>
present in live recordings.<br>
In order to avoid artefacts caused by introducing<br>
diffuse/decorrelated sound with an inappropriate temporal<br>
envelope into the upmix signal, a number of techniques have<br>
been proposed:<br>
The US application 11/006,492 ("Diffuse Sound Shaping for<br>
BCC Schemes and The Like") shows that the perceptual<br>
quality of critical transient signals can be improved by<br><br>
shaping the temporal envelope of the diffuse signal to<br>
match the temporal envelope of the direct signal.<br>
This approach has already been introduced into MPEG<br>
surround technology by different tools, such as "temporal<br>
envelope shaping" (TES) and the "temporal processing" (TP).<br>
Since the target temporal envelope of the diffuse signal is<br>
derived from the envelope of the transmitted downmix<br>
signal, this method does not require additional side<br>
information to be transmitted. However, as a consequence,<br>
the temporal fine structure of the diffuse sound is the<br>
same for all output channels. As the direct signal part,<br>
which is directly derived from the transmitted downmix<br>
signal, does also have a similar temporal envelope, this<br>
method may improve the perceptual quality of applause-like<br>
signals in terms of "crisp-ness", i.e. However, as then the<br>
direct signal and diffuse signal have similar temporal<br>
envelopes for all channels, such techniques may enhance the<br>
subjective quality of applause-like signals but cannot<br>
improve the spatial distribution of single applause events<br>
in the signal, as this would only be possible, when one<br>
reconstructed channel would be much more intense at the<br>
occurrence of the transient signal than the other channels,<br>
which is impossible having signals sharing basically the<br>
same temporal envelope.<br>
An alternative method to overcome the problem is described<br>
by US application 11/006,482 ("individual Channel Shaping<br>
for BCC Schemes and The Like"). This approach employs fine-<br>
grain temporal broad band side information that is<br>
transmitted by the encoder to perform a fine temporal<br>
shaping of both the direct and the diffuse signal.<br>
Evidently, this approach allows a temporal fine structure<br>
that is individual for each output channel and thus is able<br>
to accommodate also signals for which transient events<br>
occur in only a subset of the output channels. A further<br>
variation of this approach is described in US 60/726,389<br>
("Methods for Improved Temporal and Spatial Shaping of<br><br>
Multi-Channel Audio Signals"). Both discussed approaches to<br>
enhance perceptual quality of transient coded signals<br>
comprise a temporal shaping of the envelope of the diffuse<br>
signal intended to match a corresponding direct signals<br>
temporal envelope.<br>
While both previously described prior-art methods can<br>
enhance the subjective quality of applause-like signals in<br>
terms of crisp-ness, only the latter approach can also<br>
improve the spatial redistribution of the reconstructed<br>
signal. Still, the subjective quality of the synthesized<br>
applause signals remains unsatisfactory, because the<br>
temporal shaping of both the combination of dry and<br>
diffused sound leads to characteristic distortions (the<br>
attacks of the individual claps are either perceived as not<br>
"tight" when only a loose temporal shaping is performed, or<br>
distortions are introduced if shaping with a very high<br>
temporal resolution is applied to the signal). This becomes<br>
evident, when a diffuse signal is simply a delayed copy of<br>
the direct signal. Then, the diffused signal mixed to the<br>
direct signal is likely to have a different spectral<br>
composition than the direct signal. Thus, even if the<br>
envelope is scaled to match the envelope of the direct<br>
signal, different spectral contributions, not originating<br>
directly from the original signal will be present in the<br>
reconstructed signal. The introduced distortions may become<br>
even worse, when the diffuse signal part is emphasized<br>
(made louder) during the reconstruction, when the diffuse<br>
signal is scaled to match the envelope of the direct<br>
signal.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a<br>
concept of enhanced signal shaping in multi-channel<br>
reconstruction.<br><br>
This object is achieved by an apparatus in accordance with<br>
claims 1 or 29, a method in accordance with claim 2 8 and a<br>
computer program in accordance with claim 30.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that a<br>
reconstructed output channel, reconstructed with a multi-<br>
channel reconstructor using at least one downmix channel<br>
derived by downmixing a plurality of original channels and<br>
using a parameter representation including additional<br>
information on a temporal (fine) structure of an original<br>
channel can be reconstructed efficiently with high<br>
quality, when a generator for generating a direct signal<br>
component and a diffuse signal component based on the<br>
downmix channel is used. The quality can be essentially<br>
enhanced, if only the direct signal component is modified<br>
such that the temporal fine structure of the reconstructed<br>
output channel is fitting a desired temporal fine<br>
structure, indicated by the additional information on the<br>
temporal fine structure transmitted.<br>
In other words, scaling the direct signal parts directly<br>
derived from the downmix signal, hardly introduces<br>
additional artifacts at the moment a transient signal<br>
occurs. When, as in prior art, the wet signal part is<br>
scaled to match a desired envelope, it may very well be<br>
the case that the original transient signal in the<br>
reconstructed channel is masked by an emphasized diffuse<br>
signal mixed to the direct signal, which will be more<br>
extensively described below.<br>
The present invention overcomes this problem by only<br>
scaling the direct signal component, thus giving no<br>
opportunity to introduce additional artifacts at the cost<br>
of transmitting additional parameters to describe the<br>
temporal envelope within the side information.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
envelope scaling parameters are derived using a<br><br>
representation of the direct and the diffuse signal with a<br>
whitened spectrum, i.e., where different spectral parts of<br>
the signal have almost identical energies. The advantages<br>
of using whitened spectra are twofold. One the one hand,<br>
using a whitened spectrum as a basis for the calculation<br>
of a scaling factor used to scale the direct signal allows<br>
for the transmission of only one parameter per time slot<br>
including information on the temporal structure. As it is<br>
usual in multi-channel audio coding that signals are<br>
processed within numerous frequency bands, this feature<br>
helps to decrease the number of additionally needed side<br>
information and hence the bit rate increase for the<br>
transmission of the additional parameter. Typically, other<br>
parameters such as ICLD and ICC are transmitted once per<br>
time frame and parameter band. As the number of parameter<br>
bands may be higher than 20, it is a major advantage<br>
having to transmit only one single parameter per channel.<br>
Generally, in multi-channel coding, signals are processed<br>
in a frame structure, i.e., in entities having several<br>
sampling values, for example 1024 per frame. Furthermore,<br>
as already mentioned, the signals are split into several<br>
spectral portions before being processed, such that<br>
finally typically one ICC and ICLD parameter is<br>
transmitted per frame and spectral portion of the signal.<br>
The second advantage of using only one parameter is<br>
physically motivated, since the transient signals in<br>
question naturally have broad spectra. Therefore, to<br>
account for the energy of the transient signals within the<br>
single channels correctly, it is most appropriate to use<br>
whitened spectra for the calculation of energy scaling<br>
factors.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention the<br>
inventive concept of modifying the direct signal component<br>
is only applied for a spectral portion of the signal above<br>
a certain spectral limit in the presence of additional<br>
residual signals. This is because residual signals<br><br>
together with the downmix signal allow for a high quality-<br>
reproduction of the original channels.<br>
Summarizing, the inventive concept is designed to provide<br>
enhanced temporal and spatial quality with respect to the<br>
prior art approaches, avoiding the problems associated<br>
with those techniques. Therefore, side information is<br>
transmitted to describe the fine time envelope structure<br>
of the individual channels and thus allow fine<br>
temporal/spatial shaping of the upmix channel signals at<br>
the decoder side. The inventive method described in this<br>
document is based on the following<br>
findings/considerations:<br>
•	Applause-like signals can be seen as composed of<br>
single, distinct nearby claps and a noise-like<br>
ambience originating from very dense far-off claps.<br>
•	In a spatial audio decoder, the best approximation of<br>
the nearby claps in terms of temporal envelope is the<br>
direct signal. Therefore, only the direct signal is<br>
processed by the inventive method.<br>
•	Since the diffuse signal represents mainly the<br>
ambience part of the signal, any processing on a fine<br>
temporal resolution is likely to introduce distortion<br>
and modulation artefacts (even though a certain<br>
subjective enhancement of applause ^crispness' might<br>
be achieved by such a technique). As a consequence to<br>
these considerations, thus the diffuse signal is<br>
untouched (i.e. not subjected to a fine time shaping)<br>
by the inventive processing.<br>
•	Nevertheless the diffuse signal contributes to the<br>
energy balance of the upmixed signal. The inventive<br>
method accounts for this by calculating a modified<br>
broadband scaling factor from the transmitted<br>
information that is to be applied solely to the direct<br>
signal part. This modified factor is chosen such that<br>
the overall energy in a given time interval is the<br><br>
same within certain bounds as if the original factor<br>
had been applied to both the direct and the diffuse<br>
part of the signal in this interval.<br>
•	Using the inventive method, best subjective audio<br>
quality is obtained if the spectral resolution of the<br>
spatial cues is chosen to be low - for instance 'full<br>
bandwidth' - to ensure preservation of spectral<br>
integrity of the transients contained in the signal.<br>
In this case, the proposed method does not necessarily<br>
increase the average spatial side information bitrate,<br>
since spectral resolution is safely traded for<br>
temporal resolution.<br>
The subjective quality improvement is achieved by<br>
amplifying or damping ("shaping") the dry part of the<br>
signal over time only and thus<br>
•	Enhancing transient quality by strengthening the<br>
direct signal part at the transient location, while<br>
avoiding additional distortion originating from a<br>
diffuse signal with inappropriate temporal envelope<br>
•	Improving spatial localisation by emphasizing the<br>
direct part w.r.t. the diffuse part at the spatial<br>
origin of a transient event and damping it relative to<br>
the diffuse part at far-off panning positions.<br>

Detailed Description of the further embodiments<br>
Fig. 1 shows an example for coding of multi-channel audio<br>
data according to prior art, to more clearly illustrate<br>
the problem solved by the inventive concept.<br>
Generally, on an encoder side, an original multi-channel<br>
signal 10 is input into the multi-channel encoder 12,<br>
deriving side information 14 indicating the spatial<br>
distribution of the various channels of the original<br>
multi-channel signals with respect to one another. Apart<br>
from the generation of side information 14, a multi-<br>
channel encoder 12 generates one or more sum signals 16,<br>
being downmixed from the original multi-channel signal.<br>
Famous configurations widely used are so-called 5-1-5 and<br>
5-2-5 configurations. In 5-1-5 configuration the encoder<br>
generates one single monophonic sum signal 16 from five<br>
input channels and hence, a corresponding decoder 18 has<br>
to generate five reconstructed channels of a reconstructed<br>
multi-channel signal 20. In the 5-2-5 configuration, the<br>
encoder generates two downmix channels from five input<br>
channels, the first channel of the downmixed channels<br><br>
typically holding information on a left side or a right<br>
side and the second channel of the downmixed channels<br>
holding information on the other side.<br>
Sample parameters describing the spatial distribution of<br>
the original channels are, as for example indicated in<br>
Fig. 1, the previously introduced parameters ICLD and ICC.<br>
It may be noted that within the analysis deriving the side<br>
information 14, the samples of the original channels of<br>
the multi-channel signal 10 are typically processed in<br>
subband domains representing a specific frequency interval<br>
of the original channels. A single frequency interval is<br>
indicated by K. In some applications, the input channels<br>
may be filtered by a hybrid filter bank before the<br>
processing, i.e., the parameter bands K may be further<br>
subdivided, each subdivision denoted with k.<br>
Furthermore, the processing of the sample values<br>
describing an original channel, is done in a frame-wise<br>
manner within each single parameter band, i.e. several<br>
consecutive samples form a frame of finite duration. The<br>
BCC parameters mentioned above typically describe a full<br>
frame.<br>
A parameter in some way related to the present invention<br>
and already known in the art is the ICLD parameter,<br>
describing the energy contained within a signal frame of a<br>
channel with respect to the corresponding frames of other<br>
channels of the original multi-channel or signal.<br>
Commonly, the generation of additional channels to derive<br>
a reconstruction of a multi-channel signal from one<br>
transmitted sum signal only is achieved with the help of<br>
decorrelated signals, being derived from the sum signal<br>
using decorrelators or reverberators. For a typical<br>
application, the discrete sample frequency may be 44.100<br>
kH, such that a single sample represents an interval of<br><br>
finite length of about 0.02 ms of an original channel. It<br>
may be noted that, using filter banks, the signal is split<br>
into numerous signal parts, each representing a finite<br>
frequency interval of the original signal. To compensate<br>
for a possible increase in parameters describing the<br>
channel, the time resolution is normally decreased, such<br>
that a finite length time portion described by a single<br>
sample within a filter bank domain may increase to more<br>
than 0.5 ms. Typical frame length may vary between 10 and<br>
15 ms.<br>
Deriving the decorrelated signal may make use of different<br>
filter structures and/or delays or combinations thereof<br>
without limiting the scope of the invention. It may be<br>
furthermore noted that not necessarily the whole spectrum<br>
has to be used to derive the decorrelated signals. For<br>
example, only spectral portions above a spectral lower<br>
bound (specific value of K) of the sum signal (downmix<br>
signal) may be used to derive the decorrelated signals<br>
using delays and/or filters. A decorrelated signal thus<br>
generally describes a signal derived from the downmix<br>
signal (downmix channel) such that a correlation<br>
coefficient, when derived using the decorrelated signal<br>
and the downmix channel significantly deviates from unity,<br>
for example by 0.2.<br>
Fig. lb gives an extremely simplified example of the down-<br>
mix and reconstruction process during multi-channel audio<br>
coding to explain the great benefit of the inventive<br>
concept of scaling only the direct signal component during<br>
reconstruction of a channel of a multi-channel signal. For<br>
the following description, some simplifications are<br>
assumed. The first simplification is that the down-mix of a<br>
left and a right channel is a simple addition of the<br>
amplitudes within the channels. The second strong<br>
simplification is, that the correlation is assumed to be a<br>
simple delay of the whole signal.<br><br>
Under these assumptions, a frame of a left channel 21a and<br>
a right channel 21b shall be encoded. As indicated on the<br>
x-axis of the shown windows, in multi-channel audio coding,<br>
the processing is typically performed on sample values,<br>
sampled with a fixed sample frequency. This shall, for ease<br>
of explanation, be furthermore neglected in the following<br>
short summary.<br>
As already mentioned, on the encoder side, a left and right<br>
channel is combined (down-mixed) into a down-mix channel 22<br>
that is to be transmitted to the decoder. On the decoder<br>
side, a decorrelated signal 23 is derived from the<br>
transmitted down-mix channel 22, which is the sum of the<br>
left channel 21a and the right channel 21b in this example.<br>
As already explained, the reconstruction of the left<br>
channel is then performed from signal frames derived from<br>
the down-mix channel 22 and the decorrelated signal 23.<br>
It may be noted that each single frame is undergoing a<br>
global scaling before the combination, as indicated by the<br>
ICLD parameter, which relates the energies within the<br>
individual frames of single channels to the energy of the<br>
corresponding frames of the other channels of a multi-<br>
channel signal.<br>
As it is assumed in the present example, that equal<br>
energies are contained within the frame of the left<br>
channel 21a and the frame of the right channel 21b, the<br>
transmitted down-mix channel 22 and the decorrelated<br>
signal 23 are scaled by roughly the factor of 0.5 before<br>
the combination. That is, when up-mixing is equally simple<br>
as down-mixing, i.e. summing up the two signals, the<br>
reconstruction of the original left channel 21a is the sum<br>
of the scaled down-mix channel 24a and the scaled<br>
decorrelated signal 24b.<br>
Because of the summation for transmission and the scaling<br>
due to the ICLD parameter, the signal to background ratio<br><br>
of the transient signal would be decreased by a factor of<br>
roughly 2. Furthermore, when simply adding the two signals,<br>
, an additional echo type of artefact would be introduced<br>
at the position of the delayed transient structure in the<br>
scaled decorrelated signal 24b.<br>
As indicated in Fig. lb, prior art tries to overcome the<br>
echo problem by scaling the amplitude of the scaled<br>
decorrelated signal 24b to make it match the envelope of<br>
the scaled transmitted channel 24a, as indicated by the<br>
dashed lines in frame 24b. Due to the scaling, the<br>
amplitude at the position of the original transient signal<br>
in the left channel 21a may be increased. However, the<br>
spectral composition of the decorrelated signal at the<br>
position of the scaling in frame 24b is different from the<br>
spectral composition of the original transient signal.<br>
Therefore, audible artefacts are introduced into the<br>
signal, even though the general intensity of the signal may<br>
be reproduced well.<br>
The great advantage of the present invention is that the<br>
present invention does only scale a direct signal component<br>
of reconstructed. As this channel does have a signal<br>
component corresponding to the original transient signal<br>
having the right spectral composition and the right timing,<br>
scaling only the down-mix channel will yield a<br>
reconstructed signal reconstructing the original transient<br>
event with high accuracy. This is the case since only<br>
signal parts are emphasized by the scaling that have the<br>
same spectral composition as the original transient signal.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a block diagram of a example of an inventive<br>
multi-channel reconstructor, to detail the principal of<br>
the inventive concept.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a multi-channel reconstructor 30, having a<br>
generator 32, a direct signal modifier and a combiner 36.<br>
The generator 32 receives a downmix channel 38 downmixed<br><br>
from a plurality of original channels and a parameter<br>
representation 40 including information on a temporal<br>
structure of an original channel.<br>
The generator generates a direct signal component 42 and a<br>
diffuse signal component 44 based on the downmix channel.<br>
The direct signal modifier 34 receives as well the direct<br>
signal component 42 as the diffuse signal component 44 and<br>
in addition the parameter representation 40 having the<br>
information on a temporal structure of the original<br>
channel. According to the present invention, the direct<br>
signal modifier 34 modifies only the direct signal<br>
component 42 using the parameter representation to derive<br>
a modified direct signal component 46.<br>
The modified direct signal component 4 6 and the diffuse<br>
signal component 44, which is not altered by the direct<br>
signal modifier 34, are input into the combiner 36 that<br>
combines the modified direct signal component 4 6 and the<br>
diffuse signal component 44 to obtain a reconstructed<br>
output channel 50.<br>
By only modifying the direct signal component 42 derived<br>
from the transmitted downmix channel 38 without<br>
reverberation (decorrelation), it is possible to<br>
reconstruct a time envelope for the reconstructed output<br>
channel matching closely a time envelope of the underlying<br>
original channel without introducing additional artefacts<br>
and audible distortions, as in prior art techniques.<br>
As will be discussed in more detail in the description of<br>
Fig. 3, the inventive envelope shaping restores the broad<br>
band envelope of the synthesized output signal. It<br>
comprises a modified upmix procedure, followed by envelope<br>
flattening and reshaping of the direct signal portion of<br>
each output channel. For reshaping, parametric broad band<br>
envelope side information contained in the bit stream of<br><br>
the parameter representation is used. This side<br>
information consists, according to one embodiment of the<br>
present invention, of ratios (envRatio) relating the<br>
transmitted downmix signal's envelope to the original<br>
input channel signal's envelope. In the decoder, gain<br>
factors are derived from these ratios to be applied to the<br>
direct signal on each time slot in a frame of a given<br>
output channel. The diffuse sound portion of each channel<br>
is not altered according to the inventive concept.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the present invention shown in<br>
the block diagram of Fig. 3 is a multi-channel<br>
reconstructor 60 modified to fit in the decoder signal<br>
flow of a MPEG spatial decoder.<br>
The multi-channel reconstructor 60 comprises a generator<br>
62 for generating a direct signal component 64 and a<br>
diffuse signal component 66 using a downmix channel 68<br>
derived by downmixing a plurality of original channels and<br>
a parameter representation 70 having information on<br>
spatial properties of original channels of the multi-<br>
channel signal, as used within MPEG coding. The multi-<br>
channel reconstructor 60 further comprises a direct signal<br>
modifier 68, receiving the direct signal component 64, the<br>
diffuse signal component 66, the downmix signal 69 and<br>
additional envelope side information 72 as input.<br>
The direct signal modifier provides at its modifier output<br>
73 the modified direct signal component, modified as<br>
described in more detail below.<br>
The combiner 74 receives the modified direct signal<br>
component and the diffuse signal component to obtain the<br>
reconstructed output channel 76.<br>
As shown in the Figure, the present invention may be<br>
easily implemented in already existing multi-channel<br>
environments. General application of the inventive concept<br><br>
within such a coding scheme could be switched on and off<br>
according to some parameters additionally transmitted<br>
within the parameter bit stream. For example, an<br>
additional flag bsTempShapeEnable could be introduced,<br>
which indicates, when set to 1, usage of the inventive<br>
concept is required.<br>
Furthermore, an additional flag could be introduced,<br>
specifying specifically the need of the application of the<br>
inventive concept on a channel by channel basis.<br>
Therefore, an additional flag may be used, called for<br>
example bsEnvShapeChannel. This flag, available for each<br>
individual channel, may then indicate the use of the<br>
inventive concept, when set to 1.<br>
It may furthermore be noted that for ease of presentation,<br>
only a two channel configuration is described in Fig. 3.<br>
Of course, the present invention is not intended to be<br>
limited to a two channel configuration only. Moreover, any<br>
channel configuration may be used in connection with the<br>
inventive concept. For example, five or seven input<br>
channels may be used in connection with the inventive<br>
advanced envelope shaping.<br>
When the inventive concept is applied within an MPEG<br>
coding scheme, as indicated in Fig. 3, and the application<br>
of the inventive concept is signaled by setting<br>
bsTempShapeEnable equal to 1, direct and diffuse signal<br>
components are synthesized separately by generator 62<br>
using a modified post-mixing in the hybrid subband domain<br>
according to the following formula:<br>
y:;L=M"'*w;,i, o<k></k>
Here and in the following paragraphs, vector wm,k describes<br>
the vector of n hybrid subband parameters for the k'th<br><br>
subband of the subband domain. As indicated by the above<br>
equation, direct and diffuse signal parameters y are<br>
separately derived in the upmixing. The direct outputs<br>
hold the direct signal component and the residual signal,<br>
which is a signal that may be additionally present in MPEG<br>
coding. Diffuse outputs provide the diffuse signal only.<br>
According to the inventive concept, only the direct signal<br>
component is further processed by the guided envelope<br>
shaping (the inventive envelope shaping).<br>
The envelope shaping process employs an envelope<br>
extraction operation on different signals. The envelopes<br>
extraction process taking place within direct signal<br>
modifier 68 is described in further detail in the<br>
following paragraphs as this is a mandatory step before<br>
application of the inventive modification to the direct<br>
signal component.<br>
As already mentioned, within the hybrid subband domain,<br>
subbands are denoted k. Several subbands k may also be<br>
organized in parameter bands K.<br>
The association of subbands to parameter bands underlying<br>
the embodiment of the present invention discussed below,<br>
is given in the tabular of Fig. 4.<br>
First, for each slot in a frame, the energies EKslolof certain<br>
parameter bands A: are calculated with y",k being a hybrid<br>
subband input signal.<br>
EM = 2&gt;"'V'*Y k = {k | K(k) = K) VKstart <k kstop></k>
k<br>
with Kstarl=\Q and ^=18<br><br>
The summation includes all k being attributed to one<br>
parameter band Kaccording to Table A.l.<br>
Subsequently, a long-term energy average EKslotior each<br>
parameter band is calculated as<br>
E*0,(n) = (l-a)E*ol(n) + aE:hl(n-l)<br>
(	64 &gt;<br>
a = exp	<br>
\ 0.4-44100J<br>
With a being a weighting factor corresponding to a first<br>
order IIR lowpass (approx. 400 ms time constant) and n is<br>
denoting the time slot index. The smoothed total average<br>
(broadband) energy Emal is calculated to be<br>

E,olAn) =	=	 Z £K")<br>
(	64 ^<br>
a-exp	<br>
{ 0.4-44100J<br>
As can be seen from the above formulas, the temporal<br>
envelope is smoothed before the gain factors are derived<br>
from the smoothed representation of the channels. Smoothing<br>
generally means deriving a smoothed representation from an<br>
original channel having decreased gradients.<br>
As can be seen from the above formulas, the subsequently<br>
described whitening operation is based on temporally<br>
smoothed total energy estimates and smoothed energy<br>
estimates in the subbands, thus ensuring greater stability<br>
of the final envelope estimates.<br><br>
The ratio of these energies is determined to obtain weights<br>
for a spectral whitening operation:<br>
wK(n)=-E""a,(-n)<br>
ELto + e<br>
The broadband envelope estimate is obtained by summation of<br>
the weighted contributions of the parameter bands,<br>
normalizing on a long-term energy average and calculation<br>
of the square root<br>

p = exp	<br>
V 0.04-44100J<br>
P is a weighting factor corresponding to a first order<br>
IIR lowpass (approx. 40 ms time constant).<br>
Spectrally whitened energy or amplitude measures are used<br>
as the basis for the calculation of the scaling factors. As<br>
can be seen from the above formulas, spectrally whitening<br>
means altering the spectrum such, that the same energy or<br>
mean amplitude is contained within each spectral band of<br>
the representation of the audio channels. This is most<br>
advantageous since the transient signals in question have<br>
very broad spectra such that it is necessary to use full<br>
information on the whole available spectrum for the<br>
calculation of the gain factors to not suppress the<br>
transient signals with respect to other non-transient<br>
signals. In other words, spectrally whitened signals are<br><br>
signals that have approximately equal energy in different<br>
spectral bands of their spectral representation.<br>
The inventive direct signal modifier modifies the direct<br>
signal component. As already mentioned, processing may be<br>
restricted to some subband indices starting with a<br>
starting index, in the presence of transmitted residual<br>
signals. Furthermore, processing may generally be<br>
restricted to subband indices above a threshold index.<br>
The envelope shaping process consists of a flattening of<br>
the direct sound envelope for each output channel followed<br>
by a reshaping towards a target envelope. This results in a<br>
gain curve being applied to the direct signal of each<br>
output channel if bsEnvShapeChannel=l is signalled for this<br>
channel in the side information.<br>
The processing is done for certain hybrid sub-subbands k<br>
only:<br>
k&gt;l<br>
In presence of transmitted residual signals, k is chosen<br>
to start above the highest residual band involved in the<br>
upmix of the channel in question.<br>
For 5-1-5 configuration the target envelope is obtained by<br>
estimating the envelope of the transmitted downmix EnvDmx,<br>
as described in the previous section, and subsequently<br>
scaling it with encoder transmitted and re-quantized<br>
envelope ratios envRatioch .<br>
Then, a gain curve gch(n) for all slots in a frame is<br>
calculated for each output channel by estimating its<br>
envelope Envch and relate it to the target envelope.<br>
Finally, this gain curve is converted into an effective<br>
gain curve for solely scaling the direct part of the<br>
upmixed channel:<br><br>
ratioch (n) = min (4,max (0.25, gch + ampRatioch (n) ■ (gch -1)))<br>

For 5-2-5 configuration the target envelope for L and Ls is<br>
derived from the left channel transmitted downmix signal's<br>
envelope EnvDmxL, for R and Rs the right channel transmitted<br>
downmix envelope is used EnvDmxR. The center channel is<br>
derived from the sum of left and right transmitted downmix<br>
signal's envelopes.<br>
The gain curve is calculated for each output channel by<br>
estimating its envelope EnvL,Ls-c,R,Rs and relate it to the<br>
target envelope. In a second step this gain curve is<br>
converted into an effective gain curve for solely scaling<br>
the direct part of the upmixed channel:<br>
ratioch(ri) = min (4, max (0.25, gch + ampRatioch («) • (gch -1)))<br>

downmix envelope is used EnvDmxR. The center channel is<br>
derived from the sum of left and right transmitted downmix<br>
signal's envelopes.<br>
The gain curve is calculated for each output channel by<br>
estimating its envelope EnvL-Ls-c-R,Rs and relate it to the<br>

converted into an effective gain curve for solely scaling<br>
the direct part of the upmixed channel:<br>

Finally, the modified direct signal component of each<br>
individual channel has to be combined with the diffuse<br>
signal component of the corresponding individual channel<br>
within the hybrid subband domain according to the<br>
following equation:<br>
yncH=yidiKc^y"cU^ che{L,Ls,C,R,Rs}<br>
As can be seen from the above paragraphs, the inventive<br>
concept teaches improving the perceptual quality and<br>
spatial distribution of applause-like signals in a spatial<br>
audio decoder. The enhancement is accomplished by deriving<br>
gain factors with fine scale temporal granularity to scale<br>
the direct part of the spatial upmix signal only. These<br>
gain factors are derived essentially from transmitted side<br>
information and level or energy measurements of the direct<br>
and diffuse signal in the encoder.<br><br>
As the above example particularly describes the<br>
calculation based on amplitude measurements, it should be<br>
noted that the inventive method is not restricted to this<br>
but could also calculate with, for example energy-<br>
measurements or other quantities suitable to describe a<br>
temporal envelope of a signal.<br>
The above example describes the calculation for 5-1-5 and<br>
5-2-5 channel configurations. Naturally, the above<br>
outlined principle could be applied analogously for e.g.<br>
7-2-7 and 7-5-7 channel configurations.<br>
Fig. 5 shows an example of an inventive multi-channel<br>
audio decoder 100, receiving a downmix channel 102 derived<br>
by downmixing a plurality of channels of one original<br>
multi-channel signal and a parameter representation 104<br>
including information on a temporal structure of the<br>
original channels (left front, right front, left rear and<br>
right rear) of the original multi-channel signal. The<br>
multi-channel decoder 100 is having a generator 106 for<br>
generating a direct signal component and a diffuse signal<br>
component for each of the original channels underlying the<br>
downmix channel 102. The multi-channel decoder 100 further<br>
comprises four inventive direct signal modifiers 108a to<br>
108d for each of the channels to be reconstructed, such<br>
that the multi-channel decoder outputs four output<br>
channels (left front, right front, left rear and right<br>
rear) on its outputs 112.<br>
Although the inventive multi-channel decoder has been<br>
detailed using an example configuration of four original<br>
channels to be reconstructed, the inventive concept may be<br>
implemented in multi-channel audio schemes having<br>
arbitrary numbers of channels.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a block diagram, detailing the inventive<br>
method of generating a reconstructed output channel.<br><br>
In a generation step 110, a direct signal component and a<br>
diffuse signal component is derived from the downmix<br>
channel, in a modification step 112 the direct signal<br>
component is modified using parameters of the parameter<br>
representation having information on a temporal structure<br>
of an original channel.<br>
In a combination step 114, the modified direct signal<br>
component and the diffuse signal component are combined to<br>
obtain a reconstructed output channel.<br>
Depending on certain implementation requirements of the<br>
inventive methods, the inventive methods can be<br>
implemented in hardware or in software. The implementation<br>
can be performed using a digital storage medium, in<br>
particular a disk, DVD or a CD having electronically<br>
readable control signals stored thereon, which cooperate<br>
with a programmable computer system such that the<br>
inventive methods are performed. Generally, the present<br>
invention is, therefore, a computer program product with a<br>
program code stored on a machine readable carrier, the<br>
program code being operative for performing the inventive<br>
methods when the computer program product runs on a<br>
computer. In other words, the inventive methods are,<br>
therefore, a computer program having a program code for<br>
performing at least one of the inventive methods when the<br>
computer program runs on a computer.<br>
