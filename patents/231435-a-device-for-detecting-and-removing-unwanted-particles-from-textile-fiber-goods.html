				<td>This invention relates to a device for detecting and remrrticles from<br>
textile fiber goods".	<br>
The invention refers to a device at a card, a cleaner or the equivalent for identifyins and removal of disturbing particles, particularly trash parts, shell neps, seed residuals and the equivalent in or rather out of textile fibre materials, in which over the width at least one detector equipment, as for example a camera with an electronic evaluatlon equipment for identifying and downwards an eliminating equipment for removal of particles are present.<br>
At cards and clearer waste; trash-or dust eliminating<br>
knife are input. At (cleaner these knives are used in combination with saw tooth rollers and in cards specially at licket in Also an allocation to needle roller is a possibility. The knives are used many times in combination with suction heads or pipes. Therein the suction heads have the [assignment and dust to transport away the trash short fibres and dust particles in air flow,,eliminated by the knife. These knives are adjusted stationary, that moans the place of the knife, the distance of knife tip from the roller (cylinder) and the angle positioning of knife-eliminating side to the tangents of cylinder are constant during the operation of the machines. Therein it is disadvantageous, that the change of this adjustment parameter is often very difficult and therefore can take place only at stand still position. The distance of knife edge (tip) to saw<br>
a<br>
tooth filetting on the licker-in can amount to for example between 0.2 1:0 0.6mm depending on fibre material under process. The adjustment of distance takes place in<br><br>
stand still position of the machine manually under use of so called distance gauge. An adjustment of the knife takes p] ace as for example to fit in different materials, particularly different dirt contents and types.<br>
In the practice the eliminating knife is built through going as single piece knife blade, which stretches over the breadth of the machine. A disadvantage of the known eliminating knife exists therein that a matching to the localised different contents or local concentrations or even individual items r.t foreign bodies in fibre materials, like vaste, neps, seed fragments, trash particles and the squivalent is not possible.<br>
The assignment therefore lies at the base of the invention to procure a device as mentioned at the entry which avoids the mentioned disadvantages, which improves specially in simple way the working of eliminating equipment.<br>
Through it, that a multiple number of guide items are present, which would deflect selectively the fibre materials, it is made possible in a simple way an individual matching or rather strengthening of elimination of individual foreign bodies or locally concentrated multiple number of foreign bodies. In this way the effect of eliminating equipment is essentially improved, in dor.ng so the elimination is concentrated only, in the individual particles and is strengthened through it. A further advantage exists therein, that the areas of fibre materials without foreign particles remain unaffected through the eliminating equipment.<br><br>
The invention covers a further advantageous device at a clearer, a card cr the equivalent for cleaning and opening of textile fibre materials, specially cotton, with a rotating filetting-or needle roller reconnected to a supply equipment which is surrounded by a housing which shows at Least one opening for removal of contaminations like trash particles, reed residuals, seed shells, stem residual, sand and the equivalent in which at least one eliminating knife is allocated to the filetting or to the needle of filetting-or needle roller, which shows a knife edge directed against the direction of rotation of filetting-or needle roller which is assembled at the opening in which the eliminating knife is made out of a multiple number of knife items and the distance between the individual knife items and the filetting or the needles of filetting-or reedle roller is changeabLeâ€¢<br>
Through it, that the eliminating knife is made out, of a multiple number of knife items whose distance to the roller is individually adjustable or rather changeable, it is made possible in simple way an individual matching of elimination at locally different content or local concentration if required, up to an individual foreign body. A definite elimination takes place. Therein in advantageous way s selectively short time-elimination (a foreign component part is identified and is individually eliminated) as well as the long term different adjustment of individual knife items can take place over the breadth of tte machine, in order to counter act as for example identfied accumulation of foreign component parts over the width of the machine.<br><br>
The invention is explained closer followingly with the help of examples.<br>
It shows :<br>
Fig.l Schematially side view of a card with a support and guide body for the fleece and details of three places for the device as per invention.<br>
Fig.2 Side view of a first build up of the device as per invention between stripping roller and squeezer roller of a card.<br>
Fig.3 Perspective representation of the device as per invention with two cameras.<br>
Fig.4 Section through a guide item with a piezo electric bending converter.<br>
Fig.5 Plan view on the fibre material with a foreign body, the detector area, the guide items and the eliminating knife and<br>
Fig.6 a further development with segmented, individually deflectable eliminating knives.<br>
Figure 1 shows a card, as for example Truetzschler high capacity card DK 903, with feed roller 1, feed table 2, licker-in 3a, 3b, 3c, drum 4, doffing cylinder 5, stripping roller 6, squeezer rolls 7, 8, non woven fleece guide item 9, web trumpet 10, draw boxes 11, 12,<br><br>
revolving flat 13 with flat rods 14, can 15 and can coiler. 16. The direction of rotation of rolls are shown with bent arrows. Working direction is denoted with A. Below the stripping roller 6 a support and giiide body 17 for the fleece 18 is assembled. With B the areas is denoted in which the transferred fleece from the support and lead bodies 17 on the roll gap between the squeezer rolls 7, 8, goes over. In area B a first1 development of invention (see here Figure 2 to 4) is assembled. In the areas C and D allocated to the drum 4 a further development of invention (see here fig.6) is assembled.<br>
Figure 2 shows that the support-and guide bodies 17 shows essentially a rectangular cross section. The upper surface is Dent lightly concave. The radius of curvature of bending of the surface is greater than the radius of curvature of stripping roller 6. The arrow A states the direction of running of non woven fleece 18. The front end area shows an edge, the back end area is rounded off. The edge avoids the deposit of contaminations, as for example honey dew. The contect slide area of surface is cleaned through the non woven fleece 18 sliding over it, as for example from trash. The cross section shape of item 17 is matched to the air flow proportions in area between the doffing cylinder 5, the stripping roller 6 and the squeezer rolls 7, 8. The item 17 serves as support- and guide body for the non woven fleece 18. The item 17 is developed as housing, in doing so in the contact area a transparent window 19 is present. The non woven fleece is located first on the filett of doffing cylinder !5, guided around and over the roller gap between doffing cylinder 5 and stripping roller 6 on the filetting of stripping roller 6, is transferred to the area of vertical diameter of stripping roller 6 led in the contact siding area on the surface in direction A, flows in the connection to end<br><br>
area through the area B and enters finally in roll gap between the squeezer rolls and pushes through it. In internal space 171 of housing 17 a camera 20, as for example line scan camera and a lighting equipment as for example out of multiple number of light emitting diodes are assembled. Between the item 17 and the roller gap between the squeezer rolls 7,8, in area B a first development of device as per invention is assembled. The fibre material 18 follows over a support item 21, to which an eliminating knife 22 with eliminating opening 23 and suction head 24 are reconnected. Above the fibre materials 18 guide link 25 out of multiple number of guide items 25a to 25n (see also figure 3) are present, which remain without activation only lightly sliding or not in touch with fibre materials 18.<br>
Figure 3 shows the support item 21, over whose breadth two cameras 20a, 20b are assembled which are connected to a (not shown) picture evaluation equipment and to a (not shown) electronic control and regulating equipment which can be built is per the German patent application 19604 499.5 The support item 21, as for example a plate shows below the guide item 25a to 25n a bulging out 21a which forms a narrowing. A further guide plate 27 is reassembled to the eliminating knife 22. The guide link25 is built somewhat comb shaped, in doing so at a common holding plate 25' the one end of guide item 25a to 25n is brought up, while the other end of guide item 25a to 25n in each case is open. The holding area 25' is firmly fixed at two supports 26a,26b (only 26a shown), as for example with bolts 32. The guide items 25a to 25n are elastic and are deflected by activation and deactivation in direction of arrow E or rather F.<br>
As per figure 4 the guide item 25a brought at the holding area 25' is developed as piezo ceramic bending<br><br>
converter. A central carrier material 25, is present, on whose both flat sides in each case a piezo ceramic layer 252, 253 is brought upon. On the external side of piezo ceramic layers 252, 253 in each case a contacting- and protection layer 254, 255 are brought in. With 29, 30 a mechanical path limitation is denoted.<br>
As shown schematically in Fig.5, in operation a foreign body 28 located in area a, in fibre material 18- which moves below the cameras 20a, 20b in direction A- is covered (detected), whereupon over the control- and regulating equipment an electric pulse is generated, through which the guide item 25f located in area a, is deflected in direction of arrow E (Fig.3) to downwards on ground of piezo electric effect. Through it the guide item 25f presses only the fibre material area a with the foreign body 28 to downward, so that the distance to knife edge of eliminating knife 22 is reduced that means the elimination of foreign body 28 is made easy. In this way the selective elimination of foreign body 28 is improved. With 31 the detection area of cameras 20a, 20b is denoted.<br>
Cleaning shop machines, cards and combing machines in fibre preparation units have among others the assignment to remove foreign components out of the processed material. In case of cotton, these neps, seed fragments (also shell neps) and trash particles are of different sizes. The elimination refers to the physical difference between foreign components and thefibre materials, as a rule these are density difference, difference of mass-surface proportions (ratio of slenderness, resistance to flow) and difference in the combination of non woven fleece. Under utilisation of this difference the material is exposed to accelerations and/or air flow,<br><br>
which are so sized and oriented that preferably the foreign components are separated. The process of separation is consequently not specifying: The total material flow is subjected to it; through the above mentioned physical difference in statistical average an accumulation of foreign components in waste is adjusted.<br>
Essentially as per invention, the combination of a detection unit (cameras 20a, 20b) scanning the total machine width, which includes a hard-and software, which generates out of the detection result activation signal for an actuating movable guide item is of an individually controllable and actuatingly movable guide item 25 over the machine breadth as well as of a continuously working eliminating item (knife 22). In level of detection line 31 the entire crossing past" fibre mass flow 18 is scanned and investigated on foreign components 25, This can take place with the method of picture processing (more number of cameras and evaluation units analogous to those in Truetzschler -NCT), but also with other methods. On basis of a prescribable threshold, it is decided on an evaluation logic, which of the detected foreign components 28 will be eliminated. Herein apart from the desire to the extent possible less foreign components 28 in final products, it must be considered that each initiated separation, represerts a reduction of previously scanned fibre amounts and through it leads to an impairing of later sliver uniformity (CV-value). The detection equipment 20 connects the guide item 25, which diverts fibre mass flow 18 in a very small area of machine breadth or rather fibre material width b from the specified direction of movement. The idea lies at the base of the assembly to separate the individual handling of foreign components 28 and the real process of separation from eact other. It is important, to deflect the non woven fleece 18 on basis of previously described<br><br>
detection at the eight place partially in the working area of a continuously working elimination process 22. The forces necessary for this are small so that as for example advantageously piezo ceramic bending converter can come to application. Also other quick connectable actuators, as for example electro magnetic converter, pneumatic cylinder or others are applicable. The separation line builds the closing of assembly, the separation line for example through a suction head, which as for example can be built through a suction head 24 with eliminating knife 22 or a quick rotating eliminating roller.<br>
In a further development as per Fig.6 the eliminating knife comprises of a multiple number of knife items 2a to 22n over the breadth. The knife items can be individually activeted and deflected in direction of arrow G, H. In this case-in comparison to development as per Fig.2 to Fig.5 - the (segmented) eliminating knife of suction head replaces the (segmented) guide item 25. Through localised proximity of a knife item as for example 22C, for example at the filetting 4a of rotating drum 4 in direction G the separation of a foreign body 28 in fibre material is introduced.<br>
Besides the selective short time- elimination (a foreign component 28 is identified and individually separated) it is also covered to adjust differently long term wise the individual knife segments over LGW (light rack width) on basis of a scanning with the NCT, in order to counter act as for example the accumulation of foreign components 28 over LGW.<br><br>
