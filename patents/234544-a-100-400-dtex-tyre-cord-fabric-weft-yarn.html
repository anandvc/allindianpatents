				<td>Weft yarn and piuJuiLioa ol a weft yai-n from hsaHr<br>
protected nylon 66 fur—byre cord fabric<br>
The present invention relates to a 100-400 dtex<br>
tyre cord fabric weft yarn comprising a heat-protected<br>
nylon-6,6 multifilament and to a process for producing a<br>
weft yarn.<br>
Weft yarn for tyre cord fabric and a process for<br>
making it from polyester POY are known (WO-A-96/2391) .<br>
The yarns produced from polyester POY filaments have very<br>
low thermal stability. Lower spinning speeds do not yield<br>
any improvement. The filament yarn turns brittle on the<br>
relaxation heater at 220°C, losing a large proportion of<br>
its strength and residual elongation at break.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to<br>
provide a PA 66 tyre cord fabric weft yarn having high<br>
thermal stability, a defined reversibility limit,<br>
adequate tenacity and slip resistance and also a high<br>
ultimate tensile stress elongation.<br>
It is a further object to provide a process for<br>
producing tyre cord weft yarns which, following impregnation,<br>
exhibit an ultimate tensile stress elongation<br>
which ensures spreading of the cord threads in tyre<br>
manufacture without weft thread breakages.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention<br>
when the base yarn combines the following features:<br>
80% extension SLASE of 6 cN/tex to 12 cN/tex<br>
ultimate tensile stress elongation of 150 to 300%<br>
tenacity &gt; 14 cN/tex<br>
reversibility limit of 5 cN/tex to 10 cN/tex<br>
160°C thermal shrinkage force of 0.15 cN/tex to<br>
0.8 cN/tex<br>
160°C free shrinkage &gt; 1%.<br>
Such a yarn has the advantage of facilitating<br>
homogeneous warp thread distribution in tyre construction<br>
due to pronounced flow characteristics in the fabric. In<br>
addition, this yarn constitutes a single-component weft<br>
yarn which does not give rise to unpleasant and harmful<br>
dust in weaving, as is customary with the use of natural<br>
fibres. It is additionally intended to withstand high<br>
thermal stress during the impregnating step, to exhibit<br>
hardly any widthwise contraction and, in the construction<br>
of a tyre, to facilitate very homogeneous cord warp<br>
thread spreading and so be universally useful for tyre<br>
cord fabrics based on nylon, polyester and aramid.<br>
At an extension of 80%, preferably 90-150%, a<br>
load of 6 cN/tex to 12 cN/tex, preferably 6-10 cN/tex, is<br>
advantageous. Loads higher than 12 cN/tex at the stated<br>
extension have the disadvantage of inhomogeneous warp<br>
thread distribution when the radial tyre expands on the<br>
tyre construction machine. Loads below 6 cN/tex at the<br>
stated extension lead, not only under uniform but also<br>
under local loads, for example in the course of storage<br>
of fabric bales, to irreversible weft thread stretching<br>
and so to inadequate stability with regard to warp thread<br>
parallelity. This gives rise to poor or unusable tyre<br>
carcasses.<br>
An ultimate tensile stress elongation of 
preferably 180-280%, is advantageous. Ultimate tensile<br>
stress elongations of more than 300% lead to excessively<br>
high stretching under customary loads in the production<br>
of tyre cord fabrics; an ultimate tensile stress<br>
elongation of less than 150%, by contrast, leads to<br>
insufficient extensibility reserve, resulting in insufficient<br>
weft deformation or even weft yarn breakages in<br>
the fabric. In both cases, the resulting tyre carcasses<br>
are inhomogeneous and so the tyres which are manufactured<br>
therefrom are as well.<br>
It is advantageous for the weft yarn to have a<br>
tenacity of at least 14 cN/tex in order that the peak<br>
stresses obtaining during the various processing steps<br>
cannot lead to weft yarn breakages.<br>
A reversibility limit of 5 to 10 cN/tex is<br>
particularly advantageous. A reversibility limit of less<br>
than 5 cN/tex means that there is no way of ensuring<br>
dimensional stability on weft insertion or fabric width<br>
stability until processing into the tyre. If the reversibility<br>
limit is greater than 10 cN/tex, the force which<br>
results during the vulcanization step is not sufficient<br>
to spread the individual cord threads uniformly.<br>
A thermal shrinkage force of 0.15 to 0.8 cN/tex<br>
has the advantage of virtually no widthwise contraction<br>
occurring during the impregnating step and hence of<br>
ensuring a homogeneous cord warp thread distribution,<br>
especially in the case of fabrics having weft yarn laidin<br>
selvages, during this step as well; a thermal<br>
shrinkage force of greater than 0.8 cN/tex will, despite<br>
the forces applied by spreading rolls to the weft threads<br>
during the impregnating step, result in thread<br>
shortening, which jeopardizes the required homogeneity.<br>
This leads, especially at the fabric selvages, to undesirable<br>
warp thread compaction. In the case of thermal<br>
shrinkage forces of less than 0.15 cN/tex, the thermal<br>
stress on the carcass fabric during impregnation is<br>
sufficient to give rise to thread lengthening, which<br>
jeopardizes the parallelity of the warp threads.<br>
According to the invention, it is not absolutely<br>
necessary for all the base yarn features to be within the<br>
claimed limits at one and the same time.<br>
It is advantageous for the weft yarn to combine<br>
the following features following a tensionless hot air<br>
treatment at 235°C for 5 min:<br>
ultimate tensile stress elongation of greater than<br>
80%<br>
80% extension SLASE of 6 cN/tex to 14 cN/tex<br>
reversibility limit of 5 to 10 cN/tex<br>
no uncontrollable change in length due to the heat<br>
treatment.<br>
Ultimate tensile stress elongations of greater<br>
than 80%, preferably greater than 110%, are advantageous.<br>
Ultimate tensile stress elongations of more than 110% for<br>
the impregnated fabric weft yarn have been found to be<br>
particularly useful, since this prevents any random<br>
breakage of individual weft threads, especially during<br>
the expanding of the tyre blanks on the tyre construction<br>
drum, during the process-based spreading of the carcass.<br>
Isolated weft thread breakages lead to nonuniform cord<br>
thread spacing in the carcass and so to inadequate tyre<br>
roundness.<br>
The impregnated weft yarn has an 80% SLASE of<br>
less than 14 cN/tex, preferably less than 12 cN/tex. An<br>
80% SLASE of more than 12 cN/tex increases, in the construction<br>
of a tyre, the risk of unlevel distribution of<br>
the warp threads as the carcass is expanded to the final<br>
tyre circumference. The impregnated yarn is conventionally<br>
RFL-dipped and then heat-set at temperatures of up<br>
to 245°C, preferably at 210-235°C for 45-200 s.<br>
The reversibility limit is less than 10 cN/tex,<br>
preferably less than 8 cN/tex, after the hot air treatment.<br>
This has the advantage that spreading forces that<br>
occur during vulcanization are sufficient to deform the<br>
warp threads so as to ensure uniform distribution of the<br>
carcass threads.<br>
The starting material used for the feed yarn of<br>
the process of the present invention is a nylon-6,6 LOY.<br>
Instead of pure nylon-6,6 it is also possible to use a<br>
copolyamide at at least 85% by weight. Examples of<br>
suitable copolyamides are PA 6, PA 6,10 and aramid. The<br>
nylon-6,6 LOY has generally been drawn at spinning takeoff<br>
speeds of less than 1800 m/min. The starting yarn is<br>
heat-protected with a copper additive at at least 30 ppm<br>
of Cu, preferably at 60-80 ppm of Cu.<br>
In a particularly suitable one-stage production<br>
process starting from an LOY, nylon-6,6 LOY filaments<br>
heat-protected with at least 30 ppm of Cu are drawn<br>
between 10 and 200%, preferably between 40 and 150%,<br>
especially between 40 and 125, and then entangled by<br>
means of a compressed gas to at least 10 nodes/m, preferably<br>
at least 15 nodes/m. The process has the advantage<br>
of producing a compact filament assembly having a<br>
relatively rough and slip-resistant surface. The drawing<br>
of the LOY yarn can be effected cold or hot, with or<br>
without snugging pin.<br>
In a varied process, the nylon LOY filaments are<br>
drawn between 10 and 200% in a first process step and<br>
then entangled, simultaneously or subsequently, to at<br>
least 10 nodes/m by means of a compressed gas and relaxed<br>
by between 0 and 30% at 150 to 235°C, preferably 200 to<br>
225°C, in a second process step. This has the advantage<br>
of producing lower shrinkage values and lower LASEs.<br>
In a further variant of the process, the weft<br>
yarn is additionally set, or afterdrawn, at a temperature<br>
between 150 and 235°C, especially between 180 and 225°C,<br>
by 0 to 10%. This has the advantage of providing for a<br>
further reduction in the shrinkage values and thus of<br>
making it possible to conform shrinkage properties to<br>
particular tyre construction process conditions.<br>
The weft yarn is used as a base yarn and is<br>
particularly useful for tyre cord fabrics.<br>

Slope of the quasi linear part of the lower<br>
stress-strain curve.<br>
