ADJUSTABLE AIR STREAM INTRODUCING DEVICE<br>
This invention relates to an adjustable air stream introducing device, more particularly to an adjustable air stream introducing device for reinforcement of a blowing power of a primary air stream flowing through a duct.<br>
A conventional tubular coupler for reinforcement of a blowing or cooling power of a primary or dry air stream flowing through a duct, generally has an inner surrounding wall which includes a proximate surrounding segment that surrounds and that is distant from an output port of the duct radially with an annular space therebetween for introducing the air stream. It is desirable to have a device for adjusting the amount of air stream introduced into the tubular coupler to suit the user's requirements.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an adjustable air stream introducing device for reinforcement of a blowing power of a primary air stream flowing through a duct.<br>
According to this invention, the adjustable air stream introducing device includes a tubular coupler with an inner surrounding wall which surrounds an axis and which confines a conduit adapted to be disposed downstream of a duct. The inner surrounding wall includes proximate and distal surrounding segments relative to a surrounding end portion of the duct. The proximate surrounding segment is adapted to surround and to be disposed distant from the surrounding end portion in radial directions with an annular space<br><br>
2<br>
therebetween. A surrounding seat member includes a first inner peripheral edge which surrounds the axis to engage the surrounding end portion, a first outer peripheral edge which engages the proximate surrounding segment, and a surrounding seat area which is interposed between and which is integrally-formed with the first inner and outer peripheral edges. The surrounding seat member has a plurality of internal ports which are disposed in the surrounding seat area to communicate , with the conduit and which are angularly displaced from one another about the axis. A surrounding sash member includes a second inner peripheral edge which surrounds the axis to be disposed adjacent to the surrounding end portion, a second outer peripheral edge which is disposed adj acent to the proximate surrounding segment, and a surrounding sash area which is interposed between and which is integrally formed with the second inner and outer peripheral edges . The surrounding sash member has a plurality of external ports which are disposed in the surrounding sash area and which are angularly displaced from one another about the axis. The surrounding sash member is disposed to overlie and to be turnable relative to the surrounding seat member about the axis between a fully open position, where the external ports fully coincide with the internal ports, respectively, and a partially open position, where the external ports partly overlap the internal ports, respectively. A motor-driven actuator member is disposed to initiate rotating movement of the surrounding sash member<br><br>
3<br>
between the fully open position and the partially open position.<br>
Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment of the invention, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>

4<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the preferred embodiment of the adjustable air stream introducing device according to the present invention is shown to comprise a tubular coupler 10, a surrounding seat member 20, a surrounding sash member 30, a motor-driven actuator member 40, and a deactivating member.<br>
The tubular coupler 10 has an inner surrounding wall which surrounds an axis and which confines a conduit 15. The inner surrounding wall includes proximate and distal surrounding segments 11,12 opposite to each other in an axial direction. The proximate surrounding segment 11 is disposed to surround and to be distal from a connecting head 14 in radial directions with an annular space 16 therebetween. The connecting head 14 is connected to a duct 13 such that a primary air stream, such as a heated or dry air stream, flows through the duct 13 and the conduit 15 towards a passage (not shown) for drying purposes.<br>
With reference to Fig. 2, the surrounding seat member 2 0 includes a first inner peripheral edge 23 which is disposed to surround the axis to engage a surrounding end portion of the connecting head 14, a first outer peripheral edge 22 which is opposite to the first inner peripheral edge 2 3 in the radial directions and which engages the proximate surrounding segment 11, and a surrounding seat area 21 which is interposed between and which is integrally formed with the first inner and outer peripheral edges 23,22. The surrounding seat member 20 has a plurality of internal ports 28 which are disposed in the surrounding seat area 21 to<br><br>
5<br>
communicate with the conduit 15, and which are angularly displaced from one another about the axis. In addition, an arcuate keyway 29, in the form of an arcuate groove, is formed in the surrounding seat area 21 and extends along the first outer peripheral edge 22 to have two terminating ends 291,292.<br>
The surrounding sash member 30 is disposed to overlie on the surrounding seat member 20, and includes a second inner peripheral edge 36 which is disposed to surround the axis to engage the surrounding end portion of the connecting head 14, a second outer peripheral edge 37 which is opposite to the second inner peripheral edge 36 in the radial directions and which is disposed adjacent to the proximate surrounding segment 11, and a surrounding sash area 31 which is interposed between and which is integrally formed with the second inner and outer peripheral edges 36,37. The surrounding sash member 3 0 has a plurality of external ports 3 8 which are disposed in the surrounding sash area 31, and which are angularly displaced from one another about the axis. The surrounding sash member 3 0 is turnable relative to the surrounding seat member 20 about the axis among a fully open position, where the external ports 38 fully coincide respectively with the internal ports 28, as shown in Fig. 9, a partially open position, where the external ports 38 partly overlap the internal ports 28, respectively, as shown in Fig. 8, and a closed position, where each external port 38 is offset from the respective internal port 28, as shown in Fig. 3. Further,<br><br>
6<br>
with reference to Fig. 6, four pairs of arcuate grooves 34, 35 are formed in the surrounding sash area 31 adjacent to the second inner and outer peripheral edges 36,37 for passage of four pairs of stems 24,25 which are secured to the surrounding seat member 20 such that the stems 24,25 are movable along the respective grooves 34,35 when the surrounding sash member 3 0 is rotated relative to the surrounding seat member 20.<br>
As shown in Figs. 3 to 5, the motor-driven actuator member  40 includes a motor 42 which is disposed on the tubular coupler 10 and which has an output shaft 421 that extends in the axial direction. An arcuate rack 41 is secured on the surrounding sash area 31 adj acent to the second outer peripheral edge 37 and has a plurality of teeth 414 . A pinion 422 is mounted on and is driven by the output shaft 421 to mesh with the teeth 414 so as to initiate rotating movement of the surrounding sash member 30 about the axis.<br>
As shown in Figs. 4, 5 and 7, two screw bolts 43, which serve as two keys, pass through two ends 412,413 of the rack 41 and the keyway 2 9 and engage threadedly two screw nuts 44 so as to secure the rack 41 on the surrounding sash member 30. Further, the screw bolts 43 are movable along the keyway 29 so as to guide the rotating movement of the surrounding sash member 30.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the deactivating member includes a contact portion 411 which is disposed on the rack 41 adjacent to the end 412. First and second microswitches 46,45 are<br><br>
7<br>
mounted on the surrounding seat area 21 adjacent to the second outer peripheral edge 22, and respectively have first and second contact points 461,451.<br>
In the state shown in Fig. 3, the surrounding sash member 30 is in the closed position, and the second point 451 contacts the contact portion 411 to transmit a signal so as to stop the operation of the motor 42.<br>
As shown in Figs. 6 and 9, the motor 42 can be actuated to rotate the pinion 422 so as to rotate the surrounding sash member 30 from the closed position to the fully open position. The motor 42 will be stopped when the surrounding sash member 30 is in the fully open position due to a signal transmitted upon contact of the contact portion 411 with the first point 461.<br>
Therefore, by controlling the overlying areas between the external and internal ports 38,28, the amount of air stream introducing through the annular space 16 can be adjusted for mixing with a heated air stream in the tubular coupler 10.<br>
Referring to Fig. 10, the adjustable air stream introducing device according to this invention can be applied to a known forage blower 50. The tubular coupler 10 is connected to a primary tube (not shown) of the forage blower 50. Air stream is introduced from the annular space 16 into the coupler 10 to mix with heated air stream from the duct 13 so as to adjust the temperature of the air stream in the blower 50.<br><br>
