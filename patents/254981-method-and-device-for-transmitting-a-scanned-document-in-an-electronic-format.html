				<td>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention describes a method and system for controlling usage of a scanner attached to a Multifunctional Functional Peripheral (MFP). According to the proposed method, a keyword-defining sheet is stored in the memory of MFP. The keyword-defining sheet is printed on receiving a request through a user interface. The user fills the keyword-defining sheet with keyword(s) to be defined in the MFP. The filled keyword defining sheet is scanned by the scanner to extract the defined keywords. The extracted defined keywords are stored in a defined keyword list in the memory of the MFP. The user can make a group(s) of defined keywords through the user interface by selecting one or more defined keywords from the defined keyword list. The user can map functions, such as, scan to email, scan to fax and the like to the made group. The user can also apply controls on the function(s) mapped to the made group.<br>
A document to be scanned is inserted in the scanner and a function to be performed on the scanned data is selected by a user. The scanner scans the document and the keywords present in the scanned data are extracted. The selected function is performed on the scanned data if the extracted keywords map on to the keywords defined in the predefined group that is associated with the selected function.<br>
Accordingly this invention explains a method for controlling usage of a scanner attached to a multifunctional functional peripheral comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	adding customized keywords through scanning;<br>
(b)	forming groups of scanned keyword through a standard Ul;<br>
(c)	mapping groups to functions, through a standard Ul;<br>
(d)	mapping control operations performed on functions, through a standard Ul; and<br>
(e)	performing the mapped control operation whenever a word matches with the keyword stored in the memory of MFP when a scan related function is performed.<br><br>
The said method involves storing a keyword defining sheet in the MFP. The keyword defining sheet is provided with space wherein the keywords are filled. The said step of adding customized keywords through scanning involves printing the said keyword defining sheet on request using a standard Ul. The said step of adding customized keywords through the said step of adding customized keywords through scanning involves storing the extracted keywords in the memory of MFP. The said step of forming groups of scanned keyword through a standard Ul involves entering a group name.<br>
The said step of forming groups of scanned keyword through a standard Ul involves selecting keywords from keyword list and adding to the formed groups where the said formed groups are saved in the memory of MFP. The said step of mapping groups to functions through a standard Ul involves selecting particular functions for each group formed. The said step of mapping groups to functions through a standard Ul involves selecting the group names to be mapped with a particular function where the said mapping is saved in the memory of the MFP. The said step of mapping control operations performed on functions, through a standard Ul involves assigning a control operation for a particular function where the said mapping is saved in the memory of the MFP.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The MFPs are mainly used in various business centers where the information differs from one business centre to another and the importance of information is crucial. The main purpose of the proposed invention is to have a control on the operations performed on a MFP which involves the usage of scanner (Scanning /<br><br>
Faxing / Netscan / PcScan / Copying). The Keywords which are generic and are particular to an in-house business centre can be used to control the operations performed on an MFP. Eg: Some Generic Keywords (CONFIDENTIAL, PRIVATE).<br>
The invention provides a method wherein a special sheet (Sheet 1: Keyword Defining Sheet) is stored in the MFP. This Sheet 1 will be printed thorough the request from any standard Ul. The Sheet 1 provides space where in the "KEYWORDS" will be filled. After that the user filled Sheet 1 is scanned and the KEYWORDS are extracted through the OCR and stored in MFP memory, thus customizing the KEYWORDS being stored according to time and business.<br>
Then the Keywords will be classified into GROUPS and can be mapped to the operation being performed and the level of control/security of the operation.<br>
EG:<br>
Groupl:<br>
Keyword 1<br>
Keyword2<br>
Etc<br>
Group2: Keyword3 Keyword4 Etc<br>
For scan2email: Use Group Gruopl<br>
For FAX:	Use Group Group2.<br>
Eg: Control of the operation may vary from sending a copy of data to administrator or block operation or block user or etc and doesn't limit the scope of the invention.<br>
The invention can be thus broken into 4 major parts:<br><br>
1)	Adding customized keywords through scanning.<br>
2)	Forming Groups of scanned keyword through standard Ul.<br>
3)	Mapping groups to Functions, through standard Ul.<br>
4)	Map Control operations performed on Functions, through standard Ul.<br>
Now the above is explained in detail:<br>
Adding customized keywords through scanning: Steps:<br>
1)	Request for Keyword adding sheet (pre-stored sheet where keyword has to be entered) from MFP through standard Ul which will get printed (Fig 1).<br>
2)	Enter the Keyword in Specified locations in the sheet (Fig 2).<br>
3)	Scan sheet and add keywords to MFP.<br>
Forming Groups of scanned keyword through standard Ul (Fig 3) Steps:<br>
1)	Enter Group name.<br>
2)	Select Keyword from Keyword List and add to Group.<br>
3)	Save Group.<br>
Mapping groups to Functions, through standard Ul (Fig 4) Steps:<br>
1)	Select Function (Scan2email/fax/netsacn.etc)<br>
2)	Select Group name to be mapped and save.<br>
Map Control operations performed on Functions, through standard Ul. (Fig 5) Steps:<br>
1)	Select Function (Scan2email/fax/netsacn.etc).<br>
2)	Select Control operation and save.<br>
Working of the invention Steps:<br><br>
1)	Select Function.<br>
2)	Start scanning.<br>
3)	Map for Keywords present in data to the keyword present in scanned data (extracted through OCR) 4) If keyword is present in scanned data perform the mapped control operation.<br>
5) Perform the function.<br>
An example of a Control operation may be blocking the functionality itself or sending a mail copy of scanned data to administrator (the email id of the administrator is pre configured), etc.<br>
Eg: scan2email within the LAN network email id may need less control compared to scan2email for the email ids outside LAN network. Or faxing inside the company numbers or in-house department numbers differs from general fax.<br>
The above-presented description is of the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention. The manner and process of making and using it is in such a full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable to any person skilled in the art to which it pertains to make and use this invention. New embodiments in particular, which also lie within the scope of the invention can be created, in which different details of the different examples can in a purposeful way be combined with one another.<br>
