PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
SUPPORTING FRAMEWORK FOR A FACADE<br>
The invention relates to a supporting framework for a facade formed from flat facade elements, such as glass panes, decorative plates, insulating panels or the like, arranged adjacent to each other.<br>
DE 198 58 497 C2 discloses a supporting framework for a facade consisting of sectional supports on which the facade elements are secured. Fixing screws may be provided for fixing the facade elements to the sectional supports, these fixing screws being in this case screwed into the sectional supports.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a supporting framework of the type mentioned which allows simpler handling for fixing the facade elements.<br>
Accordingly there is provided a supporting framework for a facade formed from flat facade elements such as glass panes, decorative sheets or the like that are arranged adjacent to each other, with sectional supports which comprise retaining bolts arranged parallel with the facade surface and struts perpendicular to the facade surface, wherein the retaining bolts and the struts are essentially flat strips of material particularly of sheets, and wherein at least one of the struts have a projection which is manufactured integral with the strut, and which projects into a plug-in opening in one of the retaining bolts, Characterised in that a retaining device is provided on the projection for fixing the facade element, said device comprises at least one pin- or bolt-shaped component and this component is arranged so that the component is secured by the retaining bolt to the projection of the strut.<br>
The retaining device is supported on the projection, preferably in a retaining groove formed in the projection, into which groove a head of a pin- or bolt-shaped structural element is inserted. The retaining device is positively secured without additional measures by inserting the projection into the plug-in opening. Depending on the design of the retaining groove and the head, tolerances may be equalised so that optimum fixing of the facade elements on the sectional support is possible. The connection of the retaining device to the projection guarantees that no additional fastening elements that could impair the optical impression are visible in the sectional support. The connection of the fastening device in the projection also enables the retaining bolt to be fixed to the strut to give the sectional support with high strength without requiring additional fastening means.<br><br>
In the longitudinal direction of the retaining groove the head is displaceable in the groove so that equalisation of tolerances is easily possible in the plane of the retaining bolt of the sectional support. However, the head may also be capable of swivelling slightly in the retaining groove so that tilting tolerances can also be equalised. The retaining groove and the head may be of a simple design so that they can be easily manufactured. The retaining device is easily fitted on the projection since the head need only be inserted in the retaining groove. The retaining groove is suitably formed in the projection and runs in the plane of the retaining bolt. The retaining groove can be produced in one operation with the strut. The projection with the retaining groove formed in it is in this case suitably produced together with the strut with a circumferential cutting edge, e.g. by laser cutting. Because the groove runs in the plane of the retaining bolt, it is bounded laterally by the walls of the plug-in opening. During assembly the head is inserted in the retaining groove before the strut and retaining bolt are joined together. After the strut and retaining bolt are joined together the retaining groove is sealed on its front sides from the walls of the plug-in opening so that the retaining device is retained on the sectional support. When the retaining device is clamped, the head is pressed against the longitudinal struts of the retaining groove and therefore positively fixed in it. The height of the projection is suitably smaller than the thickness of the retaining bolt, so that the projection does not project onto the side of the retaining bolt facing away from the strut and is not therefore visible from the outside.<br>
The cross-sections of the retaining grooves and the shape of the heads of the structural elements may be designed differently, and in this case standardised pins or bolts, which are available as mass products and are therefore inexpensive, may also be used.<br>
It may be appropriate for the projection to be fixed in the plug-in opening, particularly by welding or gluing. This enables the sectional supports to be easily pre-assembled and fixed on the construction site. This results in simple assembly. To achieve positive fixing of the retaining bolt on the strut in the plane of the fixing bolt, provision is made for the cross-section of the projection to correspond roughly to the cross-section of the plug-in opening.<br>
Embodiments of the invention are explained in the following with reference to the drawing, in which:<br>
Fig. 1   shows a diagrammatic sectional representation through a facade,<br>
3<br><br>
Fig. 2   shows the detail of a sectional support and of the<br>
threaded pin of a fastening device in side view.<br>
Fig. 3   shows a section through a sectional support with a<br>
Fastening device which incorporates the threaded pin from Fig. 2,<br>
Fig. 4   shows a section along line IV-IV in Fig. 3,<br>
Figs. 5 to 7 show side views of thread pins of fastening devices with the associated retaining grooves.<br>
Facade 1 shown in Fig. 1 in a diagrammatical sectional representation consists of glass panes 2, which are secured to a supporting framework. The supporting framework consists of sectional supports 3, which run in the longitudinal direction of facade 1 and are shown cut in Fig. 1. The cut sectional supports 3 shown are connected to each other by sectional supports 3 arranged perpendicularly to them. Sectional supports 3 are constructed from struts 4 which stand vertically on the plane of facade 1 and on which stand retaining bolls 5 which run parallel with the facade plane. Glass panes 2 are secured to retaining bolts 5. Sectional supports 3 are designed T-shaped in the embodiment but other sectional shapes may be formed from struts 4 and retaining bolts 5. Glass panes 5 form a double glazed pane, with a seal 13 arranged in the region of sectional supports 3 between both glass panes 2.<br>
Glass panes 2 facing retaining bolt 5 rest on retaining bolts 5 with their longitudinal sides, with the insertion of an insulation 11. Glass panes 2 are retained on sectional support 3 by means of retaining devices 18, which comprise at least one pin- or bolt-shaped component 36 and are designed as threaded pins 6 in the specific embodiment. Each threaded pin 6 is secured to sectional support 3 and presses by means of a nut screwed onto threaded pin 6 against a clamping washer 8, which clamps the longitudinal sides of outer glass panes 2 against front sides 7 of retaining strips 5 by means of sealing strips 14. To achieve an attractive optical appearance a decorative strip 9 can be arranged in the region of sectional supports 3 on the outwardly directed side of facade 1, which strip fully covers the region of sealing strips 14 and the intervening region of threaded pins 6. An insulation can be provided between glass panes 2 and front sides 7 of retaining strips 5.<br>
4<br><br>
As shown in the front view in Fig. 2, strut 5 is provided with through plug-in opening 10, with a rectangular, square cross-section. Plug-in opening 10 extends vertically to the flat side 32 and opposing front side 7 of retaining bolt 5. Height c of plug-in opening 10, measured perpendicularly to the plane of strut 4, roughly corresponds to thickness e of strut 4 shown in Fig. 4. As Fig. 2 shows, strut 4 is provided with a projection 15, which extends in the plane of strut 4 beyond the longitudinal side 31 of strut 4. Projection 15 has a width b measured in the longitudinal direction of strut 4 which is roughly equal to width a of plug-in opening 10. Projection 15 therefore has a rectangular, in particular square cross-section which corresponds to the cross-section of plug-in opening 10. Projection 15 can then be inserted in plug-in opening 10, which results in a positive fixing of retaining bolt 5 on strut 4 in the plane of retaining bolt 5.<br>
Projection 15 has a height h which is smaller than thickness d of retaining bolt 5 shown in Fig. 3, so that projection 15 does not project from retaining bolt 5 but is arranged fully in plug-in opening 10. As Fig. 2 shows, projection 15 is provided with a retaining groove 16 whose cross-section forms essentially an isosceles triangle. Retaining groove 16 has a slot 45 which opens retaining groove on the side of projection 15 facing away from strut 4. Undercuts 17 are formed on both sides of slot 45 because the width of slot 45 is smaller than the maximum groove width.<br>
In order to secure glass panes 2 to sectional support 3, a fastening device is provided which comprises threaded pin 6 shown in Fig. 2. Threaded pin 6 is rotationally symmetrical and has a conical head 12 which can be inserted in retaining groove 16 and which is fixed to undercuts 17 in its longitudinal direction, i.e. approximately perpendicular to the plane of retaining bolt 5. Threaded pin 6 can be displaced in retaining groove 16 in a predetermined region in the longitudinal direction of retaining groove 16. Projection 15 is formed integral with strut 4. Strut 4 and retaining bolt 5 are cut out from flat strips of material, particularly of sheets. Strut 4 is here provided with a circumferential cutting edge so that it can be cut out from a sheet by laser cutting, for example. Retaining groove 16 is in this case cut out with projection 15 and strut 4 in one operation.<br>
Fig. 3 shows sectional support 3 with glass panes 2 arranged on it, in a section in the longitudinal direction of sectional support 3. Glass panes 2 are secured to sectional supportf by means of a retaining device 18, which support also comprises threaded pin 6. Projection<br>
5<br><br>
15 of strut 5 projects into plug-in opening 10 in retaining bolt 5. Head 12 of threaded pin 6 is arranged in retaining groove 16 of projection 15. As the cross-section in Fig. 4 shows, retaining groove 16 is bounded on its front sides by lateral walls 49 of plug-in opening 10, so that threaded pin 6 can be displaced in the region between both lateral walls 49 of plug-in opening 10 in retaining groove 16.<br>
As sown in Figs. 3 and 4, a threaded sleeve 19, which has an outer hexagon and which acts on a shim 50 on the outside of retaining bolt 5, is screwed onto threaded pin 6. Threaded pin 6 can easily be clamped in retaining groove 16. To fix glass panes 2, clamping washer 8 is provided which presses by means of sealing strips 14 onto the longitudinal sides of outer glass panes 2, and clamps glass panes 2 with the intervening seal 13 against retaining bolt 5. Washer 8 is fixed by means of a nut 20 onto threaded pin 6. Since head 12 is rotationally symmetrical, it may be swivelled in a certain region in groove 16. Both tolerances in the longitudinal direction of retaining groove 16 and angle tolerances in a certain region can then be equalised by means of fastening device 18. However, head 12 may also have lateral walls standing perpendicular to retaining groove 16 and assume the shape of a prism. Threaded pin 6 is therefore retained in retaining groove 16 so it does not twist.<br>
Figs. 3 and 4 show threaded pin 6 as a pin projecting outside throughout the length. A suitable length consists in the fact that the threaded pin only extends as far as the centre of threaded sleeve 19 and a screw is screwed from the outside into threaded sleeve 19.<br>
Figs. 5 to 7 shows embodiments for retaining grooves and heads arranged in them. Fig. 5 shows a threaded pin 6 with a hemispherical head 21, which can be arranged in a retaining groove 24 of projection 15, which groove is semicircular in cross-section. Head 21 may also have the shape of a half-cylinder in order to prevent component 36, designed as threaded pin 6, from twisting.<br>
Head 22, shown in Fig. 6, is of an essentially cylindrical design. It can be arranged in a retaining groove 25 in projection 15, which groove has an essentially rectangular cross-section. Groove 25 has a depth 6, which is smaller than height h of projection 15. Groove base 47 is therefore arranged fully in plug-in opening 10, so that when sectional support 3 is assembled, i.e. with retaining bolt 5 resting on longitudinal side 31, groove 25 is not visible. Groove 25 is bounded laterally by two retaining struts 27 on the side facing away from strut<br>
6<br><br>
4. The outwardly directed upper side of retaining struts 27 is of a rounded design. Head 22 may also be of cuboid design.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 7, head 23 is of cylindrical design and projects into a retaining groove 26, whose groove base 30 is of concave design. Both retaining struts bounding groove 26, which form the undercut on which head 23 is retained in retaining groove 26, are rounded on their outwardly directed side. Head 23 may also be cuboid.<br>
