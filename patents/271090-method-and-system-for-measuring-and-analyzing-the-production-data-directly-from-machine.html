Prior art:<br>
In the present era of rapid industrialization and growing competitive environment, it becomes necessary for every industry to provide a quality product to the customer at reasonable price. In order to achieve this, in the industry, the continuous monitoring and analysis of the manufacturing process and manufacturing product is must. Currently this is done by collecting the production data or by higher end data collection system, which communicates only with CNC Control machines and in conventional machines, by educated personnel physically going to each and every machine in a specific interval and noting it in a manual document. Later this data is feed in the computer for further analysis and taking corrective action accordingly. The Drawbacks of the aforementioned data collection system are as follows:<br>
i.	Higher end data collection system is very expensive and can only communicate<br>
with CNC Controllers.<br>
ii.        There is a huge scope of manipulation, mistakes and time variation.<br>
iii.       All the data cannot be collected for analysis.<br>

Detail description of the invention:<br>
The above, and the other objects, features &amp; advantages of invention will become apparent from following description read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
Referring to figure 1, system for measuring and analyzing the production data directly from machines in accordance to present invention is shown. This system can be connected to all kinds of cyclic production machines, from conventional, manual up to latest CNC control without modification in existing system. This system is online, which collects the actual data directly from the functional output of the machine which decides the quality status. Using internal statistical process control technique to display process capability can be viewed online which helps in getting process capability figures. Online rejection status can be reviewed and online production data can be seen using such system.<br>
The system of the present invention basically utilized for following purposes:<br>
6<br><br>
i.	To establish criteria for suitability and acceptability of existing and new machines<br>
and industrial processes,<br>
ii.        To compare the performance of the machine and quality of product against the standard performance and quality being decided by the user,<br>
iii.       To evaluate suspect machine,<br>
iv.       To evaluate the performance of an machine before and after its repair<br>
v.        To manage &amp; improve the machine performance and processes carried on by such machine to ensure consistency in product quaiity.<br>
As shown in figure 1, the system for measuring and analyzing the production data in accordance to present invention comprises measuring system, processor unit and display unit.<br>
The measuring system is connected to the machines to be analyzed and the processor unit. It mainly consists of plurality of sensors to measure the various parameters of the machines and parameters of the processes carried on by the machine. Such data relating to parameters measured by the measuring system is given to processor unit for the analysis purpose. The data collected using a measuring system is used to control machines and processes carried on by such machines, in estimating the existence of relationship between variables that can affect the outcome of a machine performance and processes and to conduct analytical studies to increase the knowledge about the system of causes and its effect on performance and processes.<br>
The processor unit consists of first memory unit, data receiving unit, comparator and second memory unit. The data receiving unit receives the parameters measured by the measuring system in real time environment. The first memory unit stores the standard values of the parameters, which are provided by the user. The comparator of the processing unit receives data relating to parameters form both data receiving unit as well as first memory unit. Then comparator compares the both data and decides whether parameters measured from the machines and standard parameters provided by the user are same or different and accordingly decides the machine performance and product quality. Such decision taken by the comparator and the data received by data receiving unit are stored in the second memory unit for the<br>
7<br><br>
purpose of future reference for taking any correctional measures. The display unit displays the standard values of said parameters set by the user, measurements taken and recorded by measuring system and decision taken by the comparator. The online display unit helps to the user to view analyzed status of all the machines at a glance.<br>
Now referring to figure 2, method of measuring and analyzing the production data directly from machines is shown in flow diagram form. As per the method firstly the parameters relating to machine and parameters of the process to be carried on by machine are measured. The measured values then stored for the analysis purpose in the memory device. There after the standard values of the parameters and the measured values of the parameters are compared for analyzing the performance of the machines and product quality. From such comparison decision is taken whether the machine performance and product quality are consistently maintained to required standards or not. Then the standard values and measured values of parameters and decision taken in respect of machine performance and product quality are displayed on the display unit.<br>
Now referring to figure 4, which shows flow diagram illustrating method of analyzing the machine performance, product quality and productivity on the basis of ON/OFF period of the machine. One can check the ON/OFF status of the machines for the purpose of analyzing the machines performance as well as operator's workability. Delay done by operator are recorded with date and time to derive operator efficiency and improve productivity. Also variation in machine cycle time is also recorded for machine efficiency, consistency and variation analysis report. Lowest cycle time report of system can be used to set new target.<br>
The implementation of the method and system of present invention ensures that machine is properly tested and calibrated, product conformity is continually assessed and any non¬conforming product can be managed accordingly. It also used to assess the statistical properties of the machine and product quality. It helps in detecting whether failure caused is by machine or personnel.<br>
8<br><br>
Advantages of the system of the present invention:<br>
i. As manpower cost is going high, the prior art data collection and analysis system are very costly. But system of present invention provides the results in very economic way.<br>
ii.     It provides authentic data which can be used for correct corrective action.<br>
iii.    It removes Man dependency.<br>
iv.     It increases the productivity, consistency and overall efficiency.<br>
v.      It allows to overview the status of all machines at a glance.<br>
Industrial Application:<br>
The system of the present invention is applicable to almost all kinds of the industrial machinery and processes. This system can be connected to all kinds of cyclic production machines, from conventional, manual up to latest CNC control without modification in existing system. It establishes criteria for suitability and acceptability of new machines or manufacturing process in the industry. It manages and improves the performance of machine and productivity. Ultimately it leads to growth and development of the industry.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above described embodiments, and various changes may be made, if desired, without departing from the essence or spirit of the invention which can be read from the claims and the entire specification. There is possibility that system of the present invention can be made applicable in the wireless communication network. One can be able to receive the measurement and analysis report through Short Message Services (SMS) on the mobile phone. Also web option can be provided in such system for remote viewing of such reports, so that remedial measures if necessary can be taken by person from remote place. All these changes are also intended to be within technical scope of the present invention.<br>
