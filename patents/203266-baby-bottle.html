				<td>The present invention relates to a baby bottle.<br>
1.	Nature and Objective of the Invention in Brief<br>
The invented baby bottle is designed to enable a baby or infant to suck milk or liquid food from the bottle enjoyably for a lengthy period of time. It is also designed to fit with the different postures in bottlefeeding the baby or with the way the parent or the baby hold the baby bottle in different postures including lying, sitting or standing.<br>
It is designed in such a way that, while the baby is sucking the milk, the milk will always flow down to fill up the neck part of the bottle, thanks to the special features of the invention which take advantage of the different levels between the neck and the body of the bottle.<br>
With the invented baby bottle, it is not necessary to tilt the baby bottle or raise the bottom part of the bottle all the time. The fact that the linking part of the bottle between the neck and the body is at a sloping position which always allow the milk or liquid food from the body of the bottle at the higher level to flow down to the neck at the lower level. As a result, the invention helps lessen the chance that the baby will take air into his/her stomach which could lead to colic or indigestion.<br>
2.	Field of Technology Related to the Invention<br>
Engineering related to baby bottle for babies.<br>
3.	Related Arts and Sciences<br>
A baby bottle is a basic device necessarily used in bottlefeeding babies or infants. There are many improvements and inventions of the styles of baby bottles to give more convenience and to correspond with the actual practice.<br>
However, after studies and tests were conducted on baby bottles available in the market, it was found out that there were still some problems or drawbacks which could be addressed or improved to make the baby bottles easier and more convenient to use.<br>
In bottlefeeding the babies, parents could bottlefeed the babies or allow the babies to suck milk from the bottles on their own. There are many postures which could be used in bottlefeeding: with baby lying down on the floor, with baby sitting on the highchair or with baby cuddled in the parent's arm and with baby standing<br>
In a lying position, bottlefeeding or sucking milk from the conventional cylinder-shaped baby bottle is suitable for this position. Because the nipple and the neck of the baby bottle are facing downwards and its bottom part of the bottle is usually raised, causing the milk to flow evenly into the nipple. The baby bottles of cylinder shape or other shapes are all suitable for bottlefeeding in a lying position.<br>
IA<br><br>
In a sitting position or when the baby was being cuddled in the parent's arm, the level of the nipple and the neck of the baby bottle would normally have to be slightly raised or stay at the same level of the baby's mouth. The conventional cylinder-shaped bottle could well be used for this position.<br>
However, the more the quantity of the milk in the bottle decreases, the higher the bottom part of the bottle has to be raised. Concurrently, the position of the baby has to be adjusted with his/her face looking upwards while the bottom part of the bottle has to be gradually raised in order that the baby could suck milk evenly from the bottle This is rather cumbersome and difficult to maneuver both for the parent and the baby.<br>
For a type of a baby bottle on the U.S. Patent No. 4,676,387 issued to Jim D. Stephenson and Pual C. Dormer, the shape of the bottle is bent with the axis which passed the nipple and the neck of the bottle bisecting the main body of the bottle to form a curve and an angle. This makes it more convenient to bottlefeed the baby than the conventional cylinder-shaped bottle.<br>
However, this type of baby bottle still has some drawbacks to be addressed, particularly when the baby could hold the baby bottle on his/her own. Since the neck of the bottle was rather short, the baby was unable to get a good grip of the bottle Moreover, the fact that the body of the bottle is bent with the bottom part tilted upward caused the wrist of the baby to twist unnaturally. The wrist of the baby would soon fatigue. Consequently, the baby will throw away the baby bottle and may get fed up with sucking milk.<br>
A standing position is suitable for a grownup baby who could hold his/her baby bottle on his/her own without the help of his/her parent. The problem encountered by the baby in this position is similar to the one encountered when the baby is in a sitting position. In a standing position, while the baby could get a good grip of the conventional cylinder-shaped bottle, it is not convenient for him/her to have to raise the bottom part of the bottle all the time and also to lift his/her head upward at the same time In so doing, the milk would fill up to the neck of the bottle while the baby is sucking the milk.<br>
While the baby bottle invented by Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Donner helps making the milk fill up the nipple and the neck of the bottle, it still has some drawbacks. In holding the bottle, the baby has to twist his/her wrist unnaturally, causing his/her wnst to fatigue easily. As a result, the baby will leave the baby bottle or get fed up with sucking milk.<br>
Therefore, it is necessary to design a baby bottle that could fit the different positions in which the parent bottlefeeds the baby or when the baby holds the baby bottle him/herself The bottle must allow the milk to fill up the nipple and the neck of the bottle all the time so that the baby could suck the milk evenly for a lengthy period of time and with enjoyment. Moreover, the baby bottle must help lessen the chance that the baby would take air which could lead to colic or indigestion.<br>
2<br><br><br><br>
The above drawbacks have been overcome by the present invention which provides a novel baby bottle consisting of the following parts:<br>
o	main body of the bottle that has a cylinder shape with the top end open and the<br>
bottom end closed;<br>
o	part of the wall of the bottle that links the main body with the neck of the<br>
bottle has a cylinder shape with both ends open;<br>
o	neck of the bottle has a cylinder shape with both ends open,<br>
o	an angle that is formed when the axis passing the center of the diameter of the<br>
main body is connected with the axis passing the center of the diameter of the<br>
linking wall of the bottle is equal to the angle that is formed when the top part<br>
of the axis passing the center of the diameter of the linking wall is connected<br>
with the axis passing through the center of the diameter of the neck of the<br>
bottle; and<br>
o	top part of the neck of the bottle that is the open end cylinder shape is used for<br>
filling milk or liquid food and for assembling with the nipple and the screw<br>
cover.<br>
3<br><br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided a baby bottle comprising<br>
the main body of the bottle that has a cylinder shape with the top end open and the<br>
bottom end closed;<br>
the part of the wall of the bottle that links the main body with the neck of the<br>
bottle has a cylinder shape with both ends open;<br>
the neck of the bottle has a cylinder shape with both ends open;<br>
the angle that is formed when the axis passing the center of the diameter of the<br>
main body is connected with the axis passing the center of the diameter of the<br>
linking wall of the bottle is equal to the angle that is formed when the top part of<br>
the axis passing the center of the diameter of the linking wall is connected with<br>
the axis passing the center of the diameter of the neck of the bottle; and<br>
the top part of the neck of the bottle that is the end open cylinder shape is used for<br>
filling milk or liquid food and for assembling with the nipple and the screw cover.<br>

closed. The main body of the bottle is connected to the wall of the bottle that links the main<br>
body with the neck of the bottle.<br>
o	The linking wall of the bottle has a cylinder shape with both ends open.<br>
o	The bottom part of the axis passing through the center of the diameter of the linking wall<br>
intersects the top part of the axis passing through the center of the diameter of the main body<br>
of the bottle, forming a curve and an angle of a whose measure ranges from 10 degrees to 90<br>
degrees.<br>
o	The top part of the axis passing through the center of the diameter of the linking wall<br>
intersects the bottom part of the axis passing through the center of the diameter of the neck of<br>
the bottle.<br>
o	The neck of the bottle has a cylinder shape with both ends open.<br>
o	The top part of the axis passing through the center of the diameter of the linking wall<br>
intersects the bottom part of the axis passing through the center of the diameter of the neck of<br>
the bottle, forming a curve and an angle of a whose value ranges from 10 degrees to 90<br>
degrees.<br>
o	It could be seen that the axis passing the center of the diameter of the main body of the bottle<br>
is parallel to the axis passing the center of the diameter of the neck of the bottle.<br>
o	The two axis are at different level (X) and are between 5 milimeters and 50 milimeters apart.<br>
o	The plane on the top of the neck of the bottle is also parallel to the plane of the bottom part of<br>
the bottle.<br>

10<br>
The invented baby bottle is responding to the different positions in which the parents bottlefeed the babies or the different positions in which the babies themselves hold the baby bottles. These positions range from the baby lying down on the floor, sitting on the highchair, or being cuddled in the parent's arm and the baby standing. The invention makes it convenient and comfortable for the parents to hold the bottle when they bottlefeed the babies and also for the babies when they have to hold the bottles by themselves.<br>
The invention is designed in such a way that the milk will always flow down to fill up the neck of the bottle and the nipple by means of the axis passing the center of the diameter of the neck of the bottle and the axis passing the center of the diameter of the main body of the bottle are parallel to each other but are on different levels.<br>
The part of the wall of the bottle that links the neck of the bottle and the main body is in a sloping position. This makes the milk or liquid food flow down from the main body of the bottle at a higher level to the neck of the bottle at a lower level. This also enables the babies to suck the milk or liquid food evenly and enjoyably for a lengthy period of time. As a result, the invented baby bottle helps lessen the chance that the babies will take air into his/her stomach which could lead to colic or indigestion.<br></td>
