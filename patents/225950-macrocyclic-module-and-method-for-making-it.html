CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application Serial No. 10/226,400, filed<br>
August 23, 2002, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application Serial No. 10/071,377,<br>
filed February 7, 2002.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	This invention is related to the fields of organic chemistry and<br>
nanotechnology. In particular, it relates to materials and methods for the preparation of<br>
synthons used to construct macrocyclic module compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	One area of nanotechnology is to develop chemical building blocks from<br>
which hierarchical molecules of predicted properties can be assembled. An approach to<br>
making chemical building blocks or nanostructures begins at the atomic and molecular level<br>
by designing and synthesizing starting materials with highly tailored properties. Precise<br>
control at the atomic level is the foundation for development of rationally tailored synthesis-<br>
structure-property relationships which can provide materials of unique structure and<br>
predictable properties. This approach to nanotechnology is inspired by nature where, for<br>
example, from twenty common amino acids found in natural proteins, more than 105 stable<br>
and unique proteins are made.<br>
[0004]	Nanotechnology has also been described by K. Eric Drexler in Engines of<br>
Creation as "the knowledge and means for designing, fabricating and employing molecular<br>
scale devices by the manipulation and placement of individual atoms and molecules with<br>
precision on the atomic scale." A quest of nanotechnology is to prepare molecular<br>
architectures capable of performing on a nanometer scale functions normally observed for<br>
large-scale constructs. For example, rotaxanes and polyrotaxanes are molecules that are<br>
interlocked, but not chemically bound to one another, which act like nano-machines. In other<br>
examples, carbon nanotubes and similar constructs have been created which may function as<br>
molecular scaffold units, or as transport channels, storage units, or encapsulators for various<br>
atoms and molecules. The use of biological processes is also being studied as an approach to<br><br>
the assembly of non-biological nano-devices. For example, U. S. Patent No. 5,468,851<br>
discloses building various structures from polynucleotide segments.<br>
[0005]	In U.S. Patent No. 5,876,830 an approach to the construction of<br>
macromolecular structures by coupling molecular modules using connectors, spacers, and<br>
binders is described. The modules were adhered to a surface and reacted to form grids or nets<br>
on the surface.<br>
[0006]	International Patent Application WO 01/27028 A1 describes structural sub-<br>
units or synthons which could be used to prepare molecular nanostructures, machines and<br>
devices. Synthons used were closo-carboranes, which are rigid polyhedral structures,<br>
selected for their availability and requisite substitutional control and structural diversity.<br>
[0007]	Some aspects of nanotechnology are described in Chemical Reviews, 1999(7).<br>
[0008]	One field that will benefit from nanotechnology is filtration using membranes.<br>
Conventional membranes used in a variety of separation processes can be made selectively<br>
permeable to various molecular species. The permeation properties of conventional<br>
membranes generally depend on the pathways of transport of species through the membrane<br>
structure. While the diffusion pathway in conventional selectively permeable materials can<br>
be made tortuous in order to control permeation, porosity is not well defined or controlled by<br>
conventional methods. The ability to fabricate regular or unique pore structures of<br>
membranes is a long-standing goal of separation technology.<br>
[0009]	In one example, the formation of selectively permeable membranes of<br>
monomolecular thickness was described by Hendel, et al., Journal of the Amer. Chem. Soc,<br>
1997, 119:6909-18, who reported preparation of calix[6]arenes and their deposition as<br>
Langmuir-Blodgett films on a porous poly[l(trimethylsilyl)-1-propyne] substrate, where the<br>
calix[6]arene molecules are not coupled or bound to each other in the film. A selectively<br>
permeable membrane was described for which the ratio of the normalized flux of helium gas<br>
to nitrogen gas was found to significantly exceed the conventional Graham's law prediction.<br>
[0010]	Resistance to flow of species through a membrane may also be governed by<br>
the flow path length. Resistance can be greatly reduced by using a very thin film as a<br>
membrane, at the cost of reduced mechanical strength of the membrane material.<br>
Conventional membranes may have a barrier thickness of at least one to two hundred<br>
nanometers, and often up to millimeter thickness. In general, a thin film of membrane barrier<br>
material can be deposited on a porous substrate of greater thickness to restore material<br>
strength.<br><br>
[0011]	Membrane separation processes are used to separate components from a fluid<br>
in which atomic or molecular components having sizes smaller than a certain "cut-off" size<br>
can be separated from components of larger size. Normally, species smaller than the cut-off<br>
size are passed by the membrane. The cut-off size may be an approximate empirical value<br>
which reflects the phenomenon that the rate of transport of components smaller than the cut-<br>
off size is merely faster than the rate of transport of larger components. In conventional<br>
pressure-driven membrane separation processes, the primary factors affecting separation of<br>
components are size, charge, and diffusivity of the components in the membrane structure. In<br>
dialysis, the driving force for separation is a concentration gradient, while in electrodialysis<br>
electromotive force is applied to ion selective membranes.<br>
[0012]	Thus, what is needed is an approach to making chemical building blocks or<br>
nanostructures from starting materials with tailored properties.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

made from three to about twenty-four cyclic synthons. The synthons of the macrocyclic<br>
module composition form a closed ring.<br>
[0014]	In some variations, a macrocyclic module composition may include functional<br>
groups for coupling to other macrocyclic modules. A composition may include two or more<br>
closed rings coupled together.<br>
[0015]	In other variations, one or more functional groups may be coupled to one or<br>
more of the cyclic synthons of a macrocyclic module composition, the functional group(s)<br>
located at the pore of the composition, where the macrocyclic module composition may have<br>
a first pore dimension in a first conformation when a first group of substituents is located at<br>
the pore and a second pore dimension in a second conformation when a second group of<br>
substituents is located at the pore.<br>
[0016]	In further variations, a composition may include a closed ring, a functional<br>
group coupled to the closed ring at the pore, and a selected species to be transported through<br>
the pore.<br>
[0017]	In another aspect, a method is provided to make a composition to transport<br>
selected species through the composition, by selecting a first cyclic synthon substituted with<br>
at least one functional group and selecting from two to about twenty-three additional cyclic<br>
synthons, then incorporating the cyclic synthons into a macrocyclic module composition in<br><br>
which the functional group of the first cyclic synthon is located at the pore of the<br>
composition.<br>
[0018]	In one variation, a macrocyclic module composition may be coupled to a solidsupport.<br>
[0019]	In one aspect, a macrocyclic module composition is provided having from<br>
three to twenty-four cyclic synthons forming a closed ring of cyclic synthons which retains<br>
film area after a period of time on a Langmuir trough.<br>
[0020]	In another aspect, a linkage is formed between coupled cyclic synthons.<br>
[0021]	In another aspect, a method for making a macrocyclic module composition is<br>
provided wherein a plurality of a first cyclic synthon is contacted with a plurality of a second<br>
cyclic synthon, and the macrocyclic module composition is isolated therefrom. A linker<br>
molecule may be contacted with the mixture of synthons.<br>
[0022]	In another variation, a method for making a macrocyclic module composition<br>
is provided wherein a plurality of a first cyclic synthon is contacted with a plurality of a<br>
second cyclic synthon, and a plurality of the first cyclic synthon is contacted with the<br>
mixture. The first cyclic synthon may be supported on a solid phase.<br>
[0023]	In another variation, a method for making a macrocyclic module composition<br>
is provided wherein a plurality of a first cyclic synthon is contacted with a plurality of a<br>
second cyclic synthon, and a plurality of a third cyclic synthon is contacted with the mixture.<br>
The first cyclic synthon may be supported on a solid phase.<br>
[0024]	In another variation, a method for making a macrocyclic module includes a<br>
template for bringing together synthons.<br>

[0040]	As used herein, the terms "coupling" and "coupled" with respect to molecular<br>
moieties or species, molecules, synthons, and macrocyclic modules refers to their attachment<br>
or association with other molecular moieties or species, atoms, molecules, synthons, or<br>
macrocyclic modules, whether the attachment or association is specific or non-specific,<br>

alkynyl, (-C≡C-), and halo (F, Cl, Br and I) groups.<br>
[0042]	As used herein, the term "synthon" refers to a molecule used to make a<br>
macrocyclic module. A synthon may be substantially one isomeric configuration, for<br>
example, a single enantiomer. A synthon may be substituted with functional groups which<br>
are used to couple a synthon to another synthon or synthons, and which are part of the<br>
synthon. A synthon may be substituted with an atom or group of atoms which are used to<br><br>
impart hydrophilic, lipophilic, or amphiphilic character to the synthon or to species made<br>
from the synthon. A synthon may be substituted with an atom or group of atoms to form one<br>
or more functional groups on the synthon which may be used to couple the synthon to another<br>
synthon or synthons. The synthon before being substituted with functional groups or groups<br>
used to impart hydrophilic, lipophilic, or amphiphilic character may be called the core<br>
synthon. As used herein, the term "synthon" refers to a core synthon, and also refers to a<br>
synthon substituted with functional groups or groups used to impart hydrophilic, lipophilic, or<br>
amphiphilic character.<br>
[0043]	As used herein, the term "cyclic synthon" refers to a synthon having one or<br>
more ring structures. Examples of ring structures include aryl, heteroaryl, and cyclic<br>
hydrocarbon structures including bicyclic ring structures and multicyclic ring structures.<br>
Examples of core cyclic synthons include, but are not limited to, benzene, cyclohexadiene,<br>
cyclopentadiene, naphthalene, anthracene, phenylene, phenanthracene, pyrene, triphenylene,<br>
phenanthrene, pyridine, pyrimidine, pyridazine, biphenyl, bipyridyl, cyclohexane,<br>
cyclohexene, decalin, piperidine, pyrrolidine, morpholine, piperazine, pyrazolidine,<br>
quinuclidine, tetrahydropyran, dioxane, tetrahydrothiophene, tetrahydrofuran, pyrrole,<br>
cyclopentane, cyclopentene, triptycene, adamantane, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane,<br>
bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, bicyclo[2.2.2]octene, bicycio[3.3.0]octane,<br>
bicyclo[3.3.0]octene, bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, bicyclo[3.3.1]nonene, bicyclo[3.2.2]nonane,<br>
bicyclo[3.2.2]nonene, bicyclo[4.2.2]decane, 7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane,<br>
1,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, and spiro[4.4]nonane. A core synthon comprises all isomers<br>
or arrangements of coupling the core synthon to other synthons. For example, the core<br>
synthon benzene includes synthons such as 1,2- and 1,3-substituted benzenes, where the<br>
linkages between synthons are formed at the 1,2- and 1,3- positions of the benzene ring,<br>
respectively. For example, the core synthon benzene includes 1,3-substituted synthons such<br><br>
benzene ring may also have substituents. A condensed linkage between synthons involves a<br>
direct coupling between a ring atom of one cyclic synthon to a ring atom of another cyclic<br>
synthon, for example, where synthons M-X and M-X couple to form M-M, where M is a<br>
cyclic synthon and X is halogen; as for example when M is phenyl resulting in the condensed<br><br><br>
[0044]	As used herein, the term "activated acid" refers to a -C(O)X moiety, where X<br>
is a leaving group, in which the X group is readily displaced by a nucleophile to form a<br>
covalent bond between the -C(O)- and the nucleophile. Examples of activated acids include<br>
acid chlorides, acid fluorides, p-nitrophenyl esters, pentafluorophenyl esters, and<br>
N-hydroxysuccinimide esters.<br>
[0045]	As used herein, the term "amino acid residue" refers to the product formed<br>
when a species comprising at least one amino (-NH2) and at least one carboxyl (-C(O)O-)<br>
group couples through either of its amino or carboxyl groups with an atom or functional<br>
group of a synthon. Whichever of the amino or carboxyl groups is not involved in the<br>
coupling may be blocked with a removable protective group.<br>
Macrocyclic Modules<br>
[0046]	A macrocyclic module is a closed ring of coupled synthons. To make a<br>
macrocyclic module, synthons may be substituted with functional groups to couple the<br>
synthons to form a macrocyclic module. Synthons may also be substituted with functional<br>
groups which will remain in the structure of the macrocyclic module. Functional groups<br>
which remain in the macrocyclic module may be used to couple the macrocyclic module to<br>
other macrocyclic modules.<br>
[0047]	A macrocyclic module may contain from three to about twenty-four cyclic<br>
synthons. In the closed ring of a macrocyclic module, a first cyclic synthon may be coupled<br>
to a second cyclic synthon, the second cyclic synthon may be coupled to a third cyclic<br>
synthon, the third cyclic synthon may be coupled to a fourth cyclic synthon, if four cyclic<br>
synthons are present in the macrocyclic module, the fourth to a fifth, and so on, until an nth<br>
cyclic synthon may be coupled to its predecessor, and the nth cyclic synthon may be coupled<br>
to the first cyclic synthon to form a closed ring of cyclic synthons. In one variation, the<br>
closed ring of the macrocyclic module may be formed with a linker molecule.<br>
[0048]	A macrocyclic module may be an amphiphilic macrocyclic module when<br>
hydrophilic and lipophilic functional groups exist in the structure. The amphiphilic character<br>
of a macrocyclic module may arise from atoms in the synthons, in the linkages between<br>
synthons, or in functional groups coupled to the synthons or linkages.<br>
[0049]	In some variations, one or more of the synthons of a macrocyclic module may<br>
be substituted with one or more lipophilic moieties, while one or more of the synthons may<br>
be substituted with one or more hydrophilic moieties, thereby forming an amphiphilic<br>
macrocyclic module. Lipophilic and hydrophilic moieties may be coupled to the same<br>
synthon or linkage in an amphiphilic macrocyclic module. Lipophilic and hydrophilic<br><br>
moieties may be coupled to the macrocyclic module before or after formation of the closed<br>
ring of the macrocyclic module. For example, lipophilic or hydrophilic moieties may be<br>
added to the macrocyclic module after formation of the closed ring by substitution of a<br>
synthon or linkage.<br>
[0050]	The amphiphilicity of a macrocyclic module may be characterized in part by<br>
its ability to form a stable Langmuir film. A Langmuir film may be formed on a Langmuir<br>
trough at a particular surface pressure measured in milliNewtoniS per meter (mN/m) with a<br>
particular barrier speed measured in millimeters per minute (mm/min), and the isobaric creep<br>
or change in film area at constant surface pressure can be measured to characterize stability<br>
of the film. For example, a stable Langmuir film of macrocyclic modules on a water<br>
subphase may have an isobaric creep at 5-15 mN/m such that the majority of the film area is<br>
retained over a period of time of about one hour. Examples of stable Langmuir films of<br>
macrocyclic modules on a water subphase may have isobaric creep at 5-15 mN/m such that<br>
about 70% of the film area is retained over a period of time of about 30 minutes, sometimes<br>
about 70% of the film area is retained over a period of time of about 40 minutes, sometimes<br>
about 70% of the film area is retained over a period of time of about 60 minutes, and<br>
sometimes about 70% of the film area is retained over a period of time of about 120 minutes.<br>
Other examples of stable Langmuir films of macrocyclic modules on a water subphase may<br>
have isobaric creep at 5-15 mN/m such that about 80% of the film area is retained over a<br>
period of time of about thirty minutes, sometimes about 85% of the film area is retained over<br>
a period of time of about thirty minutes, sometimes about 90% of the film area is retained<br>
over a period of time of about thirty minutes, sometimes about 95% of the film area is<br>
retained over a period of time of about thirty minutes, and sometimes about 98% of the film<br>
area is retained over a period of time of about thirty minutes.<br>
[0051]	In one aspect, an individual macrocyclic module may include a pore in its<br>
structure. Each macrocyclic module may define a pore of a particular size, depending on the<br>
conformation and state of the module. Various macrocyclic modules may be prepared which<br>
define pores of different sizes.<br>
[0052]	A macrocyclic module may include a flexibility in its structure. Flexibility<br>
may permit a macrocyclic module to more easily form linkages with other macrocyclic<br>
modules by coupling reactions. Flexibility of a macrocyclic module may also play a role in<br>
regulating passage of species through the pore of the macrocyclic module. For example,<br>
flexibility may affect the dimension of the pore of an individual macrocyclic module since<br>
various conformations may be available to the structure. For example, the macrocyclic<br><br>
module may have a certain pore dimension in one conformation when no substituents are<br>
located at the pore, and the same macrocyclic module may have a different pore dimension in<br>
another conformation when one or more substituents of that macrocycle are located at the<br>
pore. Likewise, a macrocyclic module may have a certain pore dimension in one<br>
conformation when one group of substituents are located at the pore, and have a different<br>
pore dimension in a different conformation when a different group of substituents are located<br>
at the pore. For example, the "one group" of substituents located at the pore may be three<br>
alkoxy groups arranged in one regioisomer, while the "different group" of substituents may<br>
be two alkoxy groups arranged in another regioisomer. The effect of the "one group" of<br>
substituents located at the pore and the "different group" of substituents located at the pore is<br>
to provide a macrocyclic module composition which may regulate transport and filtration, in<br>
conjunction with other regulating factors.<br>
[0053]	In making macrocyclic modules from synthons, the synthons may be used as a<br>
substantially pure single isomer, for example, as a pure single enantiomer.<br>
[0054]	In making macrocyclic modules from synthons, one or more coupling linkages<br>
are formed between adjacent synthons. The linkage formed between synthons may be the<br>
product of the coupling of one functional group on one synthon to a complementary<br>
functional group on a second synthon. For example, a hydroxyl group of a first synthon may<br>
couple with an acid group or acid halide group of a second synthon to form an ester linkage<br>
between the two synthons. Another example is an imine linkage, -CH=N-, resulting from the<br>
reaction of an aldehyde, -CH=O, on one synthon with an amine, -NH2, on another synthon.<br>
Examples of complementary functional groups and linkages between synthons are shown in<br>
Table 1.<br>
Table 1: Examples of functional groups of synthons and synthon linkages<br><br>
Functional Group A	Functional Group B	Linkage Formed<br>
-NH2	-C(O)H	-N=CH-<br>
-NH2	-CO2H	-NHC(O)-<br>
-NHR	-CO2H	-NRC(O)-<br>
-OH	-CO2H	-OC(O)-<br>
-X	-O Na	-O-<br>
-SH	-SH	-S-S-<br>
-X	-(NR)Li	-NR-<br>
-X	-S Na	-S-<br><br><br><br><br>
[0055]	In Table 1, R and R' represent hydrogen or a functional group, and X is<br>
halogen or other good leaving groups.<br>
[0056]	In another variation, a macrocyclic module may have functional groups for<br>
coupling to other macrocyclic modules which "were coupled to the macrocyclic module after<br>
initial preparation of the closed ring. For example, an imine linkage of a macrocyclic module<br>
may be substituted with one of various functional groups to produce additional macrocyclic<br>
modules. Examples of linkages between synthons having functional groups for coupling<br>
macrocyclic modules are shown in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
[0057]	In Table 2, X is halogen, and Q1 and Q2 are independently selected synthons<br>
which are part of a module.<br>
[0058]	The functional groups of synthons used to form linkages between synthons or<br>
other macrocyclic modules may be separated from the synthon by a spacer. A spacer can be<br>
any atom or group of atoms which couples the functional group to the synthon, and does not<br>
interfere with the linkage-forming reaction. A spacer is part of the functional group, and<br>
becomes part of the linkage between synthons. An example of a spacer is a methylene group,<br>
-CH2-. The spacer may be said to extend the linkage between synthons. For example, if one<br>
methylene spacer were inserted in an imine linkage, -CH=N-, the resulting inline linkage may<br>
be-CH2CH=N-.<br>
[0059]	A linkage between synthons may also contain one or more atoms provided by<br>
an external moiety other than the two functional groups of the synthons. An external moiety<br>
may be a linker molecule which may couple with the functional group of one synthon to form<br>
an intermediate which couples with a functional group on another synthon to form a linkage<br>
between the synthons, such as, for example, to form a closed ring of synthons from a series of<br>
coupled synthons. An example of a linker molecule is formaldehyde. For example, amino<br>
groups on two synthons may undergo Mannich reaction in the presence of formaldehyde as<br>
the linker molecule to produce the linkage -NHCH2NH-.<br><br>
[0060]	In one variation, a macrocyclic module may be a closed ring composition of<br>
the formula:<br><br>
wherein:<br>
the closed ring comprises a total of from three to twenty-four synthons Q; J is 2-23;<br>
Q1 are synthons each independently selected from the group consisting of (a) aryl synthons,<br>
(b) heteroaryl synthons, (c) saturated cyclic hydrocarbon synthons, (d) unsaturated<br>
cyclic hydrocarbon synthons, (e) saturated bicyclic hydrocarbon synthons, (f)<br>
unsaturated bicyclic hydrocarbon synthons, (g) saturated multicyclic hydrocarbon<br>
synthons, and (h) unsaturated multicyclic hydrocarbon synthons; wherein ring<br>
positions of each Q1 which are not coupled to a linkage L are substituted with<br>
hydrogen or functional groups containing atoms selected from the group of C, H, N,<br>
O, Si, P, S, B, Al, halogens, and metals from the alkali and alkaline earth groups;<br>
Q2 is a synthon independently selected from the group consisting of (a) aryl synthons,<br>

cyclic hydrocarbon synthons, (e) saturated bicyclic hydrocarbon synthons, (f)<br>
unsaturated bicyclic hydrocarbon synthons, (g) saturated multicyclic hydrocarbon<br>
synthons, and (h) unsaturated multicyclic hydrocarbon synthons; wherein ring<br>
positions of Q2 which are not coupled to an L are substituted with hydrogen or<br>
functional groups containing atoms selected from the group consisting of C, H, N, O,<br>
Si, P, S, B, Al, halogens, and metals from the alkali and alkaline earth groups;<br>
L are linkages between the synthons each independently selected from the group consisting<br>
of synthon-synthon, -NRC(O)-, -OC(O)-, -O-, -S-S-, -S-, -NR-, -(CRR')P-,<br>

-CH(OH)CH2NH-, -CH(OH)CH2-, -CH(OH)C(CH3)2C(O)O,<br><br><br><br><br>
wherein p is 1 -6;<br>
wherein R and R' are each independently selected from the group of hydrogen and<br>
alkyl;<br>
wherein the linkages L are each independently configured with respect to the Q1 and Q2<br>
synthons, each L having either of its two possible configurations with respect to the synthons<br>
it couples together, the forward and reverse configurations of the linkage with respect to the<br>
immediately adjacent synthons to which it couples, for example, Q1a-NHC(O)- Q1b and<br>
Q1a-C(O)NH- Q1b, if the two configurations are isomerically different structures. Synthons<br>
Q1, when independently selected, may be any cyclic synthon as described, so that the J<br>
synthons Q1 may be found in the closed ring in any order, for example, cyclohexyl--1,2-<br>
phenyl-piperidinyl--1,2-phenyl--1,2-phenyl-- cyclohexyl, and so on, and the J linkages L<br>
may also be independently selected and configured in the closed ring. The macrocyclic<br>
modules represented and encompassed by the formula include ail stereoisomers of the<br><br>
synthons involved, so that a wide variety of stereoisomers of the macrocyclic module are<br>
included for each closed ring composition of synthons.<br>
[0061]	A macrocyclic module may include functional groups for coupling the<br>
macrocyclic module to a solid surface, substrate, or support. Examples of functional groups<br>
of macrocyclic modules which can be used to couple to a substrate or surface include amine,<br>
carboxylic acid, carboxylic ester, benzophenone and other light activated crosslinkers,<br>
alcohol, glycol, vinyl, styryl, olefin styryl, epoxide, thiol, magnesium halo or Grignard,<br>
acrylate, acrylamide, diene, aldehyde, and mixtures thereof. These functional groups may be<br>
coupled to the closed ring of the macrocyclic module, and may optionally be attached by a<br>
spacer group. Examples of solid surfaces include metal surfaces, ceramic surfaces, polymer<br>
surfaces, semiconductor surfaces, silicon wafer surfaces, alumina surfaces, and so on.<br>
Examples of functional groups of macrocyclic modules which can be used to couple to a<br>
substrate or surface further include those described in the left hand column of Tables 1 and 2.<br>
Methods of initiating coupling of the modules to the substrate include chemical, thermal,<br>
photochemical, electrochemical, and irradiative methods.<br>
[0062]	Examples of spacer groups include polyethylene oxides, polypropylene<br>
oxides, polysaccharides, polylysines, polypeptides, poly(amino acids), polyvinylpyrrolidones,<br>
polyesters, polyvinylchlorides, polyvinylidene fluorides, polyvinylalcohols, polyurethanes.<br>
polyamides, polyimides, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polysulfonamides, and<br>
polysulfoxides.<br>
[0063]	A substrate may have functional groups which couple to the macrocyclic<br>
modules. The functional groups of the substrate may be surface groups or linking groups<br>
bound to the substrate, which may be formed by reactions which bind the surface groups or<br>
linking groups to the substrate. Surface groups may also be created on the substrate by a<br>
variety of treatments such as cold plasma treatment, surface etching methods, solid abrasion<br>
methods, or chemical treatments. Some methods of plasma treatment are given in Inagaki.<br>
Plasma Surface Modification and Plasma Polymerization, Technomic, Lancaster,<br>
Pennsylvania, 1996. The functional groups of the macrocyclic modules and the surface may<br>
be blocked with protecting groups until needed. In one variation, a photoreactive group such<br>
as a benzophenone group is bound to the surface or substrate. The photoreactive group may<br>
be activated with light, for example, ultraviolet light to provide a reactive species which<br>
couples to a macrocyclic module.<br>
[0064]	Examples of modules useful as building blocks are shown in Table 3.<br><br><br><br><br>
Macrocyclic Module Pores<br>
[0065]	An individual macrocyclic module may include a pore in its structure. The<br>
size of the pore may determine the size of molecules or other species which can pass through<br>
the macrocyclic module. The size of a pore in a macrocyclic module may depend on the<br>
structure of the synthons used to make the macrocyclic module, the linkages between<br>
synthons, the number of synthons in a module, the structure of any linker molecules used to<br>
make the macrocyclic module, and other structural features of the macrocyclic module<br>
whether inherent in the preparation of the macrocyclic module or added in later steps or<br>
modifications. Stereoisomerism of macrocyclic modules may also be used to regulate the<br>
size of a pore of a macrocyclic module by variation of the stereoisomer of each synthon used<br>
to prepare the closed ring of the macrocyclic module.<br>
[0066]	The dimension of a pore in a macrocyclic module may be varied by changing<br>
the combination of synthons used to form the macrocyclic module, or by varying the number<br>
of synthons in the closed ring. The dimension of a pore may also be varied by substituents on<br>
the synthons or linkages. The pore may therefore be made large enough or small enough to<br>
achieve an effect on transport of species through the pore. Species which may be transported<br>
through the pore of a macrocyclic module include atoms, molecules, biomolecules, ions,<br>
charged particles, and photons.<br><br>
[0067]	The size of a species may not be the sole determinant of whether it will be able<br>
to pass through a pore of a macrocyclic module. Groups or moieties located in or near the<br>
pore structure of a macrocyclic module may regulate or affect transport of a species through<br>
the pore by various mechanisms. For example, transport of a species through the pore may<br>
be affected by groups of the macrocyclic module which interact with the species, by ionic or<br>
other interaction, such as chelating groups, or by complexing the species. For example, a<br>
charged group such as a carboxylate anion or ammonium group may couple an oppositely-<br>
charged species and affect its transport. Substiruents of synthons in a macrocyclic module<br>
may affect the passage of a species through the pore of the macrocyclic module. Groups of<br>
atoms which render the pore of a macrocyclic module more or less hydrophilic or lipophilic<br>
may affect transport of a species through the pore. An atom or group of atoms may be<br>
located within or proximate to a pore to sterically slow or block the passage of a species<br>
through the pore. For example, hydroxyl or alkoxy groups may be coupled to a cyclic<br>
synthon and located in the pore of the structure of the macrocyclic module, or may be<br>
coupled to a linkage between synthons and located in the pore. A wide range of functional<br>
groups may be used to sterically slow or block the passage of a species through the pore,<br>
including functional groups containing atoms selected from the group consisting of C, H, N,<br>
O, Si, P, S, B, Al, halogens, and metals from the alkali and alkaline earth groups. Blocking<br>
and slowing passage of a species through the pore may involve reducing the dimension of the<br>
pore by steric blocking, as well as slowing the passage of species by creating a path through<br>
the pore which is not linear, and providing interaction between the functional group and the<br>
species to slow transport. The stereochemical structure of the portion of the macrocyclic<br>
module which defines the pore and its interior may also affect transport. Any groups or<br>
moieties which affect transport of a species through the pore of a macrocyclic module may be<br>
introduced as part of the synthons used to prepare the macrocyclic module, or may be added<br>
later by various means. For example, S7-1 could be reacted with<br>
CIC(O)(CH2)2C(O)OCHCH3 to convert the phenol groups to succinyl ester groups. Further,<br>
molecular dynamical motion of the synthons and linkages of a partly flexible macrocyclic<br>
module may affect transport of a species through the pore of the module. Transport behavior<br>
may not be described solely by the structure of the macrocyclic module itself since the<br>
presence of the species which is to be transported through the pore affects the flexibility,<br>
conformation, and dynamical motions of a macrocyclic module. In general, solvent may also<br>
affect transport of solutes through a pore.<br><br>
[0068]	Macrocyclic modules and arrays of macrocyclic modules may be useful in size<br>
exclusion separations, ion separation, gas separation, separation of enantiomers, small<br>
molecule separation, water purification, filtration of bacteria, fungi, or viruses, sewage<br>
treatment, and toxin removal, among other uses.<br>

Methods to Prepare Cyclic Synthons<br>
[0072]	To avoid the need to separate single configurational or enantiomeric isomers<br>
from complex mixtures resulting from non-specific reactions, stereospecific or at least<br>
stereoselective coupling reactions may be employed in the preparation of the synthons of this<br>
invention. The following are examples of synthetic schemes for several classes of synthons<br>
useful in the preparation of macrocyclic modules of this invention. In general, the core<br>
synthons are illustrated, and lipophilic moieties are not shown on the structures, however, it is<br>
understood that all of the following synthetic schemes might encompass additional lipophilic<br>
or hydrophilic moieties used to prepare amphiphilic and other modified macrocyclic modules.<br>
Species are numbered in relation to the scheme in which they appear; for example, "S1-1"<br>
refers to the structure 1 in Scheme 1.<br><br>
[0073]	An approach to preparing synthons of 1,3-Diaminocyclohex-5-ene is shown in<br>
Scheme 1. Enzymatically assisted partial hydrolysis of the<br><br>
SCHEME 1<br>
[0074]	symmetrical diester S1-1 is used to give enantiomerically pure S1-2. S1-2 is<br>
subjected to the Curtius reaction and then quenched with benzyl alcohol to give protected<br>
amino acid S1-3. Iodolactonization of carboxylic acid S1-4 followed by<br>
dehydrohalogenation gives unsaturated lactone S1-6. Opening of the lactone ring with<br>
sodium methoxide gives alcohol S1-7, which is converted with inversion of configuration to<br>
S1-8 in a one-pot reaction involving mesylation, SN2 displacement with azide, reduction and<br>
protection of the resulting amine with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate. Epimerization of S1-8 to the<br>
more stable diequatorial configuration followed by saponification gives carboxylic acid S1-<br>
10. S1-10 is subjected to the Curtius reaction. A mixed anhydride is prepared using ethyl<br>
chloroformate followed by reaction with aqueous NaN3 to give the acyl azide, which is<br><br>
thermally rearranged to the isocyanate in refluxing benzene. The isocyanate is quenched with<br>
2-trimethylsilylethanol to give differentially protected tricarbamate S1-11. Reaction with<br>
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) selectively deprotects the 1,3-diamino groups to provide the<br>
desired synthon S1-12.<br>
[0075]	In another variation, an approach to preparing synthons of 1,3-<br>
Diaminocyclohexane is shown in Scheme la.<br><br>
SCHEME 1a<br>
[0076]	Some aspects of these preparations are given in Suami et al., J. Org. Chem.<br>
1975, 40, 456 and Kavadias et al. Can. J. Chem. 1978, 56, 404.<br>
[0077]	In another variation, an approach to preparing synthons of 1,3-substituted<br>
cyclohexane is shown in Scheme 1b.<br><br><br>
[0078]	This synthon will remain "Z-protected" until the macrocyclic module has been<br>
cyclized. Subsequent deprotection to yield a macrocyclic module with amine functional<br>
groups is done by a hydrogenation protocol.<br>
[0079]	Norbornanes (bicycloheptanes) may be used to prepare synthons of this<br>
invention, and stereochemically controlled multifunctionalization of norbornanes can be<br>
achieved. For example, Diels-Alder cycloaddition may be used to form norbornanes<br>
incorporating various functional groups having specific, predictable stereochemistry.<br>
Enantiomericalty enhanced products may also be obtained through the use of appropriate<br>
reagents, thus limiting the need for chiral separations.<br>
[0080]	An approach to preparing synthons of 1,2-Diammonorbornane is shown in<br>
Scheme 2. 5-(Benzyloxy-methyl)-1,3-cyclopentadiene (S2-13) is reacted with<br><br><br>
SCHEME 2<br>
diethylaluminum chloride Lewis acid complex of di-(l)-menthyl fumarate (S2-14) at low<br>
temperature to give the diastereomerically pure norbornene S2-15. Saponification with<br>
potassium hydroxide in aqueous ethanol gives the diacid S2-16, which is subjected to a<br>
tandem Curtius reaction with diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA), the reaction product is<br>
quenched with 2-trimethylsilylethanol to give the biscarbamate S2-17. Deprotection with<br>
TFA gives diamine S2-18.<br>
[0081]	Another approach to this synthon class is outlined in Scheme 3. Opening of<br>
anhydride S3-19 with methanol in the presence of quinidine gives the enantiomerically pure<br>
ester acid S3-20. Epimerization of the ester group with sodium methoxide (NaOMe) gives<br>
S3-21. A Curtius reaction with DPPA followed by quenching with trimethylsilylethanol<br>
gives carbamate S3-22. Saponification with NaOH gives the acid S3-23, which undergoes a<br>
Curtius reaction,<br><br><br>
SCHEME 3<br>
then quenched with benzyl alcohol to give differentially protected biscarbamate S3-24.<br>
Compound S3-24 can be fully deprotected to provide the diamine or either of the carbamates<br>
can be selectively deprotected.<br>
[0082]	An approach to preparing synthons of endo,endo-1,3-Diaminonorbornane is<br>
shown in Scheme 4. 5-Trimethylsilyl-l,3-cyclopentadiene (S4-25) is reacted with the<br>
diethylaluminum chloride Lewis acid complex of di-(l)-menthyl fumarate at low temperature<br>
to give nearly diastereomerically pure norbornene S4-26. Crystallization of S4-26 from<br>
alcohol results in recovery of greater than 99% of the single diastereomer.<br>
Bromolactonization followed by silver mediated rearrangement gives mixed diester S4-28<br>
with an alcohol moiety at the 7-position. Protection of the alcohol with benzyl bromide and<br>
selective deprotection of the methyl ester gives the free carboxylic acid S4-30. A Curtius<br>
reaction results in trimethylsilylethyl carbamate norbornene S4-31. Biscarbonylation of the<br>
olefin in methanol, followed by a single-step deprotection and dehydration gives the mono-<br>
anhydride S4-33. Quinidine mediated opening of the anhydride with methanol gives S4-34.<br>
Curtius transformation of S4-34 gives the biscarbamate S4-35, which is deprotected with<br>
TFA or tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) to give diamine S4-36.<br><br><br>
SCHEME 4<br>
[0083]	Another approach to this class of synthons is outlined in Scheme 5. Benzyl<br>
alcohol opening of S3-19 in the presence of quinidine gives S5-37 in high enantiomeric<br>
excess. Iodolactonization followed by NaBH4 reduction gives lactone S5-39. Treatment with<br>
NaOMe liberates the methyl ester and the free alcohol to generate S5-40. Transformation of<br>
the alcohol S5-40 to the inverted r-butyl carbamate protected amine S5-41 is accomplished in<br>
a one-pot reaction by azide deplacement of the mesylate S5-40 followed by reduction to the<br>
amine, which is protected with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate. Hydrogenolytic cleavage of the<br>
benzyl ester and epimerization of the methyl ester to the exo configuration is followed by<br>
protection of the free acid with benzyl bromide to give S5-44. Saponification of the methyl<br>
ester followed by a trimethylsilylethanol quenched Curtius reaction<br><br><br>
gives the biscarbamate S5-46, which is cleaved with TFA to give the desired diamine S5-47.<br>
[0084]	An approach to preparing synthons of exo, endo-1,3-Diaminonorbornane is<br>
shown in Scheme 6. p-Methoxybenzyl alcohol opening of norbornene anhydride S3-19 in<br>
the presence of quinidine gives monoester S6-48 in high enantiomeric excess. Curtius<br>
reaction of the free acid gives protected all endo monoacid-monoamine S6-49.<br>
Biscarbonylation and anhydride formation gives exo-monoanhydride S6-51. Selective<br>
methanolysis in the presence of quinine gives S6-52. A trimethylsilylethanol quenched<br>
Curtius reaction gives biscarbamate S6-53. Epimerization of the two esters results in the more<br>
sterically stable S6-54. Cleavage of the carbamate groups provides synthon S6-55.<br><br><br>
SCHEME 6<br>
Methods To Prepare Macrocyclic Modules<br>
[0085]	Synthons may be coupled to one another to form macrocyclic modules. In one<br>
variation, the coupling of synthons may be accomplished in a concerted scheme. Preparation<br>
of a macrocyclic module by the concerted route may be performed using, for example, at<br>
least two types of synthons, each type having at least two functional groups for coupling to<br>
other synthons. The functional groups may be selected so that a functional group of one type<br>
of synthon can couple only to a functional group of the other type of synthon. When two<br>
types of synthons are used, a macrocyclic module may be formed having alternating synthons<br>
of different types. Scheme 7 illustrates a concerted module synthesis.<br>
[0086]	Referring to Scheme 7, 1, 2-Diaminocyclohexane, S7-1, is a synthon having<br>
two amino functional groups for coupling to other synthons, and 2,6-diformyl-<br>
4-dodec-1-ynylphenol, S7-2, is a synthon having two formyl groups for coupling to other<br>
synthons. An amino group may couple with a formyl group to form an imine linkage. In<br>
Scheme 7, a concerted product hexamer macrocyclic module is shown.<br>
[0087]	In one variation, a mixture of tetramer, hexamer, and octamer macrocyclic<br>
modules may be formed in the concerted scheme. The yields of these macrocyclic modules<br>
can be varied by changing the concentration of various synthons in the reagent mixture, and<br>
among other factors, by changing the solvent, temperature, and reaction time.<br><br><br>
[0088]	The imine groups of S7-3 can be reduced, e.g. with sodium borohydride, to<br>
give amine linkages. If the reaction is carried out using 2,6-di(chlorocarbonyl)-4-dodec-1-<br>
ynylphenol instead of 2,6-diformyl-4-dodec-1-ynylphenol, the resulting module will contain<br>
amide linkages. Similarly, if 1,2-dihydroxycyclohexane is reacted with 2,6-<br>
di(chlorocarbonyl)-4-dodec-1-ynylphenol, the resulting module will contain ester linkages.<br>
[0089]	In some variations, the coupling of synthons may be accomplished in a<br>
tepwise scheme. In an example of the step wise preparation of macrocyclic modules, a first<br>
type of synthon is substituted with one protected functional group and one unprotected<br>
functional group. A second type of synthon is substituted with an unprotected functional<br>
group that will couple with the unprotected functional group on the first synthon. The<br>
product of contacting the first type of synthon with the second type of synthon may be a<br>
dimer, which is made of two coupled synthons. The second synthon may also be substituted<br>
with another functional group which is either protected, or which does not couple with the<br>
first synthon when the dimer is formed. The dimer may be isolated and purified, or the<br>
preparation may proceed as a one-pot method. The dimer may be contacted with a third<br>
synthon having two functional groups, only one of which may couple with the remaining<br>
functional group of either the first or second synthons to form a trimer, which is made of<br>
three coupled synthons. Such stepwise coupling of synthons may be repeated to form<br>
macrocyclic modules of various ring sizes. To cyclize or close the ring of the macrocyclic<br>
module, the nth synthon which was coupled to the product may be substituted with a second<br>
functional group which may couple with the second functional group of a previously coupled<br>
synthon that has not been coupled, which may be deprotected for that step. The stepwise<br><br>
method may be carried out with synthons on solid phase support. Scheme 8 illustrates a<br>
stepwise preparation of module SC8-1.<br>
[0090]	Compound S8-2 is reacted with S8-3, in which the phenol is protected as the<br>
benzyl ether and the nitrogen is shown as protected with a group "P," which can be any of a<br>
large number of protecting groups well-known in the art, in the presence of methanesulfonyl<br>
chloride (Endo, K.; Takahashi, H. Heterocycles, 1999, 51, 337), to give S8-4. Removal of<br>
the N-protecting group give the free amine S8-5, which can be coupled with synthon S8-6<br>
using any standard peptide coupling reaction such as BOP/HOBt to give S8-7.<br>
Deprotection/coupling is repeated, alternating synthons S8-3 and S8-6 until a linear construct<br>
with eight residues is obtained. The remaining acid and amine protecting groups on the 8-<br>
mer are removed and the oligomer is cyclized, see e.g., Caba, J. M., et al., J. Org. Chem.,<br>
2001,66:7568 (PyAOP cyclization) and Tarver, J. E. et al., J. Org. Chem., 2001, 66:7575<br>
(active ester cyclization). The R group is H or an alkyl group linked via a functional group to<br>
the benzene ring, and X is N, O, or S. Examples of solid supports include Wang resin,<br>
hydrogels, silica gels, sepharose, sephadex, agarose, and inorganic solids. Using a solid<br>
support might simplify the procedure by obviating purification of intermediates along the<br>
way. The final cyclization may be done in a solid phase mode. A "safety-catch linker"<br>
approach (Bourne, G. T., et al., J. Org. Chem., 2001,66:7706) may be used to obtain<br>
cyclization and resin cleavage in a single operation.<br><br><br><br>
[0091]	In another variation, a concerted method involves contacting two or more<br>
different synthons and a linker molecule as shown in Scheme 9, where R may be an alkyl<br>
group or other lipophilic group.<br><br>
SCHEME 9<br>
[0092]	In another variation, a stepwise linear method involves various synthons and a<br>
solid phase support as shown in Scheme 10.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0093]	In another variation, a stepwise convergent method involves synthon trimers<br>
and a solid phase support as shown in Scheme 11. This method can also be done without the<br>
solid phase support using trimers in solution.<br><br>
[0094]	In another variation, a template method involves synthons brought together by<br>
a template as shown in Scheme 12. Some aspects of this approach (and an Mg2+ template) are<br>
given in Dutta et al. Inorg. Chem. 1998, 37, 5029.<br><br>
[0095]	In another variation, a linker molecule method involves cyclizing synthons in<br>
solution as shown in Scheme 13.<br><br><br>
[0096]	Reagents for the following examples were obtained from Aldiich Chemical<br>
Company and VWR Scientific Products. All reactions were carried out under nitrogen or<br>
argon atmosphere unless otherwise noted. Solvent extracts of aqueous solutions were dried<br>
over anhydrous Na2SO4. Solutions were concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary<br>
evaporator. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was done on Analtech Silica gel GF (0.25<br>
mm) plates or on Machery-Nagel Alugram Sil G/UV (0.20 mm) plates. Chromatograms were<br>
visualized with either UV light, phosphomolybdic acid, or KMnO4. All compounds reported<br>
were homogenous by TLC unless otherwise noted. HPLC analyses were performed on a<br>
Hewlett Packard 1100 system using a reverse phase C-18 silica column. Enantiomeric excess<br>
was determined by HPLC using a reverse phase (l)-leucine silica column from Regis<br>
Technologies. All 1[H] and 13[C] NMR spectra were collected at 400 MHz on a Varian<br>
Mercury system. Electrospray mass spectra were obtained by Synpep Corp., or on a Thermo<br>
Finnigan LC-MS system.<br>

Example 15<br>
[0127]	Isolation of S1b-2 was accomplished using the following procedure: Using<br>
Schlenk technique 5.57 g (10.0 mmol) of methyl ester compound, S1b-1, was dissolved in<br>
250 mL of THF. In another flask LiOH (1.21 g, 50.5 mmol) was dissolved in 50 mL water<br>
and de-gassed by bubbling N2 through the solution using a needle for 20 minutes. The<br>
reaction was started transferring the base solution into the flask containing S1b-1 over one<br>
minute with rapid stirring. The mixture was stirred at room temperature and work-up<br>
initiated when the starting material S1b-1 was completely consumed (Using a solvent system<br>
of 66% EtOAc / 33% Hexane and developing with phosphomolybdic acid reagent (Aldrich<br>
#31,927-9) the starting material S1b-1 has an Rf of 0.88 and the product streaks with an Rf of<br>
approx. 0.34 to 0.64.). The reaction usually takes 2 days. Work-Up: The THF was removed<br>
by vacuum transfer until about the same volume is left as water added to the reaction, in this<br>
case 50 mL. During this the reaction solution forms a white mass that adheres to the stir bar<br>
surrounded by clear yellow solution. As the THF is being removed a separatory funnel is set<br>
up including a funnel to pour in the reaction solution and an Erlenmeyer flask is placed<br>
underneath the separatory funnel. Into the Erlenmeyer flask is added some anhydrous<br>
Na2SO4. This apparatus should be set up before acidification is started. (It is important to set<br>
up the separatory funnel and Erlenmeyer flask etc. before acidification of the reaction<br>
solution to enable separation of phases and extraction of the product away from the acid<br>
quickly once the solution attains a pH close to 1. If the separation is not preformed rapidly<br>
the Boc functional group will be hydrolyzed significantly reducing the yield.) Once the<br>
volatiles are sufficiently removed, CH2Cl2 (125 mL) and water (65 mL) are added and the<br>
reaction flask cooled in an ice bath. The solution is stirred rapidly and 5 mL aliquots of 1N<br>
HCl are added by syringe and the reaction solution tested with pH paper. Acid is added until<br>
the spot on the pH paper shows red (not orange) around the edge indicating a pH is 1 to 2 has<br>
been achieved (The solution being tested is a mixture of CH2Cl2 and water so the pH paper<br>
will show the accurate measurement at the edge of the spot and not the center.) and the<br><br>
phases are separated by quickly pouring the solution into the separator/ funnel. As the<br>
phases separate the stopcock is turned to release the CH2Cl2 phase (bottom) into the<br>
Erlenmeyer flask and swirl the flask to allow the drying agent to absorb water in the solution.<br>
(At this scale of this procedure 80 mL of 1N HCl was used.) Soon after phase separation the<br>
aqueous phase is extracted with CH2Cl2 (2 x 100 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and the<br>
volatiles removed to produce 5.37 g / 9.91 mmoles of a beautiful white microcrystals<br>
reflecting a 99.1% yield. This product can not be purified by chromatography since that<br>
process would also hydrolyze the Boc functional group on the column.<br>

Example 48<br>
[0186]	Without intending to be bound by any one particular theory, one method to<br>
approximate pore size of a macrocyclic module is quantum mechanical (QM) and molecular<br>
mechanical (MM) computations. In this example, macrocyclic modules having two types of<br>
synthons, "A" and "B," were used and all linkages between synthons were assumed to be the<br>
same. For the purposes of QM and MM computations, the root mean square deviations in the<br>
pore areas were computed over dynamic runs.<br>
[0187]	For QM, each module was first optimized using the MM+ force field approach<br>
of Allinger (JACS, 1977, 99:8127) and Burkert, et al., (Molecular Mechanics, ACS<br>
Monograph 177, 1982). They were then re-optimized using the AMI Hamiltonian (Dewar, et<br>
al., JACS, 1985, 107:3903; Dewar, et al., JACS, 1986, 108:8075; Stewart:, J. Comp. Aided<br>
Mol. Design, 1990, 4:1). To verify the nature of the potential energy surface in the vicinity<br>
of the optimized structures, the associated Hessian matrices were computed using numerical<br>
double-differencing.<br>
[0188]	For MM, the OPLS-AA force field approach (Jorgensen, et al., JACS, 1996,<br>
118:11225) was used. For imine linkages, the dihedral angle was confined to 180° ± 10°.<br>
The structures were minimized and equilibrated for one picosecond using 0.5 femtosecond<br>
time steps. Then a 5 nanosecond dynamics run was carried out with a 1.5 femtosecond time<br>
step. Structures were saved every picosecond. The results are shown in Tables 4 and 5.<br>
[0189]	Macrocyclic module pore areas derived from QM and MM computations for<br>
various linkages and macrocyclic module pore size are shown in Table 4. In Table 4. the<br>
macrocyclic modules had alternating synthons "A" and "B." Synthon "A" is a benzene<br>
synthon coupled to linkages L at 1,3-phenyl positions, and Synthon "B" is shown in the left-<br>
hand column of the table.<br><br><br>
[0190]	Further macrocyclic module pore areas derived from QM and MM<br>
computations for various linkages and macrocyclic module pore size are shown in Table 5.<br>
In Table 5, the macrocyclic modules had alternating synthons "A" and "B." In Table 5,<br><br>
Synthon "A" is a naphthalene synthon coupled to linkages L at 2,7-naphthyl positions, and<br>
Synthon "B" is shown in the left-hand column of the table.<br><br>
[0191]	An example of the energy-minimized conformations of some hexamer<br>
macrocyclic modules having groups of substituents are shown in Figures 1A and 1B.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1 A, a Hexamer 1-h-(OH)3 is shown having a group of-OH substituents.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1B, a Hexamer 1-h-(OEt)3 is shown having a group of-OEt substituents.<br>
The differences in pore structure and area between these two examples, which also reflect<br>
conformational and flexibility differences, are evident. This macrocyclic module results in a<br>
composition which may be used to regulate pores. Selection of ethoxy synthon substituents<br>
over hydroxy synthon substituents for this hexamer composition is a method which may be<br>
used for transporting selected species.<br><br>
[0192]	The pore size of macrocyclic modules was determined experimentally using a<br>
voltage-clamped bilayer procedure. A quantity of a macrocyclic module was inserted into a<br>
lipid bilayer formed by phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. On one side of<br>
the bilayer was placed a solution containing the cationic species to be tested. On the other<br>
side was a solution containing a reference cationic species known to be able to pass through<br>
the pore of the macrocyclic module. Anions required for charge balance were selected which<br>
could not pass through the pores of the macrocyclic module. When a positive electrical<br>
potential was applied to the solution on the side of the lipid bilayer containing the test<br>
species, if the test species passed through the pores in the macrocyclic modules, a current was<br><br>
detected. The voltage was then reversed to detect current due to transport of the reference<br>
species through the pores, thereby confirming that the bilayer is a barrier to transport and that<br>
the pores of the macrocyclic modules provide transport of species.<br>
[0193]	Using the above technique, a hexameric macrocyclic module comprised of<br>
lR,2R-(-)-transdiaminocyclohexane and 2,6-diformal-4-(l-dodec-l-ynyl)phenol synthons,<br>
having inline groups as the linkages (the first module in Table 3) was tested for transport of<br>
various ionic species. The results are shown in Table 6.<br><br>
[0194]	The results in Table 6 show that the cut-off for passage through the pore in the<br>
selected module is a van der Waals radius of between 2.0 and 2.6 Å. In Table 4, the QM and<br>
MM computed pore sizes are given as areas. Using the equation for area of a circle, A=πr2,<br>
the computed area of the pore in the first module of Table 4, 14.3 Å2, gives a value for r of<br>
2.13 A. Ions having van der Waals radii of less than 2.13 A would be expected to traverse<br>
the pore and those with larger radii would not, and that is what was observed. CH3NH3+,<br>
having a radius of 2.0 A, passed through the pore while CH3CH2NH3+, with a radius of 2.6 A,<br>
did not. Without being held to a particular theory, and recognizing that several factors<br>
influence pore transport, the observed ability of hydrated ions to pass through the pore may<br>
be due to partial dehydration of the species to enter the pore, transport, of water molecules and<br>
ions through the pore separately or with reduced interaction during transport, and re-<br>
coordination of water molecules and ions after transport. The details of pore structure.<br><br>
composition, and chemistry, the flexibility of the macrocyclic module, and other interactions<br>
may affect the transport process.<br>
Example 49<br>
[0195]	Pore properties of 1,2-imine-linked and 1,2-amine-linked hexamer<br>
macrocyclic modules are illustrated in Table 7. Referring to Table 7, the bilayer clamp data<br>
indicates that the passage and exclusion of certain species through the pore of the modules<br>
correlates with the computational size of the pores. Further, these surprising data show that a<br>
very small change in the placement of atoms and/or structural features can lead to a discrete<br>
change in transport properties and allow regulation of transport through the pore by variation<br>
of synthons and linkages, among other factors.<br><br><br>
