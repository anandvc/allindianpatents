				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel adenine compound which is useful as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent for viral diseases, allergic diseases, etc.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Interferon is an endogenous protein which plays an important role in mammalian immune system, takes a part of nonspecific defensive mechanism in vivo and greatly participates also to specific defensive mechanism in vivo. In fact, interferon has been used in the clinical field as a therapeutic agent for viral diseases, such as hepatitis B and C, etc. Low molecular weight organic compounds which induce biosynthesis of said interferon {interferon inducers) have been developed as an interferon preparation in next generation. Imidazoquinoline derivatives (see European Patent Publication A 145340), adenine derivatives (see WO 98/01448 and WO 99/28321), etc. are illustrated. For example, Imiquimod, an imidazoline derivative is used in the clinical field as an external antiviral agent for genital versus.<br>
By the way, T cells which play the key role of the immunological response in vivo are classified into two kinds,  cells and Th2 cells. In the body of patients suffering from allergic disease, cytokines such as interleukin 4 (IL-4), interleukin 5 (IL-5), etc. are excessively secreted from TH2 cells and therefore, it is expected that the compound which<br><br>
suppresses immune response of Th2 cells becomes a therapeutic agent for allergic diseases.<br>
It is known that the above imidazoquinoline derivatives and adenine derivatives have not only the interferon inducing activity, but also have the activity suppressing the production of interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interleukin 5 (IL-5). In fact it is known that these derivatives are effective for allergic diseases on animal model.<br>
However, there is anxiety for systemic adverse-effects due to the interferon inducing activity such as fever, interferon-like diseases when these derivatives are administered as an antiallergic agent.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide a topically administrable medicament which is characterized in suppressing the systemic adverse effect caused by interferon inducing activity.<br>
That is, the present invention provides a novel adenine compound which is characterized in being quickly metabolized to change a less active compound when it is topically administered, and a topically administrable medicament containing this compound as an active ingredient, which is used as the therapy for viral diseases, cancer or allergic diseases, whose systemic pharmacological activity is lessened.<br>
The present inventors have been extensively studied in order to obtain a therapeutic and prophylactic agent for immune deficiency such as allergic diseases which shows excellent effect in the applied area and does not show the systemic adverse effect, when it is externally used in the form of liniments or aerosols useful for diseases such as asthma, etc. and as a result have found that the adenine compounds of the<br><br>
present invention show surprisingly excellent effect on pathologically modeled animals and is characterized in being quickly metabolized in the applied area or the body to change into a less active compound. Namely, the compounds of the present invention are reduced in the systemically pharmacological activity and are useful as a therapeutic or prophylactic agent for viral diseases, cancer, allergic diseases, etc. The present invention was completed based on the above findings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES<br>
Fig. 1 shows anti-HSV activity on a compound of Example 20 against a pathologic modeled-animal infected with HSV-2 in its vagina.<br>
Compound A was spread to a vagina of a female mouse (BALB/c) to which previously Depo-Provera was administered, and on next day, HSV-2 was infected to the vagina. Nine days later, the rate of survival or death of mice was observed and compared.<br>

Metabolic stability on river S9 of rat<br>
The reaction on river S9 of a rat was carried out on a 96-well<br><br>
plate by using a robot for screening by Tecan Company. S9 solution was prepared by adding to 10 ml of liver S9 of a rat, 20 ml of 250 mM Kpi (pH 7.4) and 20 ral of deionized water. Cofactor solution was prepared by dissolving NADPH {220 mg) in deionized water (40.5 ml) to give finally a 6 mM solution. IS (Internal Standard) solution was prepared by adding 300}iL of IS solution (ImM DMSO solution) to 30ml of acetonitrile solution (lOOtimes dilution). The test compound (IpM DMSO solution) was dissolved in an incubator at 37°C, 35pL of it was poured into each well of a 96-well plate (24 samples/plate and then, plates (a sample plate, a 96 well-plate for dilution, deep well plates for reaction and recovering, a plate for extraction of the solid phase) and the test samples (S9 solution, Cofactor solution, IS (Internal Standard) solution, Stop solution, acetonitrile for elution) were set to the specified position in the booth of the robot. The reaction started (the concentration of the test compound was IpM) and the mixture was incubated at 37°C under stirring. The solid phase was extracted and at the same time the internal standard for analysis was added. To the recovered sample (200pL/well) was added 50pL of acetonitrile per each well and to 2 plates of FALCON Deep well were poured lOOpL of the solution per well. By subjecting to the LC/MS analysis, the chromatogram of the test sample and the internal standard were described and the peak area was calculated. And then, the stability (residual rate after reaction) was calculated by the internal standard method.  The result was shown in Table 4.<br><br>

The   measurement   of the  amount  of leucocytes  and   cytokines  in<br>
bronchoalveolar lavege fluid (BALF) on an asthma modeled mouse<br>
C57BL/6 mouse was immunized by dermally administering denatured ovalbumin by heating (40 mg). Fourteen days later after the first immunization, ovalbumin {100]ag) was nasally busted. Twenty one days later after the first immunization, the solution (Iml/kg) prepared by suspending the test compound (lOmg/kg) in physiorogical saline was nasally administered (lOjal/lOg/body weight). After 2 hours ovalbimin (lOOjig) was nasally challenged. After 18 hours, bronchoalveolar lavege fluid (BALF) was collected, and the total number of leucocytes in BALF and fractioned leukocyte in the cytospin sample were measured. By ELISA method, lL-4 and IL-5 in the supernatant were measured. The number of leucocytes (inhibition %) was shown in Table 5 and the production inhibition activity of IL-4 and IL-5 (inhibition % to control) was shown in Table 6.<br>

Anti HSV activity of antedrug for herpes virus (HSV) infected vagina of<br>
modeled rat<br>
On the back of a BALB/c female mouse (6 weeks old: Nippon SLC) 3 mg of Depo-Provera/mouse (Registered Trade Mark} was dermally administered and the mice were fed for 6 days. By doing this the sexual cycle was tuned and the sensitivity between mice to herpes virus was balanced. The slime of mouse vagina was removed by a cotton swab for baby, and the ointment (20 mg) containing 0.5% of compound of Example 20 or the ointment (10 mg) containing 5% of compound of Example 20 was spread to the vagina(corresponding 0.1 mg and 0.5 mg per mouse of the compound of Example). As a control, the placebo ointment not containing the compound was spread as well. As the ointment, the base consisting of 80% Vaseline and 20% liquid paraffin were used. On the next day, the slime of mouse vagina was removed by a cotton swab for baby and then, axlO"* pfu type 2 herpes virus (HSV-2)(10 pl/mouse) was administered to the vagina by pipette. After infection the death or survival of the mice was observed.<br>
The survived rate of mice 9 days later after virus-infection was shown in figure 1. The groups spread by the ointments containing 0.5% and 5% of the compound of Example 20, respectively showed clearly higher survived rate comparing with a control group, and the dosage dependency was observed. Furthermore, though the survived rate of the control group was 0%, in the group of 5% ointment its survived rate was 100% and the latter showed clearly anti-viral effect. Example 128<br>
