				<td>REFERENCE TO GOVERNMENT CONTRACT<br>
A portion of this invention described herein was supported under grant or contract from<br>
the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The United States of<br>
America Government may have certain rights to this invention.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to novel tricyclic 1,2,4-triazine-1-oxides and novel tricyclic<br>
1,2,4-triazine-1,4-dioxides and related analogues, to their preparation, and to their use as<br>
hypoxia-selective drugs and radiosensitizers for cancer therapy, both alone or in<br>
combination with radiation and/or other anticancer drugs.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
Hypoxic cells in tumours are resistant to ionising radiation, and are a major cause of<br>
treatment failure in radiation therapy (Movsas et al., Cancer 2000, 89, 2018; Rudat et al.,<br>
Radiother. Oncol. 2000, 57, 31). Hypoxic cells are also considered to compromise<br>
response of solid tumours to cytotoxic chemotherapy (Brown and Giaccia, Cancer Res.<br>
1998, 58, 1408). The 1,2,4-benzotriazine di-N-oxide tirapazamine (TPZ) is selectively<br>
toxic to hypoxic cells because of its metabolic activation to a cytotoxic species by one-<br>
electron reduction (Baker et al., Cancer Res. 1988, 48, 5947; Laderoute et al., Biochem.<br>
Pharmacol. 1988, 37, 1487; Brown, Br. J. Cancer 1993, 67, 1163). As shown below, the<br>
initial one-electron reduction product TPZ' is reoxidised to the starting compound by<br>
dioxygen, thereby preventing cytotoxicity in oxic cells.<br><br>
TPZ is therefore of interest for killing hypoxic cells in tumours, thereby improving overall<br>
response during radiation therapy. TPZ also has potential for combination with standard<br>
cytotoxic chemotherapy (Dorie and Brown, Cancer Res. 1993, 53, 4633; Langmuir et al.,<br>
Cancer Res. 1994, 54, 2845; Dorie and Brown, Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1997, 39,<br>
361), with (at least) two mechanisms of therapeutic synergy. The first mechanism is the<br>
killing of resistant hypoxic cells (analogous to the mechanism of interaction with<br>
radiotherapy), and the second is the interference with repair of chemotherapy-induced<br>
2<br><br>
DNA damage in hypoxic cells as has been demonstrated for cisplatin (Kovacs et al., Br. J.<br>
Cancer 1999, 80, 1245; Peters et al., Cancer Res. 2001, 61, 5425).<br>
TPZ has already demonstrated significant antitumour activity in early phase human clinical<br>
trials in combination with ionising radiation and/or cisplatin chemotherapy (for a review,<br>
see Denny and Wilson, Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs 2000, 9, 2889), and a multicentre phase<br>
III trial of TPZ in combination with cisplatin and radiation for treatment of head and neck<br>
tumours is in progress (Rischin et al., J. Clin. Oncol. 2005, 23, 79-87). While TPZ shows<br>
promising indications of clinical activity, it also displays considerable toxicity, such as<br>
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and muscle cramping. These<br>
toxicity limitations preclude administration of doses that are either high enough or<br>
sufficient enough to exploit hypoxia fully during cancer treatment. Although the<br>
mechanisms of TPZ toxicity towards normal tissues are not fully understood, it is<br>
considered that the toxicity arises at least in part because of redox cycling (Elwell et al.,<br>
Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997, 54, 249; Wouters et al., Cancer Res. 2001, 61, 145), and is<br>
therefore considered to be distinct from the mechanism of hypoxic cell killing.<br>
There have been only limited structure-activity studies on analogues of TPZ. Kelson et al<br>
(Anti-Cancer Drug Design 1998, 13, 575-592) disclosed compounds of type A, where X was<br>
H or an electron-withdrawing group, n was 2 or 3, and R was Me or Et. The main conclusion<br>
from this paper was that compounds with dialkylaminoalkyl side chains showed decreased<br>
hypoxic selectivity in vitro and comparable but not superior activity to TPZ in vivo. There was<br>
no clear relationship between the electron-withdrawing capability of the 7-substituent on the<br>
benzo ring and biological activity. Hay and Denny (Tet. Lett. 2002, 43, 9569-9571) and<br>
Kelson et al (Anti-Cancer Drug Design 1998, 13, 575-592) described compounds of type B,<br>
where X is H or hydroxyalkyl, n is 2 or 3, and R is OH or OMe, but did not describe any<br>
biological activity. Finally, Hay et al. (J. Med. Chem. 2003, 46, 169-182) showed, for<br>
compounds of type C, where X is NEt2, NMe2, OMe, Me, Cl, F, CF3, MeSO2, nBuSO2, and<br>
NO2, that oxic cytotoxicity in SCCVII cells in vitro correlated with one-electron reduction<br>
potential [E(1)], but there was not a clear relationship between in vitro hypoxic cytotoxicity<br>
and E(1). Further, there was no clear relationship between hypoxia-selectivity and E(1) and<br>
none of the compounds displayed improved in vitro activity compared to TPZ.<br><br>
3<br><br>
To a large extent the above efforts to identify analogues of TPZ with improved therapeutic<br>
activity have focused on compounds with higher reduction potentials, with the expectation<br>
that such compounds will be metabolically activated more rapidly than TPZ under hypoxic<br>
conditions and will therefore have improved activity against hypoxic cells in tumours.<br>
In the present invention the inventors have unexpectedly found that certain tricyclic<br>
triazine compounds of the invention have activity against hypoxic tumor cells in vivo<br>
despite having lower reduction potentials than the corresponding compounds in the<br>
literature (Kelson et al, Anti-Cancer Drug Design 1998, 13, 575-592),<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a range of novel tricyclic 1,2,4-triazine-1-<br>
oxides and novel tricyclic 1,2,4-thazine-1,4-dioxides and their related analogues, and to<br>
provide for their use as potentiators of the cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs and as<br>
radiosensitizers and as hypoxia-selective cytotoxins for cancer therapy in combination<br>
with radiation and/or with other anticancer agents, or to at least provide the public with a<br>
useful choice.<br>

It is to be appreciated that many variations and modifications of the reagents and starting<br>
materials in the schemes above could be readily brought about by a skilled artisan to<br>
make further compounds of Formula I without departing from the scope of the invention as<br>
defined. For example the benzo ring of the compounds of Formula I could be substituted<br>
with X groups, where X is other than H, by making or obtaining an appropriately<br>
substituted nitroaniline compound and where necessary protecting that substituent with<br>
appropriate protecting groups throughout the rest of the synthesis to ensure that the<br>
desired substitutent is carried through to the compound of Formula I.<br>

Dunedin, NZ. Melting points were determined on an Electrothermal 2300 Melting Point<br>
Apparatus. NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer at 400 MHz<br>
for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C spectra. Spectra were obtained in CDCI3 unless otherwise<br>
specified, and were referenced to Me4Si. Chemical shifts and coupling constants were<br>
recorded in units of ppm and Hz, respectively. Assignments were determined using COSY,<br>
HSQC, and HMBC two-dimensional experiments. Low resolution mass spectra were<br>
gathered by direct injection of methanolic solutions into a Surveyor MSQ mass spectrometer<br>

V and a source temperature of 400 °C. Low resolution mass spectra were also determined<br>
on a VG-70SE mass spectrometer using an ionizing potential of 70 eV at a nominal<br>
resolution of 1000. High-resolution spectra were obtained at nominal resolutions of 3000,<br>
5000, or 10000 as appropriate. All spectra were obtained as electron impact (El) spectra<br>
using PFK as the reference unless otherwise stated. Solutions in organic solvents were<br>
dried with anhydrous Na2SO4. Solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure on a rotary<br>
evaporator. Thin-layer chromatography was carried out on aluminum-backed silica gel plates<br>

Example 189<br>
Evaluation of the cytotoxicity of compounds by proliferation assay (IC50) under<br>
aerobic and hypoxic conditions.<br>
Compounds representative of the invention were evaluated under both aerobic and<br>
hypoxic conditions in a proliferation assay (IC50), using two cell lines: human colon<br>
carcinoma HT29, and human cervical carcinoma SiHa (Table 1).<br>
Drug exposures were performed in 96-well plates (Nunc) either using a 37 °C humidified<br>
incubator (20% O2, 5% CO2) or in the incubator compartment (37 °C) of an anaerobic<br>
chamber (Shell Lab) where palladium catalyst scrubbed gas (90% N2, 5% H2, 5% CO2)<br>
ensures severe anoxia (
simultaneously tested under both oxic and hypoxic conditions and included TPZ as an<br>
internal control. An 8-methyl-5-nitroquinoline derivative, SN 24349, known to require very<br>
low oxygen concentrations for bioactivation (Siim et al., Br. J. Cancer 1994, 70, 596-603)<br>
was used to confirm that strict hypoxia was present during the experiment. The assay<br>
acceptance criteria based on SN 24349 were: anoxic IC50 
SiHa; HCR &gt; 30 for HT29 and &gt;100 for SiHa. Cell cultures were grown in aMEM (Gibco)<br>
containing 5% heat inactivated FCS and maintained in exponential growth phase. For<br>
each individual experiment an appropriate number of cells were seeded (HT29 = 1100;<br>
SiHa = 1500) into wells in αMEM + 10% FCS + 10 mM added glucose + 100 μM 2'-<br>
deoxycytidine (2'dCyd), and allowed to attach for 2-3 h. High glucose (final concentration<br>
17 mM) and the presence of 2'-dCyd minimize hypoxia-induced cell cycle arrest. Cultures<br>
were then exposed to drugs, using 3-fold serial dilutions in duplicate, for a further 4 h.<br>
Subsequently cells were washed free of compound using complete media (without<br>
glucose/2'-dCyd) and allowed to grow for 5 (oxic) or 6 (anoxic) days. Plates were stained<br>
with sulforhodamine B as described previously (Wilson et al., J. Med. Chem. 1989, 32,<br>
31-38) and IC50 values determined.<br>
174<br><br>
IC50 = The concentration of drug to reduce viable cell numbers to 50% of control cell<br>
cultures grown under the same conditions but not exposed to drug.<br>
HCR = Hypoxic cytotoxicity ratio is defined as the ratio of IC50 values under aerobic and<br>
hypoxic conditions (IC50 aerobic/IC50 hypoxic).<br>

HT29 Excision assay. In vivo activity of single dose of compound 77 in combination<br>
with radiation. The activity of compound 77 against hypoxic cells in HT29 tumours is<br>
illustrated in Figure 1. Subcutaneous HT29 tumours (average of two largest diameters 8-<br>
10 mm) were grown by inoculating 107 cells (obtained by enzymatic dissociation of<br>
multicellular spheroids) into CD-1 nude mice. Cmpd 77 was administered as a single i.p.<br>
dose (560 |amol/kg, which is 75% of the maximum tolerated dose) alone or 5 min after<br>
radiation (20 Gy). Tumours were excised 18 h after treatment and plated to determine the<br>
number of clonogens/g tumour tissue. Hypoxic cytotoxicity of compound 77 is<br>
demonstrated by the difference between the radiation-only and radiation + drug groups.<br>
This difference was statistically significant (p 
Selectivity for hypoxic cells is demonstrated by the greater activity of 77 with radiation<br>
than as a single agent.<br>
The activity of single doses of TPZ and compounds 61 and 77 against hypoxic cells in<br>
HT29 and an additional two human tumour models is illustrated in Figure 2. The drugs<br>
were administered i.p. at the stated doses 5 minutes after irradiation in experiments<br>
similar to that described above. All drugs were administered at 0.75 x MTD. The activity is<br>
measured as logs of cell kill in addition to the cell kill observed for radiation alone.<br>

Fractionated Tumour Excision assays. In vivo activity of multiple doses of drug in<br>
combination with fractionated radiation.<br>
The activity of multiple doses of compound 77 and TPZ against hypoxic cells in three<br>
human tumour xenografts is illustrated in Figure 3. Subcutaneous tumours (average of<br>
two largest diameters 8-10 mm) were grown by inoculating 107 cells into the midline of the<br>
back in CD-1 nude mice. Drugs were administered by i.p. injection at 100% of the MTD for<br>
twice daily (9am, 3pm) administration for 4 days, either alone or 30 min before each of 8 x<br>
2.5 Gy local irradiation of the tumour. Tumours were excised 18 hr after treatment and<br>
plated to determine the number of clonogens/g tumour tissue. Antitumour activity is<br>
measured as logs of cell kill in addition to the cell kill observed for radiation alone. In<br>
each of the three tumour models investigated, administration of compound 77 or TPZ, 30<br>
min before each radiation dose, gave significantly (P 
to radiation alone (Figure 3). Compound 77 gave greater killing than TPZ in each tumour<br>

model. In SiHa tumours the log cell kill in addition to radiation alone was significantly<br>
greater (p
