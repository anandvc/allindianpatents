The present invention relates to a one-step process for the selective O-acylation of the hydroxy groups of a nucleoside in heterogeneous aqueous solvent mixture under basic conditions utilizing DMAP and a carboxylic acid anhydride.<br>
"Nucleoside compounds are composed of a sugar moiety, typically ribose or 2-deoxyribose in naturally-occurring nucleosides, and a heterocyclic base which typically is adenine, guanidine, cytosine, thymine or uracil. Many nucleosides have basic amino substitution on the heterocyclic base and exhibit chemical reactivity characteristic of amino alcohols. The nitrogen atom of amino alcohols is frequently the most reactive and readily acylated functional group.<br>
Nucleoside compounds and derivatives thereof have assumed an important role in the chemotherapy of viral and neoplastic diseases (see, e.g. P. L. Sarma et ah, Curr. Top, Med. Chew. 2004 4:895-919; W. B. Parker et al, Curr. Opin. Invest. Drugs 2004 5(6):592-596). While nucleoside derivatives are frequently potent chemotherapeutic agents, their clinical use is often limited by suboptimal physical properties which result in poor pharmacokinetic profiles. Nucleoside prodrugs sometimes exhibit increased potency, bioavailability, stability which results in enhanced delivery of therapeutically effective amounts of the active moiety to the cellular target. Alkylation, acylation or other lipophilic modification of functional groups on the nucleoside often enhance passive diffusion through the intestinal wall (transcellular transport). Alternatively functional groups may be linked which are substrates for carrier-mediated transport systems resulting in an active transport of the prodrug. J.-L. Kraus et al, Curr. Med. Chem. 2003 10(18):1825-1846; P. Ettmayer etal., J. MedChem., 2004 47(10):2393-2404; K. Beaumont et al, Curr. Drug Metab. 2003 4:461-485; H. Bundgaard, Design of Prodrugs: Bioreversible derivatives for various functional groups and chemical entities in Design of Prodrugs, H. Bundgaard (ed) Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam 1985; G. M. Pauletti el al., Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 1997 27:235-256; and K. Beaumont et al, Curr. Drug Metab. 2003 4:461-485).<br>
One strategy for prodrug design applicable to nucleosides is acylation of the hydroxyl substituents on the sugar moiety. Selective tri-acylation of the sugar residues of uridines has been reported (H. B. Lassan et al, Nucleoside Nucleotides 1998 17(9-11): 1851-1856 and C.-T. Chen et al, Org. Lett. 2001 3(23):3729-3732.). Selective O-acylation of hydroxy groups of thymidine and uridine nucleosides under phase transfer conditions has been reported (M, Sekine, Nat. Prod. Lett. 1993 1(4):251-256). Nucleosides substituted with heterocyclic bases with an amino substituent are less likely to undergo such selective transformations. The preparation of l-(2,3,5-tri-0-acetyl-[]-D-<br><br>
arabinofuranosyl)cytosine hydrochloride (ara-C HCl) utilizes a two-step process comprising peracetylation and selective hydrolysis of the N-acetyl linkage with anhydrous ZnBr2, MeOH and CHCI3 (M. Bobeck et al, J. Med. Chem. 1987 30(11):2154-2157). A similar two-strategy for preparing tri-0-acyl derivatives of 4-amino-l-((2R,3R,4S,5R)-5-azido-3,4-dihydroxy-5-hydroxymethyl-tetrahydro-furan"2-yl)-lH-pyrimidin-2-one was reported by J. A. Martin et al, in U.S. Patent Islo. 6,846,810 filed November 19, 2003. Selective 0-acylation of the sugar substitutents of cytosine-containing nucleosides under acidic conditions has been reported to result in 0-acylation of cytidine, 2'-deoxycytidine and ara-C, R. G. Breiner et al, J. Med Chem. 1990 33(9):2596-2602; A.P. Martinez et al, J. Med. Chem. 1966 9(2):268). While not wishing to be limited by a mechanistic hypothesis, these transformations were carried out under acidic conditions which protonate the amino substituent on the base and thereby suppress N-acylation. Selective 0-acylation of guanosine and deoxyguanosine nucleosides with acetic anhydride in the presence of MeCN/TEA/DMAP (catalytic quantity) has been reported (A. Matsuda et al, Synthesis 1986 385-386). Selective O-acylation of cytidine under similar conditions has been reported (M. A. Zinni et al, J. Mol Cat, B 2004 29:129-132). While these conditions result in some selective O-acylated product, the yields of 0-acylated product are not acceptable.<br>
The present invention provides a process for the selective 0-acylation of a nucleoside of formula I under basic conditions in a heterogeneous aqueous solvent mixture wherein:<br><br>
A is Al, A2 or A3<br>
R' is hydrogen, azide, C1-6 alkyl or C1-3 acyl;<br><br>
Ra1 .and Ra2 are independently hydrogen or hydroxyl;<br>
Rb1 and Rb2 are hydrogen or -O2CR-; and,<br>
R2 is C1-10 alkyl or phenyl;<br>
which process comprises the steps of:<br>
(i) dissolving I and DMAP in an heterogenous aqueous solvent mixture and adding aqueous base to adjust the pH from 7 to 13;<br>
(ii) optionally adding sufficient saturated aqueous NaCl to produce a biphasic reaction mixture;<br>
(iii) adding an acylating agent and additional base sufficient to maintain the pH from 7 to 13;<br>
(iv) monitoring the reaction and discontinuing addition of said acylating agent and said base when the conversion reaches a satisfactory level;<br>
(v) optionally contacting the O-acyl nucleosides with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid to permit isolation of an acid additional salt of the 0-acyl nucleoside.<br>
Acylated nucleosides are useful prodrugs which allow efficient delivery of therapeutically effective amounts biologically active nucleosides to patients. In addition, 0-acylated nucleoside derivatives are frequently useful chemical intermediates for the preparation of nucleoside analogs. Selective acylation of natural nucleosides or derivatives thereof is often problematical due the plurality of reactive sites in many nucleosides. This is particularly true with nucleoside derivatives with a basic amine substiluent on the heterocyclic base which frequently is the most reactive functional group in the molecule. The chemical reactivity of the substitutents sometimes limits the reagents which may be used for chemical transformations. Substitution of the ribose with azide has afforded several new pharmaceutically active compounds. Unfortunately the azide group may prove to be unstable in acidic media and the azide substituent is thermally labile and therefore an explosion hazard. Furthermore additional substitution on the sugar moiety can substantially alter the reactivity observed with natural nucleosides which lack said substitution. Conditions for selective acylation at low temperature under non-acidic conditions are therefore desirable. Large scale production of chemical compounds imposes further limitations on the reagents which can be utilized. Reactions which can be carried out in non-flammable solvents that can be easily<br><br>
recycled or discarded as waste are advantageous. Furthermore processes are desirable that limit the number of discrete chemical steps and unit operations both of which can add to production costs. Thus processes which do not require introduction of protecting groups are desirable. The present process has proven to be an effective and general route for the selective acylation of nucleosides.<br>

A solution of heptane/lPA was added, the mixture was heated to 60 °C and allowed to cool slowly to RT. The resulting solid was filtered and washed with IP A/heptane and dried in a vacuum oven at 60°C to afford 3.35<br>
g (80.5% theory) of 2a: mp 167-169 T).<br>

Butyric acid (2R,3S,4S,5R)-5-(4-amino-2-oxo-2H-pyrimidin-l-yl)-2-azido-3,4-6/5-butyryloxy-tetrahydro-furan-2-ylmethyl ester (2b, R = CO-W-C3H7; 1.45 g; 83.3% theory) was prepared in similar fashion except z^-o-butyric anhydride was replaced with butyric anhydride.<br>
Example 2<br>
Isobutyric acid 5-(4-amino-2-oxo-2H-pyrimidin-l-yl)-2-azido-3,4-bis'-isobutyryloxy-tetrahydro-furan-2-ylmethyI ester<br><br>
A slurry of 3 (12.0 kg) and DMAP (0.46 kg) in THF (48 L) and water (36 L) is treated with 50% aqueous KOH to adjust the pH to about 8.5. The resulting mixture is cooled to 10 °C and treated with isobutyric anhydride (21.6 kg) while maintaining the pH at about 8-11 (by simultaneous addition of 50% KOH) and temperature at about 10-15 °C. The reaction was monitored by HPLC and after the reaction was complete EtOAc (35 L) was added and the batch was filtered through CELITE®. The filtrate was separated into two phases and the aqueous phase was extracted twice with EtOAc (2 x 30 L). The combined EtOAc phases were washed with dilute brine and EtOAc was distilled and replaced with IPA. The resulting solution was diluted with heptane which resulted in the precipitation of 4. The resulting slurry was aged for at about 0 °C and the solid was<br><br>
isolated by filtration, washed with a heptane-IPA mixture and dried in a vacuum oven at about 50°C to afford 17.01 kg (89% theory) of 4 which was 99.3 % pure by hplc analysis.<br>
Example 3<br>
Isobutyric acid 2-(6-amino-purin-9-yl)-4-isobutyryloxy-5-isobutyryloxymethyl-tetrahydro-furan-3-yl ester<br><br>
The title compound was prepared as described for example 1 from adenosine (5, 10g; 37.42 mmol), DMAP (0.46 g, 3.74 mmol), THF (40 mL) and H2O (30.0 mL). A total of 5.8 equivalents of isobutyric acid anhydride were required for complete conversion which afforded 17.8 g (100% theory of 6.<br><br>
Acylation with an acid chloride<br>
A solution of 4-amino-l-((2R,3S,4S,5R)-5-azido-3, 4-dihydroxy-5-hydroxymethyl-tetrahydro-furan-2-yl)-lH-pyrimidin-2-one (3, 6.0 g, 18.01 mmol), THF (35 mL), brine ( 10 mL) and DMAP (0.2 g) was treated with sufficient brine to produce a two-phase solution (approximately 2 mL). The resulting two-phase mixture was cooled to ca. 5 °C and isobutyroyl chloride and 50% aqueous KOH were added simultaneously at a rate which maintained the pH of the reaction mixture at approximately 8.5. The reaction was monitored by HPLC and the addition was continued until all starting material was consumed. HPLC analysis indicated by tri- and tetra-acyl product was present. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to ca, 1.5 with dilute H2SO4 and the reaction stirred<br><br>
overnight which resulted in hydrolysis of any tetra-acylated product. The product was extracted in EtOAc and the combined extracts were thoroughly washed with water adjusted to a pH of ca. 1.5 mL. The resulting EtOAc solution was dried (MgSO4), filtered and evaporated to afford 7.8 g of 4 which assayed to 85.3%.<br>
Acvlation with carbonyl diimidazole and isobutyric acid<br>
To a slurry of 3 (1.0 g, 3.00 mmol), DMAP (37 mg), THF (1.0 mL) and water (4.0 mL) was added 50% NaOH until the pH was 7-8 and then adjusted to pH 9.5 with saturated NaHCO3. Carbonyldiimidazole (1.3 g, 9.0 mmol) was added to a solution of isobutyric acid (0.8 g, 9.00 mmol) in THF (10 mL) and stirring continued until there was no further effervescence. The latter solution was added slowly to the slurry containing 3 at RT. The pH was maintained at ca. 9 by addition of base. HPLC analysis revealed a mixture of mono-, di- and triacylated product in which the latter two predominated. The reaction will proceed to completion if addition acyl imidazole is added until all material is converted to product.<br>
