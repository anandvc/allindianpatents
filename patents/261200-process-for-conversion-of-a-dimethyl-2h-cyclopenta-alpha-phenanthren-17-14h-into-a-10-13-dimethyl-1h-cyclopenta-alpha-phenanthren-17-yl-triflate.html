				<td>PROCESS FOT THE PREPARATION OF 17-0-VINYL- TRIFLATES AS INTERMEDIATES<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of the compound<br>
ahiraterone, or a salt or derivative thereof.<br>
Abiraterone acetate of formula:<br>
is a potent selective, orally active inhibitor of the key enzyme in testosterone<br>
synthesis, 17x-hydroxylase-C17,20-lyase, also known as steroid 17a-monooxygenase<br>
inhibitor or Human Cytochrome P450i70. Suppression of testosterone synthesis has<br>
been demonstrated with abiraterone acetate in patients with prostate cancer.<br>
The compound was first disclosed in WO-A-93/20097, with a further<br>
synthetic method to the compound in WO-A-95/09178 (both British Technology<br>
Group Limited). In particular, WO-A-95/09178 discloses the synthesis of a compound<br>
where the 30 substituent R' is hydrogen or a lower acyl group having 2 to 4 carbon<br>
atoms. One of the methods disclosed makes this from the corresponding ketone via<br>
the steroidal enol triflate (trifluoromethylsulfonate):<br><br>
WO-A-95/09178 suggests replacing the triflate with a corresponding vinyl<br>
iodide intermediate, and iises this to make compounds by reacting this with a<br>
(3-pyridyl)-substituted borane of formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)  whereicn R represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group of 1—4 carbon atoms<br>
and Z1 and Z2 independently represent hydroxy or alkoxy or alkyl of 1-3 carbon<br>
atoms each or Z1 and Z2 together represent an alkylenedioxy group of 2 or 3 carbon<br>
atoms.<br>
The triflate intermediate is also reported in J. Med. Chem. (1995), 38(13),<br>
2463-71 (Potter et a/.); J. Med. Chem. (1997), 40(20), 3297-3304 (Ling et a/.); J.<br>
Med. Chem. (2000), 43(22), 4266-4277 (Hartmann et al.); Journal fur Praktische<br>
Chemie / Chemiker-Zeitung (1993), 335(5), 439-44 (Schweder et al); Tet. Lett.<br>
(1990), 31(13), 1889-1892 and Tet. Lett. (1991), 32(12), 1579-82 (both Ciattini et<br>
al); Archiv der Pharmazie (Weinheim, Germany) (2001), 334(12), 373-374 and<br>
Steroid Biochem. Molec. Biol (2003), 84, 555-562 (both Haidar et al.); Synthesis<br>
(1986), 320-322 (Cacchi et al); and J. Organomet. Chem. (1989), 367(3), 375-82<br>
and Synth. Commun. (1987), 17(12), 1389-402 (both Orsini et al). All of these<br>
references prepare the triflate intermediate according to the method recommended in<br>
a review entitled "Perfluoroalkanesulfonic Esters: Methods of Preparation and<br>
Application in Organic Chemistry", Synthesis, 1982, 85-126 (Stang et al).<br>
Page 107 of the review advocates against the use of simple bases such as<br>
pyridine, lutidine or triethylamine, as these give undesirable by-products at the triflate<br>
stage. Stang et al. recommend the use of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine<br>
 (DTBMP) instead, in spite of that fact that this base is expensive. Thus all the<br>
reported syntheses of the triflate intermediate for abiraterone up to now have used<br>
DTBMP, or occasionally 2,6-di-te^butylpyridine.<br>
The present inventors have observed that the original triflate reaction, which<br>
up to now appeared not to be the preferred route, still had certain attractive features.<br>
However, they also observed that using the base DTBMP when R' is a lower acyl<br>
group can lead to elimination of the acid, giving an undesirable by-product of<br>
formula:<br>
We have now developed an improved route in which the production of the<br>
undesirable by-product is kept down to acceptable levels. This means that the<br>
purification process is simplified, as expensive and time-consuming column<br>
chromatography steps can be eliminated. As this does not use the expensive reagent<br>
DTBMP, contrary to the teaching of Stang et al., the route is made commercially<br>
more attractive still.<br>
Accordingly the present invention comprises a process for the preparation of a<br>
where Ar represents an optionally substituted five- or six mernbered fully<br>
unsaturated ring containing at least one nitrogen atom and joined to the main ring<br>
system by means of a carbon-carbon bond; and<br>
R1 represents hydrogen or a lower acyl group having 2 to 4 carbon atoms;<br>
or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof;<br>
including a triflating step by which a ketone of formula (II) is converted into a<br>
wherein R' is as defined above, or a protected derivative thereof;<br>
the Inflating step being conducted in the presence of a base comprising a<br>
tertiary or heterocyclic amine such that the pKa of the conjugate acid at 25 °C is<br>
within the range 5.21 to 12.<br>
Using the present invention, a method for the preparation of the compound of<br>
formula (I) is possible which requires no chromatographic purification at any stage of<br>
the synthesis.<br>
The pKa of the conjugate acid is the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation<br>
constant, Ka, and generally refers to ability of an ionizable group of the organic<br>
compound to donate a proton (H4) in aqueous media. However, in the event that the<br>
compound is not soluble in water, the value used may refer to the dissociation<br>
constant in an aqueous mixture containing a co-solvent such as ethanol.<br>
Preferred bases include those set out in Table 1:<br>
10.6. Most preferably the base is 2,6-lutidine or triethylamine.<br>
By way of comparison, the pKa of the conjugate acid of 2,6-di-fert-butyl-4-<br>
methylpyridine is 4.41 in 50% EtOH solvent at 27 ± 2 °C— see J. Org. Chem. (1973),<br>
38, 1123-1126 (Deutsch et a!.). The pKa of the conjugate acid of 2,6-di-tert-btrtylpyridine<br>
is 4.95. Both fall outside the range specified in the present invention,.<br>
Preferably the triflating step is carried out in a solvent comprising a chlorineated<br>
organic solvent or an organic ester. Suitable organic esters include ethyl acetate.<br>
Preferably the solvent is a chlorinated organic solvent such as chloroform, and in<br>
particular dichloromethane or 1,2-dichloroethane.<br>
Ar may represent any optionally substituted five- or six membered fully<br>
unsaturated ring containing at least one nitrogen atom and joined to the main ring<br>
system by means of a carbon-carbon bond. The optionally substitution may take the<br>
form of an alkyl group of 1-4 carbon atoms. Preferably the fully unsaturated ring<br>
contains one or two heteroatoms, with at least one of them being nitrogen. Five-<br>
-membered fully unsaturated rings include pyrrole, imidazole, pyrazole, isothiazole<br>
and isoxazole. Six-membered aromatic rings fully unsaturated include the aromatic<br>
rings pyridine, pyrazine, pyrimidine and pyridazine. Preferably Ar represents an<br>
uhsubstituted five-membered fully unsaturated ring, or a six-membered aromatic ring<br>
optionally substituted with a single substituent.<br>
In the case of Ar representing an unsubstituted five-membered fully<br>
unsaturated ring, preferred values include:<br>
In the case of Ar representing a six-membered aromatic ring optionally substituted<br>
with a single substituent, preferred values include:<br>
where R represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group of 1—4 carbon atoms.<br>
In the case where R' represents hydrogen, the protecting group could be any<br>
suitable group for protecting alcohols, as discussed in "Protective groups in organic<br>
synthesis" 3rd Ed, Theodora W Greene and Peter G Wuts, published by John Wiley,<br>
ISBN 0-471-16019-9. For example, it might be protected as a benzyl, methoxymethyl<br>
(MOM) or silyl ether.<br>
Preferably R1 represents a lower acyloxy group, in which case no further<br>
protection would normally be necessary, especially acetyl.<br>
Preferably the compound of formula I is a compound of formula:<br>
in which R and R' are as defined as above, with R preferably representing a<br>
hydrogen atom. Most preferably R' represents acetyl and R represents a hydrogen<br>
atom, the compound of formula (I) being abiraterone acetate.<br>
The preferred Inflating agent is triflic anhydride (TfizO). To minimize<br>
decomposition of the product, preferably the base is added to the reaction mixture<br>
shortly after the triflic anhydride, say fifteen minutes or less. The reaction mixture is<br>
preferably quenched within an hour after the addition of the base, again to minimize<br>
decomposition of the product.<br>
We have observed that the use of large excesses of base lead to poor<br>
conversion of the ketone of formula (II) into the triflate of formula (III), and that use<br>
of large excesses of triflic anhydride can lead to rapid decomposition of the product.<br>
For optimum conversion of the ketone of formula (IF) into the triflate, the number of<br>
equivalents of triflic anhydride is preferably not lower than the number of equivalents<br>
of base. We have also observed that reducing the amount of base to sub-stoichiometric<br>
levels did not affect the conversion.<br>
Thus preferably the triflating step is performed using between 1.0 and 1.5<br>
equivalents, more preferably between 1.1 and 1.4 equivalents, of triflic anhydride<br>
relative to the ketone of formula (II); and between 0.75 and 1.5 equivalents of base,<br>
more preferably between 0.8 and 1,4 equivalents, relative to the ketone of formula<br>
(II), wherein the number of equivalents of trifiic anhydride is greater than or equal to<br>
the number of equivalents of base. More preferably, the number of equivalents of<br>
trifiic anhydride is greater than the number of equivalents of base.<br>
The preparation of the ketone of formula (IT), and the conversion of the triflate<br>
of formula (III) to a compound of formula (I), are by known methods. Thus, the<br>
triflate of formula (III), or a protected derivative thereof, may be reacted with a<br>
substituted borane of formula BZlZ2Ai, wherein Ar is as defined above and Z1 and Z2<br>
independently represent hydroxy or alkoxy or alkyl of 1-3 carbon atoms each or Z1<br>
and Z2 together represent an alkylenedioxy group of 2 or 3 carbon atoms; in the<br>
presence of a palladium complex and a polar solvent, using the Suzuki coupling. This<br>
is disclosed in WO-A-93/20097, using a (3-pyridyl)-substituted borane of formula:<br>
BZ1Z2<br>
in which R represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group of 1-4 carbon atoms.<br>
The conversion of the triflate of formula (III) to the following compound<br>
types:<br>
is disclosed in J. Med. Chem. (1995), 38(13), 2463-71 (Potter et al). The<br>
conversion to the following compounds:<br>
is disclosed inArchiv der Pharmazie (2001), 334(12), 373-374 and J. Steroid<br>
Biochem. Molec. Biol. (2003), 84, 555-562 (both Haidar et al.) and in J. Med. Chem.<br>
(2005), 48(8), 2972-2984 (Venkatesh et al.). The conversion to the following:<br>
is disclosed in J. Med. Chem. (1997), 40(20), 3297-3304 (Ling et al.). The<br>
synthesis of the following compounds:<br>
is disclosed in US 5994334 and WO-A-98/33506 (University of Maryland at<br>
Baltimore). All these methods may be vised in the present invention.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be reacted farther to form other<br>
derivatives. Thus they may be reduced as disclosed in J. Med. Chem. (1995), 38(13),<br>
2463-71 (Potter et al), where compounds of the following type are prepared:<br>
using hydrazine and acetic in ethanol, and sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-<br>
aluminium hydride (Red-Al) and zinc chloride hi THF, respectively.<br>
Alternatively they may be oxidized as disclosed in Archiv der Pharmazie<br>
(2001), 334(12), 373-374 (Haidar et al), where the following compound is prepared:<br>
Thus in a further aspect of the invention the compound of formula (I), or a<br>
protected derivative thereof, is further reacted using a reducing agent to give a<br>
compound of formula (IV) or (IVA):<br>
(Figure Removed) wherein R' and Ar are is as defined above.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be prepared as salts, e.g. the hydrochloride<br>
and converted to the free base form and thereafter to such other conventional pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable acid addition salts as acetates, citrates, lactates, alkanesulfonates<br>
(e.g. methanesulfonate), and optionally substituted tartrates as may seem appropriate.<br>
In this specification the term "alky!" includes both straight and branched<br>
chain. An analogous convention applies to other generic terms such as "alkoxy",<br>
"acyl" and "alkylenedioxy".<br>
It is to be understood that all the ketones of formula (II) disclosed may exhibit<br>
the phenomenon of tautomerism and that the formulae shown in this specification<br>
represent only one of the possible tautomeric forms. It is to be understood therefore<br>
that the invention is not limited merely to any one tautomeric form which is<br>
illustrated. For example, the ketone of formula (II) may also exist as an enol of<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following Examples.<br>
(Table Removed) 1. Base added to a mixture of 2 and triflic anhydride.<br>
2. Conversion and % 4 determined by *H NMR.<br>
Repeating the reaction conditions reported in the prior art, using 2,6-di-te/tbutyl-<br>
4-methyl pyridine as the base, went to completion when 1.4 equivalents of base<br>
were used. However, 17 % of the product was the eliminated impurity.<br>
When the conditions were repeated using 2, 6-lutidine and EtsN as the base<br>
(1.4 eq.) the reactions proceeded to around 40 % conversion with no evidence of the<br>
eliminated product 4.<br>
It had been demonstrated that the reaction proceeded further with a higher<br>
equivalency of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl pyridine However,, when 2, 6-lutidine or<br>
EtaN was used as the base, the reaction was inhibited. Therefore the amount of base<br>
was cut to 1 eq. and the conversion increased to 50 % after 90 minutes.<br>
This indicated that the reaction was inhibited by excess base, so the procedure<br>
was changed to a slow addition of the base (0.76 mmol. in 15 minutes) to a mixture of<br>
2 and TfaO. The reaction reached around 80 % conversion in 4.5 hours with EtaN,<br>
2,6-lutidine and iPr2EtN.<br>
When the addition time was extended to 3.5 hours the conversion remained<br>
around 80 % with all the bases. However when the addition time was reduced to 2<br>
minutes the reaction proceeded to only 45 % conversion.<br>
Step 2 - The Suzuki coupling<br>
The Suzuki coupling was performed using reported methods. The product of<br>
the triflate formation was used in the Suzuki coupling unpurified.<br>
BEtz<br>
The optimised route was performed on a 10 g scale. The formation of the<br>
triflate yielded the crude product in an 80 % yield (11.20 g) with a product to starting<br>
material ratio of 3 :1.<br>
The Suzuki reaction was performed on the crude product using a catalyst<br>
loading of 0.5 mol %. The product of the Suzuki reaction was isolated in a<br>
quantitative crude yield (9.54 g). The ratio of product to ketone 2 was 3:1. This yield<br>
was also concurrent with the smaller scale reactions.<br>
The abiraterone acetate was purified by formation and crystallisation of its<br>
methanesulfonate salt from EtOAc/MTBE. The salt was isolated in a 64 % yield (7.65<br>
g) and at 87.7 % purity. This was subsequently recrystallised from a minimum<br>
volume of boiling isopropyl alcohol (95 cm3) to yield the salt in 63 % recovery (4.85<br>
To a stirred solution of dehydroepiandrosterone acetate 2 (10g, 30.3 mmol.) in<br>
CH2C12 (100 cm3, 10 vol.) was added Tf2O (5.60 cm3, 33.3 mmol, 1.1 eq.) and the<br>
reaction was stirred at room temperature for five minutes. A solution of triethylamine<br>
(4.22 cm3, 30.3 mmol, 1.0 eq.) in CH2C12 (100 cm3, 10 vol.) was added over 25<br>
minutes. The resulting purple solution was stirred at room temperature for 3.5 hours.<br>
The reaction was quenched by addition of water (150 cm3, 15 vol.) and the layers<br>
separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with CH2C12 (75 cm3, 7.5 vol.) and the<br>
organic layers were combined. The organic fraction was washed with 2N HC1 (75<br>
cm3,7.5 vol.) and brine (75 cm3, 7.5 vol.). The organic layer was treated with MgSC&gt;4<br>
and activated charcoal (7.0 g, 0.7 wt eq.) for 10 minutes. The suspension was filtered<br>
through a pad of Celite™ and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to<br>
-14-<br>
yield a brown oil, 11.20g (80 % crude yield). 1H NMR (CDC13) showed the ratio of<br>
product 3 to starting material 2 to be 3 : 1<br>
Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (97 mg, 0.14 mmol, 0.006 eq), diethyl (3-pyridyl)borane (6.11g,<br>
41.5 mmol, 1.7 eq.) and 2MNa2CO3 (aq) (55 cm3, 111 mmol, 4.5 eq.) were added<br>
consecutively to a stirred solution of the mixture of triflate 3 and ketone 2 (11.20 g,<br>
27.7 mmol assuming all substrate is triflate 3) in THF (130 cm3, 10 vol.). The<br>
reaction was heated to 80 °C and stirred at this temperature for 5 hours, The reaction<br>
was cooled to room temperature and partitioned between ethyl acetate (130 cm3, 11<br>
vol.) and water (130 cm3, 11 vol.). The layers were separated and the aqueous layer<br>
extracted with ethyl acetate (65 cm3, 5.5 vol.)- The combined organic layers were<br>
dried over MgSCXj and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield a brown oil. This<br>
oil was stirred in MeOH (35 cm3, 3 vol.) and was gently warmed with a hot air gun. A<br>
white solid (unreacted diethyl (3-pyridyl)borane) precipitated and was filtered. The<br>
filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield a brown oil (9.54g, 100 %<br>
yield). ]H NMR showed that mis material was a 3 :1 mixture of abiraterone acetate 1<br>
1.86 cm3, 25.6 mmol, 1.05 eq) was added to a stirred<br>
solution of the mixture of 1 and 2 (9.54 g, 24.4 mmol assuming entirely steroid 1) in a<br>
mixture of MTBE (50 cm3, 5 vol.) and ethyl acetate (50 cm3, 5 vol.). The resulting<br>
thick suspension was filtered and the cake washed with MTBE (10 cm3, 1 vol.). The<br>
cake was dried in air to yield a tan solid (7.65 g, 64 % yield based on all starting<br>
material being steroid 1, 87.7 % purity by HPLC). The salt was recrystallised from<br>
boiling isopropyl alcohol (95 cm3) to yield a tan solid (4.85 g, 41 % yield, 96.4 %<br>
purity by HPLC).<br>
Example 3: Further investigations into reaction steps<br>
As noted in Example 1, it has been noted that the formation of the triflate, 3,<br>
may depend on a number of factors:<br>
1. The nature of the base used in the reaction;<br>
2. The relative stoichiometries between the base and DHEA, 2;<br>
3. The nature of the solvent used;<br>
4. The reaction time.<br>
A range of bases of varying basicity and character was used in the formation<br>
of triflate, 3. Reactions using each of these bases were performed in a variety of<br>
solvents. Dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane and chloroform were investigated in<br>
order to expand the range of chlorinated solvents utilised for the triflate formation.<br>
Ethyl acetate, methyl tert-butyl methyl ether and iso-hexane were studied in order to<br>
expand the nature of the solvents tested.<br>
Each reaction was performed using 250 mg of DHEA, 2, in 20 volumes of the<br>
solvent. Trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (1.1 eq.) was added to the solution<br>
followed by the base (1.0 eq.) after 15 minutes. After 2 hours, a sample of each<br>
reaction was quenched into methanol and the reactions examined by LCMS.<br>
Reactions performed in ethers and hydrocarbons showed problems with<br>
solubility of the reactant along with their reactivity.<br>
Chlorinated compounds proved to be the optimal family of solvents for use in<br>
this reaction. It was noted that on the whole, reactions in dichloromethane and 1,2-<br>
dichloroethane were comparable whereas those in chloroform were retarded to some<br>
degree.<br>
The levels of the eliminated product, 5, could not be detected by LCMS.<br>
Therefore selected samples were concentrated and the 'H NMR of the residue was<br>
taken. These samples were selected due to their higher levels of impurities shown in<br>
the LCMS. The level of the eliminated product was not detected at over 10 % levels<br>
in any of the reactions and was not detected at all when DABCO and DBU were used.<br>
It should be noted that from the initial studies using 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-<br>
methylpyridine that if the reaction was halted before completion, the levels of the<br>
eliminated product, 5, were much reduced. Only when the equivalents of the base<br>
were increased did the level of elimination increase. The bases subsequently used<br>
above never drove the reaction to completion. If excess base were used the reaction<br>
stalled and if the reaction time was extended other competing side reactions<br>
decomposed the product to species other than 5.<br>
-18-<br>
Optimisation of the reaction profile of the triflate formation.<br>
It had already been noted that the addition rate of the base to the reaction had<br>
a major effect on the yield of the reaction. In addition, the product decomposed if the<br>
reaction was left unquenched overnight The effect of the relative timings of the<br>
addition of TfaO and EtsN, as well as the total reaction time, were explored.<br>
Each reaction was performed on a 500 mg scale under standard conditions.<br>
Samples were taken at the prescribed times and partitioned between ethyl acetate and<br>
water. The organic layer was concentrated and the residue tested by *H NMR.<br>
Results are shown in Table 4. Any decomposition of the product was detected<br>
by the change in the shape of the aliphatic region of the spectra and could therefore<br>
only be qualitatively described.<br>
Significant<br>
The first point to note is that the formation of the triflate started to occur<br>
without the presence of the base, but addition of the bases increased the rate of<br>
reaction.<br>
The results also indicated that the reaction was essentially complete 1 hour<br>
after the addition of the base. Extension of the reaction time beyond an hour resulted<br>
in a reduction in the quality of the triflate due to decomposition of the product.<br>
-19-<br>
Any decomposition occurring was not forming the eliminated product, 5, but<br>
other unidentified compounds.<br>
Examination of the optimum relative stoichiometrv for the triflate formation<br>
It had already been noted that the use of large excesses of base lead to poor<br>
conversion of DHEA, 2, to the triflate, 3, and that use of large excesses of Tf2O lead<br>
to rapid decomposition of the product. We wanted to investigate the effect of<br>
changing the relative stoichiometry of the two reactants across a narrow range.<br>
Each reaction was performed using 250 mg of DHEA under standard<br>
conditions. Triethylamine was added 15 minutes after the addition of TfzO and the<br>
reaction sampled after 2 hours. Results are shown in (Table Removed)<br>
