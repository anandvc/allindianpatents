The present invention relates to novel derivatives of human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and fragments thereof and analogues of such fragments which have a protracted profile of action and to methods of making and using them.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Peptides are widely used in medical practice, and since they can be produced by recombinant DNA technology it can be expected that their importance will increase also in the years to come. When native peptides or analogues thereof are used in therapy it is generally found that they have a high clearance. A high clearance of a therapeutic agent is inconvenient in cases where it is desired to maintain a high blood level thereof over a prolonged period of time since repeated administrations will then be necessary. Examples of peptides which have a high clearance are: ACTH, corticotropin-releasing factor, angiotensin, calcitonin, insulin, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1, glucagon-like peptide-2, insulin-like growth factor-1, insulin-like growth factor-2, gastric inhibitory peptide, growth hormone-releasing factor, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide, secretin, enterogastrin, somatostatin, somatotropin, somatomedin, parathyroid hormone, thrombopoietin, erythropoietin, hypothalamic releasing factors, prolactin, thyroid stimulating hormones, endorphins, enkephalins, vasopressin, oxytocin, opiods and analogues thereof, superoxide dismutase, interferon, asparaginase, arginase, arginine deaminase, adenosine deaminase and ribonuclease. In some cases it is possible to influence the release profile of peptides by applying suitable pharmaceutical compositions, but this approach has various shortcomings and is not generally applicable.<br>
The hormones regulating insulin secretion belong to the so-called enteroinsular axis, designating a group of hormones, released from the gastrointestinal mucosa in response to the presence and absorption of nutrients in the gut, which promote an early and potentiated release of insulin. The enhancing effect on insulin secretion, the so-called incretin effect, is probably essential for a normal glucose tolerance. Many of the gastrointestinal   hormones,   including   gastrin   and   secretin   (cholecystokinin   is   not<br><br>
insulinotropic in man), are insulinotropic, but the only physiologically important ones, those that are responsible for the incretin effect, are the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, GIP, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Because of its insulinotropic effect, GIF, isolated in 1973 (1) immediately attracted considerable interest among diabetologists. However, numerous investigations carried out during the following years clearly indicated that a defective secretion of GIP was not involved in the pathogenesis of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) (2). Furthermore, as an insulinotropic hormone, GIF was found to be almost ineffective in NiDDM (2). The other incretin hormone, GLP-1 is the most potent insulinotropic substance known (3). Unlike GIF, it is surprisingly effective in stimulating insulin secretion in NIDDM patients. In addition, and in contrast to the other insulinotropic hormones (perhaps with the exception of secretin) it also potently inhibits glucagon secretion. Because of these actions it has pronounced blood glucose lowering effects particularly in patients with NIDDM.<br>
GLP-1, a product of the proglucagon (4), is one of the youngest members of the secretin-VIF family of peptides, but is already established as an important gut hormone with regulatory function in glucose metabolism and gastrointestinal secretion and metabolism (5). The glucagon gene is processed differently in the pancreas and in the intestine. In the pancreas (9), the processing leads to the formation and parallel secretion of 1) glucagon itself, occupying positions 33-61 of proglucagon (FG); 2) an N-terminal peptide of 30 amino acids (PG (1-30)) often called glicentin-related pancreatic peptide, GRPP (10, 11); 3) a hexapeptide corresponding to FG (64-69); 4) and, finally, the so-called major proglucagon fragment (FG (72-158)), in which the two glucagon-like sequences are buried (9). Glucagon seems to be the only biologically active product. In contrast, in the intestinal mucosa, it is glucagon that is buried in a larger molecule, while the two glucagon-like peptides are formed separately (8). The following products are formed and secreted in parallel: 1) glicentin, corresponding to FG (1-69), with the glucagon sequence occupying residues Nos. 33-61 (12); 2) GLF-1(7-36)amide (PG (78-107))amide (13), not as originally believed PG (72-107)amide or 108, which is inactive). Small amounts of C-terminally glycine-extended but equally bioactive GLF-1(7-37), (FG (78-108)) are also formed (14); 3) intervening peptide-2 (PG (111-122)amide) (15); and 4) GLF-2 (FG (126-158)) (15, 16). A fraction of glicentin is cleaved further into GRPP (PG (1-30)) and oxyntomodulin (PG (33-69)) (17,18). Of these peptides, GLP-1, has the most conspicuous biological activities.<br>
Being secreted in parallel with glicentin/enteroglucagon, it follows that the many studies of enteroglucagon secretion (6, 7) to some extent also apply to GLF-1 secretion, but GLP-1 is metabolised more quickly with a plasma half-life in humans of 2 min (19). Carbohydrate<br><br>
or fat-rich meals stimulate secretion (20), presumably as a result of direct interaction of yet unabsorbed nutrients with the microvilli of the open-type L-cells of the gut mucosa. Endocrine or neural mechanisms promoting GLP-1 secretion may exist but have not yet been demonstrated in humans.<br>
The incretin function of GLP-1 (29-31) has been clearly illustrated in experiments with the GLP-1 receptor antagonist, exendin 9-39, which dramatically reduces the incretin effect elicited by oral glucose in rats (21, 22). The hormone interacts directly with the p-cells via the GLP-1 receptor (23) which belongs to the glucagonA/IP/calcitonin family of G-protein-coupled /-transmembrane spanning receptors. The importance of the GLP-1 receptor in regulating insulin secretion was illustrated in recent experiments in which a targeted disruption of the GLP-1 receptor gene was carried out in mice. Animals homozygous for the disruption had greatly deteriorated glucose tolerance and fasting hyperglycaemia, and even heterozygous animals were glucose intolerant (24). The signal transduction mechanism (25) primarily involves activation of adenylate cyclase, but elevations of intracellular Ca2+ are also essential (25, 26). The action of the hormone is best described as a potentiation of glucose stimulated insulin release (25), but the mechanism that couples glucose and GLP-1 stimulation is not known. It may involve a calcium-induced calcium release (26, 27). As already mentioned, the insulinotropic action of GLP-1 is preserved in diabetic p-cells. The relation of the latter to its ability to convey "glucose competence" to isolated insulin-secreting cells (26, 28), which respond poorly to glucose or GLP-1 alone, but fully to a combination of the two, is also not known. Equally importantly, however, the hormone also potently inhibits glucagon secretion (29). The mechanism is not known, but seems to be paracrine, via neighbouring insulin or somatostatin cells (25). Also the glucagonostatic action is glucose-dependent, so that the inhibitory effect decreases as blood glucose decreases. Because of this dual effect, if the plasma GLP-1 concentrations increase either by increased secretion or by exogenous infusion the molar ratio of insulin to glucagon in the blood that reaches the liver via the portal circulation is greatly increased, whereby hepatic glucose production decreases (30). As a result blood glucose concentrations decrease. Because of the glucose dependency of the insulinotropic and glucagonostatic actions, the glucose lowering effect is self-limiting, and the hormone, therefore, does not cause hypoglycaemia regardless of dose (31). The effects are preserved in patients with diabetes mellitus (32), in whom infusions of slightly supraphysiological doses of GLP-1 may completely normalise blood glucose values in spite of poor metabolic control and secondary failure to sulphonylurea (33). The importance of the glucagonostatic effect is illustrated by the finding that GLP-1 also lowers blood glucose in type-1 diabetic patients without residual p-cell secretory capacity (34).<br><br>
In addition to its effects on the pancreatic islets, GLP-1 has powerful actions on the gastrointestinal tract. Infused in physiological amounts, GLP-1 potently inhibits pentagastrin-induced as well as meal-induced gastric acid secretion (35, 36). It also inhibits gastric emptying rate and pancreatic enzyme secretion (36). Similar inhibitory effects on gastric and pancreatic secretion and motility may be elicited in humans upon perfusion of the ileum with carbohydrate- or lipid-containing solutions (37, 38). Concomitantly, GLP-1 secretion is greatly stimulated, and it has been speculated that GLP-1 may be at least partly responsible for this so-called "ileal-brake" effect (38). In fact, recent studies suggest that, physiologically, the ileal-brake effects of GLP-1 may be more important than its effects on the pancreatic islets. Thus, in dose response studies GLP-1 influences gastric emptying rate at infusion rates at least as low as those required to influence Islet secretion (39).<br>
GLP-1 seems to have an effect on food intake. Intraventricular administration of GLP-1 profoundly inhibits food intake in rats (40, 42). This effect seems to be highly specific. Thus, N-terminally extended GLP-1 (PG 72-107)amide is inactive and appropriate doses of the GLP-1 antagonist, exendin 9-39, abolish the effects of GLP-1 (41). Acute, peripheral administration of GLP-1 does not inhibit food intake acutely in rats (41, 42). However, it remains possible that GLP-1 secreted from the intestinal L-cells may also act as a satiety signal.<br>
Not only the insulinotropic effects but also the effects of GLP-1 on the gastrointestinal tract are preserved in diabetic patients (43), and may help curtailing meal-induced glucose excursions, but, more importantly, may also influence food intake. Administered intravenously, continuously for one week, GLP-1 at 4 ng/kg/min has been demonstrated to dramatically improve glycaemic control in NIDDM patients without significant side effects (44). The peptide is fully active after subcutaneous administration (45), but is rapidly degraded mainly due to degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase IV-like enzymes (46, 47).<br>
The amino acid sequence of GLP-1 is given /.a. by Schmidt et al. {Diabetologia 28 704-707 (1985). Although the interesting pharmacological properties of GLP-1 (7-37) and analogues thereof have attracted much attention in recent years only little is known about the structure of these molecules. The secondary structure of GLP-1 in micelles has been described by Thorton et al. {Biochemistry 33 3532-3539 (1994)), but in normal solution,GLP-1 is considered a very flexible molecule. Surprisingly, we found that derivatisation of this relatively small and very flexible molecule resulted in compounds<br><br>
whose plasma profile were highly protracted and still had retained activity.<br>
GLP-1 and analogues of GLP-1 and fragments thereof are potentially useful i.a. in the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, the high clearance limits the usefulness of these compounds, and thus there still is a need for improvements in this field. Accordingly, it is one object of the present invention to provide derivatives of GLP-1 and analogues thereof which have a protracted profile of action relative to GLP-1 (7-37). It is a further object of the invention to provide derivatives of GLP-1 and analogues thereof which have a lower clearance than GLP-1 (7-37). It is a further object of the invention to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound according to the invention and to use a compound of the invention to provide such a composition. Also, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of treating insulin dependent and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Human GLP-1 is a 37 amino acid residue peptide originating from preproglucagon which is synthesised i.a. in the L-cells in the distal ileum, in the pancreas and in the brain. Processing of preproglucagon to give GLP-1 (7-36)amide, GLP-1 (7-37) and GLP-2 occurs mainly in the L-cells. A simple system is used to describe fragments and analogues of this peptide. Thus, for example, Gly-GLP-1(7-37) designates a fragment of GLP-1 formally derived from GLP-1 by deleting the amino acid residues Nos. 1 to 6 and substituting the naturally occurring amino acid residue in position 8 (Ala) by Gly. Similarly, Lys(NMetradecanoyl)-GLP-1(7-37) designates GLP-1 (7-37) wherein the s-amino group of the Lys residue in position 34 has been tetradecanoylated. Where reference in this text is made to C-terminally extended GLP-1 analogues, the amino acid residue in position 38 is Arg unless otherwise indicated, the optional amino acid residue in position 39 is also Arg unless otherwise indicated and the<br><br>
optional amino acid residue in position 40 is Asp unless otherwise indicated. Also, if a C-terminally extended analogue extends to position 41, 42, 43, 44 or 45, the amino acid sequence of this extension is as in the corresponding sequence in human preproglucagon unless otherwise indicated.<br>
In its broadest aspect, the present invention relates to derivatives of GLP-1 and analogues thereof. The derivatives according to the invention have interesting pharmacological properties, in particular they have a more protracted profile of action than the parent peptides.<br>
In the present text, the designation "an analogue" is used to designate a peptide wherein one or more amino acid residues of the parent peptide have been substituted by another amino acid residue and/or wherein one or more amino acid residues of the parent peptide have been deleted and/or wherein one or more amino acid residues have been added to the parent peptide. Such addition can take place either at the N-terminal end or at the C-terminal end of the parent peptide or both.<br>
The term "derivative" is used in the present text to designate a peptide in which one or more of the amino acid residues of the parent peptide have been chemically modified, e.g. by alkylation, acylation, ester formation or amide formation.<br>
The term "a GLP-1 derivative" is used in the present text to designate a derivative of GLP-1 or an analogue thereof. In the present text, the parent peptide from which such a derivative is formally derived is in some places referred to as the "GLP-1 moiety" of the derivative.<br>

In a further preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to the use of a GLP-1 derivative according to the invention for the preparation of a medicament with protracted effect for the treatment of obesity.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of treating insulin dependent or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus in a patient in need of such a treatment, comprising administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a GLP-1 derivative according to claim 1 together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
To obtain a satisfactory protracted profile of action of the GLP-1 derivative, tine lipophilic substituent attached to the GLP-1 nnoiety preferably comprises 4-40 carbon atoms, in particular 8-25 carbon atoms. The lipophilic substituent may be attached to an amino group of the GLP-1 moiety by means of a carboxyl group of the lipophilic substituent which forms an amide bond with an amino group of the amino acid residue to which it is attached. Alternatively, the lipophilic substituent may be attached to said amino acid residue in such a way that an amino group of the lipophilic substituent forms an amide bond with a carboxyl group of the amino acid residue. As a further option, the lipophilic substituent may be linked to the GLP-1 moiety via an ester bond. Formally, the ester can be formed either by reaction between a carboxyl group of the GLP-1 moiety and a hydroxyl group of the substituent-to-be or by reaction between a hydroxyl group of the GLP-1 moiety and a carboxyl group of the substituent-to-be. As a further alternative, the lipophilic substituent can be an alkyl group which is introduced into a primary amino group of the GLP-1 moiety.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the lipophilic substituent is attached to the GLP-1 moiety by means of a spacer in such a way that a carboxyl group of the spacer forms an amide bond with an amino group of the GLP-1 moiety. Examples of suitable spacers are succinic acid, Lys, Glu or Asp, or a dipeptide such as Gly-Lys. When the spacer is succinic acid, one carboxyl group thereof may form an amide bond with an amino group of the amino acid residue, and the other carboxyl group thereof may form an amide bond with an amino group of the lipophilic substituent. When the spacer is Lys, Glu or Asp, the carboxyl group thereof may form an amide bond with an amino group of the amino acid residue, and the amino group thereof may form an amide bond with a carboxyl group of the lipophilic substituent When Lys is used as the spacer, a further spacer may in some instances be inserted between the s-amino group of Lys and the lipophilic substituent. In one preferred embodiment, such a further spacer is succinic acid which forms an amide bond with the s-amino group of Lys and with an amino group present in the lipophilic substituent. In another preferred embodiment such a further spacer is Glu or Asp which forms an amide bond with the 8-amino group of Lys and another amide bond with a carboxyl group present in the lipophilic substituent, that is, the lipophilic substituent is a N'-acylated lysine residue.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the lipophilic substituent has a group which can be negatively charged. One preferred group which can be negatively<br><br>
charged is a carboxylic acid group.<br>
Tine parent peptide can be produced by a method which comprises culturing a host cell containing a DNA sequence encoding the polypeptide and capable of expressing the polypeptide in a suitable nutrient medium under conditions permitting the expression of the peptide, after which the resulting peptide is recovered from the culture.<br>
The medium used to culture the cells may be any conventional medium suitable for growing the host cells, such as minimal or complex media containing appropriate supplements. Suit¬able media are available from commercial suppliers or may be prepared according to published recipes (e.g. in catalogues of the American Type Culture Collection). The peptide produced by the cells may then be recovered from the culture medium by conventional procedures including separating the host cells from the medium by centrifugation or filtration, precipitating the proteinaceous components of the supernatant or filtrate by means of a salt, e.g. ammonium sulphate, purification by a variety of chromatographic procedures, e.g. ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, affinity chromatography, or the like, dependent on the type of peptide in question.<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the parent peptide may suitably be of genomic or cDNA origin, for instance obtained by preparing a genomic or cDNA library and screening for DNA sequences coding for all or part of the peptide by hybridisation using synthetic oligonucleotide probes in accordance with standard techniques (see, for example, Sambroolc, J, Fritsch, EF and Maniatis, T, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York, 1989). The DNA sequence encoding the peptide may also be prepared synthetically by established standard methods, e.g. the phosphoamidite method described by Beaucage and Caruthers, Tetrahedron Letters 22 (1981), 1859 -1869, or the method described by Matthes etal., EM BO Journal 3 {1QQ4), 801 - 805. The DNA sequence may also be prepared by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers, for instance as described in US 4,683,202 or Saiki et al., Science 239 (1988), 487 -491.<br>
The DNA sequence may be inserted into any vector which may conveniently be subjected to recombinant DNA procedures, and the choice of vector will often depend on the host cell into which it is to be introduced. Thus, the vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e.<br><br>
a vector which exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g. a plasmid. Alternatively, the vector may be one which, when introduced into a host cell, is integrated into the host cell genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated.<br>
The vector is preferably an expression vector in which the DNA sequence encoding the peptide is operably linked to additional segments required for transcription of the DNA, such as a promoter. The promoter may be any DNA sequence which shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice and may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to the host cell. Examples of suitable promoters for directing the transcription of the DNA encoding the peptide of the invention in a variety of host cells are well known in the art, cf. for instance Sambrook e a/., supra.<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the peptide may also, if necessary, be operably connected to a suitable terminator, polyadenylation signals, transcriptional enhancer sequences, and translational enhancer sequences. The recombinant vector of the invention may further comprise a DNA sequence enabling the vector to replicate in the host cell in question.<br>
The vector may also comprise a selectable marker, e.g. a gene the product of which complements a defect in the host cell or one which confers resistance to a drug, e.g. ampicillin, kanamycin, tetracydin, chloramphenicol, neomycin, hygromycin or methotrexate.<br>
To direct a parent peptide of the present invention into the secretory pathway of the host cells, a secretory signal sequence (also known as a leader sequence, prepro sequence or pre sequence) may be provided in the recombinant vector. The secretory signal sequence is joined to the DNA sequence encoding the peptide in the correct reading frame. Secretory signal sequences are commonly positioned 5' to the DNA sequence encoding the peptide. The secretory signal sequence may be that normally associated with the peptide or may be from a gene encoding another secreted protein.<br>
The procedures used to ligate the DNA sequences coding for the present peptide, the promoter and optionally the terminator and/or secretory signal sequence, respectively, and to insert them into suitable vectors containing the information necessary for replication, are well known to persons skilled in the art (cf., for instance, Sambrook at al.., supra).<br><br>
The host cell into which the DNA sequence or the recombinant vector is introduced may be any cell which is capable of producing the present peptide and includes bacteria, yeast, fungi and higher eukaryotic cells. Examples of suitable host cells well known and used in the art are, without limitation, £ coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or mammalian BHK or CHO cell lines.<br>
Examples of compounds which can be useful as GLP-1 moieties according to the present invention are described in International Patent Application No. WO 87/06941 (The General Hospital Corporation) which relates to a peptide fragment which comprises GLP-1 (7-37) and functional derivatives thereof and to its use as an insulinotropic agent.<br>
Further GLP-1 analogues are described in International Patent Application No. 90/11296 (The General Hospital Corporation) which relates to peptide fragments which comprise GLP-1 (7-36) and functional derivatives thereof and have an insulinotropic activity which exceeds the insulinotropic activity of GLP-1 (1-36) or GLP-1 (1-37) and to their use as insulinotropic agents.<br>
International Patent Application No. 91/11457 (Buckley et al..) discloses analogues of the active GLP-1 peptides 7-34, 7-35, 7-36, and 7-37 which can also be useful as GLP-1 moieties according to the present invention.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions containing a GLP-1 derivative according to the present invention may be administered parenterally to patients in need of such a treatment. Parenteral administration may be performed by subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection by means of a syringe, optionally a pen-like syringe. Alternatively, parenteral administration can be performed by means of an infusion pump. A further option is a composition which may be a powder or a liquid for the administration of the GLP-1 derivative in the form of a nasal or pulmonal spray. As a still further option, the GLP-1 derivatives of the invention can also be administered transdermally, e.g. from a patch, optionally a iontophoretic patch, or transmucosally, e.g. bucally.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions containing a GLP-1 derivative of the present invention may be prepared by conventional techniques, e.g. as described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 1985 or in Remington: Tiie Science and Practice of Pharmacy, Q edition, 1995.<br>
Thus, the injectable compositions of the GLP-1 derivative of the invention can be prepared using the conventional techniques of the pharmaceutical industry which involves dissolving and mixing the ingredients as appropriate to give the desired end product.<br>
According to one procedure, the GLP-1 derivative is dissolved in an amount of water which is somewhat less than the final volume of the composition to be prepared. An isotonic agent, a preservative and a buffer is added as required and the pH value of the solution is adjusted - if necessary - using an acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid, or a base, e.g. aqueous sodium hydroxide as needed. Finally, the volume of the solution is adjusted with water to give the desired concentration of the ingredients.<br>
Examples of isotonic agents are sodium chloride, mannitol and glycerol.<br>
Examples of preservatives are phenol, m-cresol, methyl p-hydroxybenzoate and benzyl alcohol.<br>
Examples of suitable buffers are sodium acetate and sodium phosphate.<br>
Further to the above-mentioned components, solutions containing a GLP-1 derivative according to the present invention may also contain a surfactant in order to improve the solubility and/or the stability of the GLP-1 derivative.<br>
A composition for nasal administration of certain peptides may, for example, be prepared as described in European Patent No. 272097 (to Novo Nordisk A/S) or in WO 93/18785.<br>
According to one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the GLP-1 derivative is provided in the form of a composition suitable for administration by injection. Such a composition can either be an injectable solution ready for use or it can be an amount of a solid composition, e.g. a lyophilised product, which has to be dissolved in a solvent before it<br><br>
can be injected. The injectable solution preferably contains not less than about 2 mg/ml, preferably not less than about 5 mg/ml, more preferred not less than about 10 mg/ml of the GLP-1 derivative and, preferably, not more than about 100 mg/ml of the GLP-1 derivative.<br>
The GLP-1 derivatives of this invention can be used in the treatment of various diseases. The particular GLP-1 derivative to be used and the optimal dose level for any patient will depend on the disease to be treated and on a variety of factors including the efficacy of the specific peptide derivative employed, the age, body weight, physical activity, and diet of the patient, on a possible combination with other drugs, and on the severity of the case. It is recommended that the dosage of the GLP-1 derivative of this invention be determined for each individual patient by those skilled in the art.<br>
In particular, it is envisaged that the GLP-1 derivative will be useful for the preparation of a medicament with a protracted profile of action for the treatment of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and/or for the treatment of obesity.<br>
The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples which, however, are not to be construed as limiting the scope of protection.

Plasma Desorption Mass Spectrometry<br>
Sample preparation:<br>
The sample is dissolved in 0.1 % TFA/EtOH (1:1) at a concentration of 1 pg/pl. The sample solution (5-10 pi) is placed on a nitrocellulose target (Bio-ion AB, Uppsala, Sweden) and allowed to adsorb to the target surface for 2 minutes. The target is subsequently rinsed with 2x25 |jl 0.1 % TFA and spin-dried. Finally, the nitrocellulose target is placed in a target carrousel and introduced into the mass spectrometer.<br>
MS analysis:<br>
PDMS analysis was carried out using a Bio-ion 20 time-of flight instrument (Bio-ion Nordic AB, Uppsala, Sweden). An acceleration voltage of 15 kV was applied and molecular ions formed by bombardment of the nitrocellulose surface with 252-Cf fission fragments were accelerated towards a stop detector. The resulting time-of-flight spectrum was calibrated<br><br>
into a true mass spectrum using the H* and NO* ions at m/z 1 and 30, respectively. Mass spectra were generally accumulated for 1.0x10 fission events corresponding to 15-20 minutes. Resulting assigned masses all correspond to isotopically averaged molecular masses. The accuracy of mass assignment is generally better than 0.1 %.<br>
MALDI-MS<br>
MALDI-TOF MS analysis was carried out using a Voyager RP instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA) equipped with delayed extraction and operated in linear mode. Alpha-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid was used as matrix, and mass assignments were based on external calibration.<br>
Example 1<br>
Synthesis of Lys2®(NMetradecanoyl)-GLP-1(7-37).<br>

A mixture of GLP-1(7-37) (25 mg, 7.45 pm), EDPA (26.7 mg, 208 pm), NMP (520 |il) and water (260 |j,l) was gently shaken for 5 min. at room temperature. To the resulting mixture was added a solution of Myr-ONSu (2.5 mg, 7.67 pm) in NMP (62.5 |il), the reaction mixture was gently shaken for 5 min. at room temperature and then allowed to stand for 20 min. An additional amount of Myr-ONSu (2.5 mg, 7.67 pm) in NMP (62.5 \x\) was added and the resulting mixture gently shaken for 5 min. After a total reaction time of 40 min. the reaction was quenched by the addition of a solution of glycine (12.5 mg, 166 pmol) in 50% aqueous ethanol (12.5 ml). The title compound was isolated from the reaction mixture by HPLC using a cyanopropyl column (Zorbax 300SB-CN) and a standard acetonitrile/TFA system, yield: 1.3 mg (corresponding to 4.9% of the theoretical yield). The column was heated to 65°C and the acetonitrile gradient was 0-100% in 60 minutes. The isolated product was analysed by PDMS and the m/z value for the protonated molecular ion was found to be 3567.9±3. The resulting molecular weight is thus 3566.9±3 amu (theoretical value: 3565.9 amu). The position of acylation (Lys26) was verified by enzymatic cleavage of the title compound with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and subsequent mass determination of the peptide fragments by PDMS.<br><br>

BIOLOGICAL FINDINGS<br>
Protraction of GLP-1 derivatives after s.c. administration<br>
The protraction of a number GLP-1 derivatives of the invention was determined by monitoring the concentration thereof in plasma after sc administration to healthy pigs, using the method described below. For comparison also the concentration in plasma of GLP-1 (7-37) after sc. administration was followed. The results are given in Table 1. The protraction of other GLP-1 derivatives of the invention can be determined in the same way.<br>
Pigs (50% Duroc, 25% Yorkshire, 25% Danish Landrace, app 40 kg) were fasted from the beginning of the experiment. To each pig 0.5 nmol of test compound per kg body weight was administered in a 50 pM isotonic solution (5 mM phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.02% Tween®-20 (Merck), 45 mg/ml mannitol (pyrogen free, Novo Nordisk). Blood samples were drawn from a catheter in vena jugularis at the hours indicated in Table 1. 5 ml of the blood samples were poured into chilled glasses containing 175 pi of the following solution: 0.18 M EDTA, 1500 KIE/ml aprotinin (Novo Nordisk) and 3% bacitracin (Sigma), pH 7.4. Within 30 min, the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 5-6000*g. Temperature was kept at 4°C. The supernatant was pipetted into different glasses and kept at minus 20°C until use.<br>
The plasma concentrations of the peptides were determined by RIA using a monoclonal antibody specific for the N-terminal region of GLP-1 (7-37). The cross reactivities were less<br><br>
than 1% with GLP-1(1-37) and GLP-1(8-36)amide and 
The assay was carried out as follows: 100 |jl plasma was mixed with 271 pi 96% ethanol, mixed using a vortex mixer and centrifuged at 2600*g for 30 min. The supernatant was decanted into Minisorp tubes and evaporated completely (Savant Speedvac AS290). The evaporation residue was reconstituted in the assay buffer consisting of 80 mM NaH2P04/Na2HP04, 0.1 % HSA (Orpha 20/21, Behring), 10 mM EDTA, 0.6 mM thiomersal (Sigma), pH 7.5. Samples were reconstituted in volumes suitable for their expected concentrations, and were allowed to reconstitute for 30 min. To 300 pi sample, 100 pi antibody solution in dilution buffer containing 40 mM NaH2P04/Na2HP04, 0.1 % HSA, 0.6 mM thiomersal, pH 7.5, was added. A non-specific sample was prepared by mixing 300 pi buffer with 100 pi dilution buffer. Individual standards were prepared from freeze dried stocks, dissolved in 300 pi assay buffer. All samples were pre-incubated in Minisorp tubes with antibody as described above for 72 h. 200 pi tracer in dilution buffer containing 6-7000 CPM was added, samples were mixed and incubated for 48 h. 1.5 ml of a suspension of 200 ml per litre of heparin-stabilised bovine plasma and 18 g per litre of activated carbon (Merck) in 40 mM NaH2P04/Na2HP04, 0.6 mM thiomersal, pH 7.5, was added to each tube. Before use, the suspension was mixed and allowed to stand for 2 h at 4°C. All samples were incubated for 1 h at 4°C and then centrifuged at 3400*g for 25 min. Immediately after the centrifugation, the supernatant was decanted and counted in a y-counter. The concentration in the samples was calculated from individual standard curves. The following plasma concentrations were found, calculated as % of the maximum concentration for the individual compounds (n=2):<br><br><br>
■'The test compounds are the title compounds of the examples with the numbers given<br>
As it appears from Table 1, the GLP-1 derivatives of the invention have a protracted profile of action relative to GLP-1 (7-37) and are much more persistent in plasma than GLP-1 (7-37). It also appears from Table 1 that the time at which the peak concentration in plasma is achieved varies within wide limits, depending on the particular GLP-1 derivative selected.<br>
Stimulation of cAlVIP formation in a cell line expressing the cloned human GLP-1 receptor<br>
In order to demonstrate efficacy of the GLP-1 derivatives, their ability to stimulate formation of cAMP in a cell line expressing the cloned human GLP-1 receptor was tested. An EC50 was calculated from the dose-response curve.<br>
Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells expressing the human pancreatic GLP-1 receptor were used (Knudsen and Pridal, 1996, Eur. J. Pharm. 318, 429-435). Plasma membranes were prepared (Adelhorst et al, 1994, J. Biol. Chem. 269, 6275) by homogenisation in buffer (10 mmol/l Tris-HCI and 30 mmol/l NaCI pH 7.4, containing, in addition, 1 mmol/l dithiothreitol, 5 mg/l leupeptin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 5 mg/l pepstatin (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), 100 mg/l bacitracin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 16 mg/l aprotinin (Novo Nordisk A/S,<br><br>
Bagsvaerd, Denmark)). The homogenate was centrifuged on top of a layer of 41 w/v% sucrose. The white band between the two layers was diluted in buffer and centrifuged. Plasma membranes were stored at -80°C until used.<br>
The assay was carried out in 96-well microtiter plates in a total volume of 140 pi. The buffer used was 50 mmol/l Tris-HCI, pH 7.4 with the addition of 1 mmol/l EGTA, 1.5 mmol/l MgS04, 1.7 mmol/l ATP, 20 mM GTP, 2 mmol/l 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 0.01 % Tween-20 and 0.1 % human serum albumin (Reinst, Behringwerke AG, Marburg, Germany). Compounds to be tested for agonist activity were dissolved and diluted in buffer, added to the membrane preparation and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 pi of 0.05 mol/l HCI. Samples were diluted 10 fold before analysis for cAMP by a scintillation proximity assay (RPA 538, Amersham, UK). The following results were found:<br><br><br><br>
