TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to the field of<br>
analytical data processing, and more particularly to a<br>
multidimensional storage model and method for business<br>
intelligence portals and other data processing tools.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Business intelligence systems began largely as<br>
decision support systems (DSS) and executive information<br>
systems (EIS). Decision support systems (DSS) and<br>
executive information systems (EIS) were value added<br>
systems that provided additional information from<br>
existing on-line transactional processing (OLTP) systems.<br>
As business intelligence systems developed, they<br>
integrated decision support system (DSS) functionality<br>
with executive information system (EIS) functionality,<br>
and added on-line analytical processing (OLAP) tools and<br>
management reporting tools. These hybrid business<br>
intelligence systems were gradually moved from a main-<br>
frame environment to a distributed server/desktop<br>
environment to allow greater user access.<br>
More recently, the advent of centralized data<br>
warehouses and datamarts have created a dramatic increase<br>
in available data waiting to be analyzed, exploited and<br>
distributed within an organization. Such data warehouses<br>
 and datamarts, however, were typically optimized for<br>
information delivery rather than transactional<br>
processing. As a result, data warehouses and datamarts<br>
offered only limited solutions for turning stored data<br>
 into useful and strategic tactical information. During<br><br>
this same time, business intelligence systems gained<br>
prominence by offering sophisticated analysis tools for<br>
analyzing large amounts of stored information to support<br>
effective planning and decision making within an<br>
organization.<br>
Such analysis tools provided by business<br>
intelligence systems include multidimensional data cubes<br>
that allow users to view and analyze intersections<br>
between data in different dimensions. A problem with<br>
traditional multidimensional data cubes, however, is that<br>
the size of the data cubes can increase very quickly,<br>
growing to ten or even hundreds of times the size of the..<br>
original database. This is because the data cubes<br>
usually have a large number of intersections . with no<br>
value. These empty intersections are stored to indicate<br>
that the corresponding data does not intersect. Another<br>
problem with traditional data cubes is that they are<br>
closed with all calculations being predefined,<br>
precalculated and stored as part of the data cube. As a<br>
result, if a user requests new calculations that were not<br>
anticipated during definition of a data cube, the whole<br>
cube must be recalculated and regenerated.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a multidimensional<br>
storage model and method that substantially eliminates or<br>
reduces disadvantages and problems associated with<br>
previous systems and methods. In particular, the<br>
multidimensional storage model utilizes a non-sparse<br>
architecture to minimize the size of model. In addition,<br>
the model uses an open architecture to allow calculations<br>
to be dynamically performed after the model is<br>
constructed.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a multidimensional storage model includes a<br>
set of non-sparse entries for each of a plurality of<br>
dimensions. The non-sparse entries each identify an<br>
associated data value. A set of interdimensional links<br>
is provided for each non-sparse entry. The<br>
interdimensional links each identify an intersection<br>
between non-sparse entries in disparate dimensions and<br>
collectively identify all intersections between non-<br>
sparse entries in the dimensions.<br>
More specifically, in accordance with a particular<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the links are bi-<br>
directional and. the non-sparse entries include a pointer<br>
to the associated data value. In this and other<br>
embodiments, the multidimensional storage model may<br>
include a set of calculated values for a calculated<br>
dimension. Each calculated value represents a value at<br>
an intersection between non-sparse entries in disparate<br>
dimensions.<br>
Technical advantages of the present invention<br>
include providing an improved business intelligence<br>
portal that efficiently represents multidimensional data<br><br>
for analysis by a user. The multidimensional storage<br>
model provides interactive pivot views, data drilling for<br>
high and low level analysis and dynamic calculations of<br>
data intersections.<br>
Another technical advantage of the present invention<br>
includes providing an efficient multidimensional storage<br>
model. In particular, the multidimensional storage model<br>
utilizes a non-sparse architecture to minimize system<br>
resources necessary to generate and store the model. The<br>
reduced size of the model improves processing times and<br>
allows efficient pivot and drill operations during data<br>
analysis.<br>
Still another technical advantage of the present<br>
invention includes providing an improved multidimensional<br>
storage model having an open architecture. In<br>
particular, the multidimensional storage model allows<br>
additional calculations to be performed after the model<br>
is constructed. As a result, a user can create new<br>
calculations to analyze data intersections that were not<br>
anticipated during the original definition of the model.<br>
This reduces time and resources needed to support pivot<br>
and drill operations.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a business intelligence system<br>
comprising: a client operable to request a database query for entries in a<br>
plurality of dimensions; a server operable to perform the database query and to<br>
generate a multidimensional storage model based on results of the database<br>
query, the multidimensional storage model comprising: a set of non-sparse<br>
entries for each of the dimensions, each non-sparse entry identifying an<br>
associated data value; a set of interdimensional links for each non-sparse entry,<br>
each interdimensional link identifying an intersection between non-sparse entries<br>
in disparate dimensions; and the interdimensional links collectively identifying all<br>
intersections between non-sparse entries in the dimensions.<br>
The present invention also provides a server for generating a<br>
multidimensional storage model, which is operable to: receive results from a<br>
database query for entries in a plurality of dimensions; generate a set of non-<br>
sparse entries for each of the dimensions; identify an associated data value for<br>
each non-sparse entry; generate a set of interdimensional links collectively<br>
identifying all intersections between non-sparse entries in the dimensions.<br>
The present invention further provides a system for generating a<br>
multidimensional storage model, comprising: means for receiving results from a<br>
database query for entries in a plurality of dimensions; means for generating a<br>
set of non-sparse entries for each of the dimensions; means for identifying an<br>
associated data value for each non-sparse entry; and means for generating a set<br>
of interdimensional links collectively identifying all intersections between non-<br>
sparse entries in the dimensions.<br>
Other technical advantages of the present invention<br>
will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from<br>
the following figures, description, and claims.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIGURE 1 illustrates a business intelligence portal<br>
10 in accordance with one embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Generally described, the business intelligence<br>
portal 10 provides integrated data access and information<br>
sharing across an enterprise, as well as sophisticated<br>
multidimensional analysis tools. The analysis tools are<br>
highly automated and intuitive to allow a wide range of<br>
users to utilize stored information in making strategic<br>
decisions. In this way, the business intelligence portal<br>
10 maximizes decision support benefits users receive from<br>
their data, while minimizing the cost of implementing and<br>
administrating the system.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated by FIGURE 1, the<br>
business intelligence portal 10 implements a three-tier<br>
distributed architecture comprising a database tier 12, a<br>
server tier 14, and a client tier 16 connected by one or<br>
more networks 18. The server and client tiers 14 and 16<br>
are Java-based to support the Internet communication<br>
protocol (TCP/IP), multiple client and server platforms,<br><br>
pooled connections to a wide variety of data sources, and<br>
complete scalability of the portal 10 across an<br>
enterprise. In addition, the Java-based server and<br>
client tiers 14 and 16 provide an open API architecture<br>
that is highly adaptable and functional for processing<br>
structured data in databases as well as unstructured<br>
data. The client/server network 18 comprises a company<br>
Intranet while the server/database network 18 includes<br>
portions of public and private networks. It will be<br>
understood that the business intelligence portal 10 may<br>
be implemented using other suitable architectures,<br>
programming languages, and links.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 1, the database tier 12 includes<br>
one or more databases 20. As described in more detail<br>
below, the databases 2 0 are each exposed as an alias that<br>
contains all the information necessary to connect to the<br>
database 20, including the database login. The use of<br>
database aliases prevents direct user access to the<br>
native database in order to maintain the integrity in the<br>
database 20. For the illustrative embodiment, the<br>
databases 2 0 may each be any Java database connection<br>
(JDBC) or object database connection (ODBC) compliant<br>
database, as well as a suitable data warehouse or<br>
datamart.<br>
The server tier 14 includes one or more servers 30.<br>
The servers 30 each comprise a set of Java-based<br>
applications that can operate on different platforms. As<br>
described in more detail below, the servers 3 0 provide<br>
hierarchical security, centralized administration, fast<br>
multithreaded pooled data access, and multidimensional<br>
data analysis for the business intelligence portal 10.<br><br>
The server 3 0 includes a catalog 32, a catalog<br>
manager 34, a security manager 36, a query generator 38,<br>
a database access system 40, a cache manager 42, a<br>
multidimensional model manager 44, and a client<br>
administrator 46. The catalog 32 stores all<br>
configurations, documents, and work products created by<br>
administrators and users of the business intelligence<br>
portal 10. This centralizes management of documents,<br>
eliminates redundant and outdated copies residing on<br>
client systems, allows documents to be shared across an<br>
enterprise, and provides continual security for the<br>
documents. The catalog manager 34 manages all shared,<br>
information within the server 30. It will be understood<br>
that such configurations, documents, and work products<br>
may be otherwise suitably stored and managed within the<br>
business intelligence portal 10.<br>
The catalog 32 includes one or more database aliases<br>
50, user profiles 52, security groups 54, and predefined<br>
query models 56 configured by a system administrator.<br>
The catalog 32 also includes one or more portfolios 58<br>
that store related views 60 created by a system user. As<br>
previously described, the database aliases 50 contain all<br>
information necessary to connect to the databases 20.<br>
The use of the database aliases 50 prevents direct user<br>
database access to maintain data integrity in the native<br>
databases 20 and makes it possible for non-technical<br>
users to safely access corporate data without fear of<br>
corruption. In addition, the database aliases 50 also<br>
serve to pool connections to the physical databases 20<br>
and thereby reduce the number of database connections<br>
required to support a large number of clients.<br><br>
The user profiles 52 each define a specific range of<br>
privileges for a user and one or more security groups 54<br>
to which a user has access. The user profiles 52 are<br>
generated and maintained by a system administrator. The<br>
security groups 54 implement a hierarchical security<br>
model . with security rights and privileges assigned to<br>
each group 54 by a system administrator. An<br>
administrator security group is provided to allow<br>
administrators full access to the system, including<br>
permissions to add, modify, and delete security groups 54<br>
and user profiles 52 in the system. The final security<br>
rights and privileges that a user inherits are the union<br>
of his or her individual rights as defined in the user<br>
profiles 52 and the rights of each security group 54 to<br>
which he or she belongs. In this way, exposure of system<br>
features to users is controlled through the extensive use<br>
of permissions, or privileges, which are assigned or<br>
withheld from security groups 54 or individual user<br>
profiles 52. Thus, while administrators may have the<br>
ability to connect to databases 20 and add or delete<br>
users, power users might not have this permission.<br>
Instead, power users may have access to a full range of<br>
data analysis and collaboration. features, while<br>
information consumers may only be able to run and adapt<br>
reports or charts that were previously defined by an<br>
administrator or power user.<br>
The predefined query models 56 are self-contained<br>
logical models of particular databases that are<br>
established to make query creation by less technical<br>
users easily and intuitive. The predefined query models<br>
56 further abstract data from a database 20, exposing<br>
only those portions of the database 2 0 that is relevant<br><br>
to the group or groups of users who will use the<br>
particular query model 56. The predefined query models<br>
56 include relevant tables from a database, fields within<br>
the database tables, and links between the database<br>
tables that together define a query. The predefined<br>
query models 56 form the basis for all queries created by<br>
users. In this way, the predefined query model 56<br>
controls the elements in any database 2 0 to which any<br>
particular set of users will have access. In addition,<br>
the predefined query models 56 establish mechanisms that<br>
may restrict the type of queries that can be made by any<br>
group of users. In particular, the mechanisms define the<br>
maximum computer resources, or governors, that can be<br>
used to execute the queries, and allowable joins between<br>
tables to prevent run-away or malicious queries that<br>
could impact the integrity of the business intelligence<br>
portal 10.<br>
The portfolios 58 provide a file system for storing<br>
user created or obtained views 60. In addition, to<br>
internally generate views 60, the portfolios 58 may<br>
include, for example, views 60 of word processing<br>
documents, spread sheet documents, and web pages. The<br>
portfolios 58 are each a compound file capable of<br>
restoring a collection of views 60 or other related sets<br>
of data. The views 60 may be stored directly within the<br>
portfolio 58 or linked to each other in the portfolio 58.<br>
Access to the portfolios 58 is determined by<br>
established security parameters for users and<br>
additionally by the creators of the views 60 in the<br>
portfolio 58. In one embodiment, users never see<br>
portfolios 58 to which they do not have access<br>
privileges. In addition, the portfolios 58 may be<br><br>
customized to provide automatic notification to<br>
associated users when views 60 within the portfolio 58<br>
have been updated or otherwise modified. In this way,<br>
security is made integral to the operation of the system<br>
which facilitates collaboration and information sharing<br>
within an enterprise.<br>
The views 60 provide data for displaying a wide<br>
variety of formats, such as, for example, tables, graphs,<br>
reports, pivots, and web pages. The views 6 0 may be<br>
either live views representing current data or snapshot<br>
views of data at a particular point in time. In<br>
addition, as described in more detail below, live views<br>
60 may be scheduled to be updated automatically at<br>
regular intervals, updated when first opened, and the<br>
like. Snapshot views 60 may be set to overwrite prior<br>
snapshots or to create a sequence of snapshot or rollover<br>
views 60 for historical analysis. The views 60 and<br>
portfolios 5 8 can be saved privately by a user or may be<br>
distributed or shared among one or more security groups<br>
54 to facilitate collaboration and decision making.<br>
The security manager 36 manages security in the<br>
business intelligence portal 10. In particular, the<br>
security manager. 36 includes predefined security tasks<br>
for generating and maintaining user profiles 52 and<br>
security groups 54. The security manager 36 also<br>
provides a security hierarchy that allows user profiles<br>
62 and security groups 54 to inherit privileges from<br>
parent classes. In this way, a system administrator can<br>
easily establish and maintain security for the business<br>
intelligence portal 10.<br><br>
The query generator 38 provides graphical views of<br>
database elements to assist system administrators and<br>
power users in defining the query models 56. The<br>
predefined query models 56 each define the database<br>
connection, the family of tables and columns exposed from<br>
the database, the allowable join types and combinations,<br>
metadata, execution governors, and aliases for the query.<br>
The predefined query models 56 can be later adapted and<br>
used by a large range of users to perform safe, secure<br>
queries.<br>
The database access system 40 includes functionality<br>
and software for accessing and querying the databases 20<br>
and for returning query results to the server 30 for<br>
manipulation, analysis, and reporting by users. For the<br>
illustrated embodiment, the database access system 40<br>
includes a query scheduler 72, an SQL generator 74, a<br>
connection manager 76, and a Java database<br>
connection(JDBC) 78.<br>
The query scheduler 72 initiates scheduled queries.<br>
As previously discussed, any view 60, including the data<br>
and calculations contained in the view 60, can be set to<br>
refresh from the database 20 according to several<br>
options, including specific time schedules. This allows<br>
views 60 to be easily refreshed to reflect the current<br>
state of the data and users to always work with the most<br>
up-to-date informaition. In addition, snapshot views 60<br>
can be automatically scheduled to create an historical<br>
repository of snapshot views 60 based on the same query.<br>
Thus, for example, a view 60 may be scheduled for updates<br>
at 10:00 p.m. every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and<br>
automatically distributed to a group of users via a<br>
shared portfolio 58.<br><br>
The SQL generator 74 receives user-adapted or<br>
unadapted query models from a user and generates a<br>
textual SQL query for execution by the connection manager<br>
76. In this way, query models which are graphically<br>
displayed and edited by users are automatically converted<br>
to executable database instructions and thereafter<br>
executed. This allows novice users and other information<br>
consumers with little or no programming knowledge to<br>
fully use and benefit from the business intelligence<br>
portal 10.<br>
In one embodiment, the SQL generator 74 includes<br>
dialog specific generators and an SQL parse tree to<br>
generate the textual SQL. The dialog specific generators<br>
correspond to the different types of databases 20<br>
accessed by or used in connection with the business<br>
intelligence portal 10. The dialog-specific generators<br>
may include, for example, Oracle, Sybase, DB2, and MS SQL<br>
generators.<br>
The connection manager 76 receives textual SQL query<br>
requests from the SQL generator 74 and communicates with<br>
the databases 20 to perform the requested queries through<br>
the Java database connection (JDBC) 78. In the<br>
illustrated embodiment, the connection manager includes a<br>
modular query engine 80 including an intelligent dataset<br>
82 and a library of data drivers 84. As described in<br>
more detail below, the data drivers 84 each execute a<br>
predefined database operation. The intelligent dataset<br>
82 selects and orders data drivers 84 from the library as<br>
necessary to perform a query request. As a result,<br>
database access methods are standardized and the dataset<br>
need not be customized for each application.<br><br><br>
The cache manager 42 includes a cache 90 having a<br>
plurality of pages 92 and a process thread 94. The cache<br>
manager 42 receives data extracted from the databases 20<br>
in response to query requests and feeds them into the<br>
pages 92. The cache manager 42 runs asynchronously with<br>
the process thread 94 driving the cache 90 to feed data<br>
into the pages 92. It will be understood that data may<br>
be otherwise suitably received, stored, and initially<br>
processed by the server 30.<br>
The multidimensional model manager 44 generates and<br>
manipulates multidimensional storage models 100. As<br>
described in more detail below, the multidimensional.<br>
storage model 100 utilizes a non-sparse architecture to<br>
minimize the size of the model 100. The reduced size of<br>
the model 100 improves processing times and allows<br>
efficient pivot and drill operations during data<br>
analysis. In addition, the model 100 uses an open<br>
architecture to allow calculations to be dynamically<br>
performed after the model has been constructed. As a<br>
result, users can create new calculations to analyze data<br>
intersections that were not anticipated during the<br>
original definition of the models 100. This reduces time<br>
and resources needed to support pivot and drill<br>
operations.<br>
The client administrator 46 provides a central point<br>
from which the portal 10 manages client administration.<br>
The client administrator 46 provides a zero-<br>
administration architecture that automatically manages<br>
deployment of client applications to maximize user<br>
performance and minimize network traffic, while assuring<br>
the latest applications are always used by the clients.<br><br>
The client tier 16 includes a plurality of clients<br>
110. The clients 110 may be local to or remote from each<br>
other and the server 30. In one embodiment, the clients<br>
110 provide all access, including system administration,<br>
to the server 30. As previously described, all client<br>
110 functions are controlled by a robust set of<br>
permissions stored on the server 30. Permissions are<br>
granted to both individual users and security groups of<br>
users. In this way, the robust functionality of the<br>
business intelligence portal 10 is appropriately<br>
controlled and metered out to all users across the<br>
enterprise without seeming overcomplex to less technical<br>
users.<br>
The client 110 includes a client API 112 and a<br>
graphical user interface (GUI) 114. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, the client 110 is designed with all<br>
components being Java pieces, or Java beans. In this<br>
embodiment, as described in more detail below, the client<br>
110 identifies its components when establishing a<br>
connection with the server 30. This allows efficient<br>
administration of the client 110 and integration of<br>
additional functionality into the client 110.<br>
The. client API 112 comprises a set of Java classes<br>
that define how the client 110 communicates with the<br>
server 30. Because the client API 112 allows any Java<br>
program to communicate with the server 30, an enterprise<br>
may efficiently add additional, custom capabilities for<br>
its clients 110.<br>
The graphical user interface 114 includes a set of<br>
administration panels 116, a set of user panels 118, a<br>
set of wizards 120, a query composer 122, a set of<br>
viewers 124, and a property inspector 126. The<br><br>
administrative and user panels 116 and 118 provide<br>
graphical displays for guiding administrators and users<br>
through their respective operations.<br>
The wizards 120 divide creation processes into one<br>
or more logical steps and guide administrations and users<br>
through the creation process. This assists novice users<br>
and other information consumers without detailed<br>
programming knowledge in performing queries and analyzing<br>
results. In this way, all users within an enterprise are<br>
able to efficiently use the business intelligence portal<br>
10 to extract meaningful data and thereby improve their<br>
area of operation within an enterprise.<br>
The query composer 122 specifies where data comes<br>
from, what substantive data to display, and how it is to<br>
be stored. The query composer 122 provides a graphical<br>
view of predefined query models 56 to allow users to<br>
intuitively understand and alter the models 56 to suit<br>
their particular needs. In one embodiment, the query<br>
composer 122 allows users to only see those data elements<br>
in a model 56 to which they have privileges. The query<br>
composer 122 saves user edits of a predefined query model<br>
56 as a user-adapted query model 128 that can be uploaded<br>
to and executed by the server 30.<br>
The viewer 124 creates a combination of data views<br>
for tables, graphs, reports, pivots, web pages, and the<br>
like. The viewer 124 allows users to easily switch from<br>
any view 60 of data to any other and to sort and filter<br>
data. The views 60 can also be exported to HTML for<br>
publication on a web server or for sharing in the catalog<br>
32. As previously described, data views 60 may be live<br>
or snapshots. Views 60 or portfolios 58 of views 60 can<br>
be saved privately within an individual user's own<br><br>
catalog area or may be distributed and shared among one<br>
or more security groups 54 to facilitate collaboration<br>
and decision making.<br>
Within the viewer 124, a table viewer 130 displays<br>
information as a series of columns and rows. A table<br>
view typically serves as a starting point for developing<br>
ideas because it provides an overall idea of how<br>
information is organized. In the table view, users can<br>
add filters, add calculated fields, and add summary and<br>
subtotal information. Columns can be rearranged, hidden,<br>
and otherwise modified. Content can be sorted and viewed<br>
at different levels.<br>
A report viewer 132 displays data in a report<br>
format. A report view provides a robust, banded report<br>
format and facilitates automatic report generation and<br>
distribution. Users can freely arrange fields and<br>
columns in an interactive graphical design view of a<br>
report while adding calculations, subtotals, groupings,<br>
headers, footers, titles, and graphics.<br>
A graph viewer 134 displays graph views of data in a<br>
wide variety of 2-D and 3-D formats. These formats may<br>
include, for example, bar, pie, line, scatter, and radar<br>
graphs. While working with a graph, users can change the<br>
graph type or contents by filtering data, using a subset<br>
of the original data, and draw multidimensional data.<br>
The graph view can also be changed on the fly, by sorting<br>
the records in a different order, as well as changing the<br>
graph properties.<br>
A pivot viewer 136 provides pivot views displaying<br>
multidimensional, or cubed, data along multiple<br>
dimensions. This allows users to slice and dice<br>
information along disparate dimensions to gain different<br><br>
perspectives on the activities and performance of an<br>
enterprise. The pivot view supports hierarchies in the<br>
multiple dimensions which allows users to perform drill-<br>
down, drill-up and drill-through analysis. As described<br>
in more detail below, the multidimensional views are<br>
generated from the multidimensional storage model 100.<br>
A browser viewer 138 provides a built-in, cross-<br>
platform web browser. This allows users to access work<br>
products and web-based Internet or Intranet environments.<br>
Reports or objects created in other views can be exported<br>
to HTML for posting to websites or display through the<br>
browser interface.<br>
The property inspector 126 allows users to change<br>
display properties of a particular view. In one<br>
embodiment, the property inspector 126 is modeless. In<br>
this embodiment, the property inspector 12 6 applies the<br>
changes while on the screen to allow users to experiment<br>
with different configurations and attributes before<br>
closing the property inspector 122.<br>
Together, the client 110 and server 30 of the<br>
business intelligence portal 10 add a strategic layer to<br>
an enterprise information structure and provides a single<br>
point of entry for integrated query, reporting, and<br>
analysis which are inherently extensible for a wide range<br>
of users. Because the business intelligence portal 10<br>
may be fully integrated across an enterprise, the portal<br>
10 facilitates routine enterprise-wide analysis delivery<br>
and sharing of information. As a result, far more people<br>
within an enterprise will be able to make regular and<br>
productive use of data that already exists for the<br>
enterprise.<br><br>
FIGURE 2 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for<br>
initializing the business intelligence portal 10 in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 2, the method begins at step 200 in<br>
which a system administrator defines the user profiles<br>
52. As previously described, the user profiles 52<br>
provide permissions for users to utilize features within<br>
the system. Next, at step 202, the system administrator<br>
defines security groups 54. As previously described,<br>
final security rights and privileges that a user inherits<br>
are the union of his or her individual rights as defined<br>
in the user profiles 52 and the rights of each security<br>
group 54 to which he or she belongs.<br>
Proceeding to step 204, the system administrator<br>
generates a database alias 50 for each of the databases<br>
20. The database aliases 50 prevent direct user access<br>
to the databases in order to maintain data integrity and<br>
to make it possible for non-technical users to safely<br>
access corporate data without fear of corruption. The<br>
database aliases also serve to pool connections to the<br>
physical databases 20 and thereby reduce the number of<br>
database connections required to support a large number<br>
of clients 110.<br>
Next, at step 206, the system administrator<br>
generates the predefined query models 56 using the query<br>
generator 38. The predefined query models 56 control the<br>
elements in a database 20 to which any particular set of<br>
users will have access. In addition, the predefined<br>
query models 56 restrict the types of queries that can be<br>
executed and define the maximum computer resources that<br>
can be used to execute the queries and the allowable<br><br>
joins between tables to prevent run-away or malicious<br>
queries.<br>
Step 206 leads to the end of the process by which<br>
the system administrator sets up the business<br>
intelligence portal 10 for use within an enterprise. As<br>
part of the setup process, permissions and queries for<br>
users have been defined in order to control access and<br>
distribution of data within the system.<br>
FIGURE 3 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for<br>
generating the predefined query models 56 in accordance<br>
with one embodiment of the present invention. In this<br>
embodiment, specified data within the model is<br>
automatically linked to the extent possible. In<br>
addition, database elements are graphically displayed to<br>
the system administrator to facilitate generation of the<br>
query model 56.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 3, the method begins at step 220<br>
in which the query generator 38 automatically identifies<br>
and displays to a system administrator the tables and<br>
columns of a database 20 for which a query is to be<br>
generated. Next, at step 222, the system administrator<br>
selects a subset of the tables and columns for a<br>
predefined query model 56.<br>
Proceeding to decisional step 224, the query<br>
generator 38 determines whether the database 20 has full<br>
foreign key (FK)/primary key (PK) information. Full<br>
foreign key/primary key information allows data in<br>
disparate tables to be automatically linked.<br>
Accordingly, if the database 20 includes full foreign<br>
key/primary key information, the Yes branch of decisional<br>
step 224 leads to step 226 in which child tables are<br>
automatically linked to parent tables in the predefined<br><br>
query model 56 using the foreign key/primary key<br>
information. Step 226 leads to the end of the process.<br>
At this point, the predefined query model 56 can be saved<br>
or further edits can be made by the system administrator.<br>
Returning to decisional step 224, if full foreign<br>
key/primary key information is not available, the No<br>
branch of decisional step 224 leads to decisional step<br>
228. At decisional step 228, the query generator 38<br>
determines whether full primary key information is<br>
available from the database 20. Provision of full<br>
primary key information allows parent and child tables to<br>
be determined by a database table search. Accordingly,<br>
if full primary key information is available, the Yes<br>
branch of decisional step 228 leads to step 226 where the<br>
database table search is performed to determine parent<br>
and child tables. After the parent and child tables are<br>
determined, they are automatically linked to generate the<br>
predefined query model 56. The predefined query model<br>
may then be saved or further edited by the system<br>
administrator.<br>
Returning to decisional step 228, if full primary<br>
key information is not available, the No branch of<br>
decisional step 228 leads to decisional step 230. At<br>
decisional step 230, the query generator determines<br>
whether unique index information capable of identifying<br>
parent and child tables is available from the database<br>
20. If such unique index information is available, the<br>
Yes branch of decisional step 230 leads to step 226. At<br>
step 226, the unique index information is used to search<br>
the database for parent and child tables. The query<br>
generator 38 then automatically links child and parent<br>
tables to generate the predefined query model 56. The<br><br>
predefined query model may then be saved or further<br>
edited by the system administrator.<br>
Returning to decisional step 230, if unique index<br>
information is not available from the database 20, the No<br>
branch of decisional step 230 leads to step 232. At step<br>
232, the system administrator manually identifies and<br>
links child and parent tables to generate the predefined<br>
query model 56. In this way, the predefined query models<br>
56, are to the extent possible, automatically generated<br>
with minimal administrator interaction. It will be<br>
understood that database tables and other elements may be<br>
otherwise suitably linked.<br>
FIGURE 4 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for<br>
deploying and maintaining client applications in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In this embodiment, client applications are centrally<br>
deployed and maintained from the server 30 using a thin<br>
boot strap applet that is initially used to download Java<br>
classes forming the client applications to the client<br>
110. After this, all upgrades to the client software are<br>
done automatically by the server 30 upon initiation of a<br>
new session by the client 110. Part of the<br>
installation/update procedure includes downloading a<br>
manifest file listing all names and versions of all<br>
modules and resources on a client 110.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 4, the method begins at step 250<br>
in which a new connection to the server 30 is made by the<br>
client 110. At step 252, the boot strap agent on the<br>
client 110 transmits the user's manifest file to the<br>
server 30.<br><br>
Proceeding to step 254, the server 30 compares the<br>
versions of all modules and resources listed in the<br>
manifest file to current versions of the corresponding<br>
files in the server 30. At decisional step 256, the<br>
server 30 determines whether some or all of the modules<br>
or resources are outdated based on the comparison. If<br>
some or all of the modules or resources are outdated, the<br>
Yes branch of decisional step 256 leads to step 258. At<br>
step 258, the server 30 generates an incremental update<br>
for the client 110. The incremental update includes only<br>
the modules that need to be updated.<br>
Next, at step 260, the server transmits the<br>
incremental update to the client 110. At step 262, the<br>
client 110 updates the client side applications based on<br>
the incremental update. At step 264, a new session is<br>
then launched for the update-to-date client 110.<br>
Returning to decisional step 256, if none of the client<br>
applications are outdated, the No branch of decisional<br>
step 256 also leads to step 264 in which a new session is<br>
launched. In this way, the server 30 determines what, if<br>
any, modules (or Java classes) are out-of-date, missing,<br>
or obsolete and then selectively pushes the correct<br>
modules to the user's machine, along with, an updated<br>
manifest. As a result, users never have to manually<br>
update client software and are able to easily roam<br>
between different work stations to log on without<br>
requiring their applications and data files to be<br>
reinstalled on each station. In addition, the client 110<br>
executes quickly and is always up-to-date while<br>
administration is centrally maintained and network<br>
traffic is minimized.<br><br>
FIGURE 5 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for<br>
adapting and executing a query model based on a<br>
predefined query model 56 in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment,<br>
predefined query models 56 are generated and maintained<br>
on the server 30 by an administrator and provided to<br>
users upon request and verification of access privileges.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 5, the method begins at step 280<br>
in which the server 30 receives a request from a user for<br>
a predefined query model 56. Next, at step 2 82, the<br>
server determines an accessible portion of the predefined<br>
query model 56 based on the user's privileges. The.<br>
accessible portion is a portion of the query model 56<br>
that may be viewed by the user. In a particular<br>
embodiment, the accessible portion of the predefined<br>
query model 56 may also be the portion of the query model<br>
editable by the user. Determination of the accessible<br>
portion of the predefined query model 56 may be<br>
accomplished by determining the user's privileges to the<br>
query model and then determining the accessible portion<br>
based on the user's privileges.<br>
In determining the accessible portion of the<br>
predefined query model 56, the server 30 may also<br>
determine a protected portion of the predefined query<br>
model 56. The protective portion is the remaining or<br>
other suitable portion of the predefined query model 56.<br>
As described in more detail below, the query composer 122<br>
may conceal the protective portion of the predefined<br>
query model or otherwise prohibit edits to the protected<br>
portion of the predefined query model.<br><br>
Next, at step 2 84, the server 30 downloads the<br>
predefined- query model 56 to the client 110. At step<br>
286, the query composer 122 displays the accessible<br>
portion of the predefined query model 56 to the user. In<br>
one embodiment, the query composer 122 displays a<br>
graphical view of accessible data elements defining the<br>
predefined query model 56. In displaying the accessible<br>
portion, the query composer 122 may conceal the protected<br>
portion of the predefined query model 56 to prevent<br>
editing and/or viewing of that portion.<br>
Proceeding to step 288, the query composer 122<br>
receives user edits to the predefined query model 56.<br>
User edits may include the selection or deselection of<br>
database tables, columns in the database tables, and<br>
joins between the database tables. Next, at step 290,<br>
the query composer 122 generates a user-adapted query<br>
model 128 based on user edits to the accessible portion<br>
of the predefined query model 56. At step 292, the user-<br>
adapted query model 12 8 is uploaded to the server 30 for<br>
execution.<br>
At step 294, the SQL generator 74 automatically<br>
generates a database query based on the user-adapted<br>
query model 128. The database query comprises textual<br>
SQL that can be executed by the connection manager 7 6 to<br>
perform the query. At step 296, the server 30 receives<br>
the results of the query. As previously described, the<br>
query results are initially stored in the server 30 by<br>
the cache manager 42.<br>
Proceeding to decisional step 298, if the query<br>
includes multidimensional analysis, the Yes branch of<br>
decisional step 298 leads to step 300 in which a<br>
multidimensional storage model 100 is generated based on<br><br>
the results. At step 302, the multidimensional storage<br>
model 100 is used to generate pivot, drill through, and<br>
other views as requested by the user.<br>
Returning to decisional step 298, if<br>
multidimensional analysis is not indicated, the No branch<br>
of decisional step 298 leads to step 304 in which<br>
requested single dimensional views are generated based on<br>
the query results. Steps 302 and 304 each lead to<br>
decisional step 306. At decisional step 306, the server<br>
30 determines whether the user-adapted query model 128<br>
will be stored for later reuse. If the user desires to<br>
save the query model 128, the Yes branch of decisional<br>
step 306 leads to step 308 in which the query model is<br>
saved to a selected portfolio 58 of the user or a<br>
security group 58 to which the user has access. Step 308<br>
and the No branch of decisional step 306 each lead to<br>
decisional step 310.<br>
At decisional step 310, the server 30 determines<br>
whether the query results are to be stored as an<br>
historical snapshot. If a user selects to store the<br>
results as a snapshot, the Yes branch of decisional step<br>
310 leads to step 312 in which the query results are<br>
stored to a selected portfolio 58. Step 312 leads to the<br>
end of the process by which a predefined query model 56<br>
is provided to a user for adaptation and customization.<br>
The predefined query model 56 is displayed and altered<br>
using a graphical view of data elements. This<br>
facilitates robust data analysis by all users and allows<br>
novice users to effectively use available information to<br>
improve operations within their organization.<br><br>
FIGURE 6 is a block diagram illustrating details of<br>
the query engine 80 in accordance with one embodiment of<br>
the present invention. In this embodiment, the query<br>
engine 8 0 includes a library of data drivers 84 and an<br>
intelligent dataset 82 operable in response to a query<br>
request to identify from the library necessary data<br>
drivers 84 to perform the request. The intelligent<br>
dataset 82 is further operable to determine the necessary<br>
order of the data drivers 84 to perform the request, to<br>
generate a driver chain comprising the necessary data<br>
drivers 84 in the necessary order, and to execute in<br>
order the data drivers 84 in the driver chain.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 6, the intelligent dataset 82<br>
generates a driver chain 320 in response to a query<br>
request. The driver chain 320 includes data drivers 322<br>
necessary to perform the requested query. The data<br>
drivers 322 are dynamically selected from the library of<br>
available data drivers 84 and ordered by the intelligent<br>
dataset 82 based on the query request. In one<br>
embodiment, the data drivers 84 in the library are<br>
derived from a base class for which all interface methods<br>
call the next driver in the chain. In this embodiment,<br>
each data driver has a chain priority for placement in a<br>
same relative position within the chain 320. As used<br>
herein, the term each means every one of at least a<br>
subset of the identified items.<br>
For the illustrated embodiment, the driver chain 320<br>
includes data drivers D1, D2, D3, and D4. Data driver D1<br>
performs a fetch database operation which returns<br>
requested records. The returned records are next sorted<br>
by data driver D2 and indexed by data driver D3. Data<br>
driver D4 then performs the requested search on the<br><br>
sorted and indexed data records. In this way, the<br>
modular query engine 8 0 employs standardized access<br>
methods to perform database queries. As a result, the<br>
portal 10 need not be customized for particular database<br>
queries and the cost to provide and maintain the business<br>
intelligence portal 10 is reduced.<br>
FIGURE 7 is a flow diagram illustrating operation of<br>
the modular query engine 80 in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIGURE<br>
7, the method begins at step 340 in which a query request<br>
is received by the intelligent dataset 82. Next, at step<br>
342, the intelligent dataset 82 dynamically' selects data<br>
drivers 84 from the library necessary to perform the<br>
query request.<br>
Proceeding to step 344, the intelligent dataset 82<br>
determines the order of data drivers 84 necessary to<br>
perform the request. At step 346, the intelligent<br>
dataset 82 dynamically constructs a driver chain<br>
comprising the necessary data drivers in the necessary<br>
order to perform the query request.<br>
Next, at step 348, the intelligent dataset executes<br>
the driver chain to perform the query request. Within<br>
the driver chain, the datasets 82 are executed in order<br>
with each calling a next driver 84 in the chain upon<br>
completion of its own execution. As a result, the query<br>
engine 80 and dataset 82 are application independent and<br>
can be easily modified to support new functionality by<br>
adding data drivers 84 to the library and programming the<br>
intelligent dataset 82 as to their functionality.<br>
FIGURE 8 is a block diagram illustrating details of<br>
a multidimensional storage model 100 in accordance with<br>
one embodiment of the present invention. In this<br><br>
embodiment, the storage model 100 utilizes a non-sparse<br>
architecture to minimize the size of the model 100. In<br>
addition, the storage model 100 uses an open architecture<br>
to allow calculations to be dynamically performed after<br>
the model 100 is constructed.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 8, the multidimensional storage<br>
model 100 comprises a slot 360 for each dimension and a<br>
slot 362 for a calculated dimension. The dimensional<br>
slots 360 contain entries and associated data values<br>
extracted from a database while the calculated dimension<br>
slots 362 contain data calculated based on the extracted<br>
data.<br>
For the illustrated embodiment, each dimension slot<br>
360 includes an entry storage 370 and a dimension storage<br>
372. The entry storage 370 contains a set of non-sparse<br>
entries 374 for the corresponding dimension. Preferably,<br>
only non-sparse entries are included. The entries 374<br>
represent combinatric dimensional values and each<br>
identify an associated data value 376. In one<br>
embodiment, each entry 3 74 includes a pointer to the<br>
associated data value 376. Alternatively, the data<br>
values 376 can be stored along with the entries 374 in<br>
the entry storage 370. Use of the pointers and separate<br>
storage of the data value 376, however, improves<br>
efficiency and processing speed of the multidimensional<br>
storage model 100.<br>
The dimension storage 3 72 includes the data values<br>
376 associated with entries 374 in the entry storage 370.<br>
The data values 376 represent unique dimensional values<br>
for each dimension.<br><br>
A set of interdimensional links 380 is provided for<br>
each non-sparse entry 374. Each interdimensional link<br>
identifies an intersection between non-sparse entries 374<br>
in different dimensional slots 360. The set of<br>
interdimensional links 380 includes one or more<br>
interdimensional links. In one embodiment, the<br>
interdimensional links 380 are bi-directional to allow<br>
efficient traversal between the dimensional slots 360 in<br>
either direction from an entry point.<br>
The interdimensional links 380 collectively identify<br>
all intersections between non-sparse entries 374 in the<br>
dimensional slots 360. Accordingly, all intersections,<br>
including non stored empty intersections, can be<br>
determined from the non-sparse entries 374 and traversal<br>
of the interdimensional links 380. In particular, a null<br>
intersection between database entries in a first and a<br>
second dimension is determined by the lack of the<br>
database entries in the model or the lack of<br>
interdimensional links 380 connecting the entry 3 74 in<br>
the first dimension to the entry in the second dimension.<br>
Non-sparse intersections between entries 3 74 in a first<br>
and second dimension are determined by traversing the<br>
interdimensional links 380 from the specified entry in<br>
the first dimension to the specified entry in the second<br>
dimension and then obtaining the data value 376<br>
associated with the entry 374 in the second dimension.<br>
Data and information obtained by traversal of the<br>
interdimensional storage model 100 is output for further<br>
processing as described in more detail below.<br>
The calculated dimension 362 includes a set of<br>
calculated values 382. The calculated values 382 are<br>
values derived from predefined calculations requested by<br><br>
a user contemporaneously with the multidimensional<br>
storage model 100. Thus, while the multidimensional<br>
storage model 100 provides an open architecture to allow<br>
calculations after its creation, contemporaneous<br>
calculations requested by the user with the model are<br>
precalculated and stored to minimize processing after<br>
creation of the model 100 and to improve the speed of<br>
multidimensional analysis.<br>
FIGURE 9 is a block diagram illustrating exemplary<br>
data 400 and an exemplary multidimensional storage model<br>
402 for the exemplary data 400. Referring to FIGURE 9,<br>
the exemplary data 400 includes dimensions C1 and C2 and<br>
calculated dimension C3. Dimension C1 includes unique<br>
entry values A, B, and C while dimension C2 includes<br>
unique entry values D, E, F, G, and H. The calculated<br>
dimension C3 includes calculated data values 1, 2, 3, 4,<br>
5, and 6 corresponding to different predefined<br>
calculations.<br>
The exemplary storage model 402 includes dimensional<br>
slots 404 for dimensions C1 and C2 and calculated<br>
dimensional slot 406 for calculated dimension C3. In the<br>
C1 dimensional slot 404, the dimensional storage 410<br>
includes unique dimensional values A, B, and C... The<br>
entry storage 412 includes entries with which the data<br>
values are associated and pointers to the data values.<br>
Similarly, the C2 dimensional slot 404 includes unique<br>
data values D, E, F, G, and H in dimensional storage 414.<br>
Entry storage 416 includes entries associated with the<br>
data values and pointers to the data values.<br>
Interdimensional links 420 identify intersections between<br>
entries, and thus data, in the C1 and C2 dimensions. The<br>
calculated dimension 406 includes calculated data values<br><br>
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 associated with predefined<br>
intersections of data in the C1 and C2 dimensions.<br>
From the exemplary storage model 402, it can be<br>
determined, for example, that entry values A and D in the<br>
C1 and C2 dimensions intersect in that they are connected<br>
by interdimensional links 420. It can be further<br>
determined that entry values C and D do no intersect in<br>
that they are not connected by interdimensional links<br>
420. Entries are connected by interdimensional links if<br>
any one or a series of interdimensional links connect the<br>
entries.<br>
FIGURE 10 is a flow diagram illustrating a method<br>
for generating and using the multidimensional storage<br>
model 100 in accordance with one embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Referring to FIGURE 10, the method<br>
begins at step 440 in which the multidimensional storage<br>
model 100 is generated by the multidimensional model<br>
manager 44 in response to a query request and is based on<br>
results of the query request. The query request<br>
specifies the dimensions and data dimensions for the<br>
multidimensional storage model 100.<br>
In one embodiment, the multidimensional model<br>
manager 44 generates the multidimensional storage model<br>
100 by first fetching data records from the source. For<br>
each data record, the dimensional values and data values<br>
are then fetched. Thereafter, for each dimensional value<br>
of a data record the multidimensional model manager 44<br>
determines if the dimensional value is present in entry<br>
storage 370, in which case it may be used. If the<br>
dimensional value is not present in the entry storage<br>
370, an entry 374 is created for the dimensional value in<br>
entry storage 370 and the corresponding data value 376<br><br>
stored in dimension storage 3 72. In either case, the<br>
dimensions are next traversed from left to right to<br>
create interdimensional links 380 for the entries 374 in<br>
entry storage 370. Existing links are reused while links<br>
that are missing are created. In addition, for the<br>
right-most dimension, data values fetched for the record<br>
are added by the multidimensional model manager 44. It<br>
will be understood that the multidimensional storage<br>
model 100 may be otherwise suitably generated.<br>
After the multidimensional storage model 100 is<br>
generated, step 440 proceeds to step 442. At step 442,<br>
the multidimensional model manager 44 receives a view<br>
request for a subset of the specified dimensions and/or<br>
data dimensions. Next, at step 444, the multidimensional<br>
model manager 44 determines. traversals necessary to<br>
generate the view from the storage model 100 and a<br>
starting point for each traversal. The traversals are<br>
defined by the specified dimensions and the starting<br>
point on entry determined based on how the model 100 is<br>
organized.<br>
In one embodiment, the multidimensional model<br>
manager 44 retrieves a first and a next record from the<br>
multidimensional storage model. 100 using a bottom-up,<br>
right-to-left recursive movement. In this embodiment, to<br>
retrieve the first record, the multidimensional model<br>
manager 44 positions a first dimension selected for<br>
display to the first entry storage value. Next, all<br>
parent entries, which are those to the left of the first<br>
entry, are positioned to their first entry storage value.<br>
Child entries, which are those to the right of the<br>
selected dimension, are also positioned to their first<br>
entry storage value. For the first record, the<br><br>
multidimensional model manager 44 then retrieves values<br>
for dimensional entries at these positions. To retrieve<br>
the next record, the multidimensional manager 44 attempts<br>
to move the right-most child in the view. If the right-<br>
most child is movable, it is repositioned and the data<br>
values fetched at the current positions within the<br>
multidimensional storage model 100. If the right-most<br>
child is not movable, the multidimensional model manager<br>
44 attempts to move the parent of that child, which is<br>
the entry immediately to the left of the child. If the<br>
parent is movable, it is repositioned and the data values<br>
fetched at their current positions in the<br>
multidimensional storage model 100. If the parent cannot<br>
be moved, an attempt is made to move the parent of that<br>
parent, which is the entry immediately to the left of the<br>
first parent, and the process repeated until no parents<br>
remain. At this point, the end of the process is<br>
reached. It will be understood that the traversals and<br>
starting points within the multidimensional storage model<br>
100 may be otherwise suitably determined.<br>
Proceeding to step 446, the multidimensional model<br>
manager 44 traverses the multidimensional storage model<br>
100 from the entry point across connecting<br>
multidimensional links 380 to determine the existence<br>
and/or value at a specified intersection. At step 448,<br>
the multidimensional storage model 100 determines any<br>
value at the specified intersection. Next, at step 448,<br>
the multidimensional model manager 44 determines whether<br>
additional traversals exist for the model 100. If<br>
additional traversals exist, the Yes branch of decisional<br>
step 450 returns to step 446 and the remaining traversals<br>
are performed and intersectional values calculated until<br><br>
all traversals have been completed. The No branch of<br>
decisional step 450 then leads to step 452.<br>
At step 452, data and information output from the<br>
multidimensional storage model 100 is summarized and<br>
sorted. It will be understood that the multidimensional<br>
storage model 10 0 may be otherwise configured to presort<br>
and summarize data. However, by separating the traversal<br>
operation from the summarizing and sorting operations,<br>
processing efficiency is improved.<br>
Next, at step 454, information output from the<br>
multidimensional storage model 100 is graphically<br>
displayed to the user in a requested view by the viewers<br>
124 on the client 110. Proceeding to decisional step<br>
456, if additional views are requested, the Yes branch<br>
returns to step 442 in which the view request and<br>
specified dimensions are • received and the process<br>
repeated until all requested- views have been completed<br>
and displayed to the user. At this point, the No branch<br>
of decisional step 456 leads to the end of the process.<br>
In this way, the business intelligence portal 10 provides<br>
a multidimensional storage model 100 of reduced size and<br>
improved processing speeds that support efficient pivot<br>
and drill operations during data analysis. In. addition,<br>
a user can create new calculations to analyze data<br>
intersections that were not anticipated during the<br>
original definition of the model. This reduces time and<br>
resources needed to support pivot and drill operations.<br>
The additional views may include pivot views and data<br>
drilling for high, and low level analysis.<br><br>
FIGURE 11 is a screen diagram illustrating a display<br>
of related window 480 in accordance with one embodiment<br>
of the present invention. Referring to FIGURE 11, the<br>
display window 48 0 includes a menu bar 486 with a variety<br>
of pull down menus 488 disposed along a top edge of the<br>
display window 480. A tool bar 490 is disposed<br>
immediately below the menu bar 486.<br>
The display window 480 further includes a catalog<br>
window 492 and a portfolio window 494 adjacent the<br>
catalog window 492. The catalog window 492 displays a<br>
file hierarchy within the catalog 32. The portfolio<br>
window 494 displays the views linked by the action<br>
portfolio.<br>
Within the portfolio window 494, each of the views<br>
is separately displayed in a discrete view window 496.<br>
Storage of the views in discrete files linked by the<br>
portfolio and display of the related views within the<br>
portfolio window 494 allows related documents to be<br>
easily organized together and efficiently displayed to a<br>
user. In particular, the portfolio window 494 provides a<br>
common window with a single data interface (SDI). The<br>
discrete view windows 496 are displayed within the common<br>
window in a multiple data interface (MDI). It will be<br>
understood that other types of related components may be<br>
discretely stored and linked together for display through<br>
a compound file.<br>
FIGURE 12 is a screen diagram illustrating a display<br>
window 500 including view buttons for navigating between<br>
related views in a portfolio in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIGURE<br>
12, the display window 500 includes a menu bar 502 with a<br>
variety of pull down menus 504 disposed along a top edge<br><br>
of the display window 500. A tool bar 506 is disposed<br>
immediately below the menu bar 502. The display window<br>
500 includes a catalog window 508 and a portfolio window<br>
510 as previously described in connection with catalog<br>
window 492 and portfolio window 494.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, view windows 512 are<br>
maximized with the portfolio window 510 to provide<br>
optimized viewing. To allow navigation between the<br>
maximized windows, view buttons 514 are provided in<br>
response to maximization of a window 512 and displayed as<br>
tabs along a top edge of the portfolio window 510. The<br>
view buttons 514 are each operable to display an<br>
associated window 512 as the active window in response to<br>
activation. This allows users to quickly and easily<br>
navigate between the windows. As a result, users need to -<br>
constantly move, close, open, and resize windows to view<br>
related data stored in disparate files. The view buttons<br>
may be otherwise displayed or generated in response to<br>
other suitable events. For example, the view buttons may<br>
be generated any time a first window becomes at least<br>
substantially hidden from display by an overlying window.<br>
Thus, as soon as a user indicates that a window should be<br>
maximized, positioned, or displayed to cover a window, a<br>
view button 514 may be generated for the window to be<br>
covered. The view buttons 514 may be positioned<br>
independently of a corresponding window. Thus, they may<br>
be displayed adjacent to or remote from a corresponding<br>
window.<br><br>
Although the present invention has been described<br>
with several embodiments, various changes and<br>
modifications may be suggested to one skilled in the art.<br>
