				<td>Method For Producing Brushware<br>
The invention concerns a method for producing brushware by-<br>
mounting individual bristles or bristles combined into groups,<br>
in a predetermined arrangement, on a support thereby forming<br>
the desired bristle stock, wherein at least the envelope of<br>
part of the bristles of the bristle stock is processed to<br>
receive a structure.<br>
The invention also concerns a method for producing brushware by-<br>
mounting individual bristles or bristles combined into groups,<br>
in a predetermined arrangement, on a support thereby forming<br>
the desired bristle stock, wherein the free ends of at least<br>
part of the bristles are shortened.<br>
Brushware usually consists of a more or less regular bristle<br>
stock, wherein the bristles forming same have a smooth envelope<br>
surface with the free bristle ends being disposed in a flat,<br>
continuously, or discontinuously curved envelope surface. The<br>
bristle ends have the primary purpose of cleaning, grinding or<br>
polishing through mechanical action on the surface while the<br>
envelope of the bristles primarily has a wiping effect. A<br>
plurality of bristles must be provided within a bristle stock<br>
to substantially ensure effective and principally planar<br>
cleaning. Only the envelopes of the outer bristles of the<br>
bristle stock should be substantially effective during<br>
brushing, with the inward bristles merely supporting the<br>
bristles among themselves and serving the additional function<br>
of retaining application media or media required for the<br>
brushing effect in the narrow capillaries between the bristles.<br>
Many attempts have been made to also include the bristle<br>
envelope in the cleaning, polishing or grinding process<br>
effected during brushing by e.g. structuring the outer bristles<br>
of the bristle stock through mechanical material abrasion after<br>
manufacture of the brushware (US 5,678,275). This type of<br>
treatment does not provide satisfactory results. In particular,<br>
uniquely localized and geometrically predetermined structures<br>
cannot be produced, since the bristles deflect due to their<br>
flexibility which, in turn, differs in dependence on the<br>
position within the bristle stock and on the separation from<br>
the mounting point on the support.<br>
The applicant has also suggested (WO99/66111) structuring the<br>
extruded monofilaments used for producing bristles through<br>
laser treatment of the monofilament envelope. The monofilaments<br>
are subsequently combined into strands and the bristles of the<br>
strand are cut to the desired length. Since the monofilaments<br>
are axially displaced with respect to one another when<br>
combining into the strand, a locally defined structure cannot<br>
be generated on the combined bristles of the bristle stock. In<br>
addition, the somewhat rough, structured bristles cause<br>
problems during conventional sorting into groups, e.g. bundles.<br>
This leads to large fluctuations in the number of bristles in a<br>
bundle. This method also fails to facilitate arrangement of the<br>
structured bristles in the outer region of a bristle stock<br>
only, where they are most effective. The inwardly disposed,<br>
structured bristles are less effective or even ineffective<br>
relative thereto. Therefore, an unnecessary excessive amount of<br>
material is structured and possibly also weakened by the<br>
monofilament treatment. Moreover, the production process during<br>
manufacture of the monofilaments is slowed down by the laser<br>
treatment.<br>
It has been known for some time that a planar bristle surface<br>
(envelope surface of the free bristle ends) does not facilitate<br>
sufficient cleaning in many applications, in particular with<br>
tooth brushes. The bristles of such a tooth brush bristle stock<br>
cannot properly follow the irregular curvatures of the teeth.<br>
The interdental spaces also remain largely untreated. For this<br>
reason, tooth brushes having greatly differing bristle stock<br>
"topographies" have been proposed. These topographies are<br>
usually generated through subsequent mechanical abrasion of the<br>
plastic material on the bristle ends, e.g. through cutting of<br>
the bristles (US 2,227,126, DE 198 32 436, EP 0 736 270) and<br>
therefore involve a relatively demanding mechanical grinding or<br>
cutting treatment. Only limited variations are possible. Mutual<br>
axial displacement of the bristles before mounting on the<br>
support (EP 0 346 646) has led to better results and,<br>
theoretically, any "topography" can be produced. This method<br>
requires an additional treatment step before mounting the<br>
bristles on the support. The topographical bristles must then<br>
be held in position and subsequently connected to the bristle<br>
support.<br>
It is the underlying purpose of the present invention to<br>
propose a method for producing brushware which permits<br>
structuring of the bristle envelopes before or after mounting<br>
on the bristle support and in any reproducible fashion. The<br>
bristle ends should be shortened to form any desired,<br>
reproducible bristle end envelope surface.<br>
The first part of the inventive object is achieved in that, in<br>
the predetermined arrangement or on the mounted bristle stock,<br>
at least one part of the bristles is structured without contact<br>
using laser radiation.<br>
Conventionally (DE 198 29 943), a finished bristle stock has<br>
been marked using laser radiation to serve as an indication of<br>
wear. Structuring is not involved since the bristle material<br>
itself is not removed.<br>
Modern laser technology permits accurate localization of the<br>
action of the laser radiation and concentration of the effect<br>
on the smallest of surfaces, such as individual points or<br>
lines. It can moreover be adapted to the material to be treated<br>
and permits exact adjustment of the depth in dependence on the<br>
material. The inventive use of laser energy therefore permits<br>
generation of defined and regular structures of preferably<br>
geometrical arrangement on the envelope of the bristles of a<br>
bristle stock, wherein the mechanical effect of the structures<br>
can also be influenced through exact control of the depth of<br>
the laser radiation. Since the method is carried out in a<br>
contact-free fashion, reproducible structures can be generated<br>
irrespective of the flexibility of the bristles. This is, in<br>
particular, the case with plastic bristles even though the<br>
invention is not limited to this material. Laser technology<br>
also permits adjustment of the type and arrangement of the<br>
structures to the application at hand. The structures improve<br>
the reception capacity for cleaning or application media, which<br>
are delivered without complications due to the smooth surfaces<br>
of the structures and which can be easily rinsed out.<br>
These structures also increase the massaging effect of tooth<br>
and body brushes as well as the abrasive effect of the<br>
structured edges of technical brushes, whose bristles contain<br>
abrasive materials.<br>
The inventive method can be used for forming bristle stock<br>
"topographies" through contact-free cutting of the free ends of<br>
the bristles using laser radiation.<br>
This method in accordance with the invention permits generation<br>
of the finest of structures, e.g. punctiform or linear<br>
depressions in the surface of the bristle arrangement or of the<br>
bristle stock, with the consequence that the envelope surface<br>
has steps of any desired type to provide additional scraping or<br>
scratching effects during brushing.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the laser source is controlled to<br>
round the free ends of the bristles through thermal loading<br>
caused by the laser treatment. While structuring is produced<br>
substantially through evaporation or gasification of the<br>
plastic material by the introduced laser energy, it has<br>
surprisingly turned out that, when cutting the bristles at the<br>
free bristle end, the bristle end is also advantageously<br>
rounded, like a dome. The reason therefor may be that the<br>
molecules in the bristles, having a linear orientation due to<br>
the monofilament production, are thermally loaded at the<br>
location of action of the laser radiation thereby re-<br>
orientating the molecules into their disordered, tangled state.<br>
The laser source is also designed in dependence on the<br>
respective material, preferably a plastic material, such that<br>
the bristle envelopes are profiled through material removal in<br>
response to thermal decomposition of the plastic material.<br>
Evaporation and gasification processes also cause material<br>
removal. This has the advantage, compared to all mechanical<br>
treatment methods, that the structures do not fray. Fraying<br>
causes loss of material during use of the brushware, which can<br>
cause problems, in particular for hygiene brushes, especially<br>
tooth brushes. For the case of application brushes, such<br>
fraying can lead to inclusions of foreign matter resulting in<br>
irregularities in the application layer. During mechanical<br>
treatment, removed material residues will always remain on the<br>
bristles which require subsequent cleaning processes without<br>
guaranteeing 100% success. The inventive method also obviates<br>
the need for such cleaning.<br>
In accordance with a further embodiment of the inventive<br>
method, the bristle envelopes are structured through foaming of<br>
the plastic material. Practical experiments have shown that the<br>
plastic material bubbles in response to the laser treatment to<br>
form an uneven bristle envelope surface. This foaming can be<br>
controlled through fillers, laser guidance etc.<br>
Two or multiple component brushes are known which consist of a<br>
core and an envelope. They are used, in particular, for wear<br>
indication, wherein the core and envelope have different<br>
colors. The bristles, which initially have only one color, show<br>
a different color with increasing wear at the bristle end to<br>
indicate the degree of wear. One embodiment of the invention<br>
provides that, in brushware having such bristles, only the<br>
envelope is structured by the laser radiation. This permits<br>
structuring of the envelope up to the core, through local<br>
removal of envelope material.<br>
To prevent unfavorable changes in the properties defined by the<br>
bristle cross-section and the selected plastic material in<br>
consequence of subsequent structuring, the invention provides<br>
that the envelope structure of the bristles extends to a depth<br>
of not more than 10% of the bristle cross-section. The depth<br>
and local arrangement of the structures within the bristle<br>
stock can be selected such that the static properties of the<br>
individual bristle and of the entire bristle stock are<br>
maintained to the desired degree.<br>
During production of the "topographies", the free ends of the<br>
bristles can be shortened in a substantially linear pattern.<br>
This linear pattern can be adapted to the directions of motion<br>
which are normal for the respective brushware to obtain optimum<br>
effects for the "topography".<br>
The free ends of neighboring bristles can also be shortened,<br>
thereby forming a stepped envelope surface.<br>
The free ends of only individual groups of bristles can be<br>
shortened by the laser radiation. The free ends of the bristles<br>
in one individual bristle group can be shortened to thereby<br>
form a non-planar envelope surface, e.g. conify the ends of a<br>
bundle.<br>
As mentioned above, the inventive method can be carried out on<br>
the prepared bristle arrangement or on the mounted bristle<br>
stock. In this event, only the envelope of outwardly disposed<br>
bristles can be structured. Instead or additionally, inwardly<br>
disposed bristles can also be exposed through separation and<br>
lateral deflection of bristles (DE 198 32 436, EP 0 763 270) to<br>
permit structuring of their envelopes.<br>
Although laser radiation can be used for controlled structuring<br>
of the plurality of plastic materials which can be used for<br>
bristles, it may be advantageous to use bristles with fillers which absorb laser<br>
radiation, thereby providing easier and more precise control of the structuring .<br>
The ftliers may be provided only in certain cross-sectional regions of the bristles,<br>
e.g. close to the envelope, or, for bristles having a profiled cross-section, in the<br>
outward profiled regions. This leads to particularly intensive mechanical action<br>
during brushing, in particular, in connection with the inventive structuring in the<br>
region of polygonal edges of polygonal cross sections.<br>
Finally, the structuring produced during laser treatment can be visualized<br>
through simultaneous coloring of the plastic material. Instead of or additionally,<br>
the structure produced during the laser treatment can be visualized through<br>
fillers contained in the plastic material of the bristles, which change their color in<br>
response to the laser radiation.<br>

of the embodiments of Figs. 1 through 8;<br>
Figs. 22 through 24 each show a view of a structured individual<br>
bristle; and<br>
Fig. 25 shows perspective views of a round bristle.<br>
The head 2 of the tooth brush 1, which is shown in sections in<br>
the drawing, forms a support for bristles 3 which, in the<br>
embodiments of Figs. 1 through 12, are all mounted<br>
individually, standing on the support 2, such that the bristle<br>
stock 4 consists of a relatively dense bristle package defining<br>
intermediate, narrow capillaries. In the embodiment of Fig. 1,<br>
structures 5 in the shape of parallel lines have been formed<br>
via laser radiation through removal of material from the<br>
bristle envelope. The structuring according to Fig. 1 gives<br>
particularly good effects for the so-called red-white cleaning<br>
method.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 2, which also illustrates a bristle<br>
stock 4 of individually, standing bristles 3, structures 5 in<br>
the form of wavy lines are provided through laser radiation,<br>
which are narrower than those of Fig. 1.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 3, the structures 5 at the outer<br>
bristles of the bristle stock 4 are provided in the form of<br>
slanted hatching and in the embodiment of Fig. 4 in the form of<br>
cross-hatching. The embodiments of Figs. 2 through 4 are<br>
suitable for any tooth cleaning method.<br>
The embodiment of Fig. 5 shows structures 5 on the outer<br>
bristles in the form of circular, planar depressions, whereas<br>
Fig. 6 shows structures 5 of circular lines.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 7, the bristles 3 of the bristle<br>
stock 4 have differing lengths, i.e. they are longer in the<br>
region of the front end of the brush head 2 than in the<br>
remaining region of the bristle stock, thereby forming a<br>
"topography" with one step in the front region. In a similar<br>
fashion as in Fig. 1, structures 5 are provided in the envelope<br>
of the outer bristles in this front region only.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 8, the bristle stock 4 has a<br>
"topography", wherein the ends of a portion of the bristles 3<br>
lie in one plane, and the ends of the other portion of the<br>
bristles are subdivided into individual groups 6 and lie in a<br>
higher plane, relative to the bristle support 2. In this<br>
embodiment, only the protruding bristles of the group 6 have<br>
linear structures.<br>
Figs. 9 through 11 each show a top view of a tooth brush head 2<br>
with bristle stock 4, viewing onto the free ends of the<br>
bristles 3. The outer contour of the bristle stock 4<br>
approximately follows the contour of the tooth brush head 2. In<br>
the embodiment of Fig. 9, the bristles are shortened only in<br>
the region of the front end of the bristle head through laser<br>
radiation, i.e. along concentric lines 7 of a polygon. In the<br>
embodiment of Fig. 10, the bristles 3 are shortened in a<br>
regular cross-hatched pattern, while in the embodiment<br>
according to Fig. 11 they are shortened along the line 9.<br>
Fig. 12 shows a perspective view of a tooth brush head 2,<br>
wherein the envelope of the external bristles has a structure 5<br>
of parallel lines. The bristles are also shortened in the<br>
region of the front end of the head in a cross-hatched fashion.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 13, the bristle stock 4 consists of<br>
groups 9 of bristles formed as round bundles. The front region<br>
of the bristle head 2 has groups 10 and 11, wherein the free<br>
bristle ends have been cut to different lengths using laser<br>
radiation such that the free ends of the groups 10 and 11 have<br>
different conical taperings. It is also possible to structure<br>
the envelope of the bristles disposed on the conical surface.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 14, the bristle stock 1 again<br>
consists of groups 9 of bristles in the form of cylindrical<br>
bundles, while a group 12 of individually standing bristles is<br>
disposed in the front region of the bristle head. In this<br>
embodiment, only the bristles 3 of this group 12 have linear<br>
structures 5 which extend parallel to one another.<br>
Figs. 15 through 17 show a top view onto the bristle stock 4 of<br>
brushes having a rounded head which are used, in particular, in<br>
electrical tooth brushes. In accordance with Fig. 15, the<br>
bristles 3 are shortened along concentric rings 13, while in<br>
the embodiment in accordance with Fig. 16, the bristles 3 are<br>
shortened to produce a spiral topography. In the embodiment in<br>
accordance with Fig. 17, the bristles are cut in a co-radial 15<br>
fashion. The embodiments of Figs. 16 and 17 particularly<br>
enhance the action of the free bristle ends when the bristle<br>
head rotates about its central axis.<br>
Fig. 18 shows a tooth brush head 2 similar to that of Figs. 13<br>
and 14, whose bristle stock 4 comprises groups 9 of bristles<br>
formed as round bundles, and with a bristle group 12 disposed<br>
at the front end. The front bristle group 12 consists of<br>
individual bristle strips which are disposed like a star,<br>
wherein the individual strips have parallel structures 5<br>
disposed substantially perpendicular to the bristle axis.<br>
In the embodiments according to Figs. 19 through 21, the<br>
individual structures 5 produced on the envelope of the outer<br>
bristles of the bristle stock 4 by the laser radiation, are<br>
irregular, but have a regularly disposed statistical<br>
distribution across the entire side surface of the bristle<br>
stock.<br>
The envelope of individually standing bristles, in particular<br>
of those having a larger diameter, can be structured in the<br>
same fashion as described above in connection with an entire<br>
bristle stock or bristle groups of such a stock. In the<br>
embodiment of Fig. 22, the envelope of the bristle 3 has<br>
inclined structures 5 whereas the embodiment of Fig. 23 has a<br>
zig-zag-shaped line structure 5. The bristle 3 can be<br>
structured with cross-hatching as shown in Fig. 24.<br>
Fig. 25 shows a round brush having a cylindrical carrier 1<br>
which can be e.g. the head of a hair brush, a technical brush<br>
or the like. Ray-shaped, cylindrical bristle groups 16 are<br>
mounted on the support 1 whose free ends have parallel<br>
structures 5.<br>
