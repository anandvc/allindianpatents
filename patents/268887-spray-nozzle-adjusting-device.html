				<td>Spray-nozzle adjusting device<br>
The invention relates to a spray-nozzle adjusting device in a strand guide of a continuous casting plant for the production of metal strands of different strand width, the strand guide comprising strand guide rollers which are supported in a scaffold frame and which form a transport path for the metal strand, and at least two spray nozzles being positioned in this transport path between adjacent strand guide rollers in a plane lying perpendicularly to the strand conveying direction, which spray nozzles are connected in each case to an adjusting device for changing the distance between the spray nozzles and for changing the perpendicular distance of the spray nozzles from the surface of the transport path.<br>
In a continuous casting plant, the at least partially solidified strand leaving the continuous casting mold is subjected to intensive spray cooling in the following strand guide which is formed mostly by successive strand guide portions. The coolant, mostly atomized water or a water/air mixture, is sprayed by means of spray nozzles in a fan-shaped manner into a free space between strand guide rollers succeeding one another in the strand conveying direction. Since, in a continuous casting plant, conventionally, metal strands of different strand width are cast, it is necessary to position the spray nozzles such as to achieve a uniform action of coolant upon the strand surface in a plane lying perpendicularly to the strand transport direction. In the case of strands having slab cross sections, this cooling is in this case restricted predominantly to the wide side faces of the cast strand.<br>
In the case of slab cross sections, with an increasing slab width, two, if appropriate three spray nozzles are arranged next to one another, in order to ensure an approximately uniform action of coolant upon the wide side face of a<br>
slab and to ensure as uniform a cooling of the metal strand as possible. Uneven cooling leads to crack formations on the slab, especially in the surface and edge region.<br>
To ensure a uniform application of coolant, it is therefore already known to arrange adjusting devices for varying the distance<br>
between spray nozzles arranged in a plane perpendicular to the strand transport direction and the perpendicular distance of the spray nozzles from the surface of the metal strand. This is intended to avoid an undesirable overlapping of the spray fans of adjacent spray nozzles and an over spraying of the slab edges.<br>
DE 25 07 971 Al already discloses a nozzle adjusting device, in which a plurality of spray nozzles are articulated on a lever system, for example in the manner of a parallel link system. In the exemplary embodiment described, with three spray nozzles arranged in one plane, an adjustment of this lever system causes the formation of three spray fans which can be adjusted from one operating position to a further operating position for any selected slab width, with a constant overlap region and without an over spraying of the slab edges. For this purpose, an element of the lever mechanism is displaced into the desired direction by means of an adjusting spindle.<br>
DE 26 36 666 Bl likewise discloses a nozzle adjusting device which is formed by a plurality of coupled parallel link systems, each of these parallel link systems carrying a spray nozzle, and the overall system being adjustable by means of a nand wheel from one operating position into a further operating position according to the selected slab width.<br>
E'urther, similar nozzle adjusting devices for various strand formats are already known from DE 30 39 443 Al, DE 32 07 668 Al and EP 0 028 686 Al.<br>
The nozzle adjusting devices operate, within the strand guide, at a short distance from the hot metal strand in a region subjected to high thermal load and are additionally subjected to a high dirt load, and therefore the joint connections of these complex kinematic chains are susceptible to faults in terms of their functionality. In addition, these movable<br>
fittings in the strand guide elements or strand guide segments are located in regions where access is difficult, and therefore repair work is difficult to carry out.<br>
The object proposed in the invention, therefore, is to avoid the disadvantages described above and to propose a spray-nozzle adjusting device which is distinguished by particular maintenance friendliness and good accessibility.<br>
Proceeding from a spray-nozzle adjusting device of the type initially described, this object is achieved in that a spray nozzle holder is assigned to each spray nozzle arranged in a plane lying perpendicularly to the strand conveying direction, and the spray nozzle holder is fastened to an actuating piston of at least one adjusting device, while, during an axial adjusting movement of the actuating piston, an adjusting movement of the spray nozzles, which is parallel to this axial adjusting movement, takes place, and the adjusting device is fastened to the scaffold frame of the strand guide in a region remote from the transport path, preferably at the largely freely accessible outer regions of the strand guide. All the adjusting and control devices are consequently positioned in a region remote from thermal influence. An arrangement which is stable under the given operating conditions is ensured by means of a connection of the actuating piston and of the spray nozzle holder which allows no relative movement between these two components.<br>
In order, in the case of all possible strand widths, to ensure an optimal distribution of coolant over the strand width set in each case, it is expedient if the angle of inclination of the actuating piston of the adjusting device to the imaginary surface of the transport path in a plane lying perpendicularly to the strand conveying direction is coordinated with the opening angle of the coolant jet emerging from the spray nozzle. The opening angle of the coolant jet also lies in this plane. In this case, the opening angle of the coolant jet emerging from the spray nozzle and consequently the configuration of the spray nozzle are to be defined such that the spray pressure, dependent on the distance of the spray nozzle from the metal strand surface, of the coolant jet impinging onto the strand surface does not vary too greatly. The specific application of coolant and consequently the cooling power on the strand surface are influenced by the<br>
opening angle and the distance of the nozzle orifice from the strand surface.<br>
The coolant used is treated cooling water (water cooling) or cooling water atomized with an atomizing agent, preferably air (air mist cooling).<br>
The number of necessary adjusting devices along the strand guide is to be minimized. This can be achieved in that spray nozzles arranged one behind the other along the transport path, in a plurality of planes lying one behind the other in the strand conveying direction, are assigned to a spray nozzle nolder extending in the strand conveying direction and can be adjusted synchronously with said spray nozzle holder.<br>
To avoid oscillations on the spray nozzle holder and for the general stabilization of the latter, the spray nozzle holder is guided on the adjusting device by means of at least one guide element. Expediently, the longitudinal axis of the actuating piston of the adjusting device and the longitudinal axes of the at least one guide element are arranged in one plane, and the actuating piston of the adjusting device is preferably arranged between two guide elements.<br>
The adjusting device preferably comprises a hydraulically or pneumatically actuable pressure medium cylinder.<br>
The spray nozzle comprises, in addition to the actual nozzle body in which the atomization of the spraying agent and, at its outlet orifice, the formation of the spray fan take place, a coolant line and a coolant lead through, the coolant lead through being connected to the spray nozzle holder, and the coolant line being guided in a guide element displaceably in a plane lying perpendicular to the strand conveying direction, and the guide element being fastened in a strand guide roller carrying scaffold to the scaffold frame of this strand guide roller carrying scaffold. In the case of two-component cooling, the coolant line comprises a line for the cooling water and a line for the atomizing agent.<br>
To ensure easy mounting and demounting of the adjusting device and/or of the spray nozzle, the guide element for receiving the coolant line is designed as a guide fork having a guide slot open in a plane lying perpendicularly to the strand conveying direction. The guide element may be designed adjustably in order to allow an exact positioning of the spray nozzles between successive strand guide rollers.<br>
So that, even in the plant region with a curved strand guide roller carrying scaffold, a plurality of spray nozzles arranged one behind the other in the strand conveying direction can<br>
be fastened to a common spray nozzle holder, and, at the same time, in order to ensure an unequivocal position of the spray fan between the strand guide rollers, the coolant lead through is designed as a rotary lead through which allows a pivoting movement in a plane lying parallel to the strand conveying direction.<br>
To avoid natural oscillations of the long spray nozzles and oscillations which are caused by recoil forces of the coolant<br>
let<br>
zemerging from the nozzle orifices, the coolant line is reinforced by means of a supporting plate in a plane lying perpendicularly to the strand conveying direction.<br>
In the case of over-wide slabs, it is expedient to arrange more than two spray nozzles next to one another. Whesn at least three spray nozzles are arranged in a plane lying perpendicularly to the strand conveying direction, the spray nozzle holders of the outer spray nozzles are connected to a connecting linkage, and further spray nozzles arranged between these outer spray nozzles are suspended with their spray nozzle holders on this connecting linkage.<br>
In a constructively simple embodiment, when at least 3 spray nozzles are arranged in a plane lying perpendicularly to the strand conveying direction, the inner spray nozzles are fastened to an unadjustably fixed spray nozzle holder.<br>
To adapt the nozzle positions automatically to the current slab widths, each adjusting device is assigned regulating and control devices, in particular a displacement transducer and a preferably hydraulic actuating member for fixing the position of the actuating piston, which are themselves connected to the plant management system.<br>
Preferably, the adjusting device comprises, for positioning the spray nozzles, a hydraulic actuating member with switching valves which are activated via a three-position controller or via a pulse-width modulated controller.<br>
Further advantages and features of the present invention may be gathered from the following description of non-restrictive exemplary embodiments, reference being made to the accompanying figures in which:<br>

Figures 1 and 2 illustrate diagrammatically the arrangement of the spray-nozzle adjusting device according to the invention in the strand guide of a slab continuous casting plant. Fig. 2 illustrates, in a part longitudinal section through the continuous casting plant, the transitional region from a curved portion of the strand guide into a straight portion of the strand guide in the run-out region of a continuous casting plant, with the aid of which the essential components of the spray-nozzle adjusting device and its advantages in these two geometrically different positions become obvious.<br>
A metal strand 1 cast in a continuous casting mold, not illustrated, after emerging from the continuous casting mold,<br>
is supported in a strand guide 2 by strand guide rollers 3 on the mutually opposite wide side faces la, lb and is deflected oy the strand guide in the strand conveying direction R from an essentially vertical casting direction into a horizontal transport direction. Spray nozzles 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are arranged in each case between strand guide rollers 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e succeeding one another in the strand conveying direction, there being arranged in a plane perpendicular to the strand transport direction, for example in a sectional plane in the region of ~he spray nozzle 5, two spray nozzles 5a, 5b, by means of which fan-shaped coolant jets 9a, 9b are applied to a wide side face la of the metal strand 1 such that a largely<br>
uniform application of coolant takes place. If, for example, a metal strand 1' wider than the metal strand 1 is cast, an adaptation of the positions of the spray nozzles 5a, 5b takes place according to the positions illustrated by dashes by reference symbols 5a' and 5b' . Consequently, fan-shaped coolant jets 9a' and 9b' are automatically set, by means of which, once again, the entire strand width can be cooled uniformly. The coolant quantity required can be regulated to the then larger strand width, for example, by means of an increased spray pressure. The strand guide rollers 3, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e, which are arranged in the strand guide 2 in two rows, only one row of which is illustrated, and are supported in the scaffold frame 2a, form a transport path lc for the cast metal strand.<br>
Each spray nozzle 5a, 5b is connected to a spray nozzle holder<br>
10	which, in turn, is firmly connected to the actuating piston<br>
11	of an adjusting device 12 so as to allow no relative<br>
movement. In fig. 2, the adjusting device 12 together with the<br>
actuating piston 11 is indicated merely diagrammatically by a<br>
double arrow illustrating the common possibility of movement of<br>
the actuating piston and of the spray nozzle holder 10. The<br>
adjusting device 12 comprises a hydraulically or pneumatically<br>
actuable pressure medium cylinder 40. For example, in the event<br>
of a format change from a metal strand 1 with a first width to<br>
a metal strand 1' with a second, for example; larger width, the<br>
spray nozzle holder 10 is brought into a position corresponding<br>
to the spray nozzle holder 10' by the actuating piston 11 of<br>
the adjusting device 12 being retracted, with the result that<br>
the coolant jet optimal for this casting width is set. The<br>
adjusting device 12 is fastened to the frame structure of the<br>
strand guide 2 in a region which is as far as possible from the<br>
hot metal strand, hence is fastened to a carrying bracket 13 on<br>
that side of the strand guide frame structure which is remote<br>
from the hot metal strand 1.<br>
The spray nozzle holders 10, 10' extend essentially in the strand conveying direction over a longitudinal region which comprises a plurality of strand guide rollers 3a, 3b, 3c or 3c, 3d, 3e, ... arranged one behind the other. A plurality of spray nozzles 4, 5, 6 or 7, 8, ... arranged one behind the other in the strand conveying direction in this respective region are fastened to a common spray nozzle holder 10, 10' and can be adjusted in common during an adjusting movement exerted on the spray nozzle holder. For the situation, not illustrated in any more detail, customary in steel continuous casting plants, where the strand guide is constructed from a plurality of strand guide segments, all the spray nozzles which are arranged one behind the other in the strand conveying direction and are fastened to a spray nozzle holder extending over the longitudinal extent of the strand guide segment<br>
can be positioned in common by means of an adjusting movement of the spray nozzle holder. Consequently, the outlay in terms of pipe work for the spray cooling of each segment is appreciably simplified, and the number of adjusting devices necessary is minimized to at most two.<br>
In the case of particularly wide metal strands, especially with a strand width of more than 2.0 m, three adjusting devices for three spray nozzles arranged next to one another are necessary, in order to ensure a uniform application of coolant over the strand width.<br>
In the case of a straight strand guide portion, as is illustrated in the right half of the image in figure 2, the spray nozzles 7, 8 between adjacent strand guide rollers 3c, 3d, 3e are displaced in common in a parallel movement away from the strand surface or toward the latter, the central orientation of the spray nozzles between the strand guide rollers being maintained. In the case of an. arcuate strand guide portion, as is illustrated in the left half of the image m figure 2, the central position between the strand guide rollers would be lost to a differing extent due to the parallel displacement of the spray nozzles 4, 5. These conditions are illustrated in figure 3. Owing to the parallel displacement, the coolant jet would suddenly impinge directly onto one of the strand guide rollers. So that the spray nozzles can be set centrally with respect to the gap between adjacent strand guide rollers in any desired position of the spray nozzle holder which is dependent on the casting width, each spray nozzle 4, 5, 6 is fastened in a pivotally movable manner to the spray nozzle holder 10, within the arcuate strand guide, by means of a coolant lead through 15. At the same time, the long coolant line 16, which extends between the coolant lead through 15 and the spray nozzle head 17 transversely through the frame structure of the strand guide, is guided in a guide element 18 which is fastened to the frame structure of the strand guide.<br>
The guide element 18 is designed as a guide fork 19 with a guide slot 19a open in a plane lying perpendicularly to the strand conveying direction. The coolant line 16 is fixed slideably in position in this guide slot 19a and makes it possible to orient the spray nozzle head 17 and consequently the coolant jet 9 into the center between adjacent strand guide rollers 3a, 3b, .... By the coolant lead through 15 or the spray nozzle 4, 5, ... being fastened to the spray nozzle holder 10 in a pivotally movable manner, a bending of the spray nozzle in the region of the coolant line is avoided. The guide elements 18 are fastened to the frame structure, not illustrated in any more detail, of the strand guide 2.<br>
To avoid oscillating movements of the spray nozzles, supporting plates 20 are arranged in the region of bent coolant lines 16 and reinforce the flexural or oscillatory stability of the coolant lines in a plane lying perpendicularly to the strand conveying direction (fig. 1). In the case of two-component cooling (air mist cooling), the coolant line comprises a line for the actual coolant and a line for the atomizing agent. The mixing of the two components and the formation of the coolant jet 9 take place in the spray nozzle head 17.<br>
A possible first embodiment of the structural configuration of the spray nozzle holder 10 and of a fastening of the spray nozzle 4 to the spray nozzle holder is illustrated in figure 4. The spray nozzle holder 10 comprises two profile pipes 22, 23 for the delivery, transfer and distributing of a coolant, such as treated cooling water, and of an atomizing medium, such as preferably air, to any number of spray nozzles 4. The profile pipes 22, 23 are connected to the oscillation-stable spray nozzle holder by means of connecting straps 24, 25. The profile pipes are assigned laterally mounting battens 26, 27 which in the region of passage orifices 28, 29 have mounting faces 30 for the leak tight fastening of the coolant lead through 15 of the spray nozzle. The passage orifices 28, 29 are matched to media lines in the spray nozzle, which are indicated by their center lines. The passage orifices 28, 29 in the mounting battens 26, 27 are designed, where appropriate, as long holes 32, so as not to give rise to any narrowing in cross section even during a pivoting movement of the spray nozzle. The spray nozzle is fastened to the spray nozzle holder 10 by means of a connecting screw 31. To ensure a leak tight connection of the components, while at the same time ensuring a pivoting possibility of the spray nozzle, a spring element may be assigned to the connecting screw and sealing elements may be assigned to the passage orifices.<br>
A second preferred embodiment of the structural configuration of the spray nozzle holder 10 and of a fastening of the spray nozzle 4 to the spray nozzle holder is illustrated in figure 5. The spray nozzle holder 10 comprises, once again, two profile pipes 22, 23, firmly connected at a distance from one another, tor the supply of coolant and atomizing agent to the spray nozzles. Welded onto and into the profile pipes according to the number of connected spray nozzles are sliding bushes 33 for the rotationally movable reception of rotary lead throughs 34, through which the coolant and the atomizing agent are conducted r.hrough passage orifices 28, 29 into the coolant lead through 15 of the spray nozzle 4. The spray nozzle 4 is firmly screwed with its coolant lead through 15<br>
to the mounting face 30 of the rotary lead through 34 and, together with the rotary lead through, is supported in the sliding bushes 33 of the spray nozzle holder 10 pivotally and to a limited extent axially in the direction of the pivot axis 36 by means of an actuating ring 37. The passage orifices 28, 29 are sealed off in the transitional region of the sliding bush to the rotary lead through by means of a plurality of sealing rings 38.<br>
The basic set-up of the adjusting device 12 fastened to a carrying bracket 13 of the frame structure of the strand guide 2 is illustrated in more detail in figure 6. The adjusting device 12 comprises a hydraulically or pneumatically actuable pressure medium cylinder 40 with an actuating piston 11 which is connected rigidly to the spray nozzle holder 10. The spray nozzle holder carries two guide elements 41 which are formed by guide rods and which are arranged on both sides of the actuating piston, parallel to the latter, in a common plane ■with the actuating piston 11. The guide elements 41 pass through the basic frame 42 of the adjusting device and are slideably displaceable in this in the axial direction of the guide elements and, when the pressure medium cylinder 4 0 is actuated, execute a movement synchronous with the actuating piston 11. The guide elements 41 serve for stabilizing the spray nozzle holder 10. Connected in each case to the spray nozzle holder are elastic supply lines 43, 44 for coolant and for atomizing agent for the supply of media to six spray nozzles 4, 5, 6, 7, .... This ensures an appreciable simplification of the coolant pipe work in the structurally confined strand guide.<br>
Fig. 7 shows the arrangement of three spray nozzles 5a, 5b, 5c between adjacent strand guide rollers in a plane lying perpendicularly to the strand conveying direction. While the outer spray nozzles 5a, 5b cooling the marginal regions of a<br>
slab are arranged so as to be adaptable to different strand widths in the way already described with reference to fig. 1, the inner spray nozzle 5c cooling the central region of the slab has an invariable position. It is arranged on a fixedly mounted spray nozzle holder 10. However, it is also possible that the spray nozzle holder of this centrally arranged spray nozzle is connected to the actuating piston of an adjusting device 12, illustrated by dashes, and that all 3 spray nozzles are adapted to different strand widths by means of adjusting movements coordinating with one another.<br>
Each adjusting device 12 is assigned regulating and control devices 45 which are connected to the plant management system 46 and which comprise at least one displacement transducer and one preferably hydraulic actuating member for fixing the position of the spray nozzles<br>
(fig. 1). In the plant management system, basic settings of the continuous casting plant are carried out, which are predetermined, for example by the stipulation of a casting format and the steel quality and which predefine the position of the spray nozzles in the strand guide. The regulating and control devices lock synchronously onto these stipulated values for positioning the spray nozzles.<br><br><br><br>
