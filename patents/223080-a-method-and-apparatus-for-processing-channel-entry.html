				<td>CHANNEL ENTRY FOR SELECTION OF A CHANNEL<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
Present invention generally relates to a system and method of video<br>
selection processing in, for example, a video apparatus or the like, capable of<br>
receiving a digital and/or analog television signal; and more particularly to a<br>
system and method for processing entry and/or selection a channel.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In analog-only TV environment, tuning directly to an analog (e.g., NTSC or<br>
PAL) television channel was relatively easy using a remote control device. A<br>
user would typically use a number keypad on a remote control to press the digits<br>
corresponding to the desired channel. For channels with only one digit (e.g.,<br>
channel 6), the user would typically have to enter a leading zero before the<br>
channel number in order to fill up the buffer of two digits. For example, the user<br>
would enter "0" then "6". For channels of two digits, the user would enter the<br>
two digits, after which the TV would immediately tune to the desired channel<br>
after receiving two digits. For some remote controls, a user would press an<br>
"enter" key after the channel digit entry, so that the video apparatus would<br>
immediately turn to the entered channel, without delay.<br>
When Cable TV was introduced, three-digit channels became common and<br>
various methods were used to facilitate three-digit channel entry. These<br>
methods include, for example, a "100" key on the remote, or a "long-1" method<br>
(i.e., holding the "1" digit key for a longer-than-usual period would allow for a<br>
three-digit entry), etc.<br>
In the past, tuning to channels in a satellite system, such as a DIRECTTVÂ®<br>
Integrated Receiver-Decoder (IRD), made by, for example, Hughes Electronics or<br>
Thomson Consumer Electronics, was straightforward, too. DIRECTTV channels<br>
have used three digits in length (e.g., range from 100 to 999). Therefore, all a<br>
user has to do is to enter a three-digit channel number and the DIRECTTV system<br>
will immediately tune to the channel after the third and final digit is entered. In<br>
the future, however, DIRECTTV may have from 1 to 9,999 channels, or include<br>
subchannels.<br>
The introduction of digital television further complicates channel entry and<br>
selection. One example of a digital television is high definition television (HDTV)<br>
which complies with Digital Television Standard for HDTV Transmission standard<br>
of, for example, April 12, 1995, prepared by the United States Advanced<br>
Television Systems Committee (ATSC) or other ATSC standards. A digital<br>
television broadcaster under such standards may choose to either broadcast one<br>
high definition digital signal (e.g., a main or major channel) or the broadcaster<br>
may choose to split the digital television signal into multiple standard definition<br>
"subchannels" or "minor channels" if he so desires (which is called<br>
"multicasting").<br>
A digital ATSC channel which is broadcasting a single high definition<br>
channel (i.e., is not multicasting multiple standard definition channels) will always<br>
have a subchannel number of "1". A digital ATSC channel which is broadcasting<br>
multiple standard definition channels (i.e., is multicasting) can have multiple<br>
subchannels ranging from "1" to "999". Exemplary illustrations of how major<br>
and minor channel numbers are transmitted, processed and displayed is<br>
disclosed, for example, in US. Application Serial No. 09/057,646, entitled "A<br>
System and Method for Displaying Major and Minor Channel Numbers", and also<br>
in a Continuation Application of that application, U.S. Application Serial No.<br>
09/218,518, filed 12/22/98, both assigned to the same assignee of the present<br>
invention. Therefore, digital channels may have major and minor channel<br>
numbers, unlike analog channel, which do not have a subchannel. Likewise,<br>
satellite broadcast, such as DIRECTTV, currently does not have subchannel<br>
associated with its transmission.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors recognize that it is desirable to be able to provide a<br>
channel entry and selection system and method which is easy and intuitive to<br>
users in an environment of having one or more broadcast formats. The present<br>
inventors recognize that a user-friendly solution must be provided to handle the<br>
differing lengths of direct digit entry of channels for different signal sources (e.g.,<br>
analog, digital, satellite), as well digital subchannels.<br>
The present invention, therefore, provides a system and method of channel<br>
selection in a receiving apparatus, which is capable of receiving a program, which<br>
may Qcoupy a high definition channel or only a subpart (e.g., a subchannel) of<br>
the high definition channel. Also, the present invention may also be used to<br>
select an analog television program and/or satellite broadcasting programs.<br>
Therefore, in one form, the present invention is a method for processing<br>
channel entry, comprising the steps of:<br>
displaying a first field;<br>
displaying a second field;<br>
determining if there is an entry to the first field;<br>
determining if there is an entry to the second field; and<br>
if there is an entry only to the first but not the second field based on the<br>
previous determining steps, then tuning to a first available channel and with a<br>
major channel number corresponding to the entry in the first field.<br>
In another form, the present invention is a method of processing channel<br>
entry, comprising the steps of:<br>
determining whether the apparatus is in a first or a second receiving mode;<br>
displaying a first channel entry format if it is determined that the apparatus<br>
in the first receiving mode, in response to the determining step;<br>
displaying a second channel entry format if it is determined that the<br>
apparatus in the second receiving mode, in response to the determining step; and<br>
wherein the first channel entry format comprises a first and a second<br>
information portions and the second channel entry format comprises a third<br>
information portion.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
With reference to Fig. 1, there is shown a block diagram of a system,<br>
generally designated 10, which may utilize the present invention. It should be<br>
initially appreciated that the system 10 depicted in Fig. 1 is only exemplary<br>
and/or representational of the many systems that may utilize the principles of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The system 10 includes a television apparatus that may or may not include<br>
a monitor or other similar display device (collectively "television apparatus")<br>
generally designated 12. The television apparatus 12 is adapted through<br>
appropriate circuitry, software, and/or other components to decode and process<br>
digitally modulated analog audio and video television signals or transmissions<br>
("digital television signals") from a Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) system 18 as<br>
received via a link or line 20. Such signals may be digitally modulated using the<br>
QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) format. The television apparatus 12 is<br>
also adapted through appropriate circuitry, software, and/or other components to<br>
decode and process digital television signals from terrestrial Digital Television<br>
(DTV) antenna 14 as received via a link or line 16, such as ATSC DTV. Such<br>
signals may be digitally modulated using VSB (Vestigal SideBand).<br>
The television apparatus 12 is also adapted through appropriate circuitry,<br>
software, and/or other components, to process analog audio and video television<br>
signals ("analog television signals") from a terrestrial analog antenna 22 as<br>
received via a link or line 24, as well as analog television signals from a CATV<br>
system 26 via a link or line 28. Such processing typically includes digitizing the<br>
/ video and/or audio signals through appropriate circuitry, software, and/or other<br>
components. Digital television signals from the CATV system 26 are also<br>
decoded and processed as indicated above. It should be appreciated that the<br>
television apparatus 12 is adapted to receive and process analog and/or digital<br>
television signals from sources other than that shown.<br>
As an example of the above, the television apparatus 12 may be a model<br>
DTC 100 or DM1, from Thomson Consumer Electronics, Inc. of Indianapolis,<br>
Indiana. In any form, the television apparatus 12 typically includes appropriate<br>
circuitry, software, and other components to support/provide a display, an<br>
integral control system, a user-interface and on-screen display (OSD)<br>
functionality. It should be appreciated that the television apparatus 12 may take<br>
other forms and have additional capabilities and/or functionality other than those<br>
shown and/or discussed through appropriate circuitry, software, and/or other<br>
components.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, there is shown a block diagram of at least some of the<br>
various components of the DTC 100 television apparatus 12. The DTC 100<br>
television apparatus 12 is adapted through appropriate circuitry, software, and/or<br>
other components, to receive and process digital television signals and analog<br>
television signals. The various blocks and interconnections depicted in Fig. 2 are<br>
exemplary of a television capable utilizing analog and digital television signals.<br>
Thus, variations in the interconnections and components may vary.<br>
The television apparatus 12 includes a direct broadcast satellite tuner/IF<br>
converter 30 that is adapted to receive a digital television signal (audio, video,<br>
and VBI/other) via line 20, allows tuning to the various channels of the digital<br>
television signal, converts the digital television signal into an Intermediate<br>
Frequency OF), and sends the IF digital television signal (here shown as QPSK<br>
modulated) to a DSS link 32. The DSS link 32 demodulates the IF digital<br>
television signal and forwards the resulting digital television signal to a link<br>
multiplexer (MUX) 34. The link MUX 34 selectively sends the digital television<br>
signal to an ARM transport 36. The ARM transport 36 extracts a digital audio<br>
signal that is sent to an MPEG/AC-3 audio decoder 38. The audio decoder 38<br>
decodes the digital audio signal, and sends the decoded digital audio signal to a<br>
digital to analog (D/A) converter 44. The D/A converter 44 sends the resulting<br>
analog audio signal to an audio processor 46 which send the process analog<br>
audio signal to audio amps 48 that are connected to audio speakers.<br>
The ARM transport 36 also extracts a digital video signal that is sent to<br>
the decoder 50. The decoder 50 provides necessary MPEG circuitry and/or<br>
software to decode the digital video signal. The decoded digital video signal is<br>
6ent to a digital to analog (D/A) converter and filter 52 to provide an analog<br>
television signal for further processing before being forwarded to the display.<br>
The television apparatus 12 also includes a High Definition (HD)/NTSC<br>
tuner/IF converter and splitter 40 that receives an HD digital television signal<br>
(audio, video, and VBI/other) from the terrestrial digital antenna 14 via line 16,<br>
allows tuning to the various channels of the HD digital television signal, converts<br>
the HD digital television signal into an Intermediate Frequency (IF), and sends the<br>
HD IF digital television signal (here shown as VSB modulated) to an HDTV link<br>
42. The HDTV link 42 demodulates the HO IF digital television signal and<br>
forwards the resulting digital signal to a link multiplexer (MUX) 34., The link<br>
MUX 34 selectively sends the digital signal to an ARM transport 36. The ARM<br>
transport 36 extracts a digital audio signal that is sent to an MPEG/AC-3 audio<br>
decoder 38. The audio decoder 38 decodes the digital audio signal, and sends<br>
the decoded digital audio signal to a digital to analog (D/A) converter 44. The<br>
D/A converter 44 sends the resulting analog audio signal to an audio processor<br>
46 which send the process analog audio signal to audio amps 48 that are<br>
connected to audio speakers.<br>
The ARM transport 36 also extracts a digital video signal that is sent to<br>
the decoder 50. The decoder 50 provides necessary MPEG circuitry and/or<br>
software to decode the digital video signal. The decoded digital video signal is<br>
sent to a digital to analog (D/A) converter and filter 52 to provide an analog<br>
television signal for further processing before being forwarded to the display.<br>
The High Definition (HD)/NTSC tuner/IF converter and splitter 40 also<br>
receives digital television signals from the digital cable source 26 via line 28 and<br>
processes them in the same manner as for the terrestrial digital television signals.<br>
Additionally, the High Definition (HD)/NTSC tuner/IF converter and splitter 40<br>
provides PIP (Picture-ln-Picture) capabilities.<br>
The High Definition (HD)/NTSC tuner/IF converter and splitter 40 also<br>
receives analog (NTSC) television signals from the terrestrial analog antenna 22<br>
via line 24 and from the analog cable source 26 via line 28. The analog<br>
television signal is tuned by the tuner to a channel of the television signal and<br>
provides an IF analog television signal to an NTSC video switcher 56. The NTSC<br>
video switcher 56 provides the analog television signal to an initial comb<br>
filter/PIP and Chroma decoder 58 after which the analog television signal is sent<br>
to an NTSC YUV A/D converter 66 before being sent to the decoder 50.<br>
The television signal decoding integrated circuit (IC) or chip 50 performs<br>
combing, picture-in-picture (PIP), chroma decoding and digitizing, MPEG video<br>
decoding, NTSC and PAL video upconversion, OSD, and other functions. Such a<br>
decoding IC may be an HMP8117 Video Decoder from Intersil Corporation of<br>
Palm Bay, Florida (formally Harris Semiconductor of Harris Corporation of<br>
Melbourne Florida), the Harris Semiconductor Data Sheet of January 1999, File<br>
Number 4643, of which is specifically incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Hence, the exemplary television as described above, is able to receive and<br>
process not only analog (for example, NTSC), digital (for example, ATSC) or<br>
terrestrial (local), but also direct satellite broadcast. As mentioned previously,<br>
the present inventors recognize that it would be desirable to provide a user-<br>
friendly solution for handling channel-entry for each of the signal sources. The<br>
present inventors therefore provide in one embodiment of the solution which<br>
shares in common that after entering the channel number, the user is to press a<br>
"OK" or "enter" key on the remote control to confirm the entry (if the user does<br>
not press OK or the like key, the unit will clear the entry and will not tune).<br>
Confirming the channel entry with the explicit action of pressing, for example, an<br>
"OK" key on the remote may not be something previously required in, for<br>
example, TVs from Thomson Consumer Electronics.<br>
Fig. 3 is an exemplary illustration of a user control device for use with the<br>
invention. As shown in Fig. 3, remote control 30 may have a toggle switch 31<br>
for selecting the reception for television programs (either analog or digital) or<br>
satellite programs. Remote 30 also has digit keys 32-1 to 32-10 for entering<br>
channel number, and an "OK" key 33 for confirming channel entry. The function<br>
of these and other keys will be further explained below.<br>
HANDLING CHANNEL ENTRY IN TV MODE:<br>
As mentioned previously, a user may select either to receive broadcast or<br>
cable television programs (e.g., "TV") or satellite programs via, for example, a<br>
toggle switch 31 shown in Fig. 3. When in TV mode (for example, receiving<br>
NTSC and/or ATSC channels), if a user presses a digit key 32-1 to 32-10 on a<br>
remote control 30, he or she is presented with two side-by-side digit-entry fields,<br>
or information portions, 41 and 42, in for example, a channel banner 40, as<br>
shown in Fig. 4. The left field 41 is for main channel entry and the right field 42<br>
is for subchannel entry.<br>
An exemplary embodiment may be that each field is capable of holding<br>
three digits apiece, since the maximum length of a TV main channel (whether<br>
analog or digital) is three digits and the maximum length of a digital subchannel is<br>
three digits according to current standards, for example. Of course, although the<br>
exemplary embodiment shown in Fig. 4, has the representation that the two<br>
entry fields or information portions are separated by blank spaces, other<br>
representations are possible. For example, another embodiment may be that the<br>
two information portions or fields are separated by a delimiter such as a dash<br>
line, a dot or a decimal symbol.<br>
According to the principles of the present invention, to tune directly to an<br>
analog NTSC channel, the user needs only to enter a main channel number and<br>
press the OK key 33 on, for example, remote 30 to confirm the channel entry.<br>
This is because NTSC channels are not capable of having subchannels; hence the<br>
user and the unit can ignore the subchannel field.<br>
To tune directly to a digital ATSC channel which is broadcasting a single<br>
high definition channel (i.e., is not multicasting multiple standard definition<br>
channels) a user needs to enter a main channel number and press the OK key 33<br>
on the remote to confirm the entry.<br>
To tune directly to a specific subchannel of a digital ATSC channel which<br>
is broadcasting multiple standard definition channels (i.e., is multicasting<br>
subchannels), a user needs to enter a main channel number in the main field 41<br>
first, as shown in step 602 of Fig. 6. The user then presses, for example, a right<br>
arrow key 34 on remote 30 to move to subchannel field 42, as shown in step<br>
606 of Fig. 6. In another embodiment, a delimiter key represented by, for<br>
example, a dash, dot or period may be used to move the cursor or,the like to the<br>
subchannel field.<br>
In another embodiment, if three digits are entered by the user in the main<br>
information portion 41, the cursor or focus will be moved automatically to the<br>
subchannel field 42.<br>
The user would then enter the digits for the desired subchannel, as in step<br>
607, and then press the OK key 33 on remote 30, as in step 608, to confirm the<br>
channel and subchannel entry. By pressing the right arrow key 34, the user is<br>
indicating a readiness to enter the subchannel number. Once the highlight is on<br>
the subchannel field 42, if the user presses the left arrow key, the highlight<br>
moves back to the main-channel entry field 41 and any entry in either field is<br>
cleared.<br>
According to another principle of the invention, If a user only enters a main<br>
channel number and no subchannel number (for example, "8, OK") in the TV<br>
mode, then transparent and invisible to the user, the unit will automatically enter<br>
a "0" (zero) digit into the subchannel field 42 so that the unit will automatically<br>
start searching for a channel with the "0" subchannel number, as shown in step<br>
604 of Fig. 6. A "0" subchannel in this case simply denotes an analog channel.<br>
Analog channels do not technically have a subchannel and since valid<br>
subchannels only range from 1-999.<br>
If the unit finds the analog channel (channel 8 or 8-0, which is equivalent),<br>
it will tune to it. If the unit does not find "8" or "8-0", the unit will then search<br>
for all subchannels of that main channel, starting with 1 (e.g., a digital main<br>
channel) and going to 999 (e.g., 8-1, 8-2, 8-3, 8-4...8-8-998, 8-999, etc.) until<br>
it finds a channel having a first available subchannel number for that main<br>
channel, as shown in step 605. Therefore, even though a digital ATSC channel<br>
which is broadcasting a single high definition channel (e.g. a main or major<br>
channel) will always have a subchannel of "1", the user does not need to know<br>
this or need to enter a "1" in the subchannel field since in starting its search of<br>
subchannels from "0", the unit will find the first available subchannel. In another<br>
embodiment, the search may start with the highest subchannel or just start<br>
searching all digital channels and skipping the analog channel.<br>
In addition, if a user enters a valid main channel number but then enters a<br>
subchannel that is invalid for that main channel number (i.e., no subchannel<br>
exists for that main channel), the unit will tune to the first available subchannel<br>
available for that main channel number as shown in steps 609-610, 604 and<br>
605. This first available subchannel may be the lowest, highest or the nearest<br>
valid subchannel depending on user preference. Therefore, one aspect of the<br>
present invention is the ability of the present invention to find valid subchannels<br>
or the main analog (i.e., subchanel = "0") or digital (i.e., subchannel = "1")<br>
channel, without the user knowing the types of channels being used for a<br>
particular program or needing to explicitly enter the subchannels.<br>
The above entry method is also compatible with channel number display<br>
scheme in some electronic program guides (EPGs), where digital channels are<br>
displayed with main channel numbers to the left of a "dash" character, and sub-<br>
channel numbers to the right of the "dash character" (e.g., 25-1, 25-2, 25-3, 26-<br>
3, 55-99, etc.).<br>
HANDLING CHANNEL ENTRY IN SATELLITE MODE:<br>
When a video apparatus such as unit 12 is in a satellite receiving mode, if<br>
a user presses a digit key on the remote control, he is presented with only one<br>
channel-entry field 51, as shown in Fig. 5, and described in steps 620 and 625<br>
of Fig. 6. This is because DIRECTTV satellite channels do not currently have<br>
subchannels. In the satellite mode, channel-entry field 51 is capable of accepting<br>
channels of either three or four digits in length, ranging from 100 to 9999. In<br>
one embodiment of the invention, if the user enters less than three digits and<br>
presses OK, the text string "???" is flashed in the channel-entry field 51 to<br>
indicate an invalid entry, as shown in steps 640 and 645 of Fig. 6. The user<br>
may then try another channel entry. In another embodiment where a valid<br>
satellite channel may range from 1-9999, no such error message will be<br>
generated. The system will simply attempt to tune to the entered channel.<br>
Therefore, present invention provides at least a quick and efficient way for<br>
the user to indicate exactly what channel and subchannel he desires. It also<br>
relieves the user from having to remember what type of channel (e.g., digital or<br>
analog) or what a channel's valid subchannels are. In addition, although an OK<br>
or similar function key may be used after entering digits to confirm channel entry,<br>
it has at least the advantages of: 1) the user does not need to wait a certain<br>
amount of time for the unit to accept the channel entry, 2) the user does not<br>
need to enter "leading zeroes" before a channel number [e.g., instead of entering<br>
"0, 0, 8" to get channel 8, the user only has to enter "8, OK" to get to channel<br>
8], 3) because the user can clear an incorrect subchannel or channel entry when<br>
entering a digital channel, if the user starts a channel-entry incorrectly, he can<br>
edit the channel before pressing OK. However, one skilled in the art can readily<br>
recognize that other implementations one possibility which may not require a<br>
user to press OK or other similar confirmation key. For example, the user may<br>
have to enter leading zeroes or a timer may be used to determine end of user<br>
entry, as described above.<br>
While this invention has been described as having a preferred design<br>
and/or configuration, the present invention can be further modified within the<br>
spirit and scope of this disclosure. This application is therefore intended to cover<br>
any variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention using its general principles.<br>
Further, this application is intended to cover such departures from the present<br>
disclosure as come within known or customary practice in the art to which this<br>
invention pertains and which fall within the limits of the appended claims.<br>
WE CLAIM;<br>
1. A method of processing channel entry, comprising the steps<br>
of:<br>
determining whether the apparatus is in a first or a second<br>
receiving mode;<br>
displaying a first channel entry format if it is determined<br>
that the apparatus in the first receiving mode, in response to<br>
the determining step;<br>
displaying a second channel entry format if it is determined<br>
that the apparatus in the second receiving mode, in response to<br>
the determining step; and<br>
wherein the first channel entry format comprises a first and<br>
a second information portions and the second channel entry format<br>
comprises a third information portion.<br>
2. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the first<br>
information portion comprises a major channel number.<br>
3. The method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the second<br>
information portion comprises a minor channel number.<br>
4. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the third<br>
information portion comprises a satellite channel number.<br>
5. The method cas claimed in claim 1, wherein at least one of<br>
the first, second and third information portions comprises<br>
numeric digits.<br>
6. The method as claimed in claim 1, comprising the step of<br>
tuning to a channel having a major channel and minor channel<br>
numbers corresponding to the first and second information<br>
portions respectively.<br>
7. The method as claimed in claim 1, comprising the step of<br>
tuning to a channel having a channel number corresponding to the<br>
third information portion.<br>
8. Apparatus for processing channel entry, comprising:<br>
means (50) for displaying a first field and a second field;<br>
characterized by comprising:<br>
means (36) for determining if there is an entry to the first<br>
field and the second field; and<br>
if the determining means determines that if there is an<br>
entry only to the first but not the second field based on the<br>
previous determining steps, then causing tuning means (40) to<br>
bore a first available channel with a major channel number<br>
corresponding to the entry in the first field.<br>
A method and apparatus for processing channel entry is<br>
presented. In one embodiment, the receiving mode of an apparatus<br>
is first determined. A first channel entry format is then<br>
displayed, if it is determined that the apparatus in the first<br>
receiving mode. A second channel entry format is displayed,<br>
instead, if it is determined that the apparatus in the second<br>
receiving mode. Furthermore, the first channel entry format<br>
comprises a first and a second information portions and the<br>
second channel entry format comprises a third information<br>
portion.</td>
