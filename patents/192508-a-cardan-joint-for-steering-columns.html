				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The  present  application  for  a  patent  of   invention,   as indicated  in  the  title,   comprises  a   "Cardan  joint  for  steering columns",   whose  novel  constructional,   shape  and  design features  fulfil  the  purpose  for  which  it  has  been  specifically designed,   with  maximum  safety  and  efficiency.<br>
The  proposed  invention  is  in  the  mechanical  sector,   more particularly  in  the  motor  vehicle  sector,   with  special application  to  steering  columns  where  motion  cannot  be transmitted  via  a  longitudinal  shaft   in  one  piece,   but  as  a result  of  the  mechanical  characteristics  of  modern  motor vehicles,   where  maximum  space  is  provided  for  the  occupants, it   is  necessary  among  other  objects  that  transmission  of motion,   e.g.   steering  and  the  like,   must  change  direction  so that  both  the  driver's  position  and  the  steering  casing  are coupled  relative  to  the  engine,   in  a  place  which  is  usually disposed  in  the  front  part  of  the  vehicle.     The  Cardan  joint can  also  be  applied  to  other  kinds  of  vehicles,   whenever  the transmitted  motion  must  follow  various  directions  until  it arrives  at  the  desired  point,   starting  from  a  point  at  the other  end  of  the  shaft  as  required  by  the  user.<br>
Known  technical  solutions,   with  the  aforementioned  objects regarding  safety  and  space,   start  from  the  steering  shaft,   in that  one  end  of  the  shaft,   which  we  have  called  the  male  part, is  inserted  into  the  interior  of  the  other  end  of  the  shaft  of the   female  part,   optionally  with  interposed  anti-vibration means   such  as  resilient  joints  or  the  like,   preventing relative  motion  between  the  two  parts,   via  a  bolt  which secures   the   two  provided  they  are   formed  with  holes   for inserting  the  bolt.<br>
The  bolt  also  compensates  torsional  force  between  the  ends  of the  divided  shaft,   and  also  prevents  axial  motion  between  the aforementioned  ends,   being  optionally  actuatable  in  dependence on  its  greater  or  lesser  resistance,   as  a  safety  element  in the  event   of  a  collision.<br>
Another  technical  aspect  which  has  also  to  be  taken  into account   is   the  ease  of  assembly  and  dismantling  of  the  divided steering  shaft,   which  cannot  adversely  affect  the  reliability and  safety,   since  the  Cardan  joint,   before  suffering  a collapse,   is  capable  of  withstanding  axial  forces  without  some components  disengaging  from  the  others,   i.e.   the  inner  male part  disengaging  from  the   female  part  which  surrounds  it,   the most   frequent  solution  nowadays.<br>
Other  objects  must  also  be  fulfilled,   e.g.   the  transmission shaft  with  its  Cardan  joint  must  not  convey  or  amplify,   acting as  a  conducting  support  of,   vibrations  generated  by  components or  devices  disposed  at  one  end  of  the  shaft  and  transfer  them to  the  user  of  the  vehicle,   and  consequently  the  transmission shafts  must   incorporate  anti-vibration  elements  capable  of absorbing  a  number  of  vibrations  and  movements  which  affect the  shaft,   thus  avoiding  noise,   vibration  and  shaking  of  the user,   and  also  other  components  with  which  the  shaft  is  in contact,   resulting  in  a  manifold  annoyance  of  the  occupants inside  the  vehicle  passenger  compartment.<br>
The  advantage  of  the  proposed  novel  Cardan  joint  is  basically the  elimination  of  the  bolt  and  providing  the  male  and  female ends  with  means  for  preventing  axial  motion  and  means  for coupling  the  parts  so  as  to  facilitate  assembly  of  the  shaft under  any  conditions,   i.e.   both  at  the  factory  and  when  the shaft   is  repaired.<br>
The  means  provided  for  preventing  axial  motion  basically consist   in  a  spatial  design  of  the  outer  surface  of  the  male part   and  of   the  inner  surface  of  the   female  part,   the  former being  provided  with  some  projections  at  one  end,   with  an appreciably  warped  configuration  substantially  similar  to  the female  part,   so  that  the  male  part  can  be  force-fitted  into the   interior  of   the   female  part   and  cannot  come  out  unless   the force  reaches  a  level  which  is  abnormal  under  the  usual operating  conditions.     All  the  above   is  supplemented  by  action<br>
of the previously-mentioned projections, formed by flanges which are doubled towards the interior, preventing the male part from projecting in front of the interior of the female part.<br>
The coupling means are obtained via a change in the cross-section of the male part corresponding to a change in the section of the female part which facilitates insertion of the former into the interior of the latter in a single position, i.e. the correct position.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a cardan joint for steering columns comprising a tubular element, one end of which is partially introduced into the * interior of an incorporated yoke, the ends or wings of which are formed with circular recesses for coupling the universal joint, the resilient joint and bearings for articulating it to the yoke, characterised in that an absorber is inserted between the tubular element and the body of the yoke so as to prevent vibration, the absorber being of injected rubber and partially covering longitudinally the entire lateral surface of tubular element and the body, changes of cross-section being disposed in the longitudinal direction of tubular element and the body and on its side surface as means for coupling the end of tubular element in the interior of the body in a single position and for compensating axial forces.<br>
Other  details  and  features  of  the  patent  of   invention  will  be clear  from  the  following  description  with  reference  to  the drawings  accompanying  this  specification,   which diagrammatically  show  preferred  details.     These  details  are given  by  way  of  example  with  reference  to  a  possible embodiment,   but  are  not  limited  to  the  details  set  out. Accordingly  the  description  should  be  considered  as  an illustration  and  without  limitation  of  any  kind.<br>
Fig.   1  is  a  longitudinal  section  in  elevation  of  a  Cardan joint  with  the  device;<br>
Fig.   2   is  a  section  via  two-two  in  Fig.   1;<br>
Fig.   3   is  a  section  via  three-three  in  Fig.   1;<br>
Fig.   4   is  a  section  via  four-four  in  Fig.   1  and<br>
Fig  5   is  a  longitudinal   section  6-6   in  Fig.   1.<br>
We  shall  now  list   the  various  components  numbered  in  the drawings  accompanying  the  present  description:   Cardan  joint 11,   tubular  element   12,   cylindrical  part  12a,   rectangular section  12b,   yoke  body  13,   flat  bases  13a,   curved  sides  13b, shock-absorber   14,   incorporated  yoke   15,   wings   15a  of   the  yoke<br><br>
whereas  the  sides  have  a  substantially  circumferential curvature   13b,   the  absorber  14  being  inserted  between  the cylindrical  part   12a  of  the  tubular  element  12  and  the  bases 13a  and  sides  13b.<br>
In  Fig.   4,   which  is  a  view  or  section  via  four-four  in  Fig.   1, we  see  that  at  this  point  the  body  13a  of  the  yoke  15  has  the same  shape  whereas  the  tubular  element   12   in  the  interior  of 13  has  a  rectangular  cross-section  12b  secured  at  its  ends  in projections  22  at  the  end  of  the  intermediate  piece  12  and permitting  relative  motion  of  13  on  14  under  normal  conditions and  avoiding  undesired  relative  motion  of  the  two  components. Accordingly  at  the  ends  of  13  and  14   there  is  a  constriction or  curve  or  curved  zone  21  which  serves  as  a  mechanical  catch between  the  element  13  and  12  when  necessary,   without vibration  via  12  reaching  19  since  the  absorber  14  is  between 13   and  12,   as  can  be  seen  in  Figs.   3  and  4.<br>
The  changes  in  cross-section  of  12  and  13   in  the  direction  of its  longitudinal  axis  as  shown  in  Figs.   4  and  5  are  designed so  that,   starting  from  a  given  axial   force,   a  mechanical  catch is  provided  between  12  and  13  and,   under  these  special conditions,   reliable  transmission  of  rotation  is  guaranteed. A  specially  important  case  is  when,   owing  to  damage  of  14,   a discontinuity  could  occur  in  the  material  and  12  could  rotate relative  to  13.<br>
The  special  shape  of  the  curved  zone  21  in  co-operation  with the  projections  22   in  the  form  of  flanges  which  are  doubled  in the  front  of  one  end  of  the  element   12  ensures  axial  retention both  towards  the  exterior   (dismantling)   of  12  with  respect  to 13   and  towards   the   interior   (collapse),   the  energy  in  this case  being  absorbed  with  additional  effect.<br>
As  shown  by  the  drawings  and  our  explanation  of  them,   the patent  application  as  described  in  the  present  specification provides  a  simple  and  effective  construction  which  can  be<br>
applied  with  great  ease,   undoubtedly  constituting  a  novel industrial  result.<br>
Since  the  present  patent  has  been  sufficiently  described  in conjunction  with  the  accompanying  drawings,   it  can  be understood  that  any  modifications  in  detail  which  are considered  appropriate  may  be  introduced  into  the  same, provided  the  proposed  variations  do  not  substantially  alter the  patent,   which  is  summarised  in  the  following  CLAIMS.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
