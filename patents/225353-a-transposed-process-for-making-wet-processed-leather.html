				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates a transposed process for making wet processed leather. In the process, the post tanning wet operations are done prior to tanning stage itself to make leather in eco-friendly manner in substantially shorter duration. It is envisaged to have enormous potential application in leather industry for making leathers with comparable softness and grain smoothness, whereby the pollution load would be significantly less compared to that of the conventional leather processing. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ARTS<br>
Conventional leather processing involves four important operations, viz., pre-tanning, tanning, post tanning and finishing. It includes a combination of single and multi-step processes that employs as well as expels various biological, organic and inorganic materials as described by Germann (Science and Technology for Leather into the Next Millennium, Tata McGraw-Hill Publishing Company Ltd., New Delhi, p. 283, 1999). Conventional method of leather processing involves 14-15 steps comprising soaking, liming, reliming, deliming, bating, pickling, chrome tanning, basification, rechroming, basification, neutralization, retanning, dyeing, fatliquoring and fixing. Liming and reliming processes employs lime and sodium sulfide and purifies the skin matrix by the removal of hair, flesh and other unwanted materials to produce pelt. Deliming process employs quaternary ammonium salts for neutralizing the alkalinity. Bating process purifies the skin matrix further using pancreatic enzymes. Pickling process prepares the skin for subsequent tanning. Tanned skin matrix further retanned to gain substance, fatliquored to attain required softness and dyed to preferred shades. This conventional technique discharges enormous amount of pollutants. This accounts for nearly 98% of the total pollution from a tannery as analyzed by Aloy et al (Tannery and Pollution, Centre Technique Du Cuir, Lyon, France, 1976). This includes biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total dissolved solids (TDS), sulfides, chlorides, sulfates, chromium, etc. This is primarily due to the fact that the conventional leather processing employs 'do-undo' process schemes such as swell-de-swell (liming-deliming); pickle-depickle (pickling-basification), rechroming-basification (acidification-basification) and neutralization-fixing (basification-acidification) as described by Bienkewicz (Physical Chemistry of<br><br>
Leather Making, Krieger Publishing, Malabar, FL, 1983). In other words, conventional methods employed in leather processing subject the skin/hide to wide variations in pH. Such pH changes demand the use of acids and alkalis, which leads to the generation of salts. This results in a net increase in COD, TDS, chlorides, sulfates and other minerals in tannery wastewaters as reported by Thanikaivelan et al (Journal of the Society of Leather Technologists and Chemists, 84, 276, 2000). Conventional chrome tanning generally involves pickling, tanning using basic chromium sulfate (BCS) followed by basification processes. Spent pickle liquor has high dissolved solid content and a considerable amount of chemical oxygen demand, since pickling involves the use of 8-10% sodium chloride salt along with sulfuric acid as reported by Aloy et al (Tannery and Pollution, Centre Technique Du Cuir, Lyon, France, 1976). The use of non-swelling acids in pickling has been reported by Herfeld and Schubert (Das Leder, 26, 117, 1975) in order to reduce total dissolved solids. Several better chrome management methods based on high exhaust chrome tanning as reported by Chandrasekaran (Leather Science, 34, 91, 1987), pickle-less tanning as given by Venba et al (Poster presented at 30th Leather Research and Industry Get-together, Chennai, 1995) chrome recovery and reuse as reported by Covington et al (Journal of the Society of Leather Technologists and Chemists, 67, 5, 1983) and closed pickle-tan loop system as described by Rao et al (Science and technology for leather into the next millennium, Proceedings of the XXV International Union for Leather Technologists and Chemists Societies congress, p. 295, 1999) have been developed. Conventional method of post-tanning process involves 7-8 major steps comprising of rechroming, basification, neutralization, washing, retanning, dyeing, fatliquoring and fixing. Post tanning operation employs a pH range of 4.0-7.0 and a variety of chemicals. The post-tanning processes contribute to TDS, COD and heavy metal pollution as analysed by Simoncini and Sammarco (Proceedings of the XXIII International Union for Leather Technologists and Chemists Societies congress, Germany, 1995). Post tanning chemicals in general contribute to COD in large measure and this can be mitigated by the use of optimized quantities of high performing auxiliaries, which would lead to less discharge of bio-treatable residues. Selection of retanning and fatliquoring agents is based on their biodegradability and uptake behavior. However, these improvements are specific to a unit operation. Implementation of all the advanced technologies and eco-friendly chemicals involves<br>
financial input and machinery requirements as well. This calls for the development of integrated leather processing technology and revamping the process sequence. Very few attempts have been made to revamp the whole leather processing steps. Thanikaivelan et al (Journal of the Society of Leather Technologists and Chemists 84, 276, 2000; 85, 106, 2001) have attempted to make leather in a narrow pH range from 4.0 - 8.0. Thanikaivelan et al (Journal of the American Leather Chemists Association 98,173, 2003) have developed biochemical based three step tanning process in the pH range of 4.0 - 8.0. Three-step tanning process involves dehairing at pH 8.0 without employing lime, sodium hydroxide based fibre opening and pickle less chrome tanning at pH 8.0. Saravanabhavan et al (Green Chemistry 5, 2003, 707) have successfully developed a three step tanning method, which involves dehairing without employing lime and sodium sulfide, enzyme based fiber opening and chrome tanning at pH 8.0. However, no attempt has been made to swap the leather processing steps. The steps of the above-mentioned references are primarily up to prime tanning. These three step processes have to be followed by a conventional post tanning process involving 7-8 major steps comprising of rechroming, basification, neutralization, washing, retanning, dyeing, fatliquoring and fixing. The present invention is better than the conventional method as shown by the flowchart in the Figure 1. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>

The objective of the present invention is to provide a novel transposed process for making leather, which precludes the drawbacks stated above. The present invention provides a tanning process that does not require pickling and basification steps. Further, the a post tanning process does not require acid washing, rechroming, neutralization, washing and fixing. Thus the leather obtained provides leathers matching the properties of leathers from conventional leather processing steps. This a transposed process that leads to significant reduction in chemical oxygen demand, total solids load and other pollution loads. The inventive step of the present invention lies in treating untanned pelts with syntans, fatliquors and dyes, which are conventionally considered as post tanning wet processing chemicals, thereby providing an eco-friendly option for leather processing. Syntans are synthetic tanning agents mostly based on organic chemicals, which are used to fill the leather. Luganil FBO, Sandopel Brown BSI, Dermapel blue IDBN and Sellafast orange-CGL are the dyes used for this study. The present invented process reduces the steps in the conventional process and makes the process into more compact by reversing the process sequence. This compact process avoids some of the processing steps and hence usage of chemicals.

EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1 (Disclosed in US Patent Application No. 10/618,997)<br>
534 gms of anthracene and 326 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid were taken in a 2 litre<br>
round bottom flask fitted with a stirrer. The contents of the flask were heated to 140°C<br>
for 90 minutes, with continuous stirring. 1 ml of the mass was taken in a beaker and 3<br>
ml water was added with shaking. It was observed to form a clear solution without<br>
free naphthalene smell, confirming the completion of sulfonation. The sulfonated<br>
mass was transferred to a reactor fitted with a thermometer, stirrer and a dropping<br>
funnel. The mass was stirred continuously for a period of 10 min. while maintaining<br>
the temperature at 80°C. A mixture of 5.4 gms oxalic acid, 4.14 gms salicylic acid and<br>
10 gms phthalic acid dissolved in 50 ml water was added to the above sulfonated<br>
mass and stirring was continued at 80°C. 1.5 gms of poly methacrylic acid was added<br>
to the sulphonic acid mixture and the mixture was heated to 80°C for 1 hour. A small<br>
portion of the reaction mixture was taken in a beaker and 2 ml water was added to the mass. The pH of the solution in the beaker was adjusted to 3 and a clear solution was obtained indicating the completion of the reaction. About 540 ml of water was added to the mass and transferred to a bucket after cooling the reaction mass to room temperature. The pH of the mass was raised to 3 by adding a solution of 220 gms of sodium hydroxide in 500 ml water, followed by the addition of an aqueous solution of 200 gms of sodium carbonate in 400 ml water. The slurry was aerated for 45 minutes conventionally and filtered using a cloth of pore size 5-10μ. The filtrate was spray dried at 260°C and the white powder was stored in a plastic container. The prepared syntan was added to the delimed sheepskins at an offer of 1.0% along with 5% BCS at a float of 20%. The drum was run for 1 hr and 80% water was added. Running was continued for another 1 hr and the penetration was assessed by checking uniform blue color along the cut section. The pH of the solution and the cut section was found to be 4.4. The bath was drained and the wet blue leathers were piled. Next day the leathers were post tanned using a conventional garment leather processing recipe. The chromium exhaustion of the spent tan liquor was found to be 95%. The fullness of the crust leathers was found to be superior to that of conventional chrome tanned leathers. Example 2<br>
Five bated goatskin pelts having fleshed pelt weight of 4.6 kgs were taken in a small experimental tanning drum. Cross section pH of the bated pelts was found to be 8.0. The bated pelts were washed with 9200 ml water for 10 minutes and drained. A combination of syntans, 23 gms of Basyntan DI (phenolic condensed product from Badische Anilin- &amp; Soda-Fabrik AG (BASF)), 23 gms of Vernatan OS (phenolic condensed product from Colour-Chem Limited, India), 46 gms of Basyntan FB6 (urea melamine based product from BASF) and 46 gms of Relugan RE (co-polymer based product from BASF) along with 6900 ml water was added simultaneously to the drum. The drum was run for 1 hr. To this, 4.6 gms of Luganil FBO (acid dye from BASF) was added. The drum was run for 30 minutes. To this, an emulsion of the combination of the fatliquors, 46 gms of Vernol liquor PN (natural oil based product from Colour-Chem Ltd.), 46 gms of Vernol liquor ASN (synthetic fatliquor from Colour-Chem Ltd.) and 46 gms of Balmol SX-20 (synthetic fatliquor from Balmar Lawrie &amp; Co. Ltd.) in 460 ml of hot water at 50°C was added. The drum was run for 1.5 hrs. A mixture of 46 gms polymeric syntan developed by Kanthimathi et al (from<br>
above Example 1 disclosed US Patent Application No. 10/618,997) and 230 gms of BCS (Golden Chemicals, Mumbai, India) was added. Drum was run for 3 hrs. The pH of the cross-section of the leather was found to be 4.5. The leathers were washed with 9200 ml of water for 10 minutes. The resulting wet processed leathers were taken out from the drum and piled.<br>
Example 3 (As disclosed in Indian Patent Application No. Del/770/2000) 105 gms of sodium meta silicate (Na2SiO3.5H2O) was stirred with 303 gms of sodium dichromate in a flask fitted with a stirrer. 550 ml of water was added to the above mass with continuous stirring. 188 ml of 98% sulphuric acid was added slowly to the above reaction mixture. 41 gms of molasses was added to 41 ml of water taken in a beaker and the mixture was added drop by drop by a dropping funnel to the above mass over a period of 20 minutes with continuous stirring. The temperature of the resulting mixture was noted to be 95°C. A mixture of 40 gms of phthalic acid and 55 gms of sodium tartrate was added to this reaction mixture over a period of 10 minutes. 50 gms of molasses was added to 50 ml of water taken in a beaker and the mixture was added to the above mass over a period of 30 minutes. A mixture of 43 gms of phthalic acid and 60 gms of sodium tartrate was added to the above mass over a period of 10 minutes. The temperature of the reaction mixture was noted to be 105°C. The stirring was continued for another 2 hrs after the complete addition of the organic ligands. A 10% solution of the above mass was subjected to diphenyl carbazide test whereby no chromium (VI) could be detected. The reaction mixture thus formed was aged for 12 hrs. The pH of the 1:1 aqueous solution of the above mixture was then checked and was found to be 2.7. This mixture was then filtered through a cloth and the filtrate was spray dried at a temperature of 260°C with contact time of 3 sec. The resulting powder was stored in a plastic container.This product was used for tanning pickled goat skins at an offer of 1.0% metal oxide on pelt weight and the resultant leathers were found to have a shrinkage temperature of 109°C, exhibiting an exhaustion of 91 and 90% for silica and chromium respectively. The tanned leathers were subsequently post tanned to garments using conventional procedure. The resultant leathers were found to be more soft, supple, stretch and smooth with strength characteristics that are comparable to that of conventional chrome tanned leathers.<br>
