INTEGRATED CRACKING AND METATHESIS PROCESS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the thermal cracking and disproportionation<br>
(metathesis) of hydrocarbons in an integrated method. More particularly, it relates to<br>
the thermal cracking of ethane to form, in part, ethylene, and the disproportionation<br>
of 2-butene in the presence of ethylene to form propylene.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Thermal cracking of hydrocarbons is a petrochemical process that is widely<br>
used to produce olefins such as ethylene, propylene, butenes, butadiene, and<br>
aromatics such as benzene, toluene, and xylenes. In an olefin production plant, a<br>
hydrocarbonaceous feedstock such as ethane, naphtha, gas oil, or other fractions of<br>
whole crude oil is mixed with steam which serves as a diluent to keep the<br>
hydrocarbon molecules separated. This mixture, after preheating, is subjected to<br>
severe hydrocarbon thermal cracking at elevated temperatures (1,450 to 1,550<br>
degrees Fahrenheit or F.) in a pyrolysis furnace (steam cracker or cracker).<br>
The cracked product effluent of the pyrolysis furnace (furnace) contains hot,<br>
gaseous hydrocarbons of great variety (from 1 to 35 carbon atoms per molecule, or<br>
C1 to C35, inclusive). This product contains aliphatics, alicyclics, aromatics,<br>
saturates, and unsaturates, and molecular hydrogen (hydrogen).<br>
This furnace product is then subjected to further processing to produce, as<br>
products of the olefin plant, various, separate and Individual product streams such as<br>
hydrogen, ethylene, propylene, fuel oil, and pyrolysis gasoline. After the separation<br>
of these individual streams, the remaining cracked product contains essentially C4<br>
hydrocarbons and heavier. This remainder is fed to a debutanizer wherein a crude<br>
C4 stream is separated as overhead while a C5 and heavier stream is removed as a<br>
bottoms product.<br>
Such a C4 stream can contain varying amounts of h-butane, isobutane, 1-<br>
butene, 2-butenes (both cis and trans isomers), isobutylene, acetylenes, and<br>
diolefins such as butadiene (both cis and trans isomers).<br><br>
Separately from the cracking process aforesaid, crude C4 streams have<br>
heretofore been subjected to selective hydrogenation of diolefins to convert them to<br>
the corresponding monooiefins with simultaneous isomerization of alpha olefins to<br>
internal olefins followed by etherification of the isoolefins, and finally metathesis of<br>
internal olefins with ethylene to produce propylene, U.S. Patent Number 5,898,091.<br>
Also separately from the cracking process aforesaid, ethylene has been<br>
dimerized followed by a metathesis operation to form polymer grade propylene.<br>
it is advantageous for a number of reasons which will be discussed<br>
hereinafter in detail, to have a single, integrated process which employs cracking,<br>
dimerization, and metathesis therein, particularly when directed to the formation of<br>
ethylene and propylene products.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with this invention a single, integrated process is provided<br>
which cracks a hydrocarbon such as an ethane containing feed to form at least one<br>
product olefin, metathesizes internal olefins to form additional product olefin, and<br>
internally generates additional feed for the metathesis operation. This method has<br>
the flexibility to produce an ethylene product, or a propylene product, or both, all from<br>
ethane.	<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a flow diagram of a conventional hydrocarbon cracking plant that<br>
produces polymer grade propylene.<br>
Figure 2 is a flow diagram of a conventional ethylene dimerization plant that<br>
employs a metathesis unit to produce polymer grade propylene.<br>
Figure 3 is a flow diagram that demonstrates one embodiment within this<br>
invention that produces chemical grade propylene.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 shows a typical cracking pJant wherein a hydrocarbonaceous feed 1<br>
is introduced into a thermal cracking furnace 2. It should be noted that there are<br>
many other cracking plant processing configurations than that shown in Figure 1.<br>
This invention is applicable to all such other configurations, figure 1 being just a<br><br>
single example of an applicable configuration. In furnace 2, a plurality of differing<br>
hydrocarbon compounds are formed as aforesaid to produce a cracked product 3.<br>
Hot, gaseous effluent 3 invariably Includes, among many other compounds,<br>
ethylene, propylene, and butenes, both alpha (1-butene) and internal (2-butenes).<br>
Product 3 is subjected to separate oil and water quenches and other fractionation,<br>
collectively unit 4, to liquefy heavier compounds (C5 and heavier) therein to form<br>
liquid streams such as fuel oil stream 5 and automotive gasoline grade (pyrolysis<br>
gasoline) stream 6, which streams are removed from the overall cracking process for<br>
other use elsewhere. The gaseous product 7 of fractionation operation 4 is<br>
transferred to a compression zone 8 wherein it undergoes several stages of<br>
compression. The compressed product 9 then undergoes a process 10, such as<br>
caustic washing, to remove acid gases therefrom, including hydrogen sulfide and<br>
carbon dioxide 11. The product 12 of zone 10 passes to a separation zone 13 which<br>
is a combination of cryogenic cooling and fractional distillation, and from which is<br>
separated a high purity molecular hydrogen stream 14 and. a separate methane<br>
stream 15, both of which are removed as products of the overall cracking plant.<br>
The remainder of effluent 3 is transferred by way of line 16 to fractional<br>
distillation zone 17 wherein ethane and ethylene are separated and recovered in line<br>
18, with the remainder of stream 16 being recovered as bottoms 24.<br>
Stream 18 is subjected to selective hydrogenation step 19 to convert<br>
acetylenics and diolefins to their corresponding monoolefins, after which it is passed<br>
by way of line 20 to another fractional distillation zone 21 wherein ethylene is<br>
separated from ethane, and each are recovered as separate products 22 and 23,<br>
respectively, of the cracking plant.<br>
Stream 24 is also subjected to additional fractional distillation in zone 25 to<br>
separate propane and propylene therefrom as an overhead stream 27, and leave a<br>
C4 containing stream 26 as a bottoms product.<br>
Stream 27 is subjected to selective acetyienic and diolefin hydrogenation to<br>
convert same to their corresponding monoolefins in zone 28, and the resulting<br>
hydrotreated stream 29 passed to a fractional distillation zone 30 wherein propane is<br>
separated from propylene to form separate streams 31 and 32, both of which are<br>
removed as products of the overall cracking process.<br><br>
Propylene product 32 is a very pure polymer grade material. As such, product<br>
32 has a propylene content that is substantially greater than that of chemical grade<br>
propylene. Chemical grade propylene has numerous uses of value. In fact, most<br>
processes involving propylene and outside the polymer industry, e.g., the production<br>
of propionitrile, propylene oxide, and the like, requires only chemical grade<br>
propylene. The use of polymer grade propylene in such processes is neither<br>
practical nor necessary. The separation of propane from propylene in tower 30 is<br>
quite difficult due to the close proximity of their respective boiling points.<br>
Accordingly, distillation column 30 is very large in size, and is expensive as to both<br>
its construction and operating costs. If a process produced chemical grade<br>
propylene it would have enhanced flexibility because the chemical grade material<br>
could, if desired, be transformed into polymer grade material, or it could be used,<br>
without more, in the numerous commercial processes that call, for chemical grade<br>
propylene. This invention provides that flexibility.<br>
Stream 26 is subjected to a butene recovery fractional distillation process in<br>
zone 33 wherein a C4 containing stream 34 is separated as a product of the overall<br>
cracking process. The C5 and heavier materials in stream 26 are separated as<br>
stream 35 for various uses such as addition to the automotive gasoline pool.<br>
Thus, the cracking plant of Figure 1 produces, among other materials, ethane,<br>
ethylene, polymer grade propylene, and propane, with essentially no flexibility for<br>
doing otherwise.<br>
Figure 2 shows a particularly useful commercial process known as "Product<br>
Flexibility" as employed in its dimer mode. In this Figure, ethylene feed 40 and catalyst 41 are fed into ethylene dimerization reactor 42 which is maintained under<br>
conditions that favor the dimerization of ethylene to butenes, 2-butenes being<br>
favored over 1-butene. The butene containing product 43 of reactor 42 is passed to<br>
butene recovery zone 44 wherein an automotive grade gasoiine stream 45 is<br>
separated therefrom, and a C4 rich stream 46 is produced. Butene stream 46 is<br>
subjected to a drying step 47 to prepare it for use as feed 48 to metathesis zone 49.<br>
Additional ethylene feed 57 can be employed if necessary to ensure an excess of<br>
ethylene is present. The product 50 of reactor 49 is passed to fractional distillation<br>
zone 51 wherein ethane and ethylene are separated therefrom and returned as feed<br>
to reactor 49 by way of line 52. The C3 and heavier materials are passed by way of<br><br>
line 53 to a fractional distillation zone 54. in zone 54, polymer grade propylene 55 is<br>
separated out as a product of the overall dimerization/metathesis process, the<br>
remaining C4 and heavier materials being returned by way of line 56 as feed to<br>
butene recovery zone 44.<br>
Figure 3 employs units of both Figures 1 and 2. For sake of clarity, the<br>
reference numbers used in Figures 1 and 2 are carried over to Figure 3 for those<br>
units that are present in Figures 1 and 2, and are carried over into Figure 3.<br>
Accordingly, elements 1 through 16, inclusive, in Figure 3 are identical to the<br>
elements similarly marked in Figure 1, and will not, for sake of brevity, be described<br>
in greater detail at this point because the process is well known, and further detail is<br>
not necessary to inform one skilled in the art. At line 16, this invention starts to take<br>
over.<br>
Fractionation zone 17 is the same unit as set forth in Figure 1 but has a<br>
different feed thereto because of the addition of the stream in line 50 which will be discussed in more detail hereinafter. In this invention, zone 17 also separates an<br>
overhead stream 18 that contains essentially ethane and ethylene, leaving the<br>
remainder of stream 16 as a bottoms product stream 24.<br>
Stream 24 is subjected in zone 63 to selective hydrogenation of its acetylenic<br>
and dioiefinic components to monoolefins as aforesaid. The hydrogenated product<br>
64 is then passed to fractional distillation zone 25 wherein a chemical grade<br>
propylene product 65 is recovered as a product of the overall integrated process of<br>
Figure 3. The remainder of stream 64 is recovered from zone 25 and passed to<br>
butene recovery zone 44, see Figure 2.<br>
Stream 18 is passed to a selective hydrogenation zone 19, followed by<br>
fractional distillation in zone 21, just as explained hereinabove for Figure 1. At this<br>
point this invention realiy takes over. An ethane product stream 23 can, if desired,<br>
but is not required, be recovered as in Figure 1, but, in any event, ethylene stream<br>
22 is treated much differently in this invention. If desired, of course, a relatively pure<br>
ethylene product stream 22 can be removed from the overall process, but, in<br>
accordance with this invention, some, even a substantial amount, if not all, of stream<br>
22 can be passed into line 59. in addition to, or in lieu of, stream 59 containing all or<br>
part of the contents of stream 22, stream 59 can contain, for example, in whole or in<br>
part 1) a side draw of an impure ethylene stream from unit 21 (e.g., an impure<br><br>
ethylene stream taken from the tower above the feed but below the product stream<br>
22), and/or 2) ethylene fractionation feed stream 20.<br>
Stream 59 is split between lines 60 and 61. The relative amounts that go into<br>
steams 60 and 61 can vary widely depending on how the process is desired to be<br>
operated at any given, time, it only being required that some of stream 59 goes into<br>
each of streams 60 and 61. However, at least about 67 wt.%, but less than all, of<br>
stream 59 can go into stream 60 and about 33 wt.%, but less than all, can go into<br>
stream 61, both wt.% based on the total weight of stream 59.<br>
Stream 60 passes to ethylene dimerization zone 42, while stream 61 is<br>
passed to metathesis reactor 49, compare with Figure 2. The operation of zones 42<br>
and 49 are the same as in Figure 2, zone 42 producing a stream 43 that is rich in<br>
butenes, and zone 49 producing a propylene containing stream 50. As in Figure 2,<br>
additional ethylene feed can be supplied by way of line 57, if desired.<br>
Propylene rich stream 50 from reactor 49 is added to stream 16, and after<br>
processing in units 17 and 63, the propylene newly formed in zone 49 finds its way to<br>
zone 25, and, therefore, to propylene product-Stream 65.<br>
Stream 43 passes to butene recovery unit 44, from which is separated an<br>
automotive grade gasoline stream 45. The butenes rich product 46 is subjected to<br>
drying in unit 47 to prepare it as feed for disproportionation, and then passed by way<br>
of line 48 as feed to metathesis reactor 49.<br>
A comparison of Figures 1-3 shows that large and expensive fractionation<br>
tower 30 and butene recovery unit 33 of Figure 1 have been eliminated by this<br>
invention without eliminating the function thereof. This same comparison shows that<br>
fractionation towers 51 and 54 of Figure 2 have similarly been eliminated without<br>
loss of their function. Although this comparison will also show that selective<br>
hydrogenation zone 28 of Figure 1 is not present in Figure 3, this function has not<br>
been eliminated because a new selective hydrogenation zone 63 (Figure 3) is<br>
employed in this invention.<br>
Thus, it can be seen that a major advantage of this invention is the elimination<br>
of the difficult and costly operation of separating propane from propylene (tower 30).<br>
This results in a substantial savings in both construction and operating costs. But<br>
this is not the only advantage. A significant advantage for this invention is the gain in<br>
flexibility of operation in a number of ways. There is greater product flexibility<br><br>
because this invention produces a chemical grade propylene product, the grade that<br>
most processes require, without losing the abifity to upgrade to the more pure<br>
polymer grade of propylene later, if desired. This invention also provides the<br>
flexibility to significantly vary the relative production volumes of ethylene and<br>
propylene from an ethane cracking plant. This invention also provides the flexibility<br>
to produce a propylene product from a plant that cracks a feedstock that contains<br>
essentially only ethane. Finally, flexibility is improved in that the metathesis reactor<br>
has two sources of ethylene feed, i.e., from the cracking operation itself and from<br>
any residual ethylene from dimerization unit 42.<br>
The disproportionation reaction employed in reactor 49 is well known. It is a<br>
double displacement mechanism that starts with two different compounds. The<br>
reaction involves the displacement of groups from each compound to produce two<br>
new compounds. There is displacement cleavage at a double bond on each<br>
different compound, and the new compounds have double bonds where the old<br>
double bonds were cleaved. Thus, the metathesis of one mole of 2-butene and one<br>
mole of ethylene yields two moles of propylene. These reaction conditions can vary<br>
widely, but generally will include a temperature of from about 300 to about 800 F., a<br>
pressure of from about 200 to about 600 psig, and a weight hourly space velocity of<br>
from about 1 to about 100 reciprocal hours (based on butene and tungsten trioxide<br>
catalyst). Suitable catalysts that favor the disproportionation reaction include at least<br>
one of halides, oxides and/or carbonyls of at least one of molybdenum, tungsten,<br>
rhenium, and/or magnesium carried on an acidic support such as alumina, silica,<br>
alumina/silica, zeolites, and the like. This process is in commercial use, and further<br>
detail is not necessary in order to inform the art.<br>
The ethylene dimerization reaction is a homogeneous liquid phase reaction<br>
that is also well known, and in commercial use. Its reaction conditions will also vary<br>
widely, but will generally include a temperature of from about 80 to about 150 F.r a<br>
pressure of from about 100 to about 300 psig, and a residence time of from about 15<br>
to about 60 mjInutes. Suitable catalysts that favor the homogeneous liquid phase<br>
dimerization reaction include at least one from the aluminum alkyl halide family, such<br>
as ethyl aluminum dichloride, and a nickel salt-phosphine complex. This process is<br>
well known, see U.S. Patent Numbers 3,485,881; 3,627,700; and 3,726,939.<br><br>
EXAMPLE<br>
A feed consisting' essentially of ethane with less than 10 weight percent<br>
(wt.%) of impurities such as propane is cracked at a temperature of from about 1,500<br>
to about 1,600 F. at a pressure of from about 15 to about 25 psig. The cracked<br>
product is cooled and then subjected to oil quenching followed by water quenching to<br>
a temperature of about 100 F. at about 10 psig, after which it is subjected to<br>
compression to a pressure of about 520 psig. The compressed stream is cooled to<br>
about 60 F., dried, and then chilled and partially condensed in stages to a<br>
temperature of at least about minus 240 F. to separate from the compressed stream<br>
a high purity hydrogen stream. Methane is next separated from the remaining<br>
hydrocarbons via distillation as an overhead product from a demethanation tower.<br>
This cracked product (16, Figure 3) from the bottoms of the demethanizer is<br>
passed to distillation tower 17 which operates at a bottom temperature of about 170<br>
F. at a pressure of about 350 psig to form an overhead stream that consists<br>
essentially of ethane and ethylene, line 18, and a bottoms stream 24 that contains C3<br>
and heavier hydrocarbons.<br>
Stream 24 is subjected to selective hydrogenation 63. at a temperature of<br>
about 100 F., a pressure of about 300 psig, and a weight hourly space velocity of<br>
about 10 reciprocal hours, using a catalyst composed of palladium on an aluminum<br>
support. Thereafter the hydrogenated stream is distilled at a bottom temperature of<br>
about 200 F. and 110 psig to separate out an overhead product 65 that consists<br>
essentially of chemical grade propylene.<br>
Stream 18 is selectively hydrogenated using similar conditions and catalyst<br>
used on stream 24 followed by distillation of the hydrogenated stream In a tower with<br>
a bottom temperature of about 20 F. and pressure of about 280 psig to remove a<br>
stream consisting essentially of ethane therefrom, and leaving a separate stream 22<br>
consisting essentially of ethylene.<br>
About 50 wt.% of ethylene stream 22 is removed as product of the overall<br>
process. The remainder of stream 22 is split, about 67 wt.% to stream 60 and about<br>
33 wt.% to stream 61. All wt.% are based on the total weight of the stream.<br>
Stream 60 is passed to an ethylene dimerization reactor operating at a<br>
temperature of about 100 F., a pressure of about 150 psig, and a residence time of<br>
about 30 minutes, using a mixture of ethyi aluminum dichloride and a nickel salt-<br><br>
phosphine complex to catalyze the reaction. After quenching the reaction and<br>
removing residual catalyst, the dimerized product 43 is subjected to fractional<br>
distillation at a bottom temperature of about 230 F. and 70 psig to remove C5 and<br>
heavier hydrocarbons as an automotive gasoline product and produce a butene rich<br>
stream 46. Stream 46 is dried at ambient temperature and about 60 psig pressure<br>
using a molecular sieve adsorbent, and then returned as feedstock to metathesis<br>
reactor 49.<br>
Streams 48 arid 61 are introduced as feedstock into metathesis reactor 49<br>
which is operated at a temperature of about 600 F., a pressure of about 400 psig,<br>
and a weight hourly space velocity of about 15 reciprocal hours (based on butenes<br>
and the tungsten oxide catalyst), using a catalyst consisting essentially of a mixture<br>
of tungsten oxide on a silica support and magnesium oxide. In reactor 49, 2-butene<br>
is disproportionated in the presence of an excess of ethylene to form a product 50<br>
that is rich in propylene. This product is combined with cracked stream 16 and the<br>
resulting combination stream passed to fractionation zone 17 as feedstock<br>
thereform.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
INTEGRATED CRACKING AND METATHESIS PROCESS<br>
There is disclosed an integrated method for cracking an ethane containing feed<br>
and metathesizing ethylene to propylene, comprising thermally cracking said feed to form<br>
a first stream (16) containing ethane, ethylene and hydrocarbons heavier than ethane and<br>
ethylene and including 2-butenes, subjecting said first stream to a first fractional<br>
distillation (17) to form a second stream (18) containing at least some of said ethane and<br>
ethylene in said first stream and a third stream (24) containing predominantly said<br>
hydrocarbons in said first stream that are heavier than ethane and ethylene, recovering<br>
chemical grade propylene (65) from said third stream as a product of the overall process,<br>
subjecting a first portion (60) of said second stream to an ethylene dimerization operation<br>
to form a dimerization product stream (43) that contains newly formed butanes,<br>
subjecting a second portion (61) of said second stream to a metathesis operation wherein<br>
2-butenes are subjected to disproportionation conditions in the presence of ethylene to<br>
form a propylene containing stream (50), passing said propylene containing stream from<br>
said metathesis operation as feed to said first fractional distillation, passing said<br>
dimerization product stream to a butene recovery operation to form a first butene<br>
containing stream (48), passing said first butene containing stream as feed to said<br>
metathesis operation, separating a second butane containing stream (26) from said third<br>
stream, and passing said second butane containing stream to said butene recovery<br>
operation.</td>
