The present invention relates to a method for preparing indene derivatives that are utilizable as intermediates in the synthesis of the vitamin D2 derivative paricalcitol, which is useful as pharmaceutical, and to intermediates in the preparing thereof Cross-reference to Related Applications<br>
The present application claims priority under Japanese Patent Application 2006-70248, filed on March 15,2006, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
Paricalcitol, a vitamin D2 derivative denoted by formula (A), has been discovered to exhibit differentiation-inducing activity on malignant cells (see Patent Reference 1), and is widely employed to treat hyperthyroidism in patients suffering from chronic renal failure. Known methods of preparing vitamin D derivatives of the 19-nor-type, including paricalcitol, include a method employing a starting material in the form of 25-hydroxyvitamin D derivatives (see Japanese Translation of PCT International Application Heisei No. 3-505330 or the English language family member thereof, WO 90/10620, the entire contents of both of which are hereby uicorporated by reference herein.). Methods for obtaining such compounds by reacting an indene derivative and a phosphine oxide derivative (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (KOKAI) Heisei No. 5-221960 and the English language family members thereof, U.S. Patents 5,281,731 and 5,391,755, the entire contents of both of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein) are known to be more efficient methods. [0003]<br>
Numerous methods are known for preparing the indene derivatives employed in the above-cited methods (see U.S. Patent 4,804,502; J. Org. Chem. 51, 3098 (1986); J. Org. Chem. 51,1264 (1986); J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1, 834 (1978); J. Org. Chem. 48,1414 (1983); and J. Org. Chem. 51,1269 (1986); the entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein). However, all methods are unsatisfactory. These are all methods in which the double bonds at positions 7 and 8 and positions 22 and 23 of vitamin D2 are severed by a chemical method such as ozone degradation, after<br><br>
which a 25-hydroxylated vitamin D2 side chain (position 23 and beyond) that has been separately synthesized in multiple steps is introduced onto the indene derivative with severed side chains.And other methods in which an extremely large number of steps are employed to hydroxylate position 25 of an indene derivative with severed side chains.

[Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
[0009]<br>
The present invention covers the vitamin D2 derivatives denoted by formula (V): [Chem. 15]<br><br><br>
In formula (V), both Xi and X2 denote hydroxyl groups or jointly form an epoxy group. Each of Ri and R2 independently denotes a hydrogen atom or a protective group for a hydroxyl group. Examples of protective groups for hydroxyl groups are silyl groups, alkoxymethyl groups, aralkyloxymethyl groups, and acyl groups. More specific examples are trimethylsilyl groups, triethylsilyl groups, methoxymethyl groups, benzyloxymethyl groups, and acetyl groups. [0010]<br>
(A) Method for preparing the vitamin D2 derivative denoted by formula (V) The vitamin D2 derivative denoted by formula (V) above can be prepared by oxidizing the vitamin D2 derivative denoted by formula (IV) [Chem. 16]<br><br>
In formula (IV), Ri and R2 are defined as in formula (V). That is, each of Ri and R2 independently denotes a hydrogen atom or a protective group for a hydroxyl group. Examples of protective groups for hydroxyl groups are silyl groups, alkoxymethyl groups, aralkyloxymethyl groups, and acyl groups. More specific examples are trimethylsilyl groups, triethylsilyl groups, methoxymethyl groups, benzyloxymethyl groups, and acetyl groups. The vitamin D2 derivative denoted by formula (IV) can be obtained by the<br><br>
following method, over the following pathway, or by the method described in the<br>
following literature.<br>
[0011]<br>
The preparing method described in Example 4 of Japanese Patent No. 3,201,411 (title: Biological Production of Vitamin D) permits the obtaining of 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 from vitamin D2. The entire contents of Japanese Patent No. 3,201,411 and the English language family member thereof, U.S. Patent 5,474,923, are hereby incorporated by reference herein. [0012]<br>
The hydroxyl protective group can be introduced by the method described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Ed. (T. W. Green, Wiley liiterScience) (the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein). [0013]<br>
The vitamin D2 derivative denoted by formula (V) can be obtained by oxidizing a starting compound in the form of the vitamin D2 derivative denoted by formula (IV). The 7,8,25-trihydroxyvitamin D2 denoted by formula (II), which is an implementation form of the vitamin D2 derivative denoted by formula (V), can be similarly obtained by oxidation of a starting compound in the form of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 denoted by formula (I). The oxidation can be done in a suitable solvent with an oxidizing agent. Examples of the oxidizing agent are permanganates (such as sodium and potassium salts), cetyltrimethylammonium permanganate, osmium tetraoxide, and m-chloroperbenzoic acid. It suffices to gradually add the oxidizing agent in a ratio of about 1 to 10 mols per mol of starting compound and stir. The oxidation from formula (IV) to formula (V) and the oxidation from formula (I) to formula (U) is desirably conducted using a permanganate (such as a sodium or potassium salt), cetyltrimethylammonium permanganate, or osmium tetraoxide. m-Choroperbenzoic acid is desirably employed in oxidation from formula (I) to formula (V)l The solvent is not specifically limited other than that it does not negatively affect the reaction. Examples of solvents suitable for use are hydrophilic organic solvents such as ethanol, acetonifrile, and acetone; mixtures thereof with water; and halomethane-based solvents such as dichloromethane and chloroform. The reaction time is from 5 minutes to 30 hours, and the reaction temperature is desirably from -75 to 80°C. [0014] (B) Method for preparing indene derivative (1)<br>
The indene derivative denoted by formula (III) can be obtained by oxidizing the vitamin D2 derivative denoted by formula (V), which serves as starting compound.<br><br>
Similarly, the indene derivative denoted by formula (III)/is an implementation form of the vitamin D2 derivative denoted by formula (IV)y which aer\eo ao starting compottttd. [0015]<br>
The oxidation can be conducted, for example, in a suitable solvent with an oxidizing agent. Examples of oxidizing agents suitable for use are sodium periodate, iodobenzene acetate, [bis (trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene, and lead tetraacetate. It suffices to gradually add the oxidizing agent in a ratio of about 1 to 10 mols per mol of starting compound and stir. [0016]<br>
A periodate (such as sodium salt or potassium salt), orthoperiodate, lead tetraacetate, periodate (such as a sodium or potassium salt)/support, iodobenzene acetate, or [bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene can be employed in the oxidation from formula (V) to formula (III) and in the oxidation from formula (II) to formula (III)'. A periodate (such as a sodium or potassium salt), periodate (such as a sodium salt or potassium salt)/support, or iodobenzene acetate is desirably employed. [0017]<br>
The solvent is not specifically limited other than that it dose not negatively affect the reaction. Examples of solvents suitable for use are methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, acetone, dimethylether, halomethane-based solvents, benzene, and toluene; and mixtures thereof with water. The reaction time is 5 minutes to 30 hours and the reaction temperature is desirably -75 to 80°C. [0018]<br>
The above oxidation can also be implemented using an oxidizing agent supported on a solid support as described in the above examples of the oxidizing agent. Examples of solid supports are silica gel, alumina, cerite, montmorillonite and the like. (C) below can be consulted for how to use solid supports. Use in combination with a supported oxidizing agent prevents the precipitation of starting material and product in the reaction system and accelerates the reaction. Compared to when conducted without a supported oxidizing agent, the reaction residue is cleaner, and post-processing and purification are simpler. [0019] (C) Method for preparing indene derivatives (2)<br>
The indene derivative denoted by formula (III) can be obtained by oxidizing a starting compound in the form of the vitamin D2 derivative denoted by formula (IV). Similarly, the indene derivative denoted by formula (III) can be obtained by oxidizing a<br><br>
starting material in the form of the 7,8,25-trihydroxyvitamin D2 denoted by formula (II) that is an implementation form of the vitamin D2 derivative denoted by formula (V). [0020]<br>
The oxidation can be implemented using an oxidizing agent supported on a solid support. For example, periodates (such as sodium and potassium salts) and lead tetraacetate can be employed as the oxidizing agent, with permanganates being preferred. The solid support is not specifically limited other than that it dose not negatively affect the oxidizing agent, starting material, or solvent employed; the product; or the reaction. Examples of supports that can be employed in the reaction are silica gel (acid or neutral), alumina (acid, neutral, or alkaline), montmorillonite, and cerite. Preferably silica gel, alumina, cerite, montmorillonite and the like can be used. It suffices to gradually add in a ratio of about 1 to 10 mols per mol of starting compound and stir. Specifically, when employing potassium permanganate as the oxidizing agent, the weight ratio of potassium permanganate:support ranges from 1:1 to 1:10, desirably from 1:2 to 1:5, and preferably, from 1:2 to 1:4. The reagent can be added in a quantity (molar ratio) of from 1 to 30 equivalents, desirably 5 to 15 equivalents, relative to the starting material. The solvent is not specifically limited other than that it does not negatively affect the reaction, but an aqueous solvent is desirable. Examples are water-saturated ester solvents (such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate and the like), and halogenated hydrocarbon solvents (such as dichloromethane, chloroform and the like). The reaction can be conducted at a temperature of from -75°C to the boiling point of the solvent, and is desirably conducted at room temperature (10 to 25°C). The reaction period can be from 0.5 hour to overnight, and is desirably from 1.5 hours to overnight (12 to 20 hours). [0021]<br>
Once the reaction has ended, the target compound of the reaction can be recovered from the reaction mixture by the usual methods. For example, when insoluble material is present, suitable filfration can be conducted and then the solvent can be distilled off under reduced pressure. The reaction mixture also can be diluted with an organic solvent such as ethyl acetate, the mixture can be washed with water, the organic layer can be dried with magnesium sulfate anhydride, and the solvent can be distilled off to obtain the target compound. As needed, purification can be conducted by the usual methods, such as column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, crystallization and the like.
