				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods and compositions for the treatment of<br>
eye disorders; in particular but not exclusively to the treatment of glaucoma. In<br>
preferred embodiments, the invention relates to the use of RNAi technology to<br>
downregulate the expression of aqueous formation genes and aqueous outflow<br>
genes. Methods and compositions for the treatment of eye disorders are also<br>
provided;<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
RNAi as a tool to downregulate gene expression<br>
Gene targeting by homologous recombination is commonly used to determine<br>
gene function in mammals, but this is a costly and time-consuming process.<br>
Alternatively/ the functions of many genes can be determined after mRNA<br>
inhibition with ribozyme or antisense technologies. Although successful in some<br>
situations these technologies have been difficult to apply universally. The<br>
advent of siRNA-directed "knockdown" has sparked a revolution in somatic cell<br>
genetics, allowing the inexpensive and rapid analysis of gene function in<br>
mammals.<br>
Establishing a convenient and reliable method to knock-out gene expression at<br>
the mRNA level has been a recurrent theme in molecular biology over the last<br>
15 years. In efforts to generate loss-of function cells or organisms, various<br>
molecules that included, for example, antisense sequences/ ribozymes, and<br>
chimeric oligonucleotides have been tested, but the design of such molecules<br>
was based on trial and error, depending on the properties of the target gene.<br>
Moreover, the desired effects were difficult to predict, and often only weak<br>
suppression achieved (Braasch &amp; Corey, 2002).<br>
After the discovery of the phenomenon in plants in the early 1990s, i n 1998<br>
Andy Rre and Craig Mello for ttie first time demonstrated with the worm<br>
Caenorhabditis elegans that dsRNA (double-stranded RNA) may specifically and<br>
selectively inhibit gene expression in an extremely efficient manner (Rre et at.,<br>
1998). In their experiment, the sequence of the first strand (the so-called sense<br>
RNA) coincides with that of the corresponding region of the target messenger<br>
RNA (mRNA). The second strand (antisense RNA) is complementary to this<br>
mRNA. The resulting dsRNA turned out to be far more (several orders of<br>
magnitude) efficient than the corresponding single-str§rtaedRNA molecules (in<br>
particular, antisense RNA). Rre et a/., 1998 named the phenomenon RNAi for<br>
RNA interference. This powerftif gene silencing mechanism has been shown to<br>
operate in several species among most pbyfogeneHc phyla.<br>
RNA! begins when an enzyme named DICER encounters dsRNA and chops it<br>
into pieces called small-interfering RNAs or siRNAs. This protein belongs to the<br>
RNase El nuclease family. A complex of proteins gathers up these RNA remains<br>
and uses their code as a guide to search out and destroy any RNAs in the cell<br>
with a matching sequence, such as target mRNA (for review see Bosher &amp;<br>
Labouesse, 2000).<br>
The RNAi phenomenon (Akashi eta/., 2001) might be summarized as follows:<br>
• Step 1: dsRAIA recognition and scanning process.<br>
• Step 2: dsRNA cleavage through RNase III activity and production of siRNAs.<br>
• Step 3: association of the siRNAs and associated factors in RISC complexes.<br>
• Step 4: recognition of the complementary target mRNA.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
• Step 5: cleavage of the target mRNA in the centre of the region<br>
complementary to the siRNA.<br>
• Step 6: degradation of the target mRNA and recycling of the RISC compl ex.<br>
In trying to apply the RNAi phenomenon as a technology for gene knockdown,<br>
it was soon realized that mammalian cells have developed various protective<br>
phenomena against viral infections that could impede the use of this approach.<br>
Indeed, the presence of extremely low levels of viral dsRNA triggers an<br>
interferon response, resulting in a global non-specific suppression of translation,<br>
which in turn triggers apoptosis (Williams, 1997, Gil &amp; Esteban, 2000).<br>
In 2000, a first attempt with dsRNA resulted in the specific Inhibition of 3 genes<br>
(MmGFP under the control of the Elongation Factor la, E-cadherin, and c-mos)<br>
in the mouse oocyte and early embryo. Translational arrest, and thus a PKR<br>
response, "was'TjorTobserved aTtife"embTyicdTitinued"to""develop"(Wian"riy"8r<br>
Zernicka-Goetz, 2000). One year later, research at Ribopharma AG (Kulmbach,<br>
Germany) first demonstrated the functionality of RNAi in mammalian cells.<br>
Using short (20-24 base pairs) dsRNAs - which are called SIRPLEX™- they<br>
specifically switched off genes even in human cells without initiating the acutephase<br>
response. Similar experiments carried out later by other research groups<br>
(Elbashir et aL, 2001; Caplen et ai, 2001) further confirmed these results.<br>
A year later, Paddison et aL (Paddison et al, 2002) tried to use small RNAs<br>
folded in hairpin structures to inhibit the function of specific genes. This work<br>
was inspired by previous studies showing that some genes in Caenorhabditis<br>
eiegans naturally regulate other genes through RNAi by coding for hairpinstructured<br>
RNAs. Tested in a variety of normal and cancer human and mouse<br>
cell lines, short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are able to silence genes as efficiently as<br>
their siRNA counterparts. Moreover, shRNAs exhibit better reassociatlon kinetics<br>
in vivo than equivalent duplexes. Even more important, these authors<br>
generated transgenic cell lines engineered to synthesize shRNAs that exhibit a<br>
long-lasting suppressing effect throughout cell divisions (Eurogentec). Recently,<br>
another group of small RNAs (also comprised in the range of 21-25 nt) was<br>
shown to mediate downregulation of gene expression. Th ese RNAs, known as<br>
small temporally regulated RNAs (stRNAs), have been described in<br>
Caenorhabditis elegans were they regulate timing of gene expression during<br>
development It should be noted that stRNAs and siRNAs/ despite obvious<br>
similarities, proceed through different modes of action (for review see Banerjee<br>
&amp; Slack, 2002. In contrast with siRNAs, 22 nt long stRNAs downregulate<br>
expression of target mRNA after translational initiation without affecting mRNA<br>
integrity. Recent studies indicate that the two stRNAs first described in<br>
nematodes are the members of a huge family with hundreds of additional<br>
micro-RNAs (miRNAs) existing in metazoans (Grosshans &amp; Slack, 2002).<br>
Scientists have initially used RNAi in several systems, including Csenorhabditis<br>
e7eiDrosophila"trvpanosornes, and"vanotB other im/e?!BDTatBsrM6reove7;"<br>
using this approach, several groups have recently presented the specific<br>
suppression of protein biosynthesis in different mammalian cell lines -<br>
specifically in HeLa cells - showing that RNAi is a broadly applicable method for<br>
gene silencing in vitro. Based on these results, RNAi has rapidly become a well<br>
recognized tool for validating (identifying and assigning) gene functions. RNA<br>
interference employing short dsRNA oligonudeotides will, moreover, permit to<br>
decipher the function of genes being only partially sequenced. RNAi will<br>
therefore become inevitable in studies such as:<br>
« Inhibition of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in eukaryotic<br>
cells. In this context, RNAi is a straight-forward tool to rapidly assess gene<br>
function and reveal null phenotypes.<br>
• Development of the RNAi technology for use in post-implantation embryos.<br>
• The predominant economic significance of RNA interference is established by<br>
its application as a therapeutic principle. As so, RNAI may yield RNA-based<br>
drugs to treat human diseases.<br>
Glaucoma<br>
Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness. Approximately 15% of<br>
cases of blindness world-wide result from glaucoma. The most common type,<br>
primary open-angle glaucoma, has a prevalence of 1/200 in the general<br>
population over 40 years of age.<br>
Glaucoma has been simply defined as the process of ocular tissue destruction<br>
caused by a sustained elevation of the Intra Ocular Pressure <iop above its></iop>
normal physiological limits.<br>
It Is becoming increasingly clear that many forms of glaucoma have a genetic<br>
component, and much current research is focused on identifying chrom osomal<br>
regions and genes that contribute to glaucoma. It is likely that the aetiology of<br>
OAG is multifactorial, resulting from a combination of mutations in more than<br>
one gene and as yetlodenWed environmental factors. With?e"p7clT:o"jQv(2fnie"<br>
and adult-onset OAG, several loci have been identified. However, only one gene<br>
is known, namely the myodfin / TIGR (trabecular meshwork inducibte<br>
glucocorticold response) gene at the GLC1A locus on chromosome Iq21-q31.<br>
More than thirty mutations of this gene have been identified in ethnically<br>
diverse populations worldwide. Sudies have shown that it is responsible for<br>
only about 5% of OAG overall (See reviews in Wirtz &amp; Samples, 20O3, and<br>
Khaw et al, 2004a).<br>
Pathogenesis<br>
Most glaucomas are characterised by an elevated IOP, although the level of<br>
elevation may vary. In those glaucomas in which the elevation is initially low<br>
(i.e., open angle glaucoma, melanocytic glaucoma) and some secondary<br>
glaucoma, retinal ganglion cell and optic nerve damage are slow to progress. In<br>
angle-closure glaucoma the sudden high rise in IOP often renders the eye blind,<br>
undoubtedly primarily due to a cessation of axoplasmic flow at the level of the<br>
lamina cribrosa.<br>
In human studies, it has been widely accepted that tissue ischaemia has a part<br>
to play in the initiation or progression of the optic disc damage that occurs in<br>
glaucoma. Retinal ganglion cell degeneration may be necrosis, but the<br>
possibility that it is apoptosis triggered by the rise in IOP is plausible and the<br>
respective roles of nitric oxide and glutamate are thought to be relevant during<br>
progression of the disease (For a recent review on the subject see Osborne et<br>
al, 2003).<br>
Treatment<br>
Although several aetiologies are involved in the glaucoma complex, the absolute<br>
determinant in therapy selection is ttie amount of primary and/or induced<br>
change in pressure within the iridocorneal angle.<br>
aT lowering this"<br>
pressure, although the pathophysiojogical mechanisms by which elevated IOP<br>
leads to neuronal damage in glaucoma are unknown.<br>
Medical suppression of an elevated IOP can be attempted using four types of<br>
drugs: the aqueous formation suppressors (among them, carbonic a nhydrase<br>
inhibitor beta-adrenergic blocking agents, or alphaZ-adrenoreceptor agonists)<br>
miotlcs (i.e. parasympathomimetics - chollnergics-, or antfchoiinesterase<br>
inhibitors); uveoscleral outflow enhancers; and the hyperosmofjc agents (that<br>
produce an osmotic pressure gradient across the blood/aqueous barri er within<br>
the ciliary epithelium). All four are used in the treatment of glaucoma,, the first<br>
three commonly as emergency treatment and in long term control uvhile the<br>
hyperosmotic agents are invaluable as emergency and preoperative treatment<br>
A fifth category of drugs, the neuroprotection agents, is beginning to emerge as<br>
an important possible addition to medical therapy. Indeed, observation that the<br>
NOS and glutamate levels are elevated in glaucoma and that they are involved<br>
in retina! ganglion cell necrosis or apoptosis has raised the possibility of<br>
neuroprotective therapies and even neuroregeneration. Thus NOS inhibitors,<br>
exciting amino acid antagonists, glutamate receptor antagonists, apoptosis<br>
inhibitors and calcium channel blockers are all potential candidates in the<br>
ievelopment of future glaucoma therapies. The calcium channel blockers may<br>
•educe the effect of impaired microcirculation to the optic nerve head whilst<br>
Dotentially increasing outflow facility at the level of the trabecular cells.<br>
Reviews of various eye disorders and their treatments are given in the<br>
references, in particular in Bunce (2005), Costagliola (1995, 2000), Cullinane<br>
(2002), Sakaguchi (2002), Shah (2000), and Wang (2005).<br>
Currently our existing therapies must fall short of the mark and the practical<br>
difficulties associated with the assessment of outflow facility, the accurate<br>
monitoring of therapy and the complexity of surgical techniques all combine to<br>
ronfounStfie prognosis; ThlToveTnaing"fa<br>
degeneration of the retinal ganglion cell, thus neuroprotection through effective<br>
ocular hypotension is the essential requirement of any therapy we utilise (for a<br>
recent review on the subject, see Khaw et al 2004b).<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the present invention we describe a method for the treatment of eye<br>
conditions characterised by an altered IOP in animals, including humans. In<br>
particular, the eye conditions may include glaucoma, uveitis, and inflammation.<br>
The method is based on the downregulation of expression of genes involved in<br>
aqueous formation or aqueous outflow in the eye. Downregulation may be<br>
effected by the use of double stranded nucleic acid moieties, named siNA or<br>
small interfering IMA that are directed at interfering with the mRNA expression<br>
of various candidate genes. The siNA are preferably siRNA, although modified<br>
nucleic acids or similar chemically synthesised entities are also included within<br>
the scope of the invention.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention relate to topical application of siNA.<br>
Embodiments of the invention also provide pharmaceutical compositions for use<br>
in the treatment of eye conditions. The invention may be used within the fields<br>
of local eye treatments, of target genes involved in glaucoma pathogenesis, as<br>
well as the use of chemically synthesized entities to treat animal (including<br>
humans) diseases.<br>
In addition to the treatment of glaucoma, the present method is also suitable<br>
for the treatment of other diseases of the anterior chamber of the eye. In<br>
particular, the method may be applied to the treatment of diseases<br>
characterised by altered aqueous formation or outflow in the eye. Examples of<br>
conditions which may be treated include local conditions such as infections or<br>
inflammations, and general conditions such as uveitis or expression of systemic<br>
diseases. Further, certain embodiments of the invention provide treatment for<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Target genes<br>
In the present invention, we define a list of target genes, whose expression<br>
levels may alter IOP. These genes can fall within the groups of genes involved<br>
in aqueous formation or the group of genes involved in aqueous outflow. Here<br>
is a list of our target genes:<br>
• Carbonic Anhydrases II, IV and XII<br>
• Adrenergic Receptors: betal and 2 and alpha 1A, IB and ID<br>
• Acetylcholinesterase<br>
• Cyclooxygenases 1 and 2<br>
• ATPases: alphal, alpha2, alphas, betal, beta2<br>
• Endothelial Leukocyte Adhesion Molecule I (ELAM-1)<br>
• Angiotensln System: Angiotensin II, Angiotensin II Converting Enzymes<br>
(ACE I and ACE II), Angiotensin II Receptors (ATR1 and ATR2) and Renin<br>
• Cochtin<br>
Design of siNA<br>
Although the mechanisms for RNAi remain unknown, the steps required to<br>
generate the specific dsRNA oligonucleotides are clear. It has been shown that<br>
dsRNA duplex strands that are 21-26 nucleotides in length work most<br>
effectively in producing RNA interference. Selecting the right homologous<br>
region within the gene is also important Factors such as the distance from start<br>
codon, the G/C content and the location of adenosine dimers are important<br>
when considering the generation of dsRNA for RNAi. One consequence of this,<br>
however, is that one may need to test several different sequences for the most<br>
efficient RNAi and this may become costly.,<br>
In 1999", Tuscfil eTaraeaplieTeTiTe" that"<br>
their efficiency is a function of the length of the duplex, the length of the 3'-end<br>
overhangs, and the sequence in these overhangs. Based on this founder work,<br>
Eurogentec recommends that the target mRNA region, and hence the sequence<br>
of the siRNA duplex, should be chosen using the following guidelines:<br>
Since RNAi relies on the establishment of complex protein interactions, it is<br>
obvious that the mRNA target should be devoided of unrelated bound factors.<br>
In this context, both the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) and regions<br>
dose to the start codon should be avoided as they may be richer in regulatory<br>
protein binding sites. The sequence of the siRNA is therefore selected as<br>
follows:<br>
• In the mRNA sequence, a region located 50 to 100 nt downstream of the<br>
AUG start codon or upstream of stop codon is selected.<br>
• In this region, the following sequences are searched for: AA(N19), CA(N 19).<br>
• The G/C percentage for each identified sequence is calculated. Ideally, the<br>
G/C content is 50 % but it must less than 70 % and greater than 30 %.<br>
• Preferably, sequences containing following repetitions are avoided: AAA,<br>
An accessibility prediction according to the secondary structure of the<br>
rnRNA is carried out as well.<br>
A BLAST is also performed (i.e. NCBJ ESTs database) with the nucleotide<br>
sequence fitting best the previous criteria to ensure that only one gene will<br>
be inactivated.<br>
order to maximize the result's interpretation, the following precautions<br>
should be taken when using siRNAs:<br>
 Always test the sense and antisense single strands in separate experiments.<br>
Try a scramble siRNA duplex. This should have the same nucleotide<br>
composition as your siRNA but lack significant sequence homology to any other<br>
gene (iniaiiaing yours) "<br>
• If possible, knock-down the same gene with two Independent siRNA duplexes<br>
to control the specificity of the silencing process.<br>
Practically, each of the selected genes is introduced as a nudeotide sequence in<br>
a prediction program that takes into account all the variables described above<br>
for the design of optimal oiigonucleotides. This program scans any mRNA<br>
nucleotide sequence for regions susceptible to be targeted by siRNAs. The<br>
output of this analysis Is a score of possible siRNA oligonucleotides. The highest<br>
scores are used to design double stranded RNA oligonudeotides (typically 21 bp<br>
long, although other lengths are also possible) that are typically made by<br>
chem ical synthesis.<br>
In addition to siRNA, modified nucleotides may also be used. We plan to test<br>
several chemical modifications that are well known in the art These<br>
modifications are aimed at increasing stability or availability of the siNA.<br>
Examples of suitable modifications are described in the publications referenced<br>
below, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Studies show that replacing the 3'-terminal nucleotide overhanging segments of<br>
a 21-mer siRNA duplex having two -nucleotide 3'-overhangs with<br>
deoxyribonucleotides does not have an adverse effect on RNAi activity.<br>
Replacing up to four nucleotides on each end of the siRNA with<br>
deoxyribonucleotides has been reported to be well tolerated, whereas complete<br>
substitution with deoxyribonucleotides results in no RNAi activity (Elbashir<br>
2001). In addition, Elbashir et al. also report that substitution of siRNA with 2'-<br>
0- methyl nucleotides completely abolishes RNAi activity.<br>
Affinity modified nudeosides as described in WO2005/044976 may be used.<br>
This publication describes oligonudeotides comprising nudeosides modified so<br>
the target mRNA and/or in the complementary siNA strand.<br>
GB2406568 describes alternative modified oftgonudedides chemically modified<br>
to provide improved resistance to degradation or improved uptake. Examples of<br>
such modifications indude phosphorotfiioate intemudeotide linkages, 2'-Omethyl<br>
rlbonucleob'des, 21-deoxy-fluoro ribonucleotides, 2'-deoxy<br>
ribonucleotides, "universal base" nucleotides, 5-Omethyl nucleotides, and<br>
inverted deoxyabasic residue incorporation.<br>
WO2004/029212 describes oligonucleotides modified to enhance the stability of<br>
the siRNA or to increase targeting efficiency. Modifications include chemical<br>
cross linking between the two complementary strands of an siRNA and chemical<br>
modification of a 3' terminus of a strand of an siRNA. Preferred modifications<br>
are internal modifications, for example, sugar modifications, nucleobase<br>
modifications and/or backbone modifications. 2'-fiuoro modified ribonucleotides<br>
and 2-deoxy ribonucleotides are described.<br>
WO2005/040537 further recites modified oligonucleotides which may be used in<br>
the invention.<br>
As well as making use of dsNA and modified dsNA, the present invention may<br>
use short hairpin NA (shNA); the two strands of the siNA molecule may be<br>
connected by a linker region, which may be a nucleotide linker or a nonnucleotide<br>
linker.<br>
In addition to siNA which is perfectly complementary to the target region,<br>
degenerate siNA sequences may be used to target homologous regions.<br>
W 02005/045037 describes the design of siNA molecules to target such<br>
homologous sequences, for example by incorporating non-canonical base pairs,<br>
for example mismatches and/or wobble base pairs, that can provide additional<br>
"targefuences. In iristarxlvheleTnlsTHattt TOrRanonkar<br>
base pairs (for example, mismatches and/or wobble bases) can be used to<br>
generate siNA motecutes that target more than one gene sequence. In a noniimitjng<br>
example, non-canonical base pairs such as UU and CC base pairs are<br>
used to generate siNA molecules that are capable of targeting sequences for<br>
differing targets that share sequence homotogy. As such, one advantage of<br>
using siNAs of the invention is that a single siNA can be designed to include<br>
nucleic acid sequence that is complementary to the nucleotide sequence that is<br>
conserved between homologous genes. In this approach, a single siNA can be<br>
used to inhibit expression of more than one gene instead of using more than<br>
one siNA molecule to target different genes.<br>
Preferred siNA molecules of the invention are double stranded. A siNA molecule<br>
of the invention may comprise blunt ends, that is, ends that do not include any<br>
overhanging nucieotides. In one embodiment, an siNA molecule of the<br>
invention can comprise one or more blunt ends. In preferred embodiments, the<br>
siNA molecules have 3' overhangs. siNA molecules of the invention may<br>
comprise duplex nucleic acid molecules with 3' overhangs of n nucieotides<br>
(5&gt;n&gt;l). Elbashir (2001) shows that 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes are most<br>
active when containing 3'-terminaI dinucleotide overhangs.<br>
Candidate oligonucleotides are further filtered for interspecies sequence<br>
conservation in order to facilitate the transition from animal to human clinical<br>
studies. In preferred embodiments of the invention conserved oligonucleotides<br>
are used; this allows a single oligonucleotide sequence to be used in both<br>
animal models and human clinical trials.<br>
GenBank Accession Numbers corresponding to our selected human target genes<br>
are shown in Rgure 1. In some of these genes, alternative splicing produces a<br>
family of transcripts that differ in exon content. The present invention allows<br>
individual targeting of each transcript form.<br>
Selected oKgonucleotide sequences against which RNAi is directed are shown in<br>
Rgure 2. Displayed sequences are the DNA sequences targeted by the sINA.<br>
Therefore, the Invention would make use of MA duplexes with sequences<br>
complementary to the indicated DNA sequences.<br>
The sequences shown in Rgure 2 are not limiting. As a matter of fact, target<br>
DNA need not necessarily be preceded by AA or CA. Further, target DNA could<br>
be constituted by sequences included in Rgure 2 flanked by any contiguous<br>
sequence.<br>
In vitro and animal studies.<br>
Obtaining siRNA duplexes<br>
RNAs are preferably chemically synthesized using appropriately protected<br>
ribonucleoside phosphoramidites and a conventional DNA/RNA synthesizer.<br>
Substitution of one or both strands of a siRNA duplex by 2-deoxy or 2-0-<br>
methyl oligoribonucleotides abolished silencing in fly extract (Elbashir et al.<br>
2001). In mammalian cells, however, it seems possible to substitute the sense<br>
siRNA by a 2'-0-methy! oligoribonucleotide (Ge eta/. 2003).<br>
Most conveniently, siRNAs are obtained from commercial RNA oligo synthesis<br>
suppliers, which sell RNA-synthesis products of different quality and costs. In<br>
general, 21-nt RNAs are not too difficult to synthesize and are readily provided<br>
in a quality suitable for RNAi.<br>
Suppliers of RNA synthesis reagents include Proligo (Hamburg, Germany),<br>
Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO, USA), Glen Research (Sterling, VA, USA),<br>
ChemGenes (Ashland, MA, USA), and Cruachem (Glasgow, UK), Qiagen<br>
(Germany), Ambion (USA) and Invitrogen (Scotland). The previous custom RNA<br>
synthesis companies are entitled to provide siRNAs with a license for target<br>
validation. In particular, our siRNA suppliers are Ambion, Dharmacon and<br>
service fbr siRNA, and supply the siRNA wfth HPLC purification and delivered in<br>
dry form along with RNasefree water. A central web-based resource for RNAi<br>
and siRNA methodologies, along with links to additional siRNA related products<br>
and services, can be found on the website of above-mentioned suppliers.<br>
An annealing step is necessary when working with single-stranded RNA<br>
molecules. K is critical that all handling steps be conducted under sterile, Rnase<br>
free conditions. To anneal the RNAs, the oligos must first be quantified by UV<br>
absorption at 260 nanometres (nm). The following protocol based on Elbashir<br>
et al. (2001) is then used for annealing;<br>
• Separately aliquot and dilute each RNA oligo to a concentration of 50 uM.<br>
• Combine 30 ul of each RNA oligo solution and 15 ul of 5X annealing buffer.<br>
Final buffer concentration is: 100 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM HEPES-KOH<br>
pH 7.4,2 mM magnesium acetate. Final volume is 75 pi.<br>
• Incubate the solution for 1 minute at 90 °C, centrifuge the tube for 15<br>
seconds, let sit for 1 hour at 37 °C, then use at ambient temperature. The<br>
solution can be stored frozen at -20 °C and freeze-thawed up to 5 times. The<br>
final concentration of siRNA duplex is usually 20 uM.<br>
Alternatively, already annealed dsRNAs may be purchased from the <br>
modified nucleic acids may also be used. For example, an overview<br>
of the types of modification which may be used is given in W003/070744, the<br>
contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Particular attention is<br>
drawn to pages 11 to 21 of this publication. Other possible modifications are as<br>
described above. The skilled person will be aware of other types of chemical<br>
modification which may be incorporated into RNA molecules.<br>
In vitro system<br>
To check the specificity of the siRNA interference different cell cultures that<br>
express the target genes were employed. The-cells used for these experiments<br>
were: "raBblT nongmentecl" aliafy" epitfieiruTfr<br>
epithelium cells OMDC, and human embryonic kidney cells HBQ93. The cells<br>
are Incubated with the corresponding siRNA duplexes, and analysis of the<br>
downregulat'on of expression of the target gene is carried out For linking<br>
siRNA knockdown to specific phenotypes in cultured cells, it is necessary to<br>
demonstrate the reduction of targeted protein or at least demonstrate the<br>
reduction of the targeted mRNA.<br>
mRNA levels of the target gene can be quantitated by real-time quantitative<br>
PCR (RT-PCR). Further, the protein levels can be determined in a variety of<br>
ways well known in the art, such as Western blot analysis with specific<br>
antibodies to the different target allow direct monitoring of the reduction of<br>
targeted protein.<br>
Transfection of siRNA duplexes<br>
Several examples of techniques well known in the art are as follows: We can<br>
perform a single transfection of siRNA duplex using a cationic lipid, such as<br>
RNAiFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) and Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent<br>
(Invitrogen) and assay for silencing 24,48 and 72 hours after transfection.<br>
A typical transfection protocol can be performed as follows: For one well of a 6-<br>
well plate, we transfect using lOOnM as final concentration of siRNA. Following<br>
RNAiFect protocol, we seed, the day before transfection, 2-4 x 10s cells per well<br>
In 3ml of an appropriate growth medium, containing DMEM, 10% serum,<br>
antibiotics and glutamine, and incubate cells under normal growth conditions<br>
(37°C and 5% COa). On the day of transfection, cells have to be at 30-50%<br>
confluence. We dilute 15ul of 20uM siRNA duplex (corresponding to 100 nM<br>
final concentration) in 85ul of Buffer EC-R, to give a final volume of lOOul, and<br>
mix by vortexing. For complex formation, we add 19 ul of RNAiFect Transfection<br>
Reagent to the diluted siRNA and mix by pipetting or vortexing. After incubating<br>
the samples for 10-15 minutes at room temperature to allow formation of<br>
"transfection complexes, we add the"complexes drop::wtseinti6aie oells"with2.9<br>
ml of fresh growth medium tow in antibiotics. After swirling the plates to ensure<br>
uniform distribution of tile transfection complexes, we incubate the cells under<br>
their normal growth conditions. The day after, the complexes are removed and<br>
fresh and comptefce growth medium is added. To monitor gene silencing, cells<br>
are collected at 24, 48 and 72 hours post-transfection. The LJpofectamine 2000<br>
Reagent protocol is quite similar. The day before transfection, we seed 2-4 x<br>
10s cells per well in 3ml of an appropriate growth medium, containing DMEM,<br>
10% serum, antibiotics and glutamine, and incubate cells under normal growth<br>
conditions (37°C and 5% C02). On the day of transfection, cells have to be at<br>
30-50% confluence. We dilute 12.5ul of 20uM siRNA duplex (corresponding to<br>
100 nM final concentration) in 250ul of DMEM, to give a final volume of 262.5ul,<br>
and mix. Also, 6ul of LJpofectamine 2000 is diluted in 250ul of DMEM and<br>
mixed. After a 5 minutes incubation at room temperature, the diluted oligomer<br>
and the diluted Lipofectamine are combined to allow complex formation during<br>
a 20 minutes incubation at room temperature, Afterwards, we add the<br>
complexes drop-wise onto the cells with 2 ml of fresh growth medium low in<br>
antibiotics and mix gently by rocking the plate back and forth, to ensure<br>
uniform distribution of the transfection complexes. We incubate the cells under<br>
their normal growth conditions and the day after, the complexes are removed<br>
and fresh and complete growth medium is added. To monitor gene silencing,<br>
cells are collected at 24, 48 and 72 hours post-transfection.<br>
The efficiency of transfection may depend on the cell type, but also on the<br>
passage number and the confluency of the cells. The time and the manner of<br>
formation of siRNA-liposome complexes (e.g. inversion versus vortexing) are<br>
also critical. Low transfection efficiencies are the most frequent cause of<br>
unsuccessful silencing. Good transfection is a non-trivial issue and needs to be<br>
carefully examined for each new cell line to be used. Transfection efficiency<br>
may be tested transfecting reporter genes, for example a CMV-driven EGFPexpression<br>
plasmid (e.g. from Qontech) or a B-Gal expression plasmid, and<br>
'TheJTaisesseBbyphase contrastahl/6Ffluol:iscercm{croscopyti1ene%ay.<br>
Testing of siRNA duplexes<br>
Depending on the abundance and the life tame (or turnover) of the targeted<br>
protein, a knock-down phenotype may become apparent after 1 to 3 days, or<br>
even later. In cases where no phenotype is observed, depletion of the protein<br>
may be observed by immunofluorescence or Western blotting.<br>
After transfections, total RNA fractions extracted from cells were pre-treated<br>
with DNase I and used for reverse transcribed using a random primer. PCR is<br>
amplified with a specific primer pair covering at least one exon-exon junction In<br>
order to control for amplification of pre-mRNAs. RT/PCR of a non-targeted<br>
mRNA is also needed as control. Effective depletion of the mRNA yet<br>
undetectable reduction of target protein may indicate that a large reservoir of<br>
stable protein may exist in the cell. Alternatively, RealTime PCR amplification<br>
can be used to test in a more precise way the mRNA decrease or<br>
disappearance. Real-time reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR quantitates the initial<br>
amount of the template most specifically, sensitively and reproducibly. Realtime<br>
PCR monitors the fluorescence emitted during the reaction as an indicator<br>
of amplicon production during each PCR cycle. This signal increases in direct<br>
proportion to the amount of PCR product in a reaction. By recording the<br>
amount of fluorescence emission at each cycle, it is possible to monitor the PCR<br>
reaction during exponential phase where the first significant increase in the<br>
amount of PCR product correlates to the initial amount of target template.<br>
To verify the interference pattern of the differentially expressing genes<br>
identified in the cell cultures, qRT-PCR was performed according to the<br>
manufacturer protocol.. For quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), approximately 250<br>
ng of total RNA were used for reverse transcription followed by PCR<br>
amplification with specific primers for each gene in reaction mixture containing<br>
Master SYBR Green I. Basic PCR conditions comprised an initial step of <br>
Quantification of b-actin mRNA was used as a control for data normalization.<br>
Relative gene expression comparisons work best when the gene expression of<br>
the chosen endogenous/Jntemal control is more abundant and remains<br>
constant, in proportion to total RNA, among the samples. By using an invariant<br>
endogenous control as an active reference, quantitation of an mRNA target can<br>
be normalised for differences in the amount of total RNA added to each<br>
reaction.<br>

uncoated or they can be coated by known techniques. In some cases such<br>
coatings can be prepared by known techniques to delay disintegration and<br>
a bsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action<br>
over a longer period. For example, a" time delay material such "as glyceryi<br>
monostearate or glyceryi distearate can be employed.<br>

mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions can contain a thickening<br>
agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyi alcohol. Sweetening agents<br>
arid flavouring agents can be added toptwJde"palal3He"oral pfaraBonsT<br>
These compositions can be preserved by the addition of an antJ-oxidant such as<br>
ascorbic add.<br>
Dispersibte powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous<br>
suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture<br>
with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more<br>
preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents or suspending agents are<br>

example poiyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions can also contain<br>
sweetening and flavouring age, ,fcs.<br>
Syrups and elixirs can be formulated with sweetening agents, for example<br>
glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol, glucose or sucrose. Such formulations can<br>
also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavouring and colouring agents.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions can be in the form of a sterile injeotable<br>
aqueous or oleaginous suspension.<br>
This suspension can be formulated according to the known art using those<br>
suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents that have been<br>
mentioned above.<br>
A sterile"InjertaBlT pVeparatf<br>
suspension in a non-toxic parentally acceptable diiuent or solvent, for example<br>
as a solution in 1,3- butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents<br>
that can be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonk: sodium chloride<br>
solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent<br>
or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil can be employed<br>
including synttietic mono-or diglycerides. In addition, fatty adds such as oteic<br>
add find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
The nucleic acid molecules of the invention can also be administered in the<br>
form of suppositories, e. g. , for rectal administration of the drug. These<br>
compositions can be prepared by mixing the dmg with a suitable non-irritating<br>
excipient that is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal<br>
temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such<br>
materials include cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.<br>
Nucleic acid molecules of the invention can be administered parenterally In a<br>
sterile medium. The drug, depending on the vehicle and concentration used.,<br>
can either be suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. Advantageously, adjuvants<br>
such as local anaesthetics, preservatives and buffering agents ca n be dissolved<br>
in the vehicle.<br>
It is understood that the specific dose level for any particular subject depends<br>
upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound<br>
employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of<br>
administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion, drug combination<br>
and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.<br>
For administration to non-human animals, the composition can also be added to<br>
the animal feed or drinking water. It can be convenient to formu late the animal<br>
feed and drinking water compositions so"tfii£fherainirnar takes" in"a<br>
therapeutfcafly appropriate quantity of the composition along with its diet, ft<br>
can ateo be convenient to present the composition as a premix for addition to<br>
the feed or drinking water.<br>
The nudek: add molecules of the present invention can also be administered to<br>
a subject in combination with other therapeutic compounds to increase the<br>
overall therapeutic effect The use of multiple compounds to treat an indication<br>
can increase the beneficial effects while reducing the presence of side effects.<br>
Alternatively, certain siNA molecules of the invention can be expressed within<br>
cells from eukaryotic promoters. Recombinant vectors capable of expressing the<br>
siNA molecules can be delivered and persist in target cells. Alternatively, vectors<br>
can be used that provide for transient expression of nucleic acid molecules.<br>
Such vectors can be repeatedly administered as necessary. Once expressed, the<br>
siNA molecule interacts with the target mRNA and generates an RNAi response.<br>
Delivery of siNA molecule expressing vectors can be systemic, such as by<br>
intravenous or intra-muscuiar administration, by administration to target cells<br>
ex-planted from a subject followed by reintroduction into the su bject, or by any<br>
other means that would allow for introduction into the desired target cell.<br>
Animal studies<br>
The New Zealand rabbit is the gold standard in experimental platforms<br>
designed to study IOP. It is easy to handle and it has a big eye, similar in size<br>
to the human organ. In addition, present equipment to measure IOP is not<br>
suited to use in animals with small eyes such as mice or rats. Finally, rabbits<br>
have an IOP (around 23 mm Hg) that can be brought down to up to 40% its<br>
value using local commercial hypotensive medication. Thus, although it is<br>
possible to generate rabbit glaucoma models (for example, surgically blocking<br>
episclerotic veins or artificially occluding the trabecular meshwork), we have<br>
used normotensive rabbits since, in our hands, the pharmacological decrease in<br>
Deeiy and reprbucl61yrrneasured7<br>
Experimental protocol<br>
f*&gt;rmotEnsive New Zealand White rabbits (mates, 2-3 kg) were used. The<br>
animals were kept in individual cages with free access tD food and water. They<br>
were submitted to artificial 12 hours light/darkness cydes, to avoid uncontrolled<br>
arcadian oscillations of IOP Animal handfing and treatment were carried out in<br>
accordance with the European Communities Council Directive (86/609/EEC) and<br>
the statement of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology on<br>
the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.<br>
The drugs were typically administered by instilling a small volume (typically 40<br>
uL) on the corneal surface. Contralateral eyes were treated with the vehicle<br>
alone and could be used as controls in each experiment lest there is a<br>
sympathy phenomenon with the other eye. Multiple experiments in the same<br>
animal should be abolished.<br>
IOP measurements were done using a contact tonometer (TONOPEN XL,<br>
Mentor, Norwell, Massachusetts). The TonoPen tonometer is very convenient<br>
due to its reliability and small size. Measurements with this instrument were<br>
HEK293. The effect of siRNAs over the target gene was analyzed by real time<br>
PCR and semi-quantitative PCR according to standard protocols. The gene<br>
target transcript levels were normalized using actin as housekeeping gene.<br>
Table I below shows representative results of real time PCR experiments for<br>
some of the target genes described previously. The values represent the mean<br>
of the percentage of siRNA interference over each gene expression once<br>
normalized with the control cells and their standard deviations. Compared to<br>
the control cells, the level of the different transcripts at both 24 and 48h time<br>
points was significantly reduced after the siRNA treatment In the Table are<br>
included some of the different siRNAs that were tested and their different<br>
efficacies in the interference of the target gene. The siRNAs used in the Table<br>
correspond toBiis"RurnansiRhlA targets given in" Rgure 2as "follows.<br>

Example 2 In vivo assays.<br>
Previously to the siRNA therapeutical application, the in vivo assays were<br>
validated to determine the proper siRNA delivery.<br>
Those siRNAs selected by the in vitro assays were applied to the animal model,<br>
following the protocol previously described. To avoid the effect of IOP<br>
fluctuations due to circadian cycles, all the applications were performed at the<br>
same time. To determine the siRNA effect, intraocular pressures (lOPs) were<br>
measured as previously mentioned.<br>
Since glaucoma pathology presents an Increase in the intraocular pressure, the<br>
aim was to obtain a decrease in its levels following siRNA application.<br>
Most of the results for the different targets showed a significant decrease in<br>
IOP levels comparing with controls and also with commercial drugs<br>
(Latanoprost and Dorzolamide) and the animals treated with vehicle alone<br>
(negative control),didn't present any significant change in their IOP baseline.<br>
The data are summarized in table II where values represent the mean of the<br>
maximum percentage of IOP reduction after siRNA treatment once normalized<br>
and their standard deviations. The decrease in IOP was statistically significant<br>
for all the treated targets. These results indicate that siRNAs and commercial<br>
drugs act in a similar way, reducing IOP levels around 20%, although siRNAs<br>
present a more maintained effect. No secondary effects were observed in the<br>
animals along the experimental protocols. The siRNAs used in these<br>
experiments correspond to the human targets given in Rgure 2 as follows:<br>
