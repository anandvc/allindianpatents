CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[01] This application claims priority to U.S. Patent Application No. 10/007,877, filed<br>
November 13, 2001, converted to U.S. Provisional Application No.	, incorporated herein<br>
by reference in its entirety for all proposes.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[02] This invention relates to novel oral sustained release formulations for delivery of an<br>
active agent (e.g., a drug), especially a highly water-soluble drug. More particularly, this<br>
invention relates to novel formulations comprising a micelle-forming drug having a charge<br>
and at least one polymer having an opposite charge.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[03] Administration of drugs via conventional oral and intravenous methods severely<br>
limits the effectiveness of most drugs instead of maintaining drug levels within therapeutic<br>
windows, these methods cause an initial, rapid rise in plasma concentration levels followed<br>
by a rapid decline below therapeutic levels as the drugs are metabolized by the body.<br>
Therefore, repeated doses are necessary to maintain drugs at therapeutic levels for a sufficient<br>
period of time to achieve a therapeutic effect. To address this problem, numerous sustained<br>
release preparations have been developed to eliminate the initial burst effect and allow drug<br>
release at constant levels.<br>
[04] Polymeric formulations are typically used to achieve extended drug release (see,<br>
Langer et al. Nature 392:6679 supp. (1998)). Various successful polymeric sustained release<br>
preparations have been developed for release of drugs with different physical properties.<br>
Such preparations have been extremely effective for increasing release times for relatively<br>
hydrophobic and water-insoluble drugs.<br>
[05] However, due to rapid drug diffusion through polymer matrices, it has been difficult<br>
to achieve extended release for highly soluble drugs using current sustained release<br>
technologies. Thus, there is a need for new formulations and processes which are capable of<br><br>
reducing drug diffusion and eliminating a burst effect of highly water-soluble drugs. The<br>
present invention fulfills these and other needs.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[06] The present invention provides inter alia, an oral sustained release preparation<br>
comprising a micelle-forming drug and an oppositely charged polymer. Although a concept<br>
of a micelle is well known for the field of the surfactant or drug carrier, application of a<br>
micelle-forming drug to the sustained release formulation is not known at all. Furthermore it<br>
is really surprising that this formulation is excellent effective on the extended release of<br>
active agents, especially water-soluble drugs. A further advantage lies in the ability of the<br>
formulation to provide slow release even when the formulation contains large drug loads.<br>
[07] As such, the present invention provides an oral sustained release pharmaceutical<br>
formulation, comprising: a micelle forming drug having a charge; and at least one polymer<br>
having an opposite charge, further if necessary hydrogel-forming polymer substance and<br>
hydrophilic base. The micelle forming drug may have a positive charge or a negative charge<br>
at physiological pH.<br>
[08] In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for modulating a<br>
micelle forming drug release profile, comprising varying the molar ratio of micelle forming<br>
drug having a charge with at least one polymer having an opposite charge, varying the<br>
additional amount of polymer having an opposite charge, thereby modulating the micelle<br>
forming drug release profile. Suitable micelle forming drugs include, for example,<br>
antidepressants, β-adrenoceptor blocking agents, anesthetics, antihistamines and the like.<br>
Preferably, the micelle forming drug is a water-soluble drug.<br>
[09] In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for extending release<br>
of a micelle forming drug, comprising: orally asministering a pharmaceutical formulation<br>
comprising a micelle forming drug having a charge; and at least one polymer having an<br>
opposite charge, thereby extending release of the micelle forming drug.<br>
[10] In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for extending release<br>
of a micelle forming drug, comprising: orally administering a pharmaceutical formulation<br>
comprising a micelle forming drug having a charge; and at least one polymer having an<br>
opposite charge, further if necessary hydrogel-forming polymer substance and hydrophilic<br>
base, thereby extending release of the micelle forming drug.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS.<br>
[38] This present invention provides, inter alia, an oral sustained release preparation<br>
comprising a micelle-forming active agent {i.e., drug) and an oppositely charged polymer<br>
forming a hydrogel matrix. The formulation is typically manufactured by direct compression<br>
of the drug and the polymeric excipient.<br>
[39] Advantageously, this formulation provides an extremely low, release rate of active<br>
agent. In a preferred aspect, hydrogen-bonded complexes between the oppositely charged<br><br>
polymers and drug micelles prevent rapid diffusion of the drug. Without being bound by any<br>
particular theory, it is believed that drug release occurs when the charge of the polymer is<br>
neutralized by OH ions at the matrix/dissolution border and these bonds are disrupted.<br>
[40] In one embodiment, the number of administrations of the formulation can be reduced,<br>
thereby increasing patient compliance. Further, side effects of the drug can be reduced by<br>
suppressing rapid increases in blood concentration of the drug (seen in standard<br>
formulations). A further advantage of this formulation is that the release rates of the<br>
formulations are not significantly affected by loading with high amounts of drug.<br>
[41] Factors and events which form a theoretical basis for the embodiments of the<br>
invention are discussed herein. However, this discussion is not in any way to be considered<br>
as binding or limiting on the present invention. Those of skill in the art will understand that<br>
the various embodiments of the invention may be practiced regardless of the model used to<br>
describe the theoretical underpinnings of the invention.<br>

bromophenyl-α-phenylmemoxy)-NN-dimemylemylamine hydrochloride] and dipenylpyraline<br>
hydrochloride (4-diphenyl-methoxy-l-methylpiperidine hydrochloride) respectively. Those<br>
of skill in the art will know of other active ingredients suitable for use in the present<br>
invention.<br>
[44] In preferred embodiments, active agents of this invention are highly water soluble<br>
drugs. And further preferred embodiments, active agents of this invention are basic drugs.<br>
This invention is particularly useful for such drugs, which exhibit a strong burst effect due to<br>
rapid diffusion through polymeric matrices. Highly water soluble drugs include salts formed<br>
with inorganic and organic acids (positively charged due to non-covalently attached protons),<br>
permanently positively (or negatively) charged molecules, and negatively charged molecules<br>
(salts of weak and strong acids). For example, highly water soluble drug means that its<br>
solubility is over 10 mg/mL, more preferably over 100 mg/mL.<br><br>
[45] Specific active agents suitable for use in formulations of this invention, micelle<br>
forming drug having a charge, can be selected based on critical micelle concentration (CMC)<br>
and/or log P, which are closely related {see, Example 3). Log P, the drug distribution<br>
coefficient between octanol and water, reflects the hydrophobic properties of the uncharged<br>
drug form. CMC, a measure of the concentration at which a particular compound will form a<br>
micelle, is a function of hydrophobicity, as well as molecular stereochemistry, group rotation<br>
ability, and counter ions. The presence of micelle-like charged drug aggregates within a<br>
hydrogel matrix containing oppositely charged polymers leads to cooperative interaction. It<br>
is this cooperative interaction that governs the release rate of drug from the polymeric matrix.<br>
Therefore, CMC and log P can be used to predict drug release rate and thus identify those<br>
drugs which will have extended release in formulations of this invention. Drugs with a low<br>
CMC and/or high log P would be released slowly in formulations of this invention, while<br>
those less likely to form micelles would be released with profiles similar to those for standard<br>
oral formulations.<br>
[46] Accordingly, the release profile of a drug can be modulated using any standard<br>
methods known to those of skill in the art to modulate the critical micelle concentration<br>
and/or the degree of cooperative interaction between a micelle-forming drug and the<br>
oppositely charged polymers. Methods of modulating CMC and/or the degree of cooperative<br>
interaction would include altering the hydrophobicity of the drug by addition of functional<br>
groups and any other techniques to alter electrostatic interaction between the drug and the<br>
polymeric excipient. In certain aspects, the present invention provides a method for<br>
extending the release profile of a micelle forming drug, comprising: decreasing the critical<br>
micelle concentration of the micelle forming drug, thereby extending the release profile of the<br>
micelle forming drug.<br>
[47] In certain other aspects, the present invention provides further methods of extending<br>
the release profile of a micelle forming drug. These include for example, varying the<br>
polymer compositions, changing the polymer-drug ratio, varying the additional amount of<br>
polymer having opposite charge as well as varying the tablet size and shape.<br>
[48] One method to determine whether micelles exist, is to measure the variation of light<br>
scattering at an angle of 90° i.e., S90, as a function of concentration in an appropriate<br>
solution. Thereafter, scattering graphs can be analyzed. If scattering is increasing<br>
continuously with increasing the concentration, no micelle formation is occurring. If graphs<br>
indicate clearly defined inflection in the S90 vs. concentration plots, it is attributed to the<br>
micelle formation. Critical micelle concentration is determined from the inflection point of<br><br>
graphs of the scattering at an angle of 90° to the incident beam, S90, as a function of the<br>
molar concentration. Those of skill in the art will know of other methods to determine<br>
micelle formation.<br>
[49] Advantageously, drug loads for formulations of this invention can be extremely high.<br>
Moreover, the release rate does not increase significantly with increase of drug content (e.g.,<br>
up to 60 wt. %) in SGF and actually decreases with increase of drug content in SIF (see,<br>
Example 8).<br>
[50] In certain preferred aspects, the micelle forming drug has a positive charge or a<br>
negative charge at physiological pH. As used herein, physiological pH is about 0.5 to about<br>
8, more preferably, about 0.5 to about 5.5. The positive charge or negative charge at<br>
physiological pH refers to the overall charge on the molecule. That is, it is possible to have<br>
more than one functional group contributing to the charge, as long as the overall charge is<br>
positive or negative.<br>
[51] One assay method to determine whether the micelle forming drug or polymer has a<br>
positive charge or a negative charge at physiological pH is to empirically determine the<br>
charge on the molecule. For example, a suitable buffer solution or gel is made having a<br>
certain pH. A cathode and an anode are placed in the buffered solution or, alternatively, a gel<br>
electrophoresis is used. The micelle forming drug if positively charged migrates to the<br>
cathode. If the micelle forming drug is negatively charged, the drug migrates to the anode.<br>
Thepolymer having an opposite charge in the pharmaceutical formulation will migrate to the<br>
opposite electrode. For example, if the micelle forming drug is positively charged, it will<br>
migrate to the cathode. The polymer having an opposite charge will migrate to the anode.<br>
[52] In another assay method, the charge on the micelle forming drug and/or polymer is<br>
assessed using the Henderson-Hasselbach equation. The Henderson-Hasselbach equation is a<br>
mathematical statement which defines the pH of a solution of a conjugate acid-base pair in<br>
terms of the dissociation constant of the weak acid and the equilibrium concentrations of the<br>
acid and its conjugate base. When pK = pH, then, [Ha] is equal to [A]. Values of pK yield<br>
quantitative information concerning acid strength, very strong acids being characterized by<br>
undefined pK values (pK = -log 0, example HC1); semi-strong acids being characterized by<br>
small pK values; and weak acids being characterized with large pK values. Using the<br>
Henderson-Hasselbach equation, the charge on the micelle forming drug and/or polymer is<br>
assessed to determine the charge thereon.<br><br>
II. Charged Polymeric Excipients of the Invention<br>
[53] The formulation of this invention also comprises at least one polymeric excipient or<br>
polymer with a charge opposite that of the micelle-forming drug of the invention. In a<br>
preferred aspect, the cooperative interaction of the charged excipient with the micelle-<br>
forming drug is the basis for the extended release properties of this invention.<br>
[54] The formulation can comprise negatively charged polymers, such as ones with a<br>
carboxylic group or a sulfate group. These include, but are not limited to, sulfated polymers,<br>
polyacrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid, methylmethacrylic-methacrylic acid copolymer,<br>
alginates, xanthan gum, gellan gum, guar gum, carboxymethylcellulose, locust bean gum, and<br>
hyaluronic acid.<br>
[55] Especially preferred polymers with a negative charge include polyacrylic acid and<br>
sulfated polymers. Sulfated polymers include carrageenan (e.g., Viscarin® and/or Gelcarin®),<br>
and dextran sulfate. Preferably, when polyacrylic acid is selected as one polymer, sulfated<br>
polymers can be selected as other polymers.<br>
[56] Preferably, the formulation can also comprise a hydrogel-forming polymer with<br>
physical characteristics, such as nigh viscosity upon gelation, which permit the preparation of<br>
the present invention to withstand the contractile forces of the digestive tract associated with<br>
the digestion of food and more or less retain its shape during its travel down to the lower<br>
digestive tract, namely the colon. For example, a polymer showing a viscosity of not less<br>
than 1000 cps in 1% aqueous solution (at 25°C) is particularly preferred.<br>
[57] The properties of the polymer depend on its molecular weight. The hydrogel-forming<br>
polymer which can be used in the present invention is preferably a substance of<br>
comparatively high molecular weight, viz. a polymer having an average molecular weight of<br>
not less than 2 x 106 and more preferably not less than 4 x 106. Further, the polymers can be<br>
branched chain, straight chain, crossed linked or any combination thereof.<br>
[58] Examples of said polymer substance are polyethylene oxide, such as POLYOX® WSR<br>
303 (viscosity-average molecular weight: 7,000,000, viscosity: 7,500 to 10,000 cps (aqueous<br>
1% solution at 25°C)), POLYOX® WSR Coagulant (viscosity-average molecular weight:<br>
5,000,000, viscosity: 5,500 to 7,500 cps (aqueous 1% solution at 25°C)), POLYOX® WSR-<br>
301 (viscosity-average molecular weight of 4,000,000, viscosity: 1650-5500 cps (aqueous 1%<br>
solution at 25°C), POLYOX® WSR N-60K (viscosity-average molecular weight: 2,000,000,<br>
viscosity: 2,000 to 4,000 cps (2% aqueous solution at 25°C) (all made by Union Carbide),<br>
ALKOX® E-75 (viscosity-average molecular weight: 2,000,000 to 2,500,000, viscosity: 40 to<br><br>
70 cps (aqueous 0.5% solution at 25°C)), ALKOX® E-100 (viscosity-average molecular<br>
weight of 2,500,000 to 3,000,000, viscosity: 90 to 110 cps (aqueous 0.5% solution at 25°C)),<br>
ALKOX® E-130 (viscosity-average molecular weight: 3,000,000 to 3,500,000, viscosity: 130<br>
to 140 cps (aqueous 0.5% solution at 25°C)), ALKOX® E-160 (viscosity-average molecular<br>
weight: 3,600,000 to 4,000,000, viscosity: 150 to 160 cps (aqueous 0.5% solution at 25°C)),<br>
ALKOX® E--240 (viscosity-average molecular weight: 4,000,000 to 5,000,000, viscosity: 200<br>
to 240 cps (aqueous 0.5% solution at 25°C)) (all made by Meisei Kagaku Co., Ltd.), PEO-8<br>
(viscosity-average molecular weight: 1,700,000 to 2,200,000, viscosity: 20 to 70 cps (aqueous<br>
0.5% solution at 25°C)), PEO-15 (viscosity-average molecular weight: 3,300,000 to<br>
3,800,000, viscosity: 130 to 250 cps (aqueous 0.5% solution at 25°C)), PEO-18 (viscosity-<br>
average molecular weight: 4,300,000 to 4,800,000, viscosity: 250 to 480 cps (aqueous 0.5%<br>
solution at 25°C)) (all made by Seitetsu Kagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd.), etc.<br>
[59] In order to provide a hydrogel-type preparation suitable for sustained release, it is<br>
generally preferable that the preparation contains about 10 to about 95 weight %, more<br>
preferably, about 15 to about 90 weight % of a hydrogel-forming polymer of a preparation<br>
weighing less than 600 mg. Preferably, the preparation contains not less than 70 mg per<br>
preparation and preferably not less than 100 mg per preparation of the hydrogel-forming<br>
polymer. The above-mentioned levels will insure that the formulation will tolerate erosion in<br>
the digestive tract for a sufficiently long time in order to achieve sufficient sustained release.<br>
[60] The above hydrogel-forming polymer may be used singly, or two or more kind(s) of<br>
the above hydrogel-forming polymers in mixture may be used.<br>
[61] Preferably, the particular combination and ratio of polymeric excipients is that which<br>
allows the slowest rate of release under both gastric and intestinal conditions, pH<br>
independently. The optimal combination and ratio can vary depending on the particular active<br>
agent and percent loading of active agent.<br>
[62] Preferred combinations of excipients includePAA/PEO, PAA/carrageenan, and<br>
PAA/dextran; sulfate. Preferably, the polymers are in a 1:0.5 ratio, 1:1 ratio, or a 1:5 ratio;<br>
most preferably, the polymers are in a 1:1.5 ratio.<br>
[63] Preferred combinations of excipients also include PAA/carrageenan/PEO. Preferably,<br>
PAA and carrageenan are in a 1:0.5 ratio, 1:1 ratio, or a 1:5 ratio; most preferably, the<br>
polymers are in a 1:1.5 ratio. Preferably, PAA plus carrageenan, and PEO are in a 1:0.5 ratio,<br>
1:1 ratio, or a 1:2 ratio; most preferably, the polymers are in a 1: 1.5 ratio.<br>
[64] In order for accomplishment of sustained drug release in the lower digestive tract as<br>
well as in upper digestive tract of humans, the preparation should be a gelled at least 2 hours<br><br>
after administration and the tablet should be further eroded through moving the lower<br>
digestive tract so that the tablet is released.<br>
[65] The term "percentage gelation of the formulation" used in the present invention<br>
means the ratio of the tablet that has been gelled once the compressed tablet has been<br>
moistened for a specific amount of time and is determined by the method of determination of<br>
the percentage gelation described below {see, Test Method 2). Because the preparation<br>
absorbs water when retained in the upper digestive tract and thereby almost completely gels<br>
(that is, percentage gelation is not less than 70%, preferably not less than 75%, more<br>
preferably not less than 80%) and move to the lower digestive tract as the surface of the<br>
preparation is being eroded with drug being released by further erosion, the drug is<br>
continually and thoroughly released and absorbed. As a result, sustained release performance<br>
is realized, even in the lower digestive tract where there is little water. Specifically, if the<br>
percentage gelation is less than approximately 70%, sufficient release of the drug will not be<br>
obtained and there is a chance of a reduction in bioavailability of the drug (EP No.<br>
1,205,190A1).<br>
[66] The term "upper digestive tract" in the present invention means the part from the<br>
stomach to the duodenum and jejunum "lower digestive tract" means the part from the ileum<br>
to the colon.<br>
[67] The formulation can also comprise hydrophilic base to achieve the higher percent<br>
gelation. There are no particular restrictions to the hydrophilic base as long as it can be<br>
dissolved before above-mentioned hydrogel-forming polymer substance gels. For example,<br>
the amount of water needed to dissolve 1g of this hydrophilic base is preferably 5mL or less<br>
(at 20 ± 5°C), more preferably 4mL of less (at same temperature).<br>
[68] Examples of said hydrophilic base include water-soluble polymers such as<br>
polyethylene glycol (for instance, Macrogol 4000, Macrogol 6000 and Macrogol 20000, all<br>
of which are trade names of Nippon Oil and Fats Co.), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (for instance,<br>
PVP® K30, of which is trade name of BASF), sugar alcohols, such as D-sorbitol, xylitol,<br>
etc., saccharides, such as sucrose, maltose, lactulose, D-fructose, dextran (for instance,<br>
Dextran 40), glucose, etc., surfactants, such as polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil (for<br>
instance, Cremophor® RH40 (made by BASF), HCO-40, HCO-60 (made by Nikko<br>
Chemicals), polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene glycol (for instance, Pluronic® F68 of which<br>
is trade name of Asahi Denka), etc. Polyethylene glycol, sucrose, and lactulose are preferred<br>
and polyethylene glycol (particularly Macrogol 6000) is further preferred. The above<br><br>
hydrophilic base can be used singly, or two or more kind(s) of the above hydrophilic base in<br>
mixture can be used.<br>
[69] When the hydrophilic base is added in the present invention, the ratio used is<br>
preferably approximately 5 to approximately 80 wt% per total preparation, more preferably 5<br>
to 60 wt% based on the total preparation.<br>
[70] Preferred combinations of excipients include PAA/PEO/PEG. Preferably, PAA and<br>
PEO are in a 1:0.5 ratio, 1:1 ratio, or a 1:5 ratio. More preferably, the amount of PEG is 5<br>
wt.% to 60 wt.% based on the total preparation<br>
[71] Preferred combinations of excipients also include PAA/carrageenan/PEO/PEG.<br>
Preferably, PAA and carrageenan are in a 1:0.5 ratio, 1:1 ratio, or a 1:5 ratio. Preferably,<br>
PAA plus carrageenan, and PEO are in a 1:0.5 ratio, 1:1 ratio, or a 1:2 ratio. More preferably,<br>
the amount of PEG is 5 wt.% to 60 wt.% based on the total preparation.<br>
[72] The formulation can also comprise a single positively charged polymer or<br>
combinations of such polymers, including, but not limited to, polyethylene imine, chitosan,<br>
polyvinylpirridinium bromide, and polydimethylaminoethylmethacrylate.<br>
[73] Depending on the polymer(s) viscosity, the polymer material can form a matrix<br>
comprising the active ingredient. For example, a polymer showing a viscosity of not less than<br>
1000 cps in 1% aqueous solution is particularly preferred due to its matrix forming ability.<br>
[74] Extending release of a micelle forming drug can be achieved by a method of oral<br>
administrating formulation of this invention.<br>
HI. Other Tablet Modifications<br>
[75] Modification of drug release through the tablet matrix of the present invention can<br>
also be achieved by any known technique, such as, e.g., application of various coatings, e.g.,<br>
ion exchange complexes with, e.g., Amberlite IRP-69. The tablets of the invention can also<br>
include or be co-administered with GI motihty-reducing drugs. The active agent can also be<br>
modified to generate a prodrug by chemical modification of a biologically active compound<br>
which will liberate the active compound in vivo by enzymatic or hydrolytic cleavage, etc.<br>
Additional layers or coating can act as diffusional barriers to provide additional means to<br>
control rate and timing of drug release.<br><br>
IV.	Formulation Additives<br>
[76] If desired, the preparation of the present invention may include appropriate amounts<br>
of other pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as vehicles {e.g., lactose, mannitol,<br>
potato starch, wheat starch, rice starch, corn starch, and crystalline cellulose), binders (e.g.,<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, methylcellulose, and gum arabic),<br>
swelling agents (e.g., carboxymethylcellulose and carboxy-methylcellulose calcium),<br>
lubricants (e.g., stearic acid, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, talc, magnesium meta-<br>
silicate aluminate, calcium hydrogen phosphate, and anhydrous calcium hydrogen<br>
phosphate), fluidizers (e.g., hydrous silica, light anhydrous silicic acid, and dried aluminum<br>
hydroxide gel), colorants (e.g., yellow iron sesquioxide and iron sesquioxide), surfactants<br>
(e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate, sucrose fatty acid ester), coating agents (e.g., zein,<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, and hydroxypropylcellulose), buffering agents (e.g., sodium<br>
chloride, magnesium chloride, citric acid, tartaric acid, bibasic sodium phosphate, monobasic<br>
sodium phosphate, calcium hydrogen phosphate, ascorbic acid, ), aromas (e.g., l-menthol,<br>
peppermint oil, and fennel oil), preservatives (e.g., sodium sorbate, potassium sorbate, methyl<br>
p-benzoate, and ethyl-benzoate).<br>
V.	Manufacturing<br>
[77] The preparation of the present invention is a solid preparation having a certain shape,<br>
and can be manufactured by any conventional processes. Typical processes include, e.g.,<br>
compression tableting manufacturing processes. These processes comprise blending and if<br>
necessary granulating the active agent, the charged polymers, and if desired, additional<br>
additives, and compression-molding the resulting composition/formulation. Alternative<br>
processes include, e.g., a capsule compression filling process, an extrusion molding process<br>
comprising fusing a mixture and setting the fused mixture, an injection molding process, and<br>
the like. Any coating treatments, such as, e.g., sugar coating, may also be carried out.<br>
[78] The following examples are intended to illustrate, but not to limit, the present<br>
invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Test Method 1<br>
This Test Method illustrates the basic procedure for manufacturing<br>
formulations of this invention, as well as measuring drug release.<br><br>
Several different formulations with different drugs were manufactured. Drugs<br>
were manually mixed with the excipients in a mortar and compressed into 400 mg tablets<br>
using Carver press or Oil press with 1000 lb applied force. Flat face 11 mm round tooling<br>
was used.<br>
Materials<br>
Carbopol 971 (BF Goodrich); Polyox 303 (Union Carbide); two types of<br>
carrageenan, Viscarin® 109 and Gelcarin (FMC); Xantural™ 180 (Monsanto Pharmaceutical<br>
Ingredients), a xanthan gum Keltone® LVCR (Monsanto Pharmaceutical Ingredients); a<br>
sodium alginate Chitosan (M. W. International, Inc.); Macrogol 6000 (Nippon Oil and Fats<br>
Co.); Methocel K100M (The Dow Chemical Company); a hydroxypropylmethylcellulose<br>
(HPMC); Cellulose Gum 12M31P TP (Hercules); a sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC);<br>
and Dextran Sulfate (Sigma).<br>
Methods<br>
In vitro drug release was measured by in vitro dissolution experiments. These<br>
studies were carried out using USP apparatus II at a paddle speed of 100 rpm in 1000 ml<br>
dissolution medium from Examples 1 to 10. Drug release was evaluated with either<br>
Simulated Gastric Fluid (SGF), pH=1.2 or Simulated Intestinal Fluid (SIF), pH=7.5, both<br>
prepared according to USP without enzyme added. Tablet sinkers were applied in all<br>
experiments, At predetermined time intervals, a sample was withdrawn from the vessel and<br>
assayed using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 240 nm.<br>
Example 1<br>
This example illustrates that drug release rate does not correlate with drug<br>
solubility, indicating that a specific interaction is influencing its release rate.<br>
The release behavior of a large group of basic highly soluble drugs (10 wt. %<br>
of drug ) from a directly compressed matrix tablet using 1:1.5 polyacrylic acid/polyethylene<br>
oxide (PAA/PEO) mix as excipient was studied under modified Simulated Intestinal Fluid<br>
(SIF) conditions. Release rate was characterized by T50 (time during which 50% of drug has<br>
been released from matrix to the solution) (Figure 1). Results of the study are presented in<br>
Table 1, where drug properties and release rate are summarized.<br>
Identically charged drugs have significantly different release profiles in<br>
modified SIF which do not correlate with drug solubility (Figure 1, Table 1). Therefore, it can<br>
be concluded that a single electrostatic interaction does not by itself result in extended release<br>
of soluble drugs.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
This example illustrates that the log P of a drug can be used to predict whether<br>
extended release will be achieved using the formulation of this invention. An ability to<br>
predict drug release behavior based on the log P characteristic is one of the key advantages of<br>
this invention.<br>
The ability of a drug to bind to a particular polyelectrolyte is dependent on its<br>
critical micelle concentration (CMC). However, since the CMC value is rarely available for<br>
drugs, an attempt was made to relate the release rate to drug properties which are commonly<br>
used for drag characterization. For drugs which were used in the above-described release<br>
experiments (Table 1), a variety of parameters such as molecular weight, solubility, pKa, log<br>
P, log D, and surface tension were analyzed in terms of their correlation with the release time.<br>
It appeared that log P (distribution coefficient of uncharged drug form between octanol and<br>
water) demonstrates a close to linear relationship with T50 (Figure 2). Log P is closely related<br>
to CMC. In fact, a practically linear relationship has been established between log P and<br>
CMC (Figure 3). Log P and CMC values for different drugs were extracted from the<br>
Attwood publications.<br>
Example 3<br>
This example illustrates that extended release can be achieved for permanently<br>
positively charged molecules using a 1:1.5 PAA/PEO excipient mixture.<br>
The following positively charged molecules were tested: benzethonium<br>
chloride and bethanechol chloride, which have one positive charge; thiamine mononitrate and<br>
thiamine hydrochloride, which have two positive charges; and betaine, which is a dipole<br>
(Figure 4). Although thiamine HC1 showed slightly fast release, all the drugs demonstrated<br>
extended release with different rates (Table 2).<br><br><br>
These results demonstrate that even if a drag does not have strong<br>
hydrophobic groups, specific interaction with charged polymeric excipients is still possible<br>
(see, for example bethanechol chloride), as long as the drug carries a permanent positive<br>
charge. On the other hand, drug structure and charge location can play an important role in<br>
the ability to interact with polymeric excipients (see, thiamine HC1). Thiamine's location of<br>
charges at the center of the molecule (Figure 4) may effect micelle formation.<br>
Example 4<br>
This example illustrates that oppositely charged drugs and polymeric<br>
excipients are critical for extending drug release. As Figure 5 shows, the highly soluble<br>
negatively charged drugs, sodium cefazoline and sodium cefmatazole, diffuse out the<br><br>
negatively charged PAA/PEO matrix with a T50 of about 5 hours without achieving extended<br>
release.<br>
Example 5<br>
This example demonstrates the effect of fluid environment on drug release<br>
profiles for 1:1.5 PAA/PEO mixtures.<br>
The initial experiments described in Examples 1-4 were conducted under<br>
Simulated Intestinal Fluid (SIF) conditions, where PAA is ionized. To evaluate the release<br>
kinetics under gastric conditions, dissolution of different types of soluble drugs was<br>
performed in modified Simulated Gastric Fluid (SGF). Table 3 compares T50 values in SGF<br>
and SIF for different drugs.<br><br>
As Table 3 shows, release time in SIF is significantly longer that in SGF.<br>
Obviously, in. low pH media ionization of PAA is suppressed to a great extent. This may<br>
prevent formation of cooperative bonds between PAA/PEO and the drug. Another possible<br><br>
reason for the short release times in SGF is that formation of a hydrogen-bonded polymer<br>
complex between the electronegative oxygen atom of PEO and the carboxylic group of PAA<br>
at low pH conditions blocks the carboxylic groups from interaction with drug.<br>
Example 6<br>
This example illustrates polymeric excipient combinations which provide<br>
sustained release under both SGF and SIF conditions.<br>
Evaluation of multiple polysaccharides<br>
Drug release rates were tested for seven different polysaccharides<br>
(carrageenan, xanthan gum, sodium alginate, chitosan, HPMC, CMC-Na) combined with<br>
PAA, containing 25 wt. % Diltiazem HC1 (DI) (Figure 6). The results demonstrate that a<br>
combination of PAA with carrageenan can provide the slowest release of drug in SGF. This<br>
effect is probably due to the strong acidic nature of carrageenan functional groups (-SO4")<br>
which stay negatively charged even at low pH conditions and enable interaction between the<br>
carrageenan and a drug.<br>
Evaluation of other sulfated polymers<br>
Different types of carrageenan, as well as dextran sulfate, were used in<br>
combination with PAA or PEO at a 1:1 ratio and Diltiazem HC1 (25 wt.%) and release rate<br>
was measured in SGF and SIF. Extended release was observed for all combinations<br>
containing sulfated polymers (Figure 7).<br>
Further analysis of effect of substitution of PAA for PEO<br>
When PAA in PAA/Carrageenan (1:1) formulation is substituted by high MW<br>
PEO, release profiles for PAA/Carrageenan (1:1) and PEO/Carrageenan (1:1) formulations in<br>
SGF overlap for about 6 hours (Figure 8, a). After this time, fast matrix erosion causes faster<br>
drug release from PEO/Carrageenan matrix. In contrast, in SIF, PAA/Carrageenan<br>
formulation demonstrates slower drug release than PEO/Carrageenan formulation over the<br>
entire period of time (Figure 8, b). Therefore, combination of PAA and Carrageenan can<br>
provide the best in vitro drug release characteristics in both SGF and in SIF.<br>
Comparison of PAA/Carraseenan release rates in SIF and SGF<br>
Figure 9 demonstrates that DI (25 wt.%) release from the PAA/Carrageenan<br>
(1:1) matrix is linear in both SGF and SIF and that release rates in the two media are<br>
identical. A dissolution test for samples where the media was switched after 2 hours resulted<br>
in a linear release profile very close to the profiles in Figure 9.<br><br>
Example 7<br>
This example illustrates that the optimal polymer excipient composition is<br>
media dependent (Figure 10).<br>
For the formulation containing 25 wt.% DI, the lowest release rate in SGF was<br>
achieved with 1:1 PAA/Carrageenan composition. In SIF, release rate decreased with<br>
increasing amounts of PAA in the formulation.<br>
Interestingly, different optimal compositions were observed for a formulation<br>
with high DI content (60 wt.%). In SGF, the drug release rate decreased with an increase in<br>
carrageenan content and in SIF, the release rate was practically independent from excipient<br>
ratio (Figure 11).<br>
Based on these observations, we believe that the release behavior is most<br>
likely governed by drug/excipient complex stoichiometry in different media.<br>
Example 8<br>
This example illustrates that an increase in drug loading has an insignificant<br>
effect on the release rate in SIF for drug loading up to 60 wt %. In SGF, the increase in<br>
release rate is relatively small for drug loads up to 50 wt.% (Figure 12).<br>
Example 9<br>
This example illustrates the superior ability of the formulations of this<br>
invention to extend drug release.<br>
DI (25%) release from PAA/Carrageenan (1:1) matrix was compared with<br>
previously described formulations containing PAA and Carrageenan (Bonferoni et al., AAPS<br>

Carrageenan-containing systems described in the literature include<br>
carrageenan/HPMC and carrageenan/CMC. All matrices were prepared in the same way as<br><br>
the Viscarin 109/second polymer (1:1) mix. Formulations with the PAA/carrageenan (1:1)<br>
matrix demonstrated significantly slower DI release both in SGF and in SIF (Figure 13).<br>
An extended release system with PAA/HPMC (US Patent 4,777,033; EU<br>
Patent 0 205 336 Bl) has been described.<br>
Formulations with the PAA/carrageenan (1:1 and 3:2) matrix demonstrated<br>
significantly slower DI release than that with PAA/HPMC (1:1) as a control in SGF (Figure<br>
14), although all preparations indicated an extended drug release in SIG with a T50 of mo re<br>
than 20 h.<br>
When the amount of drug in the system is increased to 60 wt.%, the release<br>
rate from PAA/Carrageenan system remains the slowest compared to all other competitive<br>
systems (Figure 15).<br>
Example 10<br>
This example compares release rates of various drugs for the original<br>
formulation (PAA/PEO) and the new PAA/carrageenan formulations.<br>
Release rates of different drugs which previously demonstrated interaction<br>
with PAA/PEO matrix were compared to the release rates from the PAA/carrageenan (1:1)<br>
matrix. It appeared that most of the drugs show extended close to zero-order release from the<br>
PAA/carrageenan matrix. Typically, release of the drugs from PAA/carrageenan matrix was<br>
slower both in SGF and in SIF compare to the release from PAA/PEO matrix, although it was<br>
not the case for all the drugs.<br>
To illustrate, the following Table 4 sets forth T50 values (release times) in SIF.<br>
In this study, the PAA/PEO (1:1.5) formulation contained 10% of active and<br>
PAA/Carrageenan (1:1) formulation contained 25% of active.<br><br><br>
Test Method 2<br>
Dissolution test<br>
In vitro drug release was measured by in vitro dissolution experiments. These<br>
studies were carried out using The Pharmacopeia of Japan XIV(referred to "JP" hereinafter)<br>
Dissolution Test Method 2 (paddle method) at a paddle speed of 200 rpm in 900 ml<br>
dissolution medium. Drug release was evaluated with either JP Disintegration Test Fluid 1<br>
(referred to "JP 1st fluid" hereinafter), pH=1.2 or JP Disintegration Test Fluid 2 (referred to<br>
"JP 2nd fluid" hereinafter), pH=6.8. Tablet sinkers were not applied in the experiments. At<br>
predetermined time intervals, a sample was withdrawn from the vessel and assayed using a<br>
UV-VTS spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 250 nm.<br>
Gelation test<br>
Using JP 1st fluid and JP 2nd fluid, a gelation test was carried out as follows.<br>
The test tablet was moistened for 2 hours in test medium at 37°C, gel layer was removed and<br>
the core portion not forming a gel was taken out, followed by drying at 40°C for 5 days in a<br>
dryer and dried core was weighted (Wobs). The percent gelation of the formulations is<br>
calculated by means of Equation 1. The value obtained by subtracting core weight from<br>
initial tablet weight (Winitial) and dividing this by initial tablet weight is multiplied by 100 to<br>
calculate the percent gelation (G).<br>
The "percent gelation" as used herein represents the percentage of the portion<br>
of the tablet which has undergone gelation. The method of calculating the percent gelation is<br>
not particularly limited but the following method may be mentioned as an example.<br><br>
Thus, the test tablet is moistened for a predetermined time, the volume(or<br>
weight)of the portion not forming a gel is then measured and the result is subtracted from the<br>
volume(or weight)of the tablet before the beginning of the test.<br>
Percent gelation (G, %) = (1 - (Wobs-Wintial)) x 100	(Equation 1)<br>
Wobs: The weight of the portion not gelled after initiation of the test<br>
Wmitiai: The weight of the preparation before initiation of the test<br>
Example 11<br>
This example illustrates the effect of additional amount of polymers having a<br>
charge opposite that of the micelle-forming drug on drug release profiles.<br>
Different amount of PAA was used in combination with the mixture of<br>
PEO/PEG (1:1) at a 1:0 ratio (PAA wt.% to the total amount is 50), 1:1 ratio (PAA wt.% to<br>
the total amount is 25), 3:1 ratio (PAA wt.% to the total amount is 37.5), 1:3 ratio (PAA wt.%<br>
to the total amount is 12.5), or 1:9 ratio (PAA wt.% to the total amount is 5), containing 50<br>
wt.% Diltiazem HC1. The Formulation comprising PEO/PEG at a 1:1 ratio without PAA,<br>
containing 50 wt.% Diltiazem HC1 was prepared as a control. Drug release rate was evaluated<br>
in JP 2nd fluid according to the method as described in Test Method 2 (Figure 16). Extended<br>
drug release was achieved for all preparations containing PAA, even in case of containing a<br>
small amount of PAA such as 5 wt.% of total preparation. The results also demonstrated the<br>
drug release rate decreased with increasing the amount of PAA instead of mixture of<br>
PEO/PEG (1:1).<br>
The effect of additional amount of PAA and carrageenan mixture on drug<br>
release profiles was also investigated. The ratio of PAA and carrageenan, and the ratio of<br>
PEO/PEG was fixed 1:1, respectively. Different amount of PAA/carrageenan (1:1) was used<br>
in combination with the mixture of PEO/PEG (1:1) at a 1:0 ratio(both PAA and carrageenan<br>
wt.% to the total amount is 25 and 25, respectively), 3:1 ratio (both PAA and carrageenan<br>
wt.% to the total amount is 18.75 and 18.75, respectively), l:l(both PAA and carrageenan<br>
wt.% to the total amount is 12.5 and 12.5, respectively) ratio to 1:3 ratio(both PAA and<br>
carrageenan wt.% to the total amount is 6.25and 6.25, respectively), containing 50 wt.%<br>
Diltiazem HC1. (Figurel7). The Formulation comprising PEO/PEG at a 1:1 ratio without<br>
PAA/carrageenan, containing 50 wt.% Diltiazem HC1 was prepared as a control. The results<br>
also demonstrated the drug release rate decreased with increasing the amount of mixture of<br><br>
PAA/carrageenan. Therefore, drug release rate can be controlled by varying the additional<br>
amount of polymer(s) having a charge opposite that of the micelle-forming drug.<br>
Example 12<br>
This example illustrates the superior ability of the formulations of this<br>
invention to be gelled.<br>
When the gelation test of the preparations comprising PAA/carrageenan/<br>
PEO/PEG at a 1:1:0:0, 1:1:1:1 or a 1:1:3:3 ratio, containing 50 wt.% Diltiazem HCl. was<br>
performed according to the method described in Test Method 2. The percent gelation of these<br>
formulations demonstrated 75.0 %, 80.8 % and 80.7% in JP 1st fluid, respectively.<br>
In case of the preparation comprising PAA/PEO/PEG in a 1:9:9, the percent<br>
gelation demonstrated 78.0 % and 76.9 % in JP 1st fluid and JP 2nd fluid, respectively.<br>
Test Method 3<br>
Pharmacokinetic study in beasle dops<br>
Nine male beagle dogs weighing 9.3 to 13.4 kg were fasted for 18h before<br>
administration. After oral administration of the test tablet containing 200mg of Diltiazem<br>
HCl with 30 mL water, they were allowed free access to water, but food was withheld until<br>
the last blood sample had been taken. Blood samples were collected at 0.5, 1,2,3, 4,6, 8,10,<br>
12, and 24 h. after administration. Subsequently, plasma was separated by centrifugation to<br>
be applied to the quantitative analysis by HPLC system with UV detection.<br>
Example 13<br>
This example illustrates the influence of percent gelation of preparations on in<br>
vivo sustained drug release.<br>
Two preparations (Preparation A; 63.4 % and Preparation B; 77.6 % of<br>
percent gelation in JP 1st fluid) comprising different amount of PAA/PEO/PEG, both<br>
containing 200mg of Diltiazem HCl were used for pharmacokinetic study in beagle dogs. The<br>
results demonstrated that the Preparation B showed a sustained drug release in the lower<br>
digestive tract as well as in upper digestive tract, although Preparation A released little drug<br>
in the lower digestive tract.<br>
To compare in vivo drug release between two preparations in detail, the area<br>
under the drug concentration in plasma curve (AUC) from 0 to 24 hr was calculated as a<br>
function of in vivo absorbed drug amount. The results demonstrated that the AUC of<br><br>
Preparation B (7541.2 ± 2153.7 ng h/mL) was significantly higher than that of Preparation A<br>
(4346.1 ± 1811.6 ng h/mL), which confirmed in vivo insufficient drug release for the<br>
preparation with lower percent gelation.<br>
