[01]	This invention relates to imidazolin-2-ylmethyl substituted<br>
arylalkylsulfonamide derivatives, compositions comprising the same, methods for use, and methods of preparation thereof<br>
[02]	Alpha-1 (α1) adrenergic receptors (i.e., α1 adrenoceptors) are G-<br>
protein coupled transmembrane receptors that mediate various actions of the sympathetic nervous system through the binding of the catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine (NE). Currently, several subtypes of the at adrenergic receptors are known to exist for which the genes have been cloned: α1A (previously known as α1c), ΑIB and α1o. Recently the existence of a low affinity tti adrenoceptor for prazosin named α1L, in human prostate has been determined. However, the gene for the α1L adrenergic receptor subtype has yet to be cloned. The α1 adrenoceptor plays a part in the sympathetic mα1ntenance of smooth muscle tone and tti adrenergic agonists are known to increase muscle tone in the lower urinary tract (Testa, R., Eur.J.Pharmacol., 249, 307-315 (1993). Pharmacological studies resulting in the subdivision of α1 adrenergic receptors have let to the suggestion that development of subtype-selective compounds may allow improved treatment with a lower incidence of side effects.<br>
[03]	Urinary incontinence is a condition defined as the involuntary loss<br>
of urine. Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) occurs when the internal sphincter does not close completely. The primary symptom is minor leakage from activities, such as coughing, sneezing, laughing, running, lifting, or even standing, that apply pressure to a full bladder. Leakage stops when the activity stops. SUI is most common in women between the ages of 25 and 50, and many regularly exercising women have some degree of SUI.<br>
[04]	The present methods to treat SUI include physiotherapy and surgery.<br>
Treatment with pharmaceuticals is limited to the use of non-selective adrenergic agonists.<br>
[05]	Only a limited number of pharmaceutical agents have been<br>
employed, with varying success, to treat stress incontinence.<br><br>
[06]	Phenylpropanolamine, pseudoephedrine and midodrine are<br>
considered first-line therapy for mild to moderate stress incontinence (Wein, supra;<br>
Lundberg (editor), JAMA, 1989, 2(5i(l 8), 2685-2690). These agents are believed to<br>
work both by direct activation of α1 adrenoceptors and indirectly by displacement<br>
of endogenous norepinephrine from sympathetic neurons following uptake into the<br>
nerve terminal (Andersson and Sjogren, Progress in Neurobiology, 1982, 71-89).<br>
Activation of α1 adrenoceptors located on the smooth muscle cells of the proximal<br>
urethra and bladder neck (Sourander, Gerontology, 1990, 36,19-26; Wein, supra)<br>
evokes contraction and an increase in urethral closure pressure.The utility of<br>
phenylpropanolamine, pseudoephedrine, and midodrine is limited by a lack of<br>
selectivity among the α1 adrenoceptor subtypes and by the indirect action of these<br>
agents (i.e., activation of α1, aj, and p-adrenoceptors in the central nervous system<br>
and periphery). As a result, any desired therapeutic effect of these agents may be<br>
accompanied by undesirable side effects, such as an increase in blood pressure.<br>
The increase in blood pressure is dose-dependent and therefore limits the ability to<br>
achieve therapeutically effective circulating concentrations of these agents<br>
(Andersson and Sjogren, supra). Furthermore, in some patients these agents<br>
produce insomnia, anxiety and dizziness as a result of their central nervous system<br>
stimulant actions (Andersson and Sjogren, supra, Wein, supra).<br>
[07]	While some selective α1A agonists have recently been disclosed for<br>
the treatment of stress incontinence, there continues to be a need for medicaments that are useful for the treatment of incontinence. A compound having the desired α1A adrenergic agonist profile is desirable.<br>

acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like; or formed with organic acids such as acetic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, benzoic, camphorsulfonic acid, citric acid, ethanesulfonic acid, fumaric acid, glucoheptonic acid, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, glycolic acid, hydroxynaphtoic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, lactic acid, maleic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, muconic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, propionic acid, salicylic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, trimethylacetic acid, and the like; or<br>
salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound either is replaced by a metal ion, e.g., an alkali metal ion, an alkaline earth ion, or an aluminum ion; or coordinates with an organic or inorganic base. Acceptable organic bases include diethanolamine, ethanolamine, N-methylglucamine, triethanolamine, tromethamine, and the like. Acceptable inorganic bases include aluminum hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide.<br>
[47]	The preferred pharmaceutically acceptable salts are the salts formed<br>
from acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, maleic acid, phosphoric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, sodium, potassium, calcium, zinc, and magnesium.<br>
[48]	It should be understood that all references to pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts include solvent addition forms (solvates) or crystal forms<br>
(polymorphs) as defined herein, of the same acid addition salt.<br>
[49]	"Solvates" means solvent additions forms that contα1n either<br>
stoichiometric or non stoichiometric amounts of solvent. Some compounds have a tendency to trap a fixed molar ratio of solvent molecules in the crystalline solid state, thus forming a solvate. If the solvent is water the solvate formed is a hydrate, when the solvent is alcohol, the solvate formed is an alcoholate. Hydrates are formed by the combination of one or more molecules of water with one of the substances in which the water retα1ns its molecular state as H2O, such combination being able to form one or more hydrate.<br>
[50]	"Prodrug" or "pro-drug" means a pharmacologically inactive or less<br>
active form of a compound which must be metabolized in vivo, e.g., by biological<br><br>
fluids or enzymes, by a subject after administration into a pharmacologically active or more active form of the compound in order to produce the desired pharmacological effect. Prodrugs of a compound of Formula I can be prepared by modifying one or more functional group(s) present in the compound of Formula I in such a way that the modification(s) may be cleaved in vivo to release the parent compound. Prodrugs include compounds of Formula I wherein a hydroxy, amino, sulfhydryl, carboxy or carbonyl group in a compound of Fonnula I is bonded to any group that can be cleaved in vivo to regenerate the free hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, carboxy or carbonyl group respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, esters (e.g. acetate, dialkylaminoacetates, formates, phosphates, sulfates and benzoate derivatives) and carbamates of hydroxy functional groups (e.g. N,N-dimethylcarbonyl), esters of carboxyl functional groups (e.g. ethyl esters, morpholinoethanol esters), N-acyl derivatives (e.g. N-acetyl), N-Mannich bases, Schiff bases and enaminones of amino functional groups, oximes, acetals, ketals, and enol esters of ketones and aldehyde functional groups in compounds of Formula I, and the like.<br>
[51]	The prodrug can be metabolized before absorption, during<br>
absorption, after absorption, or at a specific site. Although metabolism occurs for many compounds primarily in the liver, almost all other tissues and organs, especially the lung, are able to carry out varying degrees of metabolism. Prodrug forms of compounds may be utilized, for example, to improve bioavα1lability, improve subject acceptability such as by masking or reducing unpleasant characteristics such as bitter taste or gastrointestinal irritability, alter solubility such as for intravenous use, provide for prolonged or sustα1ned release or delivery, improve ease of formulation, or provide site-specific delivery of the compound. Reference to a compound herein includes prodrug forms of a compound. Prodrugs are described in The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action, by Richard B. Silverman, Academic Press, San Diego, 1992. Chapter 8: "Prodrugs and Drug delivery Systems" pp. 352-401; Design of Prodrugs, edited by H.

Compounds of the present invention can be made by a variety of methods depicted<br>
in the illustrative synthetic reaction schemes shown and described below.<br>
[83]	The starting materials and reagents used in preparing these<br>
compounds generally are either avα1lable from commercial suppliers, such as Aldrich Chemical Co., or are prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art following procedures set forth in references such as Fieser andFieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis; Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1991, Volumes 1-15; Rodd's Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Elsevier Science Publishers, 1989, Volumes 1-5 and Supplementals; and Organic Reactions, Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1991, Volumes 1-40. The following synthetic reaction schemes are merely illustrative of some methods by which the compounds of the present invention can be synthesized, and various modifications to these synthetic reaction schemes can be made and will be suggested to one skilled in the art having referred to the disclosure contα1ned in this Application.<br>
[84]	The starting materials and the intermediates of the synthetic reaction<br>
schemes can be isolated and purified if desired using conventional techniques, including but not limited to, filtration, distillation, crystallization, chromatography, and the like. Such materials can be characterized using conventional means, including physical constants and spectral data.<br>
[85]	Unless specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein<br>
preferably are conducted under an inert atmosphere at atmospheric pressure at a reaction temperature range of from about -78 °C to about 150 °C, more preferably from about 0 °C to about 125 "C, and most preferably and conveniently at about room (or ambient) temperature, e.g., 2'^out 20 °C.<br><br>
[86]	In one embodiment, Compounds of Formula I are prepared by<br>
reacting a nitrile compound of the formula:<br><br>
with ethylene diamine (i.e., H2N-CH2-CH2-NH2) to produce the imidazolin-2-ylmethyl-substituted aromatic compound of Formula I.<br>
[87]	Formation of the imidazoline moiety can be achieved using a variety<br>
of reaction conditions. In one embodiment, the nitrile Compound of Formula II is dissolved or suspended in a protic organic solvent, such as an alcohol (e.g., anhydrous ethanol), and an acid, e.g., hydrogen chloride gas, is added. Typically, the addition of acid is conducted at about 0 °C to about 5 °C. The reaction mixture is then kept at the low temperature for about 10 hours to about 48 hours, preferably about 24 hours, after which the reaction mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue, which is typically a solid, is re-dissolved in an anhydrous protic solvent, e.g., methanol, and ethylene diamine added to the solution. Typically, about 1 equivalent to a slight excess, e.g., 1.2 equivalents, of ethylene diamine is added. The resulting reaction mixture is then heated to reflux. The reaction time varies depending on a variety of factors, such as concentration of each reagents, exact nature of the reagents, etc. Typically, however, the reaction mixture is heated for from about 10 hours to about 48 hours, preferably for about 24 hours, to afford the imidazolin-2-ylmethyl substituted arylalkylsulfonamide of Formula I.<br>
[88]	Alternatively, the imidazoline moiety can be formed by<br>
micro waving a mixture of the nitrile Compound of Formula II, ethylene diamine, and a small amount of carbon disulfide. For example, using a Smith creator^'^ microwave reaction apparatus. In this embodiment, typically ethylene diamine serves both as a solvent and a reagent. Thus, generally an excess amount of ethylene diamine is used, e.g., from about 10 to about 50 equivalents or more. Typical microwave temperature is from about 100 °C to about 250 °C, preferably about 130 °C to about 170 °C, and more preferably about 140 "C. The reaction time<br><br>
can vary depending on a variety of factors, such as those mentioned above. However, typical reaction time is from about 10 minutes to about 60 minutes, preferably about 20 minutes to about 40 minutes, and more preferably about 30 minutes.<br>
[89]	The nitrile Compound of Formula II can be readily prepared from a<br>
variety of starting materials. In one particular embodiment, the nitrile Compound of Formula II is synthesized from a reaction between a corresponding benzaldehyde of the formula:<br><br>
and an isocyanide. Suitable isocyanides for the conversion of the aldehyde functional group to a nitrile group include tosylmethyl isocyanide (TosMIC) and other isocyanides known to one skilled in the art. The reaction generally involves adding the isocyanide to a base, e.g., a hydroxide or an alkoxide, such as potassium tert-butoxide, at a low temperature. The reaction temperature is generally kept at from about -78 °C to about -20 °C, preferably from about -65 °C to about -60 °C. Conventionally, an excess amount of the base is used, typically about 2 equivalents to about 5 equivalents, preferably about 2.5 equivalents. The reaction between the base and the isocyanide is conveniently carried out in an inert organic solvent, such as ether, e.g., ethylene glycol dimethyl ether.<br>
[90]	After reacting the isocyanide with the base, the benzaldehyde of<br>
Formula III is added to the reaction mixture to produce the nitrile Compound of Formula II. This stage of the reaction often involves stirring the reaction mixture at a low temperature, typically about -60 °C or less, for about an hour and adding a protic solvent, such as methanol. The resulting mixture is then heated to reflux for from about 10 minutes to 60 minutes, preferably about 20 minutes, and ftirther stirred at room temperature for additional about 10 to 20 hours, typically about 16 hours.<br><br>
[91]	The benzaldehyde of Formula III can be readily obtα1ned using a<br>
variety of synthetic methods including those shown in Scheme I below and in the Examples section.<br><br>
Scheme I<br>
[92]	As shown in Scheme I, the ester I-l, which is commercially<br>
avα1lable or can be readily obtα1ned from a commercially avα1lable material, is sulfonylated with an activated sulfonyl compound, e.g., alkylsulfonyl chloride, to produce a sulfonamide 1-2. Typically, this sulfonylation reaction involves adding a sulfonyl chloride to a solution of the ester I-l in an inert organic solvent, e.g., dichloromethane, at room temperature or lower.<br>
[93]	The ester group of the sulfonamide 1-2 is then reduced with a<br>
reducing agent to produce an alcohol 1-3. Suitable reducing agents and reaction<br>
conditions for producing the benzyl alcohol 1-3 are well known to one skilled in the<br>
art. For example, one embodiment involves adding diisobutylaluminum hydride<br>
(DIBAL) to a 0 °C solution of the sulfonamide 1-2 in tetrahydrofiiran (THF).<br>
[94]	Oxidation of the benzyl alcohol 1-3 then affords the benzaldehyde of<br>
Formula III. Suitable oxidizing agents and reaction conditions for producing the<br>
benzaldehyde of Formula III are well known to one skilled in the art. For example,<br>
the benzyl alcohol 1-3 can be oxidized using pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) in<br>
dichloromethane at room temperature to produce the benzaldehyde of Formula III.<br>
[95]	Other methods for producing the nitrile Compound of Formula II<br>
include those shown in Scheme II below and in the Examples section.<br><br><br>
[96]	In this embodiment, the nitrile group is introduced prior to<br>
converting the nitro group to a sulfonamido group. A benzyl alcohol II-1 is<br>
commercially avα1lable or can be readily synthesized from a commercially<br>
avα1lable corresponding ester or a carboxylic acid by reduction. Such reduction<br>
conditions are similar to those described above in Scheme I for the reduction of the<br>
ester group of the sulfonamide of Formula 1-2. The benzyl alcohol II-1 is then<br>
oxidized, for example, using an oxidizing agent and reaction conditions similar to<br>
those described above in Scheme I for oxidizing the benzyl alcohol of Formula 1-3.<br>
The benzaldehyde of Formula II-2 is then converted to a benzyl nitrile of Formula<br>
II-3 using conditions similar to those described above for transformation of the<br>
benzaldehyde of Formula III to the nitrile Compound of Formula II.<br>
[97]	The nitro group of benzyl nitrile of Formula II-3 is then reduced to<br>
provide an aniline of Formula II-4. Reduction of a nitro group on an aromatic ring is well known to one skilled in the art. For example, the nitro group of benzyl nitrile of Formula II-3 can be reduced by hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst. Suitable hydrogenation catalyst include a variety of well known transition metal catalysts, including palladium on carbon catalyst. Typically, the hydrogenation reaction is conducted in an alcoholic solvent, e.g., methanol or ethanol, under elevated pressure, e.g., about 45 psi. The nitro group can also be converted to an amino group using a reducing agent, such as stannous chloride (SnCb) and other nitro group reducing agents known to one skilled in the art. The aniline of Formula II-4 is then sulfonylated to produce the nitrile Compound of Formula II. The sulfonylation reaction conditions are similar to those described above in Scheme I for the conversion of the ester of Formula I-l to the sulfonamide of Formula 1-2.<br>
[98]	Still other methods for producing the nitrile Compound of Formula<br>
II include those shown in Scheme III below and in the Examples section.<br><br><br>
[99]	In this embodiment, a reaction between the nitrophenyl compound<br>
of Formula III-l and an acetonitrile derivative provides a nitrobenzonitrile<br>
compound of Formula III-2. Suitable acetonitrile derivatives include<br>
phenylthioacetonitrile, chloroacetonitrile, thiomethylacetonitrile,<br>
phenoxyacetonitrile, phenylsulfonyl acetonitrile, methylsulfonyl acetonitrile,<br>
dimethyldithiocarbamoyl acetonitrile, and other acetonitrile derivatives known to<br>
one skilled in the art. See, for example, Winiarski, J. Org. Chem., 1980, 45,1534<br>
and Winiarski, J^ Org. Chem., 1984, 49, 1494, both of which are incorporated<br>
herein be reference in their entirety. Typically, a mixture of the nitrophenyl<br>
compound of Formula III-l and the acetonitrile derivative is added to a suspension<br>
of a base, e.g., a hydroxide or an alkoxide, in a relatively polar organic solvent,<br>
such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The reaction temperature is generally<br>
mα1ntα1ned at below 40 °C, preferably below 30 °C. While the reaction time can<br>
vary depending on many factors, including the concentration, reaction temperature,<br>
substituents on the phenyl ring, etc., generally the reaction time ranges from about<br>
30 minutes to about 5 hours, preferably about 1 hour, at room temperature. The<br>
nitrobenzonitrile compound of Formula III-2 is then converted to the nitrile<br>
Compound of Formula II using procedures similar to those described in Scheme II.<br>
[100]	In another embodiment. Compounds of Formula I can be produced<br>
from a reaction between an ester compound of the formula:<br><br>
with ethylene diamine in the presence of a trialkylaluminum, such as<br>
trimethylaluminum and triethylaluminum. See, for example, Gunter, J. Org.<br>
Chem., 1981, 46, 2824, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[101]	The ester Compound of Formula IV can be prepared by a variety of<br>
methods. In one particular embodiment, the ester Compound of Formula IV is produced using methods shown in Scheme IV below and discussed in detα1l in the Examples section.<br><br><br>
[102]	Thus, nitration of the ester IV-1 under conventional aromatic<br>
nitration conditions provides nitre-ester compound of Formula IV-2. The nitro group is then reduced and sulfonylated using conditions similar to those described above to produce the ester Compound of Formula IV.<br>
[103]	The amino group or the sulfonamido group in any of the appropriate<br>
intermediates described above can be alkylated to produce the corresponding Compound of Formula I, where R^ is alkyl. Such an alkylation can be carried out neat at about 0 °C to about 25 °C, typically at about 10 °C to about 150 °C, and preferably at about 20 °C to about 60 °C. While the alkylation reaction time varies depending on a various factors discussed above, the alkylation reaction time is generally from about 1 to about 24 hours.<br>
[104]	The alkylation is typically carried out in a suitable inert organic<br>
solvent (e.g., acetonitrile, methylsulfoxide (DMSO), N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N-methylpyrrolidione (NMP), benzene, toluene, any appropriate mixture of suitable solvents, etc., preferably acetonitrile or DMSO) in the presence of a base. Suitable bases for alkylation are well known to one skilled in the art and include, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate, 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine, triethylamine, N, N-diisopropylethylamine, and sodium hydride, etc. Preferably, the base is sodium carbonate, triethylamine, or N, N-diisopropylethylamine.<br><br>
[105]	The compounds of the present invention have selective ajA- or OIL-<br>
adrenergic activity and as such are useful in the treatment of various disease states, such as urinary incontinence; nasal congestion; sexual dysfunction, such as ejaculation disorders and priapism; CNS disorders such as depression, anxiety, dementia, senility, Alzheimer's, deficiencies in attentiveness and cognition, and eating disorders such as obesity, bulimia, and anorexia.<br>
[106]	Urinary incontinence (UI) is a condition defined as the involuntary<br>
loss of urine to such an extent as to become a hygienic or social concern to the<br>
patient. Involuntary loss of urine occurs when pressure inside the bladder exceeds<br>
retentive pressure of the urethral sphincters (intraurethral pressure). Four major<br>
types of urinary incontinence have been defined based on symptoms, signs and<br>
condition: stress, urge, overflow and functional incontinence.<br>
[107]	Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is the involuntary loss of urine<br>
during coughing, sneezing, laughing, or other physical activities. The present<br>
methods to treat SUI include physiotherapy and surgery. Treatment with<br>
pharmaceutical agents is limited to the use of non selective-adrenergic agonists like<br>
phenylproanolamine and midodrine. The rationale for the use of adrenergic<br>
agonists for the treatment of SUI is based on physiological data indicating an<br>
abundant noradrenergic input to smooth muscle of the urethra.<br>
[108]	Urge incontinence (detrusor instability) is the involuntary loss of<br>
urine associated with a strong urge to void. This type of incontinence is the result of either an overactive or hypersensitive detrusor muscle. The patient with detrusor overactivity experiences inappropriate detrusor contractions and increases in intravesical pressure during bladder filling. Detrusor instability resulting from a hypersensitive detrusor (detrusor hyperreflexia) is most often associated with a neurological disorder.<br>
[109]	Overflow incontinence is an involuntary loss of urine resulting from<br>
a weak detrusor or from the fα1lure of the detrusor to transmit appropriate signals (sensory) when the bladder is full. Overflow incontinent episodes are characterized by frequent or continuous dribbling of urine and incomplete or unsuccessful voiding.<br>
[110]	Functional incontinence, in contrast to the types of incontinence<br>
described above, is not defined by an underlying physiological dysfunction in the<br><br>
bladder or urethra. This type of incontinence includes the involuntary loss of urine resulting from such factors as decreased mobility, medications (e.g., diuretics, muscarinic agents, or alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonists), or psychiatric problems such as depression or cognitive impα1rment.<br>
[Ill]	The compounds of this invention are also particularly useful for the<br>
treatment of nasal congestion associated with allergies, colds, and other nasal<br>
disorders, as well as the sequelae of congestion of the mucous membranes (for<br>
example, sinusitis and otitis media), with less or no undesired side effects.<br>
[112]	These and other therapeutic uses are described, for example, in<br>
Goodman &amp; Gilman 's, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, ninth edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1996, Chapter 26:601-616; and Coleman, R.A., Pharmacological Reviews, 1994, 46:205-229.<br>
[113]	The activity of potential OIAA. activity in vitro was determined by<br>
evaluating the potency and relative intrinsic activity (relative to norepinephrine or phenylephrine) of standard and novel compounds using fluorescent dye determination of intracellular calcium concentrations.<br>
[114]	Standard and novel compounds which selectively stimulated CHO-<br>
Kl cells expressing the α1A-adrenoceptor (clone 13) were subsequently evaluated<br>
in vivo in anesthetized female rabbits to assess urethral activity relative to diastolic<br>
blood pressure effects. Compounds with the desired activity in anesthetized rabbits<br>
were evaluated in conscious female rabbits instrumented with telemetry to measure<br>
diastolic blood pressure and a strα1n-gage transducer to measure urethral tension.<br>
[115]	Another aspect of the present invention provides a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising a compound as defined above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can also include other therapeutic and/or prophylactic ingredients.<br>
[116]	In general, the compounds of the present invention are administered<br>
in a therapeutically effective amount by any of the accepted modes of administration for agents that serve similar utilities. Suitable dosage ranges are typically 1-500 mg dα1ly, preferably 1-100 mg dα1ly, and most preferably 1-30 mg dα1ly, depending upon numerous factors such as the severity of the disease to be treated, the age and relative health of the subject, the potency of the compound used, the route and form of administration, the indication towards which the<br><br>
administration is directed, and the preferences and experience of the medical<br>
practitioner involved. One of ordinary skill in the art of treating such diseases will<br>
be able, without undue experimentation and in reliance upon personal knowledge<br>
and the disclosure of this application, to ascertα1n a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of the compounds of the present invention for a given disease.<br>
[117]	In general, compounds of the present invention will be administered<br>
as pharmaceutical formulations including those suitable for oral (including buccal<br>
and sub-lingual), rectal, nasal, topical, pulmonary, vaginal, or parenteral (including<br>
intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, subcutaneous and intravenous)<br>
administration or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation.<br>
The preferred manner of administration is generally oral using a convenient dα1ly<br>
dosage regimen which can be adjusted according to the degree of affliction.<br>
[118]	A compound or compounds of the present invention, together with<br>
one or more conventional adjuvants, carriers, or diluents, may be placed into the form of pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosages. The pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosage forms may be comprised of conventional ingredients in conventional proportions, with or without additional active compounds or principles, and the unit dosage forms may contα1n any suitable effective amount of the active ingredient commensurate with the intended dα1ly dosage range to be employed. The pharmaceutical compositions may be employed as solids, such as tablets or filled capsules, semisolids, powders, sustα1ned release formulations, or liquids such as solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, or filled capsules for oral use; or in the form of suppositories for rectal or vaginal administration; or in the form of sterile injectable solutions for parenteral use. Formulations contα1ning about one (1) milligram of active ingredient or, more broadly, about 0.01 to about one hundred (100) milligrams, per tablet, are accordingly suitable representative unit dosage forms.<br>
[119]	The compounds of the present invention may be formulated in a<br>
wide variety of oral administration dosage forms. The pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms may comprise a compound or compounds of the present invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof as the active component. The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets.<br><br>
supposiTones, ana α1spersible granules. A solid carrier may be one or more<br>
substances which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants,<br>
suspending agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an<br>
encapsulating material. In powders, the carrier generally is a finely divided solid<br>
which is a mixture with the finely divided active component. In tablets, the active<br>
component generally is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding<br>
capacity in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. The<br>
powders and tablets preferably contα1n from about one (1) to about seventy (70)<br>
percent of the active compound. Suitable carriers include but are not limited to<br>
magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin,<br>
starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low<br>
melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term "preparation" is intended to<br>
include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as<br>
carrier, providing a capsule in which the active component, with or without<br>
carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is in association with it. Similarly,<br>
cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and<br>
lozenges may be as solid forms suitable for oral administration.<br>
[120]	Other forms suitable for oral administration include liquid form<br>
preparations including emulsions, syrups, elixirs, aqueous solutions, aqueous<br>
suspensions, or solid form preparations which are intended to be converted shortly<br>
before use to liquid form preparations.   Emulsions may be prepared in solutions,<br>
for example, in aqueous propylene glycol solutions or may contα1n emulsifying<br>
agents, for example, such as lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia. Aqueous<br>
solutions can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding<br>
suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizing, and thickening agents. Aqueous suspensions<br>
can be prepared by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with<br>
viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, and other well known suspending agents. Solid form<br>
preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, and may contα1n, in<br>
addition to the active component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial<br>
and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like.<br>
[121]	The compounds of the present invention may be formulated for<br>
parenteral administration (e.g., by injection, for example bolus injection or<br><br>
continuous infusion) and may be presented in unit dose form in ampoules, pre-<br>
fiUed syringes, small volume infusion or in multi-dose contα1ners with an added<br>
preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or<br>
emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, for example solutions in aqueous<br>
polyethylene glycol. Examples of oily or nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or<br>
vehicles include propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils (e.g., olive<br>
oil), and injectable organic esters (e.g., ethyl oleate), and may contα1n formulatory<br>
agents such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying or suspending, stabilizing and/or<br>
dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form,<br>
obtα1ned by aseptic isolation of sterile solid or by lyophilization from solution for<br>
constitution before use with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile, pyrogen-free water.<br>
[122]	The compounds of the present invention may be formulated for<br>
topical administration to the epidermis as ointments, creams or lotions, or as a<br>
transdermal patch. Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an<br>
aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents.<br>
Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also<br>
contα1ning one or more emulsifying agents, stabilizing agents, dispersing agents,<br>
suspending agents, thickening agents, or coloring agents. Formulations suitable for<br>
topical administration in the moiith include lozenges comprising active agents in a<br>
flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the<br>
active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia;<br>
and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
[123]	The compounds of the present invention may be formulated for<br>
administration as suppositories. A low melting wax, such as a mixture of fatty acid<br>
glycerides or cocoa butter is first melted and the active component is dispersed<br>
homogeneously, for example, by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is<br>
then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool, and to solidify.<br>
[124]	The compounds of the present invention may be formulated for<br>
vaginal administration. Pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or sprays contα1ning in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
[125]	The compounds of the present invention may be formulated for<br>
nasal administration. The solutions or suspensions are applied directly to the nasal<br><br>
cavity by conventional means, for example, with a dropper, pipette or spray. The formulations may be provided in a single or multidose form. In the latter case of a dropper or pipette, this may be achieved by the patient administering an appropriate, predetermined volume of the solution or suspension. In the case of a spray, this may be achieved for example by means of a metering atomizing spray pump.<br>
[126]	The compounds of the present invention may be formulated for<br>
aerosol administration, particularly to the respiratory tract and including intranasal administration. The compound will generally have a small particle size for example of the order of five (5) microns or less. Such a particle size may be obtα1ned by means known in the art, for example by micronization. The active ingredient is provided in a pressurized pack with a suitable propellant such as a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), for example, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, or dichlorotetrafluoroethane, or carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. The aerosol may conveniently also contα1n a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of drug may be controlled by a metered valve. Alternatively the active ingredients may be provided in a form of a dry powder, for example a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch, starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidine (PVP). The powder carrier will form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composition may be presented in unit dose form for example in capsules or cartridges of e.g., gelatin or blister packs from which the powder may be administered by means of an inhaler.<br>
[127]	When desired, formulations can be prepared with enteric coatings<br>
adapted for sustα1ned or controlled release administration of the active ingredient. For example, the compounds of the present invention can be formulated in transdermal or subcutaneous drug delivery devices. These delivery systems are advantageous when sustα1ned release of the compound is necessary and when patient compliance with a treatment regimen is crucial. Compounds in transdermal delivery systems are frequently attached to an skin-adhesive solid support. The compound of interest can also be combined with a penetration enhancer, e.g., Azone (l-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one). Sustα1ned release delivery systems are inserted subcutaneously into to the subdermal layer by surgery or injection. The<br><br>
subdermal implants encapsulate the compound in a lipid soluble membrane, e.g.,<br>
silicone rubber, or a biodegradable polymer, e.g., polyactic acid.<br>
[128]	The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage<br>
forms. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses contα1ning appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package contα1ning discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.<br>
[129]	Other suitable pharmaceutical carriers and their formulations are<br>
described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 1995, edited by E.  -W. Martin, Mack Publishing Company, 19th edition, Easton, Pennsylvania. Representative pharmaceutical formulations contα1ning a compound of the present invention are described in Example 5.<br>

Example 6<br>
[184]	This example illustrates a functional assay which can be used to<br>
determine α1A/L agonist activity of Compounds of Formula I.<br>
[185]	The activity of compounds of this invention in vitro was examined<br>
using fluorescent dye determination of intracellular calcium concentrations.<br>
Fluo-3 loaded cell preparation:<br>
[186]	Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO-Kl expressing the alpha lA<br>
adrenoceptors (clone 13) are washed 4 times (approx. 300 µL/well) with<br>
fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR) buffer (Hank's buffered saline solution<br>
(HBSS), 2 mM CaCb, 10 mM HEPES, 2,5 mM probenecid, 100 µM ascorbic<br>
acid), with a final volume of 150µL/well. Cells are loaded with 50 µL/well of 8<br>
(iM Fluo-3 AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), for a final concentration of 2 µM"<br><br>
FIuo-3 AM. Cells are then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Following dye loading, cells are washed 4 times (approx. 300 µL/well) with FLIPR buffer with a final volume of 150 µL/well. Agonist Assay<br>
[187]	Test compound, control compound and reference compound are run<br>
in quadruplicate, 8-point curves on each plate with a final assay concentration<br>
range of 10"^ M to 10"" M for each compound. All compounds are dissolved in<br>
DMSO at 10 mM, and serially diluted in FLIPR buffer.<br>
[188]	The assay plate is placed in the FLIPR incubation chamber and a<br>
baseline fluorescence measurement (excitation @ 488 nm and emission @ 510-570 nm) is obtα1ned (15 sec interval). An experimental run is then commenced. The reaction is started with the addition of 50 µ-L/well (at 4x final concentration) of test, control, or reference compound solution from the agonist plate to the assay plate to all 96 wells simultaneously. Fluorescence is measured for 120 sec at 1 sec intervals. Then, a second addition of 5 µM ionomycin (50 µL/well from 5 x concentration ionomycin plate) is added to the assay plate. Fluorescence is measured for 30 sec at 1 sec intervals. All experiments are conducted at room temperature. Measurements<br>
[189]	For each assay plate, responses (increase in peak fliuorescence) in<br>
each well following addition of agonist (test, control and reference) are determined. These responses may be expressed as raw CFU (Corrected Fluorescence Units), as a % maximum ionomycin response or other unit as determined by the investigator. Statistics<br>
[190]	For test compound, control compound (Norepinephrine (NE)<br>
bitartrate), and reference compound, the concentration producing a 50% increase in control response (EC50) is determined using iterative curve-fitting methods. Excel spreadsheet or Kaleidagraph software are used to fit data to the general logistic function (E = B + Emax ' AnH / AnH + EC50""), where B is the corrected baseline fluorescence units (defined as zero), A is the concentration of agonist added and nH is the Hill slope (constrα1ned to imity). EC50 values and maxima (Emax) for each curve can be estimated objectively using this software.<br><br>
[191]	In addition, the intrinsic activity (a) is determined. Intrinsic activity<br>
is defined as the maximum response to test agonist divided by the maximum<br>
response to a full agonist acting through the same receptor. For these experiments,<br>
the full agonist is defined as Norepinephrine (NE) bitartrate (control).<br>
[192]	As used herein an agonist is a compound that elicits a maximal<br>
response greater than 50% of that of norepinephrine with apEC5o&gt;5.5.<br>

[194]	This example illustrates an assay for determining α1A/L-adrenoceptor<br>
activity of Compounds of Formula I.<br>
[195]	Compounds used in this example were from Sigma Chemical Co.,<br>
St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) unless specified otherwise.<br>
In Vitro<br><br>
[196]	Male white New Zealand rabbits (3-3.5 kg) and Sprague-Dawley<br>
rats (250-400 g) were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation. The bladder (rabbit) or aorta (rat) were removed, extraneous tissue was dissected away, and tissues were placed in oxygenated Krebs' solution (mM: NaCl, 118.5; NaHCOa, 25; dextrose, 5: KCl, 4.8; CaCl2, 2.5; MgS04,1.2 and KH2PO4,1.2). Cocα1ne (30 ^M), corticosterone (30 |iM), ascorbic acid (100 ^M), indomethacin (10 |aM) and propranolol (1 |iM) were added to the Krebs' solution to block neuronal uptake, extraneuronal uptake, auto-oxidation of catecholamines, prostanoid synthesis, beta-adrenoceptors, respectively. The a2-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (0.3 |iM, Research Biochemicals, Inc., Natick, MA, U.S.A.) and the calcium channel antagonist nitrendipine (1 [iM, Research Biochemico International, Natick, MA, U.S.A.) were added the Krebs' solution for rabbit and rat experiments, respectively. Strips of bladder neck (rabbit) approximately 0.8-1.2 cm in length and 2-3 mm in width and aortic rings (2-4 per rat) approximately 3 mm in width, cut as near the heart as possible, were suspended in water-jacketed tissue baths at a resting tension of 1. Tissues were mα1ntα1ned at 34 °C and bubbled continuously with an oxygen/carbon dioxide mixture.<br>
[197]	Tissues were primed with norepinephrine (10 |iM) and washed for<br>
60 minutes before constructing a first cumulative concentration-effect to norepinephrine. Tissues were then washed for 60 minutes before constructing a second concentration-effect curve to a test agonist. The concentration producing the half maximal response (pECso) and the intrinsic activity (relative to norepinephrine) were recorded. Results for standards and representative compounds of the present invention were determined. Representative compounds of the invention showed activity in this assay.<br>
Example 8<br>
[198]	This example illustrates lUP and MAP Experimental Protocol.<br>
[199]	In preparation for surgery, Dutch Belted rabbits were anesthetized,<br>
shaved and administered hydration fluids. The femoral vein and artery were then isolated and cannulated for the administration of test compounds and the measurement of blood pressure, respectively. Following laparotomy, the ureters were isolated, cannulated and exteriorized. The urethra was isolated and<br><br>
catheterized with a balloon tipped urethral catheter (PE-100 tubing), with the<br>
balloon being placed at a level just proximal to the pubic bone.<br>
[200]	Following a recovery period, animals were instrumented with Gould<br>
pressure transducers (P23XL) connected to an ADInstruments PowerLab data acquisition system. After a 60-minute stabilization period, the positive control amidephrine (316 )ig/kg, 1 ml/kg, in saline,) was administered intravenously (i.v.). One hundred and twenty minutes later, Compounds of Formula I (0.001-3 mg/kg, 1 ml/kg, in 5% DMSO, i.v.) were administered. Doses were given at 15-minute intervals or after baseline were re-established. At the end of the experiment, the rabbits were euthanized by an overdose of pentobarbital sodium (i.v.). All procedures were carried out after approval by the Roche Bioscience Institutional animal Care and use Conmiittee.<br>
[201]	Baseline intraurethral pressure (lUP) and mean arterial pressure<br>
(MAP) were calculated as the mean of the time period occurring 30 seconds before each dose of vehicle or test compound was administered. Compound effect was calculated as the mean of the time period occurring 20 seconds after vehicle or test compound was administered (post dose value). lUP and MAP changes induced by the test compounds were calculated by subtracting their respective baseline values from the post-dose values.<br>
[202]	For statistical analysis, the treatment groups were compared with<br>
respect to lUP or MAP, by analysis of variance. Pα1rwise comparisons of the treatment groups to the vehicle groups were made using Fisher's LSD test with Bonferroni's adjustment, if the overall difference was not significant. To estimate the ED50, the % positive control was first calculated for each animal, then the ED50 for the test compound was estimated by fitting a sigmoidal model to the % positive control data.<br><br><br>
