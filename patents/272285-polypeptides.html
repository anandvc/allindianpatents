				<td>The invention relates to antigenic polypeptides expressed by pathogenic microbes,<br>
vaccines comprising the antigenic polypeptides and therapeutic antibodies directed to the<br>
antigenic polypeptides.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
A problem facing current medical development is the evolution of antibiotic resistant<br>
strains of a number of significant pathogenic microbes. An example of a pathogenic<br>
organism which has developed resistance to antibiotics is Staphylococcus aureus.<br>
Saureus is a bacterium whose normal habitat is the epithelial lining of the nose in about<br>
20-40% of normal healthy people and is also commonly found on people's skin usually<br>
without causing harm. However, in certain circumstances, particularly when skin is<br>
damaged, this germ can cause infection. This is a particular problem in hospitals where<br>
patients may have surgical procedures and/or be taking immunosuppressive drugs. These<br>
patients are much more vulnerable to infection with S.aureus because of the treatment they<br>
have received. Resistant strains of S.aureus have arisen in recent years. Methicillin<br>
resistant strains are prevalent and many of these resistant strains are also resistant to<br>
several other antibiotics. Currently there is no effective vaccination procedure for S.<br>
aureus.<br>
The present invention is concerned with the identification of potential vaccine components<br>
and therapies against which the problem of directly resistant pathogen strains is avoided or<br>
reduced.<br>
Amongst the approximately 4100 genes in the soil gram-positive bacterium Bacillus<br>
subtilis chromosome, 271 are indispensable ("essential") for growth and among them, 23<br>
have undefined roles in the physiology of the organism (gcp, obg,ppaC-yybQ-, trmU,<br>
yacA, yacM, ydiB, ydiC, yjbN, ykqC, ylaN, yloQ, ylqF, ymdA, yneS, yphC, yqeH, yqel,<br>
yqjK, yrvO, ysxC, ytaG, ywlC) (Kunst et al. 1997) . Homologs of the proteins encoded by<br>
these genes can be found in the various strains sequenced thus far of another gram-positive<br>
bacterium, the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. Amongst them, the Gcp and YneS<br>
orthologs are predicted membrane proteins (See Appendix I), while the rest are predicted<br>
2<br>
 <br>
cytoplasmic proteins (data not shown). Nonetheless, Obg has been shown to be partially<br>
bound to membranes in B. subtilis (Kobayashi et al. 2001).<br>
The inventors have isolated certain polypeptides that are essential components for growth<br>
of the pathogens Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus and have raised antisera<br>
against these polypeptides. Antisera raised against the Bacillus subtilis polypeptides was<br>
found to result in extremely potent killing of Staphylococcus aureus. This effect could not<br>
have been predicted.<br>
The present findings facilitate the development of vaccines and antibody therapies that<br>
mitigate some of the problems of current therapies such as antibiotic resistance.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
The present invention provides antigenic polypeptides that are essential for growth of the<br>
gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus and which are useful in<br>
the treatment or prevention of microbial infections.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided an antigenic polypeptide, or<br>
part thereof, encoded by an isolated nucleic acid sequence selected from the group<br>
consisting of:<br>
i)	a nucleic acid sequence as shown in Figures 1 to 6;<br>
ii) a nucleic acid sequence as in (i) which encodes a polypeptide expressed by<br>
a pathogenic organism;<br>
iii) a nucleic acid sequence which hybridises to the sequence identified in (i) or<br>
(ii) above; and<br>
iv) a nucleic acid sequence that is degenerate as a result of the genetic code to<br>
the nucleic acid sequence defined in (i), (ii) or (iii)<br>
for use as a medicament.<br>
In a preferred aspect of the invention the medicament is a vaccine.<br>
3<br>
 <br>
The nucleic acid encoding the antigenic polypeptide of the first aspect of the invention<br>
may anneal under stringent hybridisation conditions to the nucleic acid sequence shown in<br>
Figures 1 to 6 or to its complementary strand.<br>
Stringent hybridisation/washing conditions are well known in the art. For example,<br>
nucleic acid hybrids that are stable after washing in O.lxSSC, 0.1% SDS at 60°C. It is well<br>
known in the art that optimal hybridisation conditions can be calculated if the sequences of<br>
the nucleic acid is known. For example, hybridisation conditions can be determined by the<br>
GC content of the nucleic acid subject to hybridisation. Please see Sambrook et al (1989)<br>
Molecular Cloning; A Laboratory Approach. A common formula for calculating the<br>
stringency conditions required to achieve hybridisation between nucleic acid molecules of<br>
a specified homology is:<br>
Tm = 81.5° C + 16.6 Log [Na+] + 0.41 [ % G + C] -0.63 (%formamide).<br>
The nucleic acid encoding the antigenic polypeptide of the first aspect of the invention<br>
may comprise the sequence set out in Figures 1 to 6 or a sequence which is at least 60%,<br>
65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, for example 98%, or 99%, identical to the nucleic<br>
acid sequence set out in Figures 1 to 6 at the nucleic acid residue level.<br>
"Identity", as known in the art, is the relationship between two or more polypeptide<br>
sequences or two or more polynucleotide sequences, as determined by comparing the<br>
sequences. In the art, identity also means the degree of sequence relatedness between<br>
polypeptide or polynucleotide sequences, as the case may be, as determined by the match<br>
between strings of such sequences. Identity can be readily calculated {Computational<br>

Devereux, J., eds., M Stockton Press, New York, 1991). While there exist a number of<br>
methods to measure identity between two polynucleotide or two polypeptide sequences,<br>
the term is well-known to skilled artisans {Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von<br>

Devereux, J., eds., M Stockton Press, New York, 1991; and Carillo, H., and Lipman, D.,<br>
SIAM J. Applied Math., 48: 1073 (1988). Methods commonly employed to determine<br>
identity between sequences include, but are not limited to those disclosed in Carillo, H.,<br>
and Lipman, D., SIAM J. Applied Math., 48: 1073 (1988). Preferred methods to determine<br>
identity are designed to give the largest match between the sequences tested. Methods to<br>
determine identity are codified in computer programs. Preferred computer program<br>
methods to determine identity between two sequences include, but are not limited to, GCG<br>
program package (Devereux, J., et al., Nucleid Acids Research 12(1): 387 (1984)),<br>
BLASTP, BLASTN, and FASTA (Atschul, S.F. et al., J. Molec. Biol. 215: 403 (1990)).<br>
The nucleic acid encoding the antigenic polypeptide of the first aspect of the invention<br>
may comprise of fragment of a sequence according to the first aspect which is at least 30<br>
bases long, for example, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90 bases in length.<br>
The nucleic acid sequence encoding the antigenic polypeptide of the first aspect of the<br>
invention may be genomic DNA, cDNA or RNA, for example mRNA.<br>
The antigenic polypeptide of the first aspect of the invention may be a cell membrane<br>
protein, for example an integral membrane protein or a cytoplasmic protein.<br>
Preferably, the antigenic polypeptide of the first aspect of the invention is expressed by a<br>
pathogenic organism, for example, a bacterium, virus or yeast. Preferably the pathogenic<br>
organism is a bacterium. The bacterium may be a gram-positive or gram-negative<br>
bacterium, preferably a gram-positive bacterium.<br>
The bacterium may be selected from the group consisting of:<br>
Bacillus subtillis, Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus epidermidis; Enterococcus<br>
faecalis; Mycobacterium tuberculsis; Streptococcus group B; Streptoccocus<br>
pneumoniae; Helicobacter pylori; Neisseria gonorrhea; Streptococcus group A; Borrelia<br>
burgdorferi; Coccidiodes immitis; Histoplasma sapsulatum; Neisseria meningitidis type<br>
B; Shigella flexneri; Escherichia coli; Haemophilus influenzae; Listeria monocytogenes,<br>
5<br>
 <br>
Bacillus anthracis, Corynebacterium diptheriae, Clostridium tetani, Mycoplasma spp. and<br>
Treponema pallidum.<br>
Preferably the bacterium is of the genus Staphylococcus spp. Preferably still the bacterium<br>
is Staphylococcus aureus.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the antigenic polypeptide of the first aspect of<br>
the invention is associated with infective pathogenicity of an organism as defined herein.<br>
In a further preferred aspect of the invention the antigenic polypeptide comprises all, or<br>
part of, the amino acid sequence shown in Figure 7 to 12.<br>
As used herein "part of may include a polypeptide fragment which may be at least 10, 15,<br>
20 or 30 amino acids long.<br>
The antigenic polypeptide of the first aspect of the invention may comprise a non-protein<br>
antigen, for example a polysaccharide antigen.<br>
As used herein, the term "polypeptide" means, in general terms, a plurality of amino acid<br>
residues joined together by peptide bonds. It is used interchangeably and means the same<br>
as peptide, protein, oligopeptide, or oligomer. The term "polypeptide" is also intended to<br>
include fragments, analogues and derivatives of a polypeptide wherein the fragment,<br>
analogue or derivative retains essentially the same biological activity or function as a<br>
reference protein.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a vector comprising a<br>
nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide according to the first aspect of the invention.<br>
The vector of the second aspect of the invention may be a plasmid, cosmid or phage. The<br>
vector may include a transcription control sequence (promoter sequence) which mediates<br>
cell specific expression, for example, a cell specific, inducible or constitutive promoter<br>
sequence. The vector may be an expression vector adapted for prokaryotic or eukaryotic<br>
6<br>
 <br>
gene expression, for example, the vector may include one or more selectable markers<br>
and/or autonomous replication sequences which facilitate the maintenance of the vector in<br>
either a eukaryotic cell or prokaryotic host (Sambrook et al (1989) Molecular Cloning: A<br>
Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbour, NY and<br>
references therein; Marston, F (1987) DNA Cloning Techniques: A Practical Approach<br>
Vol III IRL Press, Oxford UK; DNA Cloning: F M Ausubel et al, Current Protocols in<br>
Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.(1994). Vectors which are maintained<br>
autonomously are referred to as episomal vectors.<br>
Promoter is an art recognised term and may include enhancer elements which are cis acting<br>
nucleic acid sequences often found 5' to the transcription initiation site of a gene<br>
(enhancers can also be found 3' to a gene sequence or even located in intronic sequences<br>
and is therefore position independent). Enhancer activity is responsive to trans acting<br>
transcription factors (polypeptides) which have been shown to bind specifically to<br>
enhancer elements. The binding/activity of transcription factors (please see Eukaryotic<br>
Transcription Factors, by David S Latchman, Academic Press Ltd, San Diego) is<br>
responsive to a number of environmental cues which include intermediary metabolites (eg<br>
glucose, lipids), environmental effectors (eg light, heat,).<br>
Promoter elements also include so called TATA box and RNA polymerase initiation<br>
selection (RIS) sequences which function to select a site of transcription initiation. These<br>
sequences also bind polypeptides which function, inter alia, to facilitate transcription<br>
initiation selection by RNA polymerase.<br>
The vector of the second aspect of the invention may include a transcription termination or<br>
polyadenylation sequences. This may also include an internal ribosome entry sites (IRES).<br>
The vector may include a nucleic acid sequence that is arranged in a bicistronic or multi-<br>
cistronic expression cassette.<br>
According to a third aspect of the invention there is provided a method for the production<br>
of a recombinant antigenic polypeptide according to any previous aspect of the invention<br>
comprising:<br>
7<br>
 <br>
(i) providing a cell transformed/transfected with a vector according to the second<br>
aspect of the invention;<br>
(ii) growing said cell in conditions suitable for the production of said polypeptides; and<br>
(iii) purifying said polypeptide from said cell, or its growth environment.<br>
In a preferred aspect of the method of the third aspect, the vector encodes, and thus said<br>
recombinant polypeptide is provided with, a secretion signal to facilitate purification of<br>
said polypeptide.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the invention there is provided a cell or cell-line<br>
transformed or transfected with the vector according to the second aspect of the invention.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said cell is a prokaryotic cell, for example,<br>
yeast or a bacterium such as E.coli. Alternatively said cell is a eukaryotic cell, for example<br>
a fungal, insect, amphibian, mammalian, for example, COS, CHO cells, Bowes Melanoma<br>
and other suitable human cells, or plant cell.<br>
According to a fifth aspect of the invention there is provided a vaccine comprising at least<br>
one antigenic polypeptide, or part thereof, according to the first aspect of the invention.<br>
Preferably said vaccine further comprises a carrier and/or adjuvant.<br>
As used herein "part thereof may include a fragment or subunit of the antigenic<br>
polypeptide wherein the fragment or subunit is sufficient to induce an antigenic response<br>
in a recipient.<br>
The vaccine according to the fifth aspect may be a subunit vaccine in which the<br>
immunogenic part of the vaccine is a fragment or subunit of the antigenic polypeptide<br>
according to the first aspect of the invention.<br>
The terms adjuvant and carrier are construed in the following manner. Some polypeptide<br>
or peptide antigens contain B-cell epitopes but no T cell epitopes. Immune responses can<br>
be greatly enhanced by the inclusion of a T cell epitope in the polypeptide/peptide or by<br>
8<br>
 <br>
the conjugation of the polypeptide/peptide to an immunogenic carrier protein such as key<br>
hole limpet haemocyanin or tetanus toxoid which contain multiple T cell epitopes. The<br>
conjugate is taken up by antigen presenting cells, processed and presented by human<br>
leukocyte antigens (HLA's) class II molecules. This allows T cell help to be given by T<br>
cell's specific for carrier derived epitopes to the B cell which is specific for the original<br>
antigenic polypeptide/peptide. This can lead to increase in antibody production, secretion<br>
and isotype switching.<br>
An adjuvant is a substance or procedure which augments specific immune responses to<br>
antigens by modulating the activity of immune cells. Examples of adjuvants include, by<br>
example only, agonsitic antibodies to co-stimulatory molecules, Freunds adjuvant,<br>
muramyl dipeptides, liposomes. An adjuvant is therefore an immunomodulator. A carrier<br>
is an immunogenic molecule which, when bound to a second molecule augments immune<br>
responses to the latter.<br>
In yet a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method to immunise an animal<br>
against a pathogenic microbe comprising administering to said animal at least one<br>
polypeptide, or part thereof, according to the first aspect of the invention. Preferably, the<br>
polypeptide is in the form of a vaccine according to the fifth aspect of the invention.<br>
In a preferred method of the invention the animal is human.<br>
Preferably the antigenic polypeptide of the first aspect, or the vaccine of the fifth aspect, of<br>
the invention can be delivered by direct injection either intravenously, intramuscularly,<br>
subcutaneously. Further still, the vaccine or antigenic polypeptide, may be taken orally.<br>
The polypeptide or vaccine may be administered in a pharmaceuticaUy acceptable carrier,<br>
such as the various aqueous and lipid media, such as sterile saline, utilized for preparing<br>
injectables to be administered intramuscularly and subcutaneously. Conventional<br>
suspending and dispersing agents can be employed. Other means of administration, such<br>
as implants, for example a sustained low dose releasing bio-observable pellet, will be<br>
apparent to the skilled artisan.<br>
9<br>
 <br>
The vaccine may be against the bacterial species Staphylococcus aureus S. epidermidis,<br>
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and B. anthracis, Listeria<br>
monocytogenes.<br>
It will also be apparent that vaccines or antigenic polypeptides are effective at preventing<br>
or alleviating conditions in animals other than humans, for example and not by way of<br>
limitation, family pets (e.g. domestic animals such as cats and dogs), livestock (e.g. cattle,<br>
sheep, pigs) and horses.<br>
A further aspect of the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an<br>
effective amount of at least one of the polypeptides of the invention, or a vaccine of the<br>
invention. These polypeptides may also include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or<br>
diluent.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided an antibody, or at least an<br>
effective binding part thereof, which binds at least one antigenic polypeptide, or part<br>
thereof, according to the invention.<br>
As antibodies can be modified in a number of ways, the term "antibody" should be<br>
construed as covering any binding member or substance having a binding domain with the<br>
required specificity for the antigenic polypeptide. Thus, this term covers antibody<br>
fragments, derivatives, functional equivalents and homologues of antibodies, including any<br>
polypeptide comprising an immunoglobulin binding domain, whether natural or wholly or<br>
partially synthetic. Chimeric molecules comprising an immunoglobulin binding domain, or<br>
equivalent, fused to another polypeptide are therefore included. Cloning and expression of<br>
chimeric antibodies are described in EP-A-0120694 and EP-A-0125023.<br>
In a preferred aspect of the invention said antibody is a polyclonal or monoclonal antibody.<br>
In a further preferred aspect of the invention said antibody is a chimeric antibody produced<br>
by recombinant methods to contain the variable region of said antibody with an invariant<br>
or constant region of a human antibody.<br>
10<br>
 <br>
In a further preferred aspect of the invention, said antibody is humanised by recombinant<br>
methods to combine the complimentarity determining regions of said antibody with both<br>
the constant (C) regions and the framework regions from the variable (V) regions of a<br>
human antibody.<br>
Preferably said antibody is provided with a marker including a conventional label or tag,<br>
for example a radioactive and/or fluorescent and/or epitope label or tag.<br>
Preferably said humanised monoclonal antibody to said polypeptide is produced as a<br>
fusion polypeptide in an expression vector suitably adapted for transfection or<br>
transformation of prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells.<br>
Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, are protein molecules which have specificity<br>
for foreign molecules (antigens). Immunoglobulins (Ig) are a class of structurally related<br>
proteins consisting of two pairs of polypeptide chains, one pair of light (L) (low molecular<br>
weight) chain (K or X), and one pair of heavy (H) chains (y, a, |J,, 8 and s), all four linked<br>
together by disulphide bonds. Both H and L chains have regions that contribute to the<br>
binding of antigen and that are highly variable from one Ig molecule to another. In<br>
addition, H and L chains contain regions that are non-variable or constant.<br>
The L chains consist of two domains. The carboxy-terminal domain is essentially identical<br>
among L chains of a given type and is referred to as the "constant" (C) region. The amino<br>
terminal domain varies from L chain to L chain and contributes to the binding site of the<br>
antibody. Because of its variability, it is referred to as the "variable" (V) region.<br>
The H chains of Ig molecules are of several classes, a, ja, a, a, and y (of which there are<br>
several sub-classes). An assembled Ig molecule consisting of one or more units of two<br>
identical H and L chains, derives its name from the H chain that it possesses. Thus, there<br>
are five Ig isotypes: IgA, IgM, IgD, IgE and IgG (with four sub-classes based on the<br>
differences in the H chains, i.e., IgGl, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4). Further detail regarding<br>
antibody structure and their various functions can be found in, Using Antibodies: A<br>
laboratory manual, Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press.<br>
11<br>
 <br>
Chimeric antibodies are recombinant antibodies in which all of the V-regions of a mouse<br>
or rat antibody are combined with human antibody C-regions. Humanised antibodies are<br>
recombinant hybrid antibodies which fuse the complimentarity determining regions from a<br>
rodent antibody V-region with the framework regions from the human antibody V-regions.<br>
The C-regions from the human antibody are also used. The complimentarity determining<br>
regions (CDRs) are the regions within the N-terminal domain of both the heavy and light<br>
chain of the antibody to where the majority of the variation of the V-region is restricted.<br>
These regions form loops at the surface of the antibody molecule. These loops provide the<br>
binding surface between the antibody and antigen.<br>
Antibodies from non-human animals provoke an immune response to the foreign antibody<br>
and its removal from the circulation. Both chimeric and humanised antibodies have<br>
reduced antigenicity when injected to a human subject because there is a reduced amount<br>
of rodent (i.e. foreign) antibody within the recombinant hybrid antibody, while the human<br>
antibody regions do not illicit an immune response. This results in a weaker immune<br>
response and a decrease in the clearance of the antibody. This is clearly desirable when<br>
using therapeutic antibodies in the treatment of human diseases. Humanised antibodies are<br>
designed to have less "foreign" antibody regions and are therefore thought to be less<br>
immunogenic than chimeric antibodies.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention said antibodies are antibodies whose<br>
activity is mediated by complement for example, the activity of the antibody may be<br>
activated by complement.<br>
In another aspect of the invention there is provided a vector comprising a nucleic acid<br>
sequence encoding the humanised or chimeric antibodies according to the invention.<br>
In a yet further aspect of the invention, there is provided a cell or cell line which comprises<br>
the vector encoding the humanised or chimeric antibody according to the invention. The<br>
cell or cell line may be transformed or transfected with the vector encoding the humanised<br>
or chimeric antibody according to the invention.<br>
12<br>
 <br>
In a yet further aspect of the invention there is provided a hybridoma cell line which<br>
produces a monoclonal antibody as hereinbefore described.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of producing monoclonal<br>
antibodies according to the invention using hybridoma cell lines according to the<br>
invention.<br>
In a yet further aspect of the invention there is provided a method for the production of the<br>
humanised or chimeric antibody according to the invention comprising :<br>
(i) providing a cell transformed or transfected with a vector which comprises a<br>
nucleic acid molecule encoding the humanised or chimeric antibody<br>
according to the invention;<br>
(ii) growing said cell in conditions suitable for the production of said antibody;<br>
and<br>
purifying said antibody from said cell, or its growth environment.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method for preparing a hybridoma<br>
cell-line according to the invention comprising the steps of:<br>

Figure 15 Graphs showing that heat treatment of sera from a human patient (□), from a<br>
non-immunized rabbit (O) or from sera raised against the A. thaliana cyclophilin protein<br>
(A) did not induce death of S. aureus SJF741. No killing of S. aureus SJF741 was<br>
observed either when using native sera from a patient convalescent from S. aureus<br>
infection (■) (Panel A) and from a non-immunized rabbit (●) (Panel B). When native sera<br>
raised against the A. thaliana cyclophilin protein (▲) (Panel C), against the B. subtilis<br>
proteins Obg (▼) and YdiB (+) (Panel D) and against the S. aureus protein SA1387 (♦)<br>
16<br>
 <br>
(Panel E) a minor decrease in the number of S. aureus SJF741 during the first 6 hours was<br>
observed, which was followed by subsequent recovery.<br>
Figure 16 Graphs showing that native sera raised against the B. subtilis proteins YsxC<br>
(●), YphC (■), and YwlC (▲) (Panels A and B) killed S. aureus SJF471 dramatically, a 5<br>
log decrease within 2 to 4 hours. A similar effect was observed when using native sera<br>
raised against the S. aureus peptides YneS-731 (▼) and YneS 733 (♦) and the S. aureus<br>
protein Gcp (+) (Panels C-E). In contrast, heat treating the sera raised against the B.<br>
subtilis YsxC protein (O) or the S. aureus peptides YneS-731 (V) and YneS-733 (0)<br>
(Panels A, C, D) abolished the killing abilities of these sera, which were able to kill S.<br>
aureus SJF741 in the native form (not heat-treated), as indicated above. Hence, the killing<br>
abilities of the sera are due to a heat labile component, which is inactivated in the heat<br>
treated sample. No experiments using heat treated sera raised against the B. subtilis<br>
proteins YphC (■) and YwlC (▲) or against the S. aureus gcp protein (+) are shown in<br>
this figure, and the experiments with the corresponding native sera (Panels B and E), as<br>
indicated above, illustrate the S. aureus killing capability of these sera.<br>

NOTE: Different strains of S. aureus have different locus names for the same genes due to<br>
phage insertions within the sequence. In this document, the locus names used for the S.<br>
aureus genes correspond to those in the S. aureus N315 sequence.<br>
Antigen preparation<br>
The genes encoding selected proteins from Bacillus subtilis 168 (Obg, YdiB, YphC (Fig<br>
1), YsxC (Fig 2), YwlC (Fig 3), and S. aureus N315 (SA1387, Gcp/SA1854 (Fig 6)) were<br>
amplified by PCR. The resulting products were cloned in plasmid pETBlue-1, and the<br>
genes overexpressed in Escherichia coli Tuner™(DE3) pLacI Competent Cells (Novagen)<br>
according to the manufacturers instructions. The overexpressed proteins were purified in a<br>
3-step scheme based on anion exchange, hydrophobic and gel filtration chromatography.<br>
The level of protein overexpression was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, and the purity had an<br>
average of 90%. In addition, selected peptides within the S. aureus N315 protein SA1187<br>
18<br>
 <br>
(YneS-731 (Fig 4) and YneS-733 (Fig 5)) were synthesized on a Milligen 9050 Peptide<br>
Synthesizer using F-moc chemistry. The F-moc amino acids (Novobiochem/Merck) were<br>
activated immediately before coupling using equimolar amounts of HCTU or HBTU in the<br>
presence of a 10% molar excess of HOBt. In both cases, a cysteine was incorporated at the<br>
C-terminus of the peptide to enable linkage to carrier protein by assembling the peptide on<br>
Fmoc-L-Cys(Trf)-PEG-PS resin (Applied Biosystems). Peptides were purified using a CI8<br>
Vydac column (22x250 mm) using gradients of acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. Peptides were<br>
verified by Mass Spectrometry. The purified peptides were conjugated to KLH (Sigma)<br>
(carrier protein) to enhance immunogenicity of the hapten in the rabbit. Conjugation was<br>
performed in lOx PBS using MBS (Sigma).<br>
Sera<br>
Sera were obtained from the Antibody Resource Center at the University of Sheffield<br>
from: i) rabbits immunized against proteins from B. subtilis (Obg, YdiB, YphC, YwlC and<br>
YsxC and S. aureus (Gcp, SA1387); ii) rabbits immunized against KLH-conjugated<br>
peptides selected within the S. aureus protein SA1187 (YneS-731, YneS-733); iii) rabbits<br>
immunized against a KLH-conjugated peptide from the cyclophilin protein from<br>
Arabidopsis thaliana; iv) naive (non-immune) rabbit serum; and, v) human serum from a<br>
patient convalescent from a S. aureus infection.<br>
The immunization process was performed as follows. For each rabbit 200 to 500 (ig of<br>
antigen (in a maximum volume of 250 ul of Phosphate Buffer Saline, PBS) were mixed<br>
with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant. The solution was filtered through a<br>
23 G needle until an emulsion formed which did not separate on standing. Inoculate each<br>
rabbit with a maximum of 500 ul subcutaneously. On day 22, 43 and 64 the injection was<br>
repeated but using incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Sample bleeds were collected on day 53<br>
and after day 64. Injection dates were flexible within a range of 3 to 6 weeks. When a<br>
suitable titre is detected in the test serum a final boost followed by bleed out 10 days later<br>
can be planned.<br>
19<br>
 <br>
Sera were stored frozen being thawed and filtered through 0.2 urn pore diameter filters<br>
(Minisart High Flow, Sartorius) immediately before use in killing experiments.<br>
Using western blot analysis (data not shown) it was shown that antibodies against the B.<br>
subtilis YdiB recognize a band of the size corresponding to the YdiB homolog in S.<br>
aureus, suggesting the species cross-reactivity of these antibodies.<br>
Media and growth conditions<br>
To prepare the inoculum for the serum experiments S. aureus SJF741 was grown at 37°C<br>
in Brain Heart Infusion medium (BHI; Oxoid) supplemented with erythromycin (Sigma) to<br>
a final concentration of 5 |a.g/ml (BHI-Ery).<br>
Preparation of the inoculum<br>
A single colony of S. aureus SJF741 freshly grown on BHI-Ery plates from the laboratory<br>
frozen stock was inoculated in 30 ml universals containing 5 ml of BHI-Ery and incubated<br>
overnight (between 12 to 16 hours) at 37°C in an orbital shaker (250 rpm). A 10-fold<br>
dilution in Phosphate Saline Buffer (PBS) of the resulting culture was prepared<br>
immediately before inoculation into serum.<br>
Serum experiments<br>
Aliquots of 200 ul from the various sera in 1.5 ml microfuge tubes were inoculated with<br>
the PBS dilution of S. aureus SJF741 (See Preparation of the inoculum) to a final cell<br>
density of 1x106 to 1x107 cells/ml, followed by incubation in a rotary shaker at 37°C. 10 ul<br>
samples were taken periodically from these serum cultures, serially diluted, and 10 ul from<br>
each dilution plated on BHI-Ery plates, which were subsequently incubated at 37°C<br>
overnight. In addition, another 10 ul sample from each serum culture was directly plated<br>
on BHI-Ery plates. Only the dilutions rendering between 1 to 40 colonies were enumerated<br>
and the number of viable cells (colony forming units, CFU) per ml determined.<br>
20<br>
 <br>
RESULTS<br>
To evaluate the staphylococcal killing abilities of the various sera, S. aureus was<br>
challenged with the various rabbit anti-sera and survival over time was evaluated. The<br>
results showed that S. aureus was dramatically killed within 2 to 3 hours of contact with<br>
sera (Fig 16) containing antibodies against Gcp and YneS, as well as to other surface<br>
proteins. In contrast, antibodies against cytoplasmic proteins from B. subtilis (Obg and<br>
YdiB), to a membrane protein from Arabidopsis thaliana (cyclophilin), and to various<br>
normal rabbit sera did not show the bactericidal phenotype (Fig. 15). Strikingly, sera from<br>
rabbits immunized against other presumed cytoplasmic proteins from B. subtilis (YsxC<br>
and YphC and YwlC) also revealed a killing phenotype similar to the one observed for<br>
Gcp and YneS (731 and 733) antibodies. This was unexpected since YsxC, YphC and<br>
YwlC are presumed cytoplasmic proteins and, therefore, are not surface exposed and so<br>
the antisera would not be expected to recognise them.<br>
This work suggests the location of YsxC in the membrane fraction of S. aureus. This work<br>
has further demonstrated that the killing effect is mediated through a heat-labile<br>
component (inactivated by heat treatment, See Material and Methods) present in serum,<br>
likely to correspond to some of the components of the complement (Fig. 16).<br>
