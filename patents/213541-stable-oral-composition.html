COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10; rule 13)<br>
STABLE ORAL COMPOSITION<br>
SUN PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES LTD.<br><br>
A company incorporated under the laws of India having their office at ACME PLAZA, ANDHERI-KURLA ROAD, ANDHERI (E), MUMBAI-400059, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA               The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the<br>
/	manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br>
STABLE ORAL COMPOSITION<br>
The present invention relates to a solid oral pharmaceutical composition. More specifically this invention relates to a stable oral composition of descarbonylethoxyloratadine (Desloratadine).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Descarbonylethoxyloratadine, also called desloratadine, is chemically known as 8-chloro-6,11-dihydro-ll-(4-piperidylidene)-5H-benzo[5,6]-cyclohepta[l,2-b]pyridrne. Desloratadine, a metabolic derivative of loratadine, is a long-acting tricyclic histamine antagonist with selective Hj-receptor histamine antagonist activity. Descarbonylethoxyloratadine is indicated for the relief of the nasal and non-nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis (seasonal and perennial) in patients 12 years of age and older. It is also indicated for the symptomatic relief of pruritus, reduction in the number of hives, and size of hives, in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, 12 years of age and older.<br>
United States Patent Number 6,100,274 claims a stable pharmaceutical composition of desloratadine comprising a desloratadine-protective amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable basic salt and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable disintegrant. The patent mentions that acidic excipients discolor and decompose desloratadine. Desloratadine compositions were found to discolor when stored at 75% relative humidity ("RH") and a temperature of 40° C, alone or in combination with various excipients. This color instability in the active ingredient was attributed to a very minute amount of degradation product, the N-formyl impurity of desloratidine, which is formed due to the presence of a wide variety of excipients commonly used in oral formulations - especially tablet formulations. The unsuitable excipients include acidic excipients including, but not limited to, stearic acid, povidone and crospovidone, and other acidic excipients having a pH of less than 7 in water, preferably in the range of about 3 to 5, as well as excipients such as lactose, lactose monohydrate, sodium benzoate, and the like. The patent teaches the use of calcium, magnesium and aluminum salts of carbonates, phosphates, silicates and sulfates, or mixtures thereof as stabilizers. However, the patent does not teach any other means of stabilizing desloratadine.<br>
United States Patent Application Number 20020123504A1 relates to stable pharmaceutical compositions of desloratadine formulated to avoid the incompatibility between desloratadine and reactive excipients such as lactose and other mono- and di-saccharides. Disclosed<br><br><br>
compositions include lactose-free, non-hygroscopic and anhydrous stable pharmaceutical compositions of desloratadine. The patent application" teaches that stable composition of desloratadine can be obtained by using anhydrous process and excipients, such that the unbound water that may be present in the formulation is insufficient to initiate and/or accelerate any reaction of desloratadine with reactive excipients. Other means of stabilization taught by the patent application include coating of desloratadine particles to avoid contact with reactive excipients, or using large particles of desloratadine, so that surface area of contact With the reactive excipients is reduced. However, the methods suggested in this application either provide solutions that involve avoiding conventional formulation procedures such as wet granulation, or suggest other means that may affect bioavailability of the formulation, for example, coating or using large particles.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a stable pharmaceutical composition of desloratadine.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to find novel means for stabilizing desloratadine compositions.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to prevent or decrease the formation of N-formyl impurity in desloratadine composition, using novel means of stabilization.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a pharmaceutical composition for desloratadine, which composition is stable in the presence of reactive excipients.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
We have surprisingly found that pharmaceutical compositions comprising desloratadine can be stabilized using a stabilizer selected from the group comprising of an antioxidant, a pharmaceutically acceptable organic compound that provides an alkaline pH, an alkali metal salt and mixtures thereof. Hence, the invention lies in the use of a stabilizer, which stabilizer provides stability, while providing the freedom to use conventional excipients and processes. We have also surprisingly found that alkali metal salts functions as an effective stabilizer in pharmaceutical composition of desloratadine when used in small quantities whereas the basic salts used in prior art compositions are used in comparatively larger quantities.<br><br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a stable oral composition comprising desloratadine and a stabilizer selected from an antioxidant, a pharmaceutically acceptable organic compound that provides an alkaline pH, an alkali metal salt, and mixtures thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a pharmaceutical compositions comprising desloratadine, a stabilizer selected from the group comprising an antioxidant, a pharmaceutically acceptable organic compound that provides an alkaline pH, an alkali metal salt and mixtures thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention comprises desloratadine in a therapeutically effective amount. The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein indicates the amount of desloratadine required to be administered to a subject in need thereof, to have the desired therapeutic effect. In accordance with the present invention, desloratadine is preferably used in an amount ranging from about 0. lmg to about 15mg.<br>
Compositi or both, when the composition is stored at 40°C and 75% relative humidity for 3 months. The compositions of the present invention are found to be stable when stored at 40°C and 75% relative humidity for 3 months, which storage condition is indicative of the stability of the<br><br><br>
product when stored at ambient conditions for 24 months, i.e. the shelf life of the composition.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a stable oral composition of desloratadine is obtained using an antioxidant as a stabilizer. The antioxidants used in the present invention may be selected from the group consisting of butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyanisole, DL-alpha-tocopherol, propyl gallate, octyl gallate, ethylenediamine tetraacetate, ascorbyl palmitate, acetyl cysteine, ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, fumaric acid, lecithin and the like and mixtures thereof. The antioxidants may be used in an amount ranging from about 0.01% to about 5% by weight of the composition.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a stable oral composition of desloratadine is obtained using as a stabilizer, a pharmaceutically acceptable organic compound that provides an alkaline pH. The pharmaceutically acceptable organic compound used in the present invention to provide an alkaline pH may be selected from the group consisting of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, cyclic amines, N,N"-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, meglumine (N-methylglucamine), monosodium glutamate, polacrillin sodium, sodium alginate, and mixtures thereof. The organic compound may be used in an amount ranging from about 0.01% to about 5% by weight of the composition.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a stable oral composition of desloratadine is obtained using an alkali metal salt as a stabilizer. We have found that the alkali metal salts used in the present invention effectively stabilize the composition when used in smaller quantities than the alkaline earth metal salts that are used in the prior art compositions. Alkali-metal salts that may be preferably used include sodium and potassium salts of carbonates, phosphates, silicates, sulfates, citrates and the like and mixtures thereof. The alkali metal salt may be used in an amount ranging from about 0.01% to about 10% by weight of the composition.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may further comprise inert pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as diluents, flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, tablet disintegration agents or encapsulating materials. These excipients may be used in amounts conventional in the art.<br>
The disintegrants used in the present invention may be selected from the group consisting of microcrystalline cellulose, starch, e.g., pregelatinized starch and corn starch, croscarmellose<br><br><br>
sodium and confectioner"s sugar (a mixture of at least 95% by weight sucrose and corn starch that has been ground to a fine powder).<br>
The binders used in the present invention may be selected from the group consisting of starch, gelatin, dextrin, maltodextrin, natural and synthetic gums like acacia, alginic acid, sodium alginate, guar gum, extract of Irish moss, ghatti gum, mucilage of isapol husks, carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, veegum, arabogalactan and the like and mixtures thereof.<br>
The lubricants used in the present invention may be selected from the group consisting of talc, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, stearic acid, hydrogenated vegetable oils, polyethylene glycol and the like and mixtures thereof.<br>
The typical glidants that may be included in the present invention include colloidal silicon dioxide, talc and the like.<br>
Examples of wicking agents that may be used in the present invention include colloidal silicon dioxide, kaolin, titanium dioxide, fumed silicon dioxide, niacinamide, sodium lauryl sulfate, m-pyrol, vinylpyrrolidone polymers such as povidone, or crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone such as crospovidone; cellulose and cellulose derivatives such as microcrystalline cellulose, methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxyalkyl celluloses or crosslinked carboxyalkylcelluloses and their alkali salts; sodium starch glycolate, starch and starch derivatives, ion-exchange resins and the like and mixtures thereof.<br>
The present invention may also include various other pharmaceutical^ acceptable excipients such as sweetening agents, wetting agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and other such excipients.<br>
The term "pharmaceutical composition" as used herein includes solid oral dosage forms such as pellets, beads, granules and the like, which may be encapsulated or compressed into tablets. The pellets, beads, granules in turn may be prepared by conventional methods known to a person skilled in the art. The compressed tablets may optionally be coated with film-coat.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be prepared by the conventional process of wet granulation, dry granulation or direct compression. In wet<br><br><br>
granulation, the drug along with the stabilizer and various excipients is mixed, granulated, followed by screening and drying of the damp mass. The dried mass may be screened, lubricated and compressed. Dry granulation can be done by two processes: (1) slugging, which involves mixing the drug with the stabilizer and the excipients, slugging, dry screening, lubrication and compression, and (2) roller compaction process. Direct compression involves compressing tablets directly from the powdered material of the drug, the stabilizer and the excipients.<br>
Alternatively the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be obtained by preparing placebo granules comprising the stabilizer and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, and mixing these with desloratadine to obtain a blend, which may be encapsulated or compressed into tablets. This method provides compositions of desloratadine that are stable i.e. stable as regards chemical and physical degradation.<br>
The examples that follow do not limit the scope of the invention and are merely used as illustrations.<br>
Example 1 The oral pharmaceutical composition of the present invention was obtained as per the formula given in Table 1 below. This illustration exemplifies the use of a mixture of an antioxidant and a pharmaceutically acceptable organic compound that provides an alkaline pH, as a stabilizer.<br>
