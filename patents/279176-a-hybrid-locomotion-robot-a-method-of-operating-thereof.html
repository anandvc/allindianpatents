				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel concept in mobile robot. More particularly relates to a robot in which a combination of sliding and tracking hybrid locomotion is specially brought out to improve safe manoeuvering of the robot in an uneven terrain.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ARTS<br>
There are hybrid locomotion robots, combining the walking locomotion by legs and wheel locomotion. These are all need to follow a specific gaits or sequence of operation for walking in straight as well as in turning.<br>
The major disadvantage of walking locomotion is its speed of movement; hence incorporating the tracking locomotion in addition to the legged locomotion can optimize the speed of the overall cycle of operation. So that merits of both type of locomotion can be achieved in the same mobile robot. Even though the walk locomotion by legs and tracks locomotion are combined, it is difficult to decouple the path of the body and the sequence of legs motion.<br>
This aspect of the robot without disturbing the legs location for maneuvering the constraint obstacle or avoiding the dangerous location is addresses on this invention by combining the sliding locomotion by legs and tracking locomotion by tracks.<br>
The locomotion to the mobile robot may be achieved by means of legs, wheels and tracks either independently or in combination. Wheel locomotion would perform efficiently in structured environment but the same may not be suitable to maneuver in the unstructured environment. It is possible by means of legged and track locomotion to move the robot in unstructured environment like vertical obstacle, trench crossing, and stair climbing and moving in the uneven terrain.<br>
The major disadvantage of legs locomotion is its speed of movement; hence incorporating the tracking locomotion in addition to the legged locomotion can optimize the speed of the overall cycle of operation. Consequently the merits of the both types of locomotion can be achieved in the same mobile robot.<br>
Though there are hybrid robots reported in the literature, all of them except one have been constructed with legs and wheels only. The only relevant hybrid robot is disclosed in US patent no. 4977971 issued to Carl D. Crane and Dana S. Haukoos assigned by University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida.<br>
Even in this reported hybrid robot, the features enumerated and the philosophy of functioning are entirely different from the hybrid robot presented through this disclosure. The salient and distinct differences are brought out in the successive description.<br>
In the reported case, though the locomotion is achieved on a single platform, it is difficult to decouple the legs and body position while turning the robot in uneven terrain. This difficulty is due to the fact that the hybrid locomotion has been achieved by assembling the wheels and tracks at the end of the legs in series manner.<br>
In the above mentioned robotic vehicle, it is not possible to turn it with respect to the centre of axis and is also not possible to change the body position without disturbing the legs supporting position while moving on an uneven terrain, whereas in the present context of the robot, it is an important feature for manoeuvering safely in the constraint obstacle. This has been addressed in this invention by combining the sliding locomotion by legs and tracking locomotion by tracks.<br>
Current invention has a pivot turning in the both locomotion and also is configured in such a way to move the vehicle either by leg or by track independently and in some situation combined.<br>
Further robot has been configured to move on the outdoor terrain with practical heavy payloads like manipulator arm for carrying the detection sensors. It is also configured in such a way to integrate leg, and tracks in parallel arrangement. This feature is not disclosed in any of the literature and patents. This facilitates locomotion to the robot without losing the individuality that means while operating with leg, behaves like a fully legged robot or while operating in tracked mode, behaves like a fully tracked robot. At the same time it utilizes the advantage of both locomotion while in combined operation.<br>
Moreover, it has a symmetric construction in nature so that the stability of the robot will be ensured while moving in the unstructured environment. Also the robot has a feature of adaptability to the terrain surface achieved by means of rotating the legs and adjusting the height of the legs suitably based on the amount of unevenness in the ground.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The principal object of the present invention is to develop a unique assembly of legs and tracks in such a way that the sliding and tracking locomotion to the robot are achieved independently and also simultaneously.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to develop the robot with combined actions of legs and tracks in specified sequence to achieve the stair climbing, trench and vertical crossing capacity as well as to operate even in the larger undulation ground.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to develop a platform which is integrated with serial arm manipulator to carry a payload like sensor for detection purpose.<br>

In still another embodiment of the present invention the robot is capable of crossing trench and vertical obstacle and is carried-out by using the tracks (30) and outer base legs (14).<br>
The present invention is in relation to a method of operating a robot (1) in sliding locomotion on an uneven terrain comprising acts of; lifting inner base legs (24) from ground (26), moving the lifted legs (24) forward for a predetermined distance by linear actuator (23) and thereafter moving downwards to touch the ground (26), lifting outer base legs (14) upon ensuring the contact of the inner legs (24) with the ground (26). and moving the lifted legs (14) forward for a predetermined distance by the linear actuator (23).<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention turning during sliding locomotion is achieved by rotating the outer base leg assembly (10) with respect to the inner base leg assembly (20) using rotary actuator (25).<br>
The present invention is in relation to a method of operating a robot (1) in crawling movement comprises acts of; contacting track assembly (30) to ground (26) by lifting<br>

In the present invention, the hybrid locomotion is proposed for a robot (1) with eight legs for sliding and the crawling of the robot (1) with tracks (30) on both sides of the robot (1). Especially during sliding locomotion the legs are utilized only to support the robot (1) in uneven terrains and not for movement of the robot (1). The actual mobility of body of the robot (1) is achieved by providing dedicated actuators for linear and rotary movements of the body. Decoupling path of the body and the sequence of legs motion facilitates higher degree of mobility in a constrained environment. In addition to the sliding motion, tracks (30) have been utilized for crawling locomotion for crossing all terrain environments.<br>
The four legs are integrated with the each base of the leg. All the legs are having two degrees of freedoms such as rotation with respect to pitch axis and linear translation in vertical direction to move the legs up and down for accommodating the uneven surfaces. At the end of the each leg, foot is attached with revolute joint to accommodate irregular terrain on its own.<br>
Trench crossing is achieved by the tracks (30) and suspension (34) assembled on the outer base of the vehicle. In addition sudden vertical obstacle crossing is achieved by raising the front portion of the outer base leg assembly by means of varying the height of the front and rear legs. These will facilitate in making the approach angle to the track and thereafter the tracks (30) come into the action for further mobility to cross the obstacle.<br>
 <br>
Other objective and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description in which is to be taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing illustrating the preferred embodiment of this invention.<br>
Construction of hybrid robot:<br>
Referring to Fig.l and Fig. 2, robot 1 consists basically of two bases called outer base leg assembly (10) and inner base leg assembly (20). The outer base leg assembly (10) has four legs (14); each has two degrees of freedom such as rotation and translation movement. The inner base leg assembly (20) has four legs (24) each of which will have independent linear translation movement.<br>
One linear actuator (23) has been provided for translation movement and a rotary actuator (25) for turning the robot. Linear actuator (23) is fixed with the outer base leg assembly (10). The rotary actuator (25) is fixed with the inner base leg assembly (20) and attached with the linear actuator (23) using lead screw of the outer base leg assembly (10).<br>
There is a manipulator (40) mounted at front of the body of robot (1), the manipulator (40) having four degree of freedoms, all jointed arm configuration in serial connection. This manipulator (40) will have detection sensor (41) to sweep over the ground (26).<br>
The legs (14) also comprise of outer leg linear actuator (11) and Outer leg ball screw (12) along with leg rotary actuator (13). The legs (24) also comprise inner leg linear actuator<br>
(21).<br>
Fig.3 shows the outer base having the wheel (31) with tracks (30) for the tracking purpose. The robot (1) moves by the powered sprockets (32) on left and right of the outer leg base. In track mobility, the neutral turn and steering is achieved by changing the direction of rotation and by varying the speed of the tracks (30) on sides of the outer base leg assembly (10) respectively.<br>
Fig.4 shows the suspension (34), sprocket (32), wheel (31) and track assemblies are integrated on the outer base leg assembly (10) in such a way to provide the tracking mobility to the robot (1). The outer base leg assembly (10) has been designed in such a<br>
way that in-front of the robot (1) where slope (15) facilitates approach angle to the track (30). The track assembly is located in compact without hindering the freedom of the legs<br>
Method of operation in sliding and tracking mode:<br>
Fig.5-8 illustrates schematic view representing principles for translations with legs of the robot {1).<br>
Outer base leg assembly (10) and inner base leg assembly (20) have been utilized for the sliding of the mobile robot. Whenever sliding, one base leg is supported on ground and other base legs will move longitudinally. Rotation during walking is effected by rotating the outer base leg assembly (10) with respect to the inner base leg assembly (20).<br>
Initially all the legs are in contact with the ground (26). Then ihe Inner base leg assembly (20) is lifted up from the ground (26) and moved forward b\ the linear actuator (23). After this, these Inner base legs (24) move downward to touch the ground (26). Upon ensuring the contact of the inner legs (24) having foots with the ground (26). the Outer-base leg assembly (14) is lifted up and is moved forward by the linear actuator (23); thereafter the outer base leg assembly (14) is moved downward to make contact with the ground (26).<br>
Fig.9 Represents the position of legs during the tracks locomotion, initially all legs are touching the ground (26), whenever the crawling movement is required the whole robot body is lowered by the legs till track (30) touches the ground. Once the track is ground contacted all legs are lifted up. Now, rotating the sprocket (32) for crawling controls the robot movement.<br>
Fig. 10-11 illustrates the stair climbing and vertical obstacle of robot (1) with legs and tracks (30), Stair climbing and vertical obstacle obtained by means of sliding and crawling are provided in the following description.<br>
The robot (1) with the combined actions of legs (14) of the outer base leg assembly (10) and track (30) in specified sequence achieves stair climbing movement. The trench and vertical obstacle crossing has been carried-out by the tracks (30). however, in some<br>
situations where the vertical obstacle are very high, legs (14) rotate in pitch so that the front portion get lift facilitating further tracks (30) to get ground contact for further manoeuvering.<br>
Fig. 12-13. illustrates the turning of robot (1) with legs and tracks, since the whole outer base leg assembly (10) is mounted on a rotary actuator (25) of the inner base (20). turning on sliding locomotion is achieved by rotating the outer base leg assembly (10) with respect to the inner base leg assembly (20). Turning is achieved b\ skid driving mechanism for the crawling mobility. There is a separate drive for respective tracks (30).<br>

Changes, variations and modifications to the basic design may be made without departing from the inventive concepts in this invention. In addition, these changes, variations and modifications would be obvious to those skilled in the art having the benefit of the foregoing teachings. All such changes, variations and modifications are intended to be within the scope of this invention. The technology of the instant Application explained with the examples should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
