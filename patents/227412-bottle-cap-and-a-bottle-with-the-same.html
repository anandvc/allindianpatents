				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a bottle cap, and more particularly, to a bottle cap that has tamper indication means and can be opened with a simple operation by one hand and a bottle with the same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The product containing beverage or the like to be sold generally ha.s a tamper indication means for providing the means for confirming the first opening thereof. The tamper indication means is a means for providing con fidence that the hottle containing the beverage, drug or the like is provided to the consumer without any prior experience of opening, which is required to have the construction that cannot be opened without the trace of opening such as the cutting of the tamper indication means.<br>
fhere are several prior arts concerning the tamper indication means such as U.S. Patent No. 5,074,425 and No. 3,673,761 (Lcitz/CIBA-Geigy AG). Germanic Patent No. OS-14 82 603 (Teillac/ALCA S.A.), etc.<br>
HGS. 15 and 16 show a general conventional construction of the bottle cap having the tamper indication means.<br>
As shown in the drawings, the conventional bottle cap 200 is comprised of a circumferential portion 210 that is shaped to wrap up (he outer surface of the opening of a bottle and has a spiral structure (not shown) on the inner surface thereof, a cap portion 220 formed to close the upper side of the circumferential portion 210. and a tamper indication means 230.<br>
Here, the tamper indication means 230 is comprised of a band 231 that is so formed around the lower end of the circumferential portion 210 as to wrap up the outer surface of the opening of the bottle, and a plurality of connection bridges 232 that connect the band 231 and the circumferential portion 210 with each other.<br><br>
When the bottle cap 200 is first opened, the circumferential portion 210 and the band 231 arc separated from each other by cutting.<br>
Further, in order to separate the band 231 from the bottle after the connection bridges 231 are cut oil by the first opening of the bottle cap 200, there would be equipped a cut-off portion 240 that is cut off at a certain position on the band 231 and a connection pari 240 that connects the bond 231 with the lower end of the circumferential portion 210 of the bottle cap 200.<br>
The tamper indication means 230 is required only when the bottle cap 200 is first opened. Therefore, as shown in FIG. 16, the bottle cap 200 is separated from the bottle while the band 231 is hung on the bottle cap 200, and the band 231 is then removed clearly as the connection part 250 is wholly cut off by twisting it or any other manipulation. Then, the operation to assemble the bottle cap 200 with the buttle after the first opening and the operation to re-open the bottle cap 200 when the bottle cap 200 is to he re-opened are not hindered by the tamper indication means 230.<br>
Many of conventional arts about the bottle cap with the tamper indication means have been known publicly, however, all of them have the construction that the first opening of the bottle cap and the cutting off of the connection hridge are executed in a single operation in a twisting manner as above. Therefore, in order to help the twist of the bottle cap 200, a wrinkled portion for increasing the frictional force with respect to the fingers is generally formed on the outer surface of the circumferential portion 210 of the bottle cap 200.<br>
However, such a conventional bottle cap 200 that has the construction to be opened by the twist has the following problems.<br>
First, alter the bottle cap 200 is first opened, the piece of the tamper indication means 230 such as the baud 231 will remain on the opening portion of the bottle or a certain area of the bottle cap 200, which is not helpful to the closing<br><br>
or the re-opening of the bottle cap 200 but is an obstacle to such operations* so there needed an additional operation to remove it.<br>
Second, il is preferable that the cap portion 220 and the circumferential portion 210 of the bottle cap 220 include a certain amount of area to display the trademark about the content in die bottle or the advertisement, however, such an area cannot be secured in the conventional construction as the wrinkled portion for increasing the friction with respect to the finger has to be formed on the circumferential portion of the bottle cap 200.<br>
Third, since n screw structure for opening and closing by twist has to be formed on the outer surface of the opening of the bottle and the inner surface of the bottle cap 200, the height of tlie bottle cap 200 has to be greater than a certain size,<br>
hour, as a process to equip trie bottle cup 200 onto the opening of the bottle by the twist thereof is required in the manufacturing process of the product that contains the content, it is hard to simplify the manufacturing process.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Technical Problem<br>

J-IGS. 13 and 14 show another embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
As shown in FTGS, 1, 2 and 7, line bottle cap 100 according to the present invention basically has the construction that it is assembled with the adjacent portion 2 ofthe opening ofthe bottle 1, which is comprised of a circumferential portion 10 that is shaped to wrap up an outer surface of the adjacent portion 2 of the opening therein; a cap portion 20 that closes an upper side of the circumferential portion 1.0; a plurality of tamper indication portions 30 respectively extended from a central area ofthe circumferential portion 10 to a lower end thereof; a bending portion 40 thai connects upper ends ofthe respective<br><br>
tamper indication portions t30 in a line; an opening pieee portion 50 comprised of the plurality of tamper indication portions 30 and the bending portion 40, and a recess portion 70 so formed on an inner surface of the circumferential portion 10 as to prevent separation.<br>
Further, as shown n FIG. 8, the bottle 1 with which the buttle cap 100 of the above construction is assembled has the construction that the adjacent portion 2 of the opening has a cross section of Lrapezoidal shape so that the lower end of an outer surface thereof is [wider than the upper end thereof, and a protrusion 80 Tor prevent separation thaij is inserted to a recess 70 for preventing separation formed on an inner surface lof the circumferential portion 10 ofthe bottle cap 100 is formed on an outer surface ofthe adjacent portion 2 ofthe opening.<br>
In   other  words,   a  plurality  of tamper  indication   portions   30   are<br>
respectively extended from! a central area ofthe circumferential portion 10 to a<br>
lower end thereof, the bending portion 40 is formed at the upper end area ofthe<br>
tamper indication portions 3j0, and the opening piece portion 50 is formed by them,<br>
i Therefore, the user can cut, the tamper indication portion 30 (shown in FIGS. 6a<br>
and 6b) by moving the lower end of the opening piece portion 50 upward and<br>
downward around the bending portion 40 with his/her thumb while he/she is<br>
graspiny the lower part ofthe bottle cap 100 on the bottle 1, and then separate the<br><br>
bollle cap 100 from the opening of the bottle 1 (shown in FIGS. 6c and 6d), so there is provided ihc construction that the bottle cap can be opened in a simple operation with one hand even though Lhe tamper indication portion exists.<br>
Further, the recess portion 70 for preventing separation is formed on the inner surface of the circumferential portion 10 of the bottle cup 100, a protrusion SO for prevent separation. is so formed to be inserted into Lhc recess 70 for preventing separation on the outer .surface of the adjacent portion 2 of the opening of the bottle t, and the adjacent portion 2 of the opening of the bottle 1 lias the cross section of trapezoidal shape HO Lhat the lower end thereof is wider than the upper end thereof.<br>
Therefore, when lhe bottle cap 100 is pushed downward onto the bottle 1 from the upper side of the bottle I, it is easy to ussemble the bottle cap 100 with lhe bottle 1 without any [rouble since the lower opening of the bottle cap 100 is wider than the upper opening of (he. bottle 1.<br>
However, once thc;bottle I is closed by the bottle cap 100, the bottle cup 100 has to be pulled from tjhc bottle 1 while lhe circumferential portion 10 of the bottle cap 100 is pushed by the hand. Such an operation inevitably causes the pressing between the recess portion 70 for preventing separation on the inner surface of the bottle cap 100 and the protrusion 80 for preventing .separation on the outer surface of lhe bottle jt. Accordingly, the bottle cap 100 cannot be opened without the cutting of the ilamper indication portion 30, and consequently, the<br>
boiile 1 is endowed with Lhej confidence about the first opening.<br>
i<br>
Moreover, in orderjlo guarantee the effect of preventing separation of the<br>
boitle cap 100 from the bottle 1, it is preferable that the recess portion 70 for<br>
i<br>
preventing separation is formed to a ring shape along the inner surface of the circumferential portion 10. and it is more preferable lhat plural recess portions 70 are formed on upper and lower areas of the inner surface of the circumferential<br><br>
portion 10.<br>
l"hc present invention does not employ the opening method of twisting manner described above, so il is possible to secure the area for the advertisement Or the like as tlie additional"fricliun structure is nol required on the circumferential portion 10 of the bottle cap 100, it is possible to reduce the height of the entire bottle cap 100 to reduce the costs as an additional screw structure or the like is not<br><br>
required on the inner surface of the circumferential portion 10 of the bottle cap 100, and it is also possible to increase the productivity as the manufacturing process can be simplified by a simple downward press process without the twist of the bottle cap 100 in equippmg the bottle cap 100 onto the bottle 1.<br>
Furthermore, the |hottle cap 100 of the present invention has the construction that the bottle cap 100 can be opened by applying only a simple upward movement with one hand to the opening piece portion 50, wherein the<br>
reduction of the height of the entire bottle cap 100 can provide a side effect to<br>
i<br>
make such an opening operation easier.<br>
i<br>
In such a situation.1 the number of the tamper indication portions 30 is not limited to a specific number if it is greater than two since they are formed along the circumferenlial portion 10 of the bottle cap 100 to form the opening piece portion 50, however, two  that are spaced from each other arc preferable in consideration of the manufacturing costs.<br>
Furthermore, since the present invention has the construction that the<br>
opening piece portion 50 formed by cutting off the tamper indication portions 30 is<br><br>
moved upward, it is profitable that the lower end of the opening piece portion 50 is wide in order to secure the contacting urea of the finger on the opening piece portion 50 and Ihe bending portion 40 lhat is the axis of the upward movement of<br><br>
the opening piece portion 50 is narrow in order 10 secure the smooth bending. :l hercfore, it is profitable that the upper end of the opening piece portion 50 that<br><br>
forms the bending portion 40 is narrow.<br>
Accordingly, in order lo form the above construction of the opening piece portion 50, it is preferable That the interval between the iowcr ends of two tamper indication portions 30 constituting the opening piece portion 50 is wider than that<br>
of the upper ends thereof.  .<br>
i<br>
The tamper indication portions 30 is used for confirming whether the<br>
bottle cap has ever been opened or nol, and in FTGS. 1  and 2, il is comprised of<br>
tamper indication recesses ji] formed by partially cutting away the circumferential<br>
portion   10; and a plurality of connection bridges 32 that connect the tamper<br>
indication recesses 31 so as to be cut off as the bottle cap 100 is opened, however,<br>
that is merely a general example and it is not limited to any type of construction if<br>
the opening piece portion 50 can be formed by cutting two tamper indication<br>
portions 30.<br>
FIGS. 3 through 6 show the second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in the figures, an opening knob 51 protruding outward of the outer side of the opening piece portion 50 is additionally provided.<br>
Such a construction is aimed, when the user operates the opening piece portion 50 to move upward while one of his/her lingers is in contact with the tower end of the opening piece ponton 50 in order to first open the bottle cap 100 of the present invention, to enlarge the contacting urea between the finger and the<br>
opening piece portion 50 for the convenience of opening operation.<br>
i i<br>
Further, the bottle cap 100 is perfectly opened by moving the opening piece portion 50 continuously around the axis of bending portion 40 after cutting off the tamper indication portions 30, and in such a situation, in order to transmit the upward force of the opening piece portion 50 lo the overall bottle cap 1 00 more effectively, it is preferable that a supporting protrusion 60 is additionally provided which is so formed above the opening piece portion 50 on the outer surface of the<br><br>
circumferential portion 10 as to be contacted with the opening knob 51 of the opening piece portion 50 wlhile the opening piece portion 50 is moved upward by ihe culling of the connection bridges 32.<br>
Further, in order to enhance the efficiency Lo transmit the power during the opening operation, it is required to prevent the sliding between the fingers and the opening knob 51 and" between the opening knob 51 and the supporting protrusion 60, so it is preferable that a means for generating friction is additionally employed on the outer surface of the opening knob 51 and the supporting protrusion 60-<br>
In this situation, the friction generating means can be realized by a knurling for generating the i"rictioiial force on the finger when the opening knob 51 is pushed by the finger, and any kinds of friction generating methods such as to make the surface rough, to form protrusions, or the like can be employed. However, the present embodiment exemplifies the wrinkled portion formed horizontally as an example pf the knurling,<br>
FIG. 6 shows the operation of the present embodiment.<br>
Ihe opening mechanism of the bottle cap 100 according to the present invention is illustrated with reference to the drawing.<br>
When the user moves the opening- knob 51 of the opening piece portion 50 upwind while the end of his/her thumb is in contact with the opening knob 51 (FIG. 6a), the tamper indication portions 30 arc cut off (FIG. 6b), and then the opening knob 51 is contacted with the supporting protrusion 60, by which the bottom side of the thumb is naturally contacted with the cut-offside of the opening knob 51 (FIG. 6c). The upward force by the thumb generates the twisting moment on the entire bottle cap 100 according to the above construction (FIG. OdJ, whereby the power can be transmitted more effectively.<br>
Next, the closing mechanism of the bottle cap  100 according to the<br><br>
present invention is illustrated.<br>
FTGS- 7 through 12 illustrate such an operation.<br>
The bottle cap 10Q of the present invention is opened and closed not by the twisting manner but only by the upward force of one finger, so the closing operation is also performed by such a manner as to push down the bottle cap 100 from the right above of the opening of the bottle 1.<br>
Fur the stable assembly of the bottle cap 100, a protrusion 80 for preventing separation that is inserted to a recess 70 for preventing separation formed on un inner surface1 of the circumferential portion 10 of the bottle cap 100 is formed on an outer surface of the adjacent portion 2 of the opening of the bottle, the circumferential portion 10 is formed by an elastic material so that the area of the opening at the lower end (hereof can be changed, and the adjueent portion 2 of the bottle is so formed to have the cross section of trapezoidal shape that the lower end of the outer surface thereofis wider than the upper end thereof,<br>
Accordingly, as the bottle cap 300 is pushed to be assembled, the inner surface of the circumferential portion 10 of the bottle cap 100 that is made of elastic material presses the puter surface of the adjacent portion 2 of the opening of the botlle 1  so as to strengthen the assembly between the protrusion SO for<br>
preventing separation and the recess 70 for preventing separation, whereby the<br>
i<br>
separation of the bottle cap 100 is prevented and the stable assembly can be achieved.<br>
The circumferential portion 10 of the bottle cap 100 can be. constituted to have the cross section of rectangular shape or trapezoidal shape, and if the bottle 1 of trapezoidal cross section is employed, the Jowcr end of the circumierential portion 10 is expanded elastieally to result in the trapezoidal shape of bottle cap 100 after being assembled with the bottle 1.<br>
Accordingly, in order to have the rectangular shape alter the bottle cup<br><br>
100 is assembled with the ■bottle 1, as shown in FIG. 9, it is preferable that the thickness of the upper part of the circumferential portion 10 of the bottle cap 100 is greater than the lower part thereof.<br>
When such a construction is employed, the thickness of the tamper indication portions 30 becomes thin ai the lower area of the circumferential portion 10 of the bottle cap 100 and the thickness thereof becomes relatively thick at the upper ureu thereof, by which an additional effect is achieved that the tamper indication portions 30 can he cut off more easily.<br>
Further, in such a construction, in order to transmit, the downward force applied to the cap portion 2p of the bottle cap 100 to the circumferential portion 10 of the bottle cup 100 effectively, it is preferable that a closing knob 21 protruding upward at a central area from the upper side of the cap portion 20 is additionally provided.<br>
In such a situation^ it is preferable that a recess portion 22 tor increasing elastic force is formed on the inner side of the closing knob 21.<br>
As shown in FIG, 11, according to such a construction, the lower end of the cireurnferential portion 10 is easily opened elastically when the closing of the bottle cap 100 is started (designated by solid arrow), and the inner surface of the circumferential portion 100 of the bottle cap 100 is naturally pressed elastically onto the outer surface of the bottle I by the rising up of the closing knob 21 after the closing of the bottle cap 100 is finished (designated by dotted arrow).<br>
Meanwhile, FIGS." 13 and 14 show another embodiment of the present invention, which are the drawings simitar to the above FIGS. 6a. and 6d, rfi.speu lively.<br>
In the present embodiment, a cut-away portion 61 is formed on the circumferential portion 10. The cut-away portion 61 is preferably formed on the side opposite to the opening knob 50 on the circumferential portion 10, and is<br><br>
formed by cutting away the lower end area of the circumferential portion 10 at certain size and shape, As such a cut-away portion 61 is formed, when the opening knob 51 is pushed by finger as shown in FIG. 13 lo open Ihe bottle cap 100, the bottle cap 100 pivots ubout the upper edge of the cut-away purlion 61 as shown in FIG. 14. Accordingly, in comparison with the case that the cut-away portion 61 does not exist, the pivoting axis of the bottle cap 100 is located at the higher position on the circumferential portion 10 to make it easy to pivot the bottle cap 1 (JO, and therefore, it is easier to open the bottle cap 100,<br>
Meanwhile, the present embodiment shows the example that only a single opening piece portion 50 is formed, however, as a modification of the present embodiment, u plurality of opening piece portions 50 can he formed on positions different from each other oii the circumferential portion 10. In such a situation, the arrangement of the opening piece portions 50 can be modified to a variety of manners such as to form on the opposite sides on the circumferential portion 10, or to form three or more opening piece portions 50 in a radial manner.<br>
