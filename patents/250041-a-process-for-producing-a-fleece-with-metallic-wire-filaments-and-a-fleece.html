Joining of metallic wire filaments to form fleeces to<br>
produce honeycomb bodies<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
producing a fleece comprising metallic wire filaments,<br>
and to a process for producing a honeycomb body having<br>
at least one fleece, and also to a fleece having a<br>
multiplicity of metallic wire filaments and a honeycomb<br>
body formed therewith.<br>
Metallic fiber fleeces are used, for example, as filter<br>
material for exhaust gases from stationary and mobile<br>
internal combustion engines. They are used in<br>
particular to retain particulates (ash, soot, etc.)<br>
contained in the exhaust gas, these particulates being<br>
at least partially retained by the fiber fleece and<br>
being chemically converted, if appropriate using a<br>
catalyst. On account of the high thermal and dynamic<br>
stresses on the fiber fleeces, in particular in exhaust<br>
systems of mobile internal combustion engines of, for<br>
example, vehicles, boats, etc., particular demands are<br>
imposed on a fiber fleece of this type with regard to<br>
their long-term strength; in particular, permanent<br>
connection of the fibers to one another is necessary.<br>
Fiber fleeces of this type are produced, for example,<br>
by welding or by forming sintered connections between<br>
the wire filaments.<br>
When producing the fleeces, it is necessary to take<br>
into account the fact that under certain circumstances<br>
they also need to be joined to further components in<br>
order ultimately to form an exhaust-gas treatment<br>
device. For this purpose, it is on occasion necessary<br>
for a specific shape to be imparted to the fiber<br>
fleece. However, the desired shaping is impeded by the<br>
connections which have been formed between the fibers,<br>
and consequently considerable difficulties have arisen<br>
in series production with a view to manufacture of<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
exhaust-gas treatment units of this type. For example,<br>
additional handling tools of special configuration are<br>
required, and on account of the poor formability of the<br>
smooth fiber fleeces, these tools are also subject to<br>
considerable wear. Moreover, there is a risk of the<br>
fiber fleece tearing uncontrollably at various<br>
locations, in which case under certain circumstances<br>
fibers may subsequently become detached in the exhaust<br>
system.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to at least<br>
partially alleviate the technical problems which have<br>
been outlined in connection with the prior art. In<br>
particular, it is an object to specify a process for<br>
producing a metallic fleece which allows simple series<br>
production even of exhaust-gas treatment units.<br>
Furthermore, it is intended to specify a process for<br>
producing a honeycomb body which involves using a<br>
metallic fleece which can be subjected to accurate<br>
shaping even for series production. Finally, it is also<br>
intended to propose a fleece which makes it easy to<br>
produce honeycomb bodies and apparatuses for exhaust-<br>
gas treatment.<br>
These objects are achieved by the process for producing<br>
a fleece having the features of patent claim 1, the<br>
process for producing a honeycomb body having the<br>
features of patent claim 6 and the fleece having the<br>
features of patent claim 9. Further advantageous<br>
configurations of the invention are described in the<br>
dependent patent claims. It should be noted that the<br>
features listed individually in the patent claims can<br>
be combined with one another in any technologically<br>
appropriate way so as to form further configurations of<br>
the invention.<br>
The process according to the invention for producing a<br>
fleece comprising metallic wire filaments comprises at<br>
least the following steps:<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
a)	forming a layer comprising wire filaments;<br>
b)	producing first cohesive connections between at<br>
least some of the metallic wire filaments using a<br>
first joining process;<br>
c)	producing second cohesive connections between<br>
metallic wire filaments using a second joining<br>
process.<br>
A "fleece" is to be understood in particular as meaning<br>
a sheet-like structure in which the wire filaments that<br>
form the fleece can be arranged in ordered fashion or<br>
randomly with respect to one another. Examples of a<br>
fleece include woven fabrics, grid structures, knitted<br>
fabrics, irregular layers, etc. The fleece may in<br>
principle also comprise at least one filler, such as<br>
for example other types of fleeces, powders or the<br>
like, with the latter ultimately being captively<br>
connected to the fleece. The fleece is formed by wire<br>
filaments which comprise a corrosion-resistant material<br>
which is able to withstand high temperatures. The "wire<br>
filament" is a term used to signify in particular an<br>
element of elongate length and in particular also<br>
encompasses elements in wire form, elements in chip<br>
form and similar elements. The metallic wire filaments<br>
in particular comprise a material which substantially<br>
comprises steel as base material, preferably with high<br>
chromium contents (e.g. in a range from 18 to 21% by<br>
weight) and/or aluminum contents (e.g. at least 4.5% by<br>
weight, in particular at least 5.5% by weight). In<br>
principle, aluminized wire filaments can also be used.<br>
These metallic wire filaments are preferably designed<br>
with a filament length in the range from 0.1 to 50 mm<br>
(in particular in a range from 1 to 10 mm) and a<br>
filament diameter in the range from 0.01 to 0.1 mm (in<br>
particular in a range from 0.02 to 0.05 mm). The weight<br>
per unit area of a fleece of this type is preferably in<br>
the range from 750 to 1500 g/m2. The porosity of the<br>
fleece that is to be produced is preferably in a range<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
from 3 0% to 80%, in particular in a range from 45% to<br>
60%.<br>
According to step a) , first of all a layer comprising<br>
wire filaments is formed. This is to be understood as<br>
meaning in particular that the wire filaments are<br>
arranged in a loose assembly against and/or on top of<br>
one another. For this purpose, the wire filaments<br>
(random or oriented) are placed, for example, on a<br>
support, so that the wire filaments are in contact with<br>
one another. The layer is formed until a desired layer<br>
thickness, a specified layer weight and/or a desired<br>
porosity is present. The layer therefore represents the<br>
starting component for the fleece, without any cohesive<br>
connections yet being present between the wire<br>
filaments.<br>
In step b) , first cohesive connections are produced<br>
between at least some of the metallic wire filaments<br>
using a first joining process. The first cohesive<br>
connections are designed in such a way that the fleece<br>
can still be readily shaped, in particular can still be<br>
wound helically, wound in a S shape or deformed in a<br>
similar way. It is preferable for the majority of the<br>
metallic wire filaments to have already been connected<br>
to one another by the first joining process, preferably<br>
at least 80% of the wire filaments. Furthermore, it is<br>
preferable for at least some of the metallic wire<br>
filaments to have a plurality of first cohesive<br>
connections to adjacent wire filaments, which should be<br>
the case in particular for at least 40% of the wire<br>
filaments. It is very particularly preferable for step<br>
b) to be executed such that cohesive connections with<br>
regard to a metallic wire filament are formed only in a<br>
subregion of the wire filament which is significantly<br>
smaller than the filament length; by way of example,<br>
these first cohesive connections are formed only in a<br>
subregion amounting to less than 20% (in particular<br>
less than 5%) of the filament length.<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
With this type of configuration of the first cohesive<br>
connections, there is only a relatively small or<br>
reduced number of cohesive connections or connection<br>
points stiffening the fleece, so that on the one hand<br>
it is ensured that the fleece is transportable and even<br>
also deformable, but on the other hand the risk of<br>
insufficient anchoring or fixing of a significant<br>
proportion of the wire filaments is avoided. The first<br>
joining process is preferably a joining process<br>
selected from the group consisting of manufacturing<br>
processes relating to joining by welding and joining by<br>
soldering. In principle, it is possible to work with or<br>
without filler.<br>
Then, in a further step c), second cohesive connections<br>
are produced between the metallic wire filaments using<br>
a second joining process. In other words, this means in<br>
particular that the formation of the first and second<br>
cohesive connections takes place locally and temporally<br>
separately. During the second joining process,<br>
additional second cohesive connections or connection<br>
points are generated, which lead to further stiffening<br>
of the fleece. In particular, a first flexural strength<br>
after step b) (maximum force occurring during bending<br>
of the fleece (width: 50 mm) up to a bending angle of<br>
90° with a free bending length of 2 0 mm) is<br>
considerably lower than a second flexural strength<br>
after step c) has been carried out, the second flexural<br>
strength preferably being at least 50%, in particular<br>
100% greater than the first flexural strength. Since<br>
the absolute flexural strength value is dependent on<br>
the specific configuration of the fleece, it is<br>
possible here, purely by way of example (0.3 mm fleece<br>
thickness 0.022 mm filament diameter, 85% porosity), to<br>
specify a value for the flexural strength. The first<br>
flexural strength is in this case in a range from 600<br>
to 12 00 mN and preferably below 1000 mN, whereas after<br>
step c) by way of example a second flexural strength of<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
at least 1500 mn is produced. After step c) , it is<br>
preferable for at least 90% of all the wire filaments<br>
to have at least one first and/or at least one second<br>
cohesive connection.<br>
The process proposed here proposes two-stage generation<br>
of the desired fleece property in terms of its<br>
structural integrity. This opens up the possibility of<br>
the fleece first of all being brought into a readily<br>
shapeable state, then being deformed into its final<br>
shape and finally acquiring its ultimately desired<br>
rigidity in a subsequent joining process. This allows,<br>
for example, the production of structured fleeces which<br>
are ultimately able to withstand the high dynamic and<br>
thermal stresses in the exhaust system of mobile<br>
internal combustion engines for a prolonged period of<br>
time.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed that a welding process be<br>
used as first joining process to carry out step b) . It<br>
is very particularly preferable for resistance welding<br>
processes to be used to form the first cohesive<br>
connections. In this context, what is known as roller<br>
seam welding, in which at least two roller-like<br>
electrodes are arranged on either side of the fleece,<br>
has proven particularly suitable. Applying a voltage to<br>
the electrodes and bringing them into contact with the<br>
wire filament layer leads to the formation of cohesive<br>
connections between the metallic wire filaments. On<br>
account of the spatially delimited zone of action of<br>
the welding process, first cohesive connections are<br>
also generated only in relatively locally limited<br>
subregions of the layer or fleece. This allows the<br>
desired fleece property to be set in a targeted fashion<br>
for further treatment of the fleece.<br>
According to a further configuration of the process, it<br>
is proposed that a high-temperature treatment of the<br>
fleece to form sintered connections be used as second<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
joining process to carry out step c). In this case, it<br>
is very particularly preferable for the fleece to be<br>
exposed to a temperature of over 800°C, in particular<br>
over 1100°C. The environment surrounding the fleece can<br>
in this case be realized with a vacuum and/or a<br>
shielding gas atmosphere. The second cohesive<br>
connections are in particular characterized by what are<br>
known as sinter necks, which form as a result of<br>
surface diffusion between the metallic wire filaments.<br>
The second cohesive connections are usually positioned<br>
in the region of contact between adjacently fixed wire<br>
filaments.<br>
According to a further configuration of the process,<br>
step b) comprises forming a connection plan, so that at<br>
least one anisotropic fleece property is produced. An<br>
"anisotropic" configuration of a property is to be<br>
understood in particular as meaning that the extent of<br>
this property differs significantly as seen in<br>
different directions of the fleece. This means, for<br>
example, that the fleece after step b) is flexurally<br>
rigid in one direction and flexurally yielding in<br>
another direction. To achieve this, it is proposed that<br>
a connection plan be formed. A "connection plan" is to<br>
be understood as meaning a predetermined arrangement of<br>
zones of first cohesive connections. This connection<br>
plan may comprise a plurality of zones of first<br>
cohesive connections arranged in a defined way with<br>
respect to one another such that they form a type of<br>
pattern. The connection plan can be formed with a<br>
plurality of zones, at least some of which are parallel<br>
to one another and/or at least some of which cross one<br>
another. The specific configuration of the connection<br>
plan is dependent mainly on the type of deformation of<br>
the fleece which is still desired. The different<br>
configuration of the connection plan allows in<br>
particular the following fleece properties to be made<br>
anisotropic: flexural strength, strength, cold-<br>
formability, tensile strength.<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
According to a further configuration of the process, at<br>
least one of the following steps is carried out between<br>
step b) and step c) :<br>
transporting the fleece,<br>
deforming the fleece,<br>
coating the fleece.<br>
During transporting of the fleece, the fleece is, for<br>
example, removed from a support or moved together with<br>
the support to a different location. In this context,<br>
it is also possible for the fleece to be at least<br>
partially elastically deformed, rotated, etc. The<br>
deformation of the fleece comprises, for example, the<br>
introduction of openings, winding of the fleece,<br>
twisting and/or structuring of the fleece. During the<br>
deformation of the fleece, it is preferable to effect a<br>
permanent, plastic deformation of the sheet-like<br>
structure to form a more complex structure, for example<br>
in the manner of a spiral, a cylinder, with a<br>
corrugated or zigzag shape, etc. The coating of the<br>
fleece may comprise the application of a filler, with<br>
this filler being temporarily or permanently fixed to<br>
the fleece. A temporary coating could, for example,<br>
comprise attaching an adhesive for fixing further<br>
components or a powder (solder, filter material, etc.).<br>
One example of a permanent coating is the application<br>
of any additional material comprising at least one<br>
alloying element which is at least partially introduced<br>
into the surface of the fleece, if appropriate at the<br>
same time as step c) is being carried out.<br>
A further aspect of the invention proposes a process<br>
for producing a honeycomb body having at least one<br>
fleece comprising a multiplicity of metallic wire<br>
filaments, which comprises at least the following<br>
steps:<br>
w) forming a layer of wire filaments;<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
x) producing first cohesive connections between at<br>
least some of the metallic wire filaments using a<br>
first joining process;<br>
y) arranging at least one fleece so as to form a<br>
honeycomb body;<br>
z) producing second cohesive connections between<br>
metallic wire filaments using a second joining<br>
process.<br>
A honeycomb body is characterized in particular by the<br>
fact that it is designed with a multiplicity of<br>
passages, which are usually arranged substantially<br>
parallel to one another and at least some of which a<br>
fluid can flow through. Honeycomb bodies of this type<br>
are used, for example, to remove pollutants from<br>
exhaust gases from mobile internal combustion engines.<br>
The honeycomb bodies serve, for example, as supports<br>
for a catalytically active coating and/or as a<br>
particulate trap. At least one fleece comprising a<br>
multiplicity of metallic wire filaments is provided<br>
here for building up the honeycomb structure. For<br>
details as to the production of the wire filament<br>
fleece (steps w) and x) ) , reference should be made to<br>
the explanations given above in connection with steps<br>
a) and b).<br>
After the first cohesive connections have been<br>
produced, according to step y) the process step of<br>
arranging at least one fleece so as to form a honeycomb<br>
body takes place. This arranging step comprises, for<br>
example, deforming the fleece, aligning the fleece with<br>
respect to further components of the honeycomb body<br>
(such as for example additional sheet-metal foils),<br>
integrating the fleece in a housing, and the like. It<br>
is preferable for step y) to be carried out in such a<br>
way that the desired configuration of the honeycomb<br>
body having the at least one fleece is present, and<br>
finally in step z) the desired long-term strength or<br>
rigidity of the fleece or honeycomb body is realized.<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
It is in this context particularly advantageous for<br>
step y) to encompass the assembly of the at least one<br>
fleece with other metallic components, and for cohesive<br>
connections also to be formed between at least some of<br>
the components during step z) . Further metallic<br>
components, which may form part of a honeycomb body,<br>
include, for example, a metallic housing, at least one<br>
metal foil (which likewise at least partially delimits<br>
passages) and metallic connection elements which, for<br>
example, allow a plurality of fleeces to be connected<br>
to one another and/or close off at least some of the<br>
passages in the honeycomb body. In connection with step<br>
y) , the intention is in particular the alternate<br>
stacking of a smooth fleece and a corrugated metal<br>
foil, which are then wound and/or intertwined to form a<br>
honeycomb body. This assembly made up of metal foil and<br>
fleece is then inserted into a housing, which takes<br>
place with a prestress which is such that the assembly<br>
made up of fleece and metal foil is temporarily fixed.<br>
In this arrangement of the components with respect to<br>
one another, second cohesive connections are then<br>
formed during step z).<br>
It is in this context also advantageous for step z) to<br>
comprise a soldering process (specifically what is<br>
known as "brazing") carried out at temperatures above<br>
800°C and under vacuum. It is in this context<br>
advantageous for at least subregions of the components<br>
to be provided with a soldering material, which then<br>
forms further cohesive connections between at least<br>
some of the components. Therefore, during step z) , on<br>
the one hand the fleece is stiffened by the formation<br>
of second cohesive connections between the wire<br>
filaments, and at the same time a connection is<br>
produced between the components. The brazing process<br>
described here preferably takes place at temperatures<br>
above 1000°C. This process step also improves the<br>
quality or strength of the connections.<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
A further aspect of the invention proposes a fleece<br>
having a multiplicity of metallic wire filaments, some<br>
of the wire filaments being cohesively connected to one<br>
another according with a connection plan, so that the<br>
fleece has at least one anisotropic fleece property.<br>
With regard to the anisotropy, reference is made to the<br>
explanations given above. The at least one fleece<br>
property comprises at least one of the following<br>
properties of the fleece: flexural strength, strength,<br>
cold-formability, tensile strength.<br>
The starting point here is in particular that the wire<br>
filaments are arranged randomly with respect to one<br>
another. It is in principle possible for the fleece<br>
also to be formed using oriented or ordered wire<br>
filaments, so that, for example, the arrangement of<br>
these filaments already produces an anisotropy.<br>
Nevertheless, the preferred option here is a fleece in<br>
which the wire filaments are arranged randomly with<br>
respect to one another and the anisotropy has been<br>
produced by specially formed first cohesive<br>
connections. Accordingly, the fleece can be produced in<br>
particular by the above process which has been<br>
described in accordance with the invention.<br>
The invention also proposes a honeycomb body comprising<br>
a plurality of passages, the passages at least<br>
partially being formed by a fleece of the type<br>
described above. In this context, a single fleece is<br>
preferably used to delimit a plurality of passages, and<br>
in the case of a helical structure of the honeycomb<br>
body it is even possible for a single fleece to<br>
partially delimit all the passages at least in part.<br>
The invention also proposes an apparatus for exhaust-<br>
gas treatment, comprising at least one fleece of the<br>
type according to the invention, at least one fleece<br>
produced by a process according to the invention, or at<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
least one honeycomb body of the type mentioned above.<br>
The exhaust gas to be purified at least partially flows<br>
through this apparatus, with solid particulates at<br>
least in part accumulating in or on the fleece. This<br>
apparatus is preferably designed as a filter or<br>
particulate trap.<br>
Therefore, it is particularly advantageous for a<br>
vehicle comprising an internal combustion engine to be<br>
combined with at least one apparatus of the above type.<br>
The vehicle is preferably a truck or passenger car, in<br>
which case the apparatus is integrated in its exhaust<br>
system. The internal combustion engine is, for example,<br>
a spark-ignition engine or a diesel engine.<br>

Fig. 6 shows a vehicle with an exhaust-gas-treatment<br>
apparatus.<br>
Fig. 1 provides a diagrammatic and perspective<br>
illustration of a fleece 1 which is formed by a<br>
multiplicity of metallic wire filaments 2. The fleece 1<br>
has first cohesive connections 4, which together form a<br>
connection plan 6. In the variant embodiment<br>
illustrated, some of the first cohesive connections 4<br>
are formed as a parallel line, in particular a weld<br>
seam, this connection plan 6 being crossed by a<br>
"zigzag"-like configuration of a further first cohesive<br>
connection 4. If the fleece is considered in a state in<br>
which second cohesive connections 5 have not yet been<br>
generated, the fleece 1 has anisotropic fleece<br>
properties. The anisotropy is configured to be<br>
different in particular in the direction of the fleece<br>
thickness 17 (z direction) or in its plane (x direction<br>
and y direction). It is very particularly preferable<br>
for an anisotropy to be formed with regard to the x and<br>
y directions, so that the fleece 1 is, for example,<br>
flexurally yielding in the x direction and flexurally<br>
rigid in the y direction. The weld seams illustrated<br>
may have a width of up to 100 mm, in which case the<br>
distance between the adjacent weld seams may be<br>
designed to be smaller than the width of the weld<br>
seams. The term weld seam is used to describe a zone<br>
with a high number of cohesive connections, in<br>
particular compared to the layer or fleece before and<br>
after a welding operation.<br>
Figure 2 now shows a detail of the fleece from figure 1<br>
at a time when second cohesive connections 5 have been<br>
formed. The second cohesive connections 5 are<br>
preferably formed as sintered connections which are<br>
produced in contact regions of the wire filaments 2.<br>
The wire filaments 2 advantageously have a filament<br>
length 16 in the range from 1 to 10 mm and a filament<br>
diameter 15 in the range from 0.02 to 0.05 mm. On<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
account of the random arrangement of the wire filaments<br>
2 with respect to one another, pores 18 are formed,<br>
allowing the fleece 1 to be gas-permeable. The porosity<br>
of the fleece is in the range from, for example, 45% to<br>
6 0%. After first cohesive connections 4 and second<br>
cohesive connections 5 have been formed, the anisotropy<br>
which was previously present is greatly reduced or no<br>
longer significant. In this context, it should<br>
fundamentally be pointed out that the fleece properties<br>
relate to the actual fleece and not to its assembly<br>
with further components which may influence the<br>
rigidity.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a variant embodiment of the process<br>
for producing a fleece 1. Wire filaments 2 are placed<br>
by means of a distributor 19 onto a support 3 5 (if<br>
appropriate designed as a conveyor belt), so as to form<br>
a layer 3 comprising wire filaments 2. When the desired<br>
composition of the layer 3 is present, this loose<br>
assembly of wire filaments 2 is provided, in a further<br>
step, with first cohesive connections by means of a<br>
first joining process, so as to generate a fleece 1. In<br>
the variant embodiment illustrated, the joining process<br>
is carried out by means of a welding installation 20,<br>
with the sketched illustration showing a roller seam<br>
welding process (resistance welding). After the fleece<br>
1 with anisotropic fleece properties has been formed,<br>
it is possible to carry out various further process<br>
steps for producing, for example, a honeycomb body,<br>
before the second cohesive connections 5 are finally<br>
produced in a further process step (illustrated on the<br>
right-hand side of fig. 3) . In the illustration, this<br>
is done by means of a furnace 21 in which, for example,<br>
temperatures of over 1000°C are present, with sintered<br>
connections being formed between the wire filaments 2.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates a variant embodiment of a honeycomb<br>
body 7 having a fleece 1. The honeycomb body 7 has a<br>
multiplicity of passages 11 through which an exhaust<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
gas can flow in a direction of flow 23. The passages 11<br>
are delimited on the one hand by a fleece 1 and on the<br>
other hand by metal foils 9. The metal foils 9 are in<br>
structured form with corrugation peaks 25 and<br>
corrugation valleys 26. Flow-influencing means 24,<br>
which project into inner regions of the passages 11,<br>
are provided for the purpose of influencing the<br>
direction of flow 23 of the exhaust gas and/or of the<br>
particulates 22 contained therein. Therefore, some of<br>
the exhaust gas is diverted toward the fleece 1, with<br>
the particulates 22 accumulating at the wire filaments<br>
2 of the fleece 1.<br>
A further configuration of a honeycomb body 7 as what<br>
is known as a "wall-flow filter" is illustrated in fig.<br>
5. This honeycomb body 7 likewise has a plurality of<br>
passages 11 which are closed on alternate sides. The<br>
passages 11 in turn are at least partially formed by a<br>
fleece 1, it being possible for exhaust gas to enter<br>
inner regions of the honeycomb body 7 in a direction of<br>
flow 23, and this exhaust gas, as a result of the<br>
positioning of connection elements 10 at the end sides<br>
36, being forced to penetrate fully through the fleece<br>
1. To prevent blockages, it is possible to provide<br>
openings 27 in the fleece 1, constituting a type of<br>
bypass, if the fleeces 1, on account of a high level of<br>
accumulated particulates, form an excessively high flow<br>
resistance to the exhaust gas. This honeycomb body 7 is<br>
arranged in a metallic housing 8 and is preferably<br>
soldered to it.<br>
Finally, fig. 6 illustrates a preferred intended use of<br>
the fleece 1 or the honeycomb body 7. This figure<br>
illustrates a motor vehicle 13 having an internal<br>
combustion engine 14. The internal combustion engine 14<br>
generates an exhaust gas which is at least partially<br>
purified by means of the exhaust system 29 illustrated.<br>
For this purpose, the exhaust gas first of all flows<br>
through a primary catalytic converter 28. It then flows<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
through an oxidation catalytic converter 3 0 and an<br>
apparatus 12 for exhaust-gas treatment, which is<br>
designed here as a particulate trap 31. The combination<br>
of an oxidation catalytic converter 30 and a<br>
particulate trap 31, by virtue of the provision of<br>
nitrogen oxides, allows continuous regeneration of the<br>
particulate trap 31, so that if appropriate it is<br>
possible to dispense with thermal regeneration, i.e.<br>
burning off of soot constituents. The exhaust gas then<br>
also flows to a muffler 32 before leaving the exhaust<br>
system 29.<br><br>
