DERIVATIVES AND METHODS FOR THEIR PREPARATION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to heterobifunctional poly(ethylene glycol)<br>
derivatives and methods for their preparation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
""                     Covalent attachment of the hydrophilic polymer poly(ethylene<br>
glycol), abbreviated (PEG), also known as poly(ethylene oxide), abbreviated<br>
(PEO), to molecules and surfaces has important applications in biotechnology and<br>
medicine. In its most common form, PEG is a linear polymer having hydroxyl<br>
groups at each terminus:<br>
HO-CH2-CH2O(CH2CH2O)nCH2CH2-OH<br>
This formula can be represented in brief as HO-PEG-OH, where it is understood<br>
that -PEG- represents the polymer backbone without the terminal groups:<br>
-PEG- equals -CH2CH2O(CH2CH2O)nCH2CH2-<br>
PEG is commonly used as methoxy-PEG-OH, or mPEG in brief, in which one<br>
terminus is the relatively inert methoxy group, while the other terminus is a<br>
hydroxyl group that is subject to ready chemical modification.<br>
CH3O-(CH2CH2O)n-CH2CH2-OH<br>
It is understood by those skilled in the art that the term<br>
polyethylene glycol) or PEG represents or includes all the above forms and still<br>
others.<br>
The copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide are closely<br>
related to PEG in their chemistry, and they can be substituted for PEG in many of<br>
its applications.<br>
HO-CH2CHRO(CH2CHRO)nCH2CHR-OH<br>
R = H and CH3<br>
PEG is a useful polymer having the property of water solubility as<br>
well as solubility in many organic solvents. PEG is also non-toxic and<br>
non-immunogenic. When PEG is chemically attached to a water insoluble<br>
compound, the resulting conjugate generally is water soluble as well as soluble in<br>
many organic solvents. When the molecule to which PEG is attached is<br>
biologically active, such as a drug, this activity is commonly retained after<br>
attachment of PEG and the conjugate may display altered pharmacokinetics. For<br>
example, Bentley et al. in Polymer Preprints, 38(1), 584 (1997) demonstrated that<br>
the water insoluble antemisinin becomes water soluble and exhibits increased<br>
antimalarial activity when coupled to PEG. Davis et al. in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,179,337 have shown that proteins coupled to PEG have enhanced blood<br>
circulation lifetime because of reduced kidney clearance and reduced<br>
immunogenicity. The lack of toxicity of PEG and its rapid clearance from the<br>
body are advantageous for pharmaceutical applications.<br>
As applications of PEG chemistry have become more sophisticated,<br>
there has been an increasing need for heterobifunctional PEGs, that is PEGs<br>
bearing dissimilar terminal groups:<br>
X-PEG-Y<br>
where X and Y are different groups. PEGs having backbone ester groups and<br>
terminal groups, X and Y:<br>
X-PEG-CO2-PEG-Y<br>
can be considered to be heterobifunctional even if X and Y are the same, since<br>
each PEG unit within the backbone is substituted unsymmetrically.<br>
Such heterobifunctional PEGs bearing appropriate functional<br>
groups may be used to link the PEGs to surfaces or other polymers, such as<br>
polysaccharides or proteins, with the other terminus attached, for example, to a<br>
drug, a liposome, another protein, or a biosensor. If one terminus is bound to a<br>
polymer, and the other terminus is bonded to an appropriate functional group,<br>
cross-linking to form a useful hydrogel can occur.<br>
Utilizing existing methods, however, heterobifunctional PEGs are<br>
often difficult or impossible to prepare in high purity. For example, one could<br>
conduct the below reaction, using molar equivalents of each reagent with the goal<br>
of preparing the heterobifunctional PEG acetal product shown:<br>
HO-PEG-OH + C1CH2CH(OC2H5)2 + NaOH-----------------------?<br>
-----------------------? HO-PEG-OCH2CH(OC2H5)2+NaCl+H20<br>
In practice, however, some of the disubst ituted PEG diethyl acetal,<br>
(C2H5O)2CH2O-PEG-OCH2CH(OC2H5)2 is also inevitably formed and some<br>
unreacted PEG would also remain. Tedious chromatography would be required to<br>
separate this mixture.<br>
The chromatographic approach has been used by Zalipsky<br>
(Bioconjugate Chemistry, 4: 296-299,1993) to purify the following<br>
heterobifunctional PEG derivative:<br>
HO-PEG-CONHCH2CO2H<br>
from a reaction product mixture also containing unreacted PEG and the<br>
disubstituted carboxylic acid derivative.<br>
In certain applications, it is essential that minimum HO-PEG-OH be<br>
present in monoalkyl PEGs used to prepare monofunctional activated PEGs, since<br>
the presence of HO-PEG-OH would lead to doubly activated PEG derivatives<br>
which would result in crosslinked products or have other undesirable effects. In<br>
fact, HO-PEG-OH is a common contaminant in monoalkyl PEGs. The<br>
chromatographic approach has been disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,298,410 to<br>
separate CH3O-PEG-OH from HO-PEG-OH by forming the trityl<br>
(Ph3C-derivatives), separating the derivatives chromatographically, and removing<br>
the trityl group from CH3O-PEG-OCPh3. A recent patent application, Suzawa; et<br>
al. (WO96/3545n disclosed benzyl PEG (C6H5-CH2-OPEG-OH) as an<br>
intermediate in preparing a heterobifunctional PEG bearing a group at one<br>
terminus having affinity for a target cell and having a toxin at the other terminus.<br>
The benzyl PEG, however, was prepared by benzylation of PEG, followed by<br>
laborious extensive gradient chromatography to separate benzyl PEG from<br>
dibenzyl PEG and unreacted PEG. The procedure was done on a small scale with<br>
a yield of only 7.8%. The method thus has little value for useful commercial<br>
production.<br>
A second strategy, the polymerization approach, for preparing<br>
heterobifunctional PEGs involves anionic polymerization of ethylene oxide onto an<br>
anion, X"., which ultimately becomes the end-group of the polymer:<br><br>
X" + n                    1--------------------------? X-(CH2CH20-)n-<br>
X-(CH2CH20-)n" + H+--------------------------? X-(CH2CH20-),, H<br>
This method has been used by Yokoyama, et al. (Bioconiugate Chemistry. 3:<br>
275-276, 1992) to prepare a PEG with a hydroxyl group at one terminus and an<br>
amino group at the other. Cammas, et al. (Bioconjugate Chemistry, 6: 226-230,<br>
1995) have used this method to prepare PEGs with an amino group on one<br>
terminus and a hydroxyl or methoxy group on the other. It has also been used by<br>
Nagasaki, et al. (Biocojugate Chemistry, 6: 231-233, 1995) to prepare a PEG<br>
having a formyl group at one terminus and a hydroxyl group at the other. This<br>
method is generally useful only if X is a suitable and desired group on which to<br>
initiate polymerization; frequently this is not the case. Also, successful application<br>
of this method requires rigorous exclusion of water to prevent formation of HO-<br>
PEG-OH, and this problem becomes more severe as the molecular weight<br>
increases. It is also necessary to carefully control the degree of polymerization in<br>
order to obtain the desired molecular weight of the PEG derivative. This method is<br>
limited by the degradation of many types of drug molecules under the harsh<br>
conditions of the polymerization if the ethylene oxide polymerization is conducted<br>
directly on the drug molecule. The method is also limited by lack of selectivity if<br>
more than one functional group is present on which polymerization can occur.<br>
It would be desirable to provide additional methods for preparing<br>
heterobifunctional PEGs that substantially eliminate at least some of the problems<br>
and drawbacks of previous methods.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention provides a method for preparing heterobifunctional<br>
poly(ethylene glycol) derivatives via a PEG intermediate bearing a removable<br>
group at one terminus. PEG derivatives of the class, W-PEG-OH, where W is a<br>
group removable by mild chemical methods, are provided and are first altered by<br>
modifying the OH group to a desired group, X, followed by removal of W to<br>
generate a second hydroxyl group. The latter hydroxyl group may then be further<br>
altered to a second functional group Y, thus providing the desired<br>
heterobifunctional PEG:<br>
W-PEG-OH —-------------«• W-PEG-X----------------? HO-PEG-X----------------? Y-PEG-X<br>
A preferred removable group is the benzyloxy group<br>
(C6H5CH2-O-), although other arylmethy] groups including, but not limited to, 4-<br>
-methylbenzyl, 3-methylbenzyl, 4-chlorobenzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl,<br>
diphenylmethyl, triphenylmethyl, or 1-naphthylmethyl, may be used.<br>
Diarylmethyl and triarylmethyl groups will also suffice. Benzyloxy-PEG-OH<br>
(BzO-PEG-OH), for example, may be prepared in high purity by polymerization of<br>
ethylene oxide onto the benzyloxide ion, BzO" By conducting the reaction under<br>
carefully controlled, anhydrous conditions, the heterobifunctional derivative<br>
product can be prepared with a minimum amount of HO-PEG-OH. An advantage<br>
of benzyl and other arylmethyl groups is that they may be removed from the PEG<br>
under relatively mild conditions by catalytic hydrogenolysis or by acid-catalyzed<br>
hydrolysis.<br>
BzO-PEG-X + H2 (cat)-----------------------? C6H5-CH3 + HO-PEG-X<br>
BzO-PEG-X + H20 (H+)------------------------C6H5CH20H + HO-PEG-X<br>
In the reactions above, cat is a catalyst such as palladium on charcoal.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the method is used in<br>
conjugating PEG or related polymers to macromolecules such as proteins, lipids,<br>
polysaccharides, or other polymers or surfaces. First, the hydroxyl group of the<br>
intermediate polymer BzO-PEG-OH is converted to a first reactive functional<br>
group. This reactive functional group allows the attachment of the BzO-PEG- to a<br>
macromolecule. The benzyl group is then removed by hydrogenolysis or<br>
hydrolysis, without chemically affecting the macromolecule, thus making available<br>
a new terminal hydroxyl group on the PEG derivative. This new hydroxyl group<br>
may be used directly to attach that terminus of the PEG derivative to the same or<br>
another macromolecule. Alternatively, the hydroxyl group may be further<br>
converted to a second reactive functional group, which is then used to link the PEG<br>
derivative to a macromolecule. If the second reactive functional group is linked to<br>
another polymer, a cross-linked polymer useful as a hydrogel may be generated.<br>
The reaction scheme may be illustrated in a general form as follows:<br>
(1)  BzO-PEG-OH----------------------?BzO-PEG-X                     (X=reactive functional group)<br>
(2)  BzO-PEG-X----------------------? BzO-PEG-M,                      (M,= a macromolecule, e.g., surface,<br>
drug, protein, or polymer.)<br>
(3)  BzO-PEG-M, + H2 (Pd/C)----------------------? BzH + HO-PEG-M,<br>
OR<br>
BzO-PEG-M, + H20/H+----------------------? BzOH + HO-PEG-M,<br>
(4)  HO-PEG-M,------------------? M2-PEG-M|                             (M2= a macromolecule, e.g., surface,<br>
drug, protein, or polymer, or a<br>
different site on M1.)<br>
If desired, the order of the reaction sequence can be manipulated to<br>
avoid destruction of a chemical group sensitive to hydrogenation or hydrolysis:<br>
(1)  Bz-PEG-OH-----------------------?BzO-PEG-X<br>
(2)   BzO-PEG-X-----------------------? BzO-PEG-M,                       (M2=drug, surface, polymer, or other<br>
group not sensitive to hydrogenation<br>
or hydrolysis.)<br>
(3)  BzO-PEG-M2 + H2 (Pd/C)-----------------------? BzH (or BzOH) + HO-PEG-M2<br>
OR<br>
BzO-PEG-M2 + H20/H+-----------------------? BzH (or BzOH) + HO-PEG-M,<br>
(4)   HO-PEG-M2---------------------? M|-PEG-M,                            (M,=drug, surface, polymer, or other<br>
group sensitive to hydrogenation or<br>
hydrolysis.)<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, a method of inhibiting the<br>
reactivity of HO-PEG-OH in a mixture of W-0-PEG-OH and HO-PEG-OH is<br>
disclosed. In this approach, alkylation of W-0-PEG-OH containing HO-PEG-OH<br>
produces a mixture of W-O-PEG-OR and RO-PEG-OR, where R is an alkyl group.<br>
BzO-PEG-OH + HO-PEG-OH + R-X-----------------? BzO-PEG-OR + RO-PEG-OR + HX<br>
X is a leaving group such as mesylate or tosylate.<br>
Catalytic hydrogenation converts the BzO-PEG-OR to RO-PEG-OH.<br>
BzO-PEG-OR + RO-PEG-OR + H: (Pd/C)------------? RO-PEG-OH + RO-PEG-OR + BzH<br>
Thus, a mixture of RO-PEG-OH and RO-PEG-OR is produced.<br>
Unlike HO-PEG-OH, RO-PEG-OR is inert and nonreactive. Thus, the mixture is<br>
equivalent to a pure product of RO-PEG-OH in most chemical reactions.<br>
The foregoing and other objects, advantages, and features of the<br>
invention, and the manner in which the same are accomplished, will be more<br>
readily apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of the<br>
invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention provides a method for preparing, in high purity and<br>
high yield, heterobifunctional derivatives of poly(ethylene glycol) or related<br>
polymers. A chromatographic purification step is not necessary in the method. In<br>
accordance with the method of the invention, an intermediate polymer having a<br>
formula of W-Poly-OH is provided bearing a removable group W at one terminus.<br>
The intermediate polymer W-Poly-OH is first altered by modifying the OH group<br>
to a first functional group X, followed by the removal of W to generate a second<br>
hydroxyl group. The latter hydroxyl group may then be further converted to a<br>
second functional group Y, thus providing the desired heterobifunctional<br>
derivative:<br>
W-Poly-OH ---------------? W-Po!y-X---------------? HO-Poly-X---------------? Y-Po)y-X<br>
In the discussion below, Poly will often be referred to for<br>
convenience as PEG or as poly(ethylene glycol). However, it should be<br>
understood that other related polymers are also suitable for use in the practice of<br>
the invention and that the use of the term PEG or poly(ethylene glycol) is intended<br>
to be inclusive and not exclusive in this respect.<br>
Poly(ethylene glycol) or PEG is useful in biological applications<br>
because it has properties that are highly desirable and is generally approved for<br>
biological or biotechnical applications. PEG typically is clear, colorless, odorless,<br>
soluble in water, stable to heat, inert to many chemical agents, does not hydrolyze<br>
or deteriorate, and is nontoxic. Poly(ethylene glycol) is considered to be<br>
biocompatible, which is to say that PEG is capable of coexistence with living<br>
tissues or organisms without causing harm. More specifically, PEG is not<br>
immunogenic, which is to say that PEG does not tend to produce an immune<br>
response in the body. When attached to a moiety having some desirable function<br>
in the body, the PEG tends to mask the moiety and can reduce or eliminate any<br>
immune response so that an organism can tolerate the presence of the moiety.<br>
Accordingly, the heterobifunctional derivative of the invention should be<br>
substantially non-toxic and should not tend substantially to produce an immune<br>
response or cause Clotting or other undesirable effects.<br>
PEG having the formula -CH2CH2O(CH2CH2O)CH2CH2-, where n<br>
is from about 8 to about 4000, is one useful polymer in the practice of the<br>
invention. Other difunctional, water soluble, nonpeptidic polymers than PEG are<br>
also suitable for the present invention. These other polymers include poly(vinyl<br>
alcohol) ("PVA"); other poly(alkylene oxides) such as polypropylene glycol)<br>
("PPG") and the like; and poly(oxyethylated polyols) such as poly(oxyethylated<br>
glycerol), poly(oxyethylated sorbitol), and poly(oxyethylated glucose), and the<br>
like. The polymers can be homopolymers or random or block copolymers and<br>
terpolymers based on the monomers of the above polymers, straight chain or<br>
branched.<br>
Specific examples of suitable additional polymers include<br>
poly(oxazoline), difunctional poly(acryloylmorpholine) ("PAcM"), and<br>
poly(vinylpyrrolidone)("PVP"). PVP and poly(oxazoline) are well known<br>
polymers in the art and their preparation should be readily apparent to the skilled<br>
artisan. PAcM and its synthesis and use are described in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,629,384 and 5,631,322, the contents of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference in their entirety.<br>
The terms "group," "functional group," "moiety," "active moiety,"<br>
and "reactive site," are all somewhat synonymous in the chemical arts and are used<br>
in the art and herein to refer to distinct, definable portions or units of a molecule<br>
and to units that perform some function or activity and are reactive with other<br>
molecules or portions of molecules.<br>
The term "linkage" is used to refer to groups that normally are<br>
formed as the result of a chemical reaction and typically are covalent linkages.<br>
It should be understood that by "drug" is meant any substance<br>
intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in<br>
humans and other animals, or to otherwise enhance physical or mental well being.<br>
The term "macromolecule" is used to mean large molecules<br>
including, but not limited to, lipid, polysaccharide, proteins, nucleotide sequences,<br>
drugs, polymers, etc. It is often desirable to conjugate the above described<br>
polymers to such macromolecules.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the removable group W can be<br>
removed from the polymer W-Poly-X by mild chemical reactions. Such chemical<br>
reactions can be performed in conditions under which other moieties of the<br>
polymer W-Poly-X, particularly the first functional group X, are not undesirably<br>
modified. Preferably W has a formula of Ar-C(R1)(R2)-O- where Ar represents a<br>
moiety selected from the group consisting of phenyl, substituted phenyl, biphenyl,<br>
substituted biphenyl, polycyclic aryls, substituted polycyclic aryls, and<br>
heterocyclic aryls, where R1 and R2 are H, alkyl, or Ar which is defined above.<br>
Thus, exemplary examples of the removable group W include, but are not limited<br>
to, benzyloxy group (C6H5CH2-O-), and other arylmethyloxy groups including, but<br>
not limited to, 4-methylbenzyloxy, 3-methylbenzyloxy, 4-chlorobenzyloxy,<br>
4-methoxybenzyloxy, diphenylmethyloxy, triphenylmethyloxy, and<br>
1-naphthylmethyloxy. The arylmethyloxy groups can be removed from the<br>
polymer under relatively mild conditions by catalytic hydrogenolysis or acid-<br>
catalyzed hydrolysis.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the intermediate polymer of W-<br>
Poly-OH is preferably synthesized, e.g., by polymerization of monomers of the<br>
suitable polymers onto the arylmethyloxide ion. For example, Benzyloxy-PEG-<br>
OH (BzO-PEG-OH) may be prepared in high purity and high yield by<br>
polymerization of ethylene oxide onto the benzyloxide ion BzO-. Preferably, the<br>
polymerization reaction is conducted under anhydrous conditions. In accordance<br>
with this aspect of the invention, production of HO-PEG-OH is minimized.<br>
Extensive gradient chromatography purification is not required, and the yield of<br>
BzO-PEG-OH is high. This is in contrast with the prior art method of benzylation<br>
of PEG followed by laborious extensive gradient chromatography, which<br>
inevitably leads to high cost and low yield rendering the method of little value for<br>
commercial production.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the final product of the<br>
heterobifunctional derivative of poly(ethylene glycol) or related polymers have a<br>
formula of Y-Poly-X. The first functional group X and the second functional<br>
group Y are reactive moieties that are capable of reacting with other molecules to<br>
which the PEG derivatives are desired to be conjugated to, e.g., macromolecules<br>
including, but not limited to, proteins, lipids, poly sac charides, and other polymers.<br>
Examples of the first functional group X include, but are not limited to, mesylatc<br>
tosylate; tresylate; -O-(CH2)n-CO2H where n = 1-6; -O-(CH2)n-CO2R3 where n =<br>
1-6 and R3 is an alkyl group; -NHR4 where R4 is H or alkyl or an amine protecting<br>
group such as t-Boc and Fmoc; -O-(CH2)n-CH(ZRs)2 where n is a number of 1-6, Z<br>
is O or S, R5 is H or an alkyl group; Ar-CH=CH-CH=CH-CO2- where Ar<br>
represents a moiety selected from the group consisting of phenyl, substituted<br>
phenyl, biphenyl, substituted biphenyl, polycyclic aryls, substituted polycyclic<br>
aryls, and heterocyclic aryls; -O-(CH2)n-CHO; and -O2CCH2CH2CO2R6, where R6<br>
is H or NHS which represents N-succinimidyl.<br>
Examples of the second functional group Y include, but are not<br>
limited to, hydroxyl group; mesylate; tosylate; tresyiate; -O-(CH2)n-CO2H where n<br>
= 1-6; -O-(CH2)n-CO2R3 where n = 1-6 and R3 is an alkyl group; -NHR4 where R4<br>
is H or alkyl or an amine protecting group such as t-Boc and Fmoc;<br>
-O-(CH2)n-CH(ZRs)2 where n is a number of 1-6, Z is O or S, R5 is H or an alkyl<br>
group; Ar-CH=CH-CH=CH-CO2- where Ar represents a moiety selected from the<br>
group consisting of phenyl, substituted phenyl, biphenyl, substituted biphenyl,<br>
polycyclic aryls, substituted polycyclic aryls, and heterocyclic aryls; -O-(CH2)n-<br>
CHO; -O2CCH2CH2CO2R6, where R6 is H or NHS which represents N-<br>
succinimidyl; and CH2=CH-CO2-. In a poly(ethylene glycol) derivative of the<br>
formula Y-Poly-X, the first functional group X and the second functional group Y<br>
are preferably different from each other, thus ensuring the polymer to be<br>
heterobifunctional.<br>
Preferably, when X is Ar-CH=CH-CH=CH-CO2- where Ar is as<br>
defined above, Y is -O-(CH2)n-CHO or -O-(CH2),1-CH(ZR5)2 where 11 is a number<br>
of 1-6, Z is O or S, and R5 is H or an alkyl group. When X is -O-(CH2)n-CH(ZR5)2<br>
where n is a number of 1-6, Z is O or S, and R5 is H or an alkyl group, Y is<br>
preferably -O2CCH2CH2CO2R6 where R6 is H or NHS. When X is<br>
-O-CH2-CO2CH(CH3)CH2CONHS, the second functional group Y is preferably<br>
CH2=CH-CO2-.<br>
Although the reaction scheme of method of the present invention is<br>
demonstrated above in the equations:<br>
W-Poly-OH ---------------? W-Poly-X---------------? HO-Poly-X---------------? Y-Poly-X,<br>
it should be understood that there can be more than one chemical reaction steps<br>
between any of two products in the equations. For example, several sequential<br>
reaction steps may take place to convert the terminal hydroxyl group of W-Poly-<br>
OH to the first functional group X. Likewise, several reaction steps may be<br>
performed to modify the new hydroxyl group of HO-Poly-X to produce the second<br>
functional group Y.<br>
Further, in one embodiment of the invention, before the step of<br>
removing the removable group W, the polymer W-Poly-X can be linked to a<br>
macromolecule or surface through a linkage formed between the first reactive<br>
functional group X and a suitable moiety on the surface of the macromolecule, thus<br>
conjugating the W-Poly- portion of the polymer to the macromolecule: W-Poly-M1<br>
where M1 is a macromolecule such as protein, peptide, lipid, drug, polysaccharide,<br>
or other polymers, or surface of a substance, e.g., microorganism. The removable<br>
group W in the conjugate W-Poly-M1 is thereafter removed by mild chemical<br>
reactions such as, e.g., catalytic hydrogenolysis or by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.<br>
The resultant -OH can be reacted directly to, e.g., another macromolecule M2 such<br>
as protein, peptide, lipid, drug, polysaccharide, or other polymers, or surface of a<br>
substance, e.g., microorganism to form M2-Poly-M1. If conjugation to another<br>
macromolecule is not desired, the -OH group can be optionally converted to an<br>
inert non-reactive group, e.g., capped by alkylation. Alternatively, the resultant -<br>
OH group can be converted to a reactive functional group Y as described above:<br>
Y-Poly-Mi. The functional group Y can then be reacted with M2 to form M2-Poly-<br>
M1.<br>

Hydrogels can be produced in this method through crosslinking of<br>
multiple different macromolecules by the PEG related polymer Poly. However, it<br>
should be understood that, in accordance with this invention, the two functional<br>
group X and Y can also be linked to the same macromolecule, wherein the<br>
conjugating of PEG related polymers on the macromolecule may form a polymer<br>
shell on the macromolecule.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the heterobifunctional<br>
derivative of PEG or related polymer Y-Poly-X made as described above can be<br>
reacted with macromolecules or other substances through the functional groups X<br>
and Y and the reactive moieties on the macromolecules or other substances. For<br>
example, X and Y can be selected such that two different types of macromolecule<br>
or other substance can be linked to X and Y respectively. It is also possible to<br>
select X and Y such that they react with the same types of macromolecules.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention,<br>
heterobifunctional derivatives of poly(ethylene glycol) or related polymers are<br>
provided. Such polymers are represented by a formula of Y-Poly-X, where Poly<br>
represents poly(ethylene glycol) or related polymers as defined above. X and Y<br>
are reactive functional groups selected from the group consisting of mesylate,<br>
tosylate, tresylate, -O-(CH2)n-CO2H where n = 1-6,<br>

Fmoc, -O-(CH2)n-CH(ZR5)2 where n is a number of 1-6, and Z is O or S, R5 is H or<br>
an alkyl group, Ar-CH=CH-CH=CH-CO2-, where Ar represents a moiety selected<br>
from the group consisting of phenyl, substituted phenyl, biphenyl, substituted<br>
biphenyl, polycyclic aryls, substituted polycyclic aryls, and heterocyclic aryls, -O-<br>
(CH2)n -CHO, and -O2CCH2CH2CO2R6, where R6 is H or NHS, n is 1-6.<br>
Preferably X is different from Y.<br>
In some embodiments, when X is Ar-CH=CH-CH=CH-CO2- where<br>
Ar is as defined above, Y is -O-(CH2)n-CHO or -O-(CH2)n-CH(ZR5)2 where n is a<br>
number of 1-6, Z is O or S, and R5 is H or an alkyl group; when X is<br>
-O-(CH2)n-CH(ZR5)2 where n is a number of 1-6, Z is 0 or S, and R5 is H or an<br>
alkyl group, Y is preferably -O2CCH2CH2CO2R6 where R6 is H or NHS; when X is<br>
-O-CH2-CO2CH(CH3)CH2CONHS, the second functional group Y is preferably<br>
CH2=CH-CO2-.<br>
In yet another aspect of the invention, a method is provided for<br>
preparing a heterobifunctional derivative of poly(ethylene glycol) or related<br>
polymers having a formula of X-Polya-O-CHR5(CH2)nCO2-Polyb-X, where Polya<br>
and Polyb represent the same types of polymers repesented by Poly as described<br>
above, n is 0-6, and R5 is H or alkyl, X is a reactive functional group.<br>
Substantially pure form of the heterobifunctional derivatives can be produced in<br>
high purity and high yield without having to resort to a chromatography<br>
purification step.<br>
In the method, a first polymer having a formula of<br>
Ar-C(R1)(R2)O-Polyb-U and a second polymer of Ar-C(R1)(R2)O-Polya-<br>
CHR5(CH2)nCO-V are provided where R1 and R2 are H, alkyl, or Ar where Ar is as<br>
defined above and is selected from the group consisting of phenyl, substituted<br>
phenyl, biphenyl, substituted biphenyl, polycyclic aryls, substituted polycyclic<br>
aryls, and heterocylicaryls, and where U and V are moieties so selected that the<br>
first polymer can react with the second polymer to form a polymer of<br>
Ar-C(R1)(R2)O-Polya-O-CHR5(CH2)nCO2-Polyb-OC(R1)(R2)-Ar. As described<br>
above, the first polymer and the second polymer can be made by forming<br>
separately Polyb and Polya directly onto an arylmethyloxide ion Ar-C(R1)(R2)O" to<br>
produce Ar-C(R1)(R2)O-Polya-OH or Ar-C(R1)(R2)O-Polyb-OH, and optionally,<br>
subsequently modifying the terminal hydroxyl group to moieties U and V<br>
respectively, such that the two polymer can be linked in, e.g., an ester linkage. The<br>
linked polymer can then be modified by removing the Ar-C(R1)(R2)O- moieties by<br>
catalytic hydrogenolysis or by acide-catalyzed hydrolysis. The resultant -OH<br>
groups can optionally be converted into other reactive functional groups.<br>
Examples of the reactive functional group X include, but are not limited to, -OH;<br>
CH2=CR5CO2- where R5 is H or alkyl; -O-(CH2)n-CH(ZR)2 where R is H or alkyl,<br>
Z is O or S and n is 1-6; NHS-O2CO- where NHS represents N-succinimidyl. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, U is -OH and V is a halogen group such as -Cl.<br>
In yet another aspect of the invention, a method is provided for<br>
preparing a bifunctional derivative of poly(ethylene glycol) or related polymers<br>
having a formula of RgO-Polya-O-CHR5(CH2)nCO2-Polyb-Y, where Polya, Polyb, n,<br>
R5 are as defined above, and R8 is H or an alkyl group. Y is a reactive functional<br>
group. The method is free of a chromatography step. In the method, a first<br>
polymer of Ar-C(R1)(R2)O-Polyb-U, is provided as described above. A second<br>
polymer of R8O-Polya-CHR5(CH2)nCO-V, is also provided where R8 is H or alkyl,<br>
or Ar where Ar is defined as above. The moieties U and V can be reacted with<br>
each other to form, e.g., an ester linkage such that the first polymer can be linked<br>
with the second polymer to form the polymer of<br>
RsO-Polya-0-CHR5(CH2)nC02-Polyb-OC(R1)(R2)-Ar. The Ar-C(R1)(R2)O- moiety<br>
can then be converted into a desirable functional group. Preferably, U is -OH, and<br>
V is a halogen group such as -Cl. Y can be a functional group such as -OH;<br>
CH2=CR:5CO2- where R5 is H or alkyl; and -O-(CH2)n-CH(ZR)2 where R is H or<br>
alkyl, Z is O or S and n is 1-6; and -O-(CH2)n-CO2H where n is 1-6.<br>
In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, a method is<br>
provided for making a polymer of R9O-Poly-OH without contaminating the<br>
polymer with the reactivity of HO-Poly-OH. Poly is as defined above, and R9 is an<br>
and alkyl or aryl group. As disclosed in the prior art, removing HO-Poly-OH such<br>
as HO-PEG-OH from a preparation of PEG derivatives normally requires<br>
extensive and laborious purification steps using, e.g., chromatography. The<br>
method of the present invention obviates this requirement. In the method,<br>
Ar-CR1R2O-Poly-OH is first synthesized by forming the polymer Poly onto the<br>
arylmethyloxide ion Ar-CR,R2O". The Ar-CR,R2O-Poly-OH is then alkylated to<br>
convert the polymers to Ar-CR|R2-O-PEG-OR9. Any impurity of HO-Poly-OH is<br>
converted to R9O-PEG-OR9 upon alkylation.   The next step is to convert the<br>
Ar-CR1R2-O- moiety into -OH by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis or hydrogenolysis and<br>
forming a new mixture of R9O-PEG-OH and R9O-PEG-OR9. Since R9O-PEG-OR9<br>
is inert in most chemical reactions, the mixture is chemically equivalent to pure<br>
R9O-PEG-OH. Optionally, the R9O-PEG-OH can be further converted to R9O-<br>
PEG-CHO.<br>
