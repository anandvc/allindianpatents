				<td>LIQUID CONTAINER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a liquid container which stores liquid to be supplied to a liquid consuming apparatus therein, and is removably mountable to a container mounting part of the liquid consuming apparatus.<br>
The liquid consuming apparatus includes, as a representative example thereof, a liquid ejecting apparatus, which ejects a liquid droplet from an ejection head. This liquid ejecting apparatus includes, as a representative example thereof, an ink j et type recording apparatus provided with an ink jet type recording head for recording an image. Other examples of the liquid ej ecting apparatus include, for example, an apparatus having color material ejection head used in manufacture of a color filter of a liquid crystal display or the like, an apparatus having an electrode material (conductive paste) ejection head used in electrode formation of an organic EL display, a field emission display (FED) or the like, an apparatus having bioorganic matter ejection head used in biochip manufacture, and an apparatus having a sample ejection head as a precision pipette.<br>
The ink jet type recording apparatus that is representative of the liquid jet apparatus is comparatively less noisy in printing, and can form fine dots with high density. Therefore, the ink<br>
jet type recording apparatus is presently used in various printing including color printing.<br>
As a liquid supply system to the liquid consuming apparatus of which the ink jet type recording apparatus is representative, such a system is available, in which the liquid is supplied from a liquid container that stores the liquid therein to the liquid consuming apparatus. Further, in this liquid supply system using the liquid container, the liquid container is generally constituted as a cartridge removably mountable to the liquid consuming apparatus so that a user can exchange the liquid container easily when the liquid in the liquid container is consumed.<br>
Generally, the ink j et type recording apparatus has a carriage that is equipped with a recording head for ejecting an-ink droplet and reciprocates along a recording surface of a recording medium. As an ink supply system from the ink cartridge to the recording head, there is a system in which the ink cartridge is mounted on the carriage and the ink is supplied to the recording head from the ink cartridge reciprocating together with the recording head. Further, as another system, there is a system in which the ink cartridge is mounted onto a case or the like of an apparatus body and the ink is supplied through an ink flowing path formed by a flexible tube or the like from the ink cartridge to the recording head.<br>
In any of the above ink supply systems, it is necessary to mount and fix the ink cartridge in a predetermined position<br>
of the apparatus body readily and surely. Further, in exchange of the ink cartridge, it is necessary to remove the ink cartridge from the apparatus body readily and surely.<br>
Therefore, the conventional ink jet type recording apparatus and ink cartridge employ, as a mechanism for surely fixing the ink cartridge in the predetermined position of the apparatus body, for example, a mechanism in which the ink cartridge is pressed and f ixedby a fixing lever operated after the ink cartridge is inserted into a cartridge holder of the apparatus body.<br>
Patent Reference 1: W099/59823<br>
Patent Reference 2: JP2002-19135A<br>
Patent Reference 3: JP2002-254673A<br>
However, such cartridge fixing mechanism requires separate steps performed independently, i.e. an insertion step of the ink cartridge into the cartridge holder and a fixing step by operating the fixing lever after insertion, so that the mounting operation of the ink cartridge to the apparatus body is complicated.<br>
Further, this conventional cartridge fixing mechanism also requires two-step operation when the ink cartridge is removed.<br>
Further, such a mechanism is conceivable that realizes fixing of the ink cartridge simultaneously with the insertion Step during mounting, but even this case requires a step of releasing the fixing when the ink cartridge is removed. This fixing release step must be performed completely independently of a subsequent operation of pulling out the ink cartridge. Therefore, the<br>
removing operation of the ink cartridge becomes complicated.<br>
Further, in the conventional ink j et type recording apparatus and ink cartridge, there are those of such constitution that a memory element (IC) storing data such as the kind of ink and the residual ink amount is provided for the ink cartridge, and an apparatus-side contact to be connected to an IC side electrode is provided on the apparatus body side (for example, cartridge holder).<br>
In a case that the ink cartridge having such IC is mounted onto the apparatus body, it is necessary to surely connect the IC-side electrode to the apparatus-side contact when the ink cartridge is mounted to the apparatus body, and further to surely maintain its connection state. Namely, it is necessary to suppress deviation between the apparatus-side contact and the IC-side electrode in a range enabling electric conduction. For example, it is conceivable to make the dimension of the IC-side electrode larger, to thereby make larger a permissible range of the deviation with respect to the apparatus-side contact - However, this results in a problem that the ink cartridge itself is also larger in size with size increase of the IC-side electrode.<br>
Hence, in order to surely connect the IC-side electrode to the apparatus-side contact, the IC-side electrode of the ink cartridge must be positioned accurately with respect to the apparatus-side contact when the ink cartridge is mounted to the apparatus body. Further, in order to surely maintain the<br>
connection between the IC-side electrode of the ink cartridge and the apparatus-side contact, it is desirable that a force acts on the IC-side electrode of the ink cartridge to press the IC-side electrode against the apparatus-side contact.<br>
The invention has been made in view of the above circumstances, and its object is to provide a liquid container, which can be mounted onto a liquid consuming apparatus readily and surely.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a liquid container including a memory device having an electrode, which electrode can be surely connected to a contact of a liquid consuming apparatus when the liquid container is mounted onto the liquid consuming apparatus.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a liquid container including a memory device having an electrode, which electrode can surely maintain connection to a contact of a liquid consuming apparatus.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT As an embodiment of a liquid container according to the invention, an ink cartridge for an ink jet type recording apparatus will be described with reference to drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view showing several ink cartridges 1 according to the embodiment and a cartridge mounting part 101 of an ink jet type recording apparatus to which these ink cartridges 1 are mounted. In this example, six cartridge mounting parts 101 are provided for the ink jet type recording apparatus 100, and each cartridge mounting part 101 is opened on a front surface of the ink jet type recording apparatus 100. Further, the six<br>
cartridge mounting parts 101 are arranged adjacent to each other along a line on the same horizontal plane, and the six ink cartridges are arranged in a flat manner and adjacent to each other along<br>
a line.<br>
Figs. 2 to 4  are diagrams respectively showing an exterior shape of one ink cartridge 1. The ink cartridge 1 has a container body 2 formed approximately in the shape of a rectangular parallelepiped, and an ink supply port 3 from which ink is fed out to the ink jet type recording apparatus 100 is formed at a central portion of a front surface 2a of this container body 2.<br>
Further, the front surface 2a of the container body 2 also includes a pressure fluid inlet 4 through which pressurized fluid (preferably, pressurized air) for pressurizing ink inside the container body 2 and feeding-out the ink from the ink supply port 3 is introduced into the container body 2.<br>
Further, a pair of positioning holes 5a and 5b into which a pair of positioning projections 103a and 103b (see Figs. 9 and 10) provided at the cartridge mounting part 101 are inserted is formed on the front surface of the container body 2. The positioning holes 5a, 5b and the positioning projections 103a, 103b are used to position the ink cartridge 1 in a lateral (right and left) direction. Around the pair of positioning holes 5a and 5b are formed cartridge-side positioning surfaces 24a and 24b, which are brought into contact with apparatus-side positioning<br>
surfaces 104a and 104b (see Figs. 9 and 10) of the cartridge mounting part 101 so as to perform positioning in the inserting direction of the ink cartridge 1. The pair of positioning holes 5a and 5b and the pair of cartridge-side positioning surfaces 24a and 24b constitute a cartridge-side positioning part.<br>
Further, an erroneous mount preventing structure 6 is provided at a corner of the container body 2 including the front surface (2a), that is, at a corner on the opposite side to a cartridge-side fixing structure 1 side in relation to the ink supply port 3. This erroneous mount preventing structure 6 has such a shape as to properly mount a predetermined ink kind of ink cartridge 1 to a predetermined position when the ink cartridge 1 is attached to the ink jet type recording apparatus 100, and to prevent mounting of any cartridge that is not the proper ink type of ink cartridge.<br>
Further, on a rear surf ace (bottom surface) of the container body 2,  at the corner on the opposite side to the corner where the erroneous mount preventing structure 6 is provided, the cartridge-side fixing structure (a container fixing mechanism) 7 ii provided adjacently to the front surface of the container body 2. This cartridge-side fixing structure 7, when the ink cartridge 1 is mounted to the container mounting part 101, regulates the movement of the ink cartridge 1 in the pulling direction so &amp;s  to control insertion to and removal from the ink jet type recording apparatus. This cartridge-side fixing structure 7<br>
also functions to hold the ink cartridge 1 at a predetermined position in the cartridge mounting part 101.<br>
Though the cartridge-side fixing structure 7 is provided on the rear surface (the bottom surface) of the container body 2 in this embodiment, the cartridge-side fixing structure 7 is not to be limited in position to the rear surface of the container body 2 but can be located elsewhere, for example, on the upper surface of the container body 2.<br>
Further, as depicted in Fig. 3(b), on one side surface of the container body 2, near the cartridge-side fixing structure 7, a circuit board 8b equipped with an IC {semiconductor memory element) which stores data such as the kind of ink and the residual ink amount in the container is provided. On a surface of this circuit board 8b, an electrode (cartridge-side electrode) 8a which is electrically connected to the IC and comes into contact with an apparatus-side contact 113 (see Figs. 9 and 10} of the recording apparatus body is provided, and the circuit board 8b and the electrode 8a constitute a memory unit 8. The memory unit 8 is arranged at a position near the ink supply port 3 of the container body 2 as well as the cart ridge-side fixing structure 7. Though the memory element and the electrode 8a depicted in Fig. 4b are formed on the circuit board 8b in the embodiment, this structure is by example only and not limitation and other constructions could be used - for instance, the memory element and the electrode 8a can be formed on a flexible printed circuit<br>
and arranged at different positions on the container body 2. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the cartridge-side fixing structure<br>
7	is disposed between the ink supply port 3 and the memory device<br>
8	in the lateral direction of the container main body 2.<br>
Fig. 5 is an exploded perspective view showing that the ink cartridge 1, and the container body 2 includes a case body 2A of which an upper surface is opened, and a lid member 2B seals the open upper surface of this case body 2A. Fig. 6 shows a state where the lid member 2B is removed from the ink cartridge 1.<br>
As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, an ink bag 9 having a flexible ink storing part (shown by broken lines for description) that is filled with ink is housed inside the container body 2. The ink bag 9 is affixed to a port part 10 through which the ink stored inside the ink bag 9 can be supplied to the outside. At an inside end part of this port part 10, a check valve 11 is arranged inside and a cap 12 is attached onto the check valve 11. On the other hand, at an outside end part of the port part 10, a spring seat 1.4 urged by a spring 13 is arranged inside and a seal supply cap 15 is attached.<br>
A film 25 is fixed by heat-welding to a welding border 26, which is formed to surround the periphery of the region of the case body 2A in which the ink bag 9 is housed, thereby to make the inside of the case body 2A into closed space. This closed space is arranged so that the pressurized fluid {pressurized<br>
air in this embodiment) introduced from the pressure fluid inlet 4 is contained tightly and does not leak to the outside, and the ink storing part of the ink bag 9 is pressed by the pressurized fluid so that ink can be supplied to the outside. Further, the lidmember 2B is fixed to the case body 2Aby engagement projections 27 formed in the lid member 2B so as to cover the film 25 thereby to protect the film 25 and prevent useless expansion of the film 25 in the pressurizing time.<br>
Figs. 7 and 8 show respectively a state where the ink cartridges 1 are mounted to the cartridge mounting parts 101 of the ink jet type recording apparatus 100. For the cartridge mounting part 101, a slider member (translatingly movable member) 102 to which the front surface part of the ink cartridge 1 is connected is provided. This slidermember 102 is provided slidably in the inserting and pulling (removing) directions of the ink cartridge 1, and urged by a spring unit in a direction (pulling direction Y) opposite to the inserting direction X of the ink cartridge 1.<br>
Figs. 9 and 10 show respectively the cartridge mounting part 101 in the state where the cartridge 1 is not mounted to the cartridgemountingpart 101. Apairof positioningprojections 103a and 103b are provided by a surface of the slider member 102 opposed to the ink cartridge front surface. For each base part of each positioning projection 103a, 103b, an apparatus-side positioning surface 104a, 104b is provided by each shoulder part.<br>
The pair of positioning projections 103a, 103b and the pair of apparatus-side positioning surfaces 105a, 104b constitute an apparatus-side positioning part.<br>
When the ink cartridge 1 is connected to the slider member 102, the pair of positioning projections 103a, 103b are inserted into the corresponding pair of positioning holes 5a, 5b located on the front surface of the ink cartridge 1, and the pair of cartridge-side positioning surfaces 24a, 24b shown in Fig. 4(d) come into contact with the pair of apparatus-side positioning surfaces 104a, 104b.<br>
Turning now to the pair of positioning holes 5a, 5b, the pair of positioning projections 103a, 103b, the pair of cartridge-side positioning surfaces 24a, 24b, and the pair of apparatus-side positioning surfaces lQ4a&gt; 104b, it is preferable for one positioning hole 5a, one positioning projection 103a, one cartridge-side positioning surface 24a, and one apparatus-side positioning surface 104a, which are located closer to the memory device 8, to have a function of positioning the ink cartridge l in relation to the slider member 102 more precisely. Especially, positioning of the ink cartridge 1 in the inserting direction is precisely performed by the cartridge-side positioning surface 24a and the apparatus-side positioning surface 104a.<br>
As apparent from Fig. 4B, the positioning hole 5a and the cartridge-side positioning surface 24a that are used for precise positioning and that constitute a container-side positioning<br>
portion are arranged near the memory unit 3 including the electrode 8a and between the ink supply port 3 and the memory unit 8 having the electrode 8a in the lateral direction of the container main body 2. This way, the positioning hole 5a, the cartridge-side positioning surface 24a and the cartridge-side fixing structure 7 are arranged in the vicinity of the memory unit 8.<br>
Further, the positioning hole 5a and the cartridge-side fixing structure 7 are arranged so that the positioning projection 103a inserted into the positioning hole Sa/ and the cartridge-side fixing structure 7 are superimposed on each other in the thickness direction of the container body 2. As a result, the memory unit can be positioned relative to the corresponding contact structure of the printer with improved accuracy.<br>
Figs. 11A and 11B show respectively a state where the ink cartridge 1 is precisely positioned with respect to the slider member 102 by the positioning hole 5a, the positioning projection 103a, the cartridge-side positioning surface 24a and the apparatus-side positioning surface 103a. A fixing pin 112 of the apparatus-side fixing structure 107 is inserted and held in a fixing part 18 of a guide groove 16 of the container body 2.<br>
Further, as shown in Figs. 9 and 10, a pressure fluid port 105 to be connected to the pressure fluid inlet 4 of the ink cartridge 1 is provided on the surface of the slider member 102 opposed to the front surface of the ink cartridge. This pressure<br>
fluid port 105 is elastically supported on the slider member 102 by an elastic member such as a spring so that the pressure fluid port 105 can project from and retract into the slider member 102.<br>
Although the pressure fluidport 105 is elastically supported by the slider member 102 in this embodiment, the pressure fluid port 105 may be disposed on a stationary structure portion of the cartridge mounting part 101 similarly to the ink supply needle 106.  •<br>
Further, as shown, for example, in Figs. 2(d), 4{b} and 4(d), a container-side abutment portion 4A is formed around the pressure fluid inlet port 4 on the front surface 2a of the container body 2. This container-side abutment portion 4A is located on the front surface 2a of the container body 2 and at an opposite side of the ink supply port 3 to the memory unit 8. The container-side abutment portion 4A abuts elastically against the top surface of the pressure fluid port 105 (an apparatus-side abutment portion) when the ink cartridge 1 is mounted onto the cartridge mounting part 101.<br>
Further, as shown in Figs. 9 and 10, a contact protrusion part 114 having an apparatus-side contact 113 to be connected to the electrode 8a of the memory unit 8 is provided at one end of the front surface of the slider member 102.<br>
Figs. 12 and 13 show respectively a state where the slider member 102 is removed from the cartridge mounting part 101.<br>
An ink supply needle 106 is secured inside the cartridge mounting part 101. The ink cartridge 1 is pushed in together with the slider member 102, whereby the ink supply needle 106 is inserted into the ink supply port 3 of the ink cartridge 1.<br>
Further, inside the cartridge mounting part 101, the apparatus-side fixing structure 107 is provided, which regulates releasably the movement of the ink cartridge 1 in the pulling direction in cooperation with the cartridge-side fixing structure 7.<br>
The apparatus-side fixing structure 107 has a turn lever member 108. This turn lever member 108 is supported rotatably about its base end part so that it can pivot, and is urged by a spring member 109 in one rotating direction (counterclockwise for the structure depicted in Fig. 12).<br>
As shown in Fig. 14, the turn lever member 108 comprises an elongate lever body 110, an approximately cylindrical pin attaching part 111 provided at a leading end of this lever body 110, an approximately cylindrical fixing pin 112 which is provided on a top surface of this pin attaching part 111 and which is smaller in diameter than the pin attaching part 111.<br>
As shown in Figs. 15 and 16, the cartridge-side fixing structure 7 is composed of the guide groove 16 having a rectangular section, into which the fixing pin 112 is inserted. A recess part 17 is formed at a corner on the cartridge rear surface near the positioning hole 5a and the cartridge-side positioning surface<br>
24a which are used for positioning the cartridge withhigh accuracy. The guide groove 16 is provided in a recessed manner at the bottom of this recess part 17, The bottom surface of this guide groove 16 is made perpendicular to the side surface of the container body 2 on which the memory unit 8 is arranged.<br>
In mounting and removal operations of the ink cartridge 1 to and from the cartridge mounting part 101, the fixing pin 112 of the turn lever member 108 of the apparatus-side fixing structure 107 is guided by the guide groove 16 of the cartridge-side fixing structure 7.<br>
The guide groove 16 includes the fixing part 18 to which the fixing pin 112 is engaged in the state where the ink cartridge 1 is mounted to the cartridge mounting part 101 and which regulates the movement of the ink cartridge 1 in the pulling direction.<br>
Further, the guide groove 16 includes an entrance-side guide part 19 which guides the fixing pin 112 when the ink cartridge 1 is inserted into the cartridge mounting part 101; an intermediate guide part 20 which leads the fixing pin 112 to the fixing part 18 when the ink cartridge 1 that has been inserted into the cartridge mounting part 101 is pushed backward in the pulling direction; and an exit-side guide part 21 which guides, to the exit of the guide groove 16, the fixing pin 112 released from the fixing part 18 by pushing the ink cartridge 1 in the insertion direction when the ink cartridge 1 is removed from the cartridge mounting part 101.<br>
A main portion (linear portion) of the entrance-side guide<br>
part 19 of the guide groove 16 is provided to extend at an angle<br>
of about 30° to 50° relative to the inserting/pulling direction.<br>
Further, an end of the entrance-side guide part 19 is formed<br>
to present a curved shape by a project ion-shaped wall part 19d.<br>
Further, an entrance slant surface 22 is formed at an entrance part 16a of the guide groove 16, . This entrance slant surface 22 slants so that a groove depth becomes shallower in the moving direction of the f ixingpin 112 that relatively moves in association with the inserting operation of the ink cartridge 1 into the cartridge mounting part 101.<br>
A width of the entrance slant surface 22 is set larger than a groove width of the main portion of the guide groove 16 including the fixing part 18 and being formed with the nearly same width. Further, the width of the entrance slant surface 22 is set larger than the diameter of the pin attaching part 111 to which the fixing pin 112 is attached. On the other hand, the groove width of the main portion of the guide groove 16 is set smaller than the diameter of the pin attaching part 111.<br>
Further, a deep groove forming slant surface 19a is formed at the entrance-side guide part 19 between the entrance slant surface 22 and the fixing part 18, which slant surface 19a slants so that the guide groove 16 becomes deeper in the moving direction of the fixing pin 112 that relatively moves in association with the inserting operation of the ink cartridge 1 into the cartridge<br>
mounting part 101. A flat part 19b is formed between this deep groove forming slant surface 19a and the entrance slant surface 22. Further, a flat part 19c is formed, continuing from the deep groove forming slant surface 19a.<br>
The depth of the guide groove 16 at the shallowest part formed by the entrance slant surface 22, that is, the groove depth of the flat part 19b is smaller than the length of the fixing pin 112. Further, the depth of the guide groove 16 at the deepest part formed by the deep groove forming slant surface 19a, that is, the groove depth of the flat part 19c is larger than the length of the fixing pin 112.<br>
Further, the intermediate guide part 20 of the guide groove 16 includes a temporarily stopping side wall part 20a which stops temporarily the fixing pin 112, moving in the direction of the fixing part 18, in front of the fixing part 18 when the ink cartridge 1 has been inserted into the cartridge mounting part 101 to a sufficient depth.<br>
Further, the fixing part 18 of the guide groove 16 includes a final stopping side wall part 18a which receives and stops in a predetermined position the fixing pin 112 that has been released from the temporarily stopping side wall 20a and moves to the fixing part 18 when the ink cartridge 1 inserted into the cartridge mounting part 101 to a sufficient depth is pushed back in the pulling direction, thereby stopping the fixing pin 112.<br>
Further, a curved side wall part 21a is formed at a start end of the exit-side guide part 21, a linear slant surface 21b is formed continuing from this curved side wall part 21a, and further, a linear flat part 21c is formed continuing from the slant surface 21b.<br>
Further, an exit part 16b of the guide groove 16 is connected to the entrance part 16a, whereby the guide groove 16 forms a loop as a whole. In the connection part between the entrance part 16a and the exit part 16b, the groove depth of the exit part 16b is shallower than the groove depth of the entrance part 16a, whereby a step part 23 (shown in Fig. 16B) is formed at the connection part. This step part 23 prevents the fixing pin 112 from entering the flat part 21c when the ink cartridge 1 is inserted into the cartridge mounting part 101.<br>
Next, the operation of the fixing pin 112 into the guide groove 16 in the mounting and removal operation of the ink cartridge 1 will be described with reference to Fig. 17. it should be understood that arrow Z in Fig. 17 represents an urging direction of the turn lever member 108 resulting from the biasing action of the spring member 109.<br>
After the ink cartridge 1 has inserted into the cartridge mounting part 101 and connected to the slider member 102, when the ink cartridge 1 is further pushed in the insertion direction X against the urging force of the slider member 102, the fixing pin 112 of the turn lever member 108 is inserting into the entrance<br>
part 16a of the guide groove 16 (position A in Fig. 17}.<br>
Since the entrance slant surface 22 is formed at the entrance part 16a of the guide groove 16, the fixing pin 112, sliding on this entrance slant surface 22, moves in the opposite direction to the groove depth direction. Hereby, the turn lever member 108 or a member supporting the turn lever member 108 deforms elastically, so that force urging the fixing pin 112 toward the bottom surface of the guide groove 16 is produced.<br>
When the leading end of the fixing pin 112 firstly comes into contact with the entrance slant surface 22, the top surface of the pin attaching part 111 is located in the lower position than the edge level of the guide groove 16. While the fixing pin 112 moves on the entrance slant surface 22, the groove depth changes so that the top surface of the pin attaching part 111 exceeds the edge level of the guide groove 16.<br>
When the fixing pin 112 passes through the entrance slant surface 22 and next gets over the flat part 19b (position B in Fig. 17), only the fixing pin 112 is inserted into the guide groove 16, and the pin attaching part 111 is located outside the guide groove 16. This is because the depth of the. guide groove 16 at the flat part 19b is set smaller than the length of the fixing pin 112.<br>
By thus providing the entrance slant surface 22 for the entrance part 16a of the guide groove 16, it is possible to prevent, when the fixing pin 112 is inserted into the entrance part 16a<br>
of the guide groove 16, the fixing pin 112 from being caught by the front surface of the ink cartridge 1, so that the insertion of the fixing pin 112 into the entrance part 16a of the guide groove 16 can be performed smoothly and surely.<br>
Further, since the entrance slant surface 22 is formed and the groove depth of the flat part 19b continuing from this surface 22 is set smaller than the length of the fixing pin 112, even in case that the width of the entrance part 16a of the guide groove 16 is set large and the width of the groove continuing from this part 16a is made narrow like that in the embodiment, the pin attaching part 111 is not caught in the narrow-width part of the guide groove 16. By setting the width of the entrance part 16a of the guide groove 16 large, the fixing pin 112 can be inserted into the guide groove 16 surely.<br>
When the ink cartridge 1 is further pushed in the inserting direction X, the fixing pin 112 passes through the flat part 19b, and moves in the groove depth direction (position C in Fig. 17), sliding on the deep groove forming slant surface 19a.<br>
When the fixing pin 112 passes through the deep groove forming slant surface 19a and comes to the position of the flat part 19c (position D in Fig. 17), the peripheral edge part of the top surface of the pin attaching part 111 fits to the edge part of the guide groove 16 and is pressed against this edge part. This is because of the continuing elastic deformation produced in the turn lever member 108 when the fixing pin 112 passes through<br>
the entrance slant surface 22 and which is still present at this time. By thus fitting the peripheral edge part of the top surface of the pin attaching part 111 to the edge part of the guide groove 16, it is possible to prevent the turn lever member 108 from coming into contact with the surface including the edge part of the guide groove 16 (bottom, surface of the recess part 17), thereby preventing the fixing pin 112 from rising out of the guide groove 16.<br>
Further, when the fixing pin 112 comes to the position of the flat part 19c (position D in Fig. 17), the leading end of the fixing pin 112 is separated from the bottom surface of the guide groove 16. This is because the groove depth of the flat part 19c is set larger than the length of the fixing pin 112.<br>
When the ink cartridge 1 is further pushed in the inserting direction X, and the fixing pin 112 exceeds the position (position E in Fig. 17) near the leading end of the projection-like wall part 19d located at the end of the entrance-side guide part 19, the fixing pin 112 moves in the direction Z by the urging force of the spring member 109. Then, the fixing pin 112 strikes with the temporarily stopping side wall 20a and stops (position F in Fig. 17) . At this time, an audible click is produced. Upon hearing this click, the user is able to confirm that the ink cartridge 1 has been inserted to sufficient depth.<br>
When the user stops pressing the ink cartridge 1 in the inserting direction X, the ink cartridge 1 is pushed back slightly<br>
in the pulling direction Y (that is, toward the user) by the urging force of the slider member 102. Hereby, engagement of the fixing pin 112 to the temporarily stopping side wall 20a is released, and the fixing pin 112 moves in the direction Z in response to the urging force of the spring member 109. Then, the fixing pin 112 collides with the lastly stopping side wall 18a and stops in the fixing position (position G in Fig. 17), and an audible click is produced at this time. By hearing this click, the user can confirm that the ink cartridge 1 has been properly fixed to the cartridge mounting part 101.<br>
Here, the depth of the groove in the fixing part 18 of the guide groove 16 is set larger than the length of the fixing pin 112 similarly to that in the flat part 19c of the entrance-side guide part 19. Further, by the elastic deformation of the turn lever member 108 produced when the fixing pin 112 passes through the entrance slant surface 22, the fixing pin 112 is urged toward the bottom surface of the guide groove 16.<br>
Therefore, regarding the fixing pin 112 fixed in the predetermined fixing position of the stopping part 18, its full length enters into the inside of the guide groove 16, and the peripheral edge part of the top surface of the pin attaching part 111 fits against the edge part of the guide groove 16. Hereby, this fitting against the side wall of the guide groove 16 can serve to prevent the fixing pin 112 (particularly, its base part) from experiencing creep resulting from the force applied<br>
to the fixing pin 112. Namely, in case that the fixing pin 112 is caught in the guide groove 16 shallowly, the force applied to the base part of the fixing pin 112 increases by the principle of levers. However, in the embodiment, since the fixing pin 112 is caught in the guide groove 16 throughout its full length as described above, the creepof the fixing pin 112 can be prevented.<br>
Further, since the fixing pin 112 is caught in the guide groove 16 deeply enough, the fixing pin 112 never comes out of the guide groove 16. This effect is not limited to only the fixing part 18 but is obtained also while the fixing pin 112 is relatively moving in the guide groove 16 in case that the peripheral edge part of the top surface of the pin attaching part 111 slides the edge part of the guide groove 16.<br>
Further, the fixing pin 112 is urged toward one side surface of the ink cartridge 1 by the spring member 109, and the electrode 8a of the memory unit 8 is provided on this side surface. Therefore, the urging force of the spring member 109 acts through the fixing pin 112 and the lastly stopping side wall part 18a so that the electrode 8 of thememoryunit 8 is pressed toward the apparatus-side contact 113 (Figs. 9 and 10) . Hereby, it is possible to secure the connections between the electrode 8a of the memory unit 8 and the apparatus-side contact 113.<br>
Next, when the ink cartridge 1 is removed from the cartridge mounting part 101, the ink cartridge 1 is pushed slightly in the inserting direction X by the user. Then, engagement of the<br>
fixing pin 112 with the lastly stopping side wall 18a is released, and the fixing pin 112 moves in the direction Z in response to the urging force exerted by the spring member 109. Next, the fixing pin 112 collides with the curved side wall 21a of the exit-side guide part 21 of the guide groove 16 and temporarily stops (position H in Fig. 17). At this time, an audible click is produced. By hearing the click, the user can confirm that fixing of the ink cartridge 1 to the cartridge mounting part 101 has been released-<br>
Next, the user stops pressing the ink cartridge 1 in the inserting direction X. When the ink cartridge 1 moves in the pulling direction Y in response to the urging force of the slide member 102, the fixing pin 112 moves along the linear slant surface 21b of the exit-side guide part 21 (position I in Fig. 17). At this time, the leading end of the fixing pin 112 comes into contact with the slant surface 21b in the middle of the slant surface 21b, and the fixing pin 112 moves upward in the opposite direction to the groove depth direction. The fixing pin 112 that has passed through the slant surface 21b passes  through the flat part 21c (position J in Fig. 17) and out from the exit part 16b of the guide groove 16.<br>
Next, a connection process of the ink cartridge 1 to the ink supply needle 106, etc. when the ink cartridge 1 is mounted to the cartridge mounting part 101 will be described.<br>
when the ink cartridge 1 is inserted into the cartridge<br>
mounting part 101, firstly, the positioning projections 103a, 103b of the slider member 102 are inserted into the positioning holes 5a, 5b of the ink cartridge 1. Further, the pressure fluid port 105 of the slider member 102 is connected to the pressure fluid inlet 4 of the ink cartridge 1. Further, the electrode 8a of the memory unit 8 and the apparatus-side contact 113 are connected to each other, whereby electrical communication can be established.<br>
The electrode 8a of the memory unit 8 and the apparatus-side contact 113 establish electrical communication before the ink supply needle 106 has been inserted into the ink supply port 3 of the ink cartridge. Accordingly, the data is read from the memory unit 8 at this time, and a determination is made whether the proper ink cartridge 1 has been inserted. If the wrong ink cartridge 1 has been inserted, then before the ink supply needle 106 is inserted into the ink supply port 3 of the wrong ink cartridge 1, there is an opportunity to replace the wrong ink cartridge with the proper ink cartridge- Hereby, it is possible to prevent the wrong type of ink from flowing into the ink flowing path of the apparatus body. Further, in this situation, when the ink supply port 3 of the ink cartridge 1 that has been inserted wrongly is sealed by a seal, it is possible to avoid breaking the seal unnecessarily.<br>
After the ink cartridge 1 has been connected to the slider member 102, the ink cartridge 1 is further pushed in the inserting<br>
direction X against the urging force of the slider member 102, whereby the ink supply needle 106 is inserted into the ink supply port 3 of the ink cartridge 1. At this time, the container-side abutment portion 4A of the ink cartridge 1 is pressed elastically by the top surface 105A of the pressure fluid port 105 constituting the apparatus-side abutment portion, and by this pressing force, the electrode 8a of the memory unit 8 is pressed toward the apparatus-side contact 113.<br>
When the user stops pressing of the ink cartridge 1 into the cartridge mounting part 101, the ink cartridge 1 is pushed backward slightly and the fixing pin 112 is engaged with the fixing part 18 of the guide groove 16, whereby the ink cartridge 1 is held at a predeterminedmounting position. In this condition, the pressing force is still present so that the container-side abutment portion 4A of the ink cartridge 1 is pressed by the top surface 105A of the pressure fluid port 105, and therefore the electrode 8a of the memory unit 8 is pressed toward the apparatus-side contact 113.<br>
Next, a separation process for disengaging the ink cartridge 1 from the ink supply needle 106 when the ink cartridge 1 is detached from the cartridge mounting part 101 will be described.<br>
As described above, by pushing the ink cartridge 1 inward in the inserting direction X, fixing of the ink cartridge 1 by the cartridge-side fixing structure 7 and the apparatus-side fixing structure 107 is released, and the ink cartridge 1 can<br>
move in the pulling direction Y. The ink cartridge, released and no long fixed in position, moves firstly in the pulling direction Y together with the slider member 102, and the ink supply needle 106 comes out from the ink supply port 3 as a result of this movement.<br>
When the ink supply needle 106 thus comes out from the ink supply port 3, since the connection between the electrode 8a of the memory unit 8 and the apparatus-side contact 113 is still maintained, data can be exchanged between the memory unit 8 and the apparatus body. Even though the ink cartridge has been released, data can be exchanged between the memory unit 8 of the cartridge 1 and the apparatus body, so that data transmission errors can be prevented.<br>
When the ink cartridge is further moved in the pulling direction Y, the slider member 102 reach a position in the predetermined position at which it becomes unmovable. When the ink cartridge 1 is further moved in the pulling direction Y from this state, the pressure fluid port 105 is separated from the pressure fluid inlet 4 of the ink cartridge 1, and the positioning projections 103a, 103b come out of the positioning holes 5a, 5b of the ink cartridge 1. Further, the electrode 8 of the memory unit 8 and the apparatus-side contact 113 are disconnected.<br>
As described above, the ink cartridge 1 according to the embodiment can be mounted to the cartridge mounting part 101 of the ink jet type recording apparatus 100 readily and surely.<br>
Particularly, in the ink cartridge 1 according to the embodiment, since the width of the entrance slant surface 22 formed at the entrance part 16a of the guide groove 16 can be made large, the insertion of the fixing pin 112 into the guide groove 16 can be surely performed. Since the turn lever member 108 including the fixing pin 112 is constructed so as to swing in the direction Z perpendicular to the inserting and pulling directions X, Y of the ink cartridge 1, variations may be produced in the initial position (the position in a state where the ink cartridge has not been mounted yet} of the fixingpin 112. However, by making the width of the entrance slant surface 22 large, these variations can be accommodated.<br>
Further, in the ink cartridge 1 according to the embodiment, it is possible to complete the mounting operation by only one operation (single push operation) that the ink cartridge 1 is inserted into the cartridge mounting part 101. On the other hand, when the ink cartridge 1 is removed from the cartridge mounting part 101, the fixing state of the ink cartridge 1 can be released by only the easy operation that the ink cartridge 1 is slightly pushed in. In the embodiment, it is possible to perform the mounting and removal operations of the ink cartridge 1 very readily like this.<br>
Further, in the ink cartridge 1 according to this embodiment, since the guide groove 16 is formed on the bottom surface of the recess part.17 formed on the surface of the cartridge, in<br>
the state where the fixing pin 112 is inserted into the guide groove 16, the protruding amount of the turn lever member 108 from the cartridge surface can be reduced or even made zero. Therefore, the thickness of the cartridge mounting part 101 can be reduced, so that the size of the ink jet type recording apparatus 100 can be decreased. Particularly, in the case of an apparatus of the type in which the plural ink cartridges 1 are arranged in a fiat and juxtaposed manner such as the ink jet type recording apparatus 100 shown in Fig- 1, it is desirable to reduce the thickness of the whole of the apparatus. Therefore, the ink cartridge 1 according to the embodiment, which can reduce the thickness of the cartridge mounting part 101, is very effective and helpful to achieving this goal.<br>
Further, in the ink cartridge 1 according to the embodiment, since the memory unit 8 including the electrode 8a is arranged near the cartridge-side fixing structure 7, the electrode 8a of the memory unit 8 can be surely and securely connected to the apparatus-side contact 113 of the cartridge mounting part 101.<br>
Particularly, since the urging force of the spring member 109 acts so as to press the electrode 8a of the memory unit 8 in the direction of the apparatus-side contact 113 of the cartridge mounting part 101 through the fixing pin 112 and the lastly stopping side wall 18a, the electrode 8 of the memory unit 8 can be surely connected to the apparatus-side contact 113.<br>
Further,   since the cartridge-side fixing structure 7 and the memory unit 8 including the electrode 8a are arranged at a position near the ink supply port 3 of the whole of the container body 2, the connection of the electrode 8 of the memory unit 8 to the apparatus-side contact 113 can be more surely performed.<br>
Further, the memory unit 8, including the electrode 8a, is arranged near the cartridge-side fixing structure 1,  and the positioning hole 5a and the cartridge-side positioning surface 24a that are used for accurate positioning. Therefore, the connection of the electrode 8 of the memory unit 8 to the apparatus-side contact 113 can be more surely performed.<br>
In the ink cartridge 1 according to this embodiment, the ink supply port 3, the electrode 8a of the memory unit 8, the container-side abutment portion 4A, the positioning hole 5a and the cartridge-side fixing structure 7 have such a positional relationship that the pressing force applied to the container-side abutment portion 4A from the top surface 105A of the pressure fluid port 105 presses the electrode 8a of the memory unit 8 toward the apparatus-side contact 113 when the ink cartridge 1 is mounted onto the cartridge mounting part 101. Therefore, the ink cartridge 1 is mounted onto the cartridge mounting part 101, it is possible to surely connect the electrode 8a of the memory unit 8 of the ink cartridge 1 to the apparatus-side contact 113 of the ink jet recording apparatus 100, and to surely maintain the connection therebetween.<br>
Further, in the ink cartridge 1 according to this embodiment, since the memory unit 8 is disposed on the side surface of the container body 2, the ink cartridge can be made small in size easily.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
