(a) reacting a compound of formula II<br><br>
R1-R13	(II)<br>
wherein R1 is as defined above and R13 is -OH, -SH, -I, -CI, 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthyl-, -COOH, -NH2, -H, -carbonitrile, -O-trifluoromethansulfonyl, or -C(O)CI, with a compound of formula III<br><br>

and recovering the so obtained compound of formula la and formula lb in free form or in form of a salt.<br>
Process (a) may be performed according to conventional procedures, e.g. as described in example 1 to 14.<br><br>
According to process (b),<br>
(i) for the production of a compound of formula lb wherein X" is -SO- or -S(O)2-, a compound<br>
of formula la wherein X' is -S- and m-chloroperbenzoic acid can be used, e.g. as described in<br>

Working up the reaction mixtures and purification of the compounds thus obtained may be carried out in accordance to known procedures.<br>
Acid addition salts may be produced from the free bases in known manner, and vice-versa. Suitable acid addition salts for use in accordance with the present invention include for example the hydrochloride.<br>
The starting compounds of formula 11 and III may be produced e.g. as described in example 2, 3, 5, 6,12,13 and 14; or are known or may be produced in analogous manner to known procedures.<br>
The compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, hereinafter refenred to as agents of the invention, exhibit valuable pharmacological properties when tested in vitro and in animals, and are therefore useful as pharmaceuticals.<br>
In particular the agents of the invention exhibit cannabinoid (CB) receptor binding activity. More particularly the agents of the invention are active at the human CB1 receptor. Cannabinoid receptor interaction of the agents of the invention may be demonstrated by their ability to displace e.g. [3H]CP55940 from human cannabinoid receptors expressed in, e.g. pEAK cells, e.g. as demonstrated in accordance with the following test method.<br><br>
Test I: CB1 receptor binding assay<br>
The assay mixture comprises 75 //I of membrane suspension [membranes from pEAK cells transfected with human CB1 receptors from Receptor Biology, Beltsville, MD.; 133µg/ml in assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI, 2.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCI2 5 mg/ml BSA, pH7.4), approx, 10µg/well)], 25µ| WGA-YS beads [Yttrium silicate beads coated with wheat germ agglutinin, Amersham (40 mg/ml, 1 mg/well)], 50µI test compound in 4 % DMSO and 50µl radioligand {[^H]CP55940 (180 Ci/mmol), New England Nuclear; final concentration 0.125 nM, in assay buffer}. All components are mixed, shaken at room temperature for 2 hours, then counted on a Topcount. Non-saturable binding is measured in the presence of 10/yM (R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyI-3-[(4-morpholinyl)methyl]pyrrolo[1,2,3-cfe]-1,4"benzoxazin-6-yl](1 -naphthalenyl)methanone (Tocris).<br>
K1 values are in the range of 1 nM to 100 µM, preferentially from 10 nM to 2µM for the agents of the invention. The IC50 values are calculated in ORIGIN using a logistic fit. K1 values are calculated from the IC50 values using the Cheng-Prussoff equation (K1 = IC50/(1+ ([L]/Kd)) where [L] is the ligand concentration.<br>
The agents of the invention are particularly useful in the treatment or prevention of chronic pain, especially inflammatory, e.g. chronic inflammatory pain, inflammatory diseases for example inflammatory airways disease, e.g. COPD, or in asthma, rhinitis, inflammatory bowel disease, cystitis, e.g. interstitial cystistis, pancreatitis, uveitis, inflammatory skin disorders and rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
Activity specifically as analgesic agents may be confirmed in accordance with standard test methods, e.g. as described in the following test.<br>
Test li: Neuropathic pain model<br>
Hyperalgesia is examined in the model of neuropathic pain induced by partial ligation of the sciatic nerve as described by Seltzer et al. (1990). Briefly, Wistar rats (120-140 g) are anaesthetised, the left sciatic nerve exposed at mid-thigh level through a small incision and 1/3 to 1/2 of the nerve thickness tightly ligated within a 7.0 silk suture. The wound is closed with a single muscle suture and skin clips and dusted with Aureomycin antibiotic powder. The animals are allowed to recover and used 12-15 days following surgery.<br><br>
Mechanical hyperalgesia is assessed by measuring paw withdrawal thresholds to an increasing pressure stimulus placed onto the dorsal surface of the paw using an analgesymeter (Ugo-Basile, Milan) with a cut-off of 250 g. Withdrawal thresholds are measured on both the ipsilateral (ligated) and contralateral (unligated) paw prior to (predose) and then up to 6 h following drug or vehicle administration. Data are expressed as withdrawal threshold (g) and percentage reversal of hyperalgesia calculated according to the following formula:<br><br>
Potency is expressed as D50 value, i.e. the dose of compound necessary to produce 50 % reversal of hyperalgesia.<br>
D50 values are in the range of 0.1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg for the agents of the invention.<br>
The agents of the invention are thus useful as cannabinoid receptor agonists, e.g. for the treatment of pain of various genesis or aetiology and as anti-inflammatory and/or anti-oedemic agents for the treatment of inflammatory reactions, diseases or conditions, as well as for the treatment of allergic responses. Having regard to their analgesic/anti-inflammatory profile they are useful for the treatment of inflammatory pain, for the treatment of hyperalgesia and, in particular, for the treatment of severe chronic pain. They are, for example, useful for the treatment of pain, inflammation and/or oedema consequential to trauma, e.g. associated with bums, sprains, fracture or the like, subsequent to surgical inten/ention, e.g. as post-operative analgesics, as well as for the treatment of inflammatory pain of diverse genesis, e.g. for the treatment of bone and joint pain (osteoarthritis), rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatic disease, teno-synovitis, gout, cancer pain, myofascial pain (muscular injury, fibromyalgia), chronic neuropathic pain, e.g. diabetic neuropathy, phantom limb pain and perioperative pain (general surgery, gynecologic surgery). They are further suitable as analgesics for the treatment of pain associated with, e.g., angina, menstruation or cancer. As anti-inflammatory/anti-oedema agents, they are further useful, e.g., for the treatment of inflammatory skin disorders, for example psoriasis and eczema.<br>
The agents of the invention are also useful as smooth muscle relaxants, e.g. for the treatment of spasm of the gastro-intestinal tract or uterus, e.g. in the treatment of glaucoma/intra-ocular pressure, e.g. in the therapy of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or pancreatitis and for the treatment of muscle spasticity and tremor in e.g. multiple sclerosis.<br><br>
For the above indications the appropriate dosage of the agents of the invention will, of course, vary depending upon, for example, the host, the mode of administration and the nature and severity of the condition being treated as well as the relative potency of the particular an agent of the invention employed. For example, the amount of active agent required may be determined on the basis of known in vitro and in vivo techniques, determining how long a particular active agent concentration in the blood plasma remains at an acceptable level for a therapeutic effect. In general, satisfactory results in animals are indicated to be obtained at daily dosages of from about 0.01 to about 20.0 mg/kg p.o. In humans, an indicated daily dosage is in the range of from about 0.7 to about 1400 mg/day p.o., e.g. from about 50 to 200 mg (70 kg man), conveniently administered once or in divied doses up to 4 x per day or in sustained release form. Oral dosage forms accordingly suitably comprise from about 1.75 or 2.0 to about 700 or 1400 mg. an agent of the invention admixed with an appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier therefor.<br>
The agents of the invention may alternatively be administered e.g. topically in the form of a cream, gel or the like for example for the treatment of conditions of the skin as hereinbefore described or by inhalation, e.g. in dry powder form, for example for the treatment of asthma.<br>
Examples for compositions comprising an agent of the invention include, e.g. a solid dispersion, an aqueous solution, e.g. containing a solubilising agent, a microemulsion and a suspension of. e.g. a hydrochloride salt of a compound of formula I in the range of from 0.1 to 1 %, e.g. 0.5 %. The composition may be buffered to a pH in the range of, e.g. from 3.5 to 9.5, e.g. to pH 4,5, by a suitable buffer.<br>
The agents of the invention are also useful as research chemicals.<br>
The agents of the invention can be administered in vivo either alone or in combination with other pharmaceutical agents effective in the treatment of diseases and conditions In which CB1 receptor activation plays a role or is implicated including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, such as specific COX-2 inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib and rofecoxib) and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g. acetylsalicylic acid, Propionic acid derivatives), vanilloid receptor antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. Anafranil®, Asendin®, Aventyl®. Elavil®, Endep®, Norfranil®, Norpramin®, Pamelor®, Sinequan®, Sumnontll®, Tipramlne®, Tofranil®, Vivactil®, Tofranil-PM®), anticonvulsants (e.g. gabapentin), and GABAB agonists (e.g. L-baclofen).<br><br>
The pharmaceutical compositions for separate administration of the combination partners and for the administration in a fixed combination, i.e. a single galenical composition comprising at least two combination partners, according to the invention can be prepared in a manner known per se and are those suitable for enteral, such as oral or rectal, and parenteral administration to mammals, including man, comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one pharmacologically active combination partner alone or in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carries, especially suitable for enteral or parenteral application.<br>
Novel pharmaceutical composition contain, for example, from about 0.1 % to about 99.9 %, preferably from about 20 % to about 60 %, of the active ingredients. Pharmaceutical preparations for the combination therapy for enteral or parenteral administration are, for example, those in unit dosage forms, such as sugar-coated tablets, tablets, capsules or suppositories, and furthermore ampoules. If not indicated otherwise, these are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional mixing, granulating, sugar-coating, dissolving or lyophilizing processes. It will be appreciated that the unit content of a combination partner contained in an individual dose of each dosage form need not in itself constitute an effective amount since the necessary effective amount can be reached by administration of a plurality of dosage units.<br>
In particular, a therapeutically effective amount of each of the combination partners may be administered simultaneously or sequentially and in any order, and the components may be administered separately or as a fixed combination. For example, the method of delay of progression or treatment of a proliferative disease according to the invention may comprise (i) administration of the combination partner (a) in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form and (ii) administration of a combination partner (b) in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, simultaneously or sequentially in any order, in jointly therapeutically effective amounts, preferably in synergistically effective amounts, e.g. in daily dosages corresponding to the amounts described herein. The individual combination partners can be administered separately at different times during the course of therapy or concurrently in divided or single combination fonns. Furthermore, the term administering also encompasses the use of a pro-drug of a combination partner that convert in vivo to the combination partner as such. The instant invention is therefore to be understood as embracing all such regimes of simultaneous or alternating treatment and the term "administering" is to be Interpreted accordingly.<br><br>
The effective dosage of each of the combination partners employed may vary depending on the particular compound or pharmaceutical composition employed, the mode of administration, the condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated. Thus, the dosage regimen is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including the route of administration and the renal and hepatic function of the patient. A physician, clinician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the single active ingredients required to prevent, counter or arrest the progress of the condition. Optimal precision in achieving concentration of the active ingredients within the range that yields efficacy without toxicity requires a regimen based on the kinetics of the active ingredients* availability to target sites. In general, satisfactory results in animals are indicated to be obtained at daily dosages of from about 0.01 to about 20.0 mg/kg p.o. In humans, an indicated daily dosage is in the range of from about 0.7 to about 1400 mg/day p.o., e.g. from about 50 to 200 mg (70 kg man), conveniently administered once or in divided doses up to 4 x per day or in sustained release form. Oral dosage forms accordingly suitably comprise from about 1.75 or 2.0 to about 700 or 1400 mg.<br>
