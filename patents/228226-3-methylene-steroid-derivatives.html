				<td>The invention relates to new 3-methylene steroid derivatives with therapeutic effects and to the preparation of pharmaceutical preparations comprising a 3-aIkylidene steroid.<br>
Steroids with methylene substituents at the 3 position of the steroid skeleton and 1-2 or 4-5 double bonds are known and claimed to be useful for therapeutic use (BE 696,235 and BE 654,772, respectively). The presumed medical indication is due to anabolic, estrogenic and progestogenic actions. None of these compounds has lived up to the expectations for such use and there was no expectation for utility as medicines in other areas, although many diseases still remain unsatisfactorily treated with presently available drugs. Notably, diseases of the immune system, such as rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune diseases are in need for better drugs. Corticosteroidal agents are of some use for the treatment of these diseases, but improvements, both with respect to efficacy and number or severity of side effects, are needed.<br>
This invention provides for 3-methylene steroid derivatives and prodrugs thereof, which steroid derivatives have the general formula 1<br>
wherein <br>
R1 is H or together with R5 forms a P-epoxide or R1 is absent if there is a 5-10 or 4-5<br>
double bond;<br>
R2is(CrC5)aIkylorCF3;<br>
R3is pH, PCH3 or together with R1 forms a p-epoxide or R3 is absent if there is a 5-10<br>
double bond;<br>
R4 is H, lower alkyl;<br>
Y is [H, H] [OH, H] =0, [OH, lower alkyl], [OH, (C2-C5)alkenyl], [OH, (C2-<br>
C;)alkynyl] or (C]-C6Jalkylidene, whereby said alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl and alkyljdene<br>

Preferred compounds according to the invention are those wherein R4 is H and Y is [OH, H],=0, [OH, lower alkyl], [OH, (C2-C5)alkenyl], [OH, (C2-C5)alkynyl] or (C,-C6)alkylidene, whereby said alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl and alkylidene optionally might be halogenated.<br>
In this description terms have the following meaning:<br>
A lower alkyl is a branched or unbranched alkyl group having preferably 1 -6 carbon<br>
atoms, like hexyl, isobutyl, tertiary butyl, propyl, isopropyl, ethyl, and methyl. Most<br>
preferred are alkyl groups having 1-3 carbon atoms.<br>
(C|-C5)alkyl is a branched or unbranched alkyl group having 1-5 carbon atoms, for<br>
example methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl etc.; Preferred are alkyl<br>
groups having 1-3 carbon atoms.<br>

Prodrugs are compounds which are designed to form a compound of the invention in<br>
the body of a recipient for treatment. In general such prodrugs can be esters or ethers<br>
of the 17-hydroxyl function.<br>
A preferred embodiment of this invention is a compound as described above having a<br>
5-10 double bond. Most preferred is the compound (7a,17a)-7-methyl-3-methylene-<br>
19-norpregn-5(10)-en-20-yn-17-ol.<br>

The use of compounds as defined by formula 1 is for immunomodulation in mammals, A compound of this invention can in particular be used in the treatment of arthritic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and autoimmune diseases (AIDs) such as Sjdgren"s syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It can also be used prophylactically for such diseases. Furthermore, a compound according to this invention can be used for the preparation of medicines comprising a compound of this invention as an active constituent.<br>
The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the steroid compound according to the invention, mixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliaries, such as described in the standard reference Gennaro et al., Remtnington"s Pharmaceutical Sciences, (18th ed., Mack publishing Company, 1990, see especially Part 8: Pharmaceutical Preparations and Their Manufacture.). A mixture of one or more of the steroid compounds according to the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliaries may be compressed into solid dosage units, such as pills, tablets, or be processed into capsules or suppositories. By means of pharmaceutically suitable liquids the compounds can also be applied as an injection preparation in the form of a solution, suspension, emulsion, or as a spray, e.g. nasal spray. For making dosage units, e.g. tablets, the use of conventional additives such as fillers, colorants, polymeric binders and the like is contemplated. In general any pharmaceutically acceptable additive which does not interfere with the function of the active compounds can be used. The steroid compounds of the invention may also be included in an implant, a patch, a gel, and any other preparation for sustained release.<br><br>
Suitable carriers with which the compositions can be administered include lactose, starch, cellulose derivatives and the like, or mixtures thereof used in suitable amounts.<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to the use of the steroid compound according to the invention for the manufacture of a medicament for modulation of the immune system of a mammal. More specifically, the invention relates to the use of the steroid compound according to the invention for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of arthritic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and autoimmune diseases (AIDs) such as Sjogren"s syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Such medicaments can also be prepared for prophylactic use for such diseases. The medicament is preferably made suitable, in particular for the treatment of human beings by complying to the regulations of health authorities in diverse countries. The use of the 3-methylene steroid derivatives (7a,17p)-7a-methyl-3-methylene-4-estren-17-ol, (7a, 17a)-7-methyl-3-methylene-19-norpregn-4-ene-17-ol, (7a, 17a)-7-methyl-3-methylene-19,21-dinorpregn-4-ene-17-ol, (7a)-17-keto-7-methyl-3-methylene-4-estrene, (7a,17a)-7-methyl-3-methylene-19-norpregn-4-en-20-yn-17-ol, 17p-hydroxy-7a-methyI-3-methylene-17a-(2-propenyI)-4-estrene, and 17p-hydroxy-7a-methyl-3-methylene-17a-(2-methyl-2-propenyl)-4-estrene is within the ambit of the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, theinvention pertains to the treatment of arthritic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and autoimmune diseases (AIDs) such as Sjogren"s syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), comprising the administration to a patient of a compound as described previously (in a suitable pharmaceutical dosage form).<br>
The dosage amounts of the present steroids will be of the range of from 0.001 to 100 mg per administration of a subject in need of treatment. Consequently dosage units for practical use of a compound of this invention can contain an amount of active ingredient in the range of from 0.001 to 100 mg.<br>
The immuno-modulating properties of a compound of this invention can be demonstrated and used in the following procedures.<br><br>
In the delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) procedure, the effect of a compound on the development of an immune reaction can be observed in mice (details in example 16). Briefly, the compound is administered daily and the animals are immunized subsequently with an antigen in adjuvant. After 7 days the animals are challenged locally by injecting the antigen locally (mostly in the foot) and measuring the subsequently developing local swelling in response to the deposition of the antigen. The degree of this swelling is related to the development of an immune response against the eliciting antigen. The inhibiting action of a compound of this invention on the development of this swelling can be determined, by comparing the treatment group with a placebo treated group. As a reference treatment, administration of glucocorticoids can be used.<br>
The effect of a compound of this invention was also tested in arthritic mice.<br>
In this procedure, mice are immunized with collagen type II, mostly from bovine<br>
cartilage, in an adjuvant. After three weeks a booster with the same antigen is given.<br>
Approximately 7-10 days after the booster reaction edema of the joints (especially in<br>
the hind and forefeet) can be observed. This swelling increases rapidly, leading to<br>
redness,   inflammation and distortion  of normal  function.   Upon X-ray  analysis<br>
disruption of normal joint architecture can be observed. Upon histological examination<br>
of these joints,   severe  inflammation  leading to  disruption of normal  cartilage<br>
architecture can be observed. The degree of observable alterations can be graded;<br>
moreover, the degree of histological alterations can be graded also.<br>
Furthermore, the effect of a compound on this invention can be observed in non-obese<br>
diabetic (NOD)-mice.<br>
In this procedure, mice spontaneously and gradually develop auto-immune diseases<br>
with symptoms resembling those of human insulin dependent diabetes mellitus<br>
(IDDM) and Sjogren"s syndrome.<br>
Sjogren"s syndrome is characterized by the development of infiltrates in the salivary<br>
and lachrymal gland. In NOD mice especially the salivary gland is characterized by the<br>
gradual development of infiltrates. A compound of this invention inhibits dose-<br>
dependently the development of these infiltrates in the submandibular glands.<br>
IDDM is characterized by the development of infiltrates in the pancreas, leading to<br>
destruction of the islets of Langerhans producing insulin. After the gradual destruction<br><br>
of all  these  islets,  no   insulin production  is  present  anymore  resulting  in the<br>
development of IDDM.<br>
In the following examples the invention is illustrated.<br>

Example 16<br>
Delayed type hypersensitivity (DTIT) reaction<br>
Groups of eight female Balb/c (Harlan, Zeist, The Netherlands) mice were used,<br>
approximately 8 weeks of age at the start of the experiment. These mice were housed<br>
in Macrolon cages, under standard conditions and acclimatized for 3-5 days before the<br>
start of the experiment. The groups received either compound or placebo.<br>
They were weighed on day 1 and on the last treatment day. Animals were treated once<br>
daily by subcutaneous (sc) injection in the back of the neck or by oral gavage from day<br>
1 till day 11 with a test compound in concentration range from 1.2, 3, 4, 6, to 12<br><br>
mg/kg. The injection volume was 0.1 mL of a vehicle for injection consisting of<br>
physiological saline containing 0.5% gelatin and 5% mannitol. A placebo treated<br>
group (vehicle only) and a group treated with 4 mg/kg dexamethasone as reference<br>
compound were included in each experiment.<br>
On day 2, animals were immunized with 0.1 ml of a stable suspension of 3.75 Lf<br>
Tetanus Toxoid antigen (TT from the RIVM, Zeist, The Netherlands) in 1 mg/ml<br>
dimethyl dioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA) from Phase Sep, at 2 places on the<br>
breast intradermalJy.<br>
On day 9 animals were challenged on the ventral side of the right [R] paw with 0.05<br>
mL of a solution containing 50 Lf TT and 1 mg Al(OH)3 per mL. The left [L] footpad<br>
(control) received the vehiculum with Al(OH)3 only. After 24 and 48 hours, the left<br>
and right footpad thickness (parameters L and R, respectively) were measured with a<br>
calipers densitometer in mm and the percentage of antigen-specific footpad swelling<br>
was calculated according to the formula: [(R - L)/L] x 100%.<br>
Results<br><br>
Example 17<br>
non-obese diabetic (NOD)-mice<br>
NOD mice used, were either bred in house (breeding pairs originally obtained from Hattori, Boston, USA, at generation 58) or obtained from Bomholtgard (Denmark) at 6-7 weeks of age.<br><br>
Only female mice were used for assessing effects of compounds on spontaneous sialoadenitis development, as characterized by leucocyte infiltrations in submandibular glands.<br>
Groups of 6-8 female mice were housed under standard conditions and treated once daily (either sc. or orally) from week 8 till 14 or 20 weeks of age with 0.1 ml of compound (concentration. 1.2, 4, or 12 mg/kg/day) or placebo (vehicle only) or were not treated. From week 12 onwards they were tested weekly for the presence of urinary glucose (Diabur-test 5000, Boehringer Mannheim).<br>
At week 8 (pre-treatment-group) or at week 14 or 20, after respectively 6 or 12 weeks of treatment, animals were killed under ether anesthesia; organs were removed, dissected free of fat and weighed. Submandibular glands were fixed in sublimate-formol for 18-24 hours and transferred to alcohol 70%. Tissue sections were embedded in paraffin and HE stained according to standards methods. Scoring of tissue sections for infiltrates was microscopically performed by two independent observers according to standard methods. Activity of compounds of this invention can be demonstrated in this test.<br>
Example 18<br>
Collagen arthritis<br>
Female DBA-1J/BOM mice were purchased from Bomholtgard, Denmark. All animals<br>
were housed under standard conditions and acclimatized for at least 7 days.<br>
At the age of 10-12 weeks all animals were immunized intradermally at the base of the<br>
tail with 100|ig of an emulsion of purified bovine collagen type II [CIIj (2 mg/mL in<br>
0.05 acetic acid) emulsified in equal volumes of Complete Freund"s Adjuvant (CFA,<br>
containing 4 mg/mL MT H37Ra, Difco Laboratories, Detroit, USA). At 21 days after<br>
immunization, a booster injection was administered intraperitoneally of lOOjig CII<br>
dissolved in saline. Treatment was given once daily starting at day 1 (day before<br>
immunization) until autopsy at day 44.<br>
Groups consisting of 9 to 10 animals were treated either with test compound (1.5<br>
mg/kg/day daily until day 22, from that day on reduced to 3 times a week), or<br>
cyclosporin A (100 mg/kg/day initially, from day 4, 20 mg/kg), or dexamethasone (2<br>
mg/kg/day), or vehicle (5% Mulgofen(EL 719, GAF) in saline). A non-treated control<br>
group was included.<br><br>
Mice were weighed every week, and clinical arthritis activity (visual appearance of arthritis in peripheral joints) was scored (according to standard methods) by one observer not aware of the treatment given, from day 19 onward every 2-3 days, until autopsy at day 44.<br>
Clinical arthritis was graded on a scale of 0-2 per paw and expressed as a cumulative arthritis score per mouse with a maximum score of 8. At the end of the experiment knee and ankle joints were isolated and used for X-ray analysis as a marker for bone destruction, followed by immediate fixation in 4% formaldehyde for histology. X-ray photographs were carefully examined using a stereo microscope and bone destruction of joints was scored on a scale of 0-5 according to standard methods/ranging from undamaged to complete destruction. Activity of compounds of this invention can be demonstrated in this test.<br><br><br><br>
