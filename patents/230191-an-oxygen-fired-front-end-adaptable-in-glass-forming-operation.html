				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD AND INDUSTRIAL<br>
APPLICABILITY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to forming operations in the glass fabrication industry and<br>
more particularly to a front end for use in forming operations. Most particularly, this<br>
invention relates to an oxygen-fired front end for use in glass forming operations.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the fabrication of glass articles, batch material is reduced to molten glass by<br>
passing the batch material through a melting furnace, which is commonly referred to as a<br>
melter. The molten glass is delivered downstream from the melter through a system of<br>
channels and forehearths. This system of channels and forehearths is referred to as a front<br>
end. The front end serves as a conduit to deliver the molten glass to one or more<br>
production points. The front end also serves to cool and condition the molten glass prior<br>
to reaching the production points. These production points are referred to as forming<br>
positions. Each forming position includes a bushing for a fiber forming operation or a gob<br>
cutter for a container forming operation. Bushings or gob cutters typically are secured to<br>
the forehearths via forehearth steel.<br>
A conventional forehearth is provided with a firing system, which includes a<br>
plurality of burners 20. The burner 20 functions to condition the molten glass G and<br>
maintain the molten glass G at a desired operational temperature. An example of a<br>
conventional forehearth 10 is shown in FIG. 1. The forehearth 10 includes a top or crown<br>
(not shown), a bottom (also not shown), and laterally spaced sidewalls 16. Portions of the<br>
forehearth 10 above the level of the molten glass G are constructed of super structure<br>
refractory. Portions of the forehearth 10 below the level of the molten glass G are<br>
constructed of glass contact refractory.<br>
A plurality of burner ports 18 is drilled through the sidewalls 16. The burner ports<br>
18 are drilled through the super structure of the forehearth 10. The burner ports 18 are<br>
drilled at a right angle relative to the sidewalls 16. The burner ports 18 are adapted to<br>
receive burners 20. The burner ports 18 are spaced about four to five inches from one<br>
another. Consequently, a large number of burners, manifolds, pipes, fittings and valves<br>
(not shown) are associated with air-gas mixture burners.<br><br>
In a conventional firing system, a source of air and a source of gas pass through<br>
regulators. The air and gas are mixed and then passed through a system of<br>
pipes to a plurality of burners, typically 20 to 100 burners. The burners are<br>
typically air-gas mixture burners which use the air as an oxidant for the<br>
combustion of the gas to provide heat to a zone, commonly referred to as a<br>
control zone, The front end typically has between six and sixty control zones,<br>
each complete with complete with a gas control safety and pressure reduction<br>
system, combustion air blowers, and valves and regulators capables of<br>
controlling the temperature of the molten glass G between the melter and the<br>
forming position.<br>
An air-gas mixture firing system is not only costly to construct, it is inefficient to<br>
operate. An air-gas mixture firing system uses 30 to 75 cubic feet per hour<br>
(0.849 to 2.123 cubic meter per hour) of gas to heat a one-foot section of<br>
channel with an air-gas mixture. It requires about 10 cubic feet (0.283 cubic<br>
meter) of air for combustion of 1 cubic foot (0.028 cubic meter) of natural gas.<br>
The air must be heated from an ambient temperature to the temperature of the<br>
exhaust gas stream. About 70 to 85 percent of the energy heats the air to the<br>
exhaust gas temperature, feaving 15 to 30 percent of the energy as heat<br>
available for the glass forming operation. Thus, an air-gas mixture firing system<br>
has minimum firing system has minimum efficiency of combustion.<br>
In addition to having a minimum efficiency of combustion, an air-gas mixture<br>
firing system is an inefficient means to heat the molten glass G. The flame<br>
temperature of an air-gas mixture burner in the air-gas mixture firing system<br>
reaches about 350°F (1926.66°C). However, the optical properties of the molten<br><br>
glass G and products of combustion limit the amount of radiant energy that<br>
penetrates the molten glass G. This causes the vertical temperature gradient of<br>
the molten glass G to be high. With air-gas burners it is difficult to control the<br>
temperature distribution in the glass by controlling the profile of the burners.<br>
EP0508139 discloses a glass melting furnace with high-momentum, oxygen-fired<br>
auxiliary burner mounted in the front wall. The glass melting furance having an<br>
upstream melting zone and a downstream fining zone, wherein the glass forming<br>
ingredients are introduced to the upstream melting zone via inlet means and the<br>
resulting melt therefrom travel along a path from the melting zone to the fining<br>
zone, said melt being withdrawn from outlet means which communicate with the<br>
fining zone, there is provided at least one high momentum oxygen-fired flame in<br>
the vicinity of said outlet means to sweep unmelted glass forming ingredients<br>
floating on the surface of the melt away from said vicinity and so prevent said<br>
unmelted glass forming ingredients from entering the outlet means whereby the<br>
contamination of an outflowing molten glass from said outlet means is avoided<br>
or reduced.<br>
WO03084885 describes an oxygen-fired front end for glass forming operation.<br>
The front end comprises an open channel (22) and at least one burner (44). The<br>
channel has at least one surface (40). The surface has at least one hole (42A)<br>
therein. The burner is oriented in the hole at an acute angle relative to the<br>
surface. In another embodiment of the invention, the channel has a top (24C)<br>
and a pair of sidewalls (28A) each having a surface (40, 46). At least one hole<br>
(42A, 42C) is in at least one of the surfaces. The hole is at an acute angle<br>
relative to at least one surface. The burner is an oxygen-fired burner. In yet<br><br>
The present invention is also directed toward a front end comprising a channel<br>
having a top and a pair of sidewalls each having a surface. At least one burner port is in at<br>
least one of the surfaces. The burner port is at an acute angle relative to at least one<br>
surface. The burner is an oxygen-fired burner.<br>
The present invention is further directed toward a front end comprising a channel<br>
having a top and sidewalls each having a super structure surface constructed of refractory<br>
material. The channel has an upstream end and a downstream end. At least one of the<br>
surfaces has a plurality of burner ports therein. The burner ports extend at an acute angle<br>
relative to at least one surface and in a plane extending between the upstream end and the<br>
downstream end, and perpendicular to at least one surface. Oxygen-fired burners extend<br>
axially through corresponding burner ports.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND PREFERED<br>
EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
To overcome the deficiencies of an air-gas mixture firing system, concentric-type<br>
oxygen-gas mixture burners have been developed. A typical oxygen-gas firing system is<br>
supplied by BH-F) (ENGINEERING) LTD. of England. The system uses burners<br>
commonly referred to as oxygen-gas burners. Oxygen-gas burners 44 use oxygen (for<br>
example, typically 90 to 99 percent purity with an impurity being a combination of<br>
nitrogen and argon) in a high purity as an oxidant and fossil fuel for a combustible<br>
hydrocarbon supply. The oxygen-gas burner 44 ignites the mixture of oxygen and gas at<br>
the point of ignition or combustion. The oxygen-gas burners are placed 4-5 inches (10.16-<br>
12.7 centimeters) apart, similar to the spacing to the air-gas mixture burners described<br>
above. To date gas-oxygen burners 44 have been used in glass melters but have not been<br>
used in the channel or front end of a glass<br>
The oxygen-gas burners 44 reduce C02 and N02 emissions, making these burners<br>
more environmentally friendly and possibly reducing greenhouse gas taxes. Oxygen-gas<br>
burners 44 fire more efficiently by reducing the waste gas stream and providing more<br>
available heat for use in the glass forming operation. This is because an oxygen-gas<br>
burner requires less volume (that is, 2 cubic feet (0.056 cubic meter) of oxygen) for<br>
combustion of 1 cubic foot (0.028 cubic meter) of natural gas. Consequently, exhaust<br>
gases (that is, the stream of gas used to heat the oxygen-gas mixture) are reduced by about<br>
73 percent. As a result, about 65 percent of the energy in an oxygen-gas mixture firing<br>
system is used to transfer available heat to the glass rather than heating inert gasses such<br>
as nitrogen.<br>
In addition to having a greater efficiency of combustion, an oxygen-gas mixture<br>
firing system is a more efficient means to heat the molten glass. The flame temperature of<br>
an oxygen-gas burner 44 is about 4500°F to 4800°F (2482.22°C-2648.88°C). At this<br>
temperature, the flame and products of combustion radiate energy at wavelengths that the<br>
molten glass can absorb. This provides uniform glass temperature horizontally on the<br>
surface of the molten glass and vertically through the molten glass.<br>
Referring now to the drawings, there is illustrated in FIG. 2 a front end of a glass<br>
forming operation. The front end comprises an open channel and a forehearth downstream<br>
of the open channel. To simplify the description, the channel and forehearth will be<br><br>
cooperatively described as a channel 22. The channel 22 delivers molten glass G from a<br>
melter (not shown) to a forming position (not shown).<br>
Molten glass G does not contact an upper portion of the channel 22 above the<br>
molten glass level L shown in FIG. 4 and FIG. 5. Because the super structure refractory<br>
material used for the upper portion are not required to withstand corrosive effects of<br>
molten glass G, the upper portion can be constructed from relatively inexpensive super<br>
structure refractory material, such as silica, mullite, or other suitable materials.<br>
The portion of the channel 22, below the glass level L comes into contact with the<br>
molten glass G and is constructed of a more costly glass contact refractory material. A<br>
ceramic refractory material such as zircon, chromic oxide, or other suitable material is<br>
used as the glass contact refractory material.<br>
The channel 22 may comprise a top or crown 24 a bottom 54, and sidewalls 28A.<br>
The channel 22 has an upstream end, generally indicated at 30, and a downstream end,<br>
generally indicated at 32. An open end 34 may be provided at the downstream end 32 of<br>
the channel 22. An end wall 36 may be provided at the upstream end 30 of the channel 22.<br>
One or more glass orifices 38 may be provided in the bottom of the channel 22 proximate,<br>
adjacent or close to the end wall 36. The forehearth of the front end is that portion of the<br>
channel 22 having the end wall 36 and the glass orifices 38 in the bottom.<br>
The sidewalls 28 each define a surface 40. The surfaces 40 have at least one<br>
burner port 42 therein. The burner port 42 may be drilled in the super structure refractory<br>
material of existing front ends with a refractory core drill. New front ends may be<br>
constructed with built-in burner blocks having burner ports 42 formed therein (see FIG. 4).<br>
A burner 44 is provided in the burner port 42. In a preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
a plurality of burner ports 42 is provided and a burner 44 is provided in each of the burner<br>
ports 42. The burners 44 are preferably oxygen-fired burners, wherein oxygen (in high<br>
purity) and gas are mixed at a point of ignition or combustion. That is to say, the burners<br>
use oxygen as an oxidant and fossil fuel for a combustible hydrocarbon supply. Such<br>
burners are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art of the invention.<br>
The burners 44 are positioned above the glass level L (shown in FIGS. 4 and 5).<br>
The burners 44 are oriented in a plane (for example, a substantially horizontal plane)<br>
perpendicular to the surfaces 40 and at an acute angle relative to the surfaces 40. The<br>
burners 44 are pointed toward the downstream end 32 of the channel 22 at an angle<br>
between about 5 degrees to about 85 degrees relative to the surfaces 40, as shown in FIG.<br><br>
2. Alternatively, the burners 44 can be pointed toward the upstream end 30 of the channel<br>
22 at an angle between about 95 degrees to about 175 degrees relative to the surfaces 40,<br>
as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
With reference to FIG. 2, the burners 44 may be staggered or alternatively spaced<br>
so that burners 44 in opposing sidewalk 28 are laterally or vertically offset or do not align<br>
with one another. The flame temperature of an oxygen-fired burner is about 4200°F-<br>
5200°F (2315.55oC-2871.11oC). The flame is controlled by gas and oxygen flow so that<br>
the flame does not directly contact the sidewalk 28. Although the flame does not directly<br>
contact the sidewalk 28, the sidewalk 28 are heated by convection or radiation from the<br>
flame. This radiant heat is sufficient to properly condition the molten glass G and<br>
maintain the molten glass G at a desired temperature without compromising the integrity<br>
of the channel 22 by exposing the channel 22 to excessively high temperatures. Using the<br>
forhearth of the present invention, burners 44 may be spaced between about 1 foot (0.304<br>
meter) to about 5 feet (1.524 meter) apart and provide sufficient heat to the glass.<br>
A burner port 43 may be provided in the end wall 36 to be used as an exhaust<br>
burner port or to support another burner 44 to provide additional heat to condition or to<br>
maintain the molten glass G at a desired temperature.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is shown in FIG. 3. In FIG. 3, the burners<br>
44 are provided in pairs. In this embodiment of the invention, opposing burners 44 are<br>
typically not staggered or alternatively spaced. The opposing burners 44 may be laterally<br>
or vertically aligned to provide more uniform distribution of heat may be provided.<br>
In the present invention, the burners 44 may be oriented so that the flames of<br>
opposing burners 44 cause one another to reflect toward the sidewalk 28 of the channel<br>
22. It is also possible to angle the burners 44 downward at an angle in a range from about<br>
0 degrees to about 20 degrees.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, channel 22 may have a surface 46 defined by the top 24 of the<br>
channel 22. This surface 46 has at least one burner port 42 therein. A burner 44 is<br>
provided in the burner port 42. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a plurality of<br>
burner ports 42 is provided and a burner 44 is provided in each of the burner ports 42. The<br>
burners 44 are preferably oxygen-fired burners.<br>
The burners 44 may be oriented in a plane (for example, a substantially vertical<br>
plane) perpendicular to the surface 46 and at an acute angle B relative to the surface 46. In<br><br>
one embodiment of the present invention, the burners 44 are pointed toward the upstream<br>
end 30 of the channel 22 at an angle between about 5 degrees to about 85 degrees relative<br>
to the surface 46, as shown in FIG. 4. Alternatively, the burners 44 may be pointed toward<br>
the downstream end 32 of the channel 22 at an angle B between about 95 degrees to about<br>
175 degrees relative to the surface 46, similar to the burners 44 shown in FIG. 3.<br>
As shown in the drawings, a hole 43 may be provided in the end wall 36 of the<br>
channel 22. The hole 43 may be used as an exhaust vent for the channel 22. In another<br>
embodiment of the invention, hole 43 may be a burner port used to support another burner<br>
44. Although, burner 44 in burner port 43 in the end wall 36 may be oriented at an angle<br>
A of about 15 degrees relative the top surface 46, as shown in FIG. 4, other angles may be<br>
suitable for carrying out the invention. For example, if burner port 43 is in end wall 36,<br>
then burner 44 be at any angle B ranging from about 5 degrees to about 90 degrees (or<br>
horizontal) relative to the end wall 36. When burner port 43 is in the junction of the end<br>
wall 36 and the top surface 46, the burner 44 can be at any angle B ranging from about 5<br>
degrees to about 85 degrees relative to the end wall 36.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the invention is shown in FIG. 5. The channel 22<br>
according to this embodiment of the invention is a hybrid channel having an intermediate<br>
cooling channel 48 and diametrically disposed burners 44. Although the burners 44<br>
shown are provided in the top 24 of the channel 22, the burners 44 may be provided in the<br>
sidewalk 28. This embodiment of the invention is useful in wider firing zones where<br>
some cooling is desired, such as in glass container forming operations. Such operations<br>
typically are used channels that measure at least 5 feet (1.5 m) wide.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6 a burner design which may be used in the present invention is<br>
a tube in tube type burner. Oxygen supply stream 56 is fed into tube 66. Natural gas<br>
supply stream 58 is fed into burner tube 68 at the center of oxygen supply tube 66. Tubes<br>
66 and 68 may be concentric tubes where the inner natural gas supply tube 68 extends<br>
beyond the distal end of outer oxygen supply tube 66. Burner block 60 may be formed of<br>
any high temperature refractory such as mullite. Burner block 60 has a central bore to<br>
receive the natural gas supply tube 68 and oxygen supply tube 66 and may contain a<br>
conical outlet portion to allow for the expansion of the combustion gasses. A preferred<br>
burner block allows for low flow of combustion gasses and allows for insertion of the<br>
burner 44 in the top of the channel. The tube in tube design provides for controlled mixing<br><br>
of the oxygen and gas to prevent high temperatures at the nozzle and in the burner block.<br>
The fuel flow ranges from 25,000 tol50,000 btu (2.6xl06- 1.6xl07 J).<br>
The fueltube 68 is positioned to prevent immediate mixing of the fuel and oxygen.<br>
The burner 44 delivers a small high temperature flame along a channel.<br>
In each of the foregoing embodiments of the invention, the burners 44 may be<br>
oriented so that the burner flame is not pushed into the top 24 or the sidewalk 28.<br>
Moreover, the burners 44 should also be separated and the flame tempered so that<br>
excessive levels of heat are not reached within the channel 22. This avoids the risk of<br>
overheating the top 24 the sidewalls, and/or the burner nozzle, resulting in damage to the<br>
refractory material or burners 44.<br>
In each of the foregoing embodiments of the invention, the burners 44 may be<br>
formed of a high temperature a nickel-chromium-molybdenum-niobium alloy such as<br>
INCONEL alloys are available from Special Metals Corporation of New Hartford, New<br>
York. Suitable INCONEL alloys include 600,601,617,625,625 LCF, 706,718,718 725,<br>
725 HS, SPF, X-750, MA754,783,792, and HX nickel chromium alloys. The nickel-<br>
chromium-molybdenum-niobium alloys have good resistance to oxidation, reducing<br>
environments, corrosive environments, high temperature environments, relaxation<br>
resistance and mechanical properties. Other suitable burner materials include high<br>
temperature stainless steel such as RA410, RA410S, RA17-4, RA304, RA316, RA321,<br>
RA347, RAM303, RA304, and RA316 available from Rolled Alloys of Temperance,<br>
Michigan.<br>
In each of the foregoing embodiments of the invention, the flow of oxygen is<br>
preferably about 20 to 200 cubic feet (0.566 to 5.663 cubic meter) per hour for each burner<br>
44. Any gas that requires this amount of flow for complete combustion may be suitable<br>
for carrying out the invention. The oxygen demand is typically independent of the gas<br>
used.<br>
The front end of the invention is advantageous because it uses fewer burners, fewer<br>
valves, fewer fittings, and a smaller number of associated manifolds and pipes. Firing is<br>
more efficient, therefore less fuel is consumed. Consequently, fuel pipe sizes are reduced.<br>
There is also a large reduction of pipe sizes for piping oxygen as opposed to air<br>
Installation costs are also reduced.<br>
In accordance with the provisions of the patent statutes, the principle and mode of<br>
operation of this invention have been explained and illustrated in its preferred<br><br>
embodiment. However, it must be understood that this invention may be practiced<br>
otherwise than as specifically explained and illustrated without departing from its spirit or<br>
scope.<br>
The invention of this application has been described above both generically and<br>
with regard to specific embodiments. Although the invention has been set forth in what is<br>
believed to be the preferred embodiments, a wide variety of alternatives known to those of<br>
skill in the art can be selected within the generic disclosure. The invention is not<br>
otherwise limited, except for the recitation of the claims set forth below.<br><br>
