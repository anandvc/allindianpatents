COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
       (See Section 10)<br>
A TWO COMPONNENT HAIR/SKIN COLOURING SYSTEM<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the  nature  of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
GRANTED<br><br>
19-10-2001<br><br>
Technical Field:<br>
The present invention relates to compositions for changing the colour of keratinic fibers especially human hair. The composition can also be used to increase the colour of human skin. The composition is especially useful to obtain a range of desired colours on hair.<br>
Background and Prior art:<br>
Melanins are naturally occurring pigments present in hair and skin and are synthesised in the melanocytes in presence of the enzyme tyrosinase. Two different melanins are found in human hair, the blonde, brown and black hair contain eumelanin while Pheomelanin is found in red hair. The enzyme tyrosinase catalyses the hydroxylation of tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and its subsequent oxidation to dopachrome which further undergoes a series of complex reactions to form eumelanins and pheomelanins.<br>
Cosmetic purposes has made the alteration of colouration of hair very popular. The discovery of synthetic hair dyes simplified the process of dyeing hair and gave much more reliable and versatile results in comparison the natural dyes. The<br><br>
preference to use natural materials is very high although this process has a lot of inconveniences and problems.<br>
Aqueous hair dyeing compositions produced by reaction between DOPA and/or a salt thereof with an inorganic oxidant such as soluble ammonium, sodium and potassium salts of ferricyanide and potassium permanganate in a buffered system<br>
  with a pH range of 6 to 10, is reported (US 5279618, Clairol Inc.).<br><br>
US 5603734 reports a method of permanently colouring hair by applying at least one catechol, a persulphate oxidising agent and a buffering system to provide a pH 7 to 11.<br><br>
Use of quaternary amines along with compositions reported for colouring hair is known to improve the feel and combability of the hair after treatment (US 4402700).<br>
A novel natural hair colouring process described (Brown et.al., J of Soc. of Cos. Chemists, 48, 1997) relates to a process of converting DOPA on hair to 5,6-dihydroxyindole by careful selection of the oxidant. This indole is a precursor of black eumelanin and it is readily polymerised in situ to dye the hair black. They have also found that incorporation of sulfur-containing nucleophiles such as cysteine and other thiols into the above process produces a wide range of shades on hair.<br>
The prior art relates to the use of inorganic oxidants for the production of melanin on hair and the synthetic hair colourants are toxic and cause allergic reactions in many people.<br>
It has now been found that it is possible to colour hair using a colouring system comprising a cationic polymer and a synergistic mixture of natural plant extract and a phenol and a metal ion. The use of the polymer along with aforesaid components mixture will help in improved deposition of the colour on the hair and also give other benefits like feel and combability etc. It is also possible to generate a wide range of shades by the use of the mixture according to the invention. The product will be safe as the composition is natural based. Since this product increases melanin synthesis, it could also be used on skin to increase skin colour and in tanning preparations.<br>
Tamarindus is a monotypic genus of trees of the family Leguminosae represented by T.indica, indigenous to tropical Africa and South India, It is widely cultivated in the tropics and sub-tropics. The fruit of the tree is the most useful part which contains a sweetish, acidic pulp and hence used for souring of food products. It<br><br>
has now been found that a synergistic combination of the extract from the unripe fruits of this tree and a natural phenol can act as a hair dye.<br>
