				<td>The invention provides new materials and a novel method for their preparation by incorporating molecular, nanoscale, and macroscopic materials within a cellulose matrix.  The process involves encapsulation or immobilization of the active solid substcince in a cellulose framework by regenerating cellulose dissolved in an ionic liquid solvent in a regenerating solution.  The active substance can be initially present in the ionic liquid, or in the regenerating solvent, either as a solution, or as a dispersion. The invention is applicable to molecular encapsulation and to entrapping of larger particles including enzymes, nanoparticles and macroscopic components, and to the formation of bulk materials with a wide range of morphological forms.<br>
BACKGROUND ART The use of ionic liquids as replacements for conventional organic solvents in chemical, biochemical and separation processes has been demonstrated.  Graenacher first suggested a process for the preparation of cellulose solutions by heating cellulose in a liquid N-alkylpyridin.iura or N-<br><br>
arylpyridinium chloride salt, U.S. Patent No. 1,943,176, especially in the presence of a nitrogen-containing base such as pyridine. However, that finding seems to have been treated as a novelty of little practical value because the molten salt system was, at the time, somewhat esoteric.  This original work was tinderteken at a time when ionic liquids were essentially unknown and the application and value of ionic liquids as a class of solvents had not been realized.<br>
Ionic liquids are now a well-established class of liquids containing solely ionized species, and having melting points largely below 150°C or most preferably 100°C.  In most cases, ionic liquids (IL) are organic salts containing one or more cations that are typically ammonium, imidazolium or. pyridinium ions, although memy other types are known. The reinge of ionic liquids that axe applicable to the dissolution of cellulose are disclosed in US patent application Serial No. 10/256,521, filed on September 27, 2002, entitled "Dissolution and Processing of Cellulose Using Ionic Liquids*, that claimed priority from provisional application Serial no. 60/326,704 that was filed on October 3, 2001, and in Swatloski et al., J.   Am.   Chem.   Soc.   2002, 124:4974-4975.<br>
Traditional cellulose dissolution processes, including the cuprammonium and xanthate processes, are often cumbersome or expensive and require the use of unusual solvents, typically with a high ionic strength and are used under relatively harsh conditions.  [Kirk-Othmer "Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology", Fourth Edition 1993, volume 5, p. 476-563.]  Such solvents include carbon disulfide, N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMNO) , mixtures of N,N-<br><br><br>
dimethylacetamide and lithium chloride (I»4A,C/LiCl) , dimethylimidazolone/LiCl, concentrated aqueous inorganic salt solutions [ZnCl/HaO, Ca (SCN) 2/H2O] , concentrated mineral acids (H2SO4/H3PO4) or molten salt hydrates (LiClo4.3HaO, NaSCN/KSCN/LiSCaiT/HaO) .<br>
These traditional cellulose dissolution processes breeJc the cellulose polymer backbone resulting in regenerated piroducts that contain an average of about 500 to about 600 glucose units per molecule rather than the native larger number of about 1500 or more glucose units per molecule.  In addition, processes such as that used in rayon formation proceed via xanthate intermediates and tend to leave some residual derivatized (substituent groups bonded to) glucose residues as in xanthate group-containing cellualose.<br>
For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,792,399 teaches the use of N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMNO) solutions of cellulose to prepare regenerated cellulose that contained polyethyleneimine (PEI). That patent teaches that one should utilize a pre-treatment with the enzyme cellulase to lessen the molecular weight to the cellulose prior to dissolution.  In addition, it is taught that NMMNO deconposes at the ten¥&gt;erat\u:es used for dissolution to provide N-methylmorpholine as a degradation product that could be steam distilled away from the cellulose solution. The presence of PEI is said to lessen the decon^josition of the NMMNO.<br>
Other traditional processes that can provide a solubilized cellulose do so by foirming a substituent that is intended to remain bonded to the cellulose such as where cellulose esters like the acetate and butyrate esters are prepared, or where a<br><br>
carboxyraethyl, methyl, ethyl, C2-C3 2-hydroxyalkyl (hydroxyethyl or hydroxypropyl) , or the like group is added to the cellulose polymer.  Such derivative (siibstituent) formation also usually leads to a lessening of the degree of cellulose polymerization so that the resulting product contains fewer cellobiose units per molecule than the cellulose from which it was prepared.<br>
Thus, Linko and co-worker reported dissolving relatively low molecular weight cellulose (DP=880) in a mixture of N-ethylpyridinium chloride (NEPC) and dimethylformamide, followed by cooling to 30°C, incorporation of various microbial cells into the solution and then regeneration of the cellulose into a solid form by admixture with water.  [Linko et al. ,• Bnzyme Microb. Tecfanol., 1:26-30 (1979).]  That research group also reported entrapnent of yeast cells in a solution of 1 percent cellvilose dissolved in a mixture of NEPC and din«thyl sulfoxide, as well as entrapment using 7.5 to 15 percent cellulose di-or triacetates dissolved in several organic solvents. [Weckstrom et al., in Food Engineering in Food Processing, Vol. 2, Applied Science Publishers Ltd., pages 148-151 (1979).]<br>
Entrapped materials have a wide number of uses, from controlled release systems to structural modifiers and sensor or reactive materials.  The entrapped materials can be formulated as membranes, coatings or capsules.  Methods are known for forming encapsulated products including emulsion polymerization, interfacial polymerization, desolution, emulsification, gelation, spray-drying, vacuum coating, and adsorption onto porous particles. Common materials used include polymers.<br><br>
hydrocolloids, sugars, waxes, fats, metals and metal oxides.<br>
The use of membranes, coatings, and capsules for the controlled release of liquid materials is well known in the art of both agricultural and non-agricultural chemicals, including the preparation of graphic arts materials, pharmaceuticals, food, and pesticide formulations. In agriculture, controlled-reiease techniques have improved the efficiency of herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, and fertilizers.  Non-agricultural uses include encapsulated dyes, inks, pharmaceuticals, flavoring agents, and fragrances.<br>
The most common forms of controlled-reiease materials are coated droplets or microcapsules, coated solids, including both porous and non-porous paxticles, and coated aggregates of solid particles. In some instsmces, a water-soluble encapsulating film is desired, which releases the encapsulated material when the capsule is placed in contact with water. Other coatings are designed to release the entrapped material when the capsule is ruptured or degraded by external force.  Still further coatings are porous in nature and release the entrapped material to the surrovinding medium at a slow rate by diffusion through the pores.<br>
Materials have been formulated as emulsifiable concentrates by dissolving the materials in an organic solvent mixed with a surface-active agent or as an oily agent.  In solid form, the insecticides have been formulated as a wettable powder in which the insecticide is adsorbed onto finely powdered mineral matter or diatomaceous earth, as a dust or as granules.<br><br>
However, these conventional formulations pose a variety of problems such as the pollution of the environment caused by the organic solvent used in the emulsions or by the dust resulting from the wettable powders.  Furtherroore, for these formulations" to have long-term residual effectiveness, an amount much higher than that used in normal application is required, and this increased amount Ccin affect the environment or cause problems of safety.  Other conventional microcapsules that encapsulate active insecticidal components are obtained through an interfacial polymerization reaction cuad are not ideal in terms of the production process or as eui effective stabilized insecticide.<br>
There is therefore a strong demand for a formulation that maintains a high degree of efficacy over long periods. Given this backgroiind, research and development are now actively under way to develop a superior microencapsulated formulation that can effectively replace the emulsifiable concentrate, interfacially-polymerized or wettable powders, said is safer to use.<br>
Enzyme entrapment on solid supports is a well-established technique for improving stability and separations aspects in enzymatic transformations. Entrapment of enzymes on solid supports can result in improved stability to pH and tenperature and aid in separation of the enzyme from the reaction mixture, and also for formation of enzyme electrodes for sensor applications.<br>
There are four principal methods available for immobilizing enzymes: adsorption, covalent binding, entrapment, and membrane confinement.  A common method for immobilization is to use<br><br><br>
polysaccharide activation in which cellulose beads are reacted under alkali conditions with cyanogen bromide.  The intermediate produced is then covalently coupled with soluble enzymes.  Examples are lactase, penicillin acylase, and aminoacylase enzymes.<br>
Entrapment of enzymes within gels or fibers is a convenient method for use in processes involving low molecular weight substrates and products. Entrapment is the method of choice for immobilization of microbial, animal and plant cells.  Calcium alginate is widely used.  Enzymes can be entrapped in cellulose acetate fibers by formulation of an emulsion of the enzyme plus cellulose acetate in dichlorometheme, followed by extrusion of fibers.<br>
Entrapped enzyme methods have wide applicability, but the entrapped enzymes ccui be technically difficult to prepare and involve moderate to high costs. Hence, new methods of preparing entrapped enzymes are desirable.<br>
The disclosure hereinafter describes the preparation of encapsulated materials in a cellulose matrix by dispersion and  regeneration of IL/cellulose solutions containing eui active substance into a regenerating liquid in which the IL is soluble and that is a non-solvent for cellulose and the active agent.  It will be clear to those skilled in the art that this invention is applicable to the fomnulation of beads and fibers in which active agents are entrapped.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention contemplates a cellulose-encapsulated active substance and an<br><br>
encapsulation method for active substances to form a regenerated cellulose matrix in which the active substance is distributed throughout the matrix.  The distribution of the active substance is preferably substantially homogeneous within the matrix of regenerated cellulose.  The regenerated celltilose (i) has about the same molecular weight as the original cellulose from which it is prepared and typically a degree of polymerization (DP) of cdx&gt;ut 1200, and (ii) is substantially free of substituent groups and entrapped ionic liquid degradation products.  The material to be encapsulated (active siobstance) is dispersed, preferably homogeneously, or dissolved in a hydrophilic ionic liquid that is substantially free of water, cui organic solvent or nitrogen-containing base containing soliibilized cellulose, and the cellulose is subsequently reforttred (regenerated) as a solid in which the active substance is dispersed in the cellulose matrix, preferably homogeneously.<br>
This method has advsuitages for -foirmation of con^osites containing many solid substances which are desirable to encapsulate in a cellulose matrix, particularly for the incorporation of active agents that are not soluble in water or other common solvents, for example nanoparticles or macroscopic materials.<br>
Matrices formed by this process are capable of effecting a slow rate of release of the encapsulated materials by diffusion through the shell to the surrounding medium, swelling in a liquid medium such as water, by slow, controlled degradation of the cellulose matrix structure, or by slow dissolution of the active substance from within the matrix.<br><br>
Materials suitable for encapsulation include chemical-biological agents such as herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, animal, insect, and bird repellent, plant growth regulators, fertilizers, and flavor and odor conpositions, catalysts, photoactive agents, indicators, dyes, and UV adsorbents.<br>
The final morphological form of the encapsulated con^osite depends on the regeneration process and on the desired applications of the materials.  For example, high surface area beads, •cylinders or floes can be manufactured for filtration or separation applications, whereas thin films can be prepared for membrane and sensor uses.<br>
Entrapment of biomolecules on solid supports is a well-established techniqpae for in^jroving pH emd teitperature stcdaility particularly for enzymes and whole cells.  Entrapment of biomolecules within a cellulose support cam result in new materials for sensing and detection application.<br>
Macroscopic magnetite particles can be incorporated into cellulose to prepare magnetically modified materials. These materials have a number of applications in magnetic fluidized bed extraction processes for protein and metal extraction or detection.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides an encapsulation method for a wide range of materials referred to herein as active siibstances that can be effectively carried out to provide active substance substantially homogeneously distributed through out the regenerated cellulose matrix.  The method uses encapsulation by dispersion or dissolution in a hydrophilic ionic liquid containing solubilized<br><br>
cellulose, that- is substantially free of water, an organic solvent or nitrogen-containing base, followed by subsequent reformation of the cellulose as a solid matrix in which the active substance is dispersed in the matrix. The resulting material contains the active substance dispersed substantially homogeneously throughout the regenerated cellulose matrix.<br>
A method for the preptaration of new materials incorporating molecular, nanoscale and macroscopic materi.als within a cellulose matrix is contemplated.  A conteit^jlated method conten^jlates encapsulation of the active sxabstance by regenerating a polymer matrix from a hydrophilic ionic liquid (IL) solution containing the active solid substance into a regenerating solution in which both the cellulose and the active substance are insoluble or difficult to dissolve is described; i.e., substantially insoluble.<br>
More specifically, the method conten5)lates the steps of providing a homogeneous coit^josition that contains cellulose and an active substance dissolved or dispersed in a hydrophilic ionic liquid and in which the ionic liquid solution is substantially free of water, a non-ionic orgeinic solvent or nitrogen-containing base containing solubilized cellulose. That composition is contacted with a liquid non-solvent diluent in which both the cellulose and active substance are substauxtially insolxible to form a liquid phase and a regenerated solid cellulose phase as a matrix encapsulating the active siibstance and thereby form composite material that comprises a cellulose-encapsulated active substance.  Residual hydrophilic ionic liquid is preferably thereafter removed.  Examples of active substances include the<br><br>
incorporation of water-insolvible metal extractants, water-insoluble dyes, biomolecules, and magnetite particles of about 5 microns in diameter (largest dimension if not approximately spherical) that can be dispersed in the IL solution, either physically to form a suspension or colloid, or by dissolving the con5)onents in the IL solvent, and then regenerating the composite material.<br>
The distribution of the active substance is preferably substantially homogeneous within the matrix of regenerated cellulose.  The regenerated solid cellulose (i) has about the same molecular weight as the original cellulose from which it is prepared and typically contains a degree of polymerization number (DP) of about 1200 , or more. That regenerated cellulose (ii) is substantially free of an increased amount of substituent groups relative to the starting cellulose and entrapped ionic liquid degradation products.<br>
A minor amount of cellulose hydrolysis can take place dxiring a contemplated dissolution cuid regeneration. However, the weight average molecular weight of the cellulose after regeneration is about 90 percent that of the cellulose prior to dissolution and regeneration. This result is contrary to that of U.S. Patent No. 5,792,399 where the starting cellulose is treated with a cellulase in the presence of NMMNO in order to effect dissolution.<br>
The substituent groups of which the regenerated cellulose is substantially free are those that were not present in the cellulose that was dissolved in the IL.  Thus, for example, the hydroxyl groups of a natural cellulose can be oxidized to form oxo (substituents with C=0 bonds) functionality such<br><br>
as ketones, aldehydes, or carboxylic acids, and natural cellulose can contain amounts of such functionalities.  The dissolution/regeneration process used herein does not cause the formation of more than a few percent more of those groups than were originally present.  Where oxidized cellulose that contains a high level of oxo functionality is used as the starting material such as where Regenerated Oxidized Cellulose U.S.P. (ROC), the regenerated cellulose again contains about the same amount of functionality (e.g., about 18 to about 24 percent carboxyl groups for ROC) after dissolution and regeneration as was present prior to those steps being carried out.<br>
Another group of substituents of which the regenerated cellulose is substantially free are those substituents such as xanthate groups, C2-C3 2-hydroxyalkyl (e.g., 2-hydroxyethyl and 2-hydroxypropyl) groups, and carboxyl groups such as acetyl and butyryl that are used in other processes to dissolve cellulose.<br>
The hydrophilic ionic liquid solution used herein is substemtially free of water, a water- or alcohol-miscible orgeuiic solvent or nitrogen-containing base and contains solubilized cellulose. Conteitqplated organic solvents of which the solution is free include solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl formaraide, acetamide, hexamethyl phosphoramide, water-soluble alcohols, ketones or aldehydes such as ethanol, methanol, 1- or 2-propanol, tert-butanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, the C1-C4 alkyl and alkoxy ethylene glycols and propylene glycols such as 2-<br><br>
methoxyethanol, 2-ethoxyethanol, 2-butoxyethanol, diethyleneglycol, and the like.<br>
The cations of a hydrophilic ionic liquid are preferably cyclic and correspond in structure to a formula selected from the group consisting of<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br><br><br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are independently a C1-C6 alkyl group or a C1-C6 alkoxyalkyl group, and R3, R4 R5, R6, R7, R8 and R9 (R3-R9) , when present, are independently a hydrido, a C1-C6 alkyl, a C1-C6 alkoxyalkyl group, or a C1-C6 alkoxy group. More preferably, both R1 and R2 groups are C1-C4 alkyl,<br>
with one being methyl, and R3-R9, when present, are preferably hydrido.  ExenPlary C1-C6 alkyl groups and C1-C4 alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl, butyl, sec-butyl, iso-butyl, pentyl, iso-pentyl, hexyl, 2-ethylbutyl, 2-methylpentyl, and the like. Corresponding C1-C6 alkoxy groups contain the above C1-C6 alkyl group bonded to an oxygen atom that is also bonded to the cation ring. An alkoxyalkyl group contains an ether group bonded to an alkyl group, and here contains a total of up to six carbon atoms.<br>
It is to be noted that there are two iosmeric 1,2,3-triazoles.  It is preferred that all R groups not required for cation formation be hydrido.<br>
The phrase "when present" is often used herein in regard to substituent R group because not all cations have all of the numbered groups.  All of the contemplated cations contain at least four R<br><br>
groups, which may be hydrido, although R2 need not be present in all cations.<br>
The phrases "substantial absence" and "substantially free" are used synonymously to mean that less than about 5 weight percent water is present, for example. More prefersOaly, less than about one percent water is present in the composition. The same meaning is intended regarding the presence of a nitrogen-containing base.<br>
An anion for a contemplated ionic liquid cation is a halogen ion (fluoride, chloride, bromide, or. iodide), perchlorate, a pseudohalogen ion such as thiocyanate and cyanate or C1-C6 carboxylate. Pseudohalides are monovalent and have properties similar to those of halides [Schriver et al., Inorganic Chemistry, W.H. Freeman &amp; Co., New York (1990) 406-407]. Pseudohalides include the cyanide (CN'^), thiocyanate (SCN'^) , cyanate (OCN"^) , fulminate (CNO"^), and azide (Ns"^) anions.  Carboxylate anions that contain 1-6 carbon atoms (C^-C6 carboxylate) and are illustrated by formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, hexanoate, maleate, fumarate, oxalate, lactate, pyruvate, and the like.<br>
A contemplated ionic lic[uid used herein is hydrophilic and therefore differs from the hydrophobic ionic liquids described in Koch et al. U.S. Patent No. 5,827,602 or those of Bonhdte et al. U.S. Patent No. 5,683,832 that contain one or more fluorine atoms covalently bonded to a carbon atom as in a trifluororaethanesulfonate or trifluoroacetate anion.<br>
The contemplated solvent can also comprise mixtures of two, or more, of the contemplated ionic liquids.<br><br><br>
It is preferred that all R groups that are not required for cation formation; i.e., those other than R1 and R2 for compounds other than the imidazoliura, pyrazolium and triazolium cations shown above, be hydrido. Thus, the cations shown above preferably have a structxire that corresponds to a<br>
strxicture shown below, wherein R1 and R2 are as described before.<br><br><br><br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br><br><br><br>
A cation that contains a single five-membered ring that is free of fusion to other ring st3ruGtures is more preferred.  A cellulose dissolution method is also contemplated using an ionic liquid comprised of those cations.  That method comprises admixing cellulose with a hydrophilic ionic liquid comprised of those five-membered ring cations and anions in the substantial absence of water to form an admixture.  The admixture is agitated until dissolution is attained.  Exemplary cations are illustrated below wherein R1, R2, and R3-R5, when present, are as defined before.<br><br><br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Of the more preferred cations that contain a single five-membered ring free of fusion to other ring structures, an imidazolium cation that<br><br>
corresponds in stmicture to Formula A is particularly preferred, wherein R^, R2, and R3_R5^ ^re  as.defined before.<br><br><br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br>
An N,N-l,3-di-(C1-C6 alkyl)-substituted-imidazolium ion is a more particularly preferred cation; i.e., an imidazolium cation wherein R3-R5 of<br>
Formula A are each hydrido, and R1 and R2 are independently each a C1-C6-alkyl group or a C1-C6 alkoxyalkyl group. A 1-(C1-C6-alkyl)-3-(methyl)-imidazolium [Cn-tnim, where n = 1-6] cation is most preferred, and a halogen is a preferred anion.  A most preferred cation is illustrated by a compound that corresponds in structure to Formula B, below,<br>
wherein R3-R5 of Formula A are each hydrido and R1 is a C1-C6-alkyl group or a C1-C6 alkoxyallcyl group.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
A contenplated ionic liquid is liquid at or below a temperature of about 150°C, and preferably below a temperature of about 100°C and above a temperature of about -100°C.  For example, N-alkylisoquinolinium and N-alkylquinolinium halide salts have melting points of less than about 150°C. The melting point of N-methylisoquinoliniura chloride<br><br><br><br><br>
is 183°C, and N-ethylc[uinolinium iodide has a melting point of 158°C.  More preferably, a contemplated ionic liquid is liquid (molten) at or below a temperature of about 120°C and above a temperature of minus 44 °C (-44°C) . Most preferably, a contenplated ionic liquid is liquid (molten) at a temperature of about -10° to about 100°C.<br>
Cellulose can be dissolved without derivitization in high concentration in ionic liquids by heating to about 100°C, by heating to about 80°C in an ultrasonic bath, and most effectively by using microwave heating of the samples using a domestic microwave oven.  Using a microwave heater, it is preferred to heat the admixture of hydrophilic ionic liquid and cellulose to a temperature of about 100° to about 150 °C.<br>
A contenplated ionic liquid has an extremely low vapor pressure and typically deconposes prior to boiling.  Exenplary liquification temperatures [i.e., melting points (MP) and glass transition tetiperatures (Tg) ] and decomposition temperatures for illustrative N,N-l,3-di-C1-C6-alkyl imidazolium ion-containing ionic liquids wherein one of R1 and R2 is methyl are shown in the table below.<br><br>

Illustrative l-alkyl-3-methyl-imidazolium ionic liquids, [Cn-inim]X [n = 4 and 6, X = CI", Br",<br>
SCN', (PFg)", (BF4)"] have been prepared.  The dissolution of cellulose (fibrous cellulose, from Aldrich Chemical Co.) in those illustrative ionic liquids under ambient conditions and with heating to 100°C, with sonication and with microwave heating has been examined.  Dissolution is enhanced by the use of microwave heating.  Cellulose solutions can be prepared very quickly, which is energy efficient and provides associated economic benefits.<br><br>
A solution comprised of cellulose in a molten hydrophilic ionic liquid solvent that is substantially free of water or a nitrogen-containing base is contemplated for preparing a cellulose matrix encapsulated material. As such, such a liquid or solution contains about one percent or less water or a nitrogen-containing base. Thus, when a solution is prepared, it is prepared by admixing the ionic liquid and cellulose in the absence of water or a nitrogen-containing base to form an admixture.<br>
As above, the ionic liquid is comprised of cations and emions that are preferably those discussed above. A more preferred solution is comprised of cellulose dissolved in a hydrophilic liquid whose cations contain a single five-menibered ring free of fusion to other ring structures, as discussed previously.  A contemplated solution can be used as is to carry out further reactions on the cellulose such as acylation to form cellulose acetate or butyrate, or for regeneration.<br>
Cellulose displays high solubility in the ionic liquids. Viscous, birefringent liquid cirystalline solutions are obtained at high concentration, e.g., about 10 to about 25 weight percent.<br>
A contemplated solution of cellulose in an ionic liqpaid can contain cellulose in an amount of about 5 to about 35 weight percent of the solution. More preferably, the cellulose is present at about 5 to about 25 weight percent of the solution.  More preferably still, the cellulose is present at about 10 to about 25 weight percent of the solution.<br>
The weight ratio of cellulose to active substance in the molten composition can be quite<br><br>
varied. For example, a rsuige of about 1000:1 to about 1:2 by weight of cellulose to active substance is contemplated.  More usual weight ratios contemplated are about 100:1 to about 1:1.  Those weight ratios are reflected also in the regenerated cellulose product.<br>
Ionic liquids containing chloride anions appear to be most effective.  The chloride anion is not required; reasonedale soliibility was also observed when the ionic liquid contained thiocyanate, perchlorate, and bromide anions.  No solubility was observed for ionic liquids containing tetrafluoroborate or hexafluorophosphate anions.<br>
In usual practice, cellulose is dissolved in an IL, to form a homogeneous, or liquid crystalline euiisotropic solution.  The material for incorporation is then introduced into the IL solution, either dissolved, or dispersed in the medium^ (for exanple namoparticles or macroscopic beads).  The cellulose matrix is then formed by regeneration upon contacting the IL solution with a non-solvent diluent, resulting in formation of a regenerated cellulose material (as a floe, film, membreuie, fiber, or monolith depending on processing) in which the additives are entrained.<br>
The order of addition of the components to the IL solvent is not important for the regeneration and encapsulation process, and depends on external consideration such as the stability of the individual components under processing conditions.  Cellulose can be initially dissolved to form a solution in the IL, followed by dispersion of the active conponents, and regeneration.  Or, the active component can be dispersed in the IL, followed by dissolution of<br><br>
cellulose and subsequent regeneration of the composite.<br>
The regenerating fluid or non-solvent diluent is a non-solvent for the active substance and the cellulose.  That is, the regenerating fluid does not dissolve large qpantities of either the cellulose or the active agent, so that both ingredients axe stibstantially insoluble in the regenerating fluid. Thus, the active substance and the cellulose are independently soluble to an extent of less than about 5 percent by weight, and preferably less than about 1 percent in the regenerating fluid.  The ionic liquid is miscible with the regeneration fluid, and contacting of the IL phase with the regeneration fluid induces regeneration of the solid cellulose polymer that is the matrix in which the active substance is encapsulated.<br>
Where extrusion of an ionic liquid solution of cellulose and an additive through a die is contemplated, that extrusion can be accomplished in a number of msumers that are well known.  For example, in some embodiments, a surface of the die containing one or more orifices through which the solution is extruded is below the svurface of the regenerating fluid.  In other etnbodiments, the solution passes from a die orifice through air or another gas such as nitrogen or argon prior to being contacted with the regenerating fluid.<br>
The liquid non-solvent is preferably miscible with water.  Exemplary liquid non-solvents include water, an alcohol such as methanol, or ethanol, acetonitrile, an ether such as furan or dioxane, and a ketone such as acetone.  The advantage of water is that the process avoids the use of a<br><br>
volatile organic coinpound (VOC) .  Regeneration does not require the use of volatile organic solvents. The ionic liquid can be dried or otherwise freed of the liquid non-solvent and reused after regeneration.<br>
This iiiethod has advantages for formation of composites containing many solid substances that it can be desirable to encapsulate in a celltilose matrix, but that are not soluble in an ionic liquid, for example nanoparticles or macroscopic materials.<br>
The concept described herein permits addition of IL-soluble chemicals to be added, followed by regeneration using a non-solvent diluent in which both cellulose and additive are non- or sparingly soluble.  Incorporation of nanoparticles, and macroscopic particles in the cellulose matrix that are initially dispersed within the viscous IL medium, results in a substantially homogeneous dispersion within the regenerated cellulose matrix, forming a nano-dispersed composite.<br>
Engineered cellulose forms containing impregnated additives with enhanced properties and applications can be prepared from ionic liquid solution. Useful applications include, but are not limited to membranes/filters, fuel cells, separations devices, electrolysis membranes, flame retardants, biocidal filters, sensors, metal extractaints, supports for enzymes, extractamt materials for filtration, separations and extractions: metal ions, biomolecules, gas molecules, magnetic particles for membrane/extractant processing, materials modifiers for cellulose coatings, bioactive agents (controlled release, sensing, destruction), metal complexants (sensing, controlled release, extractants and binding and separations agents for filters), water insoluble<br><br>
dyes for coloring cellulose, sensing and indicators, photoresists, incorporation of nanoparticles as photonic agents or UV screens, magnetic particles for magneto-responsive beads, filtration and reactive beds, neinoparticle catalysis, dispersions of clays and other fire-retardeuat materials, enzyme supports, supported polymer electrolytes, cavity-forming pillars/scaffolding for the manufacture of nemoporous materials.<br>
Example A:  Preparation of 1-Butyl-3-<br>
methylimidazolium Chloride [C4mim]Cl<br>
l-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride [C4mim]C1 was prepared using literature procedures [Huddleston et al.. Green Chem.,   2001, 3:156] from 1-chlorobutane amd l-methylimidazole (both from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwatikee, WI) , and was isolated as a colorless, emhydrous crystalline solid at room temperature.<br>
All the initial IL solutions of cellulose were prepared following the methods disclosed in U.S. application Serial No. 10/256,521 or application Serial No. 60/326,704, both of which were referred to previously.  Solutions prepared by microwave pulsing are typically about 110° to aibout 130° C. Active substances were tj^ically added to the solution of cellulose in IL at a solution temperature of about 80 to about 90° C.<br>
Example 1i Incorporation of a Hydrophobic Metal Extractant Into a Cellulose Matrix The actinide complexant (complexing agent), carbamoyl methyl phosphine oxide, or CMPO (Strem Chemicals, Newburyport, MA) was incorporated into a<br><br>
reconstituted cellulose matrix to provide a solid supported metal extractant.<br>
CMPO was encapsulated in a cellulose matrix (referred to as OlPO-cellulose) .  CMPO (20 weight percent with respect to cellulose) was added to a 10 weight percent solution of cellulose (miorocrystalline, Aldrich) in [C4mim]Cl ionic liquid solution at about 90 C, prepared via microwave heating. After vigorous stirring to ensure a homogenous distribution of CMPO throughout the cellulose-in-ionic liquid solution, CMPO-cellulose was reconstituted by transferring (via pouring) into a 1 L beaker containing 800 mL of deionized water. The contents of the beaker where rapidly stirred, and the water was refreshed 3 times to ensure con^jete removal of the ionic liquid.  The resultant material resembles a floe, and was isolated via suction filtration.<br>
Standards of microcrystalline cellulose prepared and reconstituted from the ionic liquid solution using the same procedure in the absence of CMPO, cuid vintreated microcrystalline cellulose used as received, were used as blanks for uptake measurements.<br>
The presence of extractant in the reconstituted cellulosic matrix was confirmed by the observation of enhemced distribution of actinide ('*^AmCl3 in 1 M HCl, ^"PuCl« in 1 M HNO3, "'UOjCla in dilute HNO3) radiotracers to the CMPO-cellulose material from acfueous acid solution with respect to distributions for both untreated and reconstituted cellulose blanks.  Measurements were made in 0.001 M, 0.01 M, 0.1 M, 1.0 M, and 10.0 M nitric acid solutions.  All aqueous solutions were prepared in<br><br>
deionized water that was purified with a Bamstead deionization system (Dubuque, lA) and polished to 18.3 MQ cm-1.<br>
The dry weight conversion factors for the cellulose, reconstituted cellulose, and CMPO-cellulose materials were determined as follows. A known mass of material was stirred in an  excess of water for 24 hours at room temperature.  This was followed by 10 min of conditioning (air drying) on a Buchner flannel.  Once conditioned, samples were transferred to a preweighed crucible and dried in an oven at 110 C until a constant mass was achieved. Each gravimetric analysis was preformed in triplicate.  All materials were stored in tightly capped vials and were not exposed to air for any extensive period of time in order to maintain water content.<br>
All weight distribution ratios were determined radiometrically via batch contacts of the cellulose, regenerated cellulose, and CMPO-celltilose materials with the desired solutions. The dry weight distribution ratio is defined as:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br>
where Ao is the activity of the solution prior to contact, Af is the activity of the solution after contact, V is the volume (mL) of solution the material is contacted with, mR is the mass (g) of the cellulose or CMPO-celluloae material, and dwcf is the dry weight conversion factor that relates the mass of the hydrated material to its dry mass.<br>
The Dv, studies were carried out as follows. The radiotracer was added to 1.3 mL of the solution<br><br>
of interest.  This was vortexed for one min, and two 100 uL aliquots removed for radiometric counting (Ao) . One tnL of the remaining solution (V) was then added to a known mass of dry cellulose, hydrated regenerated cellulose, or hydrated CMPO-cellulose material (mn) and centrifuged for one minute.  The solution was then allowed to stir (ensuring, that the cellulose materials are not just suspended in solution) for approximately 60 minutes.  The contact time is believed to be sufficient for the Systems to reach equilibrium. After completion of stirring, the samples were centrifuged for 2 minutes in order to completely separate the cellulose materials from the aqueous phase.  A 100 pL aliquot (Af) was then removed for counting.  Coxinting for ^^'Pu and "^U02 were carried out using standard liquid scintillation analysis.  Counting for ^*^Am was carried using standard y (gamma) radiometric analysis. Duplicate radiometrically determined distributions ratios were consistent to ± 5%.<br>
The results of these extraction studies are shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 3. CMPO-cellulose successfully extracted the actinide from the nitric acid solution over a wide range of pH values, and the extractions were superior to those obtained using cellulose alone.<br>
Exan^le 2: Incorporation of Protoporphyrin IX as a Further Hydrophobic Metal Extract ant Protoporphyrin IX (10 mg, CAS 553-12-8; Aldrich Chemical Co.), was added as a powder to a solution of cellulose (Whatman filter paper, 1 g) in molten [C^mim] Cl (10 g) , [prepared by microwave heating of cellulose in the IL with short pulses<br><br>
until a viscous, homogeneous solution was formed] and stirred until dissolved, resulting in a dark red-orange viscous solution containing cellulose (10 weight percent) and dye (0.1 weight percent).  The cellulose was regenerated as a film by coating a glass sheet with a thin layer of the ionic liquid solution, followed by inaoerBion into a bath containing deionized water. After immersion for 30 . minutes, the orcuige cellulose film was removed from the regeneration bath and dried in air for 15 minutes to give a soft, pliable film.  The wash water was uncolored indicating that none of the protoporphyrin IX had leached from the film.<br>
The UV/vis spectrum of the film (transmission) showed the presence of the characteristic broad cQjsoirption band with a maximum at 400 nm from the Protoporphyrin IX metal extractant, enclosed within the film.<br>
Example 3: Formation of-Colored Cellulose Products by Trapping of Dye Molecules The non-reactive dye, Victoria blue B (50 mg, CAS 2185-86-6; J. T. Baker Chemical Company, NJ) , was added as a powder at about 80° C to a prefoinned solution of cellulose (Whatmeui filter paper, 1.5 g) in molten [C4mim]Cl (30 g) [prepared by heating a slurry of the filter paper and [C^mim] Cl at 120** C for 5 hours with occasional stirringl.  The resulting composition was stirred until the dye dissolved, resulting in an intense blue viscous solution containing cellulose (5 weight percent) and dye (0.15 weight percent).  The cellulose was regenerated as a film by coating a glass sheet with a thin layer of the ionic liquid solution, followed by immersion into<br><br>
a bath containing deionized water. After immersion for 1 hour, the blue cellulose film was removed from the regeneration bath and dried in air for 15 minutes to give a soft, pliable film.  The water was pale blue indicating that a small concentration of dye had leached from the film.<br>
The UV/vis spectrum of the film (transmission) showed the presence of the characteristic broad absorption bsmd with a maximum at 597 nm from the Victoria Blue B dye, enclosed within the film.<br>
Example 4: Formation of a pH-Sensitive Cellulosg Film<br>
Cellulose azure (10 mg, CAS 76296-24-7; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), a pH-sensitive dye molecule (Remazol Brilliant Violet 5R) covalently attached to a cellulose backbone, was added as a powder to a solution of cellulose (microcrystalline cellulose [5004-34-6], 1 g; Sigma) in molten [C4mim]Cl (10 g) .  The initial cellulose in IL solution was formed by pulsed microwave heating of cellulose powder in [CimimlCl, followed by cooling to about 90° C, at about which tenperature the addition took place.  The resulting con^osition was stirred until the blue powder dissolved, resulting in cin intense blue viscous solution containing cellulose (10 weight percent) and cellulose azure (0.1 weight percent) .<br>
The cellulose was regenerated as a film by coating a glass sheet with a thin layer of the ionic liquid solution, followed by immersion into a bath containing deionized water.  After immersion for 20 minutes, the blue cellulose film was removed from the regeneration bath and dried in air for 15 minutes to give a soft, pliable film.  The wash water was<br><br>
uncolored indicating that none of the cellulose azure had leached from the film.<br>
The sensitivity of the thus prepared cellulose-cellulose azure film to pH was tested by-first immersing the membrane in a pH 7 buffer solution yielding a blue film. The film was then transfeinred to a solution of pH 2 buffer causing a color change in the film from blue to pink  This process was repeated with equivalent results several times and over the course of many months indicating that stability of the cellulose-cellulose azure pH sensitive film is long lasting.<br>
The UV/vis spectrum of the film (transmission) in Fig. 4 shows the pH sensitive cellulose-cellulose azure film with a blue absorption band with a maximum at 570 nm at pH 6.88 emd a pink abso3rption beuid with a maximum at 550 nm at pH 2.10.<br>
Exanpie 5: Encapsulation of Bovine Serum Albumin in a Cellulose Film<br>
Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added to a solution of cellulose (fibrous, Aldrich; 5 weight percent) dissolved in [C4raim]Cl that was prepared by pulse microwave heating of the cellulose fibers in the IL until a viscous, homogeneous solution was obtained.  The mixture was vortexed to disperse the BSA.  A thin film was prepared by coating a microscope slide with the IL solution.  Immersing the slide in a bath of deionized water regenerated the cellulose.<br>
UV/Visible spectra of a regenerated cellulose matrix from an ionic liquid solution, and a regenerated cellulose matrix from an ionic liquid solution containing the protein, bovine serum albumin<br><br>
(BSA) were taken.  The presence of an UV absorption peak centered at 280 nm in Fig. 5 is indicative of BSA entrapped within the cellulose film. This peak is characteristic to the solution phase UV spectra for BSA (Xroax = 284 nm) .<br>
Example 6; Encapsulation of Laccase and a<br>
Hydrophobic Ionic Liquid in Cellulose<br>
Cellulose pulping sample (0.10 g), obtained from International Paper (degree of polymerization -1,000), was introduced to 5.0 g [bmim] CI and microwave-heated in 3-5 second pulses.  Complete dissolution of the saniple was achieved resulting in a viscous solution. Cellulosic matrix was cooled to room ten5)erature to avoid heat-induced denaturation of the enzyme.<br>
In a sepeirate vial, 5.0 mg laccase was introduced into 5.0 g [bmim] [TfaN] to seirve as a 'protective' coating for the enzyme. The coated laccase was then added to the cooled IL/cellulose solution and immediately cast into a film.  The film was washed with purified water three times to regenerate the cellulose and rid the film of excess ionic liquid.  A portion of the film was added to 5.6 TriL of a 50 mM phosphate buffer solution spiked with 200uL syringealdizine solution [8.2 mg syringealdizine dissolved in 20tnL MeOH] .  A UV/vis spectrum of the film inSicated incorporation of the enzyme into the regenerated cellulose matrix by the maximum absorption at about 280 nm, as is shown in Fig. 6. The colorless film was left in solution overnight (about eighteen hours) and activity of the entrapped enzyme was confirmed by the pink color of the film<br><br>
that is indicative of the laccase-catalyzed oxidization of syringealdizine.<br>
Example 7: Encapsulation of Ubiquinone in a Cellulose Film Matrix<br>
Ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q; Sigma Chemical Co.) is a membrane-bound electron carrier enployed in the election transport chain for production of cellular energy and the possibility of its encapsulation can lead to biologically conducting cellulose films regenerated from ionic liquids.  Microcrystalline cellulose purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in [C4mim] CI using 3-5 second microwave pulses to create a viscous mixture.  The mixture was cooled to room temperature from about 120-130° C, lobiqpainone was added with stirring, and the resulting composition was cast into a film.  The film was subsequently washed three times with water to rid the film of excess IL.<br>
The resulting film was permitted to dry for two days and then subjected to UV/vis Sceui (500 - 250 nm) on a Varian Gary-3 spectrophotometer. A peak corresponding to the encapsulated Coenzyme Q was clearly visible at edaout 280 nm, which corresponds to aromatic moieties that exist in the biomolecule but not in native, IL-regenerated cellulose films.  This spectrum is shown in Pig. 7.<br>
Example 8: Formation of Magnetic Cellulose Particles<br>
Cellulose (1 g, Whatman filter paper substantially homogeneously) was dissolved in [C4mim]Cl (20 g) by heating at 120 C for 6 hours to form a 5 weight percent solution.  Magnetite particles (1 g, about 5 micron powder; Aldrich<br><br>
Chemical Co.) were added to the molten solution and homogeneously distributed by vortexing the solution.<br>
A lozenge of cellulose/magnetite composite was then prepared by coating a plastic sheet (about 6 X 1.5 inch) with a film of the ionic liquid mixture. The sheet was placed in a bath containing deionized water and left to stand for 24 hours permitting all IL to be dissolved and diffuse from the matrix. The lozenge was then washed and maintained in distilled water.  The resulting soft, flexible cellulose/magnetite film was air dried to yield a hard, brittle black solid.<br>
Visual inspection using an optical microscope showed that the magnetite particles appeared to be disperse. The cellulose film was magnetic, and  was attracted to"a permanent magnet. Theirmal gravimetric analysis of the air-dried film showed about 50 percent mass loss between 100-400 °C, confirming that all the magnetite was entrapped    within the regenerated conposite retaining the initial composition ratio of 1:1 cellulose:magentite.<br>

From the foregoing it will be observed that numerous modifications and variations can be effectuated without departing from the true spirit and scope of the novel concepts of the invention.  It is to be understood that no limitation with respect to the specific embodiment illustrated is intended or should be inferred.  The disclosure is intended to<br><br>
cover by the appended claims all such modifications as fall within the scope of the claims.<br>
arylpyridinium chloride salt, U.S. Patent No. 1,943,176, especially in the presence of a nitrogen-containing base such as pyridine.  However, that finding seems to have been treated as a novelty of little practical value because the molten salt system was, at the time, somewhat esoteric. This original work was undertaken at a time when ionic liquids were essentially unknown and the application and value of ionic liquids as a class of solvents had not been realized.<br>
Ionic liquids are now a well-established class of liquids containing solely ionized species, and having melting points largely below 150 °C or most preferably 100 °C.  In most cases, ionic liquids (IL) are organic salts containing one or more cations that are typically ammonium, imidazolium or. pyridinium ions, although many other types are known. The range of ionic liquids that are applicable to the dissolution of cellulose are disclosed in US patent application Serial No. 10/256,521, filed on September 27, 2002, entitled "Dissolution and Processing of Cellulose Using Ionic Liquids", that claimed priority from provisional application Serial no. 60/326,704 that was filed on October 3, 2001, and in Swatloski et al.f J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002, 124:4974-4975.<br>
Traditional cellulose dissolution processes, including the cuprammonium and xanthate processes, are often cumbersome or expensive and require the use of unusual solvents, typically with a high ionic strength and are used under relatively harsh conditions.  [Kirk-Othmer "Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology", Fourth Edition 1993, volume 5, p. 476-563.]  Such solvents include carbon disulfide, N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMNO), mixtures of N,N-<br>
dimethylacetamide and lithium chloride (DMAC/LiCl), dimethylimidazolone/LiCl, concentrated aqueous inorganic salt solutions [ZnCl/H20, Ca(SCN)2/H2O] , concentrated mineral acids (H2S04/H3P04) or molten salt hydrates (LiClO4.3H2O, NaSCN/KSCN/LiSCN/H2O) .<br>
These traditional cellulose dissolution processes break the cellulose polymer backbone resulting in regenerated products that contain an average of about 500 to about 600 glucose units per molecule rather than the native larger number of about 1500 or more glucose units per molecule.  In addition, processes such as that used in rayon formation proceed via xanthate intermediates and tend to leave some residual derivatized (substituent groups bonded to) glucose residues as in xanthate group-containing cellulose.<br>
For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,792,399 teaches the use of N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMNO) solutions of cellulose to prepare regenerated cellulose that contained polyethyleneimine (PEI). That patent teaches that one should utilize a pre-treatment with the enzyme cellulase to lessen the molecular weight to the cellulose prior to dissolution.  In addition, it is taught that NMMNO decomposes at the temperatures used for dissolution to provide N-methylmorpholine as a degradation product that could be steam distilled away from the cellulose solution.  The presence of PEI is said to lessen the decomposition of the NMMNO.<br>
Other traditional processes that can provide a solubilized cellulose do so by forming a substituent that is intended to remain bonded to the cellulose such as where cellulose esters like the acetate and butyrate esters are prepared, or where a<br>
carboxymethyl, methyl, ethyl, C2-C3 2-hydroxyalkyl (hydroxyethyl or hydroxypropyl) , or the like group is added to the cellulose polymer.  Such derivative (substituent) formation also usually leads to a lessening of the degree of cellulose polymerization so that the resulting product contains fewer cellobiose units per molecule than the cellulose from which it was prepared.<br>
Thus, Linko and co-worker reported<br>
dissolving relatively low molecular weight cellulose (DP=880) in a mixture of N-ethylpyridinium chloride (NEPC) and dimethylformamide, followed by cooling to 30°C, incorporation of various microbial cells into the solution and then regeneration of the cellulose into a solid form by admixture with water.  [Linko et al.,* Enzyme Microb. Technol., 1:26-30 (1979).]  That research group also reported entrapment of yeast cells in a solution of 1 percent cellulose dissolved in a mixture of NEPC and dimethyl sulfoxide, as well as entrapment using 7.5 to 15 percent cellulose di-or triacetates dissolved in several organic solvents. [Weckstrom et al., in Food Engineering in Food Processing, Vol. 2, Applied Science Publishers Ltd., pages 148-151 (1979).]<br>
Entrapped materials have a wide number of uses, from controlled release systems to structural modifiers and sensor or reactive materials.  The entrapped materials can be formulated as membranes, coatings or capsules.  Methods are known for forming encapsulated products including emulsion polymerization, interfacial polymerization, desolution, emulsification, gelation, spray-drying, vacuum coating, and adsorption onto porous particles. Common materials used include polymers,<br>
hydrocolloids, sugars, waxes, fats, metals and metal oxides.<br>
The use of membranes, coatings, and capsules for the controlled release of liquid materials is well known in the art of both agricultural and non-agricultural chemicals, including the preparation of graphic arts materials, Pharmaceuticals, food, and pesticide formulations. In agriculture, controlled-release techniques have improved the efficiency of herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, and fertilizers.  Non-agricultural uses include encapsulated dyes, inks, Pharmaceuticals, flavoring agents, and fragrances.<br>
The most common forms of controlled-release materials are coated droplets or microcapsules, coated solids, including both porous and non-porous particles, and coated aggregates of solid particles. In some instances, a water-soluble encapsulating film is desired, which releases the encapsulated material when the capsule is placed in contact with water. Other coatings are designed to release the entrapped material when the capsule is ruptured or degraded by external force.  Still further coatings are porous in nature and release the entrapped material to the surrounding medium at a slow rate by diffusion through the pores.<br>
Materials have been formulated as<br>
emulsifiable concentrates by dissolving the materials in an organic solvent mixed with a surface-active agent or as an oily agent.  In solid form, the insecticides have been formulated as a wettable powder in which the insecticide is adsorbed onto finely powdered mineral matter or diatomaceous earth, as a dust or as granules.<br>
However, these conventional formulations pose a variety of problems such as the pollution of the environment caused by the organic solvent used in the emulsions or by the dust resulting from the wettable powders.  Furthermore, for these formulations to have long-term residual effectiveness, an amount much higher than that used in normal application is required, and this increased amount can affect the environment or cause problems of safety.  Other conventional microcapsules that encapsulate active insecticidal components are obtained through an interfacial polymerization reaction and are not ideal in terms of the production process or as an effective stabilized insecticide.<br>
There is therefore a strong demand for a formulation that maintains a high degree of efficacy over long periods. Given this background, research and development are now actively under way to develop a superior microencapsulated formulation that can effectively replace the emulsifiable concentrate, interfacially-polymerized or wettable powders, and is safer to use.<br>
Enzyme entrapment on solid supports is a well-established technique for improving stability and separations aspects in enzymatic transformations. Entrapment of enzymes on solid supports can result in improved stability to pH and temperature and aid in separation of the enzyme from the reaction mixture, and also for formation of enzyme electrodes for sensor applications.<br>
There are four principal methods available for immobilizing enzymes: adsorption, covalent binding, entrapment, and membrane confinement.  A common method for immobilization is to use<br>
polysaccharide activation in which cellulose beads are reacted under alkali conditions with cyanogen bromide.  The intermediate produced is then covalently coupled with soluble enzymes.  Examples are lactase, penicillin acylase, and aminoacylase enzymes.<br>
Entrapment of enzymes within gels or fibers is a convenient method for use in processes involving low molecular weight substrates and products. Entrapment is the method of choice for immobilization of microbial, animal and plant cells.  Calcium alginate is widely used.  Enzymes can be entrapped in cellulose acetate fibers by formulation of an emulsion of the enzyme plus cellulose acetate in dichloromethane, followed by extrusion of fibers.<br>
Entrapped enzyme methods have wide applicability, but the entrapped enzymes can be technically difficult to prepare and involve moderate to high costs. Hence, new methods of preparing entrapped enzymes are desirable.<br>
The disclosure hereinafter describes the preparation of encapsulated materials in a cellulose matrix by dispersion and regeneration of IL/cellulose solutions containing an active substance into a regenerating liquid in which the IL is soluble and that is a non-solvent for cellulose and the active agent.  It will be clear to those skilled in the art that this invention is applicable to the formulation of beads and fibers in which active agents are entrapped.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention contemplates a cellulose-encapsulated active substance and an<br>
encapsulation method for active substances to form a regenerated cellulose matrix in which the active substance is distributed throughout the matrix.  The distribution of the active substance is preferably substantially homogeneous within the matrix of regenerated cellulose.  The regenerated cellulose (i) has about the same molecular weight as the original cellulose from which it is prepared and typically a degree of polymerization (DP) of about 1200, and (ii) is substantially free of substituent groups and entrapped ionic liquid degradation products.  The material to be encapsulated (active substance) is dispersed, preferably homogeneously, or dissolved in a hydrophilic ionic liquid that is substantially free of water, an organic solvent or nitrogen-containing base containing solubilized cellulose, and the cellulose is subsequently reformed (regenerated) as a solid in which the active substance is dispersed in the cellulose matrix, preferably homogeneously.<br>
This method has advantages for formation of composites containing many solid substances which are desirable to encapsulate in a cellulose matrix, particularly for the incorporation of active agents that are not soluble in water or other common solvents, for example nanoparticles or macroscopic materials.<br>
Matrices formed by this process are capable of effecting a slow rate of release of the encapsulated materials by diffusion through the shell to the surrounding medium, swelling in a liquid medium such as water, by slow, controlled degradation of the cellulose matrix structure, or by slow dissolution of the active substance from within the matrix.<br>
Materials suitable for encapsulation include chemical-biological agents such as herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, animal, insect, and bird repellent, plant growth regulators, fertilizers, and flavor and odor compositions, catalysts, photoactive agents, indicators, dyes, and UV adsorbents.<br>
The final morphological form of the encapsulated composite depends on the regeneration process and on the desired applications of the materials.  For example, high surface area beads, •cylinders or floes can be manufactured for filtration or separation applications, whereas thin films can be prepared for membrane and sensor uses.<br>
Entrapment of biomolecules on solid supports is a well-established technique for improving pH and temperature stability particularly for enzymes and whole cells.  Entrapment of biomolecules within a cellulose support can result in new materials for sensing and detection application.<br>
Macroscopic magnetite particles can be incorporated into cellulose to prepare magnetically modified materials. These materials have a number of applications in magnetic fluidized bed extraction processes for protein and metal extraction or detection.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides an<br>
encapsulation method for a wide range of materials referred to herein as active substances that can be effectively carried out to provide active substance substantially homogeneously distributed through out the regenerated cellulose matrix.  The method uses encapsulation by dispersion or dissolution in a hydrophilic ionic liquid containing solubilized<br>
cellulose, that is substantially free of water, an organic solvent or nitrogen-containing base, followed by subsequent reformation of the cellulose as a solid matrix in which the active substance is dispersed in the matrix.  The resulting material contains the active substance dispersed substantially homogeneously throughout the regenerated cellulose matrix.<br>
A method for the preparation of new materials incorporating molecular, nanoscale and macroscopic materials within a cellulose matrix is contemplated. A contemplated method contemplates encapsulation of the active substance by regenerating a polymer matrix from a hydrophilic ionic liquid (IL) solution containing the active solid substance into a regenerating solution in which both the cellulose and the active substance are insoluble or difficult to dissolve is described; i.e., substantially insoluble.<br>
More specifically, the method contemplates the steps of providing a homogeneous composition that contains cellulose and an active substance dissolved or dispersed in a hydrophilic ionic liquid and in which the ionic liquid solution is substantially free of water, a non-ionic organic solvent or nitrogen-containing base containing solubilized cellulose. That composition is contacted with a liquid non-solvent diluent in which both the cellulose and active substance are substantially insoluble to form a liquid phase and a regenerated solid cellulose phase as a matrix encapsulating the active substance and thereby form composite material that comprises a cellulose-encapsulated active substance.  Residual hydrophilic ionic liquid is preferably thereafter removed.  Examples of active substances include the<br>
incorporation of water-insoluble metal extractants, water-insoluble dyes, biomolecules, and magnetite particles of about 5 microns in diameter (largest dimension if not approximately spherical) that can be dispersed in the IL solution, either physically to form a suspension or colloid, or by dissolving the components in the IL solvent, and then regenerating the composite material.<br>
The distribution of the active substance is preferably substantially homogeneous within the matrix of regenerated cellulose.  The regenerated solid cellulose (i) has about the same molecular weight as the original cellulose from which it is prepared and typically contains a degree of polymerization number (DP) of about 1200 , or more. That regenerated cellulose (ii) is substantially free of an increased amount of substituent groups relative to the starting cellulose and entrapped ionic liquid degradation products.<br>
A minor amount of cellulose hydrolysis can take place during a contemplated dissolution and regeneration. However, the weight average molecular weight of the cellulose after regeneration is about 90 percent that of the cellulose prior to dissolution and regeneration.  This result is contrary to that of U.S. Patent No. 5,792,399 where the starting cellulose is treated with a cellulase in the presence of NMMNO in order to effect dissolution.<br>
The substituent groups of which the<br>
regenerated cellulose is substantially free are those that were not present in the cellulose that was dissolved in the IL.  Thus, for example, the hydroxyl groups of a natural cellulose can be oxidized to form oxo (substituents with C=O bonds) functionality such<br>
as ketones, aldehydes, or carboxylic acids, and natural cellulose can contain amounts of such functionalities. The dissolution/regeneration process used herein does not cause the formation of more than a few percent more of those groups than were originally present.  Where oxidized cellulose that contains a high level of oxo functionality is used as the starting material such as where Regenerated Oxidized Cellulose U.S.P. (ROC), the regenerated cellulose again contains about the same amount of functionality (e.g., about 18 to about 24 percent carboxyl groups for ROC) after dissolution and regeneration as was present prior to those steps being carried out.<br>
Another group of substituents of which the regenerated cellulose is substantially free are those substituents such as xanthate groups, C2-C3 2-hydroxyalkyl (e.g., 2-hydroxyethyl and 2-hydroxypropyl) groups, and carboxyl groups such as acetyl and butyryl that are used in other processes to dissolve cellulose.<br>
The hydrophilic ionic liquid solution used herein is substantially free of water, a water- or alcohol-miscible organic solvent or nitrogen-containing base and contains solubilized cellulose. Contemplated organic solvents of which the solution is free include solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl formamide, acetatnide, hexamethyl phosphoramide, water-soluble alcohols, ketones or aldehydes such as ethanol, methanol, 1- or 2-propanol, tert-butanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, the C1-C4 alkyl and alkoxy ethylene glycols and propylene glycols such as 2-<br>
methoxyethanol, 2-ethoxyethanol, 2-butoxyethanol, diethyleneglycol, and the like.<br>
The cations of a hydrophilic ionic liquid are preferably cyclic and correspond in structure to a formula selected from the group consisting of<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 and R2 are independently a C1-C6 alkyl group or a C1-C6 alkoxyalkyl group, and R3, R4,<br>
R5, R6, R7, R8 and R9 (R3-R9), when present, are independently a hydrido, a C1-C6 alkyl, a C1-C6<br>
alkoxyalkyl group, or a C1-C6 alkoxy group. More preferably, both R1 and R2 groups are C1-C4 alkyl,<br>
with one being methyl, and R3-R9, when present, are preferably hydrido.  Exemplary C1-C6 alkyl groups and C1-C64 alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl, butyl, sec-butyl, iso-butyl, pentyl, iso-pentyl, hexyl, 2-ethylbutyl, 2-methylpentyl, and the like. Corresponding C1-C6 alkoxy groups contain the<br>
above C1-C6 alkyl group bonded to an oxygen atom that<br>
is also bonded to the cation ring. An alkoxyalkyl group contains an ether group bonded to an alkyl group, and here contains a total of up to six carbon atoms.<br>
It is to be noted that there are two iosmeric 1,2,3-triazoles.  It is preferred that all R<br>
groups not required for cation formation be hydrido.<br>
The phrase "when present" is often used herein in regard to substituent R group because not all cations have all of the numbered groups.  All of the contemplated cations contain at least four R<br>
groups, which may be hydrido, although R2 need not be present in all cations.<br>
The phrases "substantial absence" and "substantially free" are used synonymously to mean that less than about 5 weight percent water is present, for example. More preferably, less than about one percent water is present in the composition.  The same meaning is intended regarding the presence of a nitrogen-containing base.<br>
An anion for a contemplated ionic liquid cation is a halogen ion (fluoride, chloride, bromide, or. iodide), perchlorate, a pseudohalogen ion such as thiocyanate and cyanate or C1-C6 carboxylate.<br>
Pseudohalides are monovalent and have properties similar to those of halides [Schriver et al., Inorganic Chemistry, W.H. Freeman &amp; Co., New York (1990) 406-407].  Pseudohalides include the cyanide (CN"1) , thiocyanate (SON1) , cyanate (CON1) , fulminate (CNO"1) , and azide (Ns"1) anions.  Carboxylate anions<br>
that contain 1-6 carbon atoms (C1-C6 carboxylate) and are illustrated by formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, hexanoate, maleate, fumarate, oxalate, lactate, pyruvate, and the like.<br>
A contemplated ionic liquid used herein is hydrophilic and therefore differs from the hydrophobia ionic liquids described in Koch et al. U.S. Patent No. 5,827,602 or those of Bonhote et al. U.S. Patent No. 5,683,832 that contain one or more fluorine atoms covalently bonded to a carbon atom as in a trifluoromethanesulfonate or trifluoroacetate anion.<br>
The contemplated solvent can also comprise mixtures of two, or more, of the contemplated ionic liquids.<br>
It .is preferred that all R groups that are not required for cation formation,- i.e., those other than R1 and R2 for compounds other than the imidazolium, pyrazolium and triazolium cations shown above, be hydrido. Thus, the cations shown above preferably have a structure that corresponds to a<br>
structure shown below, wherein R1 and R2 are as described before.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
A cation that contains a single five-membered ring that is free of fusion to other ring structures is more preferred. A cellulose dissolution method is also contemplated using an ionic liquid comprised of those cations.  That method comprises admixing cellulose with a hydrophilic ionic liquid comprised of those five-membered ring cations and anions in the substantial absence of water to form an admixture.  The admixture is agitated until dissolution is attained.  Exemplary cations are illustrated below wherein R1, R2, and R3-R5, when present, are as defined before.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Of the more preferred cations that contain a single five-membered ring free of fusion to other ring structures, an imidazolium cation that<br>
corresponds in structure to Formula A is particularly preferred, wherein R1, R2, and R3-R5, are as defined before.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
An N,N-l.,3-di-(C1-C6 alkyl)-substituted-imidazolium ion is a more particularly preferred cation; i.e., an imidazolium cation wherein R3-R5 of<br>
Formula A are each hydrido, and R1 and R2 are independently each a C1-C6-alkyl group or a C1-C6<br>
alkoxyalkyl group. A 1-(C1-C6-alkyl)-3-(methyl)-imidazolium [Cn-mim, where n =1-6] cation is most<br>
preferred, and a halogen is a preferred anion.  A most preferred cation is illustrated by a compound that corresponds in structure to Formula B, below,<br>
wherein R3-R5 of Formula A are each hydrido and R1 is a C1-C6-alkyl group or a C1-C6 alkoxyalkyl group. A contemplated ionic liquid is liquid at or below a temperature of about 150°C, and preferably below a temperature of about 100°C and above a temperature of about -100°C.  For example, N-alkylisoquinolinium and N-alkylquinolinium halide salts have melting points of less than about 150°C. The melting point of N-methylisoquinoliniura chloride<br>
is 183 °C, and N-ethylquinol inium iodide has a melting point of 158°C.  More preferably, a contemplated ionic liquid is liquid (molten) at or below a temperature of about 120°C and above a temperature of minus 44 °C (-44°C) .  Most preferably, a contemplated ionic liquid is liquid (molten) at a temperature of about -10° to about 100°C.<br>
Cellulose can be dissolved without<br>
derivitization in high concentration in ionic liquids by heating to about 100°C, by heating to about 80°C in an ultrasonic bath, and most effectively by using microwave heating of the samples using a domestic microwave oven.  Using a microwave heater, it is preferred to heat the admixture of hydrophilic ionic • liquid and cellulose to a temperature of about 100° to about 150 °C.<br>
A contemplated ionic liquid has an<br>
extremely low vapor pressure and typically decomposes prior to boiling.  Exemplary liquification temperatures [i.e., melting points (MP) and glass transition temperatures (Tg)] and decomposition<br>
temperatures for illustrative N,N-l,3-di-C1-C5-alkyl imidazoliutn ion-containing ionic liquids wherein one of R1 and R2 is methyl are shown in the table below.<br><br>

Illustrative l-alkyl-3 -methyl-imidazolium ionic liquids, [Cn-mim]X [n = 4 and 6, X = Cl", Br", SCN", (PF6)~, (BF4)~] have been prepared.  The dissolution of cellulose (fibrous cellulose, from Aldrich Chemical Co.) in those illustrative ionic liquids under ambient conditions and with heating to 100°C, with sonication and with microwave heating has been examined. Dissolution is enhanced by the use of microwave heating.  Cellulose solutions can be prepared very quickly, which is energy efficient and provides associated economic benefits.<br>
A solution comprised of cellulose in a molten hydrophilic ionic liquid solvent that is substantially free of water or a nitrogen-containing base is contemplated for preparing a cellulose matrix encapsulated material. As such, such a liquid or solution contains about one percent or less water or a nitrogen-containing base. Thus, when a solution is prepared, it is prepared by admixing the ionic liquid and cellulose in the absence of water or a nitrogen-containing base to form an admixture.<br>
As above, the ionic liquid is comprised of cations and anions that are preferably those discussed above. A more preferred solution is comprised of cellulose dissolved in a hydrophilic liquid whose cations contain a single five-membered ring free of fusion to other ring structures, as discussed previously. A contemplated solution can be used as is to carry out further reactions on the cellulose such as acylation to form cellulose acetate or butyrate, or for regeneration.<br>
Cellulose displays high solubility in the ionic liquids. Viscous, birefringent liquid crystalline solutions are obtained at high concentration, e.g., about 10 to about 25 weight percent.<br>
A contemplated solution of cellulose in an ionic liquid can contain cellulose in an amount of about 5 to about 35 weight percent of the solution. More preferably, the cellulose is present at about 5 to about 25 weight percent of the solution.  More preferably still, the cellulose is present at about 10 to about 25 weight percent of the solution.<br>
The weight ratio of cellulose to active substance in the molten composition can be quite<br>
varied.  For example, a range of about 1000:1 to about 1:2 by weight of cellulose to active substance is contemplated.  More usual weight ratios contemplated are about 100:1 to about 1:1.  Those weight ratios are reflected also in the regenerated cellulose product.<br>
Ionic liquids containing chloride anions appear to be most effective.  The chloride anion is not required; reasonable solubility was also observed when the ionic liquid contained thiocyanate, perchlorate, and bromide anions.  No solubility was observed for ionic liquids containing tetrafluoroborate or hexafluorophosphate anions.<br>
In usual practice, cellulose is dissolved in an IL, to form a homogeneous, or liquid crystalline anisotropic solution.  The material for incorporation is then introduced into the IL solution, either dissolved, or dispersed in the medium (for example nanoparticles or macroscopic beads) .  The cellulose matrix is then formed by regeneration upon contacting the IL solution with a non-solvent diluent, resulting in formation of a regenerated cellulose material (as a floe, film, membrane, fiber, or monolith depending on processing) in which the additives are entrained.<br>
The order of addition of the components to the IL solvent is not important for the regeneration and encapsulation process, and depends on external consideration such as the stability of the individual components under processing conditions.  Cellulose can be initially dissolved to form a solution in the IL, followed by dispersion of the active components, and regeneration.  Or, the active component can be dispersed in the IL, followed by dissolution of<br>
cellulose and subsequent regeneration of the composite.<br>
The regenerating fluid or non-solvent diluent is a non-solvent for the active substance and the cellulose.  That is, the regenerating fluid does not dissolve large quantities of either the cellulose or the active agent, so that both ingredients are substantially insoluble in the regenerating fluid. Thus, the active substance and the cellulose are independently soluble to an extent of less than about 5 percent by weight, and preferably less than about 1 percent in the regenerating fluid.  The ionic liquid is miscible with the regeneration fluid, and contacting of the IL phase with the regeneration fluid induces regeneration of the solid cellulose polymer that is the matrix in which the active substance is encapsulated.<br>
Where extrusion of an ionic liquid solution of cellulose and an additive through a die is contemplated, that extrusion can be accomplished in a number of manners that are well known.  For example, in some embodiments, a surface of the die containing one or more orifices through which the solution is extruded is below the surface of the regenerating fluid.  In other embodiments, the solution passes from a die orifice through air or another gas such as nitrogen or argon prior to being contacted with the regenerating fluid.<br>
The liquid non-solvent is preferably miacible with water.  Exemplary liquid non-solvents include water, an alcohol such as methanol, or ethanol, acetonitrile, an ether such as furan or dioxane, and a ketone such as acetone.  The advantage of water is that the process avoids the use of a<br>
volatile organic compound (VOC).  Regeneration does not require the use of volatile organic solvents. The ionic liquid can be dried or otherwise freed of the liquid non-solvent and reused after regeneration.<br>
This method has advantages for formation of composites containing many solid substances that it can be desirable to encapsulate in a cellulose matrix, but that are not soluble in an ionic liquid, for example nanoparticles or macroscopic materials.<br>
The concept described herein permits addition of IL-soluble chemicals to be added, followed by regeneration using a non-solvent diluent in which both cellulose and additive are non- or sparingly soluble.  Incorporation of nanoparticles, and macroscopic particles in the cellulose matrix that are initially dispersed within the viscous IL medium, results in a substantially homogeneous dispersion within the regenerated cellulose matrix, forming a nano-dispersed composite.<br>
Engineered cellulose forms containing impregnated additives with enhanced properties and applications can be prepared from ionic liquid solution.  Useful applications include, but are not limited to membranes/filters, fuel cells, separations devices, electrolysis membranes, flame retardants, biocidal filters, sensors, metal extractants, supports for enzymes, extractant materials for filtration, separations and extractions: metal ions, biomolecules, gas molecules, magnetic particles for membrane/extractant processing, materials modifiers for cellulose coatings, bioactive agents (controlled release, sensing, destruction), metal complexants (sensing, controlled release, extractants and binding and separations agents for filters), water insoluble<br>
dyes for coloring cellulose, sensing and indicators, photoresists, incorporation of nanoparticles as photonic agents or UV screens, magnetic particles for magneto-responsive beads, filtration and reactive beds, nanoparticle catalysis, dispersions of clays and other fire-retardant materials, enzyme supports, supported polymer electrolytes, cavity-forming pillars/scaffolding for the manufacture of nanoporous materials.<br>
Example A:  Preparation of l-Butyl-3-<br>
methylimidazolium Chloride [C4im]Cl l-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride [C4mim]Cl was prepared using literature procedures [Huddleston et al., Green Cheat., 2001, 3:156] from 1-chlorobutane and 1-methyliraidazole (both from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, WI), and was isolated as a colorless, anhydrous crystalline solid at room temperature.<br>
All the initial IL solutions of cellulose were prepared following the methods disclosed in U.S. application Serial No. 10/256,521 or application Serial No. 60/326,704, both of which were referred to previously.  Solutions prepared by microwave pulsing are typically about 110° to about 130° C. Active substances were typically added to the solution of cellulose in IL at a solution temperature of about 80 to about 90° C.<br>
Example 1: Incorporation of a Hydrophobia Metal<br>
Extractant Into a Cellulose Matrix The actinide complexant (complexing agent), carbamoyl methyl phosphine oxide, or CMPO (Strem Chemicals, Newburyport, MA) was incorporated into a<br><br>
reconstituted cellulose matrix to provide a solid supported metal extractant.<br>
CMPO was encapsulated in a cellulose matrix<br>
(referred to as CMPO-cellulose).  CMPO (20 weight percent with respect to cellulose) was added to a 10 weight percent solution of cellulose<br>
(microcrystalline, Aldrich) in [C4mim]Cl ionic liquid solution at about 90 C, prepared via microwave heating. After vigorous stirring to ensure a homogenous distribution of CMPO throughout the cellulose-in-ionic liquid solution, CMPO-cellulose was reconstituted by transferring (via pouring) into a 1 L beaker containing 800 mL of deionized water. The contents of the beaker where rapidly stirred, and the water was refreshed 3 times to ensure compete removal of the ionic liquid.  The resultant material resembles a floe, and was isolated via suction filtration.<br>
Standards of microcrystalline cellulose prepared and reconstituted from the ionic liquid solution using the same procedure in the absence of CMPO, and untreated microcrystalline cellulose used as received, were used as blanks for uptake measurements.<br>
The presence of extractant in the<br>
reconstituted cellulosic matrix was confirmed by the observation of enhanced distribution of actinide<br>
(241AmCl3 in 1 M HCl, 239PuCl4 in 1 M HN03, 233UO2C12 in dilute HN03) radiotracers to the CMPO-cellulose material from aqueous acid solution with respect to distributions for both untreated and reconstituted cellulose blanks.  Measurements were made in 0.001 M, 0.01 M, 0.1 M, 1.0 M, and 10.0 M nitric acid solutions. All aqueous solutions were prepared in<br>
deionized water that was purified with a Barnstead deionization system (Dubuque, IA) and polished to 18.3 MQ cm-1.<br>
The dry weight conversion factors for the cellulose, reconstituted cellulose, and CMPO-cellulose materials were determined as follows.  A known mass of material was stirred in an excess of water for 24 hours at room temperature.  This was followed by 10 min of conditioning (air drying) on a Biichner funnel.  Once conditioned, samples were transferred to a preweighed crucible and dried in an oven at 110 C until a constant mass was achieved. Each gravimetric analysis was preformed in triplicate.  All materials were stored in tightly capped vials and were not exposed to air for any extensive period of time in order to maintain water content.<br>
All weight distribution ratios were<br>
determined radiometrically via batch contacts of the cellulose, regenerated cellulose, and CMPO-cellulose materials with the desired solutions.  The dry weight distribution ratio is defined as:<br>
Dw = [(Ao - Af) / Af] [V / (mR  dwcf)]<br>
where AO is the activity of the solution prior to contact, Af is the activity of the solution after contact, V is the volume (mL) of solution the material is contacted with, mR is the mass (g) of the cellulose or CMPO-cellulose material, and dwcf is the dry weight conversion factor that relates the mass of the hydrated material to its dry mass.<br>
The Dw studies were carried out as follows. The radiotracer was added to 1.3 mL of the solution<br>
of interest.  This was vortesced for one min, and two 100 µL aliquots removed for tadiometric counting (0) -One mL of the remaining solution (V) was then added to a known mass of dry cellulose, hydrated regenerated cellulose, or hydrated CMPO-cellulose material (mR) and centrifuged for one minute.  The solution was then allowed to stir (ensuring that the cellulose materials are not just suspended in solution) for approximately 60 minutes.  The contact time is believed to be sufficient for the systems to reach equilibrium. After completion of stirring, the samples were centrifuged for 2 minutes in order to completely separate the cellulose materials from the aqueous phase.  A 100 µL aliquot (Af) was then removed for counting.  Counting for 239Pu and 233UO2 were carried out using standard liquid scintillation analysis.  Counting for 241Am was carried using standard γ (gamma) radiometric analysis.  Duplicate radiometrically determined distributions ratios were consistent to ± 5%.<br>
The results of these extraction studies are shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 3. CMPO-cellulose successfully extracted the actinide from the nitric acid solution over a wide range of pH values, and the extractions were superior to those obtained using cellulose alone.<br>
Example 2: Incorporation of Protoporphyrin IX as a<br>
Further Hydrophobia Metal Extractant Protoporphyrin IX (10 mg, CAS 553-12-8; Aldrich Chemical Co.), was added as a powder to a solution of cellulose (Whatman filter paper, 1 g) in molten [C4mim] Cl (10 g) , [prepared by microwave heating of cellulose in the IL with short pulses<br>
until a viscous, homogeneous solution was formed] and stirred until dissolved, resulting in a dark red-orange viscous solution containing cellulose (10 weight percent) and dye (0.1 weight percent).  The cellulose was regenerated as a film by coating a glass sheet with a thin layer of the ionic liquid solution, followed by immersion into a bath containing deionized water. After immersion for 30 minutes, the orange cellulose film was removed from the regeneration bath and dried in air for 15 minutes to give a soft, pliable film.  The wash water was uncolored indicating that none of the. protoporphyrin .IX had leached from the film.<br>
The UV/vis spectrum of the film (transmission) showed the presence of the characteristic broad absorption band with a maximum at 400 nm from the Protoporphyrin IX metal extractant, enclosed within the film.<br>
Example 3: Formation of Colored Cellulose Products<br>
by Trapping of Dye Molecules The non-reactive dye, Victoria blue B (50 mg, CAS 2185-86-6; J. T. Baker Chemical Company, NJ) , was added as a powder at about 80° C to a preformed solution of cellulose (Whatman filter paper, 1.5 g) in molten [C4mim]Cl (30 g) [prepared by heating a slurry of the filter paper and [C4mim] Cl at 120° C for 5 hours with occasional stirring].  The resulting composition was stirred until the dye dissolved, resulting in an intense blue viscous solution containing cellulose (5 weight percent) and dye (0.15 weight percent).  The cellulose was regenerated as a film by coating a glass sheet with a thin layer of the ionic liquid solution, followed by immersion into<br>
a bath containing deionized water.  After immersion for 1 hour, the blue cellulose film was removed from the regeneration bath and dried in air for 15 minutes to give a soft, pliable film.  The water was pale blue indicating that a small concentration of dye had leached from the film.<br>
The UV/vis spectrum of the film (transmission) showed the presence of the characteristic broad absorption band with a maximum at 597 nm from the Victoria Blue B dye, enclosed within the film.<br>
Example 4: Formation of a pH-Sensitive Cellulose Film<br>
Cellulose azure (10 mg, CAS 76296-24-7; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), a pH-sensitive dye molecule (Remazol Brilliant Violet 5R) covalently attached to a cellulose backbone, was added as a powder to a solution of cellulose (microcrystalline cellulose [9004-34-6], 1 g; Sigma) in molten [C4mim]Cl (10 g).  The initial cellulose in IL solution was formed by pulsed microwave heating of cellulose powder in [C4mim]Cl, followed by cooling to about 90° C, at about which temperature the addition took place.  The resulting composition was stirred until the blue powder dissolved, resulting in an intense blue viscous solution containing cellulose (10 weight percent) and cellulose azure (0.1 weight percent).<br>
The cellulose was regenerated as a film by coating a glass sheet with a thin layer of the ionic liquid solution, followed by immersion into a bath containing deionized water. After immersion for 20 minutes, the blue cellulose film was removed from the regeneration bath and dried in air for 15 minutes to give a soft, pliable film.  The wash water was<br>
uncolored indicating that none of the cellulose azure had leached from the film.<br>
The sensitivity of the thus prepared cellulose-cellulose azure film to pH was tested by first immersing the membrane in a pH 7 buffer solution yielding a blue film.  The film was then transferred to a solution of pH 2 buffer causing a color change in the film from blue to pink.  This process was repeated with equivalent results several times and over the course of many months indicating that stability of the cellulose-cellulose azure pH sensitive film is long lasting.<br>
The UV/vis spectrum of the film (transmission) in Fig. 4 shows the pH sensitive cellulose-cellulose azure film with a blue absorption band with a maximum at 570 nm at pH 6.88 and a pink absorption band with a maximum at 550 nm at pH 2.10.<br>
Example 5: Encapsulation of Bovine Serum Albumin in a Cellulose Film<br>
Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added to a solution of cellulose (fibrous, Aldrich; 5 weight percent) dissolved in [C4mim] Cl that was prepared by pulse microwave heating of the cellulose fibers in the IL until a viscous, homogeneous solution was obtained.  The mixture was vortexed to disperse the BSA.  A thin film was prepared by coating a microscope slide with the IL solution.  Immersing the slide in a bath of deionized water regenerated the cellulose.<br>

(BSA) were taken.  The presence of an UV absorption peak centered at 280 nm in Fig. 5 is indicative of BSA entrapped within the cellulose film.  This peak is characteristic to the solution phase UV spectra for BSA (λmax = 284 nm) .<br>
Example 6 : Encapsulation of Laccase and a<br>
Hydrophobia Ionic Liquid in Cellulose<br>
Cellulose pulping sample (0.10 g) , obtained from International Paper (degree of polymerization ~ 1,0 00), was introduced to 5.0 g [bmim] Cl and microwave -heated in 3-5 second pulses.  Complete dissolution of the sample was achieved resulting in a viscous solution.  Cellulosic' matrix was cooled to room temperature to avoid heat -induced denaturation of the enzyme.<br>
In a separate vial, 5.0 mg laccase was introduced into 5.0 g [bmim] [Tf2N] to serve as a 'protective' coating for the enzyme. The coated laccase was then added to the cooled IL/cellulose solution and immediately cast into a film.  The film was washed with purified water three times to regenerate the cellulose and rid the film of excess ionic liquid.  A portion of the film was added to 5.6 mL of a 50 mM phosphate buffer solution spiked with 200uL syringealdizine solution [8.2 mg syringealdizine dissolved in 20mL MeOH] .  A UV/vis spectrum of the film inaicated incorporation of the enzyme into the regenerated cellulose matrix by the maximum absorption at about 280 nm, as is shown in Fig. 6. The colorless film was left in solution overnight (about eighteen hours) and activity of the entrapped enzyme was confirmed by the pink color of the film<br>
that is indicative of the laccase-catalyzed oxidization of syringealdizine.<br>
Example 7: Encapsulation of Ubicruinone in a Cellulose Film Matrix<br>
Ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q; Sigma Chemical Co.) is a membrane-bound electron carrier employed in the electron transport chain for production of cellular energy and the possibility of its encapsulation can lead to biologically conducting cellulose films regenerated from ionic liquids.  Macrocrystalline cellulose purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in [C4mim] Cl using 3-5 second microwave pulses to create a viscous mixture.  The mixture was cooled to room temperature from about 120-130° C, ubiquinone was added with stirring, and the resulting composition was cast into a film.  The film was subsequently washed three times with water to rid the film of excess IL.<br>
The resulting film was permitted to dry for two days and then subjected to UV/vis Scan (500 - 250 nm) on a Varian Cary-3 spectrophotometer.  A peak corresponding to the encapsulated Coenzyme Q was clearly visible at about 280 nm, which corresponds to aromatic moieties that exist in the biomolecule but not in native, IL-regenerated cellulose films.  This spectrum is shown in Fig. 7.<br>
Example 8: Formation of Magnetic Cellulose Particles<br>
Cellulose (1 g, Whatman filter paper substantially homogeneously) was dissolved in [C4mim]Cl (20 g) by heating at 120 C for 6 hours to form a 5 weight percent solution. Magnetite particles (1 g, about 5 micron powder; Aldrich<br>
Chemical Co.) were added to the molten solution and homogeneously distributed by vortexing the solution.<br>
A lozenge of cellulose/magnetite composite was then prepared by coating a plastic sheet (about 6 x 1.5 inch) with a film of the ionic liquid mixture. The sheet was placed in a bath containing deionized water and left to stand for 24 hours permitting all IL to be dissolved and diffuse from the matrix. The lozenge was then washed and maintained in distilled water.  The resulting soft, flexible cellulose/magnetite film was air dried to yield a hard, brittle black solid.<br>
Visual inspection using an optical microscope showed that the magnetite particles appeared to be disperse.  The cellulose film was magnetic, and was attracted to'a permanent magnet. Thermal gravimetric analysis of the air-dried film showed about 50 percent mass loss between 100-400 °C, confirming that all the magnetite was entrapped within the regenerated composite retaining the initial composition ratio of 1:1 cellulose:magentite.<br>
