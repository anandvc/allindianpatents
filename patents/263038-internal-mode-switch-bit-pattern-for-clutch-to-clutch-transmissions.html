INTERNAL MODE SWITCH BIT PATTERN FOR<br>
CLUTCH-TO-CLUTCH TRANSMISSIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to methods and systems for<br>
indicating a state of a range indication device for automatic transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] An internal mode switch (IMS) is a component of a<br>
transmission used to relay the driver's selected range intent to a control<br>
system of a vehicle. The IMS is a sliding contact electrical switch assembly<br>
attached to a lower control valve body of the transmission. Conventional<br>
switches consist of two major components: a housing, which houses at least<br>
six tracks of conductive and non-conductive material that make up stationary<br>
contacts, and an insulator assembly, which makes up the moving contacts<br>
and is linked to an operator controlled shift lever. The six tracks include circuit<br>
A, circuit B, circuit C, circuit P, a park-neutral circuit, and a ground circuit.<br>
[0003] The IMS is electrically connected to a control system of the<br>
vehicle via at least five wires (voltage is supplied to four and one is ground).<br>
Range detection is accomplished by securing the moving contacts of the IMS<br>
over the stationary contacts. For example, when a driver selects a PRNDL<br>
position, the shift lever causes IMS moving contacts to slide, which in turn<br>
grounds the four wires in a unique pattern for each PRNDL position. The bit<br>
pattern indicating the PRNDL position is comprised of A, B, C, and P circuits.<br>
The pattern is electronically communicated to the control system for<br>
interpretation.<br>
[0004] The pattern provided to the control system is used for engine<br>
controls as well as determining transmission shift patterns. The input voltage<br>
level is high (ignition voltage) when the circuit is open and low when the circuit<br>
is closed to ground.   It can be foreseen that a failure may occur in the IMS<br><br>
GP-307056<br>
2<br>
such that an inaccurate pattern is sent to the control system. A bit pattern<br>
strategy should be employed to detect all single point failure modes that may<br>
occur.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] Accordingly, a method for determining a position of a range<br>
indication device for an automatic transmission is provided. The method<br>
includes: receiving N bits corresponding to a state of N circuits, respectively,<br>
wherein the N bits are related to a position of a range indication device and<br>
wherein the position includes transmission range states and transitional states<br>
between the transmission range states; associating the bit patterns with at<br>
least one of the transitional states and the transmission range states; defining<br>
the bit pattern having N bits equal to a first state as the transitional state, and<br>
defining the bit pattern having N/2 bits equal to one of the first state and a<br>
second state as the transmission range state.<br>
[0006] In other features, a range indication device for indicating at<br>
least one of a range state and a transitional state to an automatic<br>
transmission control system is provided. The range indication device<br>
includes: a housing including N tracks that each include conductive and non-<br>
conductive material; a sliding mechanism that includes N contacts that align<br>
with the N tracks to form N circuits, wherein the sliding mechanism slides to M<br>
transitional positions and X range positions, and wherein the N circuits can be<br>
in at least one of a first state and a second state; and N signal generating<br>
devices that generate N signals based on the first state and the second state<br>
of the N circuits, and wherein the conductive material is positioned in the N<br>
tracks such that N circuits of the N circuits are in the first state when the<br>
sliding mechanism is in each of the M transitional positions.<br><br>
GP-307056<br>
3<br>
[0007] In still other features, a fault detection system for a range<br>
indication device is provided. The fault diction system includes: a signal input<br>
device that receives a signal indicating states of N circuits within the range<br>
indication device; a control module that receives the signal via the signal input<br>
device, assembles the signal into a bit pattern, and associates the bit pattern<br>
with at least one of a transitional state, a range state, and an illegal state,<br>
wherein if the bit pattern is associated with the illegal state, a fault is detected;<br>
and wherein if the bit pattern indicates N circuits are in a first state the bit<br>
pattern is associated with the transitional state, if the bit pattern indicates N/2<br>
circuits are in at least one of the first state and a second state the bit pattern is<br>
associated with the range state, and wherein otherwise the bit pattern is<br>
associated with the illegal state.<br>
[0008] Further areas of applicability of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should<br>
be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while<br>
indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for<br>
purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0015] The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will<br>
be used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that executes<br>
one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit,<br>
and/or other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0016] Referring now to Figure 1, a vehicle is shown generally at 10.<br>
The vehicle includes an engine 12 that drives a transmission 14 through a<br>
torque converter 16. Air is drawn into the engine 12 through a throttle 18.<br>
The air is mixed with fuel and combusted within cylinders (not shown) of the<br>
engine 12 to produce drive torque. The torque converter 16 supplies the<br>
engine torque to the transmission via an input shaft 20. The transmission 14<br>
in the exemplary embodiment is a multi-speed automatic clutch-to-clutch<br>
transmission that drives an output shaft 22 based on engine torque.<br>
[0017] The output shaft 22 drives a driveline 24 of the vehicle 10.<br>
The speed and torque relationships between the engine 12 and the driveline<br>
24 are controlled by hydraulically operated clutches C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5<br>
of the transmission 14. Pressurized fluid is provided to the clutches from a<br>
regulated hydraulic pressure source 28. The clutches C1, C2, C3, C4, and<br>
C5 are coupled to the hydraulic pressure source via control valves 30, which<br>
regulate clutch pressure by supplying or discharging fluid to/from the clutches<br>
01,02,03,04, and C5.<br><br>
GP-307056<br>
5<br>
[0018] A range selection device 26 enables an operator to set the<br>
transmission 14 at a desired operating range including, but not limited to,<br>
park, reverse, neutral, and one or more forward drive positions. The range<br>
selection device 26 is connected to an internal mode switch 27. An internal<br>
mode switch 27 generates mode signals. The mode signals indicate a bit<br>
encoding corresponding to states of four circuits of the internal mode switch<br>
27. As can be appreciated, the internal mode switch 27 can include any<br>
number (N) of circuits and the mode signals can indicate a bit encoding<br>
corresponding to states for N circuits of the internal mode switch 27. A control<br>
module 40 receives the mode signals and interprets the mode signals as an<br>
IMS state according to a bit pattern of the present invention. The IMS state<br>
can be a transitional state, a range state, and an illegal state. Based on the<br>
interpreted IMS state, the control module determines the intended range and<br>
controls engine operation and transmission shift patterns based on the range.<br>
Further, the control module 40 can detect a fault in the switch 27 based on the<br>
bit pattern.<br>
[0019] Referring now to Figure 2, the diagram illustrates an<br>
exemplary placement of conductive tracks in an IMS 27 such that a bit pattern<br>
according to the present invention can be produced. Horizontal lines of the<br>
diagram correspond to tracks A, B, C, and P. The placement of conductive<br>
tracks is illustrated by darkened lines 50-80. Vertical lines of the diagram<br>
correspond to positive IMS states: park, reverse, neutral, drive 6, drive 4,<br>
drive 3, and drive 2. The area between the positive IMS states is considered<br>
transitional states. Placement of the conductive tracks 50-80 should be such<br>
that all circuits are closed when the IMS 27 is in a transitional state. In the<br>
alternative (not shown), placement of the conductive tracks can be such that<br>
all circuits are open when the IMS 27 is in a transitional state.<br><br>
GP-307056<br>
6<br>
[0020] Referring now to Figure 3, a table illustrates bit patterns and<br>
their mapping to an IMS state according to the present invention. Each bit<br>
pattern includes bits A, B, C, and P which correspond to circuit A, circuit B,<br>
circuit C, and circuit P of the IMS respectively. The bit 0 indicates the circuit is<br>
closed to common. The bit 1 indicates the circuit is open to common. In an<br>
alternative embodiment, the bits can be inverted. In column 100, bit patterns<br>
are shown in ABCP format. In column 110, an IMS state that corresponds to<br>
the bit pattern is shown. IMS states can be, transitional, illegal, park, neutral,<br>
reverse, D2, D3, D4, and D6. According to the bit pattern mapping, a single<br>
transitional state is created between all positive IMS states. Thus creating<br>
eight (8) illegal bit patterns for diagnosing single point failures. The table of<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the bit patterns that correspond to operating ranges of the<br>
transmission as requested by the operator via the range selection device.<br>
The controller determines the range based on these bit patterns.<br>
[0021] Referring now to Figure 5, a chart illustrates all single point<br>
failures that can be diagnosed with the bit pattern containing four bits.<br>
Column 200 lists the single point failures that can occur for circuits A, B, C<br>
and P where each circuit is either open or shorted. Row 210 lists the<br>
mechanical positions of the IMS. Mechanical positions can be: positive range<br>
states including park, reverse, neutral, drive 6, driver 4, drive 3, drive 2, and<br>
transitional states including park to reverse, reverse to neutral, neutral to drive<br>
6, drive 6 to drive 4, drive 4 to drive 3, and drive 3 to drive 2. Shaded cells,<br>
for example cell 220, indicate failures that can be diagnosed given the current<br>
bit pattern. As can be appreciated, an IMS 27 with more or fewer tracks can<br>
similarly diagnose single point failures, so long as the bit pattern includes a<br>
single transitional state between each positive range state.<br><br>

[0022] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the<br>
foregoing description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
invention should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, specification,<br>
