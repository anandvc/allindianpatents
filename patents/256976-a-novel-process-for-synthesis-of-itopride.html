THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel vanilloid receptor ligands, in particular VR1 receptor antagonists, and uses thereof for treating diseases, conditions and/or disorders modulated by a vanilloid receptor.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Pain is the most common symptom for which patients seek medical advice and treatment. Pain can be acute or chronic. While acute pain is usually self-limiting, chronic pain persists for 3 months or longer and can lead to significant changes in a patient's personality, lifestyle, functional ability and overall quality of life (see K. M. Foley, Pain, in Cecil Textbook of Medicine 100-107 (see J. C. Bennett and F. Plum eds., 20th ed. 1996)). The sensation of pain can be triggered by any number of physical or chemical stimuli and the sensory neurons which mediate the response to this harmful stimuli are termed as "nociceptors". Nociceptors are primary sensory afferent (C and A5 fibers) neurons that are activated by a wide variety of noxious stimuli including chemical, mechanical, thermal, and proton (pH 
Moreover, chronic pain can be classified as either nociceptive or neuropathic. Nociceptive pain includes tissue injury-induced pain and inflammatory pain such as that associated with arthritis. Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the sensory nerves of the peripheral or central nervous system and is maintained by aberrant somatosensory processing. There is a large body of evidence relating activity at vanilloid receptors (VR1) (see V. Di Marzo et al., Current Opinion in Neurobiology 12:372-379 (2002)) to pain processing.<br>
The lipophilic vanilloid, Capsaicin(8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamides; CAP) is known to stimulate pain pathways through the release of a variety of sensory afferent neurotransmitters via a specific cell surface capsaicin receptor, cloned as the first vanilloid receptor (VR1 now known as TRPV1) (see Caterina MJ,et.al„ Science , 2000 Apr 14; 288(5464):306-13). Capsaicin is the main pungent component in hot pepper. Hot pepper has been used, for a long time, not only as a spice but also as a traditional medicine in the treatment of gastric disorders and when applied locally, for the relief of pain and inflammation. CAP has a wide spectrum of biological actions, and not only<br>
-2-<br><br>
exhibits effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems but also induces pain and irritancy on local application. CAP, however, after such induction of pain, induces desensitization, both to CAP itself and also to other noxious stimuli to stop the pain. The intradermal administration of capsaicin is characterized by an initial burning or hot sensation followed by a prolonged period of analgesia. The analgesic component of VRl receptor activation is thought to be mediated by a capsaicin-induced desensitization of the primary sensory afferent terminal. Based on this property, CAP and its analogues such as olvanil, nuvanil, DA-5018, SDZ-249482, resiniferatoxin are either used or are under development as analgesic agents, therapeutic agents for urinary incontinence or skin disorder {see Wriggleworth and Walpore, Drugs of the Future, 23, pp531-538, (1998)).<br>
VRl is widely expressed in non-neuronal tissues in various organ systems, and the functional roles of VRl in various systems are not properly understood at this time. Increasing number of animal studies have revealed the possible involvement of VRl receptors in various pathologies and based on such information VRl is now being considered as a molecular target for various indications such as migraine, arthralgia, diabetic neuropathy, neurodegeneration, neurotic skin disorder, stroke, cardiac pain arising from an ischemic myocardium, Huntington's disease, memory deficits, restricted brain function, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia, urinary bladder hypersensitiveness, urinary incontinence, vulvodynia, pruritic conditions such as uremic pruritus, irritable bowel syndrome including gastro-esophageal reflux disease, enteritis ,ileitis , stomach-duodenal ulcer, inflammatory bowel disease including Crohn's disease, celiac disease and inflammatory diseases such as pancreatitis, and in respiratory disorders such as allergic and non-allergic rhinitis, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, irritation of skin, eye or mucous membrane, dermatitis, and in non specific disorders such as fervescence, retinopathy, muscle spasms, emesis, dyskinesias or depression. Specifically VRl antagonists are likely to be used in multiple sub-types of pain such as acute, chronic, neuropathic pain or post-operative pain, as well as in pain due to neuralgia (e.g. post herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia; and in pain due to diabetic neuropathy or dental pain as well as in cancer pain. Additionally, VRl antagonists will also prove useful in the treatment of inflammatory pain conditions e.g. arthritis, and osteoarthritis. VRl antagonists hold potential benefit in diabetes, obesity,<br>

urticaria,   actinic  keratosis,   keratocanthoma,   alopecia,   Meniere's  disease,  tinnitus, hyperacusis and anxiety disorders.<br>
Certain class of natural and synthetic compounds which modulate the function of Vanilloid Receptor (VR1) have been characterised by the presence of a vanillyl (4-hydroxy 3-methoxybenzyl) group or a functionally equivalent group and the same have been widely studied and is extensively reviewed by Szallasi and Blumberg (see The Ame. Soc. for Pharmacology and  Experimental Therapeutics, 1999, Vol. 51, No. 2.).<br><br>
Various vanilloid agonists and antagonists have been developed for the treatment of pain; the agonists work through desensitizing the receptor while antagonists block its stimulation by (patho) physiological ligands. The first antagonist to be developed was Capsazepine belonging to Novartis which has the formula A<br>

Screening for TRPV1 antagonist using the 45Calcium uptake assay:<br>
The inhibition of TRPV1 receptor activation was followed as inhibition of capsaicin induced cellular uptake of radioactive calcium which represents calcium influx exclusively through the plasma membrane associated TRPV1 receptor. Materials:<br>
Stock solution of capsaicin was made in ethanol and test compounds in 100 % DMSO. Stock solutions were diluted to appropriate final concentrations in assay buffer keeping the final DMSO concentration between 0.1% and 0.55%. <br>
45Ca was used at a final concentration of 2.5 uCi/ml (45Ca, ICN).<br>
 Assay buffer was composed of F-12 DMEM medium supplemented with 1.8 mM CaCl2 (final cone.) and 0.1 % Bovine serum albumin.(BSA from SIGMA) <br>
Wash buffer was tyrodes solution supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 1.8 mM calcium. Lysis buffer contained 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate and 0.1% Sodium dodicyl sulphate (SDS, SIGMA)<br>
 Method:<br>
Assay was carried out with some modifications the of procedure as described by Toth et.al.( See Toth A et. al, Life Sciences 73 p 487-498 ,200J)._Human TRPV1 expressing CHO cells were grown in F-12 DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium -GIBCO ) medium with 10% FBS( fetal bovine serum Hyclone), 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, 400 μg I ml of G-418. Cells were seeded 48 h prior to the assay in 96 well plates so as to get ~ 50,000 cells per well on the day of experiment. Plates were incubated at 37°C in the presence of 5 % CO2. Cells were then washed twice with 200 μl of assay buffer and re-suspended in 144 \x\ of the same. Assay was carried out at 30°C in total volume of 200 μl. Test compounds were added to the cells fifteen minutes before addition of capsaicin. Final concentration of capsaicin in the assay was 250 nM. After 5 minutes of agonist treatment, drug was washed out and wells rinsed with 300 μl of ice cold wash buffer 3X. The cells were lysed in 50 μl lysis buffer for 20 min. 40 μl of cell lysate was mixed with 150 μl of Microscint PS, left overnight for equilibration. Radioactivity in samples was measured as counts per<br>
-26-<br><br>
minute (cpm) using Packard Biosciences Top Count. The drug / vehicle / capsaicin treated 45Ca uptake values were normalized over basal 45Ca value. Data was expressed as % inhibition of 45Ca uptake by test compound with respect to maximum 45Ca uptake induced by capsaicin alone. IC50 value was calculated from dose response curve by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPadPRISM software.<br>
Results are as summarized in the table<br><br>
Example No.	% inhibition of 45Ca uptake at 1 μM	IC50 nM<br>

2	96.12	170.8<br>
