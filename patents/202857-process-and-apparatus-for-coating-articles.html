Typically, the recycle line includes a strainer, filter and pumps means for straining and filtering the coating composition to be recycled to the feed tank.<br>
At least one heat exchanger is provided between the feed tank for heating the coating composition for adjusting its viscosity.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of this invention, a strip heater is provided just before feeding pressurized coating composition to the spraying gun for heating the coating composition and thereby<br>
8<br><br>
adjusting the viscosity of the coating composition being fed to the spraying gun.<br>
Typically, a differential gauge controlled filtering arrangement provided between the feed tank and the spraying gun for filtering the coating composition being fed to the spraying gun.<br>
Typically, according to the filtering arrangement includes a stand by filter for diverting the coating composition in case of chocking of the filtering arrangement.<br>
A control valve for controlling the feeding of coating composition from the feed tank to the spraying gun/s may also be included.<br>
Another feature of this invention is a programmed logic controller arrangement equipped with sensors for controlling the flow, viscosity and temperature of coating composition being fed to the spraying gun/s.<br>
The apparatus of this invention incorporates equipment to avoid wastage by recycling of the synthetic or natural polymeric material such as the lacquer and usage of the recycled coating material as part of a continuous process of coating.<br>
In the conventional coating by spraying process, water curtains or dry<br>
air booth consisting of paper filter walls are used.     This type of<br>
system has a high maintenance requirement and is not economical.<br>
9<br><br>
Envisaged in accordance with this invention is a Wet Booth System (controlled atmosphere in which the coating material is directly sprayed on the article and the mist is collected by using a high speed De-mister consisting of Centrifugal Mist Filtration System. From the mist collected, air and coating material such as the lacquer are separated, centrifugally. The coating material is collected and conditioned. This results in material and time saving raising efficiency to the tune of 85~92%. The present rate of wastage in conventional type of systems is about 60%.<br>
The recycling of coating material such as lacquer and on-line usage of the coating material is provided on continuous basis. Continuous (in line) usage of the recycled material &amp; controlled atmosphere booth saves time and material.<br>
Recycling of the coating reduces pollution load released in the atmosphere during the process since the spraying composition is almost completely recycled.<br>
Again in accordance with a preferred embodiment of this invention<br>
the spraying guns are positioned in a three-dimension array placed<br>
angularly with respect to each other. Uniform coating of the article is<br>
achieved either by placing the article between the spraying guns or by<br>
conveying the article on a moving conveyor passing between the<br>
spraying guns.   In the process of spraying, the article may be fixed or<br>
rotated or angularly displaced so that spraying takes place on all or<br>
desired surfaces. The guns may be stationary or displaceable and may<br>
10<br><br>
be strategically located to spray some or all of the surfaces. The spraying process is conducted without any human intervention.<br>
It is possible to coat the articles by displacing the guns or revolving the articles. Total area of the article is covered by the guns, which are positioned specifically. The production level can be optimized, since process according to this invention is continuous.<br>
In accordance with an alternative embodiment of the invention the spraying is either air assisted or airless or electro static.<br>
The movement of the articles via the conveyor is at speeds controlled between 1 mtr. per minute to 50 meters per minute. The spraying guns may be preferably adjusted to deliver high volume at low pressure coating compositions to the spraying area. Alternatively, the spraying guns can be adjusted to deliver low volume at high pressure.<br>
Various sensors including optical sensors may be provided at the entrance and exit of the spraying booth to sense the presence or absence of the article or the abutment of the articles or its proper coating to enable or disable the spraying guns.<br>
The apparatus of this invention is designed for high as well as low<br>
viscous coating materials including lacquers.     Lacquers with high<br>
viscosity  need  pre-heating  before   spraying  to   achieve   required<br>
properties.       Final desirable point of heating of the material is<br>
achieved just before spraying to achieve the desired viscosity.    This<br>
11<br><br>
reduces power consumption resulting in an economic system for spraying and curing.   In the process in accordance with this invention<br>
heating can be done by using hot water.	<br>
No solid &amp; liquid waste is produced in the process according to  this invention.    The equipment ensures clean and healthy environment.      <br>
User does not have to bother about the maintenance of the machine and cleaning of the surroundings due to wastage created as in the conventional method.<br>
In accordance with this invention, after spraying the coated article is led through a curing process in which, typically ultra-violet, infra-red, micro-wave, thermal convection / radiation generating sources are provided at particular angle to give direct radiation on all the sides and edges of the article. Rotation / revolving of the article or movement of the curing sources may be provided.<br>
A typical process in accordance with this invention includes the following steps:<br>
1)	Loading of articles on the conveyor<br>
2)	Pre treatment of the article, if required.<br>
3)	Spraying of coating material on predefined surfaces or faces of the articles.<br>
4)	Flashing off [i.e. removing flashes of excess coating material from the surface of the articles.<br>
5)	Curing of the sprayed surface of article.<br>
12<br><br>
6)	Cooling of articles, if required<br>

The invention will now be described with reference to accompanying drawing, in which :<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic top view of the apparatus and the process of this<br>
invention;<br>
Figure 2 shows a schematic side view of the apparatus and the process of<br>
this invention; and<br>
Figure 3 is a detailed schematic view of the spraying booth showing the<br>
recycling and re-circulating arrangement.<br>
Referring to the drawings, there is disclosed an apparatus for carrying out a process for coating articles with a coating composition, typically a lacquer consisting of a spraying booth 10 fitted with at least one spraying gun [SGI, SG2, SG3] via a gun mounting arrangement 24 for spraying coating composition on articles to be coated [not shown], a curing station 20 where coated articles are led for curing, a conveyor [14, 22] for conveying the articles to be coated from the spraying booth 10 to the curing station 20. Provision is made to have flexible gun mounting with easy replacement as well as change of location. Proper care is taken for preventing vibration of gun assembly during spraying. Spraying-gun flushing system [not shown] is provided to clean the guns. In the spraying system, depending upon the size of article, number of guns are placed to take care of uniform coating of articles. Typical arrangement is two guns at side diagonally opposite each other and one at top.<br>
Conveyor drive mechanism  18  is provided for driving the  conveyor.<br>
Alignment means in the form of alignment bars 16 and guides 44 are<br>
14<br><br>
provided for guiding the articles on the conveyor leading to the spraying booth. The apparatus includes a flash off conveyor 30 located between the spraying booth and the curing station for removing flashings of the coating composition from the coated articles. Properly aligned articles with proper spacing are carried on the conveyor. Provision of guides are made to locate and move the articles in a straight line to avoid jamming and misalignment of articles inside the booth.<br>
The spraying booth 10 is defined by a recycling pot 36 at the operative base of the booth and a coating composition mist extraction arrangement 28 at the operative top of the booth and means to permit ingress and egress of a conveyor bearing articles to be coated [not shown]<br>
The apparatus includes a feed tank 58 for supplying coating composition to the spraying gun/s in the spraying booth 10. The apparatus further includes means for on line pressurizing the coating composition to be supplied to the spraying guns/s. Coating composition is fed to the guns by individual double acting diaphragm pumps 68 through filters [74,76] . The pump sucks material from the feed tank 58. There is provision of heating to maintain uniform viscosity i.e. the rate of shearing strain to shearing stress of the coating composition which is a Newtonian fluid throughout the day irrespective of ambient variation. Guns are provided with re-circulation line 98 to take back excess material to the tank.<br>
The apparatus includes feeding means in the form of a duct 46 for feeding the extracted feeding coating composition at or near the base of the booth<br>
10.<br>
15<br><br>
A scraping mechanism as well as guides are provided on the conveyor belt. The scraping mechanism is provided on the spray conveyor belt to remove excess sprayed material, which is again recycled. For this purpose there is included scrapping means [34,48] for scrapping excess composition from the moving conveyor and allowing the scrapped material to fall by gravity to  the base of the booth 10 into the recycling pot 36. The scraping arrangements are made to take care of wiping out of excess-sprayed material. Material of construction of the conveyor is S.S. or suitable material. Provision is made for easy belt replacement as well as proper guiding mechanism.<br>
Recycling means are also included for recycling the coating composition collected at the base of the booth to the feed tank via a recycling line 56. The recycle line 56 includes a strainer 50 , filter 54 and pump means 52 for straining and filtering the coating composition to be recycled to the feed tank.<br>
Re-circulating means are provided for re-circulating excess pressurized coating composition from the at least one spraying gun to the feed tank via a re-circulating line 98. The feed tank 58 thus receives coating composition from the virgin material inlet 60, the recycling line 56 and the re-circulating line 98.<br>
In accordance with the embodiment shown a pre treatment booth 12 is<br>
provided for pre treating the articles to be coated by one or more methods of<br>
treatment from a group of treatments which include flaming , ionization,<br>
primer coating, cleaning, degreasing, conditioning and the like.<br>
16<br><br>
Mist collector of required capacity takes care of mist generated during the actual spraying operation. The mist extraction arrangement 28 , particularly seen in figure 2 consists of a perforated bowl with baffles 42 driven by a motor 40 and includes a filter 38 for filtering the coating composition mist before leading it to the base of the spraying booth 10 and feeding the mist of the coating composition collected via a re-circulating duct to the base of the spraying booth 10 and into the recycling pot 36.<br>
Coating composition collected in the recycling pot 36 is pumped up to the feeding tank 58 via the re-circulating which line includes an online filter 54 and a strainer 50.<br>
The feed tank 58 is provided with a level indication means 62.<br>
Heat exchangers 64 with water in let 70 and water outlet 72 and heat exchanger 90 with water inlet 94 and water outlet 92 are provided between the feed tank and th spraying guns SGI, SG2, and SG3 for heating the coating composition for adjusting its viscosity. Heated coating composition is fed to the guns via a distribution manifold 66. The flow of the coating composition is pressurized by means of the pump 68, which is typically a diaphragm pump.<br>
For final adjustment of viscosity a strip heater 105 is provided just before feeding pressurized coating composition to the spraying gun for heating the coating composition and thereby adjusting the viscosity of the coating composition being fed to the spraying gun.   It is to be noted that shear<br>
17<br><br>
viscosity is inversely proportional to the temperature and it is critical that the temperature be maintained in a narrow range of 55 to 70 degrees Celsius.<br>
The apparatus includes a differential gauge 78 controlled filtering arrangement consisting of a main filter 74 and a stand by filter 76 provided on line. The stand by filter 76 is provided for diverting the coating composition in case of chocking of the filtering arrangement.<br>
The apparatus further includes a flow control valve 80 for controlling the feeding of coating composition from the pump 68 to the spraying guns. The control valve also controls the flow of process air from the air inlet 82 and air inlets to the pump 68.<br>
Still further the apparatus includes a programmed logic controller arrangement 100 equipped with sensors 70 for controlling the flow, viscosity and temperature of coating composition being fed to the spraying guns.<br>
The guns are cleaned by solvent to avoid scaling inside the spraying system. A separate frame for filter-mist mounting, to avoid the physical contact between spray booth and filter-mist, is provided.   It helps to avoid transfer of vibration to spray guns. On the same frame, filter, differential gauges as well as flow regulators and diaphragm pump are mounted.<br>
The provision of the flash-off conveyor 30 helps to gain time for setting the material over the article. Alternatively, it helps to take out the excess material from the bottom side of the article.<br>
18<br><br>
The oven conveyor 22 conveys the article, which is conveyed from flash-off conveyor to curing zone for on-line curing. The structure of the conveyor may be SS or like material having a teflon-coated belt to convey the article. Conveyor cooling arrangement or exhaust of heat arrangement [not shown] avoids excess heating of conveyor.<br>
The curing station 20 is a closed box type structure wherein insulated panels are mounted on angle frame of suitable material. There is an arrangement to mount ultraviolet lamp or infra-red lamp or any other radiation device, adjustments for movements as well as cooling arrangement to improve the effectiveness of curing. Necessary cooling arrangement of exhaust is fitted in the booth 20.<br>
A cooling blower is provided at the bottom side of booth to avoid overheating of booth and conveyor.<br>
All Conveyors have individual gear motors with chain and sprocket arrangements. The controls of speed is effected through frequency modularisation via inverters. The spray conveyor and the flash off conveyor drives operate the drives attached to a single gear motor.<br>
Water bath heating system heats the material uniformly &amp; individual temperature controllers maintain the set temperature. Necessary heat exchangers and pumps may be provided. If required additional heating system like strip heater / heat tracer can be incorporated.<br>
19<br><br>
Excess material sprayed during spraying operation is therefore collected by<br>
three ways in the centralized collection recycle pot, viz. the mist collected in<br>
the de-mister, spraying material collected from the spraying booth &amp; excess <br>
sprayed material collected from the conveyor through the belt scrappec To<br>
make use of material in the recycle pot the re-cycle system is inceluded (refer<br>
Fig. 3), by which coating material is sucked through a pump and passed <br>
through filter system back to the feed tank.	The booth is also provided<br>
with a wire mesh to avoid entry of other solid particles/waste in the re-cycle<br>
pot.     The excess-sprayed material thus collected in the pot is pumped<br>
through strainers fitted in the pot.    Provision of two filters, in parallel, is<br>
made in order to keep the process constant. In the event one of the filter gets<br>
chocked, the process continues with the second filter.    Audio-visual signal<br>
is given if the filter gets chocked in order to enable the operator to clean or<br>
