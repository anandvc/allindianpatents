				<td>1.0 Field of invention<br>
This invention relates to a noble method of determining the sustainability period of<br>
stockpiled soil for suitable plant growth without biological reclamation.<br>
2.0 Back ground of the invention<br>
Opencast mining is progressively increasing in India"s coal production. In the process of<br>
opencast mining, the area is completely stripped of vegetation to remove the overburden covering<br>
the coal seam. There are several changes occur in the physical, chemical and microbiological<br>
properties of soils as a result of storage. Some caused by the actual construction of the store rather<br>
than during the course of storage. By for the greatest impact of mining on the nation"s soil<br>
resources is due to opencast mining, which is having a very much potential for the deterioration of<br>
soil quality than underground operations. The following qualitative losses suffered by dug topsoil<br>
over time:<br>
i) Complete loss of profile due to mixing of soil horizons,<br>
ii) Dominance of sand particles indicating low stability of aggregates,<br>
iii) Decrease of the silt and clay fraction due to increased erosion,<br>
iv) Increase of bulk density and pore spaces arising out of the use of earth moving<br>
heavy machineries. As a result gaseous diffusion becomes more difficult and<br>
restricts growth of deep-rooted plants.<br>
v) Decrease of moisture retention properties due to changes of topography,<br>
vi) Increase in wilting capacity indicates the deficiency of plant growth materials,<br>
vii) Increased acidity due to leaching of basic cations and increase of soluble salts due<br>
to the mixing of lower soil horizons,<br>
viii) Decrease in cation exchange capacity (CEC) owing to the presence of low content<br>
of organic matter and decrease of clay percent,<br>
ix) Increase in organic carbon and total nitrogen probably due to low humification due<br>
to the lack if soil micro flora.<br>
x) Increase in C/N ratio due to lack of microbial decomposition,<br>
xi) Reduction in fertility status (NPK) due to maximum leaching and mixing of soil<br>
horizons.<br>
xii) Increase of the concentration of available (Diethylenetriamine pentacetic acid<br>
i.e.DTPA extractable) iron and manganese due to increase of acidity.<br>
xiii) Reduction in soil microbes due to the presence of low concentration of organic<br>
carbon, moisture and other edaphic factors.<br>
xiv) Reduction in native seed species due to degradation of soil characteristics.<br>
Mineral extraction process must ensure the return of the productivity of the affected land. With<br>
the rising environmentalism concurrent post-mining reclamation of the degraded land has become<br>
integrated feature of the whole mining spectrum. Conservation and reclamation efforts to ensure<br>
continued beneficial use of land resources are essential. Opencast mining severely disturbs land in<br>
and around mining areas. It is reported that every million tonne of coal extracted by surface<br>
mining methods damage a surface area of about 4 ha in India. The coal industry alone accounts for<br>
rendering biologically unproductive area of about 500 ha a year during 1994-95, which rose to<br>
1400 ha a year by 2000 AD.<br>
The topsoil must be mined separately at the beginning of the mining operation. This is<br>
particularly necessary in coal mining areas due to the scarcity of soil in the coalfields. Five years<br>
or more may pass between the removal of topsoil and its replacement over the reclaimed area.<br>
During this time the soils are found to become biologically sterile, and its nutrient value are found<br>
to be lost completely The US Department of Interior regulations require that topsoil should be<br>
removed in a separate layer from the areas to be disturbed. The main environmental factors<br>
inhabiting the plant growth in soil dumps are instability, unknown steep slopes, high levels of<br>
toxic elements, wind erosion and low nutrient status and absence of soil microorganism and soil<br>
fauna. Stockpiling of soil materials has been found to degrade the soil quality by decreasing the<br>
organic matter content, disrupting nutrient cycles and increasing the bulk density. Areas damaged<br>
by mining depend on seam thickness, stripping ratio and quarry depth. Direct damage to land takes<br>
place due to excavation and creation of overburden, mineral dumps, civil structures, roads and<br>
colonies. Indirect damage takes place due to water pollution, hydrological disturbance, silting and<br>
run off. Opencast mining also leads to rapid erosion of land because of slope stability problems<br>
and sometimes it may cause landslides. Land degradation may result in soil erosion leading to the<br>
destruction of watersheds, siltation and loss of valuable fertile soil. To combat these situation a<br>
fact finding survey is essential<br>
3.0 Drawback associated with the known art<br>
Topsoil is an essential component in abandoned mines for growth of vegetation and has to<br>
be preserved for post-mining land reclamation. It is seriously damaged if it is not mined out<br>
separately in the beginning with view to replacement of for reclamation of the area. It is necessary<br>
to save topsoil for latter use in a manner to protect the primary root medium from the<br>
contamination and erosion, hence its productivity. Systematic handling and storage practice can<br>
protect the properties of topsoil while in storage and also when it has been redistributed on to the<br>
regarded areas. It should be noted that the period between the initial removal of the topsoil and<br>
final laying of the same over the reclamated area might be a long time lapse. So the properties of<br>
stockpiled soil deteriorate and become biologically unproductive. The issue is the preservation of<br>
topsoil (stockpiling) in such a manner as to protect its productivity for later use in restoration of<br>
mined land. This problem is very much acute in India and a vast mined out areas are continually<br>
being biologically sterile every year.<br>
Reclamation of degraded land has become a great challenge to Indian coal mining industry.<br>
Efforts to grow vegetation on overburden dumps and degraded mined lands as a part of biological<br>
reclamation are not being successful. The reasons are not completely understood and no work in<br>
this line has yet been reported As this soil is to be utilized for the reclamation of degraded mined<br>
land it is essential to search out the reasons of mined out areas of being biologically unproductive<br>
4.0 Object of invention<br>
The method of determining the period of sustainability of stockpiled mined soil for plant<br>
growth in mining areas specifically in open cast mining areas.<br>
5.0 A summary of invention<br>
Thus according to the present invention there is provided a method of determining the period<br>
of sustainability of stockpiled soil for plant growth in mining areas comprising the steps of<br>
measurement of soil properties required for plant growth on different aged stockpiled mine soil<br>
dumps and unmined land of similar geographical conditions.<br>
analysis of the deterioration of soil properties stockpiled mine soil with respect to time<br>
determining the said period of sustainability as the time period till which the soil have the soil<br>
properties required plant growth as in case of mined soil of similar conditions.<br>
As this soil is to be utilized for the reclamation of degraded mined land it is essential to<br>
determine the the period of sustainability of stockpiled. No systematic study has been reported to<br>
determine shelf life period. It has been observed that prolonged stockpiling implies continual loss<br>
of fertility, which ultimately leads to biological sterility.<br>
Almost in every mineral-bearing zone mining and land degradation have been inseparably<br>
connected. Irrespective of the scheme of exploitation, mining may be expected to affect the<br>
environment and ecology of the region. By far the greatest impact of mining on India"s soil<br>
resources with opencast mining having a greater potential for the deterioration of soil quality than<br>
underground operations. In the process of opencast mining the area is completely stripped of<br>
vegetation to remove the overburden covering the coal seam. There are several changes in the<br>
physical, chemical and microbiological properties of soils as a result of storage, some caused by<br>
the actual construction of the storage rather than during the course of storage.<br>
Topsoil is an essential component of land reclamation in mining areas. The topsoil is very<br>
seriously damaged if it is not mined out separately in the beginning with a view for replacement<br>
for due reclamation of the area. This is particularly necessary to save topsoil for a later use in a<br>
manner to protect the primary root medium from contamination and erosion and hence its<br>
productivity. It has been indicated, however, that systematic handling and storage practices can<br>
protect physical and chemical characteristics of topsoil while in storage and also after it has been<br>
redistributed onto the regarded area. Monitoring and implementation of these steps in accordance<br>
with site-specific modern technology will minimize the deterioration and provide a medium for<br>
plant growth.<br>
Topsoil is very useful in abandoned mines for the growth of vegetation. It is extremely<br>
required for post mining land reclamation. It is to be excavated separately and stockpiled when it<br>
becomes impractical to redistribute immediately. Efforts to grow vegetation on overburden dumps<br>
and degraded mined lands as a part of biological reclamation are not being successful in India. The<br>
reasons were not completely understood.<br>
. It is claimed that if the shelf life period of soil in a particular area is determined, mining<br>
authority can decide whether it becomes essential to go for cost intensive biological reclamation or<br>
they can preserve the mined soil by technical reclamation only. This ensures the saving time as<br>
well as money. A prior knowledge of topsoil shelf life periods would enable the mine planner to<br>
draw up an appropriate strategy for topsoil excavation vis-a-vis mine scheduling. An appropriate<br>
concurrent and post mining reclamation strategy can also be chalked out.<br>
By determining the deterioration of physical, chemical and microbiological properties in<br>
different aged soil dumps the shelf life period can be ascertained. Shelf life period indicates<br>
whether biological reclamation is required for the stockpiled topsoil. Biological reclamation must<br>
be adopted to preserve the topsoil if the storage period exceeds the shelf life period. If the shelf<br>
life period of topsoil in a particular area is determined, the mining authority can decide whether it<br>
is essential to choose biological reclamation for the preservation of topsoil or whether they can<br>
preserve the soil by technical reclamation only. A prior knowledge of topsoil shelf life period<br>
would enable mine planners to draw up an appropriate strategy for topsoil excavation vis-a-vis<br>
mine scheduling. An appropriate concurrent and post mining reclamation strategy can also be<br>
determined. This will not only save time but also save money.<br>
Another important aspect of this invention is the shortening of time frame for the<br>
determination of shelf life period. Generally such a study would require 10 years time to determine<br>
the shelf period in a particular area. But an innovative approach has been developed, which<br>
requires only 5-6 months time for the study for the determination of the said shelf life. The<br>
techniques adopted for achieving the target are given below:<br>
• The shelf life period in a particular area depends on climatic conditions, soil<br>
characteristics and site-specific factors. It will vary from area to area. To determine the<br>
shelf life period in a particular area one opencast coal mine (working) is to be<br>
investigated.<br>
• Unmined areas surrounding the working mine are to be investigated for the generation<br>
of base line data of unmined soil and they are to be compared with those of mined soil<br>
to determine the deterioration of soil quality due to mining.<br>
• From the different aged soil dumps (1 to 10 years) and from the unmined land of<br>
similar soil type soil samples are to be collected.<br>
• Approach for the selection of soil sampling locations in virgin areas as well as from the<br>
dumps, method of sampling, sample preparation, parameters to be considered<br>
determination of soil quality, method of determination are given in the Data collection<br>
methods section (Section 6.2).<br>
• Representative soil samples are to be collected from different spots taken from a<br>
uniform depth and of the same approximate volume, which are distributed at random<br>
covering each sampling unit and twelve number of composite samples are to be<br>
prepared<br>
• Field tests and laboratory tests are to be conducted to generate the base line data for the<br>
unmined land and for different aged soil dumps with respect to physical and water<br>
retention properties, physico-chemical and ion-exchange properties, available macro<br>
and micro nutrients and microbial population and the base line data of the unmined<br>
land and different aged soil dumps are to be determined.<br>
• Profile characteristics of the soil, soil physical properties, infiltration rate, water<br>
retention properties, available macronutrients, micronutrients and microbial status of<br>
soil are to be studied. The properties of the unmined soil are to be compared with those<br>
of the different aged soil dumps and the deterioration of the soil properties with respect<br>
to time is to be determined.<br>
• The graphical representation of the deterioration of soil organic carbon, nitrogen,<br>
phosphorous, potassium are to be plotted and the data results are to be examined to<br>
determine the quantitative losses of soil properties with respect to time till sterility<br>
• From the deterioration of soil physical, chemical and microbiological properties in<br>
different aged dumps till sterility shelf life period is to be determined..<br>
6.0 Detailed description of the invention<br>
6.1 Description of the study area<br>
One large opencast coal project was investigated for the determination of shelf life period.<br>
The opencast project was the largest project of Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL) located in the<br>
Godda District of Jharkhand. It is situated between latitudes 24 °58"39" and 25°1"37" N and<br>
longitudes 87°20"32" and 87 °23"58" E. The mining started in the year 1980. Target production of<br>
coal is lOMt/y. The total volume of overburden has been worked out as 985.15 Mm3. The life of<br>
the project is 71 years. The mineable reserve is 430.43 Mt.. The surface of excavation is about 15<br>
sq. km. The total land requirement for the project is 2177 ha out of which 1873.81 ha is<br>
agricultural land, 113.05 ha "danga" (cultivable waste) land and 110.56 ha forest land .Land to be<br>
affected by direct mining will about 67% (quarry only) . The region was mostly agricultural land<br>
(1874 ha) with a small area of wasteland (113 ha), reserved forest and sharb forest (110 ha) he<br>
agricultural activities depend on ponds and rains. The major crops cultivated in the region were<br>
paddy (Oryza sativa), sugar cane {Sacchurm officimarum) gram (Cicer arietimum). The most<br>
important aspect of the invention 17 different parameters of a specific soil samples wherein<br>
mining is done are measures. Those parameters are texture, pore space, field moisture, field<br>
capacity, water holding capacity (WHC), wilting capacity, pH, electrical conductivity(EC), cation<br>
exchange capacity (CEC), Ca,Mg,Na, K, sodium absorption ratio (SAR), organic carbon (OC),<br>
phosphorous, microbial population.<br>
6.2 Data collection methods<br>
Determination of shelf life period includes various field tests and laboratory tests. Soil<br>
samples were collected from the unmined land in and around the project areas. Ten numbers of<br>
sub samples were collected from spots, which were distributed at random covering each sampling<br>
unit. Each sub sample was taken to a uniform depth and of the same approximate volume. Twelve<br>
numbers of composite soil samples were prepared. The depth of the topsoil varied from 15 to<br>
22cm in the area. They were striped and stockpiled separately. Soil samples were also collected<br>
from six different age classes (1,3,4,6,9 and 10 years old) of mine soil dumps around the working<br>
coal mine of the opencast project, which were not vegetated.. Eight samples were collected from<br>
each dump. The sampling location sites were randomized after site facing. The mine soil dumps<br>
were having moderate to steep slope ranging in height 7 to 8 m. After the collection, soil samples<br>
were air dried at room temperature and lightly crushed with mortar pastels and passed through<br>
2mm sieve for analysis. Infiltration rates were measured by cylinder infiltrometer method. Field<br>
capacity and bulk density were measured according to standard method. The water holding<br>
capacity (WHC) and moisture content of the soils were measured by gravimetric methods. Soil<br>
pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon, available nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium<br>
were determined. The wilting coefficient was measured by plant method; cation exchange capacity<br>
(CEC) and exchangeable cations were also determined by neutral normal ammonium acetate<br>
method. The available micronutrient cations, i.e. iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu) and zinc<br>
(Zn), were extracted with diethylene- triamine penta acetic acid /calcium chloride (DTPA-Cl2)<br>
solution and analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophtometry.<br>
6.3 Data results<br>
The soil profile of unmined soil was found to be grayish in color, sub angular blocky structure, sticky<br>
and plastic with gradual smooth boundary. In different aged soil dumps these were found to be light grayish<br>
brown in color, single green structure, nonsticky and non-plastic and having many vertical tubular pores.<br>
Infiltration rates (IRs.) for unmined areas were found to be 3.12 to 0.7cm h4 After 240 min, the average IRS<br>
was 0.6cm h"1. The physical and water retention properties of unmined soil and different aged soil dumps are<br>
given in Table I. Average values for the particle size distribution were 61.2% (sand) 27.7%(Silt) as 11.1% (Clay),<br>
respectively. The bulk density of unmined soil was found to be 1.39 Mg/t. The bulk densities of soil dumps<br>
gradually increased from 1.66 Mgmt for one-year-old dumps to 1.72 Mgm3 for ten-year-old dumps. The mean<br>
value of pore space of unmined soil was found to be 47.2% for the soil dump this varied from 37.4% for a<br>
one year old dump to 35.1% for a ten year old dump. The field moisture, maximum water holding capacity %<br>
wilting capacity found to decrease along with the increase of age of the dumps.<br>
Values in parentheses represent range<br>
In unmined soil the pH value was found to be 6.38 but it was found to be decreased<br>
gradually and at 10th year it was more acidic (<ph the electrical conductivity of unmined soil></ph>
was 0.24 ds m-1 and varied for 0.36 dsm-1 (1st year) to 0.26 dsm-1 (10th year). The cation exchange<br>
capacity of the unmined soil was found to have a mean value of 11.8 cm ol (P+) Kg -1. In the soil<br>
dumps this value decreased gradually from 9.61 to 7.41 cmol (P+) Kg-1 with the increase of age.<br>
Exchangeable Ca, Mg, Na, and K levels were also found to be lower than those in unmined soils.<br>
The sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) in unmined soil was 0.14 and it was varied between 0.12 and<br>
0.15 in soil dumps. The percentage base saturation in unmined soil was found to be 76.0% and<br>
gradually decreased as the age of the soil dumps increased from 74.3 to 56.1%.<br>
6.4 A brief description of the accompanying drawings<br>
Figure 1: Variation of organic carbon in different aged soil dumps and unmined soil<br>
Figure 2: variation of available nitrogen in different aged soil dumps and unmined soil<br>
Figure 3: Variation of available phosphorous in different aged soil dumps and unmined soil<br>
Figure 4: Variation of available potassium in different aged dumps and unmined soil<br>
Figure 5: Variation of microbial population in different aged soil dumps.<br>
The variation in the organic carbon (c) content in soil dumps and unmined soils is shown<br>
in Figure. 1. The organic carbon content in unmined soil was 0.72% and the soil dumps were<br>
found to be very poor and varied from 0.38 to 0.26%. The organic carbon content levels in<br>
unmined soil decreased markedly with storage to about 47% levels in the 1-year-old dumps, about<br>
23% in the 1-6 year-old dumps and about 6% in 6-10 year old dumps.<br>
From Table 3 it will be seen that the mean value of available NPK in unmined soils were<br>
221.0 kg ha-1, 8.4 Kg ha-1 and 223.6 hg ha -1 respectively .The variation in available nitrogen (N),<br>
phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) in different aged soil dumps and unmined soils are shown in<br>
Figures.2, .3 and .4, respectively. In soil dumps NPK values were found to decrease with<br>
increasing age of the soil dumps over the ranges 151.7 to 112.5 Kg ha-1, 6.5 to 5.5 Kg ha-1 and<br>
162.0 to 121.2 kg ha,-1 respectively. In unmined soils the available Fe was found to be 28.9 mgKg-<br>
1, Mn 18.6 mg Kg-1, Cu 0.7 mg Kg-1 and Zn 0.53 mg Kg -1. The available Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn in<br>
soil dumps showed no consistent trends with the increasing age of soil dumps. The microbial<br>
population in soil dumps decreased sharply in comparison to unmined soil. In the one year aged<br>
dump, the population of bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi were found to be 5 to 8 times lower.<br>
There was a gradual decrease in population of bacteria, actimycetes and fungi from 1 to 10 year-<br>
aged dumps (Figure. 5) and at the 10th year these were 44%, 60% and 76%, respectively. The<br>
decrease was statistically significant. The clay content and the field moisture content showed<br>
strong and significant positive correlation with field capacity, water holding capacity and wilting<br>
coefficient at 1-% level (Table 4). Very high positive correlation coefficient was also observed<br>
among organic, available nitrogen and available phosphorous, while available potassium did not<br>
show strong correlation with other parameters (Table 5). Changes in microbial numbers due to the<br>
increased age of soil dumps showed a continuous decrease every year and at the end of the 6th year<br>
the number decreased to a minimum level. (Table 6).<br>

A = Actinomycetes; F= Fungi<br>
6.5 Determination of shelf life period<br>
Particle size analysis revealed that sand particles increased, silt and clay particles<br>
decreased, with respect to unmined soil. This trend may be because of increased erosion.<br>
Dominance of sand particles indicated low stability of aggregates and consequently a high rate of<br>
infiltration. The average infiltration rate was found to be intermediate in nature . The infiltration<br>
rate or water intake rate is initially high, but decrease with time. Infiltration rates also decreased,<br>
approaching a steady infiltration rate with time.<br>
The soil was medium acidic to sub-tropical climate. The high bulk density of the dumps<br>
was evidently influenced by the use of machinery. This has serious implication for subsequent<br>
change of soil properties because gaseous diffusion is made more difficult. Such high bulk density<br>
would pore restrictions on the growth of deep-rooted plants and may be one of the reasons of<br>
cessation of plant growth at the shrub stage. The porosity was found to be less than that found in<br>
unmined soil due to that found in unmined soil due to compaction during excavation and, as a<br>
result, plants cannot grow smoothly. For good plant growth, bulk density should be below 1.4-g<br>
cm-3 for clays and 1.6g cm"3 for sand. The most useful water parameters of the soil relating to plant<br>
growth, are moisture content, field capacity, water-holding capacity and the wilting coefficient<br>
that were found to be lower in the soil dump samples than those of unmined soil and decreased<br>
slightly with age due to the decrease in organic carbon. It is also reported a decrease in soil water<br>
holding capacity as a result of storage. The greater value of the wilting coefficient indicates the<br>
deficiencies of the plant growth materials. The pH of soil dumps was acidic due to leaching of<br>
basic cations. Under such acidic conditions, H-ion toxicity, high availability of Al and Mn and<br>
unavailability of Mo are the principal deterrents of plant growth. A pH range of 6.5 to 7.5 is<br>
optimum for plant nutrient availability. Electrical conductivity decreased with the increasing age<br>
of the soil dump but was higher than the surrounding unmined soils. A mixing of lower surface<br>
horizons may cause this. The action exchange capacity of soil dumps was lower than unmined<br>
soils and decreased with increasing age of the soil dumps. Again, the mixing of the lower soil<br>
horizons may cause this. Similar trends were also observed for exchangeable Ca, Mg, Na, and K.<br>
The organic carbon gradually decreased with the increasing age of soil dumps, probably<br>
due to low humification by the lake of soil micro flora. The organic carbon content levels in<br>
unmined soil decreased markedly with storage to about 47% levels in the 1-year-old, about 23% in<br>
the 1-6 year-old dumps and about 6% in 6-10 year old dumps. It appears that after 6 years the<br>
organic carbon content reached a steady state condition. The available phosphorous was much<br>
lower than the available nitrogen and potassium because most of the phosphorous present in the<br>
soil is not readily available to plants. The deficiency in nutrients was probably caused by the<br>
reduction in soil microbes induced by stockpiling and excessive leaching. Available<br>
macronutrients (NPK) decreased considerably in comparison to unmined soil and also decreased<br>
with the increasing age of the soil dumps. This may be produced by the reduction in soil microbes<br>
caused by stockpiling and excessive leaching. Available nitrogen was found to decrease rapidly in<br>
1-year-old dumps (31%), and gradually decreased in 1-6 years-old dumps (27%), reaching a<br>
stagnant condition (5%) in 6-10 years. A similarly decreasing trend was also observed for the<br>
available phosphorous content from 23% (1 year) to 6 % (6-10 years), and potassium, from 28%<br>
(1 year) to 18% (1-6 years) to 11% (6-10 years). Mn and Fe were found to increase as soil dumps<br>
aged. In dumps of a 1-6 year-old age range the available Fe was not found to be toxic to plants, but<br>
in 9-10 year-old dumps Fe concentration was toxic.<br>
Changes in microbial numbers due to the increased age of soil dumps showed a continuous<br>
decrease every year and at the end of the 6th year the number decreased to a minimum level This<br>
period up to the 6th year may be considered as the shelf life period of the topsoil in that particular<br>
area.<br>
As discussed earlier shelf life of topsoil means the time over which stored things remain usable<br>
by technical reclamation only. The change in soil quality will be drastic in the first year and it<br>
would continually deteriorate every year due to the loss of nutrients by leaching. The organic<br>
carbon and NPK values will come to a stagnant condition and will microbiologically be decreased<br>
to a minimum level. This period may be called the shelf life in that particular area. The shelf life<br>
of topsoil indicates the period over which the mine soil will maintain its sustainability for suitable<br>
plant growth without major biological reclamation.<br>
The user agencies are the different mining companies and the applications of shelf life<br>
concept are immense. The outcome of invention is that systematic handling and storage practices<br>
can protect physical and chemical properties of the topsoil. It should be stockpiled only when it is<br>
not feasible to promptly redistribute such materials on regarded areas. By critically analyzing the<br>
deterioration of soil characteristics in stockpiled soil, the shelf life period can be ascertained. It is<br>
essential to know shelf life period to choose whether biological reclamation is essential to preserve<br>
topsoil or it can be preserved by technical reclamation only.<br>
The invention identifies the reason behind the biological sterility of stockpiled soil. The<br>
adverse climatic conditions in India are also responsible for such situation in some ways. In India<br>
average rainfall is high but it is not uniformly distributed throughout the year. It falls heavily<br>
during two months of the year and the nutrients released by microbiological activity are lost<br>
entirely by leaching and erosion.<br>
It should be stockpiled only when it is not feasible to promptly redistribute on regarded areas.<br>
However, if storage is unavoidable, stockpiled topsoil should be reclaimed biologically when the<br>
redistribution of such materials over the regarded areas requires beyond the shelf life period. A<br>
prior knowledge of topsoil shelf life would enable mine planners to draw up an appropriate<br>
strategy for topsoil excavation vis-a-vis mine scheduling. An appropriate concurrent and post<br>
mining reclamation strategy can also be determined. This wills not only save time but also save<br>
money. Another important out come of this study is the development of an innovative approach<br>
for the shortening of the study period. Hopefully, the methodology adopted for the present study<br>
may have formed a guideline for the determination of shelf life period of topsoil, for systematic<br>
handling and storage practices of topsoil for mining areas and renewal of damaged for sustainable<br>
beneficial use. It is claimed that the methodology will be useful on industrial scale for various<br>
sites.<br>
