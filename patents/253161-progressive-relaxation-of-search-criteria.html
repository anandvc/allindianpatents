PROGRESSIVE RELAXATION OF SEARCH CRITERIA<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates generally to information retrieval and, more<br>
specifically, to techniques for specifying progressive relaxation of search criteria.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Applications for servicing client, or end user, queries often operate such that<br>
not only are exact matches for a user-specified query identified if they exist, but the<br>
closest non-exact matches are also identified and returned to the end user. In this context,<br>
the term "query" is not limited to a conventional database query, such as a query in SQL<br>
(Structured Query Language). Generally, a query includes any search for information<br>
through any search mechanism, such as a conventional search engine or search function.<br>
Typically, the user's search request is eventually transformed into a structured database<br>
query.<br>
[0003] One approach to servicing search requests or queries, in order to identify<br>
existing exact matches and non-exact matches, involves: (1) rewriting or reconstructing<br>
the user query to include all allowable variations of the original query; (2) retrieving a<br>
"hit-list" for the reconstructed concatenated query by submitting the query to a database<br>
server; and (3) ordering the hit-list in an order based on the relevance to the original<br>
search criteria (sometimes referred to as "relevance ranking").<br>
[0004] For example, if a user initiates a search for information on "cheap pen" on<br>
some form of information repository, such as a database or the collection of information<br>
that is accessible via the Internet, an "expanded query" is constructed to include both the<br>
original query and to include one or more sub-queries that relax the requirements of the<br>
original query. An expanded query associated with a search for "cheap pen" might<br>
include sub-queries for other allowable versions of "cheap pen," such as "cheap NEAR<br>
pen," "cheap AND pen," "$cheap AND $pen" (where "$" represents a grammatical stem<br>
operation), "cheap OR pen" and the like. A hit-list is produced based on this set of sub-<br>
queries, and the hit-list is then ordered. The ordering may be based on, for example, the<br>
specific sub-query that produced a given hit and a speculative relevance to the end user<br>
that is requesting the information.<br>
[0005] In such an approach, useless work may be performed because all of the sub-<br>
queries are executed, whether or not necessary to actually fulfill the user's request and<br>
interest. That is, the first sub-query executed may produce a sufficient number of hits or<br><br>
sufficiently relevant results to satisfy the user's interest. Furthermore, if a given sub-<br>
query is particularly unselective, it may produce many more hits than are necessary to<br>
satisfy the user's interest and unnecessary work is performed by parsing the query<br>
statement, querying the information repository, and producing and ordering the results.<br>
[0006] Another approach involves: (1) executing sub-queries associated with<br>
allowable variations of the original query, in series in descending order of priority; and<br>
(2) retrieving hits until enough hits have been located, based on some criteria. This<br>
approach involves an entity other than the database server, such as an end user or a search<br>
mechanism, issuing a query to the database server based on the original search criteria,<br>
receiving results from the query, issuing another query to the database server that expands<br>
the original search criteria, receiving results, and continuing this iterative process until the<br>
search request has been satisfied according to some quantitative criteria. Query response<br>
time and network performance suffer when using this approach due to the potential for<br>
multiple complete round-trip communications between the entity and the database server,<br>
which unnecessarily load the system. In this context, and throughout the specification, a<br>
complete round-trip communication refers to the network communication between a<br>
client entity and a database server, as well as the processing performed by the database<br>
server, which often includes: (1) parsing the query; (2) constructing a query execution<br>
plan; (3) optimizing the query execution; and the like. Secondary client-server<br>
communications refer to communications between client and server applications which do<br>
not incur the same processing overhead as complete round-trip communications.<br>
[0007] Both of the foregoing approaches are inefficient in terms of response time,<br>
processing, and network loading. Furthermore, these approaches are cumbersome for<br>
developers of search applications and mechanisms because they require such applications<br>
and mechanisms to speculatively relax the search requirements and process results with<br>
respect to relevance ranking. Furthermore, they provide limited capabilities, if any, for<br>
end users to affect the priority of search term variations in the context of relaxation of the<br>
original search criteria and, consequently, the relevance of associated results.<br>
[0008] Based on the foregoing, it is clearly desirable to provide an improved<br>
mechanism for servicing information searches. There is a more specific need to provide<br>
more control to an end user that is requesting a search for particular information to<br>
provide more efficient and more relevant performance.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0015] A method and mechanism are described for specifying progressive relaxation<br>
of search criteria. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous<br>
specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present<br>
invention. It will be apparent, however, that the present invention may be practiced<br>
without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are<br>
shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present<br>
invention.<br>
OVERVIEW<br>
[0016] In order to provide a more efficient search mechanism, control over the<br>
relaxation of a search query is provided to users that are requesting searches. Progressive<br>
relaxation of queries allows for complex queries without compromising performance.<br>
Generally, complex queries are processed to provide increased recall, or completeness, of<br>
results without compromising the precision, or quality, of the results. Through such a<br>
mechanism, a user can specify a sequence of sub-queries that is associated with variations<br>
of the main search term, and specify a progression in which to execute the sub-queries.<br>
Hence, users can impart their priorities with respect to search term variations used in<br>
relaxing the main search criteria, which further allows the users to impart their notion of<br>
the relevance of results that may be returned by particular sub-queries. Unlike prior<br><br>
approaches, the sub-queries are not all immediately and fully executed by the database<br>
server when they are received. Rather, each sub-query is only executed when the<br>
previously executed sub-query has not produced results that satisfy the user.<br>
[0017] In an embodiment, the sub-queries select data from a database based on search<br>
criteria associated with the information being requested, which may include variations of<br>
original search terms, and the progression according to which the sub-queries are<br>
executed corresponds to a progressive relaxation of the original search terms.<br>
[0018] According to one aspect, a series of sub-queries specified by a user are<br>
received at a server, for example, and executed in an order based on the progression<br>
specified by the user. Hence, multiple sub-queries may be executed by the server in<br>
response to only a single complete round-trip communication between the user/client and<br>
the server, and the server need only process a single query. Network loading and<br>
response time and are thereby improved.<br>
[0019] In an embodiment, a series of sub-queries specified by a user are received at<br>
the database server in a single round-trip communication. The server then executes the<br>
sub-queries in an order based on the progression specified by the user, however, each sub-<br>
query is executed only if the results of the previously executed sub-queries were not<br>
sufficient to fulfill the search request. For example, if the user requests a specific number<br>
of result hits, the sub-queries are executed in series until the number of requested hits<br>
have been produced, but no more sub-queries than are necessary are executed. Thus, for<br>
example, if execution of the first sub-query provides enough hits or sufficiently relevant<br>
hits to satisfy the user request, then none of the other sub-queries are executed and,<br>
consequently, computational resources are conserved. In such an embodiment, the user<br>
may specify "stop criteria" (e.g., a minimum number of hits, an amount of time, a volume<br>
of data, or a combination of such criteria) through interaction with a user interface prior to<br>
submission of a search. Once the search results satisfy the stop criteria, the database<br>
server does not execute any further sub-queries. Hence, this user-specified stop criteria<br>
approach would only require one complete round-trip communication between the client<br>
and server, and the server need only process a single query.<br>
[0020] Alternatively, the user may iteratively request more hits through interaction<br>
with a user interface, as needed to satisfy the user's interest. In this case, the user<br>
interaction is not sending a new query, but indicating that the server is to proceed to the<br>
next sub-query in the original received query. Similarly to the user-specified stop criteria<br>
approach, only one complete round-trip communication and associated processing is<br>
required. This scenario may require multiple secondary communications between the<br><br>
client and server because the server does not have knowledge of the stop criteria prior to<br>
formulation of a query execution plan. However, these secondary client-server<br>
communications are not computationally expensive, complete round-trip communications<br>
that require significant query processing overhead.<br>
[0021] Non-limiting examples of some benefits provided by the techniques described<br>
herein are (1) a reduction in network load due to a reduction in computationally expensive<br>
complete round-trip communications between a client and a server; (2) a reduction in<br>
unnecessary load on a database server due to executing queries that are not actually<br>
required to meet an end-user's needs; (3) an elimination or reduction in work from a<br>
search engine or middleware application with respect to relevance ranking processing;<br>
and (4) ease of use, by shifting work to a database server from an end user, and/or ease of<br>
application development, by shifting work to a database server from a search engine or<br>
middleware application, both with respect to construction of queries based on original<br>
search terms.<br>
OPERATING ENVIRONMENT EXAMPLE<br>
[0022] FIG. 1 is a block diagram that illustrates a simplified example of an operating<br>
environment in which an embodiment of the invention may be implemented.<br>
[0023] Embodiments comprise techniques for managing information searches, which<br>
includes managing database queries. Hence, an example of an operating environment<br>
includes a client 102, a search mechanism 104, a database server 106 and a database 108.<br>
[0024] Client 102 is a client computer software application that executes on a<br>
computing platform, such as a desktop or laptop computer, to communicate with a server<br>
computer software application, such as search mechanism 104 or database server 106.<br>
Client 102 facilitates a process in which an end user, such as a person requesting a search<br>
for information, communicates with search mechanism 104 in order to request data or<br>
information. For example, client 102 may be a conventional web browser that facilitates<br>
communication over a network, such as the Internet. Thus, client 102 may display on a<br>
display terminal various web pages, data input frames, query results, and the like. Client<br>
102 displays information or pages served from search mechanism 104.<br>
[0025] Search mechanism 104 is typically a combination of a computer software<br>
application and the computer hardware on which the application executes, such as a<br>
server computer. Search mechanism 104 provides a user interface and searching<br>
functionality to an end user using client 102. For non-limiting examples, search<br>
mechanism 104 may be what is commonly referred to as a search engine, for searching<br><br>
the Internet for information contained in web pages, or may be an interface to a more<br>
specialized information source, such as a search function on an e-commerce or corporate<br>
web page, or may be an application server.<br>
[0026] Search mechanism 104 serves as an interface between client 102 and a<br>
database server 106, and can be considered a client of database server 106. Search<br>
mechanism 104 and database server 106 can be configured together on a single<br>
computing platform and can be configured as related software modules that provide<br>
integrated functionality to client 102. Thus, search mechanism 104 and database server<br>
106 are not required to be separate entities as depicted in FIG. 1.<br>
[0027] Database server 106 provides the data requested by an application server, such<br>
as search mechanism 104, on behalf of a client 102. The database server does all of the<br>
remaining query processing not performed by the search mechanism 104 or by a user of<br>
client 102. Thus, database server 106 is a highly functional interface to a data repository,<br>
such as database 108, for managing a large amount of data in a multi-user environment.<br>
In broad terms, database server 106 accesses data in database 108 pursuant to a request.<br>
[0028] Database 108 is a collection of data treated as a unit. Generally, the purpose<br>
of a database 108 is to store and retrieve related information. Database 108 comprises<br>
some type of data storage unit or data container, such as a data table with associated rows<br>
and columns or an object class with associated objects. Database 108 typically comprises<br>
multiple other structures for storing, accessing and manipulating data, for example,<br>
indexes on tables. Embodiments do not require any specific logical or physical structure<br>
for database 108.<br>
TEXT QUERIES<br>
[0029] According to one embodiment, a CONTAINS operator is used to implement a<br>
progressive relaxation mechanism as described herein. A CONTAINS operator is used in<br>
the WHERE clause of a SELECT statement to specify a query expression for a text query.<br>
The CONTAINS operator returns a relevance score for every row selected, which is<br>
obtainable with a SCORE operator. One grammar for the CONTAINS operator is called<br>
CONTEXT. Another applicable grammar is CTXCAT. An example of a query that<br>
includes a CONTAINS operator is as follows:<br><br>
CONTAINS (<br>
[schema.]column<br>
textquery VARCHAR2<br>
[,label	NUMBER])<br>
RETURN NUMBER;<br>
where [schema.]column specifies the text column to be searched, which preferably has a<br>
text index associated therewith. The textquery parameter specifies (1) the query<br>
expression that defines the search in the column, or (2) a marked-up string that specifies a<br>
query based on the CTXCAT grammar. In specifying a query based on the CTXCAT<br>
grammar, via a query template, the query string uses the following tags:<br><query></query>, which signals that this query is to be interpreted as a query<br>
template;<br><textquery></textquery>, which specifies the query string;<br>
grammar= , which specifies the grammar of the query;<br><score></score>, which specifies the score preference; and<br>
datatype= , which specifies the type of number returned as score.<br>
[0030] For each row selected, CONTAINS returns a number between 0 and 100 that<br>
indicates how relevant the document row is to the query, with 0 indicating that no<br>
matches are found in a given row.<br>
[0031] The CONTEXT grammar is the default grammar for the CONTAINS operator<br>
and allows use of query operators in a query expression. For example, the logical<br>
operator AND allows for searching for all documents that contain two different words;<br>
the ABOUT operator allows for searching on concepts; the WITHIN operator allows for<br>
section searching, such as in sections of XML or HTML documents; and the NEAR<br>
operator allows for proximity searches, stem searches, fuzzy, and thesaural operators for<br>
expanding a query expression, or stated differently, for relaxing the search criteria<br>
associated with a query. In addition, an index on a table that stores text is typically of<br>
indextype "context", if the CONTEXT grammar is expected to be utilized for text<br>
searches.<br>
FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS<br>
[0032] FIG. 2 is a block diagram that illustrates relevant functional components of<br>
database server 106 and search mechanism 104.<br><br>
[0033] Search mechanism 104 comprises a rule interpreter 220. Rule interpreter 220<br>
operates to interpret and translate rules associated with an information search. For<br>
example, in one embodiment, which is described in more detail below, a user of client<br>
102 (FIG. 1) specifies a search term or value, referred to as search criteria, in the form of<br>
rules which are interpreted by rule interpreter 220 and translated into another format. For<br>
example, a user might provide a set of search rules such as (search terms, AND, OR),<br>
which specifies search criteria (i.e., original search terms in original form, conjunctive<br>
form of search terms; disjunctive form of search terms) and an order in which to execute<br>
related sub-queries (i.e., execute original form first, conjunctive form next, disjunctive<br>
form next).<br>
[0034] Upon receiving a set of rules, rule interpreter 220 constructs a query template<br>
based on the set of rules. According to one embodiment, the query template is in the<br>
form of a <text_query> template, as described above. According to another embodiment,<br>
the query template is in the form of a "rewrite template," which is described below. In<br>
both embodiments, the query template represents search criteria and an order in which<br>
sub-queries associated with the search criteria are to be executed.<br>
[0035] In another embodiment, rule interpreter 220 generates a relaxation query 250a<br>
based on the rules received, for submission to database Server 106. The relaxation query<br>
250a includes search criteria and an order in which constituent sub-queries associated<br>
with the search criteria are to be executed.<br>
[0036] Rule interpreter 220, or other modules within search mechanism 104, may be<br>
configured to provide other functionality to make users' interaction with database server<br>
106 user-friendly.<br>
[0037] Database server 106 functionally comprises a query relaxation engine 202 and<br>
a query execution engine 210. Query relaxation engine 202 comprises a template<br>
interpreter 204 and a query constructor 206, and query execution engine 210 comprises a<br>
context module 208.<br>
[0038} Template interpreter 204 is configured to interpret various forms of search<br>
criteria, such as query templates, that specify or otherwise represent a sequence of sub-<br>
queries and an order in which to execute the sub-queries. Template interpreter 204 passes<br>
information to query constructor 206, which processes the received information into a<br>
query. The query is executed to fetch information from database 108 (FIG. 1), possibly in<br>
conjunction with context object 208.<br>
[0039] Template interpreter 204 is configured to interpret query templates, such as<br>
what may be output from rule interpreter 220 or some other source. For example, rule<br><br>
interpreter 220 receives a set of rules from an end user and generates a query template<br>
based on those rules, which serves as a request to construct a query based on the query<br>
template. In turn, template interpreter 204 receives and interprets the query template and<br>
passes information to query constructor 206 that is necessary to construct a query<br>
according to a query language that database server 106 supports, such as SQL or PL/SQL.<br>
In one embodiment, a rewrite template is received from rule interpreter 220 and includes<br>
statements that effectively request that a query be constructed based on the set of rules.<br>
An example of a rewrite template, with respect to a search for "cheap pen", is as follows:<br><br>
where the arguments of the TRANSFORM function include a prefix associated with the<br>
search terms, a suffix associated with the search terms, and an operator related to the<br>
search terms. Thus, a prefix or suffix can be specified in association with the search<br>
terms, in addition to a relevant operator associated with the search terms, such as "&amp;"<br>
which represents logical operator "AND " or "/" which represents logical operator "OR".<br>
The prefix and suffix fields provide support for variations such as stem and wildcard<br>
searches. Hence, use of this embodiment in conjunction with rule interpreter 220<br>
pro\/ides a user-friendly capability for end users to simply provide a set of rules as input<br>
for a search, whereby through a series of processes an associated query is constructed for<br>
execution by database server 106 to fetch information from database 108 (FIG. 1).<br>
[0040] Based on the foregoing rewrite template, template interpreter 204 parses the<br>
search phrase "cheap pen" into multiple words, "cheap" and "pen", and each word is<br><br>
transformed according to the specified rules and passed to query constructor 206 for<br>
generation of a query on database 108 (FIG. 1). For example, processing of the function<br>
TRANSFORM(TOKENS,' ','$','&amp;'), with respect to the search terms "cheap pen",<br>
functions to construct a sub-query based on suffix stems of "cheap" and "pen", in the<br>
conjunctive form. Thus, a sub-query is constructed based on the REWRITE operator and<br>
the TRANSFORM function, which searches for (1) "cheaper" AND "pen"; and (2)<br>
"cheapest" AND "pen".<br>
[0041] The preceding delineation of functionality between template interpreter 204<br>
and query constructor 206 is not limiting, for these functions may be performed by an<br>
integrated interpreter 204/constructor 206 software module.<br>
[0042] Query constructor 206 receives various forms of information that define a<br>
search, such as text strings, text query templates, rewrite templates, and non-text<br>
parameters. Query constructor 206 then constructs queries from the information received,<br>
such as relaxation query 250c. Such queries are, in turn, submitted to query execution<br>
engine 210 for execution against database 108 (FIG. 1).<br>
[0043] Query execution engine 210 interfaces with and executes queries, such as<br>
relaxation queries 250a, 250b, 250c, against database 108 (FIG. 1). Query execution<br>
engine 210 comprises a context module 208 that implements the functionality of the<br>
CONTEXT grammar, when searching for text. Hence, if a CONTAINS operator is<br>
identified in the process of executing a SQL query, the CONTAINS argument text string<br>
or template is passed to the context module 208, possibly via template interpreter 204, for<br>
processing according to the functionality of the CONTEXT grammar. In addition, query<br>
execution engine 210 supports execution of a relaxation query 250b, received directly<br>
from an end user.<br>
USER-SPECIFIED PROGRESSIVE RELAXATION OF QUERY REQUIREMENTS<br>
[0044] According to an aspect of the invention, native support for progressive<br>
relaxation of database queries is provided in a database server application. Hence,<br>
applications and end-users are able to specify a sequence of sub-queries that is associated<br>
with a data search, and an order in which to execute the sub-queries to produce a desired<br>
result. Therefore, users can affect the manner and extent of the search performed to<br>
enhance the performance of the search. In addition, users can affect the quality of the<br>
relevance ranking of related results or hit-lists, without significant degradation in query<br>
response time or throughput. Such a technique improves query response time and<br><br>
throughput by reducing unnecessary query/search term expansions and computationally<br>
expensive complete round-trip communications between client and server applications.<br>
[0045] In an embodiment, capabilities are provided for a user to specify a progression<br>
sequence of sub-queries to be executed with respect to different sections of a document,<br>
such as HTML and XML documents. For example, a user may specify that a term be<br>
searched for first in the title of one or more documents and next in the body of the one or<br>
more documents and next in the description of graphic objects that appear in the one or<br>
more documents. Hence, refined search capabilities are provided.<br>
[0046] In an embodiment, a query that includes a CONTAINS clause can be issued<br>
against a database, wherein the search string is not required to adhere to conventional text<br>
query grammar. Instead, a search string may adhere to text query template format, as the<br>
following example illustrates, in which a query template is used as the query expression<br>
argument for a CONTAINS operator. The following provides an example query for<br>
searching text stored in a data table that is indexed with a context index type:<br>
SELECT * from tablename<br>
WHERE CONTAINS (columnname, 'search criteria', 1) &gt; 0.<br>
[0047] Thus, according to this embodiment, a query template is provided as the<br>
argument to the CONTAINS clause, depicted in the preceding query as the "search<br>
criteria." In such an embodiment, the following example mark-up document, or query<br>
template, can be used as an argument to a CONTAINS clause. That is, the query<br>
template is used to represent the search criteria. The query template specifies a sequence<br>
of sub-queries, i.e., probes into one or more tables, and a progressive order in which to<br>
execute the sub-queries against a specified column of a table.<br><br><br>
[0048] The preceding query and template illustrate a search on text, however, any<br>
data value or data type stored in one or more databases may be searched by applying the<br>
techniques described herein. Furthermore, the databases may be distributed and<br>
associated with multiple distributed servers, such as in the context of searching the<br>
Internet.<br>
[0049] In an alternative embodiment, the progression is implemented with SQL or<br>
PL/SQL extension operators instead of a mark-up template. For example, a<br>
PROGRESSION operator is defined as an extension to existing set of SQL operators, thus<br>
providing native database support for specification of progressions according to the<br>
techniques described herein.<br>
[0050] During execution of a query that includes a clause such as a CONTAINS<br>
clause for text or a similar clause for non-textual data, upon identification of a <query><br>
tag, the execution engine will not process the relevant portion of the query as a typical<br>
query. Rather, a database server, such as database server 106 (FIG. 1), extracts the<br>
information between the <textquery> tags, determines whether a progression is specified,<br>
such as via a <progression> tag, and executes related sub-queries in an order<br>
specified by the progression.<br>
[0051] In the example above, a sub-query would first be executed to search for<br>
documents that contain the phrase "cheap pen". Next, a sub-query could be executed to<br>
search for documents that contain both words "cheap" and "pen". Finally, a sub-query<br>
could be executed to search for documents that contain either of the words "cheap" or<br>
"pen".<br>
[0052] In one embodiment, each of the three sub-queries may be automatically run in<br>
series according to the specified progression, with the results ordered according to which<br>
sub-query produced the, given results. For example, hits returned from the first sub-query<br>
are produced or displayed with higher relevance ranking than hits returned from the<br>
second and third sub-queries.<br>
[0053] The manner in which the relevance rankings are presented is not limited. For<br>
example, the relevance ranking of the results may be identified simply by the order of<br>
presentation to the search requestor or may be assigned numerical rankings, percentages,<br>
etc. Such a scenario eliminates multiple round-trip communications between the client<br>
and the server and consequent network overhead.<br>
[0054] In an alternative embodiment, each of the sub-queries may only be executed, if<br>
at all, when the previously execute sub-queries did not fulfill the information search<br><br>
request. For example, if tens or hundreds of documents that include the phrase "cheap<br>
pen" are located by executing only the first sub-query, then execution of the remaining<br>
sub-queries is suspended or foregone completely. Thus, such a scenario eliminates<br>
multiple complete round-trip communications between the client and the server and<br>
consequent query processing and network overhead, as well as unnecessary probing.<br>
However, if the user specifically requests additional results, then the second and/or third<br>
queries can then be executed as necessary to fulfill the specific requirements of the search<br>
request. In such a scenario, subsequent client-server communications are not what is<br>
referred to above as complete round-trip communications, but are considered secondary<br>
communications because they require little or no "overhead" processing of the query,<br>
such as parsing, optimization, and the like.<br>
PROCESS FOR MANAGING AN INFORMATION SEARCH-CLIENT<br>
[0055] FIG. 3 is a flow diagram that illustrates a process for managing an information<br>
search. According to one aspect of the invention, this process is performed by an end<br>
user who is requesting an information search, typically via a user interface.<br>
[0056] At block 302, one or more information values are specified relating to<br>
information being searched for. At block 304, an order in which to execute sub-queries<br>
associated with the one or more values is specified. For example, a user may submit a<br>
query template, as described above, or a set of rules from which a query is constructed, as<br>
described above. Blocks 302 and 304 are preferably performed concurrently, however<br>
the steps may be performed in sequence. In one embodiment, the values and order are<br>
specified via a user interface, and in one embodiment, in the form of an XML document.<br>
[0057] At block 306, the one or more information values and the order are submitted<br>
for execution of one or more of the sub-queries in the order specified. This information<br>
may be submitted directly to a database server, such as database server 106 (FIG. 1), or<br>
indirectly through a middleware application such as a search engine or function.<br>
[0058] In one embodiment, an information value that is associated with one or more<br>
particular sections of a document is specified at block 302. In a related embodiment, an<br>
information value is specified at block 302 that is associated with at least two particular<br>
sections of a document, and the order specified at block 304 includes an order in which to<br>
execute sub-queries associated with the information value with respect to the at least two<br>
particular sections of the document, as previously described.<br><br>
PROCESS FOR MANAGING AN INFORMATION SEARCH-SERVER<br>
[0059] FIG. 4 is a flow diagram that illustrates a process for managing an information<br>
search. According to one aspect of the invention, this process is performed by a database<br>
server.<br>
[0060] At block 402, a query is received that includes a sequence of sub-queries and<br>
specification of a progression in which to execute the sub-queries. For example, a query<br>
that includes a CONTAINS clause for querying text is received, which includes a query<br>
template as an argument of the clause, as described above. In one embodiment, the query<br>
is received in the form of an XML document. The query that is received may, for<br>
example, include sub-queries that are associated with a particular section of a document.<br>
[0061] At block 404, one or more of the sub-queries are executed in an order<br>
specified by the progression. In one embodiment, the process includes receiving a<br>
request for a particular number of results from the search, for example, along with the<br>
query received at block 402 or iteratively from an end user or otherwise. For an example<br>
of the iterative process, an end user may request, with successive communications, query<br>
results ten at a time. Thus, a database server or search mechanism successively provides<br>
the results in response to those requests, i.e., ten at a time. Furthermore, each sub-query<br>
of the one or more sub-queries is executed only if previously executed sub-queries have<br>
not produced results sufficient to fulfill the request for the specified number of results.<br>
For example, if the first executed sub-query produces thirty results and the user is<br>
iteratively requesting hits ten at a time, then the second sub-query is not executed until the<br>
user requests the thirty-first through fortieth hits.<br>
[0062] In contrast to prior approaches using concatenated queries, all of the sub-<br>
queries are not necessarily executed. Further, in contrast with prior approaches in which<br>
each sub-query is submitted to the database server in series, the present embodiment can<br>
submit multiple sub-queries to the database server using only one complete round-trip<br>
communication between an end user that is requesting the search, such as at client 102<br>
(FIG. 1) and a server that is searching for the information, such as database server 106<br>
(FIG. 1). Control over which sub-queries are actually executed, and in what order, is<br>
provided by the end user rather than assumed by a software application and/or search<br>
engine or function, and is applied by the database server.<br>
[0063] In one embodiment, all of the sub-queries select data from a database based on<br>
a respective particular set of values, i.e., search criteria, and the progression corresponds<br>
to a relaxation of the search criteria. For example, a sub-query is constructed for each of<br>
the original search term and variations of the search term "cheap pen", using a particular<br><br>
set of values such as (1) "cheap" and "pen", (2) a stem of "cheap" and "pen", and (3)<br>
"cheap" or pen". Therefore, the search criteria "cheap pen" is progressively relaxed by<br>
executing the associated sub-queries, which expand the search, according to the specified<br>
progression.<br>
IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISM-HARDWARE OVERVIEW<br>
[0064] FIG. 5 is a block diagram that illustrates a computer system 500 upon which<br>
an embodiment of the invention may be implemented. Computer system 500 includes a<br>
bus 502 or other communication mechanism for communicating information, and a<br>
processor 504 coupled with bus 502 for processing information. Computer system 500<br>
also includes a main memory 506, such as a random access memory (RAM) or other<br>
dynamic storage device, coupled to bus 502 for storing information and instructions to be<br>
executed by processor 504. Main memory 506 also may be used for storing temporary<br>
variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions to be<br>
executed by processor 504. Computer system 500 further includes a read only memory<br>
(ROM) 508 or other static storage device coupled to bus 502 for storing static information<br>
and instructions for processor 504. A storage device 510, such as a magnetic disk, optical<br>
disk, or magneto-optical disk, is provided and coupled to bus 502 for storing information<br>
and instructions.<br>
[0065] Computer system 500 may be coupled via bus 502 to a display 512, such as a<br>
cathode ray tube (CRT) or a liquid crystal display (LCD), for displaying information to a<br>
computer user. An input device 514, including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled<br>
to bus 502 for communicating information and command selections to processor 504.<br>
Another type of user input device is cursor control 516, such as a mouse, a trackball, or<br>
cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections<br>
to processor 504 and for controlling cursor movement on display 512. This input device<br>
typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis<br>
(e.g., y), that allows the device to specify positions in a plane.<br>
[0066] The invention is related to the use of computer system 500 for implementing<br>
the techniques described herein. According to one embodiment of the invention, those<br>
techniques are performed by computer system 500 in response to processor 504 executing<br>
one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in main memory 506. Such<br>
instructions may be read into main memory 506 from another computer-readable<br>
medium, such as storage device 510. Execution of the sequences of instructions<br>
contained in main memory 506 causes processor 504 to perform the process steps<br><br>
described herein. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place<br>
of or in combination with software instructions to implement the invention. Thus,<br>
embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware<br>
circuitry and software.<br>
[0067] The term "computer-readable medium" as used herein refers to any medium<br>
that participates in providing instructions to processor 504 for execution. Such a medium<br>
may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media,<br>
and transmission media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical, magnetic, or<br>
magneto-optical disks, such as storage device 510. Volatile media includes dynamic<br>
memory, such as main memory 506. Transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper<br>
wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus 502. Transmission media can<br>
also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio-wave<br>
and infra-red data communications.<br>
[0068] Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy<br>
disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium, a CD-<br>
ROM, DVD, any other optical or magneto-optical medium, punchcards, papertape, any<br>
other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-<br>
EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave as described hereinafter, or<br>
any other medium from which a computer can read.<br>
[0069] Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or<br>
more sequences of one or more instructions to processor 504 for execution. For example,<br>
the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. The<br>
remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the<br>
instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer system<br>
500 can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infra-red transmitter to convert<br>
the data to an infra-red signal. An infra-red detector can receive the data carried in the<br>
infra-red signal and appropriate circuitry can place the data on bus 502. Bus 502 carries<br>
the data to main memory 506, from which processor 504 retrieves and executes the<br>
instructions. The instructions received by main memory 506 may optionally be stored on<br>
storage device 510 either before or after execution by processor 504.<br>
[0070] Computer system 500 also includes a communication interface 518 coupled to<br>
bus 502. Communication interface 518 provides a two-way data communication coupling<br>
to a network link 520 that is connected to a local network 522. For example,<br>
communication interface 518 may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card<br>
or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of<br><br>
telephone line. As another example, communication interface 518 may be a local area<br>
network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN.<br>
Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication<br>
interface 518 sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry<br>
digital data streams representing various types of information.<br>
[0071] Network link 520 typically provides data communication through one or more<br>
networks to other data devices. For example, network link 520 may provide a connection<br>
through local network 522 to a host computer 524 or to data equipment operated by an<br>
Internet Service Provider (ISP) 526. ISP 526 in turn provides data communication<br>
services through the world wide packet data communication network now commonly<br>
referred to as the "Internet" 528. Local network 522 and Internet 528 both use electrical,<br>
electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the<br>
various networks and the signals on network link 520 and through communication<br>
interface 518, which carry the digital data to and from computer system 500, are<br>
exemplary forms of carrier waves transporting the information.<br>
[0072] Computer system 500 can send messages and receive data, including program<br>
code, through the network(s), network link 520 and communication interface 518. In the<br>
Internet example, a server 530 might transmit a requested code for an application program<br>
through Internet 528, ISP 526, local network 522 and communication interface 518.<br>
[0073] The received code may be executed by processor 504 as it is received, and/or<br>
stored in storage device 510, or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this<br>
manner, computer system 500 may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.<br>
