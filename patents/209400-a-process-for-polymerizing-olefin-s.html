COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 ; rule 13]]<br>
"A PROCESS FOR POLYMERIZING OLEFIN(S)"<br>
UNIVATION TECHNOLOGIES LLC, a Delaware company of Suite 1950, 5555 San Felipe, Houston, Texas 77056, United States of America.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a catalyst composition including a Group 15 containing metal compound, and to a mixed catalyst composition including at least two metal compounds. Preferably, at least one of the metal compounds of the mixed composition is the Group 15 containing metal compound. More preferably, the other metal compound is a bulky ligand metallocene catalyst compound. The present invention also relates to catalyst systems utilizing the catalyst compositions, and to their use in olefin(s) polymerization. The present invention further relates to a new polyolefin, generally polyethylene, particularly a multimodal polymer and more specifically, a bimodal polymer, and its use in various end-use applications such as film, molding and pipe.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Advances in polymerization and catalysis have resulted in the capability to produce many new polymers having improved physical and chemical properties useful in a wide variety of superior products and applications. With the development of new catalysts, the choice of polymerization-type (solution, slurry, high pressure or gas phase), for producing a particular polymer, has been greatly expanded. Also, advances in polymerization technology have provided more efficient, highly productive and economically enhanced processes. Especially illustrative of these advances is the development of technology utilizing bulky ligand metallocene catalyst systems.<br>
More recently, developments have lead to the discovery of anionic, multidentate heteroatom ligands as discussed by the following articles: (1) Kempe et al., "Aminopyridinato Ligands - New Directions and Limitations", 80th Canadian Society for Chemistry Meeting, Windsor, Ontario, Canada, June 1-4,1997; (2) Kempe et al., Inorg.

F., Organometallics 1997,16, 3282); (4) Horton, et.al„ "Cationic Alkylzirconium Complexes Based on a Tridentate Diamide Ligand: New Alkene Polymerization Catalysts", Organometallics, 1996, 15,2672-2674 relates to tridentate<br><br>

Furthermore, U.S. Patent No. 5,576,460 describes a preparation of arylamine ligands and U.S. Patent No. 5,889,128 discloses a process for the living polymerization of olefins using initiators having a metal atom and a ligand having two group 15 atoms and a group 16 atom or three group 15 atoms. EP 893 454 Al also describes preferably titanium transition metal amide compounds. In addition, U.S. Patent No. 5,318,935 discusses amido transition metal compounds and catalyst systems especially for the producing isotactic polypropylene. Polymerization catalysts containing bidentate and tridentate ligands are further discussed in U.S. Patent No. 5,506,184.<br>
Traditional bulky ligand metallocene catalyst systems produce polymers that are in some situations more difficult to process into film, for example using old extrusion equipment. One technique to improve these polymers is to blend them with other polymers with the intent to create a blend having the desired properties that each component individually would have. While the two polymer blends tend to be more processable, it is expensive and adds a cumbersome blending step to the manufacturing/fabrication process.<br>
Higher molecular weight confers desirable polymer mechanical properties and stable bubble formation in the production of films. However, this property also inhibits extrusion processing by increasing backpressure in extruders, promotes melt fracture defects in the inflating bubble and potentially, promotes too high a degree of orientation in the finished film. The anionic, multidentate heteroatom containing catalyst systems tend to produce a<br><br>
very high molecular weight polymer. To remedy this, one may form a secondary, minor component of lower molecular weight polymer to reduce extruder backpressure and inhibit melt fracture. Several industrial processes operate on this principle using multiple reactor technology to produce a processable bimodal molecular weight distribution (MWD) high density polyethylene (HDPE) product. HIZEX™, a Mitsui Chemicals HDPE product, is considered the worldwide standard. HIZEX™ is produced in a costly two or more reactor process. In a multiple reactor process, each reactor produces a single component of the final product.<br>
Others in the art have tried to produce two polymers together at the same time in the same reactor using two different catalysts. PCT patent application WO 99/03899 discloses using a typical bulky ligand metallocene catalyst and a conventional-type Ziegler-Natta catalyst in the same reactor to produce a bimodal. polyolefin. Using two different types of catalysts, however, result in a polymer whose characteristics cannot be predicted from those of the polymers that each catalyst would produce if utilized separately. This unpredictability occurs, for example, from competition or other influence between the catalyst or catalyst systems used.<br>
Polyethylenes with a higher density and a higher molecular weight are valued in film applications requiring high stiffness, good toughness and high throughput. Such polymers .are also valued in pipe applications requiring stiffness, toughness and long-term durability, and particularly resistance to environmental stress cracking.<br>
Thus, there is a desire for an improved catalyst compound and for a combination of catalysts capable of producing processable polyethylene polymers, preferably in a single reactor having desirable combinations of processing, mechanical and optical properties.<br>

The use of the terms halogenated or halogenation means for the purposes of this application that at least one third of hydrogen atoms on carbon atoms of the aryl-substituted aromatic ligands are replaced by halogen atoms, and more preferred that the aromatic ligands be perhalogenated. Fluorine is the most preferred halogen.<br>

There are various other methods in the art for supporting the polymerization catalyst compound or the mixed catalyst system of the invention. For example, the Group 15 containing catalyst compounds and/or the mixed catalyst system including the bulky ligand metallocene catalyst compounds may contain a polymer bound ligand as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,473,202 and 5,770,755, which is herein fully incorporated by reference; the Group 15 containing catalyst compounds and/or the bulky ligand metallocene catalyst compounds of the invention may be spray dried as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,648,310, which is herein fully incorporated by reference; the support used with the Group 15 containing metal catalyst compounds and/or the bulky ligand metallocene catalyst compounds of the invention may be functionalized as described in European publication EP-A-0 802 203, which is herein fully incorporated by reference, or at least one substituent or leaving group is selected as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,688,880, which is herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides for a Group 15 containing catalyst system and/or a mixed system including the bulky ligand metallocene catalyst compounds, which include a surface modifier that is used in the preparation of the supported catalyst system as described in PGT publication WO 96/11960, which is herein fully incorporated by reference. The catalyst systems of the invention can be prepared in the presence of an olefin, for example hexene-1.<br>
In another embodiment, the Group 15 containing hafnium catalyst system and the mixed system including the bulky ligand metallocene catalyst compound can be combined with a carboxylic acid salt of a metal ester, for example aluminum carboxylates such as aluminum mono, di- and tri- stearates, aluminum octoates, oleates and cyclohexylbutyrates, as described in U.S. Application Serial No. 09/113,216, filed July 10,1998.<br>
A method for producing a supported Group 15 containing catalyst system and/or the bulky ligand metallocene catalyst system is described below and is described in U.S. Application Serial Nos. 265,533, filed June 24,1994 and 265,532, filed June 24,1994 and PCT publications WO 96/00245 and WO 96/00243 both published January 4, 1996, all of which are herein fully incorporated by reference. This procedure is used either with the Group 15 containing catalyst compounds together with or separately from the bulky ligand metallocene catalyst compounds. In this method, the catalyst compound or compounds are slurried in a liquid to form a solution and a separate solution is formed containing an activator and a liquid. The liquid may be any compatible solvent or other liquid capable of forming a<br><br>
solution or the like with the catalyst compound or compounds and/or activator of the invention. In a preferred embodiment the liquid is a cyclic aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon, most preferably toluene. The catalyst compound or compounds and activator solutions are mixed together and added to a porous support such that the total volume of the catalyst compound or compounds solution and the activator solution or the catalyst compound or compounds solution and activator solution is less than four times the pore volume of the porous support, more preferably less than three times, even more preferably less than two times; preferred ranges being from 1.1 times to 3.5 times range and most preferably in the 1.2 to 3 times range.<br>
Procedures for measuring the total pore volume of a porous support are well known in the art. Details of one of these procedures is discussed in Volume 1, Experimental Methods in Catalytic Research (Academic Press, 1968) (specifically see pages 67-96). This preferred procedure involves the use of a classical BET apparatus for nitrogen absorption. Another method well known in the art is described in Innes, Total Porosity and Particle Density of Fluid Catalysts By Liquid Titration, Vol. 28, No. 3, Analytical Chemistry 332-334 (March, 1956).<br>
Other methods for supporting the catalyst compounds of the invention are described in U.S. Application Serial Number 09/312,878, filed May 17,1999, which is fully incorporated herein by reference.<br>
When used in a mixed catalyst system, the Group 15 catalyst compound and the bulky ligand metallocene catalyst compound of the invention are combined at molar ratios of 1:1000 to 1000:1, preferably 1:99 to 99:1, preferably 10:90 to 90:10, more preferably 20:80 to 80:20, more preferably 30:70 to 70:30, more preferably 40:60 to 60:40.<br>
In one embodiment of the mixed system of the invention, particularly in a slurry polymerization process, the loading of the total of Group 15 containing compound and the bulky ligand metallocene catalyst compound in ummol per gram (g) of finished supported catalyst (includes the support material, the mixed catalysts and the activator) is about 40 ummol per gram, preferably about 38 uinmol/g.<br>
In another embodiment, particularly in a gas phase polymerization process utilizing the mixed system of the invention, the loading of the total of Group 15 containing compound and the bulky ligand metallocene catalyst compound in ummol per gram of finished supported catalyst (includes the support material, the mixed catalysts and the activator) is less than 30 ummol per gram, preferably less than 25 u^mmol/g, more preferably less than 20 ummol/gram.<br><br>
In another embodiment, the R group in formula (VII) above, or ligand, may be<br>
covalently bonded to a support material, preferably a metal/metalloid oxide or polymeric<br>
support. Lewis base-containing support materials or substrates will react with the Lewis acid<br>
activators to form a support bonded Lewis acid compound, a supported activator, where one<br>
R group of RnAl(ArHal)3.n is covalently bonded to the support material. For example, where<br>
the support material is silica, the Lewis base hydroxyl groups of the silica is where this<br>
method of bonding at one of the aluminum coordination sites occurs. Preferably, in this<br>
embodiment, the support material is a metal or metalloid oxide, preferably having surface hydroxyl groups exhibiting a pKa equal to or less than that observed for amorphous silica,<br>
i.e., pKa less than or equal to about 11.<br>
While not wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is believed that the covalently bound anionic activator, the Lewis acid, is believed to form initially a dative complex with a silanol group, for example of silica (which acts as a Lewis base), thus forming a formally dipolar (zwitterionic) Bronsted acid structure bound to the metal/metalloid of the metal oxide support. Thereafter, the proton of the Bronsted acid appears to protonate an R-group of the Lewis acid, abstracting it, at which time the Lewis acid becomes covalently bonded to the oxygen atom. The replacement R group of the Lewis acid then becomes R'-O-, where R' is a suitable support material or substrate, for example, silica or hydroxyl group-containing polymeric support. Any support material that contain surface hydroxyl groups are suitable for use in this particular supporting method. Other support material include glass beads.<br>
In this embodiment, where the support material is a.metal oxide composition, these<br>
compositions may additionally contain oxides of other metals, such as those of Al, K, Mg,<br>
Na, Si, Ti and Zr and should preferably be treated by thermal and/or chemical means to<br>
remove water and free oxygen. Typically such treatment is in a vacuum in a heated oven, in<br>
a heated fluidized bed or with dehydrating agents such as organo silanes, siloxanes, alkyl<br>
aluminum compounds, etc. The level of treatment should be such that as much retained<br>
moisture and oxygen as is possible is removed, but that a chemically significant amount of<br>
hydroxyl functionality is retained. Thus calcining at up to 800 °C or more up to a point prior<br>
to decomposition of the support material, for several hours is permissible, and if higher<br>
loading of supported anionic activator is desired, lower calcining temperatures for lesser<br>
times will be suitable. Where the metal oxide is silica, loadings to achieve from less than 0.1 mmol to 3.0 mmol activator/g SiC&gt;2 are typically suitable and can be achieved, for example,<br>
by varying the temperature of calcining from 200 to 800+ °C. See Zhuralev, et al, Langmuir<br><br>
1987, Vol. 3, 316 where correlation between calcining temperature and times and hydroxyl contents of silica's of varying surface areas is described.<br>
The tailoring of hydroxyl groups available as attachment sites can also be accomplished by the pre-treatment, prior to addition of the Lewis acid, with a less than stoichiometric amount of the chemical dehydrating agents. Preferably those used will be used sparingly and will be those having a single ligand reactive with the silanol groups (e.g., (CH3)3SiCl), or otherwise hydrolyzable, so as to minimize interference with the reaction of<br>
the transition metal catalyst compounds with the bound activator. If calcining temperatures below 400 °C are employed, difunctional coupling agents (e.g., (CH3)2SiCl2) may be<br>
employed to cap hydrogen bonded pairs of silanol groups which are present under the less severe calcining conditions. See for example, "Investigation of Quantitative SiOH Determination by the Silane Treatment of Disperse Silica", Gorski, et al, Journ. of Colloid and Interface Science, Vol. 126, No. 2, Dec. 1988, for discussion of the effect of silane coupling agents for silica polymeric fillers that will also be effective for modification of silanol groups on the catalyst supports of this invention. Similarly, use of the Lewis acid in excess of the stoichiometric amount needed for reaction with the transition metal compounds will serve to neutralize excess silanol groups without significant detrimental effect for catalyst preparation or subsequent polymerization.<br>
Polymeric supports are preferably hydroxyl-functional-group-containing polymeric substrates, but functional groups may be any of the primary alkyl amines, secondary alkyl amines, and others, where the groups are structurally incorporated in a polymeric chain and capable of a acid-base reaction with the Lewis acid such that a ligand filling one coordination site of the aluminum is protonated and replaced by the polymer incorporated functionality. See, for example, the functional group containing polymers of U.S. Patent No. 5,288,677, which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Other supports include silica, alumina, silica-alumina, magnesia, titania, zirconia,<br>
magnesium chloride, montmorillonite, phyllosilicate, zeolites, talc, clays, silica-chromium,<br>
silica-alumina, silica-titania, porous acrylic polymers.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, olefin(s), preferably C2 to C30 olefin(s) or<br>
alpha-olefin(s), preferably ethylene or propylene or combinations thereof are prepolymerized in the presence of a supported Group 15 containing metal catalyst and/or the bulky ligand metallocene catalyst of the invention prior to the main polymerization. The prepolymerization can be carried out batchwise or continuously in gas, solution or slurry phase including at elevated pressures. The prepolymerization can take place with any olefin monomer or combination and/or in the presence of any molecular weight controlling agent<br><br>
—such as hydrogen. For examples of prepolymerization procedures, see U.S. Patent Nos. 4,748,221, 4,789,359, 4,923,833, 4,921,825, 5,283,278 and 5,705,578 and European publication EP-B-0279 863 and PCT Publication WO 97/44371 all of which are herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>
Solution Feed of Group 15 Metal Containing Compound<br>
In another embodiment, the Group 15 containing metal catalyst compound of the invention and the activator are introduced into a slurry or gas phase reactor in a liquid carrier, preferably in a solution.

Preferred liquid carriers include alkanes, preferably pentane, hexane, isopentane, toluene, cyclohexane, isopentane, heptane, octane, isohexane and the like. Particularly preferred liquid carriers include hexane, pentane, isopentane and toluene.<br>

In one embodiment a solution of the activated metal compounds in an alkane such as pentane, hexane, toluene, isopentane or the like is introduced into a gas phase or slurry phase reactor.   In another embodiment the catalyst system or the components can be introduced into the reactor in a suspension or an emulsion. In one embodiment, the transition metal compound is contacted with the activator, such as modified methylalumoxane, in a solvent and just before the solution is fed into a gas or slurry phase reactor. In another embodiment a solution of the metal compound is combined with a solution of the activator, allowed to react for a period of time then introduced into the reactor. In a preferred embodiment, the catalyst and activator are allowed to reactor for at least 1 second, preferably at least 5 minutes even more preferably between 5 and 60 minutes, before being introduced into the reactor. The catalyst and activator are typically present at a concentration of 0.0001 to 0.200 mo 1/1 in the solutions, preferably 0.001 to 0.05 mol/1, more preferably 0.005 to 0.025 mol/1. In general the metal compound and the activator are combined in ratios of about 1000:1 to about 0.5:1. In a preferred embodiment the metal compound and the activator are combined in a ratio of about 300:1 to about 1:1, preferably about 10:1 to about 1:1, for boranes the ratio is preferably about 1:1 to about 10:1<br><br>
rand for alkyl aluminum compounds (such as diethylaluminum chloride combined with water) the ratio is preferably about 0.5:1 to about 10:1.<br>
In another embodiment, the catalyst system consists of the transition metal compound (catalyst) and/or the activator (cocatalyst) which are preferably introduced into the reactor in solution. Solutions of the metal compounds are prepared by taking the catalyst and dissolving it in any solvent such as an alkane, toluene, xylene, etc. The solvent may first be purified in order to remove any poisons which may affect the catalyst activity, including any trace water andVor oxygenated compounds. Purification of the solvent may be accomplished by using activated alumina and activated supported copper catalyst, for example. The catalyst is preferably completely dissolved into the solution to form a homogeneous solution. Both catalyst and the activator may be dissolved into the same solvent, if desired. Once the catalysts are in solution, they may be stored until use.<br>
For polymerization, it preferred that the catalyst is combined with an activator prior to injection into the reactor. Additionally, other solvents and reactants can be added to the catalyst solutions (on-line or off-line), to the activator (on-line or off-line), or to the activated catalyst or catalysts.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the catalyst systems of this invention have a productivity of 10,000 grams of polymer per gram of catalyst per hour or more.<br>
The solution fed catalyst system of this invention described above has excellent operability over a wide range of reactor conditions and resin grades from 0.2 dg/min Flow Index to 3 dg/min Melt Index and 0.950 g/cc to 0.916 g/cc density. The catalyst system did not experience any resin agglomeration or sheeting in over 10 days of continuous pilot scale operation. This invention also has the benefit of little or no fouling. No sheets, chunks or rubble were observed during or after the polymerization process. There was no trace of polymer build-up on the inside of the reactor walls or in the recycle gas line. Also, there was no increase in the pressure drop across the heat exchanger, cycle gas compressor or gas distribution plate during the entire run.<br>
Solution Feed of Mixed Catalyst Systems<br>
In a another embodiment, the mixed catalyst systems of the invention and/or the activator (cocatalyst) are introduced into the reactor in solution. Solutions of the metal<br><br>
_ compounds are prepared by taking the catalyst and dissolving it in any suitable solvent such as an alkane, toluene, xylene, etc. The solvent may first be purified in order to remove any poisons, which may affect the catalyst activity, including any trace water and/or oxygenated compounds. Purification of the solvent may be accomplished by using activated alumina and activated supported copper catalyst. The catalyst is preferably completely dissolved into the solution to form a homogeneous solution. Both catalysts may be dissolved into the same solvent, if desired. Once the catalysts are in solution, they may be stored indefinitely until use.<br>
For polymerization, it preferred that the catalyst is combined with an activator prior to introduction into the reactor. Additionally, other solvents and reactants can be added to the catalyst solutions (on-line or off-line), to the activator (on-line or off-line), or to the activated catalyst or catalysts. See U.S. Patent Nos. 5,317,036 and 5,693,727, EP-A-0 593 083, and WO 97/46599 which are folly incorporated herein by reference, that describe solution feed systems to a reactor. There are many different configurations which are possible to combine the catalysts and activator.<br>
The catalyst systems, the metal compounds and/or the activator(s) may be introduced into the reactor in one or more solutions. The metal compounds may be activated independently, in series or together. In one embodiment, a solution of the two activated metal compounds in an alkane such as pentane, hexane, toluene, isopentane or the like is introduced into a gas phase or slurry phase reactor.   In another embodiment the catalysts system or the components can be introduced into the reactor in a suspension or an emulsion. In another embodiment, the second metal compound is contacted with the activator, such as modified methylalumoxane, in a solvent and just before the solution is fed into a gas, slurry or solution phase reactor. A solution of the Group 15 containing metal compound is combined with a solution of the second compound and the activator and then introduced into the reactor.<br>

Preferably a copolymer of ethylene is produced, where the comonomer is at least one alpha-olefin having from 4 to 15 carbon atoms, preferably from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, more preferably from 4 to 8 carbon atoms and most preferably from 4 to 7 carbon atoms. In an alternate embodiment, the geminally disubstituted olefins disclosed in WO 98/37109 may be polymerized or copolymerized using the invention herein described.<br>

Typically in a gas phase polymerization process a continuous cycle is employed where in one part of the cycle of a reactor system, a cycling gas stream, otherwise known as a recycle stream or fluidizing medium, is heated in the reactor by the heat of polymerization. This heat is removed from the recycle composition in another part of the cycle by a cooling system external to the reactor. Generally, in a gas fluidized bed process for producing polymers, a gaseous stream containing one or more monomers is continuously cycled through a fluidized bed in the presence of a catalyst under reactive conditions. The gaseous stream is withdrawn from the fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product is withdrawn from the reactor and fresh monomer is added to replace the polymerized monomer. (See for example U.S. Patent Nos. 4,543,399,4,588,790, 5,028,670, 5,317,036, 5,352,749, 5,405,922, 5,436,304, 5,453,471, 5,462,999, 5,616,661 and 5,668,228 all of which are fully incorporated herein by reference.)<br><br>
The reactor pressure in a gas phase process may vary from about 10 psig (69 kPa) to about 500 psig (3448 kPa), preferably in the range of from about 100 psig (690 kPa) to about 400 psig (2759 kPa), preferably in the range of from about 200 psig (1379 kPa) to about 400 psig (2759 kPa), more preferably in the range of from about 250 psig (1724 kPa) to about 350 psig (2414 kPa).<br>
The reactor temperature in the gas phase process may vary from about 30°C to about 120°C, preferably from about 60°C to about 115°C, more preferably in the range of from about 75°C to 110°C, and most preferably in the range of from about 85°C to about 110°C. Altering the polymerization temperature can also be used as a tool to alter the final polymer product properties.<br>
The productivity of the catalyst or catalyst system is influenced by the main monomer partial pressure. The preferred mole percent of the main monomer, ethylene or propylene, preferably ethylene, is from about 25 to 90 mole percent and the monomer partial pressure is in the range of from about 75 psia (517 kPa) to about 300 psia (2069 kPa), which are typical conditions in a gas phase polymerization process. In one embodiment the ethylene partial pressure is about 220 to 240 psi (1517 to 1653 kPa). In another embodiment the molar ratio of hexene to ethylene ins the reactor is 0.03:1 to 0.08:1.<br>
In another embodiment, the reactor utilized in the present invention and the process of the invention produce greater than 500 lbs of polymer per hour (227 Kg/hr) to about 200,000 lbs/hr (90,900 Kg/hr) or higher of polymer, preferably greater than 1000 lbs/hr (455 Kg/hr), more preferably greater than 10,000 lbs/hr (4540 Kg/hr), even more preferably greater than 25,000 lbs/hr (11,300 Kg/hr), still more preferably greater than 35,000 lbs/hr (15,900 Kg/hr), still even more preferably greater than 50,000 lbs/hr (22,700 Kg/hr) and most preferably greater than 65,000 lbs/hr (29,000 Kg/hr) to greater than 100,000 lbs/hr (45,500 Kg/hr).<br>
Other gas phase processes contemplated by the process of the invention include those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,627,242, 5,665,818 and 5,677,375, and European publications EP-A- 0 794 200, EP-A- 0 802 202 and EP-B. 634 421 all of which are herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>
A slurry polymerization process generally uses pressures in the range of from about 1 to about 50 atmospheres and even greater and temperatures in the range of 0°C to about 120°<br><br>
fc. In a slurry polymerization, a suspension of solid, particulate polymer is formed in a liquid polymerization diluent medium to which ethylene and comonomers and often hydrogen along with catalyst are added. The suspension including diluent is intermittently or continuously removed from the reactor where the volatile components are separated from the polymer and recycled, optionally after a distillation, to the reactor. The liquid diluent employed in the polymerization medium is typically an alkane having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, preferably a branched alkane. The medium employed should be liquid under the conditions of polymerization and relatively inert. When a propane medium is used the process must be operated above the reaction diluent critical temperature and pressure. Preferably, a hexane or an isobutane medium is employed.<br>
In one embodiment, a preferred polymerization technique of the invention is referred to as a particle form polymerization, or a slurry process where the temperature is kept below the temperature at which the polymer goes into solution. Such technique is well known in the art, and described in for instance U.S. Patent No. 3,248,179 which is fully incorporated herein by reference. The preferred temperature in the particle form process is within the range of about 185°F (85°C) to about 23,0°F (110°C). Two preferred polymerization methods for the slurry process are those employing a loop reactor and those utilizing a plurality of stirred reactors in series, parallel, or combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of slurry processes include continuous loop or stirred tank processes. Also, other examples of slurry processes are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,613,484, which is herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>
In another embodiment, the slurry process is carried out continuously in a loop reactor. The catalyst as a solution, as a suspension, as an emulsion, as a slurry in isobutane or as a dry free flowing powder is injected regularly to the reactor loop, which is itself filled with circulating slurry of growing polymer particles in a diluent of isobutane containing monomer and comonomer. Hydrogen, optionally, may be added as a molecular weight control. The reactor is maintained at pressure of about 525 psig to 625 psig (3620 kPa to 4309 kPa) and at a temperature in the range of about 140 °F to about 220 °F (about 60 °C to about 104 °C) depending on the desired polymer density. Reaction heat is removed through the loop wall since much of the reactor is in the form of a double-jacketed pipe. The slurry is<br><br>
allowed to exit the reactor at regular intervals or continuously to a heated low pressure flash vessel, rotary dryer and a nitrogen purge column in sequence for removal of the isobutane diluent and all unreacted monomer and comonomers. The resulting hydrocarbon free powder is then compounded for use in various applications.<br>

Section I - Comparative Examples 1 and 2 give experimental data on how the single component catalyst system behave. Examples 3 and 4 demonstrate the effect of temperature on essentially the same reactor conditions and catalyst feed system.   Note that at higher temperature, the Mw/Mn is lower, as is the MFR. Examples 5 and 6 compare the effect of 5     activation scheme for essentially the same reactor conditions and catalyst feed system. Note that in Example 6, the overall activity of the catalyst is better. However, the amount of high molecular weight material produced is lower. Examples 6 and 7 demonstrate the ability to control the amount of high molecular weight material produced at essentially similar reactor conditions. Example 7 fed a higher percentage of Catalyst A feed, hence a higher quantity of 10     higher Mw material was produced.<br>

Thus prepared pellets were film extruded on a 50mm Alpine blown film line which is equipped with an extruder with 50mm single screw (18:1 L/D ratio) and 100mm annular die with 1 mm die gap. The extrusion conditions were: 400 ° F (204° C) die temperature, output rate-100 lb/hr (46kg/hr). A typical set temperature profile was: 380°F/400oF/400oF/400oF/400oF/400°F/410°F/410°F (193°C/204oC/204oC/204oC/204°C/ 204°C/210°C/210°C) for Barrell/ Barrel2/Block adaptor/Bottom adaptor/Verical adaptor/Die bottom/Die middle/Die top. The pellet samples were extruded to produce 1.0 mil (25p.m) film sample at the line speed of 92 fpm (48 cm/sec) and 0.5 mil (13 p.m) film sample at the line speed of 184 fpm (94 cm/sec) at the blow-up ratio (BUR) of 4.0. For both cases the bubble showed excellent stability with a typical "necked-in" wine glass shape. The FLH (frost line height) of blown bubble was maintained at 36 inches (91.4cm) and 40 inches (101.6cm), respectively for 1.0 mil (25 pm) and 0.5 mil (12.5 p.m) film. The extrusion head pressure and motor load exhibited slightly higher than ESCORENE™ HD7755.10 ( a conventional series reactor product of Exxon Chemical Company in Mt Belvue Texas) at the same extrusion conditions. The resultant film properties are reported in Table IB. All the film samples were conditioned at to 23°C, 50% humidity for 40 hours. Dart impact strength of 0.5 mil (12.5 urn) film exhibited 380g, which exceeded that of ESCORENE™ HD7755.10 which showed 330g.<br><br>

In addition to the examples above, other variations on polymerizing using the catalyst systems described herein include:<br>
1.	Compound I could be dissolved in a solvent, preferably toluene to form the desired weight % solution then used in combination with other catalyst systems.<br>
2.	Catalyst A could be used as a 0.50 weight % solution in toluene and Catalyst B could be used as a 0.25 weight % solution in hexane at molar ratios of B to A of about 0.7 when the two are activated separately then mixed together (parallel activation) or at molar ratios of B to A of 2.2 to 1.5 when A is activated then B is added (sequential activation).<br>
3.	Raising or lowering the reaction temperature to narrow or broaden the Mw/Mn, respectively.<br>
4.	Changing residence time to affect product properties. Large changes can have significant impact.   One to five, preferably four hours residence time appears to produce good product properties,<br>
5.	Spraying the catalyst into the reactor in such a way as to create a particle lean zone. A particle lean zone can be created by a 50,000 lb/hr flow of cycle gas through 6 inch pipe. The catalyst can be atomized w/ a spray nozzle using nitrogen atomizing gas.<br>
6.	The activator, preferably MMAO 3 A can be used at 7 weight % al in isopentane, hexane or heptane at feed rate sufficient to give an Al/Zr ratio of 100 to 300.<br>
7.	Catalyst A is mixed on-line with MMAO 3 A then Catalyst B is added orf line, then the mixture is introduced into the reactor.<br>
