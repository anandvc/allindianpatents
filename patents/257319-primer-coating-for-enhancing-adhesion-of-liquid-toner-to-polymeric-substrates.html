PRIMER COATING FOR ENHANCING ADHESION OF LIQUID TONER TO<br>
POLYMERIC SUBSTRATES<br>
This invention relates to a primer coating for use on polymeric substrates, and more<br>
particularly, to a primer coating for enhancing the adhesion of liquid toner to polymeric<br>
films which are designed to be printed using an electrophotographic printing device.<br>
In recent years, the use of on-demand digital printing machines utilizing liquid<br>
electrophotographic systems has become widespread. In such systems, liquid toner images<br>
are formed on a photosensitive drum and then electrically transferred onto an intermediate<br>
transfer blanket or belt for printing on a paper or polymeric film sheet or web. An example<br>
of a liquid toner for use in electrostatic printers is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,407,771,<br>
and printers using such liquid toner are commercially available from Hewlett-Packard<br>
Company under the trade name HP Indigo. Polymeric films are often preferred for use over<br>
paper in electrostatic imaging because they are moisture resistant, flexible, and can be clear<br>
or opaque. However, liquid toners do not transfer well and/or adhere well to such films or<br>
paper substrates unless they have been treated with a coating or primer (also referred to as<br>
"optimized") to enhanced the adhesion of liquid toners. A number of coatings or primers<br>
have been developed for use on substrates such as polymeric films which render the surface<br>
of the films more receptive to liquid toners. For example, a polyamide resin in solution is<br>
known for use on such polymeric films. However, because the polyamide is dissolved in a<br>
solvent, this can lead to environmental problems when the solvent is evaporated, hi<br>
addition, the solution is difficult to handle at low temperatures, as the polyamide tends to<br>
lose solubility. The coating also has a limited shelf life in storage prior to printing.<br>
Other coatings have been developed based on ethylene-acrylic acid copolymers. As<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,789,123, an ethylene-acrylic acid copolymer based coating is<br>
used to enhance the adhesion of liquid toner to polymeric substrates such as biaxially<br>
oriented polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate and polyvinyl chloride. However, the<br>
ethylene-acrylic acid copolymer based coating must be used in conjunction with an<br><br>
additional precoating which is required to form the bond between the coating and polymeric<br>
substrate.<br>
Accordingly, there is still a need in the art for a primer coating which provides good<br>
liquid toner adhesion to a variety of polymeric substrates without the need for the<br>
application of additional precoatings, is stable and easy to handle over a wide range of<br>
temperatures, and which has an extended shelf life.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention meet those needs by providing a primer<br>
coating for use on a wide variety of polymeric substrates such as polypropylene, biaxially<br>
oriented polypropylene (BOPP), polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide, biaxially oriented<br>
polyamide, and polyvinyl chloride. The coating provides enhanced liquid toner adhesion to<br>
such polymeric substrates, especially those which are printed using electrophotographic<br>
printing devices without the need for an additional precoating.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, a primer coating for enhancing<br>
adhesion of liquid toner to a polymeric substrate is provided. The primer coating comprises<br>
a mixture of<br>
a dispersion of a copolymer of ethylene and acrylic or methacrylic acid; and a compatible<br>
adhesion enhancer selected from the group consisting of an aliphatic polyurethane emulsion,<br>
a hydrogenated hydrocarbon rosin or rosin ester emulsion, and an amorphous acrylic<br>
polymer emulsion. By "adhesion enhancer," it is meant that the component enhances<br>
adhesion of the coating to the substrate to which it is applied.<br>
The primer coating preferably further includes a wetting agent which is preferably<br>
selected from the group consisting of alcohols and surfactants. The primer coating also<br>
preferably includes a matting agent. The matting agent may comprise, for example,<br>
amorphous silica.<br>
The primer coating also preferably includes an antiblocking agent selected from the<br>
group consisting of crosslinking agents, waxes, silica, metal hydroxides, and mixtures<br>
thereof. Where the antiblocking agent comprises a metal hydroxide, the coating preferably<br>
includes from about 0.05 to about 1.0% by weight of the metal hydroxide. Where the<br>
antiblocking agent is a crosslinking agent, the coating preferably includes from about 0.05 to<br><br>
5% by weight of the crosslinking agent. A preferred crosslinking agent is a melamine<br>
formaldehyde resin.<br>
Where the antiblocking agent comprises a wax, the coating preferably includes from<br>
about 4 to 15% by weight of the wax.<br>
Preferably, the primer coating comprises from about 60 to 95% by weight of the<br>
copolymer dispersion. Typically, the dispersion contains 35% total solids. Where the<br>
adhesion enhancer comprises an aliphatic polyurethane dispersion, the coating preferably<br>
comprises from about 5 to 40% of the dispersion, which contains 33% total solids. Where<br>
the adhesion enhancer comprises a hydrogenated hydrocarbon rosin or rosin ester dispersion,<br>
the coating preferably comprises from about 10 to 40% by weight of the hydrogenated<br>
hydrocarbon rosin or rosin ester dispersion based on a 55% total solids content. Where the<br>
toner adhesion enhancer comprises an amorphous acrylic polymer dispersion, the coating<br>
preferably comprises from about 5 to 40% by weight of the amorphous acrylic polymer<br>
dispersion based on a 35% total solids content.<br>
The primer coating is preferably applied to a polymeric substrate by applying the<br>
coating to at least one major surface of the substrate and then preferably drying the coating.<br>
Preferably, the polymeric substrate is selected from polypropylene, biaxially oriented<br>
polypropylene, cast polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide, biaxially oriented<br>
polyamide, and polyvinyl chloride.<br>
In one embodiment, the method of applying the primer coating includes treating at<br>
least one major surface of the substrate by a flame treatment or corona discharge treatment<br>
prior to applying the primer coating.<br>
Typically, the primer coating is applied to the polymeric substrate such that, when<br>
dried, it forms a coating having a thickness of from about 0.1 to about 2 microns, and more<br>
preferably, from about 0.3 to about 0.5 microns. The coated substrate may then be printed<br>
by applying liquid toner from a digital printing apparatus to the coated surface of the<br>
polymeric substrate without the need for additional precoatings.<br>
Accordingly, it is a feature of the present invention to provide a primer coating and a<br>
method of applying the coating to polymeric substrates which provides enhanced toner<br><br>
adhesion to the coated polymeric substrates when printed with liquid toner inks using<br>
electrophotographic printing devices. This, and other features and advantages of the present<br>
invention will become apparent from the following detailed description.<br>
The primer coating of the present invention provides a number of advantages over<br>
prior coatings in that it provides enhanced liquid toner adhesion to a number of different<br>
polymeric substrates. In addition, the coating does not require the use of any additional<br>
primers or precoatings to achieve proper adhesion, and avoids the problems of solvent-based<br>
coatings because it comprises a water-based composition.<br>
The primer coating is based on a dispersion of a copolymer of ethylene and acrylic<br>
acid or methacryiic acid, which ensures good transfer of the ink image to the substrate. The<br>
copolymer exhibits good adhesion to ethylenic polymers as such polymers are typically the<br>
binders used in liquid toner compositions. The copolymer should have a sufficient degree of<br>
hot tack to ensure that, during printing, the image is removed from the printing blanket<br>
under normal operating temperatures (120°C to 140°C) when the image is brought into<br>
contact with the substrate. Preferably, the copolymer comprises from about 65 to 95 wt%<br>
ethylene and from about 5 to 35 wt% acrylic or methacryiic acid. The copolymer may have<br>
a number average molecular weight of about 2,000 to 50,000. The copolymer is preferably<br>
prepared as a dispersion by heating the solid polymer with a water phase in a pressure<br>
reactor in the presence of a base such as ammonia or an alkali such that the base reacts with<br>
the acid groups on the polymer, and upon melting, the polymer forms a colloidal dispersion.<br>
The primer coating contains from about 60 to 95 wt% of the dispersion containing 35%<br>
total solids. A suitable ethylene acrylic acid dispersion for use in the present invention is<br>
commercially available from Michelman under the designation Michem®Prime 4990R.E.<br>
While ethylene-acrylic or methacrylic acid copolymers exhibit good ink<br>
transferability, generally they do not have sufficient adhesion to nonpolar polymeric<br>
substrates such as polypropylene or polyethylene terephthalate. Accordingly, the primer<br>
coating further includes an adhesion enhancer which is compatible with the ethylene-acrylic<br>
or methacryiic acid copolymer dispersion and which increases adhesion to the underlying<br>
substrate without adversely affecting the transfer of the ink image to the substrate. The<br><br>
adhesion enhancer is preferably in the form of a dispersion comprising either a polyurethane,<br>
a hydrogenated hydrocarbon rosin or rosin ester, or an amorphous acrylic polymer. Where<br>
the coating includes a polyurethane dispersion, the coating preferably includes from about 5<br>
to 40 wt% of the dispersion which contains 33% total solids. A suitable polyurethane<br>
dispersion is commercially available from NeoResins under the designation NeoRez® R-<br>
600. Other suitable polyurethane dispersions include Incorez 217 from Industrial<br>
Copolymer Ltd. and TD7037 or TD7038 from Scott Bader Company Ltd.<br>
Where the toner adhesion enhancer comprises a hydrocarbon rosin or rosin ester<br>
dispersion, the coating includes from about 10 to 40 wr% of the dispersion which contains<br>
55% solids. Preferably, a hydrogenated hydrocarbon rosin or rosin ester having a ring and<br>
ball softening point in the range of from about 70°C to 105°C is used. The rosin or rosin<br>
ester dispersion is preferably formed by melting the rosin or rosin ester and then dispersing<br>
the polymer in a water phase using surfactants and agitation. A suitable hydrocarbon resin<br>
dispersion is commercially available from Eastman Chemical Resins Inc. under the<br>
designation Tacolyn 1100. Other suitable hydrocarbon resin dispersions include Tacolyn<br>
3166 and Tacolyn 4187, also available from Eastman Chemical Resins Inc.<br>
Where the toner adhesion enhancer comprises an amorphous acrylic polymer<br>
dispersion, the coating may include from about 5 to 40% of the dispersion which contains<br>
35% solids. The dispersion is preferably prepared by dissolving amorphous acrylic<br>
polymers in water at elevated temperatures in the presence of ammonia or bases. A suitable<br>
amorphous acrylic emulsion is Neocryl BT36 from Neo Resins.<br>
The primer coating of the present invention preferably further contains a wetting<br>
agent for reducing the surface tension of the coating to wet out the substrate and to promote<br>
flow or leveling of the coating prior to drying. Suitable wetting agents include surfactants<br>
and alcohols, such as isopropyl alcohol. Preferred surfactants include nonionic acetylinic<br>
glycol-based surfactants such as Dynol™ 604 from Air Products. Other suitable surfactants<br>
include polyalkylene oxide modified polymethylsiloxanes such as Silwet® L-77 from GE<br>
Advanced Materials.<br>
Other optional additives which may be included in the primer coating are matting<br><br>
agents such as amorphous silica, which maintains a matte print surface. Such additives may<br>
be present in an amount of from about 2 to 4 wt%. A preferred amorphous silica is Ace-<br>
Matt TS100, available from Degussa. If the substrate used is glossy, higher amounts of<br>
silica (up to about 15% by weight) may be used to achieve a matte print surface.<br>
Because the primer coating exhibits a high hot tack, it is desirable to add one or more<br>
antiblocking agents to the coating to reduce residual tack when the substrate is rewound after<br>
coating and during storage. The antiblocking agents should not interfere with hot tack<br>
development and transfer of the ink image to the substrate. Preferred antiblocking agents<br>
include<br>
crosslinking agents, waxes, silica, metal hydroxides, and mixtures thereof. A preferred<br>
crosslinking agent is melamine formaldehyde resin, which may be present in an amount of<br>
from about 0.05 to 5 wt%. Other suitable crosslinking agents include sodium hydroxide,<br>
potassium hydroxide, zinc oxide, and polyethylene imine (Aziridine).<br>
Suitable waxes include carnauba wax, oxidized polyethylene wax, and montan wax.<br>
Preferred for use is a 25% solids carnauba wax emulsion available from Michelman, Inc.<br>
under the designation Michem® Lube 160. The wax is preferably included in an amount of<br>
from about 4 to 15% by weight of the total dispersion.<br>
Where metal hydroxides are added to the formulation as antiblocking agents, they are<br>
incorporated as metal ions to form a partial ionomerization of the ethylene-acrylic or<br>
methacrylic copolymer. The metal ions may be selected from Group IA, IIA, or IIB of the<br>
periodic table. Preferred for use are sodium or potassium ions in the form of their<br>
hydroxides. The hydroxides are included in amount of from about 0.05 to 1% by weight.<br>
When such metal hydroxides are used, the primer coating is preferably made by forming two<br>
ethylene acrylic acid dispersions; e.g., an ammonia dispersion based on MichemPrime<br>
4990R.E. and a sodium dispersion based on the same ethylene acrylic acid.<br>
The two dispersions are preferably blended in a ratio of 40 to 100 parts of the<br>
ammonia-based dispersion and 0 to 60 parts of the sodium based dispersion along with the<br>
remaining components.<br>
Water (preferably soft water) may also be added to the primer coating to lower the<br><br>
viscosity of the coating and aid in the flow of the coating. The coating may contain from 0<br>
to 30 wt% of soft water.<br>
Before the primer coating is applied to a polymeric substrate, the surface of the<br>
substrate is preferably treated to ensure that the coating will wet out the surface of the film.<br>
The film is<br>
preferably treated using conventional techniques such as a flame treatment or a high voltage<br>
corona discharge treatment.<br>
The primer coating is applied to the polymeric substrate in any suitable manner<br>
including gravure coating, roll coating, wire rod coating, flexographic printing, spray coating<br>
and the like. The coating composition is preferably applied such that upon drying, the<br>
coating forms a smooth, evenly distributed layer of about 0.1 to 2 microns in thickness, and<br>
more preferably, from about 0.3 to 0.5 microns in thickness, which imparts the desired<br>
printability and adhesion properties to the liquid toner ink and the substrate. After the<br>
coating is applied, it may be dried by hot air, radiant heat, or any other suitable means which<br>
provides a clear, adherent coated film.<br>
In order that the invention may be more readily understood, reference is made to the<br>
following examples, which are intended to illustrate the invention, but are not to be taken as<br>
limiting the scope thereof.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
Several primer coating compositions were prepared in accordance with embodiments<br>
of the present invention by mixing the components listed below.<br><br><br>
to the primer. The adhesion test was performed after 15 minutes and after 24 hours by<br>
applying adhesive tape in accordance with ISO 2409 and removing the tape after 30 minutes.<br>
If any film (primer coating) or toner removal occurred, the test was recorded as a failure; no<br>
removal of the toner or coating indicated a pass.<br>
The comparative formulation 4 is the only formulation which failed. In all other<br>
formulations, total adhesion of the film to the primer coating and total adhesion of the toner<br>
to the coating was achieved. The results demonstrate that an ethylene-acrylic copolymer<br>
dispersion alone, even when used in conjunction with a wetting agent and a high surface<br>
energy film, does not achieve sufficient toner adhesion when compared to formulations of<br>
embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Example 2<br>
Formulations 1,2, and 3 above were applied to corona discharge treated biaxially<br>
oriented polypropylene film (having a surface energy of greater than 40 dynes/cm) using the<br>
application method described in Example 1. All four coated substrates were printed on a<br>
Hewlett-Packard Indigo series 1000 sheet fed printer and tested for adhesion after 15<br>
minutes and 24 hours. All three printed samples passed the adhesive tape test as described<br>
above. In a separate test, Comparative Formulation 4 showed adhesive failure to the OPP<br>
film when applied under the same conditions.<br>
Example 3<br>
Formulation 1 was applied to an opaque polypropylene synthetic paper (obtained<br>
from YUPO Corporation) using a flexographic roll coater at a coat weight of 0.7 gm/m2.<br>
The coating was dried in-line using infra-red heaters and then re-wound. The coated reels<br>
were then slit and sheeted. The sheets were printed using a Hewlett-Packard HP Indigo<br>
series 1000 sheet fed printer. The printed samples passed the adhesive tape test as<br>
described above.<br><br>
the substrate and the compatibility of the coated substrate to toner, specifically highlight<br>
dots, thin lines, and areas of high coverage. A repeated pattern of 5 different print tests are<br>
run for approximately 200 linear meters. Any lack of transfer is noted.<br>
Fixing refers to adhesion of the ink to the substrate. A test image prints block areas<br>
of color on the substrate, and adhesion of the ink to the substrate is tested immediately and<br>
after 1 hour intervals after printing. Reaching 100% adhesion within 15 minutes is<br>
considered good.	<br>
Flaking refers to the tendency for the ink to flake off the substrate. This test shows<br>
the adhesion and flexibility of the substrate-coating-ink interfaces.<br>
Number of print cleanings refers to the number of sheets needed to remove any<br>
residual toner ink left on the blanket or photo imaging plate and get a completely clean<br>
image. This is done by printing a number of A4 100% yellow images. Ideally, a low<br>
number should be used, showing that 100% ink transfer from the blanket to the substrate is<br>
occurring.<br>
Memories refers to a stress test conducted to see if a memory of a previous image is<br>
transferred to the next substrate. This is another way of testing to see if the coated substrate<br>
provides 100% ink transfer from the blanket.<br>
Transport refers to any web feeding problems which occur during printing.<br>
The results of the tests are shown below in Table 1.<br><br><br>
All of the coated substrates exhibited excellent printability on the HP<br>
Indigo WS4000 printer with the exception of the uncoated reference sample,<br>
which was found to be unprintable, i.e., no print was transferred to the<br>
sample.<br>
Example 7<br>
Formulations 7 and 8 were printed on three different films by direct gravure<br>
printing. The films were biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP); and polyethylene<br>
terephthalate (PET). The coated substrates were printed on an HP Indigo Press WS4000<br>
printer with Electrolnk Mark 4.0 (HP Indigo). Substrate transport was very good. No<br>
problems were found with friction, stickiness, or electrostatics. The ink transferability was<br>
excellent during the overall test. No fails in ink transfer were found until the blankets<br>
reached more than 50,000 separations. The cleaning pages and cleaning monitors indicated<br>
that the blankets were free from ink residue or background images for the majority of the<br>
test. The blankets were found to be free from printing memories or ghosts up to at least<br>
25,000 separations. The adhesion of the primer and toner ink on the substrate was excellent.<br>
Tests were conducted using a peeling test procedure with 3M 610 tape.<br>
While certain representative embodiments and details have been shown for purposes<br>
of illustrating the invention, it will be apparent to those persons skilled in the art that various<br>
changes in the methods and apparatus disclosed herein may be made without departing from<br>
the scope of the invention.<br><br>
