The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
	The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition containing ferulic acid and matrine compounds, the preparation methods and usagethereof.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
	Ferulic acid, also named as 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy cinnamic acid, is one of the phenol acids widely found in a variety of plants.  Ferulic acid is one of the active ingredients in some Chinese medicinal herbs like ‘Danggui’ (angelica), ‘Chuanxiong’, and ‘Awei’ (ferulic) and has a wide range of pharmacology effects such as anti-inflammatory effect, antibacterial effect, anti-oxidation effect, enhancing immunity, anti-tumor effect, anti-cardiovascular disease effect, antithrombotic effect, anti-Alzheimer's effect, et al. <br>
	One of the most common Chinese medicinal herbs, Sophora flavescens Alt. contains a variety of alkaloids which mainly have matrine and oxymatrine, also have sophocarpine, sophoridine, N-oxysophocarpine and iso-matrine. Using these alkaloids like matrine, oxymatrine, and sophocarpine as active ingredients which have pharmacology effects like antivirus effect, anti-liver fibrosis effect, enhancing immunity, anti-inflammatory and antiallergic effects, some pharmaceutical products have been clinically used in the treatments for chronic liver disease, virus infection, cancer and cardiovascular disease. <br>
	Our research found that the pharmaceutical compositions containing ferulic acid and matrine compounds can significantly increase the pharmacology effects of both ferulic acid and matrine compounds, decrease the toxic effects of matrine compounds, and improve the aqueous and fat solubility of both ingredients.<br>

	The following are the effects on the proliferation and type I collagen content of hepatic stellate cells.<br>
	Materials and reagents: ELISA kit for rats type I collagen, trypsin, fetal bovine serum, etc.<br>
	Methods: Revived hepatic stellate cell (HSC) seeds were placed in a 100 ml plastic incubation flask and incubated in a CO2 incubator (inside 5% CO2, 95% humidity).  The medium was discarded when the cells grew into a single layer.  Digestion solution (5% trypsin) was added.  The digestion solution was removed and centrifuged at 2200 rpm for 7 minutes.  The supernatant was discarded, washed and centrifuged with DMEM incubation solution.  The cells were suspended in a DMEM solution containing 20% fetal bovine serum, and the cell numbers were counted.  The cell suspension was diluted with a DMEM solution and seeded in 96 well culture plate, each well having 100 µl diluted suspension.  After 48 hours, the solution was removed and the cells were washed with a DMEM incubation solution containing 10% bovine serum to synchronize the cells at stable phrase.  The cells were treated with testing compositions diluted in physiological saline (50 µmol/l).  Each treatment tested 6 wells and repeated for 3 times.  After 48 hours, incubation was terminated.  20 µl thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) was added to each well and incubation was continued for an additional 4 hours.  DMSO was added and shaked for 10 minutes.  The HSC absorbance at wavelength 570 nm was measured by microplate reader.  The cells were obtained and incubated by the above method.  The supernatant was obtained and the type I collagen content was measured according to the instructions in the type I collagen kit.<br>

	Testing composition preparation:  ferulic acid and oxymatrine were mixed in a mole ratio 1:1 to prepare a solution..<br>
	Methods: According to the method described in reference (Liu et al., 2005. Chinese journal of arteriosclerosis, 13(3): 305-308).<br>
	Test method:  140 male quails were selected and randomly separated into 7 groups: normal control group (healthy quails), modeling control group (fat arteriosclerosis model which is set up by the methods described in reference), positive control group (fat arteriosclerosis model is treated by luofatading 10 mg/kg), ferulic acid control group (tested with ferulic acid 40 mg/kg), large/medium/small dosage testing groups (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg respectively, of testing compositions).  Except the normal control group, all the other 6 groups were fat arteriosclerosis models.  <br>
	The quails were daily intragastric administrated with testing compositions or controls once per day for consecutive four weeks.  The fourth weekend after administration, the content of serum lipid from 10 quails of each group was detected.  In the end, pathological examination was conducted on the surviving quails.<br>
	Method to detect the content of serum lipid: at the end of the 4th week after administration, feeding was stopped for 12 hours.  2 ml blood was collected from jugular vein.  The serum was separated.  The contents of serum cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) were measured according to an enzymatic method.<br>
	Results: The composition containing ferulic acid and oxymatrine could significantly reduce the serum TC and TG levels in the quails of fat arteriosclerosis model, and its anti-atherosclerosis effect was obviously better than ferulic acid’s. See Table 9.  Most quails in the model group had obvious pathological changes in the aorta, and the aortic atherosclerosis (As) degree in most cases was above grade 2.  Comparatively, the aortic atherosclerosis degree of the quails in the testing group taking the composition containing ferulic acid and oxymatrine was lower, mostly below grade 1-2.  See Table 10.  Most arterial intima was intact under a microscope, part of which had slightly lipid infiltration containing separated foam cells.<br><br>

	The following are the effects of ferulic acid/matrine on acute rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
	Testing composition preparation:  The gel containing ferulic acid and matrine (mole ratio 1:1) were prepared according to a pharmaceutical method.<br><br>
	Methods: 30 pairs of rheumatoid arthritis patients; 30 patients participating in the control group with daily administration of 200 mg naproxen tablets; 30 patients participating in the testing group with daily application on the affected parts of the testing gel containing ferulic acid and matrine.  Both groups were administered for consecutive 5 days.<br>
	Effect observations: obviously effective if both swelling and aches disappear; effective if aches disappear with limited swelling; invalid if both swelling and aches exist.<br>
	Results: In the testing group, 21 cases were obviously effective and 8 cases were effective, total effective percentage 96.7%; in the control group, 12 cases were obviously effective and 11 cases were effective, total effective percentage 76.7%.<br>
	The following are the effects of several compounds on rash.<br>
	Patient selection: 18-25 years old of either gender with rash at both body sides.  Each composition was tested on 10 patients.  Test was carried out with single-blind and self control.  1% composition or control was applied on rash area at left side of the body, and physiological saline was applied on rash area at the right side.  After 10 minutes, the effects were evaluated.<br>
	Effect evaluation:  Obviously effective if both rash and itching feeling disappear; effective if parts of rash and itching feeling disappear; invalid if both rash and itching feeling keep unchanged. <br>
	Results are as shown in Table 11.<br><br>

	The following are the effects of compositions II, III, V on Alzheimer's disease in rats.<br>
1.	Materials and Reagents: oxymatrine, matrine and sophocarpine (Boertaili Inc., Ninxia), huperzine A tablets (Hongqi Inc., Shanghai), D-galactose (No. 2 Shanghai reagent factory), ibotenic acid (IBO, Sigma), all of analytical purity, and total cholinesterase detect kit (Jianchen Inc., Nanjin).<br><br>
2.	Animal grouping, modeling and administration: 57 female Wistar rats (15 month old, 300-450 g, from animal center of Qingdao Institute for Drug Control, fed under normal conditions and natural light with unlimited drink and food) were randomly separated into 6 groups.  Rats in normal control group were intraperitoneal injected with physiological saline for 6 weeks and injected physiological saline into the meynert nucleus basalis.  Rats in modeling control group were injected intraperitoneally with D-galactose (48mg/kg/d) for 6 weeks and injected with ibotenic acid into the meynert nucleus basalis.  Rats in huperzine A control group and testing groups were treated in the same manner as the modeling control group..  After modeling, the rats in the huperzine control group were intragastrically administrated with huperzine A tablets (50 µg/kg).  The rates in testing groups II, III, V were intragastrically administered with compositon (50 mg/kg).  The rats in the normal and modeling control groups were intragastrically administrated with physiological saline for consecutive 7 days.  1 hour after the last administration, the learning ability of all the rats; was evaluated.  Then, the rats were anesthetized with Pentobarbital.  5 ml blood was collected from abdominal aorta.  Immediately the cortex tissue was collected and homogenated with physiological saline into 10% (W/V).  The AChE activity in cortex tissue and blood was measured according to the reagent kit instructions..  <br>
3.	Measurement:  testing the memory ability of rats:  the rats were placed in an electric box with an escaping platform for 3 minutes to get used to the new environments.  The box was then connected to 50V AC.  Upon being shocked, the rats can escape the electricity by jumping onto the platform.  The shocked times (mistakes) within 5 minutes were recorded as a reference for the learning ability of the rats.  After 24 hours, the rats were placed directly on the platform.  The latency time for the first jump was recorded as a reference for the memory ability.  The shocked times (mistakes) within 5 minutes were also recorded.  The latency time of over 5 minutes was considered as 5 minutes.<br>
	T testing method was used to evaluate the difference within different groups, and the difference was statistically significant when P
4.	Results: The AChE activity in cortex tissue and blood can be reduced in the testing group II, III, V.  As well, the learning and memorizing ability of rats were improved.  See Tables 12, 13.  Comparing to the modeling groups, P
