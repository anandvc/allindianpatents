				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention pertains to a method for granulation of concentrated solutions,<br>
especially for fertilizer production, by using a granulator with several impact<br>
blades arranged on at least one shaft set in the desired feed direction, whereby<br>
the shaft rotates in a trough, with an inlet at the beginning of the trough for the<br>
material to be treated and an outlet at the end of the trough for removing the<br>
produced granulate, as well as with entry nozzles for feeding of fluid into the<br>
trough.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Such a method is known, for example, from the document US-3 825 414,<br>
whereby design details of the trough mixers used here are known from the<br>
Japanese abstract JP 9-277 244, in which twin shafts rotate with impact blades.<br>
Also in "Ullmai^n's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry". 5th edition, vol. A 10,<br>
pages 376 ff, such impact mills or trough mixers are known. In such devices, a<br>
fused material is introduced from one side of the trough and mixed in the<br>
interior, whereby through the movement and by addition of fluid, the particles<br>
adhere to one another or get baked together. Granulation should be understood<br>
in this context as an enlargement of particles.<br>
US 3825415 describes a Pugmill granulation process for the production of<br>
fertilizers containing urea and ammonium polyphosphate. Concentrated urea<br>
solution is sprayed onto recycled solids in the pugmill followed by molten<br>
ammonium polyphosphate. The melt is fed to the pugmill at a minimum of 12<br>
inches downstream from the urea to prevent hydrolysis of the urea which results<br>
in foaming and gas evolution. The product from the pugmill is essentially<br>
anhydrous, and no further drying is required. Other fertilizer materials such as<br>
ammonium sulfate, potassium chloride, or micronutrient sources may be<br>
incorporated by adding them to the pugmill during granulation.<br>
GB 599384 discloses a method and apparatus for preparing in a gaseous medium<br>
pulverulent non-coalescent dispersions.<br>
A pulverulent non-coalescent dispersion is prepared by producing in a gaseous<br>
medium a sheet-like zone in vortex movement into which particles of solid and<br>
particles of plastic are projected and become attached to each other by impact.<br>
Finely divided pulverulent material such as silica dust is fed into a chamber, and<br>
is propelled in a vortex of air created around each of two oppositely rotating<br>
impellers, comprising shafts and propellers. A fusible plastic such as residual<br>
asphalt is projected into the vortices under pressure from nozzles connected to a<br>
feed pipe 65.<br>
Guiding vanes may be provided to assist the movement of the air from one<br>
impeller to the other, or, alternatively, the end propellers may be so shaped that<br>
the movement of the air leaving these propellers has no axial component. The<br>
shafts may be hollow for receiving a heating or cooling fluid, which may also be<br>
supplied to pockets in the walls of the vessel. By controlling the temperature<br>
during the mixing either the solid or the plastic may form the exterior phase of<br>
the resultant particles. The batch is discharged through tilting doors. The<br>
pulverulent or comminuted solid may comprise a mixture of materials which may<br>
be combined in a dispersion with a common plastic.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
It is the task of the invention to achieve reproduceable granulates with optimum<br>
grain size with a high degree of effectiveness.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a method for granulation of concentrated<br>
solutions by using a granulator with several impact blades arranged on at least<br>
two shafts set in the desired feeding direction, whereby the shafts rotate in a<br>
trough , with an inlet at the beginning of the trough for the material to be<br>
treated and an outlet at the end of the trough for removing the produced<br>
granulate, as well as entry nozzles for entry of fluid into the trough. The<br>
material to be treated is mechanically fluidized by rotating impact blades,<br>
whereby a fused version of the product to be granulated is sprayed-on over the<br>
length of the treatment trough through the feed nozzles to the generated<br>
particles-bed, the fused material is fed to the particle bed through the spraying<br>
nozzles as droplet mist, and the fused material is sprayed-on through the<br>
spraying nozzles mainly vertically downwards between circular paths of the<br>
impact blades directly on to the particles-bed.<br>
In this method it is achieved, that the impact blades of the granulator are used<br>
for generating a fluidized particles-bed in a mechanical manner, whereby the<br>
material transportation in axial direction right through the granulator is ensured<br>
at the same time. By distributing the feed nozzles over the length of the trough,<br>
fluid can be fed in a very specific manner, whereby in this case a fusion of the<br>
product is fed in a special way. In this way, it is possible to continuously enlarge<br>
the initial small particles and build them up into granulates, which will have the<br>
desired size for extraction. The particles collide in the moving bed, whereby with<br>
the help of the sprayed-in fluid they get enlarged, adhere to one another or get<br>
mixed together.<br>
In a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for granulation<br>
of concentrated solutions by using a granulator with several impact blades<br>
arranged on arms on at least two shafts set in the desired feeding direction,<br>
whereby the shafts rotate in a trough , with an inlet at the beginning of the<br>
trough for the material to be treated an outlet at the end of the trough for<br>
removing the produced granulate, as well as entry nozzles for entry of fluid into<br>
the trough , comprising fluidizing mechanically the material to be treated by<br>
rotating impact blades , whereby a fused version of the product to be granulated<br>
is sprayed-on over the length of the treatment trough through feed nozzles to<br>
the generated particles-bed, feeding the fused material to the particle bed<br>
through the spraying nozzles as droplet mist, spraying-on the fused material<br>
through the spraying nozzles mainly vertically downwards between circular paths<br>
of the impact blades directly on to the particles-bed, and providing the shafts ,<br>
the arms , and the impact blades with core holes, which serve as guides for<br>
heating or cooling agents.<br>
Thus, the granulator comprises a plurality of impact blade mechanically fluidizing<br>
the material to be treated, as well as feed nozzles over the length of the<br>
treatment trough for spraying a fused substance of the product to be granulated<br>
on the generated particles-bed.<br>
It is advantageous to feed the fused material through spray nozzles as droplets<br>
mist to the particles-bed, as similarly foreseen in an extension of the invention,<br>
whereby the fused material can be sprayed mainly vertically from the top<br>
through one, two or more rows of nozzles on to the particles-bed. By spraying-<br>
on the fused material it is possible to attain a largely homogeneous product;<br>
according to the method as per the invention, one can also prevent the tendency<br>
of agglutination.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS.<br>
Further features, details and advantages of the invention can be obtained from<br>
the basis of the following description as well as on the basis of the accompanying<br>
drawings. The following are shown:<br>
Fig. 1 A worm granulator or trough mixer as per the invention in side<br>
view, as twin shaft device; and<br>
Fig. 2 A principle view of a worm granulator in section.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The worm granulator denoted with 1 generally in fig. 1 and 2 is a twin shaft<br>
worm granulator, whereby the invention is not only restricted to this design.<br>
The worm granulator 1 shown has a housing whose bottom part is mainly<br>
designed as a long stretched trough 2 with U-shaped cross-section. The housing<br>
cover 2a lies above on the edge of the trough 2 and closes it tightly. The interior<br>
of the housing is transported over the entire length of the housing by two<br>
horizontally arranged shafts 11 supported in the housing 2.<br>
During operation, the shafts 11 are brought into rotation by means of a drive 12.<br>
Each shaft 11 is provided with arms 10, whose center axis is vertical to the<br>
rotation axis of the shaft.<br>
On the outer end of the each arm 10, a scraper blade 3 is fixed. All arms 10 are<br>
equally long. While operating the worm granulator 1, the outer contours of the<br>
scraper blade 3 move on a covered cylindrical surface encompassing them.<br>
The inner surface of the floor bottom side of the trough 2 surrounds the cylinder<br>
surface at a distance of the manufacturing tolerances, which have to be<br>
maintained for contact-free running of the scraper blades 3, whereas the rising<br>
side walls of the trough 2 are finished plane and largely deviates back from the<br>
cylinder surface.<br>
The arms 10 are fastened in the shaft longitudinal direction in such a way oh the<br>
shaft 11 that the free ends of the arms 10 come to rest on a covered helix. The<br>
scraper blades 3 are slightly aligned to the level of the rotation paths covered by<br>
them.<br>
By means of a feeding stud 4 the fine material and/or the recycled material is fed<br>
to the worm granulator 1, and the treated product is removed by means of a<br>
discharge stud 5. On account of this arrangement of the scraper blade 3, the<br>
fragmented particles of the material being treated in the trough 2 get pushed in<br>
longitudinal direction of the trough: at the same time however, the particles<br>
within the heaping mechanism are rotated by the scraper blades and thoroughly<br>
mixed. Above all, even vertically moving components are pressed on to the<br>
particles.<br>
The worm granujator 1 as per the invention, in which a particles-bed is<br>
transported through with a determinable dwelling time duration and whereby the<br>
bed is at the same time intensively thoroughtly mixed, is particularly suitable to<br>
form enlarged granulates from the initially small particles, by adding fluid to the<br>
initial bed. In the moving bed the particles collide and with the help of the fluid<br>
get adhered to one another or are mixed together. In this invention the<br>
enlarging effect is intensified, in that a fused version of the material to be<br>
treated is sprayed on to the bed from the top. The fused material is fed to the<br>
worm granulator 1 as per the invention through the distribution pipeline 9. Fused<br>
material nozzles 6 are attached in the interior of the trough 2. Through their<br>
nozzle opening, the fused material is sprayed as droplet mist on to the bed. The<br>
two dash-dotted lines in fig. 1 indicating circles represent the path of the outer<br>
contours of the scraper blades 3.<br>
A special extension of the invention is obtained, if the fused material nozzles 6 or<br>
6 spray vertically downwards between the circular paths of the scraper blades 3<br>
directly on to the particles-bed. Fig. 1 shows such arranged fusion material<br>
nozzles 6.<br>
The shafts 11, the arms 10 and the scraper blades 3 can be provided with core<br>
holes, which serve as guides for heating or cooling agents. These are similarly<br>
brought into play'like the trough-shaped housing bottom part for heating or<br>
cooling of the particles-bed, whereby the housing is fitted with an outer jacket<br>
guiding a heating or cooling agent.<br>
