METHODS AND APPARATUSES FOR CDMA2000/GPRS ROAMING<br>
Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง119<br>
[0001]	The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/526,557 entitled "CDMA/GPRS Packet Data Roaming" filed December 3,2003, and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND Field<br>
[0002]	The present disclosed embodiments relate generally to wireless communications,<br>
and more specifically to roaming in the context of CDMA2000 and GPRS systems.<br>
Background<br>
|0003]	Wireless subscribers may desire to use their wireless terminals in conjunction<br>
with wireless systems other man their home systems to obtain access to services using their existing subscriptions. Access to these services may be independent of men-normal wireless terminals, through wireless systems other than their home systems. This may occur, for example, when the subscriber is roaming outside the service area of men-home system. Accordingly, manufacturers and system operators desire to allow subscribers to receive services using their terminals and subscriptions via a system which may not be the subscriber's home system, provided that the terminal and the serving system are compatible.<br>
[0004]	Serving roaming subscribers can be difficult even when the serving system and<br>
home system employ identical technologies. When the serving system uses an air interface that differs from that used in the subscriber's home system, interworking between these systems is typically performed due to fundamental differences in message protocols, call models, et cetra. This interworking can be achieved via an Interworking and Interoperability Function (IIF).<br>
[0005]	One example of an IIF is described in US Patent Application 2002/094811 Al to<br>
Bright et al. entitled "Interworking and Interoperability of GPRS Systems With Systems of Other Technology Families."  US Patent Application 2002/094811 Al provides a<br><br>
WO 2005/057980	3	PCT/US2004/040430<br><br>
GPRS interworking and interoperability function (DF) interposed between a serving<br>
GSM/GPRS wireless system and a second wireless system of a different technology<br>
family. The IIF allows a mobile station homed to the second wireless system to operate<br>
in the GSM/GPRS system. According to US Patent Application 2002/094811 Al,<br>
telecommunications system components are provided that allow interworking and<br>
interoperability of a serving GSM and/or GPRS system with certain "domestic wireless"<br>
systems. For example, a mobile station homed on such a domestic wireless system, but<br>
registered with the serving system in a GPRS-only mode, may receive services from the<br>
serving system. US Patent Application 2002/094811 Al mentions that the term<br>
"domestic wireless" (DW) is intended to refer to non-GSM systems compatible with<br>
ANSI or equivalent standards for TDMA, CDMA, and analog cellular systems, as<br>
generally used in North America, or compatible with other similar systems.<br>
[0006]	Although US Patent Application 2002/094811 A1 acknowledges the need for an<br>
TIF allows a mobile station homed to a CDMA wireless system to operate in the<br>
GSM/GPRS system, US Patent Application 2002/094811 A1 does not discuss an HF<br>
adapted for CDMA2000/GPRS roaming scenarios when the terminal is using Mobile IP<br>
or Simple IP. US Patent Application 2002/094811 A1 fails to provide sufficient<br>
information, direction or guidance regarding how an IIF could be constructed mat<br>
would allow a mobile station homed to a CDMA2000 wireless system could operate in<br>
the GSM/GPRS system, when the terminal is using Mobile IP or Simple IP. For<br>
example, US Patent Application 2002/094811 A1 fails to provide any details regarding<br>
what modules would be needed to implement such an IIF, how the modules would be<br>
interconnected, timed and controlled so as to obtain the specific operations needed to<br>
implement such an IIF.<br>
[0007]	Thus, there is a need in the art for a general architecture can be adapted for<br>
CDMA2000/GPRS roaming scenarios, such as, GPRS foreign mode with Mobile IPv4, GPRS foreign mode with Simple IPv4 or IPv6, CDMA2000 packet data foreign mode with Mobile IPv4, and CDMA2000 packet data foreign mode with Simple IP, Mobile IPv4 or Mobile IPv6. It would be desirable to enable communication between a CDMA 2000 packet data system and a GPRS system, when a CDMA 2000 packet data native subscriber using Simple IP, Mobile IPv4 or Mobile IPv6 roams to the GPRS system by supporting bearer connectivity between the GPRS and CDMA 2000 packet data system. Similarly, it would also be desirable to enable communication between a GPRS system<br><br>
WO 2005/057980	4	PCT/US2004/040430<br>
and a CDMA 2000 packet data system when a GPRS native subscriber roams from the GPRS system to the CDMA 2000 packet data system using Simple IP, Mobile IPv4 or Mobile IPv6 by supporting bearer connectivity between the GPRS system and the CDMA 2000 packet data system.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0031]	The word "exemplaryโ can be used herein to mean "serving as an example,<br>
instance, or illustration." Any embodiment described herein as "exemplary" can be not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments.<br>
[0032]	FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a system that comprises a home system 10, such as<br>
a CDMA 2000 packet data system or a GPRS system, a visited system 20, such as a GPRS system or a CDMA 2000 packet data system, and an interface entity 30 or "HF" that couples the home system 10 to the visited system 20, and enables communication between the home system 10 and the visited system 20.<br>
10033]	The   following  sections  describe  architectures  that  can  be  adapted   for<br>
CDMA2000/GPRS roaming scenarios, such as, GPRS foreign mode with Mobile IPv4, GPRS foreign mode with Simple IPv4 or IPv6, CDMA2000 packet data foreign mode with Mobile IPv4, and CDMA2000 packet data foreign mode with Simple IPv4 or IPv6.<br>
GPRS Foreign Mode with Mobile IPv4<br>
[0034]	FIG. 2A is an exemplary block diagram of a GPRS foreign mode with Mobile<br>
IPv4, and depicts the functions and control interface provided by an IIF in this embodiment This roaming scenario occurs when a CDMA2000 packet data native subscriber operates Mobile IPv4 [IS-835-C] in GPRS foreign mode. In this embodiment, the home system 10 can be a CDMA 2000 packet data system wherein a CDMA 2000 packet data native subscriber roams to a GPRS system and uses Mobile IPv4. The home system 10 comprises a ANSI-41 home location register 131, an AAA entity 116, and a home agent 135. The visited system 20 can be a GPRS system mat comprises a SGSN 137.<br>
[0035]	The interface 30 or "IIFโ comprises an ANSI-41 visited location register 111<br>
coupled to the ANSI-41 home location register 131 via a D interface 113, a GSM home location register 124 coupled to the SGSN 137 via a Gr interface 123, a GGSN 126 coupled to the SGSN 137 via a Gp interface 127 and coupled to the Internet via a Gi interface, an AAA entity 140 coupled to the AAA entity 116 via an X3 interface 117, and a foreign agent 118 coupled to the home agent 135 via an XI interface 115. The IIF<br><br>
WO 2005/057980	10	PCT7US2004/040430<br>
provides both GSM HLR and ANSI-41 VLR emulation to allow the subscriber to<br>
register. This interworking can be provided over the interface references "Gr" and "D".<br>
The IDF provides GGSN and FA emulation to support bearer connectivity between the<br>
visited and home networks via the DF. This interworking can be provided over the<br>
interface references "Gn" and "XI". The ITJF provides AAA emulation to interact with<br>
the home network's AAA for Mobile IP Foreign Agent challenge authentication and<br>
3GPP2 packet data accounting. This interworking can be provided over the interface<br>
reference "X3".<br>
[0036]	If bearer connectivity between from the GPRS system and the CDMA2000<br>
packet data system is not required, then reverse tunneling on the XI interface is not<br>
required. Rather, MS-terminated traffic traverses through the XI and Gp interfaces. In<br>
the case where reverse tunneling is not required, the IIF routes MS-originated traffic,<br>
received on a Gp interface, to the Internet directly via a Gi interface.<br>
[0037]	Thus, for a user homed in a CDMA Mobile IP system roaming to a GSM<br>
system, the KF may present a GGSN interface to GSM and a FA and AAA interfaces to<br>
the CDMA system. The DF may serve as the endpoint for the GTP and Mobile IP<br>
tunnels, with a packet routing function between the GGSN and FA. The DF may also<br>
provide an accounting function so mat operators can charge based on configurable<br>
measurements such as packet count, bandwidth, time of day, etc.<br>
[0038]	FIG. 2B is an exemplary call flow diagram that shows Mobile IPv4 operation in<br>
the GPRS foreign mode. FIG. 2B depicts a call flow example for the roaming scenario<br>
where a CDMA2000 packet data native subscriber operates Mobile IPv4 [IS-835-C] in<br>
the GPRS foreign mode. In this example, the MS has shared secrets with the home<br>
CDMA2000 system for Mobile IP authentication. The MS may request the home<br>
CDMA2000 system to assign a HA and/or an IP address. The reverse tunneling can be<br>
enabled so that all data traffic (MS-originated and -terminated) traverses through the DF<br>
and home CDMA2000 system. The ID? generates 3GPP2 packet data accounting<br>
records and sends it to the home CDMA2000 system via RADIUS.<br>
[0039]	The MS performs GPRS attach with a SGSN.   The authentication associated<br>
with the GPRS attach can be a SIM-based authentication requiring the Ki secret key. The IIF acts as the GSM HLR configured with the Ki secret. In any case, the IIF can be not required to communicate with the HLR in the home CDMA2000 system for the authentication.   (Step 1)   The MS sends the Activate PDP Context Request to the<br><br>
WO 2005/0579*0	11	PCT/US2004/040430<br>
SGSN. The message includes the Access Point Name (APN). The APN has the format<br><network id>.<mno>.<mcc>.gprs. The Network ID (e.g., CDMA2000carrier.com)<br>
indicates to which external network the MS wants to establish a logical connection. The<br>
Requested PDP Address can be omitted in the message. The MS has a static Mobile IP<br>
home address or obtains a new Mobile IP home address. (Step 2) The SGSN selects a<br>
GGSN based on the APN.  The SGSN uses the APN as the lookup name to query a<br>
DNS server (not shown in the figure) and obtains a list of available GGSNs that can be<br>
used to support the requested APN.  The APN's Network ID indicates a CDMA2000<br>
operator, thus, the DNS server returns with the IIFs IP address. (Step 3) The SGSN<br>
sends the Activate PDP Context Request to the selected HF to set up a PDP context for<br>
the MS.   The message includes the APN, but the Requested PDP Address can be<br>
omitted.   (Step 4)   The ID? acts as the GGSN and sends the Create PDP Context<br>
Response to the SGSN that in turn sends the Activate PDP Context Accept to the MS.<br>
The PDP Address in both messages can be set to 0.0.0.0 to indicate that the PDP<br>
address will be assigned later after successful Mobile IP registration. (Step 5) The EOF<br>
acts as the FA and sends one or more Mobile IP Agent Advertisements to the MS,<br>
because the omission of the Requested PDP Address in the Activate PDP Context<br>
Request can be the indication that the MS wishes to use Mobile IP.   The Agent<br>
Advertisement can be sent over the established PDP context The Agent Advertisement<br>
contains the FA Care-of Address and the FA Challenge (FAQ. (Step 6)<br>
[0040]	The MS sends the Mobile IP Registration Request to the IIF over the PDP<br>
context. The following information can be contained in the Registration Request: MS's NAI [RFC 2794] has the format of <username>@<domain_name>, where the domainname identifies the MS's home CDMA2000 system. MS-HA authenticator can be computed based on the content of the Registration Request and the secret shared between the MS and HA [RFC 2002]. MS-AAA authenticator can be computed based on the FAC and the secret shared between the MS and home AAA server [RFC 3012]. The HA Address field can be set to a known value if the MS uses a permanent HA, or to 0.0.0.0 if the MS wants a new HA assigned by the home network. Home Address field can be set to a known value if the MS uses a permanent address, or to 0.0.0.0 if the MS wants a new address assigned by the HA. The T-bit can be set to one to enable a reverse tunnel from the IIF to the MS's HA. (Step 7) The ID? acts as the RADRJS client and sends a RADRIS Access-Request to the home AAA server. The RADRJS Access-<br><br>
WO 2005/057980	12	PCT/US2004/040430<br>
Request conveys MS's NAI, FAC authenticator, FAC, HA address, etc. [IS-835]. (Step<br>
8) If the authentication is successful, the home AAA server responds with the RADIUS<br>
Access-Accept that includes the MS's HA address.     (Step 9) The HF acts as the FA<br>
and forwards the Mobile IP Registration Request to the HA address contained in the<br>
RADIUS Access-Accept.  (Step 10) The HA verifies the MS-HA authenticator in the<br>
Mobile IP Registration Request If the HA doesn't have the shared secret, as in the case<br>
of dynamically assigned HA, it communicates with the home AAA server for the shared<br>
secret.   The HA responds to the Mobile IP Registration Request with the Mobile IP<br>
Registration Reply containing a registration result (e.g., successful or an error code). If<br>
the MS wishes for a new home address, a new address can be returned in the<br>
Registration Reply, otherwise, the MS's permanent address can be returned. (Step 11)<br>
The TIF acts as the FA and forwards the Mobile IP Registration Reply to the MS over<br>
the appropriate PDP context The ID? FA functionality notes the assigned MS IP address<br>
and shares that address with the EOF GGSN functionality. (Step 12)<br>
[0041]	The IIF acts as the GGSN and updates its PDP context by setting the PDP<br>
address to the MS' s home address (as indicated in the Registration Reply and shared by the FA functionality). The PDP address (hence the MS's home address) can be associated with a GTP tunnel identified by the Tunnel Endpoint ID (TEID). (Step 13) The HF acts as the GGSN and triggers the GGSN-initiated PDP Context modification procedure in order to update the PDP address in the SGSN and MS [3GPP TS 29.061]. The HF sends the Update PDP Context Request to the SGSN that forwards it to the MS. (Step 14) The MS responds with the Update PDP Context Response to the SGSN mat forwards it to the UF. (Step 15) The HF acts as the RADIUS client and sends the RADIUS Accounting-Request (Start) to the home AAA server [IS-835]. 3GPP2-vendor-specific attributes are used to convey accounting records, but some airlink record attributes (e.g., service option, mux option, etc.) are not applicable. (Step 16) The home AAA server responds with a RADPJS Accounting-Response (Start). (Step 17) Bearer traffic traverses through the ID? in both directions, if reverse tunneling from the HF to HA is enabled. For routing MS-originated packets, the HF routes packets received from the MS's GTP tunnel (identified by a TEID) to the MS's HA via a Mobile IP reverse tunnel. For routing MS-terminated packets, the ID? routes packets received from the HA-to-FA tunnel to the MS's GTP tunnel.  IPsec can be used to<br><br>
WO 2005/057980	13	PCT/US2004/040430<br>
protect the Mobile IP tunnels between HA and EOF, and the GTP tunnels between IIF and SGSN. (Step 18)<br>
GPRS Foreign Mode with Simple IP<br>
[0042]	FIG. 3 A is an exemplary block diagram of a GPRS foreign mode with Simple IP<br>
that shows a roaming scenario where a CDMA2000 packet data native subscriber<br>
operates IPv4 or IPv6 in the GPRS foreign mode. FIG. 3A also depicts the functions<br>
and control interface provided by an interface or IIF in this case, hi this embodiment,<br>
the home system 10 can be a CDMA 2000 packet data system wherein a CDMA 2000<br>
packet data native subscriber roams to a GPRS system and uses Simple IP. The home<br>
system 10 comprises a ANSI-41 home location register 131, an AAA entity 116, and a<br>
LNS 139. The visited system 20 can be a GPRS system that comprises a SGSN 137.<br>
[0043]	The interface 30 or "IIF" comprises an ANSI-41 visited location register 111<br>
coupled to the ANSI-41 home location register 131 via a D interface 113, a GSM home<br>
location register 124 coupled to the SGSN 137 via a Gr interface 123, a GGSN 126<br>
coupled to the SGSN 137 via a Gp interface 127 and coupled to the Internet via a Gi<br>
interface, an AAA entity 140 coupled to the AAA entity 116 via an X3 interface 117,<br>
and a LAC entity 109 coupled to the LNS 139 via an X2 interface 119. The HF<br>
provides both GSM HLR and ANSI-41 VLR emulation to allow the subscriber to<br>
register. This interworking can be provided over the interface references "Gr" and "D."<br>
The IIF provides GGSN and LAC emulation to support bearer connectivity between the<br>
visited and home networks via the IIF. This interworking can be provided over the<br>
interface references "Gn" and "X2." The IIF provides AAA emulation to interact with<br>
the home network's AAA for L2TP authentication and 3GPP2 packet data accounting.<br>
This interworking can be provided over the interface reference "X3."<br>
[0044]	If bearer connectivity between the CDMA2000 packet data system and GPRS<br>
system is not required, then the X2 interface is not required. The IIF still supports a Gp<br>
interface to the SGSN and provides Internet access via a Gi interface (not shown in the<br>
figure).<br>
[0045]	Thus, for a user homed in a CDMA Simple IP system roaming to a GSM<br>
system, the IIF may present a GGSN interface to GSM and a normal routing interface to the CDMA system. The ITF may serve as the endpoint for the GTP and IPSec tunnels, with a packet routing function between the GGSN and the CDMA system. The HF may<br><br>
WO 2005/057980	14	PCTAJS2004/040430<br>
also provide an accounting function so that operators can charge based on configurable<br>
measurements such as packet count, bandwidth, time of day, etc.<br>
[0046]	FIG. 3B is an exemplary call flow diagram that shows Simple IP operation in the<br>
GPRS foreign mode, and explains a roaming scenario where a CDMA2000 packet data<br>
native subscriber operates Simple IP in the GPRS foreign mode. In this example, the<br>
MS has shared secrets with the home CDMA2000 system for Simple IP authentication<br>
(i.e., CHAP). The MS establishes a PPP session, via LOT, to the home CDMA2000<br>
system. During the PPP establishment, the home CDMA2000 system assigns an IP<br>
address to the MS dynamically. All the MS's data traffic (MS-originated and - MS<br>
terminated) traverses through the IIF and home CDMA2000 system. The IIF generates<br>
3GPP2 packet data accounting records and sends it to the home CDMA2000 system via<br>
RADIUS.<br>
[0047]	The MS performs GPRS attach with a SGSN.   The authentication associated<br>
with the GPRS attach can be a SIM-based authentication requiring the Ki secret The<br>
IIF acts as the GSM HLR configured with the Ki secret or the GSM VLR In any case,<br>
the OF can be not required to communicate with the HLR in the home GDMA2000<br>
system for the authentication. (Step 1) The MS sends the Activate PDP Context<br>
Request to the SGSN. The message includes me APN (Access Point Name). The APN<br>
has me format <network id>.<mnc>.<mcc>.gprs. The Network ID (e.g.,<br>
CDMA2000carrier.com) indicates to which external network the MS wants to establish<br>
a logical connection. The Requested PDP Address can be omitted in the message so<br>
that the IIF (acting as a GGSN) later will not assign an IP address to the MS; instead,<br>
the address will be assigned by the LNS. (Step 2) The SGSN selects a GGSN based on<br>
the APN. The SGSN queries a DNS server (not shown in the figure) and obtains a list<br>
of available GGSNs that can be used to support the requested APN. hi this case, the<br>
APN*s Network ID indicates a CDMA2000 operator, thus, the DNS server returns with<br>
the IIF's IP address- (Step 3)<br>
[0048]	The SGSN sends the Activate PDP Context Request to the selected IIF to set up<br>
a PDP context for the MS. The message includes the APN, but the Requested PDP Address can be omitted. (Step 4) The DF acts as the GGSN and sends the Create PDP Context Response to the SGSN that in turn sends the Activate PDP Context Accept to the MS. The PDP Address in both messages can be set to 0.0.0.0 to indicate that the PDP address will be reset later. (Step 5)<br><br>
WO 2005/057980	15	PCT/US2004/040430<br>
-<br>
[0049]	After the PDP context can be established, the MS and IIF perform PPP LCP<br>
negotiation. The IDF LAC functionality establishes L2TP tunnels with a LNS. The IIF determines which LNS based on the requested APN. The IIF is configured with the LNS information (e.g., LNS's IP address) corresponding to an APN. After the L2TP tunnel establishment, the IIF LAC functionality forwards LCP information between the LNS and MS. During the LCP negotiation, the LNS and MS negotiate PAP or CHAP as the protocol for PPP authentication. (Step 6) PPP authentication (PAP or CHAP) is performed. The MS's credential is authenticated by the home AAA in the CDMA2000 system. The RADIUS interaction between the LNS and home AAA is not shown in the figure. (Step 7) The LNS and MS perform PPP TPCP negotiation. The IIF LAC functionality relays IPCP messages between the L2TP tunnel and PDP context. During the negotiation, the LNS assigns an IP address to the MS. The IIF monitors for this address and uses it as the MS's PDP address. (Step 8)<br>
[0050]	The IIF also needs to notify the SGSN and MS about the updated PDP address.<br>
Recall that the PDP address can be set to 0.0.0.0 initially. Therefore, the TIF sends the Update PDP Context Request to the SGSN that forwards it to the MS. (Step 9) The MS responds with the Update PDP Context Response to the SGSN that forwards it to the TIF. (Step 10)<br>
[0051]	The HF acts as the RADIUS client and sends the RADIUS Accounting-Request<br>
(Start) to the home AAA server [IS-835]. 3GPP2-vendor-specific attributes are used to convey accounting records, but some airlink record attributes (e.g., service option, mux option, etc.) are not applicable. (Step 11) The home AAA server responds with the RADIUS Accounting-Response (Start). (Step 12) Bearer traffic traverses through the ITF in both directions. For routing MS-originated packets, the ITF routes packets received from the MS's GTP tunnel (identified by a TEID) to the MS's L2TP tunnel/session. For routing MS-terminated packets, the HF routes packets received from the MS's L2TP tunnel/session to the MS's GTP tunnel. IPsec can be used to protect the L2TP tunnel/session between LNS and ITF, and the GTP tunnels between IDF and SGSN. (Step 13)<br>
CDMA2000 Packet Data Foreign Mode with Mobile IPv4<br>
[0052]	FIG. 4A is an exemplary block diagram of a CDMA2000 packet data foreign<br>
mode with Mobile IPv4. This section describes the roaming scenario where a GPRS<br><br>
WO 2005/057980	16	PCT/US2004/040430<br>
native subscriber operates Mobile IPv4 jTS-835-C] in the CDMA2000 packet data<br>
foreign mode. FIG. 4A also depicts the functions and control interface provided by the<br>
IIF in this case. In this embodiment, the home system 10 can be a GPRS system. A<br>
GPRS native subscriber roams to a CDMA 2000 packet data system and uses Simple IP.<br>
The home system 10 comprises a GSM home location register 124, a GGSN 126, and<br>
an AAA entity 128. The visited system 20 can be a CDMA 2000 packet data system<br>
that comprises a ANSI-41 visited location register 111, an AAA entity 116, and a packet<br>
data serving node/ foreign agent 118.<br>
[0053]	The interface 30 or "IIF' comprises an ANSI-41 home location register 131<br>
coupled to the ANSI-41 visited location register 111 via a D interface 113, a GSM<br>
visited location register 133 coupled to the GSM home location register 124 via a D<br>
interface 121, a SGSN 137 coupled to the GGSN 126 via a Gp interface 127, an AAA<br>
entity 140 coupled to the AAA entity 128 via a X4 interface 129 and coupled to the<br>
AAA entity 116 via a X3 interface 117, and a home agent 135 coupled to the packet<br>
data serving node/ foreign agent 118 via a XI interface 115.  The HF provides both<br>
GSM VLR and ANSI-41 HLR emulation to allow the subscriber to register.   This<br>
interworking can be provided over the interface reference "D". The IIF provides HA<br>
and SGSN emulation to support bearer connectivity between the visited and home<br>
networks via the HF. This interworking can be provided over the interface reference<br>
"XI" and "Gn". The HF provides AAA emulation to interact with the visited network's<br>
AAA for Mobile IP authentication and 3GPP2 packet data accounting.  The IIF also<br>
may interact with the home network's AAA for 3GPP packet data accounting.  This<br>
interworking can be provided over the interface reference "X3" and "X4".    The<br>
EOF/AAA requirements for CDMA2000 packet data foreign mode with mobile IP will be<br>
described below in greater detail.<br>
[0054]	If bearer connectivity between the visited GDMA2000 packet data system and<br>
home GPRS system is not required, the Gp interface is not required. In this case, mobile-originated data traffic can be routed directly to the Internet via the PDSN/FA in the visited system, or via the DDF/HA if reverse tunneling is enabled. Mobile-terminated data traffic is routed to the PDSN/FA via the IIF/HA. The interface X3 and X4 are required for the IIF to interwork AAA messages between the CDMA2000 AAA server and GPRS AAA server.<br><br>
WO 2005/05798ยฉ	\*|	PCT/US2004/04043ยฉ<br>
[0055]	Thus, for a user homed m a GSM system roaming to a CDMA Mobile IP<br>
system, the DF may present a HA interface to the CDMA system and a SGSN interface<br>
to the GSM system. A subset of SGSN functions is required including APN resolution.<br>
The EOF may serve as the endpoint for the Mobile IP and GTP tunnels, with a packet<br>
routing function between the HA and SGSN functions.<br>
[0056]	FIG. 4B is an exemplary call flow diagram that shows Mobile IPv4 operation in<br>
the CDMA2000 packet data foreign mode. This call flow example shows a roaming<br>
scenario where a GPRS native subscriber operates Mobile IPv4 [IS-835-C] in the<br>
CDMA2000 packet data foreign mode. In this example, the home GPRS system<br>
doesn't support HA; thus, the MS has shared secrets with the DF for Mobile IP<br>
authentication. The home GPRS system dynamically assigns an IP address to the MS.<br>
All MS's data traffic (MS-originated and MS-terminated) traverses through the HF and<br>
home GPRS system. The DF receives 3GPP2 accounting records from the visited<br>
CDMA2000 system and may map them to 3GPP accounting records and forward them<br>
to the home GPRS system via RADIUS.<br>
[0057]	The MS originates SO 33 and establishes a PPP session with the PDSN/FA.<br>
(Step 1) The PDSN/FA sends one or more Mobile IP Agent Advertisement to the MS,<br>
because the omission of the IP-Address Configuration Option daring the PPP IPCP<br>
negotiation indicates (hat the MS wishes to use Mobile IP. The Agent Advertisement<br>
contains the FA Care-of Address and the FA Challenge (FAC). (Step 2)<br>
[0058]	The MS sends the Mobile IP Registration Request to the PDSN/FA.   The<br>
following information can be contained in the Registration Request: MS's NAI [RFC<br>
2794] has the format of <usemame>@<domain_name>, where the domainname<br>
identifies the MS's home GPRS system. MS-HA authenticator can be computed based<br>
on the content of the Registration Request and the secret shared between the MS and<br>
HA [RFC 2002]. MS-AAA authenticator can be computed based on the FAC and the<br>
secret shared between the MS and home AAA server [RFC 3012]. The HA Address<br>
field can be set to a known value if the MS uses a permanent HA, or to 0.0.0.0 if the MS<br>
wants a new HA assigned by the home network. The HA field can be set to 0.0.0.0 to<br>
request a new address assigned by the HA. The T-bit can be set to one to request the<br>
PDSN/FA to establish a reverse tunnel to the MS's HA. (Step 3)<br>
[0059]	The PDSN/FA generates a RADIUS Access-Request conveying MS's NAI,<br>
FAC authenticator, FAC, HA address, etc. [IS-835]. Because the domain name of the<br><br>
WO 2005/057980	18	PCT/US2004/040430<br>
MS's NAI indicates a GPRS system, the PDSN/FA sends a RADIUS Access-Request to<br>
the IIF via the AAA in the CDMA2000 system. The IIF may modify the message in<br>
accordance with [3GPP TS 29.061]. (Step 4) If the authentication is successfull, the<br>
home AAA server responds with the RADIUS Access-Accept. The message is routed<br>
back to the PDSN via IIF and visited AAA. The IIF may modify the message in<br>
accordance with [P.S0001-A V3.0]. (Step 5) The PDSN/FA forwards the Mobile IP<br>
Registration Request to the HA function in the HF. The HF verifies the MS-HA<br>
authenticator in the Mobile IP Registration Request (Step 6)<br>
[0060]	If the authentication is successful, the IDF SGSN functionality establishes GTP<br>
tunnels with a GGSN in the home GPRS system and can request an IP address from the<br>
GGSN.   The HF SGSN functionality derives an APN that has the format <network></network>
ID&gt;mnc<mnc>.mnc<mcc>.gprs [TS 23.003].    The <network id> is the realm<br>
portion of the MS's NAI and indicates which GGSN the MS wants to access for the<br>
requested service.  The <mnc> and <mcc> are derived from the MS's IMSI.  The<br>
MS's NAI and IMSI are available from the RADIUS Access-Request in step 4.  The<br>
SGSN functionality uses the derived APN as the lookup name to query GPRS DNS<br>
server (not shown in the figure) and from it obtains a list of available GGSNs that can<br>
be used to support the requested service. The IIF SGSN functionality sends the Create<br>
PDP Context Request to the selected GGSN.   The Requested PDP Address in the<br>
message is set to 0.0.0.0 to request a new IP address.  (Step 7) The GGSN responds<br>
with the Create PDP Context Response including the new IP address assigned to the<br>
MS. (Step 8) The HF acts as the HA and sends the Mobile IP Registration Reply to the<br>
MS via the PDSN/FA.  The Home Address field in the Mobile IP Registration Reply<br>
can be set to the IP address assigned by the GGSN.   (Step 9)  The PDSN sends the<br>
RADIUS   Accounting-Request  (Start)  containing  3GPP2  packet  data accounting<br>
information [P.S0001-A V3.0]. Because the domain name of the MS's NAI indicates a<br>
GPRS system, the RADIUS Accounting-Request (Start) is routed to the home AAA in<br>
the GPRS system via the visited AAA and HF.  The HF may modify the message in<br>
accordance with [3GPP TS 29.061]. (Step 10) The HF acts as the RADIUS server and<br>
replies with the RADIUS Accounting-Response (Start). (Step 11)<br>
[0061]	Bearer traffic traverses through the HF in both directions.   For routing MS-<br>
originated packets, the HF routes packets received from the Mobile IP reverse tunnel to the MS's GTP tunnel (identified by a TEID). For routing MS-terminated packets, the<br><br>
WO 2005/057980	19	PCT/US2004/040430<br>
IIF routes packets received from the GTP tunnel to a HA-to-FA tunnel. IPsec can be used to protect the Mobile IP tunnels between PDSN/FA and IIF, and the GTP tunnels between IIF and GGSN. (Step 12)<br>
IIF/AAA Requirements for CDMA2000 Packet Data Foreign Mode with Mobile IP<br>
[0062]	The IIF requirements to process the RADIUS Access-Request received from the<br>
visited CDMA2000 packet data system will now be described.<br>
[0063]	The IIF proxies all IETF RADIUS attributes without modification, except the<br>
Calling-Station-ID attribute, Called-Station-ID attribute, and Framed-Protocol attribute. The processing of these three attributes is described below. If the Calling-Station-ID attribute in the received RADIUS Access-Request contains IMSI, the HF copies the IMSI into the 3GPP-IMSI attribute [3GPP TS 29.061] and include it in the RADIUS Access-Request destined for the MS's home GPRS system. The TJDF does not include the Calling-Station-ID attribute in the RADRJS Access-Request sent to the home AAA in the GPRS system. If the Calling-Station-ID attribute in the received RADIUS Access-Request contains MIN or IRM, the IIF maps it to the MS's IMSI used in the home GPRS system and include it in the 3GPP-IMSI attribute of the RADIUS Access-Request destined for the home GPRS system. The IIF does not include the Calling-Station-ID attribute in the RADIUS Access-Request sent to the home AAA in the GPRS system.<br>
[0064]	The IIF includes the Called-Station-ID attribute in the RADIUS Access-Request<br>
destined for the MS's home GPRS system. The Value field of the Called-Station-ID attribute is set to the APN (see section 83.4). If the Framed-Protocol attribute is included in the received RADIUS Access-Request, the IIF overrides the value to 7 [3GPP TS 29.061]. The IIF removes all 3GPP2 VSAs from the received RADIUS Access-Request. The IIF is not required to include any 3GPP VSAs, except the 3GPP-IMSI attribute, in the transmitted RADRJS Access-Request destined for the MS's home GPRS system.<br>
[0065]	The IDF requirements to process the RADRJS Access-Accept received from the<br>
MS's home GPRS system will now be described.<br><br>
WO 2005/057980	20	PCT/US2004/040430<br>
[0066]	The UF proxies all IETF RADIUS attributes without modification.   The HF<br>
removes all 3GPP VSAs from the received RADIUS Access-Accept, before transmitting the RADRJS Access-Accept to the visited CDMA2000 packet data system.<br>
[0067]	If the policy of the home GPRS system requires the roaming MS's data traffic to<br>
traverse through the home GPRS system via the DF, and the HA-Address VSA was included in the corresponding RADIUS Access-Request received earlier from the visited CDMA2000 packet data system, the ITF includes the Reverse-Tunnel-Specification VSA in the transmitted RADRJS Access-Accept destined for the visited CDMA2000 packet data system. The value field of the VSA is set to 1 indicating that reverse tunneling is required.<br>
[0068]	The IIF requirements to process the RADIUS Accounting-Request START and<br>
Accounting-Request INTERIM are the same as the requirements to process the RADIUS Access-Request<br>
[0069]	The IDF requirements to process the RADRJS Accounting-Request STOP are the<br>
same as the requirements to process the RADRJS Access-Request with the following additional requirements: If the Session-continue VSA is set to FALSE in the received RADIUS Accounting-Request STOP, and if the ITF has not previously received an Accounting-Request (Start) from another PDSN with the same IP Address (for the case of inter-PDSN handoff with Mobile IP), the IIF inserts the 3GPP-Session-Stop-mdicator VSA to indicate that the PDP session has been terminated.<br>
CDMA2000 Packet Data Foreign Mode wife Simple IP<br>
[0070]	FIG. 5A is an exemplary block diagram of a CDMA2000 packet data foreign<br>
mode with Simple IP. This section describes the roaming scenario where a GPRS native subscriber operates IPv4 or IPv6 in the CDMA2000 packet data foreign mode. FIG. 5 A also depicts the functions and control interface provided by the interface 30 or 'TIF' in this case. In this embodiment, the home system 10 can be a GPRS system wherein a GPRS native subscriber roams to a CDMA 2000 packet data system and uses Mobile IPv4. The home system 10 comprises a GSM home location register 124, a GGSN 126, and an AAA entity 128. The visited system 20 can be a CDMA 2000 packet data system that comprises a ANSI-41 visited location register 111, an AAA entity 116, and a home system 109.<br><br>
WO 2005/057580	2|	PCTAJS2004/040430<br>
[0071]	The interface 30 or "HF" comprises an ANSI-41 home location register 131<br>
coupled to the ANSI-41 visited location register 111 via a D interface 113, a GSM<br>
visited location register 133 coupled to the GSM home location register 124 via a D<br>
interface 121, a SGSN 137 coupled to the GGSN 126 via a Gp interface 127, an AAA<br>
entity 140 coupled to the AAA entity 128 via a X4 interface 129 and coupled to the<br>
AAA entity 116 via a X3 interface 117, and a LCS entity 139 coupled to the packet data<br>
serving node/ LAC entity 109 via an X2 interface 119.  The IIF provides both GSM<br>
VLR and ANSI-41  HLR emulation to allow the subscriber to register.     This<br>
interworking can be provided over the interface reference "D". The IIF provides LNS<br>
and SGSN emulation to support bearer connectivity between the visited and home<br>
networks via the IIF.  This interworking can be provided over the interface reference<br>
"X2" and "Gn". The IIF provides AAA emulation to interact with the visited network's<br>
AAA for L2TP authentication and 3GPP2 packet data accounting.  The HF also may<br>
interact with the home network's AAA for 3GPP packet data accounting.    This<br>
interworking can be provided over the interface reference "X3" and "X4".    The<br>
HF/AAA requirements for CDMA2000 packet data foreign mode with Simple IP will be<br>
described below in greater detail<br>
[0072]	If bearer connectivity between the visited CDMA2000 packet data system and<br>
home GPRS system is not required, the X2 and Gp interface are not required. In this<br>
case, both mobile-originated and mobile-terminated data traffic is routed to/from the<br>
Internet via the PDSN in the visited system. The interface X3 and X4 are required for<br>
the HF to interwork AAA messages between the CDMA2000 AAA server and GPRS<br>
AAA server.<br>
[0073]	Thus, for a user homed in a GSM system roaming to a CDMA Simple IP<br>
system, the HF may present a L2TP Network Server (LNS) interface to the CDMA<br>
system and a SGSN interface to the GSM system. A subset of SGSN functions is<br>
required including APN resolution. The HF may serve as the endpoint for the Mobile<br>
L2TP and GTP tunnels, with a packet routing function between the LNS and SGSN<br>
functions.<br>
[0074]	FIG. 5B is an exemplary call flow diagram that shows Simple IP operation in the<br>
CDMA2000 packet data foreign mode. This call flow example illustrates a roaming scenario where a GPRS native subscriber operates Simple IP in the CDMA2000 packet data foreign mode. In this example, the MS has shared secrets with the home AAA in<br><br>
WO 2005/057980	22	PCT/US2004/040430<br>
the GPRS system for CHAP authentication. The home GPRS system dynamically<br>
assigns an IP address to the MS. All MS's data traffic (MS-originated and mobile-<br>
terminated) traverses through the EOF and home GPRS system. The IIF receives 3GPP2<br>
accounting records from the visited CDMA2000 system and maps it to 3GPP<br>
accounting records and forward it to the home GPRS system via RADIUS.<br>
[0075]	The MS   originates  SO  33  and initiates PPP  LCP negotiation with the<br>
PDSN/LAC. CHAP can be negotiated as the protocol for PPP authentication. (Step 1)<br>
PDSN/LAC sends a CHAP challenge to the MS. (Step 2) The MS replies with its NAI<br>
and a challenge response computed based on the challenge and the secret shared with<br>
the home AAA in the GPRS system. The PDSN/LAC sends RADIUS Access-Request.<br>
Because the domain name of the MS's NAI indicates a GPRS system, the RADIUS<br>
Access-Request can be routed through the visited AAA and DP that proxies the message<br>
to the home AAA in the GPRS system. The DF may modify the message in accordance<br>
with [3GPP TS 29.061]. (Step 3) If the authentication is successful, the home AAA<br>
responds with the RADIUS Access-Accept The message can be routed back to the<br>
PDSN/LAC via the DP and visited AAA. The IIF inserts the Tunnel-Server-Endpoint<br>
attribute in the RADIUS Access-Accept. This attribute informs the PDSN/LAC to<br>
establish a L2TP tunnel with the DP that acts as the LNS. The PDSN/LAC sends the<br>
CHAP Success to inform the MS about the successful authentication. (Step 4)<br>
[0076]	The PDSN/LAC establishes a L2TP tunnel/session with the DP that acts as the<br>
LNS. During the L2TP tunnel/session establishment, the PDSN/LAC forwards the LCP information (exchanged between the MS and PDSN/LAC) to the DP. The DP LNS functionality may initiate CHAP challenge (not shown in the figure) to authenticate the MS before IPCP negotiation. (Step 5) The DP SGSN functionality establishes GTP tunnels with a GGSN in the home GPRS system and can request an IP address from the GGSN. The DP derives an APN that has the format <network id>mnc<mnc>.mcc<mcc>.gprs. The <network id> is the realm portion of the MS's NAI and is used to indicate which GGSN the MS wants to access for the requested service. The <mnc> and <mcc> are derived from the MS's IMSL The MS's NAI and DMSI are available from the RADIUS Access-Request in step 3. The DP SGSN functionality uses the derived APN as the lookup name to query GPRS DNS server (not shown in the figure) and obtains a list of available GGSNs that can be used to support the requested service. The DP SGSN functionality sends the Create PDP<br><br>
WO 2005/057980	23	PCT/US2004/040430<br><br>
Context Request to the selected GGSN. The Requested PDP Address in the message is set to 0.0.0.0 to request a new IP address. (Step 6) The GGSN responds with the Create PDP Context Response including the new IP address assigned to the MS. (Step 7)<br>
[0077]	This new IP address can be assigned to the MS during the PPPIPCP negotiation<br>
between the IIF and MS. (Step 8) The PDSN/FA sends the RADIUS Accounting-Request (Start) containing 3GPP2 packet data accounting information [IS-835]. The PDSN sends the RADIUS Accounting-Request (Start) containing 3GPP2 packet data accounting information [P.S0001-A V3.0]. Because the domain name of the MS's NAI indicates a GPRS system, the RADRJS Accounting-Request (Start) is routed to the home AAA in the GPRS system via the visited AAA and DF. The HF may modify the message in accordance with [3GPP TS 29.061]. (Step 9) The home AAA replies with the RADIUS Accounting-Response (Start) that is routed back to the PDSN via EOF and visited AAA. (Step 10)<br>
[0078]	Bearer traffic traverses through the IIF in both directions.   For routing MS-<br>
originated  packets, the IIF routes packets received from the MS's L2TP tunnel/session to the MS's GTP tunnel (identified by a TEID). For rouing MS-terminated packets, the IIF routes packets received from the MS's GTP tunnel to the MS's L2Tptunnel/session IPsec can be used to protect the L2TP tunnel/session between PDSN/LAC and HF, and me GTP tunnels between IIF and GGSN. (Step 11)<br>
BF/AAA Requirements for CDMA2000 Packet Data Foreign Mode with Simple IP<br>
[0079]<br>
The EOF requirements to process the RADIUS Access-Request are the same as the requirements to process the RADIUS Access-Request for the CDMA2000 Packet Data Foreign Mode with Mobile IP, described above.<br>
[0080]<br>
The EOF requirements to process the RADIUS Access-Accept are similar to the requirements for processing the RADIUS Access-Accept for the CDMA2000 Packet Data Foreign Mode with Mobile IP, however, if the policy of the home GPRS system requires the roaming MS's data traffic to traverse through the home GPRS system v the DQP, and the HA-Address VSA was not included in the corresponding RADIUS Access-Request received earlier from the visited CDMA2000 packet data system, HF inserts   the Tunnel-Server-Endpoint,  Tunnel-Type,  and Tunnel-Medium-" attributes   in  the  transmitted  RADIUS   Access-Accept  destined  for the  v<br><br>
WO 2005/057980	24	PCT/US2004/040430<br>
CDMA2000 packet data system. The Tunnel-Server-Endpoint attribute indicates the IIF/LNS address. The Tunnel-Type attribute indicates L2TP. The Tunnel-Medium-Type attribute indicate IPv4.<br>
[0081]	The IIF requirements to process the RADIUS Accounting-Request START and<br>
Accounting-Request INTERIM are the same as the requirements to process the RADIUS Accounting-Request START and Accounting-Request INTERIM for the CDMA2000 Packet Data Foreign Mode wife Mobile IP, described above.<br>
[0082]	The IIF requirements to process the RADIUS Accounting-Request STOP are the<br>
substantially the same as the requirements to process the RADIUS Accounting-Request STOP for the CDMA2000 Packet Data Foreign Mode with Mobile IP, however, if the Session-Continue VSA is set to FALSE in the received RADIUS Accounting-Request STOP, and the IP-Technology VSA indicates Simple IP, the IIF inserts the 3GPP-Session-Stop-Indicator VSA to indicate that the PDP session has been terminated.<br>
