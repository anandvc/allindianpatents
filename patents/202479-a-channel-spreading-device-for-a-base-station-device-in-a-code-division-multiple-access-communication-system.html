				<td>DEVICE AND METHOD FOR SPREADING CHANNELS IN MOBILE<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present  invention relates  to a channel   spreading device  for a base station device  in a code division multiple access comnunication system<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a device and method for spreading channels in a CDMA communication system, and in particular, to a channel communication device and method for a CDMA communication system having different spreading rates.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In order to increase channel capacity, a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) communication system spreads channels using orthogonal codes. For example, a forward link of an IMT-2000 system performs channel spreading using orthogonal codes. An example of an orthogonal code that is typically used is a Walsh code.<br>
The number of available orthogonal codes is determined depending upon a modulation method and a minimum data rate. However, in the proposed IMT-2000 CDMA system, the channels assigned to the users will increase in number in order to improve system performance. To this end, the future CDMA system includes a plurality of common channels and dedicated channels, and assigns the channels to the mobile stations, thereby increasing channel capacity.<br>
However, even in the proposed IMT-2000 CDMA system, an increase in the utilization of the channels limits the number of available orthogonal codes. Further, the reduced number of available Walsh orthogonal codes limits the increase in channel capacity. In an effort to solve this problem, there is proposed a method for using quasi-orthogonal codes for channel spreading codes which have a minimum interference with the orthogonal codes and have a variable data rate.<br>
In the IMT-2000 system, a lx system uses a spreading code group having a spreading code rate  1, and a 3x system uses a spreading code group having a<br><br>
-3-<br>
spreading code rate 3. In this case, the lx system has spreading codes with a maximum length of 128 as shown in FIG. 1A, and spreads code symbols by selecting a spreading code corresponding to a designated spreading code index. Further, the 3x system includes spreading codes with a maximum length of 256 as shown in FIG. IB, and spreads the code symbols by selecting a spreading code corresponding to a designated spreading code index.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 2, there is shown the channel characteristics at a frequency band of a multi-carrier mobile communication system. The lx system uses a single carrier whose channel band is 1.25MHz, and the 3x system uses 3 carriers, each distributed to a different channel band and having a combined channel band of 3.75MHz. A unique orthogonal code is assigned to each carrier. When the lx system is overlaid with the 3x system as shown in FIG. 2, it is not possible to guarantee a correlation property between a spreading code of length 128 using a mask function at a spreading rate 1 and a spreading code of length 128 using a mask function at a spreading rate 3, at each 1.25MHz band. Therefore, interference may increase between a user using the mask function at the spreading rate lx and another user using the mask function at the spreading rate 3x.<br>
A problem concerning the correlation property will be described with reference to FIG. 3. FIG. 3 is a diagram for explaining the mutual interference between a user of the lx system using a quasi-orthogonal code and a user of the 3x system using an orthogonal code.<br>
In FIG. 3, T1 denotes the number of chips into which the quasi-orthogonal code user of the lx system spreads one symbol, and T2 denotes the number of chip's into which the orthogonal code user of the 3x system spreads one symbol. Interference that the quasi-orthogonal code (Qm+WjJ user of the lx system, experiences from the orthogonal code (Wj) user of the 3x system can be given by the equation:<br><br>
That is, the interference satisfies an upper limit formula of the correlation for<br><br>
-4-<br>
the quasi-orthogonal code. Therefore, in this case, there is no serious matter.<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram for explaining mutual interference between channels each using quasi-orthogonal codes of different lengths. In FIG. 4, lx denotes a user using a quasi-orthogonal code of length 128 and 3x denotes a user using a quasi-orthogonal code of length 256. In this case, interference that the quasi-orthogonal code (Qm+Wk) user of the lx system experiences from the quasi-orthogonal code (Qn+Wk) user of the 3x system does not satisfy the upper limit formula, as shown in Equation (2) below:<br><br>
In this case, the mutual interference between the channels increases.<br>
Therefore, when using the quasi-orthogonal codes of spreading code groups having different lengths, the mobile communication system stores the spreading codes of different lengths, and thus increases the hardware complexity. Further, using the spreading codes having different spreading rates deteriorates the interference property between two users thereby causing performance degradation<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a communication device and method for a CDMA communication system wherein a base station device spreads and despreads channel signals using spreading codes having the same length as those of mobile stations having different spreading rates.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a communication device and method for a CDMA communication system wherein a mobile station spreads and despreads channel signals using spreading codes having the same length as those of base stations having different spreading rates.<br>
To achieve the above objects, there is provided a channel spreading device<br><br>
-5-<br>
for a base station device in a CDMA communication system for spreading input symbols using a first quasi-orthogonal code having a first length or channel spreading the input symbols using a second quasi-orthogonal code having a second length which is a multiple of the first length. The device comprises a spreading code generator for generating the second quasi-orthogonal code; a channel spreader for providing a plurality of durations by dividing a duration of the second quasi-orthogonal code by the multiple of the length of the first quasi-orthogonal code, and spreading channel coded symbols with the quasi-orthogonal codes having the plurality of durations described above; and a PN spreader for spreading the channel spread signal with a PN code.<br>
The spreading code generator comprises a controller for generating a mask index and a Walsh code index corresponding to a received index for generating the second quasi-orthogonal code; a mask generator for generating a mask of the second quasi-orthogonal code corresponding to the mask index; a Walsh code generator for generating a Walsh code corresponding to the Walsh code index; and a circuit for mixing the mask of the second quasi-orthogonal code with the Walsh code to generate the second quasi-orthogonal code to use as the spreading code.<br>
When the length of the second quasi-orthogonal code is 2 times the length of the first quasi-orthogonal code, the channel spreader spreads, at a spreading rate of the first quasi-orthogonal code, one symbol with a first half-period chip signal of the second quasi-orthogonal code output from the spreading code generator and another symbol with a second half-period chip signal of the second quasi-orthogonal code, whereby two symbols are spread at a duration of one spreading code.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described herein below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
In the following description, the term "orthogonal spreading" will be used interchangeably with the terms "channel spreading", "short code spreading", "spreading" and "PN spreading". Further, the term "spreading codes of the same length" refers to a set of quasi-orthogonal codes having the same length. In addition, the term "spreading code" refers to a Walsh orthogonal code or quasi-orthogonal code.<br><br>
-7-<br>
Although an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to a spreading and despreading operation of an IMT-2000 base station and mobile station in which a lx system and a 3x system use the same spreading codes, it is also possible to apply the invention to the systems using different data rates. That is, the embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the case where a base station spreads channel signals using spreading codes of the same length and transmits the spread channel signals to mobile stations having different spreading rates, and the mobile stations then despread the transmitted spread channel signals. Alternatively, the invention can be equally applied to the case where a mobile station spreads channel signals using spreading codes of the same length and transmits the spread channel signals to base stations having different spreading rates, and the base stations then despread the transmitted spread channel signals,<br>
In the embodiment, the lx system and the 3x system share the spreading codes. It is possible to reduce the hardware complexity by allowing several Nx systems to share quasi-orthogonal sequences of the longest length. In addition, when the several Nx systems are used and each system uses spreading codes of the same length, it is possible to reduce interference between the users at the lx 1.25MHz band.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, there, is shown a diagram for explaining an operation of channel spreading symbols of different lengths using the spreading codes of the same length according to an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 5 shows a method for using the spreading codes, when an Nx system using spreading codes of length A and a Mx system using spreading codes of length B (where A&gt;B) share the spreading codes of length A. More specifically, FIG. 5 shows a case where a lx system using spreading codes of maximum length 128 and a 3x system using spreading codes of maximum length 256 share the spreading codes of length 256, by way of example. In this manner, it is possible to solve the problems that occur when using the spreading codes in the prior art.<br>
FIG. 6 is a diagram for explaining the mutual interference between the lx system using the quasi-orthogonal codes and the 3x system using the quasi-orthogonal codes. In FIG. 6, Tj denotes the number of chips into which the quasi-orthogonal code user of the  lx system spreads one symbol, and T2 denotes the<br><br>
-8-<br>
number of chips into which the quasi-orthogonal code user of the 3x system spreads one symbol.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, interference that the quasi-orthogonal code (Qm+Wk) user of the Ix system experiences from the quasi-orthogonal code (Qm+Wj) user of the 3x system can be given by the equation;<br><br>
That is, since the interference is 0, there is no interference. Therefore, it is possible to solve the interference problem of the prior art<br>
Therefore, in the embodiment, it is possible to reduce the mutual interference between the users while decreasing the hardware complexity by allowing several Nx systems to share the spreading codes. Tables 1 and 2 below show quasi-orthogonal sequences of length 128 for use in the Ix system and quasi-orthogonal sequences of length 256 for use in the 3x system, by way of example. The Ix system and the 3x system can share either masks of length 128 shown in Table 1 or masks of length 256 shown in Table 2.<br><br>

When the lx system and 3x system share the spreading codes of length 256, the 3x system, which originally uses the spreading codes of length 256, has the existing structure. Therefore, in the embodiment, a description will be made regarding only the structure of the lx system when using the spreading codes of length 256, in which a spreading factor is assumed to be 128 which is the highest one in the lx system.<br>
A. Embodiment of Transmitter<br>
In the transmitter described below, it is assumed that the lx system spreads one symbol into 128 chip length and the 3x system spreads one symbol into 256 chip length. Further, it is assumed that the lx system and the 3x system share the spreading codes of length 256.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 7, there is shown a structure of a lx system transmitter. A channel coder 700 codes an input signal into symbol data and an interleaver 705 interleaves the coded symbols output from channel coder 700. The coded symbols interleaved by the interleaver 705 are provided to a long code scrambler 710. A long code generator 715 generates a long code for scrambling the interleaved channel signal. Thus, the long code scrambler 710 spreads the interleaved symbols with the long code. An exclusive OR gate is typically used for the long code scrambler 710, and in this case, the long code scrambler 710 exclusively ORs the channel coded signal and the long code to generate scrambled symbols. The scrambled symbols are provided to a channel spreader (or orthogonal modulator) 720 after separation into I-component symbols and Q-component symbols.<br>
At the same time, a spreading code index k indicating a channel assigned to the user is input to a spreading code generator 740. As stated above, a Walsh code or a quasi-orthogonal code is typically used for the spreading code. With regard to<br><br>
10<br>
operation of the spreading code generator 740, upon receipt of the spreading code index k, an index controller 742 outputs a mask index and a Walsh orthogonal code index corresponding to the received spreading code index k. Here, the mask refers to a mask for a quasi-orthogonal code. Upon receipt of the mask index, a mask generator 744 accesses a mask of length 256 corresponding to the input mask index from a mask table. At the same time, upon receipt of the Walsh orthogonal code index output from the index controller 742, a Walsh orthogonal code generator 746 accesses an Walsh orthogonal code of length 256 corresponding to the received Walsh orthogonal code index from a Walsh orthogonal code table. An adder 748 then adds the quasi-orthogonal code mask of length 256 output from the mask generator 744 and the Walsh orthogonal code of length 256 chips output from the Walsh orthogonal code generator 746, to generate a quasi-orthogonal code. The generated quasi-orthogonal code is used as a spreading code corresponding to the spreading code index k, and this spreading code is provided to the channel spreader 720. Here, when no mask index is provided to the mask generator 744 (i.e., a mask index value=0), the mask generator 744 outputs no quasi-orthogonal code mask. In this case, the spreading code output from the adder 748 becomes the Walsh orthogonal code.<br>
The generated spreading codes of length 256 are input to the channel spreader 720 along with the long code spread symbols (i.e., the symbols scrambled with the long code). At this point, the one symbol is spread with the spreading codes of the specific number of chips (256/2n, l<n in the embodiment n="l." that is for lx system which spreads a symbol into chip length one at first half duration and another second duration. therefore two symbols are spread thus channel spreader received with spreading code output from generator rate of signals provided to pn generates outputs it then on unit basis signals.></n>
Spreading code generators 840, 842, 844, 940, 140, 142 and 144, which will be described with reference to FIGS. 8 to 10, may have the same structure as the<br><br>
-11-<br>
spreading code generator 740 of FIG. 7.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 8, there is shown a structure of a multi-carrier 3x system transmitter. Upon receipt of an input signal, a channel coder 800 codes the input signal into symbol data, and an interleaver 805 interleaves the coded symbols. The symbols interleaved by the interleaver 805 are provided to a long code scrambler 810, and a long code generator 815 generates a long code for scrambling the symbols. The long code scrambler 810 then spreads the interleaved symbols with the long code to scramble the symbols.<br>
The scrambled symbols are demultiplexed into three groups by a demultiplexer 880 and then provided to channel spreaders 820, 822 and 824 after separation into I components and Q components. Here, the scrambled symbols are demultiplexed into three groups in order to transmit the channel signal using three carriers of the 3x system.<br>
Upon receipt of a spreading code index kl indicating a channel assigned to the user, the spreading code generator 840 generates a spreading code of length 256 corresponding to the received spreading code index kl. Upon receipt of the demultiplexed signals, channel spreader 820 spreads the scrambled symbols with the spreading code. At this point, the channel spreader 820 spreads one symbol with the specific number of chips (256/2", 0<n at the chip rate of in embodiment n="0." therefore channel spreader spreads one symbol duration spreading code. spread signals are provided to a pn and code generator generates then with output from on unit basis signals.></n>
In the same manner, the channel spreaders 822 and 824 spread received symbols with the corresponding spreading codes, and the PN spreaders 832 and 834 spread the received channel spread signals with the PN code. The spreading code generators 840, 842 and 844 generate different spreading codes, whereas the PN code generators 850, 852 and 854 generate the same PN code. Further, the signals output from the PN spreaders 830, 832 and 834 are transmitted on the corresponding carriers<br><br>
12<br>
after frequency up-conversion.<br>
In FIGS. 7 and 8, the lx system uses the spreading code of chip length 128 and the 3x system uses the spreading code of chip length 256, as shown in FIG. 4. When the quasi-orthogonal code is used for the spreading code, channel interference may occur between the lx system and the 3x system. In this case, in the lx system, the spreading code generator generates the spreading code of 256-chip length, and the channel spreader spreads one symbol with the 128 first half chips and spreads another symbol with the 128 second half chips, as shown in FIG. 5. Therefore, the channel spreader of the lx system channel spreads two symbols at one-spreading code duration. Further, in the 3x system, the spreading code generator also generates the spreading code of 256-chip length and the channel spreader spreads one symbol at 256-chip spreading code duration, as shown in FIG. 5.<br>
Herein, although the 3x system is a multi-carrier system, the invention can be equally applied to the case where the 3x system is a single-carrier system. In this case, the 3x system has the same channel structure as the lx system and the chip rate becomes 3 times higher.<br>
B. Embodiment of Receiver<br>
Referring now to FIG. 9, there is shown a receiver for the lx system. A PN despreader 930 receives input spread signals and a PN code generator 950 generates a PN code at 1.2288Mcps. The PN despreader 930 PN despreads the received spread signals with the PN code output from the PN code generator 950 on a chip unit basis. The PN desprcad signals are provided to a channel despreader 920. At this point, upon receipt of a spreading code index k indicating a channel assigned to the user, a spreading code generator 940 generates a spreading code of maximum length 256 corresponding to the received spreading code index k in the same manner as the spreading code generator 740 of FIG. 7. The channel despreader 920 then despreads the PN despread symbols with the spreading code of the specific number of chips (256/2n, l<n that is when the transmitter for lx system of fig. spreads two symbols at duration before transmission channel despreader despreads symbol spread first half and other second duration. upon receipt despread signals a></n><br>
-13-<br>
long code descrambler 910 descrambles the despread signals with a long code output from a long code generator 915. The descrambled signals are deinterleaved by a deinterleaver 905 and then decoded by a channel decoder 900.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 10, there is shown the structure of a receiver for the multi-carrier 3x system.    A PN despreader 130 receives input spread signals, and a PN code generator 150 generates a PN code at a chip rate of 1.2288Mcps. The PN despreader 130 then PN despreads the received spread signals with the PN code. The PN despread signals are applied to a channel despreader 120, and a spreading code generator 140 generates a spreading code of maximum length 256 corresponding to a spreading code index kl indicating a channel assigned to the user. The channel despreader 120 then channel despreads the PN despread signals with the spreading code. At this point, the channel despreader 120 despreads the PN despread symbols with the spreading code of the specific number of chips (256/2", 0<n and provides the despread signals to a multiplexer after accumulation. in system since n-0 one symbol is at duration. same manner input pn despreaders are also applied through process. then multiplexes which were different paths reverse order of demultiplexing. upon receipt multiplexed long code descrambler descrambles received with output from generator thereafter descrambled deinterleaved by deinterleaver decoded channel decoder></n>
Therefore, in the lx system, the spreading code generator generates a spreading code of 256-chip length, and the channel despreader despreads one symbol with the 128 first haft chips and spreads another symbol with the 128 second half chips, as shown in FIG. 5. The channel despreader of the lx system channel thus despreads two symbols during one spreading code duration. Further, in the 3x system, the spreading code generator also generates the spreading code of 256-chip length and the channel despreader despreads one symbol at 256-chip spreading code duration, as shown in FIG. 5.<br>
The novel spreading device for a CDMA communication system enables two users having different spreading rates to use the same spreading code, thereby<br><br>
