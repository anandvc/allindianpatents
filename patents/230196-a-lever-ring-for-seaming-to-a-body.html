				<td>Lever Ring with Inclined Flat Web<br>
The invention is concerned with a special shaping of a lever ring for<br>
optimizing the action of force of the closure layer that acts as an archable<br>
membrane, the action of force being optimized in a bonding strip, in<br>
particular a sealing seam, in order to increase the toughness or stability of<br>
the seam with respect to an existing internal pressure, with the package<br>
being closed. Other actions of force can also be better absorbed by this.<br>
Starting from the customary design of a lever ring, cf. e.g. EP-A 402 268<br>
(CMB) or WO-A 97/49510 (Impress), Fig. 4 thereof, or GB-A 2 022 474<br>
(Swiss Aluminium), which comprises a lid rim at the outside and a<br>
horizontally aligned flat web at the inside, the hold (the bonding) of a<br>
membrane-like sealing film sealed onto this flat web is to be improved. In a<br>
normal condition, the lever ring is at first closed with a sealing folm at the<br>
inside. Due to this, a continuous sealing seam of a certain width is formed,<br>
which extends clearly on the flat web. Here, the holding forces for the<br>
closure layer are applied, which is slightly arched by the developing internal<br>
pressure, which puts a stress on the sealing seam at the bonding site<br>
beginning at the inside in a notch-like fashion, but preferably not that high<br>
that a limit of cohesive forces is exceeded.<br>
Inclined lid rims have also become known in the remaining prior art, so far<br>
in the case of push-in lids, cf. in this connection DE-A 28 30 614 (Officine<br>
Monfalconese) or WO-A 00/21840 (Brasilata Metallicas).<br><br>
US 5069 355 - does not teach of the ledge portion being slanted upwards at<br>
an angle differing from zero and it also does make a mention of end member<br>
to have a lever or lid ring shape type.<br>
WO 02/00512 - discloses an annular flange in no more than a portion of the<br>
lid. Thus, the whole device is a lid and no lever ring as claimed.<br>
The invention starts from the technical problem of increasing a holding force<br>
on the flat web without having to implement additional changes in the<br>
consistency or the strength or width of the sealing zone.<br><br>
The invention suggests not to align the flat web substantially horizontally, but to have it<br>
extend in an inclined fashion at an angle, that plane being used as the reference plane<br>
which results in the case of a closure layer that is connected by means of sealing. Due<br>
to this, the flat web is upwardly angled, a large range of angles being at first possible,<br>
between more than 10° and up to substantially 90°, based on said plane. However, the<br>
closure layer must not already be connected by means of sealing, but the lever ring is<br>
also circumscribed and subjected to stress so that the closure layer as such has not<br>
been connected by means of sealing as yet but hypothetically serves as a<br>
measure as to which plane is used as a comparative plane. This plane can also be<br>
considered as a "horizontal" if the lever ring is placed onto a surface.<br>
Ranges of the angular extension (of the inclined extension) of the flat web of more than<br>
10°, in the range of between 25° and 35° and between 40° and 60° or, however,<br>
substantially vertically or between 80° and 90° are preferred.<br>
If the flat web is inclined, a wedge-shaped groove results between a continuous wall<br>
which, in its capacity as the core wall, leads to the container rim, and the inclined flat<br>
web. This wedge-shaped design has two walls that do not extend in parallel and a<br>
rounded bottom area which extends as a continuous groove and forms the lowermost<br>
point of the lever ring, seen in the axial direction.<br>
The container rim is a structure that extends around the circumference and arches<br>
towards the outside and downwards and is suited for the seaming of the lever ring to a<br>
body hook of a body. A double seam can be used as the seam. Mostly, the lever ring is<br>
at first sealed with the closure layer, delivered in this prefabricated form and the body is<br>
filled with the products to be packaged at the filling plant in order to subsequently cover<br>
it jointly with the lever ring and the closure layer and then to form the double seam at<br>
the edge. At least one or several shackles may be provided at a suitable point on the<br>
edge of the closure layer, which serve(s) for peeling off and starting to undo the sealing<br>
seam at this point. The entire sealing seam is continuously undone around the<br>
circumference and opens the inner space in order to grant access to the packaged<br>
product.<br>
A curling of the edge may be provided on the inner side of the flat web that is aligned in<br>
an inclined fashion It forms a deflection point for the closure layer which is<br>
aligned as of this inner curling in a plane position (without stress by the internal<br>
pressure), whereas the edge of this closure layer is inclined in accordance with the<br>
alignment of the flat web and extends thereon across the sealing seam (the bonding<br><br>
strip) in a peelably attached fashion. Due to this deflection, pressure forces within the<br>
closed container, which act on the closure layer, are at least partly converted to such<br>
forces which are developed as tensile forces in the extension direction of the sealing<br>
seam. A substantially greater force can be applied in this direction, since the entire<br>
width of the sealing seam withstands this tensile force. Pure tensile forces that are<br>
developed vertically to the sealing seam and that are e.g. present during the peeling off<br>
or opening of the closure can be reduced for the closed condition. Due to this, the point<br>
in time can be delayed at which the cohesive effect of the sealing seam breaks, the so-<br>
called cohesive failure, which, instead of at 25 N, can be shifted to higher ranges, up to<br>
40 N. In the case of substantially 90° 50 N are even achieved up to failure.<br>
Metallic films can be used as a closure layer, but also plastic films, which are sealed in<br>
the marginal area. Compound films (several layers) or metallized films are likewise<br>
possible, which must be applied by means of sealing. A sealing strip on the flat web,<br>
which is separately applied offers itself as a sealing surface, if a metallic closure layer is<br>
used as the film. It has a substantial width, which amounts to more than half, preferably<br>
substantially the entire extension of the flat web <br>
If a flat web aligned substantially vertically (to the horizontal plane of the closure layer)<br>
is used, the internal edge curling can even axially project above the upper side of the lid<br>
rim for the seam <br><br>
Examples explain and supplement the invention.<br>
Fig. 1	illustrates a cutout from a lever ring which is shown as an axial section.<br>
Fig. 2	illustrates an alternative embodiment with a flat web that is differently<br>
inclined.<br>
Fig. 3	illustrates a third embodiment with a flat web which again extends again<br>
in a different way, once more at a flatter inclination.<br>
Fig. 4a,<br>
Fig. 4b	illustrate differences between tensile forces and shearing forces at a<br>
pressure load from the interior to the inner side of the closure layer 1,<br>
the pressure load being designated with F1.<br>
A cut out of a lever ring is shown in Fig. 1, which is closed with a film 1 in the closed<br>
condition, which may be of many alternative designs, it can e.g. be made of plastic<br>
material or metal or a composite of such layers.<br>
A lid rim 2 is provided in the marginal area of the lid closed with the film, which is of a<br>
substantially U-shaped shape. A U-shaped shape with a different orientation is found in<br>
a groove N1 which is formed between the inner wall of the lid rim as the chuck wall and<br>
a flat web 3a which extends upwards. The edge area of the closure layer 1 is closed<br>
with a sealing layer that is not especially represented here on the axial outer side of the<br>
flat web. As regards the design of the sealing layer reference is made to Fig. 4b by way<br>
of example, which shows this sealing layer 30 as an adhesive layer, e.g. of adhesive or<br>
another suitable, adhesive and food-compatible material.<br>
The body is symbolically shown as a trough 20 which has an obliquely projecting edge<br>
21 over which, upon closing, the lid rim 2 is slipped in order to be subsequently<br>
converted into a double seam by means of a closing machine and a seam roller so that<br>
the body 20 is thus closed. The container wall 22 of the body is shown in a vertically<br>
projecting fashion, which defines the height of the volume of the body 20 to be received.<br>
An inner curling 4 is provided at the inner side of the flat web 3a, the exact design of<br>
which can also be gathered from Fig. 4a, 4b. It avoids risks of cutting and provides for a<br>
deflection u of the closure layer 1 between a sealing section in its marginal area 1b and<br><br>
a plane section which projects above the entire inner space within the lid rim 4 in a self-<br>
supported fashion and closes it.<br>
The inclination of the flat web 3a is indicated with approx. 90° as the angle α1 in the<br>
example of embodiment of Fig. 1. The alignment of the flat web is thus substantially<br>
vertically to the plane which is given by the inner area of the closure layer 1. In this<br>
example, the inner rim 4 slightly projects axially beyond the upper side of the external lid<br>
rim 2 so that the closure layer 1 projects upwards beyond this outer side.<br>
An alternative inclination α2 is shown for the flat web 3b in Fig. 2. This angle is in the<br>
range between 40° and 60°, oriented by the described plane of the membrane 1 which<br>
is drawn very thinly here with the thickness d. As opposed to the thickness of this<br>
closure layer 1, the sheet metal in the lever ring is designed thicker so that the formed<br>
geometries are maintained during normal use with the exception of the reshaping of the<br>
lid rim 2 when forming the seam with the body hook 21 of the body 20.<br>
The smaller inclination α2 that is drawn in Fig. 2 as compared with Fig. 1, based on the<br>
flat web 3b, results in another cross-sectional shape of the circumferential groove N2<br>
which extends substantially in wedge-shaped fashion and has a rounded groove<br>
bottom. This groove bottom forms the lowermost point of the lever ring which, as such,<br>
can be designed in a round, oval, oblong, or rectangular shape with slightly rounded<br>
inner corners, if the formation of an inner curling 4 is also made possible in these inner<br>
corner areas.<br>
A still further design is shown in Fig. 3, where a flatter alignment α3 of the flat web 3c is<br>
selected in the range between 25° and 35°. All other features of the preceding<br>
description of Fig. 2 are also complied with. Here, as well, the inner curling 4 serves as<br>
a deflection point for the membrane in the area between the sealing point 30, 1 b that<br>
extends circumferentially and the inner surface 1 for covering the opening within the<br>
inner curling 4.<br>
The angle a3 can be further reduced up to about 10° in further examples, which are not<br>
separately represented, however, it should be more than 0° and thus form an oblique<br>
(inclined) design as compared with the described plane of the closure membrane 1.<br>
Due to the different orientation of the flat web which is not horizontally aligned due to its<br>
name, but is of a flat design across a clear width in order to produce a flat sealing seam<br>
onto which the membrane can be attached sufficiently well and tightly, there are<br><br>
different designs for the shape of the circumferential groove N2, N3 with a wall which, in<br>
each case, extends more flatly towards the inside, but with a substantially equal slope of<br>
the core wall towards the lid rim 2.<br>
Due to the inclination of the flat web which is shown by way of example by means of the<br>
examples a1, a2, a3, a system according to Fig. 4b is obtained. An internal pressure on<br>
the self-supporting inner surface of membrane 1 is deflected by the inner rim 4 and<br>
provides for a tensile force in the sealing area 30. The entire width of the sealing seam<br>
30, the section of which is represented in Fig. 4b, can withstand this tensile force z,<br>
namely better than if a horizontal alignment of the flat web according to Fig. 4a were<br>
chosen. Here, the pressure force F1 acts on the membrane 1 so that a notch effect x is<br>
formed at the point 31 of the sealing seam 30 due to a vertical tensile force X, which,<br>
due to the forces applied substantially vertically to the extension of the sealing strip 30,<br>
results more easily in a loss of the cohesive effect and thus in a cohesive failure than it<br>
was described in Fig. 4b.<br>
The greater the inclination of the flat web 32 is, the greater is the conversion of the<br>
forces extending vertically to the sealing seam 30 according to Fig. 4a to such forces<br>
that can be called per se "shearing forces". Peeling forces (vertical tensile forces) are<br>
converted to such forces extending in parallel to 30, which can be better absorbed by<br>
the entire width of the sealing seam 30 according to Fig. 4b than the tensile forces X<br>
according to Fig. 4a, which have a notch effect.<br><br>
