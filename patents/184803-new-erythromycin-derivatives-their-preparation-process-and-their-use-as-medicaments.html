				<td>their use as medicaments.<br>
The present invention relates to new erythromycin<br>
derivatives, their preparation process and their use as<br>
medicaments.<br>
A subject of the invention is the compounds of<br>
formula (I):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
in which R and R1 represent a hydroxyl or 0-acyl radical<br>
containing 2 to 20 carbon atoms,<br>
R2 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl radical,<br>
R3 is:<br>
either a-(CH2)mR4 radical in which m is an integer from 1 to<br>
6,<br>
A B<br>
or a-(CH2)n-C=C-(CH2)pR4 radical in which n and p identical<br>
or different represent an integer from 0 to 6,<br>
and either A and B identical or different represent a<br>
hydrogen atom or a halogen atom or an alkyl radical<br>
containing up to 8 carbon atoms, the geometry of the double<br>
bond being E or Z or an E+Z mixture,<br>
or A and B form with the carbon atoms to which they are<br>
linked a triple bond,<br>
or an -N-(CH2)qR4 radical in which q represents an integer<br>
from 0 to 6, R4 being an optionally substituted mono or<br>
polycyclic, heterocyclic radical, as well as their addition<br>
salts with acids.<br>
As an example of the addition salts of the present<br>
derivatives with mineral or organic acids, there can be<br>
mentioned the salts formed with the following acids: acetic,<br>
propionic, trifluoroacetic, maleic, tartaric,<br>
methanesulphonic, benzenesulphonic, p-toluenesulphonic,<br>
hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulphuric, phosphoric<br>
and especially stearic, ethylsuccinic and laurylsulphonic.<br>
The acyl radical is preferably an acetyl, propionyl,<br>
butyryl, isobutyryl, n-valeryl, isovaleryl, tert-valeryl,<br>
pivalyl or phenylmethoxycarbonyl radical.<br>
The heterocyclic radical contains one or more<br>
heteroatoms preferably chosen from oxygen, sulphur and<br>
nitrogen.<br>
The heterocyclic radical can be a radical with 5<br>
members, preferably the thienyl, furyl, pyrolyl, thiazolyl,<br>
oxazolyl, imidazolyl, thiadiazolyl, pyrazolyl, isoxazolyl or<br>
triazolyl radical,<br>
the heterocyclic radical can be a radical with 6 members,<br>
preferably a pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl or pyrazinyl<br>
radical,<br>
the heterocyclic radical can also be a condensed radical such<br>
as for example the benzimidazolyl, indolyl, benzofuranyl,<br>
benzothiazolyl or quinolinyl radical.<br>
When the heterocyclic radical is substituted, it is<br>
preferably by one or more substituents choosen from halogen<br>
atoms, hydroxy, alkyl, alkyloxy, aryl, aryloxy radicals<br>
containing up to 18 carbon atoms.<br>
A particular subject of the invention is the<br>
compounds of formula (I) as defined above, in which R and R1<br>
represent a hydroxyl radical, those in which R2 represents a<br>
methyl radical, those in which R3 represents a (CH2)mR4<br>
radical, m and R4 retaining their previous meaning and in<br>
particular those in which m represents the value 4.<br>
Also a particular subject of the invention is the<br>
compounds of formula (I) in which R3 is an N(CH2)qR4 radical,<br>
q and R4 retaining their previous meaning and in particular<br>
in which q represents the value 3.<br>
A more particular subject of the invention is the<br>
compounds of formula (I) in which the heterocycle radical R4<br>
contains at least one nitrogen atom, in particular those in<br>
which the heterocyclic radical is an optionally substituted<br>
imidazolyl, pyridinyl, thiazolyl, quinolinyl or<br>
azabenzimidazolyl radical, and more especially a 4-phenyl 1Himidazolyl<br>
or 4-quinolinyl radical.<br>
A quite particular subject of the invention is the<br>
compounds of formula (I) the preparation of which is given<br>
hereafter in the experimental part and quite especially the<br>
products of Examples 1, 2, 3 and 4.<br>
Also a subject of the invention is a preparation<br>
process for the compounds of formula (I), characterized in<br>
that a compound of formula (II):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
in which R2 retains its previous meaning, Bn represents a<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl radical and Ac an acyl radical as defined<br>
above, is subjected to the action of a compound of formula<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
in which R3 retains its previous meaning in order to obtain<br>
the compounds of formula (IV):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
which are subjected, if desired, to the action of an agent<br>
which cleaves the ester function in position 2' in order to<br>
obtain the compound of formula (I) in which R^ is an OH<br>
radical, then if desired the compound thus obtained is<br>
subjected to the action of a reduction agent in order to<br>
carry out the cleavage of the benzyloxy carbonyl group in<br>
position 4" and to obtain the product of formula (I) in which<br>
R represents an OH radical then, if desired, the compound of<br>
formula (I) is subjected to the action of an acid to form the<br>
corresponding salt.<br>
The compounds of formula (II) used as starting products<br>
are known products described in the Patent 0,248,279.<br>
The amines of formula (III) are known in a general<br>
manner and can be prepared according to the processes<br>
described in J. Med. Chem. (1982) Vol. 25, p. 947 and<br>
subsequent or also Tetrahedron Letters Vol. 32 No. 14,<br>
p. 1699, 1702 (1991).<br>
The cleavage of the acetate in position 2' is carried<br>
out using methanol or aqueous hydrochloric acid.<br>
The cleavage of the benzyloxycarbonyl group in<br>
position 4" is carried out by reduction, for example by means<br>
of hydrogen in the presence of a palladium catalyst.<br>
The salification is carried out by means of an acid<br>
according to standard processes.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) in which R3 is an-N(CH2)qR4<br>
radical can be prepared by the action of hydrazine hydrate on<br>
the product of formula (II) in order to obtain the compound<br>
of formula (P), that is to say a product of formula (I), in<br>
which R3 represents NH2/ which is subjected to the action of<br>
an aldehyde R4 (CH2)c,_iCHO, in order to obtain the<br>
corresponding compound of formula (I). The compound of<br>
formula (P) is a product of the invention as a new chemical<br>
product.<br>
The products of general formula (I) have a very good<br>
antibiotic activity on gram ® bacteria such as staphylococci,<br>
streptococci, pneumococci.<br>
The compounds of the invention can therefore be used as<br>
medicaments in the treatment of infections caused by<br>
susceptible germs and in particular, in that of<br>
staphylococcal infections, such as staphylococcal<br>
septicemias, malignant staphylococcal infections of the face<br>
or skin, pyodermatitis, septic or suppurating wounds, boils,<br>
anthrax, phlegmons, erysipelas and acne, staphylococcal<br>
infections such as acute primary or post-influenzal angina,<br>
bronchopneumonia, pulmonary suppuration, streptococcal<br>
infections such as acute anginas, otitis, sinusitis, scarlet<br>
fever, pneumococcal infections such as pneumonia, bronchitis;<br>
brucellosis, diphtheria, gonococcal infection.<br>
The products of the present invention are also active<br>
against infections caused by germs such as Haemophilus<br>
influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Rickettsies, Mycoplasma<br>
pneuraoniae, Chlamydia, Legionella, Ureaplasma, Toxoplasma or<br>
by germs of the Mycobacterium genus.<br>
Therefore a subject of the present invention is also, as<br>
as medicaments and in particular antibiotic medicaments, the<br>
products of formula (I) as defined above, as well as their<br>
addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable mineral or<br>
organic acids.<br>
A more particular subject of the invention is, as<br>
medicaments and in particular antibiotic medicaments, the<br>
preferred products of formula (I) defined previously namely<br>
the products of Examples 1, 2, 3 and 4, as well as their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
Also a subject of the invention is the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions containing as active ingredient at least one of<br>
the medicaments defined above.<br>
These compositions can be administered by buccal,<br>
rectal, parenteral route or by local route as a topical<br>
application on the skin and mucous membranes, but the<br>
preferred administration route is the buccal route.<br>
They can be solid or liquid and be presented in the<br>
pharmaceutical forms currently used in human medicine, such<br>
as for example, plain or sugar-coated tablets, capsules,<br>
granules, suppositories, injectable preparations, ointments,<br>
creams, gels; they are prepared according to the usual<br>
methods. The active ingredient or ingredients can be<br>
incorporated with excipients usually employed in these<br>
pharmaceutical compositions, such as talc, gum arabic,<br>
lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, cocoa butter, aqueous or<br>
non-aqueous vehicles, fatty substances of animal or vegetable<br>
origin, paraffin derivatives, glycols, various wetting,<br>
dispersing or emulsifying agents, preservatives.<br>
These compositions can also be presented in the form of<br>
a powder intended to be dissolved extemporaneously in an<br>
appropriate vehicle, for example apyrogenic sterile water.<br>
The dose administered is variable according to illness<br>
treated, the patient in question, the administration route<br>
and the product considered. It can be, for example, comprised<br>
between 50 mg and 300 mg per day by oral route, in an adult<br>
for the product of Example 4 or 2.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention without<br>
however limiting it.<br>
