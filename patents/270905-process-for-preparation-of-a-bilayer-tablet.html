3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition in the form of a tablet comprising two discrete layers wherein the first sustained release layer is prepared by granulation of a therapeutically effective amount of antibiotic preferably Cloxacillin or Dicloxacillin or its pharmaceutical!}' acceptable salts thereof with pharmaceutical!}-' acceptable excipients., and the second immediate release layer is prepared by mixing a therapeutically effective amount of cephalosporin preferably Cefixime or pharmaceutical!)' acceptable salts thereof and a probioties preferably Lactobacillus sporogenes spores with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
The present invention also relates to the use of this formulation for the treatment of bacterial infections such as respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, urinary tract infections, otitis media, pneumonia and cystitis.<br>
Background and prior art<br>
Cefixime is a third generation orally active, broad spectrum cephalosporin active against a wide range of gram positive and gram negative bacteria. Cefixime is a bactericidal antibiotic and is stable to hydrolysis by many beta-lactamases. Cefixime exhibits good in vitro activity against most of the Enterobacteriaceae. Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoea (including bela-lactamase producing strains), beta-haemolytic streptococci of groups A and B and Streptococcus pneumoniae. .<br>
Against H.  influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae Cefixime has been shown to be highly<br>
inhibitory to all strengths tested.    For H. influenzae, this included strains resistant to<br>
i<br>
ampicillin, cefaclor, cephalexin, chloramphenicol and colrimoxazole.<br>
Cefixime is widely used in the treatment of respiratory tract infections. The drug has shown excellent safety and efficacy in the treatment of these infections. It is even widely prescribed to children. Cefixime despite its potent activity against other gram positive cocci like streptococcus is inactive against staphylococci except Staphylococcus aureus<br>
2<br><br>
which is considerably less susceptible. Faecal streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, most anaerobes and Chlamydia trachomatis are insusceptible This makes the drug less effective in common day-to-day infections like respiratory tract infections or skin &amp; soft tissue infections. This is a limitation to the use of a safe cephalosporin like Cefixime.<br>
Although Cefixime has been considered as a highly safe and effective drug for the treatment of many bacterial infections, because of its instability in presence of staphylococci hinders not only its therapeutic activity but also clinical outcome.<br>
Although Cefixime has been considered as a highly safe and effective drug for the treatment of many bacterial infections, because of its instability in presence of staphylococci hinders not only its therapeutic activity but also clinical outcome.<br>
Isoxazolyl penicillins such as Cloxacillin. Dicloxacillin and Oxacillin are penicillinase-resistant.. Based on its spectrum of activity Cloxacillin is classified as second generation penicillin.<br>
Cloxacillin is active against gram positive organisms like staphylococci, streptococci, etc. In addition. Cloxacillin is stable to beta lactamases produced by gram positive organisms. Addition of Cloxacillin to Cefixime would provide:<br>
a.	Effective coverage of all gram positive organisms like staphylococci, streptococci,<br>
thereby making the combination effective in a wide range of infections, common day-<br>
to-day infections like respiratory tract infections, skin &amp; soft tissue infections etc.<br>
b.	the combination stable to beta lactamases produced by staphylococci thereby making<br>
the combination "tough".<br>
Combination of Cefixime and Cloxacillin will meet the challenges of day-to-day infections like respiratory tract infections and skin &amp; soft tissue infections.<br>
Cloxacillin is widely accepted and is used in combination with Ampicillin and Amoxyciliin mainly to increase the efficacy of these safe antibiotics in the treatment of<br>
3<br><br>
staphylococcal infections. In addition, studies have shown synergism between Cloxacillin and Gentamicin.<br>
Lactic acid bacilli, the so-called 'friendly bacteria' are a member of natural gastro¬intestinal flora. They are also known as probiotics.<br>
Probiotics are the living microbial food ingredients that colonize the intestinal tract and have a beneficial effect on the human health.<br>
Lactic acid bacilli are found to be useful in conditions like traveler's diarrhoea, antibiotic induced diarrhoea, infantile diarrhoea, infectious diarrrhoea caused by viruses and bacteria (like diarrhoea due to rotavirus, salmonella, shigella etc.).<br>
Lactic acid bacilli when given simultaneously with an antibiotic are capable of colonizing the intestinal tract despite the antibiotic treatment, re-establishing the intestinal microflora. This would reduce the incidence of diarrhoea and Gl disturbance following antibiotic therapy.<br>
Diarrhoea and stool changes like soft stools, and loose stools have been the most frequently reported adverse effects with use of Cefixime and Cloxacillin, in adults as well as children. These side effects can interfere with the patient compliance and can result in premature stopping of treatment, which can result in treatment failure. Antibiotic therapy often disrupts the balance of the intestinal microorganisms resulting in abnormal intestinal and bowel function. Lactic acid bacilli are believed to be effective in suppressing the growth of pathogenic microorganisms and re-establishing the normal intestinal flora. This would reduce the incidence of adverse effects like diarrhoea, improve the patient compliance and would result in better cure rates.<br>
US 6306391 disclosed a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one anti infective ingredient as a first active ingredient and at least one microorganism as a second active ingredient. Patent discloses protection of susceplible organisms from the effect of anti infective agent by creating barrier around the microorganism or an anti infective acenl.<br>
4<br><br>
Japanese Patent No. 1083025 discloses blended preparation of drug resistant live bacterial agent for controlling intestinal function. The said preparation includes anti microbial agent that is blended with anti bacterial agent. However patent does not discloses preparation of the formulation comprising two antibacterial agents.<br>
EP1566116 discloses two types of release matrices, a controlled release matrix containing Cloxacillin sodium and an immediate release matrix containing Cefixime Trihydrate, Cloxacillin sodium and Lactobacillus sporogenes. These ingredients of the formulation are processed so as to form a homogenous intimate mixture along with conventional excipients. The mixture is compressed into cores and further coated.     '<br>
However none of the above prior arts discloses the bilaver tablet formulation, wherein the sustained release and immediate release layers are separated by two layers. Hence, the present invention is directed to preparation of formulation which contains combination of Cefixime, Cloxacillin or Dicloxacillin and lactic acid bacilli in bilaver tablet form to meet the challenges of day-to-day infections like respiratory tract infections, skin &amp; soft tissue infections, urinary tract infections, otitis media, pneumonia and cystitis<br>
Object of the invention<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition in the form of a bilaver tablet comprising of antibiotic preferably Cloxacillin or Dicloxacillin or its pharmaceutical!}' acceptable salts thereof, cephalosporin preferably Cefixime or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and a probiotics preferably Lactobacillus sporogenes spores.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition in the form of a tablet comprising two discrete layers wherein the first sustained release layer is prepared containing an antibiotic preferably Cloxacillin or Dicloxacillin or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and the second immediate release layer is prepared by mixing a therapeutically effective amount<br>
3<br><br>
of cephalosporin preferably Cefixime or pharmaceuticaily acceptable salt and a probiotics preferably Lactobacillus sporogenes spores.<br>
