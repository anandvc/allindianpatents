This invention relates to certain ortho-heterocyclic substituted aryl amides, their<br>
N-oxides, salts and compositions suitable for agronomic and nonagronomic uses, including<br>
those uses listed below, and a method of their use for controlling invertebrate pests in both<br>
agronomic and nonagronomic environents<br>
10	The control of invertebrate pests is extremely important in achieving high crop<br>
efficiency. Damage by invertebrate pests to growing and stored agronomic crops can cause<br>
significant reduction in productivity and thereby result in increased costs to the consumer.<br>

DETAILS OF THE INVENTION In the above recitations, "alkyl", used either alone or in compound words such as "alkylthio" or "haloalkyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl,<br>
30     ;?-propyl, z'-propyl, or the different butyl, pentyl or hexyl isomers. "Alkenyl" includes<br>
straight-chain or branched alkenes such as 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, and the different butenyl, pentenyl and hexenyl isomers. "Alkenyl" also includes polyenes such as 1,2-propadienyl and 2,4-hexadienyl. "Alkynyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkynes such as 1 -propynyl, 2-propynyl and the different butynyl, pentynyl and hexynyl isomers. "Alkynyl"<br>
35      can also include moieties comprised of multiple triple bonds such as 2,5-hexadiynyl. "Alkoxy" includes, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propyloxy, isopropyloxy and the different butoxy, pentoxy and hexyloxy isomers. "Alkylthio" includes branched or straight-chain alkylthio moieties such as methylthio, ethylthio, and the different propylthio<br><br>
/	/<br>
and butylthio isomers. "Cycloalkyl" includes, for example, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl. cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. "Trialkylsilyl" includes (CH3)3Si, (CH3CH2)3Si and [(CH3)3C](CH3)2Si.<br>
The term "aromatic" indicates that each of the ring atoms is essentially in the same 5     plane and has ap-ovbital perpendicular to the ring plane, and in which (4n + 2) % electi-ons, when n is 0 or a positive integer, are associated with the ring to comply with Huckel's rule. The term "aromatic ring system" denotes fully unsaturated carbocycles and heterocycles in which at least one ring of a polycyclic ring system is aromatic. Aromatic carbocyclic ring or fused carbobicyclic ring systems includes fully aromatic carbocycles and carbocycles in 10     which at least one ring of a polycyclic ring system is aromatic (e.g. phenyl, naphthyl and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl). The term "nonaromatic carbocyclic ring" denotes fully saturated carbocycles as well as partially or fully unsaturated carbocycles where the Hiickel rule is not satisfied by the ring. The term "hetero" in connection with rings or ring systems refers to a ring or ring system in which at least one ring atom is not carbon and which can 15     contain 1 to 4 heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, provided that each ring contains no more than 4 nitrogens, no more than 2 oxygens and no more than 2 sulfurs. The terms "heteroaromatic ring or ring system" and "aromatic fused heterobicyclic ring system" includes fully aromatic heterocycles and heterocycles in which at least one ring of a polycyclic ring system is aromatic (where<br>
20     aromatic indicates that the Hiickel rule is satisfied). The term "nonaromatic heterocyclic ring or ring system" denotes fully saturated heterocycles as well as partially or fully unsaturated heterocycles where the Hiickel rule is not satisfied by any of the rings in the ring system. The heterocyclic ring or ring system can be attached through any available carbon or nitrogen by replacement of a hydrogen on said carbon or nitrogen.<br>
25	The term "halogen", either alone or in compound words such as "haloalkyl", includes<br>
fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. Further, when used in compound words such as "haloalkyl", said alkyl may be partially or fully substituted with halogen atoms which may be the same or different. Examples of "haloalkyl" include F3C, C1CH2, CF3CH2 and CF3CC12. The terms "haloalkenyl", "haloalkynyl", "haloalkoxy", and the like, are defined<br>
30     analogously to the term "haloalkyl". Examples of "haloalkenyl" include (Cl)2OCHCH2 and CF3CH2CH=CHCH2. Examples of "haloalkynyl" include HOCCHC1, CF3C=C, CC13C=C and FCH2C=CCH2. Examples of "haloalkoxy" include CF305 CC13CH20, HCF2CH2CH20 and CF3CH20.<br>
Examples of "alkylcarbonyl" include C(0)CH3, C(0)CH2CH2CH3 and<br>
35     C(0)CH(CH3)2. Examples of "alkoxycarbonyl" include CH3OC(=0), CH3CH2OC(-0), CH3CH2CH2OC(=0), (CH3)2CHOC(=0) and the different butoxy- or pentoxycarbonyl isomers. Examples of "alkylaminocarbonyl" include CH3NHC(-0), CH3CH2NHC(=0), CH3CH2CH2NHC(=0), (CH3)2CHNHC(=0) and the different butylamino- or<br><br>
pentylaminocarbonyl isomers. Examples of "dialkylaminocarbonyF' include (CH3)2NC(=0), (CH3CH2)2NC(=0), CH3CH2(CH3)NC(=0), CH3CH2CH2(CH3)NC(=0) and (CH3)2CHN(CH3)C(=0).<br>
The total number of carbon atoms in a substituent group is indicated by the "C1-Cj" 5     prefix where i and j are integers from 1 to 8. For example, C1-C3 alkylsulfonyl designates methylsulfonyl through propylsulfonyl.<br>
In the above recitations, when a compound of Formula I contains a heterocyclic ring,<br>
all substituents are attached to this ring through any available carbon or nitrogen by<br>
replacement of a hj'drogen on said carbon or nitrogen.<br>
10	When a compound is substituted with a substituent bearing a subscript that indicates<br>
the number of said substituents can exceed 1, said substituents (when they exceed 1) are independently selected from the group of defined substituents. Further, when the subscript indicates a range, e.g. (R)i_j, then the number of substituents may be selected from the integers between i and j inclusive.<br>
15	The term "optionally substituted" indicates that a group may be substituted or<br>
unsubstituted. The term "optionally substituted with from one to three substituents" and the like indicates that the group may be unsubstituted or from one to three of the available positions on the group may be substituted. When a group contains a substituent which can be hydrogen, for example R1 or R5, then, when this substituent is taken as hydrogen, it is<br>
20     recognized that this is equivalent to said group being unsubstituted.<br>
Compounds of this invention can exist as one or more stereoisomers. The various stereoisomers include enantiomers, diastereomers, atropisomers and geometric isomers. One skilled in the art will appreciate that one stereoisomer may be more active and/or may exhibit beneficial effects when enriched relative to the other stereoisomer(s) or when<br>
25      separated from the other stereoisomer(s). Additionally, the skilled artisan Icnows how to separate, enrich, and/or to selectively prepare said stereoisomers. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention may be present as a mixture of stereoisomers, individual stereoisomers, or as an optically active form. Some compounds of this invention can exist as one or more tautomers, and all tautomeric forms of such compounds are part of the present<br>
30     invention. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention may be present as a mixture of tautomers or the individual tautomers.<br>
The present invention comprises compounds selected from Formula I, iV-oxides and agriculturally suitable salts thereof. One skilled in the art will appreciate that not all nitrogen containing heterocycles can form Nj-oxides since the nitrogen requires an available lone pair<br>
35      of electrons for oxidation to the oxide; one skilled in the art will recognize those nitrogen containing heterocycles which can form N-oxides. One skilled in the art will also recognize that tertiary amines can form N-oxides. Synthetic methods for the preparation of N-oxides of heterocycles and tertiary amines are very well known by one skilled in the art including the<br><br><br>
oxidation of heterocycles and tertiary amines with peroxy acids such as peracetic and 77z-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA), hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides such as f-butyl hydroperoxide, sodium perborate, and dioxiranes such as dimethydioxirane. These methods for the preparation of N-oxides have been extensively described and reviewed in the 5     literature, see for example: T. L. Gilchrist in Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, vol. 7,<br>
pp 748-750, S. V. Ley, Ed., Pergamon Press; M. Tisler and B. Stanovrhk in Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistiy, Vol. 3, pp 18-19, A. J. Boulton and A. McKillop, Eds., Pergamon Press; M. R. Grimmett and B. R. T. Keene in Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistiy, Vol. 43, pp 139-151, A. R. Katritzky, Ed., Academic Press; M. Tisler and B. Stanovnik in. Advances<br>
10     in Heterocyclic Chemistiy, Vol. 9, pp 285-291, A. R. Katritzky and A. J. Boulton, Eds., Academic Press; and G. W. H. Cheeseman and E. S. G. Werstiuk in Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistiy, Vol. 22, pp 390-392, A. R. Katritzky and A. J. Boulton, Eds., Academic Press.<br>
The salts of the compounds of the invention include acid-addition salts with inorganic<br>
15      or organic acids such as hydrobromic, hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, acetic, butyric, fumaric, lactic, maleic, malonic, oxalic, propionic, salicylic, tartaric, 4-toluenesulfonic or valeric acids. The salts of the compounds of the invention also include those formed with organic bases (e.g., pyridine, ammonia, or triethylamine) or inorganic bases (e.g., hydrides, hydroxides, or carbonates of sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium,<br>
20     magnesium or barium) when the compound contains an acidic group such as a carboxylic acid or phenol.<br>
As noted above, R1 can be (among others) C1-C6 alkyl, C2-C6 alkenyl, C2-C6 alkynyl or C3-C6 cycloalkyl each optionally substituted with one: or more substituents independently selected from the group consisting of halogen, CN, NO2,' hydroxy, C1-C4 alkoxy, C1-C4<br>
25      alkylthio, CrC4 alkylsulfinyl, CrC4 alkylsulfonyl, C2-C4 alkoxycarbonyl, CrC4 alkylamino, C2-Cs dialkylamino and C3-C6 cycloalkylamino. The term "optionally substituted" in connection with these R1 groups refers to R1 groups that are unsubstituted or have at least one non-hydrogen substituent Examples of optionally substituted R1 groups are those that are optionally substituted by replacement of a hydrogen on a carbon atom of<br>
30      the R1 group with one or more (up to the total number of hydrogens available for replacement in any specific R1 group) substituents independently selected from the substituents listed above. Although these substituents are listed in the examples above, it is noted that they do not need to be present since they are optional substituents. Of note are R1 groups that are unsubstituted. Of note are R1 groups substituted with from one to five<br>
35      substituents. Also of note are R1 groups substituted with one substituent.<br>
As noted above, each J is independently a phenyl ring, a 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic ring or an aromatic 8-, 9- or 10-membered fused carbobicyclic or heterobicyclic ring system, wherein each ring or ring system is optionally substituted with<br><br><br>
from one to four R3. The term "optionally substituted" in connection with these J groups refers to groups that are unsubstituted or have at least one non-hydrogen substituent. An example of phenyl optionally substituted with one to four R3 is the ring illustrated as U-l in Exhibit 1, wherein Rv is R3 and r is an integer from 1 to 4. Examples of aromatic 8-. 9- or 5     10-membered fused carbobicyclic ring system include a naphthyl group optionally<br>
substituted with 1 to 3 R3 illustrated as U-85 in Exhibit 1 and a 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl group illustrated as U-89 in Exhibit 1, wherein Rv is R3 and r is an integer from 1 to 4 . Examples of 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic rings optionally substituted with one to four R3 include the rings U-2 through U-53 illustrated in Exhibit 1 wherein Rv is R3 and r is<br>
10     an integer from 1 to 4. Note that J-l through J-4 below also denote 5- or 6-membered<br>
heteroaromatic rings. Note that U-2 through U-20 are examples of J-l, U-21 through U-35 and U-40 are examples of J-2, U-41 through U-48 are examples of J-3 and U-49 through U-53 are examples of J-4. Examples of aromatic 8-, 9- or 10-membered fused heterobicyclic ring systems optionally substituted with one to four R3 include U-54 through U-84<br>
15     illustrated in Exhibit 1 wherein Rv is R3 and r is an integer from 1 to 4.<br>
Although Rv groups are shown in the structures U-l through U-89, it is noted that they do not need to be present since they are optional substituents. Note that when Rv is H when attached to an atom, this is the same as if said atom is unsubstituted. The nitrogen atoms that require substitution to fill their valence are substituted with H or Rv. Note that some U<br>
20     groups can only be substituted with less than 4 Rv groups (e.g. U-l 4, U-l 5, U-l 8 through U-21 and U-32 through U-34 can only be substituted with one Rv). Note that when the attachment point between (Rv)r and the U group is illustrated as floating, (Rv)r can be attached to any available carbon atom of the U group. Note that when the attachment point on the U group is illustrated as floating, the U group can be attached to the remainder of<br>
25     Formula I through any available carbon of the U group by replacement of a hydrogen atom.<br>

A typical procedure is described in Scheme 1 and involves coupling of an amine of Formula 2 with an acid chloride of Formula 3 in the presence of an acid scavenger or base to 30     provide the compound of Formula la. Typical acid scavengers include amme bases such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine and pyridine; other scavengers include hydroxides such as sodium and potassium hydroxide and carbonates such as sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. In certain instances it is useful to use polymer-supported acid scavengers such as polymer-bound diisopropylethylamine and polymer-bound dimethylaminopyridine. The 35     coupling can be run in a suitable inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diethyl ether or dichloromethane to afford the anilide of Formula la.<br><br>
Scheme 1<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

An alternate procedure for the preparation of compounds of Formula la involves coupling of an amine of Formula 2 with an acid of Formula 4 in the presence of a dehydrating agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC),1,1-carbonyldiimidazole, bis(2-oxo-3-oxazolidinyl)-phosphinic chloride or benzotriazol-l-yloxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate. The coupling can be run in a suitable inert solvent such as dichloromethane or N,N-dimethylformamide. Polymer supported reagents are again useful here, such as polymer-bound cyclohexylcarbodiimide. Synthetic procedures of Schemes 1 and 2 are only representative examples of useful methods for the preparation of Formula I compounds as the synthetic literature is extensive for this type of reaction.<br><br>

One skilled in the art will also realize that acid chlorides of Formula 3 may be prepared from acids of Formula 4 by numerous well-known methods. For example, acid chlorides of Formula 3 are readily made from carboxylic acids of Formula 4 by reacting the carboxylic acid 4 with thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride in an inert solvent such as toluene or dichloromethane in the presence of a catalytic amount of N,N-dimethylformamide.<br>
Heterocyclic substituted anilines of Formula 2a are typically available from the corresponding 2-nitrobenzenes of Formula 5 via catalytic hydrogenation of the nitro group (Scheme 3). Typical procedures involve reduction with hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst such as palladium on carbon or platinum oxide and in hydroxylic solvents such as ethanol and isopropanol. They can also be prepared by reduction with zinc in acetic acid. These procedures are well documented in the chemical literature. Substituted phenylheterocycles of Formula 5 can be made according to general methods such as those described in Rodd 's Chemistry of Organic Compounds: Heterocyclic Compounds, Volume<br><br>

IV. parts C, F and IJ 1989, Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistiy, Volumes 2, 3,4,5 and 6 (1984) and Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistiy II. Volumes 3,4,5 and 6 1996, World Patent (PCT Int. Appl) WO 98/56,789 (1998) and World Patent (PCT Int. Appl.) WO 96/06,096 (1996). R1 substituents such as alkyl, substituted alkyl and the like can generally be introduced at this stage through known procedures including either direct alkylation or through the generally preferred method of reductive alkylation of the aniline. A commonly employed procedure is to combine the aniline 2a with an aldehyde in the presence of a reducing agent such as sodium cyanoborohydride to produce the Formula 2b compounds where R1 is alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or substituted derivatives thereof.<br>

W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, 1991, pp. 224-269 for a review of methods). For the method of Scheme 40, base-catalyzed hydrolytic methods are preferred. Suitable bases include alkali metal (such as lithium, sodium or potassium) hydroxides. For example, the<br><br>
ester can be dissolved in a mixture of water and an alcohol such as efhanol. Upon treatment with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, the ester is saponified to provide the sodium or potassium salt of the carboxylic acid. Acidification with a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, yields the carboxylic acid of Formula At The carboxylic acid can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, including crystallization, extraction and distillation.<br>

wherein R8 is C1-C4 alkyl-<br>
Oxidization of the compound of Formula 102 optionally in the presence of acid to give the compound of Formula 103 followed by conversion of the carboxylic ester function to the carboxylic acid provides the compound of Formula 4u. The oxidizing agent can be hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides, potassium persulfate, sodium persulfate, ammonium persulfate, potassium monopersulfate (e.g., Oxone®) or potassium permanganate. To obtain complete conversion, at least one equivalent of oxidizing agent versus the compound of Formula 102 should be used, preferably between about one to two equivalents. This oxidation is typically carried out in the presence of a solvent. The solvent can be an ether, such as tetrahydrofuran, p-dioxane and the like, an organic ester, such as ethyl acetate, dimethyl carbonate and the like, or a polar aprotic organic such as N,N-dimethylforrnarnide, acetonitrile and the like. Acids suitable for use in the oxidation step include inorganic acids, such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic acids, such as acetic acid, benzoic acid and the like. The acid, when used, should be used in greater than 0.1 equivalents versus the compound of Formula 102.   To obtain complete conversion, one to five equivalents of acid can be used. The preferred oxidant is potassium persulfate and the oxidation is preferably carried out in the presence of sulfuric acid. The reaction can be carried out by mixing the compound of Formula 102 in the desired solvent and, if used, the acid. The oxidant can then be added at a convenient rate. The reaction temperature is typically varied from as low as about 0 °C up to the boiling point of the solvent in order to obtain a reasonable reaction time to complete the reaction, preferably less than 8 hours. The desired product, a compound of Formula 103 can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, including crystallization, extraction and distillation. Methods suitable for converting the ester of Formula 103 to the carboxylic acid of Formula 4u are already described for Scheme 40. ,<br>
Compounds of Formula 102 can be prepared from corresponding compounds of Formula 104 as shown in Scheme 43.<br><br>

104<br><br>
102<br><br>
wherein R% is C1-C4 alkyl.<br>
Treatment of a compound of Formula 104 with a halogenating reagent, usually in the presence of a solvent, affords the corresponding halo compound of Formula 102. Halogenating reagents that can be used include phosphorus oxyhalides, phosphorus trihalides, phosphorus pentahalides, thionyl chloride, dihalotrialkylphophoranes, dihalodiphenylphosphoranes, oxalyl chloride and phosgene. Preferred are.phosphorus oxyhalides and phosphorus pentahalides. To obtain complete conversion, at least 0.33 equivalents of phosphorus oxyhaiide versus the compound of Formula 104 should be used, preferably between about 0.33 and 1.2 equivalents. To obtain complete conversion, at least 0.20 equivalents of phosphorus pentahalide versus the compound of Formula 104 should be used, preferably between about 0.20 and 1.0 equivalents. Compounds of Formula 104 wherein R6 is C1-C4 alkyl are preferred for this reaction. Typical solvents for this halogenation include halogenated alkanes, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, chlorobutane and the like, aromatic solvents, such as benzene, xylene, chlorobenzene and the like, ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran, p-dioxane, diethyl ether, and the like, and polar aprotic solvents such as acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, and the like. Optionally, an organic base, such as triethylamine, pyridine, N,N-dimethylaniline or the like, can be added. Addition of a catalyst, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, is also an option. Preferred is the process in which the solvent is acetonitrile and a base is absent. Typically, neither a base nor a catalyst is required when acetonitrile solvent is used. The preferred process is conducted by mixing the compound of Formula 104 in acetonitrile. The halogenating reagent is then added over a convenient time, and the mixture is then held at the desired temperature until the reaction is complete. The reaction temperature is typically between 20 °C and the boiling point of acetonitrile, and the reaction time is typically less than 2 hours. The reaction mass is then neutralized with an inorganic base, such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydroxide and the like, or an organic base, such as sodium acetate. The desired product, a compound of Formula 102, can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, including crystallization, extraction and distillation.<br><br>
Alternatively, compounds of Formula 102 wherein R3 is Br or CIcan be prepared by treating the corresponding compounds of Formula 102 wherein R3 is a different halogen (e.g., CI for making Formula 102 wherein R3 is Br) or a sulfonate group such as p-toluenesulfonate with hydrogen bromide or hydrogen chloride, respectively. By this method the R3 halogen or sulfonate substituent on the Formula 102 starting compound is replaced with Br or CI from hydrogen bromide or hydrogen chloride, respectively. The reaction is conducted in a suitable solvent such as dibromometihane, dichloromethane or acetonitrile. The reaction can be conducted at or near atmospheric pressure or above atmospheric pressure in a pressure vessel. When R3 in the starting compound of Formula 102 is a halogen such as CI, the reaction is preferably conducted in such a way that the hydrogen halide generated from the reaction is removed by sparging or other suitable means. The reaction can be conducted between about 0 and 100 °C, most conveniently near ambient temperature (e.g., about 10 to 40 °C), and more preferably between about 20 and 30 °C. Addition of a Lewis acid catalyst (such as aluminum tribromide for preparing Formula 102 wherein R3 is Br) can facilitate the reaction. The product of Formula 102 is isolated by the usual methods known to those skilled in the art, including extraction, distillation and crystallization.<br>
Starting compounds of Formula 102 wherein R3 is CI or Br can be prepared from corresponding compounds of Formula 104 as already described. Starting compounds of Formula 102 wherein R3 is a sulfonate group can likewise be prepared from corresponding compounds of Formula 104 by standard methods such as treatment with a sulfonyl chloride (e.g.,/?-toluenesulfonyl chloride) and base such as a tertiary amine (e.g., triethylamine) in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane.<br>

wherein R.8 is C1-C4 alkyl, and Lg is a leaving group.<br><br>
In this method, instead of being halogenated as shown in. Scheme 43, the compound of Formula 104 is oxidized to the compound of Formula 105. The reaction conditions for this oxidation are as already described for the conversion of the compound of Formula 102 to the compound of Formula 103 in Scheme 42.<br>
The compound of Formula 105 is then alkylated to form the compound of Formula 107 by contact with an alkylating agent CF3CH2Lg (106) in the presence of a base. In the alkylating agent 106, Lg is a nucleophilic reaction leaving group such as halogen (e.g., Br, I), OS(0)2CH3 (methanesulfonate), OS(0)2CF3, OS(0)2Ph-p-CH3 (p-toluenesulfonate), and the like; methanesulfonate works well. The reaction is conducted in the presence of at least one equivalent of a base. Suitable bases include inorganic bases, such as alkali metal (such as lithium, sodium or potassium) carbonates and hydroxides, and organic bases, such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine and l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene. The reaction is generally conducted in a solvent, which can comprise alcohols, such as methanol and ethanol, halogenated alkanes, such as dichloromethane. aromatic solvents, such as benzene, toluene and chlorobenzene, ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran, and polar aprotic solvents, such as such as acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, and the like. Alcohols and polar aprotic solvents are preferred for use with inorganic bases. Potassium carbonate as base and acetonitrile as solvent are preferred. The reaction is generally conducted between about 0 and 150 °C, with most typically between ambient temperature and 100 °C. The product of Formula 107 can be isolated by conventional techniques such as extraction. The ester of Formula 107 can then be converted to the carboxylic acid of Formula 4v by the methods already described for the conversion of Formula 97 to Formula 4t in Scheme 40.<br>
Compounds of Formula 104 can be prepared from compounds of Formula 98 as outlined in Scheme 45.<br>

In this method, a hydrazine compound of Formula 98 is contacted with a compound of Formula 108 (a fumarate ester or maleate ester or a mixture thereof may be used) in the presence of a base and a solvent. The base is typically a metal alkoxide salt, such as sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide, potassium ter t-butoxide, lithium tert-butoxide, and the like. Greater than 0.5 equivalents of base versus<br><br><br>
the compound of Formula 108 should be used, preferably between 0.9 and 1.3 equivalents. Greater than 1.0 equivalents of the compound of Formula 108 should be used, preferably between 1.0 to 1.3 equivalents. Polar protic and polar aprotic organic solvents can be used, such as alcohols, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and the like. Preferred solvents are alcohols such as methanol and ethanol. It is especially preferred that the alcohol be the same as that making up the fumarate or maleate ester and the alkoxide base. The reaction is typically conducted by mixing the compound of Formula 108 and the base in the solvent. The mixture can be heated or cooled to a desired temperature and the compound of Formula 108 added over a period of time. Typically reaction temperatures are between 0 °C and the boiling point of the solvent used. The reaction may be conducted under greater than atmospheric pressure in order to increase the boiling point of the solvent. Temperatures between about 30 and 90 °C are generally preferred. The addition time can be as quick as heat transfer allows. Typical addition times are between 1 minute and 2 hours. Optimum reaction temperature and addition time vary depending upon the identities of the compounds of Formula 98 and Formula 108. After addition, the reaction mixture can be held for a time at the reaction temperature. Depending upon the reaction temperature, the required hold time may be from 0 to 2 hours. Typical hold times are 10 to 60 minutes. The reaction mass then can be acidified by adding an organic acid, such as acetic acid and the like, or an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and the like. Depending on the reaction conditions and the means of isolation, the -C02R8 function on the compound of Formula 104 may be hydrolyzed to -C02H; for example, the presence of water in the reaction mixture can promote such hydrolysis. If the carboxylic acid (-C02H) is formed, it can be converted back to -C02R8 wherein R8 is C1-C4 alkyl using esterification methods well-known in the art. The desired product, a compound of Formula 104, can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, such as crystallization, extraction or distillation.<br>

Formulation/Utilitv<br>
Compounds of this invention will generally be used as a fonnulation or composition with an agriculturally suitable canier comprising at least one of a liquid diluent, a solid<br><br>
diluent or a surfactant. The formulation or composition ingredients are selected to be consistent with the physical properties of the active ingredient, mode of application and environmental factors such as soil type, moisture and temperature. Useful formulations include liquids such as solutions (including emulsifiable concentrates), suspensions, emulsions (including microemulsions and/or suspoemulsions) and the like which optionally can be thickened into gels. Useful formulations further include solids such as dusts, powders, granules, pellets, tablets, films, and the like which can be water-dispersible ("wettable") or water-soluble. Active ingredient can be (micro)encapsulated and further formed into a suspension or solid formulation; alternatively the entire formulation of active ingi'edient can be encapsulated (or "overcoated"). Encapsulation can control or delay release of the active ingredient. Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes from about one to several hundred liters per hectare. High-strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation.<br>
The formulations will typically contain effective amounts of active ingredient, diluent and surfactant within the following approximate ranges that add up to 100 percent by weight.<br>

Typical solid diluents are described in Watkiris, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers, 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, New Jersey. Typical liquid diluents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide, 2ndEd., Interscience, New York, 1950. McCutcheon 's Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual, Allured Publ. Corp., Ridgewood, New Jersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents, Chemical Publ. Co., Inc., New York, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foam, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth and the like, or thickeners to increase viscosity.<br>
Surfactants include, for example, polyethoxylated alcohols, polyethoxylated alkylphenols, polyethoxylated sorbitan fatty acid esters, dialkyl sulfosuccinates, alkyl sulfates, alkylbenzene sulfonates, organosilicones, N,N-dialkyltaurates, lignin sulfonates, naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensates, polycarboxylates, and<br><br>
polyoxyethylene/polyoxypropylene block copolymers. Solid diluents include, for example, clays such as bentonite, montmorillonite, attapulgite and kaolin, starch, sugar, silica, talc, diatomaceous earth, urea, calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate and bicarbonate, and sodium sulfate. Liquid diluents include, for example, water, N,N-dimethidformamide, dimethyl 5     sulfoxide, JV-alkylpyrrolidone, ethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, paraffins,<br>
alkylbenzenes, alkylnaphthalenes, oils of olive, castor, linseed, rung, sesame, com, peanut, cotton-seed, soybean, rape-seed and coconut, fatty acid esters, ketones such as cyclohexanone, 2-heptanone, isophorone and 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone, and alcohols such as methanol, cyclohexanol, decanol and tetrahydro furfur yl alcohol.<br>
10	Solutions, including emulsifiable concentrates, can be prepared by simply mixing the<br>
ingredients. Dusts and powders.can be prepared by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer mill or fluid-energy mill. Suspensions are usually prepared by wet-milling; see, for example, U.S. 3,060,084. Granules and pellets can be prepared by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See Browning,<br>

Compounds of this invention are characterized by favorable metabolic and/or soil residual patterns and exhibit activity controlling a spectrum of agronomic and non-agronomic invertebrate pests.   (In the context of this disclosure "invertebrate pest control" 35     means inhibition of invertebrate pest development (including mortality) that causes significant reduction in feeding or other injury or damage caused by the pest; related<br><br>
I<br>
expressions are defined analogously.) As referred to in this disclosure, the term "invertebrate pest" includes arthropods, gastropods and nematodes of economic impozfance as pests. The term "arthropod" includes insects, mites, spiders, scorpions, centipedes, millipedes, pill bugs and symphylans. The term "gastropod" includes snails, slugs and other 5      Stylommatophora. The term "nematode" includes all of the helminths, such as:<br>
roundworms, heartworms, and phytophagous nematodes (Nematoda), flukes (Tematoda), Acanthocephala, and tapeworms (Cestoda). Those skilled in the art will recognize that not all compounds are equally effective against all pests. Compounds of this invention display activity against economically important agronomic and nonagronomic pests. The term<br>
10      "agronomic" refers to the production of field crops such as for food and fiber and includes the growth of cereal crops (e.g., wheat, oats, barley, rye, rice, maize), soybeans, vegetable crops (e.g., lettuce, cabbage, tomatoes, beans), potatoes, sweet potatoes, grapes, cotton, and tree fruits (e.g., pome fruits, stone fruits and citrus fruits). The term "nonagronomic" refers to other horticultural (e.g., forest, greenhouse, nursery or ornamental plants not grown in a<br>
15      field), public (human) and animal health, domestic and commercial structure, household, and stored product applications or pests. For reason of invertebrate pest control spectrum and economic importance, protection (from damage or injury caused by invertebrate pests) of agronomic crops of cotton, maize, soybeans, rice, vegetable crops, potato, sweet potato, grapes and tree fruit by controlling invertebrate pests are preferred embodiments of the<br>
20      invention.

In certain instances, combinations with other invertebrate pest control compounds or agents having a similar spectrum of control but a different mode of action will be particularly advantageous for resistance management. Thus, compositions of the present invention can further comprise a biologically effective amount of at least one additional invertebrate pest control compound or agent having a similar spectrum of control but a<br><br>
different mode of action. Contacting a plant genetically modified to express a plant<br>
protection compound (e.g., protein) or the locus of the plant with a biologically effective<br>
amount of a compound of invention can also provide a broader spectrum of plant protection<br>
and be advantageous for resistance management.<br>
5	Invertebrate pests are controlled in agronomic and nonagronomic applications by<br>
applying one or more of the compounds of this invention, in an effective amount, to the environment of the pests including the agronomic and/or nonagronomic locus of infestation, to the area to be protected, or directly on the pests to be controlled. Thus, the present invention further comprises a method for the control of an invertebrate pest in agronomic<br>
10     and/or nonagronoznic applications, comprising contacting the invertebrate pest or its<br>
environment with a biologically effective amount of one or more of the compounds of the invention, or with a composition comprising at least one such compound or a composition comprising at least one such compound and an effective amount of at least one additional biologically active compound or agent. Examples of suitable compositions comprising a<br>
15      compound of the invention and an effective amount of at least one additional biologically active compound or agent include granular compositions wherein the additional biologically active compound or agent is present on the same granule as the compound of the invention or on granules separate from those of the compound of this invention.<br>
A preferred method of contact is by spraying. Alternative^, a granular composition<br>
20     comprising a compound of the invention can be applied to the plant foliage or the soil. Compounds of this invention are also effectively delivered through plant uptake by contacting the plant with a composition comprising a compound of this invention applied as a soil drench of a liquid formulation, a granular formulation to the soil, a nursery box treatment or a dip of transplants. Compounds are also effective by topical application of a<br>
25     composition comprising a compound of this invention to the locus of infestation. Other methods of contact include application of a compound or a composition of the invention by direct and residual sprays, aerial sprays, gels, seed coatings, microencapsulations, systemic uptake, baits, eartags, boluses, foggers, fumigants, aerosols, dusts and many others. The compounds of this invention may also be impregnated into materials for fabricating<br>
30      invertebrate control devices (e.g. insect netting).<br>
The compounds of this invention can be incorporated into baits that are consumed by the invertebrates or within devices such as traps and the like. Granules or baits comprising between 0.01-5% active ingredient, 0.05-10% moisture retaining agent(s) and 40-99% vegetable flour are effective in controlling soil insects at very low application rates,<br>
35     particularly at doses of active ingredient that are lethal by ingestion rather than by direct contact.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be applied in their pure state, but most often application will be of a formulation comprising one or more compounds with suitable<br><br>
earners, diluents, and surfactants and possibly in combination with a food depending on the contemplated end use. A preferred method of application involves spraying a water dispersion or refined oil solution of the compounds. Combinations with spray oils, spray oil concentrations, spreader stickers, adjuvants, other solvents, and synergists such as piperonyl 5     butoxide often enhance compound efficacy.<br>
The rate of application required for effective control (i.e. "biologically effective amount") will depend on such factors as the species of invertebrate to be controlled, the pest's life cycle, life stage, its size, location, time of year, host crop or animal, feeding behavior, mating behavior, ambient moisture, temperature, and the like. Under normal<br>
10      circumstances, application rates of about 0.01 to 2 kg of active ingredient per hectare are<br>
sufficient to control pests in agronomic ecosystems, but as little as 0.0001 kg/hectare may be sufficient or as much as 8 kg/hectare may be required. For nonagronomic applications, effective use rates will range from about ] .0 to 50 mg/square meter but as little as 0.1 mg/square meter may be sufficient or as much as 150 mg/square meter may be required.<br>
15      One skilled in the art can easily determine the biologically effective amount necessary for the desired level of invertebrate pest control.<br>
The following TESTS demonstrate the control efficacy of compounds of this invention on specific pests. "Control efficacy" represents inhibition of invertebrate pest development (including mortality) that causes significantly reduced feeding. The pest control protection<br>
20      afforded by the compounds is not limited, however, to these species. See Index Tables A through F for compound descriptions.

BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION<br>
TESTA For evaluating control of diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) the test unit consisted of a small open container with a 12-14-day-old radish plant inside. This was pre-infested 5      with 10-15 neonate larvae on a piece of insect diet by use of a core sampler to remove a plug from a sheet of hardened insect diet having many larvae growing on it and transfer the plug containing larvae and diet to the test unit. The larvae moved onto the test plant as the diet plug dried out.<br>
