ANTIBODY MODIFICATION METHOD FOR PURIFYING BISPECIFIC ANTIBODY<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to methods of modifying antibodies for purification of bispecific antibodies, methods for separating the bispecific antibodies, and pharmaceutical compositions and such comprising the bispecific antibodies as active ingredients.<br>
Background Art<br>
Due to their highly stable nature in blood and relatively few side effects, antibodies have been receiving much attention as pharmaceuticals.    Of particular note are bispecific antibodies that can simultaneously recognize two types of antigens, e.g., antibody A and antibody B (see Non-Patent Document 1).    MDX-210, which is currently under clinical trial investigation, is an IgG-type bispecific antibody that retargets FcRI-expressing monocytes and such to HER-2/neu-expressing cancer cells (see Non-Patent Document 2).    In general, antibodies are produced using genetic recombination techniques.    One specific technique involves the cloning of a DNA encoding an antibody protein from antibody-producing cells, such as hybridomas or sensitized lymphocytes that produce antibodies or a phage library presenting antibody genes, and the insertion of such into a suitable vector, which is then transfected into host cells for antibody production.    Production of IgG type bispecific antibodies using genetic recombination techniques involves the introduction of a total of four types of genes into cells, in which these genes of H chains and L chains constitute two types of IgGs of interest, and the secretion of the antibodies by coexpression.    In this type of system, expression of the constituent genes of the wild type H chain and L chains leads to random association between two types of H chains and association between H and L chains, and thus, the proportion of the bispecific antibody of interest becomes very small.    More particularly, only one out often types produced is the bispecific antibody of interest, rendering the production efficiency quite low.    Decreased efficiency in the production of the antibody of interest is not only an obstacle for purifying the antibody of interest, but also increases the nonuniformity, such as the lot-to-lot differences, which, in turn, leads to swelling production costs.<br>
Techniques for obtaining L chains commonly shared by both H chains, and the knobs-into-holes technique for heterologous association of H chains have been reported as efficient bispecific antibody production methods for developing bispecific antibodies.    More specifically, a common L chain, which can maintain both antigen binding activities of the<br><br>
respective H chains that recognize antigen A and antigen B, is identified from a phage library or such.    Then, formation of H chain heterodimers is promoted by substituting an amino acid side chain present in the CH3 region of one of the H chains with a larger side chain (knob), and substituting an amino acid side chain present in the CH3 region of the other H chain with a smaller side chain (hole), to place the knob within the hole.    Thus, bispecific antibodies of interest can be efficiently obtained (see Patent Document 1, Non-Patent Document 3, and Non-Patent Document 4).<br>
However, even when the knobs-into-holes technique is used for H chain heterodimers, although the content of the chain A-chain B heterodimer of interest can be increased up to a maximum of about 95% as shown in Non-Patent Document 3 and Non-Patent Document 4, the remaining 5% is impurities and consists of chain A and chain B homodimers.    To develop bispecific antibodies as pharmaceuticals, the chain A-chain B heterodimers must be purified to the highest possible purity from the three types of molecular species (chain A homodimer, chain B homodimer, and chain A-chain B heterodimer) that are produced when a common L chain is used (Non-Patent Document 3 and Non-Patent Document 4).    Therefore, it is necessary to remove the 5% impurities, which are the chain A and chain B homodimers, thereby purifying the chain A-chain B heterodimer to a high purity that allows the heterodimer to be developed into a pharmaceutical.    When a common L chain is used without the knobs-into-holes technique, the production ratio of the chain A homodimer, chain A-chain B heterodimer, and chain B homodimer is theoretically 1:2:1, and the 50% impurities which are the chain A and chain B homodimers must be removed.<br>
Several chromatographic methods for separating the chain A-chain B heterodimer from the chain A and chain B homodimers at the level of pharmaceutical manufacturing have been reported.    Non-Patent Document 5 reports a method for selectively purifying the chain A-chain B heterodimer using mouse IgG2a as chain A and rat IgG2b as chain B.    This method uses difference between the respective mouse IgG2a and rat IgG2b H chains in their affinity for protein A, and purifies the chain A-chain B heterodimer by controlling the pH for elution from protein A.    However, since constant regions from mouse and rat are used, this method is difficult to apply to pharmaceuticals for human from the perspective of antigenicity. Furthermore, since this method cannot separate the chain A-chain B heterodimer, which is composed from H chains belonging to the same subclass, its use is limited.<br>
A method for purifying the chain A-chain B heterodimer using hydrophobic interaction chromatography is reported in Non-Patent Document 6.    However, the peak of the chain A-chain B heterodimer of interest containing anti-CD3 mouse IgG2a and anti-CD 19 mouse IgGl is not sufficiently separated.    In addition, H chains belonging to different subclasses are used, and the difference in their hydrophobicity seems to be used for the separation.    Thus, this<br><br>
method may not necessarily separate the chain A-chain B heterodimer composed from H chains belonging to the same subclass.<br>
A method for purifying the chain A-chain B heterodimer using thiophilic affinity chromatography is reported in Non-Patent Document 7.    However, this method cannot be adopted to separate the chain A-chain B heterodimer composed from H chains belonging to the same subclass, because it uses mouse IgGl and rat IgG2a, and the free cysteines (thiol groups) in the hinge regions.    In addition, since the free cysteines are involved in aggregation during storage, this method is not suitable for development of stable pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
Affinity chromatography using antigens is reported in Non-Patent Document 8. However, since affinity chromatography using proteins or peptide antigens is problematic in terms of cost and column stability, production of pharmaceuticals using affinity chromatography is unconventional.    Furthermore, to purify the chain A-chain B heterodimer that binds to both antigens, affinity chromatography must be performed twice, and this is expected to become costly.    It has been reported that there are antibodies that recognize only the three-dimensional structures of antigens as well as antibodies that have desired functions but low affinity.    For antibodies with such characteristics, it is difficult to adopt affinity chromatography that uses antigens.    Therefore, purification of bispecific antibodies using affinity chromatography cannot be used widely.<br>
As described above, purification of the chain A-chain B heterodimer of a bispecific antibody has been performed only within limited scope.    There has been no report on methods for purifying the chain A-chain B heterodimer of a bispecific antibody composed from the same H chain subclass and constant region sequence to a high purity that is acceptable for pharmaceuticals.    When two types of antibodies constituting a bispecific antibody have the same constant region sequence, the chain A-chain B heterodimer needs to be separated based solely on the differences in their variable region sequences.    However, since the amino acid sequence homology between antibody variable regions is very high (Non-Patent Document 9), it has been difficult to purify the chain A-chain B heterodimer to a high purity that is acceptable for pharmaceuticals solely based on the differences in their variable region sequences.<br>

An objective of the present invention is to provide methods for modifying the amino acids of antibody variable regions to efficiently purify bispecific antibodies, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the modified bispecific antibodies, and methods for producing the bispecific antibody pharmaceutical compositions.    Another objective of the present invention is to provide bispecific antibodies in which the heavy chain constant regions have been modified, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the modified bispecific antibodies, and methods for producing the bispecific antibody pharmaceutical compositions.<br><br>
 [Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
The present inventors conducted dedicated research on methods that substitute amino acids in antibody variable regions. These methods use a standard chromatography column to efficiently purify bispecific antibodies of interest which was conventionally challenging.<br>
The present inventors devised methods for efficiently purifying bispecific antibodies using a chromatography column based on the difference in isoelectric points of the H chains of two types of antibodies, and the difference is introduced by modifying the amino acids present on the surface of the variable regions of the two types of antibodies that constitute a bispecific antibody.    Specifically, the present inventors discovered sites of modification in the antibody H chain that enable regulation of the isoelectric point alone without reducing the antibody function (activity).    Furthermore, the present inventors confirmed that bispecific antibodies obtained by the methods of the present invention actually maintain their functions.<br>
As described above, the present inventors successfully developed methods for substituting amino acids in the antibody variable regions as efficient methods for purifying any bispecific antibody by using a standard chromatography column, and thereby completed the present invention.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present invention provides methods of modifying antibodies for production of multispecific antibodies.    A preferred embodiment of the production methods of the present invention is a method comprising modifying both or either one of a nucleic acid encoding the amino acid residues of a first polypeptide and a nucleic acid encoding the amino acid residues of a second polypeptide, so that the isoelectric points of the first polypeptide and second polypeptide will be different.    That is, multispecific antibodies can be produced based on differences in isoelectric point (pI), and the difference can be introduced into polypeptides by<br>
altering the charges of the amino acid residues in the first polypeptide and second polypeptide. More specifically, a preferred production method comprises the following steps of:<br>
(a)	modifying both or either one of a nucleic acid encoding the amino acid residues of the first polypeptide and a nucleic acid encoding the amino acid residues of the second polypeptide, so that the difference between the isoelectric points of the first polypeptide and second polypeptide will be increased;<br>
(b)	culturing host cells to express the nucleic acids; and<br>
(c)	collecting a multispecific antibody from the host cell culture.<br>
In the present invention, "polypeptides" generally refers to peptides and proteins whose length is approximately ten amino acids or longer.    Polypeptides are generally derived from organisms, but are not particularly limited thereto, and for example, they may be composed of an artificially designed sequence.    They may also be naturally derived polypeptides, synthetic polypeptides, recombinant polypeptides, or such.    Additionally, fragments of the above-mentioned polypeptides are also included in the polypeptides of the present invention.<br>
In the present invention, the phrase "the difference between the isoelectric points of the polypeptides" means that the isoelectric points of two or more polypeptides are made unequal by modifying the charges of the amino acids on the surface of each polypeptide.    The difference in the isoelectric points can be observed, for example, by using a technique such as isoelectric focusing.    In the present invention, the isoelectric points are preferably modified without altering the structure and/or function (activity) of the polypeptides.<br>
That is, the present invention provides a method for producing a multispecific antibody comprising a first polypeptide and a second polypeptide, wherein the method comprises the steps of:<br>
(a)	modifying both or either one of a nucleic acid encoding the amino acid residues of the first polypeptide and a nucleic acid encoding the amino acid residues of the second polypeptide, so that the difference between the isoelectric point of the first polypeptide and that of the second polypeptide will be 0.5 or more, preferably 0.7 or more, and more preferably 0.9 or more;<br>
(b)	culturing host cells to express the nucleic acids; and<br>
(c)	collecting the multispecific antibody from the host cell culture.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides methods of modifying antibodies for<br>
purification of multispecific antibodies.    A preferred embodiment of the purification methods of the present invention is a method comprising the step of modifying both or either one of a nucleic acid encoding the amino acid residues of a first polypeptide and a nucleic acid encoding the amino acid residues of a second polypeptide, so that the isoelectric points of the first polypeptide and second polypeptide will be different.    That is, the difference in isoelectric point<br><br>
 (pi) is introduced into the polypeptides by altering the charges of the amino acid residues of the first polypeptide and those of the second polypeptide.    Thus, multispecific antibodies can be purified using this difference in isoelectric points.    More specifically, a purification method comprises the following steps of:<br>
(a)	modifying both or either one of a nucleic acid encoding the amino acid residues of the first polypeptide and a nucleic acid encoding the amino acid residues of the second polypeptide, so that the difference between the isoelectric point of the first polypeptide and second polypeptide will be increased;<br>
(b)	culturing host cells to express the nucleic acids; and<br>
(c)	purifying said multispecific antibody from the host cell culture by standard chromatography.<br>
Methods for producing multispecific antibodies which comprise the purification steps of the above-mentioned purification methods are also included in the present invention.<br>
The nucleic acids of the present invention are generally cloned (inserted) into suitable vectors and then introduced into host cells.    These vectors are not particularly limited so long as the inserted nucleic acids are stably maintained.    For example, when Escherichia coli is used as a host, the cloning vectors are preferably pBluescript vectors (Stratagene) and such, while various commercially available vectors may be used.    When vectors are used for the purpose of producing the multispecific antibodies (polypeptides) of the present invention, expression vectors are particularly useful.    There is no particular limitation on expression vectors, so long as they can express polypeptides in test tubes, E. coli, cultured cells, or individual organisms. For example, preferred vectors include pBEST vectors (Promega) for expression in test tubes, pET vectors (Invitrogen) in E. coli, the pME18S-FL3 vector (GenBank Accession No. AB009864) in cultured cells, and the pME18S vector (Mol. Cell Biol. 8:466-472(1998)) in individual rganisms.    Insertion of the DNAs of the present invention into vectors can be performed, for example, by standard methods such as ligase reactions using restriction enzyme sites (Current protocols in Molecular Biology edit. Ausubel et al. (1987) Publish. John Wiley &amp; Sons. Section 11.4-11.11).<br>
There is no particular limitation on the above-mentioned host cells, and various host cells are used depending on the purpose.    Cells used for expressing polypeptides include bacterial cells (for example, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, E. coli, Streptomyces, and Bacillus subtilis), fungal cells (for example, yeast and Aspergillus), insect cells (for example, Drosophila S2 and Spodoptera SF9), animal cells (for example, CHO, COS, HeLa, C127, 3T3, BHK, HEK293, Bowes melanoma cell), and plant cells.    Vectors can be introduced into host cells using known methods, such as the calcium phosphate precipitation method, electroporation method (Current protocols in Molecular Biology edit. Ausubel et al. (1987) Publish. John Wiley<br><br>
&amp; Sons. Section 9.1-9.9), lipofection method, and microinjection method.<br>
For secreting host cell-expressed polypeptides into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, periplasmic space, or extracellular environment, suitable secretion signals can be incorporated into the polypeptides of interest.    These signals may be intrinsic or foreign to the polypeptides of interest.<br>
When the polypeptides of the present invention are secreted into culture media, the multispecific antibodies (polypeptides) produced by the above-mentioned methods can be harvested by collecting the media.    When the polypeptides of the present invention are produced inside cells, the cells first are lysed, and then these polypeptides are collected.<br>
The polypeptides of the present invention can be collected and purified from recombinant cell cultures using known methods, including ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acidic extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydroxyapatite chromatography, and lectin chromatography.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to compositions (agents) comprising a multispecific antibody of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
In the present invention, "pharmaceutical compositions" generally refers to agents for treating or preventing, or testing and diagnosing diseases.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be formulated by methods known to those skilled in the art.    For example, such pharmaceutical compositions can be used parenterally in the form of injections, which are sterile solutions or suspensions prepared with water or another pharmaceutically acceptable liquid.    For example, such compositions may be formulated by appropriately combining with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or medium, specifically, sterile water, physiological saline, vegetable oil, emulsifier, suspension, surfactant, stabilizer, flavoring agent, excipient, vehicle, preservative, binder, or such, and mixed in a unit dose form that meets the generally accepted requirements for preparation of pharmaceuticals. In such preparations, the amount of active ingredient is adjusted such that a suitable amount within a specified range is obtained.<br>
Sterile compositions for injection can be formulated using vehicles such as distilled water for injection, according to standard protocols for formulation.<br>
Aqueous solutions for injection include, for example, physiological saline and isotonic solutions containing glucose or other adjuvants (for example, D-sorbitol, D-mannose, D-mannitol, and sodium chloride).    Appropriate solubilizers. for example, alcohols (ethanol and such), polyalcohols (propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and such), non-ionic surfactants (polysorbate 80™, HCO-50, and such) may be used in combination.<br>
Oils include sesame and soybean oils.    Benzyl benzoate and/or benzyl alcohol can be<br><br>
used as solubilizers in combination.    Buffers (for example, phosphate buffer and sodium acetate buffer), soothing agents (for example, procaine hydrochloride), stabilizers (for example, benzyl alcohol and phenol), and/or antioxidants can also be combined.    Prepared injections are generally filled into appropriate ampules.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are preferably administered parenterally.    For example, the compositions may be in the form of injections, transnasal agents, transpulmonary agents, or transdermal agents.    For example, such compositions can be administered systemically or locally by intravenous injection, intramuscular injection, intraperitoneal injection, subcutaneous injection, or such.<br>
The administration methods can be appropriately selected in consideration of a patient's age and symptoms.    The dosage of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody or a polynucleotide encoding an antibody may be set, for example, within the range of 0.0001 to 1000 mg/kg weight for each administration.    Alternatively, the dosage may be, for example, from 0.001 to 100,000 mg per patient.    However, in the present invention, the dosage is not necessarily limited to the ranges described above.    Although the dosage and administration method vary depending on a patient's weight, age, symptoms, and such, those skilled in the art can select appropriate dosage and administration methods in consideration of the factors described above.<br>
The multispecific antibodies of the present invention can be formulated by combining with other pharmaceutical components as necessary.<br>
The present invention also provides nucleic acids encoding polypeptides that constitute the multispecific antibodies of the present invention.    Furthermore, vectors that carry these nucleic acids are also included in the present invention.<br>
The present invention also provides host cells carrying the above described nucleic acids.    The host cells are not particularly limited and include, for example, E coli and various animal cells.    The host cells may be used, for example, as a production system to produce and express the antibodies or polypeptides of the present invention.    There are in vitro and in vivo systems for production of polypeptides.    Production systems that use eukaryotic cells or prokaryotic cells are examples of an in vitro production system.<br>
Eukaryotic cells that can be used as host cells include, for example, animal cells, plant cells, and fungal cells.    Animal cells include: mammalian cells, for example, CHO (J. Exp. Med. (1995) 108, 945), COS, HEK293, 3T3, myeloma, BHK (baby hamster kidney), HeLa, and Vero; amphibian cells such as Xenopus laevis oocytes (Valle, et al, Nature (1981) 291: 338-340); and insect cells such as Sf9, Sf21, and Tn5.    For expressing the antibodies of the present invention, CHO-DG44, CHO-DX11B, COS7 cells, HEK293 cells, and BHK cells can be suitably used. Of the animal cells, CHO cells are particularly preferable for large-scale expression.    Vectors<br><br>
can be introduced into a host cell by, for example, calcium phosphate methods, DEAE-dextran methods, methods using cationic liposome DOTAP (Boehringer-Mannheim), electroporation methods, or lipofection methods.<br>
It is known that plant cells such as Nicotiana tabacum-derived cells and Lemna minor cells are protein production systems, and these cells can be used to produce antibodies of the present invention by methods that culture calluses from these cells.    Protein expression systems that use fungal cells including yeast cells, for example, cells of the genus Saccharomyces (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces pombe, etc.), and cells of filamentous fungi, for example, the genus Aspergillus (Aspergillus niger, etc.) are known, and these cells can be used as a host to produce antibodies of the present invention.<br>
When prokaryotic cells are used, production systems that use bacterial cells are available.    Production systems that use bacterial cells including Bacillus subtilis as well as E. coli described above are known, and they can be used to produce antibodies of the present invention.<br>
When an antibody is produced using a host cell of the present invention, a polynucleotide encoding an antibody of the present invention may be expressed by culturing the host cell transformed with an expression vector comprising the polynucleotide.    Culturing can be performed according to known methods.    For example, when animal cells are used as a host, DMEM, MEM, RPMI 1640, or IMDM may be used as the culture medium.    The culture medium may be used with serum supplement solutions such as FBS or fetal calf serum (FCS). Alternatively, cells can be cultured in serum-free cultures.    The preferred pH is about 6 to 8 during the course of culturing.    Incubation is carried out typically at about 30 to 40°C for about 15 to 200 hours.    Medium is exchanged, aerated, or agitated, as necessary.<br>
On the other hand, systems for producing polypeptides in vivo include, for example, those using animals and those using plants.    A polynucleotide of interest is introduced into an animal or plant to produce the polypeptide in the body of the animal or the plant, and then the polypeptide is collected.    The "host" of the present invention includes such animals and plants.<br>
When animals are used, production systems that use mammals or insects are available. Mammals such as goat, pig, sheep, mouse, and cattle may be used (Vicki Glaser, SPECTRUM Biotechnology Applications (1993)).    When mammals are used, transgenic animals may be used.<br>
For example, a polynucleotide encoding a antibody of the present invention may be prepared as a fusion gene with a gene encoding a polypeptide specifically produced in milk, such as goat P-casein.    Next, polynucleotide fragments containing this fusion gene are injected into goat embryos, which are then introduced back into female goats.    The antibody of interest can be obtained from milk produced by the transgenic goats, which are born from the goats that<br><br>
received the embryos, or by their offspring.    Appropriate hormones may be administered to the transgenic goats to increase the volume of milk containing the antibody produced by the transgenic goats (Ebert et al, Bio/Technology (1994) 12: 699-702).<br>
Insects such as silkworms may be used for producing antibodies of the present invention. When silkworms are used, baculoviruses carrying a polynucleotide encoding an antibody of interest can be used to infect silkworms, so that the antibody of interest can be obtained from the body fluids of these silkworms (Susumu et al, Nature (1985) 315:592-594).<br>
Plants used for producing antibodies of the present invention include, for example, tobacco.    When tobacco is used, a polynucleotide encoding an antibody of interest is inserted into a plant expression vector, for example, pMON 530, and then the vector is introduced into a bacterium such as Agrobacterium tumefaciens.    The bacteria are then used to infect tobacco such as Nicotiana tabacum, and the desired antibody can be obtained from the leaves of the tobacco (Ma et al, Eur. J. Immunol. (1994) 24: 131-138).    Alternatively, the same bacteria can be used to infect Lemna minor, and after cloning, the desired antibody can be obtained from the cells of Lemna minor (Cox K.M. et al, Nat. Biotechnol. 2006 Dec; 24(12):1591-1597).<br>
The antibody thus obtained may be isolated from the inside or outside (such as the medium and milk) of host cells, and purified as a substantially pure and homogenous antibody. Methods used for separating and purifying an antibody are not limited, and methods used in standard polypeptide purification may be applied.    Antibodies may be isolated and purified by selecting an appropriate combination of, for example, chromatographic columns, filtration, ultrafiltration, salting-out, solvent precipitation, solvent extraction, distillation, immunoprecipitation, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, dialysis, recrystallization, and such.<br>
Chromatographies include, for example, affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography, gel filtration, reverse-phase chromatography, and adsorption chromatography (Strategies for Protein Purification and Characterization: A Laboratory Course Manual. Ed Daniel R. Marshak et al, (1996) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press).    These chromatographies can be carried out using liquid phase chromatography such as HPLC and FPLC.    Examples of columns for affinity chromatography include protein A columns and protein G columns.    Examples of the columns that use protein A include Hyper D, POROS, and Sepharose F. F. (Pharmacia).<br>
An antibody can be modified arbitrarily, and peptides can be deleted partially from the antibody by treatment with an appropriate protein modifying enzyme before or after antibody purification, as necessary.    Such protein modifying enzymes include, for example, trypsins, chymotrypsins, lysyl endopeptidases, protein kinases, and glucosidases.<br>
Another preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a method for producing<br><br>
a multispecific antibody of the present invention, wherein the method comprises the steps of culturing the host cells of the present invention as described above and collecting the polypeptide from the cell culture.<br>
In the present invention, the term "multispecific antibody" refers to an antibody that can specifically bind to at least two different types of antigens.    Examples of preferred multispecific antibodies obtained by the production methods or purification methods of the present invention include bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) (also called dual-specificity antibodies) that can specifically bind to two antigens.<br>
In the present invention, the term "different antigens" does not necessarily mean that the antigens themselves are different, and may mean that the epitopes are different.    Therefore, for example, different epitopes within a single molecule are also included in the "different antigens" of the present invention.    In the present invention, two antibodies that recognize different epitopes within a single molecule are regarded as antibodies that recognize different antigens.<br>
The multispecific antibodies of the present invention are antibodies having specificity to two or more different antigens, or molecules comprising fragments of such antibodies.<br>
In the above-mentioned methods of the present invention, the phrase "modification of nucleic acids" comprises modification of nucleic acids that results in separated peaks of a first polypeptide and a second polypeptide by standard chromatography analysis.<br>
In the methods of the present invention, the phrase "modification of nucleic acids" refers to modifying nucleic acids that correspond to the amino acid residues that are introduced by "modification" of the present invention.    More specifically, the phrase refers to altering nucleic acids encoding the original amino acid residues (before modification) to nucleic acids encoding amino acid residues that are introduced by the modification.<br>
Usually, the phrase means gene manipulation or mutagenesis that modifies the original nucleic acids by inserting, deleting, or substituting at least one nucleotide, to produce a codon that encodes an amino acid residue of interest.    More specifically, a codon encoding the original amino acid residue is replaced by a codon encoding the amino acid residue to be introduced by the modification.    Such nucleic acid modifications can be carried out appropriately by those skilled in the art using known techniques, for example, site-directed mutagenesis or PCR mutagenesis.<br>
The modification positions in the present invention include, for example, (1) amino acid residues on the surface of a polypeptide, (2) amino acid residues in the variable region, preferably in the FR region, and (3) amino acid residues in the constant region.<br>
"Amino acids on the surface of a polypeptide" are amino acids whose side chains can contact solvent molecules (usually water molecules).    It is not necessary for the entire side chain to be in contact with solvent molecules, and even if only part of the side chain is in contact<br><br>
with solvent molecules, the amino acid is considered to be an amino acid on surface.    Those skilled in the art can produce homology models of polypeptides or antibodies by homology modeling and such using commercially available software, and thereby selecting appropriate residues as amino acids on the surface.<br>
Those skilled in the art can suitably select surface amino acids in the antibody variable region using homology models produced by homology modeling and such.    For example, in the H chain FR region, HI, H3, H5, H8, H10, H12, H13, H15, H16, H19, H23, H25, H26, H39, H42, H43, H44, H46, H68, H71, H72, H73, H75, H76, H81, H82b, H83, H85, H86, H105, H108, HI 10, and HI 12 are examples of surface amino acids.    However, the surface amino acids of the present invention are not limited thereto.    For the H chain CDR region, surface amino acids can be similarly selected using homology models.    For example, H97 is exposed to the surface in most antibodies.    In the L chain FR region, LI, L3, L7, L8, L9, Lll, L12, L16, L17, L18, L20, L22, L38, L39, L41, L42, L43, L45, L46, L49, L57, L60, L63, L65, L66, L68, L69, L70, L74, L76, L77, L79, L80, L81, L85, L100, L103, L105, L106, L107, and L108 are examples of surface amino acids.    However, the surface amino acids of the present invention are not limited thereto.    Furthermore, for the L chain CDR region, surface amino acids can be similarly selected using homology models.<br>
In the present invention, amino acid residues in the variable region include amino acid residues in the heavy chain variable region (VH) or light chain variable region (VL), and are preferably amino acid residues in the framework region (FR).<br>
In the present invention, surface-exposed amino acids other than those in CDR are, for example, H10, H12, H23, H39, H43, and H105 in the FR region, but are not limited thereto.<br>
In the present invention, polypeptides with nucleic acid modification are preferably a homomultimer of a first polypeptide, a homomultimer of a second polypeptide, and a heteromultimer of the first polypeptide and second polypeptide.    As described in the Examples below, the homomultimer of a first polypeptide is, for example, a homodimer of the humanized A69-H chain and humanized BBA-L chain; a homomultimer of a second polypeptide is, for example, a homodimer of the humanized B26-H chain and humanized BBA-L chain; and a heteromultimer of a first polypeptide and a second polypeptide is, for example, a heterodimer of the humanized A69-H chain, humanized B26-H chain, and humanized BBA-L chain.    However, the polypeptides are not limited thereto.<br>
Examples of standard chromatography in the present invention include cation exchange chromatography, anion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography, hydroxyapatite chromatography, hydrophobic charge interaction chromatography, and chromatofocusing.<br>
In the above-mentioned methods of the present invention, a first polypeptide and a second polypeptide preferably comprise a heavy chain variable region (VH).    The variable<br><br>
region may comprise, for example, a complementary determining region (CDR) and a framework region (FR).<br>
The number of amino acid residues that undergo modification in the methods of the present invention is not particularly limited.    However, for example, when the variable region(s) of an antibody is modified, it is preferable that for the separation of polypeptides of interest, the number of modified amino acid residues be kept to the minimum as necessary, so as not to decrease the antigen binding activity or increase the antigenicity of the antibody.<br>
In order to not increase the antigenicity, the amino acid sequences after modification in the present invention are preferably human sequences, but are not limited thereto.    Furthermore, in order to turn each of the modified FRs (FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4) into a human sequence, mutations may be introduced into positions other than those that have been modified for alteration of isoelectric point.    The method of replacing each FR with a human sequence in this manner has been reported in a Non-Patent Document (Ono K. et al, Mol. Immunol. 1999 Apr; 36(6):387-395).    Furthermore, to alter the isoelectric point of each FR, the FR can be modified into another human FR having a different isoelectric point (for example, FR3 can be replaced with another human FR having a lower isoelectric point).    Such a humanization method has been reported in a Non-Patent Document (DalF Acqua WR, Methods. 2005 May; 36(l):43-60).<br>
Furthermore, when separation of the polypeptides of interest cannot be achieved by slight modifications to the surface charge, the desired multispecific antibody can be obtained by repeating modification of surface charge and evaluation of polypeptide separation.<br>
Furthermore, in the above-mentioned methods of the present invention, a multispecific antibody preferably comprises a third polypeptide comprising a light chain variable region, and preferably, the first polypeptide and the second polypeptide each forms a multimer with the third polypeptide.<br>
Additionally, in the above-mentioned methods of the present invention, a first polypeptide and a second polypeptide preferably comprise a heavy chain constant region that preferably generates different pis for the first polypeptide and second polypeptide.    Examples of such heavy chain constant regions include heavy chain constant regions of antibodies having different pis.    The pi difference can be introduced into the first polypeptide and the second polypeptide using the heavy chain constant regions of IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4 which have pis that are originally different from each other.    Alternatively, the amino acids in the heavy chain constant regions of the first polypeptide and the second polypeptide that cause differences in isoelectric point among these subclasses can be modified alone, or in combination with adjacent amino acids that do not have any effect on the isoelectric points to generate non-wild-type human constant regions, and pi difference can be introduced into the two constant regions. Examples of positions to be modified for introducing pi difference into the constant regions<br><br>
include, for example, positions 137, 196, 203, 214, 217, 233, 268, 274, 276, 297, 355, 392, 419, and 435, EU numbering, in the H chain constant region.<br>
Furthermore, since removal of sugar chains from a heavy chain constant region generates pi difference, position 297, which is a glycosylated site, is another example of a position to be modified for introducing pi difference.<br>
For methods that comprise the above-mentioned first polypeptide and second polypeptide comprising a heavy chain constant region, methods that combine with the method in which the above-mentioned first polypeptide and second polypeptide comprise a heavy chain variable region, and/or the method in which the multispecific antibody comprises a third polypeptide comprising a light chain variable region, and a first polypeptide and a second polypeptide that each forms a multimer with the third polypeptide, are included in the present invention.<br>
Multispecific antibodies produced by the above-mentioned methods are also included in the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, in an embodiment, when the first polypeptide in the multispecific antibody provided by the present invention comprises a heavy chain variable region and/or a heavy chain constant region, at least one amino acid residue in the region is made to carry a charge so that "the isoelectric points will be different".    For example, the amino acid residue(s) is selected from amino acid residues at positions 10, 12, 23, 39, 43, and 105, Kabat numbering, in the heavy chain variable region, or amino acid residues at positions 137, 196, 203, 214, 217, 233, 268, 274, 276, 297, 355, 392, 419, and 435, EU numbering, in the heavy chain constant region.    Of the amino acid residues of the first polypeptide indicated by the above-mentioned numbering, amino acid residues other than the charged amino acid residue may have the same type of charge as that of the charged amino acid residue, or may be uncharged, or may have the opposite charge of that of the charged amino acid residue, as long as the isoelectric point of the first polypeptide and that of the second polypeptide are different.<br>
The above-mentioned multispecific antibodies of the present invention comprise a second polypeptide that preferably has the opposite charge of that of the charged amino acid residue in the first polypeptide, or is uncharged.    More specifically, the second polypeptide in the multispecific antibodies comprises a heavy chain variable region and/or a heavy chain constant region, and at least one amino acid residue in the region is uncharged or has the opposite charge of that of the amino acid residue selected to carry a charge in the heavy chain variable region and/or the heavy chain constant region in the first polypeptide.    The amino acid residue(s) is selected from amino acid residues at positions 10,12, 23, 39, 43, and 105, Kabat numbering, in the heavy chain variable region, or amino acid residues at positions 137, 196, 203, 214, 217, 233, 268, 274, 276, 297, 355, 392, 419, and 435, EU numbering, in the heavy chain<br><br>
constant region.    Of the amino acid residues of the second polypeptide indicated by the above-mentioned numbering, amino acid residues other than the charged amino acid residue may have the same type of charge as that of the charged amino acid residue, or may be uncharged, or may have the opposite charge of that of the charged amino acid residue, as long as the isoelectric point of the first polypeptide and that of the second polypeptide are different.<br>
To lower isoelectric points, it is desirable to apply, for example, an IgG2 or IgG4 sequence to position 137, an IgGl, IgG2, or IgG4 sequence to position 196, an IgG2 or IgG4 sequence to position 203, an IgG2 sequence to position 214, an IgGl, IgG3, or IgG4 sequence to position 217, an IgGl, IgG3, or IgG4 sequence to position 233, an IgG4 sequence to position 268, an IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4 sequence to position 274, an IgGl, IgG2, or IgG4 sequence to position 276, an IgG4 sequence to position 355, an IgG3 sequence to position 392, an IgG4 sequence to position 419, and an IgGl, IgG2, or IgG4 sequence to position 435.    To increase isoelectric points, it is desirable to apply, for example, an IgGl or IgG3 sequence to position 137, an IgG3 sequence to position 196, the IgGl or IgG3 sequence to position 203, an IgGl, IgG3, or IgG4 sequence to position 214, an IgG2 sequence to position 217, an IgG2 sequence to position 233, an IgGl, IgG2, or IgG3 sequence to position 268, an IgGl sequence to position 274, an IgG3 sequence to position 276, an IgGl, IgG2, or IgG3 sequence to position 355, an IgGl, IgG2, or IgG4 sequence to position 392, an IgGl, IgG2, or IgG3 sequence to position 419, and an IgG3 sequence to position 435.<br>
It is not necessary to apply all of these sequences, as long as there is sufficient difference between the isoelectric points of the two H chains.<br>
Some amino acids are known to be charged amino acids.    Generally, lysine (K), arginine (R), and histidine (H) are known as positively charged amino acids (cationic amino acids).    Aspartic acid (D), glutamic acid (E), and such are known as negatively charged amino acids (anionic amino acids).<br>
Preferably, the above-mentioned "charged amino acid residues" are suitably selected from amino acid residues included in either one of groups (a) and (b) below, but are not particularly limited thereto:<br>
(a)	glutamic acid (E), and aspartic acid (D); and<br>
(b)	lysine (K), arginine (R), and histidine (H).<br>
Regarding the above-mentioned antibodies, the phrase "having the same type of charge" means, for example, that the above-mentioned amino acid residue in the heavy chain variable region according to Kabat numbering and the above-mentioned amino acid residue in the heavy chain constant region according to EU numbering both carry an amino acid residue included in either one of the above-mentioned groups (a) and (b).<br>
The phrase, "having the opposite charge" means that, for example, at least one of the<br>
above-mentioned amino acid residues, by Kabat numbering or EU numbering, in the second polypeptide comprising a heavy chain variable region and/or a heavy chain constant region is included in either one of the above-mentioned groups (a) or (b), and its corresponding amino acid residue at a position in the heavy chain variable region and/or heavy chain constant region comprised in the first polypeptide is included in the other group.<br>
More specifically, the present invention provides multispecific antibodies, in which the above-mentioned amino acid residues having the same type of charge are selected from the amino acid residues included in either one of the above-mentioned group (a) or (b).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, if the original amino acid residue (before modification) is already charged, it may be modified to be an uncharged amino acid residue.<br>
In the present invention, an amino acid residue is preferably modified such that the isoelectric point (pi) of the first polypeptide and that of the second polypeptide will be different. Furthermore, when multiple amino acid residues are introduced by modification, a few uncharged amino acid residues may be included in these amino acid residues.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides multispecific antibodies, wherein the variable region of the first polypeptide comprises the amino acid sequence of any one of (al) to (a7) below, wherein the variable region of the second polypeptide comprises the amino acid sequence of any one of (bl) to (b3) below, and wherein the variable region of the third polypeptide comprises the amino acid sequence of (cl) or (c2) below:<br>
(al)SEQ ID NO:7<br>
(a2) SEQ ID NO: 8<br>
(a3) SEQ ID NO: 9<br>
(a4) SEQ ID NO: 10<br>
(a5) SEQ ID NO: 11<br>
(a6) SEQ ID NO: 12<br>
(a7) SEQ ID NO: 13<br>
(bl) SEQ ID NO: 14<br>
(b2) SEQ ID NO: 15<br>
(b3) SEQ ID NO: 16<br>
(cl) SEQ ID NO: 17<br>
(c2) SEQ ID NO: 18<br>
The above amino acid sequences are specific examples of the amino acids subjected to modification in the present invention.    However, the variable regions are not limited to those comprising these amino acids.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the above-mentioned multispecific antibodies is, for<br><br>
example, a multispecific antibody, wherein the variable region of the first polypeptide comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 11, wherein the variable region of the second polypeptide comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 16, and wherein the variable region of the third polypeptide comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 17.<br>
Another preferred embodiment is, for example, a multispecific antibody, wherein the variable region of the first polypeptide comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 12, wherein the variable region of the second polypeptide comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 16, and wherein the variable region of the third polypeptide comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 18.<br>
A further preferred embodiment of the above-mentioned multispecific antibody is a multispecific antibody, wherein the first polypeptide and the second polypeptide comprise the human IgG4 constant region, and wherein the third polypeptide comprises the human K constant region.<br>
Herein, the term "antibody" is used in the broadest sense, and includes monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, and mutant antibodies, such as chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, minibodies (including antibody fragments), and multispecific antibodies, as long as they display a desired biological activity.    In the present invention, the methods of antibody modification of the present invention can be used favorably on these antibodies when they are obtained (produced).<br>
The "antibodies" of the present invention include antibodies in which the charge of amino acid residues has been modified as described above, and whose amino acid sequences have been further modified by amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions, and/or insertions. The antibodies also include antibodies whose amino acid sequences have been modified by amino acid substitution, deletion, addition, and/or insertion, or chimerization, humanization, or such, and in which the charge of amino acid residues has been further modified.    In short, modifications may be performed at the same time when mouse antibodies are humanized, or further modifications may be performed on humanized antibodies.<br>
Amino acid sequence modifications, such as amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions, and/or insertions, and humanization and chimerization, can be achieved by methods known to those skilled in the art.    When the antibodies of the present invention are prepared as recombinant antibodies, likewise, the amino acid sequences of the antibody variable and constant regions may also be modified by amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions, and/or insertions, or chimerization, humanization and the like.<br>
The antibodies of the present invention may be derived from any animal, such as a mouse, human, rat, rabbit, goat, or camel.    Furthermore, the antibodies may be modified, for example, chimeric antibodies, and in particular, modified antibodies that include amino acid<br><br>
substitutions in their sequence, such as humanized antibodies.    The antibodies may be any type of antibody, such as antibody modification products linked with various molecules, antibody fragments, and minibodies.<br>
"Chimeric antibodies" are antibodies prepared by combining sequences derived from different animals.    An example is an antibody having heavy and light chain variable (V) regions from a mouse antibody and heavy and light chain constant (C) regions from a human antibody. Chimeric antibodies can be prepared by known methods.    To obtain such chimeric antibodies, for example, a DNA encoding an antibody V region may be ligated with a DNA encoding a human antibody C region; the resulting ligation product can be inserted into an expression vector; and the construct can be introduced into a host to produce the chimeric antibody.<br>
"Humanized antibodies" are also referred to as reshaped human antibodies, and can be obtained by substituting the complementary determining region (CDR) of a human antibody for the CDR of an antibody derived from a nonhuman mammal, for example, a mouse.    Methods for identifying CDRs are known in the art (Kabat et al., Sequence of Proteins of Immunological Interest (1987), National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md.; Chothia et al, Nature (1989) 342:877).    General genetic recombination techniques suitable for this purpose are also known (see European Patent Application EP 125023; and WO 96/02576).    For example, the CDR of a mouse antibody can be determined by known methods, and a DNA can be prepared such that it encodes an antibody in which the CDR is ligated with the framework region (FR) of a human antibody.    A humanized antibody can then be produced using a system that uses conventional expression vectors.    Such DNAs can be synthesized by PCR, using as primers several oligonucleotides designed to include portions that overlap the ends of both the CDR and FR regions (see the method described in WO 98/13388).    Human antibody FRs linked via CDRs are selected such that the CDRs form a suitable antigen binding site.    If required, amino acids in the FRs of an antibody variable region may be substituted so that the CDRs of the reshaped human antibody can form a suitable antigen binding site (Sato, K. et al., Cancer Res. (1993) 53:851-856).    Modifiable amino acid residues in the FRs include portions that directly bind to an antigen via non-covalent bonds (Amit et al., Science (1986) 233: 747-53), portions that have some impact or effect on the CDR structure (Chothia et al, J. Mol. Biol. (1987) 196: 901-17), and portions involved in the interaction between VH and VL (EP 239400).<br>
When the antibodies of the present invention are chimeric antibodies or humanized antibodies, the C regions of these antibodies are preferably derived from human antibodies.    For example, Cl, C2, C3, and C4 can be used for the H chain, while CK and C, can be used for the L chain.    Meanwhile, the human antibody C region may be modified as required to improve antibody or production stability.    A chimeric antibody of the present invention preferably includes a variable region of an antibody derived from a nonhuman mammal and a constant<br><br>
region of a human antibody.    A humanized antibody preferably includes CDRs of an antibody derived from a nonhuman mammal and FRs and C regions of a human antibody.    The constant regions of the human antibodies include specific amino acid sequences, which vary depending on the isotype of the antibody, for example, IgG (IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4), IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE.    The constant regions used to prepare the humanized antibodies of the present invention may be the constant regions of antibodies of any isotype.    A constant region of human IgG is preferably used, although the invention is not limited thereto.    The FRs derived from a human antibody, which are used to prepare the humanized antibodies, are not particularly limited, and thus may be derived from an antibody of any isotype.<br>
The variable and constant regions of chimeric or humanized antibodies of the present invention may be modified by deletion, substitution, insertion, and/or addition, so long as the antibodies exhibit the same binding specificity as that of the original antibodies.<br>
Since their antigenicity in the human body has been attenuated, chimeric and humanized antibodies using human-derived sequences are expected to find utility when administered to humans for therapeutic purposes or such.<br>
In addition, minibodies are useful as the antibodies because of their in vivo kinetic characteristics and low-cost production using E. coli, plant cells, or such.<br>
Antibody fragments are one type of minibody.    The term "minibodies" includes antibodies that include an antibody fragment as a partial structural unit.    The minibodies of the present invention are not particularly limited by their structure nor their method of production, so long as they have antigen binding activity.    Some minibodies have an activity greater than that of a whole antibody (Orita et al, Blood (2005) 105:562-566).    Herein, the "antibody fragments" are not particularly limited, so long as they are a portion of a whole antibody (for example, whole IgG).    However, the antibody fragments preferably include a heavy chain variable region (VH) or a light chain variable region (VL).    Examples of preferred antibody fragments are: Fab, F(ab')2, Fab', and Fv.    The amino acid sequence of a VH or VL in an antibody fragment may be modified by substitution, deletion, addition, and/or insertion. Furthermore, some portions of a VH and VL may be deleted, so long as the resulting fragments retain their antigen binding ability.    For example, of the antibody fragments described above, "Fv" is a minimal antibody fragment composed of the complete antigen recognition and binding sites.    "Fv" is a dimer (VH-VL dimer) composed of one unit of VH and one unit of VL bound very strongly by non-covalent bonding.    An antigen binding site is formed on the surface of the VH-VL dimer by the three complementary determining regions (CDRs) of each variable region. Six CDRs confer an antigen binding site to the antibody.    However, even one variable region (or half of an Fv composed of only three antigen-specific CDRs) has the ability to recognize and bind to an antigen, although its affinity is lower than that of the complete binding site.    Thus,<br><br>
molecules smaller than Fv are also included in the context of antibody fragments of the present invention.    The variable regions of an antibody fragment may also be chimerized or humanized. The minibodies preferably include both VH and VL.    Examples of suitable minibodies include antibody fragments such as Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, and Fv, and scFv (single-chain Fv), which can be prepared using antibody fragments, (Huston et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA<br>

Research (2000) 60:4336-41).<br>
An antibody fragment can be prepared by treating an antibody with an enzyme, for example, a protease such as papain or pepsin (see Morimoto et al, J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods (1992) 24: 107-17; Brennan et al, Science (1985) 229:81).    Alternatively, antibody fragments can also be produced by genetic recombination based on its amino acid sequence.<br>
A minibody having a structure that results from modification of an antibody fragment can be prepared using antibody fragments obtained by enzyme treatment or genetic recombination.    Alternatively, after constructing a gene which encodes a whole minibody, and introducing the construct into an expression vector, the minibody may be expressed in appropriate host cells (see, for example, Co et al, J. Immunol. (1994) 152: 2968-76; Better and Horwitz, Methods Enzymol. (1989) 178: 476-96; Pluckthun and Skerra, Methods Enzymol.<br>

Methods Enzymol. (1986) 121: 663-9; Bird and Walker, Trends Biotechnol. (1991) 9: 132-7).<br>
The above described scFVs are single-chain polypeptides that include two variable regions linked together via a linker or such, as required.    The two variable regions in an scFv are typically one VH and one VL, but an scFv may include two VH or two VL.    In general, scFv polypeptides include a linker between the VH and VL domains, thereby forming a paired portion of VH and VL required for antigen binding.    A peptide linker composed often or more amino acids is typically used as the linker between VH and VL when forming an intramolecular paired portion between VH and VL.    However, the linkers of the scFv of the present invention are not limited to such peptide linkers, so long as they do not inhibit the formation of an scFv. To review scFv, see Pluckthun "The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibody", Vol. 113 (Rosenburg and Moore ed., Springer Verlag, NY, pp.269-315 (1994)).<br><br>
The term, "diabodies (Db)" refers to bivalent antibody fragments constructed by gene fusion (P. Holliger et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 6444-6448 (1993); EP 404,097; W093/11161 and such).    Diabodies are dimers composed of two polypeptide chains, wherein each polypeptide chain includes within the same chain a light chain variable region (VL) and a heavy chain variable region (VH) connected with a linker short enough to disable interaction of these two regions, for example a linker of about five amino acid residues.    VL and VH encoded on the same polypeptide chain will form a dimer because the linker between VL and VH is too short to form a single chain V region fragment.    Therefore, the resulting diabody has two antigen-binding sites.    Herein, when VL and VH directed against two different epitopes (a and b) are expressed simultaneously as combinations of VLa-VHb and VLb-VHa connected with a linker of about five residues, they are secreted as bispecific Db.<br>
Since diabodies include two molecules of scFvs, they thus composed of four variable regions, and as a result have two antigen binding sites.    When the objective is to form a diabody, unlike as in the case with scFvs that do not form dimers, ordinarily, linkers forming a connection between VH and VL in each scFv molecules are linkers of about five amino acids when used as peptide linkers.    However, scFv linkers for diabody formation are not limited to such peptide linkers so long as they do not interfere with scFv expression and diabody formation.<br>
More preferably, in the present invention, an example of a multispecific antibody is a bispecific antibody.<br>
The above-mentioned "bispecific antibody" may be, for example, an antibody having a structure in which a heavy chain variable region and a light chain variable region are linked in a single chain (for example, sc(Fv)2).    The bispecific antibody may also be an antibody-like molecule (for example, scFv-Fc) produced by fusing an scFv (or sc(Fv)2), in which a heavy chain variable region and a light chain variable region are linked, to an Fc region (a constant region lacking the CHI domain).    A multispecific antibody consisting of scFv-Fc has an (scFv)2-Fc type structure with VHl-linker-VLl-Fc as the first polypeptide and VH2-linker-VL2-Fc as the second polypeptide.    Alternatively, the bispecific antibody may be an antibody-like molecule in which a single domain antibody is linked with an Fc region (Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. 2006, 9(2), 184-93).<br>
As for the genes encoding the H chain or L chain of antibodies before introduction of mutations by methods of the present invention (herein, it may be simply referred to as "an antibody of the present invention"), known sequences can be used, or they can be obtained by methods known to those skilled in the art.    For example, they may be obtained from an antibody library, or they may be obtained by cloning genes encoding the antibody from hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies.<br>
Regarding antibody libraries, many antibody libraries are already well known, and since<br><br>
methods for producing antibody libraries are known, those skilled in the art can appropriately obtain antibody libraries.    For example, regarding antibody phage libraries, one can refer to the literature such as Clackson et al, Nature 1991, 352: 624-8; Marks et al, J. Mol. Biol. 1991, 222: 581-97; Waterhouses et al, Nucleic Acids Res. 1993, 21: 2265-6; Griffiths et al, EMBO J. 1994, 13: 3245-60; Vaughan et al, Nature Biotechnology 1996, 14: 309-14; and Japanese Patent Kohyo Publication No. (JP-A) H20-504970 (unexamined Japanese national phase publication corresponding to a non-Japanese international publication).    In addition, known methods, such as methods that use eukaryotic cells as libraries (W095/15393) and ribosome display methods, may be used.    Furthermore, techniques to obtain human antibodies by panning using human antibody libraries are also known.    For example, variable regions of human antibodies can be expressed on the surface of phages as single chain antibodies (scFvs) using phage display methods, and phages that bind to antigens can be selected.    Genetic analysis of the selected phages can determine the DNA sequences encoding the variable regions of human antibodies that bind to the antigens.    Once the DNA sequences of scFvs that bind to the antigens is revealed, suitable expression vectors can be produced based on these sequences to obtain human antibodies.    These methods are already well known, and one can refer to WO92/01047, WO92/20791, WO93/06213, W093/11236, W093/19172, WO95/01438, and W095/15388.<br>
As for methods for obtaining genes encoding antibodies from hybridomas, known techniques may be used, involving the use of desired antigens or cells expressing the desired antigens as sensitizing antigens, using these to perform immunizations according to conventional immunization methods, fusing the immune cells thus obtained with known parent cells by ordinary cell fusion methods, screening monoclonal antibody producing cells (hybridomas) by ordinary screening methods, synthesizing cDNAs of antibody variable regions (V regions) from mRNAs of the obtained hybridomas using reverse transcriptase, and linking them with DNAs encoding the desired antibody constant regions (C regions).<br>
More specifically, without being particular limited to the following examples, sensitizing antigens for obtaining the above-mentioned antibody genes encoding the H chains and L chains include both complete antigens with immunogenicity and incomplete antigens composed of haptens and such that do not show antigenicity.    For example, full length proteins and partial peptides of proteins of interest can be used.    In addition, it is known that substances composed of polysaccharides, nucleic acids, lipids, and such may become antigens.    Thus, there are no particular limitations on antigens of the antibodies of the present invention.    Antigens can be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art, and they can be prepared, for example, by the following methods using baculoviruses (for example, W098/46777). Hybridomas can be produced, for example, the following methods of Milstein et al (G. Kohler and C. Milstein, Methods Enzymol. 1981, 73: 3-46), and such.    When the immunogenicity of an<br><br>
antigen is low, it can be linked to a macromolecule that has immunogenicity, such as albumin, and then used for immunization.    Furthermore, by linking antigens with other molecules if necessary, they can be converted into soluble antigens.    When transmembrane molecules such as receptors are used as antigens, portions of the extracellular regions of the receptors can be used as a fragment, or cells expressing transmembrane molecules on their cell surface may be used as immunogens.<br>
Antibody-producing cells can be obtained by immunizing animals using suitable sensitizing antigens described above.    Alternatively, antibody-producing cells can be prepared by in vitro immunization of lymphocytes that can produce antibodies.    Various mammals can be used as the animals for immunization, where rodents, lagomorphas and primates are generally used.    Examples of such animals include mice, rats, and hamsters for rodents, rabbits for lagomorphas, and monkeys including the cynomolgus monkey, rhesus monkey, hamadryas, and chimpanzees for primates.    In addition, transgenic animals carrying human antibody gene repertoires are also known, and human antibodies can be obtained by using these animals (see WO96/34096; Mendez et al., Nat. Genet. 1997, 15:146-56).    Instead of using such transgenic animals, for example, desired human antibodies having binding activity against antigens can be obtained by in vitro sensitization of human lymphocytes with desired antigens or cells expressing the desired antigens, and then fusing the sensitized lymphocytes with human myeloma cells such as U266 (see Japanese Patent Application Kokoku Publication No. (JP-B) Hl-59878 (examined, approved Japanese patent application published for opposition)).    Furthermore, desired human antibodies can be obtained by immunizing transgenic animals carrying a complete repertoire of human antibody genes, with desired antigens (see W093/12227, WO92/03918, WO94/02602, WO96/34096, and W096/33735).<br>
Animal immunization can be carried out by appropriately diluting and suspending a sensitizing antigen in Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS), physiological saline, or such, and forming an emulsion by mixing an adjuvant if necessary, followed by an intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection into animals.    After that, the sensitizing antigen mixed with Freund's incomplete adjuvant is preferably administered several times every four to 21 days.    Antibody production can be confirmed by measuring the target antibody titer in animal sera using conventional methods.<br>
Antibody-producing cells obtained from lymphocytes or animals immunized with a desired antigen can be fused with myeloma cells to generate hybridomas using conventional fusing agents (for example, polyethylene glycol) (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press, 1986, 59-103).    When required, hybridoma cells can be cultured and grown, and the binding specificity of the antibody produced from these hybridomas can be measured using known analysis methods, such as immunoprecipitation, radioimmunoassay<br><br>
 (RIA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).    Thereafter, hybridomas that produce antibodies of interest whose specificity, affinity, or activity has been determined can be subcloned by methods such as limiting dilution.<br>
Next, genes encoding the selected antibodies can be cloned from hybridomas or antibody-producing cells (sensitized lymphocytes, and such) using probes that may specifically bind to the antibodies (for example, oligonucleotides complementary to sequences encoding the antibody constant regions).    Cloning from mRNA using RT-PCR is also possible. Immunoglobulins are classified into five different classes, IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM.    These classes are further divided into several subclasses (isotypes) (for example, IgG-1, IgG-2, IgG-3, and IgG-4; IgA-1 and IgA-2; and such).    H chains and L chains used in the present invention to produce antibodies are not particularly limited and may derive from antibodies belonging to any of these classes or subclasses; however, IgG is particularly preferred.<br>
Herein, it is possible to modify H-chain-encoding genes and L-chain-encoding genes using genetic engineering techniques.    Genetically modified antibodies, such as chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies that have been artificially modified for the purpose of decreasing heterologous antigenicity and such against humans, can be appropriately produced if necessary for antibodies such as mouse antibodies, rat antibodies, rabbit antibodies, hamster antibodies, sheep antibodies, and camel antibodies.    Chimeric antibodies are antibodies composed of a nonhuman mammal antibody H chain and L chain variable regions, such as mouse antibody, and the H chain and L chain constant regions of human antibody.    They can be obtained by ligating the DNA encoding a variable region of a mouse antibody to the DNA encoding a constant region of a human antibody, incorporating them into an expression vector, and introducing the vector into a host for production of the antibody.    A humanized antibody, which is also called a reshaped human antibody, can be synthesized by PCR from a number of oligonucleotides produced so that they have overlapping portions at the ends of DNA sequences designed to link the complementary determining regions (CDRs) of an antibody of a nonhuman mammal such as a mouse.    The obtained DNA can be ligated to a DNA encoding a human antibody constant region.    The ligated DNA can be incorporated into an expression vector, and the vector can be introduced into a host to produce the antibody (see EP239400 and WO96/02576).    Human antibody FRs that are ligated via the CDR are selected when the CDR forms a favorable antigen-binding site.    If necessary, amino acids in the framework region of an antibody variable region may be substituted such that the CDR of the reshaped human antibody forms an appropriate antigen-binding site (K. Sato et al.. Cancer Res. 1993, 53: 851-856).<br>
In addition to the humanization techniques described above, antibodies may be modified to improve their biological properties, for example, antigenic affinity.    In the present invention, such modifications can be carried out using methods such as site-directed mutagenesis (see for<br><br>
example, Kunkel (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82: 488), PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis.    In general, mutant antibodies whose biological properties have been improved show amino acid sequence homology and/or similarity of 70% or higher, more preferably 80% or higher, and even more preferably 90% or higher (for example, 95% or higher, 97%, 98%&gt;, 99%, etc.), when compared to the amino acid sequence of the original antibody variable region. Herein, sequence homology and/or similarity is defined as the ratio of amino acid residues that are homologous (same residue) or similar (amino acid residues classified into the same group based on the general properties of amino acid side chains) to the original antibody residues, after the sequence homology value has been maximized by sequence alignment and gap introduction, if necessary.    Generally, naturally-occurring amino acid residues are classified into groups based on the characteristics of their side chains: (1) hydrophobic: alanine, isoleucine, valine, methionine, and leucine; (2) neutral hydrophilic: asparagine, glutamine, cysteine, threonine, and serine; (3) acidic: aspartic acid, and glutamic acid; (4) basic: arginine, histidine, and lysine; (5) residues that affect the orientation of the chain: glycine, and proline; and (6) aromatic: tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine.<br>
Ordinarily, a total of six complementary determining regions (CDRs; hypervariable regions) present in the H chain and L chain variable regions interact to form the antigen binding site(s) of an antibody.    Even one of these variable regions is known to have the ability to recognize and bind to the antigen, although the affinity will be lower than when all binding sites are included.    Therefore, antibody genes of the present invention encoding the H chain and L chain only have to encode fragment portions having each of the antigen binding sites of H chain and L chain, and polypeptides encoded by these genes only have to maintain affinity with the desired antigens.<br>
For example, as described above, desired bispecific antibodies that actually have activities can be obtained efficiently by the methods of the present invention.<br>
Heavy chain variable regions are generally composed of three CDR regions and four FR regions, as described above.    In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, amino acid residues subjected to "modification" can be appropriately selected, for example, from amino acid residues in the CDR regions or FR regions.    Generally, modification of amino acid residues in the CDR regions can decrease affinity towards antigens.    Therefore, in the present invention, amino acid residues subjected to "modification" are not particularly limited, but are preferably appropriately selected from amino acid residues in the FR regions.<br>
Furthermore, sequences that can be used as variable region FRs for antibodies in organisms such as human or mouse can be appropriately obtained by those skilled in the art using public databases.    More specifically, amino acid sequence information of the FR regions can be obtained by means described later in the Examples.<br><br>
All prior art references cited herein are incorporated by reference into this specification.<br>
Examples<br>
Herein below, the present invention will be specifically described with reference to the Examples, but it is not to be construed as being limited thereto.<br>
[Example 1] Humanization of bispecific antibodies carrying a hybrid L chain<br>
Abispecific antibody composed of a combination of the anti-Factor IXa antibody A69-VH, anti-Factor X antibody B26-VH, and hybrid L chain (BBA), which was the most effective in shortening the blood coagulation time in Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-112514, was humanized as follows.<br>
1-1. Homology search of human antibodies<br>
A database was constructed by obtaining amino acid sequence data of human antibodies from the publicly disclosed in Kabat Database (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/kabat/) and IMGT Database (http://imgt.cines.fr/), and homology search was performed on the database for the mouse A69 H chain variable region (amino acid sequence: SEQ ID NO: 19), mouse B26 H chain variable region (amino acid sequence: SEQ ID NO: 20), and mouse BBA L chain variable region (amino acid sequence: SEQ ID NO: 21).    The results confirmed that they have high homologies to the human antibody sequences below, and it was thus decided that they could be used as framework region (hereinafter referred to as FR) for humanized antibodies.<br>
(1)	A69 H chain variable region: KABATID-000064 (Kabat Database) (Kipps et al, J. Clin. Invest. 1991;87:2087-2096)<br>
(2)	B26 H chain variable region: EMBL Accession No. AB063872 (IMGT Database) (Unpublished data)<br>
(3)	BBA L chain variable region: KABATID-024300 (Kabat Database) (Welschof et al, J. Immunol. Method. 1995; 179:203-214)<br>
The complementary determining region (hereinafter referred to as CDR) of each of the mouse antibodies was grafted into the FR of human antibodies of (l)-(3), and humanized antibodies were thus prepared.<br>
Moreover, the homology search web site publicly disclosed by NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) was used to search for secretory signal sequences of human antibodies that are highly homologous to human antibodies of (4)-(6).    The following secretory signal sequences obtained by the search were used.<br>
(4)	A69 H chain variable region: GenBank Accession No. AF062257<br>
(5)	B26 H chain variable region: GenBank Accession No. ACC18248<br><br>
 (6) BBA L chain variable region: GenBank Accession No. AAA59100<br>
1-2. Construction of humanized antibody gene expression vectors<br>
For a nucleotide sequence encoding the amino acid sequence covering from the secretory signal sequence to the antibody variable region, twelve synthetic oligo-DNAs of about 50 bases were prepared, such that about 20 bases at the 3' end hybridize with each other.    The synthetic oligo-DNAs were designed such that they encode a human sequence at the 5' side and a mouse sequence at the 3' side, or such that all the nucleotides encode a human sequence. Furthermore, a primer that anneals to the 5'-end of an antibody variable region gene and has the Xhol cleavage sequence, and a primer that encodes the 5' -end sequence of the intron sequence, anneals to the 3'-end of an antibody variable region gene, and has the Sfil cleavage sequence were prepared.<br>
1 uL each of synthetic oligo-DNAs prepared at 2.5 uM were mixed, and lx TaKaRa Ex Taq Buffer, 0.4 mM dNTPs, and 0.5 unit of TaKaRa Ex Taq (all from Takara) were added to prepare a 48 uL reaction solution.    After heating at 94°C for five minutes, two cycles of reaction at 94°C for two minutes, 55°C for two minutes, and 72°C for two minutes were carried out to assemble and elongate each of the synthetic oligo-DNAs.    Next, 1 uL (10 uM each) each of the primers that anneal to the 5' end and 3' end of the antibody gene were added, and the antibody variable region gene was amplified by 35 cycles of reaction at 94°C for 30 seconds, 55°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for one minute, and then reaction at 72°C for five minutes.. After PCR was carried out, the whole amount of the reaction solution was subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.    Amplified fragments of the desired size (about 400 bp) were purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) according to the method described in the attached instruction manual, and eluted with 30 µL of sterilized water.    The fragments were cloned using the pGEM-T Easy Vector System (Promega) according to the method described in the attached instruction manual.    The nucleotide sequence of each DNA fragment was determined using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) and ABI PRISM 3730xL DNA Sequencer or ABI PRISM 3700 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems) according to the method described in the attached instruction manual.<br>
The H-chain variable region fragment-inserted plasmid was digested with Xhol and Sfil, and the L-chain variable region fragment-inserted plasmid was digested with EcoRI, after they were confirmed to have the correct humanized antibody variable region gene sequence.    Then, the reaction solutions were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.    DNA fragments having the desired size (about 400 bp) were purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) according to the method described in the attached instruction manual, and eluted with 30 (J.L of sterilized water.    Thereafter, vectors for expression in animal cells were prepared<br><br>
as follows.    To preferentially express IgG4 with H chains of a heterologous combination, an IgG4 that has amino acid substitution in its CH3 portion was used by referring to the knobs-into-holes technique for IgGl (Merchant AM et ai, Nature Biotechnology, 1998, Vol. 16, p. 677-681).    Furthermore, to promote H-chain dimer formation, amino acid substitution (-ppcpScp→ -ppcpPcp-) was also introduced into the hinge.    Humanized A69 H chain expression vector was prepared by inserting the humanized A69 H chain variable region antibody gene fragment into an expression vector prepared by inserting an Y349C and T366W-substituted constant region gene into pCAGGS comprising a chicken P-actin promoter (Niwa et al., Gene, 1991, 108: 193-199).    Humanized B26 H chain expression vector was prepared by inserting the humanized B26 H chain variable region antibody gene fragment into an expression vector prepared by inserting an E356C, T366S, L368A, and Y407V-substituted constant region gene to pCAGGS.    The plasmid (pCAG-gKDNA) was prepared by inserting a wild-type antibody L chain constant region into pCAGGS, and was digested with EcoRJ to prepare an expression vector into which the humanized BBA L chain variable region antibody gene fragment was inserted.    Ligation reaction was performed using the Rapid DNA Ligation Kit (Roche Diagnostics), and the E. coli strain DH5a (TOYOBO) was transformed.<br>
1-3. Expression of humanized bispecific antibodies<br>
Humanized bispecific antibodies were expressed using the following method.    Human fetal renal carcinoma cell-derived humanized bispecific antibodies were expressed using the method described in Example 1-2, or using the following method.    Human fetal renal carcinoma cell-derived HEK293H strain (Invitrogen) was suspended in a DMEM medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen), seeded at a cell density of 5-6 x 10 cells/mL (10 mL per dish) in dishes used for adhesive cells (10-cm diameter, CORNING), and cultured for one day and night in a CO2 incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).    Then, the medium was removed by suction, and 6.9 mL of CHO-S-SFM-II (Invitrogen) medium containing 1% Fetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen) was added.    The plasmid DNA mixture solution prepared in 1-2 (total of 13.8 µg) was mixed with 20.7 µL of 1 µg/mL Polyethylenimine (Polysciences Inc.) and 690 µL of CHO-S-SFMII medium, left to stand at room temperature for ten minutes, and then added to the cells in each dish.    The cells were then incubated in a CO2 incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) for four to five hours.    Then, 6.9 mL of CHO-S-SFM-II (Invitrogen) medium containing 1% Fetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen) was added and then the cells were incubated in a CO2 incubator for three days.    The culture supernatant was collected, then cells were removed by centrifugation (at approximately 2000 g for five minutes at room temperature), and the solution was sterilized by passing it through a 0.22 µm filter MILLEX®-GV (Millipore).    The sample was stored at 4°C until use.<br><br>
1-4. Purification of humanized bispecific antibodies<br>
100 µL of rProtein A Sepharose™ Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the culture supernatant obtained by the method described in Example 1-2, and the solution was mixed by rotation at 4°C for four hours.    The solution was transferred to an Ultrafree -MC 0.22-um filter cup (Millipore).    After three washes with 500 µL of TBS containing 0.01% Tween® 20, the rProtein A Sepharose™ resin was suspended in 100 µL of 50 mM aqueous sodium acetate solution containing 0.01%) Tween® 20 at pH 3.3, and left to stand for two minutes, and then, the antibody was eluted.    The eluate was immediately neutralized by adding 6.7 µL of 1.5 M Tris-HCl,pH7.8.<br>
1-5. Quantification of humanized bispecific antibody concentration<br>
Measurements were performed by two methods described below. Goat anti-human IgG (Biosource International) was adjusted to 1 µg/mL with a coating buffer, and immobilized to a Nunc-Immuno plate (Nunc).    After blocking with a diluent buffer (D.B.), a sample of the culture supernatant suitably diluted with D.B. was added.    Furthermore, eleven three-fold serial dilutions of human IgG4 (humanized anti-TF antibody, see WO 99/51743) starting from 2000 ng/mL were made with D.B., and added as a standard for antibody concentration calculation.    After three washes, goat anti-human IgG, alkaline phosphatase (Biosource International) was added for reaction.    After five washes, the color was developed using Sigma 104   phosphatase substrate (Sigma-Aldrich) as a substrate, and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured on an absorbance reader Model 3550 (Bio-Rad Laboratories) with a reference wavelength of 655 nm.    Using the Microplate Manager III (Bio-Rad Laboratories) software, human IgG concentration in the culture supernatant was calculated from the standard curve.<br>
Alternatively, measurements were performed with Biacore 1000 (BIACORE) using Protein A-immobilized Sensor Chip CM5 (BIACORE).    More specifically, according to the manufacturer's protocol, an activated sensor chip was reacted with Protein A (SIGMA) solution diluted to 50 µg/mL with 10 mM aqueous sodium acetate solution (pH 4.0, BIACORE) at 5 uL/minute for 30 minutes, and then a blocking procedure was carried out to produce a Protein A-immobilized sensor chip.    This sensor chip was used to measure the concentrations of the culture supernatant and the purified products on Biacore 1000 (BIACORE).    HBS-EP Buffer (BIACORE) was used for the immobilization of the sensor chip and for the concentration measurements.    Six two-fold serial dilutions of a humanized IgG4 antibody (humanized anti-TF antibody, see W099/51743) starting from 4000 ng/mL were made with HBS-EP Buffer, and used as a standard for the concentration measurements.<br><br>
 Blood coagulation activity assay for humanized bispecific antibodies<br>
To determine whether a bispecific antibody is capable of correcting the coagulation ability of hemophilia A blood, effects of the antibody on the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were determined using Factor VIII-deficient plasma.    50 µL of an antibody solution at a variety of concentrations, 50 µL of Factor VIII-deficient plasma (Biomerieux), and 50 µL of the APTT reagent (Dade Behring) were mixed and heated at 37°C for three minutes. Coagulation reaction was initiated by adding 50 µL of 20 mM CaCI2 (Dade Behring) to the mixture.    The time period until coagulation was measured with KC10A (Amelung) linked to CR-A (Amelung).<br>
Using a calibration curve produced by defining the coagulation time of Factor VIII-deficient plasma as 0% and the coagulation time of normal plasma as 100%, the Factor VIII-like activity (%) of a bispecific antibody was calculated from the coagulation time measured when the bispecific antibody was added.<br>
1-7. Acquisition of humanized bispecific antibodies having blood coagulation activity<br>
The human antibody FR of humanized bispecific antibodies that displayed decreased blood coagulation ability in the above-mentioned blood coagulation activity assay were subjected to amino acid modification in order to increase the activity.    More specifically, the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) was used to introduce mutations into the humanized antibody variable region according to the method described in the attached instruction manual.    The H-chain variable region fragment-inserted plasmid digested with Xhol and Sfil, and the L-chain variable region fragment-inserted plasmid was digested with EcoRI,, after they were confirmed to have the desired humanized antibody variable region gene sequence. Then, the reaction solutions were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.    DNA fragments having the desired size (about 400 bp) were purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) according to the method described in the attached instruction manual, and eluted with 30 µL of sterilized water.    Then, plasmids for expression in animal cells were prepared according to the method described in Example 1-2.    Humanized bispecific antibodies were prepared according to the method described in Examples 1-3, 1-4, and 1-5, and blood coagulation activity was evaluated according to the method described in Example 1-6.<br>
By repeating amino acid modifications of the FR sequence and assessment of blood coagulation ability, a humanized bispecific antibody (humanized A69 (hA69a)/humanized B26 (hB26-F123e4)/humanized BBA (hAL-F123j4)) having the same level of activity as the chimeric bispecific antibody (A69/B26/BBA) was obtained (Fig. 1).    The antibody variable region sequences are shown in the following SEQ ID NOs.<br><br>
(1)	humanized A69 antibody VH (hA69a): SEQ ID NO: 1 (nucleotide sequence), SEQ ID NO: 2 (amino acid sequence)<br>
(2)	humanized B26 antibody VH (hB26-F123e4): SEQ ID NO: 3 (nucleotide sequence), SEQ ID NO: 4 (amino acid sequence)<br>
(3)	humanized BBA antibody VL (hAL-F123j4): SEQ ID NO: 5 (nucleotide sequence), SEQ ID NO: 6 (amino acid sequence)<br>
[Example 2] Selection of sites in the variable region amino acid modification positions for separation of bispecific antibodies<br>
In preparation of a bispecific antibody, when two types of H chains and one type of L chain are used for expression, the following three types of antibodies are expressed: a homodimer of the humanized A69 H chain and humanized BBA L chain, a homodimer of the humanized B26 H chain and humanized BBA L chain, and a heterodimer of the humanized A69 H chain, humanized B26 H chain, and humanized BBA L chain.    The objective is to purify only the bispecific antibody by separating these three types of antibodies, and thus amino acid modifications were carried out to decrease the isoelectric point of the humanized A69 H chain variable region and increase the isoelectric point of the humanized B26 H chain variable region.<br>
First, antibody Fv region models were prepared for the humanized A69 antibody and humanized B26 antibody by homology modeling using the MOE software (Chemical Computing Group Inc.), and the amino acid resides exposed on the surface of the variable regions of the humanized A69 antibody and humanized B26 antibody were confirmed.    The models are shown in Fig. 2.    According to a detailed analysis of these models, of the surface-exposed amino acids in the FR sequence outside CDR, H10, HI2, H23, H39, H43, and HI 05 (based on Kabat numbering; Kabat EAet al. 1991. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. NIH) are thought to be candidates that can alter the isoelectric point without decreasing the activity.<br>
[Example 3] Amino acid modifications in the variable regions of humanized bispecific antibodies<br>
Amino acid modifications were carried out at the sites selected in Example 2 to prepare modified antibodies.    Specifically, the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) was used to introduce mutations into the produced humanized A69 antibody H-chain variable region (hA69a, nucleotide SEQ ID NO: 1) and humanized B26 antibody H-chain variable region (hB26-F123e4, nucleotide SEQ ID NO: 3) according the method described in the attached instruction manual.    The H-chain variable region fragment-inserted plasmid was confirmed to have the desired humanized antibody variable region gene sequence, and digested with Xhol and Sfil.    Then, the reaction solution was subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.    DNA<br><br>
fragments having the desired size (about 400 bp) were purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) according to the method described in the attached instruction manual, and eluted with 30 µL of sterilized water.    According to the method described in Example 1-2, H-chain expression vectors were prepared by inserting the prepared DNA fragments into an expression plasmid carrying a wild-type constant region and an expression plasmid in which the constant region amino acids have been replaced using the knobs-into-holes technique. Thereafter, humanized bispecific antibodies were prepared by the method described in Examples 1-3, 1-4, and 1-5.    Sequences of the modified humanized antibody variable regions are shown in the SEQ ID NOs in Table 1 shown below.<br>

[Example 4] Analysis of modified humanized antibodies by isoelectric focusing<br>
To evaluate the alteration of surface charge due to amino acid modifications in the variable region, modified antibodies were prepared and analyzed by isoelectric focusing.<br>
The humanized BBA L-chain (hAL-F123j4) expression vector was simultaneously expressed together with the H-chain expression vector of unmodified hA69a, or hA69-pl8, hA69-p8, hA69-pl7, or hA69-pl6 modified from the humanized A69 H chain.    Five types of antibodies composed of hA69a, hA69-pl8, hA69-p8, hA69-pl7, or hA69-pl6 homodimers wereprepared.    Similarly, the humanized BBA L-chain expression vector was simultaneously expressed together with the H-chain expression vector of unmodified hB26-F123e4, or hB26-pl 9 or hB26-pl 5 modified from the humanized B26 H chain.    Three types of antibodies composed of hB26-F123e4, hB26-pl9, or hB26-pl5 homodimers were prepared.    Isoelectric focusing was performed as follows.    PhastGel Dry IEF gel (Amersham Biosciences) was swollen for about 30 minutes in the swelling solution described below using the Phastsystem Cassette (Amersham Biosciences).<br>
20% Glycerol	0.95 mL<br>
MilliQ water	0.95 mL<br>
Bio-Lyte 7/9 (Bio-Rad)	10 µL<br>
Bio-Lyte 3/10 (Bio-Rad)	10 µL<br>
Pharmalyte 8-10.5 for IEF (Amersham Biosciences)	80 µL<br>
Electrophoresis was performed using the swollen gel by PhastSystem (Amersham Biosciences) according to the following program.    The samples were applied to the gel in Step 2.    A pi calibration kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used as the pi marker. Step 1:2000 V    2.5mA 3.5W    15°C      75 Vh Step 2: 200 V      2.5 mA 3.5 W    15°C      15 Vh Step 3: 2000 V    2.5 mA 3.5 W    15°C     410 Vh<br>
After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed with 20% TCA, and then silver stained using a silver staining kit, protein (Amersham Biosciences) according to the protocol attached to the kit. After staining, the isoelectric points of the samples were calculated from the known isoelectric points of the pi marker.<br>
The results of analysis of the unmodified and modified humanized A69 antibody homodimers and the humanized B26 antibody homodimer are shown in Fig. 3.    Band shifts were observed in the isoelectric focusing due to modification of the surface charge.    The isoelectric points of the respective antibodies estimated in reference to the pI marker were approximately 8.4 for modified hA69-pl8, approximately 8.2 for modified hA69-pl7, approximately 8.2 for modified hA69-p8, and approximately 8.1 for modified hA69-pl6, in contrast to approximately 8.8 for the unmodified hA69a homodimer.    That is, the modification was able to provide a maximum isoelectric point difference of approximately 0.7.    Similarly, regarding the humanized B26 homodimers, the isoelectric points were approximately 9.3 for modified hB26-pl9 and approximately 9.4 for modified hB26-pl5, in contrast to approximately 9.1 for unmodified hB26-Fl23e4.    That is, the modification was able to provide a maximum isoelectric point difference of approximately 0.3.    It was shown that the isoelectric point can be altered by modifying the charges on the surface amino acids in the variable region selected for this examination: HI2, H23, H39, H43, and HI05.[Example 5] Cation exchange chromatographic analysis of modified humanized antibodies<br>
Cation exchange chromagographic analysis was performed by the following method using the modified antibodies produced in Example 4 to evaluate the effect of the modification on the separation of the two antibodies.    The conditions for the cation exchange chromatographic analysis were as follows.    The retention time was calculated for the humanized A69 antibody homodimer and the humanized B26 antibody homodimer.<br>
Column: ProPac WCX-10, 4 x 250 mm, (Dionex)<br>
Mobile phase:     A: 10 mmol/L NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 6.25<br>
B: 10 mmol/L NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, 500 mmol/L NaCl, pH 6.25<br>
Flow rate: 1.0 mL/min<br>
Gradient: 10% B (5 min) → (40 min) → 60% B → (5 min) → 100% B (5 min)<br>
Detection: 220 nm<br>
The results of analysis of the five types of unmodified and modified humanized A69 antibody homodimers, and the three types of unmodified and modified humanized B26 antibody homodimers are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, respectively.    The retention time for both the unmodified humanized A69 antibody homodimer and the humanized B26 antibody homodimer was around 25 minutes, and thus separation of these homodimers was impossible, much less isolation of the desired bispecific antibody.    Peak shifts were observed when comparing the unmodified humanized A69 antibody with those that have been modified to have lower isoelectric points, and the retention time was decreased to approximately 22.4 minutes, approximately 21.2 minutes, and approximately 20.2 minutes, as the number of modifications increased.    Peak shifts were observed when comparing the unmodified humanized B26 antibody with those that have been modified to have higher isoelectric points for the variable region, and the retention time was increased to approximately 28.4 minutes and approximately 29.4 minutes, as the number of modifications increased.    Thus, it was shown that the retention time can be altered by modifying the charges on the surface amino acids in the variable region selected for this examination, H12, H23, H39, H43, and H105, and thereby modifying the surface charges of the two types of antibodies.<br>
According to the isoelectric point measurements in Example 4, despite a pi difference of 0.3 between the unmodified hA69a homodimer and the unmodified hB26-F123e4 homodimer, the retention time for both of the homodimers was around 25 minutes, and thus they could not be separated (Fig. 9).    However, the pi difference between the unmodified hA69a homodimer and hB26-pl9 was 0.5, and thus they were separated by a retention time difference of approximately 2.6 minutes.    Also, the pi difference between hA69-pl 8 and the hB26 homodimer was 0.7, and thus they were separated by a retention time difference of approximately 3.4 minutes.<br>
Moreover, a maximum pi difference of 1.3 was generated between hA69-pl6 and hB26-pl5, and thus they were separated by a retention time difference of approximately 9.2 min.    As described, the modifications made it possible to separate the two homodimers for the first time.<br>
[Example 6] Coagulation activity assessment of modified humanized bispecific antibodies<br>
Based on the observation of surface charge alteration made through the analyses in Examples 4 and 5, two types of modified humanized antibody H chains (hA69-p8 and hB26-pl5) and a humanized L chain (hAL-F123j4) were expressed to prepare humanized bispecific antibodies.    An expression vector, into which The IgG4 constant region based on the knobs-into-holes technique was inserted into an expression vector, and it was used as the H-chain expression vector to efficiently promote heterodimerization.    Coagulation activities were assessed according to the method described below using prepared humanized bispecific antibodies.<br>
To determine whether a bispecific antibody is capable of correcting the coagulation ability of hemophilia A blood, effects of the antibody on the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were determined using Factor VIII-deficient plasma.    50 µL of an antibody solution at a variety of concentrations, 50 µL of Factor VIII-deficient plasma (Biomerieux), and 50 µL of the APTT reagent (Dade Behring) were mixed and heated at 37°C for three minutes. Coagulation reaction was initiated by adding 50 µL of 20 mM CaCI2 (Dade Behring) to the mixture.    The time period until coagulation was measured with KC10A (Amelung) linked to CR-A (Amelung).<br>
Using a calibration curve produced by defining the coagulation time of Factor VIII-deficient plasma as 0% and the coagulation time of normal plasma as 100%, the Factor VIII-like activity (%) of a bispecific antibody was calculated from the coagulation time measured when the bispecific antibody was added.<br>
The results of the activity assessment are shown in Fig. 6.    Since the humanized bispecific antibody with a modified variable region showed a coagulation activity equivalent to that of the unmodified humanized bispecific antibody, it was shown that modification of the variable region in this Example does not affect antibody activities.<br>
[Example 7] Preparation and assessment of CDR-modified humanized antibodies<br>
As a result of the analysis of the humanized A69 antibody model produced in Example 2, H97 was confirmed to be a surface-exposed amino acid.    Of the antibodies shown in Table 1, the humanized A69 H chain hA69-N97R has a sequence in which asparagine at position 97 in CDR3 has been replaced with arginine.    Modified antibodies were prepared by producing an expression vector carrying hA69-N97R according to the method of Example 1-2, and expressing<br>
it together with the humanized BBA L chain hAL-F 123j4.    To evaluate the alteration of surface charge of this antibody, isoelectric focusing was performed according to the method of Example 4.    As indicated in Fig. 7, while the isoelectric point of the unmodified antibody (hA69a/hAL-F123j4) was 8.9, that of the modified antibody (hA69-N97R/hAL-F123j4) was 9.1, and thus alteration of the surface charge was also observed in the amino acid substitution of CDR.<br>
To evaluate the function of the modified antibodies, the activity of binding to the antigen, Factor IXa, was assayed by the following method.    Factor IXap (Enzyme Research Laboratories) diluted to 1 µg/mL with coating buffer (100 mM sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6, 0.02% sodium azide) was dispensed at 100 µL/well into a Nunc-Immuno plate (Nunc-Immuno™ 96 Micro Well     plates MaxiSorp     (Nalge Nunc International)), and then incubated overnight at 4°C.    After three washes with PBS(-) containing Tween® 20, the plate was blocked with diluent buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween   20, 0.02% sodium azide) at room temperature for two hours.    After removal of the buffer, a purified antibody diluted in the diluent buffer was added to the plate at 100 µL/well and incubated at room temperature for one hour.    The plate was washed three times, then alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (BIOSOURCE) diluted at 1/4000 with the diluent buffer was added at 100 µL/well.    This was then incubated at room temperature for one hour. The plate was washed five times, then a chromogenic substrate (Sigma) was added at 100 µL/well.    This was then incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes.    The absorbance at 405 nm (control: 655 ran) was measured using the Model 3550 Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories).    As a result, as shown in Fig. 8, the antibody in which the CDR had been modified to alter the surface charge showed a binding activity equivalent to that of the antibody before modification.    Thus, it was shown that when the surface charge is modified, the sites of modification may not only be in the FR indicated in Example 5, but also in the CDR.<br>
[Example 8] Preparation and assessment of humanized bispecific PF antibodies<br>
An unmodified humanized bispecific antibody was prepared using the unmodified antibodies (humanized A69 H chain hA69a and humanized B26 H chain hB26-F123e4) shown in Table 1, as well as the humanized BBA L chain hAL-F123j4 (SEQ ID NO: 5).    A humanized bispecific PF antibody was prepared using the modified antibodies (the modified form of the humanized A69 H chain hA69-PFL and the modified form of the humanized B26 H chain hB26-PF) shown in Table 1, as well as the humanized BBA L chain hAL-s8 (SEQ ID NO: 17). According to the method described in Example 1-2, H-chain expression vectors were prepared using an expression vector carrying the wild-type constant region, and the antibodies were prepared by the method described in Examples 1-3, 1-4, and 1-5.    Using a mixture solution<br>
containing the two types of homodimers and the bispecific antibody, cation exchange chromatographic analysis was carried out according to the method described in Example 5.<br>
The results of analysis of the unmodified humanized bispecific antibody and humanized bispecific PF antibody are shown in Figs. 9 and 10.    Regarding the unmodified humanized bispecific antibody, the results showed that the two types of homodimers and the bispecific antibody failed to separate, and were eluted as a single peak.    In contrast, regarding the humanized bispecific PF antibody, each of the two types of homodimers and the desired bispecific antibody were separated, and were eluted as three peaks in the following order: hA69-PF homodimer, humanized bispecific PF antibody, and hB26-PF homodimer.    By fractionating the three types of peaks in cation exchange chromatographic analysis, the two types of homodimers and the humanized bispecific PF antibody were purified.    These fractions were concentrated using Amicon Ultra, MWCO 10000 (Millipore), then dialyzed overnight against 20 mM sodium acetate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 6.0 while cooling.    Then, the concentrations were measured.<br>
After purifying each antibody, isoelectric focusing was performed according to the method described in Example 4.    As shown in Fig. 11, the three bands of antibodies were present before the cation exchange chromatographic analysis, and thus it was confirmed that each of the antibodies can be purified by cation exchange chromatography.    The following was also confirmed.    The isoelectric points of the humanized A69-PF antibody homodimer, humanized bispecific PF antibody, humanized B26-PF antibody homodimer were approximately 7.9, approximately 8.6, and approximately 9.2, respectively.    The isoelectric point difference between the humanized A69-PF antibody homodimer and the humanized bispecific PF antibody was approximately 0.7, while the isoelectric point difference between the humanized B26-PF antibody homodimer and the humanized bispecific PF antibody was approximately 0.6.<br>
Next, the coagulation activity of the bispecific PF antibody purified according to the method described in Example 6 was evaluated.    The coagulation activity was compared with those of the following three types of antibodies expressed using an IgG4 constant region with the knobs-into-holes technique: the aforementioned chimeric bispecific antibody; the bispecific antibody composed of hA69a (SEQ ID NO: 2), hB26-F123e4 (SEQ ID NO: 4), and hAL-F123j4 (SEQ ID NO: 6) whose variable regions were not modified; and the bispecific antibody having the same variable regions as those of the purified bispecific PF antibody.    The results of the evaluation are shown in Fig. 12.    The coagulation activity of the bispecific PF antibody carrying an IgG4 constant region prepared based on the knobs-into-holes technique was equivalent to that of the bispecific PF antibody carrying a wild-type constant region purified by cation exchange chromatography.    Thus, it was shown that in the present example, modifications at HI0, HI2, H23, H39, H43, and HI 05 in the variable region enable purification of bispecific antibodies to a<br>
high purity without affecting their activities.<br>
[Example 8] Establishment of cell lines expressing humanized bispecific antibodies<br>
To prepare modified humanized bispecific antibodies, antibody-expressing cell lines were established as follows.<br>
The H-chain constant region was amplified by PCR using the wild-type H-chain constant region gene of human IgG4 as a template, as well as a 5'-end primer designed such that the nucleotide sequence encoding the two amino acids (Ala-Ser) at the N terminus of the H-chain constant region will be the Nhel recognition sequence (GCTAGC), and a primer designed to anneal to the 3'-end and carry the NotI recognizing site, and was linked to a vector prepared by digesting the pBluescriptKS+ vector (TOYOBO) with Nhel and NotI (both from Takara), to produce pBCH4 comprising the IgG4 constant region gene.    PCR was performed using a primer that is complementary to the 5'-end nucleotide sequence of the H-chain variable region of the humanized A69 H chain antibody (hA69-KQ) and humanized B26 H chain antibody (hB26-PF) shown in Table 1, and which has a Kozak sequence (CCACC) and the EcoRI recognition sequence, and a primer to the 3'-end nucleotide sequence and has the Nhel recognition sequence. The obtained PCR products were digested with EcoRI and Nhel (both from Takara), and were inserted into pBCH4 similarly digested with EcoRI and Nhel, to link the variable region and the constant region.    The prepared humanized A69 H chain antibody vector was digested with EcoRI and Nhel (both from Takara), and was cloned into the pCXND3 expression vector for animal cells similarly digested with EcoRI and NotI.<br>
The course of construction of the present vector pCXND3 will be described below.    To separate the antibody H chain gene and the vector in DHFR-AE-rVH-PMl-f (see W092/19759), it was digested at the EcoRI and Smal restriction sites to recover only the vector part. Subsequently, the EcoRI-Notl-BamHI adaptor (Takara) was cloned into this vector.    The resulting vector was named pCHOI.    The region of pCHOI for expressing the DHFR gene was cloned into the Hindlll restriction site of pCXN (Niwa etal, Gene 1991; 10 8: 193 -200).    The resulting vector was named pCXND3.    Furthermore, the prepared humanized B26 H chain antibody vector was digested with EcoRI and NotI (both from Takara), and was cloned in the pCXZDl expression vector for animal cells similarly digested with EcoRI and NotI.    The pCXZDl vector is an expression vector in which the neomycin resistance gene of the pCXND3 vector has been replaced with a Zeocin resistance gene.    Furthermore, PCR was performed using a synthetic oligonucleotide that is complementary to the 5'-end nucleotide sequence of the L chain variable region of the humanized BBA L chain antibody (hAL-AQ, SEQ ID NO: 18) and which has a Kozak sequence, and a synthetic oligonucleotide that is complementary to the 3'-end nucleotide sequence and has the BsiWI site.    The obtained PCR product was cloned in the<br>
pBCL vector, in which the human kappa chain constant region was inserted into the pBluescript KS+ vector.    The human L chain variable region and constant region were linked together via the BsiWI site.    The produced L chain gene fragment was cloned into the expression vector pUCAG.    The pUCAG vector was prepared by digesting pCXN (Niwa et al., Gene 1991; 108: 193-200) with the restriction enzyme BamHI to obtain a 2.6-kbp fragment, and cloning the fragment into the BamHI restriction site of the pUC19 vector (TOYOBO).    The vector produced by cloning the L chain into pUCAG was digested with the restriction enzyme BamHI, and this was cloned into the expression vector pHygDHFR-4b containing a hygromycin resistance gene.    The three types of expression vectors thus produced were linearized with restriction enzymes, and then they were transfected into CHO-DG44 cells to establish antibody-expressing cell lines.<br>
Preparation of stable expression cell lines was carried out as follows.    Genes were introduced by the electroporation method using Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad).    Each antibody expression vector and 0.75 mL of CHO cells (1x10 cells/ml) suspended in PBS were mixed together, and cooled on ice for ten minutes.    Then, the mixture was transferred into a cuvette, and then a pulse was applied at 1.5 kV and a capacitance of 25 uFD.    After a recovery time of ten minutes at room temperature, the cells subjected to the electroporation treatment were suspended in 40 mL of CHO-S-SFMII medium (Invitrogen) containing 1 x HT supplement (Invitrogen).    A ten-fold diluted solution was prepared using the same culture medium, and added at 100 µL/well to a 96-well culture plate.    After culturing in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2) for one day and night, Geneticin (Invitrogen), Zeocin (Invitrogen), and Hygromycin B (Invitrogen) were added at 0.5 mg/mL, 0.6 mg/mL, and 0.4 mg/mL, respectively, and culture was continued for two weeks.    Colonies of transfected cells showing drug resistance were sequentially cultured and expanded.    Large scale culturing was carried out using the established high expression cell lines, and the culture supernatant was obtained.<br>
[Example 9] Separation and purification of humanized bispecific antibodies using a standard preparative column<br>
Bispecific antibodies were purified from the culture supernatant obtained in Example 8 by the following method.    The culture supernatant was applied to a rProtein A Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences, 50 mm I.D. x 9.9 cm H. = 194.3 mL with resin) equilibrated using an equilibration buffer (20 mmol/L sodium phosphate buffer, 1 mol/L NaCl). After washing with washing buffer 1 (20 mmol/L sodium phosphate buffer, 1 mol/L NaCl, pH 7.0), and then with washing buffer 2 (50 mmol/L sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0), elution was carried out using 100 mmol/L acetic acid.    Immediately after elution, the eluate was diluted three-fold with 20 mmol/L sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0.<br>
The obtained purified solution was applied to a standard preparative column, SP TOYOPEARL 650M column (TOSO, 26 mm I.D. x 22.3 cm H. = 118.3 mL with resin) equilibrated with Solvent A (20 mmol/L sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0).    Separation was performed based on the difference in surface charge between antibodies, using the following solutions and gradient conditions.<br>
Solvent A: 20 mmol/L sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0<br>
Solvent B: 20 mmol/L sodium acetate buffer, 1 mol/L NaCl, pH 6.0<br>
Flow Rate: 10 mL/min (113 cm/h), or 5.3 mL/min (60 cm/h) only at the time of elution<br>
Gradient:	0 → 15% B	Step wise	3 Column Volume (CV) flushed<br>
15 → 22% B       gradient	2.5 CV<br>
22 → 30% B       gradient	6 CV<br>
30 → 100% B     Step wise	3 CV flushed<br>
As a result of the elution, three peaks were detected as shown in Fig. 13. Thus, it was shown that bispecific antibodies can be also separated and purified using a standard preparative column.<br>
[Example 10] Activity assessment of modified humanized bispecific antibodies<br>
The coagulation activity of the humanized bispecific antibody prepared in Example 9 was evaluated according to the method described in Example 6.    The results of the evaluation are shown in Fig. 14.    The humanized bispecific antibody purified in Example 9 had a coagulation activity equivalent to that of the humanized bispecific PF antibody prepared in Example 8.    Thus, it was shown that even if amino acid sequences of the variable regions are slightly different in hA69-PFL and hA69-KQ, or even if the antibodies are purified using a standard preparative column, the antibody activities were not affected.<br>
In view of the above, it was shown that the humanized bispecific antibody of interest and the two types of homodimeric antibodies can be separated and purified without modifying the structure or function (activity) of the antibody, by altering the surface charge through modification of the H-chain variable region when preparing the bispecific antibody.    Since it was shown that bispecific antibodies can be separated and purified on a standard preparative column using the present method, this will be useful as a method for producing pharmaceuticals comprising a bispecific antibody.<br>
[Example 11] Production of subclass hybrid antibodies<br>
11-1. Cloning of the human IgG2 antibody H-chain constant region gene<br>
The following procedures were carried out to clone the human IgG2 antibody H-chain constant region gene.<br>
For amplification of the cDNA fragment, 50 µL of reaction solution (1 µL each of 20 uM K62 primer (5' cac cgt etc etc age etc cac caa 3', SEQ ID NO: 22) and K63 primer (5' gtg gca etc att tac ccg gag aca 3', SEQ ID NO: 23), 5 µL of MTC Multiple Tissue cDNA Panels (peripheral leukocytes) (Clontech), 4 µL of 5 x Prime STAR Buffer, 4 µL of 2.5 mM dNTPs, and 1 µL of PrimeSTAR HS DNA Polymerase (the above from Takara)) was prepared, and this was subjected to PCR.    PCR was performed using a thermal cycler GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Perkin Elmer), by heating at 98°C for two minutes, followed by 30 cycles of reacting at 98°C for ten seconds, 60°C for five seconds, and 72°C for two minutes per cycle, and finally heating at 72°C for ten minutes.    After PCR, the reaction solution was subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.    Amplified fragments having the size of interest (approximately 1000 bp) were purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) according to the method described in the attached instruction manual, and eluted with 50 µL of sterile water.    Then, r-Taq treatment was performed to add A (Adenosine) to the ends of the amplified fragments.    For the r-Taq treatment, the obtained amplified fragments were incubated in 10 µL of rTaq reaction solution (1 µL of 10 x rTaq reaction solution, 1 µL of 2.5 mM dNTPs, 1 µL of rTaq, and 7 µL of the above-mentioned amplified fragments) at 72°C for 30 minutes.    The r-Taq-treated fragments were cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and the nucleotide sequences were determined.    The nucleotide sequence of each DNA fragment was determined by a DNA sequencer ABI PRISM 3730xL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) using the BigDye Terminator 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the method described in the attached instruction manual.<br>
The determined nucleotide sequences were compared to the sequence of Accession No. BX640623.    If nucleotides in a determined sequence encode an amino acid sequence different from the corresponding sequence of BX640623, such nucleotides were considered to be mutations inserted during PCR amplification.    In such cases, amino acid substitutions were performed using the Quick Change Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) so that the amino acid sequence will be the same as that of BX640623.    The Quick Change Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) was used according to the method described in the attached instruction manual.    Furthermore, to link the human IgG2 H chain constant region gene to a desired variable region gene, a mutation was introduced such that the first two amino acids (Ala-Ser) of the human IgG2 H chain constant region were encoded by the restriction enzyme Nhel recognition sequence (GCTAGC).    The nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequence of the human IgG2 H-chain constant region used in this examination are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 24 and 25, respectively.<br>
11-2. Construction of expression vectors of subclass-substituted antibodies<br>
Antibody expression vectors, in which the H-chain variable region of the humanized PM-1 antibody is linked to one of the H chain constant regions of human IgGl, human IgG2, and human IgG4, were prepared as follows.<br>
PCR was performed using a synthetic oligonucleotide that has a Kozak sequence and is complementary to the 5'-end nucleotide sequence of the H-chain variable region of the humanized anti-human interleukin 6 receptor antibody (humanized PM-1 antibody) described in aNon-Patent Document (Sato K. et al., Cancer Research 1993, 53:851-856), and a synthetic oligonucleotide that has the Nhel recognition sequence and is complementary to the 3'-end nucleotide sequence.    The obtained PCR product was cloned into the pB-CH vector, in which the human IgGl H chain constant region (see Sato, K. et al, Cancer Research 1993, 53:851-856) was inserted into the pBluescript KS+ vector (TOYOBO).    The H chain gene fragment, in which the H-chain variable region and constant region were linked, was inserted into the pCAGGS vector whose expression is regulated by the chicken P-actin promoter (Niwa et al. 1991 Gene, 108: 193-199).    The PCR-amplified H-chain variable region gene of the humanized PM-1 antibody was linked to the human IgG4 constant region gene (see WO 99/51743) or the human IgG2 H chain gene prepared in Example 11-1 via the 5'-end Nhel site, and then inserted into the pCAGGS vector.    Each H-chain expression vector expresses the H chain by linking the H-chain variable region of the humanized PM-1 antibody to the humanized H chain constant region via the Nhel sequence.<br>
Similarly, PCR was performed using a synthetic oligonucleotide that has a Kozak sequence and is complementary to the 5'-end nucleotide sequence of the L-chain variable region of the humanized PM-1 antibody, and a synthetic oligonucleotide that has the restriction enzyme BsiWI recognition sequence and is complementary to the 3'-end nucleotide sequence.    The obtained PCR product was cloned into the pB-CL vector, in which the human kappa chain constant region was inserted into the pBluescript KS+ vector (TOYOBO).    The L chain gene fragment, in which the L-chain variable region and constant region were linked, was inserted into the pCAGGS vector whose expression is regulated by the chicken p-actin promoter.    The L chain is expressed by linking the L-chain variable region of the humanized PM-1 antibody to the human kappa chain constant region via the BsiWI sequence.<br>
11-3. Expression of subclass hybrid antibodies<br>
Subclass hybrid antibodies can be produced by combining any two of the humanized PM-1 antibody H chain expression vectors carrying the constant region of human IgGl, human IgG2, or human IgG4, and coexpressing them with the humanized PM-1 antibody L-chain expression vector in cells for expression.    Each antibody was expressed by the method described in Example 4-2 or the following method.    Human fetal renal carcinoma cell-derived<br><br>
HEK293H strain (Invitrogen) was suspended in a DMEM medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen), and this was seeded at a cell density of 5-6 x 105 cells/mL (10 mL per dish) in dishes used for adhesive cells (10-cm diameter, CORNING) and cultured for one day and night in a CO2 incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).    Then, the medium was removed by suction, and 6.9 mL of CHO-S-SFM-II (Invitrogen) medium was added.    As described below, the mixture solutions for expressing the different subclass antibodies and the mixture solutions for expressing the hybrid antibodies (a total of 13.8 fig) were prepared using the plasmid DNAs prepared in 11-2.<br>

(6)	L-chain expression vector 6.9 |ag, IgGl H-chain expression vector 3.45 ug, IgG4 H-chain expression vector 3.45 ug<br>
Each mixture solution was mixed with 20.7 µL of 1 µg/mL Polyethylenimine (Polysciences Inc.) and 690 µL of CHO-S-SFMII medium, left to stand at room temperature for ten minutes, then added to the cells in each dish, and then the cells were then incubated in a CO2 incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) for four to five hours.    Thereafter, 6.9 mL of CHO-S-SFM-II (Invitrogen) medium was added and then the cells were incubated in a CO2 incubator for three days.    The culture supernatant was collected, then cells were removed by centrifugation (at approximately 2000 g for five minutes at room temperature), and the solution was sterilized by passing it through a 0.22 um filter MILLEX®-GV (Millipore).    The sample was stored at 4°C until use.<br>
11-4. Purification of subclass hybrid antibodies<br>
100 µL of rProtein A Sepharose     Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the culture supernatant obtained by the method described in Example 11-3, and the solution was mixed by rotation at 4°C for four hours.    The solution was transferred to an Ultrafree -MC 0.22-um filter cup (Millipore).    After three washes with 500 µL of TBS, the rProtein A Sepharose     resin was suspended in 100 µL of 50 mM aqueous sodium acetate solution at pH 3.0, and left to stand for two minutes, and then, the antibody was eluted.    The eluate was immediately neutralized by adding 6.7 µL of 1.5 M Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0.    The buffer of the obtained antibody solution was exchanged by dialyzing it against PBS for activity<br><br>
measurement, or against 20 rnM acetic acid buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, pH 6.0 for DSC measurement.    Hereinbelow, the purified antibody carrying the H-chain constant region of human IgGl will be referred to as "unmodified humanized anti-PM-1 antibody", the antibody carrying the H-chain constant region of human IgG2 will be referred to as "IgG2-substituted humanized anti-PM-1 antibody", and the antibody carrying the H-chain constant region of human IgG4 will be referred to as "IgG4-substituted humanized anti-PM-1 antibody".<br>
11-5. Quantification of subclass hybrid antibody concentration<br>
The absorbance of the antibody-containing solution obtained in 11-4 at 280 nm was measured on ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop) using 2 µL of the solution, or on the DU600 spectrophotometer (BECKMAN) using 50 µL of the solution.    The antibody concentration was calculated from the obtained values using the following equation.    PBS, or 20 mM acetic acid buffer containing 150 mM NaCl at pH6.0 was used as the blank.<br>
Antibody concentration (mg/mL) = absorbance x dilution factor /14.6 x 10<br>
[Example 12] Analyses of subclass hybrid antibodies<br>
12-1. Analysis of subclass hybrid antibodies by isoelectric focusing<br>
Isoelectric focusing analysis was carried out to evaluate the alteration of surface charge as a result of substitution in the constant region.<br>
Isoelectric focusing was performed as follows.    PhastGel Dry IEF (Amersham Biosciences) gel was swollen for about 30 minutes in the swelling solution described below using the Phastsystem Cassette (Amersham Biosciences).<br>
20% Glycerol	1.5 mL<br>
Pharmalyte 8-10.5 for IEF (Amersham Biosciences)	100 mL<br>
Electrophoresis was performed using the swollen gel by PhastSystem (Amersham Biosciences) according to the following program.    The samples were applied to the gel in Step 2.    A pi calibration kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used as the pi marker.<br>
Step 1:2000 V    2.5 mA 3.5 W    15°C      75 Vh<br>
Step 2: 200 V      2.5 mA 3.5 W    15°C      15 Vh<br>
Step3:2000V    2.5 mA 3.5 W    15°C      410Vh<br>
After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed with 20% TCA, and then silver stained using a silver staining kit, protein (Amersham Biosciences) according to the protocol attached to the kit. After staining, the isoelectric points of the samples were calculated from the known isoelectric points of the pi marker.<br>
The results of analysis of the unmodified, IgG2-substituted and IgG4-substituted humanized PM-1 antibodies are shown in Fig. 15.    Band shifts were observed in isoelectric<br><br>
focusing due to subclass substitution.    The isoelectric points of the respective antibodies estimated in reference to the pi marker were approximately 8.9 for the IgG2-substituted humanized PM-1 antibody, and approximately 8.7 for the IgG4-substituted humanized PM-1 antibody, in contrast to approximately 9.3 for the unmodified humanized PM-1 antibody.    That is, the substitution was able to provide a maximum isoelectric point difference of approximately 0.6.    It was shown in this examination that the isoelectric points can be altered by substituting the constant region of an antibody subclass.<br>
Next, the results of analysis of coexpressed unmodified and IgG2-substituted humanized PM-1 antibodies, and coexpressed unmodified and IgG4-substituted humanized PM-1 antibodies are shown in Fig. 16.    Herein, three major bands corresponding to the homodimers of the respective subclasses and the heterodimer were observed in each combination.    The isoelectric points of the respective subclass hybrid antibodies estimated in reference to the pi marker were 9.2 for the unmodified humanized PM-l/IgG2-substituted human PM-1 hybrid antibody and 9.0 for the unmodified humanized PM-l/IgG4-substituted human PM-1 hybrid antibody.    It was shown in this study that subclass hybrid antibodies can be produced by coexpressing a combination of expression vectors of subclass antibodies, and that the hybrid antibodies can be separated by their difference in isoelectric points.<br>
12-2. Cation exchange chromatographic analysis of subclass hybrid antibodies<br>
Cation exchange chromatographic analysis was performed by the following method using the subclass hybrid antibodies prepared in Example 11, and the effect of the subclass substitution on separation was evaluated.    The conditions for cation exchange chromatographic analysis were as follows.    The retention time was calculated for the unmodified humanized PM-1 antibody, the IgG2-substituted humanized PM-1 antibody, the IgG4-substituted humanized PM-1 antibody, the hybrid antibody of the unmodified humanized PM-1 antibody and IgG2-substituted humanized PM-1 antibody, and the hybrid antibody of the unmodified humanized PM-1 antibody and IgG4-substituted humanized PM-1 antibody.<br>
Column: ProPac WCX-10, 4 x 250 mm, (Dionex)<br>
Mobile phase:     A: 25 mmol/L MES/NaOH, pH 6.1<br>
B: 25 mmol/L MES/NaOH, 250 mmol/L NaCl, pH 6.1<br>
Flow rate: 0.5 mL/min<br>
Gradient: 25% B (5 min) → (105 min)→ 67% B → (1 min) → 100% B (5 min)<br>
Detection: 280 nm<br>
The results of analysis of singly expressed unmodified, IgG2-substituted, and IgG4-substituted humanized PM-1 antibodies are shown in Fig. 17.    The retention time of the unmodified humanized PM-1 antibody, IgG2-substituted humanized PM-1 antibody, and<br><br>
IgG4-substituted humanized PM-1 antibody was 60.2 minutes, 30.5 minutes, and 30.3 minutes, respectively.    That is, the retention time was altered by slightly less than 30 minutes due to subclass substitution.    On the other hand, the retention time was nearly the same for the IgG2-substituted humanized PM-1 antibody and the IgG4-substituted humanized PM-1 antibody, which showed a pi difference according to isoelectric focusing.    Next, the results of analysis of coexpressing unmodified and IgG2-substituted humanized PM-1 antibodies, and coexpressing unmodified and IgG4-substituted humanized PM-1 antibodies are shown in Fig. 18.    The homodimers of each subclass and heterodimer were observed as three main peaks in the combination of the unmodified humanized PM-1 antibody and IgG2-substituted humanized PM-1 antibody, and the combination of the unmodified humanized PM-1 antibody and IgG4-substituted humanized PM-1 antibody.    The retention time was approximately 43.8 minutes for the unmodified humanized PM-l/IgG2-substituted humanized PM-1 hybrid antibody, and approximately 45.1 minutes for the unmodified humanized PM-l/IgG4-substituted humanized PM-1 hybrid antibody.    That is, these antibodies were separated from the respective homodimers with a retention time difference of 10 minutes or more.    It was shown in this examination that subclass hybrid antibodies can be produced by coexpressing a combination of expression vectors of subclass antibodies, and that the hybrid antibodies can be separated by ion exchange chromatography.<br>
[Example 13] Separation and purification of subclass hybrid antibodies by cation exchange chromatography<br>
The antibody solutions obtained in Example 11 were concentrated using Amicon-Ultra4 (Amicon), then enveloped in EasySep (TOMY SEIKO).    After buffer exchange was performed by dialysis against 5 mM citric acid buffer (pH 6.5), subclass hybrid antibodies were purified under the following conditions.<br>
Column: Poly CAT A, 4.6 x 100 mm, particle diameter: 3 µm, pore diameter: 150 nm (Poly LC)<br>
Mobile Phase:     A: 25 mmol/L MES/NaOH, pH 6.1<br>
B: 25 mmol/L MES/NaOH, 250 mmol/L sodium acetate, pH 6.1<br>
Flow rate: 1.0 mL/min<br>
Gradient: 35% B (5 min) → (54 min)→ 65% B → (1 min) → 100% B (5 min)<br>
Detection: 280 nm<br>
Approximately 100 to 200 ug was loaded each time, and peaks of the unmodified humanized PM-1 antibody, unmodified humanized PM-l/IgG4-substituted humanized PM-1 subclass hybrid antibody, and IgG4-substituted humanized PM-1 antibody were fractionated.    A chromatogram of the fractionations is shown in Fig. 19.    Peak fractions from multiple<br><br>
experiments were combined, concentrated using Amicon-Ultra4 (Amicon), and then enveloped in EasySep (TOMY SEIKO).    The buffer was exchanged by dialysis against PBS for activity measurement, or against 20 mM acetic acid buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, pH 6.0 for DSC measurement.    The fractionated peaks were reanalyzed under conditions similar to those described above and the results are shown in Fig. 20.    This shows that subclass hybrid antibodies can be fractionated and purified by ion exchange chromatography methods.<br>
This technique enables separation of antibodies carrying a common H-chain variable region by using constant regions of different subclasses with different pi values.    Thus, even if different H-chain variable regions do not have a pi difference, bispecific antibodies can be separated by ion exchange chromatography by linking the H-chain variable regions to subclass H-chain constant regions with different pi values.    Furthermore, if the H-chain variable regions are different, the pi difference between the. molecules can be increased to further facilitate separation and purification by combining the above technique with the technique for introducing mutations into the variable region as shown in Example 9.    Even if introduction of mutations into the H-chain variable region is difficult, bispecific antibodies can be separated and purified by ion exchange chromatography by substituting the H-chain variable region with a naturally-occurring IgG subclass sequence, without worrying about antigenicity.<br>
[Example 14] Isoelectric focusing of fractionated and purified subclass hybrid antibody products To evaluate the purity of the fractionated products, isoelectric focusing analysis was<br>
carried out.<br>
Isoelectric focusing was carried out as follows.    PhastGel Dry IEF (Amersham<br>
Biosciences) gel was swollen for about 30 minutes in the swelling solution described below<br>
using the Phastsystem Cassette (Amersham Biosciences).<br>
MilliQ water	1.5 mL<br>
Pharmalyte 5-8 for IEF (Amersham Biosciences)	50 µL<br>
Pharmalyte 8-10.5 for IEF (Amersham Biosciences)	50 µL<br>
Electrophoresis was performed using the swollen gel by PhastSystem (Amersham<br>
Biosciences) according to the following program.    The samples were applied to the gel in Step<br>
2.    A pI calibration kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used as the pi marker. Step 1:2000 V    2.5 mA 3.5 W    15°C      75 Vh Step 2: 200 V      2.5 mA 3.5 W    15°C      15 Vh Step 3: 2000 V    2.5 mA 3.5 W    15°C      410 Vh After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed with 20% TCA, and then silver stained using a<br>
silver staining kit, protein (Amersham Biosciences) according to the protocol attached to the kit. The results of analysis of the fractionated and purified subclass hybrid antibody<br><br>
products are shown in Fig. 21.    It was shown that the products can be purified without containing any subclass homodimer by using ion exchange chromatography.<br>
[Example 15] Activity assessment of fractionated and purified subclass hybrid antibody products 15-1. Establishment of human gpl30-expressing BaF3 cell line and human gpl30/human IL-6 receptor-coexpressing BaF3 cell line<br>
To obtain a cell line showing IL-6-dependent growth, a BaF3 cell line expressing human gpl30 was established as described below.<br>
The full-length human gpl30 cDNA (Hibi et al, Cell 1990; 63:1149-1157 (GenBank Accession No. NM_002184)) was amplified by PCR, and cloned into the pCOS2Zeo expression vector, from which the DHFR gene expression site of pCHOI (Hirata et al, FEBS Letter 1994; 356:244-248) was removed, and to which a Zeocin resistance gene expression site was inserted, to construct pCOS2Zeo/gpl30.<br>
10 pg of pCOS2Zeo/gpl30 was mixed with BaF3 cells (0.8 x 107 cells) suspended in PBS, then a pulse was applied at 0.33 kV and a capacity of 950 uFD using Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad).    BaF3 cells subjected to the gene transfer by electroporation treatment were cultured for one day and night in RPMI1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.2 ng/mL of mouse interleukin-3 (Peprotech), 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (hereinafter referred to as FBS, HyClone). Then, the cells were selected by adding RPMI1640 medium containing 100 ng/mL of human interleukin-6 (R&amp;D), 100 ng/mL of soluble human interleukin-6 receptor (R&amp;D systems), and 10% FBS, to establish a human gpl30-expressing BaF3 cell line (hereinafter referred to as BaF3/gpl30).<br>
15-2. Assessment of the activity of fractionated and purified subclass hybrid antibody products to neutralize human IL-6<br>
IL-6 neutralizing activity was evaluated using BaF3/gpl30 showing IL-6-dependent growth, as described below.    Purified unmodified humanized PM-1 antibody, unmodified/IgG4-substituted humanized PM-1 subclass hybrid antibody, and IgG4-substituted humanized PM-1 antibody were diluted in RPMI1640 containing 10% FBS to 10 pg/mL. Seven three-fold serial dilutions were prepared in this solution, and 50 µL of each solution was dispensed into each well of a 96-well plate (CORNING).    Next, after washing three times with RPMI1640 medium containing 10% FBS (HyClone), BaF3/gpl30 was suspended at 5 x 104 cells/mL in RPMI1640 medium containing 60 ng/mL of human interleukin-6 (TORAY), 60 ng/mL of soluble human IL-6 receptor (prepared by the present inventors' company), and 10% FBS.    50 µL of this suspension was added to each well and mixed.    Then, antibody samples were dispensed.    Soluble human IL-6 receptor was prepared by the method indicated below.    A<br><br>
gene that encodes the 1st to the 344th amino acids of the soluble human IL-6 receptor (Yamasaki et al, Science 1988; 241:825-828 (GenBank Accession No. X12830)) was introduced into CHO cells.    Then, the receptor was purified from the culture supernatant.    Cells were cultured for 72 hours under conditions of 37°C and 5% CO2.    Then, WST-8 reagent (Cell Counting Kit-8, Dojindo Laboratories) diluted two-fold with PBS was added at 20 µL/well.    Immediately after, the absorbance at 450 nm (reference wavelength: 620 nm) was measured using SUNRISE CLASSIC (TECAN).    After a two-hour culture, the absorbance at 450 nm (reference wavelength: 620 nm) was measured again.    The IL-6 neutralizing activity was evaluated using the change in absorbance during the two-hour culture as an index.<br>
As a result, as shown in Fig. 22, the fractioned and purified unmodified humanized PM-1 antibody, unmodified/IgG4-substituted humanized PM-1 subclass hybrid antibody, and IgG4-substituted humanized PM-1 antibody had neutralizing activities equivalent to that of a purified product of humanized PM-1 antibody (bulk).    In view of the above, it was shown that the subclass hybrid antibodies do not lose their original antigen-binding activities, and they function as neutralizing antibodies.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
In the methods of the present invention, the isoelectric point of an antibody can be altered by only a small number of amino acid substitutions without changing its structure/function (activity).    This enables efficient purification of bispecific antibodies to high purity using a standard chromatography column.    The high purity allows development of the bispecific antibodies into pharmaceuticals.    Thus, the methods of the present invention are highly useful for developing bispecific antibodies as pharmaceuticals.<br>
