MULTI-SPEED TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]      This   application   claims   the   benefit   of   U.S.    Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/913,248, filed on April 20, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The invention relates generally to a multiple speed automatic<br>
transmission having a plurality of planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque<br>
transmitting devices and more particularly to an eight speed automatic<br>
transmission having four planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting<br>

BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004]	A typical  multiple speed  automatic transmission  uses a<br>
combination of friction clutches, planetary gear arrangements and fixed<br>
interconnections to achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical<br>
arrangement of the planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging,<br>
cost and desired speed ratios.<br>

Attorney Docket No. P001318-PTT-DLT<br>
[0005]	While current automatic transmissions achieve their intended<br>
purpose, the need for new and improved transmission configurations which<br>
exhibit improved performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency,<br>
responsiveness and smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced<br>
size and weight, is essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an<br>
improved, cost-effective, compact multiple speed automatic transmission.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0025] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0026] At the outset, it should be appreciated that the first and the<br>
second embodiments of the eight speed automatic transmission of the present<br>
invention have an arrangement of permanent mechanical connections between<br>
the elements of the four planetary gear sets in common. These mechanical<br>
connections generically link or relate the two transmission embodiments. A first<br>
component or element of a first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a<br>
first component or element of a second planetary gear set. The first component<br>
or element of the second planetary gear set is also permanently coupled to a first<br>
component or element of a third planetary gear set. A second component or<br>
element of the first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a second<br>
component or element of the second planetary gear set. A third component or<br>
element of the second planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a third<br>
component or element of a fourth planetary gear set. A second component or<br>
element of the third planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a second<br>
component or element of the fourth planetary gear set.<br>
[0027] Referring now to Figure 1, a first embodiment of an eight speed<br>
automatic transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram. A lever diagram is a<br>
schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device such as an<br>
automatic transmission. Each individual lever represents a planetary gear set<br>
wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary gear set are<br>
7<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001318-PTT-DLT<br>
each represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes:<br>
one for the sun gear, one for the planet gear carrier and one for the ring gear.<br>
The relative length of each lever between the nodes can be used to represent the<br>
ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gear set. These lever ratios, in turn, are used<br>
to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to achieve appropriate ratios<br>
and an appropriate ratio progression. Mechanical couplings or interconnections<br>
between the nodes of the various planetary gear sets are illustrated by thin,<br>
horizontal lines and torque transmitting devices such as clutches and brakes are<br>
presented as interleaved fingers. If the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is<br>
grounded. Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams<br>
can be found in SAE Paper 810102, "The Lever Analogy: A New Tool in<br>
Transmission Analysis" by Benford and Leising which is hereby fully incorporated<br>
by reference.<br>
[0028] The first embodiment of the eight speed automatic transmission<br>
10 includes an input shaft 12, a first planetary gear set 14 having three nodes: a<br>
first node 14A, a second node 14B and a third node 14C, a second planetary<br>
gear set 16 having three nodes: a first node 16A, a second node 16B and a third<br>
node 16C, a third planetary gear set 18 having three nodes: a first node 18A, a<br>
second node 18B and a third node 18C, a fourth planetary gear set 20 having<br>
three nodes: a first node 20A, a second node 20B and a third node 20C and an<br>
output shaft 22. The input shaft 12 is coupled to the second node 14B of the first<br>
planetary gear set 14 and the third node 16C of the second planetary gear set<br>
16.    The output shaft 22 is coupled to the first node 18A of the third planetary<br>
8<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001318-PTT-DLT<br>
gear set 18. The first node 14A of the first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to the<br>
second node 16B of the second planetary gear set 16 and the third node 18C of<br>
the third planetary gear set 18. The third node 14C of the first planetary gear set<br>
14 is selectively grounded by a first brake 30. The first node 16A of the second<br>
planetary gear set 16 is coupled to the second node 20B of the fourth planetary<br>
gear set 20 and selectively connected to the first node 18A of the third planetary<br>
gear set 18 and the output shaft 22 by a second clutch 38.<br>
[0029] The first node 20A of the fourth planetary gear set 20 is coupled<br>
to the second node 18B of the third planetary gear set 18 and both nodes 18B<br>
and 20A are selectively grounded by a second brake 32. The third node 20C of<br>
the fourth planetary gear set 20 is selectively connected to the first node 14A of<br>
the first planetary gear set 14, the second node 16B of the second planetary gear<br>
set 16 and the third node 18C of the third planetary gear set 18 by a first clutch<br>
36. The third node 20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20 also is selectively<br>
grounded by a third brake 34.<br>
[0030] Referring now to Figure 2, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of the first embodiment of the eight speed automatic transmission 10<br>
according to the present invention. In Figure 2, the numbering from the lever<br>
diagram of Figure 1 is carried over. The clutches, brakes and couplings are<br>
correspondingly presented whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now<br>
appear as components of planetary gear sets, namely sun gears, ring gears and<br>
planet gear carriers. The transmission 10 includes the input shaft 12 which is<br>
coupled to and directly drives a first planet gear carrier 14B of the first planetary<br>
9<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001318-PTT-DLT<br>
gear set 14 and a second sun gear 16C of the second planetary gear set 16.<br>
The first planet carrier 14B includes a plurality of planet gears 14D rotatably<br>
disposed thereon. The output shaft 22 is coupled to and directly driven by a third<br>
planet gear carrier 18A of the third planetary gear set 18. The third planet gear<br>
carrier 18A includes a plurality of pairs or sets of planet gears 18D and 18E<br>
rotatably disposed thereon.<br>
[0031] A first shaft, quill or interconnecting member 42 interconnects a<br>
first ring gear 14A of the first planetary gear set 14 with the first clutch 36 and a<br>
second planet gear carrier 16B of the second planetary gear set 16. The second<br>
planet gear carrier 16B includes a plurality of planet gears 16D rotatably<br>
disposed thereon. A second shaft, quill or interconnecting member 44 connects<br>
the first clutch 36 to a fourth ring gear 20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A<br>
third shaft, quill or interconnecting member 46 interconnects a second ring gear<br>
16A of the second planetary gear set 16 with a fourth planet gear carrier 20B of<br>
the fourth planetary gear set 20 and the second clutch 38. The fourth planet gear<br>
carrier 20B includes a plurality of planet gears 20D rotatably disposed thereon. A<br>
fourth shaft, quill or interconnecting member 48 connects the second planet gear<br>
carrier 16B of the second planetary gear set 16 to the third ring gear 18C of the<br>
third planetary gear set 18. A fifth shaft, quill or interconnecting member 50<br>
interconnects a fourth sun gear 20A of the fourth planetary gear set 20 with a<br>
third sun gear 18B of the third planetary gear set 18 and the second brake 32. A<br>
sixth shaft, quill or interconnecting member 52 connects the third planet gear<br>
carrier 18A of the third planetary gear set 18 to the second clutch 38.<br>
10<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001318-PTT-DLT<br>
[0032] The torque-transmitting mechanisms or clutches 36 and 38 and<br>
the brakes 30, 32, and 34 allow for selective interconnection of the shafts or<br>
interconnecting members, members of the planetary gear sets and the housing.<br>
For example, the first clutch 36 is selectively engageable to connect the first<br>
interconnecting member 42 to the second interconnecting member 44. The<br>
second clutch 38 is selectively engageable to connect the third interconnecting<br>
member 46 to the sixth interconnecting member 52. The first brake 30 is<br>
selectively engageable to connect the first sun gear 14C to the ground or<br>
transmission housing to restrict rotation of the first sun gear 14C relative to the<br>
housing. The second brake 32 is selectively engageable to connect the fifth<br>
interconnecting member 50 to the ground or transmission housing to restrict<br>
rotation of the fifth interconnecting member 50 relative to the housing. Finally,<br>
the third brake 34 is selectively engageable to connect the fourth ring gear 20C<br>
to the ground or transmission housing to restrict rotation of the fourth ring gear<br>
20C relative to the housing.<br>
[0033] Referring now to Figures 2 and 3, the operation of the first<br>
embodiment of the eight speed automatic transmission 10 will be described. It<br>
will be appreciated that the automatic transmission 10 is capable of transmitting<br>
torque from the input shaft 12 to the output shaft 22 in eight forward speed or<br>
torque ratios and one reverse speed or torque ratio. Each forward and reverse<br>
speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of a combination of two of the<br>
clutches or brakes as will be explained below. Figure 3 is a truth table<br>
presenting the various combinations of clutches and brakes that are activated or<br>
11<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001318-PTT-DLT<br>
engaged to achieve the various gear states. Actual numerical gear ratios of the<br>
various gear states are also presented although it should be appreciated that<br>
these numerical values are exemplary only and that they may be adjusted over<br>
significant ranges to accommodate various applications and operational criteria<br>
of the automatic transmission 10.<br>
[0034] To establish reverse gear, the first brake 30 and the third brake<br>
34 are engaged or activated. The first brake 30 grounds the first sun gear 14C of<br>
the first planetary gear set 14 and the third brake 34 grounds the fourth ring gear<br>
20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20.<br>
[0035] Similarly, the eight forward speed or gear ratios are achieved<br>
through different combinations of brake and clutch engagement per Figure 3<br>
[0036] It will be appreciated that the operation and gear states of the<br>
eight speed automatic transmission 10 assumes, first of all, that all brakes and<br>
clutches not specifically referenced in a given gear state are inactive or<br>
disengaged and, second of all, that during gear shifts, i.e., changes of gear state,<br>
between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or brake engaged or activated in<br>
both gear states will remain engaged or activated during the shift.<br>
[0037] Turning now to Figure 4, a lever diagram for a second<br>
embodiment of an eight speed automatic transmission 100 is illustrated. The<br>
automatic transmission 100 includes an input shaft 112, a first planetary gear set<br>
114 having three nodes: a first node 114A, a second node 114B and a third node<br>
114C, a second planetary gear set 116 having three nodes: a first node 116A, a<br>
second node 116B and a third node 116C, a third planetary gear set 118 having<br>
12<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001318-PTT-DLT<br>
three nodes: a first node 118A, a second node 118B and a third node 118C, a<br>
fourth planetary gear set 120 having three nodes: a first node 120A, a second<br>
node 120B and a third node 120C and an output shaft 122.<br>
[0038] The input shaft 112 is coupled to the third node 120C of the<br>
fourth planetary gear set 120. The output shaft 122 is selectively connected to<br>
the second node 114B of the first planetary gear set 114 through a first clutch<br>
134 and to the second node 120B of the fourth planetary gear set 120 through a<br>
third clutch 138. The first node 114A of the first planetary gear set 114 is<br>
selectively grounded through a first brake 130. The first node 118A of the third<br>
planetary gear set 118 is selectively grounded through a second brake 132. The<br>
second node 118B of the third planetary gear set 118 is coupled to the second<br>
node 116B of the second planetary gear set 116 and to the third node 114C of<br>
the first planetary gear set 114. The second node 118B of the third planetary<br>
gear set 118 is also selectively connected to the input shaft 112 through a<br>
second clutch 136. The third node 118C of the third planetary gear set 118 is<br>
coupled to the second node 120B of the fourth planetary gear set 120 and is<br>
selectively connected to the output shaft 122 through a third clutch 138. The first<br>
node 120A of the fourth planetary gear set 120 is coupled to the third node 116C<br>
of the second planetary gear set 116. The first node 116A of the second<br>
planetary gear set 116 is coupled to the second node 114B of the first planetary<br>
gear set 114.<br>
[0039] Referring now to Figure 5, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of the second embodiment of the eight speed automatic transmission 100<br>
13<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001318-PTT-DLT<br>
according to the present invention. In Figure 5, the numbering from the lever<br>
diagram of Figure 4 is carried over. The clutches, brakes and couplings are<br>
correspondingly presented whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now<br>
appear as components of planetary gear sets such a sun gears, ring gears and<br>
planet gear carriers.<br>
[0040] The transmission 100 includes the input shaft 112 which is<br>
connected to and directly drives a fourth ring gear 120C of the fourth planetary<br>
gear set 120. Also connected to and driven by the input shaft 112 is the second<br>
clutch 136. The output shaft 122 interconnects and is selectively driven by the<br>
first clutch 134 and the third clutch 138. A first shaft, quill or interconnecting<br>
member 142 connects the first brake 132 to a first sun gear 118A of the third<br>
planetary gear set 118. A second shaft, quill or interconnecting member 144<br>
interconnects a second planetary gear carrier 116B of the second planetary gear<br>
set 116 to a third planetary gear carrier 118B of the third planetary gear set 118<br>
and the second clutch 136. The second planet gear carrier 116B includes a<br>
plurality of planet gears 116D which are rotatably disposed thereon. The third<br>
planet gear carrier 118B includes a plurality of planet gears 118D rotatably<br>
disposed thereon. A third shaft, quill or interconnecting member 146 connects a<br>
third ring gear 118C of the third planetary gear set 118 to a fourth planetary gear<br>
carrier 120B of the fourth planetary gear set 120 and the third clutch 138. The<br>
fourth planet gear carrier 120B includes a plurality of planet gears 120D which<br>
are rotatably disposed thereon.<br>
14<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001318-PTT-DLT<br>
[0041] A fourth shaft or interconnecting member 148 connects a<br>
second sun gear 116C of the second planetary gear set 116 to a fourth sun gear<br>
120A of the fourth planetary gear set 120. A fifth shaft, quill or interconnecting<br>
member 150 interconnects a second ring gear 116A of the second planetary gear<br>
set 116 to a first planet gear carrier 114B of the first planetary gear set 114. The<br>
first planet gear carrier 114B includes a plurality of planet gears 114D which are<br>
rotatably disposed thereon. Finally, a sixth shaft, quill or interconnecting member<br>
152, which may be an extension or portion of the second shaft, quill or<br>
interconnecting member 144, connects a first sun gear 114C of the first planetary<br>
gear set 114 to the second planet gear carrier 116B of the second planetary gear<br>
set 116.<br>
[0042] The torque-transmitting mechanisms or clutches 134, 136, and<br>
138 and the brakes 130 and 132 allow for selective interconnection of the shafts<br>
or interconnecting members, members of the planetary gear sets and the<br>
housing. For example, the first clutch 134 is selectively engageable to connect<br>
the first planet carrier 114B to the output shaft 122. The second clutch 136 is<br>
selectively engageable to connect the third planet carrier 118B to the input shaft<br>
112 and the fourth ring gear 120C. The third clutch 138 is selectively<br>
engageable to connect the fourth planet carrier 120B to the output shaft 122.<br>
The first brake 130 is selectively engageable to connect the first ring gear 114A<br>
to the ground or transmission housing to restrict rotation of the first ring gear<br>
114A relative to the housing.    Finally, the second brake  132  is selectively<br>
15<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001318-PTT-DLT<br>
engageable to connect the third sun gear 118A to the ground or transmission<br>
housing to restrict rotation of the third sun gear 118A relative to the housing.<br>
[0043] Referring now to Figures 5 and 6, the operation of the second<br>
embodiment of the eight speed automatic transmission 100 will now be<br>
described. It will be appreciated that the automatic transmission 100 is capable<br>
of transmitting torque from the input shaft 112 to the output shaft 122 in eight<br>
forward speed or torque ratios and one reverse speed or torque ratio. Each<br>
forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of a<br>
combination of three of the brakes or clutches as will be explained below.<br>
Figure 6 is a truth table presenting the various combinations of the brakes and<br>
clutches that are activated or engaged to achieve the various gear states. Actual<br>
numerical gear ratios of the various gear states are also presented although it<br>
should be appreciated that these numerical values are exemplary only and that<br>
they may be adjusted over significant ranges to accommodate various<br>
applications and operational criteria of the automatic transmission 100.<br>
[0044] To establish reverse gear, the first brake 130, the first clutch<br>
134 and the third clutch 138 are activated or engaged. The first brake 130<br>
grounds the first ring gear 114A of the first planetary gear set 114. The first<br>
clutch 134 connects the first planet carrier 114B of the first planetary gear set<br>
114 and the second ring gear 116A of the second planetary gear set 116 to the<br>
output shaft 122. The third clutch 138 also connects the third ring gear 118C of<br>
the third planetary gear set 118 and the fourth planet gear carrier 120B of the<br>
fourth planetary gear set 120 to the output shaft 122.<br>
16<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001318-PTT-DLT<br>
[0045] In a similar manner, the eight forward speed or gear ratios are<br>
achieved through different combinations of brake and clutch engagement per<br>
Figure 6.<br>
[0046] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the eight speed automatic transmission 100 assumes, first of<br>
all, that all brakes and clutches not specifically referenced in a given gear state<br>
are inactive or disengaged and, second of all, that during gear shifts, i.e.,<br>
changes of gear state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or brake<br>
engaged or activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated during<br>
the shift.<br>
[0047] The foregoing description of the invention is merely exemplary<br>
in nature and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are<br>
intended to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be<br>
regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
