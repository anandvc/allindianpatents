				<td>PHARMACEUTICAL AND COSMETIC CARRIER OR COMPOSITION FOR TOPICAL APPLICATION<br>
FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical or cosmetic carrier or composition for topical application onto skin and/or mucosal membranes (e.g., the mucosa of the nose, mourn, eye, ear, vagina or rectum). More particularly, the present invention relates to (i) a cosmetic or pharmaceutical carrier or composition characterized by rheological properties which render the carrier or composition semi-solid at rest and liquid upon application of shear forces {e.g., spread forces) thereto: (n) methods of preparing same; and (iii) methods of utilizirg same a variety of skin or mucosal membrane diseases or disorders.<br>
Most of the skin or mucosal membrane diseases or disorders are me result of inflammation caused by inflammatory agents, such as. rrjt not limited to, bacterial, fungal, viral, parasitic, auto immune, iLlergic. hormonal and/or malignant inflammatory agents. The most common skin diseases or disorders include eczema, psoriasis and dermatitis, scolding contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and seborrheic dermarius.<br>
Eczema and dermatitis result from inflammatory processes that involve the upper dermis and epidermis of the skin. When eczema develops, the keratinocytes in the epidermis distend from one anomer and fluid is accumulated there amongst in a process known as spongir-sis.<br>
In chronic forms of eczema or dermatitis the main change include thickening of the epidermis, which leads to itching, roughening and scaling of the skin surface. The loss of water from the skin leads to inflammatiori of the homy layer, which later result in cracked and sore skin.<br>
Dermatitis is further classified into contact dermatitis (allergic or non allergic), atopic dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis.<br><br>
Non allergic contact dermatitis occurs in response to skin irritants, such as acids, alkalis, oils, detergents and solvents.<br>
Allergic contact dermatitis occurs as a result of sensitization to epeated exposure to an antigen. Allergic contact dermatitis appears in ;kin areas that were in direct contact with the antigen.<br>
Atopic dermatitis, which affects mainly infants, is characterized by sensitization of the skin to a wide range of common antigens.<br>
Seborrheic dermatitis affects the scalp and other hairy areas, the face, and flexural areas and results from yeast or bacteria induced inflammation. Most people surfer from dandruff which is a mild form of seborrheic dermatitis.<br>
Psoriasis is a dominant autosomal inherited infjaznmaiory disease characterized by enhanced proliferation of kerariaocytes which proliferation leads to formation of scaly plaques on. for exazipie. die knees, elbows, buttocks, and which are esthetically unpleasant mc -ansa discomfort to the affected subject.<br>
Skin diseases or disorders are usually treated by creams, gels or ointments containing antifungal agents, steroidal agens sDd-V antibacterial agents. In many instances such creams, gels and ornnpsms are difficult to spread, result in a greasy and stick}" appearance and are usually not appealing for use.<br>
Genital infections are caused by fungal, viral and microbial agents. Genitals infections are treated either systematically, or by the use of creams, ointments or pessaries, which usually leak or otherwise fail to spread well and lead to ineffective therapeutic concentration of the therapeutically active agent(s) therein.<br>
Genital herpes infections are widespread from the 70"s and apart from the discomfort they inflict, genital herpes infections may, in some cases, develop into severe disease. Presently, there is no effective medication for genital herpes.<br><br>
Trichomoniasis is an infection of the urogenital tract caused due to infection by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis. Trichomoniasis is associated with uncomfort itching and vaginal excretion in women.<br>
Candidiasis is caused by Candida albicans and results in itching in the genital area and white discharge therefrom.<br>
Mucosal membrane inflammations can affect other organs such as for example, the eye. Conjuctivitis, caused by different types of bacteria, such as, but not limited to, Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae, is generally treated with antibiotic ointments, e.g., bacitracin 500 U/g or gentamicin 0.3 percent ophthalmic ointment instilled into the affected eye. The compliance to these oLsxsents is usually poor due to the sticky feeling they exert.<br>
As is evident from the above descriptions, one of the imponani routes of administration of a drug for treating a skin or mucosal as-zbraoe is by topical application of a drug onto the skin or mucosal ragcbrane. This method is useful for local treatment but it is also possible to apply pessaries via the rectum as an efficient delivery method of systemic agents that are not degraded in the intestine.<br>
Many pharmaceutical carriers are presently known, most ef them have disadvantages when topically applied onto the skin or zrracosai membranes. For example, when ointments containing petrcleira as a carrier are applied onto a skin wound, metabolic products and excr^a from the wound cannot be easily removed therefrom because of the difficulty of passing through the hydrophobic petroleum barrier. In addition, the active drug ingredient, which is dissolved or dispersed in the petroleum carrier, is not efficiently absorbed into the wound tissue, thus, the efficacy of the drug is affected. Another example is ophthalmologic ointments, which are applied into the eye, and make the eye area sticky and uncomfortable. Moreover, in physiological aspect, petroleum restricts respiration of a wound tissue and is disturbing to the normal respiration of the skin.<br><br>
Many groups of drugs including, for example, antibiotic, antifungal, mtiinflammatory, anesthetic, analgesic, antiallergic, corticosteroid, -etinoid and antiproliferative medications are preferably administered typically using a hydrophobic carrier such as petroleum. However, due to the undesirable consistency of petroleum and similar hydrophobic carriers, their topical use is limited. An additional disadvantage of petroleum-carrier including products relates to the greasy feeling following then-topical application to the skin or mucosal membranes.<br>
Besides petroleum, other hydrophobic pharmaceutical carriers are known, including liquid paraffin, lanolin, beeswax, vegetable oil, glycerin monostearate, higher alcohols, polyethylene glycol and some en::^£ift"in£: agents. Al! of these agents either suffer the limitations described hereinabove with respect to petroleum or have undesirable (fast) flow properties.<br>
Several hydrophobic liquids, e.g., mono-and poly-tmsateszsd oils from vegetable and marine sources, silicone oils, mineral oils, and liquid hydrophobic plant-derived oils are known for their therapeuiic effects when applied topically. Oils may also contain essential zcritksa] constituents, such as oil-soluble vitamins (e.g., vitamin A and vssnmi El minerals and other therapeutically effective constituents. AdmiriLsiiaUori of such therapeutic oils in a liquid form does not exert sufScisn: nmounts of the therapeutic agents, because of the oil flow-spread properties Other examples of therapeutic oils include mineral and silicone oils, which are useful for the treatment of skin dehydration and other medical diseases or disorders. These oils are also liquid at ambient temperature.<br>
There is thus a widely recognized need for, and it would be highly advantageous to have a new pharmaceutical or cosmetic composition or carrier which is semi-solid at rest and which liquefies upon application of shear forces thereto, because such a pharmaceutical or cosmetic composition or carrier can be topically applied as a semi-solid onto an<br><br>
affected area and then turn into a liquid upon spreading, resulting in faster absorption and less greasiness and stickiness.<br>

The principles and operation of the present invention may be belter inderstood with reference to the accompanying descriptions and examples.<br>
Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in letail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its replication to the details of composition set forth in the following iescription or examples. The invention is capable of other embodiments Dr of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical or cosmetic carrier comprising, by weight, 1-25 percent of a solidifying agent and 75-99 percent of a hydrophobic solvent, which solvent per se is typically liquid at ambient temperature.<br>
As used herein in the specification and in the claims section that follows, the term "carrier" means a base which is, as is defined in the Collins dictionary, the main ingredient of a mixture. Thus, as used herein a "pharmaceutical carrier" is a pharmaceutical base which is used in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions, whereas a "cosmetic carrier" is a cosmetic base which is used in the preparation of cosmetic compositions.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of preparing a pharmaceutical or cosmetic carrier. The method according to this aspect of the invention is effected by mixing a hydrophobic solvent and a solidifying agent at a temperature above a melting temperature of the solidifymg agent so as to obtain a mixture containing 75-99 percent of the hydrophobic solvent by weight and 1-25 percent of the solidifying agent by weight; and cooling the mixture, e.g., to room temperature. Preferably, prior to the step of mixing, both the hydrophobic solvent and the solidifymg agent are brought to the temperature above the melting temperature of the solidifying agent.<br><br>
According to still another aspect of the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical or cosmetic composition comprising, by weight, 1-25 percent of a solidifying agent and 75-99 percent of a hydrophobic solvent, wherein at least one of the solidifying agent and/or the hydrophobic solvent has a therapeutic or cosmetic beneficial effect<br>
According to yet another aspect of (he present invention there is provided a method of preparing a pharmaceutical or cosmetic composition. The memod according to this aspect of the invention is effected by mixing a hydrophobic solvent and a solidifying agent at a temperature above a melting temperature of the solidifying agent so as to obtain a mixture containing 75-99 percent of the hydrophobic solvent by weight and 1-25 percent of the solidifying agent by weight; and cooling the mixture, e.g., to room temperature. Preferably, prior to the step of mixing, both the hydrophobic solvent and the solidifying agent are brought to the temperature above the melting temperature of the solidifying agent, e.g., 60-80 °C.<br>
Thus, the present invention offers a method of treating a disease or disorder of a skin or a mucosal membrane, such as, but not limited to, a mucosa of a nose, a mucosa of a mouth, a mucosa of an eye, a mucosa of an ear. a mucosa of a vagina and a mucosa of a rectum. The method according to this aspect of the present invention is effected by topically administrating to the skin or the mucosal membrane a pharmaceutical or cosmetic composition containing, by weight, 1-25 percent of a solidifying agent and 75-99 percent of a hydrophobic solvent, wherein at least one of the solidifying agent and the hydrophobic solvent has a therapeutic or cosmetic beneficial effect.<br>
Most preferably, the amount of the solidifying agent in a pharmaceutica] or cosmetic carrier according to the present invention is about 4 percent to  about   12 percent,  whereas the  amount  of the<br><br>
hydrophobic solvent is about 88 percent to about 96 percent of the total weight of the carrier. As used herein the term about refers to ± 20 %.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the solidifying agent includes at least one long chain fatty alcohol having at least 15 carbon atoms in its carbon backbone and/or at least one fatty acid, having at least 18 carbon atoms in its carbon backbone. Preferably, the solidifying agent has at least one alkyl group side chain in its carbon backbone. Additionally or alternatively, the carbon backbone of the fatty acid or the fatty alcohol has at least one hydroxyl group at position a and (3. Still additionally or alternatively, the carbon backbone of the fatty acid oz ibe tarty alcohol has ai leas: one hydroxyl group at positions 8-14. According to presently preferred embodiments of the invention, the solidifying agent preferably includes a 12-hydroxy fatty acid.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the solidifying agent includes a substance selected such that ambient conditions, the carrier is semi-solid at rest and liquefies upon application of shear forces thereto, i.e., has thixotropic properties.<br>
As mentioned above, preferred solidifying agents, according to the present invention, include fatty alcohols having 15 or more carbons in their carbon chain, such as acetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol (or mixtures thereof). Other examples of fatty alcohols include arachidy! alcohol (C20), behenyl alcohol (C22), 1-triacontanol (C30), as well as alcohols with longer carbon chains (e.g., up to C50). The concentration of the fatty alcohol required to obtain the thixotropic properties is inversely related to the length of its carbon chains.<br>
Fatty alcohols, derived from beeswax, comprising a mixture of alcohols, where the majority have at least 20 carbon atoms in their carbon chain, are especially suited as solidifying agents according to the present invention.<br><br>
Another preferred class of solidifying agents includes fatty acids having 18 or more carbons in their carbon chain, such as and stearic acid, arachidic acid (C20), behenic acid (C22), octacosanoic acid (C28), as well as fatty acids with longer carbon chains (e.g., up to C50), or mixtures thereof.<br>
The concentration of the fatty acid required to obtain a thickened carrier is inversely related to the length of its carbon chains. Stearic acid, for example, exerts a considerable thickening effect at about 10 percent concentration, whereas behenic acid would obtain the same thickening effect at a 5 percent concentration.<br>
Optionally, the carbon atom chain of the fatty alcohol or the fatty acid may have at least one double bond.<br>
A further class of solidifying agent according to the present invention comprises long chain fatty alcohols or fatty acids, wherein the carbon atom chain is branched. In an additional preferred class of solidifying agents, the carbon chain of the fatty acid is substituted with a hydroxyl group, e.g.. 12 hydroxy stearic acid.<br>
An important property of the fatty alcohols and fatty acids used in context of the carrier and composition of the present invention is related to ifaeir therapeutic properties per se. Long chain saturated and mono unsaturated fatty alcohols, e.g., stearyl alcohol, erycyl alcohol, arachidyl alcohol and docosanol have been reported to possess antiviral, antiinfective, antiproliferative and antiinflammatory properties (see, U.S. Patent No. 4,874,794, which is incorporated herein by reference). Longer chain fatty alcohols, e.g., tetracosanol, hexacosanol, heptacosanol, octacosanol, triacontanol, etc., are also known for their metabolism modifying properties and tissue energizing properties. Long chain fatty acids have also been reported to possess antiinfective characteristics. Thus, the pharmaceutical or cosmetic carrier of the present invention<br><br>
provides an extra therapeutic or cosmetic benefit in comparison with currently used vehicles, such as petroleum, which are inert and non-active.<br>
According to still another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the hydrophobic solvent includes at least one marine animal derived oil, at least one terrestrial animal derived oil, at least one mineral oil, at least one silicone oil and/or at least one plant-derived oil. Examples include, but are not limited to. olive oil, soybean oil, canola oil, rapeseed oil, cottonseed oil, coconut oil, palm oil, sesame oil, sunflower oil, saffiower oil, rice bran oii, borage seed oil, syzigium aromaticum oil, hempseed oil, herring oil. cod-iiver oil, salmon oil, corn oil, flaxseed oil, wheat germ oil, rape seed oil. evening primrose oil, rosehip oil, tea tree oil, melaleuca oil and/or jqjova oil.<br>
As used herein "tea tree oil" or "melaleuca oil" both refer to distillates of the leaves of the Australian tree, Melaleuca alternifolia. Tea tree oil is assigned the Chemical Abstract number 68647-73-4 and is commercially available from a variety of sources. Tea tree oil is recognized as having properties as a solvent, antiseptic, antibacterial, antifungal, and pain reliever, as well as other uses. Melaleuca oil has been used in soaps, shampoos, hand creams, tooth pastes, and household cieaners. as well as for treatment of warts and oral candidiasis.<br>
A particular]}" preferred class of oils to be used in context of the present invention include poly-unsaturated oils which contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.

When applied on die afflicted body surface of humans or animals, they are in a semi-solid stare, allowing free application without spillage. Upon further application of a mechanical force, e.g., by rubbing the composition onto the body surface, it freely spreads on the surface and is rapidly absorbed. The ease of the application is demonstrated herein in Example 3, where it was compared, in a double blind test to a commercial hydrocortisone preparation. The subjects" score regarding their feeling about the preparation (e.g., the greasiness, stickiness, absorption, penetration, ease of spreading and lack of shiny look) was significantly higher than the score for the commercial preparation.<br><br>
Additional particulars concerning the use of a variety of biologically active substances in context of the present invention, advantages of the present invention over prior art designs and a variety of applications of the present invention are provided hereinafter.<br>
Treatment of wounds:<br>
The present invention may find special advantages in the treatment of wounds. Skin wounds which can be treated using the compositions of the present invention include bum wounds, sunburn, cuts, abrasions, acute and chronic wounds and the like. Treatment of burn, ulcers, acute and chronic wounds typically is directed to keeping the wound as clean as possible and making the patient as comfortable as possible. It has been recognized in this respect that keeping the wound moist is advantageous to patient comfort. "While maintaining a moist environment will effect some cooling of the tissue, it would be advantageous to be able to decrease the intradermal temperature of a burn wound, which would help to alter the progression of the tissue damage due to heat within the tissues.<br>
Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide a method for improved treatment of a bum wound that permits significant lowering of the intradermal temperature of the bum wound such that the extent of the bum wound may be limited. Compositions which have antimicrobial agents combined with agents that lead to cooling effect, and which are devoid of adherence to the wound offer relief to people who are suffering from bums or ulcers. The present invention provides a protective moisture barrier to contribute to the sterility of the dressing and to maintain the moistness of the dressing. Sterility is enhanced by the bacteriostatic properties of the wound treatment composition, as well as the shielding action of the barrier"s physical presence. An additional barrier to bacteria and contamination is the packaging utilized with the present invention and which is addressed in more detail below.<br><br>
The wound treatment composition of the present invention comprises as the hydrophobic solvent, for example without limitation, tea tree oil, melaleuca oil and other ingredients in a thixotropic gel formulation. As stated hereinabove, Tea tree oil, or Melaleuca alternifolia, is a natural plant extract. The unique wound treatment composition, in addition to creating a moist, soothing environment, is also inherently bacteriostatic. It helps leave the surface of wounds clean and odor free. The odor of chronic wounds is a major concern of health care workers and caregivers. The effectiveness of Melaleuca is increased in the presence of blood and organic material, rather than decreased as is the case "with other bacteriostatic products. Melaleuca oil is a natural oil which is considered to be safe and effective on all kinds of cuts and abrasions, surgical wounds, diabetic and mouth ulcers and foot fungi.<br>
The application of the composition of the present invention onto cms, wounds, burns and ulcers is beneficial both in the cure of an infection or in the protection of the skin from infection. In all such cases, the composition of the present invention is easy to use, being semi-solid when applied and becoming liquid instantly upon rubbing onto the skin.<br>
Suppositories:<br>
For treatment of vaginal infections, suppositories provide an effective mode for administration of a therapeutic agent. Although suppositories have attained some success, they have some disadvantages. Most of the current commercial vaginal suppositories, either melt or dissolve in the vaginal tract into an oily or aqueous liquid. This resulting liquid in turn tends to leak out or is expelled out of the vaginal cavity resulting either in soiled clothing andVor inferior efficacy. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an effective antifungal suppository formulation, which overcomes the noted disadvantages associated with the prior art suppositories.<br><br>
The suppository formulation of the invention is useful in treating vaginal fungus infections in mammalian species, such as humans, cats, dogs and the like. The suppository formulation will be easily inserted into the vaginal cavity and will melt at body temperature soon after insertion. Upon melting, the suppository turns into a gel/cream like consistency, which will adheres to the vaginal membrane thereby providing prolonged duration of effectiveness.<br>
As mentioned above, a pharmaceutical or cosmetic composition in accordance with the teachings of the present invention may include a biologically active substance. The following provides some examples. Antiviral agents:<br>
The carrier or composition of the present invention is beneficial in -.he treatment of viral infections. For example, cold sores are caused by me jerpes simplex Type I virus and are sometimes referred to as facial lerpes. Mollusca are small viral growths that appear singly or in groups m the face, trunk, lower abdomen, pelvis, inner thighs or penis. Shingles herpes zoster), which usually only occurs once in a lifetime, appears as a ash (clusters of blisters with a red base). It is caused by the same virus esponsible for chickenpox. Warts are a common, benign skin tumor aused by viral infection. Eye viral infections, such as viral conjunctivitis s highly contagions and spreads by droplet, fomites, and hand-to-eye ioc ulation.<br>
Viral infections are currently treated with various antiviral agents, s is summarized in Table 1 below:<br>

Table 1 (Continued)<br>
It will be appreciated that the intrinsic antiviral effects of the soh"difying agents, e.g., fatty alcohols and acids, provides a synergistic effect that will result in a higher therapeutic response.<br>
Antiparasite agents:<br>
The biologically active substance contained in a composition of the present invention in a therapeutically effective amount may be an antiparasite agent, such as. but not limited to, hexachlorobenzene, carbamate; naturally occurring pyrethroids, permethrin, allethrin, malaihion, prperonyl butoxide or rnixtures of these drugs.<br>
Antimicrobial agents:<br>
Antimicrobial agents, also referred to as germicidal agents, which may be used in compositions of the present invention include phenols, including cresols and resorcinols. Antibacterial compositions according to the present invention may be used to treat infections of the skin.   An<br><br>
example of a very common skin infection is acne, which involve infestation of the sebaceous gland with p. acnes, as well as Staphylococus aunts or Psevdomonas. Various antibacterial agents have been utilized to treat acne, however, their efficacy is limited due to their low penetration into the hydrophobic environment of the sebaceous gland. The composition of the present invention, being hydrophobic by nature would facilitate an enhanced rate of penetration. Examples of useful antiacne actives include the keratolyses such as salicylic acid (o-hydroxybenzoic acid), derivatives of salicylic acid such as 5-octanoyl salicylic acid, and resorcinol; retinoids such as retinoic acid and its derivatives (e.g., cis and trans): sulfur-containing D and L amino acids and their derivatives and salts, particular})" their N-acetyl derivatives, a preferred example of which is N-aceryl-L-cysteine: lipoic acid; antibiotics and antimicrobials such as benzoyl peroxide, octopirox tetracycline. 2,4,4"-trichioro-2,-hydroxy diphenyl ether, 3.4,4"-tricMorobanilide, azelaic acid and its derivatives, phenoxyethanol, phenoxypropanol, phenoxyisopropanol, ethyl acetate, clindamycin and meclocycline: sebostats such as flavonoids; and bile salts such as scymnol sulfate and its derivatives, deoxycholate and cholate.<br>
The intrinsic antibacterial and antiinflammatory effects of the solidifying agents, i.e., fatty alcohols and acids, of the composition of the presen; invention provide a combined synergetic effect that results in a better therapeutic response to treatment.<br>
Eye infections are another preferred target for the composition of the present invention. Conjuctivitis. involving bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae^ and Haemophilus influenzae is generally treated with antibiotic ointments, e.g., bacitracin 500 U/g or 0.3 percent ophthalmic ointment instilled into the affected eye. Yet, ointment applied into the eye created a sticky feeling and causes major disturbances to the patient. The composition of the present invention, which turns from semi-solid consistency into liquid instantly<br><br>
after application, does not have that disadvantage and thus, treatment compliance is expected to improve. The same advantage is expected when the composition of the present invention is topically applied to mucosal membranes, the oral cavity, the vagina or the rectum.<br>
Another example is parachlorometaxylenol, which is an antimicrobial agent and is suitable for use in the compositions described in the present invention.<br>
Phenols, in concentrations of about 0.2, 1.0, and 1.3 percent by weight are bacteriostatic, bactericidal, and fungicidal, respectively. While it is not intended that the present invention be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the germicidal action of phenols at these concentrations is effected through protein denaturation. The phenol-protein interaction is relatively weak, allowing the phenol molecule to penetrate deeply into the tissue. Thus, phenol can penetrate relatively dense, intact keratinous matrices, such as the stratum corneum or the nail plate. Several phenol derivatives are more potent than phenol itself, and the most important among these are the halogenated phenols and bis-phenols.     the     alkyl-substituted     phenols     and     the     resorcinols.<br>
Optionally, the present invention may provide a solution for body odors by including hydrophobic antibacterial compounds to help destroy and-"or control the amount of bacteria present on the skin, which aids in body odor control.<br>
Hydrophobic antibacterials useful in the present invention include triclosan, triclocarbon, eucalyptol. menthol, methylsalicylate, thymol, and mixtures thereof. Preferred are triclosan and triclocarbon. When included in the composition of the present invention, the hydrophobic antibacterials may be at a level of from about 0.1 percent to about 1.5 percent and preferably from about 0.1 percent to about 0.3 percent, by weight of the composition.<br><br>
Antifungal agents:<br>
Funga! infections are another object of treatment using the compositions of the present invention. Superficial fungal infection of the skin is one of the commonest skin disease seen in general practice. Dermatopbytosis is probably the most common superficial fungal infection of the skin. It is caused by a group of fungi, which are capable of metabolizing the keratin of human epidermis, nails or hair. There are 3 genera of dermatophytes causing dermatophytosis i.e,, microsporum, trichophyton and epidermophyton.<br>
Candidiasis is an infection caused by the yeast like fungus Candida albican or occasionally other species of"Candida, Clinical syndromes of candidiasis include (a) oral candidiasis (oral thrush); (b) candidiasis of the skin and genital mucous membrane; and (c) Candida paronychia, which inflicts me nail.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can<br>
contain an antifungal drug, which is active against dermatophytes and<br>
Candida. The drug may include azotes, diazoles, triazoles, miconazole,<br>
fluconazole, ketoconazole. clotrimazole, itraconazole griseofulvin,<br>
ciclopirox, amorolfine, terbinafine. Amphotericin B, potassium iodide,<br>
flucytosine (5FC) and any combination thereof at a therapeutically<br>
effective concentration. U.S. Pat No. 4,352,808 discloses 3-araikyloxy-<br>
23-dihydro-2-(lH-miidazolylmethyI)benzo[b]thiophene	compounds<br>
having antifungal and antibacterial activity.<br>
Steroidal antiinflammatory agents:<br>
Suitable steroidal antiinflammatory agents usable in the composition of the present invention may include, although are not limited to, corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone, hydroxyltriamcinolone alphamethyl dexamethasone, dexamethasone-phosphate, beclomethasone dipropionate, clobetasol valerate, desonide, desoxymemasone, desoxycorticosteroae acetate, dexamethasone, dichlorisone. diflorasone<br><br>

Table 2 (Continued)<br>
Since all corticosteroid drugs are hydrophobic, the carrier of the present invention is most suitable as a vehicle to facilitate an enhanced rate of penetration and better topical distribution thereof.<br>
Furthermore5 the intrinsic antiviral, antibacterial and antiinflammatory effects of the solidifying agents, i.e., fatty alcohols and acids, provide a combined synergetic effect that should result in a better therarjeirti: response to treatment.<br>
Psoriasis is a very common chronic inflammatory skin disease, which may be the target of treatment using a composition of the present invention. Psoriasis is marked by periodic flare-ups of sharply defined red patches covered by a silvery, flaky surface.<br>
Corticosteroid ointments, greasy preparations containing small amount of water, are commonly used for treating psoriasis. Their main disadvantage is in their stickiness, which remains for long time after treatment is over. In this respect it should be noted that the present invention exemplifies the use of a hydrocortisone containing composition that was prepared according to the teachings of the present invention (see Example 1 below). The hydrocortisone preparation was compared to a commercial composition (Example 2) and was shown be highly efficient in the treatment of psoriatic patients. Major reduction in the severity of the disease symptoms, i.e.. disappearance of the silvery scales, and reduction of the oedema, erythema and pruritus were observed. Moreover the patients reported that unlike the ointments which are currently available in the market (see Table 2 above), the composition of the present invention<br><br>
was well distributed and absorbed into the skin, without leaving an undesirable greasiness and shiny appearance which characterized the prior art formulations.<br>
Examples of other inflammatory diseases or disorders, which can be treated by the composition of the present invention, wherein the drug is a steroid are: seborrheic dermatitis of the face and trunk, seborrheic blepharitis, contact dermatitis, stasis dermatitis (gravitational eczema; varicose eczema), exfoliative dermatitis (erythroderma), lichen simplex chronicus, pemphigus, conjuctivitis and uveitis.<br>
Topical antihistamine preparations currently available include 1 percent 33d 2 percent diphenhydramine (Benadryl® and Caladryl®}. 5 percent doxepin (Zortalon®) cream, phrilamine maleate, chlorpheniramine and tripeleonamine, phenothiazines. promethazine hydrochloride (Phenergan^,) and dimethindene maleate. These drugs, as well as additional antirnstamines can also be included in the composition of the present invention.<br>
Additionally, so-called "natural" antiinflammatory agents are useful in context of the present invention. For example, candeiilla wax, alpha bisabolol, aloe vera, Manjistba (extracted from plants in the genus Rubia, particularly Rubia cordifolid), and Guggal (extracted from plants in the genus Commiphora, particularly Commiphora mukul, may be used as an active ingredient in the composition of the present invention.<br>
Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAffls):<br>
Another preferred embodiment of the present invention is adrninistration of nou-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (herein NSATDs) using a composition of the present invention. NSATDs have been used extensively in recent years for treatment of chronic rheumatic 01 arthritic conditions and for management of pain. The compounds are believed to bring relief by inhibiting biosynthesis of prostaglandins at affected joints or in other tissue areas. Salicylic acid, or aspirin, and ibuprofen are well-<br><br>
known examples of NSAIDs drugs. Patients using NSAIDs drugs administered orally face an increased risk for peptic ulcers and gastrointestinal blood loss resulting in anemia. Such adverse reactions especially plague patients taking NSAIDs drugs over prolonged periods. Administration of NSAIDs to using the carrier of the present invention will prevent gastrointestinal complications associated with the oral administration of NSAIDs. Such compositions can be used for prolonged treatment of arthritis and other diseases or disorders treated by NSAIDs drugs, while avoiding the gastrointestinal complications associated with oral dose delivery. Application of NSAIDs drugs in a topical composition to the skin of a patient allows a predetermined amount of the NSAIDs drug to be administered continuously to the patient and avoids undesirable effects present with a single or multiple adrninistratioos of larger dosages. By mamiamfrig a sustained dosage rate, the NSAIDs drug level in the patients blood can be better maintained within the optimal therapeutic range<br>
Examples of NSAIDs include the following categories: propionic acid derivatives: acetic acid derivatives: feoamic acid derivatives; biphenvlcarboxylic acid derivatives: and oxicams. All of these NSAIDs are fully described in the U.S. Pat. No. 4,985,459 to Sunshine et a!, which is incorporated herein by reference. Examples of useful NSAIDs include acetyl salicylic acid, ibuprofen, naproxen, benoxaprofen, flurbiprofen, fenoprofen, fenbufen, ketoprofen, indoprofen, pirprofen, carprofeiL osaprozin, pranoprofen. mniroprofen, tioxaprofen, suprofen, alminoproferi, tiaprofenic acid, fluprofen and bucloxic acid.<br>

Massage oils:<br>
The compositions of the present invention are particularly suitable to serve as ingredients in massage oils. Unlike conventional massage oils, which are liquid and readily spill upon application, the compositions of the present invention are semi-solid when applied and thus, can be safely poored onto the skin without spillage. Once it is rubbed into the skin, the thick texture is brand the oil can be easily massaged. Base oils of massage formulations often comprise sunflower (Helianthns annuus) oil, canola •Brassica nav-js
Essential oils are often added \a massage oils.  Such essential oils<br>
bciude, for example, oils of mandarin, [Citrus reticulata var. mandarin),<br>
sage (Salvia officinalis), geranium rose (Pela. graveolens xasperium),<br>
ualmarosa   (Cynbopogon    martini),    nutmeg    (Myristica   frangrans),<br>
rosewood   (Anita   roseaodora),    cedarwood   (Juniperus   virginiana),<br>
Datchouli   (Pogostemon   cabliri),   cardamom   (Elettaria   cardamomwri)<br>

landalwood (Santalum album), clary sage (Salvia sclarea), rose (Rosa<br>
:entifalia),    jasmine,    (Jasminum    grandiflorum),    yarrow    (Achillea<br>
nillefolium),  tanacetum (Tanacetum  annuwn), ylang ylang (Cananga<br>
&gt;doraid)    vetiver    [Vettvertia    ziianioidts),    rosemary    (Rosmarinus<br>
officinalis),  birch  (Betulalenta),   grapefruit  (Citrus paradisi),  cypress<br>
Cupressus  sempervirens),  peppermint  (Mentha piperita),  bay laurel<br><br>
(Lauras nobilis), black pepper (Piper nigrum), ginger root {Zingiber officinale), juniper berry (Juniperus communis), lemongrass (Cymbopogon flexuosus) and -wintergreen (Gaultheria procumbens).<br>
The massage oil formulations of the present invention may also contain therapeutic agents, e.g., anti-infective agents, steroidal and non¬steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, in order to obtain a therapeutic effect with the massage.<br>
Lubricating oils:<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also be utilize as a lubricating formula in such cases which require lubrication of a skin area. The lubricating oils may also contain therapeutic agents, e.g., anti-rAerive agents, steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, in order to obiain a merapsutic effect upon application.<br>
Administration via dermal patch;<br>
Tne compositions of the present invention may also be delivered to the skin using conventional dermal-type patches or articles, wherein the active ingredients composition is contained within a laminated structure, ±si serves as a drug delivery device to be affixed to the skin. In such a structure, the active ingredients composition is contained in a layer, or ""reservoir", underlying an upper backing layer. The laminated structure rosy contain a single reservoir, or it may coatain multiple reservoirs. In on? embodiment, the reservoir comprises a polymeric matrix of a phannaceuticaily acceptable contact adhesive material that serves to affix the system to the skin during active ingredients delivery, Examples of suitable skin contact adhesive materials include, but are not limited to, poly ethylenes, polysiloxanes, poiyisobutylenes, polyacrylates, poryuxethanes, and the like. The particular polymeric adhesive selected will depend on the particular active ingredients, vehicle, etc., i.e., the adhesive must be compatible with all components of the active ingredients-containing composition. Alternatively, the active ingredients-<br><br>
4* containing reservoir and skin contact adhesive are present as separate and<br>
distinct layers, with the adhesive underlying the reservoir which, in this<br>
case, may be either a polymeric matrix as described above, or it may be a<br>
liquid or hydrogel reservoir, or may take some other form.<br>
The backing layer in these laminates, which serves as the upper<br>
surface of the device, functions as the primary structurat element of the<br>
laminated structure and provides the device with much of its flexibility.<br>
The materia] selected for the backing material should be selected so that it<br>
is substantially impermeable to the active ingredients and to any other<br>
components   of the   active   ingredients-containing   composition,   thus<br>
^revesting loss of any components through the upper surface of the<br>
device.    The backing layer may be either occlusive or nonocchisive,<br>
depending on whether it is desired that the skin become hydrated during<br>
active ingredients delivery.  The backing is preferably made of a sheet or<br>
5in of a preferably flexible elastomeric material.  Examples of polymers<br>
hat are suitable for the backing layer include polyethylene, polypropylene,<br>
ad polyesters.<br>
During storage and prior to use. the laminated structure includes a<br>
■elsase liner.   Immediately prior to use. this layer is removed from the<br>
[evice to expose the basal surface thereof, either the active ingredients<br>
eservoir or a separate contact adhesive layer, so that the system may be<br>
firmed to the skin.   The release liner should be made from an active<br>
^gredients/vehicle impermeabie material.<br>
Such devices may be fabricated using conventional techniques,<br>
nown in the art, for example by casting a fluid admixture of adhesive,<br>
ctrve ingredients  and  vehicle onto the backing layer,  followed  by<br>
iroination of the release liner.   Similarly, the adhesive mixture may be<br>
ist onto the release iiner, followed by lamination of the backing layer.<br>
iteraatively,. the active ingredients reservoir may be prepared in the<br><br>
absence of active ingredients or excipient, and then loaded by "soaking" in a active ingredients/vehicle mixture.<br>
Therapeutic effect and dosage:<br>
The therapeutic efficacy of the compositions described herein can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in experimental animal models or human beings. The data obtained from these studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human (See e.g., Fingl, eta!., 1975, in "The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics", Ch.l p,I).<br>
The effective concentration of the drug is calculated by procedures known in the art that can be employed to detemune the effective local concentration. For example, corticosteroid induced vasoconstriction in •^-w may provide a preliminary useful hint to topical antiinflammatory activity.<br>
The amount of a composition to be administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration, the judgment of the prescribing physician, etc.<br>
Short term studies over one or two weeks may not be the only relevant mvesrigatict for the clinical comparison of the topical drugs. In oracrice these are sometimes applied over long periods of time and the lirferences may be apparent only after months of treatment. For this -eason. depending on the novelty of the product and the indications uaimed, certain studies of efficacy as well as of safety will be required.<br>
Since the hydrophobic agent can be derived from a biological ource, it is necessary to assess the repeatability of the therapeutic effect as veil as the reproducibility, the specificity and the accuracy of the agent, "his should be done by an analytical chemistry laboratory which is defined s GLP (Good Laboratory Practice).<br>
Compositions of the present invention may, if desired, be presented 1 a bottle or jar or other container approved by the FDA, which may ontain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient.<br><br>
Compositions such as those described in the present invention may be particularly susceptible to microbial and other contamination, and special measures need to be taken to prevent any contamination. The pack or dispenser may also be accompanied by a notice associated with the container in a form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals, which notice is reflective of approval by the agency of the form of the compositions or human or veterinary administration. Such notice, for example, may be of labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for prescription drugs or of an approved product insert. Compositions comprising a preparation of the invention formulated in a compatible pharmaceutical carrier may also be prepared, placed in an appropriate container, and labeled for treatment of an indicated condition. Suitable conditions indicated on ibe label may include treatment for acne or for psoriasis and i.e like.<br>
Hie gist and advantages of the present invention over the prior art<br>
The gist of the present invention is based on the striking discovery<br>
mar the addition of fatty alcohols to hydrophobic liquids, such as saturated,<br>
aonc-unsaturated or poly-unsaturated oils, as well as mineral and silicone<br>
r-IIs- may aher ms physicochemical properties of the material, including<br>
ie solidification thereof.   This appears to be particularly relevant when<br>
he fatty alcohol has a molecular weight greater than 200 Da and at least<br>
me hydroxyl group ir. its chemical structure.   The addition of a fatty<br>
ilcofcol to a liquid oil also gives rise to thixotropic properties (e.g., being<br>
emi-solid at rest and liquid upon application of shear forces thereto).<br>
"his property enables application of a thixotropic rnixture as a semi-solid<br>
tale to a body surface, which subsequently becomes substantially liquid<br>
nd therefore more spreadable and penetrable when rubbed onto the body<br>
urface.   Thus, one of the most important properties of the carrier and<br><br>
composition of the present invention is that they are semi-solid at rest and that they liquefy upon application of shear forces thereto. Semi-solid hydrophobic formulations are important not only for the pharmaceutical market but .also for cosmetic products, such as carriers of sunscreen compounds, oil-soluble plant extracts, materials for scrubbing purposes and other active and non-active cosmetic ingredients. Unlike aqueous liquids, which are rather easy to solidify due to their hydrogen bond forming ability, oils are difficult to solidify. Several methods have been proposed to increase the viscosity of oils. Various gelling agent, such as inorganic compiexing agents (U.S. Pat. No. 4,780,309), hydrocolloids /U.S. Pal Nc. 4,576,645), polymers and copolymers (U.S. Pat. No. :,2?r,321; 5,925,707), polysaccharides (U.S. Pat. No. 5,961,998) have been previously described in the context of soh"difying oils for use in food and cosmetics. The use of waxes, fatty alcohols, fatty acids and 12 hydroxy stearic acid in solidifying waste oils, in order to facilitate the removal of such oils have also been described (JP-A-112385/1979; JP-A-106298/1980). U.S. Pat. No. 5,817,322 teaches pharmaceutical -CGDOsitions, comprising an oil and beeswax as a gelling agent, which roan a netted framework of the beeswax and form a film after application on a body surface.<br>
However, the prior art fails to teach a carrier or composition for isoica! application which is semi-solid at rest and which liquefies upon application of shear forces thereto.<br>
