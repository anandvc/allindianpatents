TRICHROMATIC DYEING PROCESS<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the trichromatic dyeing or printing of natural or synthetic polyamide fibres or such fibres as contain polyamide with dye mixtures and also to such dye mixtures and polyamide fibres dyed or printed therewith.<br>
Trichromatic describes the additive colour mixing of suitable yellow- or orange-, red-and blue-dyeing dyes with which any desired shade in the visible spectrum can be obtained by suitably selecting the amount ratios for the dyes.<br>
Trichromatic dyeing is well known from the literature for various dye classes, for example from EP 83299, DE 2623178, EP 226982 and EP 808940.<br>
Optimum trichromatic performance of any yellow, red and blue dye mixture is crucially dependent on the neutral affinity and migration characteristics. Dyes having identical or very similar characteristics with regard to neutral affinity and migration are highly compatible with regard to trichromatic performance. Combinations of dyes having good trichromatic properties are known for monosulphonated acid dyes. By contrast, no such dye mixtures are known to date for disulphonated acid dyes, for example the Nyiosan® F dyes from Clariant.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a trichromatic dyeing process and associated trichromatic dye mixtures consisting of at least one blue component, at least one yellow component and at least one red component whereby trichromatic dyeing with good fastnesses is made possible even for disulphonated acid dyes.<br>
This object is achieved by a trichromatic dyeing process which is characterized in that it comprises using a dye mixture consisting of at least one blue-dyeing compound of the formula (I)<br><br><br>

It is to be noted that all compounds may also be present in salt form. Useful salts include in particular alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or ammonium salts or the salts of an organic amine.<br>
It is likewise to be noted that the alkyl groups can be linear or branched.<br>
The individual dyes and their syntheses are described in the literature.<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) are prepared according to WO 99/5168, compounds of the formula (II) according to DE 2302582, compounds of the formula (III) according to DE 4209261, compounds of the formulae (IV) and (Va) according to DE 5565480 and compounds of the formula (V) according to GB 810246.<br>
This invention further provides dye mixtures for the trichromatic dyeing or printing of natural or synthetic polyamide fibre material or such polyamide-containing material which are used in the above processes according to the invention.<br>
The inventive process for trichromatic dyeing or printing can be applied to all customary and known dyeing and printing processes, for example the continuous process, the exhaust process, the foam dyeing process and the ink-jet process.<br>
The composition of the individual dye components in the trichromatic dye mixture used in the process according to the invention depends on the desired hue. For instance, a brown hue preferably utilizes 55-65% by weight of the yellow component according to the invention, 20-30% by weight of the red component according to the invention and 10-20% by weight of the blue component according to the invention.<br>
The red component, as described above, can consist of a single component or of a mixture of different red individual components which conform to the formulae (III), (IV) and (V). Preference is given to double and triple combinations. It is to be noted that the components of the individual red components of the formulae (III)-(V) can themselves be mixtures.<br><br>
When a red individual component consisting of only one red component of the formula (III) is used, its fraction should not exceed 50% by weight of the trichromatic colour<br>
mixture.<br>
When a red triple mixture consisting of one each of at least one red compound of the formula (III) and at least one red compound of the formula (IV) and at least one red compound of the formula (V), the fraction of the compounds of the formula (III) should not exceed 40% by weight based on the triple red mixture.<br>
The total amount of dyes in the process according to the invention is between 0.01 and 15% by weight, preferably between 1 and 10% by weight.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention, as well as the dyes and the water, further contain anionic or nonionic dyeing or printing auxiliaries.<br>
• Such auxiliaries are in particular wetting agents, antifoams, levelling agents, thickeners and plasticizers.<br>
The present invention further provides substrates consisting of natural or synthetic polyamide or polyamidic substrates dyed or printed by a dye mixture according to the invention.<br>
The process according to the invention provides dyeings and prints having a homogeneous hue build-up throughout the entire hue spectrum with on-tone exhaustion, with a high bath exhaustion even in the case of fibres with low saturation and with a high dye build-up on fine fibres, particularly on microfibres.<br>
The resulting dyeings or prints are notable for very high wet fastnesses, specifically the fastnesses in washing, perspiration and water. These good wet and fabrication fastnesses, which are in no way inferior to the fastness level of dyeings and prints with metal complexes, are obtained without aftertreatment. With an additional after-treatment, these fastnesses are even exceeded.<br>
These excellent results are provided by metal-free elements which meet the current and future ecological requirements of national institutes and regulations.<br><br>
The tables which follow show some examples of the individual components of the dye mixtures which are used together with the anionic or nonionic dyeing or printing auxiliary.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
