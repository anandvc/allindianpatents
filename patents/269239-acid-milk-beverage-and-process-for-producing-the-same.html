ACID MILK BEVERAGE AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The invention relates to an acid milk beverage having<br>
an excellent product quality stability and a good taste<br>
resulting in neither aggregation nor precipitation of milk<br>
protein and, more particularly, it relates to an acid milk<br>
beverage in which deterioration of quality specific to an acid<br>
milk beverage such as aggregation and precipitation of milk<br>
protein is prevented and a good taste is obtainable even without<br>
the substantial use of thickening stabilizers.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Acid milk beverages of a type containing living microbes<br>
such as fermented milk, lactic acid bacteria beverage and<br>
yogurt have been widely drunk as healthy beverages having<br>
physiological activities such as an effect of calming<br>
intestinal disorders and an immunopotentiating action.<br>
Further, since a culture liquid (a fermented milk base)<br>
prepared by incubation of lactic acid bacteria or microbes<br>
belonging to genus Bifidobacterium in a medium comprising a<br><br>
milk material has a specific taste, it has been utilized in<br>
various kinds of foods and beverages for the purpose of<br>
imparting flavor, etc. following a sterilizing treatment, etc.<br>
[0003]<br>
Furthermore, in order to cope with the recent<br>
diversifying preferences of consumers, various types of acid<br>
milk beverages have been proposed in addition to the<br>
conventional acid milk beverages and, among them, development<br>
of an acid milk beverage of the so-called light type in which<br>
calorie is suppressed has been briskly carried out. Usually,<br>
such an acid milk beverage of a light type is produced in such<br>
a manner that, for suppressing the calories, glucides which<br>
are main calorie source are decreased or substituted with<br>
hardly-digesting glucides. However, dispersibility of milk<br>
protein usually becomes unstable under an acid condition and,<br>
therefore, there are problems that precipitation and<br>
aggregation upon storage, separation of whey, etc. are apt to<br>
occur when glucides are decreased or modified.<br>
[0004]<br>
The above-mentioned precipitation, aggregation or whey<br>
separation not only deteriorate the appearance significantly<br>
but also affect the flavor upon drinking and further<br>
deteriorate the refreshing feel and, therefore, various<br>
methods have been proposed to improve these problems. To be<br>
more specific, there have been proposals for a method where<br><br>
a homogenizing treatment is applied with a purpose of improving<br>
the product quality stability of an acid milk beverage (Patent<br>
Document 1) and a method where one of thickening stabilizers<br>
such as pectin, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), soybean<br>
polysaccharide, gellan gum, locust bean gum, tamarind gum or<br>
propylene glycol alginate or two or more thereof is/are used<br>
together (Patent Documents 2 to 4).<br>
[0005]<br>
As such, it is the current status that, in the production<br>
of acid milk beverage of a light type, various kinds of<br>
thickening stabilizers are commonly used.<br>
[0006]<br>
Patent Document 1: JP-A-05-000043<br>
Patent Document 2: JP-A-54-525754<br>
Patent Document 3: JP-A-59-151837<br>
Patent Document 4: JP-A-09-266779<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems that the Invention is to Solve<br>
[0007]<br>
However, in an acid milk beverage where not only<br>
stability of product quality but also flavor are to be regarded<br>
as important, there have been some cases where specific viscous<br>
feeling inherent to said thickening stabilizer gives<br>
unfavorable texture in terms of flavor when a thickening<br><br>
stabilizer is used as having been done conventionally.<br>
Further, pectin and CMC which have been commonly and frequently<br>
used as thickening stabilizers have a property of becoming gel<br>
in a low pH region and their utilization to an acid milk beverage<br>
is not always an effective means.<br>
[0008]<br>
Furthermore, in an acid milk beverage of the so-called<br>
light type in which calorie is suppressed, there is a tendency<br>
that the flavor of both reasonable sweet taste and refreshing<br>
texture is favored and, therefore, use of a thickening<br>
stabilizer or the like giving viscous feeing is not always<br>
preferred.<br>
[0009]<br>
Accordingly, the problem that the invention is to solve<br>
is to provide an acid milk beverage of a light type where,<br>
without the use of conventionally used various kinds of<br>
thickening stabilizers, the product quality stability is<br>
excellent, flavor is good and calorie is suppressed and also<br>
to provide a process for producing the same.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
[0010]<br>
The present inventors have carried out intensive<br>
investigations for preparing a low-calorie acid milk beverage<br>
having an excellent product quality stability without the use<br><br>
of a thickening stabilizer and, as a result, they have found<br>
that, when polydextrose and a specific glucide are compounded<br>
with an acid milk beverage so as to satisfy the predetermined<br>
condition, it is now possible to prepare a good-flavored acid<br>
milk beverage having the same product quality stability as in<br>
the case of the use of a thickening stabilizer whereupon the<br>
invention has been achieved.<br>
[0011]<br>
Thus, the invention relates to an acid milk beverage,<br>
characterized in that, the beverage contains polydextrose and<br>
at least one glucide selected from the group consisting of (a)<br>
glucose, fructose, sugar, trehalose, maltose, erythritol,<br>
sorbitol, xylitol, maltitol, lactitol, palatinose and<br>
galacto-oligosaccharide, wherein the total amount of those<br>
soluble solids is 12.0% by mass to 17.0% by mass and<br>
substantially no thickening stabilizer is contained therein.<br>
[0012]<br>
The invention also relates to a process for producing<br>
an acid milk beverage, characterized in that, polydextrose and<br>
at least one glucide selected from the group (a) glucose,<br>
fructose, sugar, trehalose, maltose, erythritol, sorbitol,<br>
xylitol, maltitol, lactitol, palatinose and<br>
galacto-oligosaccharide are compounded with an acid milk<br>
beverage base so that the total amount of those soluble solids<br>
is made 12.0% by mass to 17.0% by mass.<br><br>
Advantages of the Invention<br>
[0013]<br>
Polydextrose and various glucides used in the invention<br>
are food materials which have been commonly used as sweeteners<br>
and, therefore, they are excellent in safety and, when they<br>
are used merely in such a manner of satisfying the predetermined<br>
condition, stability of milk protein under an acidic condition<br>
is able to be easily enhanced without the use of various<br>
thickening stabilizers which are apt to affect flavor and<br>
palatability whereby it is now possible to produce an acid milk<br>
beverage having an excellent product quality stability and a<br>
good flavor.<br>
[0014]<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, various<br>
thickening stabilizers need not be used for the purpose of the<br>
product quality stability, whereby advantages such as<br>
reduction in the product cost and improvement in the working<br>
efficiency can be expected.<br>
Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0015]<br>
Polydextrose to be compounded with the acid milk beverage<br>
of the invention is a polysaccharide produced by polymerization<br>
of glucose, sorbitol and citric acid at high temperature and<br>
under high pressure and is a mixture ranging from a<br><br>
monosaccharide to those where molecular weights are up to<br>
scores of thousands. Commercially available polydextrose is<br>
able to be used and that having a trade name "Litesse<br>
(trademark)" (manufactured by Danisco Cultor; average<br>
molecular weight: 1,200) may be exemplified.<br>
[0016]<br>
The glucide compounded with the acid milk beverage of<br>
the invention together with the above polydextrose being<br>
selected from the group (a) (hereinafter, it may be referred<br>
to as "the glucide (a)") is at least one member selected from<br>
the group consisting of glucose, fructose, sugar, trehalose,<br>
lactose, erythritol, sorbitol, xylitol, maltitol, lactitol,<br>
palatinose and galacto-oligosaccharide and is a glucide having<br>
a relatively low (average) molecular weight among the glucides<br>
which are widely utilized for foods and drinks. Among the above,<br>
a significant effect for suppression of aggregation and<br>
precipitation of milk protein is available particularly by the<br>
use of sugar whereby such a use is preferred. When two or more<br>
glucides are used together as the glucide (a), the use of sugar<br>
as at least one of them is preferred in view of the product<br>
quality stability in the acid milk beverage.<br>
[0017]<br>
When the molecular weight of the glucide used in the<br>
invention becomes relatively high, an effect of suppression<br>
of aggregation and precipitation of milk protein in the acid<br><br>
milk beverage is not sufficiently achieved. Thus, when the<br>
above polydextrose which is a polysaccharide is solely used<br>
in the invention, it is not possible to suppress precipitation<br>
and aggregation of milk protein in the acid milk beverage.<br>
Although the reason why the resulting effect is different<br>
depending upon the type of the glucide is not clear, it is likely<br>
that the difference in molecular structure of each glucide has<br>
a different steric influence on milk protein particles in the<br>
acid milk beverage.<br>
[0018]<br>
In the invention, it is preferred to set the using amount<br>
of polydextrose and the glucide (a) at 12.0% by mass to 17.0%<br>
by mass or, preferably, 13.5% by mass to 17.0% by mass in terms<br>
of a soluble solid derived from the glucide. Particularly for<br>
the purpose of enhancing the product quality stability of the<br>
resulting acid milk beverage, it is preferred that the using<br>
amount of the glucide other than polydextrose or, in other words,<br>
the glucide (a) having a relatively low molecular weight is<br>
set at not less than 5.0% by mass or, preferably, not less than<br>
6.0% by mass. As a result, it is possible to prepare an acid<br>
milk beverage having sufficient product quality stability and<br>
good flavor without substantial use of a thickening stabilizer.<br>
It is not preferred when the soluble solid is less than 12.0%<br>
by mass since a sufficient dispersion stability of milk protein<br>
can not be obtained. On the other hand, it is not preferred<br><br>
when the above is more than 17.0% by mass since the texture<br>
becomes poor and sufficient favorite taste can not be obtained.<br>
[0019]<br>
With regard to an acid milk beverage base with which the<br>
above polydextrose and glucide (a) are compounded, there may<br>
be utilized liquid milk derived from animals and plants such<br>
as cow's milk, goat's milk, sheep's milk and soybean milk; skim<br>
milk, total milk powder or milk powder; fermented milk prepared<br>
by such a manner that milk reduced from concentrated milk either<br>
as it is or after diluting with water is subjected to a<br>
fermentation treatment using microbes such as lactic acid<br>
bacteria or bacteria of genus Bifidobacterium; beverage of a<br>
living microbe type such as milk product lactic acid bacteria<br>
beverage; milk-type beverage containing a fermented milk<br>
subjected to sterilization treatment; kefir; and a product<br>
which is made acidic by addition of an acid component such as<br>
organic acid or fruit juice to milk components.<br>
[0020]<br>
With regard to the microbe used for the production of<br>
the acid milk beverage as mentioned above when it is conducted<br>
by means of microbial fermentation, there is no particular<br>
limitation for the microbe used for the production so far as<br>
it is lactic acid bacteria or bacteria belong to genus<br>
Bifidobacterium being commonly used for the manufacture of food<br>
and its examples are bacteria belonging to genus Lactobacillus<br><br>
such as L. casei, L. acidophilus, L. helveticus, L. gasseri,<br>
L. fermentum, L. salivarius, L. yugulti, L. delbrueckii subsp.<br>
vulgaris and L. johnsonii; bacteria belonging to genus<br>
Streptococcus such as S. thermophilus; bacteria belonging to<br>
genus Lactococcus such as L. lactis subsp. lactis, L. lactis<br>
subsp. cremoris, L. plantalum and L. raffinolactis; bacteria<br>
belonging to genus Enterococcus such as E. faecalis and E.<br>
faecium; and bacteria belonging to genus Bifidobacterium such<br>
as B. breve, B. longum, B. infantis, B. adolescentis, B. bifidum,<br>
B. catenulatum, B. pseudocatenulatum, B. angulatum, B. lactis<br>
and B. animalis. The lactic acid bacteria and bacteria<br>
belonging to genus Bifidobacterium as such may be used either<br>
solely or two or more thereof may be used in combination.<br>
[0021]<br>
In the above microbial fermentation, it is also possible,<br>
in addition to the lactic acid bacteria and bacteria belonging<br>
to genus Bifidobacterium, to use other microbes such as yeasts<br>
of genus Saccharomyces, Candida, Rhodotorula, Pichia,<br>
Schizosaccharomyces, Torula and Zygosaccharomyces; and<br>
filamentous fungi of genus Aspergillus, Penicillium, Eurotium,<br>
Monascus, Mucor, Neurospora and Rhyzopus; etc. together<br>
therewith.<br>
[0022]<br>
With regard to the conditions and the fermentation<br>
methods for acting the above microbes on the material milk,<br><br><br>
those which are conventionally used for the manufacture of<br>
fermented milk may be used and there is no particular limitation<br>
therefor. For example, with regard to the fermentation<br>
condition, fermentation may be conducted at the temperature<br>
of 30 to 40°C until pH reaches 3.0 to 4.0 while, with regard<br>
to the fermentation method, a method selected from stationary<br>
fermentation, stirring fermentation, shaking fermentation,<br>
aerating fermentation, etc. suitable for the microbe used for<br>
the fermentation may be used.<br>
[0023]<br>
In the invention, fermented milk prepared by a microbial<br>
fermentation in a stationary state is used whereby an effect<br>
of product quality stability can be significantly achieved even<br>
if substantially no stabilizer is used provided that<br>
polydextrose and the glucide (a) are used together as mentioned<br>
later.<br>
[0024]<br>
On the other hand, an acid component may be added to a<br>
milk material and the pH is adjusted to 3.0 to 4.0 when the<br>
above acid milk beverage is produced using an acid component.<br>
Examples of the substance which is able to be used as an acid<br>
component are lactic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, malic<br>
acid, acetic acid, etc. as well as fruit juice of lemon,<br>
grapefruit, lime, orange, strawberry, blueberry, peach, grape,<br>
apple, etc. Two or more thereof may be used in combination.<br><br><br>
[0025]<br>
A water-soluble calcium source which is other than the<br>
calcium derived from milk materials may be also compounded with<br>
the acid milk beverage of the invention as an optional component.<br>
Examples of the water-soluble calcium source are calcium<br>
lactate, calcium gluconate, calcium chloride and calcium<br>
phosphate which are approved as food additives. Such a source<br>
is able to be used without any particular limitation. Amount<br>
of the calcium source as such in the acid milk beverage of the<br>
invention is about 0.01% by mass to 0.06% by mass or, preferably,<br>
0.01% by mass to 0.05% by mass in terms of the amount of calcium.<br>
[0026]<br>
It has been well known that, when a calcium source is<br>
compounded in an acid milk beverage, the added calcium source<br>
is usually aggregated with the milk protein and that is a cause<br>
of deterioration of quality of the product. In order to improve<br>
that, various proposals have been made already for a technique<br>
of compounding a calcium source with an acid milk beverage.<br>
Specific examples thereof are a method where pectin is used<br>
in an acid milk beverage containing calcium (JP-A-08-056567,<br>
JP-A-08-112058 and JP-A-08-112059) and a method where soybean<br>
diet fiber (soybean polysaccharide) is used therein<br>
(JP-A-10-004876 and JP-A-2004-283182).<br>
[0027]<br>
However, in the prior art as such, deterioration of the<br><br><br>
product quality by addition of a calcium source in an acid milk<br>
beverage is prevented by compounding of a thickening stabilizer<br>
such as pectin or soybean dietary fiber so that aggregation<br>
of milk protein is positively prevented. This is clearly<br>
different from the acid milk beverage of the invention where,<br>
even when a calcium source is compounded, an excellent effect<br>
of the product quality stability can be achieved with the use<br>
of substantially no thickening stabilizer whereby the acid milk<br>
beverage of the invention is very useful as compared with the<br>
conventional art.<br>
[0028]<br>
Production of the acid milk beverage of the invention<br>
may be carried out in accordance with the conventional process<br>
for the production of acid milk beverages except that the<br>
above-mentioned polydextrose, glucide (a) and, if necessary,<br>
a calcium source are compounded with an acid milk beverage which<br>
is a base. There is no particular limitation for the<br>
compounding time and compounding method of polydextrose,<br>
glucide (a) and calcium source but they may be added in any<br>
stage of the production process for an acid milk beverage which<br>
is a base. For example, a syrup containing predetermined<br>
amounts of polydextrose, glucide and a calcium source is<br>
prepared and is compounded with a solution prepared by the<br>
action of a microbe on a milk material. Preparation of the<br>
syrup may be carried out according to a conventional method.<br><br><br>
For example, polydextrose, glucide, etc. are dissolved in water<br>
heated at not lower than 70°C and subjected to plate<br>
sterilization at 112°C for 10 seconds.<br>
[0029]<br>
Besides the above polydextrose, glucide (a) and calcium<br>
source, it is also possible to compound a food material which<br>
is usually compounded with various food/beverage within such<br>
an extent that the effect achieved by the invention is not<br>
deteriorated. Examples of the food material as such are a<br>
highly sweet sweetener such as aspartame, thaumatin, sucralose,<br>
acesulfame K and stevia; an emulsifier such as sugar fatty acid<br>
ester, glycerol fatty acid ester, polyglycerol fatty acid ester,<br>
sorbitan fatty acid ester and lecithin; milk fat such as cream,<br>
butter and sour cream; an acidulant such as citric acid, lactic<br>
acid, acetic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid and gluconic acid;<br>
vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin B substances, vitamin C<br>
and vitamin E substances; minerals such as magnesium, zinc,<br>
iron and manganese; and flavor of yogurt type, berry type,<br>
orange type, Chinese quince type, perilla type, citrus type,<br>
apple type, mint type, grape type, apricot type, pear, custard<br>
cream, peach, melon, banana, tropical, herb type, black tea<br>
and coffee type.<br>
[0030]<br>
In the acid milk beverage which is prepared as such, it<br>
is now possible to significantly prevent and improve the<br><br><br>
quality deterioration such as aggregation and precipitation<br>
of milk protein without the use of a thickening stabilizer such<br>
as pectin and soybean dietary fiber even when its calorie is<br>
reduced to an extent of, for example, not higher than 50<br>
Kcal/100 ml or, preferably, from 20 Kcal/100 ml to 50 Kcal/100<br>
ml.<br>
Examples<br>
[0031]<br>
The invention will now be illustrated in more detail by<br>
way of the following Test Examples and Examples although the<br>
invention is not restricted by those examples at all.<br>
[0032]<br>
Test Example 1<br>
Production of acid milk beverages:<br>
An aqueous solution in which 14.9% by mass of skim milk<br>
and 3.5% by mass of glucose were dissolved was subjected to<br>
plate sterilization at 121°C for 3 seconds and inoculated with<br>
a Lactobacillus casei starter and incubation was conducted<br>
until the pH reached 3. 6 followed by cooling to give a fermented<br>
product. After that, the fermented product was homogenized<br>
at 15 MPa and 23 parts by weight thereof was mixed with 77 parts<br>
by weight of each of the syrups shown in Table 1 to give the<br>
test products 1 to 3. The syrups were prepared by dissolving<br>
the components shown in Table 1 in water, subjecting to plate<br><br><br><br>
sterilization at 112°C for 10 seconds and cooling.<br>
[0033]<br>
Amount of the PD used was calculated on the basis of solid;<br>
the unit is in % by mass.<br>

It will be apparent from the result of Table 2 that, in<br>
the test product 1 where only polydextrose (PD) was contained,<br>
both flavor and properties were bad and, in the test products<br>
2 and 3 where a thickening stabilizer such as pectin or<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) was compounded, although an<br>
improving effect to properties was noted, texture<br>
(palatability and feel on the tongue) tended to be bad.<br>
[0040]<br>
Example 1<br>
Production of acid milk beverages (1):<br>
An aqueous solution in which 14.9% by mass of skim milk<br><br>
and 3.5% by mass of glucose were dissolved was subjected to<br>
plate sterilization at 121°C for 3 seconds and inoculated with<br>
a Lactobacillus casei starter and incubation was conducted<br>
until the pH reached 3.6 followed by cooling to give a fermented<br>
product. After that, the fermented product was homogenized<br>
at 15 MPa and 23 parts by weight thereof was mixed with 77 parts<br>
by weight of each of the syrups which were prepared separately<br>
to give the products 1 to 12 of the invention and the comparative<br>
products 1 and 2. The syrups were prepared by dissolving the<br>
components shown in Table 3 in water, subjecting to plate<br>
sterilization at 112°C for 10 seconds and cooling.<br>
[0041]<br><br><br><br><br>
[0042]<br>
Appearance, precipitation, separation of whey<br>
and flavor of the products 1 to 12 of the invention and<br>
the comparative products 1 and 2 immediately after<br>
manufacture and after storing at 10°C for 14 days were<br>
evaluated respectively, according to the criteria<br>
mentioned in Test Example 1. The result is shown in<br>
Table 4.<br>
[0043]<br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0044]<br>
It is apparent from the result of Table 4 that, in the<br>
acid milk beverages prepared by the combined use of<br>
polydextrose (PD) and various glucides, the same product<br>
quality stabilization effect as in the case of Comparative<br>
Product 1 where pectin was used as a thickening stabilizer was<br>
obtained and the flavor was also good. In the Comparative<br>
Product 2 where a hardly-digestible dextrin was used as a<br>
polysaccharide, the same product quality stabilization effect<br>
as in the use of polydextrose was not obtained even when<br>
glucides are used together. Among the glucides used in<br>
combination with polydextrose, sugar was found to be most<br>
useful.<br>
[0045]<br>
Example 2<br>
Production of acid milk beverages (2):<br>
An aqueous solution in which 14.9% by mass of skim milk<br>
and 3.5% by mass of glucose were dissolved was subjected to<br>
plate sterilization at 121°C for 3 seconds and inoculated with<br>
a Lactobacillus casei starter and incubation was conducted<br>
until the pH reached 3. 6 followed by cooling to give a fermented<br>
product. After that, the fermented product was homogenized<br>
at 15 MPa and 23 parts by weight thereof was mixed with 77 parts<br>
by weight of each of the syrups which were prepared separately<br>
in the compositions shown in Table 5 to give the products 1<br><br><br>
to 6. The syrups were prepared by dissolving the components<br>
in water, subjecting to plate sterilization at 112°C for 10<br>
seconds and cooling.<br>
[0046]<br><br>
basis of solids; the unit was % by mass.<br>
[0047]<br>
Appearance, precipitation, separation of whey and flavor<br>
of the products 1 to 6 immediately after manufacture and after<br>
storing at 10°C for 14 days were evaluated respectively,<br>
according to the criteria mentioned in Test Example 1. The<br>
result is shown in Table 6.<br>
[0048]<br><br><br>
[0049]<br>
It is apparent from the result of Table 6 that, in the<br>
acid milk beverages prepared by the combined use of <br>
polydextrose and various glucides, there was a tendency that,<br>
as compared with the products 3 to 6 where the soluble solid<br>
derived from the glucides except polydextrose was not less than<br>
5.0% by mass, much precipitation and separation of whey were<br>
noted and stability was inferior when said soluble solid was<br>
less than 5.0% by mass as in the case of the products 1 and<br>
2 even if the soluble solid derived from the glucides therein<br>
was in the same amount. In the product 6 where no highly sweet<br>
sweetener was used, acidity and sweetness were unbalanced and<br><br>
the flavor was inferior.<br>
[0050]<br>
Example 3<br>
Production of acid milk beverages (3):<br>
An aqueous solution in which 14.9% by mass of skim milk<br>
and 3.5% by mass of glucose were dissolved was subjected to<br>
plate sterilization at 121°C for 3 seconds and inoculated with<br>
a Lactobacillus casei starter and incubation was conducted<br>
until the pH reached 3.6 followed by cooling to give a fermented<br>
product. After that, the fermented product was homogenized<br>
at 15 MPa and 23 parts by weight thereof was mixed with 77 parts<br>
by weight of each of the syrups which were prepared according<br>
to the compositions of Table 7 separately to give the products<br>
7 to 14 where the amounts of the soluble solid were different.<br>
The syrups were prepared by dissolving the components in water,<br>
subjecting to plate sterilization at 112°C for 10 seconds and<br>
cooling.<br><br>
basis of solids; unit was % by mass.<br>
[0051]<br><br>
[0052]<br>
Appearance, precipitation, separation of whey<br>
and flavor of the products 7 to 14 immediately after<br>
manufacture and after storing at 10°C for 14 days were<br>
evaluated respectively, according to the criteria<br>
mentioned in Test Example 1. The result is shown in<br>
Table 8.<br>
[0053]<br><br><br><br>
[0054]<br>
It is apparent from the result of Table 8 that, in the<br>
acid milk beverages prepared by the combined use of<br>
polydextrose and various glucides, there was a tendency of much<br>
precipitation and separation of whey and stability was inferior<br>
when the total amount of the soluble solid derived from the<br>
glucides except polydextrose was less than 12.0% by mass as<br>
in the case of the products 7 and 8 even if the soluble solid<br>
derived from the glucides except polydextrose therein was in<br>
the same amount. There was also a tendency that, when the total<br>
amount of the soluble solid is not less than 18.0% by mass as<br>
in the case of the products 13 and 14, although there is no<br>
problem in terms of the product quality stability, feeling upon<br>
drinking is heavy resulting in a flavor being different from<br>
the image of a low-calorie product whereby the palate was<br>
inferior.<br>
[0055]<br>
Example 4<br>
Production of acid milk beverages (4):<br>
An aqueous solution in which 14.9% by mass of skim milk<br>
and 3.5% by mass of glucose were dissolved was subjected to<br>
plate sterilization at 121°C for 3 seconds and inoculated with<br>
a Lactobacillus casei starter and incubation was conducted<br>
until the pH reached 3.6 followed by cooling to give a fermented<br>
product. After that, the fermented product was homogenized<br><br>
(15 MPa) and 23 parts by weight thereof was mixed with 77 parts<br>
by weight of each of the syrups which were prepared according to<br>
the compositions of Table 9 separately to give the products 15<br>
to 23 where the amounts of the soluble solid were different.<br>
The syrups were prepared by dissolving the components in water,<br>
subjecting to plate sterilization at 112°C for 10 seconds and<br>
cooling.<br>
[0056]<br><br>
the basis of solids; unit was % by mass.<br>
[0057]<br>
Appearance, precipitation, separation of whey and<br>
flavor of the products 15 to 23 being immediately after<br>
manufacture and also after storing at 10°C for 14 days were<br>
evaluated according to the criteria mentioned in Test<br>
Example 1. The result is shown in Table 10.<br>
[0058]<br><br><br><br>
[0059] It is apparent from the result of Table 10 that,<br>
in the acid milk beverages prepared by the combined use<br>
of polydextrose (PD) and various glucides, there was a<br>
tendency that stability was significantly deteriorated<br>
by addition of water-soluble calcium when the soluble<br>
solid derived from the glucides except polydextrose was<br>
less than 5.0% by mass as in the case of the products 15<br>
to 17 even if the total amount of the soluble solid<br>
derived from the glucides except polydextrose therein<br>
was in the same amount while, when the soluble solid<br>
derived from the glucides except polydextrose was not<br>
less than 5.0% by mass as in the case of the products 18<br>
to 23, lowering in stability by addition of calcium was<br>
suppressed and, further, if the added amount of calcium<br>
was by 0.06% by mass, commercial value was not<br>
deteriorated even after the storage.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>

polydextrose and specific glucides are contained therein<br>
for satisfying the predetermined conditions whereupon it<br>
is now possible to easily produce an acid milk beverage<br>
of a low-calorie type having a good flavor even when<br>
various thickening stabilizers which are usually used<br>
for achieving the stabilization of product quality of an<br>
acid milk beverage are not substantially contained.<br><br>
