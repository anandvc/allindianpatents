TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]       This invention relates to agents for the treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorders and methods for their preparation and use.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]       Gastrointestinal ("GI") motility regulates the orderly movement of ingested material through the gut to ensure adequate absorption of nutrients, electrolytes, and fluids. Proper transit of the GI contents through the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and colon depends on regional control of intraluminal pressure and several sphincters, which regulate their forward movement and prevent back-flow. The normal GI motility pattern may be impaired by a variety of circumstances, including disease and surgery.<br>
[0003]       GI motility disorders include gastroparesis and gastroesophageal reflux disease ("GERD"). Gastroparesis, whose symptoms include stomach upset, heartburn, nausea, and vomiting, is the delayed emptying of stomach contents. GERD refers to the varied clinical manifestations of the reflux of stomach and duodenal contents into the esophagus. The most common symptoms are heartburn and dysphasia, with blood loss from esophageal erosion also known to occur. Other examples of GI disorders hi which unpaired GI motility is implicated include anorexia, gall bladder stasis, posTOFerative paralytic ileus, scleroderma, intestinal pseudoobstruction, irritable bowel syndrome, gastritis, emesis, and chronic constipation (colonic inertia).<br>
[0004]       Motilin is a 22-amino acid peptide hormone secreted by endocrine cells hi the intestinal mucosa. Its binding to the motilin receptor in the GI tract stimulates GI motility. The administration of therapeutic agents that act as motilin agonists ("prokinetic agents") has been proposed as a treatment for GI disorders.<br>
[0005]       The erythromycins are a family of macrolide antibiotics made by the fermentation of the Actinomycetes Saccharopolyspora erythraea. Erythromycin A, a commonly used antibiotic, is the most abundant and important member of the family. (In the erythromycins, the 16-member lactone ring is referred to as the macrolactone <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or aglycone<br>
portion ol the molecule and the glycosidic residues pendant from the carbon at positions 3 and 5 are referred to as the cladinose and desosamine residues, respectively.) 0<br>
 [0006]       The side effects of erythromycin A include nausea, vomiting;, and abdominal discomfort. These effects have been traced to motilin agonist activity in erythromycin A (1) and, more so, its initial acid-catalyzed degradation product (5). (The secondary degradation product, spiroketal (6), is inactive.)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
[0007]       Spurred by the discovery of motilin agonist activity in erythromycin A and degradation product 5, researchers have endeavored to discover new motilides, as macrolides with prokinetic activity are called. Much of the research has centered on generating new erythromycin analogs, either via post-fermentation chemical transformation of a naturally<br>
produced erythromycin or via modification (including genetic engineering) of the fermentation process.

(Structure Removed)<br>
 [0058]       Those skilled in the art will understand that a number of parameters are relevant to the development of motilides. Firstly, the evolution of the erythromycin scaffold in the natural producing organisms has been driven by antibacterial efficacy and not by prokinetic efficacy. Therefore, considerable room remains for optimization of the structure-activity relationship for motilin agonist activity. Secondly, it is in fact undesirable for a motilide to possess antibacterial activity. The GI tract is host to a large population of bacteria, whose exposure to a motilide having antibacterial activity may induce the development in them of resistance to erythromycin antibiotics. Or, a motilide having anti-bacterial activity may kill beneficial gut bacteria. Thus, a motilide desirably has enhanced prokinetic activity engineered in and antibacterial activity engineered out. Thirdly, a drawback commonly found among motilides evaluated to date is their propensity to desensitize the motilide receptor, meaning that, after the initial dose, subsequent doses of a motilide elicit a weaker or no response (tachyphylaxis). Fourthly, stability and bioavailability are concerns — witness the ready degradation of erythromycin A in the stomach and the lack of activity of its secondary degradation product. Fifthly, some compounds in the erythromycin family have been reported to have undesirable pro-arrhythmic effects, including the prolongation of the QT interval and the induction of ventricular arrhythmias. Limiting these effects to an acceptable level is desirable. Thus, there exists a continuing need to develop new motilides, balancing the various different performance requirements.<br>
[0059]       In addition to the foregoing factors, bioavailability is a factor to be considered. Desirably, a prokinetic agent has rapid bioavailability, enabling it to be taken by a patient<br>
shortly before a meal, as opposed to hours before — an advantage in inducing patient compliance. Further, the prokinetic agent should not persist, but, rather, be rapidly cleared out of the system once it has performed its intended function, i.e., have a short half-life.<br>
[0060]       Another aspect of the present invention provides methods for the use of compounds of this invention in the treatment of impaired gastric motility. In general, methods of using the compounds of the present invention comprise administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention.

[0064]        The practice of this invention can be further understood by reference to the following examples, which are provided by way of illustration and not of limitation.<br>
Example 1 — Synthesis of Intermediate 9<br>
[0065]       Intermediate 9 (N-desmethyl-N-isopropyl-(9S)-dihydroerythromycin A), used in the synthesis of several compounds of this invention, was synthesized as follows. Intermediate 9 has also been described in Santi et al, US 2004/0138150 Al (2004), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [0066]       (9S)-Dihydroerythromycin A (7). Erythromycin A (1) (20.0 g, 27.3 mmol) was dissolved in 2-propanol-ether (1:1 V/V, 400 mL), and cooled to 0 °C, sodium borohydride (2.1 g, 54.5 mmol) was added in two aliquots. The mixture was then warmed to room temperature ("RT") and stirred at RT for 3 h. The excess borohydride was destroyed by addition of pH 6.0 phosphate buffer; then triethanolamine (80 mL) was added. After 2 h stirring the mixture was extracted with EtOAc (300ml x 4), dried over MgSO4. The crude was purified by silica gel chromatography using 2: 1 hexane-acetone with 1% triethylamine, pure product 7 (17.2 g, 86% yield) was obtained.<br>
[0067]       Alternatively, the following procedure can be used: A 10-liter three-neck round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and internal thermocouple probe was charged with methyl t-buryl ether (2,400 mL) and erythromycin A (400 g, 545 mmol, 1.0 eq.). To this suspension was added MeOH (800 mL). The solution was stirred until became clear (ca. 5-15 min). The solution was cooled with an ice bath to an internal temperature of 2 °C. Solid NaBHU (30.9 g, 816 mmol, 1.5 eq.) was then added in one portion. The resulting suspension was stirred at 0 °C for 1 h, during which time the solution remained clear. After 1 h at 0 °C the ice bath was removed. The mixture was allowed to warm up to 22 °C and stirred for another 3 h. The mixture gradually became opaque. The reaction was complete as monitored by TLC (10% MeOH in CH2C12, Silica Gel 60F plates pre-treated with ammonia to neutralize any acidity in the silica gel). Excess NaBHU was destroyed by careful addition of acetone (120 mL; exothermic reaction: acetone added at a rate to maintain an internal temperature of less than 30 °C) and phosphate buffer (5%, pH 6.0, 120 mL). The reaction turned to a clear solution with some white precipitate. Triethanolamine (400 mL) was added to help decompose the erythromycin-boron complex and the solution was stirred for 1 h. After adding saturated NaHCO3 solution (3,200 mL), the mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3 x 2,000 mL). The combined extracts were washed once with water and once with brine (2,000 mL each), dried over solid Na2SC&gt;4. After removal of solvent, the crude product was dried in a vacuum oven (16 h, 50 °C). A white solid was obtained (416 g, mp 182-185 °C), which was suitable for use in the next step without further purification.<br>
[0068]       N-Desmethvl-(9S)-dihydroerythromycin A (8). A mixture of (9S)-dihydroery-thromycin A 7 (17.2 g, 23.4 mmol) and sodium acetate (9.75 g, 119 mmol) in methanol-water (8:2 V/V, 400 mL) was stirred at 50 °C. Iodine (7.25 g, 28.6 mmol) was then added in two aliquots in 30 min interval. During the reaction 3N NaOH (7.9 mL) was added in small portions. Complete reaction was determined by thin-layer chromatographic analysis. After removal of the majority of solvent the mixture was extracted three times with EtOAc and dried over Na2SO4. Crude product 8 (15.6 g) was obtained as a yellow solid, which was used for next step without further purification.<br>
[0069]        The following alternative procedure can be used: A six-liter three-neck round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and internal thermocouple probe was charged with MeOH (2,000 mL), compound 7 from the previous example (150 g,<br>
theoretically 197 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (119 g, 5 eq.). The mixture was warmed to 55 °C internal temperature, during which all the materials dissolved. Iodine (75 g, 1.5 eq.) was carefully added, at a rate to prevent the slightly exothermic reaction from raising the internal temperature above 60 °C. The mixture was stirred at 55 °C for 5 h. TLC (15% MeOH in CH.2Cl2, silica gel plate as described above) indicated completion of the reaction. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. Saturated sodium thiosulfate was used to destroy any excess iodine until the iodine color all disappeared. The mixture was concentrated by removal of about half of the MeOH, taking care to not remove too much of it — this causes precipitation of the product when aqueous solution is subsequently added, the precipitate being difficult to dissolve in the following extractions. The concentrate was diluted with aqueous NaHCO3 (1,500 mL) and extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 x 1,000 mL). The combined organic layers were washed once with water (1,500 mL) before drying over Na2SO4. The crude product 8 (113 g, mp 118-123 °C) was obtained after removal of solvent and drying in a vacuum oven (16 h, 50 °C). This material was suitable for use in subsequent synthetic procedures without further purification.<br>
[0070]       Intermediate 9. A mixture of the above crude product 8 (2.50 g, 3.41 mmol), diisopropylethylamine (6.1 mL, 10 equiv), 2-iodopropane (10.2 mL, 30 equiv) in CH3CN (50 mL) was heated in a 70 °C bath for 24 h. H20 and saturated NaHCO3 were added, the solution was extracted three times with EtOAc, dried over MgSO4. The crude product was purified with Si02 column (3:1 hexane-acetone, 1% TEA) to give pure product 9 (1.80 g, 75% yield for 2 steps), m/z: 765.0 ([M + H]+).<br>
[0071]       The following alternative procedure for the preparation of intermediate 9 can be used: In a one-liter three neck round bottom flask a solution of product 8 (30 g, 41.5 mmol, 1.0 eq) hi MeOH (150 mL) and acetone (30 mL) was stirred with a magnetic stirrer. Acetic acid (3.5 mL, 62.2 mmol, 1.5 eq), followed by NACNBH3 (5.25 g, 83.3 mmol, 2 eq) were added. The solution was heated with an oil bath and stirred at 50 °C bath temperature for 4 h. A complete reaction was observed as monitored by TLC (1:1 hexane-acetone). After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, phosphate buffer (5%, pH 6.0, 60 mL) was added carefully (rapid H2 evolution) to quench the excess borohydride. Triethanolamine (100 mL) was then added. The mixture was stirred at RT for 1 hour. The solution was poured into saturated NaHCO3 solution (500 mL) and the resulting mixture was extracted with EtOAc (2<br>
x 800 mL). The combined extracts were washed once with brine (600 mL), dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. Crude product (31.8 g) was obtained as white solid after drying under high vacuum for 16 h. Depending on the purity of the precursor product 8, purification prior to subsequent use was or was not needed. If purification was needed, the crude intermediate 9 was dissolved in acetonitrile (100 mL) with heating, followed by addition of water (100 mL) dropwise, with continued heating, until cloudy. The cloudy mixture was allowed to cool to RT, filtered, and vacuum dried at 50 °C for 16 h. This provided pure intermediate 9 (19 g, 24.9 mmol, 47% yield from erythromycin A, mp 127-130 °C) as a white solid.<br>
Example 2 — Synthesis of Compounds from Intermediate 9<br>
[0072]        Compound A-l. Sodium hydride (60% dispersion in mineral oil, 12.5 rug) was placed in a dry flask, washed once with pentane (5 mL) and suspended in dimethoxyethane (2 mL). To this suspension a solution of intermediate 9 (200 mg, 0.262 mmol) in dimethoxyethane (2 mL) was added. After stirring at RT for 10 min methyl iodide (2M in t-butyl methyl ether, 0.16 mL) in dimethoxyethane (1 mL) was added. The mixture was stirred at RT overnight. The reaction was quenched by adding saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution, extracted three times with CH2Cl2, and dried over MgSO4. The crude product was purified with a silica gel column (4:1 hexanes-acetone, 1% triethylamine) to give compound A-l (130 mg) as a white solid, m/z: 779.0 ([M + H]+); ESI TOF MS m/z 778.531 1, calcd for C40H76NO13  ([M + H]+) 778.5340.<br>

[0077]        Compound A-12. To a solution of intermediate 9 (276 mg, 0.362 mmol) and bromoacetamide (60 mg, 0.435 mmol, 1.2 eq) in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (4 mL) was added KOtBu (1.0 M in THF, 0.54 mL, 1.5 eq). The resulting cloudy mixture was stirred at RT for 3 h, then diluted with EtOAc (50 mL) and NaHCO3 solution (10 mL). The organic phase was washed with brine (10 mL) and the aqueous phase was extracted with EtOAc (2x10 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (10% to 95% of acetone in hexanes, with 1% triethylamine) to yield compound A-12 (220 mg, 73%) as a white solid, m/z: 822.0 ([M + H]+); ESI TOF MS m/z 821.5385, calcd for C41H77N2O14 ([M + H]+) 821.5369.<br>

[0083]       The following alternative procedure can be used: In a five-liter three neck round bottom flask equipped with mechanical stirrer and internal thermocouple temperature probe a solution of intermediate 9 (156.7 g, 205 mmol), N-methyl bromoacetamide (37.4 g, 246 mmol, 1.2 eq) in dry THF (1800 mL) was cooled with an ice bath. With stirring at 0 °C internal temperature under nitrogen, solid potassium tert-butoxide (25.3 g, 226 mmol, 1.1 eq) was added as one batch. The mixture was stirred at 0 °C for Ih. Completion of the reaction was monitored by TLC (1:2 hexane-acetone, silica gel 60 F, ammonia pre-treated). The reaction mixture was quenched by adding saturated NaHCO3 solution (300 mL). The mixture was partitioned between dilute NaHCO3 solution (2,500 mL) and EtOAc (1,500 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 1500 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4. Crude product (178.1 g) was obtained as slightly yellow solid, which was then purified with silica gel column (2,800 g Silica Gel 60 F, 20-40% acetone hi hexane, 1% triethylamine) to give compound A-21 (135 g, 79% yield). To remove traces of solvents and triethylamine, the product was repeatedly dissolved in dichloromethane and dried in a rotary evaporator (4 cycles) and dried in a vacuum oven (16 h, 50 °C) to give the final product (mp 106-108 °C).<br>

mmol, 1.0 eq) was added dropwise, with stirring. After the addition the dry ice bath was removed. The mixture was warmed up to room temperature. The resulting yellow suspension was quenched with saturated NaHCO3 (3200 mL), and extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 3,200 mL). The combined organics were washed with saturated ammonium chloride (2,000 mL), and brine (2,000 mL), dried over Na2S04. After concentration under vacuum the red colored crude product (82 g) was dissolved in GH2Cl2 (100 mL) and passed through a pad of silica (1,600 g), eluting with 50% ethyl acetate/hexane.

[0165]       Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the foregoing synthetic techniques can be applied, mutatis mutandis, to make other compounds of this invention, including those wherein Rc, RD, RE, and RF are other than OH, Me, OH, and H, respectively, using alter-<br>
 native known and/or commercially available precursor materials. Compounds in which RF is Me can be made from clarithromycin (6-0-methylerythromycin A, Biaxin™; Watanabe et al, US 4,331,803 (1982)). Compounds wherein Rc and RD are other than OH and Me, respectively, can be made using as precursors erythromycins B, C, or D.

Example 19 — Tissue Based Assay for Motilin Agonist Potency<br>
[0166]       The motilin agonist potencies of compounds of this invention were evaluated using a tissue based assay, using rabbit duodenum tissue-based contractility assay, generally following the procedure of Depoortere et al.,J. Gastrointestinal Motility, 1, 150-159 (1989), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, this method measures the ability of a compound to induce contractions in rabbit duodenal tissue, a motilin receptor-bearing tissue contractilely responsive to motilin.<br>
[0167]       Strips of rabbit duodenum were tested and qualified for use in the assay by as follows. Segments of rabbit duodenum, 20-30 cm distal to the pylorus were split longitudinally. The mucosa was removed and 2x2x15 mm strips of longitudinal smooth muscle were sliced from the segments. The strips were bathed in oxygenated Krebs solution at 37°C, with 1.5 g of tension, and contractions measured auxotonically. Strips exhibiting strong, regular phasic activity (amplitude 0.3 g, FFT peak at 0.3-0.4 Hz, &gt; 3-fold stronger than other peaks), and prompt, reproducible responses to 1 µM carbachol ("CCH") (peak contraction in 3x phasic amplitude) were qualified for use in the assay; strips not meeting the foregoing criteria were discarded.<br>
[0168]       The carbachol was then washed away by changing the organ bath buffer twice. The strips were washed again 20±5 minutes following the carbachol contraction. Following this last wash a dose response study was initiated within 10±5 min. Each compound tested was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to a final concentration of 10 mM. A series of seven 10X serial dilutions in water was prepared, so that the concentration of the seventh serial dilution was 1.0 x 10"6 mM. The first through fifth serial dilutions of the compound were applied, starting with 200 µL of the most dilute solution. After each application, there was a wait of 2±0.5 min, until the response was stable, before the application of the next dose (the next higher concentration serial dilution). The dose was increased in 10-fold<br>
increments until a small response was observed. Subsequent doses were the increased in 2-to 5-fold increments, until the maximum response was obtained. At 2±0.5 min after the last drug addition, the strips were dosed with 1 µM carbachol.<br>
[0169]       The EC50 (concentration producing a half-maximal effect) was calculated as follows. The basal tension was subtracted from the compound-induced tension for each reading. The data points were normalized against the response obtained from 1 µM carbachol at the end of the experiment. The concentration of compound was plotted against the response and fitted to the following equation:<br>
R = (Rmax .C)/(EC50 + C)<br>
where R is the contraction response, Rmax is the maximal contraction response, and C is the concentration of compound. Both R and Rmax are expressed as a fraction of the 1 µM carbachol contraction and range from 0 to 1. Results are reported in Table B, below.<br>
[0170]       Optionally an EC90 (concentration producing 90% of the maximal effect) could be estimated and verified as follows: EC90 was initially approximated as ten times EC50. The accuracy of this approximation was then verified by a dose response curve. Qualified duodenum strips were dosed at 0.25 • EC90. After a maximal response was obtained (2±0.5 min), the dose was increased four-fold. After 2±0.5 min, the strips were dosed with 1 uM carbachol. The difference between the two doses should be in the range of 10-20%. A second set of qualified duodenum strips was dosed at EC90- After a maximal response was obtained (2±0.5 min), the dose was increased two-fold. After 2 ± 0.5 min, the strips were dosed with 1 uM carbachol. There should be less than 10% difference between the two doses.<br>
[0171]       Thus, compounds of this invention can be used to induce the contraction of motilin receptor bearing tissue that is contractilely responsive to motilin. The induction of such contractions can have beneficial effects in stimulating GI motility. The tissue can be mammalian tissue such as rabbit or human tissue, especially GI tissue.<br>
Example 20 — Evaluation of Antibacterial Activity<br>
[0172]       The antibacterial activities of compounds of this invention were evaluated by measuring their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against Streptococcus pneumonias ATCC 6301 (an erythromycin A sensitive strain), using serial dilutions on 96-<br><br>
well microtiter plates. Deskably, the compounds have low antibacterial activity. Results are reported in Table B, below.<br>
[0173]       Table B below summarizes data for compounds of this invention. Comparative data for erythromycin A, ABT-229, GM-611, and KC-11458 are also presented. The last three compounds are developmental motilides from Abbott Laboratories, Chugai, and Solvay, respectively.<br>

Example 21 — Chronic Dosing Model for Evaluating Tachyphylaxis<br>
[0174]       This example describes how tachyphylaxis (decrement in response after an initial administration; in effect a desensitization to the agonist effect of the compound) of compounds of this invention can be evaluated.<br>
[0175]       Rabbit duodenum strips are qualified as described above and dosed with test compound at its EC90 concentration. The contraction is recorded. When peak contractile force is reached, carbachol (1 µM) is added, and any further contraction is recorded. The resulting contraction are expressed as a fraction of the 1 µM carbachol contraction. The test compound and carbachol are washed away by changing the bath solution twice. The procedure is repeated at 30, 60, and 90 min following the initial dosing. Tachyphylaxis is quantitated as the percentage of the initial contraction retained after the fourth dose of the compound being tested. A compound exhibiting low tachyphylaxis will have a high value.<br>
Tachyphylaxis = 100% x (Contraction after 4th dose)/(Contraction after initial dose)<br>
Example 22 — hERG Channel Inhibition<br>
[0176]       The pro-arrhythmic effects of erythromycin and related compounds have been attributed to their inhibition of the hERG (human ether-a-go-go related gene) potassium channel. The hERG channel inhibitory effects of compounds of this invention can be evaluated using the technique reported in Stanat et al, Mol. Cellular Biochem., 2003,254, 1-<br>
7, "Characterization of the Inhibitory Effects of Erythromycin and Clarithromycin on the HERG Potassium Channel". Inhibition may be expressed as % inhibition at 30 µM concentration of the compound being tested. Desirably, compounds have a low % inhibition.<br>
