				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a data processing system with a<br>
reconfigurable logic circuit region.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Devices called FPGAs (Field Programmabte Gate Arrays), PLDs<br>
(Programmable Logic Devices), and PLAs (Programmable Logic Arrays)<br>
are known as programmable devices where circuits can be reconfigured.<br>
Such programmable devices are fundamentally constructed by disposing<br>
units called logic cells or logic units in a lattice and disposing sets of<br>
wires so as to surround such units, with it being possible to change the<br>
functions of the logic cells or the connections of the wires based on<br>
information called context information or configuration information.<br>
As one example of a technique for implementing parts of a logic<br>
circuit in FPGAs, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2000-40745<br>
discloses a technique where an initial netiist that characterizes a logic<br>
circuit is divided into many pages and circuits for one of such pages are<br>
configured in an FPGA. By doing so, this technique aims to configure a<br>
much larger circuit than the physical capacity of the FPGA.<br>
At present, system LSIs, which are mounted in multimedia<br>
devices, mobile devices, digital devices, and the like and execute much<br>
of the data processing of such devices, include a plurality of circuit units<br>
for realizing specific or dedicated functions (in many cases, such circuit<br>
units are called "hardware modules", WIP" (Intellectual Property) or<br>
"libraries") mounted on a single chip and such hardware modules carry<br>
out processing in parallel. Accordingly, if only a circuit is simply<br>
implemented in an FPGA using dividing, the ability of devices with<br>
reconfigure circuits has no great effect.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
One of provisions of the present invention is a technique for<br>
dynamically optimizing a hardware space for executing one or more<br>
applications or when executing one or more applications. The present<br>
invention provides a data processing system, for example, an LSI, with<br>
architecture capable of obtaining and directly executing information that<br>
is not just conventional software information such as a program that is a<br>
group of instruction sets produced by compiler translation, but is also<br>
hardware information on the circuit itself that is to execute the<br>
application.<br>
In conventional techniques for circuit devices as represented by<br>
system LSIs, circuits realized by hardware are installed as fixed<br>
hardware in units called "special-purpose hardware modules", "IP", and<br>
"libraries", with data being processed by a dedicated LSI constructed by<br>
such circuits. On the other hand, there are also techniques that<br>
performs as dedicated hardware circuits using a general-purpose circuit<br>
or architecture. One example is a simulator, where a general-purpose<br>
apparatus such as a CPU is given the role of executing the instructions in<br>
a program one by one to simulate an actual circuit. Here, even if a<br>
plurality of CPUs are used to convert the parallelism of a circuit realized<br>
by hardware into processing in units of instruction to be carried out<br>
using the CPUs, depending on the scale of the circuit being simulated,<br>
execution will take 1000 to 100,000 times longer than the time taken by<br>
an actual hardware circuit. Since real-time processing is also<br>
impossible, a great deal of testing time is required to simulate a complex<br>
circuit. For this reason, not only is it impossible to carry out processing<br>
in place of a modern special-purpose or dedicated LSI that has a huge<br>
number of gates, it is also becoming increasingly difficult to test the<br>
functions of complex dedicated LSIs.<br>
In response to the problem of real-time performance, a method<br>
called "hardware acceleration" is known. According to this idea, in an<br>
initial stage, a plurality of CPUs or DSPs are aligned and operated in<br>
parallel and by assigning small-scale circuits to each, the overall<br>
simulation time can be reduced. Since FPGAs and PLDs have become<br>
.available, methods that directly assign the circuit to be simulated to<br>
"such devices have become predominant, with it becoming possible to<br>
emulate large-scale integrated circuits or hardware with performance<br>
that is extremely close to real-time performance.<br>
However, the internal cell construction of an FPGA is an<br>
architecture where a certain amount of time is required to change the<br>
hardware circuit realized by the FPGA, and therefore FPGA are not suited<br>
to implementing hardware with data paths, such as a,CPU or a DSP. In<br>
fact, when such hardware is implemented on an FPGA, it is not possible<br>
to compete with a specially designed LSI in terms of any of processing<br>
performance (operation frequency), gate efficiency, and power<br>
consumption. Also, depending on the circuit for executing an<br>
application, when an FPGA or PLD is used and the scale of the circuit to<br>
be implemented exceeds the degree of integration of the FPGA or PLD,<br>
as a rule such implementation will not be possible. Although it would be<br>
conceivable to implement the circuit for executing the application by<br>
dividing the circuit, in such case a plurality of chips are used, and due to<br>
the limited number of pins, performance, cost and power consumption<br>
become even worse.<br>
In addition, when implementing divided circuits in a single FPGA,<br>
there are many problems causing of dividing the circuit, such as limits<br>
on the number of pins and the transmission of the boundary information<br>
between the divided circuits. If all of such problems are resolved at a<br>
design stage for hardware using FPGAs, the merits of using FPGAs over<br>
conventional techniques for designing and developing dedicated LSIs are<br>
lost. In addition, FPGAs and PLDs require between several times and<br>
several ten times the hardware of the intended hardware circuit, and<br>
therefore the chip cost, intended performance, and power consumption<br>
are all inferior to a dedicated LSI.<br>
On the other hand, dedicated LSIs also have many problems. In<br>
the case of conventional dedicated or special-purpose LSIs, unless the<br>
correct intended performance and functional specification are available<br>
at the LSI design stage, there will be no convergence at the design<br>
stage. For example, depending on the execution state of the<br>
application, there are many cases where a dynamic tradeoff between<br>
function and performance is possible, but it is necessary to provide a<br>
hardware region that can realize the required performance at the design<br>
stage and an operation frequency that can ensure such performance for<br>
each function. That is, even when a dynamic tradeoff between function<br>
and performance is possible for an application, it is necessary to design<br>
an LSI having ensured both performance for tpeak performance<br>
requirements and implementing of each function on a unitary level.<br>
Accordingly, the requirements for both function and performance are<br>
crucial, and for system LSIs that require high performance and<br>
multifunctioning, costs build up in the worst case scenario, with<br>
manufacturing cost, chip area, and power consumption all worsening.<br>
More specifically, in the case of an automatic or automated control<br>
apparatus, for example, a robot application, when processing sight<br>
information and hearing information, there are many cases where the<br>
processing load of other functions (a walking function, speech<br>
processing, olfactory processing, or the like) greatly decreases.<br>
However, in a conventional system LSI, all of the circuits for realizing all<br>
of the functions are implemented in the same way, with some circuits<br>
simply not using the processing result or being made to stand by with a<br>
reduced processing performance.<br>
If the circuit configuration could be dynamically reconfigured, by<br>
dynamically optimizing the hardware space constructed by such<br>
reconfigurable logic circuits, the assigning of hardware resources to<br>
functions that are not used or are in the standby state can be greatly<br>
reduced, so that the hardware resources can then be collectively<br>
assigned to the sight information processing and/or hearing information<br>
processing where the resources should be concentrated. That is, in the<br>
present invention, unlike a conventional system LSI, there is no need to<br>
implement every hardware circuit (target circuit) and therefore it is<br>
possible to achieve maximum execution efficiency for fewer hardware<br>
resources.<br>
A dynamic optimization technique in the present invention<br>
dynamically optimizes the arrangement of a real hardware space<br>
constructed by logic circuits, and is a concept that includes not only<br>
optimization that completely rearranges the real hardware space every<br>
time but also the dynamic optimization of part of the arrangement of the<br>
real hardware space. Accordingly, it is possible not only to release the<br>
assigning hardware resources to functions off used at present but also to<br>
reduce the assigning of hardware resources on standby use and to<br>
increase the assigning of hardware resources to functions in use without<br>
sacrificing the real-time response of functions on standby.<br>
Also, the dynamic optimization technique in the present invention<br>
can, among the function that are being used, increase the assignment of<br>
hardware resources to functions requiring urgency and reduce the<br>
assignment of hardware resources or temporarily release the assignment<br>
of hardware resources to functions not requiring urgency. Here,<br>
"urgency" is a concept including processing speed and priority, and is an<br>
important requirement for a data processing system (apparatus and/or<br>
device). As other requirements for a data processing system that can<br>
affect the assigning of hardware resources, there are a variety of factors<br>
such as an increase or decrease in the number of jobs processed in<br>
parallel and the existence/absence of interrupts. The dynamic<br>
optimization technique in the present invention assigns hardware<br>
resources in accordance with such requirements for a data processing<br>
system, that is, the technique dynamically optimizes the configuration of<br>
an actual or a real hardware space.<br>
One method of dynamically optimizing a real hardware space<br>
includes imagining every situation that can be encountered by a data<br>
processing system, determining in advance the arrangement of a real<br>
hardware space that is optimal for such situations, preparing context<br>
information (or configuration information), and loading such information<br>
every time. Appling this method, some problems that occur in the real<br>
hardware space, such as timing closure, can be resolved in advance, and<br>
therefore may be preferable in ensuring the performance of the data<br>
processing system. However, it is impossible to imagine every situation<br>
that can be encountered in every scenario. In addition, if a generalpurpose<br>
solution that is fairly optimal for a limited number of situations<br>
and achieves moderate performance for others is used, the effect of<br>
dynamically optimizing the real hardware space is reduced.<br>
Another method includes providing a hardware module (IP or<br>
library) designed as a unit for implementing a certain function in the<br>
form of a netlist that merely shows logic gates and tbe connected state<br>
of such, mapping part or all of the netlist, when such function becomes<br>
necessary, so as to be assigned and wired in accordance with the free<br>
space in the real hardware space dynamically. Since circuits can be<br>
flexibly and dynamically assigned in accordance with the momentary<br>
state of the real hardware space, such method can be thought of as<br>
being able to optimize the hardware space as dynamically as possible.<br>
However, an assigning and wiring process based on a netlist requires a<br>
huge amount of time even at the design and development stage of a<br>
static LSI, and such process needs to be repeated at every instant when<br>
mapping is carried out. It is impossible mapping instantaneously a<br>
required circuit based on a netlist after resolving problems such as place<br>
and route issue and reflecting the instantaneous actual state of a real<br>
hardware space and other elements. Even if it were possible to provide<br>
hardware that can resolve problems including timing closure at high<br>
speed almost in units of clocks or cycles, it is not economical to<br>
separately provide such hardware resources, and waiting for such<br>
hardware to be registered simply makes the realization of dynamic<br>
optimization of a hardware space more difficult.<br>
At the stage of netlist, by separating partial circuits of an<br>
appropriate size in the circuit to be implemented by the netlist as units,<br>
resolving the place and route issues within such units of the partial<br>
circuit, disposing the partial circuits in free space in a real hardware<br>
space, and reducing the place and route issues for connecting such<br>
partial circuits when mapping of the partial circuits is performed, it may<br>
be possible to reduce the time required to resolve place and route issues<br>
in each instant where mapping is carried out. However, the state of the<br>
real hardware space constantly fluctuates during assigning and wiring.<br>
Accordingly, it is not easy to dynamically resolve place and route issues<br>
in every instant in accordance with the state, and even if it were<br>
possible, it would still be necessary to constantly consume hardware<br>
resources and power to do so, so that it is not possible to resolve the<br>
problem of providing a data processing apparatus with high performance<br>
and high functioning, a low chip cost, and low power consumption.<br>
In the present invention, an architecture code is provided, the<br>
architecture code including object circuit information for mapping an<br>
object circuit that is at least part of a circuit for executing an application<br>
onto part of a logic circuit region, interface circuit information for<br>
mapping an interface circuit in contact with the object circuit onto the<br>
logic circuit region, and boundary condition to be realized in the<br>
interface circuit. One of the most optimal examples of such object<br>
circuits are a plurality of divided or divisional circuits produced by<br>
dividing a hardware module designed as a unit for implementing a given<br>
function when executing an application. When few hardware resources<br>
are required to implement a hardware module, the hardware module can<br>
be converted to an object circuit without being divided, with interface<br>
circuit information corresponding to such object circuit being generated<br>
and implemented in the logic circuit region.<br>
A control method in the present invention for a data processing<br>
system including a logic circuit region where circuits are dynamically<br>
reconfigurable, includes a step of obtaining an architecture code, a step<br>
of mapping the object circuit and the interface circuit that comes in<br>
contact with the object circuit onto the logic circuit region according to<br>
the object circuit information and the interface circuit information of the<br>
architecture code, and an activating step of controlling the interface<br>
circuit based on the boundary condition of the architecture code.<br>
A data processing system in the present invention includes: a<br>
logic circuit region where circuits are dynamically reconfigurable; a load<br>
unit for obtaining an architecture code; a mapping unit for mapping the<br>
object circuit and the interface circuit in contact with the object circuit<br>
onto the logic circuit region according to the object circuit information<br>
and the interface circuit information of the architecture code; and a<br>
behavior control unit for controlling the interface circuit according to the<br>
boundary condition of the architecture code. The load unit is a fetch<br>
unit in a case where the architecture code is supplied by fetching<br>
process and is a download unit in a case where the architecture code is<br>
supplied by downloading process from a memory or a communication<br>
network using a computer or the like. Although in the present<br>
specification, "loading" refers to a procedure as far as obtaining an<br>
architecture code, there are cases where "loading" includes mapping that<br>
reconfigures hardware according to loaded circuit information. A variety<br>
of instructions such as a "fetch", "download", "get", and "read" can be<br>
assigned to the process whereby the load unit obtains the code, and it is<br>
also possible to load the architecture code using a communication<br>
system.<br>
The load unit, the mapping unit, and the behavior control unit can<br>
be regarded as single hardware modules respectively, and by dividing<br>
such modules and converting them to object circuits, such units can be<br>
implemented as divided circuits in the logic circuit region. Accordingly,<br>
when the conditions are such that some of the functions of the load unit,<br>
the mapping unit, and the behavior control unit only need to be realized<br>
according to the execution state of an application, the hardware<br>
resources assigned to such functions can be released or freed and<br>
assigned to realize other hardware modules, thereby improving the<br>
parallel processing performance and/or the processing speed.<br>
In the present invention, an original netlist of a circuit for<br>
executing an application including hardware modules can be divided into<br>
partial circuits having appropriate ranges, place and route issues are<br>
resolved in the units of divided circuits, and object circuit information for<br>
mapping the divided circuit onto part of a logic circuit region can be<br>
generated. Next, interface circuit information can be generated from<br>
information forming boundaries of the object circuits configured by the<br>
object circuit information so as to the object circuits are fit in the<br>
original netlist. Hence, the original netlist is converted into an assembly<br>
of object circuits, place and route issues are resolved for the object<br>
circuits, and boundary conditions of the interface circuits are generated.<br>
Accordingly, place and route issues between and/or among the object<br>
circuits are resolved at the generation stage of the architecture code as<br>
boundary conditions to be realized in the interface circuits.<br>
This means that when object circuits are disposed in a free space<br>
in a logic circuit region that is a real hardware space where circuits are<br>
dynamically reconfigurable, the load unit obtains a suitable architecture<br>
code, the mapping unit carries out mapping of the object circuits and<br>
also carries out mapping of interface circuits in the periphery of the<br>
object circuits, and the behavior control unit carries out control based on<br>
the boundary conditions of the interface circuits so that the object<br>
circuits are dynamically disposed in the real hardware space and the<br>
object circuits can be executed. Accordingly, by merely arranging<br>
desired or suitable object circuits and interface circuits in a logic circuit<br>
region based on the momentary state of the real hardware space, it is<br>
possible to execute the object circuits. The problem of having to<br>
resolve place and route issues between the object circuits at every<br>
moment can be prevented from the outset.<br>
In the present invention, one or a plurality of object circuits<br>
mapped onto a reconfigurable logic circuit region that is a real hardware<br>
space can be executed in that state. The boundaries of object circuits<br>
are virtually connected to many object circuits that construct the<br>
hardware module to which that object circuit belongs via the interface<br>
circuit. To do so, the boundaries of the object circuit are controlled in<br>
the state of a virtual hardware space where many object circuits are<br>
connected. Accordingly, at the mapping, mapping of the object circuit<br>
and its interface circuit can be performed to any usable region in the<br>
logic circuit region that is a real hardware space.<br>
When interface circuit information and boundary condition of an<br>
object circuit match or correspond at a boundary with those of an<br>
adjacent object circuit, this means that the object circuit that mapping is<br>
to be performed and the adjacent object circuit are the object circuits in<br>
contact with each other at the boundary in the virtual hardware space.<br>
Mapping of such object circuits can be performed so as to be directly<br>
connected or in contact with without passing the respective interface<br>
circuits. That is, the size of an assembly of actual object circuits<br>
mapped onto the real hardware space can be freely changed in<br>
accordance with the state of the real hardware space. It is possible to<br>
carry out mapping of a plurality of object circuits in a dispersed<br>
arrangement in the real hardware space or to carry out mapping of such<br>
circuits in a concentrated arrangement, so that the real hardware space<br>
can be used extremely flexibly.<br>
It is also possible to connect object circuits that are spatially<br>
and/or temporally, presently or previously dispersed or mapped<br>
separating or dividing on the logic circuit region. By reflecting, using<br>
the behavior control unit, a state of an interface circuit of an object<br>
circuit mapped by spatial and/or temporal division in control of an<br>
interface circuit of another executed object circuit based on the<br>
boundary condition, it is possible to easily connect, in a virtual hardware<br>
space, object circuits that are spatially and/or temporally separated on<br>
the logic circuit region.<br>
For this reason, it is preferable to provide a boundary information<br>
memory that stores a state of an interface circuit of an object circuit<br>
presently and/or previously mapped to the logic circuit region. Such<br>
object circuit to which a previous state is reflected includes the object<br>
circuit itself mapped spatially and/or temporally discontinuous. By<br>
doing so, even if a given object circuit is deleted from and then<br>
reproduced in the real hardware space according to certain conditions,<br>
continuous processing in such object circuit is possible in the virtual<br>
hardware space. It is also possible to configure a plurality of circuit<br>
instances for the same object circuit information to increase the<br>
parallelism or increase the reliability. Such control can be carried out<br>
according to architecture codes or according to the combination of the<br>
mapping unit and the behavior control unit.<br>
The architecture codes in the present invention can be used in a<br>
variety of methods. By providing the architecture codes to be mapped<br>
on the real hardware space in a state where the architecture codes can<br>
be sequentially traced like the instruction sets of a program, it is<br>
possible to control a data processing system according to the<br>
architecture codes. The architecture codes can be provided by being<br>
recorded on a recording medium and can be* provided via a<br>
communication means such as a network, with it being possible to<br>
change the hardware configuration by a remote operation.<br>
In addition, as a method of using the architecture codes in place<br>
of a conventional system LSI, it is possible for the load unit to obtain a<br>
desired architecture code from an architecture library including a<br>
plurality of architecture codes based on information of behavior<br>
environment including requests to the data processing system (such as<br>
urgency, the start of a new job or changes in the parallel processing<br>
state, the presence/absence of interrupts), the execution state of the<br>
object circuits mapped, and the usable state of the logic circuit region,<br>
so that the hardware of the data processing system can be dynamically<br>
optimally configured based on the execution state of an application.<br>
The guidelines for the optimization can be determined based on the<br>
information of behavioral environment, to which one or more of the load<br>
units, the mapping units, and the behavior control units may contribute.<br>
To carry out mapping of a new object circuit onto free space in the real<br>
hardware space, delete completed object circuits, and give priority to<br>
mapping an urgent hardware module, the divided circuits of other<br>
hardware modules may be temporarily saved or the hardware resources<br>
assigned to other hardware modules can be temporarily reduced. In<br>
this way, there are no limits on how the real hardware space can be<br>
used.<br>
Also, by converting hardware circuits to architecture codes, a<br>
great increase is made in the potential of a data processing system.<br>
When a system has limited use, an architecture library may be included<br>
in the data processing system. For example, it is possible to provide an<br>
automated control apparatus including the data processing system and a<br>
plurality of automated control mechanisms for which at least one of a<br>
plurality of hardware modules to be configured in the data processing<br>
system is used in respective control or data processing, wherein<br>
mapping of divided circuits of the plurality of hardware modules are<br>
dynamically performed in the logic circuit region. Here, when<br>
processing hearing information and sight information of a robot, the data<br>
processing system may be controlled so that hardware resources are<br>
mainly assigned to the divided circuits of the hardware modules required<br>
to control such processing and the divided circuits of the hardware<br>
modules required for other automated control mechanisms, such as a<br>
walking mechanism, are removed from the real hardware space.<br>
On the other hand, by obtaining an architecture code via<br>
communication with the outside of the data processing system, such as a<br>
network, a system having a hardware space for mapping some object<br>
circuits can freely use a huge hardware property. As one example, it is<br>
possible to carry out mapping and use a great variety of hardware<br>
properties present on the Internet onto an LSI of a local mobile terminal.<br>
In combination with an apparatus with a variety of mechanisms, such as<br>
a robot, a variety of work can be carried out by a small resource. Also,<br>
since the architecture codes are always updated, a variety of works is<br>
performed using a control circuit being always up dated.<br>
A terminal including the data processing system according to the<br>
present invention, mechanisms required for communication with the<br>
outside that cannot be realized by circuits, such as an antenna and<br>
connectors, and dedicated mechanisms for input and output, such as a<br>
display and microphone, can provides a variety of services including a<br>
various types of communication and others such as monitors the state of<br>
a living body. In addition, the circuit for carrying out such services<br>
includes a latest configuration that is always up to date.<br>
The size of an object circuit is flexible but should be smaller than,<br>
including its interface circuit, the size of a logic circuit region on that<br>
mapping of the object circuit is performed. When the object circuit size<br>
10 small, the real hardware space can be efficiently optimized. However,<br>
the amount" of architecture code provided for a single hardware module<br>
increases. According to the present invention, if there is enough<br>
hardware space at the mapping, mapping of a plurality of object circuits<br>
can be performed together. Accordingly, there is no risk of the number<br>
of mapping iterations becoming huge due to the size of the object<br>
circuits, which would result in increased processing time. For a system<br>
including a reconfigurable architecture including a plurality of circuit<br>
blocks, each of the circuit blocks being constructed of a specified or<br>
predetermined number of reconfigurable circuit elements, architecture<br>
codes including object circuit information for mapping in units of the<br>
circuit blocks are useful.<br>
The architecture codes included in the present invention can be<br>
applied to all data processing systems that include a logic circuit region<br>
where circuits can be dynamically reconfigured. However, in the case of<br>
hardware such as an FPGA that stores circuit configurations in lookup<br>
tables (LUTs), a number of clocks are needed to change the LUTs,<br>
resulting in the possibility of a noticeable fall in execution speed. The<br>
present invention provides a data processing system including a logic<br>
circuit region equipped with a plurality of elements that can be<br>
reconfigured in an extremely short time.<br>
The elements in the present invention include an operation core<br>
for performing a logic operation on input data and outputs output data,<br>
and the operation core includes a selector into which a multibit function<br>
code that designates the logic operation is inputted and which selects<br>
the output data according to the input data. Since the logic can be<br>
changed by merely providing a function code that is inputted into the<br>
operation core, logic can be exchanged rapidly without needing to<br>
rewrite an LLIT.<br>
The elements preferably include n inputs and n outputs, where n<br>
is a plural (integer), an input interface that freely selects the input data<br>
out of the n inputs; and an output interface that freely selects output<br>
from at least one of the n inputs and the output data and outputs the<br>
output via at least one out of the n outputs. For example, with a logic<br>
circuit region that extends in two dimensions, one possible value of n is<br>
four, with it being possible to input data from any of the points of a<br>
compass (i.e., left, right, above, and below), and to output data in any<br>
of the four directions. With a logic circuit region that extends in three<br>
dimensions, one possible value of n is six, with it being possible to input<br>
data from any of left, right, above, below, in front, and behind, and to<br>
output data in any of the six directions. Also, the elements may<br>
function merely as connection switching elements that do not carry out a<br>
logic operation. In addition, the operation core should preferably<br>
include a register that latches one of the n inputs or the output data.<br>
By not using the registers, it is possible to configure a circuit such as a<br>
decoder suited to executing processing where there is no or little clock<br>
dependency. Conversely, by using the registers, it is possible to<br>
configure a circuit such as a state machine suited to executing<br>
processing with high clock dependency.<br>
According to the present invention, it is possible to dynamically<br>
optimize a real hardware space in units of several clocks or cycles. This<br>
means that there is great freedom for tradeoffs, and therefore a number<br>
of conflicting demands, such as high performance and high functioning,<br>
low chip cost, and low power consumption can be simultaneously<br>
realized at a high level. Accordingly, the effectiveness of reconfigurable<br>
technology is greatly increased. Implementation efficiency in a circuit<br>
region that can be dynamically reconfigured is improved, the internal<br>
operation efficiency is also improved compared to a dedicated LSI, and a<br>
favorable solution in terms of all three of chip cost, performance, and<br>
power consumption can be provided. Also, since full use can be made<br>
of the characteristic whereby the dynamically reconfigurable hardware is<br>
programmable, it is possible to provide an architecture that as a rule<br>
does not appear the time for physical design, testing functions, and<br>
ensuring quality that is required for several months or more in a<br>
conventional LSI development.<br>
That is, in the present invention, a feasible dynamic optimization<br>
'technology of a hardware space is provided. In the present invention,<br>
system called an architecture code is provided in which hardware circuit<br>
information that has been conventionally provided by a physical entity<br>
and software information such as an instruction program that controls a<br>
hardware circuit are integrated and encoded as new information. Using<br>
the architecture codes, dynamically optimizing in an execution cycle for<br>
hardware becomes possible so as to trade off, at each/noment, between<br>
hardware resources that become effective and the required processing<br>
performance under constraint conditions of the application requirements<br>
(architecture), and therefore, a reconfigurable chip can beat a dedicated<br>
LSI designed for a specified application in terms of all three of chip cost,<br>
required performance, and power consumption.<br>
As fundamental techniques of architectures for achieving the<br>
dynamic optimization of a hardware space, followings can be nominated:<br>
a time divided execution technique of hardware circuits that includes<br>
dividing circuits and continuous execution of the divided circuit, a<br>
channel connecting technique for connecting a plurality of hardware<br>
circuits, dynamically generating/reducing/deleting techniques for<br>
hardware circuits, a compacting technique for hardware circuit<br>
information and a high-speed transmitting technique for the circuit<br>
information, a software technique for tradeoffs between application<br>
requirements and resources, and a high-speed emulation technique for<br>
hardware circuits and software information. The architecture codes in<br>
the present invention can support such techniques.<br>
The architecture codes according to the present invention include<br>
object circuit information (divided or divisional circuit information),<br>
interface circuit information, and boundary conditions, but the<br>
architecture codes may also be roughly classified into hardware circuit<br>
information and software information. Hardware circuit information can<br>
include module interrelation information (static topology information and<br>
dynamic module execution information), a hierarchy structure, a priority<br>
order, exception process conditions, dynamic tradeoff conditions and the<br>
Jike of respective circuits for the case where 100% of the hardware<br>
resources are usable. The architecture codes can include all the<br>
information that provides supplementary support to functions of the<br>
hardware circuits and timing control, such as boundary conditions, with<br>
such information including software information such as a conventional<br>
instruction program and vector table and, depending on the application,<br>
data information such as images.<br>
For example, in the case of a microprocessor, rthere are circuits,<br>
such as an external interrupt control unit and an exception processing<br>
unit, that are only necessary under special conditions, and circuits such<br>
as a decoder and a data path that are executed comparatively<br>
frequently. By using the architecture codes according to the present<br>
invention, it is possible to provide hardware and -software information of<br>
a microprocessor as a collection of information is rearranged so as to be<br>
dynamically optimized for dynamic execution after reanalyzing hardware<br>
circuits hierarchically configured in the hardware space from the<br>
functional viewpoint of the microprocessor. Unlike a code for a typical<br>
program space, such information is constructed of a plurality of<br>
architecture codes for parallel execution. Out of the object circuits<br>
implemented by the architecture codes, architecture codes relating to<br>
circuits that are hard to waiting for exchanging are stored in a memory<br>
inside an LSI. The architecture codes relating to object circuits where<br>
circuit execution and activation are not urgent are stored in the external<br>
memory and are executed after being loaded from an external memory<br>
into an internal memory.<br>
An architecture LSI that is one of the data processing systems<br>
included in the present invention can include: an external/internal rapid<br>
loading control unit (RLC) that includes the functions of the load unit and<br>
the mapping unit for translating the architecture codes onto hardware,<br>
initializing and executing the divided hardware circuit; a rapid logic<br>
communication master (RTM) that includes the functions of the<br>
execution control unit and carries out control of rapid logic exchanging<br>
operations and transmission (transfer) of hierarchical information; and a<br>
group of rapid logic exchanging elements (RXE) that form the logic<br>
circuit region and directly execute divisions of various hardware circuits<br>
(including test circuits). Embodiments of the present invention are<br>
described in detail below together with the other aspects, construction,<br>
and effects of the present invention.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
FIG. 1 shows one of a data processing system included in the<br>
present invention. The data processing system (apparatus or device) 1<br>
tjTan architecture LSI and includes a logic circuit region ("RC region" or<br>
"reconfigurable region") 10 where circuits can be dynamically<br>
reconfigured, an architecture library 2 in which a number of architecture<br>
codes 20 of hardware modules are stored, a rapid loading control unit<br>
(RLC) 11 that can translate the architecture codes 20 on the<br>
reconfigurable hardware 10 and initialize and execute the divisional<br>
hardware, and a rapid logic communication master (R/TM) 12 that can<br>
carry out control of a rapid logic circuit exchanging operation and<br>
transmission (transfer) of hierarchical information. The RLC 11 includes<br>
a function as a load unit (LU) 13 that obtains (i.e., fetches or<br>
downloads) the architecture codes 20 from the library 2. In addition,<br>
the RLC 11 includes a function as a mapping unit (MU) 14 that carries<br>
out mapping of object circuits 19 and interface circuits 18 so as to be in<br>
contact with the object circuits 19 onto the RC region 10 using object<br>
circuit information and interface circuit information of the architecture<br>
codes 20. The RTM 12 includes a function as a behavior control unit<br>
that controls the interface circuits 18 in accordance with boundary<br>
conditions of the architecture codes. Also, the RTM 12 includes a<br>
function for storing, as necessary, the states of the interface circuits 18<br>
of the object circuits 19 presently and/or previously mapped onto the RC<br>
region 10 in a boundary information memory 15 and transmits such<br>
information between the object circuits 19.<br>
In the description below, the object circuit information of the<br>
architecture codes 20 is generated so as to perform mapping of a partial<br>
hardware module that is divided into suitable ranges, onto the RC region<br>
10. Accordingly, the object circuits 19 configured in the RC region 10<br>
by the object circuit information are divisional circuits produced by<br>
dividing a hardware module designed as a unit for implementing a given<br>
function. The present invention is further described below with<br>
architecture codes 20 that include divided circuit information as object<br>
circuit information and divided circuits 19 as examples.<br>
The data processing system 1 further includes a RAM 5 in which a<br>
program 4 for executing an application is stored, a RISC processor 6 that<br>
tarries out processing using the hardware resources of the data<br>
processing system 1 in accordance with the program 4, an interrupt<br>
control unit 7 that receives interrupt signals, a clock generator 8 that<br>
supplies a clock signal to the various hardware resources of the data<br>
processing system 1, and a data input/output interface 9 that controls<br>
inputs and outputs of data to and from an external memory. The code<br>
RAM 5 can also be accessed from the RC region 10.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a different example of a data processing system<br>
(apparatus or device) 1 included in the present invention. Hardware<br>
functions as a CPU or a DSP can be provided by one or a plurality of<br>
hardware modules (hardware macros). In the same way, the various<br>
functions of the load unit (LU) 13 for loading the architecture codes 20,<br>
the mapping unit (MU) 14, and the behavior control unit (RTM) 12 can<br>
be provided by one or a plurality of hardware modules respectively. In<br>
addition, an interrupt detecting unit (IU) 7 can also be provided by a<br>
hardware module. Accordingly, by converting such hardware modules<br>
into divided circuits, the hardware modules can be dynamically<br>
configured in the RC region 10 using the architecture codes. This<br>
means that with the data processing system 1 shown in FIG. 2, by the<br>
divided circuits 19 and the interface circuits 18, the functions of the<br>
processor 6, the LU 13, the MU 14, and the RTM 12 can be partially or if<br>
necessary entirely realized respectively in the RC region 10.<br>
Accordingly, in this data processing system 1, since the functions<br>
of the RISC processor 6 are realized using the RC region 10, control of<br>
the data processing system 1 including control of the RC region 10 is<br>
carried out by circuits mapped on the RC region 10. In such data<br>
processing system, a function realized by a fixed hardware configured<br>
thereon is an initial setting function 16 for mapping some circuits for<br>
starting or resetting the data processing system that is the architecture<br>
LSI 1, on the RC region 10 of the LSI 1 when starting or resetting the<br>
LSI 1. The initial setting function 16 may be provided as an<br>
independent circuit or may be provided by including in the minimum<br>
required functions for managing and controlling the RC region 10, such<br>
asthe RTM 12 and the functions are realized by the fixed hardware.<br>
In this way, by using circuits mapped onto the RC region 10, it is<br>
possible to control the data processing system 1 itself, including control<br>
over the RC region 10. Accordingly, by providing architecture codes 28<br>
including codes for controlling over the data processing system 1 in the<br>
RAM 4, it is possible to control the data processing system 1 using<br>
architecture codes 28. Here, control by a conventional program<br>
including a plurality of instruction sets can be replaced with control by<br>
the architecture codes 28. This means that by providing the<br>
architecture codes 28 via a recording medium, network, communication,<br>
or the like, it is possible to implement not only hardware information but<br>
also conventional software information in the data processing system 1,<br>
thereby increasing the flexibility of the data processing system 1.<br>
Architecture codes that provide functions such as the LU 13, the<br>
MU 14, and the RTM 12 that are necessary to execute applications and<br>
have general or versatile applicability for a plurality of applications<br>
performed on the data processing system 1 can be supplied<br>
independently of the architecture codes 20 for applications as the<br>
architecture codes 29 that support the fundamental functions of the data<br>
processing system 1. Such architecture codes 29 that support the<br>
fundamental system can be handled like an OS or BIOS of a processor<br>
that runs on a conventional program base. In addition, by providing<br>
hardware that supports the fundamental system as the architecture<br>
codes 29, when an exchanging operation is not necessary for the RC<br>
region 10 or when it is possible to reduce the cycle of exchanging<br>
operations, it is possible to release regions occupied by hardware used<br>
for exchanging operations of the RC region 10 to mapping of hardware<br>
used for executing an application. For this reason, it is possible to<br>
provide an LSI that can improve the usage efficiency of the RC region 10<br>
and can achieve maximum processing performance for few hardware<br>
resources.<br>
FIG. 3 shows examples of architecture codes 20. The<br>
architecture codes 20 are respectively includes hardware circuit<br>
information 21 and software information 22. The hardware circuit<br>
information 21 includes divided circuit information 23 for mapping, onto<br>
part of the RC region 10, divided circuit 19 that is one of a plurality of<br>
divided circuits produced by dividing a hardware module (IP or library)<br>
designed for implementing a given function unit as a circuit, and<br>
interface circuit information 24 for mapping interface circuit 18 in<br>
contact with the divided circuit 19 onto the RC region 10. The software<br>
information 22 of an architecture code 20 includes identification<br>
information 25 for identifying the architecture code 20, boundary<br>
condition 26 to be realized in the interface circuit 18, and also other<br>
information 27, such as information on a priority order with respect to<br>
other divided circuits, exception processing conditions, dynamic tradeoff<br>
conditions, and an execution order for the divided circuits. The<br>
architecture codes 20 clearly show all of the primitive function<br>
information and topology for configuring the divided circuits and also<br>
show the functions of the individual divided circuits 19 and the<br>
connections between the divided circuits 19.<br>
In the data processing system 1 of the present embodiment, for<br>
example, circuit configurations (hardware module) for realizing the<br>
function labeled "A" in FIGS. 1 and 2 are provided as the architecture<br>
codes 20 numbered Al to An. Also, circuit configurations for realizing<br>
the function labeled B are provided as the architecture codes 20<br>
numbered Bl to Bm, circuit configurations for realizing the function<br>
labeled C are provided as the architecture codes 20 numbered Cl to Cx,<br>
and circuit configurations for realizing the function labeled D are<br>
provided as the architecture codes 20 numbered Dl to Dy. Note that n,<br>
m, x, and y are suitable integers.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, when the data processing system 1 controls a<br>
robot 70 as one example of an automated control apparatus, the<br>
function A controls and carries out data processing for hearing 71, the<br>
function B controls and carries out data processing for sight 72, the<br>
function C controls and carries out data processing for speech ability 73,<br>
and the function D controls and carries out data processing for physical<br>
functions 74. Divided circuits for the hardware modules (module A to<br>
module D) of this plurality of automated control mechanisms 71 to 74<br>
are dynamically mapped onto the RC region 10 of the data processing<br>
system 1. In the RC region 10, areas occupied by the hardware<br>
modules for the respective mechanisms 71 to 74 are dynamically<br>
controlled. For example, when the robot 70 carries out a conversation,<br>
large demands are made by the hearing, sight, and speech function, and<br>
the areas occupied by the divided circuits 19 for the functions A, B, and<br>
C are increased. On the other hand, when carrying out an operation<br>
that uses the body of the robot 70, large demands are made by the<br>
vision and physical functions, and therefore the areas occupied by the<br>
divided circuits 19 for the functions B and D are increased.<br>
This robot 70 also includes a functional unit 75 for connecting with<br>
the outside, for example, a computer network such as the Internet via a<br>
wireless or wired connection. Accordingly, it is possible to download the<br>
architecture codes for realizing the various functions from outside. For<br>
this reason, there are fundamentally no limitations on the types of work<br>
that can be realized by the robot 70. Also, by updating the architecture<br>
codes at the supplier of the architecture codes, it is possible to control<br>
the robot 70 using hardware modules that are always up-to-date, and<br>
therefore the problem of hardware obsolescence can be solved. It is<br>
also possible to carry out remote control over the robot 70 using<br>
architecture codes. Out of the functions required for communication<br>
with the outside, functions that can be covered by circuits are<br>
fundamentally realized by the data processing system 1 of the present<br>
embodiment using architecture codes. Accordingly, the communication<br>
unit 75 includes hardware that cannot be covered by circuits, such as an<br>
antenna and connectors.<br>
When up to the communication function cannot be covered by a<br>
single data processing system 1, another data processing system 1 for<br>
communication purposes may be mounted to support the communication<br>
function. It is also possible to supply a system designed that, when the<br>
load of the communication function is small, the additional data<br>
processing system 1 supports other functions. In the same way as the<br>
other functions, one or a plurality of data processing system 1 were<br>
provided centrally or in a distributed manner as the physical functions,<br>
and when the load of the physical functions is small, such data<br>
processing systems 1 can be used for other functions such as speech<br>
processing.<br>
FIG. 5 shows the overall arrangement of a* terminal 80 that<br>
includes the data processing system 1. The terminal 80 also includes a<br>
mechanism 85 for communicating with the outside. Accordingly, by<br>
downloading architecture codes from the outside, a variety of services<br>
can be provided by the terminal 80. By installing an input/output<br>
mechanism 81 such as a display, a microphone, a speaker, and the like,<br>
all of the services required for inputting and outputting images, sound,<br>
and the like can be provided. In addition, by installing a sensor 82 for<br>
detecting light, temperature, or the like, it is possible to provide not only<br>
services such as a camera and thermometer but also a variety of other<br>
services using the sensor 82, such as monitoring a living body. Also, by<br>
downloading architecture codes from the outside, it is possible to use<br>
functions of hardware modules that are always up-to-date.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a method of generating the architecture codes 20.<br>
First, in a step 31, an original netlist of a hardware module is generated.<br>
A variety of methods are known for carrying out processing up to the<br>
generation of the netlist that use a high-level language such as C or a<br>
hardware description language such as Verilog, and any of such methods<br>
may be used. In step 32, the original netlist is divided into a number of<br>
units and the divided circuit information 23 is generated by resolving the<br>
place and route issues to enable the respective divided ranges of such<br>
divided units to be mapped on the RC region 10.<br>
The divided circuits 19 to be mapped onto the RC region 10 are<br>
divided so as to be assigned using one or a plurality of circuit blocks,<br>
which are suitable ranges of configuring the hardware of the RC region<br>
10, as units. By using this method of division, it is possible to<br>
efficiently assign the divided circuits 19 to the RC region 10. Dividing<br>
v^here the exchanging of data between the divided circuits 19 frequently<br>
occurs is not preferable for mapping the individual divided circuits 19<br>
onto the RC region 10. In this invention, problems caused by such<br>
dividing can be solved by assigning a priority order so that a<br>
combination of such divided circuits 19 is simultaneously mapped<br>
whenever allowed by the state of the RC region 10. The data<br>
processing system 1 in the present invention may allow or be compliant<br>
with a variety of methods of dividing a netlist. However, in step 32, the<br>
division of the original netlist and assignment to the hardware of the RC<br>
region 10 should preferably be carried out repeatedly so as to obtain<br>
optimal divided circuit information 23.<br>
In step 33, the interface circuit information 24 is generated from<br>
information that forms the boundaries of the divided circuits 19 on the<br>
original netlist. For the boundaries where in contact with the adjacent<br>
divided circuits 19, the interface circuit information 24 are the same.<br>
The architecture codes are therefore generated so that parts of the<br>
interface circuit information 24 are the same.<br>
Next, in step 34, the original netlist is converted to a group or an<br>
assembly of divided circuits 19 and the place and route issues including<br>
timing closure issues between and/or among the divided circuits are<br>
resolved so that the function as a hardware module is realized by the<br>
divided circuits 19, thereby generating the boundary conditions 26 for<br>
the interface circuits 18. By the boundary conditions, at the boundaries<br>
between adjacent divided circuits 19, states that the boundaries are<br>
coincide and/or such divided circuits 19 are connected are realized, and<br>
therefore, the boundary conditions have equal or matching conditions in<br>
parts where the interface circuit information 24 is the same or has<br>
corresponding constructions. For this reason, the architecture codes are<br>
generated with boundary conditions 26 with common parts or parts that<br>
correspond.<br>
Compiling of the information described above is performed for<br>
of the divided circuits 19 mapped to the RC region 10, and a usable<br>
of the RC region 10 (presence/absence of free space,<br>
presence/absence of replaceable divided circuits, and the like).<br>
If the code 20 is stored in the library 2, the load unit 13 outputs<br>
an address and fetches the code 20. If the load unit 13 is equipped<br>
with a suitable communication function, it is also possible to obtain the<br>
code 20 from another data processing apparatus, an external memory,<br>
or a server connected by a network or another resource on a network.<br>
In the same way as the architecture codes 28, by usintj a configuration<br>
where the architecture codes are forcibly or actively loaded by the load<br>
unit 13, it is possible to actively control the processing on the data<br>
processing system 1 via the architecture codes.<br>
In step 42, the mapping unit 14, using the divided circuit<br>
information 23 and the interface circuit information 24 of the<br>
architecture codes 20 obtained, performs mapping of the divided circuits<br>
19 and the interface circuits 18 so as to come in contact with the divided<br>
circuits onto the RC region 10 respectively. Since the state of the RC<br>
region 10 can be grasped with highest precision by the RTM 12 that<br>
controls the execution of the divided circuits 19, based on instructions<br>
from the RTM 12, the mapping unit 14 carries out mapping of the divided<br>
circuits 19 and the interface circuits 18 to a free hardware space or a<br>
replaceable hardware space in the RC region 10. At this time, when the<br>
interface circuit information 24 and the boundary conditions 26 of the<br>
boundaries between the divided circuits 19 mapping adjacently match or<br>
correspond, this means that the divided circuits 19 are adjacent in the<br>
virtual hardware space, and therefore it is possible to connect the<br>
circuits directly in the real hardware space 10. Accordingly, mapping of<br>
the divided circuits 19 is performed so that adjacent divided circuits are<br>
directly connected without passing (without being connected via) the<br>
respective interface circuits. Note that in FIGS. 1 and 2, to simplify the<br>
drawings, the interface circuits 18 are formed on only the right and left<br>
sides of the divided circuits 19 respectively. When the divided circuits<br>
19 include wires for connecting not only the right and left sides but also<br>
the upper and lower sides, the interface circuits 18 are arranged so as to<br>
encapsulate the divided circuits 19 on the upper, lower, left, and right<br>
s"ides of the divided circuits 19 respectively. In addition, if the RC<br>
region 10 extends in three dimensions and the divided circuits 19 are<br>
also circuits that extend in three dimensions, the interface circuits 18<br>
are composed so as to encapsulate the divided circuits 19 in three<br>
dimensions.<br>
In principle, mapping of the divided circuits 19 is performed on a<br>
free region of the RC region 10. If, according fro the behavioral<br>
environment information grasped by the RTM 12, mapping of new<br>
divided circuits 19 urgently need with priority over divided circuits that<br>
have already been mapped on.the RC region 10, it is possible to erase or<br>
delete the mapping of the divided circuits 19 that have already been<br>
made or to reduce such mapping of the circuits to produce a free region.<br>
Remapping of such other divided circuits 19 that have been deleted can<br>
be performed onto the RC region 10 after the urgent state has passed,<br>
and then activated from the start or from a midpoint. Also, the other<br>
divided circuits 19 that mapping area have been reduced, by repeating<br>
the process for mapping the divided circuits 19, although the processing<br>
speed will fall, the processing of other functions achieved by such<br>
divided circuits can be continuously executed. In this way, in the data<br>
processing system 1, depending on information such as the information<br>
of behavioral environment, unexpected mapping of divided circuits 19<br>
can be carried out onto the RC region 10. It is possible to grasp the<br>
situations faced by an application in advance from a simulation or the<br>
like and to carry out scheduling so that the desired divided circuits 19<br>
are mapped at predetermined positions in the RC region 10, which<br>
makes it possible to improve the usage efficiency of the RC region 10.<br>
In step 43, the mapped divided circuits 19 are activating. To<br>
activate the divided circuits 19, in step 44, the interface circuits 18 are<br>
controlled based on the boundary conditions 26 to supply predetermined<br>
data to the divided circuits 19 at predetermined timing. In step 44, by<br>
using the functions of the RTM 12, the states of the interface circuits 18<br>
of other divided circuits 19 that have been mapped in the RC region 10<br>
at present and/or previously to spatially and/or temporally divide the RC<br>
'region 10 are reflected, based on the boundary conditions 26, in the<br>
control of the interface circuit 18 of the divided circuits 19 to be<br>
activating. Accordingly, in step 45, the divided circuits 19 realized in<br>
the real hardware space have the same states as in a virtual hardware<br>
space in which the other divided circuits in the periphery are connected,<br>
so that as a hardware module is in functioning by the divided circuits 19<br>
belong to the hardware module and being realized omthe real hardware<br>
space. Also, since the result of the operation or working of each divided<br>
circuit 19 is outputted to the interface circuit 18, the RTM 12 spatially<br>
transmits the state of such interface circuits 18 to the interface circuits<br>
18 of other divided circuits 19 already mapped onto the RC region 10<br>
and after some time has passed, transmits the state to the interface<br>
circuits 18 of other divided circuits 19 that will be mapped next onto the<br>
RC region 10. By doing so, it is possible for signals to propagate in the<br>
virtual hardware space according to the netlist, thereby realizing the<br>
function of the hardware module.<br>
The boundary information set in the interface circuits 18 can be<br>
stored in advance in the memory 15. If there is a long time until<br>
another divided circuit 19 is mapped or a divided circuit 19 has been<br>
deleted mid-operation, by setting boundary information stored in the<br>
memory 15 in the interface circuit 18, it is possible to cause the divided<br>
circuit 19 to operate or repeat an operation with the desired conditions.<br>
In step 46, steps 44 and 45 are repeated until the requests to<br>
have the mapped divided circuits 19 active are completed. After this,<br>
the divided circuits 19 whose processing has terminated are deleted<br>
from the RC region 10 in step 47. Alternatively, if there is space in the<br>
RC region 10, if it has been predicted that the functions of the divided<br>
circuits 19 will again become necessary, the divided circuits 19 may be<br>
reduced and kept in the RC region 10. If there is more free space in the<br>
RC region 10, the divided circuits 19 may be left as they are. When<br>
divided circuits 19 that need to operate repeatedly on consecutively<br>
inputted data are mapped, the divided circuits 19 are present in the RC<br>
10 until the processing is terminated. If the processing speed<br>
can be raised by increasing the parallelism, a plurality of circuit<br>
instances of the same divided circuit 19 may be mapped to increase the<br>
processing speed. Also, a plurality of circuit instances may be<br>
configured in the RC region 10 for the same architecture code 20 and<br>
the outputs of such instances may be compared to realize highly reliable<br>
processing. It is also possible to determine whether high reliability is<br>
required and/or whether high processing speed is required and control<br>
the data processing system 1 so as to automatically use an appropriate<br>
construction. On the other hand, like in a state machine, when the<br>
processing content changes in order due to a change in state, different<br>
divided circuits 19 are mapped one after the other.<br>
Mapping of the divided circuits 19 that are the circuit instances, to<br>
dynamically optimize the hardware space, can require the RTM 12 that is<br>
the table master to activate and/or delete other circuit instances. The<br>
RTM 12 generates, deletes, copies, moves, and connects channels for a<br>
plurality of circuits, so that functions that originally can only be<br>
performed by a large scale circuit that is assigned and configured as the<br>
large scale circuit as it is in a physical space, can be carried out by<br>
generating only the limited circuits that are required at each respective<br>
moment as circuit instances in the hardware space and dynamically<br>
optimizing the circuit instances. Therefore, it becomes possible to an<br>
extremely large number of circuits be in operation in parallel virtually<br>
using a hardware space with few resources.<br>
The divided circuits 19 configured in the hardware space can be<br>
categorized into types such as permanent circuits that are always<br>
present or existed on the logic circuit region (circuit plane) 10 of the<br>
data processing system (architecture LSI) 1, instant circuits that are<br>
generated and are only existed for a predetermined time, and cyclic<br>
circuits that are generated at intervals of a predetermined time. When<br>
some actual execution are carried out in instant circuits and cyclic<br>
circuits, before the circuits are deleted, the circuits notify the RTM 12 of<br>
information on the execution results which is to be provided to other<br>
circuits and such information is stored. This circuit execution<br>
information is always efficiently transmitted to the other divided circuits<br>
19 to be generated next. The RTM 12 carries out circuit control so that<br>
the execution information is efficiently transmitted between instant<br>
circuits.<br>
The determining of the activation order of the divided circuits 19<br>
is carried out by a circuit compiler of the development frame work (FW)<br>
during the development stage that generates the architecture codes 20<br>
shown in FIG. 6. When there is a change in the circuit activation order<br>
of the divided circuits 19 due to an external signal or data input<br>
conditions, the RTM 12 controls the activation of such divided circuits<br>
19. On the other hand, when the activation order can be completely<br>
controlled by the divided circuits themselves, the RTM 12 expands and<br>
reduces the execution areas of circuits in accordance with the priority<br>
order of the entire system.<br>
For example, in the RC region 10 in FIG. 1, the divided circuit Al<br>
of the module A for realizing the function A is embodied together with<br>
the interface circuits, and the divided circuits Bl to B3 of the module B<br>
for realizing the function B are embodied together with the interface<br>
circuits. Since the divided circuits Bl to B3 are generated in a<br>
continuous part of the RC region 10 as continuous circuit instances, the<br>
boundaries of adjacent divided circuits are continuous and the interface<br>
circuits 18 are only formed at the boundaries to the outside of the<br>
continuous divided circuits. It should be noted that to simplify the<br>
explanation, the interface circuits 18 are realized only on the left and<br>
right sides in the drawings, but when the divided circuits are connected<br>
above and below in the virtual hardware space, there are cases where<br>
interface circuits are generated in the same way as described above.<br>
For the module C that realizes the function C, the divided circuits<br>
Cl and C2 are mapped in the RC region 10 but are separated spatially.<br>
For this reason, the interface circuits 18 are embodied for the respective<br>
divided circuits Cl and C2, with the divided circuits Cl and C2 being<br>
connected via the RTM 12. Also, for the module D that realizes the<br>
function D, the divided circuits Dl and D2 are mapped in a connected<br>
state. The RTM 12 activates the interface circuits 18 of such divided<br>
circuits 19 by setting data at appropriate timing in the interface circuits<br>
18, and as a result, data outputted to the interface circuits 18 is stored<br>
and is transmitted to the interface circuits 18 of connected divided<br>
circuits 19 produced by spatial or temporal division.<br>
Also, the RTM 12 can change the type, that is, the frequency, of<br>
the clock signal supplied from the clock generator 8 to the divided<br>
circuits 19 of the RC region 10, according to the architecture codes 20 of<br>
the divided circuits 19 and the behavioral environment information for<br>
the divided circuits 19. It becomes possible to minimize the power<br>
consumption of the RC region 10, and to maintain the maximum<br>
performance. As a rule, clock signals are not supplied to regions in the<br>
RC region 10 to which circuit instances have not been mapped.<br>
FIGS. 8 and 9 show the state of the RC region 10 as time passes.<br>
The function A is performed by the instant circuits so as to the divided<br>
circuits 19 numbered Al, A2, and A3 are consecutively generated and<br>
deleted, with the transferring of data between the divided circuits 19<br>
being carried out by the RTM 12. The function B is recognized in the<br>
RTM 12 in the illustrated sequence as a function requiring urgency, and<br>
is generated using a large amount of hardware resources of the RC<br>
region 10. At the timing shown in FIG. 8, the function D is deleted and<br>
the resources used thereby are used to generate a number of divided<br>
circuits 19. At the timing shown in FIG. 9, the divided circuits 19 of the<br>
function D are remapped on the region where the divided circuits 19 for<br>
the function B have been deleted, and the processing of the function D is<br>
re-executed from the beginning or from a midpoint.<br>
FIG. 10 shows the configuration of the RC region 10. In the RC<br>
region 10 of the present embodiment, circuit blocks (rxe_plane) 51 that<br>
are groups or assemblies of a plurality of elements whose individual logic<br>
operations can be changed are arranged in a lattice (an array or a<br>
matrix) and are interconnected by wires 52. The size of the divided<br>
circuits 19 defined by the architecture codes 20 should preferably be a<br>
unultiple of units of the circuit blocks 51. Using such divided circuit<br>
information 24 as the context (configuration information), the divided<br>
circuits 19 are mapped so as to consume one or a plurality of circuit<br>
blocks 51.<br>
FIG. 11 shows the configuration of one circuit block 51. In the<br>
present embodiment, sixteen logic elements 53 are disposed in each<br>
circuit block 51 to construct a four by four array. The respective logic<br>
elements 53 are connected to the adjacent logic etements 53 above,<br>
below, on the left, and on the right in FIG. 11 by four-bit buses 54 of<br>
"layer 1". The buses 55 of "layer 2" that pass the adjacent logic<br>
elements 53 above, below, on the left, and on the right to connec-t logic<br>
elements 53 located further out are also provided. By the buses, the<br>
logic elements 53 can be connected more flexibly. Buses of "Layer 3"<br>
for connecting between logic elements 53 three positions left may also<br>
be provided.<br>
The respective logic elements 53 include a function as a logic<br>
operation element and a function as a wiring switch that switches the<br>
connections between logic elements. Since it is necessary to change or<br>
exchange the logic to be used and the state of the wire connections at<br>
high speed, elements called RXE (Rapid exchange Elements) 53 capable<br>
of high-speed exchanging operations are disposed in the RC region 10<br>
according to the present embodiment.<br>
FIG. 12 shows the configuration of an RXE 53. The RXE 53<br>
includes four input routes (circuits) 61, four output routes (circuits) 62,<br>
an input interface 63 that freely selects input data from the four input<br>
routes 61, an operation core 65 that carries out a logic operation on the<br>
input data cpi selected by the input interface 63 and outputs data, and an<br>
output interface 64 that freely selects output from the four input routes<br>
61 and output data cpo of the operation core 65 and can connect the<br>
selected output to the four output routes 62. The operation core 65 has<br>
a configuration so that the logic operation can be changed and functions<br>
as an operation element whose logic can be changed or reconfigured.<br>
The input interface 63 has a configuration including an arrangement of a<br>
plurality of 16-to-l selectors 63s that freely select one bit from the four<br>
input routes 61 respectively. The output interface 64 has a<br>
configuration including an arrangement of a plurality of 7-to-l selectors<br>
64s that route the output cpo from the operation core 65 and the four<br>
inputs 61 respectively.<br>
FIG. 13 shows the configuration of the operation core (rxe_core)<br>
65. The operation core 65 includes a selector 66 that has a 16-bit<br>
function code cpf for designating a logic operation as ant input and selects<br>
the output data cpo according to the input data cpi. The operation core<br>
65 further includes a decoder 67 that decodes 4-bit input data cpi to<br>
generate a selection signal for the 16-bit selector 66, a register 68 that<br>
latches the data from one of the four input routes 61 or the output data<br>
cpo, and selectors 69a and 69b for selecting the signal to be latched in<br>
the register 68.<br>
FIGS. 14 and 15 show behaviors of the operation core 65. The<br>
operation core 65 changes its operation according to the mode signal<br>
cpm. In "mode 0" in FIG. 14, the operation core 65 generates 1-bit<br>
output data cpo from the 4-bit input data cpi, latches the output data cpo<br>
in the register 68, and outputs the output data cpo. In "mode 1" in FIG.<br>
14, the operation core 65 generates 1-bit output data cpo from the 4-bit<br>
input data cpi and outputs the output data cpo without latching the output<br>
data cpo in the register 68. The output data cpo depends on the result of<br>
decoding the 16-bit function code cpf and the input data cpi. Accordingly,<br>
as shown in FIG. 16, in these modes, by changing the function code cpf,<br>
it is possible to use the operation core 65 as nine or more types of logic<br>
operation element from a four-input AND to a four-input comparator.<br>
In addition, the operation core 65 carries out a logic operation<br>
using a combination of the selector 66 and the function code cpf. This<br>
means that unlike a conventional FPGA, it is not necessary to set logic in<br>
a lookup table (LUT) using a memory element such as an SRAM.<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to omit cycles that carry out input/output for<br>
the SRAM, and it is possible to instantly switch the operation carried out<br>
by the operation core 65 at the timing when the function code cpf is<br>
outputted to the operation core 65. For this reason, the operation core<br>
'65 in the present embodiment is referred to as a "rapid exchange<br>
element".<br>
In "mode 2" to "mode 4" shown in FIG. 15, a single operation core<br>
65 functions as two operation elements that respectively output 1-bit<br>
output data cpo for 2-bit input signals cpi. That is, the included 16-to-l<br>
selector 66 is set so as to operate as two 4-to-l selectors. In "mode 2"<br>
to "mode 4", as shown in FIG. 16, by changing the function code cpf, the<br>
operation core 65 can be used as seven or more types of logic operation<br>
element from an inverter to a two-input EXNOR.<br>
In addition, in "mode 5" to "mode 7" shown in FIG. 15, the<br>
operation core 65 can be used as an operation element that outputs 1-<br>
bit output data cpo for a 3-bit input signal cpi. If the input of an<br>
additional bit is permitted, the included 16-to-l selector 66 can be set<br>
so as to operate as two 3-to-l selectors, and therefore the operation<br>
core 65 can be used as two 3-bit input/1-bit output operation elements.<br>
In "mode 5" to "mode 7", as shown in FIG. 16, by changing the function<br>
code cpf, the operation core 65 can be used as five or more types of logic<br>
operation element from a three-input AND to a full adder.<br>
In this way, the logic of the RXEs 53 that construct the RC region<br>
10 of the present embodiment can be exchanged at high-speed using<br>
selectors. In addition, the RXEs 53 internally include the registers 68<br>
that latch the output data and therefore, the RXEs 53 can output directly<br>
and/or via a flip-flop in a state where the output data is synchronized<br>
with a clock. Accordingly, combinational circuits (decoders), and<br>
sequential circuits (state machines) and operation circuits (data paths),<br>
all of them are often used in digital circuits, can be efficiently<br>
implemented and executed by the circuit information of the architecture<br>
codes 20.<br>
The elements (RXE) 53 of the present embodiment whose logic<br>
can be reconfigured are for arranging a two-dimensional array or matrix.<br>
Accordingly, four circuits for input and output respectively are suited to<br>
being disposed in a two-dimensional array. However, if the network that<br>
connects the elements is one-dimensional, two or three inputs and<br>
butputs may be enough. In addition, if the network that connects the<br>
elements is three dimensional, five or more inputs and outputs should<br>
preferably be used. In addition, although the operation core (rxe_core)<br>
of the present embodiment uses selectors to make it possible to carry<br>
out exchanging operations at high speed, if it is possible to consume a<br>
cycle by inputting logic into a lookup table (LUT), it is possible to use an<br>
operation core including an LUT.<br>
In addition, although a matrix includes elements 53 of the same<br>
configuration in the present embodiment, it is also possible to arrange a<br>
matrix from elements for logic operations and elements that form a<br>
network. Also, by using a matrix in which a plurality of types of<br>
elements, such as elements with fairly specialized functions, such as<br>
elements mostly for arithmetic calculations, elements mainly for<br>
generating addresses, and general-purpose elements but have a certain<br>
performance for some processing functions, are arranged with a suitable<br>
density, it is possible to construct an RC region with a reconfigurable<br>
circuit.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The hardware architecture of a system is often determined by the<br>
required specification at a stage of design start or study stage. To cope<br>
with changes in requirements at a stage where the actual application is<br>
fixed and with changes to the required specification that were not<br>
foreseen at the initial design stage, modern FPGAs and PLDs use an<br>
architecture where the hardware configuration can be changed.<br>
However, such flexibility has disadvantages in that the basic elements<br>
that construct the interior become redundant, resulting in a loss in<br>
competitiveness in terms of chip cost and in that the operation<br>
frequency is low compared to a specially designed LSI or ASSP.<br>
In recent years, attention has been placed on dynamic<br>
reconfigurable machines and it is becoming possible to overcome the<br>
problem of high chip cost and the disadvantage of low operation<br>
frequency. However, such competitiveness is still insufficient compared<br>
to dedicated LSIs that are developed over one or two years. In the<br>
present invention, in addition to solving the above problems, by<br>
achieving low power consumption, it is possible to achieve an overall<br>
cost performance of present SoCs (System-on-Chip), and by dynamically<br>
optimizing the architecture, a next-generation "hyper SoC" can be<br>
realized.<br>
The problems for current LSI development are, although<br>
competitiveness based on chip cost is low and performance and power<br>
consumption are excellent, that excessive development time and<br>
development cost are required. Such problems can also be solved with<br>
the present invention.<br>
The normal approach for present LSI design uses hardware<br>
description language (Verilog-HDL or VHDL) and translates (logically<br>
synthesizing) such hardware description language to a netlist using the<br>
libraries and according to the connecting types suited to the processing<br>
carried out in semiconductor of various companies. In such design, the<br>
operation frequency is affected by the connected state of the physical<br>
wiring and logic 'gates (circuits), but a larger problem is that it is not<br>
possible to optimize from the viewpoint of the system architecture.<br>
That is, present SoC, FPGA, and dynamic reconfigurable technology, are<br>
constructed so that dynamic optimization from the architecture level is<br>
not possible when executing hardware. The present invention makes it<br>
possible to dynamically optimize a hardware space when executing<br>
hardware and therefore solves the above problem.<br>
Also, with present methods of developing and implementing LSIs,<br>
an extremely high cost is required to raise system reliability and ensure<br>
quality. One reason for this is that an internal function check can only<br>
be carried out if a test circuit can be implemented. When a test circuit<br>
is implemented, chip area becomes occupied by the test circuit, which<br>
raises the chip cost. Accordingly, although there are means for<br>
ultimately raising quality, there is a tradeoff with cost, and therefore<br>
there are limits for ensuring reliability and quality. This results in<br>
besting that is essential for consumer products itself making such<br>
products less competitive. In addition, designing so as to simplify<br>
debugging is also a necessary concept to reduce the overall development<br>
time and development resources, but the design cost required to do so<br>
can also increase the chip cost.<br>
The present invention can provide a solution to all of the above<br>
problems. The dynamic optimization technology for a hardware space<br>
according to the present invention creates circuits fonensuring reliability<br>
and quality only when such circuits are required and therefore can<br>
minimize the effect on total cost. Circuits for simplifying debugging are<br>
usually no longer required after debugging is completed. Conversely, it<br>
is sufficient to generate circuits for debugging at the necessary timing<br>
for such circuits, which can be achieved extremely easily with the<br>
present invention.<br>
In addition, the present invention that is based on architecture<br>
codes makes it possible in the future to dynamically change and<br>
generate test circuits and circuits that realize other functions using a<br>
network or the like, and therefore the cost of constructing a large-scale,<br>
complex system can be greatly reduced. Accordingly, by using a local<br>
terminal including the data processing apparatus according to the<br>
present invention realized on a small chip and connecting a virtual<br>
hardware space with a large amount of resources via a network, it is<br>
possible to realize a great variety of functions with a small local<br>
terminal. This system has a completely opposite concept to current<br>
methods where processing is carried out using hardware resources<br>
present on a network by communicating a large amount of input/output<br>
data via the network, and this system aims to realize the hardware<br>
resources present on the network on the local terminal. Accordingly, by<br>
the present invention, it is possible to provide a system with a number<br>
of advantages, such as a reduction in the transmission and reception of<br>
a large amount of input/output data and therefore a reduced load on a<br>
network, and the ability to protect the secrecy of data.<br>
Also, although an example where the present invention is applied<br>
tc an LSI based on semiconductor integrated circuit technology has been<br>
described above, the present invention can be applied to all kinds of<br>
data processing systems or apparatuses that form circuit networks.<br>
That is, applicability of the present invention is not limited to data<br>
processing apparatuses based on circuit technology at the electrical or<br>
electronic level and the present invention can be applied to all data<br>
processing systems that form networks based on optical, biological,<br>
molecular and atomic, or genetic structures.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
