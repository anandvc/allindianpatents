Low-flammability safety belts containing phosphorus-modified polyester fibers and use of these polyester fibers for manufacturing safety belts.<br>
The present invention relates to safety belts which are low-flammable owing to the use of phosphorus-modified polyester fibers.<br>
In recent years, safety belts have become a standard component of modern vehicles, in particular motor vehicles. Owing to increased safety requirements, the number of safety belts used in a vehicle has increased considerably.<br>
Vehicles in the context of this description are taken to mean all types of land vehicles, water craft and aircraft.<br>
Safety belts are principally manufactured from fabrics which consist essentially of high-tenacity polyester fibers.<br>
In the development of textile safety components for the automobile, strength is of major importance. However, in the event of an accident, the safety belt remains in the interior of the vehicle as relatively large surface areas of textile. In the event of fire, this represents a hazard to the occupants similar to curtains in the residential area.<br>
The topic of low-flammability safety belts went long unconsidered. JP-A-07-166,422 proposes polyester yarns containing phosphorus compounds which are also suitable, inter alia, for manufacturing safety belts. The previously known yarns contain coarse-grain particles of 1 to 100 µm,<br><br>
which must be termed very large in comparison to typical fiber diameters, such as about 30 µm. These particles can lead to a sawing effect, particularly at concentrations of up to 5% by weight. In addition, these fibers have very high breaking elongations, at more than 30 %.<br>
JP-A-91-167,312 discloses low-flammability polyester fibers for manufacturing fabrics, which themselves are suitable for manufacturing airbags. The disclosure in this publication only describes airbags made of coated fabrics. No suggestion of using fabrics of this type for manufacturing safety belts can be found in the publication.<br>
In view of the increasing safety requirements in vehicles, there is a need for low-flammability safety belts, in particular to minimize the risk of fire present in accidents and the associated hazard to the vehicle occupants.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide yarns and fabrics for safety belts which have the necessary safety properties of known yarns and fabrics but also have flame-retardant properties.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that low-flammability safety belts may be manufactured by using low-flammability and phosphorus-modified polyester filaments.<br>
The invention provides safety belts comprising a fabric which comprises high-tenacity filament yarns made of phosphorus-modified copolyester having a yarn linear density of less than 2000 dtex, having an individual filament linear density of less than or equal to 25 dtex and having a breaking elongation of less than 30%, the phosphorus-modified copolyester comprising a bifunctional phosphorus compound in an amount of 0.1 to 5% by weight, preferably 0.2 to 0.8% by weight, based on the amount of phosphorus, in the polymer chain.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a safety belt comprising a fabric with at least two thread systems of warp and weft yam bands, each of these thread systems comprising at least 90% of high-tenacity filament yams made of phosphoms-modified copolyester having a yam linear density of less than 2000 dtex, having an individual filament linear density of less than or equal to 25 dtex and having a breaking elongation of less than 30%, the phosphoms-modified copolyester containing a bifunctional phosphorus compound in an amount of 0.1 to 5% by weight, based on the amount of phosphorus in the polymer chain.<br><br>
The safety belts of the invention can comprise a relatively small proportion, or can consist completely, of the above defined high-tenacity and phosphorus-modified filament yarns. Thus, it is possible, for example, to make up only one of the thread systems making up the safety belts of the invention entirely or only partly from these yarns. Those skilled in the art can determine, on the basis of routine experiments, the amount necessary in the individual case of the above defined high-tenacity and phosphorus-modified filament yarns, for example taking as a basis the desired strength of the fabric.<br>
Use of the phosphorus-modified polyester fibers lowers the flammability of the fabrics manufactured therefrom. Low-flammabilty fabric in the context of this description is taken to mean a loomstate fabric which has, in the flammability testing as specified in DIN 4102/B2, a total burning time which is shorter by at least the factor 5, preferably by the factor 10, than that of a comparable loomstate fabric of non-phosphorus-modified polyester and which does not afterburn after a flame is applied for 3 and 15 seconds as specified in DIN 54336 or for 3 seconds as specified in DIN 54333.<br>
In addition to the above high-tenacity and phosphorus-modified filament yarns, some of the yarns used in the safety belts of the invention can comprise non-phosphorus-modlfied and high-tenacity filament yarns.<br>
Preferably, at least one direction, e.g. the weft direction or the warp direction, of the fabric is made up completely of the above defined high-tenacity and phosphorus-modified filament yams, particularly preferably both directions are made up of filament yarns of this type.<br>
The safety belts of the invention can consist of fabrics comprising two or more thread systems; preferably, two thread systems are provided (warp and weft yarn sheets).<br><br>
Very particularly preferably, fabrics are used whicli consist of at least twc thread systems, each of which consists at least 90% of the above defined high-tenacity and phosphorus-modified filament yams.<br>
Particular preference is given to safety belts as defined above wrhose high-tenacity filament yarns have a tenacity of more than 60cN/tex, preferably of more than 65 cN/tex, and a breaking elongation of 10 to 25%.<br>
The breaking force and the breaking elongation of the polyester yarns used were measured as described in DIN 53 83 Part 1.<br>
Particular preference is given to safety belts, as defined above, whose high-tenacity filament yarns have a hot-air shrinkage of less than 20% at 200X.<br>
The heat shrinkage (hot-air shrinkage) of the polyester yarns used is measured as described in DIN 53 866 Part 3, at a temperature of 200'C on free-hanging yarn samples with a treatment time of 15 minutes. 10 m hanks at a reel tension of 0.5 cN/tex are used.<br>
A further particularly preferred embodiment relates to safety belts, as defined above, whose fabric, in addition to high-tenacity filament yarns of phosphorus-modified copolyester, comprises monofilaments having a diameter of less than or equal to 0.5 mm, the monofilaments comprising phosphorus-modified copolyester which contains a bifunctional phosphorus compound in an amount of 0.1 to 5% by weight, preferably 0.2 to 0.8% by weight, based on the amount of phosphorus, in the polymer chain.<br>
The monofilaments give the safety belt an enhanced high elastic transverse stiffness; this prevents twisting of the safety belt.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the safety belt of the invention.<br><br><br>
a breaking elongation of more than 15 % and/or which have a hot-air shrinkage at 180°C of less than 20%.<br>
Very particularly preferably, fabrics are used which comprise high-tenacity filament yarns which are size-free and made of phosphorus-modified copoiyester.<br>
The uncoated fabrics of the invention can have different weaves, preferably a twill weave, in particular a 2/2 twill weave, or a rep weave. Fabrics having these weaves are known per se.<br>
The safety belts of the invention preferably comprise fabric having a mass per unit area of less than 100 g per running meter at 50 mm width and a fabric thickness of less than 1.5 mm.<br><br>
The high-tenacity filament yarns used according to the invention coniprise polyester filaments which are made up of a phosphorus-modified copoiyester.<br>
The copoiyester can be any type of spinnable copolymer having repeating ester groups, provided it contains in the polymer chain a bifunctional phosphorus compound in the amount specified above.<br>
