TITLE<br>
LENS ARRANGEMENT FOR INTEGRATION INTO A WALL, WALL-INTEGRATED DEVICE WITH A CONNECTION HOUSING AND THE LENS ARRANGEMENT, METHOD OF INSTALLING THE DEVICE, AND TRANSPORTATION INSTALLATION WITH THE DEVICE<br>
APPLICANT<br>
INVENTIO AG<br>
Seestrasse 55 <br>
CH-6052 ergiswil<br>
Switzerland <br>
Nationality : a Swiss company<br>
The following specification particularly describes<br>
the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
IP4002<br>
1<br>
Lens arrangement for integration into a wall, wall-integrated device with a connection housing and the lens arrangement, method of installing the device, and transportation installation with the device.<br>
The invention relates to a wall-integrable lens arrangement according to Claim 1, a wall-integrated device with such a lens arrangement and with a connection housing according to Claim 2, a method of installing the device according to Claim 11, and a transportation installation with a device according to one of claims 2 to 10.<br>
The terms “wall-integrable” and “wall-integrated” are to be understood as meaning that the lens arrangement lies largely, but not necessarily completely, within the bounding surfaces of a wall.<br>
Wall-integrated devices of this type are used, for example, for monitoring and/or lighting areas of a room.<br>
US 6,785,053 describes a device of this type. A connection housing that contains a radiation-emitting element is arranged essentially on one side of a wall. A lens arrangement has a lens head that is transparent to the radiation and is arranged at least partly in the area of the other side of the wall and guides the radiation onto this other side of the wall. The connection housing has a housing-side attachment with a housing-side or housing-attached connection member in the form of an inside thread.<br><br>
IP4002<br>
2<br>
The lens arrangement has on the lens side adjoining the lens head an attachment with a lens-attached connection member in the form of an external thread that is complementary to the said internal thread. The wall has a wall breakthrough through which the lens-side attachment projects. The two connecting members are mutually engaged in such manner that the connection box and the lens arrangement are fixed relative to each other and in the wall breakthrough.<br>
Devices of this type can be used, for example, for lighting the lower area of transportation installations such as escalators, moving walks, and elevators. When so used, a large number of lens arrangements are inserted in breakthroughs in a wall that is arranged at the side of the step-band of an escalator or the pallet-band of a moving walk. The wall can be a skirt panel or a balustrade wall. The lens heads are so formed that they can only be inserted into the wall breakthrough from the step-side or pallet-side of the wall that faces toward the escalator or moving walk. The connection box is located on the side of the wall that faces away from the escalator or moving walk.<br>
When the device known from US 6,785,053 is used in the area of a transportation installation, various disadvantages arise.<br>
In particular, the device cannot be installed in the wall breakthrough in a pre-specified position regarding rotation or angle relative to an axis perpendicular to the wall. This would, however, be desirable to direct the radiation into a particular area.<br><br>
IP4002<br>
3<br>
Disadvantages of this, and similar known, devices that are provided for lighting escalators and moving walks are to be seen in that they are manufactured from numerous constructional components so that their assembly and their installation are relatively complicated and therefore time-intensive, and that many installation steps have to take place in situ.<br>
The task of the invention is to be seen in avoiding the disadvantages of the state of the art by;<br>
-	an improved wall-integrable lens arrangement of the type stated at the outset for such a device;<br>
-	an improved wall-integrated device of the type stated at<br>
the outset with such a lens arrangement;<br>
-	a method of installing the new device; and<br>
-	proposing a use for the new device.<br>
According to the invention, this task is solved as follows:<br>
-	for the lens arrangement, by the characteristics of the characterizing part of Claim 1;<br>
-	for the device, by the characteristics of the characterizing part of Claim 2;<br>
-	for installation, by the characteristics of Claim 11; and<br>
-	for the transportation installation, by the characteristics of Claim 12.<br><br>
IP4002<br>
4<br>
Preferred further developments of the new device and of the new transportation installation are defined by the dependent claims.<br>
In the invention, the wall breakthrough on the one hand and the housing attachment or lens attachment on the other hand are formed complementarily but not central-symmetrically and in such manner that the lens element is arranged in a pre-specified rotational position in the wall breakthrough and is secured in this position.<br>
The device according to the invention is of simple construction and no problem to install. Without additional tools or special skills or special attention it is possible to install the device in a pre-specified horizontal or rotational position since to a certain extent it takes up the predefined desired position of its own accord.<br>
The new device is particularly suitable for applications in association with the use of radiation for lighting or illuminating or monitoring transportation installations, which means if the wall is a wall of a transportation installation that is located in the area of objects or persons that move relative to the wall and therefore relative to the lens head. Installing the device in a certain pre-specified rotational position avoids the light falling in an undesired direction and on the one hand dazzling the persons being transported while on the other hand the foot area, where lighting would be desirable, remains unlit.<br><br>
IP4002<br>
5<br>
Highly advantageous is that thanks to the pre-specified position of the device it is possible to build into the lens arrangement reflectors or other elements that influence the radiation which serve to direct and/or influence the radiation and with which the radiation can be very precisely directed and/or guided.<br>
It has proved advantageous to use a lens arrangement whose lens head is so formed as to be a flush continuation of the surface of the wall.  A concave or convex embodiment of the lens heads can, however, also be implemented. In the case of a flat wall, such a lens head is also arranged flat and flush with the wall surface. This facilitates cleaning of the wall and of the visible part of the lens head and prevents deliberate damage that can be caused through objects moving relative to the wall. In addition, acts of vandalism are less readily provoked and more difficult to commit. This notwithstanding, round-head or lens-head or inwardly curved embodiments of the lens head are feasible.-<br>
In a preferred exemplary embodiment the wall breakthrough has a wall contact surface and the lens- or housing-end attachment that projects through the wall has an attachment contact surface. The contact surfaces that are provided for mutual contact are formed rotation-asymmetrically relative to an axis perpendicular to the wall. As a result, provided that the wall breakthrough is correctly and exactly positioned and executed, the lens arrangement takes up the desired position more or less of its own accord. In their installed state, the two contact surfaces touch each other at least partly and are preferably so pressed against each other that the lens arrangement and the connection housing are perfectly fastened to each other and to the wall.<br><br>
IP4002<br>
6<br>
To create the wall breakthrough and the attachment touching it, it is particularly advantageous if the wall breakthrough and/or the attachment touching it is bounded by two partly overlapping cylindrical surfaces since this allows working with conventional manufacturing methods and with circular relative movements between workpiece and tool.<br>
In a preferred exemplary embodiment, the wall breakthrough is an essentially cylindrical bored hole which in at least one sector has at least one tapering wall contact surface over part of the length of its bore. The attachment touching the wall breakthrough has a cylindrical outer wall that is complementary to the wall contact surface and has attachment contact surfaces that rest against the latter.<br>
In a particularly advantageous embodiment of the new device, the attachment that touches the bounding surface is the lens-end attachment, and the lens-end connecting member is a thread, preferably an external thread or an internal thread.<br>
In a frequent application of the invention, the radiation-emitting element is a light-emitting element and the lens head is made at least partly, or fully (completely), of a material that is transparent to light.<br>
Further details and advantages of the invention are explained below in relation to exemplary embodiments and by reference to the drawings. Shown are in<br><br>

side.<br>
Fig. 1A shows an escalator that connects a lower level El with an upper level E2 and that is equipped with a device 1 according to the invention. The escalator has a step band 2 with a large number of steps that are connected to each other. Arranged on each side of the movable step band 2 is a locationally fixed skirt panel 3. As lateral boundaries the escalator 1 has in the lower part the skirt panels 3 and in the upper part locationally fixed balustrades 4 arranged at the top of which is generally a handrail that is movable with the step band 2.<br>
The skirt panels 3 are formed of low walls each of which has several wall breakthroughs 5 arranged at distances from each other each of which serves the purpose of accommodating one lens arrangement 6 according to the invention as shown for example in Figures 3A to 3D. The wall breakthroughs 5 must always be arranged above the dotted line that connects the edges of the steps as shown in Fig. IB.<br>
Instead of on an escalator with a step band 2, the device according to the invention can also be used on a moving walk with a pallet band or conveyor belt.<br>
Fig. 2A shows a skirt panel 3 or a wall 3 with one of the wall breakthroughs 5. The wall breakthrough 5 is not a cylindrical bored hole but can be made from such a one. Whereas a normal bored hole is cylindrical, the wall<br><br>
IP4002<br>
9<br>
breakthrough 5 is not cylindrical in shape, which results from the fact that on at least two opposite sides, in Figures 2A to 2D left and right, the hole has wall contact surfaces in the form of conical surfaces 5.1.<br>
Fig. 2B shows a wall breakthrough 5 in which the wall contact surface 5.1 extends over the entire axial length or the entire wall thickness of the skirt panel 3. Fig. 2C shows a wall breakthrough 5 in which the wall contact surface 5.1 extends over only part of the axial length or wall thickness of the skirt panel 3. Fig. 2D shows diagrammatically the manufacture of the wall contact surfaces 5.1 with the aid of a conical drill or cutter or punching tool which is used in a first and subsequently in a second processing step, the longitudinal axis of the drill in the first processing step being offset in one direction relative to the longitudinal axis of the original bored hole and in the second processing step in the opposite direction.<br>
Figures 3A to 3D show a lens arrangement 20 according to the invention that is intended, and takes such form, as to be accommodated in a wall breakthrough 5.<br>
Fig. 3A shows the lens arrangement 2 0 with a lens head 6, one or two lens-side attachments 6.1, and a lens-side connecting member 6.2 that in the present example is fastened to the lens.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment shown, the lens head is bounded by a flat bounding surface that in the installed state is<br><br>
IP4002<br>
10<br>
arranged flush with the surface of the wall 3 of the skirt panel that faces the step band 2. The lens arrangement 20 need not have such a surface-integrable bounding surface but a lens arrangement of this form proves particularly advantageous since the radiation yield is satisfactory and the lens head is thereby largely protected against damage. A lens head arranged sunk in the wall would impair the radiation, encourage soiling of the skirt panel and lens head, and hinder cleaning; while a projecting lens head might possibly improve the radiation yield it would also be highly susceptible to damage. A concave or convex embodiment is nevertheless feasible as is also a colored embodiment and/or an embodiment with many or few facets.<br>
At least the surface of the lens head 6 facing the step band 2 is transparent to radiation that according to Fig. 4 is emitted by a radiation-emitting element 10, for example a lamp, that is arranged in a connection box 7. The connection box 7 is described in greater detail below by reference to Fig. 4.<br>
In the installed state, the lens-side attachment 6.2 is intended to project through the wall breakthrough 5.<br>
Alternatively, the lens-side attachment 6.1 or a box-side attachment 8 of the connection box 7 can only partially project through the wall breakthrough 5 or only the box side attachment 8 of the connection box 7 can project through the wall breakthrough 5.<br>
In the present exemplary embodiment, the lens-side or lens-attached connecting member 6.2 is formed from an external thread and intended in its installed stated to be engaged<br><br>
IP4002<br>
11<br>
with a complementary housing-side connecting member in the form of an internal thread that is formed on the connection-side attachment of the connection box 7.<br>
The lens arrangement 20 or more specifically the lens-side attachment 6.1 is formed complementary to the wall breakthrough 5 and therefore has two attachment contact surfaces in the form of conical surfaces which are situated opposite each other.<br>
The lens arrangement 2 0 can therefore as desired only be arranged in a pre-specified rotational position in the wall breakthrough and also behaves in more or less self-centering manner when being installed.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a device according to the invention with a wall 3 whose surface 3.1 faces the step band 2 and which has the wall breakthrough 5 with the conical wall contact surfaces 5.1. Furthermore, the lens arrangement 20 is shown with the lens head 6, the lens-side attachment 6.1 with the attachment contact surfaces, and the lens-side or lens-attached connection member or external thread 6.2. Also shown is the connection box 7 with the box-side attachment 8 which is provided with the box-side connection member 8.2 or internal thread 8.2.<br>
Assembly takes place in simple manner in that from the side of the wall 3 that faces the step band 2 the lens element 20 is pushed into the wall breakthrough 5 in such manner that the wall contact surfaces and the attachment contact surfaces come to rest against each other. The connection<br><br>
IP4002<br>
12<br>
box 7 is then screwed tight, only the connection box 7 but not the lens arrangement 2 0 turning. This type of installation is faster and simpler than installation of conventional devices in which several nuts and welded studs are used, as well as which savings are made since no further bolts, nuts, washers, or welded studs are needed.<br>
Figures 5A and 5B show a variant of the invention in which the connection-box 11 has a fastening means 13, specifically a connection-box fastening bracket or connection-box fastening holder. With such fastening means 13 greater load-bearing capacity and improved mechanical stability are achieved. Thanks to use of these fastening means 13 a larger and/or heavier connection box 11 can be used with greater capacity for building in electronics or with greater or more powerful transmitters and receivers or larger light sources. The fastening means 13 is bolted to the lens-side connecting member or external thread 6.2 with the aid of a nut or plastic nut 12 which forms the box-side connecting member. The fastening means 13 has a round hole that allows it to be pushed onto the external thread 6.2 and fixed non-rotatably with the said nut 12. With the aid of screws 14, the connection box 11 itself is assembled with the fastening means 13.<br>
Arranged in the connection box is the radiation-emitting element 10 for which various embodiments are possible, it being possible to use the device according to the invention for different purposes depending on the selected radiation-emitting element 10. Possible in particular are lamps and light sources, light barriers, LEDs, light curtains, infrared light barriers, transmitters and receivers, ultrasound, and radar.<br><br></td>
