TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
INDUCTION PLASMA SYNTHESIS OF NANOPOWDERS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to the plasma synthesis of<br>
nanopowders using induction plasma technology. More specifically, but not<br>
exclusively, the present invention relates to a process for the synthesis of<br>
nanopowders of various materials such as metals, alloys, ceramics and<br>
composites by induction plasma technology, using organometallic<br>
compounds, chlorides, bromides, fluorides, iodides, nitrites, nitrates, oxalates<br>
and carbonates as precursors.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The plasma synthesis of nanopowders has attracted<br>
ncreasing attention over the past few years. Numerous processes have<br>
been developed for preparing metal, alloy and ceramic-based nanopowders<br>
using a wide variety of technologies including plasma discharge, arc<br>
discharge, electro-explosion, self propagating high temperature synthesis,<br>
combustion synthesis, electric discharge, spray pyrolysis, sol-gel, and<br>
mechanical attrition.<br>
[0003]	High temperature plasma processing routes are based on<br>
the concept of heating the reactant precursors (in solid, liquid or<br>
vapor/gaseous form), to relatively high temperatures followed by rapid cooling<br>
of the reaction products through their mixing with a cold gas stream as in the<br>
"high intensity turbulent quench technique" or through their contacting with a<br>
cold surface on which the nanoparticles form and deposit. The use of a<br>
"highly turbulent gas quench zone" has been previously described by Boulos<br>
etal. in U.S. 20050217421 and U.S. 20030143153 as filed on March 25, 2005<br><br>
WO 2006/079213	PCT/CA2006/000110<br>
2<br>
and December 6, 2002 respectively. A common objective to all of these<br>
processes is the desire to closely control the particle morphology, the particle<br>
size distribution, and the agglomeration of the powders obtained. However, a<br>
drawback of the use of traditional "cold-surface" condensation techniques is<br>
that the nature and the temperature of the condensation surface changes with<br>
the build-up of the condensed nanopowder layer.<br>
[0004]	U.S. Patent 6,379,419 issued to Celik et al. on April 30,<br>
2002 discloses a transferred arc thermal plasma based vapor condensation<br>
method for the production of fine and ultra fine powders. The method calls<br>
upon a condensation procedure involving an indirect cooling step and a direct<br>
cooling step. The indirect cooling step involves a cooling surface whereas the<br>
direct cooling step involves the injection of a cooling gas directly onto the<br>
vapor. The use of a cooling surface suffers from the drawback of particle<br>
build-up on the condensation surface.<br>
[0005]	It has been shown theoretically that by controlling the initial<br>
vapor concentration and temperature, residence time of particle nucleation<br>
and growth, and cooling profile, one may have some control on the particle<br>
size distribution and crystallinity. This is shown by Okuyama et al. in AlChE<br>
Journal, 1986, 32 (12), 2010-2019 and Girshick et al. in Plasma Chem. and<br>
Plasma Processing, 1989, 9 (3), 355-369. However, these references remain<br>
silent as to an efficient method for producing nanopowders of well defined<br>
particle size distribution and morphology.<br>
[0006]	There remains a need for an improved process for the<br>
preparation of nanopowders in which the particle morphology, the particle<br>
size distribution, and the agglomeration of particles is readily controlled and<br>
that it easily scalable.<br><br>
WO 2006/079213	PCT/CA2006/000110<br>
3<br>
[0007]	The present invention seeks to meet these and other<br>
needs.<br>
[0008]	The present invention refers to a number of documents,<br>
the content of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009]	The present invention relates to the plasma synthesis of<br>
powders calling upon an induction plasma apparatus comprising an induction<br>
plasma torch and a quenching chamber in which a renewable "gaseous cold<br>
front" is generated, through the injection of a quench gas, and on which the<br>
gaseous reactants/reaction products nucleate. The nucleation generates a<br>
nanopowder which is rapidly transported to a collection chamber by the<br>
moving cold front. It was surprisingly discovered that by generating a<br>
renewable gaseous cold front for nucleating (i.e. condensing) the<br>
reactants/reaction products present in the plasma flow, excellent control of<br>
the morphology and particle size distribution of the resulting nanopowder<br>
could be achieved. Moreover, the use of the renewable gaseous cold front<br>
offers a close control over particle agglomeration.<br>
[0010]	More specifically, as broadly claimed, the present invention<br>
relates to a process for synthesizing a nanopowder comprising feeding a<br>
reactant material into a plasma torch in which is generated a plasma flow<br>
having a temperature sufficiently high to yield a superheated vapour of the<br>
material; transporting the vapour by means of the plasma flow into a<br>
quenching zone; injecting a cold quench gas into the plasma flow in the<br>
quenching zone to form a renewable gaseous cold front; and forming a<br>
nanopowder at the interface between the renewable gaseous cold front and<br>
the plasma flow.<br><br>
WO 2006/079213	PCT/CA2006/000110<br>
4<br>
[0011]	The present invention also relates to an apparatus for<br>
synthesizing nanopowders comprising a plasma torch to generate a plasma<br>
flow and to produce a superheated vapour from reactant material supplied to<br>
the plasma torch in the plasma flow; and a quenching chamber mounted to<br>
the plasma torch downstream therefrom and in fluid communication with said<br>
plasma torch to receive the superheated vapour from the plasma torch, the<br>
quenching chamber being structured to receive a quench gas and to generate<br>
from said quench gas a renewable gaseous cold front to rapidly cool the<br>
superheated vapour, yielding nanopowder.<br>

of the present invention will become more apparent upon reading of the<br>

[0029]	In order to provide a clear and consistent understanding of<br>
the terms used in the present specification, a number of definitions are<br>
provided below. Moreover, unless defined otherwise, all technical and<br>
scientific terms as used herein have the same meaning as commonly<br>
understood to one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention pertains.<br>
[0030]	The use of the word "a" or "an" when used in conjunction<br>
with the term "comprising" in the claims and/or the specification may mean<br>

WO 2006/079213	PCT/CA2006/000110<br>

[0033]	The present invention relates to a novel process for the<br>
plasma synthesis of nanopowders using induction plasma technology and<br>
calling upon a renewable "gaseous cold front", for example a laminar<br>
"gaseous cold front" which serves to rapidly quench the reactants/reaction<br>
products present in the plasma flow. According to a first alternative, the<br>
gaseous cold front may be generated in a quenching chamber comprising a<br>
porous metal or ceramic wall through which is uniformly injected a cold<br>
quench gas. According to a second alternative, the gaseous cold front may<br>
be generated in a quenching chamber comprising a perforated refractory wall.<br>
[0034]	FIG. 1 shows an illustrative embodiment of the induction<br>
plasma assembly, generally identified by the reference 10. The induction<br>
plasma assembly 10 of FIG. 1 comprises an upper section consisting of an<br>
inductively coupled radio frequency (rf) plasma torch 12 in which the<br>
reactants are substantially axially introduced at the feed upper end of the<br>
torch 12 and dispersed into the center of the plasma flow using techniques<br>
well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. A reactor 14, mounted to a<br>
quenching chamber 16, is affixed to the lower end of the plasma torch 12,<br>
generally coaxial with the induction plasma assembly 10 between the plasma<br>
torch 12 and the quenching chamber 16. The induction plasma assembly 10<br>
further comprises a collection chamber 18 coaxially mounted to the lower end<br>
of the quenching chamber 16. Of course, the plasma torch 12, the reactor 14,<br>
the quenching chamber 16 and the collection chamber are in fluid<br>
communication with each other.<br>
[0035]	The plasma is generated using any suitable gas that will<br>
ionize when subject to a high frequency electromagnetic field, such as a radio<br>
frequency field. It is believed to be within the skill of an expert in the art to<br>
select a suitable gas. Suitable inductively coupled radio frequency (rf) plasma<br>
torches are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,919,527 issued to Boulos et al. on<br><br>
WO 2006/079213	PCT/CA2006/000110<br>
9<br>
July 19, 2005. Other suitable plasma torches as contemplated by the process<br>
of the present invention include high performance induction plasma torches<br>
such as the one disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,200,595 issued to Boulos et<br>
a/, on April 6,1993.<br>
[0036]	The reactant feed may be in the form of fine solid particles,<br>
liquid droplets or in the vapor/gaseous phase. In the case of a solid feed, the<br>
reactant, upon entering the plasma flow, is melted and vaporized forming a<br>
vapor cloud which is superheated to a reaction temperature. In the case of a<br>
liquid feed, the heat load on the plasma is substantially limited to that required<br>
to heat up the liquid droplets to the vaporization temperature and<br>
superheating the vapor to a reaction temperature. In the case of a gaseous<br>
feed, the heat load on the plasma is substantially limited to that required to<br>
superheat the gaseous feed to the reaction temperature. The plasma flow<br>
axially delivers the vapor cloud to the reactor 14 in which it may be further<br>
mixed with other components present in the vapor/gaseous phase. In an<br>
embodiment of the present invention, a further component may be an<br>
oxidizing agent such as oxygen, a carburizing agent such as methane or<br>
acetylene, or a nitrating agent such as ammonia. Of course, the other<br>
components may be concomitantly introduced into the plasma torch 12 with<br>
the reactant feed, or introduced in the reactor section 14, or in the quench<br>
section 16, using techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0037]	The plasma flow carries the reactants/reaction products<br>
emerging from the plasma torch 12 into a reactor 14 in fluid communication<br>
therewith. In an embodiment of the present invention, the reactor 14 may be<br>
a high temperature graphite/refractory lined reactor. It is believed to be within<br>
the skill of an expert in the art to select other suitable reactors and reactor<br>
configurations. In the event that the feed was concomitantly introduced into<br>
the plasma torch 12 mixed with other components, the reactor 14 allows for<br><br>
WO 2006/079213	PCT/CA2006/000110<br>
10<br>
any reaction to be completed. Alternatively, the superheated feed exits the<br>
plasma torch 12 at a reaction temperature and is carried by the plasma flow<br>
into the reactor 14 where it is mixed and reacted with other components.<br>
[0038]	Upon exiting the reactor 14, the reactants/reaction<br>
products are carried into a quenching chamber 16. In an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the quenching chamber 16 may comprise a porous metal<br>
or ceramic wall section 17 through which a cold quench gas and/or reactants<br>
are injected. Alternatively, the quenching chamber 16 may comprise a<br>
perforated or slotted refractory wall section through which the cold quench<br>
gas and/or reactants may be injected. It is believed to be within the skill of an<br>
expert in the art to determine and select other suitable quenching chamber<br>
configurations. The injection of the cold quench gas, mixed with or without<br>
other reactants, generates a mobile and continuously renewable laminar<br>
"gaseous cold front" on which the gaseous reactants/reaction products<br>
condense. Such a condensation results in a nucleation of reactants/reaction<br>
products generating a nanopowder. The "gaseous cold front" is renewable<br>
since it is in movement; the movement being imparted by the continuous<br>
injection of cold quench gas and by the movement of the plasma flow. The<br>
physical separation of the reaction section (i.e. the plasma torch 12 and/or the<br>
reactor 14) and the quench section (quenching chamber 16) provides for a<br>
better means of controlling the location of the condensation front over which<br>
nanopowder formation occurs. The gaseous cold front is further illustrated in<br>
FIGS. 3, 4, 6 and 7. In an embodiment of the present invention, argon was<br>
used as the quench gas. It is believed to be within the skill of an expert in the<br>
art to determine and select other suitable quench gases.<br>
[0039]	The quench rate to which the gaseous reactants/reaction<br>
products are exposed will depend on the temperature of the quench gas and<br>
its flow rate. The flow rate of the quench gas also affects the position of the<br><br>
WO 2006/079213	PCT/CA2006/000110<br>
11<br>
cold front within the quenching chamber 16 and the manner in which the cold<br>
front interacts with the hot flow of plasma gases emerging from the reactor 14<br>
and comprising the reactants/reaction products. The nanopowder is carried<br>
away on the mobile cold front into the collection chamber 18. Of course, the<br>
plasma gases will also be at significantly lower temperatures, due to their<br>
interaction with the cold front, upon reaching the collection chamber 18.<br>
[0040]	The process according to the present invention involves<br>
the concept of a renewable "gaseous cold front" as an effective means of<br>
controlling the uniformity and particle size distribution of the produced<br>
nanopowder. Furthermore, the possibility for condensed nanoparticle<br>
agglomeration is significantly reduced since the nanopowder is rapidly<br>
evacuated, substantially upon its formation, from the quenching chamber 16<br>
to the collection chamber 18 by the gaseous cold front at present comprised<br>
of plasma gases and the quench gas. Moreover, by using a high volume<br>
quench gas flow rate, it is possible to maintain the generated nanopowder in<br>
dilute suspension while it is being evacuated from the quenching chamber 16<br>
into the collection chamber 18. Additionally, by maintaining a dilute<br>
suspension, both the deposition of the nanopowder on the walls of the<br>
quenching chamber 16 and nanoparticle agglomeration through inter-particle<br>
collision are substantially eliminated. Typical temperature and flow fields as<br>
observed in the plasma torch 12, the reactor 14 and the quenching chamber<br>
16 respectively, are illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4 for quench gas flow rates of<br>
400 and 800 standard liters per minute (slpm). These figures clearly<br>
demonstrate the constricting effect of the "gaseous cold front" on the hot<br>
plasma gas stream. The more intense the gaseous cold front, the greater the<br>
constricting effect. Moreover, as may be observed from FIGS. 3 and 6, an<br>
increase in the quench gas flow rate results in a significant increase in the<br>
thickness of the cold boundary layer and a gradual displacement of the cold<br>
front toward the center of the plasma flow. Furthermore, the increase in the<br><br>
WO 2006/079213	PCT/CA2006/000110<br>

thickness of the cold boundary layer is accompanied by the development of<br>
steep temperature gradients at the interface of the cold front and the plasma<br>
flow, where the nucleation of the reactants/reaction products takes place.<br>
While not shown in these figures, changing the length of the reactor,<br>
combined with a close control of the quench gas flow rate offers tangible<br>
means of controlling the position of the cold front in the reactor assembly and<br>
accordingly the exact moment at which the reactants/reaction products are<br>
subjected to rapid cooling. In the case wherein the reactor 14 is absent, the<br>
reactants/reaction products are substantially immediately exposed to the cold<br>
front following their vaporization in the plasma torch 12. In the illustrative<br>
embodiment as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the plasma gas was composed of an<br>
argon/hydrogen mixture (80%vol /20%vol) whereas the gaseous cold front<br>
was created using argon which was injected through the porous metal wall of<br>
the quenching chamber 16.<br>
[0041]	A typical "gaseous cold front" and the associated quench<br>
gas concentration isocontours as observed in the quenching chamber 16 is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 6. Furthermore, typical isocontours of reaction product<br>
cooling rate, as produced when the hot plasma gases comprising the reaction<br>
products collide with the gaseous cold front, are illustrated in FIG. 7. These<br>
figures illustrate a substantially uniform, renewable and mobile cooling gas<br>
front across which the reaction products are exposed to high cooling rates in<br>
the order of about 105to about 106 K/s. Such a gaseous cold front allows for<br>
particle nucleation to occur at the interface with the hot plasma gases and the<br>
formation of a nanopowder having a substantially uniform particle size<br>
distribution, representative examples of which are illustrated in FIGS. 8-10.<br>
[0042]	The process of the present invention offers the additional<br>
advantages of being compact, scalable and simple to operate. Moreover, the<br>
reactor assembly 10 can be readily modified depending on the needs and<br><br>
WO 2006/079213	PCT/CA2006/000110<br>
13<br>
type of nanopowder to be produced. Vapor, liquid or solid precursors may be<br>
used in the process according to the present invention with the produced<br>
nanopowder being either of identical or different chemical composition as that<br>
of the precursor. In the case wherein the produced nanopowder is of identical<br>
chemical composition, the process is limited to the vaporization and<br>
condensation of the feed generating nanoparticles thereof. In the case<br>
wherein the produced nanopowder is of different chemical composition, the<br>
feed was reacted with a second reactant which can be either injected in the<br>
plasma torch 12 or introduced in the reactor 14. Alternatively, the quench gas<br>
may react with the vaporized feed in which case it serves a dual function. As<br>
illustrated in FIG. 2, the reactor 14 can be removed such that the plasma feed<br>
comprising the gaseous reactants or alternatively the gaseous<br>
reactants/reaction products, are brought directly into the quenching chamber<br>
16. If the feed material is to be chemically modified, a non-limiting example of<br>
which is oxidation, the presence of the reactor might be required. It is<br>
believed to be within the skill of an expert to select an appropriate reactor<br>
assembly depending on the type of nanopowder to be produced.<br><br>

EXPERIMENTAL<br>
[0043]	A number of examples are provided hereinbelow,<br>
illustrating the efficiency of a renewable laminar gaseous cold front in the<br>
synthesis of a number of metallic and ceramic nanopowders using induction<br>
plasma technology.<br>
[0044]	Synthesis of nanopowders using solid precursors.<br>
[0045]	An argon/hydrogen induction plasma flow is generated<br>
using a 50 mm internal diameter induction plasma torch with an oscillator<br>
frequency of 3 MHz, a plasma plate power of 65 kW, and a reactor pressure<br>
of approximately 500 Torr. Different metals, in the form of a micron-sized<br>
metallic powder, were axially injected into the center of the plasma discharge<br>
and vaporized. As the hot plasma gases comprising the vaporized metal<br>
emerge from the reactor, they are intercepted by the gaseous cold front which<br>
is created by means of injecting argon through the porous walls of the<br>
quenching chamber. The interaction of the hot plasma gases with the<br>
gaseous cold front gives rise to a nucleation phenomenon at the interface hot<br>
plasma gases/gaseous cold front, leading to the formation of a nanopowder<br>
having a well defined particle size distribution. The continuously moving<br>
gaseous cold front, now also made-up of cooled plasma gases, rapidly<br>
evacuates the nanopowder to a collection chamber where it can be collected<br>
on standard sintered metal or cloth filter elements. The experimental results<br>
as obtained for aluminum, nickel and tungsten powders are summarized<br>
hereinbelow in Table 1. Data regarding plasma plate power, precursor feed<br>
rates, quench gas rates, and physical characteristics of the collected<br>
nanopowder such as their Specific Surface Area (as measured using the BET<br>
method) and particle mean diameter are also provided. The Specific Surface<br>
Area is expressed in terms of m2/g of collected powder. The mean particle<br><br>

size distributions, obtained by light scattering analysis using a Malvern<br>
Mastersizer™ instrument are illustrated in FIGS. 8-10 respectively.<br>
