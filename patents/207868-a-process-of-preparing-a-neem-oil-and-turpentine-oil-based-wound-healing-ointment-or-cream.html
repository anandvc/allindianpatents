The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF   INVENTION<br>
This invention  relates to a process of preparing a neem oil and<br>
turpentine oil   based  wound healing ointment or cream.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Antibacterial and antifungal properties of neem oil and turpentine oil are known. It is, however, difficult and cumbersome to apply and retain neem oil and turpentine oil on wounds for healing purpose due to the free flowing nature of the oils. Therefore, use of neem oil and turpentine oil for wound healing application is inconvenient, cumbersome and time consuming. Turpentine oil is also known to act as maggot repellent. Regeneration of tissues is an integral part of healing. Activities such as cell proliferation, smoothening of the skin or restoration of the epithelial cells also facilitate healing. Linseed oil, zinc oxide and salicylic acid are reported to possess these activities. Antiseptic properties of salicylic acid and zinc oxide are also reported.

100°C;<br>
(ii)    mixing   10 to 20% by weight of neem oil and turpentine oil in the<br>
volume ratio  1:4 to 4:1 and 5 to 15% by weight of linseed oil with the<br>
additive   base melt under stirring followed by cooling the mixture   to<br>
20 to 50 ° C;<br>
(iii)   and further mixing    the mixture obtained by step (ii) with   1.5 to<br>
3.0% by weight of zinc  oxide, 0.5 to 2.0% by  weight of salicylic acid<br>
and 0.5 to 2.0% by weight of potassium nitrate under stirring.<br>
Preferably the process comprises melting the additive base namely bees wax  and petroleum jelly   in the weight    ratio   15 : 40 to 25 : 70.<br>
Preferably the process comprises the steps of<br>
ia)     melting the additive  base, namely bees  wax and petroleum jelly in<br>
the weight ratio 23 : 77;<br><br>
iia) mixing 16.5% by weight of neem oil and turpentine oil in the volume ratio 3:1 and 10.0% by weight of linseed oil with the additive base melt  followed by cooling;<br>
iiia) and further mixing the mixture obtained by step (iia) with 1.65% by weight of zinc oxide, 0.8% by weight of salicylic acid and 0.8% by weight of potassium nitrate.<br>
Preferably the additive base is melted  at 75 ° C.<br>
Preferably  the mixture of step (ii) or (iia)   is cooled   to 40 ° C.<br>
Besides bees wax and petroleum jelly other additive base such as paraffin wax, salts and esters of fatty acids, fatty alcohols or hydrogenated wax may also be used in the  ointment or cream of the   invention.<br>
According to the invention there is also provided a method of treatment of wounds by applying topically the neem oil and turpentine oil based wound healing  ointment  or cream described above.<br><br>
The medicament of the invention may be used on any mammalian species.<br>
The following experimental example is illustrative of the invention but not limitative of the scope thereof.<br>
Example 1 Bees wax (16.5 % by weight) and petroleum jelly (53.75% by weight) were melted at 75 °C. Neem oil and turpentine oil (16.5% by weight in the volume ratio 3:1) and linseed oil (10.0% by weight) were mixed with the melt under stirring for half an hour. After cooling the mixture to 40°C , zinc oxide (1.65% by weight), salicylic acid (0.8% by weight) and potassium nitrate ( 0.8% by weight) were further mixed with the above mixture under stirring for one hour to form an ointment. The wound healing efficacy of the ointment was studied on fresh wounds in dogs and cattle and the results  were as given in the following Tables:<br><br>
Table 1<br>
Data   on wound  healing in dogs<br><br>
Medicament	Time    taken    to start wound healing  in days (Mean ± S.E)	Time taken for complete wound healing in days (Mean ±SE)<br>
Neem        oil        and turpentine    oil in the volume ratio 3:1	4.41 ±0.51	21.34 ±2.64<br>
Ointment of Example 1	2.83 ±0.33	16.50 ±2.38<br>
Acrilin ointment	2.33 ±0.33	15.33 ±1.05<br>
Table 2 Data on  wound healing in cattle<br><br>
Medicament	Time    taken    to start wound healing  in days (Mean ± S.E)	Time taken for complete wound healing in days (Mean ±SE)<br>
Neem        oil        and turpentine   oil   in the volume ratio 3:1	5.12 ± 0.48	36.2 ±2.80<br>
Ointment of Example 1	2.67 ± 0.33	29.5 ± 2.29<br>
Acrilin ointment	3.0 ±0.26	30.33 ±2.65<br>
The frequency of application of the medicaments    on the wounds was<br>
twice   daily namely    morning and evening.   Acrilin is   a  commercially<br><br>
available ointment of GSK Agrivet, India comprising gamma benzene hexachloride, proflavin hemisulphate and cetrimide.<br>
It is quite evident from Tables 1 and 2 that the ointment of the invention showed improved wound healing properties as compared to neem oil and turpentine oil alone and that the wound healing properties of the ointment of the invention were comparable to those of the commercially available ointment Acrilin. The ointment of the invention is easy and convenient to apply on wounds. It is economical because neem oil and turpentine oil and the other ingredients are cheap and easily available. The ointment of the invention is also safe and without side effects as the ingredients are without side effects. Besides being in the form of ointment, the medicament of the invention also may be in the form of a cream. The process of preparing the ointment or cream of the invention is simple, easy and convenient to carry out.<br><br>
