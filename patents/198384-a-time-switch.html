				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a time switch which can be used in a washing machine, an electric fan, a microwave oven with a thawing device, and the like and, in particular, to a time switch suitable for use in a washing machine.<br>
Conventionally, as one of time switches, there is known a timer for a washing machine. Referring to the structure of this timer, between a power source and a load  there are interposed a time-limit-operation switch which continues to turn on during a set time and, if the set time passes, turns off, and a cycle-operation switch which repeats on and off operations alternately at a given cycle, while the time-limit-operation switch and cycle-operation switch are arranged in such a manner that they are connected in series to each other; and, the load is driven intermittently at a given cycle through the operations of the time-limit-operation switch and cycle-operation switch.<br>
As a timer for washing machine of this type, there is known a time switch which is disclosed in Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication Hei. 3-163720. The disclosed time switch is driven by a spring and, in this time switch, if the operation time thereof reaches a given time before the end of a set time, then intermittent<br><br>
on and off times can be switched automatically over to each other. In the time switch of this type, for example, when creating a time limit chart for washing clothes after soaking the clothes in water in a washing machine, that is, when setting a reversing operation interval and a no-reversing operation state, a main switch is turned on and off by a stable drive source such as a motor or the like. This is because, if a time switch of a spring type is used and the main switch is turned on and off by a cam provided in the drive shaft portion of the time switch for the spring, then a large amount of torque is lost, and, if the torque is increased using the spring or the like in order to make up for the torque loss, then there arises a problem relating to the strength of gears used, the efficiency of the operation of the time switch.<br>
By the way, in the time switch of a spring type disclosed in the above-cited Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication Hei. 3-163720, a second main switch is turned on and off by a cam follower which can be operated integrally with a cam used to operate two cycle-operation switches, while one of the cycle-operation switches can be switched over to a non-operation state by a cam follower which can be operated by a given cam disposed in the drive shaft portion of the time switch for the spring.<br>
However, the technology disclosed in Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication Hei. 3-163720 is a technology to switch the on and off cycles over to each other at a given time before the end of the set time, but is not be able to change the timing chart to<br><br>
a great, extent. Also, in the above-disclosed technology, to change the on and off cycles, there is additionally provided a second main switch mechanism, so that the timer is comparatively complicated in structure.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE TNVEMTTnH<br>
In view of the above, it is an object of the invention to provide a time switch which is capable of changing a time limit chart easily without making its switch mechanism complicated.<br>
In attaining the above object, according to the invention, there is provided a time switch which comprises: a first rotary shaft to be rotationally driven by a drive source; a first cam member so mounted as to rotatable together with the first rotary shaft; a main switch serving as a first switch to be driven by the cam surface of the first cam member in such a manner that it can be operated on and off only once during one rotational operation of the first cam member; a second cam member to be rotationally driven by the drive source such that it can be rotated at a higher speed than the first cam member; a second switch which can be driven by the cam surface of the second cam member in such a manner that it can be operated on and off, and which is to be connected in series to the main switch; a third cam member so mounted as to be rotatable together with said first rotary shaft; and, connecting means to be driven by the cam surface of the third cam member, while the connecting means is capable of swinging reciprocatingly when the<br><br>
main switch is on and transmitting its swing motion to the second switch, characterized in that a state in which the operation of the second switch to be executed in accordance with the cam surface of the second cam member is prevented by the cam surface of the third cam member through the connecting means and a state in which such second switch operation is not prevented by the cam surface of the third cam member are set in such a manner that the respective states can occur at least once.<br>
Also, according to the invention, the second switch can be operated on and off by a second cam follower which can be driven by the cam surface of the second cam member, while the connecting means can be arranged in such a manner that it is capable of preventing the second cam follower from being driven by the cam surface of the second cam member.<br>
Further, according to the invention, the third cam member is to be mounted on the first rotary shaft and includes low-step and high-step portions with which the connecting means can be contacted, and the operation of the second switch to be driven by the cam surface of the second cam member can be prevented by the high-step portion of the third cam member during the on operation of the main switch. And, the low-step and high-step portions to be formed in the third cam member are respectively formed in two or more in the operation area of the main switch.<br>
Still further, according to the invention, the drive source consists of a spring, the first rotary shaft consists of a drive<br><br>
shaft to be driven by the spring, the main switch consists of a time limit switch to be turned off just as the rotation of the drive shaft is caused to stop, the second cam member consists of a cam to which the rotation of the drive shaft can be transmitted with the speed thereof increased, and the second switch consists of a cycle-operation switch which is capable of repeating its on/off operation two or more times while the main switch is on.<br>
Yet further, according to the invention, the main switch may consist of a switch which is capable of controlling a washing time, while the second switch may consist of a reversing switch capable of reversing the rotation of a pulsator for use in washing.<br>
In other words, the time switch according to the invention comprises the main switch serving as a first switch which can be operated on and off by the first cam member rotatable together with the first rotary shaft that rotates at a low speed, the second switch which can be operated on and off by the second cam member which rotates faster than the first cam member, and the third cam member which can be rotated together with the first rotary shaft. And, due to provision of the connecting means which can be driven by the third cam member and is capable of preventing or permitting the second cam member cam surface following operation of the second switch, not only lost torque can be minimized but also the whole of the time limit chart can be changed easily. And, in the present invention, it is only necessary to add the connecting means to the conventional reversing timer, so that the structure of the present<br><br>
time switch is not complicated in changing the time limit chart. By the way, when a spring is used as a drive source, lost torque can be minimized to thereby eliminate the need to increase the torque using the spring. This does not raise any problem relating to the strength of gears used but makes it possible to execute the operation of the time switch smoothly,<br>

DRTflTLED   DKSCRIPTION   OF   THE   PRKFFIRWED   RMROnTMKMT.q<br>
How, description will be given below of an embodiment of a time switch according to the invention with reference to Figs. 1 to 18. For reference, a time switch illustrated in the present embodiment is a time switch of a spring type for use in a washing machine, which is so called a reversing timer.<br>
A time switch 1 according to the present embodiment comprises two machine frames 10 and 11 which are formed of resin and cooperate together in forming the box body of the time switch 1. In the machine frame 11, there is formed a housing 110 for storing therein a spring 20 serving as a drive source. In one side edge portion of the machine frame 10, there is formed a waterproof wall 103 and, there are disposed terminals for external connection, apart from the waterproof wall 103.<br>
In the machine frame 10 , there is formed a pipe shaft portion 101, and a main shaft 15 formed of metal and serving as a first<br><br>
rotary shaft is loosely fitted into the pipe shaft portion 101 in such a manner that the main shaft 15 can be rotated. A knob for time setting (not shown) is to be mounted on the lower end portion of the main shaft 15 that projects out from the machine frame 10.<br>
A main gear 16 formed of resin is fitted with the upper end portion of the main shaft 15 in such a manner that it can be rotated relatively with respect to the main shaft 15, while a friction plate 162 formed of metal is fitted with the portion of the main shaft 15 that is located just below the main gear 16 fitting portion. The friction plate 162 is disposed in such a manner that one surface thereof is in contact with the step portion of the main shaft 15, whereas the other surface is in pressure contact with the main gear 16 (see Fig. 3), As shown in Fig. 5, there is formed an engaging recessed portion 160 in the main gear 16, whereas there is provided an engaging projection 163 in the friction plate 162.<br>
In the engaging recessed portion 160, there is formed a projecting portion (an uncut portion) which projects from the wall surface of the engaging recessed portion 160 toward the center thereof in such a manner as to be able to block the rotation locus of the engaging projection 163; and, if the present projecting portion is engaged with the engaging projection 163, then the main gear 16 and friction plate 162 can be rotated together in an integral manner.<br>
The main gear 16 includes a hook portion 161 for securing the starting end portion of the spring 2 0 and, as in the usual way.<br><br>
with the starting end portion of the spring 20 secured to the hook portion 161, the spring 20 is wound into the housing 110.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 3, on the side of the main shaft<br>
15 and between the two machine frames 10 and 12, there is disposed a shaft 13 made of metal in such a manner that it extends parallel to the main shaft 15. The shaft 13 supports a large-diameter gear 23 formed of resin in a rotatable manner, while the boss portion of the large-diameter gear 23 supports a small-diameter gear 22 formed of resin in a rotatable manner. The small-diameter gear 22 is in meshing engagement with the main gear 16 . The large-diameter gear 23, as shown in Fig. 6, includes a plurality of ratchets 230.<br>
And, in the small-diameter gear 22, there is provided an elastic arm 220 which is made of resin and formed integrally with the small-diameter gear 22 and, on the leading end portion of the elastic arm 220, there is provided a ratchet pawl, while the ratchet pawl is engaged with the ratchets 230 of the large-diameter gear 23.<br>
The ratchets 230 and elastic arm 220 are structured such that, when rotating the main shaft 15 in the time set direction, they do not transmit the rotational force of the small-diameter gear 22 to the large-diameter gear 22 but, when rotating the main shaft 15 in the opposite direction due to the energizing force of the spring 20, they transmit the rotational force of the small-diameter gear 22 to the large-diameter gear 22: that is, the ratchets 230 and elastic arm 220 cooperate together in forming a so called one-way clutch 21.<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 3, on the side of the shaft 13, there is interposed another metal shaft 14 between the two machine frames 10 and 11 in such a manner that the metal shaft 14 is arranged in parallel to the shaft 13. On this shaft 14, there is rotatably supported a gear 24 which is formed of resin and includes a small-diameter gear portion 241 and a large-diameter gear portion 242 which are molded integrally with the gear 24. The large-diameter gear 23 is in meshing engagement with the small-diameter gear portion 241 of the gear 24. The large-diameter gear portion 242 of the gear 24 is in meshing engagement with a small-diameter portion 251 included in a gear 25 which is formed of metal and is rotatably supported on the shaft 13 downwardly of the large-diameter gear 23. The gear 25 is structured such that the small-diameter gear portion 251 and large-diameter gear portion 252 are both molded integrally with the gear 25.<br>
On the two machine frames 10 and 11, there are supported two shafts 65 and 67 which are respectively formed of metal and extend in parallel to the shaft 13 (see Figs. 4 and 6). On the shaft 65, there is rotatably supported an escapement wheel 26 which is formed of resin and includes a small-diameter gear portion 261 and a ratchet shaft portion 262 larger in diameter than the small-diameter gear portion 261 and composed of a plurality of pawl arm portions, while the small-diameter gear portion 261 and ratchet 3haft portion 2 62 are both molded integrally with the escapement tfheel 26. The small-diameter gear portion 261 of the escapement<br><br>
wheel 26 is in meshing engagement with the large-diameter gear portion 252 of the gear 25. The rotational force of the main shaft 16 is transmitted through a train of over-drive gears 22 - 23 -241 - 242 - 251 - 252 - 261 to the escapement wheel 26 to thereby rotate the escapement wheel 26 at a high speed.<br>
The ratchet shaft portion 262 of the escapement wheel 26 is in meshing engagement with an anchor 272 of a pendulum 27 which is rotatably supported on the shaft 67 and includes a pendulum plate 270 formed integrally therewith. The pendulum 27 can be swung reciprocatingly as the escapement wheel 2 6 is rotated in one direction, thereby being able to control the rotational speeds of the above-mentioned over-drive gear train and main shaft 15 to their respective given speeds. The gear 24, escapement wheel 26 and pendulum cooperate together in forming a clock mechanism 28.<br>
Here, description will be given below of the operation of the above-mentioned mechanism portion.<br>
That is, if the main shaft 15 is rotated in the time set direction, then the engaging projection 163 of the friction plate 162 is engaged with the projecting portion of the engaging recessed portion 160 of the main gear 16 and the main gear 16 is thereby rotated integrally with the main shaft 15, so that the spring 20 is wound and energy is thereby stored in the spring 20. In this case, in the one-way clutch mechanism 21, the ratchet pawl on the leading end portion of the elastic arm 220 is caused to slide on the ratchets 23 0 of the large-diameter gear 23, so that no rotational<br><br>
force is transmitted to the clock mechanism 28. By the way, if the main shaft 15 is returned by hand in the opposite direction to the time set direction, then the friction plate 162 and main gear 16 are caused to slip with respect to each other, so that the main gear 16 is not rotated but only the main shaft 15 can be returned. If energy is stored in the spring 20 and the rotation of the main shaft 15 in the time set direction is removed in the above-mentioned manner, then the main gear 16 is driven or rotated gradually in the opposite direction to the time set direction due to the energy stored in the spring 20, and the rotational force of the main gear 16 is transmitted to the main shaft 15, so that the main shaft 15 can be driven or rotated. In this rotation, the ratchet pawl of the one-way clutch 21 is secured to one of the ratchets 230, thereby allowing the small-diameter gear 22 and large-diameter gear 23 to rotate together in an integral manner.<br>
And, the rotational force of the main shaft 15 is transmitted to the time mechanism 28, so that the rotation of the spring 20 in the opposite direction to the time set direction, that is, the rotation of the spring 2 0 in the rewinding direction can be adjusted to a given speed. A friction clutch, which is composed of the main gear 61 and friction plate 162, transmits the rotational force in both directions with the rotational force of the spring 2 0 caused by the rewinding of the spring 20 as the limit thereof; that is, the friction clutch does not transmit a rotational force which is larger than the limit of the rotational force of the spring 20 caused<br><br>
^y the rewinding of the spring 20.<br>
As shown in Fig5. 5 and 6, a buzzer cam 17, which is formed of resin, is fitted with and fixed to the main shaft 15 and a main cam 18 serving as a first cam member, which is also formed of resin and is disposed downwardly of the buzzer cam 17, is rotatably fitted with the main shaft 15. Also, upwardly of the buzzer cam 17, there is disposed a connecting means cam 19 formed of resin and serving as a third cam member, which can be rotated slightly with respect to the buzzer cam 17 in the peripheral direction thereof and also can be rotated together with the main shaft 15.<br>
The buzzer cam 17, main cam 18 and connecting means cam 19 are superimposed on top of one another with the axis of the main shaft 15 as their common rotation center. In particular, the buzzer cam 17 includes a cam surface which is composed of a high-step portion 172 occupying the greater part of the outer periphery of the buzzer cam 17 and a low-step portion 173 formed in part of the outer periphery thereof; and, the buzzer cam 17, as shown in Fig. 8, further includes a fitting circumferential portion 171, which projects on the upper surface side thereof and with the outer periphery of which the connecting means cam 19 can be fitted, and two projecting portions 175 and 176 which project in the axial direction of the buzzer cam 17 respectively on the lower and upper surface sides thereof.<br>
Similarly, the main cam 18 includes a cam surface which is composed of a high-step portion 182 occupyinq the qreater part<br><br>
of the outer periphery thereof and a low-step portion 183 formed in part of the outer periphery thereof; and, it further includes a center hole 180 so formed as to extend along the outer periphery of the pipe shaft portion 101 of the machine frame 10, and an engaging recessed portion 181 formed by cutting out part of the center hole 180.<br>
The connecting means cam 19 is a cam with which connecting means 121 to be discussed later can be contacted. And, the connecting means cam 19 includes a low-step portion 191 occupying about two thirds of the outer periphery of the cam 19* three high-step portions 192, two low-step portions 193 respectively interposed between the three high-step portions 192, an engaging recessed portion 194 which can be engaged with the projecting portion 176 projecting on the upper side of the buzzer cam 17, and an extension portion 195 which extends up to the neighborhood of the friction plate 162.<br>
When the buzzer cam 17 and main cam 18 are superimposed on top of each other, the projecting portion 175 of the buzzer 17 is engaged or fitted into the engaging recessed portion 181 of the main cam 18, so that the two cams 17 and 18 hold each other- And, in this mutually holding state, in order that the two cams 17 and 18 can be rotated with respect to each other within a given range, there is provided room or play between the projecting portion 175 of the buzzer cam 17 and the engaging recessed portion 181 of the main cam 18. Therefore, when the main shaft 15 is rotated, until<br><br>
the projecting portion 175 is pressed against the end portion of the engaging recessed portion 181, the buzzer cam 17 is rotated ahead of the main cam 18 but the main cam 18 is not rotated. After the projecting portion 175 is engaged with the end portion of the engaging recessed portion 181, the two cams 17 and 18 are allowed to rotate together in an integral manner. Also, in a state where the two cams 17 and 18 are superimposed on top of each other in the above-mentioned manner, the low-step portions 173 and 183 of the two cams 17 and 18 are substantially superimposed on each other. By the way, the low-step portion 173 is formed slightly wider in range than the low-step portion 183 of the main cam 18.<br>
Also, the low-step portion 183 of the main cam 18 is disposed in such a manner that it can be overlapped only in part on the high-step portion 192 of the connecting means cam 19 in the axial direction. However, if the positions of the cam followers to be operated by the two cams 18 and 19 are adjusted properly, then the high-step portion 182 is able to move connecting means 121 {which will be discussed later) in a reciprocating manner while the present time switch 1 is operated by the high-step portion 182 of the main cam 18.<br>
There is disposed a switch composed of a plurality of contact plates 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35 in such a manner that it is opposed to the buzzer cam 17 and main cam 18. The respective one-side end portions of the contact plates 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35 are fixed by molding to an insulating base 69, while the insulating<br><br>
base 69 is fixed to the machine frame 10.<br>
In particular, the contact plate 31 can be driven by the main cam 18 through a driven member 41 which is molded integrally with the contact plate 31, whereby the contact plate 31 forms a first switch 90 which can be contacted with and removed from the contact plate 32. The first switch 90 is structured such that it turns on when a driven portion formed in the leading end portion of the driven member 41 faces the high-step portion 182 of the main cam 18, whereas it turns off when the driven portion of the main cam 18 drops down into the low-step portion 183 of the main cam 18.<br>
The contact plate 33 can be driven by the buzzer cam 17 through a driven lever 42, whereby the contact plate 33 forms a buzzer switch 91 which can be contacted with and removed from the contact plate 32. The driven lever 42 can be rotated about a shaft provided in the insulating base 69 and includes, on the two sides of the leading end portion thereof, a driven portion to be contacted with the buzzer cam 17 and a contact portion to be contacted with the contact plate 32. The buzzer switch 91 is structured such that it turns off when the driven portion of the driven lever 42 faces the high-step portion 172 of the buzzer cam 17, whereas it turns on when the driven portion of the driven lever 42 drops into the low-step portion 171 of the buzzer cam 17.<br>
The contact plate 34 can be driven by the main cam 18 through a slide lever 43 which can be driven in accordance with the operation<br><br>
of the driven member 41, whereby the contact plate 34 forms a switch 92 which can be contacted with and removed from the contact plate 35. The slide lever 43 is structured such that it can be slided along a guide groove 105 formed in the machine frame 10, and a projecting portion 431 formed in the slide lever 43 can be pressed against the contact plate 34 to thereby move the same toward the contact plate 35. If the downwardly projecting pin portion of the driven member 41 is loosely fitted into a hole 432 formed in the slide lever 43, then the slide lever 43 can be driven in accordance with the operation of the driven member 41.<br>
The first switch 90 forms a main switch 90 and, as shown in Fig. 15, it is connected in series between a power source 77 and a washing motor 78 which serves as a load. The buzzer switch 91 is connected in series between the power source 77 and a buzzer (not shown). Referring to the operation of the main switch 90 and buzzer switch 91, as shown in Fig. 6, since, when the main shaft 15 is rotated in the time set direction, the buzzer cam 17 is allowed to operate ahead of the main cam 18 due to the play between the projecting portion 175 of the buzzer cam 17 and the engaging recessed portion 181 of the main cam 18, the contact plate 33 is removed ahead from the contact plate 32, so that the buzzer does not sound. On the other hand, if the main shaft 15 is returned due to the stored energy of the spring 20, then the buzzer cam 17 is returned ahead in the above-mentioned play range, so that the contact plate 33 is contacted with the contact plate 32 for a given time before<br><br>
the main switch 90 is turned off to sound the buzzer for a short time, thereby notifying of the end of the set time. The respective one-end portions of the setting or contact plates 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35 are projected externally from the insulating base 69 to thereby provide terminals for external connection.<br>
The base end portion of the contact plate 31 is connected to a switch element (which will be discussed later). On the main cam 18 side of the contact plate 31, there is disposed the pin 2 73 of the pendulum 27 and, while the driven member 41 of the contact plate 31 is situated on the high-step portion 182 of the main cam 18, the pin 273 is separated from the contact plate 31, so that the pendulum 27 can be swung. If the driven member 41 drops down into the low-step portion 183, then the contact plate 31 approaches the pin 273 to restrict the swinging motion of the pendulum 27, thereby stopping the drive system of the time switch 1. By the way, the leading end of the contact plate 32 can be contacted with the contact portion 101 which is formed in the machine frame 10.<br>
Also, when the driven portion of the driven lever 41 faces the high-step portion of the main cam 18, the contact plate 31 is flexed outwardly in the diameter direction of the main cam 18 and is thereby contacted with the contact plate 3 2, so that the contact plate 32 is flexed in the same direction and is thereby separated from the contact portion 101 of the machine frame 10. On the other hand, if the driven lever 41 drops down into the low-step portion 182 of the main cam 18 and the contact plate 31 is thereby separated<br><br>
from the contact plate 32, then the contact plate 32 returns to its original position due to its own elasticity, is butted against the contact portion 101, and is held at the butting position.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, downwardly of the gear 24, there is supported on the shaft 14 a reversing cam 50 serving as a second cam member, which can be rotated integrally with the gear 24 when the boss portion thereof is engaged with the boss portion of the gear 24. The reversing cam 50 is a multi-layer cam including on the outer periphery thereof unevenly-shaped four layer cam surfaces 51, 52, 53 and 54 which are different in shape from one another, while the four cam surfaces 51, 52, 53 and 54 are molded of resin as a united body. The cam surfaces 51 and 53 are paired together to thereby provide a first cam surface, whereas the cam surfaces 52 and 54 are paired together to thereby provide a second cam surface.<br>
The cam surface 51, which is one of the first cam surface, as shown in Fig. 12, is composed of three high-step portions 511 occupying the greater part of the cam surface 51, and three low-step portions 512 which occupy the remaining portion of the cam surface 51. On the other hand, the cam surface 52, which is one of the second cam surface, is composed of three high-step portions 521 each formed in the range of about one sixth of the cam surface 52, and three low-step portions 522 each formed in the remaining range thereof, that is, in the range of about one sixth thereof. In the respective cam surfaces 51 and 52, at the same positions thereof, there are<br><br>
formed three drop-in portions 501 which respectively extend from the high-step portions to the low-step portions. The cam surface 53, which is the other of the first cam surface, similarly to the cam surface 51, includes three high-step portions 531 occupying the greater part of the cam surface 53 and the remaining three low-step portions 532, while the cam surface 53 is arranged in such a manner that it is shifted by an angle of 60° with respect to the cam surface 51. The cam surface 54, which is the other of the second cam surface, similarly to the cam surface 52, includes three high-step portions 541 and three low-step portions 542 each of which occupies about one sixth of the cam surface 54, while the cam surface 54 is arranged in such a manner that it is shifted by an angle of 60° with respect to the cam surface 52. In the respective cam surfaces 53 and 54, at the same positions, there are formed three drop-in portions 503 which respectively extend from the high-step portions to the low-step portions.<br>
As shown in Figs. 9 and 11, a plurality of elastic contact plates 36, 37, 38, in more particular, the base portions thereof are respectively fixed to the machine frame 10 through an insulating base 550. The contact plate 38 provides a fixed contact plate in which two contacts 39 are fixedly secured to the portions of the contact plate 38 that are respectively opposed to the contact plates 36 and 37. On the other hand, the two contact plates 36 and 37 respectively provide movable contact plates in which contacts 361 and 371 contactable with the fixed contacts 39 are fixed to the<br><br>
respective leading end portions of the contact plates 36 and 37.<br>
The driven portion 611 of the leading end portion of a driven lever 61 forming one of the second cam followers can be slidingly contacted with the cam surfaces 51 and 52 of the reversing cam 50. Also, the driven portion 621 of the leading end portion of a driven lever 62 forming the other of the second cam followers can be slidingly contacted with the cam surfaces 53 and 54 of the reversing cam 50. The cam surfaces of the reversing cam 50, with which the driven portions 611 and 612 of the driven levers 61 and 62 can be slidingly contacted, can be selected by cam surface switching means (which will be discussed later) in such a manner that, when the driven portion 611 faces the cam surface 51, the driven portion 621 faces the cam surface 53 and, when the driven portion 611 faces the cam surface 52, the driven portion 621 faces the cam surface 54.<br>
In the base portion 613 and 623 of the two driven levers 61 and 62, there are formed axial holes respectively and, if the axial holes are loosely fitted with the lever shaft 63, then the driven levers 61 and 62 can be respectively driven as the reversing cam 50 is rotated, so that they can be swung individually about the lever shaft 63. In the driven lever 61, in particular, on the opposite side thereof to the driven portion 611, there is projectingly formed a contact plate operation portion 612 and, in the driven lever 62 as well, similarly, there is projectingly formed a contact plate operation portion 622. When the driven levers 61<br><br>
and 62 are driven or swung in accordance with the rotation of the reversing cam 50, the contact plate operation portions 612 and 622 swing the movable contact plates 36 and 37 respectively.<br>
When the driven portion 611 of the driven lever 61 faces the low-step portion 512 or 522 of the reversing cam 50, the contacts 361 and 39 of the contact plates 36 and 38 are contacted with each other to thereby turn on a forward rotation switch 55, whereas, when the driven portion 611 of the driven lever 61 faces the high-step portion 511 or 512 of the reversing cam 50, the forward rotation switch 55 is turned off. Also, when the driven portion 622 of the driven lever 62 faces the low-step portion 532 or 542 of the reversing cam 50, a reversing switch 56 is turned on and, when the driven portion 622 of the driven lever 62 faces the high-step portion 531 or 541 of the reversing cam 50, the reversing switch 56 is turned off. in the two driven levers 61 and 62, there are formed curved portions 616 and 626 respectively and, inside the curved portions 616 and 626, that is, on the reversing cam 50 side thereof, there are projectingly formed engaging projection portions 613 and 624 respectively.<br>
The base portions of the driven levers 61 and 62 are rotatably supported within a hold cover 64 by a shaft 63 which extends through the upper and lower end plates 641 and 642 of the hold cover 64. The outer peripheral surface of the hold cover 64 is cut away in part to thereby provide a lever window 645 and the base portions of the driven levers 61 and 62 are respectively<br><br>
inserted through the lever window 645 and are fitted with or mounted on the shaft 63. The lever window 645 is formed in a range which does not interfere with the swinging motion of the two driven levers 61 and 62.<br>
The shaft 63, on the lower side of the lower end plate 642 of the hold cover 64, extends through an arc-shaped elongated hole 75 of a cam 73 the plane shape of which is formed in a fan shape.<br>
The cam 73 includes, in the portion thereof which corresponds to the rivet or pivot of the fan, a cylindrical-shaped shaft portion 71 formed integrally therewith; and, the lower end portion of the shaft portion 71 is loosely fitted with the journal portion 105 projectingly provided on the machine frame 10 formed integrally therewith, and the upper end portion of the shaft portion 71 is inserted through the hole formed in the machine frame 11, so that the cam 73 can be rotated about the journal portion 105,<br>
The base portion of a hand-operated external operation lever 74 is fitted with and fixed to the upper end portion of the shaft portion 71 which projects out from the machine frame li. The shaft portion 71 is situated inwardly of the curved portions 616 and 62 6 of the driven levers 61 and 62. On the outer periphery of the shaft portion 71, there is provided an engaging projection 712 in such a manner that it extend along the axial direction of the shaft portion 71 and projects in the radial direction thereof. If the shaft portion 71 is rotated through the operation of the operation lever 74, then the engaging projection 712 is butted<br><br>
against the engaging projecting portions 614 and 624 of the driven levers 61 and 62, and the engaging projection 712 is further pressed against the engaging projecting portions 614 and 624 to thereby rotate the driven levers 61 and 62, with the result that the driven levers 61 and 62 can be respectively separated from the cam surfaces of the cam 50.<br>
in the above operation, the driven levers 61 and 62 are respectively moved outwardly of or to the same lever positions where the driven portions 611 and 621 of the driven levers 61 and 62 respectively face the high-step portions 511, 521, 531, 541 of the reversing cam 50. Further, if the shaft portion 71 is rotated, then the engaging projecting portions 614 and 624 of the driven levers 61 and 62 are separated from the engaging projection 712 of the shaft portion 71 and they are now free from mutual interference, and thus the driven levers 61 and 62 are rotated and returned due to the elastic forces of the contact plates 36 and 37, so that the driven portions 611 and 621 of the driven levers 61 and 62 can be respectively contacted with the cam surfaces of the reversing cam 50.<br>
In the edge portion of the leading end of the cam 73, there is formed an elongated hole 75 which extend along an arc having the journal portion 105 as a center thereof, and the shaft 63 can be inserted through the elongated hole 75: that is, the rotational range of the cam 7 3 can he restricted by the insertion of the shaft 63 through the elongated hole 75. By the way, on the machine frame<br><br>
10 side as well, there is formed a projecting portion which is used to restrict the rotational range of the cam 73 . Along the periphery of the elongated hole 75, there is formed a cam surface 72 which has a height in the axial direction. The cam surface 72 includes a high-step portion 721 and a low-step portion 722 respectively in the two ends thereof, and further, in the intermediate portion thereof, an inclined surface 723 which connects the high- and low-step portions 721 and 722 to each other.<br>
The lower end plate 642 of the hold cover 64 can be slidingly contacted with the cam surface 72. Between the upper end plate 641 of the hold cover 64 and machine frame 11, there is interposed a coiled spring 65 and thus the lower end plate 642 of the hold cover 64 is pressed against the cam surface 72 due to the elastic force of the spring 65. If the external operation lever 74 is operated or rotated, then the cam 73 is rotated integrally with the operation lever 74, and the cam surface 72, with which the lower end plate 642 of the hold cover 64 can be slidingly contacted, is switched through the inclined surface 723 over to the high-step portion 721 or low-step portion 722. As a result, in cooperation with the coiled spring 65, the hold cover 64 and the driven levers 61, 62 held within the hold cover 64 are moved up and down along the shaft 63.<br>
In this manner, when the lower end plate 642 of the hold cover 64 is in contact with the high-step portion 721 of the cam 73, the driven levers 61 and 62 are situated in their respective<br><br>
upper positions against the elastic force of the coiled spring 65, and the driven portions 611 and 621 of the driven levers 61 and 62 respectively face the first cam surfaces 51 and 53 of the reversing cam 50. On the other hand, when the lower end plate 642 of the hold cover 64 is in contact with the low-step portion 722 of the cam 73, the driven levers 61 and 62 are situated in their respective lower positions due to the elastic force of the coiled spring 65, and the driven portions 611 and 621 of the driven levers 61 and 62 respectively face the second cam surfaces 52 and 54 of the reversing cam 50.<br>
Also, halfway during the rotational operation of the external operation lever 74, as described above, the driven levers 61 and 62 are rotated due to the mutual contact between the engaging projection 712 of the shaft portion 71 and the engaging projecting portions 614, 624 of the driven levers 61, 62, so that the driven portions 611 and 621 of the driven levers 61 and 62 are caused to escape outwardly in the radial direction of the reversing cam 50. This eliminates the possibility that, when the reversing cam 50 is moved in the axial direction thereof, the driven portions 611 and 621 of the driven levers 61 and 62 can be caught by the stepped portions of the respective cam surfaces 51, 52, 53 and 54.<br>
On the outer periphery of the hold cover 64, there is provided an engaging projection 64 6 which extends in the axial direction of the hold cover 64. The engaging projection 64 6 can be fitted into a guide groove 108 formed in the machine frame 10.<br><br>
Therefore, the hold cover 64 is supported in such a manner that it can be moved along the guide groove 108 but cannot be rotated around the shaft 63.<br>
The structure portion of the time switch 1, which includes the external operation lever 74, cam 73, hold cover 64 and the like, forms cam surface switching means 70 which is capable of moving the reversing cam 50 with respect to the reversing switches 55 and 56 serving as the cycle-operation switches or with respect to the driven levers 61 and 62, and vice versa, to thereby switch the reversing switches 55 and 56 between a first state in which the on/off operation of the reversing switches 55 and 56 is controlled by the first cam surfaces 51 and 53 and a second state in which the on/off operation of the reversing switches 55 and 56 is controlled by the second cam surfaces 52 and 54 . However, to switch the cam surfaces of the reversing cam 50 with which the reversing switches 55 and 56 or driven levers 61 and 62 can be slidingly contacted, the cam 73 may not be used but the reversing switches 55 and 56 or driven levers 61 and 62 may be moved directly, or the reversing cam 50 may be moved. And, the hold cover may also be omitted.<br>
There is disposed connecting means 121 in such a manner that it can be slidingly contacted with the outer peripheral surface of the connecting means cam 19. The connecting means 121 is rotatably supported on a shaft 122 which is disposed in the machine frame  10.    And,  the  connecting  means  121  comprises  a<br><br>
triangular-shaped driven portion 123 which can be contacted with the connecting means cam 19, an operation portion 124 which can be contacted with the two driven levers 61 and 62 at the same time to thereby disable them, and a rotation center hole 125 through which the shaft 122 is allowed to extend.<br>
Referring to the operation of the connecting means 121, if the driven portion 123 thereof is moved up onto the high-step portion 192 of the connecting means cam 19, then the operation portion 124 thereof separates the two driven levers 61 and 62 from the reversing cam 50. As a result of this, the power supply to the washing motor 78 is cut off, thereby causing the washing motor 78 to stop. On the other hand, if the driven portion 123 drops down into the low-step portion 193 of the connecting means cam 19, then the two driven levers 61 and 62 can be driven in accordance with the operations of the cam surfaces 51, 52, 53 and 54 of the reversing cam 50, thereby causing the washing motor 78 to rotate in the forward direction or reversing direction.<br>
Now, rig. 15 shows an embodiment of connection of the above-mentioned respective switches. The timing operation switch 90 {main switch 90), which is composed of the contact plates 31 and 32, is connected in series between the power source 77 and washing motor 78 serving as the load through a fuse 130 and, at the same time, two switches 55 and 56, which are connected in parallel to each other and can be operated by the external operation lever 74, are both connected in series to the main switch 90. Also,<br><br>
when safety is taken into consideration, that is, when so called two-way power cutoff iis necessary, between the washing motor 78 and power source 77, there is interposed a two-wire cut switch 131.<br>
By the way, in the present embodiment, a dehydrating circuit, which is composed of a cover switch 132, a dehydrating timer 133 and a dehydrating motor 134, is disposed in parallel to the time switch 1 and the washing circuit of the washing machine motor 78. Also, to the washing motor 78 and dehydrating motor 34, there are connected capacitors 135 and 136, respectively.<br>
Next, description will be given below of the operation of the time switch 1 when the time switch 1 is used for controlling of the washing motor 78. By the way, it is assumed here that the switch 55 is connected to the forward rotation circuit of the washing motor 78 and the switch 56 is connected to the reversing rotation circuit thereof.<br>
As has been described before, if the time limit is set by<br>
rotating the main shaft 15 by an angle of about 300° through the operation of the knob, then the over-drive gear train is driven or rotated due to the energizing force of the spring 20 and, owing to the operation of the clock mechanism 28, the main shaft 15 is driven or rotated at a given speed in the opposite direction to the rotational direction thereof when the time limit is set. Also, because of the rotation of the main shaft 15, the connecting means cam 19 is also rotated by an angle of 3 0° from a state shown in Fig. 10 in the direction of an arrow A shown in Fig. 10, and thus<br><br>
the driven portion 123 of the connecting means 121 is contacted with the low-step portion 191 of the connecting means cam 19, so that the driven gears 61 and 62 are enabled to execute their cam surface following operations. As the main shaft 15 is reversed, the connecting means cam 19 is reversely rotated toward its original position.<br>
The gear 24 of the over-drive gear train and reversing cam 50, in more particular, their respective boss portions are engaged with each other, and thus the reversing cam 50 can be driven or rotated integrally with the gear 24 at a relatively high speed.<br>
If the reversing cam 50 is rotated, then the surface of the reversing cam 50, which the driven portions 611 and 621 of the driven levers 61 and 62 face, is switched alternately between the high-step and low-step portions; in particular, when the driven portions 611 and 621 face the high-step portion, the switches 55 and 56 are turned off and, on the other hand, when the driven portions 611 and 621 face the low-step portion, the switches 55 and 56 are turned on. Here, it is assumed that a weak water flow is selected by the external operation lever 74 and thus the driven portions 611 and 621 of the driven levers 61 and 62 are caused to face the first cam surfaces 51 and 53 of the reversing cam 50. Since the first cam surfaces 51 and 53 of the reversing cam 50 are structured as described above, the switches 55 and 56 are alternately turned on and off with a phase difference of an angle of 60" between them.<br>
This alternate operation is shown in Fig. 16 (C), that is, a<br><br>
forwardly rotating operation and a reversely rotating operation each of a relatively short time of 4 seconds are executed alternately with a relatively long off time of 11,5 seconds. In this manner, because the operation time of the washing motor 78 within the set time is short and the stop time thereof is long, there can be obtained the weak water flow.<br>
Next, if the external operation lever 74 is rotated to thereby select a strong water flow, then the lower end plate 642 of the hold cover 64 is contacted with the low-step portion 722 of the cam 72 to thereby move the driven levers 61 and 62 downward. The driven levers 61 and 62 are thus caused to face the second cam surfaces 52 and 54 of the reversing cam 50 respectively, in this case as well, the switches 55 and 56 are turned on and off at a given cycle due to the rotation of the reversing cam 50. However, because the second cam surfaces 52 and 54, as described above, are respectively composed of the high-step portions 521, 541 each having an angle of about 70° and low-step portions 522, 542 each having an angle of about SO"" , the washing motor 78 is operated in such a manner that, as shown in Fig. 16 (B), a forwardly rotating operation and a reversely rotating operation each of a relatively long time of 13.5 sec. are executed alternately with a relatively short off time of 2 sec. In this manner, since the operation time of the washing motor 78 is long and the stop time thereof is short within the set time, there can be obtained the strong water flow.<br>
Here, for example, if the set time is assumed to be 35 min.,<br><br>
tfhen 2 minutes and 30 seconds have passed, that is, when the time reaches the position of 32 .5 minutes shown in Fig, 16 (A), the driven portion 123 of the connecting means 121 is moved up onto the first high-step portion 192 of the connecting means cam 19 (see Fig. 7). In response to this, the operation portion 124 of the connecting means 121 disables the driven levers 61 and 62. This causes both of the two switches 55 and 56 to turn off, which in turn causes the washing motor 78 to stop. If this stop state continues for 3 minutes and 30 seconds, then the driven portion 123 of the connecting means 121 drops down into the low-step portion 193 of the connecting means cam 19, so that the switches 55 and 56 are allowed to turn on and off again at a given cycle. This state corresponds to an area ranging from 29 minutes to 25.5 minutes shown in Fig. 16 (A).<br>
After then, between 25.5 minutes and 22 minutes shown in Fig. 16 (A), the driven portion 123 of the connecting means 121 is moved up onto the first high-step portion 192 of the connecting means cam 19, the two switches 55 and 56 are both turned off again, and the washing motor 78 is caused to stop. If the main shaft 15 is rotated, the connecting means cam 19 is rotated, so that a reversely rotating operation of 3 .5 minutes and a stop of 3 .5 minutes are executed by the next low-step portion 193 and next high-step portion 192 of the connecting means cam 19. After then, the driven portion 123 drops down into the low-step portion 191, so that the reversely rotating operation is continued for 15 minutes.<br><br>
If the set time has passed, then the main cam 18 returns back to its original position and the main switch 90 is thereby turned off, so that the power supply to the washing motor 78 is stopped completely to thereby end the operation of the washing motor 78. By the way, just before the main switch 90 is turned off, the buzzer is caused to sound by the buzzer cam 17.<br>
By the way, the above-mentioned embodiment is a preferred embodiment of the invention but the invention is not limited to this. That is, various changes and modifications are possible without departing from the scope of the subject matter of the invention. For example, referring to the on/off operation of the washing motor 78 to be executed by the reversing cam 50, the washing motor 7 8 may not be rotated alternately in the forward and reversing rotating directions, but, as shown in Fig. 17, the rotating operations of the washing motor 7 8 only in one direction may be repeated intermittently with a stop time between them. Such repeated intermittent rotating operations can be achieved, for example, by employing a structure in which the whole periphery of one of the cam surfaces 51 and 53 of the reversing cam 50 or one of the cam surfaces 52 and 54 thereof is composed of only the high-step portions. That is, in this manner, by changing the shape of the reversing cam 50 properly, there can be obtained various kinds of reversing operations.<br>
Further, the connecting means cam 19 may also be formed in such a shape as shown in Fig. 18: that is, the high-step portions<br><br>
192 of the connecting cam 19 may be so formed as to extend over a long distance, whereas the low-step portions 193 thereof may be so formed as to extend over a short distance, still further, the number of the high-step portions 192 may be three instead of two. By the way, by changing the size of the high-step portions 192 into various sizes, there can be obtained different time limit charts. In this manner/ by changing the shape of the connecting means cam 19, various kinds of time limit charts can be obtained easily.<br>
Also, the connecting means cam 19 may also include an engaging projecting portion which can be fitted with the engaging recessed portion formed in the main shaft 15. With use of this structure, when the engaging projecting portion of the connecting means cam 19 is fitted with the engaging recessed portion of the main shaft 15, the position of the connecting means cam 19 in the axial direction thereof can be restricted.<br>
In the above-mentioned embodiment, the main cam 18 for the main switch 90 is provided separately from the connecting means cam 19. However, the main cam 18 may be omitted and the complete stop of the time switch 1 and washing motor 78 may be carried out by the connecting means cam 19. Also, one of the two driven levers 61 and 62 may be omitted and the remaining driven lever may be formed integrally with the connecting means 121 as a united body; and, one end of such united body may be driven by the connecting means cam 19, and the other end may be driven by the reversing cam 50,<br><br>
so that the united body can be swung with the center thereof as a fulcrum thereof. Further, in the above-mentioned respective embodiments, when the reversing cam 50 is rotated once, the on/off operation of the washing motor 78 is carried out three times. However, the on/off operation of the washing motor 78 may also be carried out two times, or once, or four times during one rotation of the reversing cam 50.<br>
Also, in the above-mentioned embodiment, there are provided the driven levers 61 and 62 serving as the second cam followers which are used to operate the reversing switches 55 and 56 serving as the second switches. However, the driven levers 61 and 62 may be omitted and, instead, there may be provided a follower portion which is united together with the contact plates 3 6 and 37. In this case, the connecting means 121 can be contacted directly with the contact plates 36 and 37 to thereby disable them. Further, instead of the above-mentioned structure in which the two driven levers 61 and 62 are disabled at the same time by the connecting means 121, there may be provided two connecting means and thus the two driven levers 61 and 62 may be controlled individually by the two connecting means. In this manner, if one of the driven levers is always disabled, then the operation portion of the time limit chart can be set only for the forward rotation or reversing rotation.<br>
By the way, in the above-mentioned respective embodiments, since the whole of the time limit is not controlled on and off by<br><br>
the operation of the main switch 90, there can be provided room in tlie torque and, therefore, even when a timer of a spring type is used, the on/off operation of the time switch can be controlled to a sufficient degree. Also, because the main switch 90 and reversing switches 55, 56 both have only to repeat their respective on/off operations to a necessary and lowest degree, the life of the time switch 1 can be extended. Further, when the present time switch 1 is used for a washing machine, only the time limit chart can be changed widely and easily, while employing the conventional wiring on the washing machine side as it is.<br>
Also, if the time switch 1 is used as a so called intermittent timer in an electric fan, then it is able to generate various kinds of wind conditions; that is, use of the time switch 1 in the electric fan can enhance the utility value of the electric fan. Also, if the time switch 1 is used as a thawing timer in a microwave oven, there can be obtained various thawing charts.<br>
As has been described heretofore, with use of a time switch according to the invention, there are provided a state in which the operation of a second switch to be executed in accordance with the cam surface of a second cam member is prevented by the cam surface of a third cam member through connecting means, and a state in which the above operation is not prevented, so that the whole of a time limit chart can be changed widely when compared with the conventional time switch.<br>
Also, according to the invention, if there is provided a<br><br>
second cam follower which is used to turn the second switch on and off, then the freedom of the contact position of the connecting means can be widened to thereby facilitate the design of the present time switch, when compared with the conventional time switch in which a contact plate forming a second switch itself is disabled. This can facilitate the assembly of the structure of the present time switch.<br>
Further, according to the invention, there can be provided a time switch of a spring type which is so called a reversing timer, that is, there can be provided a high-function time switch which can be manufactured at a low cost. Therefore, the present time switch can be used to control various equipment, such as a washing motor in a washing machine, a blade motor in an electric fan, a microwave oven, and the like. Still further, if the time switch according to the invention is applied for control of a washing motor used to drive a pulsator provided in a washing machine, then it can be operated as a so called reversing timer which can provide various washing methods easily.<br><br><br>
