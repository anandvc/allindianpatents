AN IMPROVED PROCESS FOR PREPARING HEALTHY<br>
DRINKING WATER<br>
MR. SONI VASANT BHAVANJI, INDIAN NATIONAL, RESIDING AT B-l, ANJALI, DR. S. RADHAKRISHNA ROAD, ANDHERI [EAST], MUMBAI 400 069, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA.<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PERTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE<br>
PERFORMED.     <br><br><br>
1<br><br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for making healthy drinking water. Particularly, it relates to a process for fortification of drinking water having low amounts of minerals or water obtained by desalination processes or distilled water so that the fortified drinking water obtained by adopting this invented process, will contain minerals at higher desired concentration and resultant water will be beneficial to human health. This process is flexible and it can also be also adopted to reduce calcium content of drinking water if it is present in excessively high amounts, if required. This process is also capable of simpler but effective method for separation of powdered activated carbon used for removal of harmful organic and pesticide chemicals. The process is also capable to fortify water with beneficial trace minerals like potassium, zinc, chromium, lithium, boron, selenium, fluoride, iodide or other minerals, if required.<br>
Background of this invention<br>
Cardiovascular disease is biggest killer of people around the world accounting for more than 16 million deaths annually. Numerous studies have shown that by use of drinking water rich in magnesium the mortality due to heart and stroke disease can be reduced. Naturally available drinking water contains bicarbonate ions in variable concentration. Bicarbonate ions in drinking water are known to have important beneficial health effects and hence are preferable anions to get additional benefits. A good drinking water should have minimum 75 mgs/liter of bicarbonate ions and higher values will be more beneficial. Chromium in trace quantities is known to improve glucose metabolism and thus beneficial to diabetic people. Studies have also shown that chromium also has beneficial effect on heart disease. Naturally available water has very low chromium content due to due to low solubility of chromium hydroxide ( ref. 4 ). Other minerals in trace quantities are essential for human body and some populations may be suffering from low intake of these minerals and resultant adverse effects.<br>
Most of the naturally available drinking water generally less then 10 milligrams per liter of magnesium as compared to minimum of 25 - 30 milligrams per liter or more needed to get cardio-protective effects. There is increasing reliance on desalination of sea water as a source of drinking water which contains negligible minerals. Hence there is a need to find a most appropriate method for fortification of soft water or desalinated water low in minerals with optimum amounts of magnesium, calcium and bicarbonate ions and other useful trace elements.<br>
Drinking water can be a good source to ensure intake of trace minerals in optimum quantity but no naturally available drinking water contains all the useful trace and macro minerals in desirable concentration. Thus process of this invention is an important step towards preventive health care and has a potential to prevent very large number of early deaths due to cardiovascular disease and may be diabetic mellitus.<br>
Method of this invention makes it possible to fortify such waters with desirable concentration of magnesium, bicarbonate and calcium ions, the last being less important. Other useful macro and trace elements like potassium, chromium, zinc, selenium, iodide,<br>
2<br><br>
fluorine, boron and lithium can also be incorporated in water, if required, by this method The method is also capable of simpler technique for separation of powdered activated carbon used to purify the water from pesticide and organic chemical contamination.. The most important aspect of this invented process is that it is possible to fortify water with all these trace minerals in desired concentration.<br>
Many scientific studies carried out in last five decades have shown that use of drinking water containing low concentration of minerals like calcium, magnesium and bicarbonate alkalinity can result into higher mortality and morbidity due to heart and stroke and it is advisable to fortifying the drinking water with these minerals. Detailed biological studies have shown that magnesium in drinking water is much more important to provide protective effect on heart and blood vessels and calcium has minor or negligible role to play. (ref. 1 to 35 )<br>
Bicarbonate content in drinking water also has many important health benefits for maintaining blood pH in narrow range of 7.3 to 7.4 which is very crucial requirement for survival of human body. Bicarbonate ions in blood act as a major buffer to maintain blood pH in above range. Ideal bicarbonate content of blood is 22-29 mEq/lt of blood (ref .39 ). Further it is also known that at lower blood pH there is marked reduction in oxygen carrying capacity of blood ( Bohr effect, ref 39) Lower oxygen supply to heart and brain can cause adverse health effects and in extreme case can cause death due to heart attack or stroke. Deficiency of bicarbonate in blood has been shown to cause faster blood coagulation (ref 38). Resultant blood clot formation can block blood supply to coronary arteries or to brain causing serious consequences for heart or brain and even cause death. Lower pH has been shown to increase urinary loss of valuable calcium, magnesium and potassium minerals from body (ref. 41 ). Resultant Calcium depletion can lead to osteoporosis and magnesium or potassium depletion can increase risk of CVD. Regular use of drinking water containing higher amounts of bicarbonate alkali can be helpful for maintaining higher urine pH and thereby preventing excess urinary loss of calcium and magnesium. US patent no 6048553 describes beneficial effects of magnesium bicarbonate for treating viral, inflammatory and degenerative disease and for higher life expectancy. Water with negligible or low bicarbonate alkalinity has been reported to cause alarmingly high death rates, 300 to 800 percent higher than world average, due to stroke in Japan (ref. 16 ). Bureau of Indian Standards recommends that mineral water should have minimum 75 milligrams per liter of bicarbonate ions (ref. 40) Many soft waters are likely to be deficient in this important constituent.. Thus it will be beneficial to use drinking water containing 75 milligrams per liter or more of bicarbonate..<br>
Chromium nutrition is of special importance as it has a role in glucose metabolism and hence beneficial for diabetic people. Few studies also suggest a role of chromium for lipid metabolism and hence beneficial in heart disease. (ref. 4, 8,44 ,45 ). Healthy adult human body contains about 6 milligrams of chromium and daily intake of 50 -200 micrograms of this mineral is required for good health. However majority of people fall short of required intake. It may take 10-40 years before consequences of deficiency of<br>
3<br><br>
chromium in body shows up as poor glucose metabolisam and ultimately fully blown up diabetic condition. It takes much shorter time to reverse this condition with adequate chromium supplementation in diet. It may be noted that there are 40 million and 16 million diabetic people in India and US alone. In view of the aforesaid, it will be a good option to fortify drinking water with chromium. The invented process as described can not only give chromium content similar to the best possible natural water but also much higher concentration.<br>
In last few decades there is increasing concern about pesticide and organic contamination of drinking water and it's harmful effects on human body. More than 50 such harmful chemicals have already been found by various scientific studies and a need to minimize the same in drinking water is recommended ( ref. 43, 4 ). Activated carbon treatment is useful technique for purifying water from these contaminants. However separation of powdered activated carbon requires special filtration equipment which impedes it's widespread use. A simpler method to separate powdered activated carbon from drinking water after it's use is desirable and will be helpful in adopting this technique.<br>
Adding required quantities of water soluble calcium and magnesium salts to water is simple. But major drawback of such an approach is that it can not increase bicarbonate content of water. Naturally available soft waters and desalinated water will also become more beneficial if bicarbonate is increased along with fortification for magnesium. Mineral fortified water containing bicarbonate ions along with higher magnesium and calcium will be more similar to naturally available mineral water. The desalinated water contains negligible bicarbonate and use of such water without fortification with bicarbonate can pose unacceptable health risk of alarming high death rates due to stroke judging from Japanese and Italian experience ( ref. 16)<br>
Hence any method which can achieve all the objectives outlined above will be preferable. Process of this invention can meet several objectives viz. to fortify drinking water with beneficial minerals like Mg, bicarbonate, Ca, Cr and other trace elements, remove harmful pesticides and organic chemicals and if needed reduce excessive calcium from water. A method to fortify and purify drinking water to meet the desire objective is described.<br>
The process of this invention involves adding a mixture of calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate (optional) and powdered activated carbon (if required) all in finally powdered form to the water which has a low level of minerals or desalinated water or water. After allowing for time for removal of pesticide and organic impurities, the contents are reacted slowly with solution of ferric chloride or a mixed solution of ferric chloride and one or more of the several chemicals described elsewhere in this specification.<br>
A modification of this process can be used for removal of calcium from water containing excessively high calcium and simultaneously replacing it with magnesium. This involves mixing the high calcium water with magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate for required reactions. Activated carbon treatment can also be given if needed.<br>
4<br><br>
The quantity of addition of ferric chloride is controlled to get mildly alkaline pH. This is achieved by restricting quantity of ferric chloride less then stoichiometric proportion when compared to mixture of calcium and magnesium carbonates and adding ferric chloride slowly. This ensures proper formation of bicarbonate ions. The reaction mass is kept in contact with air for dissolution of oxygen from air which is needed for oxidation of any divalent iron. The agitation and contact with air is repeated till all divalent iron is oxidized as can be judged by elimination of any traces of yellowish brown colour from settled water .The supernatant water is generally quite clear but if required it can be further filtered. Addition of chromium salt as stated above can give drinking water saturated with chromium hydroxide Other trace elements can be added if required as described. If higher chromium or zinc is desired in water it can be achieved by addition of citrate of these elements.<br>

Prior art and drawbacks of prior art<br>
1.	Addition of soluble salts of calcium and magnesium is quite simple process but it cannot increase bicarbonate content of water.<br>
2.	There are patented processes (US Patent Nos. 4325975 and 5786006) that describe method of mineralization of distilled water to obtain drinking water which have following major drawbacks:<br><br>
2.1.	It suggests adding nitrate salts of minerals for fortifying water as one of the alternatives. Nitrates are harmful to humans. This is one of the major drawback of these two patented processes.<br>
2.2.	Secondly, if soluble salts of minerals are added to distilled water as suggested in the above two patented processes, it will result in water which will have almost negligible bicarbonate alkalinity and such waters on prolonged use are suspected to be associated with very high death rate due to apoplexy (stroke) as observed in Japan ( ref 16). No one should take a risk of drinking water containing low or negligible bicarbonate alkalinity. Bicarbonate ions are also very crucial for providing buffering action to maintain blood pH in very narrow range which is very critical biological requirement for proper functioning of human body. If<br>
7<br><br>
blood pH is not maintained in narrow range the survival of human body will be at risk. Thus the lack of bicarbonate content in water obtained as per these patented processes is another major drawback. 2.3. These processes cannot increase chromium content of water beyond solubility limits as simple inorganic salts are used and chromium hydroxide has low solubility in water.<br>
3.	There is another patent (US Patent No. 6048553) that suggests passing pure carbon dioxide gas in suspension of oxides or hydroxides or carbonates of minerals. This process involves use of pure liquefied or solid carbon dioxide which has safety hazards and requires proper safety precautions and can be practiced in factories equipped with properly designed equipment and highly trained people. Thus this process can be implemented in factories but it can not be practiced by ordinary people at homes primarily due to safety hazards of handling of pure liquefied carbon dioxide and special equipment for handling liquefied gas.<br>
4.	None of the above three processes offer easy method of treatment of water by powdered activated  carbon for removal of harmful organic and pesticide chemicals.<br>
5.	None of these three methods can reduce calcium content of water if the same is present in excessively high concentration.<br>
6.	None of the above processes can increase chromium content of drinking water beyond solubility limits of chromium hydroxide.<br>

Summary of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of fortification and purification of water low in minerals or desalinated water comprising the steps of (1 ) mixing calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate with the said water at ambient temperature (2 ) slowly adding and reacting the same with dilute solution of mixture of ferric chloride, aluminum chloride, and aluminum sulphate ( 3 ) absorbing oxygen from air and reacting the same with reaction mixture (4 ) allowing the insoluble matter to settle ( 5 ) decanting the clear water for further use. A treatment with powder activated carbon can be given for removal of pesticide and organic impurities if desired. The method is flexible and can be used to remove excess calcium and replace the same with magnesium simultaneously by reacting with magnesium carbonate in presence of calcium carbonate. Useful trace elements can be incorporated if required. The method can also be used to overcome limitations of quantity of chromium that can be normally incorporated in drinking water due to low solubility of chromium hydroxide. This is achieved in this process by use of chromium citrate chelate by which it is possible to introduce higher<br>
8<br><br>
concentration of chromium up to few hundred micrograms per liter of water as against about 10 micrograms maximum possible in absence of chelation.<br>
This process is unique in the following respects:<br>
1.	It can increase calcium and magnesium as well as bicarbonate content of drinking water and requires simpler equipment.<br>
2.	It can reduce calcium content from water which has excessively high amounts of calcium, if required.<br>
3.	It can simultaneously reduce harmful organic and pesticide chemicals using powdered activated carbon treatment, if required and it offers a simpler method to separate powdered activated carbon from water after it's use by settling.<br>
4.	It is flexible and can also be used to enrich water with minerals like potassium and traces of zinc, lithium, boron, selenium, chromium, iodine, fluoride, if required.<br>
5.	The process is flexible and can also increase chromium content of drinking water more then solubility limits by adding chromium citrate..<br>
6.	It is possible to prepare "magnesium positive water" by adopting this process, if desired. Magnesium positive water is one which has higher magnesium content than calcium content.<br>
7.	The process can give fortified water with much higher chromium content than 10 micrograms per liter which no natural mineral water can give.<br>
Detailed description of invention and method of carrying out the same<br>
A mixture of precipitated calcium carbonate, pure magnesium carbonate (light basic ) is   mixed with naturally available soft water which may be low in minerals or with desalinated water. Powdered activated carbon ( PAC ) is added optionally if removal of pesticide or organic contamination is required. Potassium bicarbonate can be added in small quantity optionally if water with higher potassium content is desired. About 1-2 hours time is allowed for optimum adsorption of pesticide and organic impurities if PAC is added with occasional agitation. Otherwise next step can be done immediately.<br>
The above suspension of insoluble chemicals in water is reacted with ferric chloride slowly. The solution of ferric chloride may optionally contain chemicals like ferric sulfate, chlorinated ferrous sulfate (which will contain mixture of ferric chloride and ferric sulphate), aluminum chloride, aluminum sulphate, hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid,   as main reactants in any combination. If trace elements are required to be incorporated in fortified water than chromium basic sulphate, chromium chloride, chromium sulphate, zinc chloride, zinc sulphate lithium chloride , lithium sulphate, boric acid, selenic acid, potassium fluoride, sodium silico fluoride, potassium iodate are added in desired but small quantity to ensure that the final concentration of the trace element does not exceed required concentration in water. In case of use of PAC, use of aluminium or ferric compounds with or without polyelectrolyte is may be useful for coagulation and settling.<br>
9<br><br>
Although ferric chloride with small amounts of hydrochloric acid is preferable, the other substitutes mentioned above can also be used.<br>
The reaction between mixture of insoluble calcium carbonate plus magnesium carbonate in water and the solution of ferric chloride or it's substitutes is carried out slowly and under mild agitation at ambient temperature. The quantity of the later solutions is so adjusted that it is generally lesser than stoichiometric proportion as compare to calcium carbonate plus magnesium carbonate combined, for first stage of reaction for bicarbonate formation to ensure that maximum of bicarbonate is formed. The quantity of ferric chloride addition also controls dissolution of magnesium and calcium. pH of the water after reactions are completed is slightly on alkaline side. Slow addition of ferric chloride under agitation and ambient temperature and some excess of calcium carbonate is helpful in optimum formation of bicarbonate ions in solution. The quantities of chemicals can be controlled to get desired different concentration of the minerals dissolved in resultant fortified water then shown in examples. The mixture is and allowed to settle and kept for some time to allow dissolution of oxygen from air. Alternatively air is bubbled to achieve the same objective of dissolution of oxygen for oxidation of small amounts of ferrous iron that is generally present in ferric chloride. This is again agitated slowly and the process is repeated till the supernatant water is free from yellowish brown colour and is colorless. The agitation is stopped and the mixture is allowed to settle. Generally the insoluble matter obtained at this stage settles well. Alternatively a small amounts of polyeletrolyte or ferric chloride or aluminum sulphate or aluminum chloride solution is added slowly to facilitate settling. The pH of water should be maintained on slightly alkaline side by presence of unreacted calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate.<br>
The clear supernatant fortified and purified water obtained is decanted and used further. If additional amounts of zinc or chromium is desired in product water, required quantity of zinc citrate and or chromium citrate is added to the clear supernatant water. Since chromium hydroxide has low solubility of around 10 micrograms per liter, addition of chromium citrate is helpful to get a fortified water with higher chromium content even up to few hundred micrograms of Cr per liter, if required.   Potassium iodate and or fluoride can be added in required amount if fortification with iodine is desired.<br>
The method is flexible and can be used to treat water containing excessive amounts of calcium and bring about reduction of this and replace with magnesium simultaneously. This is achieved by mixing and reacting the said water with magnesium carbonate in presence of calcium carbonate and allowing to settle.<br>
Examples<br>
In all the experiments light basic magnesium carbonate and precipitated calcium carbonate was used. The other materials used are described in each experimental details. All the reactions were carried out at ambient temperature.<br>

Experiment No 1.<br>
10 liters of water containing 10, 5 and 46 milligrams / liter of calcium, magnesium and bicarbonate (HC03 ) alkalinity respectively was taken. To this was added 5.08 grams of magnesium carbonate and 2.73 grams of calcium carbonate and mixed in open vessel. Then 25.4 milliliters solution of ferric chloride ( having concentration of 108 grams ferric chloride per liter)  was added slowly to above water containing suspension of carbonates of calcium and magnesium. The addition was done slowly and under mild agitation for reactions to take place. Finally the agitation was stopped and the reaction mass was kept for contact with air for dissolution of oxygen from air. Occasionally the water and the contents were slowly agitated to improve dissolution of air from the atmosphere till the settled clear water showed no yellowish or brownish colour. The suspended insoluble solids in water at this stage showed good settling characteristics. The resultant supernatant water was quite clear. It was found to have got enriched with magnesium, calcium and bicarbonate as can be seen from the following analysis results.<br>
Analysis of water before and after treatment was as follows.<br>
Characteristic	Before treatment	After treatment<br>
Calcium as Ca ( mgs / liter)	10	11<br>
Magnesium as Mg ( mgs / liter)	5	94<br>
Bicarbonate as HC03 ( mgs / liter)	46	281<br>
Experiment no 2<br>
Five liters of water having 10, 5 and 46 milligrams / liter of calcium, magnesium and bicarbonate ions respectively was used for the experiment. 1.33 grams of magnesium carbonate and 0.81 gram of calcium carbonate was added to the above water and mixed in an open vessel. Then 6.65 milliliters of solution containing ferric chloride and aluminum chloride ( having concentration of 60 grams of ferric chloride plus 40 grams of aluminum chloride per liter) was added slowly to above water containing suspension of carbonates of calcium and magnesium. The addition was done slowly under mild agitation for reactions to take place. Finally the agitation was stopped and the reaction mass was kept for contact with air for dissolution of oxygen from air. Occasionally the water and the contents were slowly agitated to improve dissolution of air from the atmosphere till the settled clear water showed no yellowish or brownish colour. The suspended insoluble solids in water at this stage showed good settling characteristics. The resultant supernatant water was quite clear. It was found to have got enriched with magnesium, calcium and bicarbonate as can be seen from the following analysis results.<br>

11<br><br>
Experiment no 3<br>
Six liters of water having analysis as shown in the following table was treated as follows. To this water was added 2 grams of magnesium carbonate and 1 gram of calcium carbonate and mixed slowly in an open vessel for chemical reactions to take place. During next few hours occasional slow agitation was done and finally the whole mass was kept overnight without agitation for settling. The supernatant water was clear.<br>
Analysis of water before and after treatment was as follows.<br>
Characteristic	Before treatment	After treatment<br>
Calcium as Ca ( mgs / liter )	82	14<br>
Magnesium as Mg ( mgs / liter)	34	91<br>
Bicarbonate as HC03 ( mgs /liter)	381	488<br>
It can be seen that water containing high calcium ions showed reduction in calcium and increase in magnesium and bicarbonate content after the above treatment. Part of the water soluble calcium is replaced by magnesium as a result of the reaction. The water so obtained can be further adjusted for pH or bicarbonate alkalinity by usual method by adding minimum quantity of hydrochloric acid, if desired.<br>
Experiment no 4<br>
10 liters of water having 10, 5 and 46 milligrams / liter of calcium, magnesium and bicarbonate ions respectively was taken for treatment. To this was added 1.2 grams of magnesium carbonate, 0.24 gram of calcium carbonate, 0.25 gram of Potassium bicarbonate and 0.1 gram of powdered activated carbon ( PAC ) and mixed in an open vessel. This was kept for about one hour with occasional agitation for adsorption of organic impurities and pesticide, if present, by powdered activated carbon (PAC). Then 10.8 milliliters of ferric chloride solution (having concentration of 98 grams of ferric chloride per liter) was added slowly to the above suspension while under slow agitation for reactions to take place. Finally the agitation was stopped and the reaction mass was kept in contact with air for dissolution of oxygen from air. Occasionally the water and the contents were slowly agitated to improve dissolution of air from the atmosphere till the settled clear water showed no yellowish or brownish colour. The suspended insoluble solids in water at this stage showed good settling characteristics. The resultant supernatant water was quite clear. It was found to have got enriched with magnesium, calcium and bicarbonate as can be seen from the following analysis results.<br>

Experiment No 5<br>
10 liters of water having 10, 5 and 46 milligrams / liter of calcium, magnesium and bicarbonate ions respectively was taken for treatment in an open vessel. To this was added 1.2 grams of magnesium carbonate, 0.24 gram of calcium carbonate, 0.25 gram of Potassium bicarbonate and mixed. Then 8 milliliters of 1.81 Normal hydrochloric acid solution was slowly to the above suspension while under slow agitation for reactions. Finally 2.8 milliliters of ferric chloride solution ( having concentration of 98 grams of ferric chloride per liter) was added under slow agitation for chemical and physico-chemical reactions. This was then allowed to stand for some time for dissolution of oxygen from air and agitated again. This step was repeated till supernatant clear water after settling was free from yellowish brown coloration and was colorless. The mass was finally allowed to settle. The resultant supernatant water was quite clear. It was found to have got enriched with magnesium , calcium and bicarbonate minerals as can be seen from the following analysis results.<br>
Analysis of water before and after treatment was as follows.<br>
Characteristic	Before treatment	After treatment<br>
Calcium as Ca ( mgs / liter)	10	18<br>
Magnesium as Mg ( mgs / liter )	5	31<br>
Bicarbonate as HC03 ( mgs / liter)	46	127<br>
Preferred method of carrying out this invention<br>
(A) First option<br>
Preferred method of carrying out this invention is done by adding mixture of precipitated calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate (light basic ) and powdered activated carbon ( PAC ) to water containing low minerals or desalinated water or distilled water and mixing the same at ambient temperature. After keeping for 1 -2 hours (in case of use of PAC ) for adsorption of pesticides and organic impurities by PAC, a dilute solution of ferric chloride (containing small amounts of hydrochloric acid to ensure good keeping quality) is slowly added to the above suspension in about 30 to 60 minutes for reaction while the water is kept under slow agitation. If PAC treatment is not given then reaction with ferric chloride can be started immediately. Generally quantity of mixture of calcium carbonate plus magnesium carbonate is somewhat in excess then stoichiometric requirement as compared to ferric chloride plus hydrochloric acid for first stage of bicarbonate formation. This is to ensure that maximum bicarbonate is formed and undesired side reactions are prevented. pH of water after all the reactions are completed is kept mildly alkaline (pH above 7). Some excess of this mixture as compared to ferric chloride does not have too much impact on quality of final water obtained or on the process in general. The excess of calcium and magnesium carbonate is automatically trapped in coagulated mass of ferric hydroxide and settles well. The mixture is allowed to settle for few minutes and color of supernatant water is observed and if it is yellowish brown in colour the mixture is agitated slowly again and this step is repeated few times<br>
13<br><br>
till the supernatant water after settling is free from any yellowish brown colour and is colourless. This is finally allowed to settle and supernatant clear water is decanted for further use. If potassium is desired in final water it is preferable to add as potassium bicarbonate before reaction with ferric chloride so that the fortified water has some additional bicarbonate.<br>
If the traces elements of zinc, lithium, boron, chromium, selenium, are desired in the final fortified water the same are incorporated in ferric chloride in required amounts as described. Alternatively chromium citrate and or zinc citrate is added to clear decanted water. And if fluoride or iodine fortification is desired the same is done by addition of required amounts of potassium fluoride and or potassium iodate.<br>
(B) Second Option<br>
Second alternative preferred method of carrying out this invented process, is done by partially substituting ferric chloride with dilute solution of hydrochloric acid  and finally adding ferric chloride or aluminum chloride or aluminum sulphate or polyeletrolyte for facilitating good settling. The mixture of calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate is somewhat in excess then stoichiometric requirements to ensure optimum bicarbonate formation. Rest of the process for incorporating other trace minerals, if desired, remains essentially the same as described in the first option.<br>
Usefulness<br>
The method of this invention described above is capable of fortification of water containing low minerals with several useful minerals like magnesium, bicarbonate, calcium, chromium, selenium lithium, boron, potassium, fluoride, iodine which has been known to reduce cardiovascular death rates and for other health benefits. Chromium is also beneficial for diabetic people. The method offers easier method of separation of powdered activated carbon used for removal of harmful pesticides and organic contaminants and also for reduction of excess calcium from drinking water and replace by useful magnesium simultaneously..<br>
The method offers, perhaps for the first time, a possibility to incorporate many useful macro and trace minerals in desired concentration which no natural drinking water can provide.<br>
