BAND LIGATION AND COAGULATION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to devices and methods for ligating vessels and coagulating<br>
tissue.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Ligation is a well known technique for treating various types of tissue defects and lesions<br>
including varices and hemorrhoids. A target region of tissue containing the vessel can be ligated<br>
by applying an elastic cord or band to the tissue. The band stops the circulation of blood through<br>
the vessel and causes the ligated tissue to necrose and slough off. Ligation has proved to be<br>
somewhat successful in the treatment of esophageal varices.<br>
[0003] Esophageal varices are dilated or enlarged blood vessels within the wall of the<br>
esophagus. Esophageal varices are most frequently found in the lower part of the esophagus and<br>
are usually the result of obstructed blood flow through the portal vein, which carries blood from<br>
the intestine and the spleen to the liver. A common cause of this obstruction is liver disease,<br>
such as cirrhosis. For example, patients with cirrhosis develop portal hypertension which causes<br>
blood flow through the liver to be diminished. As blood flow through the liver is decreased,<br>
blood flow through the microscopic blood vessels within the esophageal wall is increased. This<br>
increase in flow causes the blood vessels to dilate. In some cases, an esophageal varix can be as<br>
large as 0.5 to 1.0 cm or larger in diameter. Other causes of esophageal varices include blood<br>
clots in the portal vein and any condition that increases pressure in the portal vein such as severe<br>
congestive heart failure. Esophageal varices cause no symptoms until they become large enough<br>
to rupture and bleed. Bleeding from esophageal varices is a life-threatening condition that<br>
requires immediate medical treatment.<br>
[0004] Endoscopic variceal ligation is an established procedure used to treat esophageal varices<br>
before a rupture occurs and is based on a technique initially used for the band ligation of<br>
hemorrhoids. This technique involves applying small, elastic "O" rings or bands to a target<br>
region of tissue to thereby mechanically ligate and strangulate the variceal channels. The<br>
application of the ligation bands to a varix is typically accomplished by means of a device<br>
- 1 -<br>
 <br>
attached to a distal end of an endoscope. Endoscopic variceal ligation is somewhat successful at<br>
treating esophageal varices, but one drawback of endoscopic variceal ligation is that varices<br>
frequently recur after being treated.<br>
[0005] While several devices are available for performing various ligation procedures, a need<br>
exists for methods and devices for ligating and coagulating a target region of tissue.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] The present invention generally provides devices and methods for ligating and<br>
coagulating tissue. In one embodiment, a surgical device is provided having an end effector, at<br>
least one ligation band, and a pair of spaced electrodes. The end effector can be adapted to<br>
access tissue at a surgical site. The at least one ligation band can be removably disposed in a<br>
delivery configuration on a portion of the end effector, and the band can be adapted to be<br>
configured in a tissue-engaging configuration upon release from the end effector. In one<br>
embodiment, the ligation band can be an elastic ring. The pair of spaced electrodes can be<br>
disposed adjacent to each other on a tissue contacting portion of the end effector.<br>
[0007] The end effector can have a variety of configurations and can be formed on, attached to,<br>
or removably matable to a distal end of an endoscope, accessory channel adapted to mate to an<br>
endoscope, or sleeve adapted to mate to an endoscope and/or accessory channel. In one<br>
embodiment, the end effector can include a cylindrical member having an outer wall defining a<br>
substantially central opening. The pair of electrodes can be disposed on a distal surface of the<br>
outer wall of the cylindrical member. The electrodes can be in communication with a current<br>
source that is adapted to be selectively energized.<br>
[0008] In one embodiment, the end effector can be removably associated with an endoscope<br>
such that a central axis of the central opening is substantially transverse to a longitudinal axis of<br>
the endoscope. The end effector can also be movable and adapted to be oriented at a selected<br>
angle with respect to a longitudinal axis of the device. The device can also be associated with a<br>
suction line that is adapted to draw tissue into the central opening of the end effector.<br>
[0009] The end effector can further include a cylindrical cap that is rotatably coupled to the<br>
cylindrical member such that rotating the cap is effective to release the at least one ligation band<br>
-2-<br>
 <br>
from the end effector. The device can also include an actuator that is operatively associated with<br>
the cap and is adapted to rotate the cap. In one embodiment, the actuator can be a pull wire<br>
having a portion that is wound around the cap and a proximally extending portion that can be<br>
manipulated by a user.<br>
[0010] In a further embodiment, the at least one ligation band can be supported in its expanded<br>
condition by a frangible ring. The frangible ring can be threadably coupled to the end effector<br>
and can be adapted to collapse under the stress applied by the ligation band upon release from<br>
the end effector. In this embodiment, the electrodes can be disposed on a portion of the frangible<br>
ring. In another embodiment, the end effector can include a flexible membrane that is adapted to<br>
release at least one ligation band.<br>
[0011] In another aspect of the invention, a method of ligating and coagulating tissue is provided<br>
and includes inserting an end effector translumenally, positioning the end effector adjacent a<br>
target region of tissue, drawing the target tissue into the opening, deploying at least one of the<br>
ligation bands to the target tissue to ligate the target tissue, and delivering current to the target<br>
tissue through the electrodes to thereby coagulate the target tissue. Alternatively, another<br>
method of ligating and coagulating tissue involves inserting an end effector translumenally,<br>
positioning the end effector adjacent a target region of tissue, drawing the target tissue into the<br>
opening, delivering current to the target tissue to thereby coagulate the target tissue, and<br>
deploying at least one of the ligation bands to the target tissue to ligate the target tissue. In one<br>
embodiment, the target tissue can be drawn into the opening by applying suction to the tissue.<br>
Deploying at least one of the ligation bands can include actuating a cylindrical cap threadably<br>
coupled to the end effector, and actuating the cylindrical cap can include, for example, rotating<br>
the cap using a pull wire wound around the cap. In one embodiment, deploying at least one of<br>
the ligation bands and delivering current to the target tissue can occur simultaneously. In another<br>
embodiment, deploying at least one of the ligation bands and delivering current to the target<br>
tissue can occur sequentially. The method can further include the step of sterilizing the device<br>
after at least one use.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0030] Certain exemplary embodiments will now be described to provide an overall<br>
understanding of the principles of the structure, function, manufacture, and use of the devices<br>
and methods disclosed herein. One or more examples of these embodiments are illustrated in the<br>
accompanying drawings. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the devices and<br>
methods specifically described herein and illustrated in the accompanying drawings are non-<br>
limiting exemplary embodiments and that the scope of the present invention is defined solely by<br>
the claims. The features illustrated or described in connection with one exemplary embodiment<br>
may be combined with the features of other embodiments. Such modifications and variations are<br>
intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0031] The present invention generally provides devices and methods for ligating and<br>
coagulating tissue. The methods and devices utilize an end effector that is adapted to access<br>
tissue to be treated at a surgical site and has the capability to both ligate and coagulate the<br>
targeted tissue. The end effector can include at least one ligation band that is removably<br>
disposed in a delivery configuration on a portion of the end effector and is adapted to be<br>
configured in a tissue-engaging configuration upon release from the end effector. The end<br>
effector can also include a pair of spaced electrodes disposed adjacent to each other on a tissue<br>
contacting portion of the end effector. The end effector can be incorporated into a variety of<br>
devices. For example, in one embodiment the end effector can be formed on, attached to, or<br>
removably matable to or deliverable through a distal end of an endoscope for ligating and/or<br>
coagulating a target region of tissue. In another embodiment, the end effector can be formed on,<br>
-5-<br>
 <br>
attached to, or removably matable to or deliverable through a distal end of an accessory channel<br>
adapted to mate to an endoscope, or sleeve adapted to mate to an endoscope and/or accessory<br>
channel. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the end effector can be used with a<br>
variety of surgical tools and devices, including various other endoscopic and laparoscopic tools<br>
and devices, as well as tools and devices used in other surgical procedures.<br>
[0032] FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate one exemplary embodiment of a ligation and coagulation device<br>
10 for use with an endoscope 18 and having an end effector 12, at least one ligation band 14<br>
removably disposed on a portion of the end effector 12, and-a pair of electrodes 16 disposed<br>
adjacent to each other on a tissue contacting portion of the end effector 12. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, a proximal portion 20a (FIG. 2) of the end effector 12 is adapted to removably<br>
mate to a distal end of an endoscope 18 and a distal portion 20b (FIG. 2) of the end effector<br>
includes a cylindrical member 11 that is positioned transverse to a longitudinal axis L of the<br>
endoscope 18. A pair of spaced electrodes 16 are disposed adjacent to each other on a tissue<br>
contacting portion of the cylindrical member 11 and are adapted to coagulate a target region of<br>
tissue. The electrodes 16 can be configured to have a variety of shapes, spacing, and sizes. At<br>
least one ligation band 14 is removably disposed in a delivery configuration on a portion of the<br>
cylindrical member 11, and the band 14 is adapted to be configured in a tissue-engaging<br>
configuration upon release from the cylindrical member 11 to thereby ligate the targeted tissue.<br>
A cylindrical cap 13 can be rotatably coupled to the cylindrical member 11, and an actuator 15<br>
can be operatively associated with the cap 13 and adapted to rotate the cap 13. In use, rotating<br>
the cap 13 is effective to release the at least one ligation band 14 from the cylindrical member<br>
11. The device can thus be used in conjunction with an endoscope 18 to ligate and coagulate a<br>
target region of tissue.<br>
[0033] The end effector 12 can have various shapes and sizes, but in one exemplary<br>
embodiment, as shown in more detail in FIGS. 2-2C, the end effector 12 is in the form of a frame<br>
20 having a proximal portion 20a that is removably matable to a distal end of an endoscope, an<br>
arm 22 that extends from the proximal portion 20a along a longitudinal axis L of the endoscope,<br>
and a cylindrical member 11 that is disposed at a distal end 20b of the arm 22 and oriented<br>
transverse to the longitudinal axis L of the endoscope. The end effector 12 is shown as a rigid<br>
structure, however, the end effector can be movable and adapted to be oriented at a selected<br>
-6-<br>
 <br>
angle with respect to a longitudinal axis L of the device. For example, the end effector 12 can be<br>
jointed or can include a ratcheting mechanism to facilitate positioning the device. As shown in<br>
FIG. 2A, the proximal portion 20a of the end effector 12 is adapted to removably mate to a distal<br>
end of an endoscope. In the illustrated embodiment, the proximal portion 20a of the end effector<br>
12 is in the form of a cylindrical collar 24 that is adapted to slidably engage a distal end of an<br>
endoscope. Various techniques can be used to secure the end effector 12 to an endoscope such<br>
as a snap-fit, interference fit, or threaded engagement. Although the end effector 12 is shown<br>
and described in conjunction with an endoscope, a person skilled in the art will appreciate that<br>
the end effector 12 can also be removably matable to, formed on or deliverable through an<br>
accessory channel or a sleeve slidably disposable over an endoscope.<br>
[0034] As further shown in FIG. 2A, the end effector 12 can have an arm 22 extending distally<br>
from the cylindrical collar 24. In the illustrated embodiment, the arm 22 connects the proximal<br>
and distal portions 20a, 20b of the end effector 12 and extends along the longitudinal axis L of<br>
the device. The arm can have a lumen or bore 26 extending therethrough to facilitate fluid<br>
delivery and/or suction through the end effector 12. Blood or other debris present during a<br>
procedure, for example, can be cleared by means of a fluid delivered under pressure to the<br>
surgical site. Suction, for example, can be useful to allow the targeted tissue to be drawn into<br>
contact with the end effector 12. In one embodiment shown in FIG. 2A, the proximal end 26a of<br>
the bore is adapted to removably mate to a suction line 17 (FIG. 1) that extends proximally from<br>
the end effector 12 and is connected to a vacuum source at a proximal end (not shown). The<br>
distal end of the bore 26 is associated with a cylindrical member 11 that is described below in<br>
detail. Although the arm 22 is shown and described as facilitating suction to draw the targeted<br>
tissue into contact with the end effector 12, the arm 22 can also facilitate the introduction of<br>
another device for drawing the tissue into contact with the end effector 12. For example, the<br>
bore 26 can serve as an entry port for a tissue grasper or other tool.<br>
[0035] As indicated above, the distal end of the arm 22 can be associated with a cylindrical<br>
member 11. In one exemplary embodiment, illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 2A, the cylindrical<br>
member 11 has an outer wall 1 la defining a substantially central opening 28. As shown, the<br>
cylindrical member 11 extends downward from the arm 22 and is oriented such that the central<br>
axis C of the central opening 28 is substantially transverse to the longitudinal axis L of the<br>
-7-<br>
 <br>
device. The central opening 28 can also be in communication with the bore 26 that extends<br>
through the arm 22. As explained above, this configuration allows the targeted tissue to be<br>
drawn into the central opening 28 of the cylindrical member 11 by applying suction to the end<br>
effector 12 or an alternative technique such as inserting a tissue grasper. The cylindrical member<br>
11 can also include a pair of spaced electrodes 16 disposed adjacent to each other on a distal<br>
surface 1 lb of the outer wall lla. In an exemplary embodiment, the electrodes 16 are in a co-<br>
planar, parallel arrangement. Such a configuration encourages deeper, submucosal tissue<br>
damage which works to prevent the recurrence of the defect being treated. The co-planar<br>
arrangement can also reduce adhesion of the treated tissue to the electrodes 16. The electrodes<br>
16 can also be positioned such that they are in contact with the targeted tissue when the vacuum<br>
source or other means is activated to draw the tissue into the central opening 28 of the end<br>
effector 12. The electrodes 16 can be in communication with a current source (not shown) such<br>
that they can be selectively energized to coagulate the targeted tissue. Various current sources<br>
can be used to energize the electrodes 16. For example, in one exemplary embodiment, the<br>
electrodes 16 can be in communication with an RF generator. As shown in FIGS. 2 and 2A, the<br>
cylindrical member 11 can further include threads 23 formed on a portion of an outer surface<br>
thereof. The threads 23 can be adapted to mate with complementary threads 25 formed on an<br>
inner surface of a cylindrical cap 13 which is discussed in more detail below. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the threads 23 are formed on the portion of the cylindrical member 11 that is<br>
adjacent to the arm 22 of the end effector 12. The non-threaded portion of the cylindrical<br>
member 11 can be adapted to support at least one ligation band 14 in a delivery configuration.<br>
[0036] At least one ligation band 14 can be disposed in a delivery configuration (e.g., a<br>
configuration having an expanded diameter) on a portion of the end effector 12 and be adapted to<br>
be configured in a tissue-engaging configuration (e.g., a configuration having a reduced<br>
diameter) upon release from the end effector 12. In one exemplary embodiment, shown in FIG.<br>
1, multiple bands 14 are disposed on the non-threaded portion of the cylindrical member 11<br>
adjacent the target region of tissue. In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1, 2, and 2C, the<br>
ligation band 14 takes the form of an elastic, O-shaped ring. However, the ligation band 14 can<br>
be any shape and size so long as it can be disposed on a portion of the end effector 12 and<br>
engage tissue upon release from the end effector 12.<br>
-8-<br>
 <br>
[0037] As indicated above, a cap 13 can be rotatably coupled to the cylindrical member 11. The<br>
cap 13 can have various shapes and sizes, but in one exemplary embodiment, as shown in FIGS.<br>
1 and 2, the cap is in the form of a hollow cylinder having threads 25 formed on an inner surface<br>
thereof. The threads 25 formed on the inner surface of the cap 13 can be adapted to mate with<br>
the threads 23 formed on the outer surface of the cylindrical member 11, and the cap 13 can be<br>
sized such that it can be rotatably coupled to the cylindrical member 11. The cap 13 and<br>
cylindrical member 11 can be configured such that rotating the cap 13 is effective to release at<br>
least one ligation band 14 from the end effector 12. Various configurations and techniques can<br>
be used to release at least one ligation band 14, but in one embodiment the cap 13 can be rotated<br>
with respect to the cylindrical member 11. By rotating the cap 13, the cap 13 can be advanced<br>
along the cylindrical member 11 until it comes into contact with at least one ligation band 14,<br>
which is positioned distally of the cap. Further advancement of the cap 13 is effective to push<br>
the ligation band 14 off of the end effector 12 and into a tissue-engaging configuration where the<br>
band 14 is disposed around the target region of tissue. Interruptions in the smooth surfaces of the<br>
threads in the cap can be employed to detent the releases of individual ligating bands and provide<br>
tactile feedback to the user.<br>
[0038] The end effector 12 can further include an actuator 15 that is operatively associated with<br>
the cap 13 and effective to rotate the cap 13 upon actuation. A variety of mechanisms can be<br>
used to rotate the cap 13, but in one embodiment, shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the actuator 15 is in<br>
the form of a pull wire 15 that is wound around the cap 13. A distal end of the pull wire 15 can<br>
be fixed to the cap 13 by, for example, achieving an interference fit between the wire 15 and a<br>
cutout 27 in the cap 13. A proximal portion of the wire can extend proximal ly from the cap such<br>
that it can be manipulated by a user. While the device is shown with a pull wire 15, a person<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate that the actuator 15 can also be in the form of a cable, braided<br>
rope, or other flexible cord. The actuator 15 can be made from any flexible material suitable for<br>
being wound around the cap 13. In use, the actuator can slide along the longitudinal axis L of<br>
the device, and the axial force can be converted to a rotational force to cause the cap 13 to rotate.<br>
[0039] The present invention also provides methods for ligating and coagulating a target region<br>
of tissue. In one exemplary embodiment, shown in FIGS. 3-8, the ligation/coagulation device 10<br>
can be mated to a distal end of an endoscope 18, and the endoscope 18 can be inserted<br>

translumenally and positioned adjacent the target region of tissue 30. Once the device 10 is<br>
positioned in the body proximate to the procedure site (e.g., positioned adjacent a varix or<br>
hemorrhoid), a fluid such as water or saline can be injected through the suction line 17 to clear<br>
the area of blood or other debris. As shown in FIG. 4, the target tissue 30 can be drawn into the<br>
central opening of the end effector by activating the vacuum source (not shown). Once the target<br>
tissue 30 is captured within the end effector, as illustrated in FIG. 5, current can be delivered<br>
through the electrodes to thereby coagulate the tissue. FIG. 5 shows the deep, subrnuscosal<br>
tissue damage 50 resulting from the parallel electrode arrangement described above. With the<br>
target tissue still captured within the end effector, at least one ligation band can be deployed to<br>
thereby ligate the tissue. As shown in FIG. 6, force can be applied to the pull wire 15 to rotate<br>
the cap 13 with respect to the cylindrical member. FIG. 7 illustrates that continued rotation of<br>
the cap 13 is effective to push at least one ligation band 14 off of the end effector and into a<br>
tissue-engaging configuration (e.g., having a reduced diameter) where the band 14 is disposed<br>
around the target region of tissue 30. Although the procedure is shown and described as<br>
coagulation followed by ligation, a person skilled in the art will appreciate that ligation can occur<br>
before coagulation or the two can occur simultaneously. As shown in FIG. 8, once the<br>
coagulation and/or ligation is complete, the vacuum source can be deactivated and the device can<br>
be removed. The treated tissue 30, including the defect, will eventually slough off leaving<br>
fibrous tissue in place and preventing the reformation of such a defect.<br>
[0040] As indicated above, the end effector can have various configurations. FIGS. 9-10A<br>
illustrate additional exemplary end effector embodiments. As shown in FIG. 9, the end effector<br>
90 can include a cylindrical member 92 that is rotatably disposed within a housing 94, an<br>
actuator 96 that is operatively associated with the cylindrical member 92, a frangible ring 98 that<br>
is threadably coupled to the cylindrical member 92 and is adapted to support a ligaition band 14<br>
in a delivery configuration, and a pair of electrodes disposed on a distal surface of the end<br>
effector 90.<br>
[0041] The housing 94 can have various configurations, but in one exemplary embodiment,<br>
shown in FIGS. 9 and 9A, the housing 94 is formed to fit around the cylindrical member 92 such<br>
that the cylindrical member 92 is supported by the housing 94 but allowed to rotate within the<br>
housing 94. The housing 94 can be formed on, attached to, or removably matable to or<br>
-10-<br>
 <br>
deliverable through a distal end of an endoscope, accessory channel adapted to mate to an<br>
endoscope, or sleeve adapted to mate to an endoscope and/or accessory channel. For example, in<br>
one embodiment, the housing 94 can include an arm (not shown) that extends proximally from<br>
the housing and which has a cylindrical collar disposed at a proximal end that is adapted to<br>
slidably engage a distal end of an endoscope. Various techniques can be used to secure the collar<br>
to an endoscope such as a snap-fit, interference fit, or threaded engagement. In another<br>
embodiment, the housing 94 can include an opening formed from a resilient material to<br>
accommodate a press-fit between an endoscope and the housing. The opening can also be sized<br>
to provide a loose fit between the end effector and an endoscope and a set screw can be used to<br>
secure the end effector to the endoscope. The housing 94 can also include a plurality of openings<br>
to facilitate a connection to a fluid delivery and/or a suction line, a release of one or more<br>
ligation bands, an introduction of an actuator, and/or a connection to a current source.<br>
[0042] The actuator 96 can also have a variety of configurations, but as indicated above, in an<br>
exemplary embodiment, the actuator 96 is operatively associated with the cylindrical member 92.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 9 and 9B, the actuator 96 is in the form of a pull wire 96 having a distal<br>
portion 96b that is wound around the cylindrical member 92 and a proximal portion 96a that<br>
extends out of the housing 94 and to the user (not shown). While the device is shown with a pull<br>
wire 96, a person skilled in the art will appreciate that the actuator 96 can also be in the form of a<br>
cable, braided rope, or other flexible cord. Further, the actuator can be in the form of an electro-<br>
mechanical component. The actuator 96 can be made from any flexible material suitable for<br>
being wound around the cylindrical member 92. To increase friction between the cylindrical<br>
member 92 and the actuator 96 and to prevent the actuator 96 from slipping, the cylindrical<br>
member 92 can include a sticky or textured surface and/or the actuator 96 can be wound around<br>
the cylindrical member 92 multiple times. In use, the actuator 96 can slide along the longitudinal<br>
axis of the device, and the axial force can be converted to a rotational force to case the<br>
cylindrical member to rotate within the housing.<br>
[0043]   FIGS. 9 and 9B illustrate one exemplary embodiment of the cylindrical member 92. As<br>
shown, the cylindrical member 92 has an outer wall defining a substantially central opening 93<br>
and is oriented in the housing 94 such that the central axis C of the central opening 93 is<br>
substantially transverse to the longitudinal axis of the device. The central opening 93 can also be<br>
-11-<br>
 <br>
in communication with a fluid delivery and/or a suction line. The suction line feaiture is useful to<br>
enable the targeted tissue can be drawn into the central opening 93 of the cylindrical member 92.<br>
In other embodiments, tissue can be drawn into the central opening 93 by inserting a tissue<br>
grasper or other tool through the central opening 93. As indicated above, a proximal portion 92a<br>
of the cylindrical member 92 can be operatively associated with the actuator 96 such that<br>
applying force to the actuator 96 is effective to rotate the cylindrical member 92 within the<br>
housing 94. A distal portion of the cylindrical member 92b can have threads 95 formed on an<br>
outer surface thereof for mating with complementary threads 99 formed on a frangible ring 98.<br>
[0044] The frangible ring 98 is preferably configured to threadably mate to the cylindrical<br>
member 92 and support at least one ligation band 14 in its expanded condition. As shown in<br>
FIGS. 9, 9B, and 9C, a ligation band 14 is disposed in a delivery configuration (e.g., expanded<br>
diameter) on the frangible ring 98. The frangible ring 98 can have threads 99 formed on an inner<br>
surface thereof for mating with the threads 95 formed on the cylindrical member 92. The<br>
frangible ring 98 can have a variety of configurations, but in an exemplary embodiment, shown<br>
in FIG. 9C, the frangible ring 98 is sized and shaped such that it fits snugly within the housing 94<br>
and cannot rotate with respect to the housing 94. As shown, the frangible ring 98 is substantially<br>
round but can include a flat portion 98a that corresponds to a similarly shaped portion of the<br>
housing 94 and is effective to prevent the ring 98 from rotating within the housing 94. In use,<br>
the actuator 96 can be used to rotate the cylindrical member 92 with respect to the frangible ring<br>
98. The housing 94 can work to hold the frangible ring 98 in a fixed position thereby allowing<br>
the cylindrical member 92 to be threadably decoupled from the frangible ring 98. The frangible<br>
ring 98 can be configured such that upon release from the cylindrical member 92 the ring 98<br>
collapses under the stress applied by the ligation band 14 and the band 14 engages the targeted<br>
tissue. The frangible ring 98 can be formed of a material adapted to be absorbed by the body or<br>
the ring can simply be passed by the patient.<br>
[0045] As with the embodiments described above, the end effector shown in FIGS. 9-9C can<br>
also include a pair of spaced electrodes disposed adjacent to each other on a distal facing surface.<br>
The electrodes can be disposed on a variety of distal facing surfaces. For example, the electrodes<br>
can be disposed on the housing, cylindrical member, or frangible ring. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the electrodes are in a co-planar, parallel arrangement and can be positioned such<br>
- 12-<br>
 <br>
that they are in contact with the target region of tissue when the targeted tissue is drawn into the<br>
central opening of the end effector. The electrodes can also be in communication with a current<br>
source (not shown) such that they can be selectively energized to coagulate the targeted tissue.<br>
Various current sources can be used to energize the electrodes. For example, in one exemplary<br>
embodiment, the electrodes can be in communication with an RF generator.<br>
[0046] FIGS. 10 and 10A illustrate another exemplary embodiment of an end effector 100<br>
having a flexible membrane 110 that is adapted to release at least one ligation band 14. As<br>
shown, the end effector 100 includes a housing 120, a flexible membrane 110, and a collar 130<br>
having at least one ligation band 14 and a pair of electrodes disposed thereon. The housing 120<br>
can have various configurations, but in one exemplary embodiment, shown in FIG. 10, the<br>
housing 120 is sized and shaped to support the collar 130 and flexible membrane 110 but allow<br>
the collar 130 and membrane 110 to move in a direction that is transverse to the longitudinal axis<br>
of the device. The collar 130 can be operatively associated with the flexible membrane 110 such<br>
that the two elements move together as a unit. FIG. 10 illustrates that the flexible membrane 110<br>
and collar 130 are seated within the housing 120 with a portion of the collar 130 extending<br>
through an opening in a bottom facing surface of the housing. This opening can be sized such<br>
that it is large enough for the collar 130 to easily move in and out of the housing 120 but small<br>
enough to prevent any ligation bands 14 disposed on the collar 130 from passing into the housing<br>
120. The housing 120 can also include an opening 140 on a proximal facing surface to facilitate<br>
a connection to a suction line. As with the housing described above, the housing 120 shown in<br>
FIG. 10 can be formed on, attached to, or removably matable to or deliverable through a distal<br>
end of an endoscope, accessory channel adapted to mate to an endoscope, or sleeve adapted to<br>
mate to an endoscope and/or accessory channel. In use, a vacuum source (not shown) can be<br>
activated to cause the flexible membrane 110 and collar 130 to move toward an upper portion<br>
120a of the housing 120. As the collar 130 is pulled upward, the housing 120 acts against the<br>
ligation bands 14 disposed on the collar 130 to release at least one band 14 from the collar 130<br>
and thereby engage the targeted tissue. As with the above embodiments, the electrodes disposed<br>
on the collar can be used to coagulate the targeted tissue before, after, or during the ligation step.<br>
[0047] A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention has application in<br>
conventional endoscopic and open surgical instrumentation as well application in robotic-<br>
- 13-<br>
 <br>
assisted surgery.<br>
[0048] The devices disclosed herein can be designed to be disposed of after a single use, or they<br>
can be designed to be used multiple times. In either case, however, the device can be<br>
reconditioned for reuse after at least one use. Reconditioning can include any combination of the<br>
steps of disassembly of the device, followed by cleaning or replacement of particular pieces, and<br>
subsequent reassembly. In particular, the device can be disassembled, and any number of the<br>
particular pieces or parts of the device can be selectively replaced or removed in any<br>
combination. Upon cleaning and/or replacement of particular parts, the device can be<br>
reassembled for subsequent use either at a reconditioning facility, or by a surgical team<br>
immediately prior to a surgical procedure. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that<br>
reconditioning of a device can utilize a variety of techniques for disassembly,<br>
cleaning/replacement, and reassembly. Use of such techniques, and the resulting reconditioned<br>
device, are all within the scope of the present application.<br>
[0049] Preferably, the invention described herein will be processed before surgery. First, a new<br>
or used instrument is obtained and if necessary cleaned. The instrument can then be sterilized.<br>
In one sterilization technique, the instrument is placed in a closed and sealed container, such as a<br>
plastic or TYVEK bag. The container and instrument are then placed in a field of radiation that<br>
can penetrate the container, such as gamma radiation, x-rays, or high-energy electrons. The<br>
radiation kills bacteria on the instrument and in the container. The sterilized instrument can then<br>
be stored in the sterile container. The sealed container keeps the instrument sterile until it is<br>
opened in the medical facility.<br>
[0050] It is preferred that device is sterilized. This can be done by any number of ways known<br>
to those skilled in the art including beta or gamma radiation, ethylene oxide, steam.<br>
[0051] One skilled in the art will appreciate further features and advantages of the invention<br>
based on the above-described embodiments. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited by<br>
what has been particularly shown and described, except as indicated by the appended claims. All<br>
