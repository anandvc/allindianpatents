THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
SPECIFICATION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention a friction stir welding tool to friction-stir-weld a high-melting point member, a friction stir welding method, and a workpiece obtained by the friction stir welding method. BACKGROUND ART<br>
As a method of welding a metal, a technique of a frictionstirweldingmethodisdisclosed (forexample, see Patent Document 1 or 2) . The friction stir welding method which brings objects to be worked into contact with each other or brings objects to be worked into almost contact with each other to regulate an elongate bonding region, moves a friction stir welding tool inserted into the bonding region while rotating the friction stir welding tool, and welds the objects to be worked by using frictional heat. The friction stir welding method is a welding method which can welds metals such as iron or aluminum alloy to each other but also different materials to each other.<br>
As a friction stir welding method, welding for aluminumandanaluminumalloyeachhavinga relatively lowmelting point is frequently examined- It is slightly reported that a friction stir welding method is applied by using a metal or an alloy having a high melting point of 1350°C or more as a high<br>
2<br><br>
melting point as an object to be worked. However, a technique which welds platinum having a high melting point is disclosed (for example, see Patent Document 3).<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application National Publication (Laid-Open) No. 7-505090<br>
Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent Application National Publication (Laid-Open) No. 9-508073<br>
Patent Document 3: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 2004-090050 Disclosure of the Invention Problem to be Solved by the Invention<br>
However, when an object to be worked having a high melting point is used, heat generated by friction between a friction stir welding tool and the object to be worked must be increased to a temperature higher than that generated when an object to be worked having a relatively low melting point such as aluminum or an aluminum alloy. Therefore, since the friction stir welding tool must weld an object to be worked having a high melting point and have a long life, the friction stir welding tool requires chemical stability, heat resistance, abrasion resistance, and thermal shock resistance which withstand a high temperature generated by friction.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a friction stir welding tool which, even though an object to be worked containing a metal or an alloy having a high melting point of 1350°C or more is friction-stir-welded, mixes<br>

a small amount of impurity, has small abrasion, and is difficult to be broken, and to stably realize friction stir welding by using the tool. Means for Solving the Problem<br>
The present inventors examined various compositions of material forming a friction stir welding tool. As a result, when the friction stir welding tool was formed by an alloy having a composition containing iridium and a predetermined element as a sub-component, it was found that an object to be worked having a high melting point could be stably fr ict ion-stir-welded, and the pre sent invention could be completed. More specifically, the friction stir welding tool according to the present invention is a friction stir welding tool which can friction-stir-weld a metal or an alloy having a high melting point of 1350°C or more as an object to be worked. At least a portion to be brought into contact with the object to be worked has a composition containing iridium, containing rhenium, ruthenium, molybdenum, tungsten, niobium, tantalum, rhodium, or two or more of them, and containing zirconium, hafnium, lanthanum, cerium, samarium, gadolinium, scandium, yttrium, or two or more of them and has a Micro Vickers Hardness of 300 Hv or more.<br>

In the friction stir welding tool according to the present invention, the portion brought into contact with the object to be worked is preferably formed by a quaternary alloy which contains iridium, 1.0 to 35.0 atomic percentages of molybdenum or tungsten, 1. 0 to 18 . 0 atomic percentages of rhodium,<br>
5<br><br>
andO. 1 to 5. Oatomicpercentagesof zirconium, hafnium, lanthanum, cerium, samarium, gadolinium, scandium, or yttrium.<br>
In the friction stir welding tool according to the present invention, the portion brought into contact with the object to be worked is preferably formed by a quaternary alloy which contains iridium, 1. 0 to 25 . 0 atomic percentages of niobium or tantalum, 1.0 to 18.0 atomic percentages of rhodium, and 0.1 to5.Oatomicpercentagesofzirconium,hafnium,lanthanum,cerium, samarium, gadolinium, scandium, or yttrium.<br>

Rear surface sides of the objects to be worked also increase to a considerably high temperature. Therefore, a back plate consisting of a material having chemical stability, heat resistance, and thermal shock resistance which can withstand the high temperature or a back plate coated with the film having the composition are applied to the friction stir welding tool to make it possible to prevent the back plate from being fused and prevent impurity from the back plate from being mixed.<br>

The present invention will be described below in detail. However, the present invention is not limited to the description. First, processes ofafriction stir welding method and a friction stirring junction devices will be described below with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
The friction stir welding method includes: the step of bringing objects to be worked 1A and 1B into contact with each other or bringing the objects to be worked 1A and 1B into almost contact with each other to regulate an elongate bonding<br>
9<br><br>
region 2; the step of inserting a friction stir welding tool 3 into an bonding region 2 while being rotated to generate frictional heat between the friction stir welding tool 3 and the elongate bonding region 2; and the step of generating the plasticized region in bonding region which generates heat; and the step of welding the objects to be worked. After the welding, the friction stir welding tool 3 is removed from the bonding region 2.<br>
The friction stir welding tool 3 includes a columnar shoulder portion 5 and a pencil portion 4 formed on an end face of the shoulder portion 5. The friction stir welding tool 3 is rotated by a motor 7. Since friction between the friction stir welding tool 3 and the objects to be worked 1A and 1B must be performed, the objects to be worked 1A and 1B must be brought into contact with each other. The objects to be worked may be brought into almost contact with each other under a condition in that the friction is performed. The bonding region 2 must be elongate to perform continuous welding without performing spot welding. When the bonding region 2has a large space, friction between the friction stir welding tool 3 and the objects to be worked 1A and 1B is not performed. Furthermore, the friction stir welding tool 3 must withstand frictional heat, and must have a strength which can withstand torsional stress caused by rotation. A back plate 6 is arranged on rear surface sides of the objects to be worked 1A and 1B.<br>
A principle of the friction stir welding method will<br>
10<br><br>
be described below. The objects to be worked 1A and 1B are confronted with each other, the friction stir welding tool 3 is rotated, and the pencil portion 4 is slowly inserted into a confront line serving as the bonding region 2. At this time, an end face of the columnar shoulder portion 5 on which the pencil portion 4 is arranged and the surfaces of the objects to be worked 1A and 1B are brought into contact with each other. The length of the pencil portion 4 is set to be necessary for a welding depth. When the friction stir welding tool 3 is rotated and brought into contact with the bonding region 2, friction sharply heat a material at a contact point. As a result, the material is deteriorated inmechanical strength. When the force is further applied, the friction stir welding tool 3 kneads the material along a moving direction 8 and pushes out the material. In the bonding region 2, frictional heat generated by the rotating shoulder port ion 5 and the rotating pencil port ion 4 of the friction stir welding tool 3 creates a high-temperat ureplastici zed region on the end face portion of the shoulder portion 5 and a metal around the pencil portion 4. When the objects to be worked 1A and 1B move in a direction opposite to the moving direction of the friction stir welding tool 3 or move in the moving direction, theplasticized metal is col lapsed at the front end of the friction stir welding tool 3 in the moving direction 8 and move to the rear end by mechanical stirring, the shape of the friction stir welding tool 3, and a forging operation by a rotating direction. As a result, the welding portion on the front surface of the<br>
11<br><br>
friction stir welding tool 3 is heated to create a plasticized region. An oxide film which is present on the object to be worked is broken, and the plasticized region is welded at the rear end of the friction stir welding tool 3 while stirring a collapsed metal.<br>
The friction stir welding method has the following merits. Cracks do not occur, an alloy component can be intactly held without a loss of an alloy element caused by evaporation of a deposit metal, and a fine grain structure is formed in the deposit metal by injection, stirring, and a forging operation of the welding tool.<br>
The friction stir welding tool 3 according to the embodiment is a friction stir welding tool which can friction-stir-weld a metal or an alloy having a high melting point of 1350°C or more as an object to be worked, at least a portion brought into contact with the object to be worked has acompositioncontainingiridium,containingrhenium,ruthenium, molybdenum, tungsten, niobium, tantalum, rhodium, or two or more of them, and containing zirconium, hafnium, lanthanum, cerium, samarium, gadolinium, scandium, yttrium, or two or more of them and has a Micro Vickers Hardness of 300 Hv or more.<br>
In the friction stir welding tool according to the embodiment, an object to be worked for welding is a metal or an alloy having a high melting point of 1350°C or more. As a matter of course, the friction stir welding tool can be used to weld a metal or an alloy having a melting point of lower than<br>
12<br><br>
1350°C. As several examples of the metal or the alloy having the high melting point of 1350°C or more, a titanium, a titanium-based alloy, platinum, a platinum-based alloy, a stainless steel, and a steel having a carbon content of 2% by weight or less are given. In this case, the stainless steel is steel containing chromium of 12% or more, and includes all amartensitic stainless steel, a ferritic steel, and an austenite steel- Furthermore, the stainless steel includes a duplex stainless steel having a ferritic/austenite two-phase mixture compositionanda PH stainless steel. In the friction stir welding tool 3 according to the embodiment, when friction stir welding isperformedbyusinganobjecttobeworked,forexample, titanium, a titanium-based alloy, platinum, or a platinum-based alloy as a metal or an alloy having a high melting point of 1600°C or more, the tool containing zirconium or/and hafnium selected from a group consisting of zirconium, hafnium, lanthanum, cerium, samarium, gadolinium, scandium, and yttrium is preferably used.<br>
Objects to be worked which are confronted with each other may have different compositions. Furthermore, the metal and the alloy having the high melting point according to the embodiment includes an oxide-dispersion-strengthened metal or alloy in which oxide fine particles of a zirconium oxide, an aluminum oxide, an yttrium oxide, a hafnium oxide, or the like.<br>
Portions to be brought into contact with an object to be worked are the columnar shoulder portion 5 and the pencil portion 4 formed on the end face of the shoulder portion 5 with<br>
13<br><br>
reference to fIG. 1. At least the portion especially requires chemical stability, heat resistance, abrasion resistance, and thermal shock resistance. In FIG. 1, the shoulder portion 5 is formed to be long, and the motor 7 is attached to the shoulder portion 5. However, for example, a shaft portion {not shown) formed by another material may be fixed to the upper end portion of the shoulder portion 5, and the motor 7 may be attached to the shaft portion. Since the shaft portion is not directly rubbed, the required characteristics are not required highly more than those of the portion brought into contact with the object to be worked. Since the shaft portion serves as a shaft, the shaft portion requires torsional strength. Although the shaft portion is not a portion brought into contact with the object to be worked, the shaft portion may be formed by the same material as that of the shoulder portion 5 and the pencil portion 4.<br>
The portion brought into contact with the object to be worked is formed by a material having a compos it ion containing iridium, containing rhenium, ruthenium, molybdenum, tungsten, niobium, tantalum, rhodium, or two or more of them, and containing zirconium, hafnium, lanthanum, cerium, samarium, gadolinium, scandium, yttrium, or two or more of them. When objects to be worked having a high melting point of 1350°C or more are friction-stir-welded, the friction stir welding tool is rotated while being pressed on the bonding regions of the objects to be worked. For this reason, compression stress and torsional stress act while the friction stir welding tool is heated to<br>
14<br><br>
a temperature close to a melting point of the objects to be worked.<br>
When the friction stir welding tool is formed by the material having the composition, material strength and material hardness are improved by adding rhenium, ruthenium, molybdenum, tungsten, niobium, ortantalum. Additionof rhodium improves chemical stability to oxidation attrition in a high-temperature usable atmosphere. Addition of zirconium, hafnium, lanthanum, cerium, samarium, gadolinium, scandium, or yttrium improves material strength and material hardness and achieves refinement of crystal grains. These operations reduces abrasion of the tool by friction between the tool and the objects to be worked to reduce mixing of an impurity in the objects to be worked.<br>
The friction stir welding tool is formed by these materials to obtain high-temperature strength. Even though compression stress and torsional stress act during the operation, the friction stir welding tool can withstand the compression stress and the torsional stress. Since the friction stir welding tool has preferable thermal shock resistance, even though an increase/decrease in temperature is repeated each time the operation is performed, the friction stir welding tool is scarcely broken by the increase/decrease in temperature.<br>
Furthermore, since a portion brought into contact with the objects to be worked requires abrasion resistance, the portion must be formed by a material having the composition and Micro Vickers Hardness of 300 Hv or more. The Micro Vickers<br>
15<br><br>
Hardness is preferably 390 Hv or more, and more preferably 490 Hv or more. The hardness of the friction stir welding tool according to the embodiment was evaluated by a Micro Vickers Hardnesstest (JIS-Z2244) . Whenthetoolis formedbythematerial having a Micro Vickers Hardness of less than 300 Hv, the tool is easily worn by friction between the object to be worked and the tool. For this reason, the tool has a short life time.<br>
A  measurement of the Micro Vickers Hardness is measured by the Micro Vickers Hardness test (JIS-Z2244) after the heat treatment at 1350°C.<br>
In the friction stir welding tool according to the embodiment, at least the portion brought into contact with the objects to be worked is formed by a ternary alloy, a quaternary alloy, a quinary or more alloy. However, for example, types of the ternary alloy will be described below. The types are expressed by using atomic symbols.<br>
As the types of the ternary alloys, for example, an Ir-Re-Zr-base, an Ir-Ru-Zr-base, an Ir-Mo-Zr-base, an Ir-W-Zr-base, an Ir-Nb-Zr-base, an Ir-Ta-Zr-base, an Ir-Rh-2r-base, an Ir-Re-Hf-base, an Ir-Ru-Hf-base, an Ir-Mo-Hf-base, ir-W-Hf-base, anlr-Nb-Hf-base, anIr-Ta-Hf-base, an Ir-Rh-Hf-base, an Ir-Re-La-base, an Ir-Ru-La-base, an Ir-Mo-La-base, an   Ir-W-La-base, an Ir-Nb-La-base, an Ir-Ta-La-base, an Ir-Rh-La-base, an Ir-Re-Ce-base, Ir-Ru-Ce-base, an Ir-Mo-Ce-base, an Ir-W-Ce-base, an Ir-Nb-Ce-base, an Ir-Ta-Ce-base, an Ir-Rh-Ce-base, an<br>
16<br><br>
Ir-Re-Sm-base, an Ir-Ru-Sm-base, an Ir-Mo-Sm-base, an Ir-W-Sm-base, an Ir-Nb-Sm-base, an Ir-Ta-Sm-base, an Ir-Rh-Sm-base, an Ir-Re-Gd-base, an Ir-Ru-Gd-base, an Ir-Mo-Gd-base, an Ir-W-Gd-base, an Ir-Nb-Gd-base, an Ir-Ta-Gd-base, an Ir-Rh-Gd-base, an Ir-Re-Sc-base, an Ir-Ru-Sc-base, an Ir-Mo-Sc-base, an Ir-W-Sc-base, an Ir-Nb-Sc-base, an Ir-Ta-Sc-base, an Ir-Rh-Sc-base, an Ir-Re-Y-base, an Ir-Ru-Y-base, an Ir-Mo-Y-base, an Ir-W-Y-base, an Ir-Nb-Y-base, an Ir-Ta-Y-base, and an Ir-Rh-Y-base are known. In this case, when the portion brought into contact with the objects to be worked is formed by a ternary alloy containing iridium, containing rhenium, and containing zirconium, hafnium, lanthanum, cerium, samarium, gadolinium, scandium, or yttrium, a content of rhenium is preferably set to 1.0 to 50.0 atomic percentages, and more preferably set to 10.0 to 25.0 atomic percentages. Acontent of zirconium, hafnium, lanthanum, cerium, samarium, gadolinium, scandium, or yttrium is preferably set to 0.1 to 5.0 atomic percentages, and more preferably set to 1.0 to 3.0 atomic percentages.

29<br><br>
welded by using the friction stir welding tool according to the embodiment.<br>
Welding is preferably performed while applying an iridium back plate, a back plate (reference numeral 6 in FIG. 1) containing iridium and containing rhenium, ruthenium, molybdenum, tungsten, niobium, tantalum, rhodium, zirconium, hafnium, or two or more of them as sub-components, or a back plate coated with an iridium film or a film having the composition to a rear surface side of a pressing surface of the friction stir welding tool. Since the rear surface side of the pressing surface of the friction stir welding tool is also heated to a high temperature, when a back plate of a stainless steel or the like is applied, the back plate and the object to be worked may be welded. When not only the friction stir welding tool but also the back plate contain iridium or have the composition containing iridium and containing rhenium or the like as a sub-component, the tool is not welded on to object to be worked, mixing of an impurity in a welded portion can be reduced. The iridium film or the film having the composition may be applied as a back plate.  In this case, a base material coated with a film is preferably formed by the material having the composition. However, the embodiment includes the case in which the base material is not formed by the material having the composition. The thickness of the film is set to, for example, 10 to 500 µm, andpreferablysetto 50to l00 µm. The compositionof the friction stir welding tool and the composition of the back plate or the<br>
30<br><br>
film coated thereon are preferably the same compositions. However, as long as the condition in which the iridium back plate is used, the condition in which the back plate having.the composition containingiridiumandcontainingrhenium,ruthenium, molybdenum, tungsten, niobium, tantalum, rhodium, zirconium, hafnium, or two or more of themas sub-components, or the condition in which the back plate is coated with a film having the component are satisfied, different combinations may be combined to each other.<br>
When the friction stir welding method according to the embodiment is performed, even though objects to be worked having a high melting point, a workpiece having a friction stir welding portion in which a small amount of impurity is mixed can be obtained. Examples<br>
Alloys having compositions shown in Table 1 were formed as Example 1 to Example 4 and Comparative. Examples 1 to 3, on the basis of a Micro Vickers Hardness test {JIS-Z2244) (HV-112, Akashi, Japan) , Micro Vickers Hardnesses based on heat treatment temperatures in Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Examples<br>

Amassdecrease inhigh-temperature volatilization at 1600°C in the atmosphere was measured. Masses of a sample before and after heat treatment were measured, and<br>
31<br><br>
a difference between the masses was calculated and set as a mass decrease. At this time, a surfacearea of the sample was calculated, the mass decrease is divided by the surface area, and a mass decrease per unit area was calculated. Measurement results are shown in FIG. 3 (high-temperature volatilization test) . FIG. 3 is a graph showing a relationship between a heat treatment time and a mass decrease per unit area.<br>

In terms of hardness and abrasion resistance, a Vickers Hardness of 300 Hv or more was required. From FIG, 2, in Examples 1 to 3, even though samples subjected to heat treatment at 1350°C or more were measured at a room temperature, a Vickers Hardness of 300 Hv or more could be maintained. However, in Comparative Examples 1 and 2, when samples subjected to heat treatment at about 1300°C were measured at the room temperature, the Vickers Hardnesses were lower than 300 Hv. In order to obtain the hardnesses, it was confirmed that other elements such as zirconium, rhodium, and hafnium and appropriate contents were necessary.<br>
32<br><br>
From FIG. 3, in Examples 2 and 3, mass decreases of the alloys containing rhodium in heat treatment time were smaller than those in Comparative Examples 1 to 3. An effect of maintaining a hardness of 300 Hv or more to volatilization attrition by containing rhodium was confirmed.<br>
Amounts of wear in Example 1 and Comparative Example 3 were measured. As objects to be worked, plates of oxide-dispersion-strengthenedplatinumalloy (containing 82 .13 atomic percentages of platinum, 0.23 atomic percentages of zirconium oxide, and 17 . 64 atomic percentages of rhodium, having a thickness of 1. 5 mm, and available from Furuya Metal Co., Ltd.) were applied to each other to form a boundary area, and the friction stir welding tools of Example 1 and Comparative Example 3 were pressed on the boundary area to attempt welding by a friction stir welding method. The melting point of the zirconium-oxide-dispersion-strengthened platinum alloy is about 1860°C. Measurement results are shown in FIG. 4 {examination of amount of wear). FIG. 4 is a graph showing a relationship between a rotating distance of the circumference of the tool and a mass decrease per unit area. The rotating distance of the tool circumferencewascalculatedbycircumference of the shoulder portion 5 x rotating speed x welding time (welding distance/feed speed) . At this time, a mass decrease of the tool circumference was calculated by mass before welding - mass after welding. From FIG. 4, in Example 1 formed by a ternary alloy, a mass decrease in a rotating distance was  smaller than that<br>
33<br><br>
in Comparative Example 3 formed by a binary alloy. An effect of maintaining resistance to abrasion by forming a sample by a ternary or more alloy was confirmed.<br>
Friction stir welding tests using the friction stir welding tools formed with the compositions in Example 1 and Comparative Example 1 were attempted. More specifically, plates of a stainless steel (SUS-304) were applied to each other as objects to be worked to form a boundary region, and the friction stir welding tools formed with the compositions in Example 1 and Comparative Example 1 were pressed on the boundary region to attempt welding by a friction stir welding method. The melting point of the SUS-304 is about 1400 to 1450°C. The welding could be performed by using the friction stir welding tools formed with the compositions in Example 1 and Comparative Example 1. In any example using the friction stir welding tools formed with the compositions in Example 1 and Comparative Example 1, cracks of the friction stir welding tools were not found.<br>
Friction stir welding tests using the friction stir welding tools formed with the compositions in Example 1 and Comparative Example 3 were attempted. As objects to be worked, plates of oxide-dispersion-strengthened platinum alloy (containing 82-13 atomic percentages of platinum, 0.23 atomic percentages of zirconium oxide, and 17.64 atomic percentages of rhodium, having a thickness of 1.5 mm, and available from Furuya Metal Co., Ltd.) were applied to each other to form a boundary area, and the friction stir welding tools of Example<br>
34<br><br>
1 and Comparative Example 3 were pressed on the boundary area to attempt weldingby a friction stir weldingmethod. Themelting point of the zirconium-oxide-dispersion-strengthened platinum alloy is about 1860°C. The welding could be performed'by using the friction stir welding tools formed with the compositions in Example 1 and Comparative Example 3. In any example using the friction stir welding tools formed with the compositions in Example 1 and Comparative Example 3, cracks of the friction stir welding tools were not found.<br>
A welding distance of SUS-304 was set to 100 cm, welding was performed once, and amounts of wear of the friction stir welding tools were evaluated- A rotating speed and a feed rate were set to be constant - As the amounts of wear, differences of the masses of the friction stir welding tools before and after the welding were measured. The amount of wear of the friction stir welding tool of Example 1 was 0.3 (g) , and the amount of wear of the friction stir welding tool in Comparative Example 1 was about 1.5 (g) . Therefore, the friction stir welding tool of Example Icouldfriction-stir-weldhigh-melting-point objects to be worked, and abrasion of the tool was small. On the other hand, the friction stir welding tool of Comparative Example 1 could f riction-stir-weldhigh-melting-point objects to be worked. However, an amount of wear of the tool was large, and the tool could be rapidly deteriorated.<br>
A welding distance of oxide-dispersion-strengthened platinum alloy (containing<br>
35<br><br>
82.13 atomic percentages of platinum, 0.23 atomic percentages of zirconium oxide, and 17.64 atomic percentages of rhodium, having a thickness of 1.5 mm, and available from Furuya Metal Co., Ltd.) was set to 100 cm, welding was performed once, and an amount of wear of a friction stir welding tool was evaluated. A rotating speed and a feed rate were set to be constant. As the amounts of wear, differences of the masses of the friction stir welding tools before and after the welding were measured. The amount of wear of the friction stir welding tool of Example 1 was 0.60 (g) , and the amount of wear of the friction stir welding tool in Comparative Example 3 was about 1.14 (g) . Therefore, the friction stir welding tool of Example 1 could friction-stir-weldhigh-melting-point objects to be worked, and abrasion of the tool was small. On the other hand, the friction stir welding tool of Comparative Example 3 could friction-stir-weld high-melting-point objects to be worked. However, an amount of wear of the tool was large, and the tool could be rapidly deteriorated.<br>
Objects to be worked were friction-stir-welded by the friction stir welding tool having the component of Example 1 on a back plate having a composition of 89.0 Ir - 10.0 Re -1.0 Zr (numerical values are atomic percentages) of Example 1. At this time, the back plate was not welded on the objected to be worked. In a plate thickness direction of the welded portion, the pressing surface of the friction stir welding tool and the rear surface of the back plate side were EPMA-analyzed by using<br>
36<br><br>
an electron micro-analyzer {available from JEOL Ltd,). As a result, itwasnot recognized that iridium, rhenium, andzirconium were mixed into the welded portion as impurities . Furthermore, it was found that welding and mixing of impurities in the welded portion could be prevented when a friction stir welding tool having the composition of Example 2 and a back plate having the component of Example 2 were used, when a friction stir welding tool having a component of Example 3 and a back plate having the composition of Example 3 were used, and when a friction stir welding tool having a composition of Example 4 and a back plate having the composition of Example 4 were used.<br>
On the other hand, welding was performed by using the friction stir welding tool having the composition of Example 1 and a back plate of SUS-304. At this time, welding of the back plates occurred on the object to be worked. Similarly, EPMA analysis was performed. As a result, it was recognized that iron was diffused in the welded portion as impurities to weld the back plate. An iron content on the rear surface of the object to be worked on the back plate side was 3% at most, and an iron content on the surface of the object to be worked on the pressing side of the friction stir welding tool was 300 ppmat most. Therefore, it was considered that SUS-304 was stirred and mixed to the surface side (pressing surface side) of the object to be worked in the step of frictional stirring.<br>
A relationship between a composition and a hardness of an Ir-Re-Zr-based alloy was examined. Alloys having<br>
37<br><br>
