HIGH CONCENTRATION TOPICAL INSECTICIDES CONTAINING PYRETHROIDS CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[001 ]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/795,677, filed April 28,2006 and is a continuation-in-part of and claims priority to U.S. Application No. 11/181,344, filed July 14, 2005, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application No. 10/910,542, filed August 3, 2004, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/493,976, filed August 8, 2003, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/554,563, filed March 19, 2004, and is also a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application No. 10/242,551, filed September 12, 2002, now U.S. Patent 6,867,223. Priority is claimed to the applications listed above, which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
[002]	The invention relates generally to insecticides and more particularly to a topical<br>
insecticide, such as one suitable to use on house pets such as dogs.<br>
[003]	The infestation of animals with fleas, ticks, flies and the like is highly undesirable.<br>
Accordingly, it has become common to administer both topical and internal insecticides to livestock and pets. Topical applications can be desirable, in that many insecticides are acceptably safe when used topically, but not when used internally. Also, many pet owners are concerned about administering internal insecticides to their pets.<br>
[004]	Various topical insecticides have drawbacks. Some require a large volume to be<br>
applied to the animal. This can cause considerable mess and can lead to an unpleasant smell. Additionally, if the dosage of a topical insecticide is in a large volume, it can be easily shaken off by the animal, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the insecticide formulation. Also, when the animal is a house pet, there is a further complication in that the insecticide should be safe for<br><br>
human contact. It should also not lead to staining of furniture, carpeting and the like. Finally, even if safe, topical insecticides for house pets should not be irritating or lead to rashes, hair loss or exhibit other unpleasant side effects.<br>
[005]	There is therefore a need for an improved topical insecticide that overcomes<br>
drawbacks of the prior art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION &gt;<br>
[006]	Generally speaking, in accordance with the invention, a topical insecticide,<br>
particularly one for use on pets, especially dogs, is provided. Formulations in accordance with the invention can be safe to use and can avoid many common deleterious side effects of conventional topical insecticides.<br>
[007]	The invention provides a topical insecticide which contains a combination of<br>
insecticides and insect growth regulators which can be effective to kill fleas, flea eggs, flea<br>
larvae, ticks, tick eggs, tick larvae and tick nymphs. The selection of the combination of<br>
insecticides and insect growth regulators produces an insecticide having high insecticidal activity<br>
while allowing for a lower total amount of insecticide to be applied to the animal, compared to<br>
the effectiveness and amount required of the individual insecticides when used alone to achieve<br>
the same kill rate. The compositions derived herein can also be useful to improve the speed of<br>
result and decrease the reoccurrence, compared to other formulatiom.<br>
[008]	The invention can provide an insecticidal composition which contains a<br>
combination of a first insecticide component in an insecticidally effective amount to achieve at least, e.g., an 80%, preferably 90% kill rate for fleas, a second insecticide component in an insecticidally effective amount to achieve at least, e.g. an 80%, preferably 90% kill rate for ticks, and a growth regulating effective amount of an insect growth regulator (1GR). In certain embodiments of the invention, the second insecticide is not a neo-nicotinoid, which is considered<br><br>
only effective against fleas. The combination of the two insecticide components and the insect growth regulator increases the effectiveness of the first and second insecticide compared to the effectiveness of the first and second insecticides when used alone and reduces the effective amount of the first and second insecticide compared to the effective amount of the first and second insecticide when used alone.<br>
[009]	In one embodiment of the invention, at least one of the two insecticide<br>
components in the composition is a pyrethroid and in other preferred embodiments, the first and second insecticide components in the composition are pyrethroids. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the first insecticide component in the composition comprises perrnethrin Alternative embodiments of the invention can include cyphenothrin or fenpropathrin. The second insecticide component comprises a (tetrahydro-3-furanyl)methylamine derivative of formula (1), identified below. Of course, it should be understood that the designations of which of the two is the first and which is the second is arbitrary and interchangeable. Also, the identification of an active ingredient, e.g., perrnethrin, is intended to also refer to other pharmaceutically active forms of the active ingredient, such as esters, salts, hydrochlorides, acid or base forms, isomers and so forth.<br>
[0010]	In another embodiment of the invention, the first insscacide component<br>
comprises perrnethrin or phenothrin. The second insecticide componem comprises a chloronicotinyl insecticide, preferably acetamiprid. Other chloronicotinyl insecticides that can be utilized in the insecticide formulation include, but are not limited to nitenpyram and imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and clothianidin.<br>
[0011]	In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the first insecticide component<br>
comprises perrnethrin or phenothrin, and the second insecticide component comprises<br><br>
dinotefuran, acetamiprid, nitenpyram, imidacloprid, or bifenthrin. The second component is<br>
advantageously in combination with an isoparaffinic solvent such as Isopar®, available<br>
commercially from EXXON and/or tripropylene glycol methyl ether (TPM), dipropylene glycol<br>
methyl ether, propylene glycol methyl ether, ethyl lactate, propylene carbonate and/or safflower<br>
oil. It should be noted that in embodiments where the second insecticide is dinotefuran, Isopar<br>
and safflower oil are preferably not included in the solvent solution.<br>
[0012]	It has been determined that it is difficult to form a high concentration of<br>
dinotefuran and permethrin or phenothrin and it is likely to result in a solution that can be unstable when stored at room temperature for reasonable amounts of time. Accordingly, it was determined to be preferable to package the insecticide composition in a manner so that the first insecticide and second insecticide are not permitted to interact prior to application of the insecticide composition to the animal and to keep these formulations separated until application. The first and second insecticides can be stored separately from each other in a package or container having two associated, preferably attached, but individual chambers to prevent the mixing of the insecticides prior to the administration of the formulation.   Prior to administration, the packages containing the two insecticides in their respective separate chambers are opened, and the two insecticides are dispensed simultaneously or at least at about the same time, to the animal.<br>
[0013]	One way of providing the two components is to provide two containers that each<br>
have flat bottoms and bulb shaped reservoirs in the top side. Each bulb can be in fluid communication with a channel portion extending in a first direction from the reservoir. The two containers can be mirror images of each other, issued at a central connection save that they can be folded toward each other at the central connection, so that the two flat bottoms meet, leading<br><br>
to the forming of a familiar dropper bulb shape. The ends of the package, can be broken off to<br>
open the ends of the channels. Therefore, squeezing the bulb end will simultaneously dispense<br>
both bulbs through both channels, onto the pet.<br>
[0014]	In yet another preferred embodiment of the invention, the insect growth regulator<br>
in the composition is pyriproxyfen or methoprene. Preferably, the insect growth regulator is<br>
packaged in the same chamber as either the first insecticide or the second insecticide or in yet<br>
another container. Pyriproxyfen or methoprene are insecticides that act as an insect growth<br>
inhibitor (IGR) by preventing flea eggs from hatching.<br>
[0015]	-  In another preferred embodiment of the invention, triphenyl phosphate (TPP) is<br>
added to the insecticide composition, preferably in an amount less than the insecticidally<br>
effective amount of the first and second insecticide in the composition. Triphenyl phosphate can<br>
be packaged in the same container as either the first insecticide or the second insecticide. The<br>
selection of the chamber depends on the solvent in which the insecticide is solubilized.<br>
[0016]	Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide an improved topical<br>
insecticide composition that is highly effective against fleas, flea larvaej flea eggs, and ticks.<br>
[0017]	Another object of the invention is the provision of methods for controlling insect<br>
infestation.<br>
[0018]	Another object of the invention is to provide a topical insecticide that works more<br>
rapidly and/or more permanently than other insecticides.<br>
[0019]	Other objects and features will be in part apparent and in part pointed out.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES<br>
[0020]	FIG. 1 is a top plan view of a dual packaging system in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the invention;<br>
[0021]	FIGS. 2A and 2B are end views of the dual packaging system of FIG. 1; and<br><br>
[0022]	FIG. 3 is a side view of the system of FIG. I, after the two halves thereof have<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0023]	in accordance with the invention, insecticidal compositions, which contain a<br>
combination of insecticides and insect growth regulators effective to kill fleas and ticks, including flea eggs, flea larvae, and adult fleas and ticks, tick eggs, tick larvae and tick nymphs, are provided. By selecting a combination of insecticides that are highly effective against fleas and combining them with insecticides that are highly effective against ticks, the total amount of insecticide is optimized. The combination of insecticides and insect growth regulators result in insecticidal compositions having high insecticidal activity against fleas and ticks while allowing for a reduced amount of the total volume of insecticide required for application when compared to compositions containing the individual insecticides alone. Compositions containing permethrin in accordance with the invention are particularly advantageous for use on dogs, compared to their use on cats.<br>
[0024]	The insecticidal compositions in accordance with the invention comprise a<br>
combination of a first insecticide component in an insecticidally effective amount to preferably achieve at least an 80% kill rate for fleas, a second insecticide component in an insecticidally effective amouni to preferably achieve ai least an 80% kill rate for ticks, and an insecticidally effective amount ofan insect growth regulator (IGR). The combination of the first and second insecticide components with an insect growth regulator advantageously results in an insecticidal composition having a higher insecticidal activity against fleas, flea larvae, flea eggs and ticks compared to a composition containing either the first or second insecticide or the insect growth regulator alone.<br><br>
[0025]	In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the first insecticide component in the<br>
composition is in an insecticidally effective amount to achieve at least an 80% kill rate for fleas, more preferably at least a 90% kill rate for fleas, even more preferably at leas: a 95% kill rate for fleas, and most preferably, at least a 99% kill rate for fleas. In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the second insecticide component in the composition is in an insecticidally effective amount to achieve at least an 80% kill rate for ticks, more preferably at least a 90% kill rate for ticks, even more preferably, at least a 95% kill rate for ticks, and most preferably, at least a 99% kill rate for ticks.<br>
*<br>
[0026]	In one embodiment of the invention, the first and second insecticide components<br>
in the composition are not the same insecticide and at least one of the two insecticides in the composition is a pyrethrin or a synthetic pyrethroid.

[0056]	It has been determined that the combination of two different insecticides and an<br>
insect growth regulator results in a composition having high insecticidal activity when compared to compositions containing the first or second insecticide alone.

[0063]	It has been determined that it is difficult to form a high concentration of<br>
dinotefuran and permethrin or phenothrin and it is likely 10 result in a solution that can be unstable when stored at tempuraters generally encountered by insecticides between the time they are manufactured and when thev are used for reasonable amounts oftimfi Accordingly, it is preferable that these two insecticides are packaged in a container having two associated, preferably attached, but individual chambers to prevent the mixing of the insecticides prior to the administration of the formulation. Prior to administration, the container can be opened and the two insecticides can be dispensed simultaneously or nearly simultaneously, to the companion animal. In one embodiment of the invention, the package is constructed so that both chambers can be dispensed at once.<br><br>
[0064]	In another embodiment of the invention, one of die active ingredients, for<br>
example, dinotefuran or pennethrin, can be encapsulated or contained in micelles or lipids in the formulation. In this embodiment of the invention, topical formulations can be packaged and stored in a single container prior to administration to the animal.<br>
[0065]	In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the insecticide composition of die<br>
invention is packaged in a single dose package. Single dose containers make storage and disposal more convenient for animal owners. Preferably, the insecticide composition is packaged in a container, encompassing two associated, preferably attached but individual chambers, which are separated by a barrier, preferably plastic, plastic coated paper or metal, such as aluminum foil. In one embodiment of the invention, the first chamber, and the second chamber, are plastic tubes that are separate but fused together. During packaging, the first insecticide, preferably pennethrin or phenothrin, is placed in the first chamber and the second insecticide, preferably dinotefuran or acetamiprid, is placed in the second chamber. Preferably, the first and second chambers are separated by a barrier that prevents the interaction of the first and second insecticides. In another preferred embodiment of the invention, an insect growth regulator, preferably methoprene or pyriproxyfen, is added to the insecticide composition and placed in the same chamber with either the first insecticide or the second insecticide or even separately in yet another container.<br>
[0066]	The entire container containing the two insecticides in separate chambers is<br>
sealed, preferably with a tab or top, for use in opening the container prior to administration. After the container is sealed, the insecticide formulation can be safely stored in the container . until administration of the insecticide formulation to the animal.<br><br>
[0067]	Prior to administration of the insecticide formulation to the animal, the container<br>
is opened by removing the tab or top. In one embodiment of the invention, the container is opened by twisting the tab thereby resulting in breaking or tearing of the barrier separating the two chambers, thereby allowing the two insecticides, preferably permethrin and dinotefuran, to mix prior to administration of the insecticide formulation to the animal. After the two insecticides are mixed, the two insecticides are dispensed simultaneously by squeezing or collapsing the body of the individual containers. In another embodiment of the invention, the two are not combined until they are dispensed onto the animal. A dual plunger system can also be employed to administer the formulation to the animal.<br>
[0068]	A dual component insecticide dispensing system in accordance with a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention is shown generally in FIGS. 1-3 as a dual insecticide container 100. Container 100 is formed with a pair of mirror plates 100a and 100b. A bottom side 120 of container 100 is flat. It can be formed of rigid plastic, a flexible sheet or a combination of both. Atop side 130 contains a pair of reservoir chambers 102 and 104, which contain the insecticide. A pair of channels 142 and ] 44 extend from and are in fluid communication with reservoirs ! 02 and 104 respectively. Channels 142 and 144 are on top side 130. Sides 100a and 100b are joined via a bridge 106, which is formed with a living hinge 112 at the CSHEST thereof. A pair of notched cuts 108 and 110 are formed so that a pair of dispending ends 150a and 150b can be broken offsides 100a and 100b, respectively, to open channels 142 and 144 and permit the fluid within reservoirs 102 and 104 to be dispensed.<br>
[0069]	To use system 100, a left side bottom 120a is pivoted toward a right side bottom<br>
120b, by folding system 100 along living hinge 112, by pressing on a left leg side 103a and a right leg side 130b in the directions of arrows A and B, so that left bottom side 120a meets right<br><br>
bottom side 120b to place system 100 in the condition defined in FIG. 3. Thereafter, ends I50a<br>
and 150b are broken off and reservoirs 102 and 104 are squeezed in the direction of a pair of<br>
arrows Cto simultaneously dispense fluid through channels 142 and 144. Chambers 102 and<br>
104 can be formed with any number of flexible and/or resilient materials.<br>
[0070]	It is of course understood that the two insecticides need not be mixed together<br>
prior to administration of the insecticide formulation to the animal. Accordingly, in another<br>
embodiment of the invention, opening of the dual-chamber container does not result in the<br>
mixing of the two insecticides. After the container is opened, the two insecticides are dispensed<br>
onto the animal by squeezing or collapsing the container or containers, either simultaneously or<br>
sequentially.<br>
[0071]	In one embodiment of the invention, the composition is packaged with<br>
instructions, advising to mix the insecticides. In other embodiments of the invention, the<br>
instructions will direct the user to mix the insecticides upon application. In one embodiment of<br>
the invention, a container is provided with multiple single dose packages therein.<br>
[0072]	Because compositions in accordance with preferred embodiments of the invention<br>
have a high concentration of insecticide, a relatively small application of a spot or line on the<br>
animal can effectively prevent and control flea and tick infestation on the animal for up to four<br>
weeks post-administratiori- Preferably, the insecticide formulation is non-tazi; end does not<br>
irritate the animal's skin. Applications are typically in the range of 0.5 to 10 ml. In certain<br>
embodiments of the invention, the compositions are applied in the range of about 0.05 to 0.5<br>
ml/kg of animal body weight.<br>
[0073]	In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the insecticide composition<br>
comprises permethrin in a concentration range of about 40 to 65%, dinotefuran in a<br><br>
concentration range of about 5 to 15%, and pynproxyfen or methoprene in a concentration range<br>
of about 1 to 3%. In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the insecticide composition<br>
comprises permethrin in a concentration range of about 40 to 65%, dinotefuran in a<br>
concentration range of about 5 to 20%,' and pynproxyfen or methoprene in a concentration range<br>
of about 1 to 3%. All percentages, unless otherwise specified, are on a weight basis.<br>
[0074]	While an effective dosage of the insecticide composition needs to be applied to<br>
the animal for optimum effectiveness against fleas, flea eggs, flea larvae and ticks, the active dosages of the first insecticide and second insecticide depend upon the size of the animal. Compositions containing permethrin are particularly advantageous for use on dogs, compared to their use on cats.<br>
[0075]	Preferably, up to 4 ml of insecticide may be administered to a dog weighing 89-<br>
140 pounds. Such composition will preferably contain at least about 1300 to 2600 mg<br>
permethrin, at least about 300 mg dinotefuran, and at least about 20 mg of pyriproxyfen.<br>

[0077]	Preferably, up- to 2.i mi of insecticide may be administerec is £ dog weighing 23<br>
to 44 pounds. Such composition will preferably contain at least about 455 to 1300 mg<br>
permethrin, at least about 210 mg dinotefuran, and at least about 14 mg of pyriproxyfen.<br>
[0078]	Preferably, up to 1.5 ml of insecticide may be administered to a dog weighing 22<br>
pounds or less. Such composition will preferably contain at least about 175 to 650 mg permethrin, at least about 150 mg dinotefuran, and at least about 10 mg of pyriproxyfen.<br><br>
[0079]	In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the insecticide composition<br>
comprises phenothrin, dinotefuran and pyriproxyfen. Insecticide compositions containing phenothrin in accordance with the invention are particularly advantageous for use on both dogs and cats. Preferably, the insecticide composition comprises phenothrin in a concentration range of between 80 to 87%, more preferably approximately 85.7%, dinotefuran in a concentration range of 5 to 15%, and pyriproxyfen or methoprene in a concentration range of 1 to 2%. In another preferred embodiment of the invention, die insecticide composition comprises phenothrin in a concentration range of about 80 to 87%, more preferably approximately 85.7%, dinotefuran in a concentration range of about 5 to 20%, and pyriproxyfen or methoprene in a concentration range of about 1 to 3%. All percentages, unless other specified, are on a weight basis.<br>
[0080]	The actual amount of the active dosage of the active ingredient will vary<br>
depending on the size of the dog or cat. Effective dosages include the following on a mg active ingredient per kg animal body weight basis. See Table 1.<br><br>
[0081 ]	Another embodiment of the invention provides for a method for controlling insect<br>
infestation in a dog comprising administering about 15 to 130 mg/kg dog body weight of<br><br>
permethrin, 1,5 to 20 mg/kg dog body weight of dinotefuran and 0.15 to 2 mg/kg dog body<br>
weight of pyriproxyfen. In yet another embodiment of the invention the method comprises<br>
administering about 80 to 500 mg/kg dog body weight of phenothrin, 1.5 to 20 mg/kg dog body<br>
weight of dinotefuran and 0.15 to 2 mg/kg dog body weight of pyriproxyfen. In another<br>
embodiment of the invention the method comprises administering about 15 to 130 mg/kg dog<br>
body weight of permethrin, 0.5 to 20 mg/kg dog body weight of acetamiprid and 0.15 to 2 mg/kg<br>
dog body weight of pyriproxyfen. In yet another embodiment of the invention the method<br>
comprises administering about 80 to 500 mg/kg dog body weight of phenothrin, 0.5 to 20 mg/kg<br>
dog body weight of acetamiprid and 0.15 to 2 mg/kg dog body weight of pyriproxyfen.<br>
[0082]	Another embodiment of the invention provides a method for controlling insect<br>
infestation in a cat comprising administering about 100 to 1000 mg/kg cat body weight of<br>
phenothrin, 15 to 180 mg/kg cat body weight of dinotefuran and 2 to 18 mg/kg cat body weight<br>
of pyriproxyfen. In yei another embodiment of the invention the method comprises<br>

weight of acetamiprid and 2 to 18 mg/kg cat body weight of pyriproxyfen.<br>
[0083]	It should be noted that in embodiments where the formulation is packaged using<br>
separate chambers or containers, the percentage of an active ingredient proviied is the<br>
percentage of thai active ingredient in a single solution. For example, 1 to 2% pyriproxyfen is<br>
the concentration of pyriproxyfen contained in the formulation in a single chamber rather than<br>
the concentration of pyriproxyfen in the total formulation of the combined chambers.<br>
[0084]	For use on cats, up to 1.1 ml of total insecticide may preferably be administered to<br>
a cat weighing less than 10 pounds and up to 1.5 ml of insecticide may be administered to a cat weighing 10 pounds or more. Preferably, the volume of phenothrin being administered to a cat is<br><br>
between about 0.25 to 0.85 ml for a cat weighing less than 10 pounds and between about 0.35 and 1.25 ml for a cat weighing 10 pounds or more. A volume of 1.0 ml and 1.3 ml, respectively, for a phenothrin containing product is preferred.<br>
[0085]	Insecticide compositions containing phenothrin are also particularly effective for<br>
use on dogs. Preferably, approximately up to 1.5 ml of total insecticide may be administered to a<br>
dog weighing under 30 pounds, approximately up to 3.0 m! of total insecticide may be<br>
administered to a dog weighing less than 45 pounds, approximately up to 4.1 ml of total<br>
insecticide may be administered to a dog weighing 41-60 pounds, approximately up to 4.6 ml of<br>
total insecticide may be administered to a dog weighing 61-90 pounds, and approximately up to<br>
6.0 ml of total insecticide may be administered to a dog weighing over 90 pounds. Preferably,<br>
the amount of phenothrin in the insecticide composition is between 0.3 to 0.9 ml for a dog<br>
weighing 4 to 15 pounds, between about 0.25 to 0.85 ml for a dog weighing 16 to 30 pounds,<br>
between about 0.65 to 1.95 ml for a dog weighing 31 to 45 pounds, between about 1.0 to 3.0 ml<br>
for a dog weighing 46 to 60 pounds, between about 1.15 to 3.45 ml for a dog weighing 61 to 90<br>
pounds, and between about 1.5 to 4.5 mi for a dog weighing more than 90 pounds.<br>
[0086]	In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the msecticide composition<br>
comprises permethrin, acetamiprid and pyriproxyfen. Preferably, the insecticide composition comprises permsthrin in a concentrariori range of 45 to 65%, acetamiprid in a. ^sicemratioT. range of 5 to 50%, and pyriproxyfen in a concentration range of 0.5 to 5 %. In vex another preferred embodiment of the invention, the insecticide composition comprises permethrin in a concentration range of about 40 to 65%, acetamiprid in a concentration range of about 5 to 50%, and pyriproxyfen in a concentration range of about 0.5 to 5 %.<br><br>
[0087]	In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the insecticide composition<br>
comprises phenothrin, acetamiprid and pyriproxyfen. Preferably, the insecticide composition<br>
comprises phenothrin in a concentration range of 5 to 90%, acetamiprid in a concentration range<br>
of 5 to 50%, and pyriproxyfen in a concentration range of 0.5 to 5%.<br>
[0088]	Preferably, the insecticidal compositions of the present invention further<br>
comprises an enzyme inhibitor or a synergist such as piperonyl butoxide, N-octylbicycloheptenedicarboximide, triphenyl phosphate, which preferably increases the efficacy of the composition. Preferably, me insecticidal compositions also contain one or more compounds to increase the efficacy and to reduce the irritation of pyrethroid insecticides to the skin of animals.<br>
[0089]	In a preferred embodiment, the insecticidal compositions further comprise an<br>
effective amount of triphenyl phosphate (TPP) to increase efficacy, typically less than the<br>
amount of active ingredient. The amount of TPP to include in the composition relative to the<br>
concentration of the first and second insecticide component in the composition can be readily<br>
determined using routine experimentation to determine the optimum synergisiic effect.<br>
[0090]	In the preparation of a formulation for use on animals, there are several<br>
parameters that should be considered. These are:<br>
Concentration high enough to minimize the volume of the topical applied to the animal (one would not want to put 20 ml, e.g., onto a small dog).<br>
Concentration low enough to achieve effective translocation of the topical insecticide over the animal's skin.<br><br>
The formulation should be stable for one month at 130° F, 110° F, 40° F, room temperature and 0° F. This helps ensure that the formulation remains stable under the conditions that it could meet in commerce.<br>
Safe to use on the intended animal - particularly non-irritating to at least the intended animal, since the product is applied to the skin. Also safe if ingested by the animal; ingestion can occur when pets groom themselves.<br>
Safe to use by the consumer.<br>
Efficacious in use - should kill greater than 90% of the fleas and ticks up to 28 days.<br>
Efficacy would be reduced if crystallization occurred in the package.<br>
Needs to be aesthetically pleasing - "no oily drop" on the animal when applied.<br>
Fast drying to reduce the chance of the animal shaking off the liquid thereby reducing efficacy.<br>
Microbiologically stable.<br>
[0091]	Other additives to the jnsecticidal composition include but are not limited to<br>
fragrances, surfactants and spreading agents to increase performance such as polysorbate 20 and<br><br>
polysorbate 80, and isopropyl myristate. Polymers such as agar, gelatin, alginate, and cationic polymers such as cationic agar, cationic cellulose, cationic acrylates, and polyoxymethylene urea may also be added to provide enrobing of the insecticide to improve safety and adhesion to skin<br>
and hair.<br>
Solvent containing N-octyl pyrrolidone and/or N-methyl pyrrolidone<br>
[0092]	In accordance with another preferred embodiment of the invention, the insecticide<br>
composition includes N-octyl pyrrolidone (NOP) and/or N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) in the solvent. Preferably, the first insecticide component comprises permethrin and the second insecticide component comprises dinotefuran. The inventors determined that N-octyl pyrrolidone and N-methyl pyrrolidone, either alone or in combination, can increase the degree of dissolution of the insecticide components, more specifically, permethrin and dinotefuran. The greater amount of dissolution can enhance efficiency of the insecticide composition by requiring less solvent to dissolve the same amount of insecticide compositions. This leads to greater concentrations of insecticide.<br>
[0093]	Preferably, the insecticide composition comprises N-octyl pyrrolidone in a<br>
concentration range of approximately 0- ] 0%, more preferably about 5-7%, most preferably approximately 6V Additionally, the insecticide composition can comprise N-n*ethyl pyrrolidone in a concentration range of approximately 40-60%. Preferably, the insecticide composition comprises permethrin in a concentration range of between approximately 35 to 50%i, more preferably approximately 37%, dinotefuran in a concentration range of approximately 0 to 10%, and pyriproxyfen in a concentration range of approximately 0 to 5%. All percentages, unless other specified, are on a weight'basis.<br>
[0094]	Formulation A:	In one exemplary embodiment of the invention, the<br>
insecticide composition comprises permethrin in a concentration of about 37%, dinotefuran in an<br><br>

insecticide composition comprises permethrin in a concentration of about 47.97%, N-octyl pyrrolidone in a concentration range of approximately 4-6% and ethyl lactate in a concentration range of approximately 48.03-50.03%. All percentages, unless otherwise specified, are on a weight basis.<br>
[0097]	Formulation D:	In one exemplary embodiment of the invention, the<br>
insecticide composition comprises permethrin in a conceniration of about 37.08%. dinotefuran in a concentration of about 5%, pyriproxyfen in a concentration range of about 1-5%, N-octyl pyrrolidone in a concentration range of anproximaieh" 0-6%, preferably aboux 6H. and N-methyl pyrrolidone in a concentration range of approximately 46-57%.
