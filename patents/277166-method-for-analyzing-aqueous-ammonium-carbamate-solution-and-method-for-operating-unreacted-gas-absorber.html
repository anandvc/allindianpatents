METHOD FOR ANALYZING AQUEOUS AMMONIUM CARBAMATE<br>
SOLUTION, AND METHOD FOR OPERATING UNREACTED GAS<br>
ABSORBER<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an analytical method for analyzing the<br>
composition of an aqueous ammonium carbamate solution, which is an<br>
unreacted-gas absorber outlet liquid in a urea production process.<br>
[0002]<br>
The present invention also relates to a method for operating an<br>
unreacted gas absorber in a urea production plant by use of the method for<br>
analyzing an aqueous ammonium carbamate solution.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0003]<br>
In a plant for producing urea, melamine, or the like, since ammonia,<br>
carbon dioxide, water, and the like are used in the plant, an aqueous<br>
ammonium carbamate solution is present as a recycled fluid of an unreacted<br>
material, a by-product, and/or a raw material in many cases. Accordingly,<br>
for operating such a plant, it is desired that the component composition of the<br>
aqueous ammonium carbamate solution be simultaneously measured quickly<br>
without a time lag with a simple apparatus.<br>
[0004]<br>
Hereinafter, the outline of a urea production plant will be described<br>
using Figure 4.<br>
[0005]<br>
As shown in Figure 4, urea is produced through the sections of<br>
synthesis section 31, decomposition section 32, concentration section 33,<br>
and finishing section 34. In the synthesis section 31, ammonia is allowed to<br>
react with carbon dioxide to synthesize urea to provide a urea synthesis<br>
solution. Unreacted ammonia and ammonium carbamate contained in the<br>
synthesis solution are separated as a mixed gas of ammonia, carbon dioxide,<br>
and water in the decomposition section 32. To absorption section 35, is fed<br>
water (condensed water separated in the concentration section 33 may be<br>
used) as an absorbent, and the mixed gas separated in the decomposition<br>
section is absorbed into the absorbent. For this absorption, an absorber<br>
(referred to as an unreacted gas absorber) is used. An outlet liquid from the<br>
absorption section (unreacted-gas absorber outlet liquid) is returned to the<br>
synthesis section 31 as a recovered liquid.<br>
[0006]<br>
In the production plant of urea, it is desired that the loss of ammonia<br>
and carbon dioxide to the outside of the urea production plant be eliminated<br>
by allowing all the mixed gas separated in the decomposition section to be<br>
absorbed into the absorbent and recovering it into the synthesis section as<br>
an absorbent liquid. In order to allow all the mixed gas to be absorbed into<br>
the absorbent, the plant needs to be operated so that operating temperature<br>
is always kept lower than the equilibrium temperature. On the contrary,<br>
when the operating temperature is higher than the equilibrium temperature, it<br>
is impossible to absorb the whole mixed gas. The equilibrium temperature<br>
as described herein refers to a temperature at which the liquid composition at<br>
the time when the mixed gas to be absorbed is absorbed by an absorbent<br>
(water) is exactly in a vapor-liquid equilibrium state at a controlled operating<br>
pressure. The equilibrium temperature is determined by the concentrations<br>
of ammonia, carbon dioxide, and water.<br>
[0007]<br>
For example, if the absorbent (water) is excessively fed to the<br>
absorption section, the equilibrium temperature will increase, which is<br>
advantageous to the absorption of the mixed gas. However, on the other<br>
hand, the excessive water increases the amount of water in the outlet<br>
recovered liquid from the absorption section to thereby increase the amount<br>
of water in the urea reactor (provided in the synthesis section) which receives<br>
the recovered liquid. Therefore, the urea synthesis rate in the urea synthetic<br>
reaction is reduced to increase an unreacted material in the urea synthesis<br>
solution. This results in a vicious cycle whereby the amount of heat required<br>
to remove the unreacted material is increased to increase the steam<br>
consumption in the urea plant, and also the amount of the absorbent (water)<br>
required to recover the separated unreacted gas is further increased.<br>
Therefore, it is important for the operation that the amount of water fed to the<br>
absorber in the absorption section be the requisite minimum. However, if<br>
the amount of water fed to the absorber is carelessly reduced, the equilibrium<br>
temperature of the outlet liquid from the absorption section may be lower<br>
than the operating temperature, thereby lowering absorption performance,<br>
which may cause the loss of ammonia and carbon dioxide. At this time, the<br>
operating temperature may be decreased in order to limit the amount of<br>
water fed to the absorber and improve the absorption performance. But, if<br>
the operating temperature is excessively reduced, the operating temperature<br>
may be lower than the solidification temperature (temperature at which<br>
ammonium carbamate cannot be dissolved in the recovered liquid but is<br>
precipitated as a crystalline salt) to solidify the recovered liquid, resulting in<br>
being impossible to continue operation. The solidification temperature is<br>
also determined by the concentrations of ammonia, carbon dioxide, and<br>
water. That is, it is desirable to always keep the operating temperature in<br>
the absorption section lower than the equilibrium temperature of the<br>
recovered liquid, to make the solidification temperature of the recovered<br>
liquid be higher, and to make the difference between the equilibrium<br>
temperature and the solidification temperature be small.<br>
[0008]<br>
The equilibrium temperature and the solidification temperature of the<br>
recovered liquid are determined by the concentrations of three components<br>
of ammonia, carbon dioxide, and water, and are not determined only by the<br>
ratio of the amount of water to carbon dioxide, or the ratio of the amount of<br>
ammonia to carbon dioxide. In order to specify the equilibrium temperature<br>
and the solidification temperature of the recovered liquid, it is required to<br>
measure the concentrations of three components accurately and<br>
simultaneously without a time lag.<br>
[0009]<br>
By the way, as a urea synthesis process, there is known a solution<br>
circulation process in which a urea synthesis solution from a synthesis<br>
reactor in the synthesis section is directly transferred to the decomposition<br>
section. Further, there is known a stripping process in which the urea<br>
synthesis solution from the synthesis reactor is transferred to a stripper in the<br>
synthesis section, and ammonia and carbon dioxide contained in the urea<br>
synthesis solution are stripped at a synthesis pressure using carbon dioxide<br>
as a stripping agent to be removed to certain concentrations.<br>
[0010]<br>
Particularly in the stripping process, the ammonia concentration and the<br>
carbon dioxide concentration in the outlet liquid from the stripper used vary<br>
with the operating temperature of the stripper, the feed rate of carbon dioxide,<br>
the amount of feed liquid, and the like and influence the composition of the<br>
recovered liquid. That is, since the amounts of ammonia and carbon dioxide<br>
transferred to the unreacted gas absorber easily vary with the stripping<br>
performance of the stripper, it is difficult to control the amount of water fed to<br>
the unreacted gas absorber to the optimum amount in consideration of the<br>
equilibrium temperature and the solidification temperature of the aqueous<br>
ammonium carbamate solution present in the unreacted gas absorber.<br>
Therefore, in order to continue stable operation, the feed rate of water as an<br>
absorbent is generally increased somewhat to excess.<br>
[0011]<br>
Accordingly, if the composition of the recovered liquid is simultaneously<br>
specified without a time lag, it will be possible to accurately find the<br>
equilibrium temperature and the solidification temperature of the recovered<br>
liquid (aqueous ammonium carbamate solution) from the resulting<br>
composition, thereby making it possible to determine an optimum operating<br>
temperature and to perform the operation with controlling the amount of<br>
water in the recovered liquid to a requisite minimum amount, in consideration<br>
of both the equilibrium temperature and the solidification temperature.<br>
[0012]<br>
Various techniques have been proposed in order to analyze the<br>
physical properties of the unreacted-gas absorber outlet liquid.<br>
[0013]<br>
Patent Literature 1 (JP6-184085A) discloses a method of measuring<br>
the electric conductivity of an unreacted-gas absorber outlet liquid to specify<br>
carbon dioxide concentration (ammonium carbamate concentration).<br>
However, this method cannot specify the concentrations of ammonia and<br>
water in a recovered liquid, and therefore cannot exactly determine an<br>
optimal point of operation.<br>
[0014]<br>
Patent Literature 2 (JP59-133451A) discloses a method of specifying<br>
the concentrations of ammonia and carbon dioxide by determining density<br>
and a saturation temperature by means of an oscillation-type density meter<br>
and a photometer (measurement of crystal precipitation temperature).<br>
However, in this method, a photometer is used to measure a crystal<br>
precipitation temperature, and it is necessary to adjust the temperature of an<br>
unreacted-gas absorber outlet liquid to thereby cool the solution, in order to<br>
actually precipitate crystals from a sample of the unreacted-gas absorber<br>
outlet liquid. Such a procedure causes a time lag, and therefore this method<br>
is unsuitable for operation control.<br>
[0015]<br>
Patent Literature 3(US 3270050A) proposes a method of keeping the<br>
concentration of an unreacted-gas absorber outlet liquid at a constant level<br>
by changing the amount of water fed as an absorbent using a viscometer, in<br>
a solution circulation process which is one of urea synthesis processes.<br>
However, this method only monitors the variation of concentration by use of<br>
viscosity and is not a method of specifying the composition of the unreacted-<br>
gas absorber outlet liquid. Further, the inventor of Patent Literature 3<br>
himself admits in Patent Literature 4 (JP47-10226A) that viscosity is<br>
unsuitable for controlling the amount of water fed as an absorbent because<br>
there is influence of free ammonia in the method according to Patent<br>
Literature 3, and proposes in Patent Literature 4 a method in which a<br>
refractometer is used instead. Thus, it is clear that the composition of the<br>
three components cannot be specified by the method described in Patent<br>
Literature 3. Also from this point, it can be said that the method described in<br>
Patent Literature 3 cannot specify the concentrations. Furthermore, also in<br>
the method described in Patent Literature 4, only the concentration of<br>
ammonium carbamate is measured by a measurement with a refractometer,<br>
and similarly to Patent Literature 3, the whole composition of the unreacted-<br>
gas absorber outlet liquid cannot be specified.<br>
[0016]<br>
Further, although a measuring object is different from the unreacted-<br>
gas absorber outlet liquid, Patent Literature 5 (JP58-90544A) discloses a<br>
method of specifying ammonium concentration by titration, carbon dioxide<br>
concentration by electric conductivity, and urea concentration by a<br>
colorimetric method with respect to the composition of a synthesis solution in<br>
a synthesis reactor. However, they are not different from the conventional<br>
manual analysis and require time for obtaining measurement results.<br>
Therefore, the method is unsuitable for operation control. The purpose of<br>
this method is adjustment of the amount of raw-material ammonia and<br>
carbon dioxide to be fed to the synthesis reactor, and cannot be used for<br>
optimization of the absorption section.<br>
[0017]<br>
Patent Literature 6 (JP10-182586A) and Patent Literature 7 (JP2006-<br>
335653A) disclose a method in which the N/C ratio (ammonia/carbon dioxide<br>
ratio) of an outlet liquid from a synthesis reactor or an outlet liquid from a<br>
carbamate condenser is measured by density in a synthetic system of a<br>
stripping process. The methods described in these literatures specify the<br>
ratio of ammonia to carbon dioxide, the ammonia being total ammonia<br>
including urea, carbamic acid, and unreacted ammonia in a synthesis<br>
solution, and the composition of a synthesis solution cannot be specified.<br>
Further, the purpose of these methods is adjustment of the amounts of raw-<br>
material ammonia and carbon dioxide to be fed to the synthesis reactor, and<br>
these methods cannot be used for optimization of the absorption section.<br>

Summary of Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0019]<br>
Thus, in the conventional art, the concentrations of ammonia, carbon<br>
dioxide, and water in an aqueous ammonium carbamate solution, which is an<br>
unreacted-gas absorber outlet liquid, cannot be specified, or analysis such as<br>
crystallization or titration is required to specify these concentrations, and<br>
there has not been known any method suitable for plant control in which the<br>
composition of the aqueous ammonium carbamate solution can be specified<br>
in real time.<br>
[0020]<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method for analyzing<br>
an aqueous ammonium carbamate solution whereby the composition of an<br>
unreacted-gas absorber outlet liquid can be specified in real time, and a<br>
method for operating an unreacted gas absorber by use of the same.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
[0021]<br>
The inventors have achieved the present invention as a result of<br>
extensive studies focusing on the fact that a typical composition of the<br>
aqueous ammonium carbamate solution which is the outlet liquid of the<br>
absorber in a urea production process includes 20 to 40 mass% of an<br>
ammonia component, 20 to 42 mass% of a carbon dioxide component, and a<br>
very small amount (0 to 2 mass%) of urea, with the balance being water; the<br>
viscosity of the aqueous solution is sensitive to the carbon dioxide<br>
component concentration in the aqueous solution and insensitive to the<br>
ammonia component concentration; the density of the aqueous solution is<br>
sensitive to the ammonia component concentration; and an oscillation-type<br>
measuring sensor can continuously measure the viscosity, density, and<br>
temperature of the aqueous solution in the state as it is (without cooling or<br>
dilution) simultaneously without a time lag. Further, the concentration of<br>
urea contained in the absorber outlet liquid is low enough, and the influence<br>
thereof on the viscosity and density is small and negligible.<br>
[0022]<br>
Here, the "ammonia component" refers to the sum of equivalent<br>
ammonia of ammonium carbamate and free ammonia. Since one molecule<br>
of ammonium carbamate (NH2COONH4) contains two molecules of ammonia,<br>
the amount of the equivalent ammonia calculated from ammonium<br>
carbamate is 0.44 when the amount of ammonium carbamate is 1, on the<br>
mass basis. Consequently, when a liquid contains C1 mass% of ammonium<br>
carbamate and C2 mass% of free ammonia, the ammonia component<br>
concentration will be (0.44 x C1 + C2) mass%.<br>
[0023]<br>
Further, the "carbon dioxide component" means equivalent carbon<br>
dioxide of ammonium carbamate. Therefore, when a liquid contains C3<br>
mass% of ammonium carbamate, the carbon dioxide component<br>
concentration will be (0.56 x C3) mass%.<br>
[0024]<br>
The present invention provides the following methods.<br>

and the solidification temperature of the solution and to control operating<br>
temperature to be optimized and the amount of water introduced into the<br>
unreacted gas absorber to a necessary minimum.<br>
[0036]<br>
As a result of such control, it is also possible to control the total amount<br>
of water fed to a urea synthesis reactor and the stripping performance of a<br>
stripper in a stripping process, thus reducing the energy consumption of a<br>
urea plant.<br>
[0037]<br>
The composition of the aqueous ammonium carbamate solution is<br>
specified based on the following method. The concentration of the carbon<br>
dioxide component contained in a solution containing ammonium carbamate,<br>
ammonia, and water as main components can be known from a correlation<br>
among viscosity, temperature, and carbon dioxide component concentration<br>
of the solution. Then, the ammonia component concentration can be specified from the<br>
carbon dioxide component concentration which has been known in this way,<br>
and a correlation among density, temperature, ammonia component<br>
concentration, and carbon dioxide component concentration. Here, the urea<br>
concentration can be ignored because it is low enough as mentioned above.<br>
Accordingly, the amount of water in the aqueous ammonium carbamate<br>
solution, which is the outlet liquid of the absorber, is calculated by subtracting<br>
the ammonia component concentration and the carbon dioxide component<br>
concentration from the whole.<br>
[0038]<br>
[Analysis object]<br>
As described above with respect to Figure 4, the urea production<br>
process includes:<br>
synthesis section 31 of allowing ammonia to react with carbon dioxide to<br>
synthesize urea to obtain a urea synthesis solution;<br>
decomposition section 32 of separating unreacted ammonia and ammonium<br>
carbamate contained in the synthesis solution as a mixed gas of ammonia,<br>
carbon dioxide, and water; and<br>
absorption section 35 of feeding water to an unreacted gas absorber as an<br>
absorbent, allowing the mixed gas separated in the decomposition section to<br>
be absorbed into the absorbent, and returning an unreacted-gas absorber<br>
outlet liquid to the synthesis section 31 as a recovered liquid.<br>
[0039]<br>
Generally, the urea production process further includes:<br>
concentration section 33 of removing water from the remaining liquid phase<br>
(aqueous urea solution) from which the mixed gas is separated in the<br>
decomposition section to form molten urea; and<br>
finishing section 34 of cooling and solidifying the molten urea to obtain, for<br>
example, a granular product urea.<br>
[0040]<br>
Condensed water separated in the concentration section 33 can be<br>
used as the absorbent. Further, when the absorption is performed in two<br>
stages, the unreacted-gas absorber outlet liquid in the first stage can be used<br>
as the absorbent in the unreacted gas absorber in the second stage.<br>
[0041]<br>
In the present invention, the aqueous ammonium carbamate solution<br>
which is the unreacted-gas absorber outlet liquid in such a urea production<br>
process is the analysis object. The typical composition of the unreacted-gas<br>
absorber outlet liquid in the urea production process under normal operation<br>
is in the range of 20 to 40 mass% of the ammonia component (including<br>
ammonia excessively fed to the synthesis section and equivalent ammonia in<br>
ammonium carbamate), 20 to 42 mass% of the carbon dioxide component<br>
(equivalent carbon dioxide in ammonium carbamate), and very small amount<br>
(0 to 2 mass%) of urea, with the balance being water.<br>
[0042]<br>
According to the present invention, it is possible to specify the ammonia<br>
component concentration, the carbon dioxide component concentration, and<br>
the water concentration of the aqueous ammonium carbamate solution in<br>
which the ammonia component concentration is 20 to 40 mass%; the carbon<br>
dioxide component concentration is 20 to 42 mass%; and the urea<br>
concentration is 0 to 2 mass%, with the balance being water. Since the<br>
urea concentration is low enough, the influence on the viscosity and density<br>
and the influence on the equilibrium temperature and the solidification<br>
temperature provided by the variation of the urea concentration are small<br>
enough and can be ignored. Further, with respect to temperature, the<br>
analysis can be performed within a conventional operation range of from 30<br>
to 120°C.<br>
[0043]<br>
The present invention is effective particularly in a urea production<br>
process called a stripping process. In the synthesis section in the stripping<br>
process, the urea synthesis solution from a synthesis reactor (carbon dioxide<br>
and ammonia are reacted to synthesize urea) is transferred to a stripper in<br>
the synthesis section. In the stripper, the ammonia and carbon dioxide<br>
contained in the urea synthesis solution are removed by stripping using<br>
carbon dioxide as a stripping agent at a synthesis pressure.<br>
[0044]<br>
[Method for analyzing composition]<br>
In the method for analyzing the composition of the unreacted-gas<br>
absorber outlet liquid of the present invention, the composition of the<br>
aqueous ammonium carbamate solution which is the unreacted-gas absorber<br>
outlet liquid in the urea production process, that is, the ammonia component<br>
concentration, carbon dioxide component concentration, and water<br>
concentration are determined using the first correlation and the second<br>
correlation.<br>
First correlation: the correlation among the viscosity, the temperature, and<br>
the carbon dioxide component concentration of the aqueous ammonium<br>
carbamate solution.<br>
Second correlation: the correlation among the density, the temperature, the<br>
ammonia component concentration, and the carbon dioxide component<br>
concentration of the aqueous ammonium carbamate solution.<br>
[0045]<br>
In particular, the following steps a to d may be performed.<br>
(a) The viscosity, density, and temperature of the unreacted-gas absorber<br>
outlet liquid are simultaneously measured without a time lag behind the<br>
process.<br>
(b) The carbon dioxide component concentration of the unreacted-gas<br>
absorber outlet liquid is determined using the first correlation, from the<br>
viscosity measurement value and temperature measurement value obtained<br>
in the step a.<br>
(c) The ammonia component concentration is determined using the second<br>
correlation, from the density and temperature obtained in the step a and the<br>
carbon dioxide component concentration determined in the step b.<br>
(d) The water concentration is determined from the carbon dioxide<br>
component concentration determined in the step b and the ammonia<br>
component concentration determined in the step c.<br>
[0046]<br>
Figure 1 is a graph showing the correlation (first correlation) between<br>
the viscosity (mPas), temperature, and carbon dioxide component<br>
concentration (mass %) of the aqueous ammonium carbamate solution.<br>
The viscosity of the aqueous ammonium carbamate solution is sensitive to<br>
the carbon dioxide component concentration, and the influence from the<br>
ammonia component concentration can be ignored. Therefore, if viscosity<br>
and temperature are known, the carbon dioxide component concentration<br>
can be determined with high accuracy from the first correlation.<br>
[0047]<br>
The correlation (second correlation) among the density (kg/m3),<br>
temperature (°C), ammonia component concentration (mass %), and carbon<br>
dioxide component concentration (mass %) of the aqueous ammonium<br>
carbamate solution will be described. Figure 2 (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) are<br>
graphs showing the correlation among the density, temperature, and<br>
ammonia component concentration, at carbon dioxide component<br>
concentrations of 20, 25, 35, 40, and 42 mass%, respectively. The density<br>
of the aqueous solution is sensitive to the ammonia component concentration<br>
and the carbon dioxide component concentration, and the influence from the<br>
water concentration can be ignored. Therefore, if viscosity and temperature<br>
are known and the carbon dioxide component concentration is determined as<br>
mentioned above, the ammonia component concentration can be determined<br>
from the second correlation.<br>
[0048]<br>
Note that Figure 1 shows the lines at temperatures of discrete values<br>
(40, 60, 80, 100, and 120°C). When the temperature is an intermediate<br>
value (for example, 50°C) which is not shown directly, the carbon dioxide<br>
component concentration can be determined using interpolation or<br>
extrapolation. Further, also in the case where Figure 2 is used, interpolation<br>
or extrapolation can be used if the temperature and carbon dioxide<br>
component concentration are values which are not shown directly.<br>
[0049]<br>
Further, since the concentration range of each component (ammonia<br>
component: 20 to 40 mass%, carbon dioxide component: 20 to 42 mass%,<br>
and urea concentration 0 to 2 mass%) and the applicable temperature range<br>
(30 to 120°C) include the operating conditions in conventional urea plants,<br>
the correlations shown in Figures 1 and 2 can be used in any urea plant.<br>
[0050]<br>
In the present invention, the equipment required for measuring the<br>
composition of the aqueous ammonium carbamate solution which is the<br>
unreacted-gas absorber outlet liquid is only a viscometer, a density meter,<br>
and a thermometer. The viscometer, density meter, and thermometer which<br>
can measure viscosity, density, and temperature in real time, respectively,<br>
are commercially available, and these instruments can be used to<br>
simultaneously measure viscosity, density, and temperature.<br>
[0051]<br>
Further, it is preferred from the viewpoint of simplicity of analyzers to<br>
use an oscillation-type instrument in which measuring devices of a<br>
viscometer, a density meter, and a thermometer are integrated. Viscosity,<br>
density, and temperature can be simultaneously measured in real time by<br>
means of such an oscillation-type instrument. The oscillation-type<br>
instrument is commercially available, and easily available. Each of the<br>
viscometer, density meter, and thermometer or the oscillation-type instrument<br>
can perform measurement only by being installed to the inside of the<br>
unreacted gas absorber or to the inside of a pipe (particularly, an unreacted-<br>
gas absorber outlet pipe), and does not require treatment such as dilution of<br>
a sample liquid and cooling to precipitate a crystal. Therefore, it is possible<br>
to measure the composition of the absorber outlet liquid in real time.<br>
[0052]<br>
[Operating method of the unreacted gas absorber]<br>
Examples of the method for controlling an actual plant in the present<br>
invention, particularly the method for operating an unreacted gas absorber,<br>
include the following three methods, and any of these methods may be used.<br>
[0053]<br>
A first method is a method in which the measured values of viscosity,<br>
density, and temperature are just continuously displayed in a central control<br>
room, similarly to other instruments; an operator finds the composition of the<br>
unreacted-gas absorber outlet liquid from the correlation diagram of<br>
equilibrium temperature and solidification temperature, and the like, based on<br>
the composition of the unreacted-gas absorber outlet liquid; and, the operator<br>
optimizes the water feed rate to an unreacted gas absorber and operating<br>
conditions of the unreacted gas absorber as required. In this case, the<br>
effect of rationalization by elimination of periodical analysis of the unreacted-<br>
gas absorber outlet liquid and an improvement in operational unit<br>
requirement owing to suitable adjustment of operating conditions without a<br>
time lag can be expected.<br>
[0054]<br>
A second method is a method in which the composition of the<br>
recovered liquid is displayed in real time on a distributed control system<br>
(hereinafter referred to as DCS) console in a central control room by<br>
mathematizing and programming the correlation among measurement results<br>
of viscosity, density, and temperature and the composition of the recovered<br>
liquid as shown in Example 1 to be described below. Further, since<br>
equilibrium temperature and solidification temperature can be estimated by<br>
simple equations if the composition is found, more useful information for an<br>
operator can be provided in real time if a function of computing the equations<br>
is added. Further, a real-time mass balance around the unreacted gas<br>
absorber can be displayed by incorporating information, from other<br>
instruments, about the water feed rate to the absorber, the flow rate of the<br>
recovered liquid, and the like. It is also possible to regularize a water feed<br>
rate, operating temperature, pressure, and the like which should be set next,<br>
from the current equilibrium vapor pressure, saturation temperature, and<br>
mass balance, and to display them on the DCS console. In this case, the<br>
operator will set the set values of controllers according to instructions<br>
displayed on the DCS console. Thereby, a skilled operator will not be<br>
required for the operation of the absorber in the urea plant.<br>
[0055]<br>
A third method is a case where the second method is fully automated.<br>
That is, it is a method in which the set values of the operating temperature,<br>
pressure, and the water feed rate of the absorber, or the opening of the<br>
control valves for controlling them are automatically set. In this case, the set<br>
values displayed on the DCS console in the second method may be returned<br>
as it is to the required controllers. This can create a system capable of<br>
automatically controlling the unreacted gas recovery system in an optimum<br>
state against various disturbances to the system.<br>
[0056]<br>
Three embodiments of urea plant control have been mentioned above.<br>
All the embodiments can be carried out by only installing a viscometer, a<br>
density meter, and a thermometer, and optionally adding software. The<br>
above description assumes using DCS for the practice of the second and<br>
third methods, but a personal computer which is generally commercially<br>
available is enough to operate the required software part.<br>
[0057]<br>
Next, an example of the absorption section of a urea production<br>
process will be described in detail with reference to Figure 3. This figure is<br>
a flow diagram of an apparatus for performing the recovery of the aqueous<br>
ammonium carbamate solution (absorption section) by two-stage absorption<br>
using a low pressure unreacted gas absorber 1 (in Figure 3, and hereinafter<br>
occasionally referred to as a "low pressure absorber") and a high pressure<br>
unreacted gas absorber 2 (in Figure 3, and hereinafter occasionally referred<br>
to as a "high pressure absorber"). An outlet liquid from the high pressure<br>
unreacted gas absorber is used as a recovered and recycled liquid to the<br>
urea synthesis reactor (not shown) used in the synthesis section.<br>
[0058]<br>
An unreacted gas flow 26 from a low pressure decomposition column<br>
(not shown) used in the decomposition section of the urea production<br>
process is fed to the low pressure unreacted gas absorber 1 which is<br>
operated at 1 to 3 kg/cm2G (0.1 to 0.3 MPaG). Water that is flow-controlled<br>
by a flow controller 8 is fed to the low pressure unreacted gas absorber 1<br>
through a flow control valve 17, is brought into contact with the unreacted gas<br>
flow 26 as an absorbent, and absorbs ammonia and carbon dioxide. The<br>
absorbed ammonia and carbon dioxide are present in the liquid as free<br>
ammonia and ammonium carbamate. Note that G in the pressure unit<br>
means gage pressure.<br>
[0059]<br>
The low pressure absorber 1 has, for example, a structure of a shell<br>
and tube heat exchanger, and the heat of reaction and the heat of absorption<br>
accompanying absorption are removed by cooling water passing through the<br>
tubes. The flow rate of the cooling water is controlled by a temperature<br>
controller 11 and a temperature control valve 19 so that the temperature of<br>
the liquid in the low pressure absorber is kept at a constant value in the<br>
range of about 30°C to 60°C.<br>
[0060]<br>
The pressure of the low pressure unreacted gas absorber 1 is kept<br>
constant by adjusting the gas volume released from a pressure control valve<br>
18 by a pressure controller 9.<br>
[0061]<br>
A low pressure recovered liquid (an outlet liquid from the low pressure<br>
unreacted-gas absorber) that has absorbed unreacted gas is boosted in<br>
pressure by a pump 20 and fed to the high pressure unreacted gas absorber<br>
2 through a flow control valve 21. By adjusting the flow rate of the low<br>
pressure recovered liquid by the flow control valve 21, the liquid level of the<br>
low pressure unreacted gas absorber 1 is controlled by cascade control that<br>
determines a set value of a flow controller 12 from a liquid level controller 10.<br>
[0062]<br>
The viscosity, density, and temperature of the low pressure recovered<br>
liquid are measured by a viscosity/density/temperature meter 28, and these<br>
measured values are transmitted to a control system 7. As the<br>
viscosity/density/temperature meter 28, an oscillation-type instrument<br>
provided with a thermometer is preferably used.<br>
[0063]<br>
On the other hand, an unreacted gas flow 27 from a high pressure<br>
decomposition column (not shown) used in the decomposition section of the<br>
urea production process is transferred to the high pressure unreacted gas<br>
absorber 2 operated at 15 to 20 kg/cm2G (1.5 to 2.0 MPaG). In the high<br>
pressure unreacted gas absorber 2, the recovered liquid which is transferred<br>
from the low pressure unreacted gas absorber and boosted in pressure by<br>
the pump 20 is brought into contact with the unreacted gas flow 27 as an<br>
absorbent and absorbs ammonia and carbon dioxide. The absorbed<br>
ammonia and carbon dioxide are present as free ammonia and ammonium<br>
carbamate in the high pressure recovered liquid (outlet liquid from the high<br>
pressure unreacted gas absorber).<br>
[0064]<br>
The high pressure unreacted gas absorber 2 has, for example, a<br>
structure of a shell and tube heat exchanger, and the heat of reaction and the<br>
heat of absorption accompanying absorption are removed by cooling water<br>
passing through the tubes. The flow rate of the cooling water is controlled<br>
by a temperature controller 15 and a temperature control valve 23 so that the<br>
temperature in the high pressure absorber is kept at a constant value in the<br>
range of 80°C to 120°C.<br>
[0065]<br>
The pressure of the high pressure unreacted gas absorber 2 is kept<br>
constant by adjusting the gas volume released from a pressure control valve<br>
22 by a pressure controller 13.<br>
[0066]<br>
The high pressure recovered liquid that has absorbed unreacted gas is<br>
boosted in pressure by a pump 25 and transferred to the urea synthesis<br>
reactor used in the synthesis section through a flow control valve 24. The<br>
liquid level of the high pressure absorber 2 is controlled by cascade control<br>
that determines a set value of a flow controller 16 through a liquid level<br>
controller 14.<br>
[0067]<br>
The viscosity, density, and temperature of the high pressure recovered<br>
liquid (outlet liquid from the high pressure unreacted gas absorber) obtained<br>
from the high pressure unreacted gas absorber 2 are measured by a<br>
viscosity/density/temperature meter 29 and sent to the control system 7. As<br>
the viscosity/density/temperature meter 29, an oscillation-type instrument<br>
provided with a thermometer is preferably used.<br>
[0068]<br>
The control system 7 receives, for each absorber, the pressure, the<br>
feed rate of water as an absorbent, and the viscosity, density and<br>
temperature of the recovered liquid, among the variables related to the high<br>
pressure unreacted gas absorber 2 and the low pressure unreacted gas<br>
absorber 1, and determines the composition of each recovered liquid.<br>
Further, the control system 7 calculates equilibrium temperature and<br>
solidification temperature from the determined composition and pressure, for<br>
each absorber. At this time, with respect to the composition of the<br>
recovered liquid, the carbon dioxide concentration is specified from the<br>
correlation among the measured viscosity and temperature, and the carbon<br>
dioxide component concentration, and the ammonia component<br>
concentration is specified from the correlation among the density,<br>
temperature, carbon dioxide component concentration, and ammonia<br>
component concentration. Further, for each of the high pressure unreacted<br>
gas absorber 2 and the low pressure unreacted gas absorber 1, the control<br>
system 7 determines, outputs, and feeds back to the controllers a new and<br>
optimum set value for the amount of water as an absorbent, based on the<br>
recovered liquid composition determined in this way, and the equilibrium<br>
temperature and solidification temperature, the temperature, the pressure,<br>
and the feed rate of water as an absorbent.<br>
[0069]<br>
Here, there has been shown an example in which two unreacted gas<br>
flows are fed to a low-pressure and high-pressure unreacted gas absorbers<br>
from the decomposition section and subjected to two-stage absorption in the<br>
low-pressure and high-pressure absorbers in the absorption section, but the<br>
present invention is not limited to this example. Only one unreacted gas<br>
flow may be sent to the absorption section from the decomposition section<br>
and subjected to single-stage absorption in the absorption section. When<br>
the size of the absorber is limited, such as in a case where the production<br>
volume of the plant is large or in a case of revamping, the absorbers may be<br>
installed in parallel in the same stage. The absorbers may be installed in<br>
three stages or more.<br>
Examples<br>
[0070]<br>
[Example 1]<br>
First, there will be described a method for finding the correlation among<br>
the viscosity and temperature of the unreacted-gas absorber outlet liquid and<br>
the carbon dioxide component concentration in the same liquid, and the<br>
correlation among the density and temperature of the unreacted-gas<br>
absorber outlet liquid and the ammonia component concentration and the<br>
carbon dioxide component concentration in the same liquid. An aqueous<br>
solution simulating the unreacted-gas absorber outlet liquid was measured<br>
for the viscosity, density, temperature, ammonia component concentration,<br>
carbon dioxide component concentration, and water concentration by use of<br>
the apparatus shown in Figure 5. The measurement was performed<br>
according to the following procedures. Note that the parts surrounded by<br>
dashed lines in Figure 5 are parts where temperature is controlled by an<br>
electric heater.<br>
- Required amounts of water, ammonium hydrogen carbonate, and ammonia<br>
are introduced into an autoclave 104 in this order, respectively based on the<br>
target composition.<br>
- The inlet and outlet valves of the autoclave are completely closed to<br>
separate the autoclave, which is then heated by an electric heater installed<br>
outside the autoclave. Subsequently, the autoclave contents are stirred until<br>
the temperature inside the autoclave reaches a steady state at a target<br>
temperature. At this time, ammonia and carbon dioxide are vaporized with<br>
the increase in temperature, and the pressure in the autoclave spontaneously<br>
increases. Further, the amounts of ammonia and carbon dioxide to be<br>
vaporized are minimized to prevent the change in the liquid composition due<br>
to evaporation, by determining the liquid volume so that the liquid height<br>
inside the autoclave will be high enough. The autoclave is provided with a<br>
pressure gauge (PG) and a thermometer (TT).<br>
- Each of the autoclave 104 and a flow-through chamber 105 is pressurized<br>
with nitrogen to prevent the evaporation of ammonia and carbon dioxide at<br>
the time of transferring the liquid.<br>
- A valve 101 is opened to introduce the liquid into the flow-through chamber.<br>
A valve 103 is closed at this time:<br>
- A valve 102 is operated to discharge the gas inside the flow-through<br>
chamber to completely immerse a viscosity/density/temperature meter 106 in<br>
the liquid.<br>
- The viscosity, density, and temperature are measured after the indications<br>
of the viscosity/density/temperature meter 106 are stabilized.<br>
- The intensity of the heater is changed after the measurement, and the liquid<br>
is left as it stands until the temperature reaches a steady state again at<br>
another target temperature.<br>
- The viscosity, density, and temperature are measured after the indications<br>
of the viscosity/density/temperature meter 106 are stabilized. The liquid<br>
composition is not changed, but the temperature increase and the steady<br>
state are repeated, and the viscosity, density, and temperature are measured<br>
at each temperature.<br>
- The valve 101 is closed and the valve 103 is opened to collect the solution<br>
to quantify the concentrations of the ammonia component, carbon dioxide<br>
component, and water by a chemical analysis.<br>
[0071]<br>
An oscillation-type instrument "Emerson-Solartron process density and<br>
viscosity meter" (trade name) was used as the viscosity/density/temperature<br>
meter. The ammonia component concentration is specified by back titration<br>
using sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide. Further the carbon dioxide<br>
component concentration is specified by back titration using hydrochloric acid<br>
and sodium hydroxide.<br>
[0072]<br>
Further, the fluid discharged from the flow-through chamber is<br>
introduced into an exhaust ammonia absorber 107, where ammonia in the<br>
fluid is absorbed.<br>
[0073]<br>
In the method as described above, there were prepared aqueous<br>
solutions in which the ammonia component concentration was 20 to 40<br>
mass%; the carbon dioxide component concentration was 20 to 42 mass%;<br>
and the urea concentration was 0 to 2 mass%, with the balance being water,<br>
which is the typical composition of the absorber outlet liquid in the urea<br>
production process.<br>
[0074]<br>
The correlation (first correlation) between the viscosity, temperature,<br>
and carbon dioxide component concentration which were measured as<br>
described above for each of the prepared aqueous solutions is shown in<br>
Figure 1. In Figure 1, the ordinate represents viscosity (mPa.s), and the<br>
abscissa represents the carbon dioxide component concentration (mass %).<br>
Further, the correlation among the density, temperature, and ammonia<br>
component concentration which were measured as described above for each<br>
aqueous solution is shown in Figure 2 (a) to (e), for every carbon dioxide<br>
component concentration. In Figure 2, the ordinate represents density<br>
(kg/cm3), and the abscissa represents the ammonia component<br>
concentration (mass %).<br>
[0075]<br>
When the unreacted-gas absorber outlet liquid in an actual urea<br>
production plant was sampled and measured, the viscosity was 4.4 mPa-s<br>
and the density was 1150 kg/m3 at a temperature of 100°C.<br>
[0076]<br>
From the correlation in Figure 1, the carbon dioxide component<br>
concentration was determined to be 35.0 mass%. On the other hand, when<br>
the concentration of the carbon dioxide component in the same sample<br>
solution was quantified by a chemical analysis, it was 35.1 mass%, which<br>
was well in agreement with the above determined value.<br>
[0077]<br>
From the correlation shown in Figure 2 (c) and the carbon dioxide<br>
component concentration determined as described above, it was possible to<br>
determine that the ammonia component concentration was 32.0 mass%.<br>
On the other hand, when the concentration of the ammonia component in the<br>
same sample solution was quantified by a chemical analysis, it was 32.2<br>
mass%, which was well in agreement with the above determined value.<br>
[0078]<br>
Further, since the urea concentration in the absorption section is low<br>
enough as described above, the influence of the variation of the urea<br>
concentration on the viscosity and density and the influence on the<br>
equilibrium temperature and solidification temperature are small enough and<br>
can be ignored. The water concentration can be calculated by subtracting<br>
the ammonia component concentration and the carbon dioxide component<br>
concentration from the whole. That is, the water concentration is specified<br>
to be 33.0 (= 100 - 35.0 - 32.0) mass%.<br>
[0079]<br>
[Example 2]<br>
Figure 3 is a diagram in the case where low pressure and high pressure<br>
absorbers are installed in two stages, and shows a process flow in which the<br>
water separated in the concentration section is fed to the low pressure<br>
absorber as an absorbent and an outlet liquid from the low pressure absorber<br>
is used as an absorbent fed to the high pressure absorber. The absorber<br>
may be installed in a single stage or in two stages as described above. In<br>
the present Example, the optimization of the operating conditions of the<br>
absorption section was attempted in the case where only the low pressure<br>
absorber was installed in the urea production plant. Specifically, in the low<br>
pressure absorption section, a facility including a single-stage low pressure<br>
absorber was used, which has a configuration (valve 21 is included, but valve<br>
24 is not included) excluding the configuration around the high pressure<br>
absorber from after the valve 21 to the valve 24 in the configuration shown in<br>
Figure 3. When the low pressure absorber is used in a single stage, water<br>
used as an absorbent is allowed to absorb ammonia and carbon dioxide in<br>
the absorption section, and since the high pressure absorber is not installed,<br>
the recovered liquid from the valve 21 is directly returned to the synthesis<br>
section. The absorbent used here contains a small amount of urea because<br>
water separated in the concentration section is used as the absorbent.<br>
[0080]<br>
The process variables around the low pressure unreacted gas absorber<br>
1 at a certain time were as follows:<br>
operating pressure (instrument reading of the pressure controller 9): 2.4<br>
kg/cm2G (0.24 MPaG),<br>
operating temperature (instrument reading temperature of the<br>
viscosity/density/temperature meter 28): 46°C,<br>
absorbent feed rate (set value of the flow controller 8): 10.3 t/h,<br>
viscosity (instrument reading viscosity of the viscosity/density/temperature<br>
meter 28): 3.9 mPa•s,<br>
density (instrument reading density of the viscosity/density/temperature<br>
meter 28): 1065 kg/m3, and<br>
flow rate of the outlet liquid from the low pressure unreacted gas absorber<br>
(recovered liquid): 38.6 t/h.<br>
[0081]<br>
An oscillation-type instrument "Emerson-Solartron process density and<br>
viscosity meter" (trade name) was used as the viscosity /density/temperature<br>
meter, and the viscosity, density, and temperature of the outlet liquid from the<br>
low pressure unreacted gas absorber are simultaneously measured in real<br>
time. Further, the flow rate of the outlet liquid from the low pressure<br>
unreacted gas absorber is also measured simultaneously with these<br>
measurements by a flow meter (step a or i).<br>
[0082]<br>
The carbon dioxide component concentration was determined from the<br>
correlation (Figure 1) between the carbon dioxide composition in ammonium<br>
carbamate, viscosity, and temperature of the outlet liquid from the low<br>
pressure unreacted gas absorber (step b or ii). Next, the ammonia<br>
component concentration was found from this carbon dioxide component<br>
concentration and the correlation (Figure 2(b)) between the ammonia<br>
component concentration, carbon dioxide component concentration, density,<br>
and temperature (step c or iii). Since the urea concentration in the<br>
absorption section is low enough, the influence of the variation of the urea<br>
concentration on the viscosity and density and on the equilibrium<br>
temperature and solidification temperature are small enough and can be<br>
ignored. The water concentration can be calculated by subtracting the<br>
ammonia component concentration and the carbon dioxide component<br>
concentration from the whole (step d or iv). As a result, the composition of<br>
the recovered liquid was as shown in the following table.<br>
[0083]<br>
In Tables 1 to 4, NH3 means the ammonia component, CO2 means the<br>
carbon dioxide component, and the unit of the component flow rate is t/h.<br>
[0084]<br>
Note that the flow rate of each component (carbon dioxide component<br>
flow rate, ammonia component flow rate, and water flow rate) is found in step<br>
v from the flow rate of the outlet liquid from the low pressure unreacted gas<br>
absorber measured in the step i and the carbon dioxide component<br>
concentration, ammonia component concentration, and water concentration<br>
determined in the steps ii to iv, respectively. The flow rate of each<br>
component is also shown in Table 1.<br>
[0085]<br>
[0086]<br>
The equilibrium temperature and solidification temperature of the<br>
aqueous ammonium carbamate solution having the above composition are<br>
found to be 54°C and 29°C, respectively (here, it is possible to judge whether<br>
it is necessary to adjust the flow rate of water or not, by finding the<br>
equilibrium temperature and solidification temperature). Here, the<br>
equilibrium temperature is determined according to the Gibbs' phase rule,<br>
since the composition and pressure have already been found. The<br>
solidification temperature is similarly determined from the known composition.<br>
[0087]<br>
When focusing attention on the equilibrium temperature, since there is<br>
a difference of 8°C between the operating temperature (46°C) and the<br>
equilibrium temperature (54°C), it is possible to judge that the amount of<br>
water as an absorbent in the outlet liquid from the low pressure unreacted<br>
gas absorber is excessive. On the other hand, when focusing attention on<br>
the solidification temperature, since there is a difference of 17°C between the<br>
operating temperature (46°C) and the solidification temperature (29°C), it is<br>
possible to judge that the amount of water in the outlet liquid from the low<br>
pressure unreacted gas absorber can be reduced.<br>
[0088]<br>
Since it is preferred to reduce water concentration as far as possible<br>
while the differences from the operating temperature are ensured, a<br>
composition and component flow rates were determined as described in the<br>
following table. They were determined by varying (reducing) only the<br>
amount of water without changing the operating pressure so that the<br>
equilibrium temperature will be 51 °C or more (allowance from the operating<br>
temperature is 5°C), and the solidification temperature will be 41 °C or less<br>
(allowance from the operating temperature is 5°C). In this case, the<br>
equilibrium temperature is 51 °C, and the solidification temperature is 34°C.<br>
[0089]<br>
That is, from the component flow rates shown in Table 1, only the water<br>
flow rate of the outlet liquid from the low pressure unreacted gas absorber<br>
was varied to determine the water flow rate Fmin water at which the water<br>
concentration is the minimum in the range represented by Formula 1 and<br>
Formula 2. As a result, it was determined to be 14.50 t/h (step v).<br>
[0090]<br>
(Temperature measured in step i) + (First allowance temperature) =<br>
(Equilibrium temperature) Formula 1<br>
(Solidification temperature) = (Temperature measured in step i) -<br>
(Second allowance temperature) Formula 2<br>
[0091]<br>
The equilibrium temperature in Formula 1 is the equilibrium<br>
temperature of the unreacted-gas absorber outlet liquid corresponding to the<br>
carbon dioxide component concentration, ammonia component concentration,<br>
and water concentration of the unreacted-gas absorber outlet liquid when<br>
only the water flow rate is varied;<br>
the solidification temperature in Formula 2 is the solidification temperature of<br>
the unreacted-gas absorber outlet liquid corresponding to the carbon dioxide<br>
component concentration , ammonia component concentration, and water concentration<br>
of the unreacted-gas absorber outlet liquid when only the water flow rate is<br>
varied; and<br>
each of the first and the second allowance temperature in Formulas 1 and 2<br>
has a predetermined positive value.<br>
[0092]<br>
Note that each of the first and second allowance temperatures is used<br>
for absorbing measurement accuracy of instruments and sudden changes of<br>
operating conditions. These allowance temperatures may be reset while<br>
watching actual operating status, but they may usually be about 5°C. The<br>
same can generally be said with respect to the operation of an unreacted gas<br>
absorber regardless of whether it is a low pressure absorber or a high<br>
pressure absorber.<br>
[0093]<br>
<br>
[0094]<br>
In order to obtain this composition, the flow rate of water in the<br>
recovered liquid should be set to 14.50 t/h. Therefore, a set value of the<br>
flow rate controller 8 to be newly set will be 10.3 - (16.06 -14.50) = 8.74 t/h.<br>
That is, the flow rate of water fed to the low pressure unreacted gas absorber,<br>
which is the minimum in the range in which the flow rate of water in the outlet<br>
liquid from the low pressure unreacted gas absorber is the above-described<br>
Fmin.water (14.50 t/h) more, js 8.74 t/h. Therefore, the flow rate of water fed<br>
to the low pressure unreacted gas absorber is controlled to this value (step<br>
vi).<br>
[0095]<br>
The smaller the amount of water in the system is, the more the<br>
synthetic reaction of urea proceeds. Therefore, the effect that, for example,<br>
the urea synthesis rate in the synthesis section is improved by 1.0% and the<br>
steam consumption in the whole urea plant per 1 t of urea production is<br>
reduced by 1.5% can be expected by the reduction in the water feed rate of<br>
1.56 t/h.<br>
[0096]<br>
By using the logic as described above, it was possible to optimize the<br>
operating conditions of the unreacted gas absorber of the urea production<br>
process based on the measured values of viscosity, density, and temperature.<br>
[0097]<br>
[Example 3]<br>
In the present Example, the optimization of the operating conditions of<br>
the absorption section was attempted in the case where only the high<br>
pressure absorber was installed in the urea production plant. In the<br>
absorption section, a facility including a single-stage high pressure absorber<br>
was used, which has a configuration (valve 17 is included, but valve 21 is not<br>
included) excluding the configuration around the low pressure absorber from<br>
after the valve 17 to the valve 21 in the configuration shown in Figure 3.<br>
When the high pressure absorber is used in a single stage, since the low<br>
pressure absorber does not present, the water used as an absorbent which is<br>
directly fed to the high pressure absorber from the concentration system<br>
through the valve 17 is caused to absorb ammonia and carbon dioxide and<br>
then returned to the synthesis section. The absorbent used here contains a<br>
small amount of urea because the water separated in the concentration<br>
section is used as the absorbent.<br>
[0098]<br>
The process variables around the high pressure absorber 2 at a certain<br>
time were as follows:<br>
operating pressure (instrument reading of the pressure controller 13): 15.8<br>
kg/cm2G(1.55MPaG),<br>
operating temperature (instrument reading temperature of the<br>
viscosity/density/temperature meter 29): 106°C,<br>
absorbent liquid feed rate (set value of the flow controller 8): 10.39 t/h,<br>
viscosity (instrument reading viscosity of the viscosity/density/temperature<br>
meter 29): 5.5 mPa•s,<br>
density (instrument reading density of the viscosity/density/temperature<br>
meter 29): 1150 kg/m3,<br>
flow rate of the outlet liquid from the high pressure unreacted gas absorber<br>
(instrument reading of the flow controller 16): 81.31 t/h.<br>
[0099]<br>
An oscillation-type instrument "Emerson-Solartron process density and<br>
viscosity meter" (trade name) was used as the viscosity/density/temperature<br>
meter, to simultaneously measure the viscosity, density, and temperature of<br>
the outlet liquid from the high pressure unreacted gas absorber in real time.<br>
Further, the flow rate of the outlet liquid from the high pressure unreacted gas<br>
absorber is also measured simultaneously with these measurements by a<br>
flow meter (step a or i).<br>
[0100]<br>
On the other hand, the carbon dioxide component concentration was<br>
determined from the correlation (Figure 1) between the carbon dioxide<br>
component concentration and viscosity of the outlet liquid (high pressure<br>
recovered liquid) from the high pressure unreacted gas absorber (step b or ii).<br>
Next, the ammonia component concentration was found from this carbon<br>
dioxide component concentration and the correlation (Figure 2(d)) between<br>
the ammonia component concentration, carbon dioxide component<br>
concentration, density, and temperature (step c or iii). Since the urea<br>
concentration in the absorption section is low enough, the influence of the<br>
variation of the urea concentration on the viscosity and density and on the<br>
equilibrium temperature and solidification temperature are small enough and<br>
can be ignored. The water concentration can be calculated by subtracting<br>
the ammonia component concentration and the carbon dioxide component<br>
concentration from the whole (step d or iv). As a result, the composition of<br>
the outlet liquid from the high pressure unreacted gas absorber was as<br>
shown in the following table.<br>
[0101]<br>
Note that the flow rate of each component (carbon dioxide component<br>
flow rate, ammonia component flow rate, and water flow rate) is found in the<br>
step v from the flow rate of the outlet liquid from the high pressure unreacted<br>
gas absorber measured in the step i and the carbon dioxide component<br>
concentration, ammonia component concentration, and water concentration<br>
determined in the steps ii to iv, respectively. The flow rate of each<br>
component is also shown in Table 3.<br>
[0102]<br>
<br>
[0103]<br>
The equilibrium temperature and solidification temperature of the<br>
aqueous ammonium carbamate solution having the above composition are<br>
found to be 112°C and 92°C, respectively (here, it is possible to judge<br>
whether it is necessary to adjust the flow rate of water or not, by finding the<br>
equilibrium temperature and solidification temperature). Since there is a<br>
difference of 6°C between the operating temperature (106°C) and the<br>
equilibrium temperature (112°C), and there is a difference of 14°C between<br>
the operating temperature (106°C) and the solidification temperature (92°C),<br>
it is possible to judge that the amount of water in the outlet liquid from the<br>
high pressure unreacted gas absorber can be reduced.<br>
[0104]<br>
Since it is preferred to reduce water concentration as far as possible, a<br>
composition was determined as described in the following table. This<br>
composition was determined by reducing only the amount of water so that<br>
the equilibrium temperature will be 111°C or more (allowance from the<br>
operating temperature is 5°C), and the solidification temperature will be<br>
101°C or less (allowance from the operating temperature is 5°C) without<br>
changing the operating pressure. In this case, the equilibrium temperature<br>
is 111°C, and the solidification temperature is 100°C.<br>
[0105]<br>
That is, from the component flow rates shown in Table 3, only the water<br>
flow rate of the outlet liquid from the high pressure unreacted gas absorber<br>
was varied to find the water flow rate Fmin water at which the water<br>
concentration is the minimum in the range represented by Formula 1 and<br>
Formula 2 mentioned above. As a result, it was determined to be 18.40 t/h<br>
(step v).<br>
[0106]<br>
<br>
[0107]<br>
In order to obtain this composition, the flow rate of water in the outlet<br>
liquid from the high pressure unreacted gas absorber should be set to 18.40<br>
t/h. Therefore, a set value of the flow controller 8 to be newly set will be<br>
10.39 - (20.25 -18.40) = 8.54 t/h. That is, the flow rate of water fed to the<br>
high pressure unreacted gas absorber, which is the minimum in the range in<br>
which the flow rate of water in the outlet liquid from the high pressure<br>
unreacted gas absorber is the Fmin water (18.40 t/h) or more, is 8.54 t/h.<br>
Therefore, the flow rate of water fed to the high pressure unreacted gas<br>
absorber is controlled to this value (step vi).<br>
[0108]<br>
By using the logic as described above, it was possible to optimize the<br>
operating conditions of the unreacted gas absorber of the urea production<br>
process based on the measured values of viscosity, density, and temperature.<br>
[0109]<br>
The smaller the amount of water in the system is, the more the<br>
synthetic reaction of urea proceeds. Therefore, the effect that, for example,<br>
the urea synthesis rate in the synthesis section is improved by 1.0% and the<br>
steam consumption in the whole urea plant per 11 of urea production is<br>
reduced by 1.5% can be expected by the reduction in the water feed rate of<br>
1.85 t/h.<br>
[0110]<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, the<br>
composition of the aqueous ammonium carbamate solution can be quickly<br>
measured by measuring the viscosity, density, and temperature thereof.<br>
That is, the composition of the unreacted-gas absorber outlet liquid can be<br>
directly specified in real time from the density, temperature, and viscosity.<br>
As a result, the effects to be described below can also be obtained.<br>
[0111]<br>
[Example 4]<br>
The optimization of the operating conditions of the absorption section<br>
was attempted in the case where the low pressure absorber and the high<br>
pressure absorber were successively installed in two stages in the urea<br>
production plant. In the absorption section, the absorption facility having a<br>
configuration shown in Figure 3 was used. The water used as an absorbent<br>
which is fed from the concentration system is allowed to absorb ammonia<br>
and carbon dioxide and then returned to the synthesis section. Since the<br>
water separated in the concentration section is used here as the absorbent, it<br>
contains a small amount of urea. When the absorbers are installed in two<br>
stages, water is fed to the low pressure absorber as the absorbent, and the<br>
outlet liquid from the low pressure absorber is fed to the high pressure<br>
absorber as the absorbent. Accordingly, the amount of water fed as the<br>
absorbent is determined such that the amount necessary for the low pressure<br>
absorber is compared with the amount necessary for the high pressure<br>
absorber, and one having a not-smaller value is selected between them.<br>
Thus, a necessary amount of water is fed by the flow controller 8.<br>
[0112]<br>
The process variables around the low pressure unreacted gas absorber<br>
1 and the high pressure unreacted gas absorber 2 at a certain time were the<br>
same as those of Examples 2 and 3, respectively. However, since water to<br>
the absorption section was fed only to the low pressure unreacted gas<br>
absorber, the feed rate of water was 10.3 t/h, which was the same as in<br>
Example 2.<br>
[0113]<br>
As found in Examples 3 and 4, the flow rate of water in the outlet liquid<br>
from the low pressure unreacted gas absorber should be set to 14.50 t/h, and<br>
the flow rate of water in the outlet liquid from the high pressure unreacted gas<br>
absorber should be set to 18.40 t/h. The feed rate of water which is needed<br>
for each absorber will be as follows: 10.3 - (16.06 -14.50) = 8.74 t/h for the<br>
low pressure unreacted gas absorber, and 10.3 - (20.25 -18.40) = 8.45 t/h<br>
for the high pressure unreacted gas absorber. A set value of the flow<br>
controller 8 to be newly set is a value which is not smaller of these, that is,<br>
8.74 t/h.<br>
[0114]<br>
By using the logic as described above, it was possible to optimize the<br>
operating conditions of the unreacted gas absorbers of the urea production<br>
process based on the measured values of viscosity, density, and temperature.<br>
[0115]<br>
The smaller the amount of water in the system is, the more the<br>
synthetic reaction of urea proceeds. Therefore, the effect that, for example,<br>
the urea synthesis rate in the synthesis section is improved by 1.0% and the<br>
steam consumption in the whole urea plant per 11 of urea production is<br>
reduced by 1.5% can be expected by the reduction in the water feed rate of<br>
1.6 t/h.<br>
[0116]<br>
As a result of using the analytical method as described above, the<br>
following effects can be expected.<br>
[0117]<br>
Since the composition of the unreacted-gas absorber outlet liquid<br>
(recovered liquid) can be known in real time, the feedback is remarkably<br>
quickly given to operation as compared with the analysis through the<br>
conventional sample collection. As a result, the integrated value of the<br>
deviations from the optimum operating conditions is remarkably small, and<br>
the content of water in the recovered liquid can be controlled to a value<br>
closer to the minimum. These results lead to the improvement in the urea<br>
conversion of the urea synthesis reactor and reduction in the energy<br>
consumption of the urea production plant.<br>
[0118]<br>
For example, the synthesis rate of the synthesis reactor can be<br>
increased by 1 to 2%, and the energy consumption of the urea plant can be<br>
reduced by 1 to 2%. Further, variations of operation can be instantaneously<br>
known from the results of the measurement, and the losses of ammonia and<br>
carbon dioxide can be reduced by always keeping the absorption<br>
performance at a level close to the optimum.<br>
[0119]<br>
Since the composition of the recovered liquid can be always monitored<br>
with the viscosity, density, and temperature, the analysis through sample<br>
collection and the personnel for it are not required, thereby achieving<br>
rationalization.<br>
[0120]<br>
It is possible to use an industrial measurement device for<br>
simultaneously measuring viscosity, density, and temperature, which is<br>
inexpensive and excellent in durability as compared with a refractometer or<br>
the like. That is excellent in terms of maintenance and cost.<br>
[0121]<br>
When, for example, an oscillating instrument is used as such a<br>
measurement device, it is not necessary to use a dilution device which is<br>
required for measuring electric conductivity, a cooling device which is<br>
required for using a photometer, and a colorimetric analyzer which is required<br>
for performing analysis by a colorimetric method. Thus, the complication of<br>
measuring devices can be avoided.<br>
[0122]<br>
By adding simple software, it is possible to display, in real time, the<br>
composition, equilibrium temperature, and solidification temperature of the<br>
recovered liquid, and the mass balance around the unreacted gas absorber,<br>
and it is possible to provide much information useful for operators. Further,<br>
operators can be instructed by programming and incorporating a rule for<br>
determining the optimum set value of each controller based on such<br>
information. Thereby, the optimum operation can be performed even by an<br>
operator who is not skillful. Furthermore, if the set value which can be<br>
determined by the rule is automatically fed back to each controller, fully<br>
automatic optimization of operation can be achieved without participation of a<br>
human with respect to disturbances to the unreacted gas absorber.<br>
[0123]<br>
Since the logic of the software is simple and the data volume is small, it<br>
can be installed also on a commercially available personal computer.<br>

There are provided a method for analyzing an aqueous ammonium<br>
