				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for preparation of an insulation composition based on HTPB propellants and more particularly to an insulation composition for case bonded rocket motors utilising Hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene based composite propellants and a process for the preparation thereof.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Rocket motors utilising solid composite propellants basically utilise either carboxyl-terminated polybutadiene (CTPB) or Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) based solid propellants. An important requirement of such rocket motors is that the wall insulation should adequately adhere to the combustion chamber and similarly composite propellant should adequately adhere to the insulation system and the one major requirement for achieving this adherence is that the insulation system should be compatible with the solid propellant used in the rocket motor. The combustion of a propellant in the rocket motor creates a hostile environment inside the rocket motor chamber characterised by extremely high temperature, pressure<br>
Another disadvantage of EPDM insulation system  is<br>
that  it utilises asbestos as "filler material  which  is highly toxic in nature and is banned in many countries.<br>
Still  another  disadvantage  of  EDPM  insulation system is that in case of hydroxyl terminated  butadiene<br>
propellant, there is a mismatch between young's  modulus of  propellant and the insulation system resulting in  a<br>
weaker bond between them.<br>
Nitrile  rubber is yet another type of  insulation<br>
system,  known  in the art, utilised for  rocket  motors based  on hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene propel1ants.<br>
However,  this  insulation  system  also  suffers   from following disadvantages.<br>
The main disadvantage of nitrile rubber insulation<br>
system  is  that its compatibility with the  HTPB  based propellant  is not as good as the compatibility  between<br>
the  insulator  and propellant having  the  same  binder matric,  thereby  affecting  the shelf  life  of  rocket<br>
motors  and  behavior of  insulator-propellant  bond  at lower temperatures.<br>
Another  disadvantage  of  the  above   insulation<br>
system  is  that  its glass  transition  temperature  is<br>
o around  (-50 C)  which does not match with that  of  the<br>
o propellant (-70 C) and as such the insulation may  break<br>
even before the propellant at lower temperatures.<br>
Still  another  disadvantage  of  Nitrile   rubber<br>
insulation  is that its thermal conductivity  is  higher thereby  lowering  its  ability  in  protecting  exposed<br>
rocket  motor  parts from  high  temperatures  generated inside the motor chamber during the combustion.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Primary  object  of the present  invention  is  to provide  an  insulation formulation  for  rocket  motors based  on HTPB propellants which is compatible with  the HTPB  propellant  thereby  resulting  in  stronger  bond between  the insulation formulation and  the  propellant and a process for the preparation thereof.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is  to provide  an  insulation formulation  for  rocket  motors<br>
based  on HTPB props11ants wherein there is  a  complete match   between   the  binder   matrix   of   insulation formulation and the propel1ant.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide an insulation formulation for rocket motors<br>
based on HTPB propellants which does not get affected with ageinq thus improving the shelf life of the rocket<br>
motors.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is  to provide  an  insulation formulation  for  rocket  motors based  on HTPB propellants wherein the  bonding  between<br>
insulation system and propellant is not affected even at<br>
o very  low temperatures around -30 C at which the  rocket<br>
motors  are normally tested for evaluation of their  low temperature performance.<br>
Further  object  of the present  invention  is  to provide an insulation formulation for rocket motors based on  HTPB  propellants which does not utilise  any  toxic materials.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an insulation formulation for rocket motors<br>
based on HTPB propellents which has sufficiently long pot life (3—4 hours) thus facilitating the calendering<br>
and rolling of the insulation system.<br>
Still further another object of the present invention is to provide an insulation formulation for<br>
rocket motors based on HTPB propellants which has lower density thereby reducing the inert weight of the rocket<br>
motor.<br>
Even further object of the present invention is to<br>
provide  an  insulation formulation  for  rocket  motor*<br>
o which has a glass transition temperature (-77 C)  nearly<br>
o matching with that of the propellant (—70 C) .<br>
Still  further object of the present invention  is<br>
to provide an insulation for rocket motors which  has  a<br>
o lower  thermal  conductivity  of  0.108  w/m/ K  thereby<br>
improving  its ability to protect exposed  rocket  motor parts from high temperatures generated inside the rocket chamber during combustion.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide an insulation formulation for rocket motors based on HTPB propellants which has comparable rate of ablation (0.21 mm/sec) resulting in lower erosion rate of insulation layer during combustion.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide an insulation formulation for rocket motors based on HTPB propellants which can be prepared utilising simpler processing techniques.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>

insulation sheets and it does not utilise any banned material. Further, it has lower density thereby<br>
