This invention relates to a process for preparing addition curable phenolic resins particularly with improved char residue.<br>
Phenolic resin possessing ethynyl phenyl azo groups belong to a new<br>
family that can be thermally polymerised by an addition mechanism to a<br>
crosslinked polymer whose thermal stability and anaerobic char residue are<br>
superior to those of conventional condensation phenolic resins and hitherto<br>
known addition-curable phenolics. Phenolic resins are work horse matrices in<br>
composites for structural and thermostructural applications in aerospace<br>
industry. This is an important area witnessing rapid evolution in process and<br>
technology. The detailed chemistry, processes and applications of phenolic<br>
resins have been compiled by Knop and others in the book. Chemistry and<br>
Applications of Phenolic Resin, publisher Verlag, 1979. Some of the salient<br>
features of phenolic resins include good thermal stability and high char-yield at<br>
higher temperature and slow rate of thermal erosion. Conventional phenolic<br>
resins based on resole and novolac undergo curing by condensation mechanism,<br>
with concomitant evolution of volatile by-products. This feature of such resins<br>
necessitate application of counter pressure during moulding to get void-free<br>
components either from the neat resin or from their composites. A solution to<br>
this problem is to synthesise phenolic resins that cure by addition mechanism.<br>
Allyl and vinyl functional phenolic resin cannot be moulded as such, since the<br>
polymerisation of these functional groups proceed with great difficulty and is<br>
generally incomplete. Such polymers also need a cure catalyst like peroxides to<br>
induce crosslinking 	<br><br>
content estimation and by its molecular characteristics of gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The degree of substitution is varied by regulating the quantity of ethynyl phenyl diazonium chloride used for coupling with the phenol formaldehyde resin. The substitution by ethynyl phenyl azo groups varies from 50 to 70% by weight. The number average molecular weight (Mn) of the resultant polymer varies in the range 300 to 400 and the polydispersity in the range 3 to 6. The prepolymer is then thermally cured at 200 to 250°C to the crosslinked network and the thermal stability of the cured polymer is assessed by thermogravimetric analysis in nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction scheme for the synthesis and thermal polymerisation are shown in scheme 1. The characterisations are described in detail later.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for preparing addition curable phenolic resin having ethynyl phenyl azo groups comprising the steps of coupling ethynyl phenyl diazonium salt with a phenol formaldehyde resin, separating, purifying and drying the precipitated phenolic resin having ethynyl phenyl azo groups.<br>
Ethynyl phenyl diazonium salt is prepared by diazotising amino phenyl acetylene with sodium nitrite in the presence of sulphuric acid.<br><br>
in 80 ml 1 normal sodium hydroxide) at 0°C and stirred well. After the addition, the solution is kept for one to three hours by occasional stirring at the same temperature. The reaction mixture is then added to distilled water and the pH is adjusted to 7 by adding dilute sulphuric acid. The precipitate formed is filtered. It is dissolved in 100 ml acetone and precipitated to one litre distilled water containing 100 ml of methanol. The product is filtered and then dried in vacuum at 40-60°C. Yield obtained is 13 to 15g (70-80%).<br>
Example 2 :<br>
In this examples all the reaction parameters and steps are the same as in example 1, except that the quantity of meta amino phenyl acetylene and sodium nitrite taken are 12 g. each and the latter is dissolved in 50 ml distilled water.<br>
Example 3 :<br>
In this examples all the reaction parameters and steps are the same as in example 1, except that the quantity of m-amino phenyl acetylene and sodium nitrite taken are 15g. each and the latter is dissolved in 60 ml distilled water.<br>
The following are the methods by which the polymer described in examples 1, 2 and 3 are characterised.<br>
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis of the resin at a heating<br>
rate of 10°C/minute shows the initiation of	<br><br>
the  curing at 150°C.  The cure reaction is completed  at  230°C. The  infra red spectrum of the product shows a strong  abosrption at  3290cm" due to the terminal acetylene group.   The  hydroxyl group  absorptions  are located at 3300-3800cm  .   The  spectrum shows other characteristic absorptions due to the aromatic groups at  1550  and 1600cm  .  The molecular weight of the  polymer  is found by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) of the polymer, done in  tetrahydrofuran (THF) and is in the range of  peak  moelcular weight  (Mp),  1100-2500, number average moleuclar  weight  (Mn), 300-400,  weight average molecular weight (Mw), 1000-2100.   The composition of  the polymer is found from the nitrogen-content of the  polymer as estimated by the micro elemental  analysis.   The composition  can be varied by regulating the amount of  diazonium salt used for the coupling reaction as in examples 2 and 3.   The characteristics  of  polymers with different degrees  of  ethynyl phenyl  a2o substitution are given in table 1.  A maximum  of  70 mol%  of  ethynyl  phenyl azo substitution with  respect  to  the phenol function is possible.<br>
Thermal Curing:<br>
The curing of the resin is done by heating at 200-250°C for 2 to 4 hrs and is followed by infra red spectrum which shows the complete disappearance of the absorption at 3290cm" due to the acetylene groups. The crosslinking is evidenced also from the insolubility of the cured polymer in all solvents in which the  precursor  is  soluble.  These  solvents  include,  acetone,<br><br>
tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl formamide and methyl ethyl ketone. The cured polymer on analysis for thermal stability by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) done under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10°C/minute shows mass-loss starting from 350°C. The slow rate of thermal erosion is evidenced from good char residue at higher temperature. A char residue of 69-73% is obtained at 700°C whereas the cured conventional resole gives only  60-63%  char under idential  thermal  analysis  conditions.<br>
Isothermal pyrolysis of the resin at 700°C for 2 hours in  arogen<br>
*<br>
shows  70-73% char residue for these polymers as  against  55-60% for cured resole under identical conditions.<br>

The major advantage of the present process is that it gives a method for the synthesis of a new family of addition-cure phenolic bearing ethynyl phenyl azo groups.<br><br>
