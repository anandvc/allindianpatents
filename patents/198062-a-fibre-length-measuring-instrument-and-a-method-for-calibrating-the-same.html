The present invention relates to a fibre length measuring instrument and a method for calibrating the fibre length measuring instrument.<br>
The invented device is very simple for accurate calibration, to overcome errors and difficulties that arise from the conventional method.<br>
Specially prepared cotton having good homogeneous properties is called calibration cotton. This cotton has length variation of ± 0.6mm. While calibration, this calibration cotton is used as standard and the instrument reading is adjusted to match calibration cotton value.<br>
The length measuring instruments has the following main disadvantages while using conventional method:<br>
i.     The calibration cotton having ± 0.6mm length variation is used for<br>
instrument calibration, therefore the accuracy of the instrument is affected.<br>
ii.     Since the cost of the calibration cotton is high, the calibration procedure is expensive.<br>
iii.     The reading of calibration cotton which is used, is entered by the operator. Therefore chances for manipulating the reading is high.<br>
The principle objective of the present invention is to overcome the above mentioned difficulties and disadvantages .<br>
Accordingly this invention relates to a fibre length measuring instrument, comprising a light source containing light emitting diodes emitting light that passes through a source lens to a collector lens and reaches a light sensor, characterized in that a film with pre-designed opaque patterns for calibration being is mounted on a film holder, said film holder having fixing means to fix on<br><br>
a fibre comb holder by means of rotating balls said rotating balls  is immovably fixed in the holes provided in the said fibre comb holder.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
This invention will be explained in more detail below with the aid of an exemplary embodiment illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein,<br>
Figure 1        shows on of the principles of fibre length measuring instrument,<br>
where the above invention can be used.<br>
Figure 2        shows pre-designed calibration film with its arrangements in fibre<br>
length measuring instrument.<br>
Figure 3        shows the ball catch and its location which is specially made for<br>
placement of pre-designed film in the instrument.<br>
Figure 4        shows graphs of light intensity obstruction Vs movement of film.<br>
Figure 5,6,7   shows the different types of films used to achieve light intensity<br>
variation while movement.<br>
Figure 8        shows the different intensity in same type of pre-designed calibration<br>
film.<br>
Referring to figure 1, a light source containing light emitting diodes (9) emits light and it passes through the source lens (7) to the collector lens (8) and reaches the light sensor (6). There the light intensity is measured in terms of voltage by the light sensor. While testing the length of the fibre, the fibre comb (10) which is holding the fibre (11) is passed in between the collector lens (8) and source lens (7). The movement of fibre and voltage variation in light sensor (6) is interlinked to measure the length of the fibre by special computer software.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br><br>
An embodiment of this is described herewith with reference to the accompanying figure 2 showing the new invention arrangement to calibrate the length measuring instrument by pre-designed film (5).<br>
In this invention, pre-designed film (5) is mounted on film holder (1). Height (12) of the pre-designed film (5) is selected accordingly for the entry of calibration film freely, into the optic light sensor (6) of the fibre length measuring instrument. Fibre length is measured in the principle of light intensity variation due to the obstruction of fibres in the comb (10) while is moves inside the instrument.<br>
Calibration film (5) was designed to reproduce this principle by obstructing light when it moves inside the instrument. The pre-designed calibration film is designed in such a way that the obstruction of the passing light intensity gradually increases toward the film holder of the film as shown in figure 4. Figure 5,6 and 7 illustrates the different types of films that are used to obstruct the light intensity. Referring to figure 8, different ranges of light obstruction in a particular type of film is shown. Therefore instrument calibration can be made from low range to high range and it increases precision of the instrument reading.<br>
Testing Procedure<br>
The pre-designed film (5) placed on the fibre comb holder (2) will fix exactly at its position by means of a rotating metal ball (4) mounted on the film holder (figure 3). It will fix in a suitable cavity or hole provided on the fibre comb holder (2) to locate the film exactly in its position. By this arrangement the width of the film and the width of the light measuring source center will align accurately. The fibre comb holder (2) will move toward the optic light sensor (6) by mechanical arrangement, while the pre-designed film (5) enters the optic light sensor (6),<br><br>
obstruction of light intensity starts from minimum and it will increase to maximum while the fibre comb holder (2) moves towards the optic source. The obstruction of light measured is directly proportional to the movement of the pre-designed film (5). A special program is incorporated to store the data of movement of film and intensity of light measurement accurately.<br>
In the software, the light obstruction data of two or more pre-designed films may be stored as standard values. By using the above recorded data, the special software will compare it with the light obstruction data of the calibration film, while calibrating the instrument. If any difference between standard and measured value is observed, a suitable correction factor will be applied to match the standard value of the pre-designed film (5).<br>
By the same procedure one or more films are used to find out the correction factor to suit the full length range of the instrument test value. During the calculation of the correction factor, the instrument will calculate only the measured average values of five or more readings. The standard value of the film will be marked on the film holder (1). The above correction factor was used to overcome the variation in the light emitting intensity, optic sensor aging variations, mechanical wear and tear will be taken care to maintain the instrument accuracy. The range of correction factor was restricted in software by the set values of the maximum range. If the correction factor goes beyond a limit, then the instrument needs to be serviced to bring down the correction factor within range.<br><br><br><br>
