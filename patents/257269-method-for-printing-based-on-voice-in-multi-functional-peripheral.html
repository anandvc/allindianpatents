				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention in general relates to the Printers and MFP's (Multi Function Peripherals). Further, the present invention relates to an MFP device having inbuilt Microphone or any Voice Recognition Peripheral. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system and method for printing on voice in MFP.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
A German Patent Application bearing no. DE 39 10 467 A1 titled "Method and Device for Generating Reports" describes that speech signals, including predetermined trigger expressions, are transmitted e.g. by a multiple line telephone to a speech recognition system. The speech recognition system assigns the trigger expressions to predetermined blocks of text messages and generates a report. The text is then released to a speech synthesizer wherein synthetic speech signals are generated, which are read out to a speech memory and relay system for later recovery. The system also produces a printed copy of text in the report.<br>
However the above invention cannot deal with the real-time speech printing. Moreover, to get speech printed, user need to have a separate computer where the speech will be stored before it gets printed.<br>
In addition, a "Communication System" is known from the German patent application P 41 01 200.3 with the same title, which converts speech dictated to a transmitting and receiving device into synthetic speech and/or into text. The speech<br><br>
and/or text is then relayed to a central receiver. Particularly ISDN/telefax, ISDN/telex and letter mail are mentioned for the relaying.<br>
However, this invention does not talk about the printing of speech message.<br>
The US Patent no. 5,920,835 provides a method for generating, sending, receiving and commenting a text document via a telecommunication installation. In this method a text document is generated by means of speech and converted into text data by a speech recognizer (SEK). Further the text data can be corrected, edited and commented by means of speech. Transmission is automatic via the telecommunication installation (VA).<br>
However, this method again doesn't talk about any kind of printing of the message.<br>
In another US Patent bearing no. 6,173,259 a speech-to-text conversion system is provided which comprises at least one user terminal for recording speech, at least one automatic speech recognition processor to generate text from a recorded speech file, and communication means operative to return a corresponding text file to a user, in which said at least one user terminal is remote from said at least one automatic speech recognition processor, and a server is provided remote from said at least one user terminal to control the transfer of recorded speech files to a selected automatic speech recognition processor.<br><br>
This method talks about recognizing speech and converting it into text format but it doesn't talk about printing the speech.<br>
Automatic speech recognition, as such, is known from, for example, "Automatic Speech Recognition" by Kai-Fu Lee, Kluwer Academic Publishers 1989.<br>
In the Conventional known systems for converting speech to text involving automatic speech recognition are desktop stand alone systems, in which each user needs his or her system. Such known speech to text conversion systems have been produced by various companies.<br>
In a first aspect, the existing technology relates to a speech to text converter comprising at least one user terminal for recording speech, at least one automatic speech recognition processor, and a communication means operative to return the resulting text to a user, in which said at least one user terminal is remote from said at least one automatic speech recognition processor, the speech to text converter including a server remote from said at least one user terminal, the server being operative to control transfer of recorded speech files to a selected automatic speech recognition processor.<br>
The above known method and systems are able to transcribe human speech to text, albeit imperfectly. The text results are presented to the user after a small delay whilst he or she is still dictating. This has a number of disadvantages. Firstly the instantaneous text presentation can confuse and alter the behaviour of the user<br><br>
who is speaking. Also, it requires that the user must themselves correct errors, usually using a text editor. Accordingly, the user must switch between the tasks of speaking and correcting, resulting in inefficiency.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention is therefore to invent a method and system for printing on voice in MFP which shall make the speech to text process easier.<br>
It is another object of the invention wherein the printer will recognize and receive the complete data from the person and converts in bits and bytes of the data and store in a memory and finally Print in the paper with an default loaded Font.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a method of speech to text wherein the Printer will become most eco-friendly Peripheral.<br><br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a method wherein the Printer shall not wait for any support Peripheral to get the data.<br>
The present invention relates to an MFP system having Inbuilt Microphone or any Voice Recognition Peripherals. The system will have inbuilt 'SpeechtoPrint' component which will be used in the process to convert the speech to text and the print the data. The system will record the speech with the help of any voice recognition peripherals and then would convert the speech into text with the help of SpeechtoPrint module which shall convert speech into text format and store in the memory. Once the complete data is stored, it launches printing of the stored data.<br>
Accordingly this invention explains a method of printing on voice in an MFP comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	speaking the words for printing in front of MFP with a microphone by the user;<br>
(b)	initiating the operation by the user by pressing the start button on MFP;<br>

the MFP by the user once the conversion and recording are over; (g) passing the final converted data from SpeechToText module to Memory<br>
module by the SpeechToPrint task; (h) formatting all the data received during a session and preparing the said data<br>
for printing by the memory module; (i) sending the print ready data from Memory Module to printing component of<br>
the MFP by the SpeechToPrint task; and (j) printing the required data.<br>
The SpeechtoPrint function converts speech into text format and store in the memory. When the complete data in text is stored, the printing of the stored data starts. The said SpeechtoPrint has a SpeechToPrint task which initiates the Speech to Text component which converts voice into text format. The SpeechToPrint task is initiated once when user selects to print the voice which is recording. The SpeechToPrint task gets the text data from SpeechToText component and pass to Printer's memory in file format. When user finishes speaking, SpeechToPrint task gets all data and passes it to printing component of MFP which prints data in default font. The said SpeechtoPrint has a SpeechToText Module which converts voice into text format where the said module is called by SpeechToPrint task which gets input as voice from user. The SpeechToText Module converts voice into text format and returns back to the SpeechToPrint task. SpeechtoPrint function has a memory module which stores data into Printers memory and is initiated by SpeechToPrint task which gets data from SpeechToText Module. When user finishes speaking, the whole data stored in memory is passed to Printing component by SpeechToPrint<br><br>
task for printing.<br>

Figure 1 depicts the communication model for voice printing. The user will speak in front of MFP. The data will be passed to Speech to Text converter which will convert data to text format. MFP will then print the data in default font<br>
To record the speech user can speak in front of the MFP which has one microphone. Once user is finished speaking, he/she can press stop button and then the application running inside MFP will send data for printing. The data gets recorded and converted into the text format by the application running on MFP on real-time basis. The data would be printed in default font.<br>
Figure 1 shows the detailed steps involved in the process. There is one component<br><br>
'SpeechtoPrint' used in the process. The details of the component are mentioned below:<br>
SpeechtoPrint: The function of this component is to convert speech into text format and store in the memory. Once the complete data is stored, it launches printing of the stored data. The main parts of this component are:<br>
SpeechToPrint task: This is the task which will be initiated once user selects that he or she wants to print the voice which he or she is recording. This task will initiate the Speech to Text component which will convert voice into text format. This task also gets the text data from Speech To Text component and pass to Printer's memory in file format. Once user finishes speaking, this task gets all data and passes it to existing printing component of MFP which prints data in default font.<br>
SpeechToText Module: This is a standard module which converts voice into text format This is called by SpeechToPrint task and it gets input as voice from user. It converts voice into text format and returns back to the SpeechToPrint task.<br>
Memory Module: The memory module is the component which stores data into Printers memory. This is also initiated by SpeechToPrint task which gets data from SpeechToText Module and sends it memory module. Once user finishes speaking, the whole data stored in memory is passed to Printing component by SpeechToPrint task.<br><br>
The following steps are involved in the process:<br>
1.	User wants to print the speech and he or she speaks it in front of MFP containing a microphone.<br>
2.	User presses start button present on MFP to start the operation.<br>
3.	The   voice   data   is   passed   to   SpeechToText   component   through SpeechToPrint task.<br>
4.	SpeechToText converts voice commands into text formats and returns back data to the SpeechToText task.<br>
5.	SpeechToPrint task passes data to memory module to store it<br>
6.	Once user finishes recording, he or she presses stop button.<br>
7.	SpeechToPrint task takes final converted data from SpeechToText module and passes it to Memory module.<br>
8.	Memory module formats all data received during this session and prepares it for printing.<br>
9.	SpeechToPrint task print ready data from Memory Module and sends it to printing component of the MFP.<br>
10.The required data gets printed.<br>
In Normal Printing what we are doing is we are just typing the document in the MS-Word or WordPad and print the same by using PCL-Driver or now Direct Printing Technology, But in this Scenario the Printing Methodology will be as similar as what we had in the Previous ERA but some advantage here is the Voice will be recognized and at the same time those voice will be converted into the data &amp; the same Prints out.<br><br>
