A PROCESS FOR PREPARING 2-[(2,6-DICHLOROPHENYL) AMINO] BENZENE-ACETIC ACID CARBOXYMETHYL ESTER;<br>
AMOLI ORGANICS PVT. LTD., A COMPANY INCORPORATED UNDER THE COMPANIES ACT, 1956, WHOSE ADDRESS IS 407, DALAMAL HOUSE, J. BAJAJ ROAD, NARIMAN POINT, MUMBAI-400 021, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA.<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing non-steroidal anti¬inflammatory drug and its intermediate.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Formula IV<br>
Compound of formula IV can be prepared by an intermediate of formula III.<br>
Formula III<br>
Aceclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, which acts specifically on inflammatory sites and thereby decreases the inflammation. It is highly effective as an anti-inflammatory drug for various inflammatory conditions. The chemical name of aceclofenac is 2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl) amino] benzeneacetic acid carboxymethyl ester and is represented by formula IV in the present invention.<br><br><br><br>
US 4,548,952 discloses a process for preparing aceclofenac. It is synthesized by reacting 2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl) amino] phenylacetic acid salt with benzyl haloacetate in an anhydrous organic liquid medium of polar and aprotic character like dimethylformamide, acetonitrils, dimethylsulphoxide, and the like to form a benzyl ester. The benzyl ester is isolated and then hydrogenated in the presence of palladium absorbed on carbon to give aceclofenac. Thisprocess uses an expensive catalyst. The reaction time is also lengthy.<br>
KR 200001448 discloses a method for preparing aceclofenac. Sodium 2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl) amino] phenylacetate and alkyl haloacetate are reacted in lower aliphatic alcohol derivatives or its ester in the presence of alkali metal carbonate and phase transfer catalyst to give 2-[2-(2,6-dichlorophenyl) amino] phenyl] acetoxy] acetate. This product is hydrolyzed in the presence of a solvent and a catalyst to give aceclofenac. The above reaction being a solid-liquid reaction is difficult for commercial production.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a simple process for the preparation of Aceclofenac.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to reduce the number of steps in the manufacturing process.<br>

The step of reacting a compound of formula I with a compound of formula II is carried out in a solvent and a phase transfer catalyst.<br>
O^       „0^	^COOR<br><br>
wherein M represents alkali metal atom; X is a halogen atom, R is alkyl or phenyl substituent.<br>
The second aspect of the present invention provides a process for the preparation of compound of formula III which comprises reacting a compound of formula I with a<br><br>
compound of formula II to obtain a compound of formula III, the above step is carriec out in a solvent and a phase transfer catalyst.<br><br>

In the above scheme, M represents sodium or potassium; X is Br or CI, preferably CI; R is alkyl or phenyl substituent, preferably t-butyl.<br>
According to the present invention, 2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl) amino] phenylacetic acid salt of formula I is reacted with a-haloacetic acid ester of formula II in the presence of a solvent and a phase transfer catalyst to form a compound of formula III. The a-haloacetic acid ester is preferably t-butyl-chloroacetate.<br><br>
the solvent is selected from the group comprising of hexane, cyclohexane, aliphatic,<br>
aromatic solvents. The preferable solvent is toluene.<br>
The phase transfer catalyst is selected from the group comprising of ammonium and<br>
phosphonium  salts.  The  preferable  phase  transfer catalyst  is  triethyl  benzyl<br>
ammonium bromide.<br>
The ratio of solvent to phase transfer catalyst is 1:0.0025 to 1:0.1.<br>
The reaction is carried out at a temperature from 35-120 deg C, preferably 60-80 deg<br>

Toluene is distilled out from the reaction mixture. The reaction mass is cooled to 45-<br>
50 deg C. In the same reaction vessel, without the isolation of compound of formula<br>
III and phase transfer catalyst, a deprotecting agent is added. The deprotecting<br>
agent is formic acid or trifluoroacetic acid. The temperature of the reaction mixture is<br>
maintained between 45-50 deg C, for about 8 hours to form compound of formula IV<br>
