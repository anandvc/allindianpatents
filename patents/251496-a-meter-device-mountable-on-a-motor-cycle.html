				<td>METER DEVICE OF MOTORCYCLE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
5 The present invention relates to a meter device of a<br>
motorcycle including a plurality of independent indicator<br>
portions aligned and arranged in a vehicle width direction and<br>
a housing, which supports the indicator portions.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
10 In some cases in a motorcycle, a meter device, in which<br>
left and right, independent speed meters and tachometers are<br>
aligned and arranged in a vehicle width direction, is mounted<br>
above a headlight (see, for example, Japanese Patent No.<br>
3313765).<br>
15 Also, a wind pressure caused by a travel wind imposes,<br>
in some cases, a load on a rider according to a model of a<br>
motorcycle and it is requested to lessen such wind pressure<br>
caused by a travel wind.<br>
However, lessening of wind pressure caused by a travel<br>
20   wind is not taken into consideration in a motorcycle provided<br>
with the conventional meter device.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention has been thought of in view of the<br>
25   conventional situation and has its object to provide a meter<br>
1<br><br><br>
device of a motorcycle, which can lessen a wind pressure caused<br>
by a travel wind.<br>
The invention has a feature in a meter device of a<br>
motorcycle arranged in the vicinity of a steering handle to<br>
5 comprise a plurality of independent indicator portions aligned<br>
and arranged in a vehicle width direction and a housing, which<br>
supports the indicator portions, and wherein as viewed from<br>
laterally of a vehicle, a first portion of the housing<br>
positioned forward between the indicator portions and inclined<br>
10 rearwardly upward is positioned in the same position as that<br>
of a second portion positioned forwardly of the respective<br>
indicator portions and inclined rearwardly upward, or projects<br>
forward therefrom.<br>
With the meter device according to the invention, the<br>
15 second portion and the first portion, which correspond to a<br>
front wall of the housing, are inclined rearwardly upward, a<br>
wind-pressure lessening effect that a travel wind is led to<br>
a neighborhood above a rider's head by the second portion and<br>
the first portion is produced, thus enabling lessening a wind<br>
20 pressure acting on a rider. According to the invention, since<br>
the first portion is in the same position as that of, or projects<br>
forwardly of the second portion as viewed from laterally of<br>
a vehicle, a portion corresponding to a front wall of the<br>
housing is curved in shape such that a central portion thereof<br>
25   in the vehicle width direction is positioned foremost and both<br>
2<br><br><br>
sides thereof sweep back, that is, it is liable to produce a<br>
so-called wind protection effect, thus enabling producing a<br>
high wind-pressure lessening effect while being small in size.<br>
That is, in the case where the first portion is dented<br>
5 rearwardly of the left and right second portions in contrast<br>
to the invention, there is a fear that a travel wind flows<br>
concentratedly on such dented portion to be liable to strike<br>
directly against rider's head and face, by which the<br>
wind-pressure lessening effect cannot be adequately produced.<br>

housing 32 are positioned outwardly of left and right edges<br>
25   of the headlight 15 in the vehicle width direction as viewed<br>
10<br><br><br>
from the front of a vehicle.<br>
Bottomed, cylindrical-shaped mounts 63b/ 63b are formed<br>
on a bottom of the lower housing 63 to extend obliquely<br>
rearwardly and upwardly, obliquely forwardly and downwardly<br>
5 projecting boss portions 60f, 60f are formed on the body case<br>
60'. The lower housing 63 is fixed to the meter body 60 by<br>
clamping the respective mounts 63b to the boss portions 60f,<br>
60f by mount screws 65, 65 (see Fig. 6).<br>
The upper housing 64 includes an outer peripheral wall<br>
10 64a contiguous to the lower housing 63 to extend obliquely<br>
rearwardly and upwardly, circular-shaped left and right inner<br>
peripheral walls 64b, 64c bent inwardly from an upper end of<br>
the outer peripheral wall 64a to extend obliquely forwardly<br>
and upwardly to surround outer peripheral edges of the speed<br>
15 indicator portion 17 and the engine speed indicator portion<br>
18, and an inner wall 64d connecting the left and right inner<br>
peripheral walls 64b, 64c together and surrounding an outer<br>
peripheral edge of the fuel reserve indicator portion 19. A<br>
rear portion 64e of the inner wall 64d covers a base of the<br>
20   fuel reserve indicator pointer 19b.<br>
Left and right, front, outer peripheral walls 64a' of<br>
the upper housing 64 project so as to assume the form of a pent<br>
roof rearwardly of the outer peripheral wall 64a between the<br>
indicator portions (see Figs. 6 and 7) . The left and right,<br>
25   front, outer peripheral walls 64a' increase visibility of the<br>
11<br><br><br>
speed indicator portion 17 and the engine speed indicator<br>
portion 18 as viewed from a rider.<br>
As shown in Fig. 9, pointed portions 64f are formed on<br>
inner end surfaces of the left and right inner peripheral walls<br>
5 64b, 64c and the inner wall 64d of the upper housing 64 to abut<br>
against the left and right indicator lens portions 61a, 61b<br>
and the inbetween indicator lens portion 61c, respectively.<br>
Engagement projections 64g are formed at predetermined<br>
circumferential intervals on a front edge of the outer<br>
10 peripheral wall 64a of the upper housing 64. Engagement holes<br>
63d, with which the engagement projections 64f engage, are<br>
formed on the opening 63a of the lower housing 63.<br>
The upper housing 64 is fittingly fixed to the lower<br>
housing 63 by causing the pointed portions 64f to abut against<br>
15 the respective lens portions 61a to 61c and causing the<br>
respective engagement projections 64g to engage with the<br>
engagement holes 63d, and pushes the lens 61 against the body<br>
case 60' with the sealing member 62 therebetween. A sealing<br>
member 66 is interposed between the engagement wall portion<br>
20 61d of the lens 61 and the outer peripheral wall 64a of the<br>
upper housing 64.<br>
An arcuate recess 63e following an upper, outer surface<br>
of the headlight 15 is formed on a front bottom of the lower<br>
housing 63. The lower housing 63 and the headlight 15 are<br>
25   arranged in relative positions, in which an upper edge of the<br>
12<br><br><br>
headlight 15 enters the recess 63e. Thereby, the bottom of<br>
the lower housing 63 overlaps the upper edge of the headlight<br>
15 as viewed from laterally of a vehicle.<br>
A front wall of the housing 32 includes an inbetween<br>
5   indicator portion front portion (first portion) 32a positioned<br>

(second portion) 32b, 32b positioned forwardly of the speed<br>
10 indicator portion 17 and the engine speed indicator portion<br>
18 and inclined rearwardly upward to be directed above a rider's<br>
head.<br>
The inbetween indicator portion front portion 32a and<br>
the left and right indicator portion front portions 32b, 32b<br>
15 form parts of the upper housing 64 and the lower housing 63<br>
and mutually assume a substantially same configuration. More<br>
specifically, the inbetween indicator portion front portion<br>
32a bulges a little forwardly of the left and right indicator<br>
portion front portions 32b, 32b as viewed from laterally of<br>
20   a vehicle. In addition, a central/ lower portion 32c of the<br>
inbetween indicator portion front portion 32a in the vehicle<br>
width direction is dented a little relative to other parts.<br>
As viewed from a rider, the housing 32 are curved so that<br>
the inbetween indicator portion front portion 32a is<br>
25  positioned at a foremost end centrally in the vehicle width<br>
13<br><br><br>
direction and the left and right indicator portion front<br>
portions 32b, 32b are positioned outward in the vehicle width<br>
direction and rearward relative to the inbetween indicator<br>
portion front portion 32a.<br>
5 Folded surfaces 63f, 63f are formed on left and right<br>
sides of a lower edge of the lower housing 63 to be contiguous<br>
to the bottom surface of the lower housing 63 to extend rearward<br>
toward the rear of a vehicle.<br>
According to the embodiment, since the inbetween<br>
10 indicator portion front portion 32a inclined rearwardly<br>
upwardly of the housing 32 is caused to project forwardly of<br>
the left and right indicator portion front portions 32b, 32b,<br>
a wind pressure acting on a rider can be lessened by the<br>
inbetween indicator portion front portion 32a inclined<br>
15 rearwardly upwardly and the left and right indicator portion<br>
front portions 32b, 32b.<br>
More specifically, the housing 32 has a curved shape,<br>
in which a so-called wind protection effect is high, such that<br>
the inbetween indicator portion front portion 32a is<br>
20 positioned at the foremost end centrally in the vehicle width<br>
direction and the left and right indicator portion front<br>
portions 32b, 32b are positioned outward in the vehicle width<br>
direction and rearward relative to the inbetween indicator<br>
portion front portion 32a. Thereby, the housing 32 functions<br>
25   as a visor to produce a high wind-pressure lessening effect<br>
14<br><br><br>
while being small in size. For example, in the case where the<br>
inbetween indicator portion front portion is dented rearwardly<br>
of the left and right indicator portion front portions, there<br>
is a fear that a travel wind flows concentratedly on a dented<br>
5 portion to be liable to strike directly against rider's head<br>
and face, by which the wind-pressure lessening effect cannot<br>
be adequately produced.<br>
Also, since the wind-pressure lessening effect is<br>
produced only by setting a configuration of the housing 32 so<br>
10 that the inbetween indicator portion front portion 32a<br>
projects forwardly of the left and right indicator portion<br>
front portions 32b, 32b, it is possible to avoid a problem of<br>
an increase in cost and restrictions on design as compared with<br>
the case where a visor is mounted as a separate part.<br>
15 According to the embodiment, since the inbetween<br>
indicator portion front portion 32a and the left and right<br>
indicator portion front portions 32b, 32b are formed to be made<br>
integral, it is possible to reduce the number of parts and<br>
manhour in assembly as compared with the case where the portions<br>
20   are formed separately.<br>
Also, since the inbetween indicator portion front<br>
portion 32a and the left and right indicator portion front<br>
portions 32b, 32b are made substantially the same in shape as<br>
viewed from laterally of a vehicle, it is possible to further<br>
25  heighten the wind-pressure lessening effect.<br>
15<br><br><br>
According to the embodiment/ since the left and right/<br>
front, outer peripheral walls 64a' of the upper housing 64 are<br>
caused to project obliquely rearwardly and upwardly of the<br>
outer peripheral wall 64a of the inbetween indicator portion,<br>
5   the left and right, front/ outer peripheral walls 64a'<br>
functions as a pent roof, so that it is possible to further<br>
heighten an outward appearance as a double meter and to heighten<br>
visibility of the speed and engine speed indicator portions<br>
17, 18 as viewed from a rider.<br>
10 According to the embodiment, since the bottom of the<br>
lower housing 63 is arranged to overlap the upper end of the<br>
headlight 15 as viewed from laterally of a vehicle, an opposite<br>
side is not seen through between the headlight 15 and the<br>
housing 32 as viewed from laterally of a vehicle, so that it<br>
15  is possible to prevent degradation in outward appearance.<br>
Also, since the recess 63e is formed on the bottom of<br>
the lower housing 63 so as to follow the upper surface of the<br>
headlight 15, an outward appearance as if the meter device 16<br>
is mounted on the headlight 15 is presented as viewed from<br>
20 laterally of a vehicle, so that it is possible to surely prevent<br>
an opposite side from being seen through. Also, since the<br>
front portion of the housing 32 is contiguous to the upper<br>
surface of the headlight 15 to be inclined rearwardly upward,<br>
it is possible to further heighten the wind-pressure lessening<br>
25   effect.<br>
16<br><br><br>
In addition, while the embodiment has been described with<br>
respect to the case where the headlight 15 is arranged below<br>
the meter device 16, different on-board parts, such as horn,<br>
storage box, etc., from a headlight may be arranged below the<br>
5  meter device in the invention.<br>
According to the embodiment, since the folded surfaces<br>
63f are formed on the lower edge of the lower housing 63 to<br>
extend rearwardly of a vehicle, the folded surfaces 63f can<br>
heighten the wind-pressure lessening effect and prevent an<br>
10   interior of the meter device 16 from being exposed outside.<br>
According to the embodiment, since the respective<br>
indicator portions 17 to 19 are covered by the one common lens<br>
61, it is possible to reduce the number of parts and manhour<br>
in assembly as compared with the case where the portions are<br>
15   covered by a plurality of lenses.<br>
Also, since the inbetween indicator lens portion 61c of<br>
the lens 61 is formed obliquely forwardly and downwardly of<br>
the left and right indicator lens portions 61a, 61b in a<br>
stepwise manner, the fuel reserve indicator portion 19 is<br>
20 positioned back from the speed and engine speed indicator<br>
portions 17, 18 whereby it is possible to obtain an outward<br>
appearance further like a double meter and to heighten the lens<br>
61 as a whole in stiffness.<br>
In addition, while the fuel reserve indicator portion<br>
25   19 is arranged between the speed and engine speed indicator<br>
17<br><br><br>
portions 17, 18 according to the embodiment, other indicator<br>
portions such as an engine temperature indicator portion, etc.<br>
may be provided or not in the invention.<br><br><br>
