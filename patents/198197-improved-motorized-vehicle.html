Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to motorized two wheelers commonly used for transport and utility purposes. In particular, the invention relates to motorized two wheelers with large wheels and a wide storage platform between the front suspension and the rider's seat. The proposed vehicle would have the advantages of safety and proper balance of conventional motorcycles and the storage and step-through mounting facility for the rider as that of conventional scooters.<br>
Background of Invention:<br>
Motorcycles constitute a variety of motorized two wheelers. Some of the key elements of the generic construction of the motorcycle include the fuel tank and engine mounted ahead of the rider's seat on the frame and the relatively large sized wheels on which the frame rides. This arrangement has the functional advantage of a stable ride due to the large size of the wheels and good distribution of the weight of engine and rider on the frame. The smoothness of ride on rough surfaces is improved by the ability to have a large stroke length for the suspension elements attaching the wheels to the frame and the larger size of the wheel itself. However, a disadvantage of this generic construction is that any provision to carry luggage and other such articles needs to be provided through utility boxes or platforms to be added to the frame at the side or rear. This involves loss of convenience in usage. While small storage spaces can be provided below the seat or in boxes fixed to the front handle bar or suspension or fuel tank, these are limited in size or functionality and can also disturb the even distribution of weight around the frame. The loss of convenience is essentially on account of the limited space that is available. It also requires extra procedures such as opening/closing boxes, locking of the load and such activities involved in such process of carrying luggage and other articles.<br>
A key reason for the above disadvantage is that given a certain wheel base for vehicle construction, the bulk of the wheel base distance is taken up in providing for the larger wheels and the engine mounting, leaving storage utility space as a secondary consideration.<br>
Another variety of two wheelers is the scooter, which essentially has small wheels. Some of the key elements of the generic construction of such scooters are the<br><br>
relatively smaller wheels, a foot level storage platform between the rider and the front suspension, which is an integral part of the vehicle frame, and a fuel tank and engine that are generally placed below or immediately behind the riders seat. This configuration has the functional advantage of a wide and well-spaced storage platform immediately in front of the rider, which is an integral built in part of the frame. Luggage and other such articles can be easily and conveniently placed, either in the platform itself or baskets and such storage devices built into the area. While additional storage spaces beneath the seat and in the body above the rear wheels etc can and are provided, the built in front platform gives a much larger and flexible storage space that can most conveniently be accessed. In addition, a further advantage is that the rider can mount the seat by stepping through the platform, unlike in a motorcycle, where mounting the seat requires a 'leg-over' maneuver.<br>
However, the basic disadvantage of such construction is the relative smaller size of the wheel itself, due to which the ability to drive smoothly on rough surfaces is reduced. This is due to the small size of the wheel and the relative small stroke length of suspension elements. A key reason for the above disadvantage is that given a certain wheel base for vehicle design, a substantial amount of the wheel base distance is taken up in providing for the built in foot level platform and the wheel sizes have to be proportionately reduced.<br>
Scooterettes, which are essentially smaller versions of the scooter, are available which are substantially in line with the generic construction of scooters. Some of these scooterette designs incorporate a larger wheel size relative to typical scooters. This however is at the direct expense of the length of the foot level storage platform. The reduction in platform size thereof also affects the utility of the platform itself as it is now limited in size. Free space after allowing for the riders feet to be placed in normal riding position is even more drastically reduced. The size of the engine is restricted in this prior art, if the wheels are to be made bigger and the proper distribution of the weight of the engine ahead of the rider's position is also difficult to achieve. Foot operated gears cannot also be incorporated conveniently in scooterettes.<br>
JP 4287782 discloses an under-bone type vehicle body frame provided with a monocoque-structure frame body extended toward the upper section of a rear<br><br>
wheel from the lower section of a seat provided at the rear of a main frame extended downward, a baggage storage chamber is provided below the seat on the frame body, a circular arc-shaped inner rear fender is arranged above the rear wheel and a battery is installed in a space surrounded by the rear wall of the baggage storage chamber and the front section of the inner rear fender. While this prior art did provide for motorized two wheeler having large wheels as that of a motorcycle with a storage space between the rider and the front suspension, the same had limitations in terms of less storage space as the storage space provided could not be of sufficient width to store items such as briefcase and the like. Moreover, the frame structure between the rider and the front suspension more or less linearly traverses the space between them limiting the storage space that is available or that which can be created there. In this case, therefore, the storage space available is restricted and similar to that of a motorcycle.<br>
US 4,915,188 provides a variety of motorcycle of the sitting type which is provided with a storage compartment of increased storage capacity beneath the vehicle seat while allowing the seat to be disposed at a relatively low level in order to permit the vehicle when in operating mode to have a low center of gravity. Reference to the construction of this prior art would reveal that to provide for a large storage space the same necessitated the shifting of the storage space under the seat and provision of the battery between the rider and the front suspension, which again blocked the desired step through mounting. The engine placed in series with the frame beneath the riders seat also increases the wheelbase of the vehicle.<br>
US 5,433,286 discloses yet further construction of mounted two wheeler which is again directed to provide enlarged storage space under the vehicle seat at the expense of provision of the fuel tank between the rider and the front suspension. This again had limitations in step-through mounting as well as effective utilization of space between the rider and front suspension. A storage platform as that available in scooters and two wheelers of small sized wheels is not possible.<br>
It would be apparent from the above basic varieties of two wheelers presently available that known motorized two wheelers with large wheels have limitations in provision of adequate storage space between the rider and front suspension and convenience of step-through mounting.    The conventional scooter form of the<br><br>
motorized two wheelers that do have some storage space between the rider and the front suspension essentially had limitations of smaller wheels and consequential drawbacks/disadvantages.<br>
The preceding discussion of the prior art is intended to present the invention in an appropriate technical context and allow its significance to be properly appreciated. Unless clearly indicated to the contrary, however, reference to any prior art in this specification should not be construed as an admission that such art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide improved motorized two-wheeler, which can effectively combine the advantages of large sized wheels, step-through comfortable mounting and open front storage platform.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to improvement in motorized two-wheelers which would provide benefits of large wheels for smooth ride and better weight distribution and at the same time provide for a convenient increased open luggage space/open front storage platform between the rider and the front suspension.<br>
Yet further object is directed to effectively combine the above improved feature in motorized two wheelers with improvement in engine and operative component layout to provide for further advantages and convenience to the user of such vehicles.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide improved motorized two-wheeler which can effectively combine the advantages of large sized wheels of motorized two-wheelers such as motorcycle and the step-through comfortable mounting and open front storage platform of conventional scooters and the like with an extended open storage platform there between the rider and front suspension, the vehicle further being adapted to accommodate/support foot operated gear and/or braking system.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The above disclosed motorized two wheeler of the present invention would provide a two wheeler vehicle that combine the benefits of large wheels for smooth ride and better weight distribution of vehicle elements, while substantially increasing the convenience of carrying luggage and such articles, beyond that available in prior art. This is achieved by providing a large and more functional built in open front storage platform as part of the vehicle construction while still retaining a large wheel size as that used in conventional motorcycle for any given wheel base specification. Additionally, the construction favours step-through mounting by rider as that of a conventional scooter while also enabling a foot operated gear/braking system to be used.<br>
By larger wheels is meant front and rear wheels larger than conventionally found in two wheelers like scooters, scooterettes and the like that provide for a foot level storage platform.<br><br>
The frame structure enables fitting of a front platform essentially above the engine and proceeding as a flat surface along with frame towards the vehicle handle bar, while simultaneously placing the fuel tank directly below the riders seat. The frame preferably consists of two tube members spaced laterally and proceeding downwards and rearwards from the front suspension towards the rider seat as shown in the drawing. Such 'double cradle' construction reduces the overall diameter of the frame members for a given load bearing strength. The angle of placement of the frame members increases the unhindered access to a large cross sectional area as seen from the side view. Both elements together substantially increases the front storage space.<br>
Importantly, also according to one embodiment the combined engine and gearbox systems are placed substantially beneath the front platform on the frame and hence it is possible to accommodate large wheels within the given wheel- base. This is due to the fact that unlike in a scooter type prior art layout where the platform and engine are placed in series, in the proposed new construction such components are placed one above the other and thus the total wheel-base distance occupied by the combination of these two elements is minimized, leaving the scope for larger wheels. The placement of the engine beneath the platform also enhances the weight distribution of the vehicle as compared to scooters and other close prior art as the bulk of the weight of the engine is placed between the rider and the front wheel.<br>
The front platform is essentially flat and wide along its full length, varying in width as it proceeds from the seat end to the handle bar end in a manner as to optimize the comfort of seating of the rider and provide maximum space for storage.<br>
In this manner a substantially improved storage front platform that is conveniently accessible for the rider can be provided, while still maintaining the large wheels and weight distribution essential for riding stability and comfort, within a given wheel base of a vehicle.<br>
According to another embodiment the engine layout is improved by a selective arrangement of engine parts along with the improved construction discussed above. Unlike a   conventional   engine   layout  where the engine cylinder head is<br><br>
placed to the forward end of the gearbox unit, in the proposed construction the engine cylinder is placed to the rear end of the gearbox unit. The crankshaft configuration and gears within the transmission unit are so arranged to provide motive power in the fonward direction. This modified construction enables the accommodation of larger engine cubic capacities without interfering with the open front storage platform area of the proposed new vehicle construction. It also retains the better weight distribution of the vehicle as compared to some of the other prior art as the bulk of the weight of the engine and gearbox unit are placed just ahead of the riders seating position.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the invention the motorized two wheeler of the invention can operatively provide foot operated gear and/or braking system. For the purpose the frame beneath the extended wide open storage platform in particularly the substantially horizontal part thereof may be adapted to accommodate/support such foot operated gear and/or braking system which may be attached to the frame. It is also possible that the motorized two wheelers of the invention comprise auto-gear system.<br>
The details of the invention its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary illustrations as per the accompanying figures wherein -<br>
Figure 1: illustrates in side view an embodiment of the improved motorized two wheelers in accordance with the present invention;<br>
Figure 2: illustrates top plan view of the improved motorized two wheelers in accordance with the present invention;<br>
Figure 3: illustrates another embodiment of the improved motorized two wheelers in accordance with the present invention;<br>
Figure 4: illustrates top plan view of the improved motorized two wheelers in accordance with the embodiment of the Figure 3.<br><br>
Reference is first invited to accompanying Figure 1, which illustrates an embodiment of the motorized two wheeler in accordance with the present invention. As illustrates in said figure, the two wheeler of the invention comprises a metal frame structure (MF) consisting of two laterally spaced frame members which are angularly disposed from the front suspension (FS) downwardly and the rearwardly and define a flat portion there between the front suspension (FS) and rider seat (S).<br>
The front end of the frame member (MF) joins pivot housing through which a front suspension (FS) system is connected to the frame in such a manner as to allow for the front suspension system to be steered through a handlebar attached to the same. The front suspension system in turn is supported with respect to the front wheel (FW) as is conventionally known.<br>
The rear end of the frame is connected to a seating system and to a pivot housing through which a swing arm (SA) housing the rear wheel (RW) is connected to the frame. The rear wheel and the swing arm are in turn also connected to the seating system through the rear suspension (RS). The engine (E) is connected to the rear wheel (RW) through a transmission system (TC).<br>
Footpegs for rider to rest his feet, control system to start engine and transmit motive power through the transmission system in order to move the vehicle and also other regular system for safe and efficient driving of the vehicle as commonly seen in any two wheelers are provided on the above frame.<br>
A flat platform (P) is attached to the frame (MF) above the engine (E) and gear box unit (GB) covering the length of the frame (MF) from beneath the rider seat to the pivot housing attaching front suspension to the frame. The platform varies in width from the seat end to the front end so as to simultaneously enable comfortable seating position of the rider while still being broad enough to enable luggage like a briefcase to be placed with full support to ensure stable transportation.<br>
As is also evident in said figure, the fuel tank is advantageously positioned beneath the rider seat and is thus provided in the secured location.<br><br>
Advantageously, the above discussed improved two-wheeler construction of the invention on one hand provides for a wide open platform between the rider and the front suspension to provide for a desirable storage space along with the provision for step-through mounting on the vehicle like that of a scooter and on the other hand provides for a two-wheeler with large wheels size normally seen in moped and motor cycle. Such large wheels provide for desired balance and safe riding on the vehicle.<br>
Importantly, the effective provision of frame structure provides for desired support platform to store the various articles such as suitcase, briefcase and the like. Also, the selective positioning of the engine and the gear box thereunder the plat form enables providing space for larger wheels to the vehicle to achieve advantages of such large wheels vis-a-vis the small wheels usually available in the scooter and the like.<br>
As would be clearly evident from the top plan view to figure 2, the motorcycle of the invention provides for the desired spacious platform to store the commodities and the step-through mounting on the vehicle. Also, the position of fuel tank (FT) rear suspension as well as the other components is clearly illustrated.<br>
Reference is invited to accompanying figure 3, which illustrates yet another embodiment of the improved two-wheeler in accordance with the invention. As would be evident from the said figure, according to this embodiment while the basic and essential features of the embodiment of figure 1 in terms of providing the spacious open front storage platform and the step-through mounting provision as well as the large sized wheels are maintained, in this embodiment the engine layout is varied. As would be evident in this embodiment, the engine layout is affected so as to have the engine cylinder (E) fitted at the rear end of the gearbox (GB). The crankshaft and the gear arrangements are connected to provide motive power to the fonward direction. This modified construction enables the accommodation of larger engine cubic capacities without interfering with the open front storage platform area of the proposed new vehicle construction. It also retains the better weight distribution of the vehicle as compared to some of the other prior art as the bulk of the weight of the engine and gearbox unit are placed just ahead of the riders seating position.<br><br>
As in case of the embodiment of figure 1, in this embodiment also the fuel tank is positioned under the rider seat. As also illustrated in figure 4, in this embodiment also, the advantages of wide spacious platform there between the rider and the front suspension provide for a comfortable storage space while retaining the desired large sized wheels of the two wheelers for better balance and equilibrium of the vehicle.<br>
Apart from the above-discussed feature of the two wheelers in accordance with the invention, it is possible that the above basic and essential advantages of the system can be incorporated in various other modifications, some of which are discussed hereunder:<br>
It is possible that instead of providing a fuel tank under the rider seat it can also be positioned behind the rider seat or beneath the platform there between the rider and the front suspension. Alternatively, it is also possible to fit fuel tank just ahead of the platform or on the front suspension system or in any such place except that the fuel tank cannot be placed between the flat portion of the front platform and the riders seat as this would affect the storage space.<br>
According to further embodiment it is also possible that engine and the gear box system used in the motorcycle are not entirely mounted stationary on the main frame, but hinged on the main frame at one end and itself serving the role of a swing arm on which the rear wheel is mounted. An engine and gearbox system can be used as a stressed member, which can replaces part of the frame.<br>
An engine with cylinder head/multiple cylinder heads can be placed either horizontally or other transversely to the axis length of the vehicle or any in a V-formation. It is also possible that the engine is cooled other than naturally through some additional cooling devices to improve the power or reduce the size of an engine in an advantageous manner.<br>
A frame consisting of a single tube of variable cross section or improved load bearing material can also be used instead of a twin laterally spaced frame members. A closed or open utility box or basket or such additional storage devices<br><br>
built into the front platform area can also be used as additional conveniences, but not interfering with the substantially open nature of the platform. The motive power for the vehicle is transmitted through the front wheel. The fuel of the vehicle used being hydrocarbon or electricity provided through a battery device.<br>
The above-described embodiments do not limit the invention and further changes or modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the claims appended.<br><br><br>
