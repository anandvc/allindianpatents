3IRALE OXAZOLE-ARYLPROPIONIC ACID DERIVATIVES AND THEIR USE AS PPAR AGONISTS<br>
The present invention is concerned with novel oxazole derivatives, their manufacture and their use as medicaments. In particular, the invention relates to compounds of the formula (I)<br>
wherein <br>
R1	is aryl or heteroaryl;<br>
R	is hydrogen, lower-alky!, or fluoro-lower-alkyl;<br>
R and R    independently from each other are hydrogen, hydroxy, halogen&gt; lower-alkyl, fluoro-lower-alkyl, hydroxy-lower-alkyl, lower-alkoxy-lower-alkyl, lower-alkoxy, fluoro-lower-alkoxy, hydroxy-lower-alkoxy, lower-alkoxy-lower-alkoxy, or lower-alkenyl,<br>
wherein at least one of R and R is not hydrogen;<br>
R5	is lower-alkoxy, fluoro-lower-alkoxy, lower-alkenyloxy, fluoro-lower-<br>
alkenyloxy, aryioxy, aryl-lower-alkoxy, or aryl-fluoro-lower-alkoxy;<br>
R6	is hydrogen or lower-alkyl;<br>
n	is 1,2 or 3;<br>
and phannaceutically acceptable salts and/or pharmaceutically acceptable esters thereof.<br><br>
Peroxisome Proliferate* Activated Receptors (PPAR's) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor super family, which are ligand-activated transcription factors regulating gene expression. Various subtypes thereof have been identified and cloned. These include PPARa, PPARJ3 (also known as PPAR5), and PPARy. There exist at least two major isoforms of PPARy. While PPARyl is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues, the longer isoform PPARy2 is almost exclusively found in adipocytes. In contrast, PPARa is predominantly expressed in the liver, kidney and heart. PPAR's modulate a variety of body responses including glucose- and lipid- homeostasis, cell differentiation, inflammatory responses and cardiovascular events.<br>
Diabetes is a disease in which a patient's ability to control glucose levels in blood is impaired, because he has partially lost the ability to respond properly to the action of insulin. In type II diabetes (T2D), often referred to as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), which afflicts 80-90 % of all diabetic patients in developed countries, the Isles of Langerhans in the pancreas still produce insulin. However, the target organs, mainly muscle, liver and adipose tissue, exhibit a profound resistance to insulin stimulation, and the body compensates by producing unphysiologically high levels of insulin. In later stage of disease, however, insulin secretion decreases due to exhaustion of the pancreas. In addition to that T2D is a metabolic-cardiovascular disease syndrome. Among the comorbidities associated with T2D are for example insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory atherosclerosis.<br>
Current first line treatment for diabetes generally involves low fat - and glucose - diet and exercise. However, compliance can be moderate and as the disease progresses, treatment with hypoglycemic drugs, e.g. sulfonylureas or metformin, becomes necessary. A promising new class of drugs has recently been introduced that resensitizes patients to their own insulin (insulin sensitizers), thereby reverting blood glucose and triglyceride levels to normal, and thus abolishing, or at least reducing, the requirement for exogenous<br>
^P\ A	T*H A<br>
insulin. Pioglitazone (Actos    ) and rosiglitazone (Avandia    ) belong to the thiazolidinediones (TZD) class of PPARy-agonists and were the first representatives who had been approved for NIDDM in several countries. These compounds, however, suffer from side effects including rare but severe liver toxicity (as seen with troglitazone), and they increase body weight in humans. Therefore, new, better and more efficacious drugs for the treatment of NIDDM are urgently needed. Recent studies provide evidence that a coagonism on PPARa and PPARY would result in compounds with enhanced therapeutic potential, i. e. such compounds should improve the lipid profile in addition to the normalization of glucose- and insulin-levels (Keller and Wahli: Trends Endocrin. Metab. 1993; 4:291-296, Macdonald and Lane: Current Biology Vol.5 pp.618-621 (1995)). Recent observations suggest furthermore that there is an independent PPARa mediated effect on<br><br>
insulin-sensitzation that could result secondary to the reduction in lipids (Guerre-Millo et al; J Biol Chem2000; 275: 16638-16642). Consequently, the incorporation of PPARa activity into PPARy agonists is expected to give rise to more efficacious drugs for the treatment and/or prevention of diabetes.<br>
The novel compounds of the present invention exceed the compounds known in the art, inasmuch as they bind to and activate both, PPARa and PPARy&gt; simultaneously and very efficiently. Therefore, these compounds combine the anti-glycemic effect of PPARy activation with the anti-dyslipidemic effect of PPARa activation. Consequently, plasma glucose and insulin are reduced (=insulin sensitization), triglycerides lowered and HDL cholesterol increased (^improved lipid profile). In addition, such compounds may also lower LDL cholesterol, decrease blood pressure and counteract inflammatory atherosclerosis. Since multiple facets of the T2D disease syndrome are addressed by PPARa and y coagonists, they are expected to have an enhanced therapeutic potential compared to the compounds already known in the art<br>
The compounds of the present invention further exhibit improved pharmacological properties compared to known compounds.<br>

Homochiral alpha-alkoxy-phenyl-propionic acid esters of formula 10 and free acids of formula 11 can be prepared according to the method depicted in scheme 1 or by analogous methods known in the art.<br>
The well known chiral auxiliary 2 [(S)-4-benzyl-oxazolidin-2-one] is condensed with an alkoxy-acetyl chloride 1 in the presence of a strong base like n-butyl lithium in an inert solvent like tetrahydrofuran at temperatures around -78 C to produce building block 3 (step a). The latter is then treated according to literature precedence [Tetrahedron<br><br>
Asymmetry (1999), 10,1353-1367] with dibutylboron-triflate and a tertiary amine like triethylamine in dichloromethane to generate the corresponding boron enolate, which is subsequently reacted at low temperatures with aldehydes 4 (prepared as outlined in scheme 5) resulting in compounds 5 (step b). In these aldol products 5, one of all four possible stereoisomers is strongly predominating (stereochemistry as indicated without rigorous proof with respect to the benzylic position). Compounds 5 are converted into phenolic intermediates 8 via a three step sequence encompassing: i) carefully controlled ester formation using only a minimal excess of alcoholate in the corresponding alcohol as solvent or in solvents like tetrahydrofuran or dioxane at temperatures ranging from -20°C to room temperature to give ester compounds 6 (step c); ii) removal of the benzylic hydroxy group in 6 with a reducing agent like e. g. triethylsilane in the presence of a Lewis acid, like boron-trifluoridej or a protic acid, like trifluoroacetic acid, in a suitable solvent like trifluoroacetic acid itself or dichloromethane between 0°C and 60 C to yield protected phenol compounds 7 (step d); iii) ensuing removal of the protecting group, e. g. a benzyl group, by standard technology, e. g. catalytic hydrogenation using hydrogen and a catalyst like palladium or by using dimethyl sulfide and boron trifluoride diethyl etherate in a solvent like dichloromethane between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent to give phenolic compounds 8 (step e); the order of the three reaction steps c, d, e is interchangeable, and catalytic hydrogenation can also be used for the simultaneous removal of the benzylic hydroxy function and a benzyl protecting group, preferably using palladium on charcoal as catalyst in the presence of an acid like oxalic acid in solvents like alcohols at temperatures around room temperature and a hydrogen pressure up to 100 bar.<br>
Aryl-oxazole compounds 9 (prepared as outlined in schemes 6 and 7) are condensed with phenols 8 according to well known procedures: if R represents a hydroxy group e. g. via Mifcuno&amp;u-reaction, with triphenylphosphine and di-tert-butyl-, diisopropyl- or diethyl-azodicarboxylate as reagents; this transformation is preferably carried out in a solvent like toluene, dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran at ambient temperature. Alternatively, if R represents a halide, mesylate or tosylate moiety, the aryl-oxazole compounds 9 can be reacted with phenols 8 in solvents like N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, acetone or methyl-ethyl ketone in the presence of a weak base like cesium or potassium carbonate at a temperature ranging from room temperature to 140 C, preferably around 50°C to yield ether compounds 10 (step f). Those can optionally be hydrolyzed according to standard procedures, e. g. by treatment with an alkali hydroxide like LiOH or NaOH in a polar solvent mixture like tetrahydrofuran/ethanol/water leading to carboxylic acids 11 (step g). If carefully controlled reaction conditions are applied as detailed in the experimental part, hardly any racemisation occurs during this reaction sequence. The optical purity of compounds 10 and 11 can be determined by chiral HPLC<br><br>
or by ^-NMR-spectroscopy in the presence of a chiral solvent like l-(9-anthryl)-2,2s2-trifluoro-ethanol and has been found higher than 95% in all cases exemplified.<br><br>
Aldehydes 1 (prepared as outlined in scheme 5) can be reacted with a Wittig salt 2 such as (l&gt;2-diethoxy-2-oxoethyl)triphenyl phosphonium chloride or (l,2-dimethoxy-2-oxoethyl)triphenyl phosphonium bromide in solvents like isopropanol, dichloromethane or tetrahydrofiiran or mixtures thereof in the presence of a base like potassium carbonate, 1,8-diazabicyclo [5.4.0] undec-7-ene (DBU) or 1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-guanidine, preferably between 0 C and the reflux temperature of the solvents, giving acrylic esters 3 as E and/or Z isomers (step a). Hydrogenation of acrylic esters 3 using palladium on charcoal as catalyst, preferably at room temperature and 1 atm. pressure of hydrogen, in solvents like<br><br>
methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetic acid, dichloromethane and mixtures thereof, affords racemic esters 7, provided that the protecting group can be cleaved reductively (step e).<br>
Alternatively, aldehydes 1 are reacted with the enolate of alkoxy-acetic acid esters 4 (preferably the lithium-enolate, prepared at -78 C by treatment of 4 with a strong, non-nucleophilic base like lithium diisopropylamide in an inert solvent like tetrahydrofuran),<br>
o<br>
preferably at temperatures around -78 C, in solvents like tetrahydrofuran giving the aldol product 5 as a mixture of diasteromers (step b). Removal of the benzylic hydroxy group as described above for the conversion of compounds 6 to compounds 7 in scheme 1 yields racemic esters 6 (step d); ensuing removal of the protecting group, e. g. a benzyl group, can then be performed by standard technology as described for the conversion of compounds 7 to compounds 8 in scheme 1 to give phenolic compounds 7 (step g). Catalytic hydrogenation can also be used to convert in one step benzyl protected hydroxy compounds 5 into phenolic compounds 7 (step f) as described for the conversion of compounds 6 to compounds 8 in scheme 1. The cleavage of the protective function can also be performed before the removal of the benzylic hydroxy group; in such a case, similar reaction conditions can be chosen for the removal of the benzylic hydroxy group as just described for the transformation of compounds 5.<br>
As an alternative method, compounds 5 can be treated with catalytic amounts of an acid like para toluene sulfonic acid in a solvent like benzene or toluene, preferably under conditions allowing the removal of the water formed (e. g. with a Dean Stark trap or in the presence of molecular sieves) at temperatures between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents to yield acrylic esters 3 (step c).<br>
The transformation of phenolic intermediates 7 into esters 9 and / or acids 10 can be performed in perfect analogy as described for homochiral phenolic intermediates 8 in scheme 1 (steps h and i).<br><br><br>
Homochiral alpha-alkoxy-phenyl-propionic acid esters of formula 6 and free acids of formula 7 can also be prepared according to a linear synthetic sequence depicted in scheme 3. Thus, reaction types already described in scheme 1 are used in a different order beginning with the condensation of aryl-oxazole synthons 1 (prepared as outlined in schemes 6 and 7) with phenols 2 (prepared as outlined in scheme 5) affording ether<br><br>
compounds 3 bearing an aldehyde moiety (step a). In case R3 and / or R4 contain a functional group, which might not be compatible with the following reaction steps&gt; e.g. R3 and / or R4 might be a phenolic OH-function, then a protective group should be attached to such a functional group, e. g. a tert-butly-dimethyl-silyl moiety. Such a protective group can then be removed at a suitable stage later in the reaction sequence.<br>
These ether compounds 3 are then reacted with the chiral synthons (compounds 3 in scheme 1) to form aldol-adducts 4 (step b). Removal of the benzylic hydroxy function in compounds 4 leads to compounds 5 (step c), which can be converted into the corresponding esters 6 (step d) or acids 7 (step e) as described for the analogous reactions )    in scheme 1 and 2, respectively.<br>
Optionally, ester compounds 6 can be hydrolysed to acids 7 (step f). The optical purity of compounds 6 and 7 can be determined by chiral HPLC or by lH-NMR-spectroscopy in the presence of a chiral solvent like l-(9-anthryl)-2,252-trifluoro-ethanol and has been found to be higher than 95% in all cases exemplified.<br><br><br><br><br>
Aryl-oxazole compounds 2 (prepared as outlined in schemes 6 and 7) are condensed with phenols 1 or aldehydes 6 (prepared as outlined in scheme 5) in perfect analogy as described for homochiral phenolic intermediates 8 and aryl-oxazole compounds 9 in scheme 1; thus ether compounds 3 or aldehydes 5 are obtained (step a). The former are then subjected to bromomethylation, e. g. by treatment with trioxane and HBr, preferably 62% aq. HBr, in an inert solvent, preferably dichloromethane, preferably at 0 C giving a highly reactive, often quite unstable electrophile 4 (step b). The electrophile 4 is suitable to alkylate an enolate of alkoxy-acetic acid esters 7 (R6 = lower alkyl), preferably the lithium-enolate, prepared at -78 C by treatment of 7 with a strong, non-nucleophilic base like lithium diisopropylamide in an inert solvent like tetrahydrofuran, to give esters 9 (step d). To increase the reactivity of the enolate nucleophile, the reaction is preferably performed<br><br>
in the presence of a cosolvent like hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) or 1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-teti^ydro-2(lH)-pyrimidinone(DMPU).<br>
Alternatively, aldehyde compounds 5, which are also available from ether intermediates 3 by Vilsmeier formylation or through formylation with dichloromethyl methyl ether in the presence of titanium tetrachloride, preferably in dichloromethane at<br>
a<br>
temperatures between -78 C and the reflux temperature of the solvent (step c), are reacted with an enolate of alkoxy-acetic acid esters 7 as described for the analogous reaction of compounds 1 and compounds 4 in scheme 2 giving the aldol products 8 as a mixture of diasteromers (step e). Removal of the benzylic hydroxy group in compounds 8 leads to racemic esters 9 (step f), as described for the analogous reactions in scheme 1, 2 and 3, respectively.<br>
Alternatively, aldehydes 5 can be reacted with a Wittig salt as described for the conversion of compounds 1 to compounds 3 in scheme 2 giving acrylic esters 10 as E and/or Z isomers (step g). Hydrogenation of acrylic esters 10 as described for the analogous reaction in scheme 2 leads to compounds 9 (step h). Hydrolysis of racemic ester compounds 9 can be performed in perfect analogy as described for homochiral compounds 10 in scheme 1 leading to carboxylic acids 11 (step i).<br>
Aldehydes 4 (scheme 1), aldehydes 1 (scheme 2), aldehydes 2 (scheme 3), and aldehydes 6 (scheme 4) are known or can be synthesized by methods known in the art. Examples for possible syntheses of these key intermediates are given in scheme 5.<br><br><br>
Known phenols 1 can be transformed into aldehydes 3 either by known formylation reactions such as e. g. the Vilsmeier formylation, by treatment with hexamethylene tetramine under acidic conditions, e. g. in the presence of sulfuric acid or, preferably, with trifluoroacetic acid as solvent between 0 C and the reflux temperature of trifluoroacetic acid, or by formylation with dichloromethyl methyl ether in the presence of titanium tetrachloride, preferably in dichloromethane at temperatures between -78 C and the reflux temperature of the solvent (step a); alternatively, a two step procedure might be used: introduction of a halogen atom into the para position, e.g. by use of N-bromo- or N-iodo-succinimide, e. g. in a mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid and tetrahydrofuran preferably at ambient temperature, followed by a metal halogen exchange, realized by treatment with an alkyl-lithium reagent like n-butyllithium, preferably at temperatures around -78 C&gt; and quenching the resulting aryl-Li with a formyl transfer reagent like N,N-dimethylformamide or N-formyl-piperidine (steps b and c). Alternatively, a carbonylation reaction can be used for the introduction of the formyl group in step c, e, g. by use of sodium formate, bis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(II) dichloride and CO gas in a solvent like NjN-dimethylformamide, preferably at temperatures around 100°C.<br><br><br>
Aldehydes 1 are commercially available or known. They are condensed with diketo-monoximes 2 according to literature precedence (Diels, O.; Riley, K.; Chem Ber (1915), 48&gt; 897) in the presence of a strong acid, typically HCl, in a polar solvent like AcOH to yield the oxazole-N-oxides 3 (step a). Subsequent treatment with POCI3 in dichloromethane under reflux provides the corresponding primary chlorides 4 (Goto, Y.; Yamazaki, ML; Hamana, M.; Chem Pharm Bull (1971), 19, 2050&gt; step b. The primary chlorides 4 are either used as such or transformed according to well established methods into the corresponding primary alcohols [e. g. with acetic acid in the presence of sodium iodide, potassium carbonate at elevated temperature and subsequent saponification of the acetate formed (e. g. with lithium hydroxide in ethanol / water at room temperature)]. Alternatively, the primary chlorides 4 are further elaborated via SN2-reaction with NaCN to give, via nitrils 5 (step c), exhaustive hydrolysis (step d) and reduction (step e), e. g. with borane in tetrahydrofuran, the building blocks 7. Hydroxy-ethyl compounds 7 or the hydroxymethyl compounds prepared form primary chlorides 4 correspond to or can be converted into compounds 9 (scheme 1), 8 (scheme 2), 1 (scheme 3) or 2 (scheme 4) e. g, by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane in the presence of a base like triethylamine preferably in a temperature range between -20°C and room temperature or by reaction with carbon tetrachloride or carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in<br><br>
solvents like tetrahydrofuran preferably in a temperature range between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents; thus yielding compounds 9 (scheme 1), 8 (scheme 2), 1 (scheme 3) or 2 (scheme 4) as methanesulfonates, chlorides or bromides, respectively.<br>
4-Chloromethyl-2-aryl or 2-heteroaryl-oxazoles 4 with R2 equal hydrogen are preferably prepared from the corresponding aryl or heteroaryl carboxamides and 1,3-dichloroacetone as described e. g. in Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. (2000), 10(17), 2041-2044.<br><br><br>
N-Acyl-glycine esters 1 are either commercially available, known, or can be prepared by standard operations of N-acylation. Mono-allylated esters 2 can easily be obtained by double deprotonation of 1 with a strong, non-nucleophilic base like LiHMDS in an aprotic<br>
a<br>
solvent like THF, typically at -78 C, followed by treatment with allyl bromide to produce selectively the C-alkylated products 2 (step a). Standard hydrolysis generates intermediate acids 3 (step b), which are then transformed, following well established literature precedence (J. Med. Chem. (1996), 39, 3897), into compounds 4 (step c). Ring-closure to the oxazole using trifluoro-acetic acid and trifluoro-acetic anhydride or .Burgess-reagent (methyl-N-triethylammoniosulfonyl-carbamate) generates key intermediates 5 (step d)&gt; which, finally, are elaborated via hydroboration to the target alcohols 6, e. g. with 9-BBN in THF and ensuing oxidative work-up with H2O2 and NaOH (step e). Alcohols 6 correspond to or can be converted into compounds 9 (scheme 1), 8 (scheme 2), 1 (scheme 3) or 2 (scheme 4) e. g. by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane in the presence of a base like triethylarnine preferably in a temperature range between -20°C and room temperature or by reaction with carbon tetrachloride or carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in solvents like tetrahydrofuran preferably in a temperature range between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents; thus yielding<br><br>
compounds 9 (scheme 1), 8 (scheme 2), 1 (scheme 3) or 2 (scheme 4) as methanesulfonates, chlorides or bromides, respectively.<br><br>
The following tests were carried out in order to determine the activity of the compounds of formula (I).<br>
Background information on the performed assays can be found in: Nichols JS et al. "Development of a scintillation proximity assay for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligand binding domain", (1998) Anal. Biochem. 257: 112-119.<br>
Full-length cDNA clones for human PPARa and mouse PPARY were obtained by RT-PCR from human adipose and mouse liver cRNA, respectively, cloned into plasmid vectors and verified by DNA sequencing. Bacterial and mammalian expression vectors were constructed to produce glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and Gal4 DNA binding domain proteins fused to the ligand binding domains (LBD) of PPARY (aa 174 to 476) and PPARa (aa 167 to 469). To accomplish this, the portions of the cloned sequences encoding the LBDs were amplified from the full-length clones by PCR and then subcloned into the plasmid vectors. Final clones were verified by DNA sequence analysis.<br>
Induction, expression, and purification of GST-LBD fusion proteins were performed in E. coli strain BL21(pLysS) cells by standard methods (Ref: Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley Press, edited by Ausubel et al.).<br>
Radioligand Bindine Assay<br>
PPARa receptor binding was assayed in TKE10 (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mM KC1,2mM EDTA, O.lmg/ml fatty acid free BSA and 10 mM DTT). For each 96 well 2.4 ug equivalent of GST-PPARa-LBD fusion protein and radioligand, e.g. 40000 dpm 2(S)-(2-benzoyl-phenylamino)-3-{4-[l,l-ditritio-2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethoxy]-phenyl}-propionic acid, were incubated in 100 ul volume at RT for 2 hrs. Bound ligand was removed from unbound ligand by solid phase separation using MultiScreen plates (Millipore) filled with 80 ul of SG25 according to the manufacturer's recommendations.<br>
PPARy receptor binding was assayed in TKE50 (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8,50 mM KCI, 2mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA and 10 mM DTT). For each 96 well reaction an 140 ng equivalent of GST-PPARy-LBD fusion protein was bound to 10 ug SPA beads (PharmaciaAmersham) in a final volume of 50 ul by shaking. The resulting slurry was incubated for lh at RT and centrifuged for 2 min at 1300g. The supernatant containing unbound protein was removed and the semidry pellet containig the recptor-coated beads was resolved in 50 ul of TKR For radioligand binding e.g. 10000 dpm 2(S)-(2-benzoyl-phenylamino)-3-{4-[l,l-ditritio-2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethoxy]-phenyl}-propionic acid in 50 ul were added, the reaction incubated at RT for lh and scintillation proximity counting performed. All binding assays were performed in 96 well plates and the amount of bound ligand measured on a Packard TopCount using OptiPlates (Packard).<br><br>
Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10*4 M unlabelled compound. Dose response curves were done in triplicates within a range of concentration from 10"10 M to 10*4 M.<br>
Luciferase Transcriptional Reporter Gene Assays<br>
Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21 ATCC CCL10) were grown in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS at 37°C in a 95%02:5%C02 atmosphere. Cells were seeded in 6 well plates at a density of 105 Cells/well and then transiently batch-transfected with either the pFA-PPARy-LBD or pFA-PPARa-LBD expression plasmids plus a reporter plasmid and an expression plasmid encoding the secretable form of alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) as a normalization control. Transfection was accomplished with the Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the suggested protocol. Six hours following transfection, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and seeded in 96 well plates at a density of 104 cells/well. After 24 hours to allow attachment of cells, the medium was removed and replaced with 100 ul of phenol red-free medium containing the test substances or control ligands (final DMSO concentration: 0.1%). Following incubation of the cells for 24 hours with substances, 50 ul of the supernatant was recovered and analyzed for SEAP activity (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The remainder of the supernatant was discarded, 50 ul PBS was added per well followed by one volume of Luciferase Constant-Light Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to lyse the cells and initiate the luciferase reaction. Luminescence for both SEAP and luciferase was measured in a Packard TopCount. Luciferase activity was normalized to the SEAP control and transcriptional activation in the presence of a test substance was expressed as fold-activation over cells incubated in the absence of the substance. EC50 values were, calculated using the XLfit program (ID Business Solutions Ltd. UK).<br>

The compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for enteral, parenteral or topical administration. They can be administered, for example, peroraEy, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or infusion solutions, or topically, e.g. in the form of ointments, creams or oils.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner which will be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable, into a galenical administration form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also organic carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers are, however, required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, liquid waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistency-improving agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula (I) can vary within wide limits depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 0.1 mg to about 1000 mg, especially about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg, comes into consideration. Depending on the dosage it is convenient to administer the daily dosage in several dosage units.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 0.05-500 mg, preferably 0.05-100 mg of a compound of formula (I).<br>
