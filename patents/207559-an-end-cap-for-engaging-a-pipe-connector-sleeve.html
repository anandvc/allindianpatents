Pipe connector<br>
The present invention relates to a pipe connector for pipes wound from double walled profiled plastic material strips, having a connector sleeve adapted to be placed onto the ends of the pipes to be connected.<br>
Pipe connectors of the kind mentioned above used for connecting two pipe ends together are generally known and are based on a multitude of connecting techniques such as e.g. connecting flanges by bolts, press fits, etc.<br>
In case of pipes made of double walled profiled plastic material strips a further problem emerges in addition to the connection as such: The pipe end which have been cut to length perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the pipe have end edges of which a part is open and of which a part is closed, because when being cut to size it can not be avoided that also chambers of the double walled basic profile are cut open (because of the double walled profiled strip which extends helically relative to the axis of the pipe). A treating of such pipe end edges is quite intricate and the result is often unsatisfactory. A pipe end which has not been treated gives rise to the danger of inflicting injuries.<br>
A pipe end which has not been treated features following drawbacks:<br>
- it is quite difficult or even impossible to mount the connector sleeve ( the outer circumference of pipes having massive walls the outer diameter is always chamfered for this purpose.<br><br>
-	it allows liquids to penetrate into the inner space of the profiled strip.<br>
-	the end of the pipe is not protected during a transporting or the assemling.<br>
A general object of the present invention to provide a pipe connector specifically for pipes which are not subject to pressures when in operation, which is of a simple design and can be mounted easily and which ensures a sufficiently leak - thight and stable pipe connection whithout necessitating a treating of the pipe ends which are to be connected together.<br>
This object is met by a pipe connector of the kind mentioned above by the features of the characterizing portion of claim 1.<br>
Specific embodiments of the subject of the invention are defined in the dependent claims.<br>
A pipe connector structured in accordance with the invention is specifically suitable for the forming of pipe bends when the connector sleeve is correspondingly designed.<br>
Below, the invention will be illustrated in detail with reference to on a embodiment illustrated in the drawings, whereby:<br>
Fig. 1 is a section through a pipe connector (upper half of the pipe), formed of elements in accordance with the invention; and<br>
Fig. 2 is a section through a modified design of a end cap ring.<br><br>
As illustrated in Fig. 1, the pipes 1, 2 consisting of wound double - wall profiled plastic material strips are to be connected together (The chambers of the pipes can be considerably larger or the wall thickness could be considerably smaller).<br>
The coupling or connecting, resp., takes place by means of a connector sleeve 3 which as such is known and which is to be set onto the pipe ends which are to be connected, which preferably are also made of a plastic material such as the pipes 1, 2, and which has at its center portion seen in longitudinal direction thereof bellows - like walls 31 such that it is specifically suitable for a forming ofrbitrary bends in the pipe line.<br>
Because a sufficient sealing is also demanded in case of pressure - less pipe lines, rubber seals of various shapes have been inserted at known connectors.<br>
At the solution in accordance with the invention end cap rings 4, 5 which can be clamped onto the pipe ends 1, 2 are slid thereupon, which grip by their U - shaped profile around the pipe ends 1, 2 and form thereby a protection against the sharp edged end edges of the pipes ( the sharp edges are produced by the lateral severing of the pipes 1, 2, whereby chambers and webs are cut which does not only gives rise to the danger of injury during their handling, but also forms an obstacle against a correct course of a flow).<br>
The end cap rings 4, 5 include at least at their cirumfer-ential surface which faces the connector sleeve 3 one or a plurality of sealing and clamping ribs 4f and 5f, resp., which are contacted by the sleeve in ist mounted state in a sealed manner.<br><br>
At the illustrated embodiment die inner circumferential surface of the end cap ring 4, 5 includes also circunferen-tially extending sealing and clamping ribs 4", 5", which theoretically would allow an inserting of the sleeve 3 into the inner space of the pipe ends.<br>
The connector sleeve 3 will, however, be generally set	out<br>
side onto the pipes 1,2 such that it is sufficient for	the<br>
end cap rings 4, 5 to include ribs 4', 5* at the outer	cir-<br>
cumferetial surface.<br>
The end cap rings 4, 5 can be designed as proper closed rings or may possibly be cut off from U - shaped profiled strips  (depending from the pipe diameter) and be set onto the pipe ends in such a form.<br>
Figure 2 of the drawings illustrate a section (profile) of a modification of a end cap ring 4, with an elongated outer circumferential surface which alone is equipped with ribs 4'.<br><br><br><br>
1.  Pipe connector for pipes wound from double walled profiled plastic material strips, having a connector sleeve adapted to be placed onto the ends of the pipes to be connected,<br>
characterized in that two end cap rings are foreseen, each adapted to be clamped onto one end of the respective pipes to be connected together and which are cut to length perpendicularly to their longitudinal axis, which end cap rings have a U-shaped cross - section and are adapted to grip around a respective end of a pipe, and include each at least at its circumferential surface facing the connector sleeve which is adapted to be placed onto the ends of the pipes at least one sealing and clamping rib extending along its circumference and adapted to contact a mounted connector sleeve.<br>
2.	Pipe connector according to claim 1, characterized in that the connector sleeve includes a longitudinal center portion which is structured as a flexibel pipe of a e.g. bellows - like design.<br>
3.	Pipe connector according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the end cap ring is formed of a material strip having a U - shaped cross - section and cut to a length<br>
depending from  the pipe diameter<br>
4.	Pipe connector according to one of the claims 1 to 3,<br>
characterized in that each end cap ring includes a plural<br>
ity of cirumferentially extending sealing and clamping<br>
rings.<br><br>
5.	The pipe connector according to one of the claims 1 to<br>
4, characterized in that the sealing and clamping rings are<br>
foreseen on the outer and the inner circumferential sur<br>
face, as well, of the end cap ring.<br>
6.	Pipe connector according to one of the claims 1 to 5,<br>
characterized in that a a plurality of sealing and clamping<br>
rings having a saw tooth - like shape and extending aside<br>
of each other is foreseen.<br>
7.	Pipe connector according to one of the claims 1 to 6,<br>
characterized in that the members of the connector consist<br>
of a plastic material or of rubber.<br><br></td>
