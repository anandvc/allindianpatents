				<td>The field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a toothbrush. More particularly, the present invention relates to an improved toothbrush capable of reaching the deep crevices in the oral cavity. In particular, the present invention relates to improved toothbrush capable of brushing of teeth in a highly sensitively manner with an object to clear all teeth, particularly, the four molar teeth which are normally inaccessible to conventional toothbrushes. Background of the invention<br>
Toothbrushes for brushing teeth have been known for decades. The basic toothbrush design consisted of a hard handle with a flat head portion and bristles fixed on the head portion. With growing awareness of dental hygiene, the need for better and improved quality toothbrushes also increased. There has been a constant need for a toothbrush, which could reach into the far corners of the mouth cavity to enable brushing of all surfaces of every teeth.<br>
Many attempts have been made in the prior art to devise a toothbrush capable of performing satisfactorily all of the above functions. However, most efforts in this regard have been directed toward different bristle configurations only. A few were directed to imparting some kind of flexibility to the handle.<br>
Accordingly, several new and better quality toothbrushes came into the market. Many of them were also subjects of several patents and designs.<br>
One of the earliest improved toothbrushes was Colgate Palmolive's "diamond" headed toothbrush. The head of the toothbrush was in the shape of a viper's head. It was felt that this unique design could reach far crevices of the mouth cavity.<br>
Subsequently, toothbrushes with flexible handles were developed. Some these toothbrushes had a "S" shaped bend at the neck portion thereof which would allow easy maneuverability in the mouth cavity without exerting too much pressure o the gums. Well know amongst these class of tooth brushes was SmithKline Beecham's "aquafresh" toothbrush. 'Other toothbrushes which were developed had flexible handles, rotating neck portion, differential bristles etc. Unfortunately, none of the toothbrushes known in the art<br>
could reach the far corners of the mouth, leaving the rear side of the four molars susceptive to various infections.<br>
Accordingly, there was always a constant need for an improved toothbrush which could reach the deepest crevices of the mouth cavity, particularly, the rear sides of the molars. It is extremely important that such toothbrush is extremely flexible and simple to use. Objects of the invention<br>
Accordingly, it is an important object of the inventions to provide a toothbrush having a unique construction, which permits easy access of the bristle to all the surfaces of the teeth of the user.<br>
It is another important object of the present invention to provide a toothbrush which is simple to use, easy to manufacture and universal in application. Summary of the invention<br>
The above and other objects of the invention are achieved by the improved toothbrush of the present invention which is provided with a unique construction which enables the user to brush the deepest crevices of the mouth cavity including the four molars.<br>
Accordingly,  the present invention provides  an improved toothbrush,  which comprises head, bristles mounted on the head and a glove connected to the head. The toothbrush of the invention is particularly characterised by the absence of any conventional handle. Detailed description<br>
The present invention relates to an improved toothbrush which is highly flexible in terms of construction, cost effective, easy to manufacture, universal in application and capable of reaching every part of the tooth to provide an extremely effective brushing.<br>
The toothbrush comprises of a head portion directly connected to a tubular glove portion. The toothbrush is characterised by the absence of any handle. The glove portion is in the form of a tubular sheath, dimensioned to fit a single finger, preferably the index finger of the user, although, it ca be dimensioned to fit any finger of the user.<br>
The tubular sheath or glove is preferably made of a flexible or an elastic material so that it is universal in application and can fit any finger of any person.<br>
The head may be of any conventional shape. Similarly, the bristles can be any conventional bristles.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the glove portion may be a full glove with sheaths for all the five fingers. The bristles may be mounted on sheath of any finger, index finger being most preferred.<br>
The improved toothbrush of the present invention is reusable like any conventional toothbrush. Its life will match that of any conventional toothbrush.<br>
The present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows the toothbrush of the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig 1, the toothbrush of the present invention is generally shown by 6 worn by the user 1. The toothbrush comprises head portion 5 having mounted thereon conventional bristles 3. The toothbrush head 5 extends into a tubular sheath or a body or a glove portion 2 which is open at the bottom thereof so that the user can slip his finger into the glove portion 2 so that the glove portion 2 fits snugly over the user's finger like a glove. The bottom of the glove portion may consist of a annular band which may be elastic in nature so that the toothbrush does not slip from the user's finger at the time of use.<br>
The shape of the head 5 may be completely conventional. The sheath or glove portion 2 may be made of any conventional elastic material although food grade and biodegradable rubber or plastics being most preferred.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the elasticity glove may have a tolerance of up to Â± 6mm while being used by the user.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the glove portion may be made of unfinished raw material of rubber, PVC, latex rubber, polyurethane, EVA, plastic or mixtures thereof.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the glove portion 2 may have diameter of from 2 to 50 mm, preferably 5 to 25mm when stretched.<br>
The tip of the glove portion may be thicker than the remaining portion by 2 to 8 mm for holding the bristles. The length of the tooth brush may be from 2 to 50 mm.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the head and glove are integral and made of the same material.<br>
It will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that various modifications of the toothbrush of the present invention may be made without departing from the inventive scope. What is described the drawings represents only a preferred embodiment.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A toothbrush comprising of a hollow head portion, bristles mounted on one side of the<br>
hollow head, said toothbrush being characterized by the absence of a handle, and said<br>
head portion extending into a tubular sheath so dimensioned to fit a finger of the user<br>
like a glove.<br>
2.	A toothbrush as claimed in claim 1 wherein the head is integral with the sheath.<br>
3.	A toothbrush as claimed in claim 1 wherein the head and tubular sheath are two piece unit connected to each other.<br>
4.	A toothbrush as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the tubular sheath or glove is made of a flexible or an elastic material so that it is universal in application and can fit any finger of any person.<br>
5.	A toothbrush as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the bristles comprise any conventional shape.<br>
6.	A toothbrush as claimed in any preceding claim wherein said sheath is made of conventional elastic material.<br>
7.	A toothbrush as claimed in claim 6 wherein said elastic material is a food grade and biodegradable rubber or plastics.<br>
8.	A toothbrush as claimed in claim 6 wherein said elastic material is selected from unfinished raw material of rubber, PVC, latex rubber, polyurethane, EVA, plastic or mixtures thereof.<br></td>
