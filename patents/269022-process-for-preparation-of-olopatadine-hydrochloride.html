COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10 and rulel3)<br><br><br><br><br>
1.	TITLE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
"PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF OLOPATADINE HYDROCHLORIDE"<br>
2.	APPLICANT:<br>
(a) NAME: INDOCO REMEDIES LIMITED.<br>
(b)NATIONALITY: Indian Company incorporated under the Indian Companies ACT, 1956<br>
(c) ADDRESS: Indoco   House, 166 C. S. T. Road, Santacruz (East), Mumbai - 400 098, Maharashtra, India.<br>
3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
The following specification describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
1 7 SEP 2009<br><br>
Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for preparation of 11 - (Z) - [3 -(Dimethylamino) propylidene] - 6, 11 - dihydrodibenz [b, e] oxepin -2 - yl - acetic acid and its pharmaceutical acceptable salts.<br>
Background and Prior Art:<br>
The compound 11 - (Z) - [3 - (Dimethylamino) propylidene] - 6, 11 - dihydrodibenz [b, e] oxepin -2 - yl - acetic acid hydrochloride of formula - I having International Non -Proprietary Name Olopatadine Hydrochloride<br><br>
Formula -1 is a selective histamine HI antagonist, which has mast cell stabilizing property and has been shown to affect the release of TNFa and various cytokines from conjuctival epithelial cell and is used for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.<br>
Olopatadine hydrochloride was disclosed as dibenz [b, e] oxepin derivative in US Patent No 5,116,863 (herein after '863') 'in 1992, assigned to Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd. The patent discloses the preparation of Olopatadine through Wittig reaction by reacting 11 - oxo - 6, 11 - Dihydrodibenz [b, e] oxepin - 2 - acetic acid (Formula - II) with 3 -dimethylaminopropyl triphenyl phosphonium bromide hydro bromide (Formula - III) in presence of base n - butyl lithium and solvent tetrahydrofuran. The crude compound is passed through column chromatography to isolate pure olopatadine. The reaction sequence is as shown in scheme -1,<br>
2<br><br><br><br><br>
Formula - II	Formula - III<br><br>
Formula -I<br><br>
Scheme -1<br>
In the above method,the preparation of olopatadine involves excess use of base and the Wittig reagent. The isolation of pure cis olopatadine employs the use of column chromatography. The final yield of the compound is low.<br>
Another method disclosed in '863' is use of Grignard reagent for the preparation of Olopatadine hydrochloride. In this reaction, 11 - oxo - 6, 11 - Dihydrodibenz [b, e] oxepin - 2 - acetic acid (Formula - II) is converted to corresponding amide of Formula -IV by reacting the acid with thionyl chloride followed by reaction with 2- amino - 2 -methyl propanol, which is cyclised to get corresponding oxazoline derivative (Formula -V). Grignard reaction of the oxazoline derivative with 3- dimethylaminopropyl magnesium chloride yields the intermediate ll-(3-Dimethylamino-propyl) - 2 - (4, 4-dimethyl-4, 5-dihydro-oxazol-2-ylmethyl) - 6, 11 - dihydrodibenz [b, e] oxepin-11-ol (Formula - VI), which on hydrolysis followed by dehydration with strong acid yields olopatadine (Formula -1). The reaction sequence is as per scheme - II.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Formula - IV<br><br><br><br>
Formula - VI<br><br>
Scheme - II<br>
The major disadvantages of the above process are the preparation of cyclised intermediate before Grignard reaction increasing the number of steps. Further, the isolation of pure compound employs the use of column chromatography.<br>
J. Med. Chem. 35, 2074, (1992) discloses the preparation of olopatadine HC1 as per the above scheme, wherein the separation of the Z / E diastereomer is disclosed. As per the disclosure, the diastereo selectivity of the dehydration step is poor and leads to the formation of predominantly undesired 'E' isomer.<br>
PCT application WO2006129781 discloses the preparation of olopatadine hydrochloride wherein Methyl 2-(4-(2-chlorobenzyloxy)phenyl)acetate is iodinated using iodine and silver sulfate to give methyl 2-(4-(2-chlorobenzyloxy)-3-iodophenyl)acetate; which is coupled with but-3-yn-l-ol in presence of Copper iodide and palladium catalyst results methyl 2-(4-(2-chlorobenzyIoxy)-3-(4-hydroxybut-I-ynyl)phenyI)acetate; which on palladium catalyzed cyclization yields methyl [(HZ)-ll-(3-hydroxypropylidene)-6,ll-dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-yl]acetate; which is converted to Olopatadine via mesylate salt followed by treatment with dimethylamine and basic hydrolysis.<br>
Another PCT application WO2007105234 discloses one pot process for the preparation of olopatadine hydrochloride using Grignard reaction. The compound 11 - oxo - 6, 11 -<br>
4<br><br>
Dihydrodibenz [b, e] oxepin - 2 -~ acetic acid is reacted with Grignard reagent of 1 - halo - 3 - dimethylamino propane which is heated with dilute hydrochloric acid (1:1) to get Olopatadine hydrochloride. The reaction sequence is as per scheme -III:<br><br>
Formula -1<br>
Scheme - III The drawback in the process is, longer time for Grignard reaction and lower yield of desired cis - olopatadine hydrochloride.<br>
Another PCT application No. WO2007119120 describes the preparation of olopatadine hydrochloride by employing Grignard reaction, wherein 11 - oxo - 6, 11 -Dihydrodibenz [b, e] oxepin - 2 - acetic acid is reacted with 3 - dimethylamino propyl magnesium chloride at 25 - 30Â°C for 15 hours. The work up is carried out by decomposition with ammonium chloride followed by treatment with hydrochloric acid to isolate olopatadine hydrochloride.<br>
The drawback in the process is longer time required during Grignard reaction and formation of olopatadine hydrochloride.<br>
The patent application JP2009114166 discloses the preparation of Olopatadine hydrochloride involving Grignard reaction, wherein tert-butyl ester of ll-oxo-6,11-dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-yl acetic acid (Formula - VIII) is reacted with 3 -dimethylaminopropylmagnesium chloride yields tert-butyl ester of 11-hydroxy-l l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-6,ll-dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-yl acetic acid (Formula - IX), which is decomposed by heating in presence of solvent and acid to give racemic<br>
5<br><br>
olopatadine of Formula - X. The compound of Formula - X obtained is isomerized by heating in presence of solvent and hydrochloric acid, with simultaneous removal of water yields required isomer Cis - Olopatadine hydrochloride of Formula - I. The reaction sequence is as shown in scheme - IV.<br><br><br>
Formula-1	Formla-X<br>
Scheme - IV<br>
The draw back of the process involves difficulty in preparation of tertiary butyl ester, isomerisation of racemic isomer to required cis olopatadine and azeotropical removal of water during isomerisation.<br>
Another PCT application WO2009044838 describes the preparation of olopatadine hydrochloride by dehydrating tertiary alkyl ester of ll-hydroxy-ll-(3-dimethylamino propyl)-6,ll-dihydrodibenz[b,e]-oxepin-2-yl-acetic acid of Formula - IX with a dehydrating agent such as acetic anhydride, propionic anhydride, butyric anhydride, anhydrous trifluoroacetic acid, anhydrous trichloroacetic acid, thionyl chloride, phosphorus oxychloride, phosphorous pentachloride, phosphorus trichloride to result into a mixture of (E,Z) - 11 - (3 - dimethylamino propylidene)- 6,1 l-dihydrodibenz[b,e] oxepin-2-yl-acetic acid alkyl ester (Formula - XI). The compound of Formula XI is further isomerised to Z-isomer from E-isomer in an organic solvent and hydrochloric acid where the reaction proceeds with deesterification reaction of compound of Formula XI<br>
6<br><br>
simultaneously. After isomerization cools the reaction solution to deposit crystals, and filtered the precipitated crystals, and compound of Formula -1 is isolated as acid addition salt corresponding to acid used. The reaction sequence is as shown in the following scheme - V.<br><br>
The drawback of the process mentioned is the use of dehydrating agents which are either costly or hazardous and industrially non - friendly to use on commercial scale.<br>
Japanese application JP2007031363 describes the preparation of olopatadine hydrochloride wherein 2 -(Bromomethyl) benzonitrile is reacted with methyl 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetate in presence of potassium carbonate followed by hydrolysis of the ester with sodium hydroxide to get methyl 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetate; which is cyclized with acetic anhydride results in 11 - oxo - 6, 11 - Dihydrodibenz [b, e] oxepin - 2 -acetic acid; Wittig reaction of the acid formed with (3-dimethylaminopropyl) triphenyl phosphonium bromide hydro bromide in presence of n-Butyl lithium gives Olopatadine; which is treated with hydrochloric acid and water to give Olopatadine hydrochloride. The major drawbacks of the prior art processes include:<br>
7<br><br>
â¢	Longer time required for Grignard reaction;<br>
â¢	Poor yield of the desired isomers;<br>
â¢	Need of isomerisation for getting increased yield of cis isomer;<br>
â¢	the use of column chromatography to isolate the pure form of the compound;<br>
â¢	Requires hazardous or costly chemicals for dehydration of the intermediate to get olopatadine.<br>
There remains a need for an improved process for preparing olopatadine and its pharmaceutically acceptable salt that requires less time for reaction, reduces number of steps in a convenient and cost efficient manner with the use of cost effective reagent which are industrial friendly and easy to handle at commercial scale.<br>
The present inventors have come out with an improved process which ameliorates the problems in the prior art for the preparation of olopatadine starting with the protected 11<br>
