THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>
[39 OF 1970]<br>

THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"CCR5 MODULATOR COMPOUNDS"<br>
PFIZER INC., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America o(235 East 42nd Street, New York, New York 10017, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The present invention relates to CCR5 modulator compounds.<br>
This invention relates to new chemical compounds. These compounds find particular but not exclusive use as pharmaceuticalsTespecially as CCR5 modulators.<br>
This invention also relates to formulations or dosage forms including these compounds, to use of these compounds in manufacture of pharmaceutical formulations or dosage forms and methods of treatment especially treatment of anti-inflammatory diseases and conditions and in the treatment and prevention of HIV-1 and genetically related retroviral infections.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be modulators, especially antagonists, of the activity of chemokine CCR5 receptors, particularly those which occur on the surfaces of certain cells within the human body. Modulators of CCR5 receptor may be useful in the treatment and prevention of various inflammatory diseases and conditions, and in the treatment and prevention of infection by HIV-1 and genetically related retroviruses.<br>
The name "chemokine", is a contraction of "chemotactic cytokines". The chemokines comprise a large family of proteins which have in common important structural features and which have the ability to attract leukocytes. As leukocyte chemotactic factors, chemokines play an indispensable role in the attraction of leukocytes to various tissues of the body, a process which is essential for both inflammation and the bodys response to infection. Because chemokines and their receptors are central to the pathophysiology of inflammatory<br>
and infectious diseases, agents which are active in modulating, preferably antagonizing, the activity of chemokines and their receptors, are useful in the therapeutic treatment of such<br>
inflammatory and infectious diseases.<br>
The chemokine receptor CCR5 is of particular importance in the context of treating inflammatory and infectious diseases. CCR5 is a receptor for chemokines, especially for the macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIP) designated MIP-1a and MIP-1b, and for a protein which is regulated upon activation and is normal I-cell exoressed and secreted (RANTES). The relationship between modulators, especially antagonists of CCR5 activity and therapeutic usefulness in treating inflammation and HIV infection, and the manner in which such a relationship may be demoristraled, is exolained in more detail further below.<br>
There is ongoing in the art a substantial investigation of different classes of modulators of chemokine receptor activity, especially that of the CCR5 chemokine receptor. A representative disclosure is Mills et al. WO 98/25617 relating to substituted aryl piperazines as modulators of chemokine receptor activity.  However, the compositions described therein are<br><br>
-2-<br>
not the same as, nor suggestive of those of the present invention.   Further disclosures are: WO 98/025605; WO 98/025604; WO 98/002151; WO 98/004554; and WO 97/024325.<br>
The present invention relates to compounds which may be conveniently considered to have four independently variable Regions, reading from the left-hand side to right-hand side of <br>
5   	  said compound: Region α. Region b. Region Y, and Region, of Formula (I):<br>
[Region α] - [Region b] - [Region y] - [Region 8]	(I)<br>
and pharmaceutical- acceptable salts and prodrug derivatives thereof.    The <br>
10     compounds of the present invention may be selective CCR5 receptor modulators and are non-peptidyl in structure.<br>
The compounds as exemplified by Formula (I) may contain one or more stereogenic centers and the present invention includes the recited compounds in both their separated and their unseparated forms. The separated forms can be obtained •by-eonventioRal-meansr.e.g.,<br>
15 	by asymmetric synthesis, by using high performance liquid chromatography employing a chirai stationary phase, or by chemical resolution via the formation of suitable salts or derivatives. It will be understood that the separate optically active forms of the compositions of the present invention, as well as reacemic mixtures thereof, will usually vary with respect to their biological properties because of the chirality-dependent conformation of the active site of an enzyme,<br>
20    receptor, efc.<br>
The description which follows provides details of the particular moieties which<br>
comprise each of said Region. In order to present said details in an orderly and space-saving<br>
fashion, each major group in each Region is set out with a single dash (" -"), and each<br>
successive subdivision within each said group is set out in turn with two, three, etc. dashes as<br>
25     required.<br>
In this specification and claims a reference to a range or class of groups for example (C1-C3)alkyl is to be understood as an exoress disclosure and reference of each member of the range or class, including isomers.<br>

The compounds of the present invention may be utilized in the form of acids, esters, or other chemical derivatives. It is also within the scope of the present invention to utilize those compounds in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts derived from various organic and inorganic acids and bases in accordance with procedures well known in the art 10 The exoression 'pharmaceutically acceptable salf as used herein is intended to mean an active ingredient comprising a compound of Formula (I) utilized in the form of a salt thereof, especially where said salt form confers on said active ingredient improved pharmacokinetic properties as compared to the free form of said active ingredient or other previously disclosed salt form.<br>
15	A pharmaceutically acceptable salt form of said active ingredient may also initially<br>
confer a desirable pharmacokinetic property on said active ingredient which it did not previously possess, and may even positively affect the pharmacodynamics of said active ingredient with respect to its therapeutic activity in the body.<br>
The pharmacokinetic properties of said active ingredient which may be favorably 20 affected include, e.g., the manner in which said active ingredient is transported across cell membranes, which in turn may directly and positively affect the absorption, distribution, biotransformation or excretion of said active ingredient While the route of administration of the pharmaceutical composition is important and various anatomical, physiological and pathological factors can critically affect bioavailability, the solubility of said active ingredient is<br>
25    usually dependent upon the character of the particular salt form thereof which it utilized. Further, an aqueous solution may provide the most rapid absorption of an active ingredient<br>
into the body of a patient being treated, while lipid solutions and suspensions, as well as solid<br><br>
-40-<br>
dosage forms, may result in less rapid absorption. Oral ingestion of said active ingredient is the most preferred route of administration for reasons of safety, convenience, and economy, but absorption of such an oral dosage form can be adversely affected by physical characteristics such as polarity, emesis caused by irritation of the gastrointestinal mucosa, 5 destruction by digestive enzymes and low pH, irregular absorption or propulsion in the presence of food or other drugs, and metabolism by enzymes of the mucosa, the intestinal flora, or the liver. Formulation of said active ingredient into different pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms may be effective in overcoming or alleviating one or more of the above-recited problems encountered with absorption of oral dosage forms.<br>
10	Weil-known pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to acetate,<br>
adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, besylate, bisulfate, butyrate, citrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, cyctopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecysulfate, ethanesuHbnate, fumarate, glucoheptanoate, gluconate, glycerophosphate, hemisuccinate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hippurate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-<br>

ammonium salts; alkali metal salts such as sodium and potassium; alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium; salts with organic bases such as dicydohexylamine, meglumine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, tris-(hydroxyrnethyl)-rnethylamine (tromethamine), and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine, etc.   Compounds of the present invention<br>
25 which comprise basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quatemized with such agents as (C1-C4) alkyl halides, e.g., methyl, ethyl, *so-propyl and tert-butyl chlorides, bromides and<br>
iodides; 6\{C1-C4) alkyl sulfate, e.g., dimethyl, diethyl and diamyl sulfates; (C10-Ci8) alkyl<br>
halides, e.g., decyi, dodecyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; and aryl-(Cf-C4) alkyl halides, e.g., benzyl chloride and phenethyl bromide. Such salts permit the 30     preparation of both water-soluble and oil-soluble compounds of the present invention.<br>
Among the above-recited pharmaceutical salts those which are preferred include, but<br>
are not limited to acetate, besylate, citrate, fumarate, gluconate, hemisuccinate, hippurate,<br>

Multiple salts forms are included within the scope of the present invention where a<br>
compound of the present invention contains more than one group capable of forming such<br>
pharmaceutical- acceptable salts. Examples of typical multiple salt forms include, but are not<br>
limited  to  bitartrate,  diacetate,  difumarate,   dimeglumine,   diphosphate,  disodium,   and<br>
5     trihydrochloride.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be administered alone but will generally be<br>
administered in admixture with one or more suitable pharmaceutical excipients, diluents or<br>
carriers  selected with  regard to  the  intended  route of administration  and  standard<br>
pharmaceutical practice.<br>
10	For example, the compounds of the formula (I) can be administered orally or<br>
sublingually in the form of tablets, capsules, ovules, elixirs, solutions or suspensions, which may contain flavouring or colouring agents, for immediate or controlled release applications.<br>
Such tablets may contain excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate and glycine, disintegrants such as 15 starch (preferably com, potato or tapioca starch), alginic acid and certain complex silicates, and granulation binders such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc may be included.<br>
Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin<br>
20    capsules.  Preferred exapients in this regard include lactose or milk sugar as well as high<br>
molecular weight polyethylene glycols.    For aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs, the<br>
compounds of the formula (I) may be combined with various sweetening or flavouring agents,<br>
colouring matter or dyes, with emulsifying and/or suspending agents and with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol and glycerin, and combinations thereof.<br>
25	The compounds of the formula (I) can also be injected parenterally, for example,<br>
intravenously, intraperitoneally, intrathecally, intraventricularly, intrastemally, intracranially, intramuscularly or subcutaneously, or they may be administered by infusion techniques. They are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example, enough salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic with blood. The aqueous<br>
30 solutions should be suitably buffered (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), if necessary. The preparation of suitable parenteral formulations under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art<br>
For oral and parenteral administration to human patients, the daily dosage level of the compounds of the formula (I) will usually be from 1 microgram/kg to 25 mg/kg (in single or 35    divided doses).<br><br>
-42-<br>
Thus tablets or capsules of the compound of the formula (I) may contain from 0.05 mg to 1.0 g of active compound for administration singly or two or more at a time, as appropriate. The physician in any event will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for any individual patient and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the 5 particular patient The above dosages are exemplary of the average case. There can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited and such are within the scope of this invention.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can also be administered intranasally or by inhalation and are conveniently delivered in the form of a dry powder inhaler or an aerosol spray<br>
10 presentation from a pressurised container or a nebuliser with the use of a suitable propellant, eg dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, a hydrofluoroalkane such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluorethane (HFA 134a), carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurised aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount The pressurised container or nebuliser may<br>
15 contain a solution or suspension of the active compound, eg using a mixture of ethanol and the propellant as the solvent, which may additional contain a lubricant eg sorbitan trioleate. Capsules and cartridges (made, for example, from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of a compound of the formula (I) and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
20	Aerosol or dry powder formulations are preferably arranged so that each metered<br>
dose or "puff contains from 20 ng to 20 mg of a compound of the formula (I) for delivery to the patient The overall daily dose with an aerosol will be in the range of from 20 ng to 20 mg which may be administered in a single dose or, more usually, in divided doses throughout the day.<br>
25	Alternatively, the compounds of the formula (I) can be administered in the form of a<br>
suppository or pessary, or they may be applied topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder. The compounds of the formula (I) may also be transdermal- administered by the use of a skin patch. They may also be administered by the ocular route, particularly for treating neurological disorders of the eye.<br>
30	For ophthalmic use, the compounds can be formulated as micronised suspensions in<br>
isotonic, pH adjusted, sterile saline, or, preferably, as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted, sterile saline, optionally in combination with a preservative such as benzyialkonium chloride. Alternatively, they may be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum.<br>
For application topically to the skin, the compounds of the formula (I) can be<br>
35     formulated as a suitable ointment containing the active compound suspended or dissolved in,<br>
for example, a mixture with one or more of the following: mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white<br><br>
-43-<br>
petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, they can be formulated as a suitable lotion or cream, suspended or dissolved in, for example, a mixture of one or more of the following: mineral oil, sorbrtan monostearate, a polyethylene glycol, liquid paraffin, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl 5     alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol. benyl alcohol and water.<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) are described herein as possessing biological activity such that they are able to modulate CCR5 chemokine receptor activity and consequent or associated pathogenic processes subsequently mediated by the CCR5 receptor and its ligands.   The exoression "modulate CCR5 chemokine receptor activity" as used herein is<br>
10 intended to refer to manipulation of the basic physiological processes and agencies which involve CCR5 chemokine receptors and their ligands. Included within the scope of this intended meaning are all types and subtypes of CCR5 receptors, in whatever tissues of a particular patient they are found, and in or on whatever components of the cells comprising those tissues they may be located. Most commonly, CCR5 receptors are situated on the cell<br>
15 membranes of particular cell types such as monocytes. CCR5 receptors participate in and define, along with various endogenous ligands to which they are naturally bound, signaling pathways which control important cellular and tissue functions by means of the influence which they exert on the movement of agents such as the chemokines, into and out of those cells and tissues.<br>
20	The basic functioning of the CCR5 receptors and their ligands may be modulated in a<br>
number of ways, and the scope of the present invention is not limited in that regard to any particular existing or hypothesized pathway or process. Thus, included within the intended meaning of modulation of CCR5 chemokine receptor activity, is the use of synthetically derived modulators introduced into a patient being treated, such as the compounds of<br>
25 Formula (I) described herein. These exogenous agents may modulate CCR5 receptor activity by such well known mechanisms as competitive binding in which the natural ligands are displaced and their inherent functions disrupted. However, the present invention is not limited to any such specific mechanism or mode of action. Thus, "modulation" as used herein is intended to encompass preferably antagonism, but also agonism, partial antagonism and/or<br>
30 partial agonism. Correspondingly, the term "therapeutically effective amount" means the amount of the subject compound that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought<br>
The term "patient" in this specification refers particularly to humans.   However the compounds, methods and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be used 35     in the treatment of animals.<br><br>
-44-<br>
Further included within the scope of the present invention are metabolites or residues of the compounds of Formula (I) which possess biological activity such that they are able to modulate CCR5 chemokine receptor activity and consequent or associated pathogenic processes subsequently mediated by the CCR5 receptor and its ligands. Once synthesized, 5 the CCR5 chemokine receptor modulating activities and specificities of the compounds of Formula (I) according to the present invention may be determined using in vitro and in vivo assays which are described in detail further below.<br>
The desirable biological activity of the compounds of Formula (I) may also be improved by appending thereto appropriate functionalities which enhance existing biological<br>
10 properties of the compound, improve the selectivity of the compound for the existing biological activities, or add to the existing biological activities further desirable biological activities. Such modifications are known in the art and include those which increase biological penetration into a given biological system, e.g., blood, the lymphatic system, and central nervous system; increase oral availability; increase solubility to allow administration by injection; alter<br>
15     metabolism; and alter the rate of excretion of the compound of Formula (I).<br>
The dosage and dose rate of the compounds of Formula (I) effective for treating or preventing diseases and conditions in a patient which are mediated by or associated with modulation of CCR5 chemokine receptor activity as described herein, as well as for favorably affecting the outcome thereof in said patient in accordance with the methods of treatment of<br>
20 the present invention comprising administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I), will depend on a variety of factors such as the nature of the active ingredient the size of the patient the goal of the treatment the nature of the pathology being treated, the specific pharmaceutical composition used, the concurrent treatments that the patient may be subject to, and the observations and conclusions of the<br>
25    treating physician.<br>
Generally, however, the effective therapeutic dose of a compound of Formula (I) which will be administered to a patient will be between about 10 ug (0.01 mg)/kg and about 60.0 mg/kg of body weight per day, preferably between about 100 ug (0.1 mg)/kg and about 10 mg/kg of body weight per day, more preferably between about 1.0 mg/kg and about 6.0 30 mg/kg of body weight per day, and most preferably between about 2.0 mg/kg and about 4.0 mg/kg of body weight per day of the active ingredient of Formula (I).<br>
Included within the scope of the present invention are embodiments comprising<br>
coadministration of, and compositions which contain, in addition to a compound of the present<br>
invention as active ingredient additional therapeutic agents and active ingredients.   Such<br>
35     multiple drug regimens, often referred to as combination therapy, may be used in the<br>
treatment and prevention of any of the diseases or conditions mediated by or associated with<br><br>
-45-<br>
CCR5 chemokine receptor modulation, particularly infection by human immunodeficiency virus, HIV. The use of such combinations of therapeutic agents is especially pertinent with respect to the treatment and prevention of infection and multiplication within a patient in need of treatment or one at risk of becoming such a patient, of the human immunodeficiency virus, 5 HIV, and related pathogenic retroviruses. The ability of such retroviral pathogens to evolve within a relatively short period of time into strains resistant to any monotherapy which has been administered to said patient is well known in the technical literature.<br>
In addition to the requirement of therapeutic efficacy which may necessitate the use of active agents in addition to the CCR5 chemokine receptor modulating compounds of Formula<br>
10 (I), there may be additional rationales which compel or highly recommend the use of combinations of drugs involving active ingredients which represent adjunct therapy, i.e., which complement and supplement the function performed by the CCR5 chemokine receptor modulating compounds of the present invention. Such supplementary therapeutic agents used for the purpose of auxiliary treatment include drugs which, instead of directly treating or<br>
15 preventing a disease or condition mediated by or associated with CCR5 chemokine receptor modulation, treat diseases or conditions which directly result from or indirectly accompany the basic or underlying CCR5 chemokine receptor modulated disease or condition. For example, where the basic CCR5 chemokine receptor modulated disease or condition is HIV infection and multiplication, it may be necessary or at least desirable to treat opportunistic infections,<br>
20 neoplasms, and other conditions which occur as the result of the immune-compromised state of the patient being treated. Other active agents may be used with the compounds of Formula (I), e.g., in order to provide immune stimulation or to treat pain and inflammation which accompany the initial and fundamental HIV infection.<br>
Thus, the methods of treatment and pharmaceutical compositions of the present<br>
25     invention may employ the compounds of Formula (I) in the form of monotherapy, but said<br>
methods and compositions may also be used in the form of multiple therapy in which one or<br>
more compounds of Formula (I) are coadministered in combination with one or more known<br>
therapeutic agents such as those described in detail further herein.<br>
The present invention also provides methods of treatment in which said 30 pharmaceutical compositions are administered to a patient Such methods relate to treating or preventing a disease or condition by modulating CCR5 chemokine receptor activity and consequent or associated pathogenic processes subsequently mediated by the CCR5 receptor and the active ligands with which it interacts or is bound. CCR5 and the other chemotactic cytokine, /.e., chemokine, receptors, play a key role in the control of a number of 35 processes which take place in the bodies of animals. Chemokine receptors, of which more than forty different species divided into four families are presently known to exist, are proteins<br><br>
-46-<br>
having a number of structural features in common, which act through chemical signaling. In the a family of chemokines, one amino acid (X) separates the first two cysteine residues, while in the p-chemokines the first two cysteine residues are adjacent to each other (C-C). Accordingly, these two families are identified as CXC and CC chemokines, respectively. The 5 chemokines bind specific cell-surface receptors belonging to the family of G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane-domain proteins called 'chemokine receptors", named in accordance with the class of chemokines which they bind, followed by "R" and a number. Thus, "CCR5" is a C-C chemokine receptor. See Horuk, Trends Pharm. Sci., 15,159-165 (1994) for further details. CCR5 thus belongs to the p-chemokine receptor family, which is currently known to 10     contain eight members, CCR1 through CCR8.<br>
The CC type of chemokine receptor interacts with various signaling proteins, including the monocyte chemoattractant proteins, MCP-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5; eotaxin-1; macrophage inflammatory proteins MIP-1a, and MIP-1p; and those regulated upon activation which are normal T-cell exoressed and secreted, RANTES. The CCR5 type of chemokine receptor in 15 particular is known to interact with MIP-1a, MIP-ip; and RANTES in monocytes, activated T cells, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells. These p-chemokines do not act on neutrophils but rather attract monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and lymphocytes with varying degrees of selectivity.<br>
The present invention relates to compounds of Formula (I) which are useful in treating 20 or preventing HIV infection, and to methods of treatment and pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds as the active ingredient it will be understood that the term "HIV* as used herein refers to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is the etiological agent of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), a disease that results in progressive destruction of the immune system and degeneration of the central and peripheral nervous 25 system. Several HIV replication inhibitors are currently used as therapeutic or prophylactic agents against AIDS, and numerous others are presently under investigation.<br>
In addition to cell-surface CD4, it has recently been shown that for entry into target cells, human immunodeficiency viruses require a chemokine receptor, CCR5 and CXCR-4 among others, as well as the virus's primary receptor CD4. The principal cofactor for entry 30 mediated by the envelope glycoproteins of primary macrophage-tropic strains of HIV-1 is CCR5, which as already mentioned, is a receptor for the p-chemokines RANTES, MIP-1a and MlP-1p. See Deng, et a/., Nature, 381, 661-666 (1996) for a further description of CCR5 mediated HIV entry.<br>
HIV attaches to the CD4 molecule on cells through a Region of its envelope protein,<br>
35     gp120, and gp120 is part of a multi-subunit complex, most likely a trimer of gp160, /.e., gp120<br>
+ gp41.  It is believed that the CD4 binding site on the gp120 of HIV interacts with the CD4<br><br>
-47-<br>
molecule on the cell surface, triggering conformational changes across the trimer, which allow it to bind to another cell-surface receptor, such as CCR5. This in turn enables gp41 to induce fusion with the cell membrane, and entry of the viral core into the cell. In addition, macrophage-tropic HIV and SIV envelope proteins have been shown to induce a signal 5 through CCR5 on CD4+ cells, which may enhance the replication of the virus. See Weissman, et al., Nature, 389, 981-985 (1997) for a description of this phenomenon. Further, it has been shown that a complex of gp120 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with CCR5 and inhibits the binding of the natural CCR5 ligands, as described in Wu, et at., Nature, 384, 179-183 (1996); and Trkola, et al., Nature, 384, 184-187 (1996).   It has further been<br>
10 demonstrated that B-chemokines and related molecules, e.g., (AOPJ-RANTES, prevent HIV fusion to the cell membrane and subsequent infection, both in vitro, as described in Dragic, et al., Nature, 381,667-673 (1996), and in animal models. Finally, absence of CCR5 appears to confer protection from HIV-1 infection, as described in Nature, 382, 668-669 (1996). In particular, an inherited frame-shifting mutation in the CCR5 gene, A32, has been shown to<br>
15 abolish functional exoression of the gene in vitro, and individuals homozygous for the mutation are apparently not susceptible to HIV infection, while at the same time they do not seem to be immuno-compromised by this variant Furthermore, those heterozygote individuals that have been infected by HIV progress more slowly to full-blown .clinical AIDS. In addition to validating the role of CCR5 in the infectious cycle of HIV, the above observations suggest that CCR5 is<br>
20    dispensable in the adult organism.<br>
Although most HIV-1 isolates studied to date utilize CCR5 or CXCR-4, at least nine other chemokine receptors, or structurally related molecules, have also been described as supporting HIV-1 env-mediated membrane fusion or viral entry in vitro. These include CCR2b, CC(3, BOB/GPR15, Bonzo/STRL33/TYMSTR, GPR1, CCR8, US28, V28/CX3CR1, 25 LTB-4, and APJ. There is good evidence that CC(3 can be used efficiently by a significant fraction of HIV-1 isolates in vitro, provided that this protein is over-exoressed in transfected<br>
cells. Nevertheless, consistent evidence indicates that anti-HIV drugs targeted to chemokine receptors may not be compromised by this variability. Indeed, the chemokines RANTES, MIP-<br>
1a, MIP-1B, SDF-1 have been shown to suppress replication of primary HIV isolates. A 30 derivative of RANTES, (AOP)-RANTES, is a sub-nanomolar antagonist of CCR5 function in monocytes. Monoclonal antibodies to CCR5 have been reported to block infection of cells by HIV in vitro. A small molecule antagonist of CXCR4, identified as AMD3100, has been reported to inhibit infection of susceptible cultures by CXCR4 dependent primary and lab-adapted HIV viruses while another small molecule called TAK 779 blocks entry of CCR5-tropic 35 strains (Baba. et al. PNAS, 96 (10), 5698-5703 (1999); In addition, the majority of primary strains from early and late disease stages utilize CCR5 exclusively or in addition to other chemokine receptors, indicating that CCR5 dependent infection may play an essential role in<br><br>
-48-<br>
the initiation and maintenance of productive HIV infection in a host Accordingly, an agent which blocks CCR5 in patients including mammals, and especially humans who possess normal chemokine receptors, can reasonably be exoected to prevent infection in healthy individuals and slow or halt viral progression in infected patients.<br>
5	Accordingly, the present invention is directed to the compounds of Formula (I) which<br>
inhibit the entry of human immunodeficiency virus into target cells and are therefore of value in the prevention and/or treatment of infection by HIV, as well as the prevention and/or treatment of the resulting acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Evidence can be produced which is probative of the fact that the compounds of Formula (I) described herein inhibit viral 10 entry through selective blockade of CCR5 dependent fusion. Consequently, the present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds of Formula (I) as an active ingredient as well as to the corresponding method of use of the compounds of Formula (I) as stand-alone agents, or in conjunction with other agents for the prevention and treatment of infection by HIV and resulting AIDS.<br>
15	The utility of the compounds of Formula (I) of the present invention as inhibitors of<br>
HIV infection may be demonstrated by any one or more methodologies known in the art, such as the HIV microculture assays described in Dimitrov ef a/., J. Clin. Microbiol. 28, 734-737 (1990)), and the pseudotyped HIV reporter assay described in Connor ef a/., Virology 206 (2) 935-44 (1995). In particular, specific compounds of Formula (I) disclosed herein as preferred<br>
20 embodiments are shown to inhibit p24 production following replication of laboratory-adapted and primary HIV strains in primary blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and clonal cell-lines known to support replication of both CCR5 and CXCR-4 tropic viruses, e.g., PM-1 and MOLT4-clone 8. It is also noted that only those viral strains known to use CCR5 are shown to be inhibited, whereas replication of CXCR-4 tropic viruses is shown to be unaffected, indicating that<br>
25 compounds of Formula (I) disclosed herein are able to prevent viral entry through selective blockade of CCR5 dependent fusion. Furthermore, compounds of Formula (I) are shown to inhibit entry of chimeric HIV reporter viruses pseudotyped with envelope from a CCR5 dependent strain (ADA). Finally, compounds of Formula (I) are shown to inhibit infection of primary cells by HIV isolated from infected patient blood. Further confirmation of this anti-HIV<br>
30     mechanism is provided by exoeriments outlined below.<br>
The ability of the compounds of Formula (I) to modulate chemokine receptor activity is demonstrated by methodology known in the art, such as the assay for CCR5 binding following<br>
procedures disclosed in Combadiere ef a/., J. Leukoc. Biol. 60, 147-52 (1996); and/or<br>
intracellular calcium mobilisation assays as described by the same authors.   Cell lines<br>
35     exoressing the receptor of interest include those naturally exoressing the receptor, such as<br>
PM-1, or IL-2 stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), or a cell engineered to exoress<br><br>
-49-<br>
a recombinant receptor, such as CHO, 300.19, L1.2 or HEK-293. In particular, the compounds of Formula (I) disclosed herein are shown to have activity in preventing binding of all known chemokine ligands to CCR5 in the above-mentioned binding assays. In addition, the compounds of Formula (I) disclosed herein are shown to prevent intracellular calcium 5 mobilization in response to endogenous agonists, which is consistent with their functioning as CCR5 antagonists. For the treatment of infection by HIV and the prevention and/or treatment of the resulting acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), compounds of Formula (I) which are shown to be antagonists are preferred to compounds of Formula (I) which are shown to be agonists.<br>
10	The present invention in one of its preferred embodiments is directed to the use of the<br>
compounds of Formula (I) disclosed herein for the prevention or treatment of infection by a retrovirus, in particular, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the treatment and/or delaying of the onset of consequent pathological conditions, including but no limited to AIDS. The exoressions "treating or preventing AIDS", and "preventing or treating infection by HIV" as<br>
15 used herein are intended to mean the treatment of a wide range of states of HIV infection: AIDS, ARC (AIDS related complex), both symptomatic and asymptomatic, and actual or potential exoosure to HIV. The quoted exoressions are not intended, however, to be limited to the recited treatments, but rather are contemplated to include all beneficial uses relating to conditions attributable to an AIDS causative agent For example, the compounds of Formula<br>
20 (I) are useful in treating infection by HIV after suspected past exoosure to HIV by, e.g., blood transfusion, organ transplant exchange of body fluids, sexual intercourse, bites, needle stick, or exoosure to patient blood. In addition, a compound of Formula (I) may be used for the prevention of infection by HIV and the prevention of AIDS, such as in pre-or post-coital prophylaxis or in the prevention of maternal transmission of the HIV virus to a fetus or a child,<br>
25 whether at the time of birth, during the period of nursing, or in any other manner as above-described.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a compound of Formula (I) may be used in a method of inhibiting the binding of human immunodeficiency virus to a chemokine receptor such as CCR5, which comprises contacting the target cell with a<br>
30 therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) which is effective to inhibit the binding of the virus to the chemokine receptor. The subject treated by these preferred methods of the present invention is a mammal, preferably a human, male or female, in whom modulation of chemokine receptor activity is desired and contemplated to be efficacious. As already pointed out, the term "modulation" as used herein is intended to encompass preferably<br>
35 antagonism, but also agonism, partial antagonism and/or partial agonism. Also, the exoression "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein is intended to mean the amount<br><br>
-50-<br>
of a compound of Formula (I) as disclosed herein that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, or animal, especially human that is being sought<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a compound of Formula (I) may be used to evaluate putative retrovirus, especially HIV, mutants considered to be <br>
5	 resistant to anti-HIV therapeutic agents, including the compounds of Formula (I) disclosed herein. Mutant viruses may be isolated from in vitro cultures by methods known in the art, but may also be isolated from in vivo animal infection models which have been disclosed in the art More significantly, mutant viruses may be isolated from samples of patients undergoing treatment, whether optimal or sub-optimal, comprising administration of a compound of<br>
10	 Formula (I), or any combination thereof with other known or to-be-discovered therapeutic agents. Such mutant viruses or their components, particularly their envelope proteins, may be used for several advantageous purposes, including but not limited to the following: (/) the evaluation and/or development of novel chemokine modulators or other agents having improved activity against such mutant viruses; and (//) the development of diagnostics capable<br>
15	 of assisting physicians or other clinicians in the choice of a therapeutic regimen and/or outcome prediction for a patient<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, compounds of Formula (I) disclosed herein are used as tools for determining the co-receptor affinity of retroviruses including HIV and SIV, or their components, especially their envelope proteins. This affinity<br>
20 	data can be used for several advantageous purposes, including but not limited to phenotyping a given viral population, e.g. prior to administration of anti-retroviral therapy. The affinity data may also be used to predict the progression and outcome of the infection by the virus population involved.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a compound of Formula (I)<br>
25     is used in the preparation and execution of screening assays for compounds which modulate<br>
the activity of chemokine, especially CCR5 receptors.  For example, compounds of Formula<br>
(I) as disclosed herein are useful for isolating receptor mutants, which can then be made into<br>
screening tools for the discovery of even more potent compounds, following procedures well<br>
known in the art   Furthermore, the compounds of Formula (I) are useful in establishing or<br>
30     characterizing the binding sites of other ligands, including compounds other than those of<br>
Formula (I) and viral envelope proteins, to chemokine receptors, e.g., by competitive inhibition.<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) are also useful for the evaluation of putative specific<br>
modulators of various chemokine receptors. As will be appreciated by the artisan, thorough<br>
evaluation of specific agonists and antagonists of the above-described chemokine receptors<br>
35     has been hampered by the lack of non-peptidyl, i.e., metabolically resistant compounds with<br><br>
-51-<br>
high binding affinity for these receptors. Thus, the compounds of Formula (I) are useful as products which may be commercially exoloited for these and other beneficial purposes.<br>
Included within the scope of the present invention are combinations of the compounds of Formula (I) with one or more therapeutic agents useful in the prevention or treatment of <br>
5	AIDS. For example, the compounds of the present invention may be effectively administered, whether at periods of pre-exoosure and/or post-exoosure to HIV, in combination with therapeutically effective amounts of known AIDS antivirals, immunomodulatory anti-infectives, or vaccines familiar to those skilled in the art It will be understood that the scope of such combinations which include the compounds of Formula (I) is not limited to the above-recited <br>
10	list, but includes as well any combination with another phannaceutically active agent which is useful for the prevention or treatment of HIV and AIDS.<br>
Preferred combinations of the present invention include simultaneous, or sequential treatments with a compound of Formula (I) and one or more inhibitors of HIV protease and/or inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase, preferably selected from the class of non-nucleoside<br>
15	 reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), including but not limited to nevirapine, delavirdine, and efavirenz; from among the nucleoside/nucleotide inhibitors, including but not limited to zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, lamivudine, abacavir, and adefovir dip'rvoxil; and from among the protease inhibitors, including but not limited to indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, nerfinavir, and amprenavir. Other agents useful in the above-described preferred<br>
20 	embodiment combinations of the present invention include current and to-be-discovered investigational drugs from any of the above classes of inhibitors, including but not limited to FTC, PMPA, fozivudine tidoxil, taMraline, S-1153, MKC-442, MSC-204, MSH-372, DMP450, PNU-140690, ABT-378, and KNI-764. There is also included within the scope of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, combinations of a compound of Formula (I) together<br>
25	 with a supplementary therapeutic agent used for the purpose of auxiliary treatment, wherein said supplementary therapeutic agent comprises one or more members independently selected from the group consisting of proliferation inhibitors, e.g., hydroxyurea; immunomodulators, e.g., sargramostim, and various forms of interteron or interteron derivatives; fusion inhibitors, e.g., AMD3100, T-20, PRO-542, AD-349, BB-10010 and other<br>
30 	chemokine receptor agonists/antagonists; integrase inhibitors, e.g., AR177; RNaseH inhibitors; inhibitors of viral transcription and RNA replication; and other agents that inhibit viral infection or improve the condition or outcome of HIV-infected individuals through different mechanisms.<br>
Preferred methods of treatment of the present invention for the prevention of HIV<br>
35     infection, or treatment of aviremic and asymptomatic subjects potentially or effectively infected<br>
with HIV, include but are not limited to administration of a member independently selected<br><br>
-52-<br>
from the group consisting of. (/) a compound within the scope of Formula (I) as disclosed herein; (ii) one NNRTI in addition to a compound of (/); (Hi) two NRTI in addition to a compound of (i); (iv) one NRTI in addition to the combination of (ii); and (v) a compound selected from the class of protease inhibitors used in place of an NRTI in combinations (iii) <br>
5    	and (iv).<br>
The preferred methods of the present invention for therapy of HIV-infected individuals with detectable viremia or abnormally low CD4 counts further include as a member to be selected: (w) treatment according to (/) above in addition to the standard recommended initial regimens for the therapy of established HIV infections, e.g., as described in Bartiett, J. G.,<br>
10 	1998 Medical management of HIV infection", Johns Hopkins University publishers, ISBN 0-9244-2809-0. Such standard regimens include but are not limited to an agent from the class of protease inhibitors in combination with two NRTIs; and (vii) a standard recommended initial regimens for the therapy of established HIV infections, e.g., as described in Bartiett, J. G., "1998 Medical management of HIV infection", Johns Hopkins University publishers, ISBN 0-<br>
15	 9244-2809-0), where either the protease inhibitor component or one or both of the NRTIs is/are replaced by a compound within the scope of Formula (I) as disclosed herein.<br>
The preferred methods of the present invention for therapy of HIV-infected individuals that have failed antiviral therapy further include as a member to be selected: (w7/) treatment according to (/) above, in addition to the standard recommended regimens for the therapy of<br>
20 such patients, e.g., as described in Bartiett, J. G., '1998 Medical management of HIV infection", Johns Hopkins University publishers, ISBN 0-9244-2809-0); and (ix) a standard recommended initial regimens for the therapy of patients who have failed antiretroviral therapy, e.g., as described in Bartiett, J. G., "1998 Medical management of HIV infection", Johns Hopkins University publishers, ISBN 0-9244-2809-0), where either one of the protease<br>
25 	inhibitor components, or one or both of the NRTIs is/are replaced by a compound within the scope of Formula (I) as disclosed herein.<br>
In the above-described preferred embodiment combinations of the present invention, the compound of Formula (I) and other therapeutic active agents may be administered in terms of dosage forms either separately or in conjunction with each other, and in terms of their<br>
30 	time of administration, either serially or simultaneously. Thus, the administration of one component agent may be prior to, concurrent with, or subsequent to the administration of the other component agent(s).<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) may be administered in accordance with a regimen of<br>
1 to 4 times per day, preferably once or twice per day. The specific dose level and frequency<br>
35    of dosage for any particular patient may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors<br>
including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of<br><br>
-53-<br><br>
10<br><br>
action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of<br>
administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and<br>
the host undergoing therapy. In particular, however, the treatment of retroviral infections, and more particularly HIV, may be guided by genotyping and phenotyping the virus in the course of  5 or prior to the initiation of administration of the therapeutic agent. In this way, it is possible to optimise dosing regimens and efficacy when administering a compound of Formula (I) for the prevention or treatment of infection by a retrovirus, in particular, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).<br>
The compounds of this invention may be used for treatment of respiratory disorders, including: adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), bronchitis, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, asthma, emphysema, rhinitis and chronic sinusitis.<br>
The invention is further described by means of examples, but not in any limitative sense.<br>

10	Compounds of the general formula IV may be prepared by the reductive alkylation of<br>
an appropriate amine of formula V, with an aldehyde, of formula III.

15	Subsequent removal of the nitrogen protecting group may be achieved using<br>
trifluoroacetic add or hydrochloric acid in a solvent such as dioxan or dichloromethane at room temperature for from 1 to 60 hours to provide the compound of formula VI. Compounds of general formula VII may be prepared by coupling the amine of formula VI with an acid (Z = OH) or add derivative (eg, Z = CI) of formula VIII using conventional amide bond forming<br>
20	 techniques. For example, the acid VIII may be activated using a carbodiimtde such as 3-(3-dimethylamino-1-propyl)-1-€thylcarbodiimide, optionally in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate. These reactions may be performed in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane, optionally in the presence of a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine or N-ethyldiisopropyiamine at about room temperature.<br>
25	Alternatively an acyl chloride of formula VIII, may be reacted with an amine of formula<br>
VI in the presence of a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine or N-ethyldiisopropylamine in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane at room temperature for about 3 hours.<br>
In a further variation a compound of formula VII, may be formed in a "one-pot procedure" by deprotection of a compound of formula IV, and coupling the resultant amine of<br>

10 	optionally in the presence of an alcohol, such as methanol, at 1 atm. H2 pressure and room temperature) or by transition metal catalysed reduction (at reflux temperature in the presence of an excess of iron powder in acetic acid, or iron powder and calcium chloride in aqueous ethanol, or an excess of tin chloride dihydrate in ethanol, for about 2 hours).

15	formula XV (Pi is for example, BOC or Benzyl) with a carboxyiic acid of formula (R5CH2COOH). The coupling may be achieved using conventional amide bond forming techniques, as described in synthesis I. For example the acid may be activated using a carbodiimide such as 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyI)-3-ethyl-carbodiimide in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane, in the presence of a<br>
20 	tertiary amine such as diisopropylamine. Compounds of formula V may be prepared by nitrogen deprotection of compounds of formula XXIII, using techniques previously described above.  Compounds of formula VI may be prepared by the reductive amination of amines of formula V with an appropriate aldehyde of formula III. The reaction may be carried out in the presence of a suitable reducing agent (eg sodium triacetoxyborohydride) in a protic solvent<br><br>

For example, treatment with sodium hydroxide in a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and water at room temperature. Compounds of formula XXVII may be prepared by coupling the acid of formula XXVI with an appropriate oxime, followed by in-situ cyclocondensation. For example, the   acid    may   be   activated   using   a   fluorinating   agent    such   as   N.N.N'.N'-<br>
