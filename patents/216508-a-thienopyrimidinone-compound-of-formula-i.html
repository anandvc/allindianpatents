wherein L*, L, L1 and L2 are leaving groups and R1, R2, R3, G, Q and at are as definec above or are protected derivatives thereof, and optionally after a), b), c), d), e) or f) converting the compound of the formula (1) into a further compound of formula (1) and/or forming a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt or solvate thereof.<br>
In particular in the compound of formula (15), Q is methylene.<br>
Suitable leaving groups for La, L, L1 and L2 would be apparent to a skilled chemist, depending upon the nature of the reaction being conducted. Examples of leaving grou may include halo, such as chloro, bromo or iodo, anhydride groups such as acetic anhydride, esters such as mesylate or tosylate, and hydroxy.<br>
The reaction between a compound of the formula (10) and compound G-H, where G is has a nitrogen attached to the hydrogen atom shown, is conveniently carried out under amide bond forming reaction conditions, in which case, L" is hydroxy. For example, in the presence of a coupling agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or l-ethyI-3-(3-dimethylarainopropyl)ethylcarbodiimide. Optionally a base may be used, preferably an organic base such as triethylamine. Suitable solvents are usually aprotic solvents, for example diraethylformamide or chlorinated solvents, for example dichloromethane or trichloromethane. Additionally, a compound which catalyses this type of amide bond fonnation reaction, such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazoie, may be present. The temperature is usually in the range of about -30Â°C to about 60Â°C, preferably at or near ambient temperature.<br>
The reaction between a compound of the formula (11) and at is normally carried out in the presence of a strong base such as sodium hydride. Suitable leaving groups include halo, in particular bromo. The reaction is conveniently carried out in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, preferably at or around ambient temperature. In some circumstances, for example when Ar contains ring nitrogen atoms which do not need to be deprotonated, a milder base, such as sodium bicarbonate can be used. This reaction is conveniently used to prepare compounds in which Ar is linked through a ring nitrogen atom. However, it is possible to use this process to prepare a compound in which Ar is linked via a ring carbon atom. This can be achieved by using a strong base and a zinc salt such as zinc chloride and optionally sodium iodide as a catalyst.<br>
A compound of formula (12) can be reduced to the corresponding methylene compound using standard reduction conditions for hydroxy groups known in the art. For example, it can be protonated with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid and reduced with a trialkylsilane. Alternatively the hydroxy group could be converted to a stronger leaving group, such as mesylate or tosylate and the resulting compound hydrogenated in a non-hydroxylic solvent, preferably tetrahydrofuran, with a catalyst such as palladium on charcoal, in a temperature range of 0Â°C to 50Â°C, preferably at ambient temperature and a pressure of 1 to 5 bar.<br>
The group -Q-Ar is conveniently formed on a compound of formula (11) or (13) by primary ring -synthesis. Here, reference is made to the compendiums 'The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds' B.C. Taylor and A. Weissberger (published by John Wiley and Sons) and 'Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry', A.R Katritzky and C. W Rees (published by Pergamon Press (Elsevier)). For examples of the preparation of a compound of the formula (1) wherein Ar is 3,5-dimethylpyrazoI-4-yl or 1,3,5-trimethylpyrazol-4-yl see examples 11 and 12 in the specific examples.<br>
A compound of the formula (14) may be reacted with a compound of formula R'-L2 in the presence of a mild base, such as potassium carbonate, in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as DMF, in a temperature range of ambient temperature to 170Â°C.<br>
Particular examples of L1 is formula (15) is chlorine.<br>
A compound of the formula (1) may be prepared from another compound of formula (1) by chemical modification. For example a compound of the formula (1) wherein Q is methylene can be oxidised to a compound of the formula (1) wherein Q is carbonyl. A preferred oxidising agent is 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-l,4-ben2oquinone (DDQ) in an inert organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. In some circumstances oxidation can be effected by exposure of the methylene compound to air.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, compounds of formula (I) where Ar is a group of sub-formula (i) above, wherein R12 is hydrogen can be converted to compounds of formula (i) where R12 is other than hydrogen by reaction with a compound of formula (XV)<br>
R12&gt;-L" (XV)<br>
whereR12' is a group R12 other than hydrogen, and L" is a leaving group such as halo, and in particular brorno. Such a reaction may be carried out in an organic solvent such as acetonitrile or dioxan. If necessary the reaction can be carried out in the presence of a base such as an alkali metal carbonate, for instance potassium carbonate, and in the presence of a catalyst such as a copper salt like copper iodide. Also if necessary, the reaction can be effected under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen.<br>

Pharmacological Data<br>
Inhibition of PMA/ionomycin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation<br>
The assay for PMA/ionomycin-stimulated PBMC proliferation was performed in 96-well flat-bottomed microtitre plates. Compounds were prepared as lOmM stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide. A 50-fold dilution of this was prepared in RPMI and serial dilutions were prepared from this solution. lOul of the 50-fold diluted stock, or dilutions of it, were added to the well to give concentrations in the assay starting at 9.5uM and going down. Into each well was placed 1 x 105 PBMC, prepared from human peripheral blood from a single donor, in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 1 0% human serum, 2mM glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (0.5ng/ml final concentration) and ionomycin (500ng/ml final concentration) were added to these cells in supplemented RPMI1640 medium (as above) so that the final volume of the assay was 0.2ml. The cells were incubated at 37Â°C in a humidified atmosphere at 5% carbon dioxide for 72 hours. 3H-Thymidine (0.5uâ‚¬i) was added for the final 6 hours of the incubation. The level of radioactivity incorporated by the cells was then determined and this is a measure of proliferation.<br>
The compounds of the Examples were found to exhibit an IAso value of less than 1 x 1 0"6 M in the above test. In the following specific examples, Examples 5, 7 and 8 had a PIAjo of 7.4, 8.6 and 9.0 respectively in the above test.<br><br>
