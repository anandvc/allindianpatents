DESCRIPTION<br>
1,3-DIIODOHYDANTOIN COMPOUND AND PRODUCTION METHOD THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to 1,3-diiodohydantoin<br>
compound and production method thereof. More in detail, the<br>
present invention relates to improvement in long-term<br>
stability of the aforementioned compounds.<br>
Background Art<br>
1, 3-Diiodohydantoin compound (hereinafter, also simply<br>
referred to as "DIH compound") has been widely used as a<br>
sensitive material for photography or the like, or an iodizing<br>
agent or an oxidizing agent in production processes for medical<br>
drugs, agricultural chemicals, chemicals, or the like.<br>
As a method for producing the DIH compounds, for example,<br>
a technique, in which a hydantoin compound is reacted with<br>
iodine monochloride in the presence of a base in an aqueous<br>
solution, has been disclosed (see, for example,<br>
JP-A-2002-30072 and J. Org. Chem., 30(1965), 1101-1104).<br>
Such technique has advantageous points that it is simple and<br>
highly efficient as well as easy post-treatments such as<br>
purification and waste liquid treatment.<br>
Here, in the specification of JP-A-2002-30072, a<br>
technique for purifying a DIH compound from reaction system<br>
has been described as "deposited crystal is collected by<br>
filtration, and the resultant crystal is dried under a reduced<br>
pressure".<br>
Meanwhile, the DIH compounds produced by the techniques<br>
or the like described in the above literatures are usually<br>
stored until the time to be used for the above applications.<br><br>
2<br>
As such a storage method, for example, a technique, in which<br>
the compound is stored under a reduced pressure and nitrogen<br>
atmosphere in a darkplace, hasbeen disclosed (see, forexample,<br>
J. Labelled Compd. Radiopharm., 44-12(2001), 815-830).<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
However, there is no description about the DIH compounds<br>
superior in easy handling and good storage stability, it has<br>
been revealed from the study by the present inventors that<br>
there is a problem that the aforementioned DIH compound tends<br>
to decrease in purity when the DIH compound is produced by<br>
the production method described in the above literature or<br>
when the DIH compound is stored by a common method as described<br>
in the above literature . Such decrease in purity is considered<br>
to be caused by release of iodine atom as an elementary<br>
substance (I2) of iodine by decomposition of the iodine<br>
compound. The release of I2 could cause problems such as<br>
coloration or corrosion of material or equipment by<br>
aforementioned I2 and increased risk for operators.<br>
Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a means to inhibit release of I2 in production or storage of<br>
DIH compound, and thereby solve decrease in purity of DIH<br>
compound or various problems caused by I2.<br>
In order to solve the above problems, the present<br>
inventors intensively searched for a cause of release of I2<br>
in production or storage of DIH compound.<br>
As a result, the present inventors have found that DIH<br>
compound is unstable in a state of wet body, in which a certain<br>
level of liquid component such as water and an organic solvent<br>
is contained, even at an ordinary temperature, and that this<br>
instability causes the aforementioned release of I2. In<br>
addition, the release of I2 from such wet body becomes more<br><br>
3<br>
remarkable under a comparatively high temperature condition.<br>
Therefore, based on the above knowledge, the present<br>
inventors have found that the decomposition of DIH compound<br>
and the release of I2 accompanying thereto can be prevented<br>
by controlling drying means in production of DIH compound<br>
and temperature condition in storage thereof, and finally<br>
accomplished the present invention.<br>
That is, the present invention provides a production<br>
method for 1,3-diiodohydantoin compound comprising a step<br>
to provide a wet body containing a 1,3-diiodohydantoin<br>
compound, and (1) a step to dry the wet body by contacting<br>
the wet body with heated gas or (2) a step to lyophilize the<br>
wet body.<br>
In addition, the present invention provides a storage<br>
method for a 1, 3-diiodohydantoin compound comprising a step<br>
to store a 1,3-diiodohydantoin compound under a temperature<br>
condition of 15°C or lower.<br>
Further, the present invention provides a<br>
1, 3-diiodohydantoin compound wherein content of released I2<br>
is 1% by mass or less.<br>
According to the present invention, release of I2 during<br>
production or storage of DIH compound can be inhibited, and<br>
thereby decrease in purity of DIH compound or incidence of<br>
various problems caused by I2 can be prevented.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
A first aspect of the present invention relates to a<br>
production method for DIH compound. Specifically, firstly<br>
a wet body containing a DIH compound is provided. Subsequently,<br>
(1) the wet body is dried by contacting the wet body with<br>
a heated gas, or (2) the wet body is lyophilized.<br>
As described above, it has been found out that DIH compound<br><br>
4<br>
is unstable in a state of wet body, in which a certain level<br>
of liquid component is contained therein, and the instability<br>
causes the release of I2 as described above. In addition,<br>
it has been also found out that such release of I2 becomes<br>
remarkable under a comparatively higher temperature condition .<br>
In the present invention, a method to inhibit effectively<br>
this release of I2 is provided.<br>
Incidentally, although mechanism of the release of I2<br>
in production or storage of DIH compound has not been<br>
necessarily clarified, a mechanism based on decomposition<br>
of the DIH compound has been presumed. However, suchmechanism<br>
is only a presumption, and even if the release of I2 occurs<br>
via another mechanism, the technical scope of the present<br>
invention is not affected at all.<br>
Hereinafter, the production method of the first aspect<br>
of the present invention will be explained in detail.<br>
Firstly, the first step in the production method of the<br>
first aspect of the present invention, that is, the step in<br>
which a wet body containing a DIH compound is provided will<br>
be described.<br>
In the present invention, "DIH compound" means a compound<br>
represented by the following chemical formula (I):<br>
[Formula 1]<br><br>
(wherein R1 and R2 are each independently a hydrogen atom or<br>
a Ci-C6 alkyl group).<br>
Way of procurement for the wet body containing a DIH<br>
compound is not particularly limited. The wet body containing<br><br>
5<br>
a DIH compound may be used by synthesizing according to the<br>
well known technique (e.g. the technique described in the<br>
aforementioned JP-A-2002-30072) or may be used by purchasing<br>
a commercially available product. As a technique to prepare<br>
the wet body containing a DIH compound by oneself, for example,<br>
the technique shown below can be used. However, the following<br>
preparation method is only an example, and it is needless<br>
to say that "wet body containing a DIH compound" prepared<br>
by a technique other than the following mode may be used.<br>
In the present invention, the DIH compound (Chemical<br>
Formula (I)) is prepared, for example, by reacting a hydantoin<br>
compound (Chemical Formula (II)) with iodine monochloride<br>
in the presence of a base in an aqueous solution, as shown<br>
in the following Chemical Reaction Scheme 1.<br>
[Formula 2]<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above.<br>
In order to prepare the DIH compound according to the<br>
Chemical Reaction Scheme 1, firstly a hydantoin compound<br>
represented by the Chemical Formula (II), which is used as<br>
a raw material, is provided.<br>
[Formula 3]<br><br><br>
6<br>
wherein R1 and Rz are as defined above.<br>
As described above, R1 and R2 is each a hydrogen atom<br>
or a Ci-C6 alkyl group. R1 and R2 may be same or different<br>
from each other. In view of yield in the synthesis reaction<br>
and easiness in handling, R1 and R2 are preferably identic-al-<br>
to each other. The alkyl group may be linear, branched or<br>
cyclic. Number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group is 1 to<br>
6, preferably 1 to 2, and more preferably one. Specific<br>
example of the alkyl group includes methyl group, ethyl group,<br>
propyl group, isopropyl group, butyl group, isobutyl group,<br>
s-butyl group, t-butyl group, pentyl group, isopentyl group,<br>
neopentyl group, hexyl group, and the like. An alkyl group<br>
other than these may also be used. Among them, preferably<br>
both of R1 and R2 are methyl groups, from the viewpoints of<br>
industrially moderate price and easy availability.<br>
Way of procurement for the hydantoin compound (II) is<br>
not particularly limited. The hydantoin compound may be used<br>
by synthesizing according to the well known technique or may<br>
be used by purchasing a commercially available hydantoin<br>
compound.<br>
Iodine monochloride is a compound represented by the<br>
chemical formula of "IC1", and highly reactive due to<br>
containing iodine of (oxidation number + 1) , and used in various<br>
synthetic reactions as an iodizing agent.<br>
Way of procurement for iodine monochloride (IC1) is also<br>
not particularly limited. Iodine monochloride may be used<br>
by synthesizing according to the well known technique or may<br>
be used by purchasing commercially available iodine<br>
monochloride. Incidentally, as a technique to synthesize<br>
iodine monochloride by oneself, for example, a technique is<br>
exemplified, in which chlorine is passed over iodine, then<br>
liquefied and distilled. It is needless to say that iodine<br><br>
7<br>
monochloride synthesized by other technique may also be used.<br>
The reaction of a hydantoin compound and iodine<br>
monochloride is carried out in the presence of a base. This<br>
base acts as a catalyst in the reaction system containing<br>
a hydantoin compound and iodine monochloride.<br>
Specific mode of the base is not particularly limited,<br>
and a base which commonly used in such synthetic reaction<br>
can be similarly used. An example of the base includes, for<br>
example, hydroxides, carbonate salts and the like of alkali<br>
metals / alkaline earth metals such as sodium hydroxide,<br>
potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen<br>
carbonate, potassium carbonate, potassiumhydrogen carbonate,<br>
and the like. It should be noted that these bases may be used<br>
alone or in combination of two or more kinds.<br>
The above reaction is carried out in an aqueous solution,<br>
but a solvent other than water may be included therein. For<br>
example, amide type solvents and ester type solvents can be<br>
included.<br>
Compounding ratio of each component in the above reaction<br>
is not particularly limited, and conventionally known<br>
knowledge (in particular, aforementioned JP-A-2002-30072)<br>
can be referred to as appropriate.<br>
After completion of the above reaction, components other<br>
than DIH compound are removed from the reaction system. By<br>
this operation, a solution of DIH compound can be obtained.<br>
Subsequently, most of the solvent contained in the solution<br>
is removed. By this operation, a "wet body containing a DIH<br>
compound" can be prepared. However, the step in which solvent<br>
is removed, may be carried out before removing the components<br>
other than the DIH compound.<br>
The technique to remove the components other than DIH<br>
compound is not particularly limited, and, for example, a<br><br>
8<br>
technique such as filtration, recrystallization and<br>
extraction, and combination thereof can be exemplified.<br>
Other technique may also be used.<br>
In addition, the technique to remove most of the solvent<br>
from the- solution containing DIH compound.-is also not<br>
particularly limited, and, for example, a technique such as<br>
filtration, centrifugal separation and decantation, and<br>
combination thereof can be exemplified. Other technique may<br>
also be used.<br>
In this regard, the "wet body containing a DIH compound"<br>
to be provided in this step is composed of a DIH compound,<br>
a solvent, and in some case a small amount of impurity, but<br>
content of the solvent in the wet body is not particularly<br>
limited. As an example, content of solvent is around 8 to<br>
30% by mass to total amount of the wet body. More solvent<br>
may be contained in the wet body, but too high content of<br>
the solvent could result in prolonged drying time leading<br>
to rise of production cost.<br>
Hereinafter, characteristic steps in the production<br>
method of the present invention will be explained.<br>
As described above, in the production method of the<br>
present invention, regarding the resultant "wet body<br>
containing a DIH compound", (1) the wet body is dried by<br>
contacting the wet body with a heated gas, or (2) the wet<br>
body is lyophilized.<br>
Firstly, the technique (1) is explained in detail.<br>
In the technique (1), the "wet body containing a DIH<br>
compound" prepared in the above is dried by contacting the<br>
wet body with a heated gas. Namely, in the technique (1),<br>
so called "fluidized drying" is employed.<br>
Conventionally, as a technique to dry the wet body<br>
containing a DIH compound, an industrially common drying<br><br>
9<br>
method had been employed. Specifically, drying method by<br>
heating under reduced pressure, e.g. using a conical dryer,<br>
drying method by heating under ordinary pressure, e.g. using<br>
a plate column dryer, and the like had been employed. However,<br>
the-present inventors have found out that a part of the wet .<br>
body containing a DIH compound decomposes and I2 is released<br>
by these methods. Specifically, when a wet body of a DIH<br>
compound (5,5-dimethyl body) containing 2 to 15% of water<br>
is heated at 40 °C for 3 hours, 4 to 6% of the compound is<br>
decomposed to release I2 . Also, when the wet body is similarly<br>
heatedat 70°C for 3 hours, 9 to 30% of the compound is decomposed.<br>
As a result, such problems as decrease in purity of DIH compound,<br>
and coloration or corrosion of material or equipment by<br>
released I2, and increased risk for operators could occur.<br>
On the contrary, according to the technique as described<br>
above, the release of I2, which had conventionally been a<br>
problem in drying a wet body, can be inhibited to the minimum.<br>
In this regard, although mechanism, by which a difference<br>
in levels of released I2 arises between the conventional drying<br>
technique and the drying technique of the present invention,<br>
has not been perfectly clarified, it is considered that the<br>
DIH compound which is instable to heat may decompose because<br>
the wet body is exposed at a high temperature condition over<br>
a long period of time in such unit of several hours in the<br>
conventional drying technique. Consequently, according to<br>
the production method of the present invention, not only the<br>
release of I2 in production of DIH compound can be inhibited<br>
to the minimum, but also heating time can be reduced and rapid<br>
production is enabled, and this can contribute to reduction<br>
in production cost. However, the technical scope of the<br>
present invention should be determined based on the<br>
description in the claims, and the technical scope is not<br><br>
10<br>
affected by the mechanism.<br>
Specif ic mode of the f luidized drying is not particularly<br>
limited, and conventionally well known knowledge in the<br>
synthesis field of chemical compounds can be referred to as<br>
appropriate. Hereinafter, preferable mode in the fluidized<br>
drying is exemplified. However, fluidized drying is not<br>
limited only to the following mode.<br>
In the present invention, "heated gas" means a gas having<br>
a temperature level at which a wet body containing a DIH<br>
compound can be dried by contacting with the wet body. The<br>
heated gas is preferably a gas which does not react with the<br>
DIH compound. Specific kind of the heated gas includes, for<br>
example, nitrogen gas, argon gas, helium gas, air gas, and<br>
mixed gas thereof, but kind of the heated gas is not limited<br>
to them. As the heated gas, air gas is preferably used.<br>
Temperature of the heated gas in contact with<br>
aforementioned wet body is not particularly limited, and can<br>
be decided taking physical properties of the DIH compound<br>
to be prepared and general knowledge in fluidized drying into<br>
consideration comprehensively. However, temperature of the<br>
heated gas is preferably 20 to 200°C, more preferably 40 to<br>
170°C, and furthers more preferably 90 to 130°C. Too low<br>
temperature of the heated gas requires prolonged drying time<br>
as a result of insufficient amount of heat, or could fail<br>
to dry up to a desired liquid content. On the contrary, too<br>
high temperature of the heated gas could give rise to<br>
deterioration (decomposition andmelting) of the DIH compound<br>
due to overheating.<br>
Flow rate of the heated gas in contact with aforementioned<br>
wet body is also not particularly limited, but preferably<br>
O.ltolO.O m/sec, more preferably 0.3to5.0 m/sec, and further<br>
more preferably 0.5 to 3.0 m/sec. Too low flow rate of the<br><br>
11<br>
heated gas requires prolonged drying time as a result of<br>
insufficient contact of the heated gas with the whole wet<br>
body, or could fail to dry up to a desired liquid content.<br>
On the contrary, too high flow rate of the heated gas could<br>
make collection of the-wet body difficult because of-excessive .<br>
scattering of the wet body.<br>
Next, the technique (2) is explained in detail.<br>
In the technique (2), the "wet body containing a DIH<br>
compound" provided as described above is lyophilized. By such<br>
technique, the release of ±2, which had conventionally been<br>
a problem in drying of the wet body, can also be inhibited<br>
to the minimum. In this regard, mechanism by which the<br>
conventional problem is solved by employing lyophilization<br>
is presumed to be similar to the case of the aforementioned<br>
fluidized drying.<br>
Thus, the techniques (1) and (2) are the same in the<br>
point to inhibit the release of I2 in drying the wet body to<br>
the minimum.<br>
"Lyophilization" is also referred to as lyophilize, and<br>
a technique in which a wet body is dried by freezing quickly<br>
the wet body at a temperature of the freezing point or below,<br>
and removing a solvent of the frozen body by sublimation by<br>
reducing pressure to a level of the vapor pressure of the<br>
solvent or below.<br>
Specific mode of the lyophilization is not particularly<br>
limited, and conventionally well known knowledge in the<br>
synthesis field of chemical compounds can be referred to as<br>
appropriate. Hereinafter, a preferable mode in the<br>
lyophilization is exemplified. However, the lyophilization<br>
is not limited to the following mode.<br>
Firstly, a wet body containing a DIH compound is cooled<br>
down quickly to a prescribed temperature. By this operation,<br><br>
12<br>
the aforementioned wet body is frozen. Temperature to be<br>
attained by the quick cooling is not particularly limited,<br>
but the wet body may be cooled down to preferably -196 to<br>
0°C, and more preferably -100 to -20°C.<br>
After that, the frozen body is placed in a reducedpressure .<br>
In this case, pressure condition is not particularly limited,<br>
and pressure may be reduced to a level which is necessary<br>
to remove a solvent contained in the wet body. As an example,<br>
pressure may be reduced to around 10tol,500Pa, and preferably<br>
100 to 700 Pa.<br>
When the wet body is driedby the technique (2) , preferably<br>
a solvent is further added to the "wet body containing a DIH<br>
compound" provided as described above to prepare a wet body<br>
in a slurry state, then the resultant wet body in a slurry<br>
state is lyophilized by the technique described above.<br>
According to this mode, such desirable effect that sublimation<br>
from inside is facilitated by freezing of whole wet body in<br>
a slurry state compared with the case when the wet body provided<br>
as described above is simply lyophilized as it is, can be<br>
obtained.<br>
In such mode, the solvent to be added to the wet body<br>
when the wet body in a slurry state is prepared is not<br>
particularly limited. However, a solvent, which does not<br>
react with the DIH compound and is easy to sublime in the<br>
following lyophilization, is preferably used. An example of<br>
the solvent to be added includes, besides water, ethyl acetate,<br>
n-butyl acetate, N, N-dimethylformamide, and the like. Among<br>
them, preferably water is further added from the viewpoints<br>
of moderate price, easy-handling, and being suitable for<br>
lyophilization.<br>
Addition amount of the solvent when the solvent is added<br>
to the wet body is also not particularly limited, but the<br><br>
13<br>
solvent may be added so that total content of the solvent<br>
to the whole amount of the wet body in a slurry state becomes<br>
preferably 30 to 70% by mass, and more preferably 50 to 60%<br>
by mass.<br>
According to the production method of the first aspect<br>
of the present invention, by any technique of (1) and (2),<br>
the release of I2 in production of DIH compound can be inhibited<br>
to the minimum, and conventional various problems associated<br>
with the release of I2 can be solved. In other words, according<br>
to the production method of the first aspect of the present<br>
invention, a DIH compound which has a more reduced content<br>
of released I2 than before can be produced. Namely, a second<br>
aspect of the present invention is a DIH compound which has<br>
a reduced content of free I2. In this case, content of the<br>
free I2 in the DIH compound of the second aspect of the present<br>
invention is preferably 1% by mass or less, more preferably<br>
0.8% by mass or less, further more preferably .0.4% by mass<br>
or less, and particularly preferably 0.2% by mass or less.<br>
As described above, since the free I2 is an impurity to cause<br>
various problems, lower content of the free I2 in the resultant<br>
DIH compound is more preferable . However, the technical scope<br>
of the production method of the first aspect of the present<br>
invention is not necessarily limited only to a mode in which<br>
a DIH compound containing such amount of the free I2 is produced.<br>
In some case, a DIH compound containing the free I2 in an amount<br>
out of this range may be produced. In addition, the technical<br>
scope of the DIH compound of the present invention is not<br>
necessarily limited only to the mode in which the DIH compound<br>
is produced by the production method of the first aspect of<br>
the present invention, and in some case, the DIH compound<br>
may be produced by other production method. In this regard,<br>
as a content of free I2 in the DIH compound produced, a value<br><br>
14<br>
measured by the technique described in Example below should<br>
be employed.<br>
In addition, in the DIH compound of the second aspect<br>
of the present invention, besides the content of free I2, less<br>
content of water is also more preferable. This is because<br>
decomposition of DIH compound and release of I2 accompanying<br>
thereto in production and storage of DIH compound occur more<br>
easily when water content is higher. Specifically, content<br>
of water in the DIH compound of the second aspect of the present<br>
invention is preferably 6% by mass or less, more preferably<br>
5% by mass or less, further more preferably 3% by mass or<br>
less, and particularly preferably 1% by mass . Consequently,<br>
when the wet body containing a DIH compound is subjected to<br>
fluidized drying (1) or lyophilization (2) in the production<br>
method of the first aspect of the present invention, drying<br>
conditions may be controlled so that content of water in the<br>
resultant DIH compound becomes a value in the above range.<br>
Application of the DIH compound of the second aspect<br>
of the present invention is not particularly limited, but<br>
it can be employed, for example, in applications such as a<br>
sensitive material of photography or an iodizing agent or<br>
an oxidizing agent in production processes for medical drugs,<br>
agricultural chemicals, chemicals, or the like.<br>
As described above, the production method for DIH<br>
compound was explained as the first aspect of the present<br>
invention, and the DIH compound itself was also explained<br>
as the second aspect of the present invention. The present<br>
invention also provides a storage method for DIH compound<br>
as a third aspect of the present invention.<br>
The storage method of the third aspect of the present<br>
invention has been made based on the knowledge that<br>
decomposition of DIH compound and release of I2 accompanying<br><br>
15<br>
thereto occurs more easily under a comparatively higher<br>
temperature condition.<br>
Namely, the third aspect of the present invention is<br>
a storage method comprising a step in which a DIH compound<br>
is stored under a temperature condition of-15°C or lower.<br>
The DIH compound to be used in the storage method of<br>
the third aspect of the present invention is not particularly<br>
limited, and conventionally well known DIH compound can be<br>
used. However, in view of sufficient inhibition of<br>
decomposition of DIH compound and release of I2 thereby, the<br>
DIH compound produced by the production method of the first<br>
aspect of the present invention or the DIH compound provided<br>
as the second aspect of the present invention is preferably<br>
used. Since specific mode of these DIH compounds is as<br>
described above, detailed explanation will be omitted here.<br>
In the third aspect of the present invention, the DIH<br>
compound is stored under a temperature condition of 15°C or<br>
lower, preferably 10°C or lower, and more preferably 5°C or<br>
lower. By this operation, the decomposition of DIH compound<br>
and the release of I2 thereby can be inhibited.<br>
In the third aspect of the present invention, specific<br>
mode other than the storage under the above temperature<br>
condition is not particularly limited, and conventionally<br>
well known knowledge about storage of chemical compounds can<br>
be referred to as appropriate . In this regard, in the present<br>
invention, concept of "storage" includes not only a mode when<br>
a DIH compound is placed in one position, but also a mode<br>
such as "transportation" in which a DIH compound is transferred<br>
among various places until it is used for a prescribed<br>
application.<br>
In the third aspect of the present invention, humidity<br>
condition in the storage of DIH compound is not particularly<br><br>
16<br>
limited, but generally it is preferable to be stored under<br>
a low humidity condition. Specifically, relative humidity<br>
(RH) in an atmosphere of storage place is preferably 50% or<br>
less, and more preferably 301 or less.<br>
In the storage method of the third aspect of-the present<br>
invention, DIH compound is usually stored in a packed state<br>
in a prescribed container. Specific mode of the container<br>
is also not particularly limited, and conventionally well<br>
known storage containers in storage field of chemical<br>
compounds can be employed as appropriate. Constituent<br>
material for the storage containers includes industrially<br>
commodity type of resins, and specifically includes<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyester,<br>
polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, and the like.<br>
Shape of the storage containers is also not particularly<br>
limited, and shapes such as bag-like, box-like, drum-like,<br>
and the like are exemplified.<br>
Even by the storage method of the third aspect of the<br>
present invention, a very small amount of I2 can be released<br>
from DIH compound during storage. Consequently, the storage<br>
container is preferably those having a hermetically sealing<br>
function. From such viewpoint, as a constitutional material<br>
for the storage containers, polyvinylidene chloride /<br>
polyethylene composite material and<br>
high-barrier-performance polymers are preferably employed.<br>
Metal containers with resin lining can also be used as the<br>
storage containers . However, in such mode, it should be noted<br>
that the metal material could be corroded by penetration of<br>
a very small amount of free I2 when storage is continued for<br>
an extremely long period.<br>
In the storage method of the third aspect of the present<br>
invention, the temperature condition is not necessarily in<br><br>
17<br>
the above range through whole course of storage period, but<br>
the temperature condition may be in the above range in about<br>
100% of the period except the period when the DIH compound<br>
is temporally stored under a temperature condition of around<br>
ordinary temperature because of transfer or the like.<br>
The storage method of the third aspect of the present<br>
invention may be combined with the production method of the<br>
first aspect of the present invention.<br>
For example, when a DIH compound is premised to be stored<br>
using the storage method of the third aspect of the present<br>
invention, it is convenient to produce the DIH compound<br>
according to the production method of the first aspect of<br>
the present invention, then to store directly the DIH compound<br>
by the storage method of the third aspect of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Examples<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be explained<br>
more in detail using Examples and Comparative Example, however,<br>
the technical scope of the present invention is not limited<br>
to the following modes.<br><example><br>
As a wet body containing a DIH compound,<br>
5, 5-dimethyl-l, 3-diiodohydantoin (20 kg) containing n-butyl<br>
acetate (2% by mass) and water (13% by mass) was provided.<br>
The wet body provided as described above was charged<br>
into a fluidized dryer. The wet body was dried by contacting<br>
the wet body with air of 110°C as a heated gas in a flow rate<br>
of 1 m/sec for 30 minutes to obtain pale yellow crystalline<br>
powder of 5,5-dimethyl-l,3-diiodohydantoin in a purity of<br>
98% or more.<br>
After that, contents of free I2 and water in the resultant<br><br>
18<br>
powder were determined. As a result, content of free I2 was<br>
0.2% by mass or less, and content of water was 1% by mass<br>
or less. In this regard, the contents of free I2 and water<br>
were measured by the following techniques.<br>
Pleasuring method for contentOt "free I2&gt;<br>
According to "First method: Method by heating drying<br>
under atmospheric pressure" in JIS-K0067"1992 4.1.4(1)<br>
described in "2004-edited JIS Handbook, 49, Chemical<br>
Analysis", a sample was heated at 60°C for 2 hours under the<br>
atmospheric pressure, and decrease in mass was measured to<br>
obtain a content of free I2.<br><measuring method for content of water><br>
According to "First method: Method by heating drying<br>
under atmospheric pressure" in JIS-K0067"1992 4.1.4(1)<br>
described in "2004-edited JIS Handbook, 49, Chemical<br>
Analysis", the sample, which was used for measuring content<br>
of free I2, was dried at 105°C for 2 hours under the atmospheric<br>
pressure, and decrease in mass was measured to obtain a content<br>
of water.<br><example><br>
As a wet body containing a DIH compound,<br>
5, 5-dimethyl-l, 3-diiodohydantoin (50 g) containing water (8%<br>
by mass) was provided.<br>
The wet body provided as described above was charged<br>
into a lyophilizer, then cooled down to -80°C to freeze the<br>
wet body. Subsequently, the resultant frozen body was dried<br>
by sublimation at 20°C for 22 hours under reduced pressure<br>
condition of 270 Pa to obtain pale yellow crystalline powder<br>
Of 5,5-dimethyl-l,3-diiodohydantoin in a purity of 95% or<br>
more.<br>
After that, contents of free I2 and water in the resultant<br>
powder were determined. As a result, content of free I2 was<br><br>
19<br>
0.2% by mass or less, and content of water was 5% by mass.<br><example><br>
As a wet body containing a DIH compound,<br>
5,5-dimethyl-l,3-diiodohydantoin (21g) containing water (8%<br>
by mass) was provided.<br>
Water (22 g) as a solvent was further added to the wet<br>
body provided as described above to prepare a wet body in<br>
a slurry state.<br>
The wet body in a slurry state as described above was<br>
charged into a lyophilizer, and cooled down to -80°C to freeze<br>
the wet body. Subsequently, the resultant frozen body was<br>
dried by sublimation at20°Cforl4 hours under reduced pressure<br>
condition of 270 Pa to obtain pale yellow crystalline powder<br>
of 5, 5-dimethyl-l,3-diiodohydantoin in a purity of 98% or<br>
more.<br>
After that, contents of free I2 and water in the resultant<br>
powder were determined. As a result, content of free I2 was<br>
0.2% by mass or less, and content of water was 1% by mass.<br><storage stability><br>
The pale yellow crystalline powders of<br>
5,5-dimethyl-l,3-diiodohydantoin obtained in Examples 1 to<br>
3 described above were stored each in hermetically sealed<br>
state in a polyethylene-made container at 5°C. As a result,<br>
no change in appearance of the compound or content of released<br>
I2 was observed even after 6 months of time course.<br><comparative example><br>
As a wet body containing a DIH compound,<br>
5,5-dimethyl-l,3-diiodohydantoin (200 kg) containing<br>
n-butyl acetate (2%" by mass) and water (13% by mass) was<br>
provided.<br>
The wet body provided as described above was charged<br>
into a 1,000 L conical dryer, then, dried at 40 to 70°C under<br><br>
20<br>
a reduced pressure of 2,700 to 5,300 Pa.<br>
As a result, decomposition of<br>
5,5-dimethyl-l,3-diiodohydantoin started to proceed after<br>
about 4 hours from the start of drying, and I2 was released.<br>
And after about 8 hours from the start of drying, vacuum line<br>
was blocked up by the released I2. From then on, drying by<br>
the conical dryer could not be continued. In this case, the<br>
resultant 5, 5-dimethyl-l, 3-diiodohydantoin was red crystal,<br>
and contained 2% by mass or more of released I2 and 8% by mass<br>
of water, and could not be used practically. In addition,<br>
this red crystal was stored in a hermetically sealed state<br>
in a polyethylene-made container at5°C. Releaseofl2further<br>
proceeded within several weeks, and such appearance that<br>
released I2 deposited in the upper part of the container was<br>
observed.<br><storage test><br>
As aDIHcompound, 5,5-dimethyl-l,3-diiodohydantoin (20<br>
kg) (content of free I2: 0.2% by mass, content of water: 1%<br>
by mass) was provided.<br>
On the other hand, as storage containers, two bags made<br>
of polyvinylidene chloride / polyethylene composite material<br>
were provided.<br>
In each storage container provided as described above,<br>
the DIH compound (10 kg each) also provided as described above<br>
was packed, then each bag was heat-sealed after the packing.<br>
After that, one of the storage containers packed with<br>
the DIH compound was stored at 5°C (Example), and the other<br>
was stored at 25°C (Comparative Example). As a result, in<br>
the case of Example, no change in quality (specifically,<br>
content of released I2) of the DIH compound was observed even<br>
after one year or more of storage. On the contrary, in the<br>
case of Comparative Example, decomposition of the DIH compound<br><br>
21<br>
started to release I2 after 2 months of storage, and coloration<br>
of the bag was observed.<br>
From the results described above, it is indicated that<br>
decomposition of DIH compound and release of I2 thereby in<br>
drying can be inhibited and a high quality of DIH compound<br>
which is easy to handle and superior in storage stability<br>
can be produced by subjecting wet body containing a DIH compound<br>
to fluidized drying or lyophilization. In addition,<br>
according to the storage method of the present invention,<br>
it is indicated that the DIH compounds are kept in high quality<br>
over long term.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, release of<br>
I2 in production or storage of DIH compound can be inhibited,<br>
and thereby prevent ion of decrease in purity of the DIH compound<br>
or occurrence of various problems caused by I2 can be expected.<br>
It should be noted that, the present invention is based<br>
on JP Application No. 2005-25557 filed on 2nd September, 2005,<br>
and the content of disclosure has been incorporated herein<br>
