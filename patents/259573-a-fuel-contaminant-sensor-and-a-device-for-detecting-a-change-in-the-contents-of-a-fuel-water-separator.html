FIELD The present disclosure relates to contaminant sensing, and<br>
more particularly to a fuel contaminant light sensor.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
 The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
 Diesel engine fuel systems are sensitive to the presence of<br>
water and other contaminants in the diesel fuel. Since water does not provide<br>
the lubricity required for the tight fitting components of the diesel engine fuel<br>
system, the presence of water in the diesel fuel can cause wear on the<br>
components. In addition, water often contains biological and chemical corrosives<br>
that can cause degradation of the diesel fuel system components. As such,<br>
many diesel fuel systems use fuel-water separators to remove water and other<br>
contaminants from the diesel fuel.<br>
 Fuel-water separators are typically coupled to a fuel line<br>
between the source of the diesel fuel and the engine. Fuel-water separators<br>
typically include a reservoir that collects the water and other contaminants after<br>
they have been separated from the diesel fuel. While these fuel-water<br>
separators work well for their intended purpose, the reservoir needs to be<br><br>
interrogated to determine if the volume of captured water is such that it needs to<br>
be drained and serviced. One form of interrogation known in the art is periodic<br>
visual inspection through the optically clear reservoir of the fuel-water separator.<br>
 In recent years, electrically based sensors using electrodes<br>
have been added to the fuel-water separators to trigger a warning signal<br>
indicating that the reservoir needs to be drained. An electric potential is<br>
impressed upon these electrodes which is not conducted through the electrically<br>
non-conductive diesel fuel. However, when electrically conductive water is<br>
present, the electric potential is conducted through the water, thereby indicating<br>
the reservoir needs draining. While these electric sensors have worked well in<br>
the past, the electrodes of the electric sensors are possibly subject to some of<br>
the corrosive elements within the diesel and fuel contaminants. Therefore, there<br>
is room in the art for an improved non-conductive water sensing system.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
 In one aspect of the present invention a fuel contaminant light<br>
sensor is provided.<br>
 In another aspect of the present invention the light sensor<br>
includes a fluid reservoir having an inlet and an outlet, a light source for<br>
projecting a light beam through the fluid reservoir, a light beam detector for<br>

activating the light source and receiving an output of the light beam detector. An<br><br>
interruption of the light beam inhibits the light beam detector from receiving the<br>

 In still another aspect of the present invention the interruption is<br>
due to a change of an index of refraction of a fluid between the light source and<br>
the receiver.<br>

determine whether the light beam has been detected. A reflector is coupled to<br>
the reservoir. The reflector is in alignment with the emitter/detector such that the<br>
light beam emitted from the emitter is reflected by the reflector back to the<br>
emitter/detector. An interruption of the light beam between the emitter/detector<br>
and the reflector prevents the emitter/detector from detecting the light beam.<br>
 In still another aspect of the present invention, the interruption is<br>
due to a change of index of refraction due to the introduction of a second fluid<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
 The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
 FIG. 1A illustrates a sensing system 10 according to the<br>
principles of the present invention. The sensing system 10 is illustrated in<br>
operation with an exemplary fuel-water separator 12. However, it should be<br><br>
appreciated that the sensing system 10 may be employed with any structure<br>
having a reservoir for containing a substance, such as a. fuel tank or storage<br>
container. The fuel-water separator 12 is typically located between a fuel supply<br>
(not shown) and an engine (not shown) of a motor vehicle (not shown). The fuel-<br>
water separator 12 is operable to separate water and other contaminates from<br>
fuel, as will be described in further detail below. The fuel-water separator 12<br>
generally includes a ported housing 14 and a cup-shaped reservoir 16. The<br>
housing 14 includes an inlet port 18 for receiving a fuel from the fuel supply (not<br>
shown) and an outlet port 20 for discharging the fuel once water and<br>
contaminates have been removed. The housing 14 further includes a fuel<br>
discharge port 22 and a fuel return port 24 located on a bottom surface 26 of the<br>
housing 14. The reservoir 16 is sealingly secured to the bottom surface 26 such<br>
that the fuel discharge port 22 and fuel return port 24 are located within a cavity<br>
28 defined by the reservoir 16 and the housing 14.<br>
During operation of the fuel-water separator 12, fuel from the<br>
fuel supply (not shown) enters the housing 14 via the inlet port 18. The fuel<br>
passes through a flow passage (not shown) within the housing 14 and is<br>
discharged into the reservoir 16 via the fuel discharge port 22, as indicated by<br>
the downward arrow. Water and contaminants, which are heavier than the fuel,<br>
settle to a quiet zone 30 located at the bottom of the reservoir 16. The fuel then<br>
returns to the housing 14 via the fuel return port 24, as indicated by the upward<br>
arrow. The fuel may then be further filtered within the housing 14 before being<br>
discharged from the fuel-water separator 12 via the outlet port 20. To remove<br><br>
water or contaminants from the quiet zone 30, the fuel-water separator 12<br>
includes a drain valve 32 located at the bottom of the reservoir 16. The drain<br>
valve 32 communicates between the reservoir and the surrounding environment.<br>
Opening the drain valve 32 allows the contents of the reservoir 16 to be<br>
discharged therefrom.<br>
 The sensing system 10 includes a controller 34 in electronic<br>
communication with an emitter 36, or light source, and a receiver 38. In an<br>
alternate embodiment, the controller 34 is in electronic communication with the<br>
drain valve 32 in order to automatically open or close the drain valve 32. The<br>
controller 34 is an electronic device having a preprogrammed digital computer or<br>
processor, control logic, memory used to store data, and at least one I/O section.<br>
The control logic includes a plurality of logic routines for monitoring,<br>
manipulating, and generating data. The controller 34 may be part of the control<br>
for a motor vehicle or a separate module.<br>
 The emitter 36 is secured to the reservoir 16, as will be<br>
described in further detail below. The emitter 36 is operable to emit a light beam<br>
therefrom. The light beam is indicated by the arrow "A" in FIG. 1A and may be<br>
coherent light or any other form of light. The emitter 36 may be any kind of light<br>
source, such as, for example, a laser or light emitting diode. The emitter 36 may<br>
emit the light beam continuously or it may pulse the light beam at predetermined<br>
or random intervals for selected time periods. The receiver 38 is also secured to<br>
the reservoir 16 and is located generally opposite the emitter 36. The receiver 38<br>
is operable to detect the light beam emitted from the emitter 36. In the preferred<br><br>
embodiment, the emitter 36 and receiver 38 are protected by a layer or coating of<br>
non-corrosive materials, such as, for example, glass.<br>
 In the particular example provided, the emitter 36 and the<br>
receiver 38 are coupled to an inner surface 40 of the reservoir 16. Alternatively,<br>
the emitter 36 and the receiver 38 may be coupled to an outer surface 42 of the<br>
reservoir 16 so long as the emitter 36 is able to emit the light beam through the<br>
reservoir 16. This may be accomplished by employing a transparent reservoir 16<br>
made from a material having a known index of refraction or by providing ports<br>
through the reservoir 16 for the emitter 36 and receiver 38 to extend<br>
therethrough.<br>
 The emitter 36 and receiver 38 are positioned within the<br>
reservoir 16 such that the light beam is directed from the emitter 36 towards the<br>
receiver 38. So long as any substance, such as fuel or air, located within the<br>
cavity 28 has a constant index of refraction, the light beam emitted from the<br>
emitter 36 will be detected by the receiver 38.<br>
 The controller 34 communicates with the emitter 36 to activate<br>
the light beam and communicates with the receiver 38 to determine whether the<br>
light beam has been detected by the receiver 38. If the light beam is directed<br>
from the emitter 36 to the receiver 38 without interruption, then the receiver 38<br>
will communicate with the controller 34 that the receiver 38 is detecting the<br>
coherent light beam. This detection of the light beam is indicative that there is no<br>
interruption of the light beam, indicative that there is no change of index of<br>
refraction of the fuel within the cavity 28 of the fuel-water separator 12 and<br><br>
indicative that the reservoir 16 does not need to be drained of water or<br>
contaminants.<br>
 In an alternate embodiment the sensing system 10 includes a<br>
plurality of receivers 39 located on the reservoir 16 opposite the emitter 36.<br>
Alternatively, the receivers 38 and 39 may form one single strip sensor that<br>
extends along the reservoir 16. The plurality of receivers 39 are in electronic<br>
communication with the controller 34. Like the receiver 38, the additional<br>
plurality of receivers 39 are operable to communicate with the controller 34 that<br>
the plurality of receivers 39 are detecting the light beam. As will be described in<br>
greater detail below, the plurality of receivers 39 will only detect the light beam<br>
when the light beam has been redirected within the reservoir 16.<br>
 Turning now to FIG. 1B, if water is contained within the fuel as it<br>
enters the fuel-water separator 12, this water will settle to the quiet zone 30 of<br>
the reservoir 16 where the water will accumulate, as indicated by reference<br>
number 44. The water 44 in part defines an interface 46 between the water 44<br>
and any other substance, such as fuel or air, within the cavity 28. While water 44<br>
is illustrated in the particular example provided, it should be appreciated that<br>
various other contaminants may separate out of the fuel and behave in the same<br>
manner as the water 44.<br>
 As the amount of collected water 44 increases, the interface 46<br>
of the water 44 will rise towards the bottom surface 26 of the housing 12.<br>
Eventually, the interface 46 of the water 44 will rise above the receiver 38 within<br>
the reservoir 16, as is illustrated in FIG. 1B. Once the interface 46 of the water<br><br>
44 has risen above the receiver 38, the water 44 will be in a direct line with the<br>
light beam emitted from the emitter 36. As the light beam passes through the<br>
interface 46 of the water 44, the light beam is refracted such that the light beam<br>
is no longer directed towards the receiver 38. This refraction of the light beam<br>
occurs because the water 44 has an index of refraction different from the index of<br>
refraction of the fuel or air located within the cavity 28. For example, the fuel<br>
within the cavity 28 has an index of refraction of approximately 1.44 while the<br>
water 44 has an index of refraction of approximately 1.33. The position of the<br>
receiver 38 with respect to the reservoir 16 determines how much water 44 is<br>
allowed to accumulate before the light beam is refracted. In the example<br>
illustrated in FIG.'s 1A and 1B, the receiver 38 is located near the bottom of the<br>
reservoir 16 such that a small amount of water 44 within the reservoir 16 will<br>
refract the coherent light beam. Alternatively, the receiver 38 may be positioned<br>
on the reservoir 16 closer to the bottom surface 26 of the housing 14 to allow<br>
more water 44 to accumulate before the water 44 refracts the light beam. In this<br>
sense, knowing the location of the receiver 38 relative to the reservoir 16 allows<br>
the sensing system 10 to know how much water has collected in the reservoir 16.<br>
	The light beam also may be attenuated if there is a change<br>
in the transparency of the substance within the cavity 28. For example, if the fuel<br>
suffers from gelling or clouding due to cold weather, the transparency of the fuel<br>
will change, and the light beam will be attenuated such that it is not detected by<br>
the receiver 38. Additionally, refraction may occur when water droplets falling<br>
from the top of the reservoir 16 to the quiet zone 30 momentarily interrupt the<br><br>
coherent light beam. Such momentary interruption of detection by the receiver<br>
38	may be used to indicate early warning accumulation of water 44 within the<br>
reservoir 16.<br>
 As noted above, the controller 34 communicates with the emitter<br>
36 to activate the light beam and communicates with the receiver 38 to determine<br>
whether the light beam has been detected by the receiver 38. If the presence of<br>
the water 44 within the reservoir 16 refracts the light beam, the receiver 38 will<br>
communicate with the controller 34 that the receiver 38 is not detecting the light<br>
beam. This non-detection of the light beam is indicative of a problem within the<br>
fuel-water separator 12. This problem may be that the water 44 within the<br>
reservoir 16 should be drained by opening the drain valve 32 or that the fuel is<br>
gelling or clouding due to cold weather. Once a problem has been detected, the<br>
controller 34 may take various initiatives to alert an operator of the motor vehicle<br>
of the problem or to take action to solve the problem. For example, the controller<br>
34 may activate a water warning signal (either digital or analog), send an<br>
electronic signal to the motor vehicle control to activate a engine warning signal,<br>
automatically open the drain valve 32 using an electronically controlled actuator,<br>
or automatically activate a heating element to warm the fuel.<br>
 In the embodiment where the sensing system 10 includes the<br>
plurality of receivers 39, refraction or attenuation of the light beam can direct the<br>
light beam towards one of the plurality of receivers 39. The plurality of receivers<br>
39	then detects the light beam and communicates the detection to the controller<br>
34. Control logic within the controller 34 can use the detection of the light beam<br><br>
from a specific one of the plurality of receivers 39 to determine various conditions<br>
within the reservoir 16. For example, the controller 34 may include a look-up<br>
table of known indices of refraction for known substances that are often additives<br>
of Diesel fuel such as kerosene or biodiesel fuel. As one of the plurality of<br>
receivers 39 detects the light beam, the controller 34 may calculate the index of<br>
refraction of the substance within the reservoir 16 based on which receiver 39<br>
has detected the light, and use this calculated index of refraction to look up which<br>
substance has a matching index of refraction. In this way, the sensing system 10<br>
can determine not only that there has been an interruption of the light beam, but<br>
it can also determine what kind of substance is located within the reservoir 16.<br>
This may include what kind of fuel is being employed (such as what percentage<br>
of biodiesel fuel, kerosene, etc.) or what kind of contaminants are in the reservoir<br>
16 (such as water, sea water, etc.). The use of the plurality of sensors 39 may<br>
also be used to determine the water level or contamination level within the<br>
reservoir 16 based on the degree of the calculated index of refraction. The<br>
controller 34 is operable to track the change in the index of refraction of the fuel<br>
within the reservoir 16 over a period of time. The controller 34 may then<br>
communicate the determined composition of the fuel to an engine controller (not<br>
shown) which can then use the information to adjust combustion parameters.<br>
 With reference to FIG. 2, a second sensing system 100 is<br>
illustrated with the exemplary fuel-water separator 12. The second sensing<br>
system 100 includes a controller 102 in electronic communication with an<br>
integrated light emitter/detector 104. A reflector 106 is positioned opposite the<br><br>
integrated light emitter/detector 104. The controller 102 is an electronic device<br>
having a preprogrammed digital computer or processor, control logic, memory<br>
used to store data, and at least one I/O section. The control logic includes a<br>
plurality of logic routines for monitoring, manipulating, and generating data. The<br>
controller 102 may be part of the control for a motor vehicle or a separate<br>
module.<br>
 The integrated light emitter/detector 104 is coupled to the<br>
reservoir 16, as will be described in further detail below. The integrated light<br>
emitter/detector 104 is operable to emit a light beam therefrom and is operable to<br>
detect a returning light beam. The light beam is indicated by the arrow "A" in<br>
FIG. 2A. The integrated light emitter/detector 104 may be any kind of light<br>
source and light detector known in the art. The integrated light emitter/detector<br>
104 may emit the light beam continuously or the integrated light emitter/detector<br>
104 may pulse the light beam at predetermined or random intervals. The<br>
reflector 106 is also coupled to the reservoir 16 and is located generally opposite<br>
the emitter 36. The reflector 106 has a surface 108 operable to reflect the light<br>
beam back towards the integrated light emitter/detector 104. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, the integrated light emitter/detector 104 and the reflector 106 are<br>
protected by a coating or layer of a non-corrosive material, such as, for example,<br>
glass.<br>
 In the particular example provided, the integrated light<br>
emitter/detector 104 and reflector 106 are coupled to an inner surface 40 of the<br>
reservoir 16. Alternatively, the integrated light emitter/detector 104 and the<br><br>
reflector 106 may be coupled to an outer surface 42 of the reservoir 16 so long<br>
as the integrated light emitter/detector 104 is able to emit the light beam through<br>
the reservoir 16. This may be accomplished by employing a transparent<br>
reservoir 16 made from a material having a known index of refraction or by<br>
providing ports through the reservoir 16 for the integrated light emitter/detector<br>
104 and the reflector 106 to extend therethrough.<br>
 The integrated light emitter/detector 104 and the reflector 106<br>
are positioned within the reservoir 16 such that the light beam is directed from<br>
the integrated light emitter/detector 104 towards the reflector 106 which in turn<br>
reflects the light beam back towards the integrated light emitter/detector 104. So<br>
long as any substance, such as fuel or air, located within the cavity 28 has a<br>
constant index of refraction, the light beam emitted from the integrated light<br>
emitter/detector 104 will be reflected by the reflector 106 and in turn detected by<br>
the integrated light emitter/detector 104.<br>
 The controller 102 communicates with the integrated light<br>
emitter/detector 104 to activate the light beam and to determine whether the light<br>
beam has been in turn detected by the integrated light emitter/detector 104. If<br>
the light beam is emitted and detected by the integrated light emitter/detector<br>
104, then the integrated light emitter/detector 104 will communicate with the<br>
controller 102 that the integrated light emitter/detector 104 is detecting the light<br>
beam. This detection of the light beam is indicative that there is no interruption of<br>
the light beam, indicative that there is no change of index of refraction of the fuel<br><br>
within the cavity 28 of the fuel-water separator 12 and indicative that the reservoir<br>
16 does not need to be drained of water or contaminants.<br>
 Turning now to FIG. 2B, water 44 located within the reservoir 16<br>
at a level above the reflector 106 has an effect similar to that described in FIG.<br>
1A. Specifically, as the amount of water 44 that is collected increases, the<br>
interface 46 of the water 44 will rise towards the bottom surface 26 of the housing<br>
12. Eventually, the interface 46 of the water 44 will rise above the reflector 106<br>
within the reservoir 16. Once the interface 46 of the water 44 has risen above<br>
the reflector 106, the water 44 will be in direct line with the light beam emitted<br>
from the integrated light emitter/detector 104. As the light beam passes across<br>
the interface 46 of the water 44, the light beam is refracted such that the light<br>
beam is no longer directed towards the receiver 38. This refraction of the light<br>
beam occurs because the water 44 has an index of refraction different from the<br>
index of refraction of the fuel or air located within the cavity 28. The position of<br>
the reflector 106 with respect to the reservoir 16 determines how much water 44<br>
is allowed to accumulate before the light beam is refracted.<br>
 The light beam also may be attenuated if there is a change in<br>
the transparency of the substance within the cavity 28. For example, if the fuel<br>
suffers from gelling or clouding due to cold weather, the transparency of the fuel<br>
will change, and the light beam will be attenuated such that it is not detected by<br>
the integrated light emitter/detector 104.<br>
 As noted above, the controller 102 communicates with the<br>
integrated light emitter/detector 104 to activate the light beam and to determine<br><br>
whether the light beam has been detected. If the presence of the water 44 within<br>
the reservoir 16 refracts the light beam, the integrated light emitter/detector 104<br>
will communicate with the controller 102 that the integrated light emitter/detector<br>
104 is not detecting the light beam. This non-detection of the light beam is<br>
indicative of a problem within the fuel-water separator 12. This problem may be<br>
that the water 44 within the reservoir 16 should be drained by opening the drain<br>
valve 32 or that the fuel is gelling or clouding due to cold weather. Once a<br>
problem has been detected, the controller 102 may take various initiatives to alert<br>
an operator of the motor vehicle of the problem or to take action to solve the<br>
problem. For example, the controller 102 may activate a water warning signal<br>
(either digital or analog), send an electronic signal to the motor vehicle control to<br>
activate a engine warning signal, automatically open the drain valve 32 using an<br>
electronically controller actuator, or automatically activate a heating element to<br>
heat the fuel.<br>
 The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
