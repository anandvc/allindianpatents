				<td>ARTTCLFS CONTAINING SILICONE COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF MAKING SUCH<br>
ARTICLES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This disclosuie, in general, relates to a method for making a silicone composition and articles including the silicone composition,<br>
nACKGROUND ART<br>
Curable silicone compositions are used in a variety of applications that rani-es from the automotive industry to medical devices. Typical commercial formulations of liquid silicone rubber (LSR) compositions include a nuiiti-component mixture of a vinyl-containing polydiorganosiloxane, a hydmgen-containing polydiorganosiloxane. catalyst, and filler, Often, the commercial formulation is a two-part formulation that is mixed together prior to use. Once the commercial foraiiilation is mixed, the silicone composition is subsequently molded or exhiided and vulcanized.<br>
In many cases, the silicone composition is coupled to a variety of substrates such as polymeric, metallic, or glass substrates, tor instance, silicone compositions are used as a coating or a laminate over a variety of polymeric substrates. Typically, a primer is used between the silicone composition and the substrate. Alternatively, the backbone of the silicone composition may be formulated to provide the silicone composition with adhesive properties to various substrates, such that a primer is optional. Often, such silicone compositions are refen-ed to as self-bonding silicone compositions.<br>
While self-bonding silicone compositions desirably improve bonding to panicular stibstrates. such compositions are generally orders of magnitude more expensive than other silicone formulations. In addition, manufactures of products that use such self-bonding silicone compositions are limited in their ability lo customize such formulations to better suit a particular product or process. As a result, manufacturers are otten left to choose between desired bonding propeitics or desired mechanical properties, without an option to acquire both.<br>
As such, an improved silicone formulations and method of manufacturing silicone-including aiticles would be desirable.<br>

BRIEF DESCWPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The present disclosure may be better understood, and its numerous features and advantages made apparent lo those skilled in the art by referencing the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIGs. I and 2 include illustrations of e.Tjemplarymbes.<br>
FIG. 3 includes graphical illustrations of data representing the perfonnance of exemplary tubes.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF TliF, EMBOniMENT(S)<br>
In a particular embodiment, a silicone composition includes a silicone formulation and an in situ adhesion promoter, stich as a silsesquioxane. The incorporation of the in situ adhesion promoter into the silicone formulation provides a silicone composition that adheres to substrates wiih desirable peel sti'ength. In particular, desirable adhesion may be achieved without a primer, Tlie silicone composition is typically prepared by homogeneously mixing tlie in sini adhesion promoter with the silicone fonnulation using any suitable mixing method. "In situ" as used herein refers to mixing the adhesion promoter and the silicone formulation prior to vulcanization of the silicone rubber.<br>
Tn an exemplary embodiment, the silicone formulation may include a non-polar silicone polymer. The silicone polymer may, for example, include poiyalkytsiloxanes, such as silicone polymers formed of a precursor, stich as dimelhylsiloxane, diethyl si loxane, dipropylsiloxane, methylethylsiloxane. methylpropylsiloxane. or combinations thereof. In a particular embodiment, the polyalkylsiloxane includes a polydialkylsiloxane, such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). In a particular embodiment, the polyalkylsiloxane is a silicone hydride-containing polydimethylsiloxane. In a further embodiment, the polyalkylsiloxane is a vinyl-containing polydimethylsiloxane. In yet another<br><br>
embodiment., ihc silicone polymer is a combination of a hydride-eon laining polydiraethylailoxime and a vinyl-conlaining polydimethylsiloxane, In an example, the silicone polymer is non-polar and is free of halidc functional groups, such as chlorine and fluorine, and of phenyl functional groups. Alternatively, the silicone polymer may include halide functional groups or phenyl functional groups. For example, the silicone polymer may include fluorosilicone or phcnylsilicone.<br>
Typically^ the silicone polymer is elastomeric. For example, the diuometer (Shore A) of the silicone polymer may be less than about 75, such as about 1 to 70, abotit 20 to about 50, about 30 to about 50, about 40 to about 50, or aboul I to about 5, Jn particular, the silicone compositions including the in situ adhesion promoter and the process for fonmilating sxich a composition may advantageously produce low durometer silicone elastomers having desirable nieehanieal properties. For example, a silicone elastomer having a Shore A durometer not greater than 30, such as not gieatcr than 25, and having desirable mechanical properties may be formed.<br>
The silicone fomiutation may ftirther include a catalyst and other optional additives. Exemplai-y additives may include, individually or in combination, fiilei's, inhibitors, colorants, and pigments. In an embodiment, the silicone fomiulation is a platinum catalyzed silicone formulation. Ahernatively, the silicone fonnulation may be a peroxide catalyzed silicone formulation. In another example, the silicone foi'mulation may be a combination of a platiniun catalyzed and peroxide catalyzed silicone fonnulation, The silicone fomiulation may be a room temperature vulcanizable (RTV) formulation or a gel. In an example, the silicone formulation may be a liquid silicone nibber (LSR) or a high consistency gum mbber (HCR). In an embodiment, the silicone formulation may include silicone foams, for example, an HCR silicone foam, such as platinum cured HCR silicone foam. Jn a particular embodiment, the silicone formulation is a phtimim catalyzed LSR. In a ftirther embodiment, the silicone formulation is an LSR formed from a two-part reactive system.<br>
The silicone formulation may be a conventional, commercially prepared silicone polymer. The commercially prepared silicone polymer typically includes the non-polar silicone polymer, a catalyst, a filler, and optional additives, "Conventionfil" as used herein refers to a commercially prepared silicone polymer that is free of any self-bonding moiety or additive. Particular embodiments of conventional, commercially prepared LSR include Wactcer Elastosil® LR 3003/50 by Wacker Silicone of Adrian, MI and Rhodia Silhione® LSR 4340 by Rhodia Silicones of Ventura, CA. In another example, the silicone polymer is an HCR, such as Wacker Elastosil® R4000/50 available from Wacker Silicone,.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, a conventional, commercially prepared silicone polymer is available as a two-part reactive system. Part 1 typically includes a vinyl-containing polydiatkylsiloxane, a filler, and catalyst. Part 2 typically includes a hydride-containing polydialkylsiloxane and optionally, a vinyl-containing polydialkylsiloxane and other additives, A reaction inhibitor may be included in Part 1 or Part 2. Mixing Part 1 and Part 2 by any suitable mixing method produces the silicone formulation. In an embodiment, the in silu adhesion promoter, such as silsesquioxane, is added to the mixed two-part system or dizring the process of mixing the two-part<br><br>
syiilem. As stated earlier, the in silu adhesion promoter is added to the conventional, commei-cially prepared silicone polymer prior to vtilcanizalion. In an exemplary embodiment, the two-parl system and the in sit^l adliesion promoter are mixed in a mixing device. In an example, the mixing device is a mixer in an injection molder. In another example, the mixing device is a mixer, such as a dough mixer, Ross mixer, two-roll mill, or Drabender mixer. In conlrabt Ui adding the in situ adhesion promoter during or after mixing and prior lo vulcanizalion, typical self-bonding silicone compositions that are commercially available incorporate an additive during an earlier stage of preparing the silicone rubber. Typically, the additive is incoiporated into the precursor while preparing the polyalkylsiloxane, and often, modifies the polyalkylsiloxane chain.<br>
hi an embodiment, the in situ adhesion promoter may include vinyl siloxanc or silsesquioxane. Jn an example, the silsesquioxane includes an organosilsesquioxane or a vinyl-containing silsesquioxane. For example, the vinyl-containhig silscsquioxanc may include RSiOj/^ units, wherein R is a vinyl group, an aJkyl group, an alkoxy group, a phenyl gi'oup, or any combination tliereof. Typically, the silsesquioxane has a vinyl content of at least about 30.0% by weight. In an embodiment, the alkyl or alkoxy gi'oup includes a Ci.6 hydi-ocarbon group, such as a methyl, ethyl, or propyl group. The in situ adhesion promoter may inchide R2Si02/: units, R3SiOi/2 units and Si04/2 units, wherein R is an alkyl radical, alkoxy radical, phenyl radical, or any combination thereof. In an embodiment, the vinyl-containing .silsesquioxane may include pre-hydrolyzed silsesquioxane prepolymers, monomers, or ohgomers.<br>
In addition, the silsesquioxane may have desirable processing properties, such as viscosity. In particular, the viscosity may provide for improved processing in situ, such as during silicone fomiulation mixing or extrusion. For example, the viscosity of tlie silsesquioxane may be about! .0 ceniistokes (cSt) to about K.O cSl, such as about 2,0 cSt to about 4.0 cSl, or about 3.0 cSt to about 7.0 cSt. In an example, the viscosity of the silsesquioxane may he up to about 100.0 cSt, or even greater than about lOO.O cSt.<br>
Typically, the addition nf the vinyl-containing silsesqtiioxane in situ adhesion promoter to the silicone composition is detectable using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).  The ^^Si NMR spectra of the sihcone formulation has two groups of distinguished peaks at about -65 ppm to about -67 ppm and about -72 ppm to about -75ppm, which coiTesponds to ViSi02/2 (OH) units and ViSiO?^units, respect ively.<br>
In an embodiment, the in situ adhesion promoter may include an ester of unsaturated aUphatic carboxylic acids. Exemplary esters of unsaturated aliphatic carboxylic acids include Ci.s alkyl esters of maleic acid and CLB alkyl esters of fumaric acid. In an embodiment, the alkyl group is methyl or ethyl. In an example, ihe maleic acid is an ester having the general formula;<br><br>
?<br>
R'O	C	C=C	C	OR'<br>
wherein R' is a Ci.s allcyl gi'oup. In an embodiment, R' is methyl or ethyl.  In a particular enil&gt;odiment. the in silu adhesion promoter is dimethyl maleate, diethyl maleaie, or any combination thereof.<br>
Jn an embodiment, one or mord of the abt&gt;ve-meniioned in siUi adhesion promoters may be added to the silicone formulation, For instance, the in situ adhesion promoter may include a mixture of the silsesquioxane and the ester of unsaturated aliphatic carboxylic acid. In an embodiment, the silsesiquioxane is an organosilsesquioxane wherein the organo gi'Oiip is a CMS alkyl. In an embodiment, the in situ adhesion promoler is a mixture of the organosilsesqiiioxane and diethyl maleate. In another embodiment, the in situ adhesion promoter is a. mixture of the organosilsesquioxane and dimethyl maleate. In a particular embodiment, the mixture of the organosilsesquioxane and the ester of unsaturate aliphatic carboxylic acid is a weight ratio of about 1,5 : 1.0 to about 1.0; 1.0.<br>
Generally, the in situ adhesion promoter is present in an effective amount to provide an adhesive fomuilation which bonds to substi'ates. In an embodiment, an "effective amount" is about 0.1 weight % to about5,0 weight %, such as about 0.1 wl% to about 3.0 wt%, such as about 1.0 wt%to about 3.0 wt%. or about 0.2 wt% to about I.O wt% of the total weight of the silicone polymer.<br>
The silicone composition containing the in situ adhesion promoter may exhibit improved adhesion to substrates. Typical subslrates include polymeric materials such as thennoplastics and therniosets. An exemplary polymeric material may include polyatnide. polyaramide, polyimide, polyolefin, polyvinylchloride, aci7lic polymer, diene monomer polymer, polycarbonate (PC), polyetheretherketone (PEEK.), poly ether imide (Ultem), polyphenylsulfone (Radel), tluoropolymer, polyester, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyurethane, themioplastic blends, or any combination thereof. Further polymeric materials may include silicones, phenolics, epoxys, glass-filled nylon, or any combination thereof. In a paniculai- embodiment, the substrate includes PC, PEEK., fluoropolymer, or any combination thereof. The silicone composition and the substrate can be used to form any usefiil article. To form a useftil article, the polymeric substrate may be processed. Processing of the polymeyic substrate, particularly the thcraioplastic substrates, may include casting, extiiiding or skiving,<br><br>
In an example, the substrate is a fluoropolymer. An exemplary fluoropolymer may be formed of a homttpolymer, copolymer, lerpolymcr, or polymer blend fomied from a monomer, such as tetrafluoroethylene, hexafluoropropylene. chlorotrifluoroethylene, trifltioroethylene, vinylidene fluoride, vinyl fluoride, perfluoropropyl vinyl ether, periluoromelhyl vinyl ether, or any combination thereof. For exaniple, the fluoropolymer is polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). In an embodiment, the polytetrafluoroetbylene (PTFE) may be paste extruded, skived, expanded, biaxially stretched, or an oriented polymeric film.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the fluoropolymer is a heat-shrinicable poly tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The heal-slirinkablc PTFE of the disclosure has a stretch ratio not greater than about 4:1, such between about 1.5:1 and about 2.5;l. In an exemplary embodiment, the hcat-shrinkable PTFE is not stretched to a node and fibrilc stnicturc, In contrast, expanded PTFE is generally biaxially expanded at ratios of about 4:1 to form node and tibrile stnicturcs. Rence, the heat-shririkablc PTFE of tlie disclosttrc maintains chemical resistance as well as achieves tlcxibility.<br>
Further exemplary fluoropoiymers include a fluorinated ethylene propylene copolymer (FEP), a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and perfluoropropyl vinyl ether (PFA), a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and perfluoromethyl vinyl ether (MFA), a copolymer of ethylene and letranuorc&gt;ethylene(ETFE), a copolymer of ethylene andchlorotrinuoroethylene(ECTFF,), polychlorotrifltioroethylene (PCTFE), poly vinylidene fluoride (PVDF), a terpolymer including tetrafluoroethylene, hexafluoropropylene, and vinylidenefluoride (THV), or any blend or any alloy thereof For example, the fluoropolymer may incltide FEP. In a further example, the fluoropolymer may include PVDF. In an exemplary embodiment, the fluoropolymer may be a polymer crosshnkable through radiation, such as e-beam, An exemplary crosslinkable fluoropolymer may include ETFE, THV, PVDF, or any combination thereof A THV resin is available fram Dyneon 3M Corporation Minneapolis, Minn, An ECTFR polymer is available from Ausimont Corporation (Italy) under the trade name Halar. Other fluoropolymers used herein may be obtained fi'om Daikin (Japan) and DuPont (USA). In particular, FEP fluoropolymers are commercially available from Daikin, such as NP-12X.<br>
Other substrates include glass and metals. An exemplaiy glass may include boroaluminosilicate. silicate, aluminosilicate, or any combination thereof. An exemplary metal may include stainless steel, steel, titanium, aluminum, capper, or any combination thereof.<br>
In general, the silicone foraiLtlation including the in situ adhesion promoter exhibits desirable adhesion to a substrate without fiuther treatment of the substrate surface. Alternatively, the substrate may he treated to tijilher enhance adhesion. In an embodiment, the adhesion between the substrate and the silicone composition may be improved through the use of a variety of commercially available surface treatment of the substrate. An exemplary surface treatment may include chemical etch, physical-mechanical etch, plasma etch, corona treatment, chemical vapor deposition, or any combination thereof In an embodiment, the chemical elch includes sodium ammonia and sodium naphthalene. An exemplary physical-mechanical elch may include sandblasting and air abrasion. In<br><br>
anoUier embodiment, plasma etching includes reactive plasmas such as hydi'ogen, oxygen, acetylene, methane, and mixtures thei-eof with nitrogen, argon, and helium. Corona irealmeiil may include the reactive hydi-ocarhon vapors such as acetone. In an embodiment, the chemical vapor deposition includes the use of aeiylates, vinylidene chloride, and acetone. Onee the article is fomied, the article may be subjected to a post-cure U^eatment, such as a ihennal treatment or radiative curing. Thermal treatment typically occurs at a temperature of about 125^0 to aboiu 200*^0. In an embodiment, the tliennal treatment is at a temperature of about ISO'^C to about 180°C. Typically, the thermal treatment occm'S fora time period of about 5 minutes to about 10 hours, such as about 10 minutes to about 30 minutes, or ahematively about 1 hour to about 4 hours,<br>
In an embodiment, radiation crosslinking or radiative curing may be performed once the article is fomied. The ludiation may be effective to crosslink the silicone composition. The uitralayer crosslinidtig of polymer moiecutes within the silicone composition provides a ctired composition and imparts structural strength to the silicone composition of the aiticle. In addition, radiation may effect a bond between the silicone composition and the substrate, stich as through inlerlayer crosslinking, In a particular embodiment, the combination of interlayer crosslinking bonds between the substrate and the silicone composition present an integrated composite that is highly resistant to dclamination, has a high quality of adhesion resistant and protective surface, incoiporates a minimum amount of adhesion resistant material, and yet, is physically substantial for convenient handling and deployment of the article. In a particular embodiment, the radiation may be ultraviolet electio magnetic radiation having a wavelength between 110 nm and AIM) nm, such as about 170 nm to about 220 nm. In an example, crossUnking may be effected using at least about 120 J/cm" radiation.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the silicone composition advantageously exhibits desirable peel strength when applied to a substrate. In particular, the peel strength may be significandy high or the layered strticttire may exhibit cohesive failure during testing. "Cohesive failui"e" as used herein indicates that the silicone composition or the substrate mptures before the bond between the silicone composition and the subsU'ate fails. In an embodiment, the article has a peel strength of at least about 0.9 pounds per inch (ppi), or even enough to lead to cohesive failure, when tested in standard "180""-Peel configuration at room temperature prior to any post-cure, or may have a peel strength of at least about 10.0 ppi after post-cure treatment when adhered to a polymeric substrate. For example, before post-cure treatment, the silicone composition may exhibit a peel strength of at least about 0.6 ppi. such as at least about 1,2 ppi, such as at least about 4.0 ppi, such as at least about 10.0 ppi, such as at least abotit 14.0 ppi. or even at least about 20.0 ppi when adhered to polycarbonate. After treatment, the silicone composition may exhibit a peel strength of al least about 10.0 ppi, such as at least about 16.0 ppi, such as at least about 20.0 ppi. such as at least about 29.0 ppi, such as at least about 35,0 ppi. such as at least about 50.0 ppi, or even cohesively fail during the lest when adhered to polycarbonate. In another example, the peel strength of the article may be at least about 1.6 ppi, such as at least abotit 2.0 ppi, such as at least about 5.0 ppi. such as at least about 7.0 ppi, such as at least about 11.0 ppi, such as al least about 13.0 ppi. such as at least about 20.0 ppi, or even enough to lead to cohesively fail during testing when the substrate is polyetheretherkelone and prior to any post-cure. Wlien the substrate is<br><br>
polye the retherke tone, the article may have a peel strength ofal least about 2.9 ppi, such as atlenst about 8.0 ppi, such as at least about 12.0 ppi, such as al least about 20.0 ppi, such as at least about 25.0 ppi, stich as at least about 55.0 ppi, such as at least about 64.0 ppi, or even enough to lead to cohesively fail during testing after post-cure treatment. When the substrate is polyester, the article may have a peel strength of al least about 0.8 ppi, such as at least about 2.6 ppi, such as at least about 9,0 ppi, such as al least about 15.0 ppi, such as about 22.0 ppi or even cohesively fail prior to any post-cure. After treatment, the silicone composition may exhibit a peel stiength of at least about 50.0 ppi, such as at least about 65.0 ppi, such as at least about 80.0 ppi, or even cohesively fail during the test when adhered to polyester. When the substrate is polyetherimide, the article may have a peel strength of at least about 1.8 ppi, such as at least about 3.0, such as at least about 8.5 ppi, such as at least about 20.0 ppi, or even cohesively fail prior to any post-cure. After treatment, the silicone composition may exhibit a peel strength of at least about 17.0 ppi, suchasatleast about 40.0 ppi, such as at least about 63.5 ppi. or even cohesively fail when adhered to polyetherimide. When the substrate is polypheny Is ulfone, the article may have a peel strengQi of at least about 3,2 ppi, such as at least about 26.0 ppi, or even cohesively fail prior to any post-cure. ARer treatment, the silicone composition may exhibit a peel sti-ength of at least about 51.0 ppi, such as at least about 75.0 ppi, or even cohesively fail when adhered to polyphenylsulfbne.<br>
In addition to desirable peel strength, the silicone compositions have advantageous physical properties, such as improved elongation-at-break, tensile strength, or teai- strength. Elongation-at-hreak and tensile strength are dctennincd using an Instron instrument in accordance with ASTM D-412 testing methods. For example, the silicone composition may exhibit an elongation-at-break of at least about 350%, such as at least about 500%, at least about 550%, at least about 600%, at least about 650%, or even at least about 700%. In an embodiment, the tensile strength of the silicone composition is greater than about 400 psi, and in particular. Is at least about 1100 psi, such as at least about 1200 psi, such as at least about 1250 psi, or even at least about 1500 psi. Paiticular embodiments exhibit a desirable combination of elongation and tensile strength, such as exhibiting a tensile strength of at least about 800 psi and an elongation of at least about 500%. Further, the silicone composition may have a tear strength greater than about 100 ppi, such as at least about 150 ppi, such as at least about 225 ppi, such as at least about 250 ppi, or even al least about 300 ppi,<br>
The silicone formulation can be used to form articles such as monolayer articles, multilayer articles, or can be ]aminated. coated, or formed on a substrate. In an example, the silicone formulation may be used to fonn a multilayer film or tape. The silicone fomiulation may be used as a film or tape to provide a barrier layer or a chemical resistant layer. Alternatively, the silicone fonnulation may be used to form an irregularly shaped article. Further, the silicone fomiuladon may be used to form fabrics, reinforcements, or foams. Fabrics and reinforcement articles may include glass mats, fiberglass, and polymeric braids such as polyamide or polyester braids.<br>
In an embodiment, the article includes a silicone formulation of liquid silicone rubber (LSR) or high consistency rubber (HCR). The article may include processing of the liquid silicone rubber or<br><br>
high consistency gum rubber. For example, processing ofLhe liqtiid silicone rubber may include any suilable method such as co(npresj;ion molding, overmoldtng, liquid inJGClion molding;, co-processing of the LSR with a thermoplastic material, coating, or processing as a thin film, In another example, processing of the higli consistency rubber may include any suitable method such as extrusion, jacketing, braiding, processing as a lilm, compression molding, and overmoldtng.<br>
Applications for the silicone formulations arc numerous. The silicone formulation may be used as laminates, tie layera, insulators, medical devices, silicone adhesives, coated fabrics, and tubing and hoses. For instance, the silicone fonnulation may be used as a laminate to produce articles such as, for example, multilayer films, barrier and chemical resislaiit films, anaJjIical septa, and bearings. An ejcemplaiy multilayer film includes a PTFE layer, a silicone fonnulation layer, and a metal layer. Another exemplaiy multilayer film includes a PTFE layer, a silicone foiTniilation layer, and a thcnnoplastic layer.<br>
The silicone fomiulation may be used as an insulator. The silicone formulation may be used to produce articles such as, for example, wires and cables, electrical and thennal insulators, insulators for high temperature applications, and insulators to control heal transfer. In an example, the silicone fomiulation is used with a nielal as the substi'ate.<br>
Further, the silicone formulation may be used in medical devices. The silicone fonnulation may be used to produce articles such as two-component medical devices. Exemplary medical devices include surgical tools or any suitable application for operator comfort. Tn an example, the medical device may include a thermoplastic and the silicone formulation. In another example, tlie medical device may include a metal and the silicone formulation.<br>
In another example, the silicone formulation may be used as a silicone adhesive, Parlictilariy, ihe silicone formulation may be used as a bonding agent for cured silicone nibber. In an example, the silicone formulation may be used to bond a silicone to another silicone. In another example, the silicone forauilalion may be used Lo bond another material to a silicone, such as a lie layer to bond a thermoplastic to a silicone. The silicone formulation may also be used to bond surface modified lluoropolymer to metal, such as sodium naphthalene etched PTFE to steel.<br>
The silicone formtilation may be used for coated fabrics. The silicone formulation may be used to produce coated articles such as temperature resist ai-ticles, non-stick bakeware, heat-resistant gloves. or protective coatings for glass. In an example, the silicone formulaiion is used to coat fiberglass,<br>
In yet anoliier embodiment, the silicone fomiuiation may be used to produce tubing and hoses. The silicone formulation can be used as tubing or hosing to produce chemically resistant pump tubing. reinforced hosing, chemically resistant hosing, braided hosing, and low penneabiiity hosing and tubing, In a particular embodiment, the aiiicle may be a monolayer tube or multilayer tube. For example, the multi-layer tube may include a liner and a cover. The liner may include a low surface energy polymer, for example, a fluoropolymer. The cover may inchide the silicone composition and directly contacts<br><br>
the liner. In an exemplary embodiment, (he muUi-Uyer tube also may include an intermediate layer sandwiched between the liner and the cover. The intermediate layer may include, for example, an adhesive layer.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. L, the silicone fonuulation is used to produce a multi-layer mbe 100. The multi-layer tube 100 is an elongated annular stnicUirc with a hollow central bore. The multi-layer tube 100 incltidcs a cover 102 and a liner 104. The cover 102 is directly in contact with and may be directly bonded to a liner 104 along an outer surface 108 of the liner 104. For example, the cover 102 may directly bond to the liner 104 without intervening adhesive layers. In an exemplary embodiment, the multi-layer tube 100 includes two layers, such as the cover 102 and the liner 104, In an exemplary embodiment, the Jiner 104 is a fliioropolymer.<br>
Alternatively, a multi-layer tube 200 may include Iwo or more layers, such as three layers. For Gx-drnp)e, FIG, 2 illustrates a third layer 206 sandwiched between Jiner 204 and cover 202. In an exemplary embodiment, third layer 206 is directly in contact with and may be directly bonded to the outer surface 208 of the liner 204. In such an example, the third layer 206 may directly contact and may be bonded to cover 202 along an outer surface 210 of third layer 206, In an embodiment, the third layer 206 may be an adhesive layer<br>
Returning to FIG, i, tlie multi-layer tube 100 may be formed through a method wherein the elastomeric cover 102 is extruded over the liner 104. The liner 104 includes an inner smface 112 that defines a central lumen of the tube. In an exemplary embodiment, the liner 104 may be a paste-extruded fluoropolymer. Paste extrusion is a process that inchides extniding a paste of a lubricant and a PTFE powder. Typically, the PTFE powder is a fine powder fihrillated by application of shearing forces. This paste is extruded at low temperature (not exceeding 75'^C). In an embodiment, the pasts is extnided in the form of a tube. Once the paste is extruded, the PTFE may be stretched to a ratio of less than about 4:1 to form heat shrinkable PTFE. In an embodiment, the multi-layer tube 100 may be produced without the use of a mandrel during the laminating process, and the heat-shrink PTFE linei- is produced without mandi'cl wrapping.<br>
Prior 10 exhTJsion of the cover 102, adhesion between the liner 104 and the cover 102 may be improved thi'ough the use of a surface treatment of the outer surface 108 of die liner 104. In an embodiment, radiation ci'osslinking may be perfonued once the multi-layer tube 100 is tbrmed.<br>
hi general, the cover 102 has greater thickness than the liner 104. The total tube thickness of the multi-layer Uibe 100 may be at least about 3 mils to about 50 mils, such as about 3 mils to about 20 mils, or about 3 mils to about 10 mils. In an embodiment, the liner 104 has a thickness of about 1 rail to about 20 mils, such as about 3 mils to about 10 mils, or about 1 mil to about 2 mils.<br>
Once formed and cured, particular embodiments of the above-disclosed multi-layer tube advantageously exhibit desired properties such as increased lifetime and flow stability. For example, the multi-layer tube may have a pump life of greater than about 250 hours, such as greater than about<br><br>
350 hours. In an embodiment, a mnlti-layer Uibe including a liner iomied of a hcai-shrinkable fluoropolymer is parlicularly advantageous, pmviding improved lileLime. In a ruriher embodiment, a liner Ibnned of a sodium-napthalene etched heat-shrinkable fluoropolymer is panicularly advantageous, reducing delamination of the liner and the coating,<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, ihe multi-layer tube may have less than about 30% loss in the dclivei7 rate when tested for flow stability, in particular, the loss in the delivery rate may be less than about 60%, such as less than about 40%, or such as less than about 30%, when tested at 600 rpm on a standai'd pump head.<br>
