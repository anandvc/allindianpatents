Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to l-(2-(aiylmethoxy)ethyl)-lH-tetrazole-5-; thiols of the formula (I),<br><br>
wherein R1 R2, R3 are same or different and independently represent hydrogen, (C1-C4)alkoxy, aryl(C1-C4)alkoxy or substituted aryl(C1-C4)alkoxy group; aryl group represents five or six membered aromatic group.<br>
The present invention also provide a process for the preparation of the compound of the formula (I) and it use.<br>
The 1 -(2-(arylmethoxy)ethyl)-1 H-tetrazole-5-thiols of formula (I) are useful as intermediates in the preparation of 1-oxacephalosporins of the formula<br>
en), <br>
wherein R is difluoromethyl or monofluoromethyl; R4 is hydrogen or a counter ion, or a carboxy-protecting group or an ester which forms a prodrug.<br>
The 1-oxacephalosporins of the formula (II) are useful as bacterial growth inhibitors on human, animal, plant, perishable objects. They are useful for treating or preventing human, veternary, or poultry infections caused by sensitive Gram-positive bacteria or Gram-negative bacteria. They are stable and effective against<br>
bacteria resistant to other p-lactam antibiotics.<br><br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In view of the vital pharmacological activities of 1-oxacephalosporins of the formula (II), various methods of preparation were reported (Tsuji, T.; Marisada, M.; Hamashima, Y.; Yoshida, T. J. Antibiot. 1985, 38(4). 466; US Patent 4,532,233, 4,529,722 &amp; GB 2,144,119). In most of the cases, the 3-chloromethyl-1-oxacephem of the general formula (III) was treated with l-(2-(Hydroxyethyl)-lH-tetrazole-5-thiol of formula (IV) to get condensation product of the formula (V). The compound of the formula (V) was treated with 4-methylbenzyloxycarbonyl chloride of formula (VI) under dry condition to get the compound of the formula (VII), in which the hydroxy group was protected as a "carbonate". The protected intermediate of the formula (VII) was further modified in    several    steps    and    finally    deprotected   to    get    the    7a-methoxy-l-<br><br><br>
The limitation of the above method is that 4-methylbenzyloxycarbonyl chloride is neither commercially available nor can be produced in a conventional manufacturing facility as the production of it involves the use of "phosgene" on large scale, which is hazardous and not eco-friendly. In addition, transportation of the same is not possible without the danger of explosion. The compound has very low stability even at low temperature, which prohibits the use of the same compound on commercial scale.<br>
The use of benzyloxycarbonyl chloride as a alternative reagent in place of 4*methylbenzyloxycarbonyl chloride was reported in the literature to protect the hydroxy group. We have observed that the deprotection to get the 7a-methoxy-l-oxacephalosporin, requires hazardous reagents which are again cumbersome to use on larger scale. The reagents like stannic chloride/aluminum chloride/titanium tetrachloride in combination with excess trifluoroacetic acid only works and affords a jelly mixture wherein the isolation of the oxacephem was always difficult leading to low yield &amp; quality. We have further observed that all of the above hazardous reagents do not work if we use alone &amp; the combination is inevitable.<br>
Thus we were in search of various protected l-(2-hydroxyethyl)-lH-tetrazole-5-thiols to employ in the cephalosporin synthesis. We examined a wide variety of protecting groups, attached with l-(2-(hydroxyethyl)-lH-tetrazole-5-thiols of the formula (IV), condensed with 3-chloromethyl-l-oxacephems of the formula (III), modified in several steps like 7a-methoxylation (high pH reaction), deacylation (low pH reaction), acylation (low pH reaction) and finally deprotected all the protecting groups. All of the protecting groups failed to produce satisfactory results at either one or more of the steps mentioned above.<br>
With our continued search and intense investigation, we finally ended with the title compound of the invention of the formula (I). The compound of formula (I) was found to perform well in all of the steps of the synthetic scheme. The deprotection was smooth at the final step &amp; gave good yield of 7a-methoxy-l-oxacephalosporins as compared with the known protecting group.<br><br>
We also examined various methods of producing the said title compounds of the formula (I). Some of the approaches involve the protection of the thiol of 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-lH-tetrazole-5-thiol of the formula (IV) with various protecting groups followed by attachment of substituted arylmethyl halide, and releasing protected thiol to get the title compound of the formula (I). In another attempt, we have protected the thiol of l-(2-hydroxyethyl)-lH-tetrazole-5-thiol of the formula (IV) in the form of disulphide by dimerization. The attachment of the substituted arylmethyl halide to the above mentioned dimer led to the cleavage of the dimer to get back the starting thiol, namely l-(2-hydroxyethyl)-lH-tetrazole-5~ thiol of the formula (IV).<br>
