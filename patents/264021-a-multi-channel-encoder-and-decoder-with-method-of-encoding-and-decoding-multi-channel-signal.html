Description<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to multi channel coding<br>
schemes and, in particular, to parametric multi channel<br>
coding schemes.<br>
Background of the invention and prior art<br>
Today, two techniques dominate for exploiting the stereo<br>
redundancy and irrelevancy contained in stereophonic audio<br>
signals. Mid-Side (M/S) stereo coding [1], primarily aims<br>
at redundancy removal, and is based on the fact that since<br>
the two channels are often fairly correlated, it is better<br>
to encode the sum, and the difference between the two. More<br>
bits (relatively) can then be spent on the high power sum<br>
signal, than on the low power side (or difference) signal.<br>
Intensity stereo coding [2, 3], on the other hand, achieves<br>
irrelevancy removal by, in each subband, replacing the two<br>
signals by a sum signal and an azimuth angle. At the<br>
decoder, the azimuth parameter is used to control the<br>
spatial location of the auditory event represented by the<br>
subband sum signal. Mid-Side, and Intensity stereo are both<br>
used extensively in existing audio coding standards [4].<br>
A problem with the M/S approach towards redundancy<br>
exploitation, is that if the two components are out of<br>
phase (one is delayed relative the other) , the M/S coding<br>
gain vanishes. This is a conceptual problem, since time<br>
delays are frequent in real audio signals. For example,<br>
spatial hearing relies much on time differences between<br>
signals  (especially at low frequencies))  [5].  In audio<br><br>
2<br>
recordings, time delays may stem from both stereophonic<br>
microphone setups,  and from artificial post processing<br>
(sound effects). In Mid-Side coding, an ad-hoc solution is<br>
often used for the time delay issue: M/S coding is only<br>
employed when the power of the difference signal is less<br>
than a constant factor of that of the sum signal [1] . The<br>
alignment problem is better addressed in [6], where one of<br>
the signal components is predicted from the other. The<br>
prediction filters are derived on a frame-by-frame basis in<br>
the encoder, and are transmitted as side information. In<br>
[7], a backward adaptive alternative is considered. It is<br>
noted that the performance gain is heavily dependent on the<br>
signal type, but for certain types of signals, a dramatic<br>
gain compared to M/S stereo coding is obtained.<br>
Parametric stereo coding has received much attention lately<br>
[8-11]. Based on a core mono (single channel] coder, such<br>
parametric schemes extract the stereo (multi channel)<br>
component, and encode it separately at a relatively low<br>
bitrate. This can be seen as a generalization of Intensity<br>
stereo coding. Parametric stereo coding methods are<br>
particularly useful in the low bitrate range of audio<br>
coding, where it results in a significant increase in<br>
quality of spending only a small part of the total bit<br>
budget on the stereo component. Parametric methods are also<br>
attractive since they are extendible to the multi channel<br>
(more than two channels) case, and have the ability to<br>
offer backward compatibility: MP3 surround [12] is one such<br>
example where the multi channel data is encoded and<br>
transmitted in the auxiliary field of the data stream. This<br>
allows receivers without multi channel capabilities to<br>
decode a normal stereo signal, whereas surround enabled<br>
receivers can enjoy multi channel audio. Parametric methods<br>
often rely on extraction and encoding of different psycho<br>
acoustical cues, primarily Inter-Channel Level Differences<br>
(ICLD's) and Inter-Channel Time Differences (ICTD's). In<br>
[11], it is reported that a coherence parameter is<br>
important  for  a  natural  sounding  result.  However,<br><br>
3<br>
parametric methods are limited in the sense that at higher<br>
bit rates, the coders are not able to reach transparent<br>
quality due to the inherent modeling constraint.<br>
The problems related to parametric multi channel encoders<br>
are that their maximum obtainable quality value is limited<br>
to a threshold, which is significantly below the<br>
transparent quality. The parametric quality threshold is<br>
shown at 1100 in Fig. 11. As can be seen from a schematic<br>
curve representing the quality/bitrate dependence of a BCC<br>
enhanced mono coder (1102), the quality can not cross the<br>
parametric quality threshold 1100 irrespective of the<br>
bitrate. This means that even with an increased bitrate,<br>
the quality of such a parametric multi channel encoder<br>
cannot increase anymore.<br>
The BCC enhanced mono coder is an example for the currently<br>
existing stereo coders or multi channel coders, in which a<br>
stereo-downmix or a multi channel downmix is performed.<br>
Additionally, parameters are derived describing inter<br>
channel level relations, inter channel time relations,<br>
inter channel coherence relations etc.<br>
The parameters are different from a waveform signal such as<br>
a side signal of a Mid/Side encoder, since the side signal<br>
describes a difference between two channels in a waveform-<br>
style format compared to the parametric representation,<br>
which describes similarities or dissimilarities between two<br>
channels by giving a certain parameter rather than a<br>
sample-wise waveform representation. While parameters<br>
require a low number of bits for being transmitted from an<br>
encoder to a decoder, waveform-descriptions, i.e., residual<br>
signals being derived in a waveform-style require more bits<br>
and allow, in principle, a transparent reconstruction.<br>
Fig. 11 shows a typical quality/bitrate dependence of such<br>
a waveform-based conventional stereo coder (1104). It<br>
becomes clear from Fig. 11, that, by increasing the bitrate<br><br>
4<br>
more and more, the quality of the conventional stereo coder<br>
such as a Mid/Side stereo coder increases more and more<br>
until the quality reaches the transparent quality. There is<br>
a kind of a "cross-over bitrate", at which the<br>
characteristic curve 1102 for the parametric multi channel<br>
coder and the curve 1104 for the conventional waveform-<br>
based stereo coder cross each other.<br>
Below this cross-over bitrate, the parametric multi channel<br>
encoder is much better than the conventional stereo coder.<br>
When the same bitrate for both encoders is considered, the<br>
parametric multi channel coder provides a quality, which is<br>
higher than the quality of the conventional waveform-based<br>
stereo coder by the quality difference 1108. Stated in<br>
other words, when one wishes to have a certain quality<br>
1110, this quality can be achieved using the parametric<br>
coder by a bitrate which is reduced by a difference bitrate<br>
1112 compared to a conventional waveform-based stereo<br>
coder.<br>
Above the cross-over bitrate, however, the situation is<br>
completely different. Since the parametric coder is at its<br>
maximum parametric coder quality threshold 1100, a better<br>
quality can only be obtained by using a conventional<br>
waveform-based stereo coder using the same number of bits<br>
as in the parametric coder.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide an<br>
encoding/decoding scheme allowing increased quality and<br>
reduced bitrate compared to existing multi channel encoding<br>
schemes.<br>
In accordance with the first aspect of the present<br>
invention this object is achieved by a multi-channel<br>
encoder for encoding an original multi-channel signal<br>
having  at  least  two  channels,  comprising:    parameter<br><br>
5<br>
provider for providing one or more parameters, the one or<br>
more parameters being formed such that a reconstructed<br>
multi-channel signal can be formed using one or more<br>
downmix channels derived from the multi-channel signal and<br>
the one or more parameters; residual encoder for<br>
generating an encoded residual signal based on the original<br>
multi-channel signal, the one or more downmix channels or<br>
the one or more parameters so that the reconstructed multi-<br>
channel signal when formed using the residual signal is<br>
more similar to the original multi-channel signal than when<br>
formed without using the residual signal; and data stream<br>
former for forming a data stream having the residual signal<br>
and the one or more parameters.<br>
In accordance with a second aspect of the present<br>
invention, this object is achieved by a multi-channel<br>
decoder for decoding an encoded multi-channel signal having<br>
one or more downmix channels, one or more parameters and an<br>
encoded residual signal, comprising: a residual decoder for<br>
generating a decoded residual signal based on the encoded<br>
residual signal; and a multi-channel decoder for generating<br>
a first reconstructed multi-channel signal using one or<br>
more downmix channels and the one or more parameters,<br>
wherein the multi-channel decoder is further operative for<br>
generating a second reconstructed multi-channel signal<br>
using the one or more downmix channels and the decoded<br>
residual signal instead of the first reconstructed multi-<br>
channel signal or in addition to the first multi-channel<br>
signal, wherein the second reconstructed multi-channel<br>
signal is more similar to an original multi-channel signal<br>
than the first reconstructed multi-channel signal.<br>
In accordance with a third aspect of the present invention,<br>
this object is achieved by a multi-channel encoder for<br>
encoding an original multi-channel signal having at least<br>
two channels, comprising: a time aligner for aligning a<br>
first channel and a second channel of the at least two<br>
channels using an alignment parameter;  a downmixer for<br><br>
6<br>
generating a downmix channel using the aligned channels; a<br>
gain calculator for calculating a gain parameter not equal<br>
to one for weighting an aligned channel so that the<br>
difference between the aligned channels is reduced compared<br>
to a gain value of 1; and a data stream former for forming<br>
a data stream having information on the downmix channel,<br>
information on the alignment parameter and information on<br>
the gain parameter.<br>
In accordance with a fourth aspect of the present<br>
invention, this object is achieved by a multi-channel<br>
decoder for decoding an encoded multi-channel signal having<br>
information on one or more downmix channels, information on<br>
a gain parameter, and information on an alignment<br>
parameter, comprising: a downmix channel decoder for<br>
generating a decoded downmix signal; and a processor for<br>
processing the decoded downmix channel using the gain<br>
parameter to obtain a first decoded output channel and for<br>
processing the decoded downmix channel using the gain<br>
parameter and to de-align using the alignment parameter to<br>
obtain a second decoded output channel.<br>
Further aspects of the present invention include<br>
corresponding methods, data streams/files and computer<br>
programs.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that the<br>
problems related to conventional parametric encoders and<br>
waveform-based encoders are addressed by combining<br>
parametric encoding and waveform-based encoding. Such an<br>
inventive encoder generates a scaled data stream having, as<br>
a first enhancement layer, an encoded parameter<br>
representation, and having, as a second enhancement layer,<br>
an encoded residual signal, which is, preferably, a<br>
waveform-style signal. Generally, an additional residual<br>
signal, which is not provided in a pure parametric multi<br>
channel encoder allows to improve the achievable quality in<br>
particular between the cross-over bitrate in Fig. 11 and<br><br>
7<br>
the maximum transparent quality. As can be seen in Fig. 11,<br>
even below the cross-over bitrate, the inventive coder<br>
algorithm outperforms a pure parametric multi channel<br>
encoder with respect to quality at comparable bitrates.<br>
Compared to a fully waveform-based conventional stereo<br>
encoder, however, the inventive combined<br>
parameter/waveform-encoding/decoding scheme is much more<br>
bit-efficient. Stated in other words, the inventive devices<br>
optimally combine the advantages of parametric encoding and<br>
waveform-based encoding so that, even above the cross-over<br>
bitrate, the inventive coder profits from the parametric<br>
concept, but outperforms the pure parametric coder.<br>
Depending on certain embodiments, the advantages of the<br>
present invention outperform the prior art parametric coder<br>
or conventional waveform-based multi channel encoder more<br>
or less. More advanced embodiments provide a better<br>
quality/bitrate characteristic, while low-level embodiments<br>
of the present invention require less processing power in<br>
the encoder and/or decoder side, but, because of the<br>
additionally encoded residual signals, allow a better<br>
quality than a pure parametric encoder, since the quality<br>
of the pure parametric encoder is limited by the threshold<br>
quality 1100 in Fig. 11.<br>
The inventive encoding/decoding scheme is advantageous in<br>
that it is able to move seamlessly from pure parametric<br>
encoding to waveform-approximating or perfect waveform-<br>
transparent coding.<br>
Preferably, parametric stereo coding and Mid/Side stereo<br>
coding are combined into a scheme that has the ability to<br>
converge towards transparent quality. In this preferred<br>
Mid/Side stereo-related scheme, the correlation between the<br>
signal components, i.e., the left channel and the right<br>
channel are more efficiently exploited.<br><br>
8<br>
In general, the inventive idea can be applied in several<br>
embodiments to a parametric multi channel encoder. In one<br>
embodiment, the residual signal is derived from the<br>
original signal without using the parameter information<br>
also available at the encoder. This embodiment is<br>
preferable in situations, where processing power and,<br>
possibly, energy consumption of the processor are an issue.<br>
Such a situation can occur in hand-held devices having<br>
restricted power possibilities such as mobile phones, palm<br>
tops, etc. The residual signal is only derived from the<br>
original signal and does not rely on a down-mix or the<br>
parameters. Therefore, on the decoder side, the first<br>
reconstructed multi channel signal, which is generated<br>
using the down-mix channel and the parameters is not used<br>
for generating the second reconstructed multi channel<br>
signal.<br>
Nevertheless, there is some redundancy in the parameters on<br>
the one hand and the residual signal on the other hand. A<br>
redundancy-reduction can be obtained by other<br>
encoders/decoder systems, which, for calculating the<br>
encoded residual signal, make use of the parameter<br>
information available at the encoder and, optionally, also<br>
of the down-mix channel, which might also be available at<br>
the encoder.<br>
Depending on the certain situation, the residual encoder<br>
can be an analysis by synthesis device calculating a<br>
complete reconstructed multi channel signal using the down-<br>
mix channel and the parameter information. Then, based on<br>
the reconstructed signal, a difference signal for each<br>
channel can be generated so that a multi channel error<br>
representation is obtained, which can be processed in<br>
different manners. One way would be to apply another<br>
parametric multi channel encoding scheme to the multi<br>
channel error representation. Another possibility would be<br>
to perform a matrixing scheme for down-mixing the multi<br>
channel error representation. Another possibility would be<br><br>
9<br>
to delete the error signals from the left and right<br>
surround channels and to only encode the center channel<br>
error signal or, in addition, to also encode the left<br>
channel error signal and the right channel error signal.<br>
Thus, many possibilities exist for implementing a residual<br>
processor based on an error representation.<br>
The above-mentioned embodiment allows high flexibility for<br>
scalably encoding the residual signal. It is, however,<br>
quite processing-power demanding, since a complete multi<br>
channel reconstruction is performed at the encoder and an<br>
error representation for each channel of the multi channel<br>
signal is to be generated and input into the residual<br>
processor. On the decoder-side, it is necessary to firstly<br>
calculate the first reconstructed multi channel signal and<br>
then, based on the decoded residual signal, which is any<br>
representation of the error signal, the second<br>
reconstructed signal has to be generated. Thus,<br>
irrespective of the fact, whether the first reconstructed<br>
signal is to be output or not, it has to be calculated on<br>
the decoder-side.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the analysis by synthesis approach on the encoder-side and<br>
the calculation of the first reconstructed multi channel<br>
signal, irrespective of the fact, whether it is to be<br>
output or not, are replaced by a straight-forward encoder-<br>
side calculation of the residual signal. This is based on a<br>
weighted original channel, which depends on a multi channel<br>
parameter or is based on a kind of a modified down-mix<br>
which again depends on an alignment parameter. In this<br>
scheme, the additional information, i.e., the residual<br>
signal is non-iteratively calculated using the parameters<br>
and the original signals, but not using the one or more<br>
down-mix channels.<br><br>
10<br>
This scheme is very efficient on the encoder and decoder<br>
sides. When the residual signal is not transmitted or has<br>
been stripped off from a scaleable data stream because of<br>
bandwidth requirements, the inventive decoder automatically<br>
generates a first reconstructed multi channel signal based<br>
on the down-mix channel and the gain and alignment<br>
parameters, while, when a residual signal not equal to zero<br>
is input, the multi channel reconstructor does not<br>
calculate the first reconstructed multi channel signal, but<br>
only calculates the second reconstructed multi channel<br>
signal. Thus, this encoder/decoder scheme is advantageous<br>
in that it allows for a quite efficient calculation on the<br>
encoder side as well as the decoder side, and uses the<br>
parameter representation for reducing the redundancy in the<br>
residual signal so that a very processing power-efficient<br>
and bitrate-efficient encoding/decoding scheme is obtained.<br>

Detailed description of the preferred embodiments<br>
Fig. 1 shows a preferred embodiment of a multi channel<br>
encoder for encoding an original multi channel signal<br>
having at least two channels. The first channel may be a<br>
left channel 10a, and the second channel may be a right<br>
channel 10b in a stereo environment. Although the inventive<br><br>
12<br>
embodiments are described in the context of a stereo<br>
scheme, the extension to a multi channel scheme is<br>
straight-forward, since a multi channel representation<br>
having for example five channels has several pairs of a<br>
first channel and a second channel. In the context of a 5.1<br>
surround scheme, the first channel can be the front left<br>
channel, and the second channel can be the front right<br>
channel. Alternatively, the first channel can be the front<br>
left channel, and the second channel can be the center<br>
channel. Alternatively, the first channel can be the center<br>
channel and the second channel can be the front right<br>
channel. Alternatively, the first channel can be the rear<br>
left channel (left surround channel), and the second<br>
channel can be the rear right channel (right surround<br>
channel).<br>
An inventive encoder can include a down-mixer 12 for<br>
generating one or more down-mix channels. In the stereo-<br>
environment, the down-mixer 12 will generate a single down-<br>
mix channel. In a multi channel environment, however, the<br>
down-mixer 12 can generate several down-mix channels. In a<br>
5.1 multi channel environment, the down-mixer 13 preferably<br>
generates two down-mix channels. Generally, the number of<br>
down-mix channels is smaller than the number of channels in<br>
the original multi channel signal.<br>
The inventive multi channel encoder also includes a<br>
parameter provider 14 for providing one or more parameters,<br>
the one or more parameters being formed such that a<br>
reconstructed multi channel signal can be formed using the<br>
one or more down-mix channels derived from the multi-<br>
channel signal and the one or more parameters.<br>
Importantly, the inventive multi channel encoder further<br>
includes a residual encoder 16 for generating an encoded<br>
residual signal. The encoded residual signal is generated<br>
based on the original multi channel signal, the one or more<br>
down-mix channels or the one or more parameters. Generally,<br><br>
13<br>
the encoded residual signal is generated such that the<br>
reconstructed multi channel signal when formed using the<br>
residual signal is more similar to the original multi<br>
channel signal than when formed without the residual<br>
signal. Thus, the encoded residual signal allows that the<br>
decoder generates a reconstructed multi channel signal<br>
having a higher quality than the parametric quality<br>
threshold 1100 shown in Fig. 11. The one or more parameters<br>
and the encoded residual signal are input into a data<br>
stream former 18, which forms a data stream having the<br>
residual signal and the one or more parameters. Preferably,<br>
the data stream output by the data stream former 18 is a<br>
scaled data stream having a first enhancement layer<br>
including information on the one or more parameters and a<br>
second enhancement layer including information on the<br>
encoded residual signal. As it is known in the art, the<br>
different scaling layers in a scaled data stream can be<br>
decoded individually so that a low-level device such as a<br>
pure-parametric decoder is in the position to decode the<br>
scaled data stream by simply ignoring the second<br>
enhancement layer.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the scaled data<br>
stream further includes, as a base layer, the one or more<br>
down-mix channels. The present invention, is, however, also<br>
applicable in an environment, in which the user is already<br>
in the possession of the down-mix channel. This situation<br>
can occur, when the down-mix channel is a mono or stereo<br>
signal, which the user has already received via another<br>
transmission channel or via the same transmission channel<br>
but earlier compared to the reception of the first<br>
enhancement layer and the second enhancement layer. When<br>
there is a separate transmission of the down-mix channel(s)<br>
and the first and second enhancement layers, the encoder<br>
does not necessarily have to include the down-mixer 12.<br>
This situation is indicated by the dashed line of the down-<br>
mixer block.<br><br>
14<br>
Additionally, the parameter provider 14 does not<br>
necessarily have to actually calculate the parameters based<br>
on the first and the second original channel. In<br>
situations, in which the parameters for a certain channel<br>
signal already exists, it is sufficient to provide the<br>
already generated parameters to the Fig. 1 encoder so that<br>
these parameters are supplied to the data stream former 18<br>
and to the residual encoder to be optionally used for<br>
calculation of the residual signal and to be introduced<br>
into the scaled data stream. Preferably, however, the<br>
residual encoder additionally, uses the parameters as shown<br>
by a dashed connecting line 19.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
residual encoder 16 can be controlled via a separate<br>
bitrate control input. In this case, the residual encoder<br>
comprises a certain lossy encoder such as a quantizer<br>
having a controllable quantizer step size. When a large<br>
quantizer step size is signaled via the bitrate control<br>
input, the encoded residual signal will have a smaller<br>
value range (the largest quantization index output by the<br>
quantizer) compared to a case, in which a smaller quantizer<br>
step size is signaled via the bitrate control input. The<br>
large quantizer step size will result in a lower bit demand<br>
for the encoded residual signal and, therefore, will result<br>
in a scaled data stream having a reduced bitrate compared<br>
to the case, in which the quantizer within the residual<br>
encoder 16 has a smaller quantizer step size resulting in<br>
an encoded residual signal needing more bits.<br>
Strictly speaking, the above remarks apply to scalar<br>
quantization. Generally stated, however, it is preferred to<br>
use an encoder having controllable resolution, which is<br>
based on a vector quantization technique. When the<br>
resolution is high, more bits are required for encoding the<br>
residual signal compared to the case, in which the<br>
resolution is low.<br><br>
15<br>
Fig. 2 shows a preferred embodiment of an inventive multi<br>
channel decoder, which can be used in connection with the<br>
Fig. 1 encoder. In particular, Fig. 2 shows a multi channel<br>
decoder for decoding an encoded multi channel signal having<br>
one or more down-mix channels, one or more parameters and<br>
an encoded residual signal. All this information, i.e., the<br>
down-mix channel, the parameters and the encoded residual<br>
signals are included in a scaled data stream 20 input into<br>
a data stream parser which extracts the encoded residual<br>
signal from the scaled data stream 20 and forwards the<br>
encoded residual signal to a residual decoder 22.<br>
Analogously, the one ore more preferably encoded down-mix<br>
channels are provided to a down-mix decoder 24.<br>
Additionally, the preferably encoded one or more parameters<br>
are provided to a parameter decoder 23 to provide the one<br>
or more parameters in a decoded form. The information<br>
output by the blocks 22, 23 and 24 are input into a multi<br>
channel decoder 25 for generating a first reconstructed<br>
multi channel signal 26 or a second reconstructed multi<br>
channel signal 27. The first reconstructed multi channel<br>
signal is generated by the multi channel decoder 25 using<br>
the one or more down-mix channels and the one or more<br>
parameters, but not using the residual signal. The second<br>
reconstructed multi channel signal 27, however, is<br>
generated using the one or more down-mix channels and the<br>
decoded residual signal. Since the residual signal includes<br>
additional information, and, preferably, waveform<br>
information, the second reconstructed multi channel signal<br>
27 is more similar to an original multi channel signal<br>
(such as channels 10a and 10b of Fig. 1) than the first<br>
reconstructed multi channel signal.<br>
Depending on the certain implementation of the multi<br>
channel decoder 25, the multi channel decoder 25 will<br>
output either the first reconstructed channel 26 or the<br>
second reconstructed multi channel signal 27.<br>
Alternatively, the multi channel decoder 25 calculates the<br>
first reconstructed multi channel signal in addition to the<br><br>
16<br>
second reconstructed multi channel signal. Naturally, in<br>
all implementations the multi channel decoder 25 will only<br>
output the first reconstructed multi channel signal, when<br>
the scaled data stream includes the encoded residual<br>
signal. When, however, the scaled data stream is processes<br>
on its way from the encoder to the decoder by stripping the<br>
second enhancement layer, the multi channel decoder 25 will<br>
only output the first reconstructed multi channel signal.<br>
Such stripping of the second enhancement layer may take<br>
place, when there was a transmission channel on the way<br>
between the encoder and the decoder, which had highly<br>
limited bandwidth resources so that a transmission of the<br>
scale data stream was only possible without the second<br>
enhancement layer.<br>
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 illustrate one embodiment of the<br>
inventive concept, which requires only a reduced processing<br>
power on the encoder side (Fig. 3) as well as on the<br>
decoder side (Fig. 4). The Fig. 3 encoder includes an<br>
intensity stereo encoder 30, which outputs a mono down-mix<br>
signal on the one hand and parametric intensity stereo<br>
direction information on the other hand. The mono down-mix,<br>
which is preferably formed by adding the first and the<br>
second input channel are input into a data rate reducer 31.<br>
For the mono down-mix channel, the data rate reducer 31 may<br>
include any of the well-known audio encoders such as an MP3<br>
encoder, an AAC encoder or any other audio encoder for mono<br>
signals. For the parametric direction information, the data<br>
rate reducer 31 may include any of the known encoders for<br>
parametric information such as a difference encoder, a<br>
quantizer and/or an entropy encoder such as a Huffman<br>
encoder or an arithmetic encoder. Thus, blocks 30 and 31 of<br>
Fig. 3 provide the functionalities schematically<br>
illustrated by blocks 12 and 14 of the Fig. 1 encoder.<br>
The residual encoder 16 includes a side signal calculator<br>
32 and a subsequently applied data rate reducer 33. The<br>
side  signal  calculator  32  performs  a  side  signal<br><br>
17<br>
calculation known from prior art Mid/Side stereo encoders.<br>
One preferred example is a sample-wise difference<br>
calculation between the first channel 10a and the second<br>
channel 10b to obtain a waveform-type side signal, which<br>
is, then, input into the data rate reducer 33 for data rate<br>
compression. The data rate reducer 33 can include the same<br>
elements as outlined above with respect to the data rate<br>
reducer 31. At the output of block 33, an encoded residual<br>
signal is obtained, which is input into the data stream<br>
former 18 so that a preferably scaled data stream is<br>
obtained.<br>
The data stream output by block 18 now includes, in<br>
addition to the mono down-mix, parametric intensity stereo<br>
direction information as well as a waveform-type encoded<br>
residual signal.<br>
The data rate reducer 31 can be controlled by a bitrate<br>
control input as already discussed in connection with Fig.<br>
1. In another embodiment, the data rate reducer 33 is<br>
arranged for generating a scaled output data stream which<br>
has, in its base layer, a residual encoded with a low<br>
number of bits per sample, and which has, in its first<br>
enhancement layer, a residual encoded with a medium number<br>
of bits per sample, and which has, in its next enhancement<br>
layer, a residual encoded with an again higher number of<br>
bits per sample. For the base layer of the data rate<br>
reducer output, one can, for example, use 0.5 bits per<br>
sample. For the first enhancement layer one can use for<br>
example 4 bits for sample, and for the second enhancement<br>
layer, one can use, for example, 16 bits per sample.<br>
A corresponding decoder is shown in Fig. 4. The data stream<br>
input into the data stream parser 21 is parsed to<br>
separately output parameter information to the decompressor<br>
23. The encoded down-mix information is input into the<br>
decompressor 24, and the encoded residual signal is input<br>
into the residual decompressor 22.  The Fig.  4 decoder<br><br>
18<br>
further includes a straight-forward intensity stereo<br>
decoder 40 and, in addition, a Mid/Side decoder 41. Both<br>
decoders 40 and 41 perform the functions of the multi<br>
channel decoder 25 to output the first reconstructed multi<br>
channel signal 26, which is solely generated by the<br>
intensity stereo decoder 40, and to output the second<br>
reconstructed multi channel signal 27, which is solely<br>
generated by the MS decoder 41.<br>
When the data stream includes an encoded residual signal,<br>
the straight-forward implementation in Fig. 4 would output<br>
the first reconstructed multi channel 26 as well as the<br>
second reconstructed multi channel signal. Naturally, only<br>
the better second reconstructed multi channel signal 27 is<br>
interesting for the user in this situation. Therefore, a<br>
decoder control 42 can be provided for sensing, whether<br>
there is an encoded residual signal in the data stream.<br>
When it is sensed, that no such encoded residual signal is<br>
in the data stream, the decoder control 42 is operative to<br>
deactivate the mid/side decoder 40 to save processing power<br>
and, therefore, battery power which is especially useful in<br>
a low-power hand-held device such as a mobile phone etc.<br>
Fig. 5 shows another embodiment of the present invention,<br>
in which the encoded residual signal is generated on the<br>
basis of an analysis-by-synthesis approach. Again, the<br>
first and the second channels 10a, 10b are input into a<br>
downmixer 50, which is followed by a data rate reducer 51.<br>
At the output of block 51, a preferably compressed downmix<br>
signal having one or more downmix channels is obtained and<br>
supplied to the data stream former 18. Thus, blocks 50 and<br>
51 provide the functionality of the downmixer device 12 of<br>
Fig. 1. Additionally, the first and the second input<br>
channels 10a, 10b are supplied to a parameter calculator 53<br>
and the parameters output by the parameter calculator are<br>
forwarded to another data rate reducer 54 for compressing<br>
the one or more parameters. Thus, blocks 53 and 54 provide<br><br>
19<br>
the same functionality as the parameter provider 14 in Fig.<br>
1.<br>
In contrast to the Fig. 3 embodiment, however, the residual<br>
encoder 16 is more sophisticated. In particular, the<br>
residual encoder 16 includes a parametric multi-channel<br>
reconstructor 55. The multi-channel reconstructor<br>
generates, for the two-channel example, a first<br>
reconstructed channel and a second reconstructed channel.<br>
Since the parametric multi-channel reconstructor only uses<br>
the downmix channels and the parameters, the quality of the<br>
reconstructed multi-channel signal output by block 55 will<br>
correspond to curve 1102 in Fig. 11 and will always be<br>
below the parametric threshold 1100 in Fig. 11.<br>
The reconstructed multi-channel signal is input into an<br>
error calculator 56. The error calculator 56 is operative<br>
to also receive the first and the second input channel 10a<br>
and 10b, and outputs a first error signal and a second<br>
error signal. Preferably, the error calculator calculates a<br>
sample-wise difference between an original channel and a<br>
corresponding reconstructed channel (output block 55). This<br>
procedure is performed for each pair of original channel<br>
and reconstructed channel. The output of the error<br>
calculator 56 is - again - a multi-channel representation,<br>
but now, in contrast to the original multi-channel signal,<br>
a multi-channel error signal. This multi-channel error<br>
signal having the same number of channels as the original<br>
multi-channel signal is input into a residual processor 57<br>
for generating the encoded residual signal.<br>
There exist numerous implementations of the residual<br>
processor 57, which all depend on bandwidth requirements,<br>
required degree of scalability, quality requirements, etc.<br>
In one preferred implementation, the residual processor 57<br>
is again implemented as a multi-channel encoder generating<br>
one or more error downmix channels and error downmix<br><br>
20<br>
parameters. This embodiment can be said to be a kind of an<br>
iterative multi-channel encoder, since the residual<br>
processor 57 might include blocks 50, 51, 53 and 54.<br>
Alternatively, the residual processor 57 can be operative<br>
to only select a single or two error channels from its<br>
input signal, which have the highest energy and to only<br>
process the highest energy error signal to obtain the<br>
encoded residual signal. In addition or instead of this<br>
criterion, more advanced criteria can be used which are<br>
based on perceptually more motivated error measures.<br>
Alternatively, the residual processor might include a<br>
matrixing scheme for downmixing the input channels into one<br>
ore more downmix channels so that a corresponding decoder-<br>
device would perform an analogue dematrixing procedure. The<br>
one or more downmix channels can then be processed using<br>
elements of a well-known mono or stereo encoder or can be<br>
completely processed using one of the above-mentioned<br>
mono/stereo encoders to obtain the encoded residual signal.<br>
A decoder for the Fig. 5 encoder is shown in Fig. 6.<br>
Compared to the Fig. 2 embodiment, Fig. 6 reveals that the<br>
multi-channel decoder 25 includes a parametric multi-<br>
channel reconstructor 60 and a combiner 61. The parametric<br>
multi-channel reconstructor 60 generates the first<br>
reconstructed multi-channel signal 26 only based on a<br>
decoded downmix and decoded parameter information. The<br>
first reconstructed signal 26 can be output, when no<br>
encoded residual signal is included in the data stream.<br>
When, however, an encoded residual signal is included in<br>
the data stream, the first reconstructed signal is not<br>
output but input into a combiner 61 for combining the<br>
parametrically reconstructed multi-channel signal 26 to the<br>
decoded residual signal which is one of the representations<br>
of the error representation at the output of the error<br>
calculator 56 of Fig. 5 as discussed above. The combiner 61<br>
combines the decoded residual signal, i.e., any<br>
representation of the error signal and the parametrically<br><br>
21<br>
reconstructed multi-channel signal to output the second<br>
reconstructed signal 27. When the Fig. 6 decoder is<br>
considered with respect to Fig. 11, it becomes clear that,<br>
for a certain bitrate, the first reconstructed signal has a<br>
quality determined by line 1102 while the second<br>
reconstructed signal 27 has a higher quality determined by<br>
the line 1114 for the same bitrate.<br>
The Fig. 5/Fig. 6 embodiment is preferable to the Fig.<br>
3/Fig. 4 embodiment, since the redundancy in the encoded<br>
residual signal is reduced. However, the Fig. 5/Fig. 6<br>
embodiment requires a higher amount of processing power,<br>
storage, battery resources and algorithmic delay.<br>
A preferred compromise between the Fig. 3/Fig. 4 embodiment<br>
and the Fig. 5/Fig. 6 embodiment is subsequently described<br>
with reference to Fig. 7 as to an encoder representation<br>
and Fig. 8 as to a decoder representation. The encoder<br>
includes a certain downmixer 74 for performing a downmix<br>
using the first and the second input channels 10a, 10b. In<br>
contrast to a simple downmix, which is generated by only<br>
adding both original channels 10a, 10b to obtain a mono<br>
signal, the downmixer 70 is controlled by an alignment<br>
parameter generated by a parameter calculator 71. Here,<br>
both input channels 10a, 10b, are time-aligned to each<br>
other before both signals are added to each other. In this<br>
way, a special mono signal is obtained at the output of the<br>
downmixer 70, which mono signal is different from a mono<br>
signal for example generated by a low-level intensity<br>
stereo encoder as shown at 30 in Fig. 3.<br>
In addition to the alignment parameter or instead of the<br>
alignment parameter, the parameter calculator 71 is<br>
operative to generate a gain parameter. The gain parameter<br>
is input into a weighter device 72 to preferably weight the<br>
second channel 10b using the gain parameter, before a side<br>
signal calculation is performed. Weighting the second<br>
channel before calculating the waveform-like difference<br><br>
22<br>
between the first and the second channel results in a<br>
smaller residual signal, which is shown as the special side<br>
signal input into any suitable data rate reducer 33. The<br>
data rate reducer 33 shown in Fig. 7 can be exactly<br>
implemented as the data rate reducer 33 shown in Fig. 3.<br>
The Fig. 7 embodiment is different from the Fig. 3<br>
embodiment in that parameter information is accounted for<br>
preferably in the downmixer 70 as well as the residual<br>
signal calculation so that the residual signal output by<br>
the data rate reducer 33 in Fig. 7 can be represented by a<br>
lower number of bits than the signal output by data rate<br>
reducer 33. This is due to the fact that the Fig. 7<br>
residual signal includes less redundancy than the Fig. 3<br>
residual signal.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a preferred embodiment of a decoder-<br>
implementation corresponding to the encoder-implementation<br>
in Fig. 7. Contrary to the Fig. 6 decoder, the multi-<br>
channel reconstructor 25 is operative to automatically<br>
output the first reconstructed multi-channel signal 26,<br>
when the side signal, i.e., the residual signal is zero or<br>
to automatically output the second reconstructed multi-<br>
channel signal 27, when the residual signal is not equal to<br>
zero. Thus, the Fig. 8 multi-channel reconstructor 25<br>
cannot output both signals 26 and 27 simultaneously, but<br>
can only output a first one of the two signals or a second<br>
one of the two signals. Thus, the Fig. 8 embodiment does<br>
not require any decoder control such as shown in Fig. 4.<br>
In particular, the residual signal decoder 22 in Fig. 8<br>
outputs the special side signal as generated by element 72<br>
of the corresponding encoder in Fig. 7. Additionally, the<br>
downmix decoder 24 outputs the special mono signal as<br>
generated by the downmixer 70 in Fig. 7.<br>
Then, the special side signal and the special mono signal<br>
are input into the multi-channel decoder together with the<br><br>
23<br>
gain parameter and the time alignment parameter. The gain<br>
parameter is operative to control the gain stage 84<br>
applying a gain in accordance with a first gain rule.<br>
Additionally, the gain parameter controls additional gain<br>
stages 82, 83 for applying a gain in accordance with a<br>
different second gain rule. Additionally, the multi-channel<br>
reconstructor includes a subtractor 84 and an adder 85 as<br>
well as a time de-alignment block 86 to generate a<br>
reconstructed first channel and a reconstructed second<br>
channel.<br>
Subsequently, reference is made to a preferred embodiment<br>
of the Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 encoder/decoder scheme. Fig. 9a<br>
shows a complete encoder/decoder scheme in accordance with<br>
an aspect of the present invention, in which the residual<br>
signal d(n) is not equal to zero. Additionally, Fig. 9b<br>
indicates the Fig. 9a scalable encoder/decoder, when no<br>
difference signal d(n) has been calculated, or when the<br>
data stream has been stripped off to reduce the residual<br>
signal e.g. because of a transmission bandwidth related<br>
requirement. In case of stripping off the encoded residual<br>
signal from the data stream transmitted from an encoder to<br>
a decoder in the Fig. 9a embodiment, the Fig. 9a embodiment<br>
becomes a pure parametric multi-channel scenario, in which<br>
the alignment parameter and the gain parameter are the<br>
multi-channel parameters, and the special mono signal is<br>
the downmix channel transmitted from an encoder-side to a<br>
decoder-side.<br>
The multi-channel reconstruction on the decoder-side is<br>
performed using only the alignment and gain parameters,<br>
since no residual signal is received at the decoder-side,<br>
i.e., d(n) equals zero.<br>
Fig. 9c shows the equations underlying the inventive<br>
encoder, while Fig. 9d indicates the equation underlying<br>
the inventive decoder.<br><br>
24<br>
In particular, the inventive encoder includes, as a<br>
parameter provider 14 from Fig. 1, the parameter calculator<br>
71. The parameter calculator 71 is operative to calculate a<br>
time alignment parameter for aligning the right channel<br>
r(n) to the left channel l(n). In Fig. 9a to Fig. 9d, the<br>
aligned right channel is indicated by ra(n). The alignment<br>
parameter is preferably extracted from overlapping blocks<br>
of the input signal. The alignment parameter corresponds to<br>
a time delay between the left channel and the right channel<br>
and is estimated preferably using time domain cross<br>
correlation techniques. For the case, when there is no<br>
alignment gain in a subband, for example in the case of<br>
independent signals, the delay parameter is set to zero.<br>
Preferably, one delay (time-alignment) parameter is<br>
estimated per subband in a subband structure. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, a fixed analysis rate of 46 ms and 50<br>
% overlapping Hamming windows have been employed.<br>
The parameter calculator 71 further calculates the gain<br>
value. The gain value is also preferably extracted from<br>
overlapping blocks of the signal. Normally, the gain<br>
parameter is identical to the level difference parameter<br>
commonly used in parametric coding such as the well-known<br>
binaural cue coding scheme. Alternatively, the gain value<br>
can be calculated using an iterative approach, in which the<br>
difference signal is fed back to the parameter calculator,<br>
and the gain value is set such that the difference signal<br>
reaches a minimum value as shown by a dashed line 90 in<br>
Fig. 9a. As soon as the parameter alignment and gain are<br>
calculated, the downmixer 70 in Fig. 7 as well as the<br>
residual encoder 16 in Fig. 7 can be started. In<br>
particular, the downmixer 70 in Fig. 7 includes an<br>
alignment block 91 for delaying one channel by the<br>
calculated time alignment parameter. The delayed second<br>
channel ra(n) is then added to the first channel using an<br>
adder device 92. At the output of the adder 92, the downmix<br>
channel is present. Thus, the downmixer 70 in Fig. 7<br>
includes blocks 91 and 92 to form the special mono signal.<br><br>
25<br>
The residual encoder 16 in Fig. 7 further includes the<br>
weighter 93 and the subsequent side signal calculator 94,<br>
which calculates the difference between the original first<br>
channel and the aligned and weighted second channel. In<br>
particular, for weighting the aligned second channel, the<br>
first weighting rule used in a corresponding decoder-side<br>
block 80 is performed. Thus, the residual encoder 16<br>
includes the alignment device 91, the weighting device 93<br>
and the side signal calculator 94. Since the aligned second<br>
channel is used for the downmix as well as the residual<br>
calculation, it is sufficient to calculate the aligned<br>
right channel only once and to forward the result to the<br>
downmixer 70 as well as to the weighter/side signal<br>
calculator 72 in Fig. 7.<br>
Preferably, the alignment and gain factors are chosen such<br>
that the process is reversible so that the Fig. 9d<br>
equations are well-defined and numerically well-<br>
conditioned.<br>
A generic mono coder can be used for mono coder 51 to code<br>
the sum signal, and a preferably dedicated residual coder<br>
33 is employed for the residual.<br>
When the mono coder 51 is loss-less, i.e., when the mono<br>
signal is not further quantized, and either the residual<br>
encoder is also loss-less or the alignment signal model<br>
matches the source signal perfectly, then the inventive<br>
coding structure shown in Fig. 9a has the perfect<br>
reconstruction property also assuming that the alignment<br>
and gain parameters are only subjected to a loss-less<br>
encoding scheme.<br>
The inventive system in Fig. 9a provides a framework for a<br>
scheme that can operate with graceful degradation over a<br>
multitude of ranges as indicated in Fig. 11, line 1114. In<br>
particular, without residual coding, i.e., d(n) = 0, the<br><br>
26<br>
scheme reduces to parametric stereo coding, by transmitting<br>
only the alignment and gain parameters (as multi-channel<br>
parameters) in addition to the mono signal (as the Downmix<br>
channel). This situation is illustrated in Fig. 9b.<br>
Additionally, the inventive system has the advantage that<br>
the alignment method automatically addresses the mono<br>
downmix problem.<br>
Subsequently, reference is made to Fig. 10 illustrating an<br>
implementation of the inventive embodiment illustrated in<br>
Figs 9a to 9d into a subband coding structure. The original<br>
left and right channels are input into an analysis<br>
filterbank 1000 for obtaining several subband signals. For<br>
each subband signal, an encoding/decoding scheme as shown<br>
in Figs 9a to 9d is used. On the decoder-side,<br>
reconstructed subband signals are combined in a synthesis<br>
filterbank 1010 to finally arrive at the full-band<br>
reconstructed multi-channel signals. Naturally, for each<br>
subband, an alignment parameter and a gain parameter is to<br>
be transmitted from the encoder-side to the decoder-side as<br>
illustrated by an arrow 1020 in Fig. 10.<br>
The preferred implementation of the subband coding<br>
structure of Fig. 10 is based on a cosine modulated<br>
filterbank with two stages, in order to achieve unequal<br>
subband bandwidths (on a perceptually motivated scale). The<br>
first stage splits the signal into M bands. The M subband<br>
signals are critically decimated, and fed to the second<br>
stage filterbank. The kth filter of the second stage, k e<br>
{1, ..., M}, has Mk bands. In a preferred implementation, M<br>
= 8 bands are used, and a sub-subband structure as in the<br>
table in Fig. 10, resulting in 36 effective subbands after<br>
the two stages is preferred. The prototype filters are<br>
designed according to [13] with at least 100 dB damping in<br>
the stop band. The filter order in the first stage is 116,<br>
and the maximum filter order in the second stage is 256.<br>
The coding structure is then applied to subband pairs<br>
(corresponding to left and right subband channels).<br><br>
27<br>
The corresponding grouping of the subbands between the<br>
first and the second stage filterbank is shown in the table<br>
to the right of Fig. 10, which makes clear that the first<br>
subband k includes 16 sub-subbands. Additionally, the<br>
second subband includes 8 sub-subbands, etc.<br>
Efficient parametric encoding is achieved utilizing<br>
Gaussian mixture (GM) vector quantization (VQ) techniques.<br>
Quantization based on GM models is popular within the field<br>
of speech coding [14-16], and facilitates low-complexity<br>
implementation of high dimensional VQ. In a preferred<br>
implementation, we vector quantize 36-dimensional vectors<br>
of gain and delay parameters. The GM models all have 16<br>
mixture components, and are trained on a database of<br>
parameters extracted from 60 minutes of audio data (with<br>
varying content, and disjoint from subsequent evaluation<br>
test signals). Methods based on explicit statistical models<br>
are less frequently used in audio coding than in speech<br>
coding. One reason is a disbelief in the ability of<br>
statistical models to capture all relevant information<br>
contained in general audio. In a preferred case,<br>
preliminary evaluation using open and closed test<br>
procedures of parameter models do, however, indicate that<br>
this is not a problem in this case. The resulting bitrate<br>
for the gain and delay parameters is 2.3 kbps.<br>
The subband structure is exploited for coding the residual<br>
signals. With the same block processing as described above,<br>
the variance in each subband is estimated and the variances<br>
are vector quantized using GM VQ across subbands (i.e., one<br>
36-dimensional vector is encoded at a time). The variances<br>
facilitate bit allocation among the subbands employing a<br>
greedy bit allocation algorithm [17, p. 234]. The subband<br>
signals are then encoded using uniform scalar quantizers.<br>
The instantaneous gain g(n) and delay r (n) are obtained by<br>
linearly  interpolation  the  block  estimates.  The  time<br><br>
28<br>
varying delay is realized through a 73rd-order fractional<br>
delay filter based on a truncated and Hamming windowed sinc<br>
impulse response [18]. The filter coefficients are updated<br>
on a per sample basis using the interpolated delay<br>
parameter.<br>
A framework for flexible coding of the stereo image in<br>
general audio is proposed. With the new structure, it is<br>
possible to move seamlessly from a parametric stereo mode,<br>
to waveform approximating coding. An example implementation<br>
of the ideas was tested, both using an uncoded residual to<br>
evaluate the effect of increasing the bitrate of the<br>
residual coder, and using a MP3 core coder, in order to<br>
evaluate the scheme in a more realistic scenario.<br>
For stabilizing the stereo image, it is preferred to low-<br>
pass filter the parameters in a pure parametric system or<br>
in a scalable system having a pure parametric part that con<br>
be used by a decoder without processing the residual<br>
signal, as is done in for example [9] . This reduces the<br>
alignment gain of the system. By coding the residual using<br>
scalar subband coding, the quality is further increased,<br>
and approaches transparent quality. In particular, adding<br>
bits to the residual stabilizes the stereo image, and the<br>
stereo width is also increased. Furthermore, flexible time<br>
segmentation, and variable rate (e.g., bit reservoir)<br>
techniques are preferred to better exploit the dynamic<br>
nature of general audio. A coherence parameter is<br>
preferably included in the alignment filter to enhance the<br>
parametric mode. Improved residual coding, employing<br>
perceptual masking, vector quantization, and differential<br>
encoding, lead to more efficient irrelevancy and redundancy<br>
removal.<br>
Although the inventive system has been described in the<br>
context of stereo-encoding and in the context of a<br>
parametrically enhanced Mid/Side encoding scheme, it is to<br>
be  noted  here  that  each  multi-channel  parametric<br><br>
29<br>
encoding/decoding scheme such as a generalized intensity-<br>
stereo kind of encoding can profit from an additionally<br>
enclosed side component to finally reach the perfect<br>
reconstruction property. Although a preferred embodiment of<br>
an inventive encoder/decoder scheme has been described<br>
using a time alignment at the encoder-side, transmitting<br>
the alignment parameter, and using a time-de-alignment at<br>
the decoder side, there exist further alternatives, which<br>
perform the time-alignment on the encoder-side for<br>
generating a small difference signal, but which do not<br>
perform the time de-alignment on the decoder-side so that<br>
the alignment parameter is not to be transmitted from the<br>
encoder to the decoder. In this embodiment, the neglection<br>
of the time de-alignment naturally includes an artifact.<br>
However, this artifact is in most cases not so serious so<br>
that such an embodiment is especially suitable for low-<br>
price multi-channel decoders.<br>
The present invention, therefore, can also be regarded as<br>
an extension of a preferably BCC-type parametric stereo<br>
coding scheme or any other multi-channel encoding scheme,<br>
which completely falls back to a purely parametric scheme,<br>
when the encoded residual signal is stripped off. In<br>
accordance with the present invention, a purely parametric<br>
system is enhanced by transmitting various types of<br>
additional information which preferably include the<br>
residual signal in a waveform-style, the gain parameter<br>
and/or the time alignment parameter. Thus, a decoding<br>
operation using the additional information results in a<br>
higher quality than what would be available with parametric<br>
techniques alone.<br>
Depending on the requirements, the inventive methods of<br>
encoding or decoding can be implemented in hardware,<br>
software or in firmware. Therefore, the invention also<br>
relates to a computer readable medium having store a<br>
program code, which when running on a computer results in<br>
one of the inventive methods. Thus, the present invention<br><br>
30<br>
is a computer program having a program code, which when<br>
running on a computer results in an inventive method.<br><br>
