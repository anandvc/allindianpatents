The benefit of 35 U.S,C. § 120 is claimed for all of the above referenced commonly owned applications. The applications referenced in the tables above are referred to herein as the "Related Applications."<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a petroleum well having a casing which is used as a conductive path to transmit AC electrical power and communication signals from the surface to downhole equipment located proximate the casing, and in particular where the formation ground is used as a return path for the AC circuit.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
Communication between two locations in an oil or gas well has been achieved using cables and optical fibers to transmit signals between the locations. In a petroleum well, it is, of course, highly undesirable and in practice difficult to use a cable along the tubing string either integral to the tubing string or spaced in the annulus between the tubing string and the casing. The use of a cable presents difficulties for well operators while assembling and inserting the tubing string into a borehole. Additionally, the cable is subjected to corrosion and heavy wear due to movement of the tubing string within the borehole. An example of a downhole communication system using a cable is shown in PCT/EP97/01621.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 4,839,644 describes a method and system for wireless two-way communications in a cased borehole having a tubing string. However, this system describes a communication scheme for coupling electromagnetic energy in a TEM mode using the annulus between the casing and the tubing. This coupling requires a substantially nonconductive fluid such as crude oil in the annulus between the casing and the tubing. Therefore, the invention described in U. S. Patent No. 4,839,644 has not been widely adopted as a practical scheme for downhole two-way communication.<br>
Another system for downhole communication using mud pulse telemetry is described in U.S. Patent Nos- 4,648,471 and 5,887,657. Although mud pulse telemetry can be successful at low data rates, it is of limited usefulness where high data rates are required or where it is undesirable to have complex, mud pulse telemetry equipment downhole. Other methods of communicating within a borehole are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,468,665; 4,578,675; 4,739,325; 5,130,706; 5,467,083; 5,493,288; 5,576,703; 5,574,374; and 5,883,516.<br>
PCT application, WO 93/26115 generally describes a communication system for a sub-sea pipeline installation. Importantly, each sub-sea facility, such as a wellhead, must<br><br>
have its own source of independent power. In the preferred embodiment, the power source is a batter/ pack for startup operations and a thermoelectric power generator for continued operations. For communications, '115 applies an electromagnetic VLF or ELF signal to the pipe comprising a voltage level oscillating about a DG voltage level. Figs. 18 and 19 and the accompanying text on pp. 40 -42 describe a simple system and method for getting downhole pressure and temperature measurements. However, the pressure and tcrnperature sensors are passive (Bourdon and bi-metallic strip) where mechanical displacement of a sensing element varies a cir:uit to provide resonant frequencies related to temperature and pressure. A frequency sweep at the wellhead looks for resonant spikes indicative of pressure and temperature. The data at the well head is transmitted to the surface by cable or the 115 pipeline communication system.<br>
It would, therefore, be a significant advance in the operation of petroleum wells if an alternate means for communicating and providing power downhole. Furthermore, it would be a significant advance if devices, such as sensors and controllable valves, could be positioned downhole that communicated with and were powered by equipment at the surface of the well.<br>
All references cited herein are incorporated by reference to the maximum extent allowable by law. To the extent a reference may not be fully incorporated herein, it is incorporated by reference for background purposes and indicative of the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The problem of communicating and supplying power downhole in a petroleum well is solved by the present invention. By coupling AC current to a casing located in a borehole of the well, power and communication signals can be supplied within the casing through the use of an external power transfer device and an internal power transfer device. The power and communication signals supplied within the casing can then be used to operate and control various downhole devices.<br>
A power supply apparatus according to the present invention includes an external power transfer device configured for disposition around a first piping structure and an internal power transfer device configured for disposition around a second piping structure. The external power transfer device receives a first surface current from the first piping structure. Tlie external power transfer device is magnetically coupled to the internal power transfer<br><br>
device; therefore, the first surface current induces a secondary current in the internal power transfer device.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, a power supply apparatus includes a similar external power transfer device and internal power transfer device disposed around a first piping structure and a second piping structure, respectively. Again, the two power transfer devices are magnetically coupled. The internal power transfer device is configured to receive a first downhole current, which induces a second downhole current in the external power transfer device.<br>
A petroleum well according to the present invention includes a casing and tubing string positioned within a borehole of the well, the tubing string being positioned and longitudinally extending within the casing. The petroleum well further includes an external power transfer device positioned around the casing and magnetically coupled to an internal power transfer device that is positioned around the tubing string.<br>
A method for supplying current within a first piping structure includes the step of providing an external power transfer device and an internal power transfer device that is inductively coupled to the external power transfer device. The external power transfer device is positioned around and inductively coupled to the first piping structure, while the internal power transfer device is positioned around a second piping structure. The method further includes the steps of coupling a main surface current to the first piping structure and inducing a first surface current within the external power transfer device. The first surface current provides the final step of inducing a second surface current within the internal power transfer device.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used in the present application, a "piping structure" can be one single pipe, a tubing string, a well casing, a pumping rod, a series of interconnected pipes, rods, rails, trusses, lattices, supports, a branch or lateral extension of a well, a network, of interconnected pipes, or other structures known to one of ordinary skill in the art. The preferred embodiment makes use of the invention in the context of an oil well where the piping structure comprises tubular, metallic, electrically-conductive pipe or tubing strings, but the invention is not so limited. For the present invention, at least a portion of the piping structure needs to be electricaliy conductive, such electrically conductive portion may be the entire piping structure (e.g., steel pipes, copper pipes) or a longitudinal extending electrically conductive portion combined with a longitudinally extending non-conductive portion. In other words, an electrically conductive piping structure is one that provides an electrical conducting path from one location where a power source is electrically connected to another location where a device and/or electrical return is electrically connected. The piping structure will typically be conventional round metal tubing, but the cross-sectional geometry of the piping staructure, or any portion thereof, can vary in shape (e.g., round, rectangular, square, oval) and size (e.g., length, diameter, wall thickness) along any portion of the piping structure.<br>
A 'valve" is any device that functions to regulate the flow of a fluid. Examples of valves include, but are not limited to, bellows-type gas-lift valves and controllable gas-lift valves, each of which may be used to regulate the flow of lift gas into a tubing string of a well. The internal workings of valves can vary greatly, and in the present application, it is not intended to limit the valves described to any particular configuration, so long as the valve<br><br>
functions to regulate flow. Some of the various types of flow regulating mechanisms include, but are not limited to, ball valve configurations, needle valve configurations, gate valve configurations, and cage valve configurations. The methods of installation for valves discussed in the present application can vary widely. Valves can be mounted downhole in a well in many different ways, some of which include tubing conveyed mounting configurations, side-pocket mandrel configurations, or permanent mountmg configurations such as mounting the valve in an enlarged tubing pod.<br>
The term *'modem" is used generically herein to refer to any communications device for transmitting and/or receiving electrical communication si2nals via an electrical conductor (e.g., metal). Hence, the term is not limited to the acronym for a modulator (device that converts a voice or data signal into a form that can be transmittcd)/demodulator (a device that recovers an original signal after it has modulated a high frequency carrier). Also, the term 'modem" as used herein is not limited to conventional computer modems that convert digital signals to analog signals and vice versa (e.g., to send digital data signals over the analog Public Switched Telephone Network), For example, if a sensor outputs measurements in an analog format, then such measurements may only need to be modulated (e.g., spread spectrum modulation) and transmitted—hence no analog-to-digital conversion is needed. As another example, a relay/slave modem or communication device may only need to identify, filter, amplify, and/or retransmit a signal received.<br>
The term "sensor" as used in the present application refers to any device tlrat detects, determines, monitors, records, or otherwise senses the absolute value of or a change in a physical quantity. Sensors as described in the present application can be used to measure temperature, pressure (both absolute and differential), flow rate, seismic data, acoustic data, pH level, salinity levels, valve positions, or almost any other physical data.<br>
As used in the present application, "wireless" means the absence of a conventional, insulated wire conductor e.g. extending from a downhole device to the surface. Using the tubing and/or casing as a conductor is considered "wireless."<br>
The term 'electronics module' in the present application refers to a control device. Electronics modules can exist in many configurations and can be mounted downhole in many different ways. In one mounting configuration, the electronics module is actually located within a valve and provides control for the operation of a motor within the valve. Electronics modules can also be mounted external to any particular valve. Some electronics modules will be mounted within side pocket mandrels or enlarged tubing pockets, while others may be<br><br><br>
Tubing string 26 supports a number of downhole devices 40, some of which may include wireless communications devices such as modems or spread-spectrum transceivers, sensors measuring downhole conditions such as pressure or temperature, and/or control devices such as motorized valves. Downhole devices 40 have many different functions and uses, some of which are described in the applications incorporated herein by reference. The overall goal of downhole devices 40 is to assist in increasing and maintaining efficient production of the well. This function is realized by providing sensors that can monitor<br><br>
downhole physical conditions and report the status of these conditions to the sunace of the well. Controllable valves located downhole arc used to effect changes in well production. By monitoring downhole physical conditions and comparing the data with theoretically and empirically obtained well models, a computer at surface 16 of the well can change settings on the controllable valves, thereby adjusting the overall production of the well.<br>
Power and communication signals are supplied to downhole devices 40 at global pick-off points 12. Each pick-off point 12 includes an external power transfer device 42 that is positioned concentrically around an exterior surface of casing 24 and an internal power transfer device 44 that is positioned concentrically around tubing string 26. External power transfer device 42 is installed at the time casing 24 is installed in borehole 14 and before the completion cement 20 has been placed. During completion of the well, cement 20 is poured in a space between borehole 14 and casing 24 and serves to further secure external power transfer device 42 relative to the casing 24. Internal power transfer device 44 is positioned around tubing string 26 such that internal power transfer device 44 is axially aligned with external power transfer device 42.<br>
A low-voltage / high-current AC source 60 is coupled to well casing 24 and a formation ground 61. Current supplied by source 60 travels through the casing and dissipates progressively through cement 20 into formation ground 61, since cement 20 forms a resistive current path between the casing 24 and the formation ground 61, i.e, the cement restricts current flow but is not an ideal electrical insulator. Thus, the casing current at any specific point in the well is the difference between the current supplied by source 60 and the current which has leaked through the cement 20 into formation ground 61 between surface 16 and that specific point in the well.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2 in the drawings, external power transfer device 42 is illustrated in more detail Each external power transfer device 42 is comprised of a toroidal transformer coil 62 wound on a high magnetic permeability core, and a primary solenoid transformer coil 64. The winding of toroidal transformer coil 62 is electrically connected to the wmding of primary solenoid transformer coil 64 such that current in the windings of toroidal transformer coil 62 passes through the windings of primary solenoid transformer coil 64. A section 65 of casing 24 passing through external power transfer device 42 is fabricated of a non-magnetic material such as stainless steel.<br>
In operation, a main surface current is supplied to casing 24. Usually the main surface current will be supplied by source 60, but it is conceivable that a communications signal<br><br><br>
transmission of power from the casing to the inner module as its primary focus the entire system is reversible such that power and communications may also be transferred from the internal power transfer device to the casing. In such a system a communications signal such as sensor information is routed from electronics module 70 to secondary solenoid transformer coil 66. The signal is provided to the transformer coil 66 as a first downhole current. The first downhole current has an associated solenoidal magnetic field, which induces a second downhole current in the windings of primary solenoidal transformer coil 64. The second<br><br>
downhole current passes into the windings of toroidal transformer coil 62, which induces a main dovvnhole current in casing 24. The main downhole current then communicates the original signal from electronics module 70 to other downhole devices 40 or to equipment at the surface 16 of the well. Various forms of implementation are possible, e.g., the electronics module 70 may include a power storage device such as a battery or capacitor   The battery or capacitor is charged during normal operation. When it is desired to communicate from the module 70, the battery or capacitor supplies the power.<br>
It should be noted that the use of the words "primary' and 'secondary" with the solenoid transformer coils 64, 66 are naming conventions only, and should not be construed to limit the direction of power transfer between the solenoid transformer coils 64, 66.<br>
A number of practical considerations must be borne in mind in the design of toroidal transfomer coil 62 and primary solenoid transformer coil 64. To protect against mechanical damage during installation, and corrosion in service, the coils are encapsulated in a glass fiber reinforced epoxy sheath or equivalent non-conductive material, and the coil windings are filled with epoxy or similar material to eliminate voids within the winding assembly. For compatibility with existing borehole and casing diameter combinations an external diameter of the completed coil assembly (i.e., external power transfer device 42) must be no greater than the diameter of the casing collars. For ease of manufacturing, or cost, it may be desirable to compose the toroidal transformer coil 62 of a series of tori which are stacked on the casing and whose outputs are coupled to aggregate power transfer. Typically the aggregate length of the torus assembly will be of the order of two meters, which is relatively large compared to standard manufacturing practice for toroidal transformers, and for this reason if no other the ability to divide the total assembly into sub-units is desirable.<br>
The design analyses for toroidal transformer coil 62 and primary solenoid transformer coil 64 is derived from standard practice for transformer design with account taken of the novel geometries of the present invention. The casing is treated as a single-turn current-carrying primary for the toroidal transformer design analysis. Appendix A provides the mathematical treatment of this design analysis. FIG.4 illustrates the results from such a design analysis, in this case showing how the optimum number of turns on toroidal transformer coil 62 depends on the frequency of the AC power being supplied on casing 24.<br>
FIG.5 illustrates results of an analysis showing how relative permeability of the toroid core material affects current available into a 10-Ohm load, for three representative power frequencies, 50Hz, 60Hz and 400H2. These results show the benefit of selecting high<br><br><br>
The main objectives of the analysis for  conduction along the casing are:<br>
•	To calculate the current transmitted along the well;<br>
•	To determine the maximum depth at which significant current could be observed;<br>
•	To study the influence of the controlling parameters, especially, conductivity of<br>
the rock, and frequency.<br>
To simplify the problem, the thickness of the casing is assumed to be larger than its skin depth, which is valid for ail cases considered. As a result, the well can be modeled as a solid rod. Each material (pipe, cement, and rock) is characterized by a set of electromagnetic constants: conductivity a, magnetic permeability , and dielectric constant z. Metal properties are well known; however, the properties of the rock as well as the cement vary significantly depending on dryness, water and oil saturation. Therefore, a number of different<br><br><br>
permeability varying from 100 to 200, or stainless steel with resistivity of about 99 x 10 ohm-m and relative magnetic permeability of 1. A series of graphs showing the power available as a function of frequency and of depth (or length) in a petroleum well under different conditions for rock and cement conductivity is illustrated in Appendix B. The results of the modeling can be summarized as follows:<br>
•	It was shown that significant current (minimum value of 1A corresponding to<br>
100V applied) could be observed at depths up to 3000 m.<br>
 If rock is not very conductive (a-od  0-01 or less), the wide range of frequencies (up to 60 Hz or even more) could be used. This could be a case of an oil-bearing reservoir.<br>
•	For less conductive rock, the frequencies should be less than about 12 Hz.<br>
•	Generally, stainless steel is preferable for the casing; carbon steel has an advantage only for very low frequencies (less than 8 Hz).<br>
•	Presence of the resistive cement between casing and rock helps in situations, when rock conductivity is high.<br>
Even though many of the examples discussed herein are applications of the present invention in petroleum wells, the present invention also can be applied to other types of wells, including but not limited to water wells and natural gas wells.<br>
One skilled in the art will see that the present invention can be applied in many areas where there is a need to provide a communication system or power within a borehole, well, or any other area that is difficult to access. Also, one skilled in the art will see that the present invention can be applied in many areas where there is an already existing conductive piping structure and a need to route power and communications to a location on the piping structure. A water sprinkler system or network in a building for extinguishmg fires is an example of a piping structure that may be already existing and may have a same or similar path as that desired for routing power and communications. In such case another piping structure or another portion of the same piping structure may be used as the electrical return. The steel structure of a building may also be used as a piping structure and/or electrical return for transmitting power and communications in accordance with the present invention. The steel rebar in a concrete dam or a street may be used as a piping structure and/or electrical return for transmitting power and communications in accordance with the present invention. The transmission lines and network of piping between wells or across large stretches of land may be used as a piping structure and/or electrical return for transmitting power and<br><br>
communications in accordance with the present invention. Surface refinery production pipe networks may be used as a piping structure and/or electrical return for transmitting power and communications in accordance with the present invention. Thus, there are numerous applications of the present invention in many different areas or fields of use.<br>
It should be apparent from the foregoing that an invention, having significant advantages has been provided. While the invention is shown in only a few of its forms, it is not just limited but is susceptible to various changes and modifications without departing from the snirit thereof<br><br>

The core losses in the parts of the cores where the inner and outer cores are close are difficult to calculate, as no uniform flux density exists in these parts. To estimate these losses, an identical flux density as in the middle parts of the cores is assumed. The effective volume of these parts where core losses occur is then determined by the requirement that the total flux through these parts is identical to the total flux through the middle parts. The total effective volumes of the two cores for the calculation of the core loss are given by:<br><br><br><br>
