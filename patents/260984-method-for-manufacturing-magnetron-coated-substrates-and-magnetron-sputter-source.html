Method for manufacturing magnetron coated substrates and magnetron<br>
sputter source.<br>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing magnetron coated<br>
substrates and a magnetron source.<br>
Definitions<br>
The structure of a magnetron source is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. It<br>
has a target 3 with a sputter surface 3S from which target material is<br>
sputtered off and reactively or not reactively deposited on the substrate 4. On<br>
the reverse side 3R of the target a magnet arrangement 5 is provided. It has<br>
at least one pair of circumferential magnetic loops 7a and 7b, which, facing the<br>
reverse side 3R of the target, have surfaces of inverse magnetic polarity. The<br>
magnetic loops 7a and 7b respectively are each forming closed loops, wherein<br>
"closed" absolutely also includes magnets, that are arranged at a distance<br>
from one another, as long as by both magnetic loops generate closed loops<br>
of the magnetron magnet field H at the sputter surface 3S of the target 3. With<br>
regard to the generation of the circumferential tunnel-shaped magnetron<br>
magnet field both magnetic loops 7a and 7b form a pair of interacting magnetic<br>
loop pair 7ab. The magnetron magnet field H is, as shown schematically,<br>
crossed by an electric field E generated between'an anode and the target 3<br>
interconnected as the cathode. Due to the magnetron magnet field H and the<br>
electric field E, the known electron trap effect occurs in the area of the tunnel-<br>
shaped magnetron magnet field H, which at that point leads to an increased<br>
plasma density and an increased sputter effect. The result is, in the area of<br>
the magnetron magnet field, a circumferential erosion trench in the sputter<br>
surface 3s that increases in depth with the increased duration of the<br>
operation. We call a closed loop of magnets of whatever shape, which<br>
presents one of the two magnetic polarities to the reverse side 3K of the<br><br>
WO 2006/034598	PCT/CH2005/000441<br>
target, a magnetic loop. According to Fig. 1 two of such magnetic loops 7a and<br>
7b are present.<br>
Two such adjacent magnetic loops form a pair of magnetic loops according to 7ab<br>
of Fig. 1, if they generate a circumferential loop of the tunnel-shaped magnetron<br>
5      magnet field H. The magnet arrangement 5 can contain one or more<br>
circumferential magnetic loops plus separately positioned additional magnets for<br>
forming the magnetron magnet field loops. The electric field E between the anode<br>
(not shown) and the target cathode can be generated using DC, pulsed DC,<br>
superimposed DC and AC as well as AC up to the high frequency range. As<br>
I 0      mentioned before, the coating process may be performed with the one or the<br>
several target materials, or after their reaction with a reactive gas admitted into<br>
the process space between the sputter surface 3S and the substrate 4. On one<br>
and the same target 3 with areas of different materials, several materials can be<br>
sputtered into the process space simultaneously, directly for coating or after<br>
1 b      reaction with a reactive gas within the process space.<br>
In order to extend the life time of the target 3 and/or to keep the sputter rate<br>
(amount of sputtered off material per time unit), for example, constant despite the<br>
forming of the erosion trench or trenches and thus the coating rate (amount of<br>
material deposited on the substrate 4 per time unit) it is known and common to<br>
?.'■)      move at least parts of the magnet arrangement 5. and in particular the one or the<br>
several provided pairs of magnetic loops along the reverse side of the target, be it<br>
by cyclic linear movements or rotational movements or pendulum movements.<br>
With that the magnetron magnet field H is moved along the sputter surface, in<br>
order to generate preferably no significant local erosion trenches.<br>
?,b      We call a magnetron source a single-circuit source, if it has only one pair of<br>
magnetic loops. We call a magnetron source a two or multi circuit source, if the<br>
magnet arrangement has two or more pairs of magnetic loops. It is to be observed<br>
that two pairs of magnetic loops can definitely be formed using three magnetic<br>
loops.<br><br>
WO 2006/034598	PCT/CH2005/000441<br>
_ -3<br>
The present invention now presumes a method for generating magnetron coated<br>
substrates, in which - along the reverse side of the target facing away from the<br>
substrate - a magnet arrangement is provided, by means of which at least one closed<br>
loop of a tunnel-shaped magnetic field is generated along the sputter surface of the<br>
b      target.<br>
Especially in the use of large surface targets, the achievement and maintenance of<br>
a desired layer thickness distribution and, in particular, a uniform layer thickness<br>
distribution is notoriously problematic. With regard to this one of the problems is that<br>
due to target erosion the coating circumstances are dynamic, i.e. that they change in<br>
1 0      the course of the lifetime and the utilisation period respectively of the target. If<br>
during the life time of an observed target a lot of substrates are coated, the<br>
mentioned dynamic will - depending on the coating time of the individual substrates<br>
- possibly only have a small effect, whereas, if the layer thickness distribution is<br>
considered across the entire life time of the target, as if only one individual substrate<br>
1	b      would be coated, a significant change is often observed in the distribution of the<br>
layer thickness.<br>
Definition<br>
We define as the coating time a period of time under consideration up to the lifetime<br>
of the target, independent of the number of individual substrates that are coated<br>
?. 0      using the same target in the period of time under consideration.<br>
Rotating single-circuit magnetron sources with heart or meander shaped magnetic<br>
loop structures cover the largest part of the applications in the field of magnetron<br>
sputtering. Adjustable single-circuit magnetron sources for the optimization of the<br>
distribution of the sputter rate over the coating time are, for example, described in<br>
2	b      US 5 188 717. Static two-circuit magnetron sources are, for example, known from<br>
WO 98/03696 or US 5 997 697. Two-circuit magnetron sources with switching<br>
mechanism for switching from sputtering by one of the pairs of magnetic loops to<br>
sputtering at a second are described in WO 01/63643.<br><br>
WO 2006/034598	PCT/CH2005/000441<br>
Because of the limited coverage of large target surfaces, e.g. of 1200 cm2, it is<br>
often very difficult to achieve a desired uniform distribution of the sputter rate as<br>
well as of the coating rate and eventually of the layer thickness on the substrate<br>
over the period of the coating process by means of rotating single-circuit<br>
b      magnetron sources. For that purpose meander or heart shaped structures of the<br>
pair of magnetic loops are often employed, which, however, on large target<br>
surfaces have the disadvantage that they either have several turning points or<br>
coat wide areas of the targets insufficiently. Narrow radii of the pairs of magnetic<br>
loops in particular, in the case of increased speeds, like the rpm of the magnetic<br>
1 0       system, lead to high eddy-current losses. On the one hand, these have to be<br>
compensated for by the engine power and on the other hand lead to a<br>
weakening of the magnetron magnet field.<br>
Static two-circuit magnetron sources, as described in WO 98/03696 or US 5 997<br>
697, have the disadvantage that static erosion profiles are impressed into the<br>
1	b      sputter surface. As initially mentioned, it becomes especially evident that with<br>
increasing sputtering of the target the sputter rate changes as well as the coating<br>
rate and thus also the layer thickness distribution on the substrate. Therefore a<br>
mechanism is required on principle, which enables the adjustment primarily of the<br>
sputter rate distribution on the target and over the course of its lifetime. This is<br>
2	0      often solved in such way that groups of magnets of the magnet arrangement are<br>
moved laterally, i.e. along the reverse side of the target 3R, as known for instance<br>
from WO 02/47110. The disadvantage of this is that another drive has to be<br>
superposed over the rotating system with the pairs of magnetic loops, for which<br>
the power supply has to be realised, e.g. via electrical collector rings. Balance<br>
7. b      errors are created by the moving of the aforementioned groups of magnets, which<br>
have to be compensated for by appropriate measurements. Rotating two-circuit<br>
magnetron sources with a switching mechanism for the selective activation of the<br>
one or the other pairs of magnetic loops, as described in WO 01/63643, result in a<br>
high load for the electromechanical drives.<br><br>
WO 2006/034598	PCT/CH2005/000441<br>
It is a task of this invention to propose a method of the initially mentioned type and<br>
a magnetron source respectively, for which and on which respectively the sputter<br>
rate distribution along the sputter surface can be adjusted in situ during the sputter<br>
operation - the coating time - and whereby the disadvantages of known methods<br>
b      or magnetron sources that use the respective approaches can be avoided. With<br>
regard to this, the method of the initially mentioned type is characterised by the<br>
fact that the distance of a part of the magnet arrangement from the reverse side of<br>
the target is changed in order to set the sputter rate distribution.<br>
A good realization of this method results furthermore from the fact that at least a<br>
1	0      part of the magnet arrangement is moved along the reverse side of the target. This<br>
results in a distribution of the sputter effect of the tunnel-shaped magnetron magnet<br>
field along the sputter surface.<br>
A further good realization of the method according to the invention is, that a part of a<br>
circumferential magnetic loop is changed in distance. This results in a change of the<br>
15      sputter intensity in the area of the magnetron magnet field co-generated with the<br>
loop.<br>
A further good realisation exists in the fact that the distance of a whole magnetic loop<br>
is changed, if necessary in combination with the change of a part of the magnetic<br>
loop concerned and another one.<br>
2	0      A further good realisation is created, if necessary in combination with the<br>
aforementioned realisations, by changing the distance of a pair of magnetic<br>
loops, especially indicated, if the magnetron source is a two or multi-circuit<br>
source. In that case the corresponding distances can also be changed at more<br>
than one of the pairs of magnetic loops.<br>
25     If the adjustment according to the invention of the aforementioned distance is to be<br>
realized for magnetron sources, for which the magnet arrangement is rotated along<br>
the back surface of the target and if a homogenous layer thickness distribution<br>
during the coating time up to the target life time is to be achieved, then a good<br><br>
WO 2006/034598	PCT/CH2005/000441<br>
- 6 -<br>
realisation is created by increasing - with increasing coating time - the distance of a<br>
part of the magnet arrangement, which is closer to the target edge than a further<br>
part of the magnet arrangement, and/or by decreasing the distance of the further<br>
part.<br>
b      In all the aforementioned realizations it is furthermore a good idea to keep the<br>
sputter output constant. A further good idea is - with a sputter output that is kept<br>
constant - to record the discharge voltage between an anode and the target, to<br>
compare it with a target value and to adjust the distance of the part as a function of<br>
the result of the comparison. Furthermore it is also a good idea to divide the target<br>
1 0      into zones of different materials and to set the relationship of the sputter rates of the<br>
two materials by the aforementioned adjustment of the distance.<br>
A magnetron source according to the invention has a target with a sputter surface and<br>
a magnet arrangement along the reverse side of the target facing away from the<br>
sputter surface. With regard to this, the aforementioned task is solved by the fact that<br>
15     the distance of a part of the magnet arrangement to the back surface of the target is<br>
adjustable by means of a controlled lift drive.<br>
It is a good concept of the magnetron source according to the invention, that at least<br>
one part of the magnet arrangement is operatively connected with a movement drive,<br>
by means of which the part is moved along the back surface of the target.<br>
2	0      It is another good concept, which can easily be combined with the aforementioned<br>
one, if a part of a magnetic loop is operatively connected with the controlled lift drive.<br>
Another good idea for the concept of the magnetron source according to the<br>
invention, if necessary in combination with the aforementioned one, is, to adjust a<br>
whole magnetic loop using the aforementioned controlled lift drive. This concept as<br>
?25      well can be combined with the aforementioned one, if necessary, just like the other<br>
good concept, to operatively connect a pair of magnetic loops with the controlled<br>
drive. Another good concept is to provide an outer pair of magnetic loops and an inner<br>
pair of magnetic loops at the source and with regard to the back surface of the target,<br><br>
WO 2006/034598	PCT/CH2005/000441<br>
and to design at least one of the pairs of loops eccentrically with respect to an axis of<br>
rotation and to operatively connect it with a rotation drive acting on the axis of rotation.<br>
It is another good idea, to provide a control, by means of which the distance of a part<br>
of the magnet arrangement - a part that is positioned further towards the edge of the<br>
5      target than another part of the magnet arrangement - is increased and/or by which the<br>
distance of the other part is decreased during the coating time.<br>

Figure 2a illustrates a first embodiment of the method according to the invention and<br>
the magnetron source according to the invention respectively in schematised<br>
perspective view; Fig. 2b, also schematised, illustrates the side view of the<br>
1	5      arrangement illustrated in Fig. 2a. On the substrate side (substrate not shown) target<br>
3 has a sputter surface 3 s and, facing away from the substrate, a reverse side 3 R .<br>
In the area of the back surface 3 R there is a magnet arrangement 5, which<br>
generates at least one, according to the Figures 2 one, closed loop of a tunnel-<br>
shaped magnetic field H on the sputter surface 3S,   the magnetron magnet field H,<br>
2	0      which is quite familiar to an expert. Figures 2 show a common single-circuit<br>
magnetron source. For this the magnet arrangement 5 has a first, mainly closed<br>
circumferential magnetic loop 7a as well as a second 7b, which is located inside the<br>
one mentioned first. At least one of the two magnetic loops 7a,7b is at least to the<br>
greatest extent possible constructed by means of permanent magnets 9, for<br>
25     instance according to the Figures 2, the outer magnetic loop 7a. One magnetic<br>
polarity - for instance N - of the aforementioned, for example, outer magnetic loop 7a<br>
is located opposite the back surface of the target 3R. In any case, the second<br>
magnetic loop 7b is located opposite the back surface of the target 3R with the<br><br>
WO 2006/034598	PCT/CH2005/000441<br>
- 10 -<br>
second magnetic polarity, for instance S. As is easily seen from Fig. 2c, the<br>
realization of the pair of magnetic loops 7ab is such that along the back surface of the<br>
target 3R a circumferential zone of the one magnetic polarity is created as well as -<br>
with regard to this - an inside or outside circumferential second zone of the second<br>
5      magnetic polarity. For this purpose permanent magnets 9 are provided on both<br>
loops, on the side that is facing away from the back surface of the target 3H, this is a<br>
ferromagnetic connection 10. Alternately there are in each case, if necessary section<br>
by section, viewed along the magnetic loops, permanent magnets 9a are present on<br>
one of the loops, for example the outer one, and the second magnetic polarity -<br>
I0      facing the back surface of the target 3R - on the other loop, e.g. the inner one 7b, is<br>
formed by a ferromagnetic yoke 12.<br>
Viewed along the pair 7, the constellations according to Fig. 2c can alternate, just as,<br>
in view of the realisation with yoke 12, the arrangement of the permanent magnets.<br>
According to the figures 2, in particular Fig. 2b, and according to the embodiment<br>
15      example illustrated here, the distance db1(t) of a part 7b1 of one of the magnetic<br>
loops of the pair 7 is changed under control with respect to the back surface of the<br>
target 3R by means of a drive 14 controlled at a control input S14. In Fig. 2b, da<br>
denotes the distance of the magnetic pole surface of the one magnetic loop 7a<br>
from the back surface of the target 3R, the distance db that of the second<br>
2	0      magnetic loop 7b and dbi the controlled adjustable distance of the part 7b1 on at<br>
least one of the both loops, e.g. at the inner one. The effect of the magnetron<br>
magnet field H formed by the pair 7ab is changed under control. Of course, it is<br>
quite possible change the distance - at the considered magnetic loop - of both<br>
parts relatively to each other and both parts with reference to the back surface of<br>
2 0      the target 3R in a controlled manner, i.e. for instance and in view of Fig. 2a, to lift<br>
part 7b and to simultaneously lower the remaining part of the magnetic loop<br>
under consideration. Important is. that, viewed along the pair of magnetic loops<br>
7ab, the distances of the magnetic poie surfaces with reference to the back<br><br>
WO 2006/034598	PCT/CH2005/000441<br>
-11 -<br>
surface of the target are changed in time by controlled distance changes at the<br>
magnetic loops.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2a, it is, for example, a good idea - in a section under<br>
consideration along the pair 73b at both magnetic loops - to change equally or<br>
5      unequally long parts, 7a1&gt; 7bi, with reference to the distance of the back surface<br>
of the target 3R in a controlled manner; in the same direction equally or<br>
unequally, or in inverse direction equally or unequally.<br>
In a representation analogous to that of Fig. 2a, Fig. 3 shows another good<br>
embodiment of the invention. As clearly evident, the distance da(t) between the<br>
10      whole pole surface and the target at one of the magnetic loops, e.g. the outer<br>
magnetic loop 7a, is set on the pair 7ab using the drive 14 in a controlled manner<br>
with regard to time and thus in turn the effect of the tunnel-shaped magnetic field<br>
H that had been generated. Here, too, the distances of both of the whole magnetic<br>
loops 7a and 7b can, if necessary, be set in a controlled manner; in the same<br>
1	5     direction equally, in the same direction unequally, in the respective inverse<br>
direction equally or unequally.<br>
The embodiment according to Fig. 3 again shows a single-circuit magnetron<br>
source.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a further good embodiment of the invention - in a view analogous to<br>
2	0      the presentation of Fig. 2b. It has, in a general way, an uneven number - as<br>
shown here three - magnetic loops 7a to 7C, which together form two pairs of loops<br>
7ab, 7bc of the magnet arrangement 5. The polarity of the magnetic loop 7b in the<br>
middle is inverse to that of the two adjacent ones. These form the two<br>
circumferential loops of the tunnel-shaped magnetron magnet field H-,, H2 shown<br>
2 b      in this example of an embodiment. Analogous to the embodiments of Fig. 2, in the<br>
embodiment according to Fig. 4 the distance db1(t) of at least of one part 7b1 of the<br>
magnetic loop 7b in the middle is changed by means of a controlled drive (not<br>
shown), whereas the part or the remaining parts of the magnetic loop 7b that is<br><br>

under consideration are kept at a constant distance with respect to the back<br>
surface 3R of the target 3.<br>
Fig. 5 shows, in a presentation analogous to Fig. 4, a further good embodiment -<br>
analogous to that shown in Fig. 3 - in which the whole central magnetic loop 7, as<br>
5      shown by db(t), is changed by means of a controlled drive (not shown) with respect<br>
to the back surface 3R of the target 3.<br>
When proceeding according to Fig. 4 and 5, mainly both magnetron magnet fields H,<br>
and H2 are affected by specifically adjusting the distance db(t) and db1(t) respectively.<br>
According to the embodiment according to Fig. 6, as is now easily<br>
10      understandable, a part 7a1 of the outer magnetic loop 7a is moved by means of a<br>
(not shown) controlled drive with respect to the drive's distance da1(t), whereas the<br>
remaining part of the magnetic loop 7a is kept at a constant distance, just as the<br>
loops 7b,7c.<br>
In the likewise good embodiment according to Fig. 7, the distance da(t) of the<br>
15      whole outer magnetic loop 7a is changed by means of a controlled drive (not<br>
shown) and relatively to the back surface of the target 3 R .<br>
The embodiments according to figures 4 to 7 are two-circuit magnetron sources.<br>
By providing appropriately controlled drives, all individual embodiments described<br>
by means of the figures 2 to 7 may be employed at a magnetron source in<br>
20      combination if necessary.<br>
Whereas the adjacent magnetron magnet fields H are adjusted in mutual<br>
dependency by the distance adjustment in the embodiments according to<br>
the figures 4 to 7, i.e. at two-circuit magnetron sources, namely that,<br>
generally speaking, upon weakening of the one field the other is<br>
2	5      strengthened and vice versa, this is less pronounced in the case of the<br>
good embodiments illustrated in the following. In the likewise good<br>
embodiment according to Fig. 8, four - generally an even number -<br><br>
WO 2006/034598	PCT/CH2005/000441<br>
- 13 -<br>
magnetic loops lying within one another are provided, 7a to 7d. From the<br>
innermost or outermost magnetic loop, progressing perpendicular thereto,<br>
two successive magnetic loops are each involved in the forming of a pair<br>
of magnetic loops, as illustrated in Fig. 8 by 7ab, 7cd, which form a<br>
5      magnetron magnet field, H1 and H2 respectively. At both pairs 7ab, 7cdl the<br>
embodiments described by means of the figures 2 and 3 can each be<br>
realized, at one of the pairs or at both. Additionally, however, in a further<br>
good embodiment of the invention and as shown in Fig. 9, the distance<br>
dcd(t) of a whole pair of loops - according to Fig. 9 that of the inner one 7cd<br>
10       -can be set according to the invention by means of a controlled drive (not<br>
shown). It is also possible and a good idea, to design the distance of both<br>
provided pairs of magnetic loops with appropriate drives that can be<br>
adjusted in a controlled manner, and to adjust these distances<br>
unidirectionally equally, unidirectionally unequally, in opposite directions<br>
15     equally or in opposite directions unequally, if necessary in any specific<br>
combination.<br>
Up to now - in the embodiments according to the figures 2 to 9, the provided magnet<br>
arrangements with the magnetic loops, aside from the distance adjustment<br>
according to the invention, were considered to be stationary with respect to the back<br>
'20      surface of the target 3R. In all embodiments it is a good concept - in addition to the<br>
realization of the distance adjustment according to the invention - to move at least<br>
parts of the magnet arrangement 5 along the back surface of the target 3R by<br>
means of a corresponding (not shown) drive. Thus it is a good concept, to move the<br>
pair 7ab cyclically along the back surface of the target 3R according to Fig. 2a, as<br>
2	5      illustrated schematically by the movement trajectory Bab. The same is true for the<br>
embodiment according Fig. 3. Thereby it may also be a good concept to move - for<br>
the single-circuit magnetron sources according to Fig. 2 and 3 under consideration -<br>
the both magnetic loops forming the pair relatively to one another on different<br>
movement trajectories along the back surface 3K.<br><br>

For the embodiment according to the figures 4 to 7, i.e. in the realization of a<br>
two-circuit magnetron source with magnetic loop triplet, good concepts result<br>
from<br>
•	moving of all provided magnetic loops equally along the back surface 3R.<br>
5       • moving the central magnetic loop with respect to both the adjacent magnetic<br>
loops;<br>
•	moving one or both of the outermost and innermost magnetic loops of the<br>
triplet equally or unequally with respect to the central magnetic loop of the<br>
triplet.<br>
1 0	In the embodiments according to the figures 8 and 9 respectively it is<br>
a good concept<br>
•	to move all provided pairs of magnetic loops equally along the back<br>
surface of the target 3K, or<br>
•	to move one pair of magnetic loops relatively to the other.<br>
1	5      Depending on the choice of concept, to either form the magnetron magnet field<br>
by the magnetic loops or to move the magnetron magnet field along the sputter<br>
surface 3S of the target 3, the mentioned movement possibilities are employed in<br>
combination and corresponding controlled drives are provided.<br>
The magnetic loops introduced by means of the Figure 2 to 9 can be arranged<br>
2	0      circumferentially in a circular, oval, elliptical or even approximately rectangular<br>
manner, viewed in a top view of the sputter surface 3S, or can be heart or kidney<br>
or meander shaped.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a diagram of a good realization of a source 20 according to the<br>
invention, principally according to Fig. 9. It has a target 23 with a sputter surface 23S<br>
2 5      and a back surface 23R. The outer pair of magnetic loops 7ab according to Fig. 9 is<br><br>
WO 2006/034598	PCT/CH2005/000441<br>
mounted on an outer support 25 via a ferromagnetic yoke 10. By means of a<br>
rotation drive 27, only illustrated schematically, the outer support 25 is brought into<br>
rotation around the axis A25. By means of another rotation drive 29 with respect to<br>
the only schematically illustrated source housing, an inner support 35 is brought into<br>
5      rotation, in the shown example around the axis A3;,, which here coincides with the<br>
axis of rotation A25. The inner support 35 has a back panel 33 made of<br>
ferromagnetic material, facing the target 23, and supports the magnetic loops 7C,<br>
and 7d, which together form the pair 7cd. With respect to the axis of rotation A25 the<br>
pair of magnetic loops 7ab is concentrically mounted at the outer support 25,<br>
1	0       whereas the pair of magnetic loops 7Gd is mounted at the inner support 33<br>
eccentrically with respect to the axis of rotation A3S. By means of a schematically<br>
illustrated controllable lift drive 37 the inner support 35 is adjusted with respect to the<br>
distance dcd(t) to the back surface 23R of the target 23. The rotation speeds co35 and<br>
co25 and rotation directions respectively of the outer and inner support 25, 35 can<br>
15      be chosen to be equal or different. A good concept results, however, if, as illustrated<br>
in the top view of the magnet arrangement in Fig. 11, the pair of magnetic loops 7ab<br>
is realized at the outer support 25 eccentrically and, as shown, e.g. circular, and if the<br>
pair of magnetic loops 7cd at the inner support 35 rotating around the axis A35 is<br>
realized likewise eccentrically. In Fig. 12 the progression (a) at a circular target 23<br>
2	0      with diameter 400 mm shows the erosion profile for a concentric arrangement of one<br>
of the two pairs of magnetic loops, according to Fig. 10, for example, of the outer<br>
one 7ab and for the eccentric arrangement of the other pair of magnetic loops,<br>
according to Fig. 10 of the pair 7cd. The course (b) shows the erosion profile if both,<br>
inner and outer pairs 7ab and 7cd, according to Fig. 11 are realized eccentrically with<br>
20      respect to the coinciding rotation axes A2S, A36.  It turns out that in the arrangement<br>
according to Fig. 11 no significantly diminished eroded area occurs in the<br>
intermediate area between the inner pair of magnetic loops 7cd and the outer one 7ab.<br>
Through the optimized eccentricity of the pairs of magnetic loops under<br>
consideration, an optimal erosions profile overlap can be achieved. In a design<br>
3	0      according to Fig. 11 it is inevitable that the rotation drives 27 and 29 according to Fig.<br><br>
WO 2006/034598	PCT/CH2005/000441<br>
-16-<br>
10 are operated at same rotational speeds. By means of the lift, which is set by the<br>
drive 37 in a controlled manner, and thus through the change of the distance dcd(t),<br>
a still more uniform erosion and sputter distribution can be realised, as is to be<br>
shown, and thus an optimal desired layer thickness distribution can be achieved on<br>
5      the substrate, or the target utilization can be optimized by an erosion of the target<br>
surface that is as uniform as possible.<br>
The layer thickness distribution achieved with different lift values, and respectively in<br>
view of Fig. 10 of the distance dcd(t): is shown in Fig. 13 on a circular substrate with<br>
a diameter of 300 mm by means of the surface resistance of an on-sputtered<br>
10      copper layer. Accordingly a high resistance value corresponds to a thin layer and<br>
vice versa. A double eccentric arrangement according to Fig. 11 was used for the<br>
magnet arrangement. The result according to progression (a), for which the copper<br>
layer is significantly thinner within the central area of the substrate than in the<br>
peripheral area, the lift of the inner pair 7cd was set corresponding to the distance<br>
1 5      dCd(t) according to Fig. 10, which equals the distance da of the outer pair 7ab. Then the<br>
distance dcd(t) (inner pair of loops!) was reduced by 0.5 mm, which led to an<br>
increase of the sputter rate in the central area of the target and thus to an increase<br>
of the coating rate on the substrate, with the result of a significantly improved layer<br>
thickness distribution on the substrate in accordance with the progression (b) of<br>
20      Fig. 13.<br>
When (not shown in Fig. 13) the lift dcd(t) was reduced by a further 0.5 mm, the result<br>
was an extremely uniform layer thickness distribution on the substrate, due to the<br>
fact that the sputter rate during the last coating phase was increased again in the<br>
centre of the target, thus further increasing the central area of the substrate of the<br>
25      resulting layer thickness, plus further reduced surface resistant of the copper layer<br>
in the central area of the substrate in accordance with Fig. 13.<br>
Fig. 13 shows, how by controlling the time of the distance at parts of the magnet<br>
arrangement generating the magnetic field on the one hand, the progression of the<br>
sputter rate and thus of the coating rate and thus the layer thickness distribution on<br><br>
WO 2006/034598	PCT/CH2005/000441<br>
-    17    -<br>
the substrate resulting after a predetermined period of time, can finely be set. In<br>
order to obtain the results according to Fig. 13, the discharge voltage at the<br>
magnetron sputter source was not influenced and the supplied electrical discharge<br>
output was kept constant.<br>
For the time-dependent control of the distance dcd(t) in the arrangement according<br>
to Fig. 10 with two eccentric pairs of magnetic loop 7ab and 7cd according to Fig.<br>
11, the following considerations can be helpful, if the most homogeneous layer<br>
thickness distribution possible is to be achieved on the substrate; for an expert this<br>
will open up analogous ideas concerning differently conceived magnetron sources<br>
according to the invention and distributions to be achieved: For the time being, the<br>
erosion profile to be targeted for optimized layer thickness distribution on a<br>
circular disc shaped target on the substrate shall be discussed on the basis of Fig.<br>
14. Without precise distance control, the arrangement according to Fig. 10 and<br>
the magnet arrangement according to Fig. 11 result in an erosion rate ER that is<br>
higher at the outer area, which is rather desirable for the edge effect correction.<br>
However, in this outer area the formation of a significant erosion trench results in<br>
an increasingly high sputter rate, so that over a period of time the relative erosion<br>
intensity has to be reduced in the outer area of the target. This is necessary, in<br>
order to achieve a homogeneous layer thickness distribution on the substrate over<br>
time. The reduction of the erosion intensity in the outer area is to be considered in<br>
relation to the erosion intensity in the central area of the target. Therefore, either<br>
the erosion intensity in the outer area of the target can be reduced or the erosion<br>
intensity in the central area of the target can be increased. In the explanations<br>
concerning Fig. 13 the latter method was described.<br>
Thus - with view on Fig. 14 - the relative sputter intensity and sputter rate<br>
respectively in the outer area of the target has to be reduced from a higher value<br>
ER1 at the start to a lower value ER2 at the end of the coating period. The value<br>
of the distance reduction at dcd(t) the inner support and the distance increase at<br>
the outer support respectively can be roughly estimated in advance as follows:<br><br>
WO 2006/034598	PCT/CH2005/000441<br>
- 13 -<br>
For the time being, the erosion depth difference between the outer and inner<br>
erosion trench is measured at the end of a given coating time, e.g. the target life<br>
time. This takes place at predetermined fixed distances of the outer and the<br>
inner supports 25 and 35 respectively, in accordance with Fig. 10. Once the<br>
5      erosion depth difference is determined, e.g. a 7 mm higher erosion depth in the<br>
edge area of the target, then the sputter intensity in the outer area of the target<br>
is relatively reduced by a relative lift change of 7 mm during the same coating<br>
time, i.e. a distance increase of the outer support 35 by 7 mm and a distance<br>
decrease of the inner support 25 by 7 mm respectively is aimed for during the<br>
1 0       coating time. In this, the lift change can be performed only at the outer support<br>
or only at the inner support or in combination at the inner and outer support in<br>
opposite directions.<br>
The lift change overtime that is to be controlled, must be performed with high<br>
precision and depends on the targeted erosion profile progression throughout the<br>
15      coating time, the target material, the target thickness, the specified requirements<br>
for the substrate with respect to the layer thickness distribution as well as the<br>
sputter rate. In order to monitor and control the controlled distances, one or<br>
several direct or indirect distance measurements are performed in-situ. Fig. 10<br>
shows a diagram of a sensor arrangement 40 for this. As the outer support is not<br>
2	0      lift-adjusted in this embodiment, the arrangement measures the currently set<br>
distance between the outer support 25 and the inner support 35 and thus the<br>
progression and the current value respectively of dcd(t). The sensor arrangement<br>
40 can, for example, work on the basis of the principle of triangulation<br>
measurements, can be designed as a capacitive or optical sensor, as mechanical<br>
25      sensor etc. With regard to this, it is a good idea to employ a contact-free<br>
measuring sensor arrangement, so that the magnet arrangement does not have<br>
to be electrically insulated against the target, and thus that the distances between<br>
the pole surfaces of the magnet arrangement and the back surface of the target<br>
can be chosen and set respectively at a minimum as well.<br><br>

On principle, the procedure according to the invention makes it possible to adjust<br>
a desired sputter rate distribution progression over a period of time. If<br>
consequently, for example with an arrangement according to Fig. 10, the inner<br>
pair of magnetic loops 7cd is guided along a first target area made of a first<br>
5    material, the outer pair of magnet loops 7ab on the other hand along a target area<br>
made of a second material, and if the target consists of two zones made of<br>
different materials, the relative coating rate of the both materials as well can be<br>
adjusted on the substrate using the procedure in accordance with the invention.<br>
Fig. 15 - in a presentation analogous to that of Fig. 10 - shows a diagram of an<br>
1 0      embodiment, which in principal corresponds to that shown in Fig. 7. This, too,<br>
shows a two-circuit magnetron source. Only the outer magnetic loop 7a is adjusted<br>
in distance with respect to the two magnetic loops 7b and 7Clocated on the inside.<br>
The outer magnetic loop 7a is mounted fixedly with respect to the source casing<br>
31. The inner pair of magnetic loops 7cb is. mounted on a rotation-driven support<br>
15      35a, eccentrically with respect to the axis of rotation A3Sa. On the basis of the<br>
explanations concerning Fig. 10, the simplified illustrated embodiment according to<br>
Fig. 15 is easily understandable for an expert.<br>
Fig. 16 shows - with the sputter output as parameter - the normalised layer<br>
thickness distribution on the substrate and as coating time over the lifetime of the<br>
2	0      target. The distance of the outer pair of magnetic loops 7ab according to Fig. 10 is<br>
1 mm larger than the distance of the inner pair of magnetic loops 7cd. The<br>
progression (a) was measured for a sputter rate of 32 kW, (b) for 28 kW,<br>
progression (c) for 24 kW, (d) for 16 kW and finally progression (e) for 20 kW.<br>
This shows a strong dependency of the resulting layer thickness distribution on the<br>
25     set sputter output. From this it follows, that it is a good concept to keep the sputter<br>
output with respect to the reverse side of the target constant, when performing the<br>
time-controlled adjustment, in accordance with the invention, of the distance of at<br>
least one part of the magnet arrangement generating the magnetron field.<br><br>
WO 2006/034598	PCT/CH2005/000441<br>
- 2 0 -<br>
Furthermore, an unequivocal dependency exists between the discharge<br>
voltage UE and the current sputter rate distribution on the target. Experience<br>
shows, that the discharge voltage decreases with increasing target<br>
utilization, because of the increasing erosion in the outer area of the target.<br>
5      Thus the possibility arises, to record the discharge voltage as a measured<br>
regulating value, to compare it with a target value and to keep it constant in a<br>
controlling sense by tracking the distance of the outer pair of magnetic loops.<br>
As a result, the principal statement is that the discharge voltage for a multi<br>
circuit magnetron source is mainly determined by the sputter effect of the pair<br>
10      of magnetic loops, that causes the highest sputter intensity on the target.<br>
Commonly it is recorded in advance - with the sputter output as parameter - how<br>
the distance adjustment according to the invention should be conducted overtime,<br>
in order to achieve the desired layer thickness distribution on the substrate within<br>
the coating time. The characteristic graphs obtained in that way are stored in<br>
15      tables. The distance adjustment is then - in dependence from the sputter output -<br>
controlled according to the stored graphs. The regulation of the discharge voltage<br>
U[. is then carried out by adjusting the respective distance, if necessary as working<br>
point regulation.<br>
Fig. 17 - by means of a diagram of a signal flow / function block - shows a possible<br>
2	0      concept for the electrical guidance of the magnetron source according to the<br>
invention. The magnetron source 42 has a control input S A2  for the distance<br>
adjusted over time in accordance with the invention of at least one part of the<br>
magnet arrangement generating the magnetron magnet field. The source is<br>
electrically supplied with the adjustable, constant output P by the generator 44. The<br>
25      electrical output P that is set for the operation of the target under consideration, is<br>
fed to a table storage device 46, that stores the time-distance functions d(t,P) that<br>
had been determined in advanced as being required for each of the different output<br>
settings. From the beginning of the sputter coating with the considered target, a<br>
timekeeper 48 controls the read-out of the distance value corresponding to the<br><br>
WO 2006/034598	PCT/CH2005/000441<br>
current coating time from the table storage device 46. The required distance value<br>
is set by the distance control input SA2 at the magnetron source. Via the position<br>
sensor 40 - described, for example, on the basis of Fig. 10 - the accurate adherence<br>
to the currently required distance can be controlled. This position control circuit is<br>
5      not shown in Fig. 17. Furthermore, the discharge voltage U E is measured as an<br>
actual value and compared with a stipulated target discharge voltage Usonat a<br>
comparator circuit 50. The result of the comparison is applied as control difference<br>
A as an adjustment signal to the input S42 of the source 42 via a regulator 52 and a<br>
superposition unit 54. Thus the working point is maintained at the stipulated value<br>
1 0       from table 46 by regulating the discharge voltage.<br>
Fig. 18 shows the magnet arrangement 5 on a single-circuit magnetron source,<br>
with meander shaped magnetic loops 7a and 7b. Both magnetic loops 7a and 7b,<br>
i.e. the pair 7ab, rotate around axis A. Fig. 19 shows the resulting layer thickness<br>
distributions for a substrate with a diameter of 300 mm, if, according to<br>
15      progression (a), the distance of the loop 7b from the back surface of the target is<br>
2 mm larger than the distance of the outer magnetic circuit 7a and if it is reduced<br>
step-by-step by 2 mm in accordance with the progressions (b), (c), (d). From this<br>
is can be seen that even for a single-circuit source or for proceeding in<br>
accordance with the invention at a single-circuit source respectively - as shown<br>
20      by means of Figures 2 and particularly 3 - it is possible to control the current<br>
sputter rate and therefore - for a coating time under consideration up to the<br>
lifetime of the target - the setting and maintenance respectively of a desired<br>
layer thickness distribution on the substrate can be ensured, in particular a<br>
homogeneous, i.e. uniform distribution.<br>
25      With view on the embodiment according to Fig. 10, realized according to Fig. 11, it<br>
was furthermore established that this configuration of a two-circuit magnetron<br>
source results in a reduction of the eddy current losses, when compared with the<br>
single-circuit source according to Fig. 18, which makes it possible to reduce the<br>
necessary drive output for the respective rotation drive by about 20%. In addition,<br><br>

the reduction of eddy currents reduces the resulting stray field in the perimeter of the<br>
