BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an agent for<br>
processing synthetic fibers and a method for<br>
processing synthetic fibers. In recent years, high<br>
speed of the process is further advanced remarkably<br>
in a spinning process or a textured process of the<br>
synthetic fibers, so that it tends to generate a fluff<br>
or a yarn break increasingly in accordance with the<br>
high speed. In order to prevent the generation of the<br>
fluff or the yarn break, it has been carried out that<br>
the agent, where the content ratio of a functional<br>
agent is increased for preventing the generation of<br>
the fluff or the yarn break, is used as an agent for<br>
processing synthetic fibers to be adhered to the<br>
synthetic fibers, or the adhesion amount of the agents<br>
for processing synthetic fibers to the synthetic<br>
fibers is increased. However, it still cannot deal<br>
sufficiently with the problems accompanied with the<br>
high speed in recent years. The present invention<br>
relates to the agent for processing synthetic fibers<br>
and the method for processing synthetic fibers, which<br>
are capable of dealing with the problems accompanied<br>
with the high speed in recent years in the spinning<br>
process or the textured process of the synthetic fibers,<br>
so as to prevent the generation of the fluff or the<br>
yarn break sufficiently.<br>
Description of the Conventional Art<br>
Conventionally, as the agent for processing<br>
synthetic fibers, the agent containing a lubricant and<br>
the functional agent has been used in general. As said<br>
agent for processing synthetic fibers, various agents<br>
containing the functional agent for preventing the<br>
generation of the fluff or the yarn break have been<br>
known, (for example, referring to Japanese Patent Laid<br>
-Open No. 310241-1995, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.<br>
325949-1996, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 61646-<br>
1999). However, in these conventional agents for<br>
processing synthetic fibers, there are problems that<br>
the generation of the fluff or the yarn break cannot<br>
be prevented sufficiently in the spinning process or<br>
the textured process with the high speed in recent<br>
years .<br>
The present invention has the object to provide<br>
the agent for processing synthetic fibers and the<br>
method for processing synthetic fibers, which are<br>
capable of dealing with the problems accompanied with<br>
the high speed in recent years in the spinning process<br>
or the textured process of the synthetic fibers, and<br>
preventing the generation of the fluff or the yarn<br>
break sufficiently.<br>

the above - described problems and, as a result, it has<br>
been found out that the agent for processing synthetic<br>

the functional agent, is surely preferable, and<br>
adhering the predetermined amount of said agent for<br>
processing synthetic fibers to the synthetic fibers<br>

atoms or alkenyl group with 2-24 carbon atoms, and A<br>
is a residual group obtained by removing all hydroxyl<br>
groups from (poly) alkyleneglycol having a (poly)<br>

When one or more than two of R1, R2 and R3 in Formula<br>
1 are the organic group shown by Formula 2, the<br>
following organic groups are contained as said organic<br>
group, that is, (1) the organic group in the case that<br>
R4 in Formula 2 is a hydrogen atom, and A is the residual<br>
group obtained by removing all hydroxyl groups from<br>
alkyleneglycol having one oxyalkylene unit with 2-4<br>
carbon atoms, (2) the organic group in the case that<br>
R4 in Formula 2 is the alkyl group with 1-24 carbon<br>
atoms, and A is the residual group obtained by removing<br>
all hydroxyl groups from alkyleneglycol having one<br>
oxyalkylene unit with 2-4 carbon atoms, (3) the organic<br>
group in the case that R4 in Formula 2 is the alkenyl<br>
group with 2-24 carbon atoms, and A is the residual<br>
group obtained by removing all hydroxyl groups from<br>
alkyleneglycol having one oxyalkylene unit with 2-4<br>
carbon atoms, (4) the organic group in the case that<br>
R4 in Formula 2 is a hydrogen atom, and A is the residual<br>
group obtained by removing all hydroxyl groups from<br>
polyalkyleneglycol having the polyoxyalkylene group<br>
composed of 2-50 oxyalkylene units with 2-4 carbon<br>
atoms, (5) the organic group in the case that R4 in<br>
Formula 2 is the alkyl group with 1-24 carbon atoms,<br>
and A is the residual group obtained by removing all<br>
hydroxyl groups from polyalkyleneglycol having the<br>
polyoxyalkylene group composed of 2-50 oxyalkylene<br>
units with 2-4 carbon atoms, (6) the organic group in<br>
the case that R4 in Formula 2 is the alkenyl group with<br>
2-24 carbon atoms, and A is the residual group obtained<br>
by removing all hydroxyl groups from<br>
polyalkyleneglycol having the polyoxyalkylene group<br>
composed of 2-50 oxyalkylene units with 2-4 carbon<br>
atoms.<br>
R4 in Formula 2 is a hydrogen atom, the alkyl group<br>
with 1-24 carbon atoms or the alkenyl group with 2-24<br>
carbon atoms. As for the alkyl group with 1-24 carbon<br>
atoms and the alkenyl group with 2-24 carbon atoms,<br>
the above description with respect to R1, R2 and R3 is<br>
similarly applied. It is preferable that the<br>
phosphoric ester shown by Formula 1 is the ester where<br>
R4 in Formula 2 is the hydrogen atom.<br>
As A in Formula 2, (1) the residual group obtained<br>
by removing all hydroxyl groups from alkyleneglycol<br>
having one oxyalkylene unit with 2-4 carbon atoms, and<br>
(2) the residual group obtained by removing all<br>
hydroxyl groups from polyalkyleneglycol having the<br>
polyoxyalkylene group composed of 2-50 oxyalkylene<br>
units with 2-4 carbon atoms, are contained as described<br>
above. However, as A in Formula 2, the residual group<br>
obtained by removing all hydroxyl groups from<br>
polyalkyleneglycol having the polyoxyalkylene group<br>
composed of 2-50 oxyalkylene units with 2-4 carbon<br>
atoms, is preferable. As the oxyalkylene unit with 2-4<br>
carbon atoms composing said polyoxyalkylene group,<br>
although oxyethylene unit, oxypropylene unit and<br>
oxybutylene unit can be used, the oxyethylene unit and<br>
the oxypropylene unit are preferable, and the<br>
oxyethylene unit is more preferable. Moreover, it is<br>
preferable that the total number of repeating said<br>
oxyalkylene units is two to fifteen. When the<br>
polyoxyalkylene group is composed with more than two<br>
oxyalkylene units, which are different each other, a<br>
random link or a block link can be used as a linking<br>
means.<br>
Therefore, as the phosphoric ester shown by<br>
Formula 1, the phosphoric ester where A in Formula 2<br>
is the residual group obtained by removing all hydroxyl<br>
groups from polyalkyleneglycol having the<br>
polyoxyalkylene group composed of 2-50 oxyalkylene<br>
units with 2-4 carbon atoms, is preferable, and the<br>
phosphoric ester where A in Formula 2 is the residual<br>
group obtained by removing all hydroxyl groups from<br>
polyalkyleneglycol having the polyoxyalkylene group<br>
composed of 2-15 oxyalkylene units with 2 or 3 carbon<br>
atoms is more preferable, and it is especially<br>
preferable that said polyalkyleneglycol is<br>
polyethyleneglycol .<br>
The above - described phosphoric ester shown by<br>
Formula 1 can be produced by the publicly known method.<br>
For example, one of the methods which can be used is<br>
adding the predetermined amount of a phosphorous<br>

to obtain a phosphoric ester and thereafter carrying<br>
out an addition reaction of alkyleneoxide to said<br>
phosphoric ester.<br>

by cooling. After adhering the prepared 10 % aqueous<br>
solution to the traveling yarn to have the adhesion<br>
amount described in Table 3 as the agents for<br>
processing synthetic fibers by the oiling jet with<br>
metering pump, the yarn was bundled by the guide, and<br>
wound at the speed of 3000 m / minute without causing<br>
elongation mechanically . Then, a par tial or i en ted yarn<br>
of a 128 decitex 36 filament was obtained as a 10kg<br>
cake .<br>
• False-twisting process<br>
The false-twisting process was carried out under<br>
the following conditions by a contact type False-<br>
twisting Apparatus, by using said cake.<br>
• • Conditions of the False-twisting process by the<br>
contact type False-twisting Apparatus :<br>
By using the contact type False - twisting<br>
Apparatus (SDS 1200 of Teijin Seiki Co., Ltd.), the<br>
false - twisting process was carried out with a<br>
continuous operation for 25 days under the following<br>
conditions, that is, a yarn speed was 800 m / minute,<br>
a draw ratio was 1.652, a twisting method was a friction<br>
disc method, which had one inlet side guide disc, one<br>
outlet side guide disc and seven rigid polyurethane<br>
discs, a length of a primary heater was 2.5 m, an<br>
surface temperature of said primary heater was 210 °C,<br>
there was no secondary heater, and a target twist<br>
number was 3300 T / m.<br>
• Evaluation of fluff<br>
In said false-twisting process, the number of<br>
fluff per hour was measured by a Fray counter (DT-<br>
105 of Toray Engineering Co., Ltd.), before winding<br>
the false-twisting processed yarn, and said number was<br>
evaluated with the following basis. These results were<br>
shown in Table 3.<br>
AAA : The number of measured fluff was 0.<br><br>
AA : The number of measured fluff was 1.<br>
A : The number of measured fluff was 2 to 5.<br>
B : The number of measured fluff was 6 to 9.<br>
C : The number of measured fluff was more than<br>
10 .<br>
• Evaluation of the yarn break<br>
In said false -twisting process, the number of<br>
times of the yarn break generated during the continuous<br>
operation for 25 days was converted to the number of<br>
times per hour, and evaluated with the following basis.<br>
These results were shown in Table 3.<br>
AAA : The number of times of the generated yarn<br>
break was 0 .<br>
AA : The number of times of the generated yarn<br>
break was less than 1, (but excluding 0).<br>
A : The number of times of the generated yarn break<br>
was not less than 1 but less than 2.<br>
B : The number of times of the generated yarn break<br>
was not less than 2 but less than 3.<br>
C : The number of times of the generated yarn break<br>
was not less than 3.<br><br>
In Table 3 , the adhesion amount was the adhesion %<br>
of the agent for processing synthetic fibers to the<br>
synthetic fibers.<br>
The above - explained present invention has, as<br>
clearly shown above, effects capable of dealing with<br>
the problem accompanied with the high speed in the<br>
spinning process or the textured process of the<br>
synthetic fibers in recent years, and preventing the<br>
generation of the fluff or the yarn break sufficiently.<br>
