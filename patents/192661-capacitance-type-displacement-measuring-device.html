The  present  invention  relates  to  a  capacitance-type lisplacement  measuring  device  used  for  a  small  measurir ievice  such  as  an  electric  micrometer,   hole  test,   dial jauge,   angle-measuring  equipment  and  the  like.<br><br>
Numerous  capacitance-type  measuring  device  for  mak Linear  or  angular  measurements  have  been  developed  when two  scales,   on  which  are  respectively  arranged, ^apacitively  coupled  electrodes,   are  displaced  relativ
Fig.29   shows  a  scheme  of  a  prior  capacitance-type displacement  measuring  device.   The  device  comprises  a first  and  second  scales  displaced  to  relatively  movabl On  the  first  scale,   a  plurality  of  first  transmitting electrodes  1  are  arranged  with  a  constant  space,   and receiving  electrode  4  is  disposed  along  the  longitudir direction  of  the  scale.   In  this  case,   each  unit  of  the<br><br>
first  transmitting  electrodes  1  consists  of  8  electrodes. 8-phases  sine  wave  signals,   which  are  pulsed  based  on  the clock  pulse  from  an  oscillator  5,   and  whose  phases  are mutually  shifted  by  45°,   are  generated  from  a  pulse modulating  circuit  5  to  be  supplied  to  the  first transmitting  electrodes  1.   Therefore,   the  width  of  each unit  of  the  transmitting  electrodes  1  is  equal  to  a transmitting  wavelength  pitch  Wtl.<br>
As  disposed  on  the  second  scale  are  arranged  second receiving  electrodes  2  with  a  pitch  Pr2  equal  to  the transmitting  wavelength  pitch  Wtl,   which  are  capacitively coupled  to  4  transmitting  electrodes  1  on  the  first scale   .   Also  disposed  on  the  second  scale  are  second transmitting  electrodes  3  which  are  electrically  connected with  the  second  receiving  electrodes  2  and  capacitively coupled  to  the  first  receiving  electrode  4  on  the  first scale.   The  first  receiving  electrode  4  is  connected  to  a measuring  circuit  7.<br>
In  the  device  as  described  above,   when  the  first  and second  scales  are  relatively  moved,   phase  of  received signal  vary  based  on  the  capacitive  coupling  between  the first  transmitting  electrodes  1  and  the  second  receiving electrodes  2.   It  is  able  to  measure  displacement  by sensing  the  phase  variation  of  the  received  signal.   In this  case,   since  the  device  has  8  transmitting  electrodes, and  these  electrodes—are  driven  by  multi-phase  signals,   as Dhase  shifted  with  respect  to  each  other  by  45°,   it  is<br><br>
able  to  determine  a  measurement    position  within  a precision  of  Pr2/8.<br>
If  the  first  and  second  scales  in  the  above-described capacitance-type  measuring  device  are  formed  of  coaxial cylindrical  members,   it  is  able  to  obtain  a  small cylindrical  displacement  sensor.<br>
Fig.SOA  and  Fig.308  show  an  example  of  expanded electrode  patterns  of  outer  cylindrical  member  (i.e., stator)   and  inner  cylindrical  member  (i.e.,   rotor)   in  such a  cylindrical  displacement  sensor.   As  shown  in  these figures,   two  units  A,   B  of  first  transmitting  electrodes 1,   each  of  the  units  having  8  electrodes,   and  s  first receiving  electrode  4     are  formed  on  the  inner  surface  of the  stator.   Two  units  of  second  receiving  electrodes  2 opposed  to  first  transmitting  electrodes  1  and  second transmitting  electrodes  3  opposed  to  the  first  receiving electrode  4  are  formed  on  the  outer  surface  of  the  rotor.<br>
For  manufacturing  such  a  cylindrical  displacement sensor,   it  is  necessary  to  form  electrode  patterns  on  a cylindrical  surface.   Several  methods  for  forming  such electrode  patterns,   especially  electrode  patterns  on  the stator,   for  example,   have  been  provided  as  follows:   (1) electrode  patterns  are  formed  on  a  flexible  print  circuit (FPC)   substrate,   then  the  FPC  is  affixed  to  the  inner surface  of  a  cylindrical  member  (refer  to  USP  5,239,307); (2)  electrode  patterns  are  formed  on  the  surface  of  a cylindrical  member  by  laser  beam  machining   (refer  to<br><br>
German  Patent  No.   3,426,750   ).<br>
Further,   for  making  a  highly  precise  measurement,   it is  necessary  to  dispose  the  stator  and  the  rotor  with  a high  concentricity.   However,   it  is  difficult  to  obtain  a high  concentricity  in  a  small  cylindrical   sensor.   For realizing  highly  precise  measurement  in  spite  of  that  the concentricity  is  bad,   it  is  necessary  to  arrange  at  least two  units  of  electrodes,   as  shown  in  Fig.30A  and  SOB. When  two  units  of  electrodes  are  arranged  in  angular direction,   the  influence  of  misalignment  between  the stator  and  the  rotor  can  be  canceled  by  averaging  the  two outputs  of  the  electrode  units.<br>
However,   several  problems  are  remained  in  such  a cylindrical  displacement  sensor  in  the  conventional  arts. First,   it  is  difficult  to  form  electrode  patterns  on  a cylindrical  member  by  use  the  above-mentioned  methods. Especially,   smaller  the  cylindrical  member  is,   more difficult  the  process  for  forming  the  precise  patterns becomes.   Second,   It  is  difficult  to  connect  the  electrode patterns  on  the  inner  surface  of  the  cylindrical  member  t( an  external  measuring  circuit,   and  to  assemble  a  stator and  a  rotor.   If  it  is  necessary  to  form  2  units  of electrodes  for  solving  the  problem  of  concentricity,   the wirings  between  the  sensor  and  the  external  measuring circuit  become  more  complicated,   and  operation  process becomes  more  complicated,   too.   Since  there  are  problems  t be  solved  as  above  described,   the  cylindrical  displacemen<br><br>
sensor  is  not  yet  practically  used.<br><br>
An  object  of  the  present  invention  is  to  provide  a capacitance-type  measuring  device  which  can  be  readily wired  and  constructed,   and  whose  electrode  patterns  can  be easily  formed.<br>
Another  object  of  the  present  invention  is  to  provide a  capacitance-type  measuring  device  which  is  not  necessary for  highly  concentricity,   thereby  electrode  patterns  can be  simplified.<br>
A  first  aspect  of  the  present  invention  is  a capacitance-type  measuring  device  for  measuring  relative position  between  first  and  second  elements  which  are arranged  to  be  relatively  movable  with  a  predetermined gap,   comprising:   an  array  of  transmitting  electrodes -      disposed  on  the  first  element,   alternating  signals  having different  phases  from  each  other  being  supplied  to  each transmitting  electrode;   a  receiving  electrode  disposed  on the  first  element  such  as  to  be  isolated  from  the  array  of transmitting  electrodes;   and  a  coupling  electrode  disposed on  the  second  element  to  be  capacitively  coupled  to  plural electrodes  in  the  array  of  transmitting  electrodes  and  th€ receiving  electrode,   the  receiving  electrode  being  adaptec to  output  an  electric  signal  corresponding  to  a  relative position  between  the  first  and  second  elements,   the electric  signal  being  supplied  to  a  measuring  circuit.<br><br>
wherein  one  of  the  first  and  second  elements  is  an  inner member  having  a  cylindrical  outer  surface,   the  other  is  an outer  member  having  an  incomplete  cylindrical  inner surface  which  is  opposed  to  the  outer  surface  with  a predetermined  gap,   the  first  and  second  elements  being held  to  be  relatively  movable  in  either  axial  direction  or angular  direction,   and  the  array  of  transmitting electrodes  and  the  receiving  electrode  are  disposed  on  one of  the  outer  surface  of  the  inner  member  and  the  inner surface  of  the  outer  member,   and  the  coupling  electrode  is disposed  on  the  other  surface.<br>
A  second  aspect  of  the  present  invention  is  a capacitance-type  measuring  device  for  measuring  relative position  between  first  and  second  elements  which  are arranged  to  be  relatively  movable  with  a  predetermined gap,   comprising:   an  array  of  transmitting  electrodes disposed  on  the  first  element,   alternating  signals  having different  phases  from  each  other  being  supplied  to  each transmitting  electrode;   a  receiving  electrode  disposed  on the  first  element  such  as  to  be  isolated  from  the  array  of transmitting  electrodes;   and  a  coupling  electrode  disposed on  the  second  element  to  be:  capacitively  coupled  to  plural electrodes  in  the  array  of  itransmitting  electrodes  and  the receiving  electrode,   the  rejceiving  electrode  being  adapted to  output  an  electric  signal  corresponding  to  a  relative position  between  the  first 'and  second  elements,   the electric  signal  being  supplied  to  a  measuring  circuit.<br><br>
wherein  one  of  the  first  and  second  member  having  a  cylindrical  outer  surface,   the  other  is  an outer  member  having  an  cylindrical  inner  surface  which  is opposed  to  the  outer  surface  with  a  predetermined  gap,   the first  and  second  elements  being  held  to  be  relatively movable  in  either  axial  direction  or  angular  direction, and  one  of  the  array  of  transmitting  electrodes  and  the coupling  electrode  is  disposed  on  the  outer  surface  of  the inner  member,   the  other  is  disposed  on  the  inner  surface of  the  outer  member,   both  of  the  array  of  transmitting electrodes  and  the  coupling  electrode  having  spiral patterns  with  the  same  lead  angle.<br>
In  the  first  aspect,   the  device  comprises  the  inner element  having  the  cylindrical  outer  surface  and  the  outer element  having  the  incomplete  cylindrical  inner  surface half  surrounding  the  inner  element.   Since  the  outer element  is,   for  example,   an  incomplete  cylinder  whose  side portion  is  open,   it  is  easy  to  form  electrode  patterns  in the  inne:^  surface,   to  lead  out  the  wire,   and  to  construct the  elements.   For  example.   If  the  electrode  patterns  and the  lead  wire  thereof  are  formed  on  an  FPC  substrate,   and then  affixed  to  the  inner  surface  of  the  outer  element, the  process  for  forming  the  electrode  patterns  including the  lead  wire  becomes  to  be  easy.<br>
In  the  second  aspect,   by  use  of  combination  of  a complete  cylinder-and  an  incomplete  cylinder,   or combination  of  two  complete  cylinders  for  a  stator  and  a<br><br>
rotor,   and  by  arranging  the  transmitting  electrodes  and the  coupling  electrodes  with  spiral  patterns,   it  is  able to  obtain  a  displacement  sensor  for  measuring  angular displacement.   In  the  displacement  sensor,   even  if  the  axes are  misaligned  between  the  rotor  and  the  stater,   the  gap between  the  transmitting  electrodes  and  the  coupling electrodes  opposed  each  other  is  averaged  in  angular direction  to  be  approximately  constant.   Therefore,   even  if the  concentricity  is  not  high,   it  is  able  to  obtain  a  high measurement  precise.   Further,   if,   on  each  of  the  stator and  rotor,   two  sets  of  electrode  patterns  having  a  reverse patterns  each  other  are  arranged,   the  influence  of misalignment  in  axial  direction  between  the  stator  and  the rotor  can  be  canceled,   and  it  is  able  to  measure  angular displacement  with  high  precise.<br><br>

DETAILED  DEgeRIPTION -eP-IWE  PREFERRED  EMBi^iMENTS<br><br>
In  the  bellow-described  rotary  encoders  according  tu the  embodiments,  cylindrical  inner  members  serve  as rotors,   and  cylindrical  or  incomplete  cylindrical  outer members  surrounding  the  inner  members  serve  as  stators. Electrode  patterns  are  formed  on  the  outer  surfaces  of  the rotors  and  the  inner  surfaces  of  the  stators.     However, corresponding  to  applications,   it  is  able  to  exchange  the function  of  the  inner  and  outer  members    such  that  the inner  members  serve  as  stators,   and  the  outer  members serve  as  rotors.     In  every  modes,   it  is  preferable  that transmitting  and  receiving  electrodes,   which  are  connected to  driving  and  measuring  circuits,   are  formed  on  the stators.<br>
Fig.   1  shows  an  electric  micrometer  according  to  a first  embodiment  of  the  present  invention.   In  the micrometer,   a  spindle  101  is  held  in  a  case  103,   and  is able  to  slide  by  a  knob  102.   In  the  case  103,   a  rotary encoder  10  is  installed  for  measuring  the  displacement  of the  spindle  101,   and  the  measured  value  is  displayed  on  a display  104.   Several  switches  105  are  mounted  near  to  the display  104.<br>
Fig.IB  is  an  expanded  section  about  a  region  106  in Fig.lA  for  showing  the  installed  state  of  the  rotary encoder  10.   The  rotary  encoder  10  comprises  a  rotor  12 mounted  on  the  spindle  101  and  a  stator  11  installed  on the  inney  surface  of  the  case  103  so  as  to  oppose  the—-outer  surface  of  the  rotor  12.  The  rotor  12  consists  of  a<br><br>
cylindrical   axle  coaxial  with  the  spindle   101,   and  the stator  11  consists  of  a  halfway  cylindrical  collar  which has  an  incomplete  inner  surface  opposed  to  the  outer surface  of  the  rotor  12  with  a  predetermined  gap.   A  screw 108   attached  on  the  end  portion  of  the  rotor   12   is  trappec in  a  longitudinal  groove  107  formed  on  the  outer  surface of  the  rotor  12  so  as  to  be  movable  along  the  groove  107. The  rotor  12  is  forced  to  the  inner  surface  of  the  case 103  by  a  spring  109  to  be  prevented  from  displacement  in axial  direction  against  to  the  case  103.   When  the  spindle 101   rotates  and  linearly  displace  in  axial  direction,   the rotor   12  rotates  together  with  the  spindle  101,   but  does not  displace  in  axial  direction.   Therefore,   the  rotor  12 is  movable  in  only  angular  direction  against  to  the  stator 11   in  accordance  with  the  rotating  and  linear  displacement of  the  spindle  101,   thereby  the  rotated  displacement  can be  measured.<br>
Fig.2A  and  Fig.2B  show  the  installed  state  and  the side  view  of  the  rotary  encoder  10,   respectively.   Fig.2C and  Fig.2D  show  the  inner  surface  of  the  stator  11  and  the outer  surface  of  the  rotor  12,   which  are  rolled  out, respectively.   The  rotor  12  is  arranged  to  be  coaxial  with the  stator  11  with  a  predetermined  gap  of  0.1   to  0.2  mm  so as  to  be  relatively  movable.<br>
As  shown  in  Fig.2C,   as  disposed  on  the  inner  surface of  the  stator  11,   are  an  array  of  transmitting  electrodes 13  and  a  receiving  electrode  14,   which  are  insulated  from<br><br>
each  other.   The  array  of  transmitting  electrodes   13   is arranged  with  rectangular  patterns  longitudinal  in  axial direction  at  a  predetermined  pitch  in  angular  direction. The  array  of  transmitting  electrodes   13,   in  this embodiment,   is  composed  of  1  unit  of  N  electrodes   (N  is  an integer  of  2  or  more).   N  alternating  signals  which  are phase  shifted  by  360°/N    each  other  are  supplied  in numerical  sequence  to  the  N  transmitting  electrodes  13. In  this  embodiment,   N=8.   The  receiving  electrode  14  is disposed  near  to  the  transmitting  electrode  array  13   in axial  direction  on  the  inner  surface  of  the  stator  11  with a  rectangular  pattern  longitudinal   in  angular  direction.<br>
The transmitting electrode array 13 and the receiving electrode 14 are actually formed together with lead lines 15, 16 on an FPC substrate 17, as shown by a dotted line, and the FPC substrate 17 are affixed to the inner surface of the stator 11. The lead wires 15 and 16 are drawn out from each edge of the stator 11 and connected to external driving/measuring  circuit.<br>
On  the  outer  surface  of  the  rotor  12,   as   shown  in Fig.2D,   two  coupling  electrodes   18   and  two  ground electrodes  19  are  disposed.   The  coupling  electrodes  18  are formed  with  rectangular  patterns  whose  length  in  axial direction  of  the  patterns  covers  the  transmitting electrode  array  13  and  the  receiving  electrode  14,   and whose  width  in  angular  direction  covers   four  transmitting electrodes  13.   The  coupling  electrodes  18  serve  to  receive<br><br>
the  transmitted  signal   from  the  transmitting  electrode array  13  with  capacitive  coupling,   and  serve  to  transmit the  received  signal  to  the  receiving  electrode  14  with capacitive  coupling.   These  electrodes  18  and  19   are actually  formed  on  an  FPC  substrate,   and  affixed  to  the outer  surface  of  the  rotor  12.   The  grounded  electrodes  19 can  be  omitted.<br>
The  arrangement  of  electrodes  in  the  rotary  encoder according  to  the  embodiment  is  equivalent  to  that  of  the conventional  encoder  shown  in  Figs.31A,   31B.   Therefore, the  half-cycle   nx    (where  r  is  radius  of  the  outer  surface of  the  rotor  12)   is  equal  to  the  transmitting  wavelength pitch  Wtl   and  the  receiving  electrode  pitch  Pr2  shown  in Figs.   31A,   31B.   As  a  result,   according  to   this  embodiment, it   is  able  to  measure  the  angular  displacement  with  a  high precise  of   or  more.<br>
Fig.3   shows  a  brief  construction  of  the driving/measuring  circuit  of  the  rotary  encoder  10.   This circuit  includes  an  oscillator  21  which  generates  a  clock signal,   and  a  pulse  modulator  22  which  output  eight  phases alternating  signals  synchronized  with  the  clock  signal   anc phase-shifted  with  45°   each  other  to  the  transmitting electrode  array  13.<br>
The  output  of  the  receiving  electrode  14,   which changes  corresponding  to  the  relative  rotation  between  th rotor  12  and  the  stator  11,   is  given  to  an  integrator  23,<br><br><br>
comparator  24.   The  comparator  24  compares  the  phase difference  between  the  input  signal  and  a  reference signal,   and  detects  a  relative  displacement  between  the rotor  12  and  the  stator  11  corresponding  to  an  amount  of the  phase-shift.   The  output  signal  of  the  comparator  24   is input   to  a  counter  25.   The  counter  25  counts  the  clock signals   from  the  oscillator  21   in  accordance  to  the detected  signal  of  the  comparator  24,   and   the  amount  of the  relative  displacement  between  the  rotor  12  and  the stator  11  are  displayed  on  the  display  26  with  numerical values.<br>
According  to  the  embodiment,   because  of  that  the stator  11  is  composed  of  a  halfway  cylindrical  member,   it is  easy  to  form  the  electrode  patterns  and  the  lead  wires on  the  inner  surface  of  the  stator   11   by  use  of  a  FPC substrate.   Even  if  the  FPC  substrate  is  not  used,   the electrode  patterns  can  be  easily  formed  on  the  inner surface  of  the  stator  by  use  of,   for  example,   laser  beam machining  technology.   Alternatively,   because  the  stator  1 has  an  opening  longitudinal   in  axial  direction,   a  laser beam  can  be  easily  irradiated  to  the  inner  surface  of  the stator  11   through  the  opening.   It  is  also  easy  to conned lead  wires  to  the  electrode  patterns  on  the  inner  surface of  the  stator  11  by  soldering,   thermocompression  bonding, and  the  like.<br>
Figs.4A  and  4B,   each  corresponding  to  Figs.   2C  and  21 respectively,   show  the  rolled  out  electrode  patterns<br><br>
according  to  another  example  of  the  rotary  encoder   10.   As shown  in  Fig,4A,   the  transmitting  electrode  array   13  on the  inner  surface  of  the  stator   11   are  composed  of  N electrodes  disposed  in  parallel  each  other  with  spiral patterns   (where  N=8  in  this  embodiment).   The  receiving electrode   14  is  disposed  near  to  the  transmitting electrode  array  13   in  axial  direction  with  a  rectangular pattern  longitudinal   in  angular  direction.   The  coupling electrodes   18  on  the  outer  surface  of  the  rotor  12,   as shown  in  Fig.4B,   have  receiving  portions   18a  opposed  to transmitting  electrode  array  13   and  a  transmitting  portion 18b  opposed  to  the  receiving  electrode   14.   The  receiving portions   18a  are   formed  of  spiral  patterns  with  the  same lead  angle  as  the  transmitting  electrode  array  13,   and  the transmitting  porrion  18b  is   formed  of  a  rectangular pattern  similar  to  the  receiving  electrode  14,   and connected  to  the  receiving  portions  18a.      In  Fig.4B,   the overlapping  state  between  the  transmitting  electrode  array 13,   the  receiving  electrode   14   and  the  coupling  electrodes 18   is  shown  by  dotted  lines.   The  coupling  electrodes  18 are  disposed  at  the  same  pitch  Pr  as  the  transmitting wavelength  Wtl  with  widths  covering  four  transmitting electrodes  13.   In  the  rotary  encoder  of  Fig.2,   the  phase change  in  one  revolution  of  the  rotor   12   is  360°x  2=720°. In  contrast,   in  the  rotary  encoder  in  Fig.   4,   the  phase change  in  one  revolution  of  the  rotor  12  is  360°.<br>
In  this  embodiment,   the  electrode  patterns  and  the<br><br>
lead  wires  can  be  formed  of  an  FPC  substrate  as  same  as the  above-described  embodiment.   In  this  case,   as  shown  in Fig.4C,   the  FPC  substrate   17  on  which  the  lead   linen   15, 16   are  formed  are  dragged  not   from  the  edges,   but  through the  side  opening  of  the  stator  11.<br>
According  to  the  embodiment,   even  if  the  concentricity between  the  stator  11   and  the  rotor  12   is  not   sufficient, the  installing  precision  does  not  give  a  large  influence for  measuring  precision.   Because,   as  a  result  of  using  the spiral  electrode  patterns,   the  intensity  of  the  output signal  is  equalized  in  angular  direction.   Further,   since the  lead  lines   15,   16  are  drawn  out  in  perpendicular  to the  axis  of  the  encoder,   the  interference  between  the coupling  electrodes   18  on  the  rotor   12   and  the  lead  lines 15,   16   is  decreased.<br>
Fig.SA  and  Fig.SB  show  electrode  patterns  according  to another  embodiment,   corresponding  to  Fig.4A  and  Fig.48, respectively.   In  this  embodiment,   the  receiving  electrode 14  on  the  stator   11   is  disposed  near  to  the  transmitting electrode  array  13  in  angular  direction,   and  has  a rectangular  pattern  longitudinal   in  axial  direction.   The coupling  electrode  18  on  the  outer  surface  of  the  rotor  12 is   formed  of  only  a  spiral  pattern  capacitively  coupled  tc both  the  transmitting  electrode  array   13   and  the  receiving electrode   14,   with  the  same  lead  angle  as  the  transmittinc a^ ar^i-Trnde  array  13.   Alternatively,   the  receiving  portion<br><br>
coupled  to  the  transmitting  electrode  array   13,   can  not  be distinguished   from  the  transmitting  portion  of   the coupling  electrode  18,   which  is  capacitively  coupled  to the  receiving  electrode  14,   and  these  portions  are  formed of  a  continuous   spiral  pattern.<br>
According  to  the  embodiment,   the  variation  of  the  gaps between  each  of  the  transmitting  electrodes   13   and  the coupling  electrode  18,   and  the  variation  of  the  gaps between  the  coupling  electrode  18  and  the  receiving electrode  14  are  equalized  to  be  decreased.<br>
Figs.6A  and   6B  show  expanded  electrode  patterns according  to  another  embodiment,   corresponding  to  Figs.4A and  4B,   respectively.   In  this  embodiment,   the  coupling electrode   18   is  divided  into  a  plurality  of  electrodes uniformly  spaced  with  a  pitch  obtained  by  dividing  the transmitting  wavelength  Wtl  by  an  integer  n   (=2  or  more). In  details,   the  coupling  electrode   18   in  the  above-described  embodiments   is  divided  into  5  electrodes,   then these  electrodes  are  disposed  at  a  pitch  of   Z/rr/lO    with spiral  patterns.   Although  eight  transmitting  electrodes array  13  have  the  same  patterns  as  that  in  Fig.4A,   the phases  of  alternating  signals  are  different  from  that  in Fig.4A.   Alternatively,   eight  phases  alternating  signals whose  phases  are  sequentially  shifted  of  135°   are  supplied to  the  transmitting  electrodes  13,   as  shown  in  Fig.   6A.<br>
According  to  this  embodiment,   when  the  rotor  12 rotates  1/10  revolution   (i.e.,   36°),   the  phase  change  of<br><br>
the  output  signal   is  just  360°.   In  other  words,   when  the rotor   12   rotates  one  revolution,   the  output  signal  changes for  10  periods.   The  principle  of  the  measuring  method  and the  detailed  measuring  circuit  in  the  above-mentioned embodiment  has  been  described  in  details   in  USP4,878,013 specification.<br>
Fig.7  shows  the  measuring  circuit,   and  Fig,8   shows   the signal  waveforms  and  the  relations  between  the  signals  as the  horizontal  axis  serves  as  time.   In  Fig.7,   a  block  100 is  a  rotary  encoder.   A  plurality  of  alternating  signals which  have  different  phase  from  each  other  are  supplied  to the  transmitting  electrodes.   An  oscillator  400,   which generates  an  alternating  signal  having  a   frequency selected  in  100  to  200kHz,   is  used  as  a  signal  generating source.   An  output   fO  from  the  oscillator  400   is  divided  bji a   frequency  divider  600,   thereafter  transformed  into  eight alternating  signals,   whose  phases  are  shifted  with  135° each  at  a  phase  transformer  340.   Then  the  alternating signals  are  modulated  by  the  output  fO  at  a  modulator  620 to  be  eight  signals  200-1,   200-2,   --,   200-8  which  are supplied  to  the  transmitting  electrodes.<br>
The  rotary  encoder  100  is  driven  by  the  output  signal 202  from  the  modulator  620,   and  outputs  a  displacement signal   from  the  receiving  electrode.   The  displacement signal   is  amplified  by  a  differential   amplifier  640  to  be output  as  a  signal  204,   The^envelope  of  the  output  signal 204  is,   as  shown  in  Fig.8,   a  sine  waveform.   The  output<br><br>
signal   204  is  then  demodulated  in  a  demodulator  660  which is   synchronized  by  the  output   fO  of  the  oscillator  400. Comparing  the  phase  of  the  demodulated  signal   206   and  the reference  signal  300  generated  when  the  rotor  is  at  a reference  point,   phase  difference   0    is  obtained.   The phase  difference   0    is  determined  by  the  relative  position between  the  rotor  and  the  stator.<br>
The  demodulated  signal   206  including  harmonic components  is  passed  through  a  filter  680  to  be  less distorted  signal  208.   The  signal   208   is  input  to  a  zero-cross  circuit  700  to  be  detected  a  zero-cross  position  of the  waveform.   In  this  circuit,   a  counter  720  is  used  as  a digital  calculating  means   for  obtaining  the  above-mentioned  phase  d.i f f erence   0 .<br>
The  reset/start  signals   for  the  counter  720  is synchronized  with  the  trigger  signal  of  the  demodulator 660  and  a  control  unit  800.   The  zero-cross  point   signal  of the  reference  signal   is  used  as  start  trigger  of   the counter  720.     The  counting  timing  is  controlled  by  the output   fO  of  the  oscillator  400.   The  counting  operation  is stopped  by  the  output  of  the  zero-cross  circuit  700. Alternatively,   the  zero-cross  circuit  700  generates  a  stop signal  at  the  position  corresponding  to  the  phase difference   <f>,     as  shown  in  Fig. 8.<br>
A  count  value  210  in  the  counter  720  shows  an  amount of  the  phase  sift  of  the  reference  signal  300  by  the rotary  encoder  100.   The  count  value  210  corresponding  to<br><br>
the  phase  difference  is  processed  in  an  arithmetic  circuit 740  to  be  converted  into  a  position  signal.   The  converted position  signal   is  supplied  to  a  display  780  through  a driver  760.   The  display  780  displays  a  measured  value  in  a digital  manner.<br>
Figs.9A  and  9B  show  electrode  patterns  in  a  rotary encoder  according  to  another  embodiment  which  has  A,   B sets  of  electrode  patterns  shown  in  Figs.4A  and  43  in axial  direction.   The  receiving  electrode  14  on  the  inner surface  of  the  stator  11   is  commonly  used  for  A  and  B sets.   The  transmitting  electrode  array  13   in  A  and  B  sets have  reverse  spiral  patterns  each  other.   Each corresponding  transmitting  electrodes   13   in  A  and  B  sets is  commonly  driven  by  the  same  phase  signal.<br>
Corresponding  to  the  electrode  pattern  in  the  stator 11,   A  and  B  sets  of  coupling  electrodes  18  are  disposed  on the  outer  surface  of  the  rotor  12  in  axial  direction  with reverse  spiral  patterns  each  other.<br>
According  to  the  embodiment,   the  phases  of  A  and  B portions  change  in  the  same  direction  in  accordance  with rotating  of  the  rotor  12.   In  contrast,   the  phases  of  A  and B  portions  change  in  reverse  directions  each  other  in accordance  with  linear  moving  of  the  rotor  12  in  axial direction.   Therefore,   unnecessary  phase  shifts  in  A  and  B sets  can  be  automatically  canceled  on  the  output  signal. As  a  result,   influence  of  variation  in  axial  direction  can be  reduced.<br><br>
In  the  embodiment  of  Figs.   9A,   9B,   the  smaller  the difference  between  the  signal  intensities   in  A  and  B portions   is,   the  larger  the  effect  of  canceling  influence of  variation  in  axial  direction  is.      Fig.lOA  and  Fig.108 show  electrode  patterns  according  to  another  embodiment, each  corresponding  to  Fig.   9A  and  Fig.9B.   In  this embodiment,   different  to  Figs.   9A,   9B,   the  coupling electrodes  18  are  separated  from  each  other  between  A  and B  portions,   as   shown  in  Fig.lOB,   by  a  separation  area  C. In  accordance  with  the  separation  of  the  coupling electrodes  18,   the  receiving  electrodes  14  in  A,   B portions  on  the  stator  11   are  separated  from  each  other. The  output  of  the  receiving  electrodes   14   in  A,   B  portions are  individually  drawn  to  be  processed.<br>
The  measuring  circuit  used  for  the  embodiment  in  Figs. lOA,   lOB  is  shown  in  Fig.11.   Different   from  Fig.3,   two outputs   from  A,   B  portions  of  the  rotary  encoder   10  are integrated  by  two  integrators  23a,   23b,   respectively.   Two outputs   from  the  integrators  23a,   23b  are  processed  in  two phase  comparators  24a,   24b,   respectively.   The  counter  25 count  clocks  from  the  oscillator  21   in  accordance  with  the detected  signals  of  the  phase  comparators  24a,   24b  to output  position  data.   In  the  counter  25,   the  outputs  AG, BO,   each  derived  from  A,   B  portions,   are  equalized  to output  the  resultant  signal  according  to  the  following formula:   (AO+BOJ/2.<br>
According  to  this  embodiment,   influence  of  variation<br><br>
in  axial  direction  can  be  more  effectively  reduced.<br>
Figs.12A  and  12B  show  electrode  patterns  according  to another  embodiment  which  was  developed  based  on  the construction  in  Figs.6A  and  6B.   As  shown  in  Figs.l2A  and 12B,   A  and  B  sets  of  electrode  patterns  are  arranged  on the  stator  11  and  the  rotor  12,   respectively.   The  layout of  the  transmitting  electrodes  13  and  the  receiving electrode  14  on  the  stator  11  is  similar  to  that  of Fig.SA.   In  this  embodiment,   the  receiving  electrodes   14   in A,   B  sets  are  commonly  connected  to  an  external  measuring circuit  as  similar  to  the  embodiment  of  Figs.QA  and  9B.<br>
Fig.13  shows  a  construction  of  a  small  measuring apparatus  in  which  the  above-described  embodiments  is applied.   The  stator  11  and  the  circuit  module  32   are formed  of  an  injection  molded  plastics  product  in  one body.   Therefore,   the  stator  11  is  not  an  individual halfway  cylindrical  member,   but  has   a  halfway  cylindrical inner  surface  which  is  opposed  to  the  rotor  12.   On  the module  32,   an  LSI   33,   an  LCD  34,   switches  35,   36   and  othei necessary  parts  are  mounted.   The  stator  11  has  electrode patterns  and  lead  lines  formed  on  the  inner  surface  as similar  to  the  above-described  embodiments,   and  the  lead lines  are  connected  to  the  LSI  33.   The  electrode  patterns can  be  formed  by  affixing  a  FPC  substrate,   or  by  machininc a  metal   film  directly  deposited  on  the  inner  surface  of the  plastic  product.   The  rotor  12  is  mounted  on  a  spindle of  a  to-be-measured  machine  (   not  shown)   by  use  of  a<br><br>
position-aligning bush 31, then the module 32 is jointed to the bush 31. Finally, a cover 37 and a battery 38 are attached.<br>
As  described  above,   the  small  displacement  measuring device  can  be  easily  installed  on  the  to-be-measured machine.<br>
In  the  present  invention,   it  is  not  necessary  that  t incomplete  cylindrical  member  is   a  just  half  cylindrical member.   For  example,   as  shown  in  Fig.14,   an  incomplete cylindrical  stator  11   smaller  than  just  half  of  a  comple cylindrical  member  can  be  used.   As  shown  in  Fig.15,   an incomplete  stator  11   larger  than  just  half  of  a  complete cylindrical  member  can  be  also  used.   In  the  device  of Fig,15,   the  cylindrical  rotor  12  can  not  be  inserted  in the  stator  11  through  the  side  opening,   but  can  be inserted  in  the  stator   11   through  the  edge  opening.   In this  case,   comparing  to  a  case  that  complete  cylindricaJ member  is  used,   it  is  more  easy  to  form  the  electrode patterns  and  to  draw  out  the  lead  lines.<br>
Figs.l6A  and  16B  show  another  embodiment  in  which  a stator  is   formed  on  a  plate.   As  shown  in  Fig.l6A,   a  stal portion  41  is  formed  on  a  plate  40.   The  stator  portion  i has,   as  shown  in  Fig.l6B,   the  same  transmitting  electroc array  13  and  the  receiving  electrode  14  as  Fig.4A  by sputtering  and  etching  processes.   On  the  plate  40,   lead lines  16,   17  continued  from  the  stator  portion  41  are. a. formed  at  the  same  time  in  the  above-described  processe;<br><br>
An  LSI   43  and  an  LCD  44  are  mounted  on  the  plate  40. Electric  wires  connecting  between  the  LSI   43   and  the  LCD 44  are  not  shown,   but  formed  on  the  plate  40.   The  rotor  12 is  disposed  to  be  opposed  to  the  stator  portion  41,   as shown  in  Fig,16A.   On  the  rotor  12,   the  coupling  electrode are   formed  similar  to  Fig.4B.<br>
According  to  the  embodiment,   it  is  not  necessary  to use  a  FPC  substrate  for  the  stator  portion  41.   It  is  able to  form  the  stator  portion  40  by  use  of  conventional techniques,   sputtering,   vapor  deposition,   etching,   and  the like.   As  a  result,   the  manufacturing  cost  can  be  reduced. The  device  assembling  is  easy.<br>
Figs.l7A  to  17c  show  another  embodiment  applied  to  a linear  encoder.   Fig.l7A  is  a  plan  view  of  the  linear encoder  50.   The  linear  encoder  50  has  a  halfway cylindrical  scale  51   and  a  cylindrical  scale   52   as  similar to  the  above-described  rotary  encoder.   Figs.l7B  and  17C are  electrode  patterns  on  the  scale  52  and  the  scale  51 rolled  out,   respectively.   The  scale  52   is   longer  than  the scale  51.   The  scale  52  is  prevented  from  relative  moving in  angular  direction  to  the  scale  51,   and  movable  only  in axial  direction,   as  shown  by  an  arrow.<br>
As  formed  on  the  inner  surface  of  the  halfway cylindrical  scale  51,   as  shown  in  Fig.l7C,   are  eight transmitting  electrodes  13  and  a  receiving  electrode  14. The  transmitting  electrodes  13  have  spiral  patterns. Although  only  one  unit  of  transmitting  electrodes  13<br><br>
corresponding  to  a  transmitting  wavelength  pitch  Wtl   is shown  in  Fig.l7C,   plural  units  of  the  transmitting electrodes  can  be  arranged.   The  receiving  electrode  14  is formed  near  to  the  transmitting  electrodes   13  with  a rectangular  pattern  longitudinal  in  axial  direction.<br>
On  the  outer  surface  of  the  scale  52,   as  shown  in Fig.l7B,   a  plurality  of  receiving  portions   18a  of  the coupling  electrode  18  are  formed  with    spiral  patterns having  the  same  lead  angle  as  the  transmitting  electrodes 13  at  pitch  Pr2   (=  Wtl)   in  axial  direction.   Each  receiving portion  18a  is  capacitively  coupled  to  four  transmitting electrodes  13.   The  transmitting  portion  18b  of  the coupling  electrode  18  which  is  capacitively  coupled  to  the receiving  electrode  14   is   formed  with  an  elongated  pattern in  axial  direction.   The  coupling  electrode  18  can  be formed  of  a  continuing  spiral  pattern  surrounding  the scale   52.<br>
The  linear  encoder  has  a  different  construction  from the  conventional  encoder,   but  the  principle  of  the construction  is  the  same  as  that  of  Fig.29.   Therefore,   it is  able  to  measure  the  linear  displacement  of  the  scale  52 relatively  moving  to  the  scale  51  in  axial  direction.<br>
Figs.lSA  and  18B  show  another  embodiment  which  have two  sets  of  electrode  patterns  shown  in  Figs.lVB  and   17C in  angular  direction.     According  to  this  embodiment, influence  of  axial  misalignment  between  the  scales  51  and 52  can  be  reduced.<br><br>
Several  embodiments  combining  cylindrical  members  and halfway  cylindrical  members  have  been  described  so  far. Next,   rotary  encoders  which  have  two  complete  cylindrical members  will  be  described.<br>
Fig,19A  shows  a  rotary  encoder  60  according  to  one embodiment.   The  encoder  60  is  composed  of  a  rotor  62  and  a stator  61   surrounding  the  rotor  62.   The  rotor  62   is assembled  to  be  coaxial  with  the  stator  61  with  a predetermined  gap  so  as  to  movable  only  in  angular direction  relative  to  the  stator  61.     Figs.l9B  and  19C show  the  rolled  out  outer  surface  of  the  rotor  62  and  the rolled  out  inner  surface  of  the  stator  61,   respectively.<br>
As  shown  in  Fig.l9C,   the  transmitting  electrode  array 13  and  the  receiving  electrode  14  are  formed  on  the cylindrical   inner  surface  of  the  stator  61   as   similar  to Fig.4A.   The  transmitting  electrode  array  13  has  one  set  of eight  electrodes   formed  of  spiral  patterns  with  a predetermined  lead  angle  at  a  predetermined  pitch  from  one end  of  the  stator  61.   The  receiving  electrodes  14  is formed  of  a  rectangular  pattern  longitudinal  in  angular direction,   at  the  other  end  of  the  stator  61.   Both  of  the transmitting  electrodes  13  and  the  receiving  electrode  14 take  a  round  on  the  inner  surface  of  the  stator  61.<br>
As  shown  in  Fig.l9B,   a  coupling  electrode  18 capacitively  coupled  to  thei  transmitting  electrodes  13  and the  receiving  electrode  14  are  formed  on  the  outer  surface<br>
of  the  rotor  62.   The  couplibg  electrode  18  has  a  receiving<br>
I<br><br>
portion  18a  capacitively  coupled  to  the  transmitting electrodes   13  and  a  transmitting  portion  18b  capacitively coupled  to  the  receiving  electrode  14.   The  receiving portion  18a  has  a  spiral  pattern  with  the  same  lead  angle as  the  transmitting  electrodes  13  and  covers  four transmitting  electrodes  13.   The  transmitting  portion  18b of  a  rectangular  pattern  takes  a  round  on  the  outer surface.<br>
Although a grounded electrode 19 is formed on the space between the coupling electrode 18, the grounded electrode  19  can  be  omitted.<br>
The  transmitting  electrodes  13  and  the  receiving electrode  14   are  drawn  out  by  a  predetermined   lead  lines   ( not  shown)   to  be  connected  to  a  driving/measuring  circuit. Alternating  signals  which  are  phase  shifted  by  45°   each other  are  supplied  in  numerical  sequence  to  the transmitting  electrodes  13  as  similar  to  Fig.4A.<br>
In  this  embodiment,   one  revolution  of  the  outer<br>
surface  of  the  rotor  12  is  equal  to  the  transmitting wavelength  pitch  Wtl  and  the  receiving  electrode  pitch  Pr2 shown  in  Fig.29.   As  a  result,   according  to  this embodiment,   it  is  able  to  measure  the  angular  displacement with  a  high  precise  of or  more.<br>
According  to  the  embodiment,   there  is  no  influence from  axial  misalignment  between  the  stator  61   and  the -  rotor  62.   Because,   one  unit  of  the  spiral  electrodes  are formed  round  the  surface,   the  averaged  intensity  of  the<br><br>
output  signal   is  equalized  in  angular  direction.<br>
Figs.20A  and  20B  show  another  electrode  patterns  of the  stator  62.   In  Fig.20A,   the  transmitting  portion  18b  of the  coupling  electrode  18  is  formed  of  a  spiral  pattern elongated  from  the  spiral  receiving  portion  18a  similar  to that  of  Fig.SB.   In  Fig.20B,   the  transmitting  portion  18b is  formed  as  the  same  pattern  as  Fig.   19B,   and  continued to  the  receiving  portion  18a  without  an  especial  space between  the  transmitting  portion  18b  and  the  receiving portion  18a.<br>
According  to  the  electrode  patterns  in  Fig.20A, comparing  to  Fig.l9B,   misalignment  in  axial  direction  of the  stator  61  relative  to  the  rotor  62  such  as  might  be caused  of  sensor  clearances  is  allowable.   Because,   in contrast  to  that  the  receiving  portion  18a  is  formed within  the  width  l(<lo in fig. the coupling electrode works as receiving portions a whole width iq axial direction. further since patterns are simple manufacturing process of becomes easy. however area transmitting portion actually opposed to is approximately half that fig.lqb.></lo>
According  to  the  electrode  patterns  in  Fig.20B,   not only  misalignment  in  axial  direction  of  the  stator  61 relative  to Jtlie  rotor  62  is  allowable,   but  also  the  area     — of  the  transmitting  portion  18b  opposed  to  the  receiving<br><br>
electrode  14  is  secured  to  be  sufficiently  large.<br>
Figs.ZlA  and  21B  are  another  electrode  patterns corresponding  to  Figs.l9A  and  19B,   respectively.   In  this embodiment,   the  length  I2  of  the  rotor  62  is  smaller  than the  length  1^  of  the  stator  61.   The  electrode  patterns  on the  rotor  62  are  the  same  as  that  of  Fig.20A,   and  the electrode  patterns  on  the  stator  61  are  the  same  as  that of  Fig.l9C.<br>
As  a  result  of  applying  the  above  relations,   the drawing  of  lead  lines  from  the  stator  61   becomes  easy. Further,   misalignment  between  the  stator  61  and  rotor  62 in  axial  direction  is  allowable.<br>
Figs.22A  and  22B  show  another  electrode  patterns  of  a developed  embodiment  corresponding  to  Figs.lQA  and  19B. In  this  embodiment,   the  coupling  electrode  18  is  divided into  5   (generally,   an  integer  greater  than  2)   electrodes uniformly  spaced  with  a  pitch  obtained  by  dividing  the transmitting  wavelength  Wtl  by  5.   Then  these  electrodes are  disposed  at  a  pitch  of  2;rr/10    with  spiral  patterns. Although  eight  transmitting  electrodes  13  have  the  same patterns  as  that  in  Fig.l9C,   the  phases  of  alternating signals  are  different  from  that  in  Fig.l9C. Alternatively,   eight  phases  alternating  signals  whose phases  are  sequentially  shifted  by  135°   are  supplied  to the  transmitting  electrodes   13,   as  shown  in  Fig.22B.<br>
According  to  this  embodiment,   when  the  rotor  62 rotates  1/5.revolution  (i.e.,   72°),   the  phase  change  of<br><br>
the  output  signal  is  just  360°.   In  other  words,   when  the rotor  62  rotates  one  revolution,   the  output  signal  changes for  5  periods.   The  principle  of  the  measuring  method  and the  detailed  measuring  circuit  in  the  above-mentioned embodiment  in  Figs.6A  and  6B.<br>
In  Fig.22A,   the  coupling  electrodes  18  are  formed  of only  spiral  patterns  including  the  receiving  portions  and the  transmitting  portions.   In  contrast,   it  is  able  to  use the  electrode  patterns  shown  in  Fig.23  such  as    the receiving  portions  18a  are  formed  of  spiral  patterns,   and the  transmitting  portion  18b  is   formed  of  a  rectangular pattern  longitudinal  in  angular  direction.   As  a  result, the  coupling  electrodes   18  can  be  opposed  to  the  receiving electrode  14  on  the  stator  61  with  a  large  area.<br>
Figs.24A  and  24B  show  electrode  patterns  of  a  rotary encoder  according  to  another  embodiment  which  has  A,   B sets  of  electrode  patterns  shown  in  Figs.21A  and  21B  in axial  direction.   As  formed  on  the  stator  61,   are  two  sets of  the  transmitting  electrode  array  13  and  the  receiving electrode  14  having  reverse  patterns  each  other.   There  is a  space  of  2a  between  A  and  B  sets  such  that  misalignment in  axial  direction  is  allowable  with  respect  to  the reference  point  ZP.   Each  corresponding  transmitting electrodes  13  in  A  and  B  sets  is  commonly  driven  by  the same  phase  signal.   The  receiving  electrodes  14  in  A,   B set-s  are  commonly-connected  to  the  measuring  circuit.<br>
Corresponding  to  the  electrode  pattern  in  the  stator<br><br>
61,   A  and  B  sets  of  coupling  electrodes   18   are  disposed  on the  outer  surface  of  the  rotor  62  in  axial  direction  with reverse  spiral  patterns  each  other.<br>
According  to  the  embodiment,   the  phases  of  A  and  B portions  change  in  the  same  direction  in  accordance  with the  rotating  of  the  rotor  62.   In  contrast,   the  phases  of  A and  B  portions  change  in  reverse  directions  each  other  in accordance  with  linear  moving  of  the  rotor  62   in  axial direction.   However,   if  the  linear  movement  is  limited within  2a,   the  above  phase  changes  of  A  and  B  portions  are canceled  in  the  output  signal.  As  a  result,   influence  of variation  in  axial  direction  can  be  reduced.<br>
In  the  above  embodiment,   the  space  2a  between  A,   B portions  can  be  laid  not  on  the  stator  61,   but  between  the two  sets  of  the  coupling  electrodes  18  on  the  rotor  62.<br>
Figs.25A  and  25B  show  electrode  patterns  according  to<br>
-. ..	another  embodiment,   each  corresponding  to  Figs.24A  and<br>
24B,   in  which  variation  of  signal  intensity  between  A  and B  portions  is  more  allowable.   In  this  embodiment, different  to  Figs.24A,   24B,   the  coupling  electrodes   18  are separated  from  each  other  between  A  and  B  portions,   as shown  in  Fig.25A  as  separation  area  C.   In  accordance  with the  separation  of  the  coupling  electrodes  18,   the receiving  electrodes  14  in  A,   B  portions  on  the  stator  61 are  separated  from  each  other.   The  output  of  the  receiving electrodes 14 'in  A,   B  portions  are  individually  drawn  to be  processed.<br><br>
The  measuring  circuit  used  in  this  embodiment  is  the same  as  Fig.11.   As  a  result  of  averaging  process  in  the measuring  circuit,   influence  of  variation  in  axial direction  can  be  more  effectively  reduced.<br>
Figs.26A  to  26C  show  a  linear  encoder  with  two cylindrical  members  according  to  another  embodiment. Fig.26A  is  a  perspective  view  of  the  linear  encoder.   This .encoder  has  a  first  cylindrical  scale  71  and  a  second cylindrical  scale  72  which  are  coaxial.   The  second  scale 72  is  longer  than  the  first  scale  71  and  secured  by  a predetermined  mechanism    (not  shown)  so  as  to  be relatively  displaceable  to  the  first  scale  71  only  in axial  direction  as  shown  by  an  arrow  .<br>
Figs.26B  and  26C  are  electrode  patterns  on  the  second scale  72  and  the  first  scale  71  rolled  out,   respectively.<br>
The  first  scale  71  has,   as  shown  in  Fig.26C,   eight transmitting  electrodes  13  and  a  receiving  electrode  14 formed  on  the  cylindrical  inner  surface.   The  transmitting electrodes  13  are  disposed  with  spiral  patterns  outside  a gap  region  of  g.   Although  only  one  unit  of  eight transmitting  electrodes  13  corresponding  to  a  transmitting wavelength  pitch  Wtl  is  shown  in  Fig.26C,   plural  units  of the  transmitting  electrodes  can  be  arranged.   The  receiving electrode  14  is  formed  with  a  rectangular  pattern longitudinal  in  axial  direction  in  the  gap  region  of  g.<br>
On  the  cylindricalr-outer  surface  of  the  second  scale<br><br>
electrodes  18  are  formed  with    spiral  patterns  having  the same  lead  angle  as  the  transmitting  electrodes  13  at  pitch Pr2   (=  Wtl)   in  axial  direction.   Each  coupling  electrode  18 has  a  receiving  portion  18a  capacitively  coupled  to  four transmitting  electrodes   13  and  a  transmitting  portion  18b capacitively  coupled  to  the  receiving  electrode  14.<br>
The  linear  encoder  has  a  different  construction  from the  conventional  encoder,   but  the  principle  of  the construction  is  the  same  as  that  of  Fig.29-   Therefore,   it is  able  to  measure  the  linear  displacement  of  the  scale  72 relatively  moving  to  the  scale  71  in  axial  direction.<br>
In  the  above-described  embodiments,   electrode  patterns on  the  inner  and  outer  surfaces  of  the  cylindrical  or halfway  cylindrical  members  are  formed  of  FPC  J^ubstrates. In  the  case,   optional  insulator  or  metal  material  is  used for  the  cylindrical  or  the  halfway  cylindrical  member.<br>
Figs.27A  and  27B  show  another  method  for  forming spiral  electrode  patterns  on  a  outer  surface  of  a cylindrical  member  80.   As  shown  in  the  expanded  section  in Fig.27B,   the  cylindrical  member  80  is  formed  of  an injection  molded  plastic  body  81,   on  whose  outer  surface  a conductive  film  82,   for  example,   Au,Ni  and  the  like,   is plated.   The  conductive  film  82  is,   for  example,   of  10/μm thick.   The  machining  apparatus  has,   as  shown  in  Fig.27A,   a nut  member  85,   a  feed  screw  83  which  is  able  to  be  fed  at a  predetermined  pitch,   and  a  cutter  84.   The  cylindrical member  80  is  firm  mounted  on  a  end  portion  of  the  feed<br><br>
screw  83,   then  the  cutter  84  is  applied  to  the  outer surface  of  the  cylindrical  member  80.   Then  the  cylindrical member  80  is  fed  with  the  feed  screw  83.   Thus,   a  spiral groove  86,   for  example,   of 0.3μm    depth,   is  formed  on  the outer  surface  of  the  cylindrical  member  80.   As  a  result,   a spiral  electrode  pattern  of  the  conductive  film  82  are formed  on  the  outer  surface.<br>
By  use  of  the  above  method,   the  spiral  electrode patterns  on  the  rotors,   as  shown  in  Fig.SB,   Fig.6B  and  the like,   can  be  easily  formed.   Two  sets  of  the  spiral electrode  patterns  as  shown  in  Fig.9B  or  Fig.l2B  can  be formed  by  controlling  rotating  direction  during  machining. Even  if  the  electrodes  having  other  patterns  in  addition to  the  spiral  patterns,   for  example,   as  shown  in  Fig.4B, can  be  also  formed  by  combination  of  rotation  control  and feed  control.<br>
Fig.28  shows  a  method  for  forming  spiral  electrode patterns  in  an  inner  surface  of  a  cylindrical  member  90. The  cylindrical  member  90  is   formed  of  an  injection  molded plastic  body  91  on  whose  inner  surface  a  conductive  film 92  is  plated.   A  cutting  tool   93  having  eight  cutters  94  on the  edge  is  prepared.   Then  the  cylindrical  member  90  is fed  by  the  same  method  as  shown  in  Fig.27A  such  as  the cutting  tool  93  is  injected  into  the  cylindrical  member 90.   Thus  the  conductive  film  92  is  cut  by  eight  cutters  94 to  be  formed  as  spiral  patterns.   By^his  method,   the spiral  transmitting  electrodes  13  of  the  cylindrical<br><br>
stator  61  shown  in  Fig.l9C,   can  be  formed.   For  the  halfway cylindrical  stator,   for  example  shown  in  Fig.   4A,   the spiral  transmitting  electrodes  13  can  be  also  formed  in  a similar  way.<br>
In  the  above  embodiments,   the  inner  axles  are cylindrical  members  each  having  a  cylindrical  cavity. However,   other  cylindrical  members  which  have  no  cavity can  be  used  as  an  inner  axle.   As  the  outer  collar  members, not  only  rolled  thin  plates,   but  also  other  various materials  including  cylindrical  and  rectangular  blocks  in which  cylindrical  cavities  are  formed  can  be  used. Alternatively,   as  the  outer  collar  members,   optional materials  having  cylindrical  or  incomplete  cylindrical inner  surfaces  being  able  to  be  opposed  to  the  inner member  can  be  used.<br><br><br>

A capacitance-ty'pe displacement measuring device for measuring relative position between first and second elements, substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to figures 1 to 28 of the accompanying drawings.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The  present  invention  relates  to  a  capacitance-type lisplacement  measuring  device  used  for  a  small  measurir ievice  such  as  an  electric  micrometer,   hole  test,   dial jauge,   angle-measuring  equipment  and  the  like.<br><br>
Numerous  capacitance-type  measuring  device  for  mak Linear  or  angular  measurements  have  been  developed  when two  scales,   on  which  are  respectively  arranged, ^apacitively  coupled  electrodes,   are  displaced  relativ
Fig.29   shows  a  scheme  of  a  prior  capacitance-type displacement  measuring  device.   The  device  comprises  a first  and  second  scales  displaced  to  relatively  movabl On  the  first  scale,   a  plurality  of  first  transmitting electrodes  1  are  arranged  with  a  constant  space,   and receiving  electrode  4  is  disposed  along  the  longitudir direction  of  the  scale.   In  this  case,   each  unit  of  the<br><br>
first  transmitting  electrodes  1  consists  of  8  electrodes. 8-phases  sine  wave  signals,   which  are  pulsed  based  on  the clock  pulse  from  an  oscillator  5,   and  whose  phases  are mutually  shifted  by  45°,   are  generated  from  a  pulse modulating  circuit  5  to  be  supplied  to  the  first transmitting  electrodes  1.   Therefore,   the  width  of  each unit  of  the  transmitting  electrodes  1  is  equal  to  a transmitting  wavelength  pitch  Wtl.<br>
As  disposed  on  the  second  scale  are  arranged  second receiving  electrodes  2  with  a  pitch  Pr2  equal  to  the transmitting  wavelength  pitch  Wtl,   which  are  capacitively coupled  to  4  transmitting  electrodes  1  on  the  first scale   .   Also  disposed  on  the  second  scale  are  second transmitting  electrodes  3  which  are  electrically  connected with  the  second  receiving  electrodes  2  and  capacitively coupled  to  the  first  receiving  electrode  4  on  the  first scale.   The  first  receiving  electrode  4  is  connected  to  a measuring  circuit  7.<br>
In  the  device  as  described  above,   when  the  first  and second  scales  are  relatively  moved,   phase  of  received signal  vary  based  on  the  capacitive  coupling  between  the first  transmitting  electrodes  1  and  the  second  receiving electrodes  2.   It  is  able  to  measure  displacement  by sensing  the  phase  variation  of  the  received  signal.   In this  case,   since  the  device  has  8  transmitting  electrodes, and  these  electrodes—are  driven  by  multi-phase  signals,   as Dhase  shifted  with  respect  to  each  other  by  45°,   it  is<br><br>
able  to  determine  a  measurement    position  within  a precision  of  Pr2/8.<br>
If  the  first  and  second  scales  in  the  above-described capacitance-type  measuring  device  are  formed  of  coaxial cylindrical  members,   it  is  able  to  obtain  a  small cylindrical  displacement  sensor.<br>
Fig.SOA  and  Fig.308  show  an  example  of  expanded electrode  patterns  of  outer  cylindrical  member  (i.e., stator)   and  inner  cylindrical  member  (i.e.,   rotor)   in  such a  cylindrical  displacement  sensor.   As  shown  in  these figures,   two  units  A,   B  of  first  transmitting  electrodes 1,   each  of  the  units  having  8  electrodes,   and  s  first receiving  electrode  4     are  formed  on  the  inner  surface  of the  stator.   Two  units  of  second  receiving  electrodes  2 opposed  to  first  transmitting  electrodes  1  and  second transmitting  electrodes  3  opposed  to  the  first  receiving electrode  4  are  formed  on  the  outer  surface  of  the  rotor.<br>
For  manufacturing  such  a  cylindrical  displacement sensor,   it  is  necessary  to  form  electrode  patterns  on  a cylindrical  surface.   Several  methods  for  forming  such electrode  patterns,   especially  electrode  patterns  on  the stator,   for  example,   have  been  provided  as  follows:   (1) electrode  patterns  are  formed  on  a  flexible  print  circuit (FPC)   substrate,   then  the  FPC  is  affixed  to  the  inner surface  of  a  cylindrical  member  (refer  to  USP  5,239,307); (2)  electrode  patterns  are  formed  on  the  surface  of  a cylindrical  member  by  laser  beam  machining   (refer  to<br><br>

Further,   for  making  a  highly  precise  measurement,   it is  necessary  to  dispose  the  stator  and  the  rotor  with  a high  concentricity.   However,   it  is  difficult  to  obtain  a high  concentricity  in  a  small  cylindrical   sensor.   For realizing  highly  precise  measurement  in  spite  of  that  the concentricity  is  bad,   it  is  necessary  to  arrange  at  least two  units  of  electrodes,   as  shown  in  Fig.30A  and  SOB. When  two  units  of  electrodes  are  arranged  in  angular direction,   the  influence  of  misalignment  between  the stator  and  the  rotor  can  be  canceled  by  averaging  the  two outputs  of  the  electrode  units.<br>
However,   several  problems  are  remained  in  such  a cylindrical  displacement  sensor  in  the  conventional  arts. First,   it  is  difficult  to  form  electrode  patterns  on  a cylindrical  member  by  use  the  above-mentioned  methods. Especially,   smaller  the  cylindrical  member  is,   more difficult  the  process  for  forming  the  precise  patterns becomes.   Second,   It  is  difficult  to  connect  the  electrode patterns  on  the  inner  surface  of  the  cylindrical  member  t( an  external  measuring  circuit,   and  to  assemble  a  stator and  a  rotor.   If  it  is  necessary  to  form  2  units  of electrodes  for  solving  the  problem  of  concentricity,   the wirings  between  the  sensor  and  the  external  measuring circuit  become  more  complicated,   and  operation  process becomes  more  complicated,   too.   Since  there  are  problems  t be  solved  as  above  described,   the  cylindrical  displacemen<br><br>
sensor  is  not  yet  practically  used.<br><br>
An  object  of  the  present  invention  is  to  provide  a capacitance-type  measuring  device  which  can  be  readily wired  and  constructed,   and  whose  electrode  patterns  can  be easily  formed.<br>
Another  object  of  the  present  invention  is  to  provide a  capacitance-type  measuring  device  which  is  not  necessary for  highly  concentricity,   thereby  electrode  patterns  can be  simplified.<br>
A  first  aspect  of  the  present  invention  is  a capacitance-type  measuring  device  for  measuring  relative position  between  first  and  second  elements  which  are arranged  to  be  relatively  movable  with  a  predetermined gap,   comprising:   an  array  of  transmitting  electrodes -      disposed  on  the  first  element,   alternating  signals  having different  phases  from  each  other  being  supplied  to  each transmitting  electrode;   a  receiving  electrode  disposed  on the  first  element  such  as  to  be  isolated  from  the  array  of transmitting  electrodes;   and  a  coupling  electrode  disposed on  the  second  element  to  be  capacitively  coupled  to  plural electrodes  in  the  array  of  transmitting  electrodes  and  th€ receiving  electrode,   the  receiving  electrode  being  adaptec to  output  an  electric  signal  corresponding  to  a  relative position  between  the  first  and  second  elements,   the electric  signal  being  supplied  to  a  measuring  circuit.<br><br>
wherein  one  of  the  first  and  second  elements  is  an  inner member  having  a  cylindrical  outer  surface,   the  other  is  an outer  member  having  an  incomplete  cylindrical  inner surface  which  is  opposed  to  the  outer  surface  with  a predetermined  gap,   the  first  and  second  elements  being held  to  be  relatively  movable  in  either  axial  direction  or angular  direction,   and  the  array  of  transmitting electrodes  and  the  receiving  electrode  are  disposed  on  one of  the  outer  surface  of  the  inner  member  and  the  inner surface  of  the  outer  member,   and  the  coupling  electrode  is disposed  on  the  other  surface.<br>
A  second  aspect  of  the  present  invention  is  a capacitance-type  measuring  device  for  measuring  relative position  between  first  and  second  elements  which  are arranged  to  be  relatively  movable  with  a  predetermined gap,   comprising:   an  array  of  transmitting  electrodes disposed  on  the  first  element,   alternating  signals  having different  phases  from  each  other  being  supplied  to  each transmitting  electrode;   a  receiving  electrode  disposed  on the  first  element  such  as  to  be  isolated  from  the  array  of transmitting  electrodes;   and  a  coupling  electrode  disposed on  the  second  element  to  be:  capacitively  coupled  to  plural electrodes  in  the  array  of  itransmitting  electrodes  and  the receiving  electrode,   the  rejceiving  electrode  being  adapted to  output  an  electric  signal  corresponding  to  a  relative position  between  the  first 'and  second  elements,   the electric  signal  being  supplied  to  a  measuring  circuit.<br><br>
wherein  one  of  the  first  and  second  member  having  a  cylindrical  outer  surface,   the  other  is  an outer  member  having  an  cylindrical  inner  surface  which  is opposed  to  the  outer  surface  with  a  predetermined  gap,   the first  and  second  elements  being  held  to  be  relatively movable  in  either  axial  direction  or  angular  direction, and  one  of  the  array  of  transmitting  electrodes  and  the coupling  electrode  is  disposed  on  the  outer  surface  of  the inner  member,   the  other  is  disposed  on  the  inner  surface of  the  outer  member,   both  of  the  array  of  transmitting electrodes  and  the  coupling  electrode  having  spiral patterns  with  the  same  lead  angle.<br>
In  the  first  aspect,   the  device  comprises  the  inner element  having  the  cylindrical  outer  surface  and  the  outer element  having  the  incomplete  cylindrical  inner  surface half  surrounding  the  inner  element.   Since  the  outer element  is,   for  example,   an  incomplete  cylinder  whose  side portion  is  open,   it  is  easy  to  form  electrode  patterns  in the  inne:^  surface,   to  lead  out  the  wire,   and  to  construct the  elements.   For  example.   If  the  electrode  patterns  and the  lead  wire  thereof  are  formed  on  an  FPC  substrate,   and then  affixed  to  the  inner  surface  of  the  outer  element, the  process  for  forming  the  electrode  patterns  including the  lead  wire  becomes  to  be  easy.<br>
In  the  second  aspect,   by  use  of  combination  of  a complete  cylinder-and  an  incomplete  cylinder,   or combination  of  two  complete  cylinders  for  a  stator  and  a<br><br>
rotor,   and  by  arranging  the  transmitting  electrodes  and the  coupling  electrodes  with  spiral  patterns,   it  is  able to  obtain  a  displacement  sensor  for  measuring  angular displacement.   In  the  displacement  sensor,   even  if  the  axes are  misaligned  between  the  rotor  and  the  stater,   the  gap between  the  transmitting  electrodes  and  the  coupling electrodes  opposed  each  other  is  averaged  in  angular direction  to  be  approximately  constant.   Therefore,   even  if the  concentricity  is  not  high,   it  is  able  to  obtain  a  high measurement  precise.   Further,   if,   on  each  of  the  stator and  rotor,   two  sets  of  electrode  patterns  having  a  reverse patterns  each  other  are  arranged,   the  influence  of misalignment  in  axial  direction  between  the  stator  and  the rotor  can  be  canceled,   and  it  is  able  to  measure  angular displacement  with  high  precise.<br><br>

DETAILED  DEgeRIPTION -eP-IWE  PREFERRED  EMBi^iMENTS<br><br>
In  the  bellow-described  rotary  encoders  according  tu the  embodiments,  cylindrical  inner  members  serve  as rotors,   and  cylindrical  or  incomplete  cylindrical  outer members  surrounding  the  inner  members  serve  as  stators. Electrode  patterns  are  formed  on  the  outer  surfaces  of  the rotors  and  the  inner  surfaces  of  the  stators.     However, corresponding  to  applications,   it  is  able  to  exchange  the function  of  the  inner  and  outer  members    such  that  the inner  members  serve  as  stators,   and  the  outer  members serve  as  rotors.     In  every  modes,   it  is  preferable  that transmitting  and  receiving  electrodes,   which  are  connected to  driving  and  measuring  circuits,   are  formed  on  the stators.<br>
Fig.   1  shows  an  electric  micrometer  according  to  a first  embodiment  of  the  present  invention.   In  the micrometer,   a  spindle  101  is  held  in  a  case  103,   and  is able  to  slide  by  a  knob  102.   In  the  case  103,   a  rotary encoder  10  is  installed  for  measuring  the  displacement  of the  spindle  101,   and  the  measured  value  is  displayed  on  a display  104.   Several  switches  105  are  mounted  near  to  the display  104.<br>
Fig.IB  is  an  expanded  section  about  a  region  106  in Fig.lA  for  showing  the  installed  state  of  the  rotary encoder  10.   The  rotary  encoder  10  comprises  a  rotor  12 mounted  on  the  spindle  101  and  a  stator  11  installed  on the  inney  surface  of  the  case  103  so  as  to  oppose  the—-outer  surface  of  the  rotor  12.  The  rotor  12  consists  of  a<br><br>
cylindrical   axle  coaxial  with  the  spindle   101,   and  the stator  11  consists  of  a  halfway  cylindrical  collar  which has  an  incomplete  inner  surface  opposed  to  the  outer surface  of  the  rotor  12  with  a  predetermined  gap.   A  screw 108   attached  on  the  end  portion  of  the  rotor   12   is  trappec in  a  longitudinal  groove  107  formed  on  the  outer  surface of  the  rotor  12  so  as  to  be  movable  along  the  groove  107. The  rotor  12  is  forced  to  the  inner  surface  of  the  case 103  by  a  spring  109  to  be  prevented  from  displacement  in axial  direction  against  to  the  case  103.   When  the  spindle 101   rotates  and  linearly  displace  in  axial  direction,   the rotor   12  rotates  together  with  the  spindle  101,   but  does not  displace  in  axial  direction.   Therefore,   the  rotor  12 is  movable  in  only  angular  direction  against  to  the  stator 11   in  accordance  with  the  rotating  and  linear  displacement of  the  spindle  101,   thereby  the  rotated  displacement  can be  measured.<br>
Fig.2A  and  Fig.2B  show  the  installed  state  and  the side  view  of  the  rotary  encoder  10,   respectively.   Fig.2C and  Fig.2D  show  the  inner  surface  of  the  stator  11  and  the outer  surface  of  the  rotor  12,   which  are  rolled  out, respectively.   The  rotor  12  is  arranged  to  be  coaxial  with the  stator  11  with  a  predetermined  gap  of  0.1   to  0.2  mm  so as  to  be  relatively  movable.<br>
As  shown  in  Fig.2C,   as  disposed  on  the  inner  surface of  the  stator  11,   are  an  array  of  transmitting  electrodes 13  and  a  receiving  electrode  14,   which  are  insulated  from<br><br>
each  other.   The  array  of  transmitting  electrodes   13   is arranged  with  rectangular  patterns  longitudinal  in  axial direction  at  a  predetermined  pitch  in  angular  direction. The  array  of  transmitting  electrodes   13,   in  this embodiment,   is  composed  of  1  unit  of  N  electrodes   (N  is  an integer  of  2  or  more).   N  alternating  signals  which  are phase  shifted  by  360°/N    each  other  are  supplied  in numerical  sequence  to  the  N  transmitting  electrodes  13. In  this  embodiment,   N=8.   The  receiving  electrode  14  is disposed  near  to  the  transmitting  electrode  array  13   in axial  direction  on  the  inner  surface  of  the  stator  11  with a  rectangular  pattern  longitudinal   in  angular  direction.<br>
The transmitting electrode array 13 and the receiving electrode 14 are actually formed together with lead lines 15, 16 on an FPC substrate 17, as shown by a dotted line, and the FPC substrate 17 are affixed to the inner surface of the stator 11. The lead wires 15 and 16 are drawn out from each edge of the stator 11 and connected to external driving/measuring  circuit.<br>
On  the  outer  surface  of  the  rotor  12,   as   shown  in Fig.2D,   two  coupling  electrodes   18   and  two  ground electrodes  19  are  disposed.   The  coupling  electrodes  18  are formed  with  rectangular  patterns  whose  length  in  axial direction  of  the  patterns  covers  the  transmitting electrode  array  13  and  the  receiving  electrode  14,   and whose  width  in  angular  direction  covers   four  transmitting electrodes  13.   The  coupling  electrodes  18  serve  to  receive<br><br>
the  transmitted  signal   from  the  transmitting  electrode array  13  with  capacitive  coupling,   and  serve  to  transmit the  received  signal  to  the  receiving  electrode  14  with capacitive  coupling.   These  electrodes  18  and  19   are actually  formed  on  an  FPC  substrate,   and  affixed  to  the outer  surface  of  the  rotor  12.   The  grounded  electrodes  19 can  be  omitted.<br>
The  arrangement  of  electrodes  in  the  rotary  encoder according  to  the  embodiment  is  equivalent  to  that  of  the conventional  encoder  shown  in  Figs.31A,   31B.   Therefore, the  half-cycle   nx    (where  r  is  radius  of  the  outer  surface of  the  rotor  12)   is  equal  to  the  transmitting  wavelength pitch  Wtl   and  the  receiving  electrode  pitch  Pr2  shown  in Figs.   31A,   31B.   As  a  result,   according  to   this  embodiment, it   is  able  to  measure  the  angular  displacement  with  a  high precise  of   or  more.<br>
Fig.3   shows  a  brief  construction  of  the driving/measuring  circuit  of  the  rotary  encoder  10.   This circuit  includes  an  oscillator  21  which  generates  a  clock signal,   and  a  pulse  modulator  22  which  output  eight  phases alternating  signals  synchronized  with  the  clock  signal   anc phase-shifted  with  45°   each  other  to  the  transmitting electrode  array  13.<br>
The  output  of  the  receiving  electrode  14,   which changes  corresponding  to  the  relative  rotation  between  th rotor  12  and  the  stator  11,   is  given  to  an  integrator  23,<br><br><br>
comparator  24.   The  comparator  24  compares  the  phase difference  between  the  input  signal  and  a  reference signal,   and  detects  a  relative  displacement  between  the rotor  12  and  the  stator  11  corresponding  to  an  amount  of the  phase-shift.   The  output  signal  of  the  comparator  24   is input   to  a  counter  25.   The  counter  25  counts  the  clock signals   from  the  oscillator  21   in  accordance  to  the detected  signal  of  the  comparator  24,   and   the  amount  of the  relative  displacement  between  the  rotor  12  and  the stator  11  are  displayed  on  the  display  26  with  numerical values.<br>
According  to  the  embodiment,   because  of  that  the stator  11  is  composed  of  a  halfway  cylindrical  member,   it is  easy  to  form  the  electrode  patterns  and  the  lead  wires on  the  inner  surface  of  the  stator   11   by  use  of  a  FPC substrate.   Even  if  the  FPC  substrate  is  not  used,   the electrode  patterns  can  be  easily  formed  on  the  inner surface  of  the  stator  by  use  of,   for  example,   laser  beam machining  technology.   Alternatively,   because  the  stator  1 has  an  opening  longitudinal   in  axial  direction,   a  laser beam  can  be  easily  irradiated  to  the  inner  surface  of  the stator  11   through  the  opening.   It  is  also  easy  to conned lead  wires  to  the  electrode  patterns  on  the  inner  surface of  the  stator  11  by  soldering,   thermocompression  bonding, and  the  like.<br>
Figs.4A  and  4B,   each  corresponding  to  Figs.   2C  and  21 respectively,   show  the  rolled  out  electrode  patterns<br><br>
according  to  another  example  of  the  rotary  encoder   10.   As shown  in  Fig,4A,   the  transmitting  electrode  array   13  on the  inner  surface  of  the  stator   11   are  composed  of  N electrodes  disposed  in  parallel  each  other  with  spiral patterns   (where  N=8  in  this  embodiment).   The  receiving electrode   14  is  disposed  near  to  the  transmitting electrode  array  13   in  axial  direction  with  a  rectangular pattern  longitudinal   in  angular  direction.   The  coupling electrodes   18  on  the  outer  surface  of  the  rotor  12,   as shown  in  Fig.4B,   have  receiving  portions   18a  opposed  to transmitting  electrode  array  13   and  a  transmitting  portion 18b  opposed  to  the  receiving  electrode   14.   The  receiving portions   18a  are   formed  of  spiral  patterns  with  the  same lead  angle  as  the  transmitting  electrode  array  13,   and  the transmitting  porrion  18b  is   formed  of  a  rectangular pattern  similar  to  the  receiving  electrode  14,   and connected  to  the  receiving  portions  18a.      In  Fig.4B,   the overlapping  state  between  the  transmitting  electrode  array 13,   the  receiving  electrode   14   and  the  coupling  electrodes 18   is  shown  by  dotted  lines.   The  coupling  electrodes  18 are  disposed  at  the  same  pitch  Pr  as  the  transmitting wavelength  Wtl  with  widths  covering  four  transmitting electrodes  13.   In  the  rotary  encoder  of  Fig.2,   the  phase change  in  one  revolution  of  the  rotor   12   is  360°x  2=720°. In  contrast,   in  the  rotary  encoder  in  Fig.   4,   the  phase change  in  one  revolution  of  the  rotor  12  is  360°.<br>
In  this  embodiment,   the  electrode  patterns  and  the<br><br>
lead  wires  can  be  formed  of  an  FPC  substrate  as  same  as the  above-described  embodiment.   In  this  case,   as  shown  in Fig.4C,   the  FPC  substrate   17  on  which  the  lead   linen   15, 16   are  formed  are  dragged  not   from  the  edges,   but  through the  side  opening  of  the  stator  11.<br>
According  to  the  embodiment,   even  if  the  concentricity between  the  stator  11   and  the  rotor  12   is  not   sufficient, the  installing  precision  does  not  give  a  large  influence for  measuring  precision.   Because,   as  a  result  of  using  the spiral  electrode  patterns,   the  intensity  of  the  output signal  is  equalized  in  angular  direction.   Further,   since the  lead  lines   15,   16  are  drawn  out  in  perpendicular  to the  axis  of  the  encoder,   the  interference  between  the coupling  electrodes   18  on  the  rotor   12   and  the  lead  lines 15,   16   is  decreased.<br>
Fig.SA  and  Fig.SB  show  electrode  patterns  according  to another  embodiment,   corresponding  to  Fig.4A  and  Fig.48, respectively.   In  this  embodiment,   the  receiving  electrode 14  on  the  stator   11   is  disposed  near  to  the  transmitting electrode  array  13  in  angular  direction,   and  has  a rectangular  pattern  longitudinal   in  axial  direction.   The coupling  electrode  18  on  the  outer  surface  of  the  rotor  12 is   formed  of  only  a  spiral  pattern  capacitively  coupled  tc both  the  transmitting  electrode  array   13   and  the  receiving electrode   14,   with  the  same  lead  angle  as  the  transmittinc a^ ar^i-Trnde  array  13.   Alternatively,   the  receiving  portion<br><br>
coupled  to  the  transmitting  electrode  array   13,   can  not  be distinguished   from  the  transmitting  portion  of   the coupling  electrode  18,   which  is  capacitively  coupled  to the  receiving  electrode  14,   and  these  portions  are  formed of  a  continuous   spiral  pattern.<br>
According  to  the  embodiment,   the  variation  of  the  gaps between  each  of  the  transmitting  electrodes   13   and  the coupling  electrode  18,   and  the  variation  of  the  gaps between  the  coupling  electrode  18  and  the  receiving electrode  14  are  equalized  to  be  decreased.<br>
Figs.6A  and   6B  show  expanded  electrode  patterns according  to  another  embodiment,   corresponding  to  Figs.4A and  4B,   respectively.   In  this  embodiment,   the  coupling electrode   18   is  divided  into  a  plurality  of  electrodes uniformly  spaced  with  a  pitch  obtained  by  dividing  the transmitting  wavelength  Wtl  by  an  integer  n   (=2  or  more). In  details,   the  coupling  electrode   18   in  the  above-described  embodiments   is  divided  into  5  electrodes,   then these  electrodes  are  disposed  at  a  pitch  of   Z/rr/lO    with spiral  patterns.   Although  eight  transmitting  electrodes array  13  have  the  same  patterns  as  that  in  Fig.4A,   the phases  of  alternating  signals  are  different  from  that  in Fig.4A.   Alternatively,   eight  phases  alternating  signals whose  phases  are  sequentially  shifted  of  135°   are  supplied to  the  transmitting  electrodes  13,   as  shown  in  Fig.   6A.<br>
According  to  this  embodiment,   when  the  rotor  12 rotates  1/10  revolution   (i.e.,   36°),   the  phase  change  of<br><br>
the  output  signal   is  just  360°.   In  other  words,   when  the rotor   12   rotates  one  revolution,   the  output  signal  changes for  10  periods.   The  principle  of  the  measuring  method  and the  detailed  measuring  circuit  in  the  above-mentioned embodiment  has  been  described  in  details   in  USP4,878,013 specification.<br>
Fig.7  shows  the  measuring  circuit,   and  Fig,8   shows   the signal  waveforms  and  the  relations  between  the  signals  as the  horizontal  axis  serves  as  time.   In  Fig.7,   a  block  100 is  a  rotary  encoder.   A  plurality  of  alternating  signals which  have  different  phase  from  each  other  are  supplied  to the  transmitting  electrodes.   An  oscillator  400,   which generates  an  alternating  signal  having  a   frequency selected  in  100  to  200kHz,   is  used  as  a  signal  generating source.   An  output   fO  from  the  oscillator  400   is  divided  bji a   frequency  divider  600,   thereafter  transformed  into  eight alternating  signals,   whose  phases  are  shifted  with  135° each  at  a  phase  transformer  340.   Then  the  alternating signals  are  modulated  by  the  output  fO  at  a  modulator  620 to  be  eight  signals  200-1,   200-2,   --,   200-8  which  are supplied  to  the  transmitting  electrodes.<br>
The  rotary  encoder  100  is  driven  by  the  output  signal 202  from  the  modulator  620,   and  outputs  a  displacement signal   from  the  receiving  electrode.   The  displacement signal   is  amplified  by  a  differential   amplifier  640  to  be output  as  a  signal  204,   The^envelope  of  the  output  signal 204  is,   as  shown  in  Fig.8,   a  sine  waveform.   The  output<br><br>
signal   204  is  then  demodulated  in  a  demodulator  660  which is   synchronized  by  the  output   fO  of  the  oscillator  400. Comparing  the  phase  of  the  demodulated  signal   206   and  the reference  signal  300  generated  when  the  rotor  is  at  a reference  point,   phase  difference   0    is  obtained.   The phase  difference   0    is  determined  by  the  relative  position between  the  rotor  and  the  stator.<br>
The  demodulated  signal   206  including  harmonic components  is  passed  through  a  filter  680  to  be  less distorted  signal  208.   The  signal   208   is  input  to  a  zero-cross  circuit  700  to  be  detected  a  zero-cross  position  of the  waveform.   In  this  circuit,   a  counter  720  is  used  as  a digital  calculating  means   for  obtaining  the  above-mentioned  phase  d.i f f erence   0 .<br>
The  reset/start  signals   for  the  counter  720  is synchronized  with  the  trigger  signal  of  the  demodulator 660  and  a  control  unit  800.   The  zero-cross  point   signal  of the  reference  signal   is  used  as  start  trigger  of   the counter  720.     The  counting  timing  is  controlled  by  the output   fO  of  the  oscillator  400.   The  counting  operation  is stopped  by  the  output  of  the  zero-cross  circuit  700. Alternatively,   the  zero-cross  circuit  700  generates  a  stop signal  at  the  position  corresponding  to  the  phase difference   <f>,     as  shown  in  Fig. 8.<br>
A  count  value  210  in  the  counter  720  shows  an  amount of  the  phase  sift  of  the  reference  signal  300  by  the rotary  encoder  100.   The  count  value  210  corresponding  to<br><br>
the  phase  difference  is  processed  in  an  arithmetic  circuit 740  to  be  converted  into  a  position  signal.   The  converted position  signal   is  supplied  to  a  display  780  through  a driver  760.   The  display  780  displays  a  measured  value  in  a digital  manner.<br>
Figs.9A  and  9B  show  electrode  patterns  in  a  rotary encoder  according  to  another  embodiment  which  has  A,   B sets  of  electrode  patterns  shown  in  Figs.4A  and  43  in axial  direction.   The  receiving  electrode  14  on  the  inner surface  of  the  stator  11   is  commonly  used  for  A  and  B sets.   The  transmitting  electrode  array  13   in  A  and  B  sets have  reverse  spiral  patterns  each  other.   Each corresponding  transmitting  electrodes   13   in  A  and  B  sets is  commonly  driven  by  the  same  phase  signal.<br>
Corresponding  to  the  electrode  pattern  in  the  stator 11,   A  and  B  sets  of  coupling  electrodes  18  are  disposed  on the  outer  surface  of  the  rotor  12  in  axial  direction  with reverse  spiral  patterns  each  other.<br>
According  to  the  embodiment,   the  phases  of  A  and  B portions  change  in  the  same  direction  in  accordance  with rotating  of  the  rotor  12.   In  contrast,   the  phases  of  A  and B  portions  change  in  reverse  directions  each  other  in accordance  with  linear  moving  of  the  rotor  12  in  axial direction.   Therefore,   unnecessary  phase  shifts  in  A  and  B sets  can  be  automatically  canceled  on  the  output  signal. As  a  result,   influence  of  variation  in  axial  direction  can be  reduced.<br><br>
In  the  embodiment  of  Figs.   9A,   9B,   the  smaller  the difference  between  the  signal  intensities   in  A  and  B portions   is,   the  larger  the  effect  of  canceling  influence of  variation  in  axial  direction  is.      Fig.lOA  and  Fig.108 show  electrode  patterns  according  to  another  embodiment, each  corresponding  to  Fig.   9A  and  Fig.9B.   In  this embodiment,   different  to  Figs.   9A,   9B,   the  coupling electrodes  18  are  separated  from  each  other  between  A  and B  portions,   as   shown  in  Fig.lOB,   by  a  separation  area  C. In  accordance  with  the  separation  of  the  coupling electrodes  18,   the  receiving  electrodes  14  in  A,   B portions  on  the  stator  11   are  separated  from  each  other. The  output  of  the  receiving  electrodes   14   in  A,   B  portions are  individually  drawn  to  be  processed.<br>
The  measuring  circuit  used  for  the  embodiment  in  Figs. lOA,   lOB  is  shown  in  Fig.11.   Different   from  Fig.3,   two outputs   from  A,   B  portions  of  the  rotary  encoder   10  are integrated  by  two  integrators  23a,   23b,   respectively.   Two outputs   from  the  integrators  23a,   23b  are  processed  in  two phase  comparators  24a,   24b,   respectively.   The  counter  25 count  clocks  from  the  oscillator  21   in  accordance  with  the detected  signals  of  the  phase  comparators  24a,   24b  to output  position  data.   In  the  counter  25,   the  outputs  AG, BO,   each  derived  from  A,   B  portions,   are  equalized  to output  the  resultant  signal  according  to  the  following formula:   (AO+BOJ/2.<br>
According  to  this  embodiment,   influence  of  variation<br><br>
in  axial  direction  can  be  more  effectively  reduced.<br>
Figs.12A  and  12B  show  electrode  patterns  according  to another  embodiment  which  was  developed  based  on  the construction  in  Figs.6A  and  6B.   As  shown  in  Figs.l2A  and 12B,   A  and  B  sets  of  electrode  patterns  are  arranged  on the  stator  11  and  the  rotor  12,   respectively.   The  layout of  the  transmitting  electrodes  13  and  the  receiving electrode  14  on  the  stator  11  is  similar  to  that  of Fig.SA.   In  this  embodiment,   the  receiving  electrodes   14   in A,   B  sets  are  commonly  connected  to  an  external  measuring circuit  as  similar  to  the  embodiment  of  Figs.QA  and  9B.<br>
Fig.13  shows  a  construction  of  a  small  measuring apparatus  in  which  the  above-described  embodiments  is applied.   The  stator  11  and  the  circuit  module  32   are formed  of  an  injection  molded  plastics  product  in  one body.   Therefore,   the  stator  11  is  not  an  individual halfway  cylindrical  member,   but  has   a  halfway  cylindrical inner  surface  which  is  opposed  to  the  rotor  12.   On  the module  32,   an  LSI   33,   an  LCD  34,   switches  35,   36   and  othei necessary  parts  are  mounted.   The  stator  11  has  electrode patterns  and  lead  lines  formed  on  the  inner  surface  as similar  to  the  above-described  embodiments,   and  the  lead lines  are  connected  to  the  LSI  33.   The  electrode  patterns can  be  formed  by  affixing  a  FPC  substrate,   or  by  machininc a  metal   film  directly  deposited  on  the  inner  surface  of the  plastic  product.   The  rotor  12  is  mounted  on  a  spindle of  a  to-be-measured  machine  (   not  shown)   by  use  of  a<br><br>
position-aligning bush 31, then the module 32 is jointed to the bush 31. Finally, a cover 37 and a battery 38 are attached.<br>
As  described  above,   the  small  displacement  measuring device  can  be  easily  installed  on  the  to-be-measured machine.<br>
In  the  present  invention,   it  is  not  necessary  that  t incomplete  cylindrical  member  is   a  just  half  cylindrical member.   For  example,   as  shown  in  Fig.14,   an  incomplete cylindrical  stator  11   smaller  than  just  half  of  a  comple cylindrical  member  can  be  used.   As  shown  in  Fig.15,   an incomplete  stator  11   larger  than  just  half  of  a  complete cylindrical  member  can  be  also  used.   In  the  device  of Fig,15,   the  cylindrical  rotor  12  can  not  be  inserted  in the  stator  11  through  the  side  opening,   but  can  be inserted  in  the  stator   11   through  the  edge  opening.   In this  case,   comparing  to  a  case  that  complete  cylindricaJ member  is  used,   it  is  more  easy  to  form  the  electrode patterns  and  to  draw  out  the  lead  lines.<br>
Figs.l6A  and  16B  show  another  embodiment  in  which  a stator  is   formed  on  a  plate.   As  shown  in  Fig.l6A,   a  stal portion  41  is  formed  on  a  plate  40.   The  stator  portion  i has,   as  shown  in  Fig.l6B,   the  same  transmitting  electroc array  13  and  the  receiving  electrode  14  as  Fig.4A  by sputtering  and  etching  processes.   On  the  plate  40,   lead lines  16,   17  continued  from  the  stator  portion  41  are. a. formed  at  the  same  time  in  the  above-described  processe;<br><br>
An  LSI   43  and  an  LCD  44  are  mounted  on  the  plate  40. Electric  wires  connecting  between  the  LSI   43   and  the  LCD 44  are  not  shown,   but  formed  on  the  plate  40.   The  rotor  12 is  disposed  to  be  opposed  to  the  stator  portion  41,   as shown  in  Fig,16A.   On  the  rotor  12,   the  coupling  electrode are   formed  similar  to  Fig.4B.<br>
According  to  the  embodiment,   it  is  not  necessary  to use  a  FPC  substrate  for  the  stator  portion  41.   It  is  able to  form  the  stator  portion  40  by  use  of  conventional techniques,   sputtering,   vapor  deposition,   etching,   and  the like.   As  a  result,   the  manufacturing  cost  can  be  reduced. The  device  assembling  is  easy.<br>
Figs.l7A  to  17c  show  another  embodiment  applied  to  a linear  encoder.   Fig.l7A  is  a  plan  view  of  the  linear encoder  50.   The  linear  encoder  50  has  a  halfway cylindrical  scale  51   and  a  cylindrical  scale   52   as  similar to  the  above-described  rotary  encoder.   Figs.l7B  and  17C are  electrode  patterns  on  the  scale  52  and  the  scale  51 rolled  out,   respectively.   The  scale  52   is   longer  than  the scale  51.   The  scale  52  is  prevented  from  relative  moving in  angular  direction  to  the  scale  51,   and  movable  only  in axial  direction,   as  shown  by  an  arrow.<br>
As  formed  on  the  inner  surface  of  the  halfway cylindrical  scale  51,   as  shown  in  Fig.l7C,   are  eight transmitting  electrodes  13  and  a  receiving  electrode  14. The  transmitting  electrodes  13  have  spiral  patterns. Although  only  one  unit  of  transmitting  electrodes  13<br><br>
corresponding  to  a  transmitting  wavelength  pitch  Wtl   is shown  in  Fig.l7C,   plural  units  of  the  transmitting electrodes  can  be  arranged.   The  receiving  electrode  14  is formed  near  to  the  transmitting  electrodes   13  with  a rectangular  pattern  longitudinal  in  axial  direction.<br>
On  the  outer  surface  of  the  scale  52,   as  shown  in Fig.l7B,   a  plurality  of  receiving  portions   18a  of  the coupling  electrode  18  are  formed  with    spiral  patterns having  the  same  lead  angle  as  the  transmitting  electrodes 13  at  pitch  Pr2   (=  Wtl)   in  axial  direction.   Each  receiving portion  18a  is  capacitively  coupled  to  four  transmitting electrodes  13.   The  transmitting  portion  18b  of  the coupling  electrode  18  which  is  capacitively  coupled  to  the receiving  electrode  14   is   formed  with  an  elongated  pattern in  axial  direction.   The  coupling  electrode  18  can  be formed  of  a  continuing  spiral  pattern  surrounding  the scale   52.<br>
The  linear  encoder  has  a  different  construction  from the  conventional  encoder,   but  the  principle  of  the construction  is  the  same  as  that  of  Fig.29.   Therefore,   it is  able  to  measure  the  linear  displacement  of  the  scale  52 relatively  moving  to  the  scale  51  in  axial  direction.<br>
Figs.lSA  and  18B  show  another  embodiment  which  have two  sets  of  electrode  patterns  shown  in  Figs.lVB  and   17C in  angular  direction.     According  to  this  embodiment, influence  of  axial  misalignment  between  the  scales  51  and 52  can  be  reduced.<br><br>
Several  embodiments  combining  cylindrical  members  and halfway  cylindrical  members  have  been  described  so  far. Next,   rotary  encoders  which  have  two  complete  cylindrical members  will  be  described.<br>
Fig,19A  shows  a  rotary  encoder  60  according  to  one embodiment.   The  encoder  60  is  composed  of  a  rotor  62  and  a stator  61   surrounding  the  rotor  62.   The  rotor  62   is assembled  to  be  coaxial  with  the  stator  61  with  a predetermined  gap  so  as  to  movable  only  in  angular direction  relative  to  the  stator  61.     Figs.l9B  and  19C show  the  rolled  out  outer  surface  of  the  rotor  62  and  the rolled  out  inner  surface  of  the  stator  61,   respectively.<br>
As  shown  in  Fig.l9C,   the  transmitting  electrode  array 13  and  the  receiving  electrode  14  are  formed  on  the cylindrical   inner  surface  of  the  stator  61   as   similar  to Fig.4A.   The  transmitting  electrode  array  13  has  one  set  of eight  electrodes   formed  of  spiral  patterns  with  a predetermined  lead  angle  at  a  predetermined  pitch  from  one end  of  the  stator  61.   The  receiving  electrodes  14  is formed  of  a  rectangular  pattern  longitudinal  in  angular direction,   at  the  other  end  of  the  stator  61.   Both  of  the transmitting  electrodes  13  and  the  receiving  electrode  14 take  a  round  on  the  inner  surface  of  the  stator  61.<br>
As  shown  in  Fig.l9B,   a  coupling  electrode  18 capacitively  coupled  to  thei  transmitting  electrodes  13  and the  receiving  electrode  14  are  formed  on  the  outer  surface<br>
of  the  rotor  62.   The  couplibg  electrode  18  has  a  receiving<br>
I<br><br>
portion  18a  capacitively  coupled  to  the  transmitting electrodes   13  and  a  transmitting  portion  18b  capacitively coupled  to  the  receiving  electrode  14.   The  receiving portion  18a  has  a  spiral  pattern  with  the  same  lead  angle as  the  transmitting  electrodes  13  and  covers  four transmitting  electrodes  13.   The  transmitting  portion  18b of  a  rectangular  pattern  takes  a  round  on  the  outer surface.<br>
Although a grounded electrode 19 is formed on the space between the coupling electrode 18, the grounded electrode  19  can  be  omitted.<br>
The  transmitting  electrodes  13  and  the  receiving electrode  14   are  drawn  out  by  a  predetermined   lead  lines   ( not  shown)   to  be  connected  to  a  driving/measuring  circuit. Alternating  signals  which  are  phase  shifted  by  45°   each other  are  supplied  in  numerical  sequence  to  the transmitting  electrodes  13  as  similar  to  Fig.4A.<br>
In  this  embodiment,   one  revolution  of  the  outer<br>
surface  of  the  rotor  12  is  equal  to  the  transmitting wavelength  pitch  Wtl  and  the  receiving  electrode  pitch  Pr2 shown  in  Fig.29.   As  a  result,   according  to  this embodiment,   it  is  able  to  measure  the  angular  displacement with  a  high  precise  of or  more.<br>
According  to  the  embodiment,   there  is  no  influence from  axial  misalignment  between  the  stator  61   and  the -  rotor  62.   Because,   one  unit  of  the  spiral  electrodes  are formed  round  the  surface,   the  averaged  intensity  of  the<br><br>
output  signal   is  equalized  in  angular  direction.<br>
Figs.20A  and  20B  show  another  electrode  patterns  of the  stator  62.   In  Fig.20A,   the  transmitting  portion  18b  of the  coupling  electrode  18  is  formed  of  a  spiral  pattern elongated  from  the  spiral  receiving  portion  18a  similar  to that  of  Fig.SB.   In  Fig.20B,   the  transmitting  portion  18b is  formed  as  the  same  pattern  as  Fig.   19B,   and  continued to  the  receiving  portion  18a  without  an  especial  space between  the  transmitting  portion  18b  and  the  receiving portion  18a.<br>
According  to  the  electrode  patterns  in  Fig.20A, comparing  to  Fig.l9B,   misalignment  in  axial  direction  of the  stator  61  relative  to  the  rotor  62  such  as  might  be caused  of  sensor  clearances  is  allowable.   Because,   in contrast  to  that  the  receiving  portion  18a  is  formed within  the  width  l(<lo in fig. the coupling electrode works as receiving portions a whole width iq axial direction. further since patterns are simple manufacturing process of becomes easy. however area transmitting portion actually opposed to is approximately half that fig.lqb.></lo>
According  to  the  electrode  patterns  in  Fig.20B,   not only  misalignment  in  axial  direction  of  the  stator  61 relative  to Jtlie  rotor  62  is  allowable,   but  also  the  area     — of  the  transmitting  portion  18b  opposed  to  the  receiving<br><br>
electrode  14  is  secured  to  be  sufficiently  large.<br>
Figs.ZlA  and  21B  are  another  electrode  patterns corresponding  to  Figs.l9A  and  19B,   respectively.   In  this embodiment,   the  length  I2  of  the  rotor  62  is  smaller  than the  length  1^  of  the  stator  61.   The  electrode  patterns  on the  rotor  62  are  the  same  as  that  of  Fig.20A,   and  the electrode  patterns  on  the  stator  61  are  the  same  as  that of  Fig.l9C.<br>
As  a  result  of  applying  the  above  relations,   the drawing  of  lead  lines  from  the  stator  61   becomes  easy. Further,   misalignment  between  the  stator  61  and  rotor  62 in  axial  direction  is  allowable.<br>
Figs.22A  and  22B  show  another  electrode  patterns  of  a developed  embodiment  corresponding  to  Figs.lQA  and  19B. In  this  embodiment,   the  coupling  electrode  18  is  divided into  5   (generally,   an  integer  greater  than  2)   electrodes uniformly  spaced  with  a  pitch  obtained  by  dividing  the transmitting  wavelength  Wtl  by  5.   Then  these  electrodes are  disposed  at  a  pitch  of  2;rr/10    with  spiral  patterns. Although  eight  transmitting  electrodes  13  have  the  same patterns  as  that  in  Fig.l9C,   the  phases  of  alternating signals  are  different  from  that  in  Fig.l9C. Alternatively,   eight  phases  alternating  signals  whose phases  are  sequentially  shifted  by  135°   are  supplied  to the  transmitting  electrodes   13,   as  shown  in  Fig.22B.<br>
According  to  this  embodiment,   when  the  rotor  62 rotates  1/5.revolution  (i.e.,   72°),   the  phase  change  of<br><br>
the  output  signal  is  just  360°.   In  other  words,   when  the rotor  62  rotates  one  revolution,   the  output  signal  changes for  5  periods.   The  principle  of  the  measuring  method  and the  detailed  measuring  circuit  in  the  above-mentioned embodiment  in  Figs.6A  and  6B.<br>
In  Fig.22A,   the  coupling  electrodes  18  are  formed  of only  spiral  patterns  including  the  receiving  portions  and the  transmitting  portions.   In  contrast,   it  is  able  to  use the  electrode  patterns  shown  in  Fig.23  such  as    the receiving  portions  18a  are  formed  of  spiral  patterns,   and the  transmitting  portion  18b  is   formed  of  a  rectangular pattern  longitudinal  in  angular  direction.   As  a  result, the  coupling  electrodes   18  can  be  opposed  to  the  receiving electrode  14  on  the  stator  61  with  a  large  area.<br>
Figs.24A  and  24B  show  electrode  patterns  of  a  rotary encoder  according  to  another  embodiment  which  has  A,   B sets  of  electrode  patterns  shown  in  Figs.21A  and  21B  in axial  direction.   As  formed  on  the  stator  61,   are  two  sets of  the  transmitting  electrode  array  13  and  the  receiving electrode  14  having  reverse  patterns  each  other.   There  is a  space  of  2a  between  A  and  B  sets  such  that  misalignment in  axial  direction  is  allowable  with  respect  to  the reference  point  ZP.   Each  corresponding  transmitting electrodes  13  in  A  and  B  sets  is  commonly  driven  by  the same  phase  signal.   The  receiving  electrodes  14  in  A,   B set-s  are  commonly-connected  to  the  measuring  circuit.<br>
Corresponding  to  the  electrode  pattern  in  the  stator<br><br>
61,   A  and  B  sets  of  coupling  electrodes   18   are  disposed  on the  outer  surface  of  the  rotor  62  in  axial  direction  with reverse  spiral  patterns  each  other.<br>
According  to  the  embodiment,   the  phases  of  A  and  B portions  change  in  the  same  direction  in  accordance  with the  rotating  of  the  rotor  62.   In  contrast,   the  phases  of  A and  B  portions  change  in  reverse  directions  each  other  in accordance  with  linear  moving  of  the  rotor  62   in  axial direction.   However,   if  the  linear  movement  is  limited within  2a,   the  above  phase  changes  of  A  and  B  portions  are canceled  in  the  output  signal.  As  a  result,   influence  of variation  in  axial  direction  can  be  reduced.<br>
In  the  above  embodiment,   the  space  2a  between  A,   B portions  can  be  laid  not  on  the  stator  61,   but  between  the two  sets  of  the  coupling  electrodes  18  on  the  rotor  62.<br>
Figs.25A  and  25B  show  electrode  patterns  according  to<br>
-. ..	another  embodiment,   each  corresponding  to  Figs.24A  and<br>
24B,   in  which  variation  of  signal  intensity  between  A  and B  portions  is  more  allowable.   In  this  embodiment, different  to  Figs.24A,   24B,   the  coupling  electrodes   18  are separated  from  each  other  between  A  and  B  portions,   as shown  in  Fig.25A  as  separation  area  C.   In  accordance  with the  separation  of  the  coupling  electrodes  18,   the receiving  electrodes  14  in  A,   B  portions  on  the  stator  61 are  separated  from  each  other.   The  output  of  the  receiving electrodes 14 'in  A,   B  portions  are  individually  drawn  to be  processed.<br><br>
The  measuring  circuit  used  in  this  embodiment  is  the same  as  Fig.11.   As  a  result  of  averaging  process  in  the measuring  circuit,   influence  of  variation  in  axial direction  can  be  more  effectively  reduced.<br>
Figs.26A  to  26C  show  a  linear  encoder  with  two cylindrical  members  according  to  another  embodiment. Fig.26A  is  a  perspective  view  of  the  linear  encoder.   This .encoder  has  a  first  cylindrical  scale  71  and  a  second cylindrical  scale  72  which  are  coaxial.   The  second  scale 72  is  longer  than  the  first  scale  71  and  secured  by  a predetermined  mechanism    (not  shown)  so  as  to  be relatively  displaceable  to  the  first  scale  71  only  in axial  direction  as  shown  by  an  arrow  .<br>
Figs.26B  and  26C  are  electrode  patterns  on  the  second scale  72  and  the  first  scale  71  rolled  out,   respectively.<br>
The  first  scale  71  has,   as  shown  in  Fig.26C,   eight transmitting  electrodes  13  and  a  receiving  electrode  14 formed  on  the  cylindrical  inner  surface.   The  transmitting electrodes  13  are  disposed  with  spiral  patterns  outside  a gap  region  of  g.   Although  only  one  unit  of  eight transmitting  electrodes  13  corresponding  to  a  transmitting wavelength  pitch  Wtl  is  shown  in  Fig.26C,   plural  units  of the  transmitting  electrodes  can  be  arranged.   The  receiving electrode  14  is  formed  with  a  rectangular  pattern longitudinal  in  axial  direction  in  the  gap  region  of  g.<br>
On  the  cylindricalr-outer  surface  of  the  second  scale<br><br>
electrodes  18  are  formed  with    spiral  patterns  having  the same  lead  angle  as  the  transmitting  electrodes  13  at  pitch Pr2   (=  Wtl)   in  axial  direction.   Each  coupling  electrode  18 has  a  receiving  portion  18a  capacitively  coupled  to  four transmitting  electrodes   13  and  a  transmitting  portion  18b capacitively  coupled  to  the  receiving  electrode  14.<br>
The  linear  encoder  has  a  different  construction  from the  conventional  encoder,   but  the  principle  of  the construction  is  the  same  as  that  of  Fig.29-   Therefore,   it is  able  to  measure  the  linear  displacement  of  the  scale  72 relatively  moving  to  the  scale  71  in  axial  direction.<br>
In  the  above-described  embodiments,   electrode  patterns on  the  inner  and  outer  surfaces  of  the  cylindrical  or halfway  cylindrical  members  are  formed  of  FPC  J^ubstrates. In  the  case,   optional  insulator  or  metal  material  is  used for  the  cylindrical  or  the  halfway  cylindrical  member.<br>
Figs.27A  and  27B  show  another  method  for  forming spiral  electrode  patterns  on  a  outer  surface  of  a cylindrical  member  80.   As  shown  in  the  expanded  section  in Fig.27B,   the  cylindrical  member  80  is  formed  of  an injection  molded  plastic  body  81,   on  whose  outer  surface  a conductive  film  82,   for  example,   Au,Ni  and  the  like,   is plated.   The  conductive  film  82  is,   for  example,   of  10/μm thick.   The  machining  apparatus  has,   as  shown  in  Fig.27A,   a nut  member  85,   a  feed  screw  83  which  is  able  to  be  fed  at a  predetermined  pitch,   and  a  cutter  84.   The  cylindrical member  80  is  firm  mounted  on  a  end  portion  of  the  feed<br><br>
screw  83,   then  the  cutter  84  is  applied  to  the  outer surface  of  the  cylindrical  member  80.   Then  the  cylindrical member  80  is  fed  with  the  feed  screw  83.   Thus,   a  spiral groove  86,   for  example,   of 0.3μm    depth,   is  formed  on  the outer  surface  of  the  cylindrical  member  80.   As  a  result,   a spiral  electrode  pattern  of  the  conductive  film  82  are formed  on  the  outer  surface.<br>
By  use  of  the  above  method,   the  spiral  electrode patterns  on  the  rotors,   as  shown  in  Fig.SB,   Fig.6B  and  the like,   can  be  easily  formed.   Two  sets  of  the  spiral electrode  patterns  as  shown  in  Fig.9B  or  Fig.l2B  can  be formed  by  controlling  rotating  direction  during  machining. Even  if  the  electrodes  having  other  patterns  in  addition to  the  spiral  patterns,   for  example,   as  shown  in  Fig.4B, can  be  also  formed  by  combination  of  rotation  control  and feed  control.<br>
Fig.28  shows  a  method  for  forming  spiral  electrode patterns  in  an  inner  surface  of  a  cylindrical  member  90. The  cylindrical  member  90  is   formed  of  an  injection  molded plastic  body  91  on  whose  inner  surface  a  conductive  film 92  is  plated.   A  cutting  tool   93  having  eight  cutters  94  on the  edge  is  prepared.   Then  the  cylindrical  member  90  is fed  by  the  same  method  as  shown  in  Fig.27A  such  as  the cutting  tool  93  is  injected  into  the  cylindrical  member 90.   Thus  the  conductive  film  92  is  cut  by  eight  cutters  94 to  be  formed  as  spiral  patterns.   By^his  method,   the spiral  transmitting  electrodes  13  of  the  cylindrical<br><br>
stator  61  shown  in  Fig.l9C,   can  be  formed.   For  the  halfway cylindrical  stator,   for  example  shown  in  Fig.   4A,   the spiral  transmitting  electrodes  13  can  be  also  formed  in  a similar  way.<br>
In  the  above  embodiments,   the  inner  axles  are cylindrical  members  each  having  a  cylindrical  cavity. However,   other  cylindrical  members  which  have  no  cavity can  be  used  as  an  inner  axle.   As  the  outer  collar  members, not  only  rolled  thin  plates,   but  also  other  various materials  including  cylindrical  and  rectangular  blocks  in which  cylindrical  cavities  are  formed  can  be  used. Alternatively,   as  the  outer  collar  members,   optional materials  having  cylindrical  or  incomplete  cylindrical inner  surfaces  being  able  to  be  opposed  to  the  inner member  can  be  used.<br><br><br>
