RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/794,700 and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/794,703, both filed on April 25, 2006.<br>
FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
This disclosure provides compounds having drug and bio-affecting properties, their pharmaceutical compositions and method of use.<br>
In particular, the disclosure is concerned with diketo piperazine and piperidine derivatives that possess unique antiviral activity. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to compounds useful for the treatment of HIV and AIDS.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus -1) infection remains a major medical problem, with an estimated 40 million people infected worldwide at the end of 2005. The number of cases of HIV and AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) has risen rapidly. In 2005, approximately 5.0 million new infections were reported, and 3.1 million people died from AIDS. Currently available drugs for the treatment of HIV include nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors or approved single pill combinations: zidovudine (or AZT or Retrovir®), didanosine (or Videx®), stavudine (or Zerit®), lamivudine (or 3TC or Epivir®), zalcitabine (or DDC or Hivid®), abacavir succinate (or Ziagen®), Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate salt (or Viread®), emtricitabine (or FTC), Combivir® (contains -3TC plus AZT), Trizivir® (contains abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine), Epzicom (contains abacavir and lamivudine), Truvada® (contains Viread® and emtricitabine); non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: nevirapine (or Viramune®), delavirdine (or Rescriptor®) and efavirenz (or<br>
<br>
Sustiva®), and peptidomimetic protease inhibitors or approved formulations: saquinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, lopinaviRa and Kaletra®(lopinavir and Ritonavir). Each of these drugs can only transiently restrain viral replication if used alone. However, when used in combination, these drugs have a profound effect on viremia and disease progression. In fact, significant reductions in death rates among AIDS patients have been recently documented as a consequence of the widespread application of combination therapy. However, despite these impressive results, 30 to 50% of patients ultimately fail combination drug therapies. Insufficient drug potency, non-compliance, restricted tissue penetration and drug-specific limitations within certain cell types (e.g. most nucleoside analogs cannot be phosphorylated in resting cells) may account for the incomplete suppression of sensitive viruses. Furthermore, the high replication rate and rapid turnover of HIV-1 combined with the frequent incorporation of mutations, leads to the appearance of drug-resistant variants and treatment failures when sub-optimal drug concentrations are present. Therefore, novel anti-HIV agents exhibiting distinct resistance patterns, and favorable pharmacokinetic as well as safety profiles are needed to provide more treatment options.   Improved HIV fusion inhibitors and HIV entry coreceptor antagonists are two examples of new classes of anti-HIV agents currently being studied by a number of investigators.<br>
The properties of a class of HIV entry inhibitors called HIV attachment inhibitors has been improved in an effort to obtain compounds with maximized utility and efficacy as antiviral agents. A disclosure describing indoles of which the structure shown below for BMS-705 is representative has been disclosed [Antiviral Indoleoxoacetyl Piperazine Derivatives].<br>
(Formula  Removed)<br>
<br>
<br>
Two other compounds, referred to in the literature as BMS-806 and BMS-O43 have been described in both the academic and patent art:<br>
(Formula  Removed)<br>
<br>
Some description of their properties in human clinical trials have been disclosed in literature.<br>
It should be noted that in all three of these structures, a piperazine amide (In these three structures a piperazine phenyl amide) is present and this group is directly attached to an oxoacetyl moiety. The oxoacetyl group is attached at the 3-position of 4-Fluoro indole in BMS-705 and to the 3 position of substituted azaindoles in BMS-806 and BMS-O43.<br>
In an effort to obtain improved anti-HIV compounds, later publications described in part, modifed substitution patterns on the indoles and azaindoles. Examples of such effort include: (1) novel substituted indoleoxoacetic piperazine derivatives, (2) substituted piperazinyloxoacetylindole derivatives, and (3) substituted azaindoleoxoacetic piperazine derivatives.<br>
Replacement of these groups with other heteraromatics or substituted heteroaroamatics or bicyclic hydrocarbons was also shown to be feasible. Examples include: (1) indole, azaindole and related heterocyclic amidopiperazine derivatives; (2) bicyclo 4.4.0 antiviral derivatives; and (3) diazaindole derivatives.<br>
A select few replacements for the piperazine amide portion of the molecules have also been described in the art and among these examples arc (1) some piperidine<br>
alkenes; (2) some pyrrolidine amides; (3) some N-aryl or heteroaryl piperazines; (4) some piperazinyl ureas; and (5) some carboline containing compounds.<br>
Method(s) for preparing prodrugs for this class of compounds was disclosed in Prodrugs of Piperazine and Substituted Piperidine Antiviral Agents (Ueda et al., U.S. non- provisional application Ser. No. 11/066,745, filed 02/25/2005 or US20050209246A1 or WO2005090367A1).<br>
A published PCT patent application WO2003103607A1 (June 11, 2003) disclosures an assay useful for assaying some HIV inhibitors.<br>
Several published patent applications describe combination studies with piperazine benzamide inhibitors, for example, US20050215543 (WO2005102328A1), US20050215544 (WO2005102391AI), and US20050215545 (WO2005102392A2).<br>
A publication on new compounds in this class of attachment inhibitors (Jinsong Wang et. al. Org. Biol. Chem. 2005, 3, 1781-1786.) and a patent application on some more remotely related compounds have appeared WO2005/016344 published on February 24,2005.<br>
Published patent applications WO2005/016344 and WO2005/121094 also describe piperazine derivatives which are HIV inhibitors. The compounds described in these applications are structurally distinct from the compounds of the present disclosure.<br>
Nothing in these references can be construed to disclose or suggest the novel compounds of this disclosure and their use to inhibit HIV infection.<br>

A chemist skilled in the art is aware of many standard conditions for reacting an amine with an acyl halide 1 (Scheme 1) and carboxyl acid 4 (Scheme 2) that could be used to convert the acid chloride or acid to the desired amide products. Some general references of these methodologies and directions for use are contained in "Comprehensive Organic Transformation" by Richard C. Larock, Wiley-VCH, New York, 1989, 972 (Carboxylic acids to amides), 979 (Acid halides to amides).<br>
Scheme 1<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
<br>
Scheme 1 depicts a general method for forming an amide from piperazine amidine 2 and acyl chloride 1. An appropriate base (from catalytic to an excess amount) selected from sodium hydride, potassium carbonate, triethylamine, DBU, pyridine, DMAP or di-isopropyl ethyl amine was added into a solution of agent 2 and acyl chloride in an appropriate solvent selected from dichloromethane, chloroform, benzene, toluene, THF, diethyl ether, dioxane, acetone, N,N-dimethylformamide or pyridine at room temperature. The reaction was carried out at either room temperature or experimentally determined optimum temperature up to 150°C over a period of time (30 minutes to 16 hours) to afford compounds 3 which may either be compounds of formula I or precursors. Some selected references involving such reactions include a) Indian J. Chem., Sect B 1990, 29, 1077; 2) Chem. Sci. 1998, 53, 1216; 3) Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1992, 40, 1481; 4) Chem. Heterocycl.

<br>
Alternatively, as shown in Scheme 2, structure 2 can be coupled with an acid 4 using standard amide bond or peptide bond forming coupling reagents. Many reagents for amide bond couplings are known by an organic chemist skilled in the art and nearly all of these are applicable for realizing coupled amide products. The combination of ED AC and triethylamine in tetrahydrofuran or BOPC1 and diisopropyl ethyl amine in chloroform have been utilized most frequently but DEPBT, or other coupling reagents such as PyBop could be utilized. Another useful coupling condition employs HATU ((a) J.Chem.Soc. Chem Comm. 1994, 201; (b) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994, 116,11580). Additionally, DEPBT (3-(diethoxyphosphoryloxy)-l,2,3-benzotriazin-4(3.H)-one) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine, commonly known as Hunig's base, represents another<br>
efficient method to form the amide bond and provide compounds of Formula I. DEPBT is either purchased from Adrich or prepared according to the procedure described in Organic Lett., 1999,1, 91. Typically an inert solvent such as DMF or THF is used but other aprotic solvents could be used.<br>
The general agent 2 that's use are exemplified in Schemes 1 and 2, are either commercially available or may be prepared by the general methods described in the experimental section. A few nonlimiting examples of either commercially available or synthesized reagents 2 is listed below:<br>
(Formula  Removed)<br>
When X is N in Formula I, it can be also prepared by coupling acyl chloride 1 or acid 4 with Boc-protected piperazine under the conditions described in Scheme 1 and 2, to furnish compound 5. The following well established deprotection of Boc group under acidic conditions would provide piperazine amide 6. TFA and aqueous HC1 are the typical acids used to effect removal of the Boc group, while the most commonly used solvents are either ether or dichloromethane. TFA may be employed as both reagent and solvent in some instances. Other acidic agents such as formic acid and solvents could also be used to effect BOC removal. The amide 6 could react<br>
<br>
with halide under SN2, SNAR and metal-mediated cross coupling to provide compound 3 (compounds of formula I or precursors).<br>

(Scheme Removed)<br>
<br>
For SN2 and SNAr reaction, in an aprotic (e.g., THF, DMF, DMSO, benzene) or protic solvent (e.g., MeOH, EtOH, PrOH, BuOH), at temperature from room temperature to 150°C, in the absence or presense of base such as NaH, pyridine, Et3N, di-Pr2NEt, Na2CO3, K2CO3, piperazine amide 6 can react with halide or heteroaryl sulfone 7 to give compound 3.<br>
<br>
For metal-mediated cross coupling, temperature could vary from room temperature to 15G°C and solvents prefer to be aprotic solvents such as THF, dioxane, DME, DMF and DMSO. Bases can be selected from NaH, KH, pyridine, Et3N, di-Pr2NEt, Na2CO3, K2CO3, NaHMDS, LiHMDS, KHMDS, Na3PO4, Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4. Pd, Rh, Ru, Ni or Pt agents can be utilized as catalysts.<br>

Unless otherwise stated, solvents and reagents were used directly as obtained from commercial sources, and reactions were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. Flash chromatography was conducted on Silica gel 60 (0.04O-O.063 particle size; EM Science supply).   1H NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker DRX-500f at 500 MHz (or Bruker DPX-300B or Varian Gemini 300 at 300 MHz as stated). The chemical shifts were reported in ppm on the 8 scale relative to 8TMS = 0. The following internal references were used for the residual protons in the following solvents: CDC13 (H 7.26), CD3OD (H 3.30), and DMSO-d6 (H 2.50). Standard acronyms were employed to describe the multiplicity patterns: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), m (multiplet), b (broad), app (apparent). The coupling constant (J) is in Hertz.

The materials and experimental procedures used to obtain the results reported in Tables 3-4 are described below.<br>
Cells:<br>
•	Virus production-Human embryonic Kidney cell line, 293T, was propagated in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% fetal Bovine serum (FBS, Sigma, St. Louis , MO).<br>
•	Virus infection- Human epithelial cell line, HeLa, expressing the HIV-1 receptor CD4 was propagated in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% fetal Bovine serum (FBS, Sigma, St. Louis , MO) and supplemented with 0.2 mg/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).<br>
Viras-Single-round infectious reporter virus was produced by co-transfecting human embryonic Kidney 293 cells with an HIV-1 envelope DNA expression vector and a proviral cDNA containing an envelope deletion mutation and the luciferase reporter gene inserted in place of HIV-1 nef sequences (Chen et al, Ref. 41). Transfections were performed using lipofectAMINE PLUS reagent as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).<br>
Experiment<br>
1. HeLa CD4 cells were plated in 96 well plates at a cell density of 1 X 104 cells per well in 100 µ1 Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium containing 10 % fetal Bovine serum and incubated overnight.<br>
<br>
2.	Compound was added in a 2 ul dimethylsulfoxide solution, so that the final assay concentration would be ≤10 µM.<br>
3.	100 µl of single-round infectious reporter virus in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium was then added to the plated cells and compound at an approximate multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01, resulting in a final volume of 200 µl per well.<br>
4.	Virally-infected cells were incubated at 37 degrees Celsius, in a CO2 incubator,  <br>
 and harvested 72 h after infection.<br>
5.	Viral infection was monitored by measuring luciferase expression from viral DNA in the infected cells using a luciferase reporter gene assay kit, as described by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Infected cell supernatants were removed and 50 µl of lysis buffer was added per well. After 15 minutes, 50 µl of freshly-reconstituted luciferase assay reagent was added per well. Luciferase activity was then quantified by measuring luminescence using a Wallac microbeta scintillation counter.<br>
6.	The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated by quantifying the level of luciferase expression in cells infected in the presence of each compound as a percentage of that observed for cells infected in the absence of compound and subtracting such a determined value from 100.<br>
7.	An EC50 provides a method for comparing the antiviral potency of the compounds of this disclosure. The effective concentration for fifty percent inhibition (EC50) was calculated with the Microsoft Excel Xlfit curve fitting software. For each compound, curves were generated from percent inhibition calculated at 10 different concentrations by using a four paramenter logistic model (model 205). The EC50 data for the compounds is shown in Table 4. Table 3 is the key for the data in Table 4.<br>
