				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to thermoplastic elastomers with good heat and oil<br>
resistance. In particular, the present invention concerns a novel thermoplastic elastomer<br>
having excellent oil resistance at high temperatures along with elastomeric flexibility,<br>
superior mechanical strength and mouldability. The novel elastomer and compositions<br>
thereof can be used as materials for various moulded parts.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
There is a need for modified heat resistant engineering polymers with increased softness<br>
and improved oil resistance. Such polymers would have applications for example as<br>
substitutes for vulcanised rubber in the automotive industry. Typical heat resistant<br>
engineering polymers are, inter alia, crystalline polymers including polyamides (e.g. PA-6)<br>
and polyesters (e.g. PET and PBT), and amorphous engineering polymers, such as<br>
polycarbonate (PC), styrene/acrylonitrile (SAN) and acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene (ABS).<br>
In the past, TPE"s composed of a continuous phase of a heat resistant engineering polymer<br>
and a dispersed phase of an acrylate co/terpolymer have been developed. In all these cases<br>
the cross-linking of the dispersed phase has taken place in the compounding process<br>
(dynamic vulcanization). Especially Advanced Elastomer Systems Inc. (AES) has worked<br>
in this field (US 5,300,573; US 5,523,350; US 5,589,544; and US 5,591,798). The<br>
continuous phase used in the prior art consists of linear polyesters, such as polyalkylene-<br>
terephthalate and -isophthalate or copolyesters thereof (PET, PBT etc.). The dispersed<br>
phase is typically formed by acrylate rubbers, such as polyacrylate rubbers and acrylic<br>
ester copolymer rubbers, preferably provided with functional groups, such as acid,<br>
hydroxy, epoxy, active halogen and similar groups, as cross-linking sites. A typical<br>
dispersed phase is an ethylene-methylacrylate-acrylic acid terpolymer (supplied by Du<br>
Pont under the trade name Vamac ). The cross-linking agents used include polyfunctional<br>
chemical compounds, which covalently bond with the reactive functional groups of the<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Heat and Oil Resistant Thermoplastic Elastomer   AND METHOD OF<br>
rubber forming polymers. If the functional groups in the rubber-forming polymer are<br>
carboxylic acid or acid anhydride groups it is possible to use polyfunctional crosslinking<br>
agents with hydroxy, amine, isocyanate or epoxy groups.<br>
The prior art elastomers discussed above have improved elastomeric properties. However,<br>
they fail simultaneously to meet the requirement of softness, proper temperature resistance<br>
and good oil resistance at high temperatures.<br>
It is known in the art that the properties of polyolefin-based thermoplastic elastomers<br>
(TPE"s) can be modified with solid state grafting and polymerization of the polyolefins<br>
with acrylate monomers. This technology has been been developed by Optatech<br>
Corporation and it is presented, for instance, in EP Patents Nos. 0 418 861,0 476 960 and<br>
0 554 058, FI Patent No. 95038 and US Patent No. 5 993 696 and in EP Patent<br>
Applications Nos. 95941099,98922816.8 and 98660048.4. The modified TPE"s, which are<br>
commercially available under the trade name PACREL®, exhibit excellent mechanical<br>
properties including elastomeric flexibility, creep resistance at high temperature, superior<br>
mechanical strength and mouldability. The heat and oil resistances of the TPE"s are,<br><br>
however, limited by the melting points of the polyolefin-based continuous phases.    <br>
Attempts to use a similar approach as for the production of PACREL in the case of <br>
engineering polymers have, however, failed. Thus, it has turned out that the above-      <br>
mentioned crystalline engineering polymers cannot be impregnated with acrylate<br>
monomers, whereas amorphous engineering polymers become sticky and they partly<br>
dissolve in the acrylate phase. It would appear that, for instance butylacrylate, which is<br>
rather hydrophobic, has a driving force from the hydrophilic water phase towards the<br>
hydrophobic polyolefin phase. For this reason it can be impregnated into polyolefin pellets<br>
as outlined in the above-cited patents. However, with hydrophilic pellets, like polyamide,<br>
there is no such driving force. Even if the temperature is increased in order to increase the<br>
free volume in the polyamide pellets no significant impregnation takes place.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide novel TPE"s, which have good<br>
mechanical properties in combination with softness and good oil resistance at high<br>
temperatures.<br>
It is a another object of the invention to provide a method of producing thermoplastic<br>
elastomers.<br>
These and other objects, together with the advantages thereof over known elastomers,<br>
which shall become apparent from the specification which follows, are accomplished by<br>
the invention as hereinafter described and claimed.<br>
Working with hydrophilic polymers in connection with the present invention, we have now<br>
surprisingly found that it is possible to impregnate TPE"s based on engineering polymers,<br>
such as polyesters, polyamides and polyurethane, with large amounts of acrylate<br>
monomers even at rather low temperatures if the raw-materials contain hydrophilic soft<br>
segments. The proportion of soft segments to the hard segments of the modified TPE"s is<br>
usually about 1:99 to 90:10, preferably 5:95 to 80:20 (calculated by weight). A minimum<br>
amount is needed for achieving impregnation and at the very high amounts of more than<br>
90 % the mechanical properties of the engineering polymers are largely lost. The amount<br>
of acrylate monomers, which can be incorporated into the polymer by means of the present<br>
invention is generally from 1 to 90 parts by weight, in particular 10 to 70 parts by weight,<br>
of the total polymer (the engineering soft block polymer + polymerized, cross-linked<br>
acrylate).<br>
The finding that it is possible to incorporate into engineering polymers acrylates and<br>
similar monomers which form polymers having low glass transition temperature and which<br>
are capable, after absorption, polymerization and cross-linking, e.g. by the radical<br>
mechanism, of forming thermoplastic elastomers, was unexpected because many of the<br>
modified TPE"s are even more hydrophilic than the afore-mentioned engineering polymers<br>
from which they are derived. Preferably, the polyester, polyamide and polyurethane based<br>
TPE"s, which can be used as raw materials, contain hydrophilic soft segments of the<br>
polyether or polyester types. It would appear that the flexibility of the soft segments<br>
probably contributes to a very efficient impregnation of the TPE"s in spite of their<br>
hydrophilic character.<br>
It was also surprising and unexpected that the radical polymerization of the acrylate<br>
monomers includes grafting of these matrixes which do not contain very much labile<br>
hydrogens like in polyolefins.<br>
More specifically, the thermoplastic elastomers of the present invention is mainly<br>
characterized by what is stated in the characterizing part of claim 1.<br>
The method according to the present invention is mainly characterized by what is stated in<br>
the characterizing part of claim 18.<br>
Considerable advantages are obtained by the present invention. Thus, by incorporating a<br>
cross-linked polyacrylate phase into a block-elastomer based on an engineering polymer,<br>
such as a polyester, polyamide or polyurethane, softer compounds are obtained and these<br>
can be made even softer by adding a plasticizer. Corresponding heat-resistant<br>
polycondensation polymers without soft segments cannot absorb enough acrylates.<br>
Polyacrylates and plasticizers also decrease the cost of the polymer or polymer<br>
composition which can be even further reduced by adding engineering polymers like PET,<br>
PBT, PA-6, PA-66 and/or fillers (which of course increase the hardness).<br>
With many compounding formulations the compounds described above can stand IRM 903<br>
oil at temperatures above 150 °C whereas the newest family of PP-based Pacrel can stand<br>
IRM 903 up to 125 °C.<br>
TPE"s made by impregnating and polymerizing polyester-, polyamide-, polyurethane- etc.<br>
block-elastomers with alkyl(meth)acrylates, such as methylacrylate, ethylacrylate,<br>
butylacrylate and ethylhexylacrylate, and functional (meth)acrylates, including glycidyl-<br>
(meth)acrylate, (meth)arcylic acid, maleic anhydride and diacrylates, can be used as the<br>
only polymer component in the compounding process or they can be blended with<br>
polymers compatible with the continuous phase (PET, PBT, PA-6, PA-66 etc.) and/or<br>
polymers which are compatible with the dispersed phase (acrylonitrile and/or acrylate ester<br>
based vulcanized or non-vulcanized elastomers etc.). In the compounding stage also<br>
dynamic vulcanization can be done if very high cross-linking densities are needed. It is,<br>
however, an important feature of the present invention that dynamic vulcanization in the<br>
compounding stage is not needed because cross-linking of the dispersed phase takes place<br>
already in the polymerization stage. Plasticizers, fillers and additives are naturally also<br>
added in the compounding stage. Different compatibilizers which improve the adhesion<br>
between the two phases and hence the mechanical properties of the compounds can be<br>
added. The most suitable plasticizers are long-chain aliphatic esters such as adipates,<br>
trimellitates and citrates, and the most suitable functional groups for compatibilization are<br>
glycidyl groups.<br>
Compared to dynamic vulcanization, the present invention provides homogeneous<br>
distribution of the cross-linked phase throughout the matrix polymer. Typically, the<br>
smaller the concentrations of the impregnated monomers are, the more difficult it becomes<br>
to obtain homogeneous distribution. In the present invention, the monomers are dissolved<br>
on molecular level. As a result of the good distribution, the present invention will provide<br>
even quality and consistency, better quality control and none of the diffusion problems<br>
typical of viscous materials. It should be pointed out that for products of the present kind,<br>
an even quality is of particular importance, any unreacted reactants will impair the product<br>
causing odours and discolouring. In particular, the conversion of the acrylate monomers<br>
must be as close to 100 % as possible.<br>
The present process is also very uncomplicated and commercially viable and the dispersed<br>
polyacrylate becomes cross-linked already during the polymerization step so that, as<br>
mentioned, no dynamic vulcanization is needed.<br>
Next, the invention will be examined more closely with the aid of a detailed description<br>
and with reference to some working examples.<br>

It is an object of the present invention to produce oil resistant, soft thermoplastic<br>
elastomers with good mechanical properties. According to the invention, segmented heat<br>
resistant polycondensation copolymers can be made softer without loosing their excellent<br>
heat and oil resistance. Thus, the present invention comprises oil and heat resistant<br>
thermoplastic elastomers made by impregnating a heat resistant polycondensation<br>
copolymer containing soft segments, such as TPE-E, TPE-A or TPE-U, with acrylate<br>
monomers and peroxide and polymerizing, grafting and cross-linking inside the pellets.<br>
The TPE"s according to the present invention comprise a first phase containing a cross-<br>
linked polyacrylate polymer and a second phase containing a crystalline engineering<br>
polymer. According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the composition of the present<br>
blends is such that<br>
A.       15-75 parts by weight is formed by a crystalline polymer forming the continuous<br>
phase of the composition and,<br>
B        25-85 parts by weight is constituted by an at least partially cross-linked<br>
polyacrylate elastomer forming the discontinuous phase.<br>
In particular, the blends contain 60 to 20 parts by weight of the crystalline polymer and 40<br>
to 80 parts by weight of a polyacrylate.<br>
The thermoplastic elastomers are produced in a similar way as described in the patents EP<br>
0 418 861, EP 0 476 960, and EP 0 554 058 (solid state grafting and polymerization) but<br>
instead of polyolcfin segmented heat resistant polycondensation copolymers are used. The<br>
polycondensation copolymers are impregnated with acrylate monomers and free radical<br>
polymerization initiator below the decomposition temperature of the initiator, after which<br>
the mixture is heated to a temperature sufficiently high to polymerize the acrylate<br>
monomer.<br>
The impregnation is effected by mixing the components while the temperature of the<br>
reactor is gradually increased to the most suitable impregnation temperature, which can be<br>
obtained from the impregnation tests described in the following examples. The<br>
impregnation is carried out in such a way that the polymer pellets are added to the reactor<br>
together with the initiator mixed with the acrylate monomers, which can be methyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, butyl (meth)acrylate, ethylhexylacrylate etc. The<br>
impregnation can be completed in the presence of 80-1000 parts by weight water, without<br>
water, or by discontinuously adding 1-60 % by weight of water.<br>
The radical initiator preferably comprises a peroxide. These peroxides include diperoxides,<br>
peroxy esters and hydrogen peroxide and similar substances containing a -O-O- bond.<br>
Similar radicals can also be formed from substances containing diazo groups and other<br>
similar radical generators used during radical polymerization of acrylate monomers.<br>
As specific examples of peroxides, Triganox 145 - a peroxide which has a half life of 10<br>
hours at 120 °C, can be mentioned.<br>
Generally, the suitable acrylate monomers used for making component the dispersed cross-<br>
linked phase of this invention are (meth)acrylates whose polymer have low glass transition<br>
temperature, i.e. they are rubber like at room temperature and low temperature, preferably<br>
below - 20°C. Suitable acrylates are alkylacrylates having 1 or preferably 2 or more carbon<br>
atoms in the alkyl chain. Methacrylates having a glass temperature low enough are<br>
alkyl-methacrylates having 4 or more, preferably 8 or more carbon atoms in the alkyl<br>
chain. These monomers can be used alone or in mixtures of two or more monomers.<br>
Generally, the elastomer phase may contain units derived from an alkyl ester of acrylic or<br>
methacrylic acid, wherein the alkyl group contains 1-10 carbon atoms.<br>
Together with the above-mentioned monomers, smaller amounts of monomers having less<br>
carbon atoms in the carbon chain can also be used; in particular, a chemically<br>
functionalized acrylate or methacrylate may come into question. Glass transition<br>
temperature of the final products can thus be tailored. According to this invention, one or<br>
more functional monomers are added to the acrylate monomer. Typical functional<br>
monomers are: glycidyl methacrylate, 2-t-butylaminoethyl methacrylate,<br>
polypropyleneglycol monomethacrylate, and mono-methacryloyloxy-ethylphthalate.<br>
Unsaturated acids and anhydrides, such as acrylic and methacrylic acid and maleic<br>
anhydride can also be used.<br>
The cross-linking degree of the thermoplastic elastomer can be also modified by addition<br>
of, for instance, a diacrylate.<br>
Generally, a cross-linking agent (a cross-linker) can be added. The cross-linker can be of a<br>
type containing several unsaturated groups. It can be a phenolic resin curative.<br>
The polymerization of the acrylate monomers that have been absorbed inside the polymer<br>
pellets is initiated by increasing the temperature of the agitated reactor to the<br>
decomposition temperature of the initiator. When the polymerization is completed (no<br>
unreacted monomers), the reactor is cooled. It is essential that all of the monomer is<br>
consumed so that the radical reactions lead to cross-linking and grafting. The product is<br>
i     washed and dried. When high acrylate rubber contents are needed, the polymerization can<br>
be carried out in two or more steps. The product from the first polymerization step is added<br>
into the reactor together with acrylate monomers and initiator, and the procedure described<br>
above is repeated.<br>
The polymers chosen to the tests were the crystalline engineering polymers poly-<br>
butyleneterephthlate (PBT) and polyamide-6, as well as the segmented heat resistant poly-<br>
condensation copolymers copolyester thermoplastic elastomer, copolyamide thermoplastic<br>
elastomer, and thermoplastic polyurethane. These thermoplastic elastomers can have soft<br>
blocks based polyether, polyester, or any other soft block. Both of the monomers n-butyl<br>
acrylate and ethyl acrylate were used in the tests. Also the acrylate comonomer<br>
glycidylmethacrylate was used in most tests.<br>
In the impregnation tests it was found out that the crystalline engineering polymers<br>
absorbed only very low quantities of acrylate monomer. Even if the temperature was<br>
increased over 100 °C, no significant impregnation took place. On the contrary, the<br>
segmented polycondensation copolymers absorbed large amounts of the monomer even at<br>
temperatures below 80 °C. It has thus been proven that the segmented polycondensation<br>
copolymers are well suited to the solid state grafting and polymerization process, and their<br>
properties can thereby be modified in a very beneficial way, whereas the crystalline<br>
engineering polymers give poor results. The soft segments are typically amorphous and,<br>
accordingly, exhibit no crystalline melting point.<br>
After the polymerization stage the polyacrylate phase constitutes a cross-linked, inter-<br>
penetrating polymer network in the segmented polycondensation copolymer. When the<br>
material is compounded under high shear conditions, a more favourable morphology with<br>
small polyacrylate particles evenly dispersed in the plastic matrix is produced.<br>
Typically, the weight ratio between polyacrylate and matrix polymer is 0.1-5, preferably<br>
0.5-2. The TPE can contain up to 90 % of soft segments, typically the TPE contains 1 to 80<br>
wt-%, preferably 5 to 60 wt-% soft segments calculated from the weight of the copolymer.<br>
The impregnation can also be carried out in two or several steps by impregnating and<br>
polymerizing in several steps. In the first step some 1 to 40 %, preferably 5 to 30 %, (by<br>
weight) of the total amount of acrylate monomer is absorbed and then in the subsequent<br>
step(s) the rest. By adding a small amount first and polymerizing it to form a dispersed<br>
phase within the polymer matrix it is possible to increase the total amount of dispersed<br>
acrylate polymer within the matrix.<br>
Properties of the polymerization products<br>
The polymers produced in the polymerizations were used as the only polymer component<br>
in the compounding process. The resultant compounds were injection moulded into 2 mm<br>
thick plates, from which test specimens were punched out. The properties of the<br>
polymerization products were determined according to the methods given in Table 1.<br>
It was found out, that the produced thermoplastic elastomers had high elongation combined<br>
with good oil resistance at elevated temperatures. Some compounds even have excellent oil<br>
resistance at  150°C. Also, the compounds were very soft compared to the starting<br>
materials. For example, when the hardness of the starting material Hytrel® G3548L was 83<br>
Shore A, the polymerization product had the hardness of 62 Shore A.Accordingly, soft thermoplastic elastomers can be produced of the segmented<br>
polycondensation polymers without loosing the most beneficial properties of the latter:<br>
heat- and oil resistance. Because the polymerization products are very soft, they can be<br>
used in a much wider range of applications than the original polycondensation polymers.<br>
Also, the cost of the polycondensation polymers can be lowered by the invention.<br>
Blends with crystalline engineering polymers and/or elastomers<br>
The polymerization products can be blended with crystalline engineering polymers and/or<br>
elastomers in order to modify their properties or to lower the cost of the products. Blends<br>
were produced using a Brabender mixing chamber.<br>
In order to obtain useful products with desired properties it is essential that the crystalline<br>
engineering polymers are compatible with the continuous phase and the elastomers with<br>
the dispersed phase. Examples of crystalline engineering polymers are any kind of<br>
saturated polyester like PET, PBT, PEN, PCT, PCN, etc., and/or any type of polyamide<br>
like PA-6, PA-66, PA-11, PA-12, PA-46, and/or aromatic polyamides, and their<br>
copolymers. Also copolyester elastomer, copolyamide elastomer, and/or thermoplastic<br>
polyurethane can be added to the blend. Typical elastomers that can be added are acrylate-<br>
polymers like NBR, Chemigum, Sunigum, Vamac etc. The elastomers can be cross-linked<br>
or non-cross-linked.<br>
The resultant multiphase thermoplastic composition can be formed into various shapes by<br>
compression molding, injection molding, blow molding and extrusion having attractive<br>
thermoplastic elastomer performance.<br>
Before compounding, plastic additives known per se can be added to the polymer blend<br>
according to the invention. In addition to crystalline engineering polymers and elastomers<br>
also plasticizer, compatabilizer, vulcanizer, filler, and additives can be added. The<br>
plasticizer can be an ester plasticizer. These additives comprise, for instance, pigments,<br>
stabilizers, colouring agents, lubricants, antistatic agents, fillers and fire retardants. An<br>
accelerator with several unsaturated groups can also be added. If desired, the additional<br>
substances can be premixed with, e.g., the polymer matrix before forming the polymer<br>
blend. The amounts of polymer additives are typically about 0.01 to SO %, preferably about<br>
10 to 35 % of the weight of the total thermoplastic elastomer composition.<br>
The thermoplastic elastomer can be compounded after the impregnation and<br>
polymerization steps.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are processed according to methods known per<br>
se in polymer technology to manufacture the final products.<br>
The invention also comprises products containing a thermoplastic elastomer as described<br>
herein and which has been made by any processing method used for thermoplastics and<br>
thermoplastic elastomers.<br>
As a result, thermoplastic elastomer compositions are obtained having good elastomeric<br>
characteristics and stress strain properties.The following non-limiting examples will illustrate the invention:<br>

The samples were injection or compression moulded into ISO test bars and tested using the<br>
following test methods:<br>
Polymers/monomers used<br>
Copolyester thermoplastic elastomer (COPE)<br>
Hytrel® thermoplastic elastomers (DuPont) are block copolymers consisting of a hard<br>
segment of poly(butylene terephthalate) and a soft segment based on long-chain polyether<br>
glycols. There are two main groups depending of the soft segment used: standard and high<br>
performance.<br>
Hytrel* G3548L: Standard low modulus moulding and extrusion grade. Contains colour-<br>
stable antioxidants and some UV-stabilizer.<br>
Hytrel® SS26: High performance medium modulus moulding grade. Contains colour-stable<br>
antioxidants.<br>
Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)<br>
Desraopan® 955 U (Bayer) consists of diisocyanates and long-chain and short-chain diols.<br>
    Ether based Desmopan®-grades have good hydrolysis and microbe resistance and an<br>
excellent low-temperature flexibility. They are used for example in applications requiring<br>
flexibility or impact strength at very low temperatures.<br>
Desmopan® 955 U is a UV-stabilised injection molding grade with good impact strength.<br>
Poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT)<br>
Ultradur® B 6550 (BASF) is a high-viscosity extrusion grade.<br>
Polyamide-6 (PA-6)<br>
Ultramid® B3S (BASF)<br>
NBR elastomer<br>
Chemigum P35 (Goodyear). Pre-crosslinked, low gel, medium ACN, medium viscosity<br>
NBR elastomer in fine powder form.<br>
n-butyl acrylate (BA), ethyl acrylate (EA) (BASF)<br>
Glyddyl methacrylate (NOF Europe)<br>
2,5-bis(tert-burylperoxy)-2,5-dimethyl-3-hexyne (Trigonox 145 E85, Akzo Chemicals,<br>
t1/2 10 hours at 120 °C)<br>
tert-butylperoxy isopropyl carbonate, 75 % solution in mineral turpentine (Trigonox<br>
BPIC C75, Akzo Chemicals, t1/2 10 hours at 98 °C)<br>
Example 1<br>
Impregnation (Descriptions and Curves)<br>
The impregnation test method is used to study the diffusion of a monomer (liquid phase)<br>
into a polymer as a function of time and temperature in order to find out whether it is<br>
possible to use the polymer in Optatech"s proprietary Solid State Polymerization Process<br>
(mentioned above). Also the right impregnation temperature and time can be determined<br>
using this method. Since this test is made under ideal conditions it gives the maximum<br>
amount of monomer absorbed in a given time or the minimum time needed for a certain<br>
impregnation under real process conditions.<br>
The test method is described in the following. About ten testing tubes were placed into an<br>
oil bath. They were identical and each of them contained the same amount of polymer and<br>
monomer. The test tubes were filled with nitrogen and closed. They were put to a stand<br>
that was then placed into an oil bath.<br>
The oil was warmed up gradually starting from room temperature. The temperature was<br>
raised stepwise at the rate of 10 °C/20 min. The test tubes were removed from the oil bath<br>
at 20 min intervals and the exact temperature at the time of removal was observed.<br>
The below listed impregnation tests were completed. The results from the impregnation<br>
tests are given in the following.<br>
The crystalline engineering polymers absorbed only very low quantities of acrylate<br>
monomer. Even if the temperature was increased over 100 °C, no significant impregnation<br>
took place. On the contrary, the segmented polycondensation copolymers absorbed large<br>
amounts of the monomer even at temperatures below 80 °C.<br>
Example 2<br>
Polymerizations<br>
The polymerizations were carried out in a 51 laboratory scale reactor. The plastic pellets,<br>
water, butyl or ethyl acrylate monomer, and initiator were fed into the reactor. In most<br>
polymerizations also glycidyl methacrylate was used. The reactor was purged several times<br>
with nitrogen. During the polymerization the reactor had a nitrogen atmosphere with 0.S<br>
bar overpressure. The stirrer was on during the polymerization.<br>
While it was found out in the impregnation tests that the soft elastomers (Hytrel* G3S48L<br>
and Pebax® 2533 SN01) absorbed large amounts of monomer at low temperatures, the<br>
polymerization was also carried out at low temperatures. The low-temperature initiator<br>
Trigonox BPIC was used in these polymerizations. The harder elastomers needed to be<br>
polymerized at higher temperatures because of the higher impregnation temperature. The<br>
initiator Trigonox 145 E85 was used in these polymerizations.<br>
When the 55 Shore D elastomer Hytrel® 5526 L was used, the polymerization was done in<br>
two steps. A 70 % rubber content can be obtained in this way. During the first step the<br>
temperature of the reactor"s jacket was increased gradually up to 120 °C during 3 hours.<br>
The pellets first absorbed the monomer present in the system. The temperature of the<br>
reactor was observed and a sharp rise indicated polymerization that took place inside the<br>
pellets. After this the reactor was cooled down and the pellets were taken out, washed, and<br>
dried.<br>
In the second polymerization step the above-described sequence was repeated. The pellets<br>
produced in the first polymerization step were fed into the reactor together with water,<br>
monomers, and initiator. The temperature was again increased and the monomer was<br>
polymerized as the temperature was increased.<br>
The following polymerizations were done:<br>
-     Hytrel®G3548L/BA-GMA<br>
-     Hytrel®G3548L/EA+GMA<br>
-     Hytrel®5526/EA-GMA<br>
-     Pebax®2533 SN01/EA<br>
-     Desmopan® 955 U/EA+GMA<br>
