Title : " Asbestos free Sealant for Fuel Injection pump - Wet method "<br>
Background of the invention<br>
This invention relates to Asbestos free sealant material suitable for the use of fuel injection pumps, to enhance the sealing effects in all critical joints.<br>
Description of the related art<br>
Currently in fuel injection pumps, Asbestos sealants are being used to seal the critical joints.<br>
The sealing agent is expected to hold the lubricating oil inside the pump and possess adequate compression strength, high and low temperature resistance and temperature shock, controlled swelling behaviour in oil, vibration resistance, fuel resistance etc.,<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
The object of this invention is to provide a new sealant, wherein use of Asbestos is eliminated and to make it environment friendly.<br>
It is another object of the invention to arrive at an end product whose quality Is better than currently available. Today's fuel injection technology demands that the sealant should withstand severe working conditions and equally resistant to chemically aggressive fuels.<br>
It is another object of the invention in the context of present trend In the International arena towards elimination of Asbestos in sealant preparation, to prepare Asbestos free sealant.<br>
According to the invention, the enhanced quality of the sealant originates from the composition and also from the controlled process which has been developed by the inventors.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to the invention, the sealant sheet Is formed by Beater(Wet- process) and Calendering process. During the process, the necessary ingredients are added in required quantity and sequence while maintaining the process parameters to the specified values, in order to achieve the desired physical, mechanical and functional properties like,<br>
-	single layer pressed with smooth, uniform surface finish<br>
-	does not leave any burrs or break during further processing<br><br>
-	have adequate strength to handle the component<br>
-	ability to withstand low and high temperature changes<br>
(extreme working conditions from-40DCto+150DC)<br>
-	perform as a perfect sealant so that thin fluids like cSesei fuel does not leak at high pressure working conditions<br>
-	good oil absorption with torque retaining property<br>
Describtion of the invention<br>
The sealant, according to invention carried out for resciving the aforementioned disadvanntages, Involves the said process comprising of<br>
a.	Beater (Wet process)<br>
b.	Calendering process<br>
The material selected in the process is a combination of NR+NBR latex as a binder to heat resistant synthetic fiber, which together form the matrix „of the sealant. The fillers are selected for their properties imparting desired level of density, flexibility, heat resistance and amenability to process as a suspension in a beater process. The product comprises of the following;<br>
synthetic pulp<br>
Inorganic salts as fillers<br>
Curing agent<br>
Actlvator<br>
Activator accelerator<br>
Binders<br>
Coagulating Agent<br>
The sheets are made as a specialty product on the required/desired properties of the end product.<br>
In the formulation, the selection of the synthetic pulp as a better replacement for Asbestos Is based on the following;<br><br>
it" should form a uniform aqueous suspension on beating<br>
Minimum duration for better fabrillation<br>
Required sheet strength<br>
Uniform fiber orientation along and across of the formed sheet<br>
As a product it should meet high temperature resistance properties<br>
PAdequate flexibility to withstand high pressure load<br>
The sealant, according to the invention carried out for resolving the aforementioned disadvantages, involves 8 steps;<br>
Step1: Beating of the pulp<br>
In this process, the dilute slurry of the pulp are separated into fine fibers and dispersed by mechanical action using a special beater machine. The dispersed fibers are then shortened to the required fineness measured in terms of Canadian Standard Freeness ( CSF ). The beater action continues till established value CSF 200 Is achieved.<br>
Step 2 : Mixing of pulp<br>
The pulp so prepared is then transferred to mixing machine where it is continuously churned while the necessary fillers, polymers, curing agents, accelerator etc., are added In required quantity and sequence as per the formula developed for obtaining desired properties.<br>
2.1	Curing agent       -  Sulphur 50%wtA/vt<br>
2.2	Accelerators       - Zinc Diethyl Ditho carbonate 50% wtA/vt<br>
-  Tetra methyl thioram Disulphide 50% wbwt<br>
2.3	Activator	50%wtAwt Zinc oxide acts as an accelerator<br>
activator and also as reinforcing agent fa latex<br>
2.4	Fillers	Desired level of inorganic salts to enhance<br>
stiffness and strength for" easy to handleu<br>
2.5	Alkali hydroxide        maintain alkalinity pH 8-9 to prevent<br>
coagulation when binder (latex ) is added<br>
2.6	Binder	Water soluble latex of NR- NBR to hdd<br>
together the pulp and filler<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Measuring accuracy	0.001mm<br>
Measuring period	300 seconds<br>
No. of measurement	10<br>
Record of measurement	Thickness change every<br>
30 seconds<br>
Important functional properties achieved<br>
-	Pressure Tightness      : The material developed has shown excellent<br>
Pressure tightness property as a sealant of fuel Injection pump at the critical joints upto a pressure of 1.5 bar under adverse assembly conditions.<br>
-	Torque properties     :    The specified ratio cf initial tightening torque<br>
to further tightening torque is minimum 0.45. The material developed has always exhibited a ratio higher than 0.7 In all trials with different and severe test conditions.<br>
-	Temperature resistance : The material possesses good temperature<br>
resistance between<br>
-	40DC and + 140DC without affecting the pressure tightness.<br>
-	Vibration resistance :     The material developed is able to function without any<br>
leakage under conditions of vibration specified for fuel ijection pump coupled with elevated temperature upto 100DC<br>
