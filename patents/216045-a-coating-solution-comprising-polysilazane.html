				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a coating solution capable of forming a coating<br>
excellent in characteristics such as corrosion resistance, anti-scratch properties,<br>
abrasion resistance, wetting properties to water, easy-to-clean properties, sealing<br>
properties, chemical resistance, oxidation resistance, physical barrier effect, heat<br>
resistance, fire resistance, antistatic properties and anti-fouling properties by<br>
applying it onto the surface of base materials such as metals, plastics, wood,<br>
ceramics, cement, mortar, bricks, clay, etc. of the bodies and wheels of<br>
automobiles, trains, airplanes, etc., dentures, tombstones, the interior and exterior<br>
of a house, products used with water in toilets, kitchens, washrooms, bathtubs,<br>
etc., signboards, signs, plastic products, and glass products.<br>
Background Art<br>
Conventionally, various measures are taken to prevent pollution of the surfaces of<br>
articles. For example, automobile bodies are easily fouled with dust, combustion<br>
products such as exhaust gas, or the like. Therefore the bodies are coated with<br>
wax to form a wax coating thus preventing pollution of the bodies. By rendering<br>
the surface of the body water-repellent, water upon contacting with the surface of<br>
the body forms drops of water to roll down the surface of the body, whereby fouling<br>
components in the water can be prevented from adhering and remaining on the<br>
surface of the body, while the wax coating makes adhesion of fouling components<br>
to the surface of the body difficult, and even if fouling components adhere to the<br>
surface, they can be easily washed away with water.<br>
Further, products used with water, such as bathtubs, kitchen sinks, washstands,<br>
etc. are contacted during use with various materials such as soap liquid containing<br>
oils and oily components, facial cleansing cream, hair shampoos, etc. in addition<br>
to water. At this time oily substances and calcium salts of soap (i.e. soap dregs)<br>
are considered to adhere to the surfaces of the products with dust etc. to form<br>
fouling. To prevent fouling on the product, a glazed surface constituting a glassy<br>
surface formed on the product is subjected sometimes to water repellency<br>
treatment with wax, a fluorine-containing material, etc. to prevent fouling from<br>
remaining on the glazed surface. By this water repellency treatment, it is also<br>
attempted to prevent adhesion of fouling to the interior and exterior of a house,<br>
toilet stools, products used with water, signboards, signs, tombstones, etc.<br>
On the other hand, the modification of the surface of a base material by coating<br>
the surface with a surfactant to render it hydrophilic has been known for a long<br>
time, and a further improvement in durability of this hydrophilicity by adding and<br>
incorporating a water-soluble organic polymer such as polyacrylic acid or polyvinyl<br>
alcohol into the surfactant is described in JP-A 52-101680 etc. Further, a method<br>
of applying and fixing a hydrophilic material such as cellulose, glycols and<br>
glycerine via a coating of a polyvinyl alcohol-vinyl acetate copolymer to the surface<br>
and inside of a porous film made of a hydrophobic polymer is known as described<br>
in JP-B 5-67330 etc.<br>
However, the water-repellent effect of water-repellency treatment with conventional<br>
water-repellant wax cannot be said to be satisfactory, or even if sufficient water-<br>
repellency treatment is initially conducted, the effect cannot be said to be long-<br>
lasting, thus failing to exhibit a long and sufficient anti-fouling effect. Further, the<br>
conventional hydrophilic coating confers hydrophilicity merely temporarily or in a<br>
short time, and therefore the sufficient durability of the hydrophilic effect can hardly<br>
be expected, and the water film on the hydrophilic coating is hardly rendered<br>
uniform, thus causing a transmission image or reflected image to be warped and<br>
making practical application thereof to the products problematic.<br>
Furthermore with respect to prevention of dentures from fouling and generating<br>
smell, fluorine treatment and the like have been examined, but cannot be said to<br>
achieve a sufficient effect for a long time by treating the dentures once.<br>
In addition, there is also demand for a coating solution capable of forming a<br>
coating excellent in characteristics such as corrosion resistance, anti-scratch<br>
properties, abrasion resistance, easy-to-clean properties, wetting properties to<br>
water, sealing properties, chemical resistance, oxidation resistance, physical<br>
barrier effect, low shrinkage, UV-barrier effect, smoothening effect, durability effect,<br>
heat resistance, fire resistance and antistatic properties, and there is strong<br>
demand for improvement particularly in corrosion resistance and anti-scratch<br>
properties.<br>
The present invention was made to solve the problems described above.<br>
Therefore an object of the present invention is to provide a coating solution which<br>
after application, can form a rigid and dense coating excellent in adhesion to a<br>
base material and which can form a coating excellent in corrosion resistance and<br>
anti-scratch properties and simultaneously excellent in characteristics such as<br>
long-lasting hydrophilic and anti-fouling effect, abrasion resistance, easy-to-clean<br>
properties, anti-scratch properties, corrosion resistance, sealing properties,<br>
chemical resistance, oxidation resistance, physical barrier effect, low shrinkage,<br>
UV-barrier effect, smoothening effect, durability effect, heat resistance, fire<br>
resistance and antistatic properties on the surfaces of various base materials.<br>
Thereby the surfaces of various products or articles such as automobile bodies,<br>
automobile wheels, dentures, tombstones, the interior and exterior of a house,<br>
products used with water in toilets, kitchens, washrooms, bathtubs, etc., toilet<br>
stools, signboards, signs, plastic products, glass products, ceramic products, wood<br>
products, etc., can be endowed with the above-described various effects including<br>
corrosion resistance and anti-scratch properties.<br>
The required characteristics of the coating solution, for example, the outward<br>
appearance such as uniform transparency after coating, drying characteristics,<br>
smell, safety, less damage to base materials, etc. are varied depending on base<br>
materials, setting conditions, and application modes of products or articles to be<br>
coated with the coating, solution and necessity for consideration of the surrounding<br>
environment upon application of the coating solution. Therefore, another object of<br>
the present invention is to provide a coating solution capable of easily preparing a<br>
suitable coating solution adapted to various applications.<br>

Preferred Mode of the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention is described in further detail.<br>
The coating solution of the present invention comprises a polysilazane haying a<br>
Si-H bond, a diluting solvent and a catalyst as essential components. The<br>
polysilazane having a Si-H bond used in the coating solution of the present<br>
invention includes the inorganic polysilazane soluble in a solvent and having<br>
repeating units represented by the general formula:<br>
The inorganic polysilazane having repeating units represented by the above<br>
general formula and soluble in a solvent, used in the present invention, may be<br>
any inorganic polysilazanes produced by a method known in the art.<br>
As the method of producing the inorganic polysilazane having repeating units<br>
represented by the above general formula and soluble in a solvent, any one of<br>
arbitrary methods including methods known in the art may be used as described<br>
above. One of the methods is, for example, a method of synthesizing an inorganic<br>
polysilazane by reacting a dihalosilane represented by the general formula SiH2X2<br>
(X is a halogen atom) with a base to form a dihalosilane adduct and then reacting<br>
the dihalosilane adduct with ammonia. The halosilane is generally acidic and can<br>
react with a base to form an adduct. Because the rate of formation and the stability<br>
of the adduct depend on the acidity of the halosilane and the basicity or steric<br>
factor of the basic substance, the type of halosilane and the type of base may be<br>
selected suitably to form a stable adduct capable of reacting with ammonia to<br>
produce an inorganic polysilazane easily. The stability of adduct in this case does<br>
not necessarily mean such stability as to be able to be isolated in the form of<br>
adduct, but means all possible cases where, for example, the adduct exists stably<br>
in a solvent and also functions substantially as a reaction intermediate.<br>
As the halosilane, a dihalosilane represented by the general formula SiH2X2<br>
(X = F, Cl, Br, or I) is preferably selected from the viewpoint of the handling and<br>
reactivity thereof, and particularly dichlorosilane is preferably selected from the<br>
viewpoint of the reactivity, the price of its starting material, etc.<br>
The base used for forming the adduct may be a base not causing other reactions<br>
than the reaction of forming an adduct with a halosilane, and preferable examples<br>
thereof include Lewis bases, tertiary amines (trialkylamines), pyridine, picoline and<br>
derivatives thereof, secondary amines having a sterically hindered group,<br>
phosphine, arsine and derivatives thereof (for example, trimethyl phosphine,<br>
dimethylethy! phosphine, methyldiethyl phosphine, trimethyl arsine, trimethyl<br>
stilbene, trimethylamine, triethylamine, thiophene, furan, dioxane, selenophene,<br>
etc.), among which pyridine and picoline are particularly preferable for handling<br>
and from an economical viewpoint. The amount of the base used is not<br>
particularly required to be strict, and the base may be present in excess over the<br>
stoichlometric ratio of the base (including an amine in an adduct) to the silane, that<br>
is, in excess over the ratio of amine : silane = 2:1. The reaction of forming an<br>
adduct is carried out in a solvent.<br>
In synthesis of the inorganic polysilazane via an adduct, the adduct is reacted with<br>
ammonia in an inert solution to form the inorganic polysilazane, wherein the<br>
amount of ammonia may be in excess over silane, and the reaction conditions are<br>
that the reaction temperature is usually -78°C to 100°C, preferably -40°C to 80°C,<br>
and the reaction time and reaction pressure are not particularly limited. The<br>
polymerization reaction of the inorganic polysilazane is carried out preferably in an<br>
inert gas atmosphere, and the inert gas is preferably nitrogen or argon gas.<br>
In the present invention, the inorganic polysilazane may be the one soluble in a<br>
solvent and having repeating units represented by the general formula above, but<br>
usually the one having a number-average molecular weight in the range of 600 to<br>
3000 is preferably used. Further, the inorganic polysilazane is used preferably in<br>
an amount of 0.1 to 35% by weight based on the total weight of the coating<br>
solution, preferably in an amount of 0.5 to 10 % by weight.<br>
Further, the organic polysilazane having a Si-H bond suitable as the polysilazane<br>
used in the present invention includes polysilazanes synthesized by reacting a<br>
dihalosilane (preferably dichlorosilane) and R1R2SiX2 (R1 and R2 represent a<br>
hydrogen atom or an alkyl group (preferably a methyl group) provided that R1 and<br>
R2 do not simultaneously represent a hydrogen atom; and X represents F, Cl, Br or<br>
I, preferably Cl) with a base to form their corresponding adducts and then reacting<br>
the adducts with ammonia. The base and reaction conditions for forming the<br>
adducts and the conditions for the reaction of the adducts with ammonia may be<br>
identical with those for production of the inorganic polysilazane described above.<br>
On the other hand, the catalyst used in the present invention may be any one<br>

preferably 0.1 to 10%, especially preferred 0.5 to 7 % based on a pure<br>
polysilazane content.<br>
The diluting solvent used in the coating solution of the invention may be any of<br>
diluting solvents capable of dissolving the polysilazane having a Si-H bond and the<br>
catalyst. In consideration of storage stability, the diluting solvent is preferably a<br>

coating solution is applied in such an amount as to form a coating of about 0.1 to 2<br>
microns in thickness after drying.<br>
By applying the coating solution of the invention, a dense coating can be formed<br>
on the surface of a product, and thus giving anti-corrosion, abrasion resistance,<br>
anti-fouling properties, easy-to-clean properties, wetting properties to the water,<br>
sealing effect, chemical resistance, anti-oxidation, physical barrier effect, heat<br>
resistance, fire resistance, low shrinkage, UV-barrier effect, smoothening effect,<br>
durability effect, antistatic properties and anti-scratch characteristics to the<br>
surfaces of the base materials of products or articles. The reason why the above-<br>
described characteristics can be given to the products and articles is that the<br>
polysilazane contained in the coating solution is converted into a dense silica<br>
coating by the action of the catalyst. Further, by the formation of silica coating, the<br>
surface of the products or articles shows strongly hydrophilic properties based on<br>
silica film. When dried at ordinary temperatures, the coating solution of the<br>
invention easily forms a rigid and dense coating made of silica. The formation of<br>
this silica coating is varied depending on the type of polysilazane, the type of<br>
catalyst, etc., but the coating will.be formed in a period of about 1 to 2 weeks. The<br>
coating solution of the invention is in a solution form at the time of application, and<br>
can thus be applied very easily to form a coating. The coating can be converted<br>
into a dense and rigid hydrophilic coating after application, thereby giving above-<br>
described properties onto the various surface of products and articles. The surface<br>
of the formed coating is so rigid and dense that it is excellent as a corrosion-<br>
resistant coating and anti-scratch coating and simultaneously the coating is<br>
excellent in abrasion resistance, anti-fouling effect and easy-to-clean properties<br>
when fouled. Further, the coating solution of the invention can be used not only as<br>
a corrosion-resistant coating, an anti-scratch coating, an abrasion-resistant<br>
coating, an anti-fouling coating or a coating excellent in easy-to-clean properties,<br>
but also as a film-forming coating solution for forming a hydrophilic coating, a<br>
sealing material, a chemical-resistant coating, an anti-oxidization coating, a<br>
physical barrier coating, a heat resistance-conferring coating, a fire-resistant<br>
coating, an antistatic coating, a low shrinkage coating, a UV-barrier coating, a<br>
smoothening coating, a durability coating etc.<br>
When the coating solution of the invention is used to form a hydrophilic and dense<br>
silica coating by using of the inorganic polysilazane on the surface of e.g. an<br>
automobile, a tombstone, the outer wall of a house, or the like, the resultant<br>
hydrophilic surface, upon contacting with rainwater, comes to be in the state of a<br>
watery coating without forming water drops thereon. In addition, the hydrophilic<br>
surface has higher affinity for water than for hydrophobic substances such as<br>
combustion products including dust etc., thus permitting these foul substances to<br>
be easily washed away with rain water. Further, the amount of smoke and dust<br>
adhering thereto can be reduced because of formation of the dense surface.<br>
Accordingly, visually noticeable fouling hardly occurs, and the amount of adhering<br>
fouling is reduced. And because of the dense coating formed, it is difficult to be<br>
scratched and is attained to prevent corrosion.<br>
In the case of dentures, acrylic resin as the material of dentures absorbs water<br>
with which foul substances enter the resin or foul substances adsorb or adhere<br>
onto the resin, and these foul substances is a source of the smell of dentures. As<br>
the coating solution of the invention forms a hydrophilic and dense silica coating<br>
adhering well to dentures at a temperature at which acrylic resin as the denature<br>
material is not deformed or deteriorated, the absorption of water into the resin can<br>
be prevented, thus preventing the invasion of foul substances into the denture<br>
material, and even if foul substances adhere to the silica coating, they can be<br>
easily washed away with water, and thus evolution of smell can be prevented.<br>
Further, dentures are coated with the coating solution of the invention, so that<br>
even if unevenness occurs on denatures in finish polishing, the silica coating<br>
makes this unevenness smooth to make adhesion of foul substances more<br>
difficult. Further, the formed silica coating has high surface hardness and high<br>
durability, and is thus not abraded with foods or upon biting, is stable in the living<br>
body, and is not eluted. Even if the silica is released, it is nontoxic.<br>
The required properties of the coating solution of the invention, for example,<br>
outward appearance, drying characteristics, smell, safety, damage to a base<br>
material, and storage stability of the coating solution, are varied a little bit<br>
depending on the use of a product to which the coating solution is applied. To cope<br>
therewith, the most suitable coating solution for intended use can be easily<br>
provided by changing not only the type and amount of the polysilazane and<br>
catalyst used but also the type of the solvent and the compounding ratio.<br>
For example, a heavy solvent such as mineral spirit is suitable as the solvent for<br>
readily noticeably fouled base materials whose outward appearance is regarded<br>
as important, such as an automobile coated in dark color, dentures, polished<br>
granite, a mirror-finish metal or plated substrate, transparent resin and glass.<br>
Mineral terpenes Pegasol AN45 and Pegasol 3040 from Mobil Sekiyu Corp. are<br>
also preferably usable solvents. By using mineral sprit as the solvent, base<br>
materials whose spots, interference colors, whiteness and grittiness are readily<br>
noticeable can be beautifully coated with the coating solution. Mineral spirit has<br>
the above-described advantage, but is relatively poor in the solubilizing power so<br>
that for compensating for the solubilizing power, mixed aromatic solvents such as<br>
Solvesso 100 and Solvesso 150 from Esso Sekiyu Co. and Pegasol R-100 and<br>
Pegasol R-150 from Mobil Sekiyu Corp. may be compounded in addition to<br>
mineral sprit. Further, paraffin type solvents free of aromatic components can also<br>
be used as the solvent. Specifically, low-odor solvents Exxol DSP100/140, Exxol<br>
D30, Exxol D40 etc. from Tonen Chemical Co. can be mentioned.<br>
Further, it is also important that products used with water, such as those in toilets,<br>
kitchens, washrooms, bathrooms, etc. and dentures are odorless. By adding a<br>
low-odor solvent such as methylcyclohexane or ethylcyclohexane if necessary as<br>
a part of the solvent, a coating solution with less smell can be provided for such<br>
products required to be odorless.<br>
The coating solution of the invention may be applied to a product and goods newly<br>
produced or to a product during use.<br>
Then, examples of compositions of the inorganic polysilazane, the catalyst and the<br>
diluting solvent in the coating solution intended for the respective uses are shown<br>
below. These are shown merely for illustrative purposes, and the composition and<br>
compounding ratio of the coating solution may be adapted to the use of a product<br>
coated therewith, and the composition and compounding ratio of the coating<br>
solution of the invention are not limited to those shown below.<br>
A. Automobile bodies, wheels<br>
The solution should not damage a coating sublayer and be stable such that<br>
particularly when the solution is applied by a cup gun, it is not whitened in the cup<br>
gun.<br>
B. Dentures<br>
The solution should be stable without whitening for a long time and safe to the<br>
human body with less smell without deforming or deteriorating acrylic resin as the<br>
denture material.<br>
C. Tombstones<br>
The solution should show less interference color when applied on granite or the<br>
like and be stable for a long time so as not to be whitened.<br>
D. The interior and exterior of a house, bathtubs, kitchens, etc.<br>
The solution should scarcely smell, be safe to the human body, and have a high<br>
drying characteristic.<br>

distillation of crude oil at normal pressures, are mainly C8 to C11 petroleum type<br>
hydrocarbons, and their aniline points are 43°C and 54°C respectively, and<br>
Pegasol AN45 contains aromatic components in a higher amount than in Pegasol<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention is described in more detail by reference to the<br>
Production Examples and the Examples, but the present invention is not limited to<br>
the Production Examples and the Examples described below.<br>
Production Example 1 (Production of the inorganic polysilazane)<br>
A gas inlet tube, a mechanical stirrer and a Dewar condenser were fit into a four-<br>
necked flask with an internal volume of 300 ml. The inside of the reactor was<br>
replaced by dry deoxygenated nitrogen, and then 150 ml of dry degassed pyridine<br>
was introduced into the four-necked flask and cooled on ice. Then, 16.1 g<br>
dichlorosilane was added thereto over 50 minutes, to form a white solid adduct<br>
(SiH2Cl22Py). The reaction mixture was cooled on ice under vigorous stirring and<br>
bubbled over 1 hour with a mixture of a nitrogen gas and 10.9 g ammonia<br>
previously purified by passage through a soda lime tube and an active carbon<br>
tube. After the reaction was finished, the solid product was removed by<br>
centrifugation and subsequent filtration. By removing the solvent from the filtrate<br>
under reduced pressure (50°C, 5 mmHg, 2 hours), 5.52 g glassy solid polysilazane<br>
was obtained. The molecular weight of the polysilazane determined by a vapor<br>
pressure depression method was 2000. The yield was 77%.<br>
Production Example 2 (Production of the organic polysilazane)<br>
A gas inlet tube, a mechanical stirrer and a Dewar condenser were fit into a four-<br>
necked flask with an internal volume of 300 ml. The inside of this reactor was<br>
replaced by dry deoxygenated nitrogen, and then 150 ml of dry degassed pyridine<br>
was introduced into the four-necked flask and cooled on ice. Then, 9.2 g methyl<br>
dichlorosilane and 8.1 g dichlorosilane were added thereto to form a white solid<br>
adduct. The reaction mixture was cooled on ice under vigorous stirring and<br>
bubbled with a mixture of a nitrogen gas and 12.0 g ammonia previously purified<br>
by passage through a soda lime tube and an active carbon tube. After the reaction<br>
was finished, the solid product was removed by centrifugation and subsequent<br>
filtration. By removing the solvent from the filtrate under reduced pressure (50°C,<br>
5 mmHg, 2 hours), 5.2 g viscous liquid polysilazane was obtained. The molecular<br>
weight determined by a vapor pressure depression method was 1,600. The yield<br>
was 72%.<br>
Example 1<br>
0.5 part by weight of the inorganic polysilazane obtained in Production Example 1<br>
and 0.02 part by weight of DMPP (catalyst) were dissolved in a solvent consisting<br>
of 1.98 parts by weight of xylene and 97.5 parts by weight of Pegasol AN45 (Mobil<br>
Sekiyu Corp.), to give an anti-fouling coating solution for automobile bodies and<br>
wheels.<br>
The coating solution was coated by spraying with a spray gun onto a coated steel<br>
plate in such an amount as to give a coating of 0.2 urn in thickness after<br>
conversion into silica. After drying, the coating was examined in an outdoor<br>
exposure test, and the change in contact angle was observed, to give the results in<br>
Table 1.<br>
As can be seen from Table 1, formation of a silica coating gradually proceeded,<br>
and 2 weeks later, a hydrophilic coating had been almost formed, and by this<br>
hydrophilic silica coating, the coated steel plate remained in a stably coated state<br>
for a long time. The coated steel plate, observed after 6 months and 1 year<br>
respectively, was not recognized to be fouled.<br>
This coating solution was sealed in a nitrogen atmosphere, stored at ordinary<br>
temperatures, and examined for generation of monosilane after 1 month, 3 months<br>
and 6 months respectively, and as a result, the amount of monosilane generated<br>
was 43 ppm after 1 month, 61 ppm after 3 months and 75 ppm after 6 months,<br>
indicating good storage stability.<br>
When the coating solution in Example 1 was placed in the cup of a spray gun and<br>
left for 30 minutes at ordinary temperatures in the air, the solution maintained its<br>
transparent state. Separately, a coating solution was prepared from the same<br>
composition described above except that Pegasol AN45 was replaced by Pegasol<br>
3040 (Mobil Sekiyu Corp.) having a lower aromatic content than in Pegasol AN45,<br>
and this coating solution turned turbid after 20 minutes. From this result, it was<br>
found that when an automobile anti-fouling coating solution having the composition<br>
described above is applied by a spray gun, a solvent containing aromatic<br>
components in a higher amount within a range not influencing a coating sublayer<br>
is preferably used in the coating solution from the viewpoint of stability of the<br>
coating solution.<br>
Example 2<br>
One part by weight of the inorganic polysilazane obtained in Production Example 1<br>
and 0.04 part by weight of DMPP (catalyst) were dissolved in a solvent consisting<br>
of 98.96 parts by weight of Pegasol AN45 (Mobil Sekiyu Corp.), to give an anti-<br>
fouling coating solution for dentures.<br>
This coating solution was applied by a spray gun onto the whole of dentures to<br>
form a silica coating of 0.3 µm in thickness thereon. The coating was converted<br>
completely into silica by drying it at 45°C for 60 minutes in an oven and<br>
subsequent treatment for 12 hours under the conditions of 40°C and 90% relative<br>
humidity in a high-temperature high-humidity apparatus. A hydrophilic and dense<br>
silica coating was formed on the surface of the dentures, and when the dentures<br>
were used, the coating was not deteriorated, and fouling could be easily washed<br>
away with water, and no smell was generated.<br>
Example 3<br>
One part by weight of the inorganic polysilazane obtained in Production Example 1<br>

of 11.46 parts by weight of xylene and 87.5 parts by weight of Pegasol 3040 (Mobil<br>
Sekiyu Corp.), to give an anti-fouling coating solution for tombstones.<br>
This coating solution was applied by aerosol spraying onto polished granite. A<br>
uniform coating of 0.4 µm in thickness was thereby formed. After 2 weeks, a<br>
hydrophilic and dense silica coating was formed on the surface, and when left<br>
outdoors for 1 year, the coating was not deteriorated, and no fouling was<br>
observed.<br>
Example 4<br>
0.5 part by weight of the inorganic polysilazane obtained in Production Example 1<br>
and 0.02 part by weight of DMPP (catalyst) were dissolved in a solvent consisting<br>
of 1.98 parts by weight of xylene, 32.5 parts by weight of Pegasol AN45 (Mobil<br>
Sekiyu Corp.), 32.5 parts by weight of ethylcyclohexane and 32.5 parts by weight<br>
of methylcyclohexane, to give an anti-fouling coating solution for coating of<br>
products used with water, such as bathtubs, washstands etc. This coating solution<br>
was applied onto the surfaces of a washstand made of ceramic ware and an<br>
enameled bathtub. A 0.2 µm uniform coating was formed respectively. Fouling<br>
hardly adhered, and if adhered, the fouling could be easily removed.<br>

Sekiyu Corp.), 31.7 parts by weight of ethylcyclohexane and 31.7 parts by weight<br>
of methylcyclohexane, to give an anti-fouling coating solution for the interior and<br>
exterior of a house. This coating solution was applied by rolling onto the surface of<br>
the outer wall of a house. The outer wall was not fouled for a long time. Fouling<br>
such as dust could be easily removed by spraying with water.<br>
Example 6<br>
Two parts by weight of the inorganic polysilazane obtained in Production Example<br>
1 and 0.08 part by weight of DMPP (catalyst) were dissolved in a solvent<br>
consisting of 7.92 parts by weight of xylene and 90 parts by weight of Pegasol<br>
3040 (Mobil Sekiyu Corp.), to give an anti-fouling coating solution for<br>
polycarbonate plates. Using a cloth impregnated with this coating solution, the<br>
coating solution was applied by hand onto a polycarbonate plate. A hydrophilic and<br>
dense silica coating could be formed on the surface without erosion of the<br>
substrate by the coating solution.<br>
Example 7<br>

150 (Esso Sekiyu Co.), to give a coating solution. An aluminum plate was coated<br>
by flow coating with this coating solution in an amount to give a coating of 0.3 µm<br>
in thickness after conversion into silica. After drying, the aluminum plate was<br>
calcinated at 120°C for 1 hour in the air to give a sample for a corrosion resistance<br>
test. Separately, a PET film was coated by flow coating with the coating solution in<br>
an amount to give a coating of 0.3 µm in thickness after conversion into silica.<br>

Effect of the Invention<br>
As described above, the coating solution of the present invention is in a liquid form<br>
at the time of application, and thus the coating solution can be easily applied by<br>
spray coating, a method of wiping with a cloth or sponge or the like onto the base<br>
material. After application, the polysilazane in a liquid form can be converted into<br>
a rigid and dense coating, thus easily forming a coating film excellent in anti-<br>
corrosion and anti-scratch properties. In addition, the hydrophilicity of the coating<br>
film thus formed is durable and its effective hydrophilicity can be maintained<br>
usually for 1 to 2 years. Besides the hydrophilicity, the coating can give such<br>
characteristics as abrasion resistance, anti-fouling properties, wetting properties to<br>
the water, anti-scratch properties, anti-corrosion properties, sealing effect,<br>
chemical resistance, anti-oxidation properties, physical barrier effect, heat<br>
resistance, fire resistance and antistatic properties to the products or the articles.<br>
Further, the coating solution can be applied in very wide uses by merely regulating<br>
the type of solvent, the amounts of compounding materials- etc.<br>
