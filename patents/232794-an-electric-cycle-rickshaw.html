				<td>This invention relates to an electric cycle rickshaw,, Particularly this invention relates to an i. m p r o v e d c y c 1 e r i c k s h aw „<br>
Manually driven cycle rickshaw  are as such  known in the art..  There are disadvantages associated with the manual cycle rickshaw as such known in the art.<br>
The main disadvantage is that driver has to put a lot of efforts to drive the cycle rickshaw.<br>
Another  disadvantage is that the brake  system  in the  conventional cycle rickshaw is merit only  for  front wheel but not for the rear wheels and  therefore  during the  sudden  application  of  the  brakes,,  the   cycle r i c k s h aw o v e rt u rns «<br>
Still  another  disadvantage  is  that  the  chain usually  slipps either from the free wheel or  from  the s p r o k e t.<br>
Therefore the main object of this invention is to provide an electric cycle rickshaw which can be driven manual 1y also.<br>
Another  object  of this invention is to  provide  an electric   cycle  rickshaw  which  allows  an   electric traction of the rickshaw,,<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide an electric cycle rickshaw which is efficient and the maintenance thereof is very easy.<br>
According to this invention there is provided an electric cycle rickshaw comprising a main chassis supported on a rear axle provided for supporting a pair of rear wheels, characterized in that, pedestals being provided between the chassis and said rear axle of the cycle rickshaw so as to provide spring action to said chassis, electric drive means being mounted on the said chassis for providing drive to the rear wheels of the rickshaw, brake means being mounted on the shaft of the -rear wheels to stop the cycle rickshaw and a speed control switch being provided at one side of the handle.<br>
Specifically in accordance with this invention electric drive means are mounted on the chassis of the cycle rickshaw for providing drive to the rear wheels of the rickshaw. Brake means are mounted on the shaft/axle of the wheels to stop the cycle rickshaw as and bearings are provided with the chassis of the cycle rickshaw to provide spring action to the chassis of the cycle rickshaw during riding. The drive system according to this invention comprises drive means provided in two parts. The first part consists of a<br>
sproket,  chain and pedals to provide a drive to a  gearbox provided for changing the speeds during riding  when<br>
the  rickshaw  is  driven  manually.   The?  second  part consists of a chain passing over the gears mounted on  a<br>
shaft spindle and the shaft of the rear wheels to  drive the rear wheels.  The electric drive means comprises  an<br>
electric  motor  provided for driving a  gear  reduction<br>
unit  adapted to drive rear wheels by means of a  chain.<br>
An   electric  cycle  rickshaw  according   to   a<br>
preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated<br>
in the accompanying drawings wherein :-<br>
Fig,, 1 shows the plan view of the cycle rickshaw.<br>
Pig. 2 shows the top view of the cycle rickshaw.<br>
Referring to the drawings particularly fig. 1  the<br>
cycle rickshaw has a chassis 1 supported on  the axle 2, The axle 2 is supported on the rear wheels 3 are mounted<br>
rotatably on the rear shaft of the rickshaw.  The  seats 4  made of cushion material is mounted on the back  side<br>
of the chassis 1.  The front wheel 5 is supported on the<br>
front  end  of  the rickshaws frame 6,  A  switch  7  is<br>
provided  on one side of the handle 8 of the  cycle  for controlling the electric: motor 9.  Led acid batteries  B are provided below the seat 4 to provide electric energy t o t h e e 1 e c t r i c  m o t o r 9 „<br>
The drive means as shown in fig. 2 comprises 1st and IInd part. The 1st part has a pedal chain 10 passing over an sproket 11 and speed gear 12 mounted on a spindle 13 provided to drive the rear wheel axle 2 through the IInd part comprising another pedal chain 14 passing around the free wheel and gear 15 and 16 mounted only shaft spindle .1.3 and rear wheel axle 2 respectively. These drive means are provided to drive the rickshaw manually and when the batteries of the rickshaw are discharged completely or in case of electric motor failure. The electric drive means as shown in fig. 2 comprises an electric motor 9 mounted on the chassis of the rickshaw for providing drive to a gear reduction unit 17 through a. belt 18. The gear reduction unit 17 rotates the rear wheel axle 2 through a back wheel chain drive 19. A pedestal 20 having a bearing (not shown) is provided for supporting the rear wheel axle 2 such that to provide a spring action to the chassis 1 of the rickshaw. Brake means 21 are mounted on the rear wheel axle 2 to stop<br>
the rickshaw as and when required.  A brake lever 22	is<br>
provided with the handle of the rickshaw to actuate	the<br>
break  means.  Speed control switch 23 are  provided	at.<br>
one  side  of  the handle to control the  speed  of	the<br>
rickshaw by operating the speed control means 12.<br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM;<br>
1.	An electric cycle rickshaw comprising a main chassis supported on a<br>
rear axle provided for supporting a pair of rear wheels, characterized<br>
in that, pedestals being provided between the chassis and said rear<br>
axle of the cycle rickshaw so as to provide spring action to said<br>
Chassis, electric drive means being mounted on the said chassis for<br>
providing drive to the rear wheels of the rickshaw, brake means being<br>
mounted on the shaft of the rear wheels to stop the cycle rickshaw<br>
and a speed control switch being provided at one side of the handle.<br>
2.	A rickshaw as claimed in claim 1 wherein said pedestal has a bearing<br>
provided therewith for the smooth rotation of the rear axle<br>
3.	A rickshaw as claimed in claim 1 wherein said electric drive means<br>
comprises an electric motor mounted on said chassis for rotating a<br>
gear reduction unit provided for rotating the rear axle with the help of<br>
a chain.<br>
4.	A rickshaw as claimed in claim 1 and 3 wherein said drive means<br>
comprises 1st and IInd part for rotating the rear axle of the rear<br>
wheels said 1st part has a pedal chain passing through the main<br>
sproket and a speed change gear mounted on a shaft spindle, said<br>
Ilnd part comprises another pedal chain passing through a free wheel<br>
and a gear mounted on said spindle and rear axle respectively.<br>
5.	A   rickshaw   as   claimed   in   claim   1   wherein   said   brake   means<br>
comprises brake drum mounted on the rear axle of the rear wheels, a<br>
