DOUBLE SPREAD-HEAD CAROUSEL WINDER<br>
The invention relates to a carousel winder having two winders that are carried in a rotatable rotor, that can be rotationally driven independent of one another, that are intended for successive continuous winding of metal strip, and that each have two spreadable heads that in turn each comprise a plurality of spreadable segments that are axially slidable on wedge surfaces, and in which the winders can be cycled between a coil transfer position and a starting position by rotation of the rotor.<br>
Such carousel winders have become known, e.g. from DE 198 36 159 [US 6,283,403].  They have cantilevered winder mandrels so that a weight limit for the coil to be carried or wound results from the one-ended mounting.  If heavy coils are to be wound, the winder mandrel and the rotor must be made with the necessary strength.<br>
Also known in carousel winders is winding the strip on an end-supported mandrel.  The rotor is then pivoted from the starting winding position to the finish winding position.  In this finish winding position an outer bearing is pivoted such that the outer end of the mandrel is supported.  Heavy coils can then be wound in this position.  But because of the high strip tension the winder mandrel rapidly is stressed to its limit when it has just been rotated into the finished position.  The limit for the loads are rapidly attained even when the strip is removed from the winder mandrel that is no longer supported.  In addition, there is the complex construction for pivoting the outer bearing.<br>
-v<br><br>
The basic object of the invention is to provide a carousel winder such that no pivotal outer bearing is needed, such that the coil or the coil to be wound is always bilaterally supported in each position, and such that the carousel winder can be used both for winding and unwinding coils.<br>
To this end it is suggested that the rotor comprises two mutually opposing rotor disks that are joined to one another by at least one tubular beam and that the rotor carries at least two double spreadable head winders.  When positioned together, the two spreadable heads that belong to one double head winder form a winding drum that provides continuous bilateral support for the strip, i.e. the strip has bilateral support even when the rotor is turning.  There is no weight or strip tensile limit for the coil that results from being supported at only one end.<br>
It is worth noting that the rotor disks are also joined to one another by at least two guides.<br>
It is advantageous when the winders for each double spreadable head winder are carried by mutually opposing mandrel holders and face one another and that the mandrel holders for each double spreadable head winder are supported on the guides and/or the tubular beam such that they can be displaced toward one another and away from one another.  Because of this, when positioned together, the two spreadable heads that belong to one double spreadable head winder are used to start winding, to wind up strip, and to unwind strip, even strip that has different widths.  The coil can be removed when the spreadable heads are moved apart from each other.<br>
y<br><br>
It is important that at least one rotationally driven spline shaft is carried in the tubular beam and that the mandrel holders have drive elements that are mechanically linked to the spline shaft and that are also mechanically linked to the spreadable heads of the double spreadable head winder.<br>
It has proven advantageous for the spline shaft to be divided longitudinally into two parts.  The spline shafts can thus be rotationally driven by two different drives.<br>
It is significant that the tubular beam is slotted and the mechanical link for the drive elements and the spline shafts extends through the slot.<br>
it is advantageous that the rotor disks are carried on tensioning rollers and at least one of the rotor disks is rotationally driven about the axis of the tubular beam and the spline shafts.  Thus the mandrel holders can be pivoted e.g. from a starting winding position to a finish winding position.<br>
It is recommended that the tubular beam have approximately in the center at least one abutment for the mandrel holders and that piston cylinder units be arranged between the abutments and the mandrel holders in order to displace and position the mandrel holders axially.<br>
It is advantageous that two abutments are provided, each abutment carrying one of the two bearings for the two-part spline shaft.<br>
In addition, latch elements that keep the abutments in position can be provided.<br>
It is useful that the spline shafts and/or the rotor disks have separate drives.  The drives can preferably be matched<br>
U<br><br>
to one another in terms of their action, e.g. can be synchronized to one another.<br>
The invention is described in greater detail with reference to the drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a front elevation of the inventive carousel winder; and<br>
FIG. 2 is a side elevation of the inventive carousel winder.<br>
The figures depict a carousel winder 1 that has two rotor disks 2 and 2■ that are joined to one another by a tubular beam 3 and by two guides 4 and 4'.<br>
The guides 4 and 4' carry pairs of mandrel holders 5, 5', 6, and 6' such that they can be moved toward and away from one another.  The mandrel holders 5 and 6 have spreadable heads 7 and 7' and 8 and 8' of winders.<br>
A two-part spline shaft 9 and 9' extends inside the tubular beam 3.  The free ends of the spline shafts 9 and 9' that are rotationally driven via drives 10 and 10' are held in bearings provided in abutments 11 and 11'.  Piston cylinder units 12 and 12'; 13 and 13' are arranged between the abutments 11 and 11' and the mandrel holders 5 and 5'; 6 and 6'.  The rotor disk 2' can be rotated by a drive 14.<br><br>
