				<td>PROCESS FOR PREPARING COMBINATION PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS USING SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS [0001]      This patent application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/435,054, filed December 19,2002.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]       This invention pertains to a process for combining two or more active pharmaceutical ingredients including, for example, anti-infective and anticancer agents, using a supercritical fluid to obtain a blended, dry powder pharmaceutical formulation:<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]      Pharmaceuticals containing a combination of two or mbre active pharmaceutical ingredients, especially anti-infective agents, are commercially available in a dry powder form. Anti-infective agents as well as many other active agents are not stable for extended periods of time in an aqueous solution which requires the preparation of such actives as a solid powder.<br>
[0004]       Combination anti-infectives are typically produced by milling of the active agents and excipients and blending the dry solid components to form the finished drug product. However, the use of milling and blending techniques has several significant limitations. Most significantly, the mechanical equipment used to accomplish the milling and blending operations is in direct contact with the drug product components which can result in contamination from pyrogens and/or particular matter. Such contaminants compromise the sterility required for pharmaceutical products that are administered parenterally. Other drawbacks include, for example, the need for specialized ventilation equipment to collect dust produced during milling, the difficulty in obtaining blend uniformity, and the degradation of the active ingredients and excipients caused by high shear milling. Moreover, the potential segregation of the components of the blended powder during its transfer from blender to the filling line and during vial filling may eventually lead to content non-uniformity in the final blended drug product. [0005]      An alternative to the use of traditional milling and blending procedures to produce combination drug products is spray drying. The spray drying process involves the dissolution of active agents in a suitable cosolvent (which may be a single solvent or two or more solvents combined together) followed by spraying of the solution in a heated chamber. However, spray drying has several significant limitations. Stability issues exist with the solution or dispersion of the active agents formed before spraying, In addition, the high<br><br>
temperatures used during the process can cause degradation of the drugs. Spray drying also<br>
gives low yields of the final product and often requires the use of a secondary drying step to<br>
ensure removal of cosolvent from the powder.<br>
[0006]       Thus, there remains a need for an efficient process for producing sterile<br>
combination pharmaceutical drug products in a powder form that exhibit good blend<br>
uniformity.<br>
[0007]       The invention provides such a process for preparing sterile pharmaceutical<br>
formulations in a dry powder form that contain two or more active pharmaceutical<br>
ingredients in a homogenous blend. These and other advantages of the invention, as well as<br>
additional inventive features, will be apparent from the description of the invention<br>
provided herein.	•<br>

[0057]      Conventional processes using supercritical fluids for producing pharmaceutical particles may be used. Examples of preferred supercritical processing techniques for recrystallizing Pharmaceuticals include Rapid Expansion from Supercritical Solutions (RESS), Supercritical Anti-Solvent (SAS), and Gas Antisolvent (GAS). Another example of a suitable process for use in the present invention is the Supercritical Antisolvent Precipitation with Enhanced Mass Transfer (SAS-EM) technique.<br><br>
[0058]       Further techniques suitable for preparing combination pharmaceutical formulations include U.S. Patent 6,620,351, U.S. Patent 5,707,634, U.S. Patent 5,360,478, U.S. Patent 5,043,280, U.S. Patent 4,582,731, European Patent EP 0 542 314 and Larson, K.A., Biotechnol. Prog., 2:73-82 (1986).<br>
[0059]      These supercritical fluid processes involve the use of a solvent, also referred to as a solvent, in preparing the pharmaceutical combinations. Examples of solvents useful in the processes of the present invention include, without limitation, the following: water, hydrocarbons, including aliphatic alkanes such as hexane, heptane, decalin, octane, etc., cyclic alkanes such as cyclohexane, and aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, cumene, pyridine, pseudocumene, cymene, styrene, toluene, xylenes, tetrahydronaphthalene and mesitylene; halogenated compounds such as carbon tetrachloride and chlorinated, fluorinated and brominated hydrocarbons such as chloroform, bromoform, methyl chloroform, chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, chloroethane, 1,1-dichloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, tetrachloroethane, epichlorohydrin, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene; ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, diisoburyl ether, diglyme, 1,4-dioxane, 1,3-dioxolane, dimethoxymethane, furan and tetrahydrofuran; aldehydes such as methyl formate, ethyl formate and furfural; ketones such as acetone, diisoburyl ketone, cyclohexanone, methyl ethyl ketone, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and isophorone; amides such as dimethyl formamide and dimethyl acetamide; alcohols such as ethanol, isopropanol, n-propanol, t-butyl alcohol, cyclohexanol, 1-hexanol, 1-octanol and trifluoroethanol; polyhydric alcohols such as 1,3-propanediol, glycerol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and low molecular weight (typically less than 400) polyethylene glycol; amines, including cyclic amines such as pyridine, piperidine, 2-methylpyridine, morpholine, etc., and mono-, di- and tri-substituted amines such as trimethylamine, dimethylamine, methylamine, triethylamine, diethylamine, ethylamine, n-butylamine, t-butylamine, triethanolamine, diethanolamine and ethanolamine, and amine-substituted hydrocarbons such as ethylene diamine, diethylene triamine; carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid and formic acid; esters such as ethyl acetate, isopentyl acetate, propylacetate, etc.; lactams such as caprolactam; nirriles,such as acetonitrile, propane nitrile and adiponitrile; organic nitrates such as nitrobenzene, nitroethane and nitromethane; and sulfides such as carbon disulfide.<br>
[0060]      The solvent may optionally be a lipidic material including, but not limited to, the following: phospholipids such as phosphorylated diacyl glycerides, and particularly phospholipids selected from the group consisting of diacyl phosphatidylcholines, diacyl phosphatidylethanolamines, diacyl phosphatidylserines, diacyl phosphatidylinositols, diacyl phosphatidylglycerols, diacyl phosphatidic acids, and mixtures thereof, wherein each acyl group contains about 10 to about 22 carbon atoms and is saturated or unsaturated; fatty<br><br>
acids such as isovaleric acid, valeric acid, caproic acid, enanthic acid, caprylic acid, pelargonic acid, capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, behenic acid, lignoceric acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid; lower fatty acid esters comprising esters of the foregoing fatty acids, wherein the carboxylic acid group of the fatty acid is replaced with an ester moiety --(CO)—OR wherein R is a Ci_3 alkyl moiety optionally substituted with one or two hydroxyl groups; fatty alcohols corresponding to the aforementioned fatty acids, wherein the carboxylic acid group of the fatty acid is replaced by a -CHjOH group; glycolipids such as cerebroside and gangliosides; oils, including animal oils such as cod liver oil and, menhaden oil, and vegetable oils such as babassu oil, castor oil, corn oil, cotton seed oil, linseed oil, mustard oil, olive oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, peanut oil, poppyseed oil, rapeseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, sunflower seed oil, tung oil or wheat germ oil; and waxes, i.e., higher fatty acid esters, including animal waxes such as beeswax and shellac, mineral waxes such as montan, petroleum waxes such as microcrystalline wax and paraffin, and vegetable waxes such as carnauba wax.<br>
[0061]       In the RESS process, the two or more active pharmaceutical ingredients are dissolved in a supercritical fluid, preferably carbon dioxide, to form a homogenous solution. Other excipients may optionally be added to the supercritical fluid. The active agents and optional excipients may be added to the supercritical fluid simultaneously or other suitable order. The resulting solution is then passed through an orifice or nozzle into a chamber. Preferably, the pressure in the chamber is atmospheric. By spraying the homogenous solution through an orifice or nozzle, the solution is depressurized rapidly resulting in the vaporization of the carbon dioxide or other supercritical fluid. The active agents and optional excipients are recrystallized as a uniform mixture in dry powder form. [0062]      RESS can be used if the active pharmaceutical ingredients to be precipitated are soluble in the supercritical fluid, such as supercritical carbon dioxide. If the active agents are not readily soluble in the supercritical fluid, the active agents may be first dissolved in a cosolvent system and then added to the supercritical fluid. The cosolvent may be a single solvent or two or more solvents combined together. Alternatively, the cosolvent may be added to the supercritical fluid initially followed by the addition of the active agents to the mixture of the supercritical fluid and cosolvent. When a cosolvent is required, the cosolvent used generally has a higher dielectric constant than the supercritical fluid (e.g., supercritical carbon dioxide), but is miscible hi the supercritical fluid.<br>
[0063]      Examples of suitable solvents and cosolvents include acetone, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, tetrahydrorfuran, methylene chloride, chloroform, toluene, dimethylsufloxide, N^N-dimethylformamide, cyclohexanone, butrylactone, water, and<br><br>
combinations thereof. Other suitable solvents include those compounds known in the art in which the active pharmaceutical ingredients to be blended can be dissolved. [0064]      A typical flow diagram of a RESS process for recrystallization using carbon dioxide as the supercritical fluid is shown in FIG 1. The RESS apparatus 100 generally includes an extraction unit 102 and precipitation unit 104. Carbon dioxide is transferred from storage tank 106 to high-pressure vessel 108, optionally using pump 110. The temperature and pressure in high-pressure vessel 108 are maintained such that the carbon dioxide exists in a supercritical state. The active pharmaceutical ingredients are then added to high-pressure vessel 108 to form a homogenous solution of the carbon dioxide in which the active agents are dissolved. Alternatively, the active pharmaceutical ingredients may be added to the high-pressure vessel 108 initially followed by the addition of supercritical carbon dioxide to form a homogeneous solution. The homogenous solution is sprayed through nozzle 112 into vessel 114, preferably under atmospheric pressure conditions. Alternatively, pressures greater than atmospheric pressure may be used. The supercritical carbon dioxide is vaporized and the active agents precipitate from the solution in the form of a dry powder. The carbon dioxide may either be collected for possible reuse or discarded. The solid precipitate is collected from vessel 114 for further processing. [0065]      The upstream and downstream temperatures and pressures in the RESS process may be modified to obtain the desired morphology of the precipitated drug product. In addition, the shape of the nozzle employed may be altered to transition between fibers and particles. A smaller length-to-nozzle diameter ratio (L/D) typically results in the formation ofparticles.<br>
[0066]      Another suitable process for recrystallization according to the present invention is the SAS process. The SAS technique is well-suited for precipitation of active agents that are only slightly soluble in the supercritical fluid of interest, such as supercritical carbon dioxide.<br>
[0067]      In the SAS process, the active pharmaceutical ingredients and optional excipients are dissolved in a solvent. The solvent may be any suitable liquid containing one or more solvents in which the active agents are dissolved. The solvent is also miscible in the supercritical fluid. Examples of solvents suitable for use in the SAS method include those solvents discussed herein that may be used in the RESS process as cosolvents as well as other solvents in which the active agents can be dissolved.<br>
[0068]      The solution containing the active agents is then contacted with a supercritical fluid (e.g., supercritical carbon dioxide). Preferably, mixing is carried out by spraying the solution through a nozzle into a chamber filled with the supercritical fluid. The supercritical fluid acts as an anti-solvent to extract out the cosolvent The active agents and optional excipients form a precipitate upon contact with the supercritical fluid which is recovered.<br><br>
The precipitate from the S AS process is a uniformly mixed dry powder containing the active pharmaceutical ingredients and any optional excipients.<br>
[0069]      The supercritical fluid may optionally be contacted one or more cosolvents prior to the addition of the solution containing the active agents.<br>
[0070]      A typical flow diagram of a SAS process for recrystallization using supercritical carbon dioxide is shown in FIG. 2. In the SAS apparatus 200, the active pharmaceutical ingredients are dissolved in a solvent system in vessel 214. Excipients may optionally be dissolved in a solvent along with the active agents. Carbon dioxide is transferred from vessel 202 to high-pressure vessel 204, optionally using pump 206, wherein carbon dioxide is maintained in a supercritical state. The solvent solution containing the active agents is transferred from vessel 214, optionally using pump 208, and sprayed through nozzle 210 into high-pressure.vessel 204- The precipitate containing a powder blend of active agents is recovered from high-pressure vessel 204 for further processing. The resulting mixture of the solvents and supercritical carbon dioxide is then transferred to low-pressure tank 212 for recovery of the solvent and carbon dioxide and reuse of these process streams. [0071]      In the GAS process, supercritical carbon dioxide is added to a solution of the desired active pharmaceutical ingredients dissolved in an organic cosolvent. The supercritical carbon dioxide and organic solvent are miscible whereas the solid active agents have limited solubility in carbon dioxide. Thus, the carbon dioxide acts as an antisolvent to precipitate solid crystals of the active agents.<br>
[0072]      A typical flow diagram of a GAS process for recrystallization using supercritical carbon dioxide is shown in FIG. 3. In the GAS apparatus 300, the active pharmaceutical ingredients are dissolved in a solvent in vessel 302. Excipients may optionally be dissolved in the solvent along with the active agents. The solution in which the active agents are dissolved is transferred to a vessel 304 in the precipitator 306 using pump 308. Carbon dioxide stored in a supercritical state in vessel 310 is rapidly transferred to vessel 304 using pump 312. Alternatively, carbon dioxide may be stored as either a gas or liquid well below its critical temperature and critical pressure and then rendered supercritical before combining the carbon dioxide with the dissolved active agents. Upon contact with the supercritical carbon dioxide, the dissolved active agents in the solution 312 in vessel 304 are crystallized as particles 314 containing a blend of the active agents and optional excipients. The particles are recovered for further processing to yield a suitable pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
[0073]      The supercritical fluid may optionally be contacted with one or more solvents prior to the addition of the solution containing the active agents.<br><br>
[0074]       Other suitable processes known to those persons of ordinary skill in the art that involve a supercritical fluid, preferably supercritical carbon dioxide, may be used to recrystallize combinations of active pharmaceutical ingredients in a dry powder form. [0075]       The uniform blend of active pharmaceutical agents recrystallized using a supercritical fluid according to the process of the present invention is a powder, also referred to herein as a dry powder. The precipitated powder typically contains about 10% or less (by weight) of the solvent in which the active agents are dissolved prior to crystallization. Preferably, the dry powder contains 5% or less solvent (by weight) and, most preferably, 2% or less (by weight) solvent.<br>
[0076]      The pharmaceutical formulations produced according to the present invention may optionally contain pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as, for example, carriers, additives, and diluents. Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration may contain, for example, alkylene glycols such as propylene glycol, polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol, oils of vegetable origin, hydrogenated naphthalenes, acid or basic buffers, and the like.<br>
[0077]       Other examples of suitable excipients for pharmaceutical dosage forms prepared by the present invention include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, sterile water, syrup, and methyl cellulose. Pharmaceutical formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents.<br>
[0078]      The pharmaceutical active ingredients used in the present invention may be premixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients before the active agents are contacted with a supercritical fluid according to the inventive processes. Vhen premixed with the active agents, the excipients must be compatible with the cosolvent systems and supercritical fluids that are employed.<br>
[0079]      Alternatively, a uniform blend of two or more active pharmaceutical ingredients obtained by recrystallization using a supercritical fluid may be contacted with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients to produce a pharmaceutical formulation. [0080]       The following examples further illustrate the invention but, of course, should not be construed as in any way limiting its scope.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0081]       The examples demonstrate the process for producing pharmaceutical formulations using a supercritical fluid according to the present invention. Examples 1-11<br><br>
describe pharmaceutical formulations containing sodium sulbactam and sodium ampicillin. Examples 12-21 describe pharmaceutical formulations containing etoposide and paclitaxel. The samples of Examples 1-21 are prepared by one of the following three processes. [0082]      Process 1<br>
[0083]       The flow diagram for process 1 is shown in FIG. 4. In apparatus 400, the active pharmaceutical ingredients are dissolved in a cosolvent to form a drug solution 402 in vessel 404. After closing vessel 404, antisolvent from vessel 406 is slowly added to the drug solution 402 in vessel 404. The antisolvent may optionally be pumped to vessel 404 using pump 408. The temperature of the antisolvent may optionally be adjusted with cooler 410 and/or heater 412. Temperature is steadily maintained during the antisolvent addition to the drug solution 402, for example by thermocouple 414. Due to the antisolvent addition, pressure in vessel 404 rises steadily. The antisolvent addition rate may also be monitored by recording the rate of increase of pressure in vessel 402 using pressure monitor 416. Antisolvent diffuses into the drug solution 402 while the cosolvent diffuses into the antisolvent, resulting in the precipitation of the active agents as a powder. A magnetic stirrer 418 is employed to obtain uniform mixing in vessel 404. After the pressure reaches a desired value, a pressure control valve 420 in the outlet line is opened to control the pressure in vessel 402. The antisolvent may optionally be filtered through filter 422. Antisolvent flow rate from vessel 404 is maintained constant for a period of time to remove any residual cosolvent present in the precipitated powder.<br>
[0084]       Preferably, the temperature of vessel 404 is maintained at a temperature appropriate to avoid substance degradation, if any. Additional stabilizing agents may be added to maintain pH of the solution in case of aqueous solutions. Further substances may be added to protect any substance degradation caused during the solution preparation or processing. [0085]       Process 2<br>
[0086]       The flow diagram for process 2 is shown in FIG. 5. In apparatus 500, the active pharmaceutical ingredients are dissolved in a cosolvent in the solution feed vessel 502 and stirred, making a uniform solution. A flow of antisolvent contained in vessel 504 (e.g., CC&gt;2 cylinder) is maintained at a desired temperature and pressure using antisolvent pump 506 to the particle production vessel 508. The antisolvent flow is monitored with flow meter 510. Optionally, the antisolvent may be cooled by heat exchanger 512 or heated by heat exchanger 514 prior to contact with the drug solution. The solution is dispersed using solution pump 516 into vessel 508 as a fine stream through a capillary nozzle. The antisolvent effect precipitates the substance combination as a powder. Powder is then filtered and the antisolvent/cosolvent mixture is allowed to exit vessel 508. The antisolvent/cosolvent mixture is further separated in solvent collection vessel 518 and may<br><br>
be recycled. The particle production vessel 508 may optionally be jacketed to permit contact with a cooling or heating coil to maintain the desired temperature in vessel 508. [0087]       Process 3<br>
[0088]       The flow diagram for process 3 is shown in FJG 6. In apparatus 600, the active pharmaceutical ingredients are dissolved in a cosolvent in the solution feed vessel 602 and stirred making it a uniform solution. Antisolvent is contained in vessel 604 which may optionally be a COj cylinder. The flow of antisolvent is maintained at a desired temperature and pressure from vessel 604 using pump 606 into the particle production vessel 608. The antisolvent flow is monitored with flow meter 610. Optionally, the antisolvent may be cooled by heat exchanger 612 or heated by heat exchanger 614 prior to contact with the drug solution. A solid surface 616 is vibrated at a desired frequency. The drug solution from vessel 602 is applied using solution pump 618 onto the vibrating surface 616 which results in uniform atomization. Antisolvent effect precipitates the substance combination as a powder. The powder is filtered using a stainless steel filter 620 and the antisolvent/solvent mixture is allowed to exit vessel 608 into the solvent collection vessel 622 and may be recycled. The particle production vessel 608 may optionally be jacketed to permit contact with a cooling or heating coil to maintain the temperature in vessel 608. [0089]      Examples 1-11 demonstrate the process for producing pharmaceutical formulations containing sodium sulbactam and sodium ampicillin using a supercritical fluid according to the present invention. For each of Examples 1-11, the ratio of sodium sulbactam to sodium ampicillin used was 1:2.<br>

[00114]     The samples produced by Examples 12-21 were tested for chemical integrity (using HPLC) and physical characteristics (using XRPD, DSC, TGA, SEM, NMR and IR).

[00119]     The sample of Example 12 shows the closest similarity to the individual components when mixed together in a homogeneous blend. Example 12 provided the maximum recovery (based on HPLC data), appears to be a uniform blend of individual drugs (per SEM), and provides the closest IR spectra to the individual drugs. XRPD, DSC and NMR data also demonstrate that the sample of Example 12 is a homogenous, uniform blend of the individual etoposide and paclitaxel components.<br>
