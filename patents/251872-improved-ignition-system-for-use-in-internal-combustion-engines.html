3-	IMPROVED IGNTTIQN SYSTEM FOR USE IN INTERNAL COMBUSTION<br>
ENGINES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
(0001)	This invention, in general, relates to Ignition Systems for use in Internal<br>
Combustion Engines. More particularly, the present invention relates to an Improved<br>
Capacitive Discharge Ignition System for use in Internal Combustion Engines.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
(2)	Ignition systems for use in internal combustion engines are known. Ignition systems are employed to ignite the air-fuel mixture in combustion engines resulting in the initiation of the combustion process. In the known arts, electric spark is produced in Internal Combustion Engines using high voltage transformers. In the Point Based Ignition Systems, a high voltage transformer having a primary winding and a secondary winding is used wherein the current passing through the primary of the high voltage transformer is interrupted using a circuit breaker. This sudden interruption in the current induces very high voltage in the secondary winding. The secondary winding, which is connected to an engine's spark plug, feeds the spark plug to cause electric sparks.<br>
(3)	Conventional Point based Coil Ignition Systems and Capacitive Discharge Ignition Systems use a single energy source to create the spark and sustain the arc. Capacitive Discharge Ignition Systems use a high voltage transformer to produce a spark. To increase the energy level at the spark gap, dual energy systems have been devised.<br>
(4)	In Dual Energy Ignition Systems, first the spark is produced at the spark gap using either a Point Based System or a Capacitive Discharge Ignition System through a high voltage transformer. A low voltage secondary energy source is used to boost the available energy at the spark gap. Once the high voltage source initiates the spark, the low voltage source applies power to the spark gap. The high voltage helps producing the spark while the low voltage itself sustains the arc. A number of configurations have been devised in applying the low voltage source energy to the spark gap.<br><br>
(5)	In the known configurations, the electric current passing through the primary of the high voltage transformer is interrupted using a mechanical circuit breaker. This sudden interruption of the electric current induces high voltage in the secondary of the transformer. This high voltage is applied to the spark. The duration of the spark is normally about 1 millisecond and the energy delivered at the spark plug is approximately 10 to 30 milli joules.<br>
(6)	In the Capacitive Discharge Ignition Systems, a high voltage transformer is used to produce a spark. However, in the primary winding of the transformer, a charged capacitor is discharged using a thyristor. This discharge in the primary winding produces high voltage in the secondary winding. This high voltage is applied to the spark plug to produce the required spark. In this case the duration of the spark is only about 0.1 mille second levels and the total energy delivered at the spark is about 30 milli joules. However, the Capacitive Discharge Ignition Systems are not able to increase the energy level at the spark plug.<br>
(7)	In the known Dual Energy Systems first the spark is produced at the spark gap using either the point based system or the Capacitive Discharge Ignition System through a high voltage transformer by producing high voltage of about 20-30 kilo volt. Then to boost the available energy at the spark gap, a low voltage secondary source is used. This low voltage source applies power to the spark gap, once the above mentioned high source initiates the spark. This is because the initial high voltage is needed only to produce the spark and not to sustain it. A low voltage is sufficient to sustain it. In the Dual Energy System, the initial arc is produced by a high voltage source and after that, using a low voltage source, high energy is supplied to the arc. The method of applying the low voltage source energy to the spark gap is performed in many ways.<br>
(8)	In the known configurations of Capacitive Discharge Ignition Systems, the primary to the secondary ratio is maintained as 1:100. Because of this large step up voltage at the secondary, the reflected impedance seen at the primary is very low. Therefore, in conventional systems, the capacitor discharges quickly and consequently the spark duration is low.<br>
(9)	The above issues have been addressed by various prior art configurations in this field.  In  the  known  systems,  low  voltage charged capacitors  were either directly<br><br>
discharged through inductor or resistor. However no prior art configurations have used the conventional Capacitive Discharge Ignition System for AuxiHary Energy Supply System.<br>
(10)	The present invention addresses the above issues by configuring an Improved Ignition System, which provides the energy available for the auxiliary discharge only for a particular period. After this period, energy is not available for the spark gap. This greatly reduces the chances of unintentional discharge at the spark gap.<br>
(11)	The basic methodology of working and the configuration of Automobile Ignition systems can be seen at http://www.howstuffworks.com/ignition-system. An article authored by Mr. Jurgen Stiftschraube titled "Plasma Potential" published in Racecar Vol. 10; No.l discloses the advancements regarding the ignition to the internal combustion engines.<br>
(12)	United States Patent Numbered 4,301,782 titled 'Ignition System' to Wainwright discloses an Ignition System of an Internal Combustion Engine. This invention discloses the initiation of the spark by means of the conventional capacitive discharge system and the high voltage transformer. To sustain the spark, a secondary low voltage source of approximately 2000 volt has been used. This low voltage source is obtained using a DC/DC converter. In one method this low voltage source is connected to the spark plug through the high voltage transformer and in an alternate method it is connected to the spark plug through an inductor. This low voltage source is not capable of initiating the spark but it sustains the arc by providing the additional energy once the spark plug is ignited by the high voltage source. The low voltage source continuously delivers power and it goes off automatically once the pressure in the ignition chamber goes up due to combustion. Alternatively, the low voltage source also can be switched off using a separate additional switch.<br>
(13)	The Great Britain Patent No. GB 1,427, 600 titled 'Ignition System' to Hitachi Ltd. discloses an induction type secondary energy source. This patent discloses applying a fast rising high voltage to the spark plug employing the conventional capacitive discharge system. This fast rising high voltage source initiates the spark. At the same time, using an auxiliary low voltage transistor circuit, the stored energy in the inductor is delivered to the same spark plug to maintain the already ignited spark. This inductor delivers more current at low voltage for about 4 milli second.<br><br>
(14)	United States Patent No.4, 506,650-titled 'Ignition System for Internal Combustion Engines' by Shimojo et al. discloses an ignition system for generating spark in an internal combustion engine. This system uses conventional ignition system with the modified high voltage transformer. In this system for the conventional high voltage transformer an extra low voltage winding is added. The usual high voltage winding of the high voltage transformer is connected to the spark plug and it produces spark in a normal way. However the additional winding in the high voltage transformer is connected to the same spark plug through a diode and a resistor. Because of this arrangement an additional amount of energy is delivered to the already ignited spark. This arrangement provides additional   energy to the spark. The duration of the spark is also greatly increased.<br>
(15)	United States Patent No.5, 197,448-titled 'Dual Energy Ignition System' to Porrcea et al. discloses the use of two energy sources at the spark gap. In this system using the capacitive discharge system high voltage is generated in the secondary of the high voltage transformer. This high voltage secondary is connected to the spark plug in series with the low voltage power source. Once the high voltage source ignites the spark plug, the low voltage source automatically delivers power to the spark gap. To deliver the high power, the energy from the low voltage source is delivered to the spark plug by bye passing the high voltage transformer's secondary using a diode.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
(0032)	Fig.l illustrates a circuit diagram in the context of the present invention .A<br>
power source 100 is connected on one end to a high voltage transformer primary 110. The<br>
other end of high voltage transformer primary 110 is connected to a mechanical circuit<br>
breaker, 130. The high voltage transformer secondary 120 is connected to a spark gap 140<br>
through a distributor 150. Specific spark gap 140 is ignited when the specific distribution<br><br>
point in the distributor 150 is connected. In this conventional system to produce spark, first the mechanical circuit breaker 130 is closed for some time. During this time current builds up in the high voltage transformer primary 110. After some time, the mechanical circuit breaker, 130 is opened. The opening of the mechanical circuit breaker 130 interrupts the primary current in the primary of the high voltage transformer 110. Because of this sudden interruption of primary current, a high voltage is produced in the high voltage transformer's secondary 120. This high voltage is of the order of 10-30KV. This high voltage produces spark at the spark gap 140. Normally, the duration of the spark is about 1 millisecond and the peak cuirent to the spark is about 30mA. The resultant energy delivered at the spark gap 140 is only about 10 to 30mJ. To increase this energy level, the additional circuit consists of a DC-to-DC converter 160, a thyristor 170, a capacitor 180, a primary of the low voltage transformer 190, a secondary of the low voltage transformer 200, a current limiting resistor 210 and a diode 220 are used.<br>
(0033)	The DC-to-DC converter 160 produces about 400V DC from the input supply<br>
of a power source 100. This 500V DC charges the capacitor 180 through the primary of the low voltage transformer 190. This charged capacitor 180 is discharged using the thyristor 170. The thyristor 170 is switched ON by applying the required gate pulse whenever the mechanical circuit breaker 130, is switched OFF. It is very important to operate the thyristor 170 along with the mechanical circuit breaker 130. The switching ON of the thyristor 170 discharges the capacitor 180 through the primary of the low voltage transformer 190. A voltage of about 400V is produced in the secondary of the low voltage transformer 200 whenever capacitor 180 is discharged. This low voltage is now applied to the spark 140, through the current limiting resistor 210 and the diode 220. Whenever the mechanical circuit breaker 130 is opened, an arc is produced at the spark gap 140 due to high voltage originating from the secondary of the high voltage transformer 120. Since along with the opening of mechanical circuit breaker 130, the thyristor 170 is also switched ON, the discharging of capacitor 180 delivers energy to the spark gap 140 through the current limiting resistor 210 and the diode 220. The voltage produced at the secondary of the low voltage transformer 200 is able to deliver energy to the spark gap 140 because the high voltage from the secondary of the high voltage transformer 120 had already produced spark and the voltage across the spark gap 140 was already reduced to a lower value. Most of the energy stored in the capacitor 180 which is Vi CV^, is delivered to the spark gap. For Capacitance, C=2uF and Voltage, V=500V. The energy available at the capacitor 180 is 250mJ. This additional energy<br><br>
delivering system consisting components DC-to-DC converter 160, thyristor 170, capacitor 180, primary of the low voltage transformer 190, secondary of the low voltage transformer 200, current limiting resistor 210 and diode 220 is a modified form of conventional Capacitive Discharge System. In the present system, the turns ratio between the primary of the low voltage transformer 190 and the secondary of the low voltage transformer 200 is kept as 1:1. Therefore, only about 500V alone is available at the secondary of the low voltage transformer 200. Because of this 1:1 ratio, the reflected impedance seen by the primary of the low voltage transformer 190 due to the spark at the spark gap 140 is high. In the present circuit, since the ratio between the primary of the low voltage transformer 190 and the secondary of the low voltage transformer 200 is kept as 1:1, the reflected impedance at the primary of the low voltage transformer 190 is comparatively high and hence the discharge time of the capacitor 180 is comparatively higher. Typically it is about 0.5ms duration in the modified circuit as described in the present invention. During this discharge time, through the current limiting resistor 190 and the diode 200 energy is delivered to the already existing spark. The current actually flowing through the secondary of the low voltage transformer 200 is comparatively high because of the 1:1 transformer ratio. The current limiting resistor 210 is used actually to limit the current. Typically 100-200ti is used. The diode is used to block the high voltage coming from the spark gap due to the secondary of the high voltage transformer 120.<br>
(34)	Fig. 2 illustrates the waveform of the current due to the mechanical circuit breaker at the spark gap 140 and the waveform of the current due to the high current capacitive discharge system at the spark gap 140. The actual current of the high current system is about lA peak. By keeping the lower value of current limiting resistor 210, the peak current magnitude can be increased up to 3A. However, this reduces the time duration of the secondary discharge. (The discharge due to the firing of the thyristor 170 is called secondary discharge. The discharge due to the high voltage from the secondary of the high voltage transformer 120 is called the primary discharge). The primary discharge supplies about 10-30mJ of energy to the spark gap and the secondary discharge delivers about 100-200 milli joules of energy at the spark gap. In this invention most of the energy flows through the low resistance transformer secondary and hence high efficiency.<br>
(35)	Fig. 3 illustrates the circuit diagram of a High Current Capacitive Discharge Ignition System applied to the Conventional Capacitive Ignition System in the context of the<br>
-9-<br><br>
present invention. A power source 100 is connected to the DC-DC converter 230. One end of the DC-DC converter 230, output is connected to ground and the other end of the output of the DC-DC converter 230 is connected to the thyristor 240. The cathode of the thyristor 240 is connected to the ground. The anode of the thyristor 240 is connected to one end of the capacitor 250. The other end of the capacitor 250 is connected to the one end of the high voltage transformer primary 110. One end of the secondary of the high voltage transformer 120 is connected to the ground and the other end of the secondary of the high voltage transformer 120 is connected to the distributor 150. The specific spark gap 140 is connected to the specific distributor point 150. In this Conventional Capacitive Discharge System to produce the spark, first the DC-DC converter 230 charges the capacitor 250 through the primary of the high voltage transformer 110. After this the gate voltage is applied to the thyristor 240. This discharges the capacitor 250 through the primary of the high voltage transformer 110. This discharge produces about -10 kV to -30 kV voltage at the secondary of the high voltage transformer 120. This high voltage is applied to the specific spark gap 140 through the specific point in the distributor 150. This high voltage ignites the spark gap producing the spark of about 0.1 millisecond and its energy level is about 10-30 mJ.<br>
(36)	The second DC-DC converter 160 is connected to the power source 100. One end of the output of the DC-DC converter 160 is grounded and the other end of the DC-DC converter 160 is connected to the anode of the second thyristor 170. The anode of the second thyristor 170 is connected to the capacitor 180. The other end of the capacitor 180 is connected to the low voltage transformer primary 190. The secondary of the low voltage transformer 200 is connected to the current limiting resistor 210. The current limiting resistor 210 is connected to the high voltage diodes 220. The high voltage diodes 220 are connected to the spark gap 140.<br>
(37)	Whenever the thyristor 240 is fired by applying its gale pulse arc is produced at the spark gap 140 due to the discharge of the capacitor 250 through the primary of the transformer 110. After discharging of the capacitor 250 the thyristor 240 goes off automatically and the capacitor 250 will be getting charged from the DC-DC converter 230. Along with firing of the thyristor 240 the thyristor 170 also fired simultaneously by applying the gate pulse. Once the thyristor 170 is fired, it discharges the capacitor 180 through the primary of the low voltage transformer 190. This discharge action produces about 500 volt in the secondary of the low voltage transformer 200. This voltage is applied to the spark gap<br>
-10-<br><br>
140 through the current limiting resistor 210 and the high voltage diodes 220. Due to the high voltage from the secondary of the high voltage transformer 120 the spark gap 140 had already produced the spark and the voltage across the spark gap 140 was already reduced to a lower value. Therefore, the low voltage coming from the secondary of the low voltage transformer 200 delivers additional energy to the spark. As described in the previous embodiment, since the turns ratio of the low voltage transformer is kept as 1:1, at its secondary 200 large current of the order of lA to 3A flows through the spark gap 140. The duration of the spark is also about 0.5 millisecond and the current limiting resistor 210 of the order of 100- 200 ohm is used. The diode 220 is used to block the high voltage coming from the spark gap 140 during the initial period due to high voltage transformer secondary 120. The actual current waveform is similar to the one shown in the fig.4. The energy delivered by the high current discharge system consisting of DC-DC converter 160, the thyristor 170, the capacitor 180 and the low voltage transformer primary 190, the low voltage transformer secondary 200, the current limiting resistor 210, the diode 220 are of the order of 100- 200 milli joules at the spark gap.<br>
(0038)	Fig.4 illustrates the current waveform due to the Conventional Capacitive<br>
Discharge System at the spark gap 140 and the current waveform due to the high current capacitive discharge system at the spark gap 140. The Conventional Capacitive Discharge System produces current of approximately 30 milliamps and its duration is only about 100 microseconds. The Improved Ignition System produced a peak current of approximately 1 amps and its duration is about 400 microseconds as illustrated in the figure-4. As in the illustration the current from the low voltage transformer secondary 200 starts immediately after the start of the high voltage transformer's secondary 120 current.
