				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to microcapsules having<br>
multiple shells, to methods of preparing microcapsules and<br>
to their use.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Microcapsules are small particles of solids, or<br>
droplets of liquids, inside a thin coating of a shell<br>
material such as starch, gelatine, lipids, polysaccharides,<br>
wax or polyacrylic acids. They are used, for example, to<br>
prepare liquids as free-flowing powders or compressed<br>
solids, to separate reactive materials, to reduce toxicity,<br>
to protect against oxidation and/or to control the rate of<br>
release of a substance such as an enzyme, flavour, a<br>
nutrient, a drug, etc.<br>
Ideally, a microcapsule would have good mechanical<br>
strength (e.g. resistance to rupture) and the microcapsule<br>
shell would provide a good barrier to oxidation, etc.<br>
Â»<br>
A typical approach to meeting these requirements<br>
is to increase the thickness of the microcapsule wall. But<br>
this results in an undesirable reduction in the loading<br>
capacity of the microcapsule. That is, the "payload" of the<br>
microcapsule, being the mass of the loading substance<br>
encapsulated in the microcapsule divided by the total mass<br>
of the microcapsule, is low. The typical payload of such<br>
"single-core" microcapsules made by spray drying an emulsion<br>
is in the range of about 25-50%.<br>
Another approach to the problem has been to create<br>
what are known as "multi-core" microcapsules. These<br>
microcapsules are usually formed by spray drying an emulsion<br>
of core material such that the shell material coats<br>
individual particles of core material, which then aggregate<br>
and form a cluster. A typical multi-core microcapsule is<br>
depicted in prior art Figure 1. Multi-core microcapsule 10<br>
contains a plurality of cores 12. The cores 12 take the<br>
form of entrapped particles of solids or of liquid droplets<br>
dispersed throughout a relatively continuous matrix of shell<br>
material 14. As a result, there is a high ratio of shell<br>
material to loading material and the payload of the multicore<br>
microcapsule is therefore low. Moreover, despite the<br>
high ratio of shell material to loading substance in such<br>
microcapsules, the shell material is poorly distributed. As<br>
shown in prior art Figure 1, many of the cores 12 are very<br>
close to the surface 16 of the microcapsule. The cores at<br>
the surface are therefore not well protected against rupture<br>
or from oxidation.<br>
Known microcapsules therefore either have a poor<br>
payload, or fail to adequately contain and protect the<br>
loading substance deposited therein. Moreover, because<br>
these microcapsules are generally prepared in a single step,<br>
it is difficult to incorporate multiple functionalities,<br>
such as oxidation resistance, moisture resistance and taste<br>
masking into a single microcapsule.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides a multi-core<br>
microcapsulG comprising: (a) an agglomeration of primary<br>
microcapsules, each primary microcapsule comprising a core<br>
and a first shell surrounding the core; (b) a second shell<br>
surrounding the agglomeration; and (c) a third shell<br>
surrounding the second shell; at least one of the first,<br>
second and third shells comprising a complex coacervate.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a<br>
single-core microcapsule comprising: (a) a core; (b) a first<br>
shell surrounding the core; and (c) a second shell<br>
surrounding the first shell; at least one of the first and<br>
second shells comprising a complex coacervate.<br>
In the case of either the multi-core or singlecore<br>
microcapsules, it is preferred that all of the shells<br>
comprise a complex coacervate, which may be the same or<br>
different for each of the shells. Additional shells, e.g.<br>
from 1 to 20, may be added to further strengthen the<br>
microcapsule.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a<br>
process for making a microcapsule having a plurality of<br>
shells, the process comprising:<br>
(a) providing a microcapsule selected from the group<br>
consisting of:<br>
(i) a multi-core microcapsule comprising: an<br>
agglomeration of primary microcapsules, each<br>
primary microcapsule comprising a core and a first<br>
shell surrounding the core; and a second shell<br>
surrounding said agglomeration; and<br>
(ii) a single-core microcapsule comprising: a<br>
core; arid a first shell surrounding the core;<br>
(b) . mixing the microcapsule with first; arid second<br>
polymer components of shell material in aqueous solution;<br>
(c) adjusting at least one of pH, temperature,<br>
concentration and mixing speed to form shell macerial<br>
comprising the first: arid second polymer components, the<br>
shell material forming an additional shell enveloping the<br>
microcapsule;<br>
wherein at least one of the first shell, the second shell<br>
and the additional shell comprises a complex, coacervate.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a multicore<br>
microcapsule comprising:<br>
(a) an agglomeration of primary micro caps'ales, each primary<br>
microcapsule comprising a core and a. fie si., shell surrounding<br>
said core;<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Core Materials<br>
Any core material that may be encapsulated in<br>
microcapsules is useful in the invention. Indeed, in<br>
certain embodiments, commercially available microcapsulea<br>
may be obtained and then further processed according to the<br>
processes of the invention.<br>
When the initial multi-core microcapsules are<br>
prepared according to processes as described herein<br>
involving an aqueous solution, the core material may be<br>
virtually any substance that is not entirely soluble in the<br>
aqueous solution. Preferably, the core is a solid, a<br>
hydrophobic liquid, or a mixture of a solid and a<br>
hydrophobic liquid. The core is more preferably a<br>
hydrophobic liquid, such as grease, oil or a mixture<br>
thereof. Typical oils may be fish oils, vegetable oils,<br>
mineral oils, derivatives thereof or mixtures thereof. The<br>
loading substance may comprise a purified or partially<br>
purified oily substance such as a fatty acid, a triglyceride<br>
or a mixture thereof. Omega-3 fatty acids, such as<br>
a-linolenic acid (18:3n3), octadecatetraenoic acid (18:4n3),<br>
eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n3) (EPA) and docosahexaenoic<br>
acid (22:6n3) (DHA) , and derivatives thereof- and mixtures<br>
thereof, are preferred. Many types of derivatives are well<br>
known to one skilled in the art. Examples of suitable<br>
derivatives are esters, such as phytosterol esters, branched<br>
or unbranched Ci-C^o alkyl esters, branched or unbranched C2-<br>
C30 alkenyl esters or branched or unbranched C3-C30 cycloalkyl<br>
esters, in particular phytosterol esters and Ci-C6 alkyl<br>
esters. Preferred sources of oils are oils derived from<br>
aquatic organisms (e.g. anchovies, capelin, Atlantic cod,<br>
Atlantic herring, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic menhaden,<br>
salmonids, sardines, shark, tuna, etc) and plants (e.g.<br>
flax, vegetables, algae, etc) .<br>
While the core may or may not be a biologically<br>
active substance such as a tocopherol, antioxidant or<br>
vitamin, the microcapsules of the present invention are<br>
particularly suited for biologically active substances, for<br>
example, drugs, nutritional supplements, flavours,<br>
antioxidants or mixtures thereof.<br>
Shell Material<br>
Coacervation is a phase separation phenomenon, in<br>
which a homogenous polymer solution is converted into two<br>
phases. One is a polymer-rich phase, called a coacervate.<br>
The other is a polymer-poor phase, i.e., solvent. Complex<br>
coacervation is caused by the interaction of two oppositely<br>
charged polymers.<br>
Preferably, a positively charged polymer component<br>
"A" interacts with a negatively charged polymer component<br>
"B" . For example, positively charged type A gelatine<br>
("component A") forms complex coacervates with negatively<br>
charged polyphosphate ("component B"). Other systems that<br>
have been studied are gelatine/gum Acacia, gelatine/pectin,<br>
gelatine/carboxymethyl guar gum and whey protein/gum arable.<br>
Component A is preferably gelatine type A,<br>
chitosan, etc., although other polymers are also<br>
contemplated as component A. Component B is preferably<br>
I " gelatine type B, polyphosphate, gum arabic, alginate,<br>
carrageerian, pectin, carboxymethylcellulose, or a mixture<br>
thereof.<br>
In addition to the charge density of the two<br>
polymer components, complex coacervation depends on other<br>
factors such as molecular weight of the polymers and their<br>
ratio, ionic strength, pH and temperature of the medium (J.<br>
Micro-encapsulation, 2003, Vol. 20, No. 2: 203-210) .<br>
The molar ratio of component A:component B that is<br>
used depends on the type of components but is typically from<br>
1:5 to 15:1. For example, when gelatine type A and<br>
polyphosphate are used as components A and B respectively,<br>
the molar ratio of component A:component B is preferably 8:1<br>
to 12:1; when gelatine type A and gelatine type B are used<br>
as components A and B respectively, the molar ratio of<br>
component A:component B is preferably 2:1 to 1:2; and when<br>
gelatine type A and alginate are used as components A and B<br>
respectively, the molar ratio of component A:component B is<br>
preferably 3:1 to 5:1.<br>
One suitable process of microencapsulation using<br>
complex coacervation comprises three steps: 1) dispersing<br>
the loading substance into a system of at least one of the<br>
polymers for the complex coacervate; 2) forming shells by<br>
deposition of coacervates which derive from the polymeric<br>
components under controlled conditions of temperature, pH,<br>
concentration of colloids, mixing speed etc.; and 3)<br>
hardening of the shells by crosslinking of the coacervates<br>
deposited on microcapsules (Ullmann's Encyclopedia of<br>
Industrial Chemistry 6th edition. 2001, Vol. A16. pp. 575-<br>
588) .<br>
Any shells that do not comprise complex<br>
coacervates may be formed of any material that can form an<br>
additional shell around the microcapsule. The additional<br>
shell material typically comprises at least one polymer<br>
component. Examples of polymer components include, but are<br>
not limited to, proteins, e.g. gelatines, soy proteins, whey<br>
proteins, and milk proteins, polyphosphate, polysaccharides<br>
and mixtures thereof. Preferred polymer components are<br>
gelatine A, gelatine B, polyphosphate, gum arabic, alginate,<br>
chitosan, carrageerian, pectin, cellulose or derivatives of<br>
cellulose such as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) or a mixture<br>
thereof. A particularly preferred form of gelatine type A<br>
has a Bloom strength of 50-350, more preferably a Bloom<br>
strength of about 275.<br>
The shell material can also comprise lipids, such<br>
as waxes, fatty acids and oils, etc. to provide desired<br>
functionalities. The incorporation of lipids into the shell<br>
material improves the impermeability of the shell to water<br>
and oxygen. A preferred lipid for this purpose is beeswax.<br>
These lipids may be in solid, semi-solid or liquid form.<br>
Processing Aids<br>
Processing aids may be included in the shell<br>
material . Processing aids may be used for a variety of<br>
reasons. For example, they may be used to promote<br>
agglomeration of primary microcapsules when forming multicore<br>
microcapsules, control microcapsule size and shape<br>
and/or to act as an antioxidant. Antioxidant properties are<br>
useful both during the process (e.g. during coacervation<br>
and/or spray drying) and in the microcapsules after they are<br>
formed (e.g. to extend shelf -life of loading substances<br>
which are readily oxidized, etc) . Preferably a small number<br>
of processing aids that perform a large number of functions<br>
are used. For example, ascorbic acid or a salt thereof may<br>
be used to promote agglomeration of the primary<br>
microcapsules, to control microcapsule size and shape and to<br>
act as an antioxidant. The ascorbic acid or salt thereof is<br>
/opreferably<br>
used in an amount of about 100 ppm to about<br>
10,000 ppm, more preferably about 1000 ppm to about 5000 ppm<br>
relative to the batch size (i.e., the total weight) . A salt<br>
of ascorbic acid, such as sodium or potassium ascorbate, is<br>
particularly preferred in this capacity. Other processing'<br>
aids include, without limitation, buffering acids and/or<br>
their salts such as phosphoric acid, acetic acid, citric<br>
acid, and the like.<br>
S^y^tujL5: Â°f Microcapsules<br>
In one embodiment, microcapsules of the invention<br>
have a structure generally as depicted in Figure 2. Figure<br>
2 depicts a multi-core microcapsule prepared according to a<br>
multi-step process of the invention. Primary microcapsules<br>
comprise cores 18 (i.e. the loading substance) surrounded by<br>
first shells 20. The primary microcapsules agglomerate and<br>
the space 22 between them is usually at least partly filled<br>
by additional shell material of same composition as first<br>
shell 20, although there may be voids between some of the<br>
primary microcapsules . The agglomeration of primary<br>
microcapsules is surrounded by a second shell 24.<br>
Multi-core microcapsules comprising second shell<br>
24 may be prepared according to the processes described<br>
herein and exemplified in the examples or by generally the<br>
same techniques that are described in Applicant's co-pending<br>
United States Patent Application No. 10/120,621 filed April<br>
11, 2002, corresponding to International Application No.<br>
PCT/CA2003/000520 filed April 8, 2003, the disclosures of<br>
both of which are incorporated herein by reference. These<br>
multi-core microcapsules are particularly useful because the<br>
foam-like structure of primary microcapsules, supported by<br>
additional shell material in space 22 and surrounded by<br>
second shell 24 is an extremely strong, rupture-resistant<br>
structure that has a high payload i.e. the ratio of the<br>
total mass of the cores to the total mass of the multi-core<br>
microcapsule is very high, e.g. at least 50, 55, 60, 65, 70,<br>
75, 80, 85, 90% or higher. This is called a "one-step"<br>
process when shells 20 and 24 are of the same composition<br>
and formed in a single step. When shells 20 and 24 are of<br>
different composition, the process involves two steps.<br>
Commercially available multicore microcapsules may<br>
also be used as starting materials. An example is the<br>
Driphormâ¢ Hi-DHAâ¢ microencapsulated tuna oil, manufactured<br>
by Nu-Mega Ingredients Pty. Ltd., Queensland, AU.<br>
In accordance with the invention, a three-step<br>
process takes place when a third shell 26 is formed on the<br>
multi-core microcapsule. Third shell 26 further strengthens<br>
the microcapsule and can be advantageously used to provide a<br>
shell having properties different from those of shell 24.<br>
For instance, different polymer components can be<br>
incorporated into third shell 26. In addition, or<br>
alternatively, lipids may be incorporated into shell 26 to<br>
increase moisture or oxygen impermeability or the like.<br>
These properties might instead be incorporated into second<br>
shell 24 rather than third shell 26 (or also into second<br>
shell 24 as well as into third shell 26), depending on the<br>
requirements for a particular purpose. Additional shells,<br>
not shown in Figure 2, may be formed around third shell 26,<br>
by the methods and techniques of the invention. For<br>
instance, N additional shells could be added, wherein N is<br>
an integer from 1 to 20.<br>
At least one of shells 20, 24 and 26 and of any<br>
additional shells comprises a complex coacervate, as<br>
described above. Preferably, at least two of the shells<br>
comprise a complex coacervate. Even more preferably, all of<br>
the shells comprise a complex coacervate. For instance, the<br>
following shells may comprise complex coacervates: (a) shell<br>
20; (b) shell 24; (c) shell 26; (d) shells 20 and 24; (e)<br>
shells 20 and 26; (f) shells 24 and 26; or (g) shells 20, 24<br>
and 26. Additional shells also preferably comprise a<br>
complex coacervate.<br>
Referring again to Figure 2, the primary<br>
microcapsules (i.e. cores 18 surrounded by first shells 20)<br>
typically have an average diameter of about 40 nm to about<br>
10 ^m, more particularly from about 0.1 (j.m to about 5 nm,<br>
even more particularly an average diameter of about 1 - 2<br>
l^m. The finished multi-core microcapsule, i.e. including<br>
third shell 26, usually has an average diameter from about 1<br>
Mm to about 2000 /im, more typically from about 20 /um to<br>
about 1000 jum, more particularly from about 20 /zm to about<br>
100 /xm and even more particularly from about 50 ^m to about<br>
100 fj.m.<br>
In Figure 2, second shell 24 and third shell 26<br>
are depicted as discrete layers. This will be the case if<br>
the shells are formed of the different shell materials. In<br>
that case, even if they do not differ in appearance, they<br>
will have a different composition and can be represented as<br>
discrete, distinct layers. But if second shell 24 and third<br>
shell 26 are formed of the same shell material, they may, as<br>
shown in Figure 3, merge to form a single, continuous layer,<br>
having the combined thickness of second shell 24 and third<br>
shell 26. As shown in Figure 3, when the second and third<br>
shells are of the same composition, there may be no discrete<br>
boundary separating them. This would be true also in<br>
microcapsules of the invention having fourth or additional<br>
shells that are of the same composition as the preceding<br>
shell.<br>
The invention is also useful in the preparation of<br>
airigle-oore microcapsules having multiple shells. Sinqlecore<br>
microcapsules useful as starting materials are<br>
commercially available. Examples include microencapsulated<br>
flavours by Givaudan Flavors Corp., Cincinnati, Ohio, USA,<br>
and microencapsulated minerals and vitamins by Watson Food<br>
Co. Inc., West Haven, CT., USA. Alternatively, they can be<br>
made by complex coacervation processes as described herein,<br>
e.g. by preparing primary microcapsules without a further<br>
agglomeration step. Figure 4 depicts a single-core<br>
microcapsule having multiple shells in accordance with the<br>
invention. Core 18 is surrounded by a first shell 20 and a<br>
second shell 24. Additional shells, not shown in Figure 4,<br>
may be formed around second shell 24, by the methods and<br>
techniques of the invention. For instance, N additional<br>
shells could be added, wherein N is an integer from 1 to 20.<br>
As with the multi-core microcapsules, shells 20<br>
and 24 of single-core microcapsules may be of the same or<br>
different composition. At least one of shells 20 and 24 and<br>
of any additional shells comprises complex coacervates as<br>
described above. Preferably, at least two of the shells<br>
comprise a complex coacervate. Even more preferably all of<br>
the shells comprise a complex coacervate. For instance, the<br>
following shells may comprise complex coacervates: (a) shell<br>
20; (b) shell 24; or (c) shells 20 and 24. Additional<br>
shells also preferably comprise complex coacervates.<br>
Single-core microcapsules may be as large as<br>
multi-core microcapsules. For instance, the exterior<br>
diameter of second shell 24 in the single-core microcapsule<br>
of Figure 4 may be from about 1 ^m to about 2000/xm. More<br>
typically it will be from about 20p.m to about 1000 urn, more<br>
particularly from about 20/j.m to about 100 Mm and even more<br>
particularly from about 50 /itn to about 100 /irn.<br>
When they are of the same composition, first shell<br>
20 and second shell 24 (and any additional shell) of the<br>
single-core multicapsule may merge to form a single<br>
continuous layer as depicted in Figure 5. This may be done<br>
in a one-step process.<br>
Processes<br>
Single or multi-core microcapsules to which<br>
additional shells may be added by the processes of the<br>
invention may be obtained from commercial sources. In a<br>
particularly preferred embodiment, multi-core microcapsules<br>
prepared in accordance with applicant's co-pending United<br>
States Patent Application No. 10/120,621 filed April 11,<br>
2002, corresponding to International Application No.<br>
PCT/CA2003/000520 filed April 8, 2003, the disclosures of<br>
both of which are incorporated herein by reference, are<br>
used. Such microcapsules can be prepared e.g. by a one step<br>
process as follows.<br>
An aqueous mixture of a loading substance (i.e.<br>
core material) and a polymer component of the shell material<br>
is formed. The aqueous mixture may be a mechanical mixture,<br>
a suspension or an emulsion. When a liquid loading material<br>
is used, particularly a hydrophobic liquid, the aqueous<br>
mixture is preferably an emulsion of the loading material<br>
and the polymer components.<br>
In a more preferred aspect, a first polymer<br>
component ia provided in aqueous solution, preferably<br>
together with processing aids, such as antioxidants. A<br>
loading substance may then be dispersed into the aqueous<br>
mixture, for example, by using a homogenizer. If the<br>
loading substance is a hydrophobic liquid, an emulsion is<br>
formed in which a fraction of the first polymer component<br>
begins to deposit around individual droplets of loading<br>
substance to begin the formation of primary shells. If the<br>
loading substance is a solid particle, a suspension is<br>
formed in which a fraction of the first polymer component<br>
begins to deposit around individual particles to begin the<br>
formation of primary shells. At this point, another aqueous<br>
solution of a second polymer component may be added to the<br>
aqueous mixture.<br>
Droplets or particles of the loading substance in<br>
the aqueous mixture preferably have an average diameter of<br>
less than 100 [o,m, more preferably less than 50 |j.m, even more<br>
preferably less than 25 (im. Droplets or particles of the<br>
loading substance having an average diameter less than 10 p,m<br>
or less than 5 jj,m or less than 3 jam or less than 1 um may be<br>
used. Particle size may be measured using any typical<br>
equipment known in the art, for example, a Coulterâ¢ LS230<br>
Particle Size Analyzer, Miami, Florida, USA.<br>
The amount of the polymer components of the shell<br>
material provided in the aqueous mixture is typically<br>
sufficient to form both the primary and outer shells of<br>
microcapsules. Preferably, the loading substance is<br>
provided in an amount of from about 1% to about 15% by<br>
weight of the aqueous mixture, more preferably from about 3%<br>
to about 8% by weight, and even more preferably about 6% by<br>
weight.<br>
If a complex coacervate is desired, the pH,<br>
temperature, concentration, mixing speed or a combination<br>
thereof is then adjusted to accelerate the formation of the<br>
primary shells of complex coacervate around the droplets or<br>
particles of the loading substance to form primary<br>
microcapsules. In the case of multicore microcapsules,<br>
agglomeration of the primary microcapsules will take place<br>
to form discrete clumps at desired size and shape.<br>
pH is an expression of the concentration of<br>
hydrogen ions in solution. Such ions affect the ionization<br>
equilibria of the component A and B polymers involved in<br>
complex coacervation and thus the formation of complex<br>
coacervates. The pH is adjusted so that the component A<br>
polymer will bear a net positive charge and the component B<br>
polymer will bear a net negative charge. Hence, the pH<br>
adjustment depends on-the type of shell material to be used.<br>
For example, when gelatine type A is a polymer<br>
component, the gelatine molecules have nearly equal positive<br>
and negative charges (i.e. zero net polarity change) at<br>
their point of zero charge (pzc) around pH 9-10. Only when<br>
the solution pH is lower than the pzc value, will the<br>
polymer bear a net positive charge, which interacts with the<br>
negatively charged component B (e.g. gum arabic,<br>
polyphosphate, alginate, etc.).<br>
In the case of gelatine type A, the pH is<br>
preferably adjusted to a value from 3.5-5.0, more preferably<br>
from 4.0-5.0. Much outside this range, the gelatine-based<br>
complex tends to form gels upon cooling rather than a shell<br>
on the microcapsules. If the pH of the mixture starts in<br>
the desired range, then little or no pH adjustment is<br>
required.<br>
The molar ratio of components A and B is adjusted<br>
to favour formation of shells on the microcapsules r.ather<br>
than merely the formation of gel particles in solution.<br>
Suitable molar ratios are discussed above under the heading<br>
"Shell Material".<br>
The concentration of components A and B in the<br>
aqueous mixture may also affect the formation of complex<br>
coacervates and can be adjusted accordingly. Typically, the<br>
total concentration of components A and B varies -from 1% to<br>
20%, preferably 2-10%, and more preferably 3-6% by weight of<br>
the aqueous mixture. For instance, when gelatine type A is<br>
uoed as component A, the concentration of gelatine type A is<br>
preferably from 1-15% by weight of the aqueous mixture, more<br>
preferably 2-6% by weight and even more preferably 2-4% by<br>
weight. Similarly, when polyphosphate is used as component<br>
B, its concentration in the aqueous mixture is preferably<br>
0,. 01- 0.65% by weight of the aqueous mixture, more<br>
preferably 0.13 - 0.17% by weight, even more preferably 0.13<br>
- 0.26% by weight.<br>
The initial temperature of the aqueous mixture is<br>
preferably set to a value of from about 40Â°C to about 60Â°C,<br>
more preferably at about 50Â°C.<br>
Mixing speed influences the deposition of complex<br>
coacervates on the surface of microcapsules. If the mixing<br>
speed is too low, the aqueous mixture is agitated<br>
insufficiently and undesirably large microcapsules may be<br>
formed. Conversely, if the mixing speed is too high, high<br>
shear forces are generated and prevent shell material from<br>
forming on the microcapsules. Instead, gel particles form<br>
in the solution. The mixing speed is preferably between 100<br>
and 1500 rpm, more preferably between 400 and 1000 rpm and<br>
even more preferably between 600 and 800 rpm. Particular<br>
mixing parameters depend on the type of equipment being<br>
used. Any of a variety of types of mixing equipment known<br>
in the art may be used. Particularly useful is an axial<br>
flow impeller, such as Lightninâ¢ A310 or A510.<br>
At this time, materials for outer shell are added<br>
into the mixture, and the aqueous mixture may then be cooled<br>
under controlled cooling rate and mixing parameters to<br>
permit coating of the primary microcapsules to form outer<br>
shells. It is advantageous to control the formation of the<br>
outer shell at a temperature above the gel point of the<br>
shell material. It is also possible at this stage to<br>
further add more polymer components, either of the same kind<br>
or a different kind, in order to thicken the outer shell<br>
and/or produce micro-capsules having different layers of<br>
shells to provide desired functionalities. The temperature<br>
is preferably lowered at a rate of about 1Â°C/10 minutes until<br>
it reaches a temperature of from about 5Â°C to about 10Â°C,<br>
preferably about 5Â°C. The outer shell encapsulates the<br>
primary microcapsules or clumps to form a rigid encapsulated<br>
agglomeration of microcapsules.<br>
At this stage, a cross-linker may be added to<br>
further increase the rigidity of the microcapsules by crosslinking<br>
the shell material in both the outer and primary<br>
shells and to make the shells insoluble in both aqueous and<br>
non-aqueous (e.g., oil) media. Any suitable cross-linker<br>
may be used and the choice of cross-linker depends somewhat<br>
on the choice of shell material. Preferred cross-linkers<br>
are enzymatic cross-linkers (e.g. transglutaminase),<br>
aldehydes (e.g. formaldehyde or gluteraldehyde), tannic<br>
acid, alum, organic or inorganic calcium or potassium salt,<br>
or a mixture thereof. When the microcapsules are to be used<br>
to deliver a biologically active substance to an organism,<br>
the cross-linkers are preferably non-toxic or of<br>
sufficiently low toxicity. The type and the amount.of<br>
cross-linker used depend on the type of. shell material and<br>
may be adjusted to provide more or less structural rigidity<br>
as desired. For example, when gelatine type A is used in<br>
the shell material, transglutaminase may be conveniently<br>
used in an amount of about 0.2% to about 2.0%, preferably<br>
about 1.0%, by weight of microcapsule suspension. In<br>
general, one skilled in the art may routinely determine the<br>
desired amount in any given case by simple experimentation.<br>
At this stage, multi-core microcapsules have been<br>
produced. These microcapsules or other microcapsules may<br>
then be processed in accordance with the invention to add<br>
additional shell layers as described above. Preferably,<br>
additional shells are added after the formation of the outer<br>
â¢nshell<br>
of the microcapsule or before the cross-linking step.<br>
More particularly, first and second polymer components of<br>
shell material are dissolved in aqueous solution e.g. at 40<br>
to 60Â°C, more preferably around 50Â°C. pH may be controlled<br>
or adjusted at this stage. The microcapsules previously<br>
prepared are then combined with this mixture.<br>
Alternatively, the microcapsules may be combined with an<br>
aqueous solution of the first polymer component of shell<br>
material and then a second aqueous solution of the second<br>
polymer component of shell material may be added. pH,<br>
temperature, concentration, mixing speed or a combination<br>
thereof can then be adjusted as described above so that the<br>
polymer components of shell material form a complex<br>
coacervate surrounding and coating the microcapsules with an<br>
additional shell. As discussed above, processing aids may<br>
be incorporated as may be hydrophobic materials such as<br>
oils, waxes, resins or fats. The new outer shell may be<br>
then cross-linked as described above. These additional<br>
steps of forming additional shell layers may be repeated as<br>
desired to build up a suitable number of further shells on<br>
the microcapsule.<br>
Finally, the microcapsules may be washed with<br>
water and/or dried to provide a free-flowing powder. Drying<br>
may be accomplished by a number of methods known in the art,<br>
such as freeze drying, drying with ethanol or spray drying.<br>
Spray drying is a particularly preferred method for drying<br>
the microcapsules. Spray drying techniques are disclosed in<br>
"Spray Drying Handbook", K. Masters, 5th edition, Longman<br>
Scientific Technical UK, 1991, the disclosure of which is<br>
hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Uses<br>
The microcapsules produced by the processes of the<br>
present invention may be used to prepare liquids as freeflowing<br>
powders or compressed solids, to store a substance,<br>
to separate reactive substances, to reduce toxicity of a<br>
substance, to protect a substance against oxidation, to<br>
deliver a substance to a specified environment and/or to<br>
control the rate of release of a substance. In particular,<br>
the microcapsules may be used to deliver a biologically<br>
active substance to an organism for nutritional or medical<br>
purposes. The biologically active substance may be, for<br>
example, a nutritional supplement, a flavour, a drug and/or<br>
an enzyme. The organism is preferably a mammal, more<br>
preferably a human. Microcapsules containing the<br>
biologically active substance may be included, for example,<br>
in foods or beverages or in drug delivery systems. Use of<br>
the microcapsules of the present invention for formulating a<br>
nutritional supplement into human food is particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
Microcapsules of the present invention have good<br>
rupture strength to help reduce or prevent breaking of the<br>
microcapsules during incorporation into food or other<br>
formulations. Furthermore, the microcapsulon' shells can be<br>
formulated to be insoluble in both aqueous and non-aqueous<br>
(e.g., oil) media, and help reduce or prevent oxidation<br>
and/or deterioration of the loading substance during<br>
preparation of the microcapsules, during long-term storage,<br>
and/or during incorporation of the microcapsules into a<br>
formulation vehicle, for example, into foods, beverages,<br>
nutraceutical formulations or pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
The invention will now be further illustrated by<br>
the following non-limiting examples.<br>
2-1 -<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1: Multicore microcapsules prepared by one-step<br>
process for comparison (both first and second shells having<br>
the same composition of gelatine and polyphosphate)<br>
54.5 grams gelatine 275 Bloom type A (isoelectric<br>
point of about 9) was mixed with 600 grams of deionized<br>
water containing 0.5% sodium ascorbate under agitation at<br>
50Â°C until completely dissolved. 5.45 grams of sodium<br>
polyphosphate was dissolved in 104 grams of deionized water<br>
containing 0.5% sodium ascorbate. 90 gram's of a fish oil<br>
concentrate containing 30% eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester<br>
(EPA) and 20% docosahexaenoic acid ethyl ester (DHA)<br>
(available from Ocean Nutrition Canada Ltd.) was dispersed<br>
with 1.0% of an antioxidant (mixed natural tocopherols) into<br>
the gelatine solution with a high speed Polytronâ¢<br>
homogenizer at 5,500 rpm for 6 minutes. An oil-in-water<br>
emulsion was formed. The oil droplet size had a narrow<br>
distribution with an average size of about 1 (xm measured by<br>
Coulterâ¢ LS230 Particle Size Analyzer. The emulsion was<br>
diluted with 700 grams of deionized water containing 0.5%<br>
sodium ascorbate at 50Â°C. The sodium polyphosphate solution<br>
was then added into the emulsion and mixed with a Lightninâ¢<br>
agitator at 600 rpm. The pH was then adjusted to 4.5 with a<br>
10% aqueous acetic acid solution. During pH adjustment and<br>
the cooling step that followed pH adjustment, a coacervate<br>
formed from the gelatine and polyphosphate coated onto the<br>
oil droplets to form primary microcapsules. Cooling was<br>
carried out to above the gel point of the gelatine and<br>
polyphosphate and the primary microcapsules started to<br>
agglomerate to form lumps under agitation. Upon further<br>
cooling of the mixture, polymer remaining iri the aqueous<br>
phase further coated the lumps of primary microcapsules to<br>
form an encapsulated agglomeration of microcapsules having<br>
an outer shell and having an average size of 50 um. Once<br>
the temperature had been cooled to 5Â°C, 2.7 grams of 50%<br>
gluteraldehyde was added into the mixture to further<br>
strengthen the shell. The mixture was then warmed to room<br>
temperature and kept stirring for 12 hours. Finally, the<br>
microcapsule suspension was washed with water. The washed<br>
suspension was then spray dried to obtain a free-flowing<br>
powder. A payload of 62% was obtained.<br>
Example 2: A two-step process with gelatine and<br>
polyphosphate in both first and second shells, but having<br>
different compositions<br>
Step A: 15.6 grams gelatine 275 Bloom type A<br>
(isoelectric point of about 9) was mixed with 172 grams of<br>
deionized water containing 0.5% sodium ascorbate under<br>
agitation at 50Â°C until completely dissolved. 1.56 grams of<br>
sodium polyphosphate was dissolved in 29.7 grams of<br>
deionized water containing 0.5% sodium ascorbate. 69 grams<br>
of a fish oil concentrate containing 30% eicosapentaenoic<br>
acid ethyl ester (EPA) and 20% docosahexaenoic acid ethyl<br>
ester (DHA) (available from Ocean Nutrition Canada Ltd.) was<br>
dispersed with 1.0% of an antioxidant (mixed natural<br>
tocopherols) into the gelatine solution with a high speed<br>
Polytroriâ¢ homogenizer at 6,100 rpm for 4 minutes. An oilin-<br>
water emulsion was formed. The oil droplet size had a<br>
narrow distribution with an average size of about 1 |J,m<br>
measured by Coulterâ¢ LS230 Particle Size Analyzer. The<br>
emulsion was diluted with 319 grams of deionized water<br>
containing 0.5% sodium ascorbate at 50Â°C. The sodium<br>
polyphosphate solution was then added into the emulsion and<br>
mixed with a Lightninâ¢ agitator at 600 rpm. The pH was then<br>
adjusted to 4.5 with a 10% aqueous phosphoric acid solution.<br>
During pH adjustment and the cooling step that followed pH<br>
adjustment, a coacervate formed from the gelatine and<br>
polyphosphate coatesd^qnto the oil droplets to form primary<br>
microcapsules, and then the primary microcapsules started to<br>
agglomerate to form lumps under agitation. A payload of 80%<br>
was obtained at this step.<br>
Step B: A gelatine solution was prepared by<br>
dissolving 41.8 grams of gelatine 275 Bloom type A<br>
(isoelectric point of about 9) in 460 grams of deionized<br>
water containing 0.5% sodium ascorbate under agitation at<br>
50Â°C until completely dissolved. A sodium polyphosphate<br>
solution was prepared by dissolving 4.18 grams of sodium<br>
polyphosphate in 79.5 grams of deionized water containing<br>
0.5% sodium ascorbate. The gelatine and polyphosphate<br>
solutions were combined to form a mixture, arid pH of the<br>
mixture was adjusted to 4.7 with 10% aqueous phosphoric<br>
acid.<br>
Step C: The mixture from Step B was added to the<br>
mixture with lumps formed in step A. Cooling was carried<br>
out under agitation to cause the gelatine and polyphosphate<br>
to form coacervates and to coat the lumps formed in Step A<br>
to form ari outer shell. The microcapsules thus formed had<br>
an average size of 60 |j,m. Once the temperature had been<br>
cooled to 5Â°C, 2.1 grams of 50% gluteraldehyde was added into<br>
the mixture to further strengthen the shell. The mixture<br>
was then warmed to room temperature and stirred continuously<br>
for 12 hours. Finally, the microcapsule suspension was<br>
washed with water. The washed suspension was then spray<br>
dried to obtain a free-flowing powder. A payload of 59% was<br>
obtained.<br>
Example 3: A two-step process having gelatine and alginate<br>
in the second shell<br>
Step A: Same as Step A in Example 2.<br>
Step B: A gelatine solution was prepared by<br>
dissolving 23.0 grams of gelatine 275 Bloom type A<br>
(isoelectric point of about 9) in 371 grams of deionized<br>
water under1 agitation at 50Â°C until completely dissolved. A<br>
sodium alginate (ISP Alginates) solution was prepared by<br>
dissolving 3.00 grams of sodium alginate in 503.8 grams of<br>
deionized water. The gelatine and sodium alginate solutions<br>
were combined to form a mixture. The pH of the mixture was<br>
adjusted to 5.00 with 10% aqueous phosphoric acid.<br>
Step C: The mixture from Step B was added to the<br>
mixture with lumps formed in step A. Cooling was carried<br>
out under agitation to cause gelatine and alginate to form<br>
coacervates and coat the lumps formed in Step A to form an<br>
outer shell. The microcapsules thus formed had an average<br>
size of around 80 um. Once the temperature had been cooled<br>
to 5Â°C, 2.1 grams of 50% gluteraldehyde was added into the<br>
mixture to further strengthen the shell. The mixture was<br>
then warmed to room temperature and stirred continuously for<br>
12 hours. Finally, the microcapsule suspension was washed<br>
with water. The washed suspension was then spray dried to<br>
obtain a free-flowing powder. A payload of 53% was<br>
obtained.<br>
Example 4: A three-step process to incorporate wax and<br>
alginate in the second shell and alginate in the third<br>
shell.<br>
Step A: 20.0 grams gelatine 275 Bloom type A<br>
(isoelectric point of about 9) was mixed with 220.1 grams of<br>
deionized water containing 0.5% sodium ascorbate under<br>
agitation at 50Â°C until completely dissolved. 2.00 grams of<br>
sodium polyphosphate was dissolved in 38.0 grams of<br>
deionized water. 88.0 grams of a fish oil concentrate<br>
containing 30% eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester (EPA) and<br>
20% docosahexaenoic acid ethyl ester (DHA) (available from<br>
Ocean Nutrition Canada Ltd.) was dispersed with 1.0% of an<br>
antioxidant (mixed natural tocopherols) into the gelatine<br>
solution with a high speed Polytronâ¢ homogenizer at 6,100<br>
rpm for 4 minutes. An oil-in-water emulsion was formed.<br>
The oil droplet size had a narrow distribution with an<br>
average size of about 1 |j.m measured by Coulterâ¢ LS230<br>
Particle Size Analyzer. The emulsion was diluted with 408.6<br>
grams of deionized water at 50Â°C. The sodium polyphosphate<br>
solution was then added into the emulsion and mixed with a<br>
Lightninâ¢ agitator at 600 rpm. The pH was then adjusted to<br>
4.5 with a 10% aqueous phosphoric acid solution. During pH<br>
adjustment and the cooling step that followed pH adjustment,<br>
a coacervate formed from the gelatine and polyphosphate<br>
coated onto the oil droplets to form primary microcapsules,<br>
and then the primary microcapsules started to agglomerate to<br>
form lumps under agitation. A payload of 80% was obtained<br>
at this step.<br>
Step B: A gelatine solution was prepared by<br>
dissolving 8.6 grams of gelatine 275 Bloom type A<br>
(isoelectric point of about 9) in 94.5 grams of deionized<br>
water under agitation at 65Â°C until completely dissolved.<br>
25.8 grams of beeswax melted at 65Â°C was emulsified in the<br>
gelatine solution with a high speed Polytronâ¢ homogenizer at<br>
6,100 rpm for 4 minutes. A wax-in-water emulsion was<br>
formed. An alginate solution was prepared by dissolving 2.3<br>
grams of sodium alginate in 192 grams of deionized water was<br>
added to the emulsion, and pH of the mixture was adjusted to<br>
4.7 with 10% aqueous phosphoric acid. The mixture was then<br>
added into lump mixtures in step A under agitation at 800<br>
rpm, and cooling was carried out to cause the gelatinealginate-<br>
wax composite material to form a coating onto the<br>
lumps formed in Step A to form microcapsules. A payload of<br>
60% was obtained at this step.<br>
Step C: A solution was prepared by dissolving 23.1<br>
grama of gelatine and 2.3 grams of sodium alginate in 384.9<br>
grams of deionized water under agitation at 50Â°C until<br>
completely dissolved. pH of the mixture was adjusted to 4.5<br>
with 10% aqueous phosphoric acid, and the mixture was then<br>
added into microcapsule mixtures formed in step B under<br>
agitation at 800 rpm. Cooling was carried out to cause the<br>
gelatine-alginate material to form a coating onto the<br>
microcapsules that formed in Step B. Once the temperature<br>
had been cooled to 5Â°C, 1.5 grams of transglutaminase was<br>
added into the mixture to cross-link the shell. The mixture<br>
was then warmed to room temperature and kept stirring for 12<br>
hours. Finally, the microcapsule suspension was spray dried<br>
to obtain a free-flowing powder. A final payload of 52% was<br>
obtained.<br>
Example 5: A two-step process of multicore microcapsules<br>
having wax and alginate in the second shell.<br>
Step A: 13.0 grams of gelatine 275 Bloom type A<br>
(isoelectric point of about 9) was mixed with 143.0 grams of<br>
deionized water containing 0.5% sodium ascorbate under<br>
agitation at 50Â°C until completely dissolved. 1.3 grams of<br>
sodium polyphosphate was dissolved in 24.7 grams of<br>
deionized water. 57.2 grams of fish oil containing 18%<br>
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 12% docosahexaenoic acid<br>
(DMA) (available from Ocean Nutrition Canada Ltd.) was<br>
dispersed with 1.0% of an antioxidant (mixed natural<br>
tocopherols) into the gelatine solution with a high speed<br>
Polytronâ¢ homogenizer at 8,000 rpm for 4 minutes. An oilin-<br>
water emulsion was formed. The oil droplet size had a<br>
narrow distribution with an average size of about 1 jam<br>
measured by Coxilterâ¢ LS230 Particle Size Analyzer. The<br>
emulsion was diluted with 266.0 grams of deionized water at<br>
50Â°C. The sodium polyphosphate solution was then added into<br>
the emulsion and mixed with a Lightninâ¢ agitator at 350 rpm.<br>
The pH was then adjusted to 4.4 with a 10% aqueous<br>
phosphoric acid solution. During pH adjustment and the<br>
cooling step that followed pH adjustment, a coacervate<br>
formed from the gelatine and polyphosphate coated onto the<br>
oil droplets to form primary microcapsules, and then the<br>
primary microcapsules started to agglomerate to form lumps<br>
under agitation. A payload of 80% was obtained at this<br>
step.<br>
Step B: A gelatine solution was prepared by<br>
dissolving 7.05 grams of gelatine 275 Bloom type A<br>
(isoelectric point of about 9) in 77.9 grams of deionized<br>
water under agitation at 70Â°C until completely dissolved.<br>
7.05 grams of beeswax melted at 70Â°C was emulsified in the<br>
i<br>
gelatine solution with a high speed Polytronâ¢ homogenizer at<br>
8,000 rpm for 4 minutes. A wax-in-water emulsion was<br>
formed. An alginate solution (45 Â°C) was prepared by<br>
dissolving 7.62 grams of sodium alginate in 630 grams of<br>
deionized water was added to the emulsion, and pH of the<br>
mixture was adjusted to 5.3 with 10% aqueous phosphoric<br>
acid. The mixture was then added into lump mixtures in step<br>
A under agitation at 450 rpm followed by adjusting the pH<br>
value of the mixture to 4.9, and cooling was carried out to<br>
cause the gelatine-alginate-wax composite material to form a<br>
coating onto the lumps formed in Step A to form<br>
microcapsules. Once the temperature had been lowered to 5Â°C,<br>
3.8 grams of transglutaminase was added into the mixture to<br>
cross-link the shells. The mixture was then warmed up to<br>
room temperature and stirred at 600 rpm for 12 hours.<br>
Finally, the microcapsule suspension was spray dried to<br>
obtain a free-flowing powder. A final payload of 57% was<br>
obtained.<br>
Example 6: Evaluation of microcapsules<br>
Images of microcapsules of Examples 1-5 are shown<br>
in Figures 6 to Figure 10, respectively. It can be seen<br>
clearly that at approximately the same payload (60%) the<br>
microcapsules prepared with a two step process (Figure 7)<br>
have much thicker outer shells than those prepared with one<br>
step process (Figure 6). The microcapsules prepared with a<br>
three step process having a composite shell containing<br>
lipids (Figure 9) clearly show the lipid droplets<br>
incorporated in the second shell and near the agglomerated<br>
oil core.<br>
Accelerated oxidative stability in dry state was<br>
evaluated by placing the prepared microcapsule powders from<br>
each of Examples 1-4 in an oxygen bomb (Oxipresâ¢, MIKROLAB<br>
AARHUS A/S, Denmark) with an initial oxygen pressure of 5<br>
bar at a constant temperature of 65Â°C. When the encapsulated<br>
fish oil started to oxidize, the oxygen pressure dropped,<br>
and an induction period or time was determined. A longer<br>
induction period means that the contents of the<br>
microcapsules are better protected towards oxidation.<br>
Induction periods are shown in Table 1. The<br>
microcapsules made from a two-step process in accordance<br>
with the invention have higher induction period (50-56<br>
hours) than those made from a one-step process (41 hours) .<br>
This translates to 22.0% to 37.6% increase in oxidative<br>
stability.<br>
