FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods and compositions for the inhibition of gene expression. In particular, the present invention provides oligonucleotide-based therapeutics for the inhibition of oncogenes involved in cancers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Oncogenes have become the central concept in understanding cancer biology and may provide valuable targets for therapeutic drugs. All oncogenes and their products operate inside the cell. This makes protein-based drugs ineffective since their specificity involves ligand-receptor recognition.<br>
Antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides (oligonucleotides) are under investigation of therapeutic compound for specifically targeting oncogenes (Wickstrom, E. (ed). Prospects for antisense nucleic acid therapy of cancer and Aids. New York: Wiley-Liss, Inc. 1991; Murray, J. A. H. (ed). Antisense RNA and DNA New York: Wiley-Liss, Inc. 1992). Antisense drugs are modified synthetic oligonucleotides that work by interfering with ribosomal translation of the target mRNA. The antisense drugs developed thus far destroy the targeted mRNA by binding to it and triggering ribonuclease H (RNase H) degradation of mRNA. Oligonucleotides have a half-life of about 20 minutes and they are therefore rapidly degraded in most cells (Fisher, T. L. etal, Nucleic Acids Res. 21:3857-3865 (1993)). To increase the stability of oligonucleotides, they are often chemically modified, e.g., they are protected by a sulfur replacing one of the phosphate oxygens in the backbone (phosphorothioate) (Milligan, J. F. et al, J. Med. Chem. 36:1923-1937 (1993); Wagner, R. W. etal., Science 260:1510-1513 (1993)). However, this modification can only slow the degradation of antisense and therefore large dosages of antisense drug are required to be effective.<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
Despite the optimism surrounding the use of antisense therapies, there are a number of serious problems with the use of antisense drugs such as difficulty in getting a sufficient amount of antisense into the cell, non-sequence-specific effects, toxicity due to the large amount of sulfur containing phosphothioates oligonucleotides and their inability to get into their target cells, and high cost due to continuous delivery of large doses. An additional problem with antisense drugs has been their nonspecific activities.<br>
What is needed are additional non-protein based cancer therapeutics that target oncogenes. Therapeutics that are effective in low doses and that are non-toxic to the subject are particularly needed.<br>

DEFINITIONS<br>
To facilitate an understanding of the present invention, a number of terms and<br>
phrases are defined below:<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
As used herein, the term "wherein said chemotherapy agent is present at less than one half the standard dose" refers to a dosage that is less than one half (e.g., less than 50%, preferably less than 40%, even more preferably less than 10% and still more preferably less than 1%) of the minimum value of the standard dosage range used for dosing humans. In some embodiments, the standard dosage range is the dosage range recommended by the manufacturer. In other embodiments, the standard dosage range is the range utilized by a medical doctor in the field. In still other embodiments, the standard dosage range is the range considered the normal standard of care in the field. The particular dosage within the dosage range is determined, for example by the age, weight, and health of the subject as well as the type of cancer being treated.<br>
As used herein, the term "under conditions such that expression of said gene is inhibited" refers to conditions where an oligonucleotide of the present invention hybridizes to a gene (e.g., the promoter region of the gene) and inhibits transcription of the gene by at least 10%, preferably at least 25%, even more preferably at least 50%, and still more preferably at least 90% relative to the level of transcription in the absence of the oligonucleotide. The present invention is not limited to the inhibition of expression of a particular gene. Exemplary genes include, but are not limited to, c-ki-Ras, c-Ha-ras, c-myc, her-2, TGF-#a, and bcl-2.<br>
As used herein, the term "under conditions such that growth of said cell is reduced" refers to conditions where an oligonucleotide of the present invention, when administered to a cell (e.g., a cancer) reduces the rate of growth of the cell by at least 10%, preferably at least 25%, even more preferably at least 50%, and still more preferably at least 90% relative to the rate of growth of the cell in the absence of the oligonucleotide.<br>
The term "epitope" as used herein refers to that portion of an antigen that makes contact with a particular antibody.<br>
When a protein or fragment of a protein is used to immunize a host animal, numerous regions of the protein may induce the production of antibodies which bind specifically to a given region or three-dimensional structure on the protein; these regions or structures are referred to as "antigenic determinants". An antigenic determinant may compete with the intact antigen (i.e., the "immunogen" used to elicit the immune response) for binding to an antibody.<br>
As used herein, the term "subject" refers to any animal (e.g., a mammal), including, but not limited to, humans, non-human primates, rodents, and the like, which is to be the<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
recipient of a particular treatment. Typically, the terms "subject" and "patient" are used interchangeably herein in reference to a human subject.<br>
As used herein, the terms "computer memory" and "computer memory device" refer to any storage media readable by a computer processor. Examples of computer memory include, but are not limited to, RAM, ROM, computer chips, digital video disc (DVDs), compact discs (CDs), hard disk drives (HDD), and magnetic tape.<br>
As used herein, the term "computer readable medium" refers to any device or system for storing and providing information (e.g., data and instructions) to a computer processor. Examples of computer readable media include, but are not limited to, DVDs, CDs, hard disk drives, magnetic tape and servers for streaming media over networks.<br>
As used herein, the terms "processor" and "central processing unit" or "CPU" are used interchangeably and refer to a device that is able to read a program from a computer memory (e.g., ROM or other computer memory) and perform a set of steps according to the program.<br>
As used herein, the term "non-human animals" refers to all non-human animals including, but are not limited to, vertebrates such as rodents, non-human primates, ovines, bovines, ruminants, lagomorphs, porcines, caprines, equines, canines, felines, aves, etc. and and non-vertebrate animals such as drosophila and nematode. In some embodiments, "non-human animals" further refers to prokaryotes and viruses such as bacterial pathogens, viral pathogens.<br>
As used herein, the term "nucleic acid molecule" refers to any nucleic acid containing molecule, including but not limited to, DNA or RNA. The term encompasses sequences that include any of the known base analogs of DNA and RNA including, but not limited to, 4-acetylcytosine, 8-hydroxy-N6-methyIadenosine, aziridinylcytosine, pseudoisocytosine, 5-(carboxyhydroxyImethyl) uracil, 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouracil, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyluracil, dihydrouracil, inosine, N6-isopentenyladenine, 1-methyladenine, 1-methylpseudouracil, 1-methylguanine, 1-methylinosine, 2,2-dimethylguanine, 2-methyladenine, 2-methylguanine, 3-methylcytosine, 5-methylcytosine, N6-methyladenine, 7-methylguanine, 5-methylaminomethyluracil, 5-methoxyaminomethyl-2-thiouracil, beta-D-mannosylqueosine, 5'-methoxycarbonylmethyluracil, 5-methoxyuracil, 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyIadenine, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methylester, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid, oxybutoxosine, pseudouracil, queosine, 2-thiocytosine, 5-methyl-<br>
2-thiouraciI, 2-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil, 5-methyluracil, N-uracil-5-oxyacetic acid<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
methylester, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid, pseudouracil, queosine, 2-thiocytosine, and 2,6-diaminopurine.<br>
The term "gene" refers to a nucleic acid (e.g., DNA) sequence that comprises coding sequences necessary for the production of a polypeptide, precursor, or RNA (e.g., rRNA, tRNA). The polypeptide can be encoded by a full length coding sequence or by any portion of the coding sequence so long as the desired activity or functional properties (e.g., enzymatic activity, ligand binding, signal transduction, immunogenicity, etc.) of the full-length or fragment are retained. The term also encompasses the coding region of a structural gene and the sequences located adjacent to the coding region on both the 5' and 3' ends for a distance of about 1 kb or more on either end such that the gene corresponds to the length of the full-length mRNA. Sequences located 5' of the coding region and present on the mRNA are referred to as 5' non-translated sequences. Sequences located 3' or downstream of the coding region and present on the mRNA are referred to as 3' non-translated sequences. The term "gene" encompasses both cDNA and genomic forms of a gene. A genomic form or clone of a gene contains the coding region interrupted with non-coding sequences termed "introns" or "intervening regions" or "intervening sequences." Introns are segments of a gene that are transcribed into nuclear RNA (hnRNA); introns may contain regulatory elements such as enhancers. Introns are removed or "spliced out" from the nuclear or primary transcript; introns therefore are absent in the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript. The mRNA functions during translation to specify the sequence or order of amino acids in a nascent polypeptide.<br>
As used herein, the term "heterologous gene" refers to a gene that is not in its natural environment. For example, a heterologous gene includes a gene from one species introduced into another species. A heterologous gene also includes a gene native to an organism that has been altered in some way (e.g., mutated, added in multiple copies, linked to non-native regulatory sequences, etc). Heterologous genes are distinguished from endogenous genes in that the heterologous gene sequences are typically joined to DNA sequences that are not found naturally associated with the gene sequences in the chromosome or are associated with portions of the chromosome not found in nature (e.g., genes expressed in loci where the gene is not normally expressed).<br>
As used herein, the term "gene expression" refers to the process of converting genetic information encoded in a gene into RNA (e.g., mRNA, rRNA, tRNA, or snRNA) through "transcription" of the gene (i.e., via the enzymatic action of an RNA polymerase),<br>
and for protein encoding genes, into protein through "translation" of mRNA. Gene<br>
28<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
expression can be regulated at many stages in the process. "Up-regulation" or "activation" refers to regulation that increases the production of gene expression products (i.e., RNA or protein), while "down-regulation" or "repression" refers to regulation that decrease production. Molecules (e.g., transcription factors) that are involved in up-regulation or down-regulation are often called "activators" and "repressors," respectively.<br>
In addition to containing introns, genomic forms of a gene may also include sequences located on both the 5' and 3' end of the sequences that are present on the RNA transcript. These sequences are referred to as "flanking" sequences or regions (these flanking sequences are located 5' or 3' to the non-translated sequences present on the mRNA transcript). The 5' flanking region may contain regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers that control or influence the transcription of the gene. The 3' flanking region may contain sequences that direct the termination of transcription, post-transcriptional cleavage and polyadenylation.<br>
The term "wild-type" refers to a gene or gene product isolated from a naturally occurring source. A wild-type gene is that which is most frequently observed in a population and is thus arbitrarily designed the "normal" or "wild-type" form of the gene. In contrast, the term "modified" or "mutant" refers to a gene or gene product that displays modifications in sequence and or functional properties (i.e., altered characteristics) when compared to the wild-type gene or gene product. It is noted that naturally occurring mutants can be isolated; these are identified by the fact that they have altered characteristics (including altered nucleic acid sequences) when compared to the wild-type gene or gene product.<br>
As used herein, the terms "nucleic acid molecule encoding," "DNA sequence encoding," and "DNA encoding" refer to the order or sequence of deoxyribonucleotides along a strand of deoxyribonucleic acid. The order of these deoxyribonucleotides determines the order of amino acids along the polypeptide (protein) chain. The DNA sequence thus codes for the amino acid sequence.<br>
As used herein, the terms "an oligonucleotide having a nucleotide sequence encoding a gene" and "polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence encoding a gene," means a nucleic acid sequence comprising the coding region of a gene or in other words the nucleic acid sequence that encodes a gene product. The coding region may be present in a cDNA, genomic DNA or RNA form. When present in a DNA form, the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide may be single-stranded (i.e., the sense strand) or double-stranded. Suitable<br>
control elements such as enhancers/promoters, splice junctions, polyadenylation signals, etc.<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
may be placed in close proximity to the coding region of the gene if needed to permit proper initiation of transcription and/or correct processing of the primary RNA transcript. Alternatively, the coding region utilized in the expression vectors of the present invention may contain endogenous enhancers/promoters, splice junctions, intervening sequences, polyadenylation signals, etc. or a combination of both endogenous and exogenous control elements.<br>
As used herein, the term "oligonucleotide," refers to a short length of single-stranded polynucleotide chain. Oligonucleotides are typically less than 200 residues long (e.g., between 8 and 100), however, as used herein, the term is also intended to encompass longer polynucleotide chains (e.g., as large as 5000 residues). Oligonucleotides are often referred to by their length. For example a 24 residue oligonucleotide is referred to as a "24-mer". Oligonucleotides can form secondary and tertiary structures by self-hybridizing or by hybridizing to other polynucleotides. Such structures can include, but are not limited to, duplexes, hairpins, cruciforms, bends, and triplexes.<br>
In some embodiments, oligonucleotides are "antigenes." As used herein, the term "antigene" refers to an oligonucleotide that hybridizes to the promoter region of a gene. In some embodiments, the hybridization of the antigene to the promoter inhibits expression of the gene.<br>
As used herein, the terms "complementary" or "complementarity" are used in reference to polynucleotides (i.e., a sequence of nucleotides) related by the base-pairing rules. For example, for the sequence "A-G-T," is complementary to the sequence "T-C-A." Complementarity may be "partial," in which only some of the nucleic acids' bases are matched according to the base pairing rules. Or, there may be "complete" or "total" complementarity between the nucleic acids. The degree of complementarity between nucleic acid strands has significant effects on the efficiency and strength of hybridization between nucleic acid strands. This is of particular importance in amplification reactions, as well as detection methods that depend upon binding between nucleic acids.<br>
As used herein, the term "completely complementary," for example when used in reference to an oligonucleotide of the present invention refers to an oligonucle
As used herein, the term "partially complementary," for example when used in reference to an oligonucleotide of the present invention, refers to an oligonuclestide where at least one nucleotide is not complementary to the target sequence. Preferred partially<br>
complementary oligonucleotides are those that can still hybridize to the target sequence<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
under physiological conditions. The term "partially complementary" refers to oligonucleotides that have regions of one or more non-complementary nucleotides both internal to the oligonucleotide or at either end. Oligonucleotides with mismatches at the ends may still hybridize to the target sequence.<br>
The term "homology" refers to a degree of complementarity. There may be partial homology or complete homology (i.e., identity). A partially complementary sequence is a nucleic acid molecule that at least partially inhibits a completely complementary nucleic acid molecule from hybridizing to a target nucleic acid is "substantially homologous." The inhibition of hybridization of the completely complementary sequence to the target sequence may be examined using a hybridization assay (Southern or Northern blot, solution hybridization and the like) under conditions of low stringency. A substantially homologous sequence or probe will compete for and inhibit the binding (i.e., the hybridization) of a completely homologous nucleic acid molecule to a target under conditions of low stringency. This is not to say that conditions of low stringency are such that non-specific binding is permitted; low stringency conditions require that the binding of two sequences to one another be a specific (i.e., selective) interaction. The absence of non-specific binding may be tested by the use of a second target that is substantially non-complementary (e.g., less than about 30% identity); in the absence of non-specific binding the probe will not hybridize to the second non-complementary target.<br>
When used in reference to a double-stranded nucleic acid sequence such as a cDNA or genomic clone, the term "substantially homologous" refers to any probe that can hybridize to either or both strands of the double-stranded nucleic acid sequence under conditions of low stringency as described above.<br>
A gene may produce multiple RNA species that are generated by differential splicing of the primary RNA transcript. cDNAs that are splice variants of the same gene will contain regions of sequence identity or complete homology (representing the presence of the same exon or portion of the same exon on both cDNAs) and regions of complete non-identity (for example, representing the presence of exon "A" on cDNA 1 wherein cDNA 2 contains exon "B" instead). Because the two cDNAs contain regions of sequence identity they will both hybridize to a probe derived from the entire gene or portions of the gene containing sequences found on both cDNAs; the two splice variants are therefore substantially homologous to such a probe and to each other.<br>
When used in reference to a single-stranded nucleic acid sequence, the term "substantially homologous" refers to any probe that can hybridize (i.e., it is the complement<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
of) the single-stranded nucleic acid sequence under conditions of low stringency as described above.<br>
As used herein, the term "hybridization" is used in reference to the pairing of complementary nucleic acids. Hybridization and the strength of hybridization {i.e., the strength of the association between the nucleic acids) is impacted by such factors as the degree of complementary between the nucleic acids, stringency of the conditions involved, the Tm of the formed hybrid, and the G:C ratio within the nucleic acids. A single molecule that contains pairing of complementary nucleic acids within its structure is said to be "self-hybridized."<br>
As used herein, the term "Tm" is used in reference to the "melting temperature." The<br>
melting temperature is the temperature at which a population of double-stranded nucleic acid molecules becomes half dissociated into single strands. The equation for calculating the Tm of nucleic acids is well known in the art. As indicated by standard references, a simple estimate of the Tm value may be calculated by the equation: Tm = 81.5 + 0.41(% G + C), when a nucleic acid is in aqueous solution at 1 M NaCl (See e.g., Anderson and Young, Quantitative Filter Hybridization, in Nucleic Acid Hybridization [1985]). Other references include more sophisticated computations that take structural as well as sequence characteristics into account for the calculation of Tm.<br>
As used herein the term "stringency" is used in reference to the conditions of temperature, ionic strength, and the presence of other compounds such as organic solvents, under which nucleic acid hybridizations are conducted. Under "low stringency conditions" a nucleic acid sequence of interest will hybridize to its exact complement, sequences with single base mismatches, closely related sequences (e.g., sequences with 90% or greater homology), and sequences having only partial homology (e.g., sequences with 50-90% homology). Under "medium stringency conditions," a nucleic acid sequence of interest will hybridize only to its exact complement, sequences with single base mismatches, and closely relation sequences (e.g., 90% or greater homology). Under "high stringency conditions," a nucleic acid sequence of interest will hybridize only to its exact complement, and (depending on conditions such a temperature) sequences with single base mismatches. In other words, under conditions of high stringency the temperature can be raised so as to exclude hybridization to sequences with single base mismatches.<br>
"High stringency conditions" when used in reference to nucleic acid hybridization comprise conditions equivalent to binding or hybridization at 42°C in a solution consisting<br>
32<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
of 5X SSPE (43.8 g/1 NaCl, 6.9 g/1 NaH2PO4 H2O and 1.85 g/1 EDTA, pH adjusted to 7.4<br>
with NaOH), 0.5% SDS, 5X Denhardt's reagent and 100 µg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA followed by washing in a solution comprising 0.1X SSPE, 1.0% SDS at 42°C when a probe of about 500 nucleotides in length is employed.<br>
"Medium stringency conditions" when used in reference to nucleic acid hybridization comprise conditions equivalent to binding or hybridization at 42°C in a solution consisting of 5X SSPE (43.8 g/1 NaCl, 6.9 g/1 NaH2PO4 H2O and 1.85 g/1 EDTA, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH), 0.5% SDS, 5X Denhardt's reagent and 100 µg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA followed by washing in a solution comprising 1.0X SSPE, 1.0% SDS at 42°C when a probe of about 500 nucleotides in length is employed.<br>
"Low stringency conditions" comprise conditions equivalent to binding or hybridization at 42°C in a solution consisting of 5X SSPE (43.8 g/1 NaCl, 6.9 g/1 NaH2PO4 H2O and 1.85 g/1 EDTA, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH), 0.1% SDS, 5X Denhardt's reagent [50X Denhardt's contains per 500 ml: 5 g Ficoll (Type 400, Pharamcia), 5 g BSA (Fraction V; Sigma)] and 100 µg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA followed by washing in a solution comprising 5X SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 42°C when a probe of about 500 nucleotides in length is employed.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the hybridization of probes of about 500 nucleotides in length. The present invention contemplates the use of probes between approximately 8 nucleotides up to several thousand (e.g., at least 5000) nucleotides in length. One skilled in the relevant understands that stringency conditions may be altered for probes of other sizes (See e.g., Anderson and Young, Quantitative Filter Hybridization, in Nucleic Acid Hybridization [1985] and Sam brook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press, NY [1989]).<br>
The art knows well that numerous equivalent conditions may be employed to comprise low stringency conditions; factors such as the length and nature (DNA, RNA, base composition) of the probe and nature of the target (DNA, RNA, base composition, present in solution or immobilized, etc.) and the concentration of the salts and other components (e.g., the presence or absence of formamide, dextran sulfate, polyethylene glycol) are considered and the hybridization solution may be varied to generate conditions of low stringency hybridization different from, but equivalent to, the above listed conditions. In addition, the art knows conditions that promote hybridization under conditions of high<br>
33<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
stringency (e.g., increasing the temperature of the hybridization and/or wash steps, the use of formamide in the hybridization solution, etc.) (see definition above for "stringency").<br>
As used herein, the term "physiological conditions" refers to specific stringency conditions that approximate or are conditions inside an animal (e.g., a human). Exemplary physiological conditions for use in vitro include, but are not limited to, 37°C, 95% air, 5% CO2, commercial medium for culture of mammalian cells (e.g., DMEM media available from Gibco, MD), 5-10% serum (e.g., calf serum or horse serum), additional buffers, and optionally hormone (e.g., insulin and epidermal growth factor).<br>
The term "isolated" when used in relation to a nucleic acid, as in "an isolated oligonucleotide" or "isolated polynucleotide" refers to a nucleic acid sequence that is identified and separated from at least one component or contaminant with which it is ordinarily associated in its natural source. Isolated nucleic acid is such present in a form or setting that is different from that in which it is found in nature. In contrast, non-isolated nucleic acids as nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA found in the state they exist in nature. For example, a given DNA sequence (e.g., a gene) is found on the host cell chromosome in proximity to neighboring genes; RNA sequences, such as a specific mRNA sequence encoding a specific protein, are found in the cell as a mixture with numerous other mRNAs that encode a multitude of proteins. However, isolated nucleic acid encoding a given protein includes, by way of example, such nucleic acid in cells ordinarily expressing the given protein where the nucleic acid is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells, or is otherwise flanked by a different nucleic acid sequence than that found in nature. The isolated nucleic acid, oligonucleotide, or polynucleotide may be present in single-stranded or double-stranded form. When an isolated nucleic acid, oligonucleotide or polynucleotide is to be utilized to express a protein, the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide will contain at a minimum the sense or coding strand (i.e., the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide may be single-stranded), but may contain both the sense and anti-sense strands (i.e., the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide may be double-stranded).<br>
As used herein, the term "purified" or "to purify" refers to the removal of components (e.g., contaminants) from a sample. For example, antibodies are purified by removal of contaminating non-immunoglobulin proteins; they are also purified by the removal of immunoglobulin that does not bind to the target molecule. The removal of non-immunoglobulin proteins and/or the removal of immunoglobulins that do not bind to the target molecule results in an increase in the percent of target-reactive immunoglobulins in the sample. In another example, recombinant polypeptides are expressed in bacterial host<br>

The term "Northern blot," as used herein refers to the analysis of RNA by electrophoresis of RNA on agarose gels to fractionate the RNA according to size followed by transfer of the RNA from the gel to a solid support, such as nitrocellulose or a nylon membrane. The immobilized RNA is then probed with a labeled probe to detect RNA species complementary to the probe used. Northern blots are a standard tool of molecular biologists (J. Sambrook, et ai, supra, pp 7.39-7.52 [1989]).<br>
The term "Western blot" refers to the analysis of protein(s) (or polypeptides) immobilized onto a support such as nitrocellulose or a membrane. The proteins are run on acrylamide gels to separate the proteins, followed by transfer of the protein from the gel to a solid support, such as nitrocellulose or a nylon membrane. The immobilized proteins are then exposed to antibodies with reactivity against an antigen of interest.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods and compositions for the treatment of cancers. In particular, the present invention provides oligonucleotide-based therapeutics for the inhibition of oncogenes involved in a variety of cancers. The present invention is not limited to the treatment of a particular cancer. Any cancer can be targeted, including, but not limited to, breast cancers. The present invention is also not limited to the targeting of cancers or oncogenes. The methods and compositions of the present invention are suitable for use with any gene that it is desirable to inhibit the expression of (e.g., for therapeutic or research uses).<br>
I. Oncogene Targets<br>
In some embodiments, the present invention provides antigene inhibitors of oncogenes. The present invention is not limited to the inhibition of a particular oncogene. Indeed, the present invention encompasses antigene inhibitors to any number of oncogenes including, but not limited to, those disclosed herein.<br>
A. Ras<br>
One gene which has captured the attention of many scientists is the human proto-oncogene, c-Ha-ras. The nucleic acid sequence of the promoter region of c-H-ras is shown in Figure 7. This gene acts as a central dispatcher, relaying chemical signals into cells and controlling cell division. Ras gene alteration may cause the gene to stay in the "on" position. The ras oncogene is believed to underlie up to 30% of cancer, including colon cancer, lung cancer, bladder and mammary carcinoma (Bos, Cancer Res. 49:4682-4689 [1989]). The ras oncogene has therefore become a target for therapeutic drugs.<br>
There are several reports showing that oligonucleotides complementary to various sites of ras mRNA can inhibit synthesis of ras protein (p2l), which decreases the cell proliferation rate in cell culture (U.S. Pat. No. 5,576,208; U.S. Pat. No. 5,582,986; Daska et al., Oncogene Res. 5:267-275 [1990]; Brown et al., Oncogene Res. 4:243-252 [1989]; Saison-Behmoaras et al., EMBO J. 10:1111-1116 [1991)]. Oligonucleotides<br>
complementary to the 5' flanking region of the c-Ha-ras RNA transcript have shown to<br>
37<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
inhibit tumor growth in nude mice for up to 14 days (Gray et ai, Cancer Res. 53:577-580 [1993]). It was recently reported that an antisense oligonucleotide directed to a point mutation (G&gt;C) in codon 12 of the c-Ha-ras mRNA inhibited cell proliferation as well as tumor growth in nude mice when it was injected subcutaneously (U.S. Pat. No. 5,576,208; U.S. Pat. No. 5,582,986; Schwab et ai, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:10460-10464 [1994]; each of which is herein incorporated by reference). Researchers have also reported that antisense drugs shrank ovarian tumors in small clinical trials (Roush et ai, Science 276:1192-1194 [1997]).<br>
B. Her-2<br>
The HER-2 (also known as neu oncogene or erbB-2) oncogene encodes a receptor-like tyrosine kinase (RTK) that has been extensively investigated because of its role in several human carcinomas (Hynes and Stern, Biochim. et Biophy. Acta 1198:165-184 [1994]; Dougall et ai, Oncogene 9:2109-2123 [1994]) and in mammalian development (Lee et al., Nature 378:394-398 [1995]). The nucleic acid sequence of the promoter region of Her-2 is shown in Figure 3. The sequence of the HER-2 protein was determined from a cDNA that was cloned by homology to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mRNA from placenta (Coussens et ai, Science 230:1132-1139 [1985]) and from a gastric carcinoma cell line (Yamamoto et ai, Nature 319:230-234 [1986]). The HER-2 mRNA was shown to be about 4.5 kb (Coussens et ai, Science 230:1132-1139 [1985]; Yamamoto et ai, Nature 319:230-234 [1986]) and encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein of 185 kDa in normal and malignant human tissues (pl85HER-2) (Hynes and Steen, Biochim. et Biophys. Acta 1198:165-184 [1994]; Dougall etai, Oncogene9:2109-2123 [1994]). Overexpression of HER-2 causes phenotypic transformation of cultured cells (DiFiore et ai, Science 237:178-182 [1987]; Hudziak et ai, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:7159-7163 [1987]) and has been associated with aggressive clinical progression of breast and ovarian cancer (Slamonef al., Science 235:177-182 [1987]; S\d.monet ai, Science 244:707-712 [1989]).<br>
HER-2 is one of the most frequently altered genes in cancer. It encodes a transmembrane receptor (also known as pi85) with tyrosine kinase activity and is a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, and thus is related to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or HER-1). Aberrant HER-2 gene expression is present in a wide variety of cancers and are most common in breast, ovarian and gastric cancers. HER-2 is overexpressed in 25-30% of all human breast and ovarian cancers. Levels of HER-2<br>
overexpression correlate well with clinical stage of breast cancer, prognosis and metastatic<br>
38<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
potential. Overexpression of HER-2 is associated with lower survival rates, increased relapse rates and increased metastatic potential. Tan et al, (Cancer Res., 57:1199 [1997]) have shown that overexpression of the HER-2 gene increases the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells without increasing their transformation ability.<br>
Aberrant expression of HER-2 includes both increased expression of normal HER-2 and expression of mutant HER-2. Activation of the HER-2 proto-oncogene can occur by any of three mechanisms-point mutation, gene amplification and overexpression. Gene amplification is the most common mechanism. Unlike the other EGF family members for whom ligand activation is necessary for promoting transformation, overexpression of HER-2 alone is sufficient for transformation (Cohen, et al, J. Biol. Chem., 271:30897 [1996]).<br>
Several therapeutic approaches have been used to reduce levels of the HER-2 gene product. The adenovirus type 5 gene product El A has been studied as a potential therapeutic using a breast cancer model in nude mice. This gene product can repress HER-2/neu overexpression by repressing HER-2/neu promoter activity, and suppress the tumorigenic potential of HER-2/neu-overexpressing ovarian cancer cells. In mice bearing HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer xenografts, El A delivered either by adenovirus or liposome significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged mouse survival compared with the controls (Chang et al., Oncogene 14:561 [1997])<br>
Clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate a bispecific antibody which targets the extracellular domains of both the HER-2/neu protein product and Fc gamma Rffl (CD 16), the Fc gamma receptor expressed by human natural killer cells, neutrophils, and differentiated mononuclear phagocytes (Weiner et al., J. Hematotherapy, 4:471 [1995]).<br>
Overexpression of HER-2 has also been found to be associated with increased resistance to chemotherapy. Thus, patients with elevated levels of HER-2 respond poorly to many drugs. Methods used to inhibit HER-2 expression have been combined with commonly used chemotherapeutic agents (Ueno et al., Oncogone 15:953 [1997]). Combining the adenovirus type 5 gene product, El A, with taxol showed a synergistic effect in human breast cancer cells. Zhang et al., (Oncogene, 12:571 [1996]) demonstrated that emodin, a tyrosine-specific inhibitor, sensitized non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells to a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs, including cisplatin, doxorubicin and etoposide. A HER-2 antibody was found to increase the efficacy of tamoxifen in human breast cancer cells (Witters et al., Breast Cancer Res. and Treatment, 42:1 [1997]).<br>
Oligonucleotides have also been used to study the function of HER-2. A triplex-forming oligonucleotide targeted to the HER-2 promoter, 42 to 69 nucleotides upstream of<br>
39<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
the mRNA transcription start site was found to inhibit HER-2 expression in vitro (Ebbinghaus etal, J. Clin. Invest., 92:2433 [1993]). Porumb et al. (Cancer Res., 56:515 [1996]) also used a triplex-forming oligonucleotide targeted to the same HER-2 promoter region. Decreases in HER-2 mRNA and protein levels were seen in cultured cells. Juhl et al. (J. Biol. Chem., 272:29482 [1997]) used anti-HER-2 ribozymes targeted to a central region of the HER-2 RNA just downstream of the transmembrane region of the protein to demonstrate a reduction in HER-2 mRNA and protein levels in human ovarian cancer cells. A reduction in tumor growth in nude mice was also seen.<br>
An antisense approach has been used as a potential therapeutic for HER-2 overexpressing cancers. Pegues et al. (Cancer Lett., 117:73 [1997]) cloned a 1.5 kb fragment of HER-2 in an antisense orientation into an expression vector; transfecting of this construct into ovarian cancer cells resulted in a reduction of anchorage-independent growth. Casahni et al. (Int. J. Cancer 72:631 [1997]) used several human HER-2 antisense vector constructs, containing HER-2 fragments from 151 bp to 415 bp in length, to demonstrate reduction in HER-2 protein levels and anchorage-independent growth in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Colomer et al. (Br. J. Cancer, 70:819 [1994]) showed that phosphodiester antisense oligonucleotides targeted at or immediately downstream of, the translation initiation codon inhibited proliferation of human breast cancer cells by up to 60%. Wiechen et al. (Int. J. Cancer 63:604 [1995]) demonstrated that an 18-nucleotide phosphorothioate oligonucleotide targeted to the coding region, 33 nucleotides downstream of the translation initiation codon, of HER-2 reduced anchorage-independent growth of ovarian cancer cells. Bertram et al. (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 200:661 [1994]) used antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides targeted to the translation initiation region and a sequence at the 3' part of the translated region of the mRNA which has high homology to a tyrosine kinase consensus sequence, and demonstrated a 75% reduction in HER-2 protein levels in human breast cancer cells. Liu et al, (Antisense and Nucleic Acid Drug Develop., 6:9 [1996]) used antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides targeted to the 5' cap site and coding region. The most effective oligonucleotide, targeted to the 5' cap site, reduced HER-2 protein expression by 90%. Cell proliferation was also reduced by a comparable amount. Vaughn et al. (Nuc. Acids. Res., 24:4558 [1996]) used phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate and chimeric antisense oligonucleotides targeted at or adjacent to (either side) the translation initiation region of HER-2. An alternating dithioate/diester oligonucleotide targeted to the translation initiation region worked slightly<br>
better than an all phosphorothioate oligonucleotide. Brysch et al. (Cancer Gene Ther., 1: 99<br>
40<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
[1994]) used chemically modified antisense oligonucleotides targeted to the translation initiation codon of HER-2 to reduce protein levels and cause growth arrest of human breast cancer cell line.<br>
C.	C-Myc<br>
The c-myc gene product is encoded by an immediate early response gene, the expression of which can be induced by various mitogens. The nucleic acid sequence of the promoter region of the c-myc gene is shown in Figure 9. C-myc expression is involved in the signal transduction pathways leading to cell division. Studies have demonstrated that proliferating cells have higher levels of c-myc mRNA and c-myc protein than do quiescent cells. Antibodies directed against the human c-myc protein are known to inhibit DNA synthesis in nuclei isolated from human cells. Conversely, constitutive expression of c-myc produced by gene transfer inhibits induced differentiation of several cell lines. Constitutive expression of c-myc predisposes transgenic mice to the development of tumors.<br>
Some studies have suggested that the c-myc gene product may play a proliferative role in SMCs. Balloon de-endothelialization and injury of rat aortas is known to increase c-myc mRNA expression of vascular SMC prior to their subsequent proliferation and migration. Also, SMCs in culture proliferate when exposed to several mitogens, including PDGF, FGF, EGF, IGF-1 and to serum. Each of these mitogens has been found to be capable of increasing the expression in other cell lines of either c-myc protein, c-myc mRNA, or both. Additionally, blood serum has been found to increase c-myc mRNA levels in SMCs.<br>
Harel-Bellan et al. (J. Immun. 140; 2431-2435 (1988)) demonstrated that antisense oligonucleotides complementary to c-myc mRNA effectively inhibited the translation thereof in human T cells. These T cells were prevented from entering the S phase of cell division, c-myc proto-oncogene sequences are described in Marcu et al., Ann. Rev. Biochem., 61:809-860 [1992]; Watt et al., Nature, 303:725-728 [1983)]; Battey et al., Cell, 34:779-787 (1983); and Epstein et al, NTIS publication PB93-100576<br>
D.	Bcl2<br>
In many types of human tumors, including lymphomas and leukemias, the human bcl-2 gene is overexpressed, and may be associated with tumorigenicity (Tsujimoto et al., Science 228:1440-1443 [1985]). The nucleic acid sequence of the promoter region of bcl-2<br>
is shown in Figure 1. High levels of expression of the human bcl-2 gene have been found in<br>
41<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
all lymphomas with t (14; 18) chromosomal translations including most follicular B cell lymphomas and many large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. High levels of expression of the bcl-2 gene have also been found in certain leukemias that do not have a t(14; 18) chromosomal translation, including most cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia acute, many lymphocytic leukemias of the pre-B cell type, neuroblastomas, nasophryngeal carcinomas, and many adenocarcinomas of the prostate, breast, and colon. (Reed et al, Cancer Res. 51:6529 [1991]; Yunis et al, New England J. Med. 320:1047; Campos et al, Blood 81:3091-3096 [1993]; McDonnell et al, Cancer Res. 52:6940-6944 [1992); Lu et al, Int. J Cancer 53:29-35 [1993]; Bonneref a/., Lab Invest. 68:43A [1993]).<br>
E. TGF-#a<br>
Transforming Growth Factor Alpha (TGF-#a) is a polypeptide of 50 amino acids. The nucleic acid sequence of the TGF-#a promoter is shown in Figure 11. It was first isolated from a retrovirus-transformed mouse cell line and subsequently was identified in human tumor cells, in early rat embryo cells and in cell cultures from the human pituitary gland. TGF-#a is closely related to Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), both structurally and functionally, and both bind to the same receptor, i.e., Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR).<br>
The sequence and three dimensional structure of both EGF and TGF-#a have been determined (Campbell et al, Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1:13 [1989]). TGF-#a is a 50 amino acid polypeptide having about 40% homology of residues with EGF. Both peptides are characterized by three well defined loops (denoted A, B and C) and have three intramolecular disulphide bonds.<br>
Several growth factors, including TGF-#a and EGF, are believed to exert their biological effects via interaction with the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGF Receptor). The EGF Receptor is a Type 1 receptor tyrosine kinase. The EGF Receptor and its ligands are of interest for their roles in normal physiological processes as well as in hyperproliferative and neoplastic diseases.<br>
The in vivo precursor of TGF-#a is a 160 amino acid residue membrane-bound protein (pro-TGF-.alpha.) that is cleaved to yield a soluble compound (Massaguc, J. Biol. Chem., 265:21393-21396 [1990]). This cleavage removes an extracellular portion comprised of 50 amino acids with a molecular weight of 6 Kd and is considered to be an important regulatory event (Pandiella et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88:1726-1730<br>
42<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/0T8993<br>
[1990]) that can be stimulated by phorbol esters acting via protein kinase C (Pandiella et al, J. Biol. Chem., 266:5769-5773 [1991]).<br>
Cultured human prostatic tumor lines contain elevated levels of TGF-#amRNA and proliferate in response to TGF-#a (Wilding et al., The Prostate, 15:1 -12 [ 1989]). TGF-#a appears to have both autocrine and paracrine function, stimulating physiologic activities such as cell division and angiogenesis. When induced in transgenic mice, TGF-#a produced epithelial hyperplasia and focal dysplastic changes that resembled carcinoma in situ (Sandgren et al., Cell, 61:1121-1135 [1990]).<br>
F. c-ki-RAS<br>
The c-Ki-RAS (KRAS) oncogene is expressed ubiquitously. KRAS, with a length of more than 30 kb, is much larger than HRAS or NRAS. The sequence of the promoter region of c-ki-ras is shown in Figure 5. Although the 3 ras genes, HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS, have different genetic structures, all code for proteins of 189 amino acid residues, generically designated p21. These genes acquire malignant properties by single point mutations that affect the incorporation of the 12th or 61st amino acid residue of their respective p21. KRAS is involved in malignancy much more often than is HRAS. In a study of 96 human tumors or tumor cell lines in the NEH 3T3 transforming system, (Pulciani et al., Nature 300: 539 (1982) found a mutated HRAS locus only in T24 bladder cancer cells, whereas transforming KRAS genes were identified in 8 different carcinomas and sarcomas.<br>
In a serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary, Feig et al. {Science 223: 698 (1984)) showed the presence of an activated KRAS oncogene not activated in normal cells of the same patient. The transforming gene product displayed an electrophoretic mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gels that differed from the mobility of KRAS transforming proteins in other tumors. Thus, a previously undescribed mutation was responsible for activation of KRAS in this ovarian carcinoma. To study the role of oncogenes in lung cancer, Rodenhuis et al. {New Eng. J. Med. 317: 929 (1987)) used an assay based on oligonucleotide hybridization following an in vitro amplification step. Genomic DNA was examined from 39 tumor specimens obtained at thoracotomy. The KRAS gene was found to be activated by point mutations in codon 12 in 5 of 10 adenocarcinomas. Two of these tumors were less than 2 cm in size and had not metastasized. No HRAS, KRAS, or NRAS mutations were observed in 15 squamous cell carcinomas, 10 large cell carcinomas, 1 carcinoid, 2 metastatic<br>
adenocarcinomas from primary tumors outside the lung, and 1 small cell carcinoma. An<br>
43<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
approximately 20-fold amplification of the unmutated KRAS gene was observed in a tumor that proved to be a solitary lung metastasis of a rectal carcinoma. Yanez et al. (Oncogene 1:315 (1987)) found mutations in codon 12 of the KRAS gene in 4 of 16 colon cancers, 2 of 27 lung cancers, and 1 of 8 breast cancers; no mutations were found at position 61. Of the 6 possible amino acid replacements in codon 12, all but one were represented in the 7 mutations identified.<br>

II.	Non-Oncogene Targets<br>

The methods and compositions of the present invention find use in the targeting of any gene that it is desirable to down regulate the expression of. For example, in some embodiments, the genes to be targeted include, but are not limited to, an immunoglobulin or antibody gene, a clotting factor gene, a protease, a pituitary hormone, a protease inhibitor, a growth factor, a somatomedian, a gonadotrophin, a chemotactin, a chemokine, a plasma protein, a plasma protease inhibitor, an interleukin, an interferon, a cytokine, a transcription factor, or a pathogen target (e.g., a viral gene, a bacterial gene, a microbial gene, a fungal gene).<br>
Examples of specific genes include, but are not limited to, ADAMTS4, ADAMTS5, APOA1, APOE, APP, B2M, COX2, CRP, DDX25, DMC1, FKBP8, GH1, GHR, IAPP, IFNA1, EFNG, IL1, 1110, IL12, IL13, IL2, IL4, IL7, IL8, IPW, MAPK14, Meil, MMP13, MYD88, NDN, PACE4, PRNP, PSEN1, PSEN2, RAD51, RAD51C, SAP, SNRPN, TLR4, TLR9, TTR, UBE3A, VLA-4, and PTP-1B, c-RAF, m-TOR, LDL, VLDL, ApoB-100, HDL, VEGF, rhPDGF-BB, NADs, ICAM-1, MUC1, 2-dG, CTL, PSGL-1, E2F, NF-kB, HIF, and GCPRs.<br>

III.	DNA Methylation<br>
In some embodiments, the present invention provides oligonucleotide therapeutics that are methylated at specific sites. The present invention is not limited to a particular mechanism. Indeed, an understanding of the mechanism is not necessary to practice the present invention. Nonetheless, it is contemplated that one mechanism for the regulation of gene activity is methylation of cytosine residues in DNA. 5-methylcytosine (5-MeC) is the only naturally occurring modified base detected in DNA (Ehrlick et ai, Science 212:1350-1357 (1981)). Although not all genes are regulated by methylation, hypomethylation at specific sites or in specific regions in a number of genes is correlated with active transcription (Doerfler, Annu. Rev. Biochem. 52:93-124 [1984]; Christman, Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 108:49-78 [1988]; Cedar, Cell 34:5503-5513 [1988]). DNA<br>
methylation in vitro can prevent efficient transcription of genes in a cell-free system or<br>
45<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
transient expression of transfected genes. Methylation of C residues in some specific cis-regulatory regions can also block or enhance binding of transcriptional factors or repressors (Doerfier, supra; Christman, supra; Cedar, Cell 34:5503-5513 (1988); Tate et al, Curr. Opin. Genet, Dev. 3:225-231 [1993]; Christman et al, Virus Strategies, eds. Doerfier, W. &amp; Bohm, P. (VCH, Weinheim, N.Y.)pp. 319-333 [1993]).<br>
Disruption of normal patterns of DNA methylation has been linked to the development of cancer (Christman et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:7347-7351 [1995]). The 5-MeC content of DNA from tumors and tumor derived cell lines is generally lower than normal tissues (Jones et al, Adv. Cancer Res 40:1-30 [1983]). Hypomethylation of specific oncogenes such as c-rnyc, c-Ki-ras and c-Ha-ras has been detected in a variety of human and animal tumors (Nambu et al, Jpn. J. Cancer (Gann) 78:696-704 [1987]; Feinberg et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 111:: 47-54 [1983]; Cheah et al, JNCI73:1057-1063 [1984]; Bhavee/o/., Carcinogenesis (Lond) 9:343-348 [1988]. In one of the best studied examples of human tumor progression, it has been shown that hypomethylation of DNA is an early event in development of colon cancer (Goetz et al, Science 228:187-290 [1985]). Interference with methylation in vivo can lead to tumor formation. Feeding of methylation inhibitors such as L-methionine or 5-azacytodine or severe deficiency of 5-adenosine methionine through feeding of a diet depleted of lipotropes has been reported to induce formation of liver tumors in rats (Wainfan et al., Cancer Res. 52:2071s-2077s [1992]). Studies show that extreme lipotrope deficient diets can cause loss of methyl groups at specific sites in genes such as c-myc, ras and c-fos (Dizik et al, Carcinogenesis 12:1307-1312 [1991]). Hypomethylation occurs despite the presence of elevated levels of DNA MTase activity (Wainfan etal, Cancer Res. 49:4094-4097 [1989]). Genes required for sustained active proliferation become inactive as methylated during differentiation and tissue specific genes become hypomethylated and are active. Hypomethylation can then shift the balance between the two states. In some embodiment, the present invention thus takes advantage of this naturally occurring phenomena, to provide compositions and methods for site specific methylation of specific gene promoters, thereby preventing transcription and hence translation of certain genes. In other embodiments, the present invention provides methods and compositions for upregulating the expression of a gene of interest (e.g., a tumor suppressor gene) by altering the gene's methylation patterns.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the use of methylated oligonucleotides. Indeed, the use of non-methylated oligonucleotides for the inhibition of gene expression is<br>
specifically contemplated by the present invention. Experiments conducted during the<br>
46<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
course of development of the present invention (See e.g., Example 8) demonstrated that an unmethylated oligonucleotide targeted toward Bcl-2 inhibited the growth of lymphoma cells to a level that was comparable to that of a methylated oligonucleotide.<br>
IV. Oligonucleotides<br>
In some embodiments, the present invention provides antigene oligonucleotides for inhibiting the expression of oncogenes. Exemplary design and production strategies for antigenes are described below. The below description is not intended to limit the scope of antigene compounds suitable for use in the present invention. One skilled in the relevant recognizes that additional antigenes are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
A. Oiigonucleotide Design<br>
In some embodiments, oligonucleotides are designed based on preferred design criteria. Such oligonucleotides can then be tested for efficacy using the methods disclosed herein. For example, in some embodiments, the oligonucleotides are methylated at least one, preferably at least two, and even more preferably, all of the CpG islands. In other embodiments, the oligonucleotides contain no methylation. The present invention is not limited to a particular mechanism. Indeed, an understanding of the mechanism is not necessary to practice the present invention. Nonetheless, it is contemplated that preferred oligonucleotides are those that have at least a 50% GC content and at least 2 GC dinucleotides. It is preferred that oligonucleotides do not self hybridize. In some embodiments, oligonucleotides are designed with at least 1 A or T to minimize self hybridization. In some embodiments, commercially available computer programs are used to survey oligonucleotides for the ability to self hybridize. Preferred oligonucleotides are at least 10, and preferably at least 15 nucleotides and no more than 100 nucleotides in length. Particularly preferred oligonucleotides are 18-24 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, oligonucleotides comprise the universal protein binding sequences CGCCC and CGCG or the complements thereof.<br>
It is also preferred that the oligonucleotide hybridize to a promoter region of a gene upstream from the TATA box of the promoter. It is also preferred that oligonucleotide compounds are not completely homologous to other regions of the human genome. The homology of the oligonucleotide compounds of the present invention to other regions of the genome can be determined using available search tools (e.g., BLAST, available at the<br>
Internet site of NCBI).<br>
47<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
In some embodiments, oligonucleotides are designed to hybridize to regions of the promoter region of an oncogene known to be bound by proteins (e.g., transcription factors). Exemplary oligonucleotide compounds of the present invention are shown in Figures 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. The present invention is not limited to the oligonucleotides described herein. Other suitable oligonucleotides may be identified (e.g., using the criteria described above). Exemplary oligonucleotide variants of the disclosed oligonucleotides are shown in Figures 25-30. Candidate oligonucleotides may be tested for efficacy using any suitable method, including, but not limited to, those described in the illustrative examples below. Using the in vitro assay described in Examples 1 and 2 below, candidate oligonucleotides can be evaluated for their ability to prevent cell proliferation as a variety of concentrations. Particularly preferred oligonucleotides are those that inhibit gene expression of cell proliferation as a low concentration (e.g., less that 20 µM, and preferably, less than 10 µM in the in vitro assays disclosed herein).<br>
B. Preferred Oligonucleotide Zones<br>
In some embodiments, regions within the promoter region of an oncogene are further defined as preferred regions for hybridization of oligonucleotides. In some embodiments, these preferred regions are referred to as "hot zones."<br>
In some preferred embodiments, hot zones are defined based on oligonucleotide compounds that are demonstrated to be effective (see above section on oligonucleotides) and those that are contemplated to be effective based on the preferred criteria for oligonucleotides described above. Preferred hot zones encompass 10 bp upstream and downstream of each compound included in each hot zone and have at least 1 CG or more within an increment of 40 bp further upstream or downstream of each compound. In preferred embodiments, hot zones encompass a maximum of 100 bp upstream and downstream of each oligonucleotide compound included in the hot zone. In additional embodiments, hot zones are defined at beginning regions of each promoter. These hot zones are defined either based on effective sequence(s) or contemplated sequences and have a preferred maximum length of 200 bp. Based on the above described criteria, exemplary hot zones were designed. These hot zones are shown in Table 1. Numbering is based on the sequences described in the Figures of the present invention.<br>

While oligonucleotides are a preferred form of compound, the present invention comprehends other oligomeric oligonucleotide compounds, including but not limited to oligonucleotide mimetics such as are described below. The oligonucleotide compounds in accordance with this invention preferably comprise from about 18 to about 30 nucleobases (i.e., from about 18 to about 30 linked bases), although both longer and shorter sequences may find use with the present invention.<br>
Specific examples of preferred compounds useful with the present invention include oligonucleotides containing modified backbones or non-natural internucleoside linkages. As defined in this specification, oligonucleotides having modified backbones include those that retain a phosphorus atom in the backbone and those that do not have a phosphorus atom in the backbone.

In other preferred oligonucleotide mimetics, both the sugar and the internucleoside linkage (i.e., the backbone) of the nucleotide units are replaced with novel groups. The base units are maintained for hybridization with an appropriate nucleic acid target compound. One such oligomeric compound, an oligonucleotide mimetic that has been shown to have excellent hybridization properties, is referred to as a peptide nucleic acid (PNA). In PNA compounds, the sugar-backbone of an oligonucleotide is replaced with an amide containing backbone, in particular an aminoethylglycine backbone. The nucleobases are retained and are bound directly or indirectly to aza nitrogen atoms of the amide portion of the backbone. Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of PNA compounds include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos.: 5,539,082; 5,714,331; and 5,719,262, each of which is herein incorporated by reference. Further teaching of PNA compounds can be found in Nielsen et al, Science 254:1497 (1991).<br>

C. Dosages<br>
Dosing is dependent on severity and responsiveness of the disease state to be treated, with the course of treatment lasting from several days to several months, or until a cure is effected or a diminution of the disease state is achieved. Optimal dosing schedules can be calculated from measurements of drug accumulation in the body of the patient. The administering physician can easily determine optimum dosages, dosing methodologies and repetition rates. Optimum dosages may vary depending on the relative potency of individual oligonucleotides, and the delivery means, and can generally be estimated based on EC50S found to be effective in in vitro and in vivo animal models or based on the examples described herein. In general, dosage is from 0.01 µg to 100 g per kg of body weight, and may be given once or more daily, weekly, monthly or yearly. In some embodiments, dosage is continuous (e.g., intravenously) for a period of from several hours to several days or weeks. In some embodiments, treatment is given continuously for a defined period followed by a treatment free period. In some embodiments, the pattern of continuous dosing followed by a treatment free period is repeated several times (e.g., until the disease state is diminished).<br>
The treating physician can estimate repetition rates for dosing based on measured residence times and concentrations of the drug in bodily fluids or tissues. Following successful treatment, it may be desirable to have the subject undergo maintenance therapy<br>
60<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>

VIII.	Customized Patient Care<br>
In some embodiments, the present invention provides customized patient care. The compositions of the present invention are targeted to specific genes unique to a patient's diseae (e.g., cancer). For example, in some embodiments, a sample of the patient's cancer or other affected tissue (e.g., a biopsy) is first obtained. The biopsy is analyzed for the presence of expression of a particular gene (e.g., oncogene). In some preferred embodiments, the level of expression of an gene in a patient is analyzed. Expression may be detected by monitoring for the presence of RNA or DNA corresponding to a particular oncogene. Any suitable detection method may be utilized, including, but not limited to, those disclosed below.<br>
Following the characterization of the gene expression pattern of a patient's gene of interest, a customized therapy is generated for each patient. In preferred embodiments, oligonucleotide compounds specific for genes that are aberrantly expressed in the patient (e.g., in a tumor) are combined in a treatment cocktail. In some embodiments, the treatment cocktail further includes additional chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., those described above). The cocktail is then administered to the patient as described above.<br>
In some embodiments, the analysis of cancer samples and the selection of oligonucleotides for a treatment compound is automated. For example, in some embodiments, a software program that analyses the expression levels of a series of oncogenes to arrive at the optimum selection and concentration of oligonucleotides is utilized. In some embodiments, the analysis is performed by the clinical laboratory<br>
69<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
analyzing the patient sample and is transmitted to a second provider for formulation of the treatment cocktail. In some embodiments, the information is transmitted over the Internet, thus allowing for the shortest possible time in between diagnosis and the beginning of treatment.<br>
A. Detection of RNA<br>
In some embodiments, detection of oncogenes (e.g., including but not limited to, those disclosed herein) is detected by measuring the expression of corresponding mRNA in a tissue sample (e.g., cancer tissue). In other embodiments, expression of mRNA is measured in bodily fluids, including, but not limited to, blood, serum, mucus, and urine. In some preferred embodiments, the level of mRNA expression in measured quantitatively. RNA expression may be measured by any suitable method, including but not limited to, those disclosed below.<br>
In some embodiments, RNA is detected by Northern blot analysis. Northern blot analysis involves the separation of RNA and hybridization of a complementary labeled probe. In other embodiments, RNA expression is detected by enzymatic cleavage of specific structures (INVADER assay, Third Wave Technologies; See e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,846,717, 6,090,543; 6,001,567; 5,985,557; and 5,994,069; each of which is herein incorporated by reference). The INVADER assay detects specific nucleic acid (e.g., RNA) sequences by using structure-specific enzymes to cleave a complex formed by the hybridization of overlapping oligonucleotide probes.<br>
In still further embodiments, RNA (or corresponding cDNA) is detected by hybridization to a oligonucleotide probe). A variety of hybridization assays using a variety of technologies for hybridization and detection are available. For example, in some embodiments, TaqMan assay (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA; See e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,962,233 and 5,538,848, each of which is herein incorporated by reference) is utilized. The assay is performed during a PCR reaction. The TaqMan assay exploits the 5'-3' exonuclease activity of the AMPLITAQ GOLD DNA polymerase. A probe consisting of an oligonucleotide with a 5'-reporter dye (e.g., a fluorescent dye) and a 3'-quencher dye is included in the PCR reaction. During PCR, if the probe is bound to its target, the 5'-3' nucleolytic activity of the AMPLITAQ GOLD polymerase cleaves the probe between the reporter and the quencher dye. The separation of the reporter dye from the quencher dye results in an increase of fluorescence. The signal accumulates with each cycle of PCR and<br>
can be monitored with a fluorimeter.<br>
70<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
In yet other embodiments, reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is used to detect the expression of RNA. In RT-PCR, RNA is enzymatically converted to complementary DNA or "cDNA" using a reverse transcriptase enzyme. The cDNA is then used as a template for a PCR reaction. PCR products can be detected by any suitable method, including but not limited to, gel electrophoresis and staining with a DNA specific stain or hybridization to a labeled probe. In some embodiments, the quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR with standardized mixtures of competitive templates method described in U.S. Patents 5,639,606, 5,643,765, and 5,876,978 (each of which is herein incorporated by reference) is utilized.<br>
B. Detection of Protein<br>
In other embodiments, gene expression of oncogenes is detected by measuring the expression of the corresponding protein or polypeptide. In some embodiments, protein expression is detected in a tissue sample. In other embodiments, protein expression is detected in bodily fluids. In some embodiments, the level of protein expression is quantitated. Protein expression may be detected by any suitable method. In some embodiments, proteins are detected by their binding to an antibody raised against the protein. The generation of antibodies is well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Antibody binding is detected by techniques known in the art (e.g., radioimmunoassay, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay), "sandwich" immunoassays, immunoradiometric assays, gel diffusion precipitation reactions, immunodiffusion assays, in situ immunoassays (e.g., using colloidal gold, enzyme or radioisotope labels, for example), Western blots, precipitation reactions, agglutination assays (e.g., gel agglutination assays, hemagglutination assays, etc.), complement fixation assays, immunofluorescence assays, protein A assays, and immunoelectrophoresis assays, etc.<br>
In one embodiment, antibody binding is detected by detecting a label on the primary antibody. In another embodiment, the primary antibody is detected by detecting binding of a secondary antibody or reagent to the primary antibody. In a further embodiment, the secondary antibody is labeled. Many methods are known in the art for detecting binding in an immunoassay and are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
In some embodiments, an automated detection assay is utilized. Methods for the automation of immunoassays include those described in U.S. Patents 5,885,530, 4,981,785, 6,159,750, and 5,358,691, each of which is herein incorporated by reference. In some<br>
embodiments, the analysis and presentation of results is also automated. For example, in<br>
71<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
some embodiments, software that generates an expression profile based on the presence or absence of a series of proteins corresponding to oncogenes is utilized.<br>
In other embodiments, the immunoassay described in U.S. Patents 5,599,677 and 5,672,480; each of which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>

MCF10CA1<br>
MCF10 cells are derived from benign breast tissue from a woman with fibrocystic disease. MCF10 lines consists of several lines, one is MCF10A, an immortalized normal human breast cell line. MCF10A was transformed with T24 Ha-ras to make MCFlOAneoT cells. MCF10AT with neoplastic progression potential was derived from xenograft passaged MCFlO-AneoT. MCF10AT generates carcinoma in about 25% of xenografts. Fully malignant MCF10CA1 lines were derived from several xenograft passages of MCF10AT. MCFlOCAla forms tumors 100% of the time and it metastasizes. A kariotype of MCFlOCAla shows an extra copy of chromosome 1. It metastasizes into the lung 36 days after IV injection of the cells.<br>

min. They were then combined and incubated for an additional 15 min. 1.6 ml Opti-MEM media was then added to a final volume of 2 ml and a final concentration 1 µM oligonucleotide. The concentration of lipofectin and oligonucleotides can be adjusted based on their molecular weight and desired concentration of compounds. There was no cytotoxic effect at this level.<br>
E.	Cell Growth Inhibition Assay<br>
Cell growth inhibition was assessed using<br>
3-[4,5-Dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) purchased from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO). Cells were resuspended in culture media at 50,000 cells /ml and 100 /xl was distributed into each well of a 96-well, flat bottomed plate (Costar Corning, NY, USA) and incubated for 24 hours. Media was changed to 100 µl fresh media containing the desired concentration of oligonucleotides and incubated for 24 hours. Controls had media with pure sterile water equal to the volume of oligonucleotide solution. The media was changed without further addition of oligonucleotides every 24 hours until the control cultures were confluent (6 to 7 days). Thereafter the media was removed and plates were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 100 µl of serum free media containing 0.5 mg/ml MTT dye was added into each well and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. The media with dye was removed, washed with PBS and 100 µl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to solubilize the reactive dye. The absorbance values were read using an automatic multiwell spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek Microplate Autoreader, Winooski, VT, USA). Each treatment was repeated at least 3 times with 8 independent wells each time.<br>
F.	Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis<br>
The cells were seeded and cultured in T25 tissue culture flasks (Costar, Corning, NY, USA) at 200,000 cells/flask. The cells were allowed to attach for 24 hours. The media was replaced with fresh media containing 10 to 20 µM oligonucleotides and incubated for 24 hours. The media was changed every 48 hours without further addition of inhibitors and cell cultures were continued until the control flasks were confluent (6-7 days). Cells were harvested using lx trypsin:EDTA (Invitrogen, Gibco, MD) and collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 125 mM Tris-HCL buffer (pH 6.8), sonicated with 10-20% output and lysed in an equal volume of 8% SDS for a final<br>
concentration of 4% SDS. Cells extracts were boiled for 10 min, chilled on ice and<br>

In Vivo Inhibition of Tumor Growth<br>
This example describes the inhibition of tumor growth by oligonucleotides of the present invention in a human prostate carcinoma model.<br>
Animals: The human PC-3 GFP prostate carcinoma subcutaneous model was utilized (See e.g., Yang et al., Cancer Research 59, 781-786, [1999]; Glinskii et al., Cancer Research 63, 4239-4243, [2003]; and Kalikin et al., Cancer Biology and Therapy 2:6, 17-21 [2003]). Male athymic NCr nude mice between 5 and 6 weeks of age were used. The anmilas were bred and maintained in a HEPA filtered environment with cages, food and bedding sterilized by autoclaving. The breeding painrs were obtained from Taconic Quality Laboratory Animals and services for Research (Germantown, NY). The animal diets (5010<br>
82<br><br>
WO 2005/118824	PCT/US2005/018993<br>
autoclavable rodent diet) were obtained from PMI nutrition International Inc. (Brentwood, MO). A total of 60 male animals were used for the study.<br>
Study drugs: Nucleic acid based oligo compound PNT100 and scrambled oligo control PNT-C with cationic liposomal delivery (LDV) formulation.<br>
GFP expression vector: pLEIN was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The vector expresses enhanced GFP and the neomycin resistance gene on the same bicistronic message that contains an internal ribosome entry site.<br>
Cell culture, vector production, transfection, and subcloning: PT67, an NIH3T3 derived packaging cell line, expressing the 10 AI viral envelopes, was purchased from Clontech. PT67 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For vector production, packaging cells (PT67), at 70% confluence, were incubated with a precipitated mixture of N- [1- (2 ,3 - dioleoyloxyl) propyl]-N, N,<br>
trimethylammoniurnrnethyl sulfate reagent and saturating amounts of pLEIN plasmid for 18 h. Fresh medium was replenished at this time. The cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy 48 h posttransfection. For selection, the cells were cultured in the presence of 200-1000 µg/ml G418 for 7 days.<br>
GFP gene transduction of PC-3-GFP cells: For GFP gene fransduction, 20% confluent PC-3 cells (ATCC, CRL 1435) were incubated with a 1:1 precipitated mixture of retroviral supernatants of PT67 cells and Ham's F-12 K containing 7% fetal bovine serum for 72 h. Fresh medium was replenished at this time. PC-3 cells were harvested by trypsin EDTA 72 h posttransduction and subcultured at a ratio of 1:15 into selective medium that contained 200 µg/ml 6418. The level of 6418 was increased to 1000 Ng/ml stepwise. The brightest PC-3 cell clones expressing GFP were selected, combined, and then amplified and transferred by conventional culture methods.<br>
Subcutaneous Tumor Growth: Tumor stocks were made by subcutaneously injecting PC-3-GFP cells at the concentration of 5 x 106 cells /200 µl into the flank of nude mice. The strong GFP expression of tumors grown in the subcutis of mice was certified before harvest. The tumor tissues harvested from subcutaneous growth in nude mice were inspected, and any grossly necrotic or suspected necrotic or non GFP tumor tissues were removed. Tumor tissues were subsequently cut into small fragments of approximately 2 mm .<br>
Subcutaneous tissue fragment implantation: Tumor stock of the prostate cancer<br>
PC-3 GFP was established by subcutaneously injecting PC-3 GFP cells to the flank of nude<br>

mice. The tumor was maintained in nude mice subcutaneously as tumor stock prior to use. Before implantation, strong GFP expression of the PC-3 GFP tumor tissue was confirmed by the fluorescent light. On the day of implantation, the tumor was harvested from the subcutaneous site and placed in RPMI-1640 medium. Necrotic tissues were removed and viable tissues were cut into 2 mm3 pieces. The tissue fragments were then implanted subcutaneously to right flank of the nude nice.<br>
Whole body optical imaging of green fluorescent protein expressing tumors and metastases: A Leica stereo fluorescence microscope model LZ12 equipped with a mercury lamp power supply was used. Selective excitation of GFP was produced through a D425/60 band pass filter and 470 DCXR dichroic mirror. Emitted fluorescence was collected through a long pass filter GG475 (Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT) on a ST-133 Micromax High Speed TEA/CCD-1317K1 thermoelectrically cooled camera (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ), with a 1317x1035 pixel chip. Experiments were controlled and images were processed for contrast and brightness and analyzed with the help of Image Pro Plus 3.1 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, Maryland). High resolution images were captured directly on the computer or continuously through video output.<br>
Study animals: A total of 60 mice used for the study were divided into 6 groups 12 days after surgery. Groups for each of the cohort conditions were randomly chosen.<br>
Treatment Initiation: When primary tumors reach between 50-100 mm3 estimated volume.<br>

Data collection:<br>
Tumor sizes: Each animal was checked once a week for tumor growth by caliper measurements until the end of the study. Measurements over a 40 days period were taken to calculate tumor volume response over time. An approximate tumor volume was calculated using the formula 1/2 (a x b), where b is the smaller of two perpendicular diameters. Approximate tumor volume was calculated by the formula (Wx L ) x 1/2.<br>
GFP Imaging: 12 days after implantation, whole body optical imaging of GFPexpressing tumors was taken once a week.<br>
Body weights: Body weights for all animals was weighed once per week for the duration of the study. An electronic balance was used to measure the body weight.<br>
Termination: The final tumor weights were acquired after animals were sacrificed at the fortysixth day of the study. Each tumor was weighed using an electronic balance.<br>
Statistical methods used in efficacy evaluation: Tumor volumes and final tumor weights of all 6 groups were analyzed using the Student's t2 test with an = 0.05 (twosided).<br>
Results: The results are shown in Figures 32-35. Figure 32 shows mean tumor volume of tumors in the PC-3 GFP prostate carcinoma subcutaneous model following treatment with PNT-100 and/or TAXOTERE. Figure 33 shows mean body weight of tumors in the PC-3 GFP prostate carcinoma subcutaneous model following treatment with PNT-100 and/or TAXOTERE.

In Vivo Inhibition of Tumor Growth<br>
This example describes the inhibition of tumor growth by in vivo delivery of oligonucleotides of the present invention in a human prostate carcinoma model.<br>
I) PC-3 prostate Xenograft tumor response to PNT100 administered i.v. with<br>
randomized xenografts at different vascularization states was investigated. This experiment<br>
was performed with the two step Neophectin formulation with five daily doses of 1 mg/kg<br>
PNT100. All mice survived the dosing regiment without noticeable toxicity responses.<br>
II) WSU-DLCL2 Xenograft i.v. PNT100 study: A second study was performed<br>
to establish i.v. delivery and efficacy of PNTIOO-Neophectin in a non-Hodgkin's-<br>
lymphoma model (NHL). The study was designed to administer five daily doses of 5 mg/kg<br>
PNT100, and in certain cohorts, combination therapy with vincristine. After one dose of<br>
PNT100, noticeable weight loss in the animals injected with PNT100 and PNT-C<br>
(Scrambled control) was observed. The data shows substantial effect of combination<br>
therapy with PNT100 and PNT-C. Results are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Figures 36 and 37<br>
show tumor burden 20 days post WSU-DLCL2 transplantation. The results indicate that<br>
PNT-100, alone and in combination with vincristine, shrinks tumors in mice.<br>
