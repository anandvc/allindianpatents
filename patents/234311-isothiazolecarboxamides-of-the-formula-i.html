				<td>The present invention relates to isothiazolecarboxamides of the formula (I).<br>
The present invention relates to novel isothiazolecarboxamides, to a plurality of processes for their preparation and to their use for protecting plants against attack by undesirable microorganisms and animal pests.<br>
It is already known that numerous isothiazolecarboxylic acid derivatives have fungicidal properties (cf. US-A 5 240 951 and JP-A 06-009 313). Thus, for example,<br>
N-ethyl-3,4-dichloro-isothiazole-5-carboxamide  and   3,4,4'-trichloro-isothiazole-5-<br>
* carboxanilide can be employed for controlling fungi.  The activity of these<br>
compounds is good, but in some cases leaves something to be desired at low application rates.<br>
This invention, accordingly, provides novel isothiazolecarboxamides of the formula<br><br>

The product that remains can be freed of any impurities that may still be present by customary methods.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention have a strong plant-strengthening activity in plants. They are therefore suitable for mobilizing the defences of the plant against attack by undesirable microorganisms.<br>
In the present context, plant-strengthening (resistance-inducing) compounds are compounds which are capable of stimulating the defensive system of plants in such a way that the treated plants, when subsequently inoculated with undesirable microorganisms, develop substantial resistance against these microorganisms.<br>
In the present case, undesirable microorganisms are phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses. The compounds according to the invention can thus be employed to protect plants for a certain period of time after the treatment against the attack by the abovementioned harmful organisms. The period of time for which protection is provided generally extends from 1 to 10 days, preferably from 1 to 7 days, after the treatment of the plants with the active compounds.<br>
In addition to the plant-strengthening (resistance-inducing) activity, the active compounds according to the invention also have strong microbicidal activity and are additionally employed in practice for the direct control of undesirable microorganisms.<br><br>
The active compounds are suitable for use as crop protection agents, in particular as fungicides.<br>
In crop protection, the undesirable microorganisms include fungi from the classes of the Plasmodiophoromycetes, Oomycetes, Chytridiomycetes, Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, Deuteromycetes.<br>
Some causative organisms of fungal diseases which come under the generic names listed above may be mentioned as examples, but not by way of limitation:<br>
Pythium species, such as, for example, Pythium ultimum; Phytophthora species, such as, for example, Phytophthora infestans;<br>
Pseudoperonospora species, such as, for example, Pseudoperonospora humuli or Pseudoperonospora cubensis;<br>
Plasmopara species, such as, for example, Plasmopara viticola;<br>
Peronospora species, such as, for example, Peronospora pisi or Peronospora brassicae;<br>
Erysiphe species, such as, for example, Erysiphe graminis; Sphaerotheca species, such as, for example, Sphaerotheca fuliginea; Podosphaera species, such as, for example, Podosphaera leucotricha; Venturia species, such as, for example, Venturia inaequalis;<br><br>
Pyrenophora species, such as, for example, Pyrenophora teres or Pyrenophora graminea (conidia form: Drechslera, syn.: Helminthosporium);<br>
Cochliobolus species, such as, for example, Cochliobolus sativus (conidia form: Drechslera, syn.: Helminthosporium);<br>
Uromyces species, such as, for example, Uromyces appendiculatus; Puccinia species, such as, for example, Puccinia recondita; Tilletia species, such as, for example, Tilletia caries; Ustilago species, such as, for example, Ustilago nuda or Ustilago avenae; Pellicularia species, such as, for example, Pellicularia sasakii; Pyricularia species, such as, for example, Pyricularia oryzae; Fusarium species, such as, for example, Fusarium culmorum; Botrytis species, such as, for example, Botrytis cinerea; Septoria species, such as, for example, Septoria nodorum; Leptosphaeria species, such as, for example, Leptosphaeria nodorum; Cercospora species, such as, for example, Cercospora canescens; Alternaria species, such as, for example, Alternaria brassicae;<br><br>
Pseudocercosporella species, such as, for example, Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides.<br>
The good crop safety of the active compounds at the concentrations necessary for controlling plant diseases permits a treatment of above-ground parts of plants, and also a treatment of vegetative propagation stock and seed and of the soil.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be used here particularly successfully for controlling cereal diseases, such as, for example, against Erysiphe species, or of diseases in viticulture and in fruit and vegetable growing, such as, for example, against Plasmopara or Venturia species, or of rice diseases, such as, for example, against Pyricularia species. Other plant diseases, such as, for example, Septoria, Cochliobolus, Pyrenophora and Pseudocercosporella species, can also be controlled successfully with the active compounds according to the invnetion, and specific mention may be made of Drechslera teres.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are also suitable for increasing the harvest yield. Additionally, they have reduced toxicity and good crop safety.<br>
The active compounds which can be employed according to the invention, having good crop tolerance and homeotherm safety, are also suitable for controlling animal pests, in particular insects, arachnids and nematodes, which are encountered in agriculture, in forests, in horticulture, in the protection of stored products and of materials, and in the hygiene sector and in veterinary medicine.

The compounds according to the invention additionally have herbicidal activity.<br>
Depending on their particular physical and/or chemical properties, the active compounds can be converted to the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, suspensions, powders, foams, pastes, granules, aerosols and microencapsulations in polymeric substances and in coating compositions for seeds, and ULV cool and warm fogging formulations.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents, liquefied gases under pressure, and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam formers. If the extender used is water, it is also possible to use, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Suitable liquid solvents are essentially: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulphoxide, or else water. Liquefied gaseous extenders or carriers are to be understood as meaning liquids which are gaseous at standard temperature and under atmospheric pressure, for example aerosol propellants such as halogenated hydrocarbons, or else butane, propane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Suitable solid carriers are: for example ground natural minerals such<br><br>
as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals such as highly disperse silica, alumina and silicates. Suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, or else synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks. Suitable emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates, or else protein hydrolysates. Suitable dispersants are: for example lignin-sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, or else natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the formulations. Other possible additives are mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95 per cent by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be used as such or in their formulations also mixed with known fungicides, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides or insecticides in order thus, for example, to widen the spectrum of action or to prevent development of resistance. In many cases, synergistic effects are achieved, i.e. the activity of the mixture exceeds the activity of the individual components.<br><br>

It is also possible to admix other known active compounds, such as herbicides, or else fertilizers and growth-promoting substances.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or the use forms prepared therefrom, such as ready-to-use solutions, suspensions, wettable powders, pastes, soluble powders, dusts and granules. They are used in the customary manner, for example by pouring, spraying, atomizing, spreading, dusting, foaming, brushing on and the like. It is further possible to apply the active compounds by the ultra-low volume method or to inject the active compound formulation, or the active compound itself, into the soil. The seed of the plants can also be treated.<br>
When using the active compounds according to the invention for controlling microorganisms, the application rates can be varied within a relatively wide range, depending on the kind of application. When treating parts of plants, the active<br><br>
compound application rates are generally between 0.1 and 10,000 g/ha, preferably between 10 and 1000 g/ha. When treating seed, the active compound application rates are generally between 0.001 and 50 g per kilogram of seed, preferably between 0.01 and 10 g per kilogram of seed. When treating the soil, the active compound application rates are generally between 0.1 and 10,000 g/ha, preferably between 1 and 5000 g/ha.<br>
When used against animal pests, the compounds according to the invention may also be present in commercial formulations and in the use forms prepared from these formulations as a mixture with synergists. Synergists are compounds which increase the activity of the active compounds, without it being necessary for the synergist which is added to be active itself.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercial formulations can vary within wide ranges. The active compound concentration of the use form may be from 0.0000001 to 95 % by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.0001 and 1 % by weight.<br>
Application is carried out in a manner adapted to the use forms.<br>
The preparation and the use of the active compounds according to the invention is illustrated by the examples below.<br><br>
Prenaration Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br><br>
At 5 to 10°C and with stirring, 38.1 g (0.15 mol) of 3,4-dichloro-isothiazole'-5-carbonyl chloride are added dropwise over a period of 10 minutes to a mixture of 20.8 g (0.1725 mol) of 2-cyano-aniline and 250 ml of pyridine. After the addition, the reaction mixture is admixed with 70 ml of absolute tetrahydrofuran and 30 ml of pyridine, allowed to warm to room temperature and then stirred at room temperature for 75 minutes. The reaction mixture is subsequently concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue that remains is stirred with 800 ml of water and 800 ml of ethyl acetate. The precipitate which is present in the two-phase mixture is filtered off, washed with ethyl acetate and dried. This gives 31.7 g of a crystalline product of melting point 191 to 193°C.<br>
The aqueous phase of the two-phase filtrate is separated off and extracted twice with 150 ml of ethyl acetate each time. The combined organic phases are dried over sodium sulphate and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue that remains is stirred with 100 ml of petroleum ether and 25 ml of ethyl acetate. The resulting solid is filtered off with suction, rinsed with ethyl acetate and dried.<br>
In this manner, a total of 40 g (89 % of theory) of 2'-cyano-3,4-dichloro-isothiazole-5-carboxanilide are obtained in the form of a solid substance of melting point 191 to 193°C.<br><br>
Preparation of the starting material:<br>

At room temperature, 146 g (1.23 mol) of thionyl chloride are added dropwise with stirring over a period of 5 minutes to 8.92 g (0.045 mol) of 3,4-dichloro-isothiazole-5-carboxylic acid. Four drops of dimethylformamide are then added and the reaction mixture is heated under reflux for one hour. The reaction mixture is subsequently cooled to room temperature and concentrated under reduced pressure. In this manner, 12.19 g of 3,4-dichloro-isothiazole-5-carbonyl chloride are obtained in the form of an orange oil.<br>
Example 2<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
At room temperature, 15 g (0.164 mol) of N-formyl-N-hydroxymethyl-methylamine are added with stirring to a mixture of 32.3 g (0.164 mol) of 3,4-dichloro-isothiazole-5-carboxamide and 245 ml of glacial acetic acid. At room temperature, 37 g (0.362 mol) of concentrated sulphuric acid are then added dropwise with stirring, the reaction mixture being cooled with ice. The reaction mixture is subsequently stirred at room temperature for 29 hours and then, with ice-cooling, admixed with 400 ml of water. The resulting mixture is extracted four times with 200 ml of methylene chloride and the combined organic phases are dried over sodium sulphate and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The oily residue that remains is chromatographed over silica gel using ethyl acetate. Concentration of the eluate gives<br><br>
20.7 g (42.6 % of theory) of N-(N-formyl-N-methyl-aminomethyl)-3,4-dichloro-isothiazole-5-carboxamide in the form of a crystalline solid of melting point 87 to 88°C.<br>
Preparation of the starting material<br>
At 0 to 10°C, 50.1 g (0.2 mol) of 3,4-dichloro-isothiazole-5-carbonyl chloride are added dropwise with stirring over a period of 30 minutes to 82 g (1.2 mol) of concentrated ammonia. After the addition, another 41 g (0.6 mol) of concentrated ammonia are added and the mixture is diluted with 70 ml of water. The mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred at this temperature for 45 minutes. The resulting precipitate is filtered off with suction, washed successive with water and petroleum ether and dried. In this manner, 32.3 g (81.8 % of theory) of 3,4-dichloro-isothiazole-5-carboxamide are obtained in the form of a solid of melting point 156 to 158°C.<br>

Pyricularia Test (Rice) / Induction of resistance<br>
Solvent:	2.5      parts by weight of acetone<br>
Emulsifier:	0.06    parts by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent, and the concentrate is diluted with water and the stated amount of emulsifer to the desired concentration.<br>
To test for resistance-reducing activity, young rice plants are sprayed with the preparation of active compound at the stated application rate. 5 days after the treatment, the plants are inoculated with an aqueous spore suspension of Pyricularia oryzae. The plants are subsequently placed in a greenhouse at 100 % relative atmospheric humidity and a temperature of 25°C.<br>
Evaluation is carried out 4 days after the inoculation. 0 % means an efficacy which corresponds to that of the control, while an efficacy of 100 % means that no infection is observed.<br>
