				<td>EXHAUST MANIFOLD ASSEMBLY<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to exhaust manifolds, and more<br>
specifically to engagement between a mounting flange and a manifold body of an<br>
exhaust manifold.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] An engine assembly typically includes an exhaust manifold<br>
coupled to an engine to direct an exhaust gas flow therefrom. The exhaust<br>
manifold may include a manifold body fixed to a flange that couples the exhaust<br>
manifold to the engine. The manifold body may be welded to the flange<br>
generally at an end surface thereof that generally abuts the engine after<br>
assembly. The manifold body and flange are typically formed from similar<br>
materials to account for the thermal expansion experienced during the welding<br>
process.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0004] An exhaust manifold may include a manifold body and a flange.<br>
The manifold body may include a first tube that forms an exhaust gas inlet. The<br>
flange may be coupled to the manifold body and may fix the manifold body to an<br>
 <br>
engine and place the manifold body in communication with an exhaust gas from<br>
the engine. The flange may include a first aperture having first and second<br>
portions located along an axial extent of the first aperture. The first portion may<br>
extend to a first end surface of the flange and the second portion may extend to a<br>
second end surface of the flange. The first portion may have a first radial width<br>
that is less than a second radial width of the second portion. The second portion<br>
may receive an end of the first tube therein. The first tube may be fixed to the<br>
flange at a location within the first aperture between the first portion and the<br>
second end surface.<br>
[0005] A method may include inserting an end of a first tube that forms<br>
an exhaust gas inlet to an exhaust manifold into a first aperture of a flange that<br>
mounts the exhaust manifold to an engine. The first aperture may include first<br>
and second portions located along an axial extent of the first aperture. The first<br>
portion may extend to a first end surface of the flange and the second portion<br>
may extend to a second end surface of the flange. The first portion may have a<br>
first radial width that is less than a second radial width of the second portion.<br>
The method may further include aligning the end axially within the first aperture<br>
at a location between the first portion and the second end surface and fixing the<br>
end of the first tube to an inner surface of the first aperture.<br>
[0006] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>
 <br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0013] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features.<br>
[0014] Referring to Figure 1, an exemplary engine assembly 10 is<br>
schematically illustrated. Engine assembly 10 may include an engine 12 in<br>
communication with an intake system 14, an exhaust system 16, and a fuel<br>
system 18. In the example shown, intake system 14 may include an intake<br>
 <br>
manifold 20 and a throttle 22. However, it is understood that alternate<br>
applications may not include throttle 22. Throttle 22 may control an air flow<br>
(indicated by arrow 23) into engine 12 and fuel system 18 may control a fuel flow<br>
into engine 12. Exhaust system 16 may include an exhaust manifold 24 fixed to<br>
engine 12 and in communication with exhaust gas created by combustion of the<br>
air/fuel mixture. Exhaust manifold 24 may direct an exhaust gas flow (indicated<br>
by arrow 25) from engine 12.<br>
[0015] With reference to Figure 2, exhaust manifold 24 may include a<br>
manifold body 26 and a flange 28. Manifold body 26 may include, but is not<br>
limited to, a series of tubes 30, 32, 34, 36 having a jacket 38 fixed thereto.<br>
Tubes 30, 32, 34, 36 may be fixed relative to one another by engagement with<br>
jacket 38. More specifically, each of tubes 30, 32, 34, 36 may be welded to<br>
jacket 38. Tubes 30, 32, 34, 36 may be formed from a variety of materials<br>
including steel, such as wrought low-carbon and stainless steels. Ends 40, 42,<br>
44, 46 of each of tubes 30, 32, 34, 36 may extend beyond jacket 38. Due to<br>
manufacturing variation, the extent of ends 40, 42, 44, 46 beyond jacket 38 may<br>
vary among tubes 30, 32, 34, 36.<br>
[0016] Flange 28 may be formed, for example, from a powdered metal.<br>
In this example, tubes 30, 32, 34, 36 and flange 28 may be formed from different<br>
materials. Tubes 30, 32, 34, 36 may therefore have a different coefficient of<br>
thermal expansion than flange 28. The powdered metal of flange 28 may have a<br>
density of at least 6.8 g/cm3. Flange 28 may include a series of apertures 48, 50,<br>
52, 54 extending between first and second end surfaces 56, 58 thereof. First end<br>
 <br>
surface 56 may be a mating surface for engagement with engine 12. With<br>
additional reference to Figure 3, aperture 48 will be described with the<br>
understanding that the description applies equally to apertures 50, 52, 54.<br>
Aperture 48 may include first and second portions 60, 62 having a stepped<br>
region 64 therebetween.<br>
[0017] First portion 60 may extend to first end surface 56 and second<br>
portion 62 may extend to second end surface 58. First portion 60 may have a<br>
radial width that is less than a radial width of second portion 62. More<br>
specifically, and with additional reference to Figure 5, second portion 62 may<br>
extend radially outwardly relative to first portion 60 and may include major and<br>
minor diameters (D1, D2) that are greater than major and minor diameters (D3,<br>
D4) of first portion 60.<br>
[0018] Stepped region 64 may extend at an angle relative to the<br>
longitudinal axis of aperture 48. For example, stepped region 64 may extend at<br>
an angle (θ) of between 10 and 90 degrees. Alternatively, stepped region 64<br>
may extend at an angle of between 90 and 135 degrees to provide a generally<br>
closed recess. Stepped region 64 may be located a distance (x) from first end<br>
surface 56 of between 25 and 75 percent of the axial extent (y) of aperture 48.<br>
More specifically, stepped region 64 may be located at approximately the<br>
midpoint of the axial extent (y) of aperture 48. End 40 of tube 30 may extend into<br>
aperture 48 at a location between first end surface 56 and second end surface<br>
58. For example, an end face 41 of end 40 may be located axially between first<br>
portion 60 and second end surface 58. It is understood that the description of<br>
 <br>
tube 30 and aperture 48 applies equally to tubes 32, 34, 36 and apertures 50, 52,<br>
54.<br>
[0019] With additional reference to Figure 4, end face 41 of tube 30<br>
may have a major diameter (D5) that is less than D1 and greater than D3. End<br>
face 41 of tube 30 may have a minor diameter (D6) that is less than D2 and<br>
greater than D4. As such, stepped region 64 may extend radially over end 40 of<br>
tube 30. A recess 66 may be formed between first portion 60 and end 40 of tube<br>
30 and may have an axial extent defined by end face 41 and stepped region 64.<br>
Recess 66 may extend radially outwardly relative to an inner surface of tube 30<br>
at end 40 and first portion 60 of aperture 48. The radially outward extent of<br>
recess 66 may be between 0.5 mm and 4.0 mm relative to first portion 60.<br>
Recess 66 may be located a distance (x) from first end surface 56 of between 25<br>
and 75 percent of the axial extent (y) of aperture 48 (seen in Figure 3). More<br>
specifically, recess 66 may be located at approximately the midpoint of the axial<br>
extent (y) of aperture 48.<br>
[0020] End 40 of tube 30 may be fixed to an inner wall of aperture 48 at<br>
a location between first and second end surfaces 56, 58. For example, end 40 of<br>
tube 30 may be fixed to flange 28 at a location between first portion 60 and<br>
second end surface 58, and more specifically at recess 66. Due to the fixation of<br>
tube 30 within aperture 48 at a location between first and second end surfaces<br>
56, 58, rather than at first end surface 56, the axial extent of tube 30 within<br>
aperture 48 may vary without requiring additional machining operations. For<br>
example, at least two of tubes 30, 32, 34, 36 may have different axial extents<br>
 <br>
within apertures 48, 50, 52, 54. One of tubes 30, 32, 34, 36 may have an axial<br>
extent that is up to 2.0 mm greater than another of tubes 30, 32, 34, 36, and<br>
more specifically between 1.0 and 2.0 mm greater than another of tubes 30, 32,<br>
34, 36.<br>
[0021] Tube 30 may be fixed to flange 28 by a weld bead 68. A weld<br>
tip may be inserted into aperture 48 and may apply weld bead 68 within recess<br>
66. The angular extent of stepped region 64 discussed above may generally<br>
facilitate insertion of the weld tip for the welding operation. Weld bead 68 may<br>
have a radially inward extent relative to first portion 60 that is, for example, less<br>
than or equal to 1 mm. As such, weld bead 68 may provide little or no additional<br>
flow restriction within aperture 48. The location of weld bead 68 within recess 66<br>
at a location proximate the midpoint of the axial extent of aperture 48 may<br>
generally limit warpage of first end surface 56 that is typically caused by the heat<br>
generated during welding. More specifically, warpage of first end surface 56 may<br>
be generally less than a warpage caused by welding directly on first end surface<br>
56. The reduced warpage may eliminate or reduce the amount of machining<br>
required on first end surface 56.<br>
 <br>
