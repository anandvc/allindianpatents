				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a method for the production of electrical<br>
contacts and electrical contacts produced thereby.<br>
This invention further relates to a method for the production of<br>
electrical contacts with thin film p-type semiconductor class IIB-VIA<br>
compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The difficulties in making good ohmic contacts top-type class II-B-VIA<br>
compounds of semiconductor such as cadmium telluride is well<br>
known. These materials on the other hand are very important for the<br>
fabrication of various electronic devices in general and photovoltaic<br>
cells in particular. As a consequence, utilisation of such material for<br>
various applications depends upon the ability to make low resistance<br>
ohmic contact on them.<br>
It is believed that the method of chemical etching of CdTe surface<br>
and consequent deposition of a thin metallic layer, the acidic etch<br>
leaves a tellurium rich surface which improves the contact between<br><br>
the metal to be deposited and the p-CdTe. Such chemical etching has<br>
been normally used in connection with low resistive single crystal<br>
CdTe and contact deposition is sometimes followed by a 5-15<br>
minutes of heat treatment at 150°C in H2 atmosphere to improve the<br>
contact. From a recent report, it is evident that contact to p-CdTe can<br>
be obtained by etching the p-CdTe surface in a chemical solution like<br>
K2Cr2O7 + H2SO4 + H2O followed by Au + Cu alloy evaporation.<br>
In case of thin film p-CdTe (Thickness is less than 10 micrometers)<br>
device, one works with a relatively high resistive material (Resistivity<br>
greater than 100 Ohm-Centimeters) which makes the contact<br>
problem ever more serious. Strong acidic etching as recommended<br>
earlier is not suitable and use of dilute (1%) Br2 + CH3OH solution<br>
has been recommended. Among various techniques reported are<br>
direct applications of contact material on the fresh CdTe surface<br>
without any etching and formation of CuxTe layer on the surface by<br>
evaporation or by chemical methods. However, by far the most<br>
common technique is contact deposition after a mild Br2 + CH3OH<br>
etch. Unfortunately, the use of CuxTe layer has a tendency to be<br>
unstable and the direct applications of the contact material as well as<br>
a simple Br2 + CH3OH etch does not give electrical contacts as<br>
desired.<br><br>
A prior patent RE 30052 and RE 29986 disclose an invention relates<br>
to the deposition wit<br>
h lithium oxide. Hence, not relevant with instant<br>
specification.<br>
A second prior patent US4036645 discloses an invention related to<br>
deposition layer of electrically conductive material and not by any<br>
oxide. Hence, not relevant with the instant specification.<br>
A third prior patent US4067841 discloses an invention related to heat<br>
sink and not relevant with the instant specification.<br>
A fourth prior patent US5124175 discloses an invention related to a<br>
contact using tin-lead solders and not relevant with the instant<br>
specification.<br>
A fifth prior patent US4573265 discloses an invention related to dad-<br>
strip contact and not relevant with the instant specification.<br>
A sixth prior patent US4909857 discloses an invention related to<br>
electro-deposit of contacting layer for film photo voltaic cells and not<br>
relevant with the instant specification.<br><br>
A seventh prior patent US5059143 discloses an invention related to a<br>
mechanical contact and not relevant with the instant specification.<br>
None of the above prior patent documents focused on the defect<br>
induced electrical contact with anti-diffusion barrier.<br>
The inventor emphasizes on the production of such defect induced<br>
electrical contact in the present invention.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to propose a process for the<br>
production of electrical contacts, which is simple.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to propose a process for the<br>
production of electrical contacts which is cost-effective.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS:<br>
The invention will now be explained in greater detail with the help of<br>
the accompanying drawings where<br>
Fig. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a schematic drawing of the<br>
preferred embodiment of a photovoltaic cell constructed in<br>
accordance with the present invention;<br><br>
Fig. 2 is a graph of current voltage characteristics of a variety of cells<br>
prepared using prior methods and the method of the present<br>
invention;<br>
Fig. 3 is a schematic diagram of the system for plasma vapor<br>
deposition.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention includes a first sheet (marked B1) of insulating transparent<br>
material such as glass. On sheet B1 is layer B2 of a conducting<br>
transparent material such as Indium Tin Oxide (ITO). A layer B3 is<br>
deposited over B2 and comprises an n-type wide band gap window<br>
semi conducting material such as CdS (B3) different from the semi<br>
conducting (B4) film. The layer B4 is deposited over B3. On the<br>
surface of layer B4 another layer B5 is deposited as per the present<br>
invention. The layer B5 is covered by a layer of conducting material<br>
like Ni, Au or Al marked B6. The purpose of the layer B5 is to establish<br>
proper electrical contact to B4.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the system used for carrying out the method of the<br>
present invention where 1 stands for a vacuum chamber. A pump (7)<br>
is provided to the chamber for creating vacuum in the chamber (1). A<br>
three circular electrode system (2, 3 &amp; 4) is kept inside the vacuum<br><br>
chamber. The positive voltage is applied in the electrode 2 whereas<br>
the negative voltage is applied in the other two electrodes 3 &amp; 4. A<br>
heating arrangement is kept below the center of the electrode 3 as<br>
marked 5. Using an appropriate heating arrangement, the Cu from 5.<br>
Using an appropriate heating arrangement, the Cu from 5 is<br>
evaporated through 3, 2 &amp; 4 and allowed to be deposited over the<br>
substrates holder (6) kept in the vacuum chamber.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Thus according to this invention is provided a process for the<br>
production of electrical contacts, comprising fabricating a<br>
photovoltaic cell (B) and treating the surface layer with cadmium<br>
chloride (CdCI2) (B4), and depositing a layer of copper compound (B5)<br>
thereon, followed by depositing a top contact metallic layer (B6) on<br>
the copper compound layer (B5) to obtain the electrical contact<br>
(between B2 to B6).<br>
According to this invention is further provided an electrical contact<br>
comprising a photovoltaic cell (B) with a layer of a compound (B5)<br>
deposited thereon, and a top contact metallic layer (B6).<br><br>
In accordance with this invention is provided a process for the<br>
production of electrical contacts where the method of fabrication of<br>
the photovoltaic cell (B) using CdTe (B4) - CdS (B3) is according to<br>
known methods. Two methods of fabrication are used, a dry method<br>
and a wet method. In accordance with an embodiment, the dry<br>
method comprises depositing all the layers as described in Fig. 1 and<br>
thereafter giving the surface a treatment in CdCI2 (B4) in solution or<br>
vapour. The treated surface (B4) is then placed in a vacuum chamber<br>
(1) (Fig. 3) for deposition of CuxO layer (B5), the top contact metallic<br>
layer (B6) like Au, Ni or Al is deposited and the resulting photovoltaic<br>
cell (B) is measured with the results displayed as curves (S) in Fig. 2,<br>
which has a fill factor approximately 75%. The CuxO layer (B5) in the<br>
present invention is being fabricated using plasma vapor deposition<br>
process. The elemental Cu (5) (Fig. 3) is evaporated through an<br>
ionizing field generated through a high voltage. The system used for<br>
this purpose is depicted in Fig. 3. Before evaporation, various gases<br>
are introduced in the vacuum chamber (1) to form plasma of that<br>
particular gas. For oxide formation, O2 gas is introduced. For nitride<br>
formation, NH3 gas is introduced. The substrate holder (6) over which<br>
CuxO or CuxN are deposited as B5 is kept at a temperature in the<br>
range of 120-140°C. Deposition is continued to have thickness of the<br>
order of 0.1-03 micrometer. After that, a metallic layer like Au, Ni or<br>
Al is deposited to have final contact (B6).<br><br>
As a comparison with the method of the present invention, the same<br>
cell surface is treated using the chemicals mentioned earlier and<br>
metal coating like Au+Cu was deposited. The fill factor in this case is<br>
about 55 to 60%. This data indicates the superiority of the present<br>
method. A temperature cycling from -10°C to + 45°C and the light<br>
soaking at 100 mW/cm2 for 48 hrs. indicates that the contact<br>
fabrication of the present invention is much more stable compared to<br>
the conventional method. It indicates that due to innovation no<br>
further diffusion of top contacting material B6 under the influence of<br>
temperature cycling and light soaking. It is evident from the<br>
submission that the improvement in photovoltaic cell performance<br>
occurs due to the introduction of the intermediate layer of CuxO layer<br>
in between the metal coating and CdTe layer. The improvement in<br>
cell performance of the present invention is due to the introduction of<br>
defect induced field at the CdTe/metal interface. As a result, the<br>
efficiency and stability of the device is enhanced.<br>
Apart from this, the present invention depicted many of the features<br>
which clearly showed the significant advantage which the present<br>
invention achieves over the prior art. Consequently, only a few of the<br>
more outstanding features pointed out to illustrate the unexpected<br>
and unusual results obtained by the present invention. One of such<br><br>
features is that an intermediate thin layer of CuxO layer is initiating<br>
contact between the metal and CdTe. Moreover, the intermediate<br>
layer is very stable and unaffected with light soaking and<br>
temperature cycling. This is a unique method that can be integrated<br>
in any method of photovoltaic cell fabrication as well as in many<br>
other electronic devices fabrication. The uniqueness of this method<br>
yields better results than the conventional method.<br><br>
