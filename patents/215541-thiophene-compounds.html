BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, pharmaceutical formulations<br>
comprising these compounds, and the use of these compounds in therapy. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to novel compounds and methods for<br>
treating conditions mediated by Polo-like Kinase, susceptible neoplasms, and other<br>
conditions.<br>
Polo-like kinases ("PLK") are evolutionary conserved serine/threonine kinases that<br>
play critical roles in regulating processes in the cell cycle. PLK plays a role in the entry<br>
into and the exit from mitosis in diverse organisms from yeast to mammalian cells.<br>
PLK includes PLK1, PLK2, and PLK3.<br>
Polo-like kinases are known to be essential for mitosis in yeast, Drosophila, and<br>
Xenopus. For example, mutants of the homologous PLK genes in these organisms<br>
result in disordered mitotic spindles, and in Drosophila mutations can be embryonic<br>
lethal. RNA interference experiments on Drosophila polo have shown that ablation of<br>
polo in S2 cells results in G2/M arrest and apoptosis. PLK1 is the human homolog of<br>
Drosophila polo. It is believed to be involved in the entry into mitosis through the<br>
activation of cdk1 by phosphorylating and activating the phosphatase cdc25C, which<br>
in turn removes inhibitory phosphates from cdk1. This sets up an activation loop for<br>
cdk1 that leads to mitotic entry. PLK1 also phosphorylates cyclin B1, the cyclin<br>
partner of cdk1, resulting in nuclear localization. During mitosis, PLK1 has been<br>
shown to play roles in centrosome maturation and microtubule dynamics involved in<br>
formation of the mitotic spindle. PLK1 is also involved in the exit of cells from mitosis<br>
by phosphorylating and activating subunits of the anaphase-promoting complex<br>
(cdc16 and cdc27). PLK1 also phosphorylates cohesin proteins that hold sister<br>
chromatids together, exposing separase cleavage sites, and allowing separation of<br>
sister chromatids during anaphase. PLK1 may also play a role in cytokinesis through<br>
mosphorylation of the kinesin-like motor protein MKLP1. Inhibition of PLK1 thus has<br>
the potential to interfere with several stages of mitosis. Expression and activity of PLK<br>
protein increases during the cell cycle, reaching its peak during mitosis when it is also<br>
maximally phosphorylated. PLK1 mRNA is highly expressed in cells with a high mitotic<br>
index. PLK2 (serum-inducible kinase, SNK) and" PLK3 (Proliferation-related kinase PRK<br>
Fibroblast Growth Factor-inducible Wnase, FNK) were originally identified as<br>
immediate-early genes. PLK2 is not very well characterized, but PLK3 appears to be<br>
involved In regulation of cell cycle progression through M phase but functions<br>
differently from PLK1. Recent published work suggests that PLK3 plays an important<br>
role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and function of the centrosome during<br>
mitosis.<br>
Overexpression of PLK1 appears to be strongly associated with neoplastic cells<br>
(including cancers). A published study has shown high levels of PLK1 RNA expression<br>
in &gt;80% of lung and breast tumors, with little to no expression in adjacent normal<br>
tissue. Several studies have shown correlations between PLK expression, histological<br>
grade, and prognosis in several types of cancer. Significant correlations were found<br>
between percentages of PLK-positive cells and histological grade of ovarian and<br>
endometrial cancer (P
Invading endometrial carcinoma cells and that this could reflect the degree of<br>
malignancy and proliferation in endometrial carcinoma. Using RT-PCR analysis, PLK<br>
overexpression was detected in 97% of esophageal carcinomas and 73% of gastric<br>
carcinomas as compared to the corresponding normal tissues. Further, patients with<br>
high levels of PLK overexpression in esophageal carcinoma represented a significantly<br>
poorer prognosis group than those with low levels of PLK overexpression. In head and<br>
neck cancers, elevated mRNA expression of PLK1 was observed in most tumors; a<br>
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that those patients with moderate levels of PLK1<br>
expression survived longer than those with high levels of PLK1 expression. Analysis of<br>
patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma showed similar outcomes related to PLK1<br>
expression.<br>
bisruption of mitosis with anti-microtubule drugs has been a successful approach in<br>
cancer chemotherapy. The taxanes and vinca alkaloids have been effectively used in<br>
the clinic, but they have undesirable side effects. In addition, many tumors appear to<br>
have weakened G2/M cell cycle checkpoints; in response to mitotic disruption these<br>
tumors attempt to bypass mitosis, leading to mitotic catastrophe and cell death.<br>
Several studies suggest that the disruption of mitosis by targeting PLK may be a<br>
feasible approach to selective tumor cell destruction. There remains a need in the art<br>
for new approaches to the treatment of neoplasms.<br>

and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and physiologically functional<br>
derivatives thereof.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the compounds of the present<br>
invention may also be utilized in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or<br>
solvate or physiologically functional derivative thereof. The pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (I) include conventional salts formed<br>
from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acids or bases as well as<br>
quaternary ammonium salts. More specific examples of suitable acid salts include<br>
hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, nitric, perchloric, fumaric, acetic,<br>
propionic, succinic, glycolic, formic, lactic, maleic, tartaric, citric, palmoic, malonic,<br>

methanesulfonic (mesylate), naphthalene-2-sulfonic, benzenesulfonic<br>
hydroxynaphthoic, hydroiodic, malic, steroic, tannic and the like.<br>
Other acids such as oxalic, while not in themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may<br>
be useful in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining the<br>
compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. More<br>
specific examples of suitable basic salts include sodium, lithium, potassium,<br>
magnesium, aluminium, calcium, zinc, N.N"-dibe"nzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine,<br>
choline, diethanolamine. ethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine and procaine salts.<br>
The term "solvate" as used herein refers to a complex of variable stoichiometry formed<br>
by a solute (a compound of formula (I)) and a solvent. Solvents, by way of example,<br>
include water, methanol, ethanol, or acetic acid.<br>
The term "physiologically functional derivative" as used herein refers to any<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable derivative of a compound of the present invention, for<br>
example, an ester or an amide of a compound of formula (I), which upon<br>
administration to an animal, particularly a mammal, such as a human, is capable of<br>
providing (directly or indirectly) a compound of the present invention or an active<br>
metabolite thereof See, for example, Burger"s Medicinal Chemistry And Drug<br>
Discovery, 5th Edition, Vol 1: Principles And Practice.<br>
Processes for preparing pharmaceutically acceptable salts, soivates and physiologically<br>
functional derivatives of the compounds of formula (I) are conventional in the art.<br>
See, e.g., Burger"s Medicinal Chemistry And Drug Discovery 5th Edition, Vol 1:<br>
Principles And Practice.<br>
As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, in the processes described below for the<br>
preparation of compounds of formula (I), certain intermediates, may be in the form of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, soivates or physiologically functional derivatives of<br>
the compound. Those terms as applied to any intermediate employed in the process of<br>
preparing compounds of formula (I) have the same meanings as noted above with<br>
respect to compounds of formula (I). Processes for preparing pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts, soivates and physiologically functional derivatives of such<br>
tenediates are known in the art and are analogous to the process for preparing<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and physiologically functional derivatives<br>
of the compounds of formula (I).<br>
Certain compounds of formula (I) may exist in stereoisomeric forms (e.g. they may<br>
contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms or may exhibit cis-trans isomerism).<br>
The individual stereoisomers (enantiomers and diastereomers) and mixtures of these<br>
are included within the scope of the present invention. The present invention also<br>
covers the individual isomers of the compounds represented by formula (I) as mixtures<br>
with isomers thereof in which one or more chiral centres are inverted. Certain<br>
compounds of formula (l}may be prepared as a mixture of regioisomers. The present<br>
invention covers both the mixture of regioisomers as well as the individual<br>
compounds. Likewise, it is understood that compounds of formula (I) may exist in.<br>
tautomeric forms other than that shown in the formula and these are also included<br>
within the scope of the present invention. In one particular embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the chiral compounds are present in the R conformation (i.e., the R-<br>
isomer of the compound).<br>
The compounds of the present invention are typically inhibitors of PLK. By PLK<br>
inhibitor is meant a compound which exhibits pIC50 greater than 4 in the PLK<br>
Inhibition assay described below in the examples or an IC50 less than 100 µM in the<br>
Methylene Blue Growth Inhibition assay described below in the examples; more<br>
particularly a PLK inhibitor is a compound which exhibits a pICso greater than 5 or an<br>
IC50 less than 10 µM using the methods described in the examples below.<br>
The present invention further provides compounds of formula (I) for use in medical<br>
therapy in an animal, e.g. a mammal such as a human. In particular, the present<br>
invention provides compounds of formula (I) for use in the treatment of a condition<br>
mediated by PLK. The present invention also provides compounds of formula (I) for<br>
use in the treatment of a susceptible neoplasm. The present invention provides<br>
compounds of formula (I) for use in treating a condition characterized by<br>
Imppropriate cellular proliferation. The present invention also provides compounds of<br>
formula (I) for use in inhibiting proliferation of a cell. The present invention also<br>
provides compounds of formula (I) for use in inhibiting mitosis in a cell.<br>
The present invention provides methods for the treatment of several conditions or<br>
diseases, all of which comprise the step of administering a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of a compound of formula (I). As used herein, the term "treatment" refers to<br>
alleviating the specified condition, eliminating or reducing the symptoms of the<br>
condition, slowing or eliminating the progression of the condition and preventing or<br>
delaying the reoccurrance of the condition in a previously afflicted subject<br>
As used herein, the term "therapeufrcally effective amount" means an amount of a<br>
compound of formula (I) which is sufficient, in the subject to which it is administered,<br>
to elicit the biological or medical response of a cell culture, tissue, system, animal<br>
(including human) that is being sought, for instance, by a researcher or clinician. For<br>
example, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) for the<br>
treatment of a condition mediated by PLK is an amount sufficient to treat the PLK<br>
mediated condition in the subject Similarly, a therapeutically effective amount of a<br>
compound of formula (I) for the treatment of a susceptible neoplasm is an amount<br>
sufficient to treat the susceptible neoplasm in the subject. In one embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula 0)<br>
is an amount sufficient to inhibit cell mitosis. In one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) is an<br>
amount sufficient to regulate, modulate, bind or inhibit PLK.<br>
The precise therapeutically effective amount of the compounds of formula (I) will<br>
depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the age and weight of<br>
the subject being treated, the precise disorder requiring treatment and its severity, the<br>
nature of the formulation, and the route of administration, and will ultimately be at<br>
the discretion of the attendant physcian or veternarian. Typically, the compound of<br>
formula (I) will be given for treatment in the range of 0.1 to 200 mg/kg body weight<br>
of recipient (animal) per day and more usually in the range of 1 to 100 mg/kg body<br>
weight per day. Acceptable daily dosages, may be from about 0.1 to about 2000<br>
mg/day, and preferably from about 0.1 to about 100 mg/day.<br>
As one aspect, the present invention provides methods of regulating, modulating,<br>
binding, or inhibiting PLK for the treatment of conditions mediated by PLK.<br>
"Regulating, modulating, binding or inhibiting PLK" refers to regulating, modulating,<br>
binding or inhibiting PLK activity, as well as regulating, modulating, binding or<br>
inhibiting overexpression of PLK. Such conditions include certain neoplasms<br>
(including cancers and tumors) which have been associated with PLK and conditions<br>
characterized by inappropriate cellular proliferation.<br>
The present invention provides a method for treating a condition mediated by PLK in<br>
an animal such as a mammal (e.g., a human), which method comprises administering<br>
to the animal a therapeuticaily effective amount of the compound of formula (I).<br>
Conditions which are mediated by PLK are known in the art and include but are not<br>
limited to neoplasms and conditions characterized by inappropriate cellular<br>
proliferation.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for treating a susceptible neoplasm<br>
(cancer or tumor) in an animal such as a mammal (e.g., a human), which method<br>
comprises administering to the animal a therapeuticaily effective amount of the<br>
compound of formula (I). "Susceptible neoplasm" as used herein refers to neoplasms<br>
which are susceptible to treatment with a PLK inhibitor. Neoplasms which have been<br>
associated with PLK and are therefor susceptible to treatment with a PLK inhibitor are<br>
known in the art, and include both primary and metastatic tumors and cancers. For<br>
example, susceptible neoplasms within the scope of the present invention include but<br>
are not limited to breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer (including small cell lung<br>
cancer and non-small cell lung cancer), prostate cancer, lymphoma, leukemia,<br>
endometrial cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, squamous<br>
carcinoma, carcinoma of the head and neck, and esophageal carcinoma. The<br>
compounas of formula (I) can be used alone in the treatment of such susceptible<br>
neoplasms or can be used to provide additive or synergistic effects with certain<br>
existing chemotherapies, and/or be used to restore effectiveness of certain existing<br>
chemotherapies and radiation.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for treating a condition characterized by<br>
inappropriate cellular proliferation. By "inapproriate cellular proliferation" is meant<br>
cellular proliferation resulting from inappropriate cell growth, cellular proliferation<br>
resulting from excessive cell division, cellular proliferation resulting from cell division<br>
at an accelerated rate, cellular proliferation resulting from inappropriate cell survival,<br>
and/or cellular proliferation in a normal cell occurring at a normal rate, which is<br>
neverthless undesired. Conditions characterized by inappropriate cellular proliferation<br>
include but are riot limited to neoplasms, blood vessel proliferative disorders, fibrotic<br>
disorders, mesangial cell proliferative disorders and metabolic diseases. Blood vessel<br>
proliferative disorders include arthritis and restenosis. Fibrotic disorders include<br>
hepatic cirrhosis and atherosclerosis. Mesangial cell proliferative disorders include<br>
glomerulonephritis, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombotic microangiopathy<br>
syndromes, organ transplant rejection and glomeruiopathies. Metabolic disorders<br>
include psoriasis, chronic wound healing, inflammation and neurodegenerative<br>
diseases. Osteoarthritis and other osteoclast proliferation dependent diseases of<br>
excess bone resorbtion are examples of conditions characterized by inapproprate<br>
cellular proliferation in which the cellular proliferation occurs in normal cells at a<br>
normal rate, but is nevertheless undesired.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for inhibiting proliferation of a cell,<br>
which method comprises contacting the cell with an amount of a compound of<br>
formula (I) sufficient to inhibit proliferation of the cell. In one particular embodiment,<br>
the cell is a neoplastic cell. In one particular embodiment, the cell is an<br>
inappropriately proliferative cell. The term "inappropriately proliferative cell" as used<br>
herein refers to cells that grow inappropriately (abnormally), cells that divide<br>
excessively or at an accelerated rate, ceils that inappropriately (abnormally) survive<br>
and/or normal cells that proliferate at a normal rate but for which proliferation is<br>
undesired. Neoplastic ceils (including cancer cells) are an example of inappropriately<br>
proliferative cells but are not the only inappropriately proliferative cells.<br>
PLK is essential for cellular mitosis and accordingly, the compounds of formula (I) are<br>
effective for inhibiting mitosis. "Inhibiting mitosis" refers to inhibiting the entry into<br>
the M phase of the cell cycle, inhibiting the normal progression of the M phase of the<br>
cell cycle once M phase has been entered and inhibiting the normal exit from the M<br>
phase of the cell cycle. Thus, the compounds of the present invention may inhibit<br>
mitosis by inhibiting the cell"s entry into mitosis, by inhibiting the cell"s progression<br>
through mitosis or by inhibiting the cell"s exit from mitosis. As one aspect, the present<br>
invention provides a method for inhibiting mitosis in a. cell, which method comprises<br>
administering to the cell an amount of a compound of formula (I) sufficient to inhibit<br>
mitosis. In one particular embodiment, the cell is a neoplastic cell. In one particular<br>
embodiment, the cell is an inappropriately proliferative cell.<br>
The present invention also provides the use of a compound of formula (I) for the<br>
preparation of a medicament for the treatment of condition mediated by PLK in an<br>
animal, such as a mammal (e.g., a human). The present invention further provides the<br>
use of a compound of formula (I) for the preparation of a medicament for the<br>
treatment of a susceptible neoplasm in an animal. The present invention further<br>
provides the use of a compound of formula (I) for the preparation of a medicament<br>
for the treatment of a condition characterized by inappropriate cellular proliferation.<br>
The present invention further provides the use of a compound of formula (I) for the<br>
preparation of a medicament for inhibiting proliferation of a cell. The present<br>
invention further provides the use of a compound of formula (I) for the preparation of<br>
a medicament for inhibiting mitosis in a cell.<br>
While it is possible that, for use in therapy, a therapeutically effective amount of a<br>
compound of formula (I) may be administered as the raw chemical, it is typically<br>
presented as the active ingredient of a pharmaceutical composition or formulation.<br>
Accordingly, the invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising<br>
a compound of the formula (I). The pharmaceutical composition may further comprise<br>
one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, and/or excipients. The<br>
carriers), diluent(s) and/or excipient(s) must be acceptable in the sense of being<br>
compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the<br>
recipient thereof. In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is also<br>
provided a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical formulation including<br>
admixing a compound of the formula (I) with one or more pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers, diluents and/or excipients.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations may be presented in unit dose form containing a<br>
predetermined amount of active ingredient per unit dose. Such a unit may contain a<br>
therapeutically effective dose of the compound of formula (I) or a fraction of a<br>
therapeutically effective dose such that multiple unit dosage forms might be<br>
administered at a given time to achieve the desired therapeutically effective dose.<br>
Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or sub-dose, as<br>
herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of an active ingredient<br>
Furthermore, such pharmaceutical formulations may be prepared by any of the<br>
methods well known in the pharmacy art.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations may be adapted for administration by any appropriate<br>
route, for example by the oral (including buccal or sublingual), rectal, nasal, topical<br>
(including buccal, sublingual or transdermal), vaginal or parenteral (including<br>
subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or intradermal) route. Such formulations<br>
may be prepared by any method known in the art of pharmacy, for example by<br>
bringing into association the active ingredient with the carriers) or excipient(s).<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for oral administration may be presented as<br>
discrete units such as capsules or tablets; powders or granules; solutions or<br>
suspensions in aqueous or non-aqueous liquids; edible foams or whips; or oil-in-water<br>
liquid emulsions or water-in-oil liquid emulsions.<br>
For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug<br>
component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Powders are prepared by<br>
comminuting the compound to a suitable fine size and mixing with a similarly<br>
comminuted pharmaceutical carrier such as an"edible carbohydrate, as, for example,<br>
starch or mannitol. Flavoring, preservative, dispersing and coloring agent can also be<br>
present<br>
Capsules are made by preparing a powder mixture as described above, and filling<br>
formed gelatin sheaths. Glidants and lubricants such as colloidal silica, talc,<br>
magnesium stearate, calcium stearate or solid polyethylene glycol can be added to the<br>
powder mixture before the filling operation. A disintegrating or solubilizing agent<br>
such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate or sodium carbonate can also be added to<br>
improve the availability of the medicament when the capsule is ingested.<br>
Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating<br>
agents and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable<br>
binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn<br>
sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes and the like. Lubricants used in<br>
these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate,<br>
sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators<br>
include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and<br>
the like. Tablets are formulated, for example, by preparing a powder mixture,<br>
granulating or slugging, adding a lubricant and disintegrant and pressing into tablets.<br>
A powder mixture is prepared by mixing the compound, suitably comminuted, with a<br>
diluent or base as described above, and optionally, with a binder such as<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, an aliginate, gelatin, or polyvinyl pyrrolidone. a solution<br>
retardant such as paraffin, a resorption accelerator such as a quaternary salt and/or an<br>
absorption agent such as bentonite, kaolin or dicalcium phosphate. The powder<br>
mixture can be granulated by wetting with a binder such as syrup, starch paste, acadia<br>
pactlage or solutions of cellulosic or polymeric materials and forcing through a<br>
screen. As an alternative to granulating, the powder mixture can be run through the<br>
tablet machine and the result is imperfectly formed slugs broken into granules. The<br>
granules can be lubricated to prevent sticking to the tablet forming dies by means of<br>
the addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt, talc or mineral oil. The lubricated mixture<br>
is then compressed into tablets. The compounds of the present invention can also be<br>
combined with a free flowing inert carrier and compressed into tablets directly<br>
without going through the granulating or slugging steps. A clear or opaque<br>
protective coating consisting of a sealing coat of shellac, a coating of sugar or<br>
polymeric material and a polish coating of wax can be provided. Dyestuffs can be<br>
added to these coatings to distinguish different unit dosages.<br>
oral fluids such as solution, syrups and elixirs can be prepared in dosage unit form so<br>
that a given quantity contains a predetermined amount of active ingredient Syrups<br>
can be prepared by dissolving the compound in a suitably flavored aqueous solution,<br>
while elixirs are prepared through the use of a non-toxic alcoholic vehicle.<br>
Suspensions can be formulated by dispersing the compound in a non-toxic vehicle.<br>
Solubilizers and emulsifiers such as ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and polyoxy<br>
ethylene sorbitol ethers, preservatives, flavor additive such as peppermint oil or<br>
natural sweeteners or saccharin or other artificial sweeteners, and the like can also be<br>
added.<br>
Where appropriate, dosage unit formulations for oral administration can be<br>
microencapsulated. The formulation can also be prepared to prolong or sustain the<br>
release as for example by coating or embedding particulate material in polymers, wax<br>
or the like.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can also be administered in the form of liposome<br>
delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles and<br>
multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such<br>
as cholesterol, stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may also be delivered by the use of monoclonal<br>
antibodies as individual carriers to which the compound molecules are coupled. The<br>
compounds may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers.<br>
Such polymers can include peptides, polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer,<br>
polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamide -phenol, polyhydroxyethylaspartamidephenol, or<br>
polyethyleneoxidepolylysine substituted with palmitoyl residues. Furthermore, the<br>
compounds may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving<br>
controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polepsilon caprolactone,<br>
polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans,<br>
polycyanoacrylates and cross-linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for transdermal administration may be<br>
presented as discrete patches intended to remain in intimate contact with the<br>
epidermis of the recipient for a prolonged period of time. For example, the active<br>
ingredient may be delivered from the patch by iontophoresis as generally described in<br>
Pharmaceutical Research, 3(6):318 (1986).<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administration may be formulated as<br>
ointments, creams, suspensions, lotions, powders, solutions, pastes, gels, sprays,<br>
aerosols or oils.<br>
For treatments of the eye or other external tissues, for example mouth and skin, the<br>
formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream. When formulated<br>
in an ointment, the active ingredient may be employed with either a paraffinic or a<br>
water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be formulated<br>
in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base or a water-in-oil base.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administrations to the eye include<br>
eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier,<br>
especially an aqueous solvent<br>
rmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administration in the mouth include<br>
lozenges, pastilles and mouth washes.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for rectal administration may be presented as<br>
suppositories or as enemas.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for nasal administration wherein the carrier is a<br>
solid include a coarse powder having a particle size for example in the range 20 to 500<br>
microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid<br>
inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to<br>
the nose. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid, for administration as a<br>
nasal spray or as nasal drops, include aqueous or oil solutions of the active ingredient.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for administration by inhalation include fine<br>
particle dusts or mists, which may be generated by means of various types of metered,<br>
dose pressurised aerosols, nebulizers or insufflators.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for vaginal administration may be presented as<br>
pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for parenteral administration include aqueous<br>
and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers,<br>
bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the<br>
intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may<br>
include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented<br>
in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may<br>
be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the<br>
sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use.<br>
Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile<br>
powders, granules and tablets.<br>
it should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned<br>
above, the formulations may include other agents conventional in the art having<br>
regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral<br>
administration may include flavouring agents.<br>
In the above-described methods of treatment and uses, a compound of formula (I)<br>
may be employed alone, in combination with one or more other compounds of<br>
formula (I) or in combination with other therapeutic agents. In particular, in methods<br>
of treating conditions mediated by PLK and methods of treating susceptible<br>
neoplasms, combination with other chemotherapeutic, hormonal and/or antibody<br>
agents is envisaged as well as combination with surgical therapy and radiotherapy.<br>
The term "chemotherapeutic" as used herein refers to any chemical agent having a<br>
therapeutic effect on the subject to which it is administered. "Chemotherapeutic"<br>
agents include but are not limited to anti-neoplastic agents, analgesics and anti-<br>
emetics. As used herein, "anti-neoplastic agents" include both cytostatic and<br>
cytotoxic agents. Combination therapies according to the present invention thus<br>
comprise the administration of at least one compound of formula (I) and the use of at<br>
least one other cance treatment method. In one embodiment, combination therapies<br>
according to the present invention comprise the administration of at least one<br>
compound of formula (I) and at least one other chemotherapeutic agent. In one<br>
particular embodiment, the present invention comprises the administration of at least<br>
one compound of formula (I) and at least one anti-neoplastic agent As an additional<br>
aspect, the present invention provides the methods of treatment and uses as described<br>
above, which comprise administering a compound of formula (I) together with at least<br>
one chemotherapeutic agent In one particular embodiment, the chemotherapeutic<br>
agent is an anti-neoplastic agent. In another embodiment, the present invention<br>
provides a pharmaceutical composition as described above further comprising at least<br>
one other chemotherapeutic agent, more particularly, the chemotheraDeutic agent is<br>
an anti-neoplastic agent<br>
iccally, any chemotherapeutic agent that has activity versus a susceptible neoplasm<br>
being treated may be utilized in combination with the compounds of formula (I),<br>
provided that the particular agent is clinically compatible with therapy employing a<br>
compound of formula (I). Typical anti-neoplastic agents useful in the present<br>
invention include, but are not limited to, anft-microtubule agents such as diterpenoids<br>
and vinca alkaloids; platinum coordination complexes; alkylating agents such as<br>
nitrogen mustards, oxazaphosphor-ines, alkylsulfonates, nitrosoureas, and triazenes;<br>
antibiotic agents such as anthracyclins, actinomycins and bleomycins; topoisomerase 11<br>
inhibitors such as epipodophyllotoxins; antimetabolites such as purine and pyrimidine<br>
analogues and anti-folate compounds; topoisomerase I inhibitors such as<br>
camptothecins; hormones and hormonal analogues; signal transduction pathway<br>
inhibitors; non-receptor tyrosine kinase angiogenesis inhibitors; immunotherapeutic<br>
agents; proapoptotic agents; and cell cycle signaling inhibitors.<br>
Anti-microtubule or anti-mitotic agents are phase specific agents active against the<br>
microtubules of tumor cells during M or the mitosis phase of the cell cycle. Examples<br>
of anti-microtubule agents include, but are not limited to, diterpenoids and vinca<br>
alkaloids. Examples of diterpenoids include, but are not limited to, paclitaxel and its<br>
analog docetaxel. Examples of vinca alkaloids include, but are not limited to,<br>
vinblastine, vincristine, and vinorelbine.<br>
Platinum coordination complexes are non-phase specific anti-neoplastic agents, which<br>
are interactive with DNA. The platinum complexes enter tumor cells, undergo,<br>
aquation and form intra- and interstrand crosslinks with DNA causing adverse<br>
biological effects to the tumor. Examples of platinum coordination complexes<br>
include, but are not limited to, cisplatin and carboplatin.<br>
Alkylating agents are non-phase anti-neoplastic specific agents and strong<br>
electrophiles. Typically, alkylating agents form covalent linkages, by alkylation, to<br>
DNA through nucleophilic moieties of the DNA molecule such as phosphate, amino,<br>
and hydroxyl groups. Such alkylation disrupts nucleic acid function leading to cell<br>
path Examples of alkylating agents include, but are not limited to, nitrogen<br>
mustards such as cyclophosphamide, melphalan, and chlorambucil; alkyl sulfonates<br>
such as busulfan; nitrosoureas such as carmustine; and triazenes such as dacarbazine.<br>
Antibiotic chemotherapeutic agents are non-phase specific agents, which bind or<br>
intercalate with DNA. Typically, such action results in stable DNA complexes or strand<br>
breakage, which disrupts ordinary function of the nucleic acids leading to cell death.<br>
Examples of antibiotic anti-neoplastic agents include, but are not limited to,<br>
actinomycins such as dactinomycin, anthrocyclins such as daunorubicin and<br>
doxorubicin; and bleomycins.<br>
Topoisomerase II inhibitors include, but are not limited to, epipodophyllotoxins.<br>
Epipodophyllotoxins are phase specific anti-neoplastic agents derived from the<br>
mandrake plant Epipodophyllotoxins typically affect cells in the S and G2 phases of<br>
the cell cycle by forming a ternary complex with topoisomerase II and DNA causing<br>
DNA strand breaks. The strand breaks accumulate and cell death follows. Examples of<br>
epipodophyllotoxins include, but are not limited to, etoposide and teniposide.<br>
Antimetabolite neoplastic agents are phase specific anti-neoplastic agents that act at<br>
S phase (DNA synthesis) of the cell cycle by inhibiting DNA synthesis or by inhibiting<br>
purine or pyrimidine base synthesis and thereby limiting DNA synthesis. Consequently,<br>
S phase does not proceed and cell death follows. Examples of antimetabolite anti-<br>
neoplastic agents include, but are not limited to, fluorouracil, methotrexate,<br>
cytarabine, mecaptopurine and thioguanine.<br>
Camptothecins, including, camptothecin and camptothecin derivatives are available or<br>
under development as Topoisomerase I inhibitors. Camptothecins cytotoxic activity is<br>
believed to be related to its Topoisomerase I inhibitory activity. Examples of<br>
camptothecins include, but are not limited to irinotecan, topotecan, and the various<br>
optical forms of 7-(4-methy!piperazino-methylene)-10,11 -ethylenedioxy-20-<br>
camptothecin.<br>
Narones and hormonal analogues are useful compounds for treating cancers in<br>
which there is a relationship between the hormone(s) and growth and/or lack of<br>
growth of the cancer. Examples of hormones and hormonal analogues believed to be<br>
useful in the treatment of neoplasms include, but are not limited to, adrenocorti-<br>
costeroids such as prednisone and prednisolone which are useful in the treatment of<br>
malignant lymphoma and acute leukemia in children; aminoglutethimide and other<br>
aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole, letrazole, vorazole, and exemestane useful in<br>
the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma and hormone dependent breast carcinoma<br>
containing estrogen receptors; progestrins such as megestrol acetate useful in the<br>
treatment of hormone dependent breast cancer and endometrial carcinoma;<br>
estrogens, androgens, and anti-androgens such as flutamide, nilutamide, bicalutamide,<br>
cyproterone acetate and 5<x-reductases such as finasteride and dutasteride useful in></x-reductases>
the treatment of prostatic carcinoma and benign prostatic hypertrophy; anti-<br>
estrogens such as tamoxifen, toremifene, raloxifene, droloxifene and iodoxyfene<br>
useful in the treatment of hormone dependent breast carcinoma; and gonadotropin-<br>
releasing hormone (GnRH) and analogues thereof which stimulate the release of<br>
leutinizing hormone (LH) and/or follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) for the treatment<br>
prostatic carcinoma, for instance, LHRH agonists and antagagonists such as goserelin<br>
acetate and luprolide.<br>
Signal transduction pathway inhibitors are those inhibitors which block or inhibit a<br>
chemical process which evokes an intracellular change. As used herein this change is<br>
cell proliferation or differentiation. Signal tranduction inhibitors useful in the present<br>
invention include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases, non-receptor tyrosine<br>
kinases, SH2/SH3 domain blockers, serine/threonine kinases, phosphotidyl inositol-3<br>
kinases, myo-inositol signaling, and Ras oncogenes.<br>
Several protein tyrosine kinases catalyse the phosphorylation of specific tyrosyl<br>
residues in various proteins involved in the regulation of cell growth. Such protein<br>
tyrosine kinases can be broadly classified as receptor or non-receptor kinases.<br>
Recptor tyrosine kinases are transmembrane proteins having an extracellular ligand<br>
binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and a tyrosine kinase domain. Receptor<br>
tyrosine kinases are involved in the regulation of cell growth and are sometimes<br>
termed growth factor receptors. Inappropriate or uncontrolled activation of many of<br>
these kinases, i.e. aberrant kinase growth factor receptor activity, for example by over-<br>
expression or mutation, has been shown to result in uncontrolled cell growth.<br>
Accordingly, the aberrant activity of such kinases has been linked to malignant tissue<br>
growth. Consequently, inhibitors of such kinases could provide cancer treatment<br>
methods. Growth factor receptors include, for example, epidermal growth factor<br>
receptor (EGFr, ErbB2 and ErbB4,), platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFr),<br>
vascular endotbelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), tyrosine kinase with<br>
immunoglobulin-like and epidermal growth factor homology domains (TIE-2), insulin<br>
growth factor-l receptor (IGF-I), macrophage colony stimulating factor (cfms), BTK,<br>
ckit, cmet, Fibrobtast growth factor (FGF) receptors, Trk receptors (TrkA, TrkB, and<br>
TrkC), ephrin (eph) receptors, and the RET protooncogene. Several inhibitors of growth<br>
factor receptors are under development and include ligand antagonists, antibodies,<br>
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anti-sense oligonucleotides and aptamers. Growth factor<br>
receptors and agents that inhibit growth factor receptor function are described, for<br>
instance, in Kath, John C, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents (2000) 10(6):803-818; Shawver et al<br>
DDT Vol 2, No. 2 February 1997; and Lofts, F. J. et al, "Growth Factor Receptors as<br>
Targets", New Molecular Targets for Cancer Chemotherapy, Ed. Workman, Paul and<br>
Kerr, David, CRC Press 1994, London.<br>
Tyrosine kinases, which are not growth factor receptor kinases are termed non<br>
receptor tyrosine kinases. Non-receptor tyrosine kinases useful in the present<br>
invention, which are targets or potential targets of anti-neoplastic drugs, include cSrc,<br>
Lck, Fyn, Yes, Jak, cAbl, FAK (Focal adhesion kinase), Brutons tyrosine kinase, and Bcr-<br>
Abl. Such non-receptor kinases and agents which inhibit non-receptor tyrosine kinase<br>
function are described in Sinh, S. and Corey, SJ., (1999) Journal of Hematotherapy and<br>
Stem Cell Research 8 (5): 465 - 80; and Bolen, J.B., Brugge, J.S., (1997) Annual Review<br>
of Immunology. 15:371-404.<br>
SH2/SH3 domain blockers are agents that disrupt SH2 or SH3 domain binding in a<br>
variety of enzymes or adaptor, proteins including, P13-K p85 subunit, Src family<br>
kinases, adaptor molecules (She, Crk, Nek, Grb2) and Ras-GAP. SH2/SH3 domains as<br>
targets for anti-cancer drugs are discussed in Smithgall, T.E (1995), Journal of<br>
Pharmacological and Toxicological Methods. 34(3) 125-32.<br>
Inhibitors of Serine/Threonine Kinases including MAP kinase cascade blockers which<br>
include blockers of Raf kinases (Rafk), Mitogen or Extracellular Regulated Kinase<br>
(MEKs), and Extracellular Regulated Kinases (ERKs); and Protein kinase C family<br>
member blockers including blockers of subtypes of PKCs (alpha, beta, gamma, epsilon,<br>
rriu, lambda, iota, zeta), IkB kinase family (IKKa, IKKb), PKB family kinases, Akt kinase<br>
family members, and TGF beta receptor kinases. Such Serine/Threonine kinases and<br>
inhibitors thereof are described in Yamamoto, T., Taya, S., Kaibuchi, K., (1999), Journal<br>
of Biochemistry. 126 (5) 799-803; Brodt, P, Samani, A., and Navab, R. (2000),<br>

Research. 78:3-27, Lackey, K. et al Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, (10),<br>
2000,223-226; and Martinez-lacati, L, et al, Int J. Cancer (2000), 88(1), 44-52.<br>
Inhibitors of Phosphotidyl lnositol-3 Kinase family members including blockers of<br>
PI3-kinase, ATM, DNA-PK, and Ku are also useful in combination with the present<br>
invention. Such kinases are discussed in Abraham, R.T (1996), Current Opinion in<br>
Immunology. 8 (3) 412-8; Canman, C.E., Lim, D.S. (1998), Oncogene 17 (25) 3301-<br>
3308; Jackson, S.P. (1997), International Journal of Biochemistry and Cell Biology. 29<br>
(7):935-8; and Zhong, H. et al, Cancer Res, (2000) 60(6), 1541-1545.<br>
Also useful in combination with the present invention are Myo-inositol signaling<br>
inhibitors such as phospholipase C blockers and Myoinositol analogues. Such signal<br>
inhibitors are described in Powis. G., and Kozikowski A., (1994) New Molecular Targets<br>
for Cancer Chemotherapy ed., Paul Workman and David Kerr, CRC Press 1994, London.<br>
other group of signal transduction pathway inhibitors useful in combination with<br>
the present invention are inhibitors of Ras Oncogene. Such inhibitors include<br>
inhibitors of farnesyltransferase, geranyl-geranyl transferase, and CAAX proteases as<br>
well as anti-sense oiigonucleotides, ribozymes and immunotherapy. Such inhibitors<br>
have been shown to block Ras activation in cells containing wild type mutant Ras,<br>
thereby acting as antiproliferation agents. Ras oncogene inhibition is discussed in<br>
Scharovsky, O.G., Rozados, V.R., Gervasoni, S.I. Matar, P. (2000), Journal of Biomedical<br>
Science. 7(4) 292-8; Ashby. M.N. (1998). Current Opinion in Lipidology. 9(2)99-102;<br>
and BioChim. Biophys. Acta, (1989) 1423(3):19-30.<br>
As mentioned above, antibodies to receptor kinase ligand binding may also serve as<br>
signal transduction inhibitors. This group of signal transduction pathway inhibitors<br>
includes the use of humanized antibodies to the extracellular ligand binding domain<br>
of receptor tyrosine kinases. For example, Imclone C225 EGFR specific antibody (see<br>
Green, M.C. et al, Monoclonal Antibody Therapy for Solid Tumors, Cancer Treat Rev.,<br>
(2000), 26(4), 269-286); Herceptin® ErbB2 antibody (see Tyrosine Kinase Signaling in<br>
BreasfrCancer:ErbB Family Receptor Tyrosine Kinases, Breast Cancer Res., 2000,2(3),<br>
176-183); and 2CB VE6FR2 specific antibody (see Brekken, RA et al, Selective<br>
Inhibition of VEGFR2 Activity by a Monoclonal Anti-VEGF Antibody Blocks Tumor<br>
Growth in Mice, Cancer Res. (2000) 60.5117-5124).<br>
Receptor kinase angiogenesis inhibitors may also find use in the present invention.<br>
Inhibitors of angiogenesis related VEGFR and TIE2 are discussed above in regard to<br>
signal transduction inhibitors (both receptors are receptor tyrosine kinases). Other<br>
inhibitors may be used in combination with the compounds of the present invention.<br>
For example, anti-VEGF antibodies, which do not recognize VEGFR (the receptor<br>
tyrosine kinase), but bind to the ligand; small molecule inhibitors of integrin (alphav<br>
betas) that will inhibit angiogenesis; endostatin and angiostatin (non-RTK) may also<br>
prove useful in combination with PLK inhibitors.<br>
Agents used in immunotherapeutic regimens may also be useful in combination with<br>
the compounds of formula (I).<br>
Agents used in proapoptotic regimens (e.g., bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotides) may also<br>
be used in the combination of the present invention. Members of the Bcl-2 family of<br>
proteins block apoptosis. Upregulation of bcl-2 has therefore been linked to<br>
chemoresistance. Studies have shown that the epidermal growth factor (EGF)<br>
stimulates anti-apoptotic members of the bcl-2 family (i.e., md-1). Therefore,<br>
strategies designed to downregulate the expression of bcl-2 in tumors have<br>
demonstrated clinical benefit and are now in Phase ll/lll trials, namely Genta"s G3139<br>
bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide. Such proapoptotic strategies using the antisense<br>
oligonucleotide strategy for bcl-2 are discussed in Water JS et al., J. Clin. Oncol.<br>
18:1812-1823 (2000);and Kitada S et al., Antisense Res. Dev. 4:71-79 (1994).<br>
Cell cycle signaling inhibitors inhibit molecules involved in the control of the cell<br>
cycle. Cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and their interaction cyclins control<br>
progression through the eukaryotic cell cycle. The coordinated activation and<br>
inactivatibn of different cydin/CDK complexes is necessary for normal progression<br>
through the cell cycle. Several inhibitors of cell cycle signaling are under<br>
development For instance, examples of cyclin dependent kinases, including CDK2,<br>
CDK4, and CDK6 and inhibitors for the same are described in, for instance, Rosania, et<br>
al., Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 10(2):215-230 (2000).<br>
in one embodiment, the methods of the present invention comprise administering to<br>
the animal a compound of formula (I) in combination with a signal transduction<br>
pathway inhibitor, particularly gefitinib (IRESSA®).<br>
The methods and uses employing these combinations may comprise the administration<br>
of the compound of formula (I) and the other chemotherapeutic/anti-neoplastic agent<br>
either sequentially in any order or simultaneously in separate or combined<br>
pharmaceutical compositions. When combined in the same formulation it will be<br>
appreciated that the two compounds must be stable and compatible with each other<br>
and the other components of the formulation and may be formulated for<br>
administration. When formulated separately they may be provided in any convenient<br>
formulation, in such a manner as are known for such compounds in the art.<br>
When a compound of formula (I) is used in combination with a chemotherapeutic<br>
agent, the dose of each compound may differ from that when the compound is used<br>
alone. Appropriate doses will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art The<br>
appropriate dose of the compound(s) of formula (I) and the other therapeutically<br>
active agent(s) and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to<br>
achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect, and are within the expertise and<br>
discretion of the attendent clinician.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may be conveniently prepared by the methods outlined in<br>

II. Methylene Blue Growth Inhibition Assay<br>
Normal Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) and human colon (HCT116, RKO), lung<br>
(H460), prostate (PC3), and breast tumor (MCF7) cell lines were cultured in high<br>
glucose DMEM (Life Technologies) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C in<br>
a humidified 10% CO2, 90% air incubator. Cells were harvested using trypsin/EDTA,<br>
counted using a haemocytometer, and plated in 100 µl of the appropriate media, at<br>
the following densities, in a 96-well tissue culture plate (Falcon 3075): HFF 5,000<br>
Cells/well, HCT116 3,000 cells/well, RKO 2,500 cells/well, H460 2,000 cells/well, PC3<br>
8,000 cells/well, MCF7 4,000 cells/well. The next day, compounds were diluted in<br>
DMEM containing 100 u.g/ml gentamicin, at twice the final required concentration,<br>
from 10 mM stock solutions in DMSO. 100 µl/well of these dilutions were added to<br>
the 100 µl of media currently on the cell plate"s. Medium containing 0.6% DMSO was<br>
added to control wells. Compounds diluted in DMEM were added to all cell lines. The<br>
final concentration of DMSO in all wells was 0.3%. Cells were incubated at 37°C, 10%<br>
CO2 for 3 days. Medium was removed by aspiration. Cell biomass was estimated by<br>
staining cells with 90 µl per well methylene blue (Sigma M9140,0.5% in 50:50<br>
ethanokwater), and incubation at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Stain<br>
was removed, and the plates rinsed under a gentle stream of water, and air-dried. To<br>
release stain from the cells 100 µl of solubilization solution was added (1% N-lauroyl<br>
sarcosine, Sodium salt, Sigma L5125, in PBS), and plates were shaken gently for about<br>
30 minutes. Optical density at 620 nM was measured on a microplate reader. Percent<br>
inhibition of cell growth was calculated relative to vehicle treated control wells.<br>
Concentration of compound that inhibits 50% of cell growth (IC50) was interpolated<br>
using nonlinear regression (LevenbergrMarquardt) and the equation, y = Vnax*(1-<br>
(x/(K+x))) + Y2, where "K" was equal to the ICso. The data obtained reported in Table 1<br>
