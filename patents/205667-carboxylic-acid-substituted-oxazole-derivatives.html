VRBOXYLIC ACID SUBSTITUTED OXAZOLE DERIVATIVES FOR USE AS PPAR-ALPHA AND -GAMMA ACTIVATORS IN THE TREATMENT OF DIABETES<br>
The present invention is concerned with novel oxazole derivatives, their manufacture and their use as medicaments. In particular, the invention relates to compounds of the formula (I)<br><br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof, wherein<br>
R1	is aryl or heteroaryl;<br>
R2, R3, R4 and R6 independently from each other are hydrogen, hydroxy, lower-alkenyl,<br>
halogen, lower-alkyl or lower-alkoxy, wherein at least one ofR',RJ,R*andR° is not hydrogen, or<br>
R3 and R4 are bonded to each other to form a ring together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached, and R3 and R4 together are -CH=CH-S-, -S-CH=CH-, -CH=CH-0-, -0-CH=CH-, -CH=CH-CH=CH-, -(CH2)3-5-, -0-(CH2)2-3- or-(CH2)2-3-0- and, wherein R2 and R6 are as defined above;<br><br><br><br>
wherein the bond between the carbon atom Ca and the carbon atom Cb is a carbon carbon single or double bond.<br>
Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPAR's) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor super family, which are ligand-activated transcription factors regulating gene expression. Various subtypes thereof have been identified and cloned. These include PPARa, PPAR0 (also known as PPAR5), and PPARy. There exist at least two major isoforms of PPARy. While PPARyl is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues, the longer isoform PPARy2 is almost exclusively found in adipocytes. In contrast, PPARa is predominantly expressed in the liver, kidney and heart. PPAR's modulate a variety of body responses including glucose- and lipid- homeostasis, cell differentiation, inflammatory responses and cardiovascular events.<br>
Diabetes is a disease in which a patient's ability to control glucose levels in blood is impaired, because he has partially lost the ability to respond properly to the action of insulin. In type II diabetes (T2D), often referred to as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), which afflicts 80-90 % of all diabetic patients in developed countries, the Isles of Langerhans in the pancreas still produce insulin. However, the target organs, mainly muscle, liver and adipose tissue, exhibit a profound resistance to insulin stimulation, and the body compensates by producing unphysiologically high levels of insulin. In later stage of disease, however, insulin secretion decreases due to exhaustion of the pancreas. In addition to that T2D is a metabolic-cardiovascular disease sysndrome. Among the comorbidities associated with T2D are for example insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory atherosclerosis.<br>
Current first line treatment for diabetes generally involves low fat - and glucose - diet and exercise. However, compliance can be moderate and as the disease progresses, treatment with hypoglycemic drugs, e.g. sulfonylureas or metformin, becomes necessary. A promising new class of drugs has recently been introduced that resensitizes patients to their own insulin (insulin sensitizers), thereby reverting blood glucose and triglyceride levels to normal, and thus abolishing, or at least reducing, the requirement for exogenous insulin. Pioglitazone (Actos™) and rosiglitazone (Avandia™) belong to the thiazolidinediones (TZD) class of PPARy-agonists and were the first representatives who<br><br>
had been approved for NIDDM in several countries. These compounds, however, suffer from side effects including rare but severe liver toxicity (as seen with troglitazone), and they increase body weight in humans. Therefore, new, better and more efficacious drugs for the treatment of NIDDM are urgently needed. Recent studies provide evidence that a coagonism on PPARa and PPARy would result in compounds with enhanced therapeutic potential, i. e. with an improved lipid profile effect on top of the normalization of glucose-and insulin-levels (Keller and Wahli: Trends Endocrin. Metab. 1993; 4:291-296, Macdonald and Lane: Current Biology Vol.5 pp.618-621 (1995)).<br>
The novel compounds of the present invention exceed the compounds known in the art, inasmuch as they bind to and activate both, PPARa and PPARy, simultaneously and very efficiently. Therefore, these compounds combine the anti-glycemic effect of PPARy activation with the anti-dyslipidemic effect of PPARa activation. Consequently, plasma glucose and insulin are reduced (=insulin sensitization), triglycerides lowered and HDL cholesterol increased (=improved lipid profile). In addition, such compounds may also lower LDL cholesterol, decrease blood pressure and counteract inflammatory atherosclerosis. Since multiple facets of the T2D disease syndrome are addressed by PPARa and y coagonists, they are expected to have an enhanced therapeutic potential compared to the compounds already known in the art.<br>
The compounds of the present invention further exhibit improved pharmacological properties compared to known compounds.<br>

Aryl-oxazole compounds 2 (prepared as outlined in schemes 11-12) are condensed with phenols 1 or aldehydes 6 according to well known procedures: if R12 represents a hydroxy group e. g. via a Mitstmobu-reaction, with triphenylphosphine and di-tert-butyK diisopropyl- or diethyl-azodicarboxylate as reagents; the Mitsunobu-<br><br>
reaction is preferably carried out in a solvent like toluene or tetrahydrofuran at ambient temperature. Alternatively, if R12 represents a halide, mesylate or tosylate moiety, the aryl-oxazole compounds 2 can be reacted with phenols 1 or aldehydes 6 in solvents like N,N-dimethylformamide, acetone or methyl-ethyl ketone in the presence of a weak base like cesium or potassium carbonate at a temperature ranging from room temperature to 140°C, preferably around 50°C; thus ether compounds 3 or aldehydes 5 are obtained (step a). The former are then subjected to bromomethylation, e. g. by treatment with trioxane and HBr, preferably 62% aq. HBr, in an inert solvent, preferably dichloromethane, preferably at 0°C giving a highly reactive, often quite unstable electrophile 4 (step b). The electrophile 4 is suitable to alkylate an enolate of alkoxy-acetic acid esters 7 (R11 = lower alkyl), preferably the lithium-enolate, prepared at -78°C by treatment of 7 with a strong, non-nucleophilic base like lithium diisopropylamide in an inert solvent like tetrahydrofuran. To increase the reactivity of the enolate nucleophile, the reaction is preferably performed in the presence of a cosolvent like hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) or l,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(lH)-pyrimidinone (DMPU) to give esters 9 (step d). Alternatively, aldehyde compounds 5, which are also available by Vilsmeier formylation or through formylation with dichloromethyl methyl ether in the presence of titanium tetrachloride, preferably in dichloromethane at temperatures between -78°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent (step c), are reacted with an enolate of alkoxy-acetic acid esters 7 (preferably the lithium-enolate, prepared at -78°C by treatment of 7 with a strong, non-nucleophilic base like lithium diisopropylamide in an inert solvent like tetrahydrofuran), preferably at temperatures around-78°C, in solvents like tetrahydrofuran giving the aldol product 8 as a mixture of diasteromers (step e). Removal of the benzylic hydroxy group in 8 with a reducing agent like e. g. triethylsilane in the presence of a Lewis acid, like boron-trifluoride, or a protic acid, like trifluoroacetic acid, in a suitable solvent like trifluoroacetic acid itself or dichloromethane between 0°C and 60°C gives racemic esters 9 (step f)« Alternatively, aldehydes 5 can be reacted with a Wittigsalt such as (ethoxy-ethoxycarbonyl-methyl)-triphenyl-phosphonium chloride or (methoxy-methoxycarbonyl-methyl)-triphenyl-phosphonium bromide in solvents like isopropanol, dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran or mixtures thereof in the presence of a base like potassium carbonate or l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), preferably between 0°C and the reflux temperature of the solvents, giving acrylic esters 10 as E and/or Z isomers (step g). Hydrogenation of acrylic esters 10 using palladium on charcoal as catalyst, preferably at room temperature and 1 atm. pressure of hydrogen, in solvents like methanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetic acid, dichloromethane and mixtures thereof, affords racemic esters 9 (step h). Hydrogenation of compounds in which R3-R4 together with the attached benzene ring form a benzofuran moiety can be performed using extended reaction times to provide the corresponding benzo-dihydrofuran analogues. In compounds, in which R*-R4 together with the attached benzene ring form a<br><br>
benzothiophene moiety, the double bond reduction is preferably performed with magnesium in solvent mixtures like tetrahydrofiiran/methanol between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents. The esters 9 and 10 can optionally be hydrolyzed according to standard procedures, e. g. by treatment with an alkali hydroxide like LiOH or NaOH in a polar solvent mixture like tetrahydrofuran/ethanol/water leading to carboxylic acids 11 (step i).<br>
Scheme 2<br><br>
Aldehydes 3 (optionally carrying a protective function) can be obtained from phenols 1 or protected phenols 2 (introduction of protective function, preferably a benzyl ether: step a), by known formylation reactions such as the VUsmeier formylation or formylation by dichloromethyl methyl ether in the presence of titanium tetrachloride, preferably in<br><br>
dichloromethane at temperatures between -78°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent (step b). Aldehydes 3 can then be reacted with a Wittig salt such as (ethoxy-ethoxycarbonyl*methyl)-triphenyl-phosphonium chloride or (methoxy-methoxycarbonyl-methyl)-triphenyl-phosphonium bromide in solvents like isopropanol, dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran or mixtures thereof in the presence of a base like potassium carbonate or l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), preferably between 0°C and the reflux temperature of the solvents, giving acrylic esters 4 as E and/or Z isomers (step c). Catalytic hydrogenation of acrylic esters 4 with palladium on charcoal in solvents like methanol, ethanol or tetrahydrofuran leads to phenols 5 (step d). In cases, where R3 and R4 form together with the attached benzene ring a benzothiophene or a benzofuran moiety, a two step procedure is preferred: in a first reaction, the double bond of the acrylic ester moiety is reduced using magnesium in a mixture of methanol and tetrahydrofuran between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents. Subsequently, the protecting group like a benzyl ether is cleaved, e. g. by using dimethyl sulfide and boron trifluoride diethyl etherate in a solvent like dichloromethane between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent to give phenolic compounds 5. Those are then condensed with aryloxazoles 6 to ether compounds 7 (step e) using well known procedures described in scheme 1 for the condensation of phenols 1 or 4-hydroxy-benzaldehydes 6 with arlyoxazoies. Esters 7 can optionally be saponified to acids 8 using standard conditions of i    alkaline hydrolysis (step f).<br><br><br>
Alpha amino esters 4 may be prepared by i) transformation of a protected glycine ester, preferably N-(diphenylmethylene) glycine ethyl ester, into a corresponding enolate, preferably the lithium-enolate, preferably at -78°C, by treatment with a strong, non-nucleophilic base like lithium diisopropylamide in an inert solvent like tetrahydrofuran; ii) reaction of the thus formed enolate with benzylbromides 1 (compounds 4 in scheme 1), preferably between -78°C and room temperature, preferably in the presence of a cosolvent<br><br>
which increases the reactivity of the nucleophile like hexamethylphospnoramiae ^mvir/v or l&gt;3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(lH)-pyrimidinone (DMPU); iii) hydrolysis of the imine intermediate with an acid, e, g. diluted hydrogen chloride solution (step a). Alternatively, alpha amino esters 4 can be prepared from aldehydes 2 (compounds 5 in scheme 1), by i) condensation with a suitable phosphonoglycine ester e. g. N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-alpha-phosphonoglycine trimethyl ester in solvents like dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a base like Huenig's base between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent leading to enamine carbamates 3; ii) catalytic hydrogenation and deprotection of enamine carbamates 3 using e. g. hydrogen in the presence of palladium on charcoal in solvents like ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran or methanol (steps b, c). Optically pure alpha amino esters 4 (preferably the (S)-isomers) can be obtained i) by chromatographic separation into antipodes using a preparative chiral HPLC column or ii) by catalytic hydrogenation of enamine carbamates 3 in the presence of rhodium catalysts carrying chiral ligands like l,2-bis[(2S,5S)-2,5-diethylphospholano]-benzene [compare J. Am. Chem. Soc. (2000), 122(16), 3830-3838] in solvents like methanol followed by removal of the Z-protective group using standard reaction conditions like hydrogenolysis with the help of a palladium catalyst. Alpha amino esters 4 are then converted into enamines 5 by reaction with suitable ketones in inert solvents like toluene, optionally in the presence of a catalyst like p-toluene sulfonic acid, and at reflux temperature. In case 2-benzoyl-cyclohexanone is used as ketone component in an inert solvent like anisole in the presence of Pd on charcoal at temperatures around 180°C, enamine-formation is followed by aromatization (step d). Enamine-esters rac-5 or (S)-5 can optionally be saponified to acids rac-6 or (S)-6 using standard conditions of alkaline hydrolysis (step e).<br><br><br><br>
Homochiral alpha alkoxy phenyl-propionic acid compounds of formula 8 can be prepared according to the method depicted in scheme 4 or by analogous methods known in the art.<br>
The well known chiral auxiliary 2 [(S)-4-benzyl-oxazolidin-2-one] is condensed with an alkoxy-acetyl chloride 1 in the presence of a strong base like n-butyl lithium in an inert solvent like tetrahydrofiiran at temperatures around -78°C to produce building block 3 (step a). The latter is then treated according to literature precedence [Tetrahedron Asymmetry (1999), 10,1353-1367] with dibutylboron-triflate and a tertiary amine like triethylamine in dichloromethane to generate the corresponding boron enolate, which is subsequently reacted at low temperatures with benzaldehydes 4 (compounds 5 in scheme 1) resulting in compounds 5 (step b). In compounds 5, one of all four possible stereoisomers is strongly predominating (stereochemistry as indicated without rigorous proof). The benzylic hydroxy group is then reductively removed as described for the conversion of compounds 8 to compounds 9 in scheme 1 to yield the penultimate intermediate 6 (step c). Esters 7 or acid compounds 8 can finally be obtained without racemization by careful alcoholysis with a sodium alcoholate in the corresponding alcohol as solvent or in solvents like tetrahydrofiiran or dioxane at temperatures around 0°C (step d) or by careful hydrolysis with diluted NaOH in tetrahydrofuran/water at 0°C (step e). The optical purity of compounds 7 and 8 can be determined by chiral HPLC or by 1H-NMR-spectroscopy in the presence of a chiral solvent like l-(9-anthryl)-2,2,2-trifluoro-ethanol and has been found high in all cases exemplified.<br>
Phenols 1 and/or aldehydes 6 (scheme 1), phenols 1 and/or protected phenols 2 and/or protected aldehydes 3 (scheme 2) and oxazoles 2 (scheme 1) are known or can be synthesized by methods known in the art. Examples for possible syntheses of these key intermediates are given in schemes 5-12.<br><br><br>
4-Hydroxy-benzofurans 5 [Synthetic Communications (1986), 16(13), 1635-1640; Helvetica Chimica Acta (1933), 16,121-129] and 4-hydroxy-benzothiophenes 8 [Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho (2001), 2001048876A2] are known. Thus, cyclohexane-l&gt;3-diones 1 carrying variable substituents R6 at the 5-position can be reacted with bromo-pyruvic acid in methanol in the presence of a base like potassium hydroxide at temperatures between 0°C and the reflux temperature of methanol followed by treatment with hydrochloric acid at around 100°C to give furan-carboxylic acids 3 (step a). Treatment of these fiiran-carboxyiic acids 3 in an inert solvent like decahydro-naphthalene in the presence of a hydrogen acceptor like dodecene and palladium on carbon, preferably at reflux, provides carboxy-benzofurans 4 (step b), which are decarboxylated to benzofurans 5, e. g. by using copper powder in quinoline at temperatures between 200°C and 240°C (step c). Treatment of 2-thiophenecarbaldehyde 6 with suitable vinyl-lithium- or vinyl-magnesium-derivatives in solvents like tetrahydrofuran or 1,2-dimethoxy-ethane, preferably in a temperature range between -78°C and room temperature, followed by in situ treatment with acetic anhydride yields thiophenes 7 with variable substitution R6 (step d). Treatment of thiophenes 7 with carbon monoxide, preferably at a pressure of 20 to 60 bar, a palladium catalyst like palladium acetate, a phosphine like triphenylphosphine, in solvent mixtures which may typically contain acetic anhydride, triethylamine, toluene or tetrahydrofuran, preferably in a temperature range between 100°C to 160°C» affords after saponification of the acetate function, benzothiophenes 8 (step e).<br><br><br>
2-Hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzaldehyde 1, optionally substituted with bromine in position 5, can be transformed into benzo[b]thiophen-7-ol 6 or 5-bromo-benzo[b]thiophen~7-ol 6. This sequence can be carried out in analogy to the method described in J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. 1 1983(12), 2973-7. For the transformation of 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzaldehyde into benzo[b]thiophen-7-ol: treatment with N,N-dimethylthiocarbamoyl chloride in a solvent like tetrahydrofiiran in the presence of an aqueous base like potassium hydroxide in water or in the presence of an organic base like diisopropyl-ethyl-amine, preferably at temperatures between 0°C and room temperature, generates thionocarbamates 2 (step a); thermal rearrangement of 2 without solvent or preferably in an inert solvent like diphenyl ether at temperatures between 200°C and 280°C leads to S-arylthiocarbamates 3 (step b); saponification in a solvent like an alcohol with a base like sodium or potassium hydroxide, preferably between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents, leads then to thiophenols 4 (step c); reaction of thiophenols 4 with sodium chloroacetate in water or a water alcohol mixture in the presence of a base like sodium or potassium hydroxide in a temperature range between room temperature<br><br>
and the reflux temperature of the solvents produces then benzothiophene-carboxync acias 5 (step d); decarboxylation, e. g. in quinoline in the presence of copper bronze at temperatures between 200°C and 240°C, followed by cleavage of the methyl ether function, e. g. by treatment with aqueous hydrobromic acid in acetic acid at reflux, then finally yields benzo[b]thiophen-7-ols 6 (step e). 7-Hydroxy-benzofuran is known and commercially available [J. Med. Chem. (1987), 30(1), 62-7]. In a sequence similar to that described above, the 5-bromo-analogue can be prepared from 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzaldehyde 1 by reaction with ethyl chloro-actetate in a solvent like N,N-dimethylformamide in the presence of a base like potassium carbonate at temperatures between 60°C and 120°C yielding benzofiiran carboxylic acid 7 (step f). Decarboxylation as described above and ensuing ether cleavage, preferably with pyridine hydrochloride at temperatures around 200°C, then leads to 5-bromo-7-hydroxy-benzofuran 8 (step g).<br><br>
1-Hydroxy-naphthalene 1 and 2,3-annelated phenols 2 with a ring size of 5,6 and 7 are commercially available or known [see J. Am. Chem. Soc (1988), 110(19), 6471-6480; U.S. (2000) 6121397; PCT InL Appl. (1999) WO99/10339]. 3-Bromo-l-hydroxy-naphthalene 4, an intermediate carrying a functionality, which allows synthetic modifications at a later<br><br>
stage, can be prepared from 3-nitro-l-methoxy-naphthalene 3 [Monatsh. Liftem. u**^J» 123(6-7), 637-645] by well established procedures, i. e. reduction of the nitro function, e. g. by hydrogenation in the presence of a palladium catalyst, followed by diazotisation, Sandmeyer reaction and cleavage of the methyl ether function giving 3-bromo-1-hydroxy-naphthalene 4 (steps a, b, c). 2,3-Annelated carboxylic acids 5 are known, their 3-bromo analogues 6 are known or can be prepared by established methods of bromination of aromatic nuclei [J. Org. Chem. (1978), 43(11), 2167-70; Ger. Offen. (1977), DE 2633905] (step d). Such 3-bromo-benzoic acids can then be converted into the corresponding phenols 7 by known methods such as e. g. exhaustive reduction with borane to the corresponding alcohol, oxidation, e. g. by using Swern conditions (oxalyl chloride / dimethylsulfoxide / triethylamine in dichloromethane, -78°C to room temperature) to the corresponding aldehyde, followed by Baeyer-Villiger oxidation with peracetic acid (40%) in acetic acid (steps e, f, g).<br>
Scheme 8<br><br>
Bromo-methoxy compound 1 characterized by an anneiated hexahydropyran ring is known [Can. J. Chem- (1982), 60(16), 2093-8]. Cleavage of the methoxy ether function with pyridine hydrochloride at temperatures around 200°C leads to 3-bromo-phenol 2 (step a). The isomeric building block can be obtained as follows: Carboxylic acid 3 [U.S. (1999), US 5856529 A] can be brominated to give the 3-bromo derivative 4 (step b) which<br><br>
can be transformed into phenol 5 by a sequence analogous to that described for the transformation of compounds 6 into compounds 7 in scheme 7 (steps c, d, e).<br>
Scheme 9<br><br>
3-Bromo-phenols 1, optionally carrying a protective function, can be converted in analogous phenols 2 carrying variable substiutents R6 by first transforming the bromo-compound into the corresponding aryl-lithium derivative (e. g. by using an alkyl lithium reagent in a solvent like tetrahydrofiiran, preferably at a temperature around -78°C) and then quenching the latter with a variety of electrophiles using methods well known in the art (step a). For the synthesis of phenols (R6=OH), the aryl lithium compounds are reacted with trimethyl-borate at temperatures between -78°C and the reflux temperature of tetrahydrofiiran, followed by oxidation with e. g. N-methyl morpholine N-oxide, preferably at the reflux temperature of tetrahydrofiiran [compare Synlett 1995(09), 931-932], These phenols 2 with R6 equal OH can then be transformed into the corresponding ether compounds by well known methods.<br><br><br>
Phenols 1, optionally carrying a protective function, can be further functionalized into phenols 2 carrying additional substutents R2 by known methods of electrophilic aromatic subsitution. In many cases, mixture of ortho / para - substitution-, and ortho / para -disubstitution-products will be formed in ratios depending on the precise reaction conditions. In such cases, the reaction conditions can be optimized in order to achieve the highest possible yield of mono-ortho product; optionally, product mixtures can also be separated into pure isomers by known methods such as silica gel chromatography (step a). 4-Formyl compounds 3 can be obtained from phenols 1, optionally carrying a protective function, by known formylation reactions such as the Vilsmeier formylation or by formylation with dichloromethyl methyl ether in the presence of titanium tetrachloride, preferably in dichloromethane at temperatures between -78°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent (step b). 4-Forrnyl compounds 3 can then again be used as starting materials for known methods of electrophilic aromatic subsitution leading to compounds 4 carrying an additional R2 substituent (step c).<br><br><br>
Aldehydes 1 are commercially available or known. They are condensed with diketo-monoximes 2 according to literature precedence (Diels, O.; Riley, K.; Chem Ber (1915), 48, 897) in the presence of a strong acid, typically HC1» in a polar solvent like AcOH to yield the oxazole-N-oxides 3 (step a). Subsequent treatment with POCU in dichloromethane under reflux provides the corresponding primary chlorides 4 (Goto, Y.; Yamazaki, M.; Hamana, M.; Chem Pharm Bull (1971), 19,2050, step b). These intermediates are either used as such, transformed according to well established methods into the corresponding alcohols or activated alcohols like mesylates or tosylates or into the bromides or iodides, or finally further elaborated via Sw2-reaction with NaCN to give, via nitrils 5 (step c), exhaustive hydrolysis (step d) and reduction (step e), e. g. with borane in tetrahydrofuran, the building blocks 7.<br>
4-Chloromethyi-2-aryl or 2-heteroaryl-oxazoles 4 with R7 equal hydrogen are preferably prepared from the corresponding aryl or heteroaryl carboxamides and 13-dichloroacetone as described e. g. in Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett (2000), 10(17), 2041-2044.<br><br><br>
N-Acyl-glycine esters 1 are either commercially available, known, or can be prepared by standard operations of N-acylation. Mono-allylated esters 2 can easily be obtained by double deprotonation of 1 with a strong, non-nucleophilic base like LiHMDS in an aprotic solvent like THF, typically at -78°C, followed by treatment with allyl bromide to produce selectively the C-alkylated products 2 (step a). Standard hydrolysis generates intermediate acids 3 (step b), which are then transformed, following well established literature precedence (J. Med. Chem. (1996), 39,3897), into compounds 4 (step c). Ring-closure to the oxazole using trifluoro-acetic acid and trifluoro-acetic anhydride as reagents generates key intermediates 5 (step d), which, finally, are elaborated via hydroboration to the target alcohols 6, e. g. with 9-BBN in THF and ensuing oxidative work-up with H2O2 and NaOH (step e).<br><br>
The following tests were carried out in order to determine the activity of the compounds of formula I.<br>
Background information on the performed assays can be found in: Nichols JS et al. "Development of a scintillation proximity assay for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligand binding domain", (1998) Anal. Biochem. 257:112-119.<br>
Full-length cDNA clones for human PPARa and mouse PPARy were obtained by RT-PCR from human adipose and mouse liver cRNA, respectively, cloned into plasmid vectors and verified by DNA sequencing. Bacterial and mammalian expression vectors were constructed to produce glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and Gal4 DNA binding domain proteins fused to the ligand binding domains (LBD) of PPARy (aa 174 to 476) and PPARa (aa 167 to 469). To accomplish this, the portions of the cloned sequences encoding the LBDs were amplified from the full-length clones by PCR and then subcloned into the plasmid vectors pGEX4T-2(Pharmacia) and pFA-CMV(Stratagene). Final clones were verified by DNA sequence analysis.<br>
Induction, expression, and purification of GST-LBD fusion proteins were performed in £ coli strain BL21(pLysS) cells by standard methods (Ref: Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley Press, edited by Ausubel et al.).<br>
Radioligand Binding Assay<br>
PPARa receptor binding was assayed in TKE10 (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8,50 mM KC1, 2mM EDTA, O.lmg/ml fatty acid free BSA and 10 mM DTT). For each 96 well 2.4 ug equivalent of GST-PPARa-LBD fusion protein and radioligand, e.g. 40000 dpm 2(S)-(2-benzoyl-phenylamino)-3-{4- [ l,l-ditritio-2-(5*methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethoxy] -phenyl}-propionic acid, were incubated in 100 ul volume at RT for 2 hrs. Bound ligand was removed from unbound ligand by solid phase separation using MultiScreen plates (Millipore) filled with 80 ul of SG25 according to the manufacturer's recommendations.<br>
PPARy receptor binding was assayed in TKE50 (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8,50 mM KC1,2mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/rnl fatty acid-free BSA and 10 mM DTT). For each 96 well reaction an 140 ng equivalent of GST-PPARy-LBD fusion protein was bound to 10 ug SPA beads (PharmaciaAmersham) in a final volume of 50 ul by shaking. The resulting slurry was incubated for Ih at RT and centrifuged for 2 min at 1300g. The supernatant containing unbound protein was removed and the semidry pellet containig the recptor-coated beads was resolved in 50 ul of TKE. For radioligand binding e.g. 10000 dpm 2(S)-(2-benzoyI-phen)damino)-3-{4-[l,l-ditritio-2-(5-methyl-2-phen)d-oxa2ol-4-yl)-ethoxy]-phenyl}-propionic acid in 50 ul were added, the reaction incubated at RT for Ih and scintillation proximity counting performed. All binding assays were performed in 96 well plates and the<br><br>
amount of bound ligand measured on a Packard TopCount using OptiPlates (Packard). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10"4 M unlabelled compound. Dose response curves were done in triplicates within a range of concentration from 10"10 M to lOμM.<br>
Luciferase Transcriptional Reporter Gene Assays<br>
Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21 ATCC CCL10) were grown in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS at 37°C in a 95%02:5%C02 atmosphere. Cells were seeded in 6 well plates at a density of 105 Cells/well and then batch-transfected with either the pFA-PPARy-LBD or pFA-PPARa-LBD expression plasmids plus the pFR-luc reporter plasmid (Stratagene) and an expression plasmid encoding the secretable form of alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) as a normalization control. Transfection was accomplished with the Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the suggested protocol. Six hours following transfection, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and seeded in 96 well plates at a density of 104 cells/well. After 24 hours to allow attachment of cells, the medium was removed and replaced with 100 ul of phenol red-free medium containing the test substances or control ligands (final. 0.1% DMSO). Following incubation of the cells for 24 hours with substances, 50 ul of the supernatant was recovered and analyzed for SEAP activity (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The remainder of the supernatant was discarded, 50 ul PBS was added per well followed by one volume of Luciferase Constant-Light Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to lyse the cells and initiate the luciferase reaction. Luminescence for both SEAP and luciferase was measured in a Packard TopCount. Luciferase activity was normalized to the SEAP control and transcriptional activation in the presence of a test substance was expressed as fold-activation over cells incubated in the absence of the substance. EC50 values were calculated using the XLfit program (ID Business Solutions Ltd. UK).<br>
The compounds of the present invention exhibit IC50 values of 0.1 nM to 50 |iM, preferably 1 nM to 10 yM, paricularly 1 - 3500 nM, more preferred 1 - 500 nM, for PPARa and PPARy. The compounds further exhibit EC50 values of 0.1 nM to 50 jiM, preferably 1 nM to 10 μM, more preferably 1 - 3500 nM, particularly 1 - 500 nM, for PPAR a and PPARy.<br><br><br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts and esters can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for enteral, parenteral or topical administration. They can be administered, for example, perorally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or infusion solutions, or topically, e.g. in the form of ointments, creams or oils.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner which will be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutical^ acceptable, into a galenical administration form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also organic carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers are, however, required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for<br><br>
example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, liquid waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistency-improving agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula I can vary within wide limits depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 1 mg to about 1000 mg, especially about 1 mg to about 100 mg, comes into consideration. Depending on the dosage it is convenient to administer the daily dosage in several dosage units.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 0.5-500 mg, preferably 0.5-100 mg, of a compound of formula I.<br>

To 480 mg of NaH (50% in mineral oil, -20 mmol) in 10 ml of abs. THF was added at 0° 721 mg of 3-buten-l-ol (10 mmol) and the mixture stirred for 5 min. (H2-evolution). 1.39 g of bromo-acetic acid (10 mmol), dissolved in 10 ml of THF, was then added and the mixture kept for additional 5 min. at 0°and for 2 h at ambient temperature. Pouring onto crashed ice / HC1 dil., twofold extraction with AcOEt, washing with brine, drying over natrium sulfate and evaporation of the solvents afforded 1.65 g of the title compound, contaminated with mineral oil, but sufficiently pure for the next step.<br>

evolution set in and the reaction mixture was kept for 3 h. Careful evaporation of the excess of reagent and drying yielded 1.35 g of acid chloride which was used for the next step without further purification.<br>
1.77 g of (S)-4-Benzyl-2-oxazolidinone (10 mmol) was dissolved in 30 ml of abs. THF and cooled down to -78°. 6.67 ml of 1.5M nBuLi (hexane) was added via syringe (strongly exothermic) to deprotonate the NH. 10 min. later, the crude, above prepared acid chloride, dissolved in 10 ml of THF, was added and stirring continued for 30 min. at -78° and for 30 min. at 0°. Pouring onto crashed ice/NH4Cl, twofold extraction with AcOEt, washing with water, drying over sodium sulfate, and evaporation of the solvents, followed by flash chromatography (Si02&gt; hexane/AcOEt=7/3) afforded 0.691 g of the title compound as colorless, viscous oil.<br>
