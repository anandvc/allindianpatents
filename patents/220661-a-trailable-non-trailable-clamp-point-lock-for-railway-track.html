				<td>This  invention  relates   to  Trailable/non-<br>
trailable clamp point lock. Specifically this invention relates to a trailable clamp point lock B.G. 52/60 kg.<br>
for thick wet switches, IRS switches and thick web switches from cranes rails having 95mm to 160mm opening<br>
at toe and is adapted to be operated by an electric point machine having throw of 143mm to 260mm and alno<br>
for non-trailable clamp point lock having 95mm to 115mm opening at. toe and adapted to be operated by an electric<br>
point  machine  having  throw  of  220mm  to  260mm  for<br>
turnouts on Indian Railways.<br>
At   the  stations  trains  pass  along   the<br>
straight line of the turnout and stopping ones takes the branch line/loop line of it before coming to a halt.<br>
The speed of the passing train is not restricted but that of the stopping train is restricted to 19 km/hr.<br>
The facing points are provided when the trains are to be diverted from main line to branch line/1oop line.<br>
'CORRECT SETTING' and 'CORRECT LOCKING' of all facing points on a route is a mandatory requirement. The<br>
points can be operated mechanically or electrically.<br>
For   CORRECT SETTING  end  CORRECT  LOCKING of   facing  points  it. is required  to  provide   point machines with direct, locking of  switches with the  help of clamp point lock.<br>
The clamp point lock is known  in the art  i» trailable type and  comprises stock rail brackets  fixed with  right hand and left  hand stock rails provided  at the  turnout with special head bolts.   Similarly  right hand  and  left hand tongue rail brackets are  fixed  to their  tongue rails with special head bolts.  The  right hand  and left, hand locking cranks are  pivoted  to  the respective tongue rail brackets by means of pin which in turn allow the locking crank to move horizontally.   One end  of the drive rod is connected to the electric point machine  and  the other end to the lug  of  locking  bar assembly  for  providing pulling and pushing  action of tongue  rail  to  lock the locking face  of  stock  rail bracket with locking face of locking crank so as to lock t.he turnout to its right hand side or left, hand side.<br>
There  are disadvantages associated with  the locking  device  known  in the art.   One  of  the main disadvantage  is  that.  this  clamp  point  lock  is not. directly  locking  with the stock rail  itself  but  the locking  is effective indirectly through the stock  rail bracket and is below the foot of rail.<br>
Another disadvantage with this clamp point lock is that it is of trailable type and can be used<br>
with non~trilable point machine. On Indian Railway the point machines used are of non-trail able type for<br>
working of points.<br>
Another  di sad van t.acje is that the  holes  are drilled in the stock rail for fixing stock rail bracket. Drilling  of holes in stock rail in the visinity of  the toe weaken the stock rail.<br>
Yet another disadvantage  is that the  tongue rail brackets and stock rail brackets are different  for different rail sections for 52 kg/(Tws)  and 60 kg (Tws) turnouts.<br>
Still another disadvantage? is that  eccentric bushes once provided at the time of installation  cannot be used for further adjustments of tongue rail with  its stockrail.<br>

Another object of this invention is to propose a clamp point lock to fix the stockrail bracket.<br>
to the foot of stockrail with the help of hook bolts to avoid drilling of holes in the stock rail of running<br>
track.<br>
Yet another object of this invention i* to propose clamp point lock to use the same common parts<br>
such as stock rail brackets. Tongue rail brackets hook bolts etc. for different rail sections of 52 kg/60<br>
kg (Tws) turnouts.<br>
Still another object of this invention is  to propose  a clamp point lock having accentric bush to  be used  for  minor  adjustments  of  variations  in  track parameters.<br>
Further  an  object of thin invention  is  to<br>
propose a clamp point lock to lock the tongue rail directly with its stock rail. A locking crank which in<br>
turn lock the foot of the stock rail, and is possible only when the locking crank is moved in the vertical<br>
direction to lock and unlock the tongue rail with its stock rail and thus avoiding different design and shape<br>
and  size of stock  rail  bracket, tongue rail  bracket,<br>
locking crank, fixing bolts etc:.<br>
Another  object  of  this  invention  is   to propose  a  clamp point lock adapted  to  work  turnouts having  95mm to 160mm opening at toes for trailable  type and 95mm to 115mm opening at. toe for non - trai1able type.<br>
Yet. another object of this invention is to propose a clamp point lock with an electric point<br>
machine having 143 mm to 260 mm stroke for trailable type and 220mm to 260mm throw for non —trailable type of<br>
clamp point lock.<br>
