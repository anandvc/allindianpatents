				<td>NOVEL DIHYDRATE FORM OF AMIFOSTINE AND A PROCESS FOR ITS<br>
PREPARATION<br>
Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a novel dihydrate form of Amifostine of formula (I) and process for its preparation. Amifostine is S-2-(3-aniinopropylamino)ethyl dihydrogen phosphorothioate of formula-I(a) useful in cancer chemotherapy and exists normally as the trihydrate. <br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Amifostine is originally developed as a radiation protector and the only drug that has been<br>
approved by the FDA for Xerostomia (dry mouth) in patients receiving radiation therapy for cancers of the head and neck. Xerostomia is a chronic dry-mouth condition, which is caused by damage to the salivary glands during radiation therapy.<br>
In addition to its utility as radioprotectant, it has been reported that Amifostine is used experimentally to protect HIV infected patients from the harmful side effects of 3'-azido-3'deoxythymidine (AZT) therapy. Amifostine and its derivatives exert their protective effects without significantly affecting the beneficial properties of the administered therapeutic agents. This is in part due to the selective uptake of the protective thiol into normal tissue.<br><br>
Amifostine is commercially available as an injection dosage form containing a lyophilized<br>
powder of Amifostine trihydrate for intravenously.<br>
Amifostine     having     chemical     name,     S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethyl     dihydrogen<br>
phosphorothioate is also known as WR-2721 and similar aminoalkylamino dihydrogen<br>
phosphorothioates are first reported in US patent 3892824 (1968) and later it was published<br>
in   J. Med chem., 12, 236-243 (1969).<br>
In the above said article and patent (US 3892824), the manufacturing process for Amifostine<br>
monohydrate is described as shown in scheme-1.<br><br>
Scheme-1<br>
In this process, 2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethanol(II) and aqueous hydrobromic acid were reacted and the resulting crystalline 2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethyl bromide dihydrobromide(III) was then reacted with anhydrous trisodium phosphorothioate (IV) in dimethyl formamide and water medium to get S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethyl dihydrogen phosphorothioate monohydrate (V). The product was isolated by the addition of methanol. Its melting point was 160-161° C.<br><br>
In this patent (US 3892824), neither physical characterization parameters like differential scanning calorimetry(DSC), X-ray diffraction(XRD) data, IR spectral data nor analytical purity of the substance have been furnished for monohydrate form.<br>
In the patent DD 289448 (1983), the product was synthesized by following the same methodology but by using trisodium phosphorothioate dodecahydrate (VI) instead of anhydrous reagent (IV) in dimethyl formamide and water medium to get Amifostine trihydrate(I(a)) as crystals (Scheme-2).<br><br>
In this patent (DD 289448), the purity of Amifostine trihydrate was reported as 100% based on Thin layer chromatography. Along with this result no analytical details like DSC, X-ray diffraction studies or FTIR were reported to further confirm the structure. In the patent DD 289449 (1983), the product was synthesized by following the same methodology but by using trisodium phosphorothioate dodecahydrate (VI) instead of anhydrous reagent (IV) in aqueous alcoholic medium to get Amifostine trihydrate(I(a)) as crystals      (Scheme-3).<br><br><br>
In this patent (DD 289449) also, the purity of Amifostine trihydrate was reported as 100% based on Thin layer chromatography. Along with this result no analytical details like DSC, X-ray diffraction studies or FTIR were reported to further confirm the structure. However in the patent WO 9403179 (1994), the details of stability data. Differential scanning calorimetry(DSC) data, FTIR spectral data and X-ray diffraction (XRD) data and molecular and crystal structure of Amifostine trihydrate drug substance have been disclosed. According to this patent, the moisture content of Amifostine trihydrate is reported as 12.1% w/w. But according to theoretical calculation, the moisture content must be 20.1% w/w. Also other analytical reports like DSC, FTIR and X-ray diffraction studies revealed that the reported crystalline Amifostine is a trihydrate form.<br>
In  the   subsequent  patent  WO   0218396  (2002)   a  comparative  data  for  Amifostine monohydrate and trihydrate with respect to FTIR, DSC and XRD have been furnished. Recently, we developed a novel and industrially feasible process for Amifostine trihydrate as shown in the scheme-4.<br><br><br>
Accordingly, 2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethyl bromide dihydrobromide(III) and commercially<br>
available thiophosphoryl chloride(VIII) were reacted in presence of aqueous alkali to afford<br>
Amifostine trihydrate. The product was then crystallized in aqueous alcohol to get pure<br>
Amifostine trihydrate.<br>
During our studies on Amifostine trihydrate, the following difficulties were observed<br>
i)        It is very difficult to control the moisture content of Amifostine trihydrate during<br>
drying to meet the pharmacopoeial limit of 19.2-21.2%. ii) Amifostine trihydrate is known to be unstable at temperatures above 40° C. This puts severe constraints on the operating temperatures of drying for this drug substance. By employing lower temperatures (less than 30° C) for drying, it is very difficult to eliminate the residual organic solvent methanol and at the same time keeping the water content within permissible limits for this drug substance, iii)       Prolonged drying hours(6-8 hrs) causes hydrolysis of phosphorothioate ester function<br>
of Amifostine. In the present manufacturing conditions of Amifostine trihydrate, a great difficulty is encountered to control the moisture content (19.2-21.2%) and keeping the residual solvents in the specified limits during the drying process.<br>
Hence there is a need to develop an alternate hydrate form of Amifostine to overcome the above difficulties. In order to maintain a balance between optimum moisture content and acceptable residual solvent content, a new dihydrate form of Amifostine is now invented and found suitable to overcome the above mentioned difficulties.<br><br>
Accordingly, we disclose a novel and industrially viable process for the synthesis of Amifostine dihydrate, which was not disclosed earlier. It has been found that the new dihydrate form of Amifostine is devoid of the difficulties mentioned above. To meet the requirement for high purity Amifostine, we wish to disclose a simple and commercially viable process comprising the reaction of 2-(3-aminopropylamino) ethylbromide dihydrobromide (III) and thiophosphoryl chloride (VII) in aqueous alkaline medium (Scheme-5; Route A). Also we wish to disclose another route of synthesis of the same target molecule by condensing trisodium phosphorothioate dodecahydrate (VI) with 2-(3-aminopropylamino) ethyl bromide dihydrobromide (III) in presence of water (Scheme-5; Route B).<br><br><br>
Objectives of the present invention:<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a new stable dihydrate form of A^mifostine, which obviates the following difficulties associated with handling the known \mifostine trihydrate.<br>
(i)       It is very difficult to control the moisture content of Amifostine trihydrate during<br>
drying operation to meet the pharmacopoeial limit of 19.2-21.2% (ii)       Amifostine trihydrate is known to be unstable at temperatures above 40° C. This<br>
puts severe constraints on the operating temperatures for drying of this drug<br>
substance, (iii)     By employing lower temperatures (less than 30° C) for drying, it is very difficult<br>
to eliminate the residual organic solvent methanol and also water, (iv)      Prolonged drying (6-8 hrs) causes hydrolysis of phosphorothioate ester function<br>
of Amifostine. Accordingly, another objective of the present invention is to provide a novel crystallization and isolation technique which affords a stable crystalline Amifostine dihydrate containing 12.5-14.5% moisture content.<br>
