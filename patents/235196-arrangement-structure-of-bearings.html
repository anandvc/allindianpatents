				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an arrangement of bearings for a plurality of torque transmission elements. [Background Art]<br>
Hitherto, there is proposed, for example, in Patent Document 1, an arrangement structure for bearings in which a plurality of power transmission shafts linked to each other are arranged in substantially parallel to each other for rotatably supporting the respective power transmission shafts via the bearings respectively.<br>
This technology has a structure in which the respective bearings are mounted to wall portions which, support the bearings from both sides, so that the respective bearings are partly overlapped when viewed in axial view. [Patent Document 1] Patent Publication No. 3039168 (Fig. 5) [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
However, in the arrangement structure of bearings as described above, although the center distance between the power transmission shafts can be reduced, since the bearings which<br><br>
3-Xare<br>
overlapped with each other in axial view are mounted to<br>
the wall portion from the opposite directions, assembly of a<br>
unit including these bearings may take a lot of trouble. When<br>
considering maintenance of bearings or the like by<br>
disassembling the unit, since the structure of the wall<br>
portions is complicated, maintenance may take a lot of trouble.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an<br>
arrangement structure of bearings for improving<br>
assembleability and maintenanceability of the respective<br>
bearings which overlap in the axial direction.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
[0004]<br>
As a solving means of the above described subject, the<br>
invention as set forth in Claim 1 is an arrangement structure<br>
of bearings including a plurality of power transmission shafts<br>
(for example, a driven shaft 60, an intermediate shaft 73 in<br>
an embodiment) linked in substantially parallel to each other,<br>
the power transmission shafts being rotatably supported via<br>
bearings (for example, radial ball bearings 87, 88 in the<br>
embodiment) respectively and arranged so that the bearings are<br>
overlapped partly with each other in axial view, characterized<br>
in that a wall portion for supporting the respective bearings<br>
(for example, an inner wall portion 59C in the embodiment) is<br>
provided, and the respective bearings are mounted to the wall<br>
portion substantially in the same direction.<br>
[0005]<br>
In this structure, when assembling the unit including<br>
the respective bearings, the respective bearings may be mounted<br>
to the wall portion substantially in the same direction.<br>
Likewise, maintenance of the respective bearings can be<br>
performed substantially in the same direction.<br>
[0006]<br>
The invention as set forth in Claim 2 is characterized<br>
in that the wall portion is formed with a recess (for example,<br>
a storage section 95 in the embodiment) so that a first bearing<br>
(for example, the radial ball bearing 88 in the embodiment)<br>
of the bearings is disposed on the far side of a second bearing<br>
(for example, the radial ball bearing 87 in the embodiment)<br>
of the bearings in terms of the mounting direction of the<br>
respective bearings, the bearings being overlapped to each<br>
other in axial view.<br>
[0007]<br>
In this arrangement, when mounting the respective<br>
bearings to the wall portion, the first bearing is mounted to<br>
the wall portion in a state of being disposed within the recess<br>
to place on the far side in terms of mounting direction, and<br>
then the second bearing is mounted to the wall portion.<br>
[0008]<br>
The invention as set forth in Claim 3 is characterized<br>
in that a bearing holder (for example, a bearing holder 100<br>
in the embodiment) for surrounding and retaining the second<br>
bearing, and the second bearing is mounted to the wall portion<br>
via the bearing holder.<br>
[0009]<br>
In this arrangement, the second bearing can be supported<br>
via the bearing holder over the entire perimeter.<br>
[0010]<br>
The invention as set forth in Claim 4 is characterized<br>
in that the first bearing is disposed between the second bearing<br>
and the wall portion in the axial direction.<br>
[0011]<br>
In this arrangement, the first bearing can be interposed<br>
between the second bearing and the wall portion.<br>
[0012]<br>
The invention as set forth in Claim 5 is characterized<br>
in that a space is formed the second bearing and the first<br>
bearing in the axial direction.<br>
[0013]<br>
In this arrangement, the part tolerance of the respective<br>
bearings in the axial direction and the mounting tolerance with<br>
respect to the wall portion can be absorbed.<br>
[Advantage of the Invention]<br>
[0014]<br>
According to the invention as set forth in Claim 1,<br>
assembleability and maintenanceability of the respective<br>
bearings can be improved.<br>
According to the invention as set forth in Claim 2, mounting of the respective bearings are facilitated, and assembleability thereof can further be improved.<br>
According to the invention as set forth in Claim 3, the mounting force of the second bearing with respect to the wall portion can be improved.<br>
According to the invention as set forth in Claim 4, the mounting force of the first bearing with respect to the wall portion can be improved.<br>
According to the invention as set forth in Claim 5, mounting accuracy of the respective bearings can be improved. [Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
Referring now to the drawings, embodiments of the present invention will  be described.<br><br>

Terms representing the directions such as front, rear, left and right correspond to the directions with respect to a vehicle. [First Embodiment]<br>
In Fig. 1, reference numeral lA designates a unit swing system motorcycle configured as a hybrid vehicle. The motorcycle 1A includes a front fork 1 which rotatably supports a front wheel WF at the front of the vehicle body. The front wheel WF and the front fork 1 are rotatably supported by a head<br><br>
pipe 2, so as to be capable of steering by the operation of<br>
a handle 3. A down pipe 4 is mounted to the head pipe 2 so<br>
as to extend rearward and downward, and an intermediate frame<br>
5 is extending substantially horizontally from the lower end<br>
of the down pipe 4.<br>
[0017]<br>
A rear frame 6 is formed rearward and upward from the<br>
rear end of the intermediate frame 5. The front end of a power<br>
unit 11 including an engine 20 as a prime mover of the motorcycle<br>
1A, described later, is rotatably attached to a vehicle body<br>
frame 10 configured as described above. The power unit 11 is,<br>
so-called, a unit swing system which swings in the vertical<br>
direction about the front end thereof, which is rotatably<br>
mounted to the vehicle body frame 10. A rear wheel WR, which<br>
is a drive wheel, is rotatably mounted to the rear end of the<br>
power unit 11. Mounted between the power unit 11 and the rear<br>
frame 6 is a rear cushion, not shown.<br>
[0018]<br>
The periphery of the vehicle body frame 10 is covered<br>
by a vehicle body cover 13, and a seat 14 on which a rider seats<br>
is disposed at the rear on the upper surface of the vehicle<br>
body cover 13. A step floor 15 on which the feet of the rider<br>
are placed is formed forwardly of the seat 14. A storage box<br>
12 is provided below the seat 14, which is opened and closed<br>
by the seat 14 and is functioned as a utility space for storing,<br>
for example, a helmet, baggage, or the like.<br>
[0019]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the power unit 11 includes an engine<br>
20, which is an internal combustion engine for generating an<br>
output by burning combustible air-fuel mixture, an ACG starter<br>
motor 2la which functions as a starter and a power generator,<br>
a stepless speed changer 23 connected to a crankshaft 22 of<br>
the engine 20 for transmitting a rotational power of the engine<br>
20 to the rear wheel WR, a start-up clutch 40 for connecting<br>
and disconnecting power transmission between the crankshaft<br>
22 and the input side of the stepless speed changer 23, a drive<br>
motor 21b which functions as a dynamotor or a power generator,<br>
a one-way clutch 44 which can transmit the rotational power<br>
only from the engine 20 and the drive motor 21b to the side<br>
of the rear wheel WR according to the input number of revolution,<br>
and a speed reduction mechanism 69 for reducing the speed of<br>
the rotational power from the stepless speed changer 23 and<br>
transmitting it to the rear wheel WR.<br>
[0020]<br>
The rotational power from the engine 20 is transmitted<br>
from the crankshaft 22 to the rear wheel WR via the startup<br>
clutch 40, the stepless speed changer 23, the one-way clutch<br>
44, a driven shaft (power transmission shaft) 60 disposed on<br>
the output side of the stepless speed changer 23, and the speed<br>
reduction mechanism 69.<br>
On the other hand, the power from the drive motor 21b<br>
is transmitted to the rear wheel WR via the driven shaft 60,<br>
and the speed reduction mechanism 69. In other words, the<br>
driven shaft 60 which serves as a drive shaft of the rear wheel<br>
WR via the speed reduction mechanism 69 also corresponds to<br>
the output shaft of the drive motor 21b.<br>
[0021]<br>
A battery 74 is connected to the ACG starter motor 2la<br>
and the drive motor 2 Ib. The battery 74 supplies electric power<br>
to the motors 2la, 21b when the drive motor 21b functions as<br>
the dynamotor, and when the ACG starter motor 2la functions<br>
as the starter. When the ACG starter motor 2la and the drive<br>
motor 21b function as the power generators, regenerative<br>
electric power therefrom is charged. Control of the engine<br>
20, the ACG starter motor 2la, and the drive motor 21b is<br>
performed a control unit 7 which is control means including<br>
a CPU (Central Processing Unit), a ROM (Read Only Memory) and<br>
a RAM (Random Access Memory) and so on.<br>
[0022]<br>
The engine 20 is configured to intake and burn air-fuel<br>
mixture including air and fuel from an air-intake pipe 16, and<br>
a throttle valve 17 for controlling the amount of air is<br>
rotatably provided in the air-intake pipe 16. The throttle<br>
valve 17 is rotated by the operating amount of a throttle grip,<br>
not shown, which is operated by the rider. Provided between<br>
the throttle valve 17 and the engine 20 are an injector 18 for<br>
injecting fuel and a negative pressure sensor 19 for detecting<br>
negative pressure in the air-intake pipe 16 (air-intake pipe<br>
negative pressure).<br>
[0023]<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, a piston 25 is connected to the<br>
crankshaft 22 of the engine 20 via a connecting rod 24, and<br>
the piston 25 is fitted into a cylinder 27 provided in a cylinder<br>
block 26. Then, by burning air-fuel mixture in a combustion<br>
chamber 20a defined by a cylinder head 28, the cylinder 27 and<br>
the piston 25, the piston 25 reciprocates in the cylinder 27<br>
and the crankshaft 22 rotates to output the rotational power.<br>
Reference numeral 29 designates an ignition plug for igniting<br>
air-furl mixture.<br>
[0024]<br>
Opening and closing of a valve, not shown, for<br>
controlling intake or exhaust of air-fuel mixture to/from the<br>
combustion chamber 20a is performed by rotating a camshaft 30<br>
supported by the cylinder head 28. A driven sprocket 31 is<br>
provided on the right end of the camshaft 30, and an endless<br>
cam chain 33 is wound around the driven sprocket 31 and the<br>
drive sprocket 32 provided on the right end of the crankshaft<br>
22 . A water pump 34 is provided on the camshaft 30 on the right<br>
side of the driven sprocket 31, and the water pump 34 works<br>
as the camshaft 30 rotates.<br>
[0025]<br>
A stator case 49 is connected to the right side of a<br>
crankcase 48 which supports the crankshaft 22, and the ACG<br>
starter motor 21a is stored within the stator case 49. The<br>
ACG starter motor 2la is a motor of so-called an outer rotor<br>
system, and the stator is a coil 51 formed by winding a conductor<br>
wire wired on a teeth 50 fixed to the stator case 49. An outer<br>
rotor 52 has substantially cylindrical shape covering the outer<br>
periphery of the stator, and is provided with a magnet 53 on<br>
the inner peripheral surface thereof. The outer rotor 52 is<br>
coaxially fixed to the crankshaft 22. A fan 54a for cooling<br>
the ACG starter motor 2la is mounted to the left side of the<br>
outer rotor 52.<br>
[0026]<br>
A power transmission case 59 which extends toward the<br>
rear wheel WR is connected to the left side of the crankcase<br>
48. The power transmission case 59 can be divided into a case<br>
body 59A which constitutes an inside (right side) portion<br>
thereof in terms of the vehicle width direction and a cover<br>
59B to be mounted from the outside (left side) of the case body<br>
59A in terms of the vehicle width direction. In a space 59K<br>
defined therein, a fan 54b fixed to the left end of the<br>
crankshaft 22, the start-up clutch 40, the stepless speed<br>
changer 23 connected at the input side thereof to the crankshaft<br>
22 via the start-up clutch 40, and the drive motor 21b connected<br>
to the output side of the stepless speed changer 23 are stored.<br>
[0027]<br>
A cooling air intake port 59a is formed on the front left<br>
side of the power transmission case 59 in the vicinity of the<br>
fan 54b. When the fan 54b is rotated synchronously with the<br>
crankshaft 22, outside air is taken from the cooling air intake<br>
port 59a into the power transmission case 59, so that the drive<br>
motor 21b and the stepless speed changer 23 are cooled<br>
compulsorily.<br>
[0028]<br>
The stepless speed changer 23 is configured as, so-called,<br>
a belt converter including a drive side power transmission<br>
pulley 58, which is the input side to be mounted to the left<br>
end of the crankshaft 22 projected leftward from the crankcase<br>
48 in terms of the vehicle width direction via the start-up<br>
clutch 40, a driven side power transmission pulley 62, which<br>
is the output side to be mounted to a driven shaft 60 supported<br>
by the power transmission case 59 along the axis in parallel<br>
with the crankshaft 22 via the one-way clutch 44, and an endless<br>
V-belt (endless belt) 63 wound on these pulleys 58, 62 so as<br>
to interconnect there between. The driven shaft 60 is provided<br>
so as to penetrate through the drive motor 21b and the driven<br>
side power transmission pulley 62, and the driven shaft 60 is<br>
rotatably supported by a gear case 70, in which the power<br>
transmission case 59 and the speed reduction mechanism 69 are<br>
stored.<br>
[0029]<br>
Referring also to Fig. 4, the drive side power<br>
transmission pulley 58 is mounted to the crankshaft 22 via a<br>
sleeve 58d through which the crankshaft 22 is penetrated so<br>
as to be capable of rotating in the circumferential direction,<br>
and includes a drive side fixed pulley half 58a secured on the<br>
sleeve 58d, and a drive side movable pulley half 58c, which<br>
is disposed on the outside (right side) of the drive side fixed<br>
pulley half 58a in terms of the vehicle width direction, and<br>
is mounted so as to be capable of sliding axial with respect<br>
to the sleeve 58d but not to be capable of rotating in the<br>
circumferential direction. The drive side fixed pulley half<br>
58a and the drive side movable pulley half 58c are substantially<br>
bowl shape. The drive side fixed pulley half 58a is disposed<br>
so that the outer peripheral side thereof is positioned inside<br>
(left side) of the inner peripheral side in the vehicle width<br>
direction, and the drive side movable pulley half 58c is<br>
disposed so that the outer peripheral side thereof is<br>
positioned on the outside (left side) of the inner peripheral<br>
side in terms of the vehicle width direction.<br>
[0030]<br>
On the other hand, the driven side power transmission<br>
pulley 62 is mounted to the driven shaft 60 passing there through<br>
so as to be capable of rotating in the circumferential direction,<br>
and includes a driven side fixed pulley half 62a which is<br>
restrained in sliding movement with respect to the driven shaft<br>
60 in the axial direction thereof, and a driven side movable<br>
pulley half 62b mounted on a boss 62c through which the driven<br>
shaft 60 of the driven side fixed pulley half 62a is passed<br>
so as to be capable of sliding movement in the axial direction<br>
thereof. The driven side fixed pulley half 62a and the driven<br>
side movable pulley half 62b are also substantially bowl shape.<br>
The driven side fixed pulley half 62a is disposed so that the<br>
outer peripheral side thereof is positioned inside (left side)<br>
of the inner peripheral side in terms of the vehicle width<br>
direction, and the driven side movable pulley half 62b is<br>
disposed so that the outer peripheral side is positioned<br>
outside (left side) of the inner peripheral side in terms of<br>
the vehicle width direction.<br>
[0031]<br>
The endless V-belt 63 is wound around belt grooves of<br>
V-shape in cross section, which are formed between the drive<br>
side fixed pulley half 58a and the drive side movable pulley<br>
half 58c, and between the driven side fixed pulley half 62a<br>
and the driven side movable pulley half 62b, respectively.<br>
[0032]<br>
A weight roller 58b is disposed inside the bowl shape<br>
of the drive side movable pulley half, that is, on the right<br>
side. Centrifugal force generated by the rotation of the drive<br>
side power transmission pulley 58 is exerted to the weight<br>
roller 58b, and then moves the weight roller 58b to the outer<br>
peripheral side of the drive side power transmission pulley<br>
58, so that the drive side movable pulley half 58c slides toward<br>
the drive side fixed pulley half 58a.<br>
On the other hand, a spring 64 is provided on the left<br>
side of the driven side movable pulley half 62b/ and the driven<br>
side movable pulley half 62b is constantly urged toward the<br>
driven side fixed pulley half 62a by a resilient force of the<br>
spring 64.<br>
[0033]<br>
In this arrangement, when the number of revolution of<br>
the crankshaft 22 increases, the centrifugal force exerted on<br>
the weight roller 58b in creases on the drive side power<br>
transmission pulley 58, and hence the drive side movable pulley<br>
half 58c slides toward the drive side fixed pulley half 58a.<br>
The drive side movable pulley half 58c moves closer to the drive<br>
side fixed pulley half 58a by the amount of this sliding<br>
movement, and the width of the groove of the drive side power<br>
transmission pulley 58 is decreased. Consequently, the<br>
contact position between the drive side power transmission<br>
pulley 58 and the V-belt 63 is shifted radially outwardly of<br>
the drive side power transmission pulley 58, whereby the<br>
winding diameter of the V-belt 63 is increased. Accordingly,<br>
the width of the groove on the driven side power transmission<br>
pulley 62 formed by the driven side fixed pulley half 62a and<br>
the driven side movable pulley half 62b is increased. In other<br>
words, the winding diameter (diameter of transmission pitch)<br>
of the V-belt 63 is continuously changed according to the number<br>
of revolution of the crankshaft 22, and the gear-change ratio<br>
is changed automatically and steplessly.<br>
[0034]<br>
The start-up clutch 40 includes a cup-shaped outer case<br>
40a secured to the sleeve 58d, an outer plate 40b secured to<br>
the left end of the crankshaft 22, a shoe 40d attached to the<br>
outer edge of the outer plate 4Ob via a weight 40c so as to<br>
face radially outwardly, and a spring 40e for urging the shoe<br>
40d radially inwardly.<br>
The start-up clutch 40 is disposed outside (left side<br>
in this embodiment) of the stepless speed changer 23 in terms<br>
of vehicle width direction, between the drive side fixed pulley<br>
half 58a and the fan 54b, and in the vicinity of the cooling<br>
air intake port 59a formed on the power transmission case 59.<br>
[0035]<br>
In this arrangement/ when the number of revolution of<br>
the engine 20, that is, the number of revolution of the<br>
crankshaft 22 is egual to or smaller than a predetermined value<br>
(3000 rpm for example, which exceeds the number of revolution<br>
for idling) , the start-up clutch 40 blocks power transmission<br>
between the crankshaft 22 and the stepless speed changer 23,<br>
while when the number of revolution of the engine 20 exceeds<br>
the predetermined value, the centrifugal force exerted to the<br>
weight 40c works against an urging force of the spring 40e which<br>
works radially inwardly and hence the weight 40c moves radially<br>
outwardly, whereby the shoe 40d presses the inner peripheral<br>
surface of the outer case 40a by a force larger than the<br>
predetermined value and the crankshaft 22 is connected to the<br>
sleeve 58d via the start-up clutch 40. Accordingly, the<br>
rotational power of the crankshaft 22 is transmitted to the<br>
sleeve 58d via the start-up clutch 40, whereby the drive side<br>
power transmission pulley 58 fixed to the sleeve 58d is driven.<br>
[0036]<br>
The one-way clutch 44 includes a cup-shaped outer clutch<br>
44a, an inner clutch 44b inserted into the outer clutch 44a<br>
coaxially, and a roller 44c which enables transmission of a<br>
power only in one direction from the inner clutch 44b to the<br>
outer clutch 44a. The outer clutch 44a serves also as the inner<br>
rotor body of the drive motor 21b, and is configured of the<br>
same material as the inner rotor body. Then, the inner<br>
periphery of the boss of the inner rotor body and the outer<br>
periphery of the driven shaft 60 which serves as the drive shaft<br>
of the rear wheel WR are spline fitted via the speed reduction<br>
mechanism 69, and the inner periphery of the inner clutch 44b<br>
and the left end of the boss 62c of the driven side fixed pulley<br>
half 62a are spline fitted.<br>
[0037]<br>
In this arrangement, a power from the engine 20<br>
transmitted to the driven side power transmission pulley 62<br>
of the stepless speed changer 23 is transmitted to the rear<br>
wheel WR via the driven side fixed pulley half 62a, the inner<br>
clutch 44b, the outer clutch 44a, that is, the inner rotor body,<br>
the driven shaft 60, and the speed reduction mechanism 69, while<br>
a power from the rear wheel WR side generated when the rider<br>
pushes the vehicle manually or during regenerative operation<br>
is transmitted to the speed reduction mechanism 69, the driven<br>
shaft 60, the inner rotor body, that is, the outer clutch 44a.<br>
However, since the outer clutch 44a runs idle with respect to<br>
the inner clutch 44b, such power is not transmitted to the<br>
stepless speed changer 23 and the engine 20.<br>
[0038]<br>
The drive motor 21b is provided in such a manner that<br>
the driven shaft 60 disposed in parallel with the vehicle width<br>
direction serves as a motor output shaft on the rear side of<br>
the power transmission case 59. In other words, in the drive<br>
motor 21b, the driven shaft 60, which is an input shaft to the<br>
speed reduction mechanism 69, serves also as a motor output<br>
shaft. It is for reducing the speed of the power from the drive<br>
motor 21b by the speed reduction mechanism 69 provided<br>
generally between the stepless speed changer 23 and the rear<br>
wheel WR and transmitting the same to the rear wheel WR.<br>
Accordingly, in comparison with the power unit which is not<br>
provided with the speed reduction mechanism 69 between the<br>
stepless speed changer 23 and the rear wheel WR and is directly<br>
connected to the motor, increase in number of components due<br>
to provide the speed reduction mechanism additionally can be<br>
prevented, or the drive motor 21b can be downsized.<br>
[0039]<br>
An inner rotor 80 includes an inner rotor body which is<br>
formed into cup shape and is spline fitted to the driven shaft<br>
60 at a boss 80b formed at the center thereof, that is, the<br>
inner clutch 44b, and a magnet 80c disposed on the outer<br>
peripheral surface of the opening side of the inner clutch 44b.<br>
On the other hand, a stator 83 is configured by a coil 83c formed<br>
by winding a conductor wire on a teeth 83b fixed to a stator<br>
case 83a in the power transmission case 59.<br>
In this arrangement, the drive motor 21b functions as<br>
a dynamotor when assisting the output of the engine 20, and<br>
in addition, serves also as a power generator (generator) which<br>
converts the rotation of the driven shaft 60 into the electric<br>
energy and performs regenerative charging to the battery 74.<br>
[0040]<br>
The speed reduction mechanism 69 is provided in a gear<br>
case 70 which continues from the power transmission case 59<br>
on the right side of the rear end thereof. The speed reduction<br>
mechanism 69 is provided with an intermediate shaft (power<br>
transmission shaft) 73 which is supported in parallel with the<br>
driven shaft 60 and an axle 68 of the rear wheel WR. The driven<br>
shaft 60 and the intermediate shaft 73 are connected by a first<br>
speed reduction gear pair 71, and the intermediate shaft 73<br>
and the axle 68 are connected by a second speed reduction gear<br>
pair 72.<br>
In this arrangement, the rotational power of the driven<br>
shaft 60 is transmitted to the axle 68 after having reduced<br>
in speed at a predetermined speed reduction ratio via the first<br>
speed reduction gear pair 71 and the second speed reduction<br>
gear pair 72, whereby the rear wheel WR is driven so as to cause<br>
the motorcycle 1A to be started and traveled.<br>
[0041]<br>
In the hybrid vehicle with the arrangement as described<br>
above, when starting the engine, the crankshaft 22 is rotated<br>
by the use of the ACG starter motor 2la on the crankshaft 22.<br>
At this time, the start-up clutch 40 is not connected, and power<br>
transmission from the crankshaft 22 to the stepless speed<br>
changer 23 is blocked. Then, air-fuel mixture taken into the<br>
cylinder 27 synchronously with the rotation of the crankshaft<br>
22 is caused to be burned by the ignition plug 29, thereby<br>
reciprocating the piston 25.<br>
Then, when the number of revolution of the crankshaft<br>
22 exceeds a predetermined value (3000 rpm, for example)<br>
corresponding to the operating amount of the throttle grip,<br>
the rotational power of the crankshaft 22 is transmitted to<br>
the stepless speed changer 23, the one-way clutch 44, and the<br>
speed reduction mechanism 69 via the start-up clutch 40,<br>
thereby driving the rear wheel WR.<br>
[0042]<br>
When starting up, it is also possible to activate the<br>
drive motor 21b by power distribution from the buttery 74, and<br>
assist the rotation of the driven shaft 60 by the engine power.<br>
Instead of the start-up by the engine 20, the startup<br>
only by the drive motor 21b is also possible. In this case,<br>
since rotation of the driven shaft 60 by the drive motor 21b<br>
is not transmitted to the driven side power transmission pulley<br>
62 by the one-way clutch 44, the stepless speed changer 23 is<br>
not driven. Accordingly, when the rear wheel WR is driven only<br>
by the drive motor 21b for traveling, the energy transmission<br>
efficiency is improved.<br>
[0043]<br>
When traveling only by the engine 20 and when a load during<br>
acceleration or during travel at a high speed is significant,<br>
the drive motor 21b may be used to assist the traveling by the<br>
engine. At this time, the rotational power of the crankshaft<br>
22 caused by the reciprocal motion of the piston 25 is<br>
transmitted to the driven shaft 60 via the start-up clutch 40,<br>
the stepless speed changer 23, and the one-way clutch 44, and<br>
the power from the drive motor 21b is also transmitted thereto<br>
via the one-way clutch 44, whereby the rear wheel WR is driven<br>
by the combined power via the speed reduction mechanism 69.<br>
In contrast, when traveling only by the drive motor 21b,<br>
the engine 20 may be used to assist the traveling by the motor.<br>
[0044]<br>
In the traveling at a constant speed (cruise traveling),<br>
in the case where only the drive motor 21b is used as a power<br>
source, even when the engine 20 is driven, power can be<br>
generated by the ACG starter motor 2la without driving the<br>
stepless speed changer 23 as long as the number of revolution<br>
of the engine 20 does not exceed the number of revolution when<br>
the start-up clutch 40 is connected (the above-described<br>
predetermined value).<br>
In the case where only the drive motor 21b is used as<br>
a power source during the traveling at the constant speed, power<br>
transmission from the drive motor 21b to the rear wheel WR is<br>
performed without driving the stepless speed changer 23, high<br>
energy transmission efficiency is achieved.<br>
[0045]<br>
When reducing the speed, since the one-way clutch 44 does<br>
not transmit the rotation of the driven shaft 60 to the driven<br>
side power transmission pulley 62 of the stepless speed changer<br>
23, rotation of the axle 68 can be regenerated at the drive<br>
motor 21b directly via the speed reduction mechanism 69 without<br>
driving the stepless speed changer 23.<br>
In other word, since the power transmitted from the rear<br>
wheel WR to the drive motor 21b during regenerative operation<br>
from the rear wheel WR to the drive motor 21b is not consumed<br>
for driving the stepless speed changer 23, the charging<br>
efficiency at the time of regeneration is improved.<br>
[0046]<br>
Subsequently, the speed reduction mechanism 69 is<br>
described in detail.<br>
As shown in fig. 5, the gear case 70 is composed of a<br>
container-shaped case body 70A having an opening on the outside<br>
in terms of the vehicle width direction, and part of an inner<br>
wall portion (wall portion) 59C of the power transmission case<br>
59 (case body 59A) to which the opening side of the case body<br>
70A faces, and the case body 70A is fixed to the inner wall<br>
potion 59C of the power transmission case 59 in a state in which<br>
the opening thereof is closed by the inner wall portion 59C.<br>
[0047]<br>
The driven shaft 60, which is an input shaft of the speed<br>
reduction mechanism 69, is provided in such a manner that the<br>
right portion thereof is penetrated through the inner wall<br>
portion 59C of the power transmission case 59 and is projected<br>
into a space 70K within the gear case 70. The left end portion<br>
of the driven shaft 60 is rotatably supported by a radial ball<br>
bearing 85, which is a bearing disposed on the side of a space<br>
59K of an outer wall portion 59D of the power transmission case<br>
59 (cover 59B) . The right end portion of the driven shaft 60<br>
is rotatably supported by a radial ball bearing 86, which is<br>
a bearing disposed on the side of a space 70K of a bottom wall<br>
portion (inner wall portion) 70C of the gear case 70. The right<br>
portion of the driven gear 60 is rotatably supported also by<br>
a radial ball bearing 87 (the second bearing) which is a bearing<br>
disposed on the side of the gear case 70 of the inner wall portion<br>
59C of the power transmission case 59. Disposed at the right<br>
end portion of the driven shaft 60 between the both radial ball<br>
bearings 86, 87 which support the right portion and adjacent<br>
to the radial ball bearing 86 on the right end side, a<br>
small-diameter gear 71A is integrally formed on the outer<br>
periphery thereof.<br>
[0048]<br>
The intermediate shaft 73 of the speed reduction<br>
mechanism 69 is integrally fixed on the right portion thereof<br>
with a large-diameter gear 7 IB which meshes with the<br>
small-diameter gear 71A on the driven shaft 60, and the<br>
large-diameter gear 7 IB and the small-diameter gear 71A of the<br>
driven shaft 60 constitute the first speed reduction gear pair<br>
71. A portion of the intermediate shaft 73 on the left side<br>
of the large-diameter gear 7IB, there is integrally formed a<br>
small-diameter gear 72A on the outer periphery thereof. The<br>
left end of the intermediate gear 73 is rotatably supported<br>
by a radial ball bearing 88 (the first bearing) which is a<br>
bearing disposed at the inner wall portion 59C of the power<br>
transmission case 59 on the side of the space 70K of the gear<br>
case 70, and the right end of the intermediate shaft 73 is<br>
rotatably supported by a radial ball bearing 89, which is a<br>
bearing disposed on the bottle wall portion 70C of the gear<br>
case 70 on the side of the space 70K. Given the portion of<br>
the intermediate shaft 73 between the small-diameter gear 72 A and the radial ball bearing 88 on the left end side is a<br>
general-diameter portion 73a of the intermediate shaft 73, the<br>
maximum outer diameter (outer diameter of addendum circle) of<br>
the small-diameter gear 72A is larger than the outer diameter<br>
thereof.<br>
[0049]<br>
The axle 68, which is an output shaft of the speed<br>
reduction mechanism 69, is penetrated through a hub portion<br>
7OB provided on the bottom wall portion 70C of the gear case<br>
70 and is spline connected to a hub portion 77 of a wheel 76<br>
of the rear wheel WR. A brake drum 78 formed so as to surround<br>
the hub portion 77 is integrally provided on the inner<br>
peripheral side of the wheel 76, and a drum brake device of<br>
the rear wheel WR is configured of the brake drum 78 and a base<br>
portion 79 provided integrally on the right side of the gear<br>
case 70. The left end portion of the axle 68 is rotatably<br>
supported by a radial ball bearing 90, which is a bearing<br>
provided at the inner wall portion 59C of the power transmission<br>
case 59 on the side of the space 70K of the gear case 70, and<br>
the right portion of the axle 68 is rotatably supported by a<br>
radial ball bearing 91, which is a bearing disposed within the<br>
hub portion 70B of the gear case 70. Provided on the axle 68<br>
between the both radial ball bearing 90, 91 which supports the<br>
left end portion and the right portion of the axle 68 and<br>
adjacent to the radial ball bearings 90 on the left end side,<br>
a large-diameter gear 72B which meshes with the small-diameter<br>
gear 72A of the intermediate shaft 73 is integrally fixed<br>
therewith, and the large-diameter gear 72B and the smalldiameter<br>
gear 72A of the intermediate shaft 73 constitute the<br>
second speed reduction gear pair 72.<br>
[0050]<br>
The radial ball bearing 85 on the left end side of the<br>
driven shaft 60 is disposed within a storage section 92 which<br>
is formed by shifting part of the outer wall portion 59D of<br>
the power transmission case 59 leftward. The storage section<br>
92 has an inner peripheral surface which aligns with the outer<br>
peripheral surface of the outer lace of the radial ball bearing<br>
85. Therefore, by press-fitting the radial ball bearing 85<br>
from the space 7OK of the gear case 70 leftward into the storage<br>
section 92, the radial ball bearing 85 is supported by the outer<br>
wall portion 59D over the entire perimeter thereof.<br>
Likewise, by mounting the radial ball bearing 86 on the<br>
right end side of the driven gear 60 from the side of the space<br>
70K of the gear case 70 rightward into a storage section 93<br>
provided on the bottom wall portion 70C of the gear case 70,<br>
the radial ball bearing 86 is supported over the entire<br>
perimeter thereof.<br>
[0051]<br>
By mounting the radial ball bearing 88 on the left end<br>
side of the intermediate shaft 73 from the side of the space<br>
70K of the gear case 70 leftward into a storage section<br>
(recessed portion) 95 which is formed by shifting part of the<br>
inner wall portion 59C of the power transmission case <br>
leftward, the radial ball bearing 88 is supported by the inner<br>
wall portion 59C over the entire perimeter thereof, and by<br>
mounting the radial ball bearing 89 on the right end side of<br>
the intermediate shaft 73 from the side of the space 7OK of<br>
the gear case 70 rightward into a storage section 96 provided<br>
on the bottom wall portion 70C of the gear case 70, the radial<br>
ball bearing 89 is supported by the bottom wall portion 70C<br>
over the entire periphery thereof.<br>
By mounting the radial ball bearing 90 on the left end<br>
side of the axle 68 from the side of the space 70K of the gear<br>
case 70 leftward into a storage section 97 provided on the inner<br>
wall portion 59C of the power transmission case 59, the radial<br>
ball bearing 90 is supported by the inner wall portion 59C over<br>
the entire perimeter thereof, and by mounting the radial ball<br>
bearing 91 on the right portion of the axle 68 rightward from<br>
the side of the space 70K of the gear case 70 rightward into<br>
the hub portion 70B of the gear case 70, the radial ball bearing<br>
91 is supported by the hub portion 70B over the entire perimeter<br>
thereof.<br>
[0052]<br>
The radial ball bearing 87 for supporting the right<br>
portion of the driven shaft 60 is attached to the power<br>
transmission case 59 via a separate bearing holder 100.<br>
Referring also Fig. 6, the bearing holder 100 includes<br>
an annular holder body 101 which surrounds the radial ball<br>
bearing 87, and three fixing flanges 102 extending from the<br>
right end portion of the holder body 101 toward the outer<br>
periphery thereof formed integrally with each other. The<br>
respective fixing flanges 102 are disposed at substantially<br>
regular intervals in the circumferential direction of the<br>
holder body 101, and the bearing holder 100 is fixed to the<br>
inner wall portion 59C when bolts 103 which penetrate through<br>
the respective fixing flanges 102 are tightened into the inner<br>
wall portion 59C.<br>
[0053]<br>
Two of the fixing flanges 102 are provided on the holder<br>
body 101 on the side of the intermediate shaft 73 so as to be<br>
substantially symmetry with respect to a straight line L<br>
connecting the shaft center of the driven shaft 60 and the shaft<br>
center of the intermediate shaft 73 in side view in Fig. 6,<br>
and the remaining one of the flanges is provided on the holder<br>
body 101 at the position opposite from the intermediate shaft<br>
73. This is for preventing the fixing bolts 103 from being<br>
disposed between the driven shaft 60 and the intermediate shaft<br>
73.<br>
[0054]<br>
The holder body 101 includes an inner peripheral surface<br>
which aligns with the outer peripheral surface of the outer<br>
lace of the radial ball bearing 87. By mounting the radial<br>
ball bearing 87 into the bolder body 101 by press-fitting or<br>
the like, the radial ball bearing 87 is retained in a state<br>
of being surrounded by the bearing holder 100 over the entire<br>
perimeter thereof. By mounting and fixing the bearing holder<br>
100 from the side of the space 70K of the gear case 70 leftward<br>
into a mounting portion 94 of the inner wall portion 59C of<br>
the power transmission case 59, the radial ball bearing 87 is<br>
supported by the inner wall portion 59C via the bearing holder<br>
100 over the entire perimeter thereof.<br>
[0055]<br>
The bearing holder 100 and the radial ball bearing 87<br>
retained thereby are disposed so that the portion on the side<br>
of the intermediate shaft 73 is partly overlapped with the<br>
portion of the radial ball bearing 88 on the left end side of<br>
the intermediate shaft 73 on the side of the driven shaft 60<br>
when viewed in the axial direction (lateral direction). The<br>
radial ball bearing 89 on the right end side of the intermediate<br>
shaft 73 is a component identical to the radial ball bearing<br>
88 on the right end side, and these ball bearings are disposed<br>
coaxially. Therefore, the bearing holder 100 and the radial<br>
ball bearing 87 are overlapped also with the radial ball bearing<br>
89 in axial view.<br>
[0056]<br>
In addition, since the radial ball bearing 88 on the left<br>
end side of the intermediate shaft 73 is stored in the storage<br>
section 95 which is formed by shifting part of the inner wall<br>
portion 59C of the power transmission case 59 leftward, the<br>
bearing holder 100 and the radial ball bearing 87 are located<br>
between the radial ball bearing 88 on the left end side of the<br>
intermediate shaft 73 and the small-diameter gear 72A in the<br>
axial direction, and the bearing holder 100 and the<br>
general-diameter portion 73a of the intermediate shaft 73 are<br>
disposed close to each other so that the portion of the bearing<br>
holder 100 on the side of the intermediate shaft 73 is partly<br>
overlapped with the maximum outer diameter portion of the<br>
small-diameter gear 72A on the side of the driven shaft in axial<br>
view. Consequently, the distance between the driven shaft 60<br>
and the intermediate shaft 73 are reduced, and the diameters<br>
of the respective gears 71A and 72B which constitute the first<br>
speed reduction gear pair 71 for linking the driven gear 60<br>
and the intermediate shaft 73 are reduced.<br>
[0057]<br>
Since the storage section 95 in which the radial ball<br>
bearing 88 on the left end side of the intermediate shaft <br>
are disposed is formed into a recessed shape on the inner wall<br>
portion 59C of the power transmission case 59 when viewed from<br>
the side of the space 70K of the gear case 70, by disposing<br>
the radial ball bearing 88 in this storage section 95, the space<br>
for disposing components in the space 70K of the gear case 70<br>
can be increased. Although the storage section 95 is formed<br>
into a projected shape on the inner wall portion 59C of the<br>
power transmission case 59 when viewed form the space 59K of<br>
the power transmission case 59, since the storage section 95<br>
is provided so as to be positioned on the inner side of the<br>
bowl-shaped driven side fixed pulley half 62a, the influence<br>
to the space for disposing the components in the space 59K is<br>
constrained, whereby lowering of flexibility of layout of the<br>
stepless speed changer 23 is prevented.<br>
[0058]<br>
By disposing the radial ball bearing 88 axially between<br>
the set of the bearing holder 100 and the radial ball bearing<br>
87 and the inner wall portion 59C (the bottom wall portion of<br>
the storage section 95), the bearing holder 100 and the radial<br>
ball bearing 87 serve also as a stopper for preventing the<br>
bearing holder 100 and the radial ball bearing 87 from coming<br>
off from the storage section 95 of the radial ball bearing 88.<br>
Since a space S is formed between the radial ball bearing 88<br>
and the set of the bearing holder 100 and the radial ball bearing<br>
87 in the axial direction, the part tolerance of the respective<br>
radial ball bearings 87, 88 and the bearing holder 100 in the<br>
axial direction, and the mounting tolerance with respect to<br>
the inner wall portion 59C can be absorbed. The radial ball<br>
bearing 88 which is disposed within the storage section 95<br>
formed by shifting part of the inner wall portion 59C leftward<br>
is disposed on the far side (that is, the left side) of the<br>
radial ball bearing 87 in terms of the mounting direction of<br>
the respective radial ball bearings 87, 88. In other words,<br>
the radial ball bearing 87 is disposed on the front side (that<br>
is, the right side) of the radial ball bearing 88 in the mounting<br>
direction.<br>
[0059]<br>
Since the first embodiment employs an arrangement<br>
structure of bearings in which the driven shaft 60 and the<br>
intermediate shaft 73, which are disposed in substantially<br>
parallel to each other and linked to each other are rotatably<br>
supported via the radial ball bearings 87, 88, respectively,<br>
and the respective radial ball bearings 87 88 are disposed so<br>
as to be overlapped partly with each other in axial view, the<br>
center distance between the driven shaft 60 and the<br>
intermediate shaft 73 is reduced and diameters of the<br>
small-diameter gear 71A and the large-diameter gear 7IB which<br>
link the shafts 60, 73 are reduced respectively in comparison<br>
with the case in which the respective radial ball bearings 87,<br>
88 are disposed in a juxtaposed manner so as to extend along<br>
the inner wall portion 59C of the power transmission case 59<br>
which supports the respective radial ball bearings 87, 88.<br>
Therefore, downsizing of the rear portion of the power<br>
unit 11 including the gear case 70 is achieved, and weight<br>
reduction by reducing the diameters of the respective gears<br>
71A, 7IB is also achieved. In particular, in the motorcycle<br>
1A of a unit swing type, the weight reduction of the rear portion,<br>
which corresponds to the distal side of swinging motion of the<br>
power unit 11 which is located below the spring, is very<br>
effective in terms of the traveling performance of the<br>
motorcycle 1A.<br>
[0060]<br>
In the arrangement structure of bearings described above,<br>
since the respective radial ball bearings 87, 88 are mounted<br>
from the side of the space 70K of the gear case 70 leftward<br>
into the inner wall portion 59C which supports the radial ball<br>
bearings 87, 88, when assembling the speed reduction mechanism<br>
69 which includes the radial ball bearings 87, 88, the radial<br>
ball bearings 87, 88 can be mounted to the inner wall portion<br>
59C in the same direction. In other words, the mounting<br>
properties of the respective radial ball bearings 87, 88 can<br>
be improved. Since maintenance of the radial ball bearings<br>
87, 88 can be performed in the same direction by removing the<br>
gear case 70, maintenanceability of the respective radial ball<br>
bearings 87, 88 can be improved.<br>
[0061]<br>
In the arrangement structure of bearings described above,<br>
since the storage section 95 is formed on the inner wall portion<br>
59C for supporting the respective radial ball bearings 87, 88<br>
so that the radial ball bearing 88 is arranged on the far side<br>
with respect to the radial ball bearing 87 in terms of the<br>
mounting direction of the radial ball bearings 87, 88, when<br>
mounting the respective radial ball bearings 87, 88 on the inner<br>
wall portion 59C,the radial ball bearing 88 is mounted to the<br>
inner wall portion 59C in a state in which the radial ball<br>
bearing 88 is disposed within the storage section 95 so as to<br>
dispose the same in the far side in terms of the mounting<br>
direction, and then, the radial ball bearing 87 is mounted to<br>
the inner wall portion 59C. Accordingly, the respective<br>
radial ball bearings 87, 88 can be easily mounted, whereby<br>
assembleability of these ball bearings can be further improved.<br>
[0062]<br>
Since the radial ball bearing 88 is disposed within the<br>
recessed storage section 95, even when the positions to arrange<br>
the radial ball bearings 87, 88 are shifted in the axial<br>
direction so as to overlap with each other in axial view, the<br>
space 70K in the gear case 70 is not reduced. In contrast,<br>
since the radial ball bearing 88 is stored in the storage<br>
section 95, the space for arranging the parts in the space 70K<br>
can be increased. In this manner, efficient arrangement of<br>
the radial ball bearing 88 is enabled, whereby further<br>
downsizing of the power unit 11 including the gear case 70 is<br>
achieved.<br>
[0063]<br>
Furthermore, in the arrangement structure of bearings<br>
described above, since the bearing holder 100 for surrounding<br>
and retaining the radial ball bearing 88 is provided, and the<br>
radial ball bearing 88 is mounted to the inner wall portion<br>
59C via the bearing holder 100, the radial ball bearing 88 can<br>
be supported via the bearing holder 100 over the entire<br>
perimeter thereof. In other words, the mounting strength of<br>
the radial ball bearing 88 with respect to the inner wall<br>
portion 59C can be improved.<br>
[0064]<br>
Furthermore, in the arrangement structure of bearings<br>
described above, since the radial ball bearing 88 is disposed<br>
between the set of the bearing holder 100 and the radial ball<br>
bearing 87 and the inner wall portion 59C in the axial direction,<br>
and the set of the radial ball bearing 88 and the bearing holder<br>
100 and the radial ball bearing 87 are disposed so as to form<br>
the space S in the axial direction, the part tolerance of the<br>
respective radial ball bearings 87, 88 and the bearing holder<br>
100 in the axial direction and the mounting tolerance with<br>
respect to the inner wall portion 59C can be absorbed, and hence<br>
mounting accuracy of the respective radial ball bearings 87,<br>
88 and the bearing holder 100 can be improved.<br>
[Second Embodiment]<br>
[0065]<br>
Subsequently, a second embodiment of the present<br>
invention will be described.<br>
In this second embodiment, since only the fact that the<br>
bearing holder 100 is not used is different from the first<br>
embodiment, the parts corresponding to the first embodiment<br>
are represented by the same reference numerals and the<br>
description will be omitted.<br>
[0066]<br>
As shown in Figs. 7 and 8, in the arrangement structure<br>
of bearings according to the second embodiment, by mounting<br>
the radial ball bearing 87 for supporting the right portion<br>
of the driven shaft 60 to the mounting portion 94 provided on<br>
the inner wall portion 59C of the power transmission case 59<br>
leftward from the side of the space 70K of the gear case 70<br>
by press-fitting or the like, the radial ball bearing 87 is<br>
supported by the inner wall portion 59C. The portion of the<br>
radial ball bearing 87 on the side of the intermediate shaft<br>
73 is disposed so as to overlap partly with the radial ball<br>
bearing 88 on the left end side of the intermediate shaft 73<br>
in axial view.<br>
[0067]<br>
In the same manner as the first embodiment, the radial<br>
ball bearing 88 is disposed between the radial ball bearing<br>
87 and the inner wall portion 59C (the bottom wall portion of<br>
the storage section 95) in the axial direction. In addition,<br>
a space S' is formed between the respective radial ball bearings<br>
87, 88. Furthermore, the radial ball bearing 88 disposed<br>
within the storage section 95 is disposed on the far side with<br>
respect to the radial ball bearing 87 in the mounting direction<br>
of the radial ball bearings 87, 88.<br>
[0068]<br>
In the arrangement structure of bearings according to<br>
the second embodiment as well, as in the first embodiment, the<br>
assembleability of the radial ball bearings 87, 88 is improved<br>
and maintenanceability of the speed reduction mechanism 69 is<br>
improved in addition to the achievement of weight reduction<br>
by downsizing of the rear portion of the power unit 11 including<br>
the gear case 70 and reduction of the diameters of the<br>
respective gears 71A, 7IB. Also, mounting accuracy of the<br>
radial ball bearings 87, 88 can be improved by absorbing the<br>
part tolerance of the radial ball bearings 87, 88 in the axial<br>
direction and the mounting tolerance thereof with respect to<br>
the inner wall portion 59C.<br>
[0069]<br>
The invention is not limited to the embodiments described<br>
above and, for example, the mounting strength of the radial<br>
ball bearing 88 with respect to the inner wall portion 59C can<br>
be improved by eliminating the space S or S' between the radial<br>
ball bearings 87, 88 and interposing the radial ball bearing<br>
88 between the radial ball bearing 87 and the inner wall portion<br>
59C (the bottom wall portion of the storage section 95) in the<br>
axial direction, the mounting strength of the radial ball<br>
bearing 88 with respect to the inner wall portion 59C can be<br>
improved.<br>
In addition, as long as a structure is such that the<br>
respective bearings are partly overlapped in axial view between<br>
the radial ball bearing 88 which supports the intermediate<br>
shaft 73 and the radial ball bearing 90 which supports the axle<br>
68, or between the radial ball bearings 86, 89 which are mounted<br>
to the bottom wall portion 70C of the gear case 70, the<br>
arrangement structure of bearings as described above can be<br>
applied.<br>
Furthermore, when using the bearing holder 100, for<br>
example, fixation by press-fitting or the like may be employed<br>
besides the fixation to the gear case 70 using a bolt.<br>
Alternatively, a structure in which the storage section 95 is<br>
a recess formed in the vicinity thereof for simply shifting<br>
the radial ball bearing 88 leftward, and the radial ball bearing<br>
88 is supported by other supporting means.<br>
The structures in the respective embodiments are shown<br>
simply for illustration, and various modifications may be made<br>
without departing from the scope of the invention, as a mater<br>
of course.<br>
