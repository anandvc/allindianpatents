				<td>The present invention relates to a novel metallic paste composition useful as an<br>
interlayer in diffusion soldering.<br>
The novel metallic paste composition of the present invention will be useful in and<br>
related to diffusion soldering for joining two metals/alloys in an easier way. Its intended<br>
application is in consumer, medical, telecommunication, automobiles, microelectronics, high<br>
temperature and high power applications, high reliability applications and the like.<br>
The known process of diffusion soldering for joining metals/ alloys, metallic/ alloy<br>
components (parts) involves using an interlayer of low melting joining element or alloy<br>
sandwiched between them at appropriate temperature and pressure for appropriate time. The<br>
joining element or alloy reacts with the parts to form intermetallic phases, by the principle of<br>
isothermal solidification, which are stable at relatively higher temperature than the processing<br>
temperature of the joint. Suitable selection of the combination of the metals/ alloys/ parts to be<br>
joined, the joining element/ alloy, their relative thickness and the processing condition governs<br>
the formation of intermetallics and thereby the properties of the resultant joint.<br>

Chang and W. Gust, Zeitschrift fur Metallkunde, vol. 90, pp.470-74, 1999, wherein the known<br>
methods of providing the interlayer in the diffusion soldering process are such as by using<br>
performs or foils, thermal deposition, sputtering, electro/ electroless plating. The above stated<br>
known processes have the following drawbacks. The use of preforms or foils is comparatively<br>
easy but their cutting in desired shape and handling are rather difficult. Availability of preforms<br>
or foils of the desired interlayer element/ alloy in the desired thickness may not be always<br>
possible. Thermal deposition or sputtering are good techniques for controlling the thickness of<br>
the interlayer but are relatively costly and not suitable for large scale production purposes and<br>
for handling large dimension parts. Availability of targets of the desired interlayer element/<br>
alloy and vacuum chambers may not be always possible. Electro/ electroless plating are rather<br>
low cost processes but involve a complete set-up of the desired interlayer to be plated and<br>
standardisation of process and sometimes involve use of hazardous chemicals. Handling of parts<br>
of large dimensions and providing interlayer by selective plating is rather difficult and<br>
expensive.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a novel metallic paste composition<br>
useful as an interlayer in diffusion soldering which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process of diffusion soldering<br>
using the novel metallic paste composition as an interlayer which enables joining of a wide<br>
spectrum of metals of varied geometries.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a novel metallic paste for diffusion soldering which is<br>
environment friendly.<br>
Still another object is to provide a novel metallic paste which is easy to apply.<br>
Still another object is to provide a novel metallic paste which when used as an interlayer<br>
in diffusion soldering, results in a stable and mechanically strong joint.<br>
In the present invention, which relates to improvements in and related to diffusion<br>
soldering, comprises suitable selection of metallic/ alloy constituents taking into account the<br>
metals/ alloys to be joined, obtaining respective proportions of the constituents from the phase<br>
diagrams based on the temperature stability of the joint required and preparation of the material<br>
for providing interlayer: the constituents of the interlayer are selected and mixed in such a way<br>
that a smooth metallic paste is formed and once this is achieved then the metallic paste can be<br>
applied for providing interlayer by screen printing, stamping, applying with brush and the like.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a novel metallic paste composition useful as<br>
an interlayer in diffusion soldering which comprises:-<br>
i) first metallic element, liquid at room temperature : 20 to 50 wt %;<br>
ii) second metallic element in powder form capable of forming intermetallic compound<br>
with atleast one of the metals to be joined : 20 to 80 wt %;<br>
iii) third metallic element in powder form capable of forming intermetallic compound with<br>
the metal with which the second metallic element powder does not form an intermetallic<br>
compound : 0 to 80 wt %.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the first metallic element, liquid at room<br>
temperature of the order of 20 to 35Â° C, used may be such as Gallium.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the metallic elements used may be<br>
metals or alloys.<br>
The novel metallic paste composition of the present invention is not a mere admixture but a<br>
synergistic mixture having properties which are different from the mere aggregation of the<br>
properties of the individual ingredients and there is no chemical reaction involved in the<br>
preparation of the said composition.<br>
The present invention comprises of suitable selection of the constituents of the interlayer<br>
taking into account the metals/ alloys to be joined, examination of phase diagrams of<br>
participating materials with respect to temperature stability of joint required, obtaining<br>
respective proportions of the constituents from the phase diagrams taking into account the<br>
intermetallic phases required to govern the properties of the joint in order to provide the desired<br>
temperature stability and in some cases the viscosity/ wettability properties. The 1st metallic<br>
element/ alloy should be liquid at near room temperature of the order of 20 to 35 Â°C; 2nd<br>
metallic element/ alloy should be powder and 3rd metallic element/ alloy should be powder (if<br>
required) is selected taking into account the capability of forming intermetallics with either of<br>
the metals/ alloys to be joined or with the 1st metallic element/ alloy or with each other or with<br>
all, preparation of the material for providing interlayer by immersion and stirring of fine<br>
powders of different metals/ alloys in a metal/ alloy of relatively low melting point which is<br>
liquid at near room temperature. The constituents of the interlayer are selected and mixed in<br>
such a way that a smooth metallic paste is formed and once this is achieved then the metallic<br>
paste can be applied by for providing interlayer by screen printing, stamping, applying with<br>
brush and the like.<br>
In our copending patent application no. NF 160/02, we have described and claimed a<br>
process for diffusion soldering.<br>
The present invention provides a novel metallic paste composition useful in diffusion<br>
soldering which is used as follows:<br>
Cleaning by known methods the defined areas of metals to be joined. Coating a thin<br>
layer of novel metallic paste as an interlayer by screen printing, stamping, applying with brush<br>
and the like on one or both the defined areas, contacting the said defined areas face-to-face and<br>
heating the same at appropriate temperature, which is normally above the melting point of one<br>
or more interlayer material constituents, and pressure, in the range from zero to several MPa, for<br>
appropriate duration of time, in the range of few seconds to several hours in order to attain the<br>
desired intermetallic phases for forming the joints.<br>
The present invention can also be used for sealing purposes such as sealing of 1C<br>
packages, microelectronic modules and systems and the like.<br>
In the prior art one of the major constraint in joining different metals was the availability<br>
of the foil or plating bath or deposition target/ chamber whereby one can use foil or plated or<br>
deposited materials which may react with both the metals to be joined. With the invention of<br>
this interlayer metallic paste composition one can join a wide spectrum of metals by<br>
preparation of the material for providing interlayer taking into account the metals to be joined,<br>
selecting their constituents based on the intermetallic phase required to govern the joint.<br>
The inventive step is the use of an element which is liquid at near room temperature as<br>
the base and mixing the other constituents in the same resulting into a metallic paste. The<br>
novelty is to provide an interlayer using this metallic paste which improves the process of<br>
diffusion soldering and allows it to be used for a wide variety and size of components which<br>
was hitherto not possible. Using the material for providing interlayer of the present invention,<br>
diffusion soldering can be carried out at specified temperature, pressure and time as mentioned<br>
above, the molten pre-applied material reacts with the defined areas thereby connecting them<br>
with intermetallics formed by the process of isothermal solidification. These intermetallics are<br>
in accordance with the phase diagrams of the defined reacting materials and the property of<br>
joints is governed by the property of these phases.<br>
The following example is given by way of illustration and therefore should not be<br>
construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1:<br>
A typical case of joining copper and nickel pieces by diffusion soldering using the novel<br>
metallic paste composition of the present invention is illustrated. From standard available<br>
phase diagram it comes out that an interlayer material with aluminium- gallium- nickel (Al-Ga-<br>
Ni) is to be formed for attaining thermally stable joints. The contribution of different elements<br>
to the interlayer material composition by weight is primarily obtained from the standard binary<br>
phase diagrams of Al-Ni and Ni-Ga. The wt % of (i) Gallium (liquid metallic element): 44.87<br>
wt %; (ii) nickel (powder form): 37.82 wt % and (iii) aluminium (powder form): 17.31 wt %.<br>
The interlayer material is formulated by immersion of fine Al and Ni powder into liquid Ga and<br>
stirring the same to obtain it in the form of a paste. The interlayer material is then applied to the<br>
defined area of a Cu piece by brush which is to be connected to the defined area of a Ni piece.<br>
The two pieces are then brought into contact with each other by application of 0.5 MPa<br>
pressure. This assembly is heated up to 700 Â°C and the temperature maintained for 5 min in<br>
vacuum. This results in the formation of desired intermetallics thereby joining the defined areas<br>
of Cu and Ni pieces.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1. It can be used to join a wide spectrum of metals by preparing the interlayer material<br>
accordingly.<br>
2. The related process for fabrication of joints is environment friendly as it avoids the use of<br>
toxic elements such as Pb, Cd, Tl etc. and effluxes containing chlorofluorocarbons.<br>
3. Since the interlayer material does not contain materials like organic binders, thinners,<br>
screening agents and the like so there are no burn- outs during processing.<br>
4. The interlayer material is easy to apply by methods such as applying by brush, screen<br>
printing, stamping etc. so the process becomes relatively simple and low cost.<br>
5. The sizes and shapes of the parts to be joined do not matter in this novel method of<br>
applying the interlayer.<br>
6. The shelf life of the interlayer material can be changed by proper selection of materials. It<br>
may be varied from a few minutes to several months. This is a unique novel feature opening<br>
the vast window of room temperature diffusion soldering using such material.<br>
7. The joints produced using such an interlayer material and the related fabrication process are<br>
stable at temperatures higher than the fabrication temperature and their mechanical strength<br>
is also high.<br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	A novel metallic paste composition useful as an interlayer in diffusion soldering which<br>
comprises:<br>
i)         first metallic element, liquid at room temperature : 20 to 50 wt%;<br>
ii)        second metallic element in powder form capable of forming intermetallic<br>
compound with atleast one of the metals to be joined : 20 to 80 wt %; iii)      third metallic  element in powder form  capable  of forming intermetallic<br>
compound with the metal with which the second metallic element powder does<br>
not form an intermetallic compound : 0 to 80 wt %.<br>
2.	A novel metallic paste composition as claimed in claim 1, wherein the metallic element,<br>
liquid at room temperature of the order of 20 to 35Â° C, used is such as gallium.<br>
3.	A novel metallic paste composition as claimed in claim 1-2, wherein the metallic<br>
elements used is such as a metal or alloy.<br>
4.	A novel metallic paste composition useful in diffusion soldering substantially as herein<br>
described with reference to the example.<br></td>
