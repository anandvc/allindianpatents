				<td>The present invention relates to a benzamide compound of the formula (I).<br>
The present invention relates to novel benzamide inhibitors of the P2X7 receptor, processes for their preparation, intermediates useful in their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and their use in therapy. The active compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis; allergies, asthma, COPD,. cancer, reperfusion or ischemia in stroke or heart attack, autoimmune diseases and other disorders. The active compounds are also antagonists of the P2X7 receptor.<br>
The P2X7 receptor (previously known as P2Z receptor), which is a ligand-gated ion channel, is present on a variety of cell types, largely those known to be involved in inflammatory/immune process, specifically, macrophages, mast cells and lymphocytes (T and B). Activation of the P2X7 receptor by extracellular nucleotides, in particular adenosine triphosphate, leads to the release of interleukin-1 p (IL-1B) and giant cell formation (macrophages/microglial cells), degranulation (mast cells) and proliferation (T cells), apoptosis, and L-selectin shedding (lymphocytes). P2X7 receptors are also located on antigen-presenting cells (APC), keratinocytes, salivary acinar cells (parotid cells), hepatocytes and mesangial cells.<br>
P2X7 antagonists are known in the art, such as those described in International Patent Publications WO 01/46200, WO 01/42194, WO 01/44213, WO99/29660, WO 00/61569, WO 99/29661, WO 99/29686, WO 00/71529', and WO 01/44170, as well as in USSN 60/336,781 (attorney docket number PC23106A, filed November 12, 2002).<br>
Benzamides, heteroarylamides and reverse amides for uses other than inhibition of the P2X7  receptor are described  in  various publications,  such  as  International  Patent , Publications WO 97/22600, EP 138,527, WO 00/71509, WO 98/28269, WO 99/17777 and WO 01/58883.<br>

PHARMACOLOGICAL ANALYSIS<br>
Certain compounds such as benzoylbenzoyl adenosine triphosphate (bbATP) are known to be agonists of the P2X7 receptor, effecting the formation of pores in the plasma membrane (Drug Development Research (1996), 37(3). p. 126). Consequently, when the receptor is activated using bbATP in the presence of ethidium bromide (a fluorescent DNA probe), an increase in the fluorescence of intracellular DNA-bound ethidium bromide is observed. Alternatively, the propidium dye YOPRO-1 can be substituted for ethidium bromide so as to detect uptake of the dye. The increase in fluorescence can be used as a measure of P2X7 receptor activation and therefore to quantify the effect of a compound on the P2X7 receptor.<br>
In this manner, the compounds of the invention can be tested for antagonist activity at the P2X7 receptor. 96-Well flat bottomed microtitre plates are filled with 250 ul of test solution comprising 200 pi of a suspension of THP-1 cells (2.5 x 106 cells/ml, more preferably prestimulated as described in the literature with a combination of LPS and TNF to promote receptor expression) containing lO^M ethidium bromide, 25 ul of a high potassium, low sodium buffer solution (10mM Hepes, 150 mM KCI, 5 mM D-glucose and 1.0% FBS at pH 7.5) containing lO^M bbATP, ancL25 ul of the high potassium' buffer solution containing 3 x 10"5M test compound (more preferably 5 x 10""M, more preferably 1 x lO^M.more preferably 1 x 10"3M).   The plate is covered with a plastic sheet and incubated at 37°C for one hour. The plate is then read in a Perkin-Elmer fluorescent plate reader, excitation 520 nm, emission 595 nm, slit widths: Ex 15 nm, Em 20 nm.   For the purposes of comparison, bbATP (a P2X7 receptor agonist) and pyridoxal 5-phosphate (a P2X7 receptor antagonist) can be used separately in the test as controls.    From the readings obtained, a pICso figure can be calculated  for each  test compound,  this figure  being  the  negative  logarithm  of the concentration of test compound necessary to reduce the bbATP agonist activity by 50%.<br>
In like manner, the compounds of the invention can be tested for antagonist activity at the P2X7 receptor using the cytokine IL-1P as the readout. Blood collected from normal volunteers in the presence of heparin is fractionated using lymphocyte separation medium obtained from Organon Technica (Westchester, PA). The region of the resulting gradient containing banded mononuclear cells is harvested, diluted with 10 ml of Maintenance Medium (RPMI 1640, 5% FBS, 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 1% penicillin/streptomycin), and cells are collected by centrifugation. The resulting cell pellet was suspended in 10 ml of Maintenance Medium and a cell count was performed. In an average experiment, 2 x 10s mononuclear cells are seeded into each well of 96-well plates in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Monocytes are allowed to adhere for 2 hours, after which the supernatants are discarded and the attached cells are rinsed twice and then incubated in Maintenance Medium overnight at 37°C in a 5% CO2 environment.<br>
he cultured monocytes can be activated with 10 ng/ml LPS (E. coli serotype 055:65; Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO). Following a 2-hour incubation, the activation medium is removed, the cells are rinsed twice with 0.1 ml of Chase Medium (RPMI 1640, 1% FBS, 20 mM Hepes, 5 mM NaHCO3, pH 6.9), and then 0.1 ml of Chase Medium containing a test agent is added and the plate is incubated for 30 minutes; each test agent concentration can be evaluated in triplicate wells. ATP then is introduced (from a 100 mM stock solution, pH 7) to achieve a final concentration of 2 mM and the plate is incubated at 37°C for an additional 3 hours. Media were harvested and clarified by centrifugation, and their IL-1P content was determined by ELISA (R&amp;D Systems; Minneapolis, MN).<br>

The present invention also includes isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited in Formula I, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass<br>
number usually found in nature.    Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the  invention  include  isotopes  of hydrogen,  carbon,  nitrogen,  oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, such as 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18O, 17O, 31R, 32P, ^S, 18F, and 38CI,  respectively.     Compounds  of the  present invention,   prodrugs  thereof,  and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds or of said prodrugs which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention.    Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H and 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays.    Tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability.   Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence,  may be preferred  in some circumstances. Isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula I of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples and Preparations below, by substituting a readily available isotopically-labelled reagent for a non-isotopically-labelled reagent.<br>
The compounds of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be used in the manufacture of a medicament for the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of any disease state in a human, or other mammal, which is exacerbated or caused by excessive or unregulated cytokine production by such mammal's cells, such as but not limited to monocytes and/or macrophages.<br>
The present invention relates to a method for treating a IL-1 mediated disease in a mammal in need thereof, which comprises administering to said mammal an effective amount of a compound of formula I.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method for treating an IL-1 mediated condition. As defined herein, a "IL-1 mediated condition" includes but is not limited to a disease or disorder selected from the group consisting of arthritis (including psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis and acute synovitis), inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, emphysema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome, asthma, bronchitis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease, silfcosis, pulmonary sarcoidbsis, allergic reactions, allergic contact hypersensitivity, eczema, contact dermatitis, psoriasis, sunburn, cancer, tissue ulceration, restenosis, periodontal disease, epidermolysis bullosa, osteoporosis, bone resorption disease, loosening of artificial joint implants, atherosclerosis, aortic aneurysm, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, cerebral ischemia, head trauma, neurotrauma, spinal cord injury,<br>

PHARMACOLOGICAL ANALYSIS<br>
Certain compounds such as benzoylbenzoyl adenosine triphosphate (bbATP) are known to be agonists of the P2X7 receptor, effecting the formation of pores in the plasma membrane (Drug Development Research (1996), 37(3). p. 126). Consequently, when the receptor is activated using bbATP in the presence of ethidium bromide (a fluorescent DNA probe), an increase in the fluorescence of intracellular DNA-bound ethidium bromide is observed. Alternatively, the propidium dye YOPRO-1 can be substituted for ethidium bromide so as to detect uptake of the dye. The increase in fluorescence can be used as a measure of P2X7 receptor activation and therefore to quantify the effect of a compound on the P2X7 receptor.<br>
In this manner, the compounds of the invention can be tested for antagonist activity at the P2X7 receptor. 96-Well flat bottomed microtitre plates are filled with 250 ul of test solution comprising 200 pi of a suspension of THP-1 cells (2.5 x 106 cells/ml, more preferably prestimulated as described in the literature with a combination of LPS and TNF to promote receptor expression) containing lO^M ethidium bromide, 25 ul of a high potassium, low sodium buffer solution (10mM Hepes, 150 mM KCI, 5 mM D-glucose and 1.0% FBS at pH 7.5) containing lO^M bbATP, ancL25 ul of the high potassium' buffer solution containing 3 x 10"5M test compound (more preferably 5 x 10""M, more preferably 1 x lO^M.more preferably 1 x 10"3M).   The plate is covered with a plastic sheet and incubated at 37°C for one hour. The plate is then read in a Perkin-Elmer fluorescent plate reader, excitation 520 nm, emission 595 nm, slit widths: Ex 15 nm, Em 20 nm.   For the purposes of comparison, bbATP (a P2X7 receptor agonist) and pyridoxal 5-phosphate (a P2X7 receptor antagonist) can be used separately in the test as controls.    From the readings obtained, a pICso figure can be calculated  for each  test compound,  this figure  being  the  negative  logarithm  of the concentration of test compound necessary to reduce the bbATP agonist activity by 50%.<br>
In like manner, the compounds of the invention can be tested for antagonist activity at the P2X7 receptor using the cytokine IL-1P as the readout. Blood collected from normal volunteers in the presence of heparin is fractionated using lymphocyte separation medium obtained from Organon Technica (Westchester, PA). The region of the resulting gradient containing banded mononuclear cells is harvested, diluted with 10 ml of Maintenance Medium (RPMI 1640, 5% FBS, 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 1% penicillin/streptomycin), and cells are collected by centrifugation. The resulting cell pellet was suspended in 10 ml of Maintenance Medium and a cell count was performed. In an average experiment, 2 x 10s mononuclear cells are seeded into each well of 96-well plates in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Monocytes are allowed to adhere for 2 hours, after which the supernatants are discarded and the attached cells are rinsed twice and then incubated in Maintenance Medium overnight at 37°C in a 5% CO2 environment.<br>
he cultured monocytes can be activated with 10 ng/ml LPS (E. coli serotype 055:65; Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO). Following a 2-hour incubation, the activation medium is removed, the cells are rinsed twice with 0.1 ml of Chase Medium (RPMI 1640, 1% FBS, 20 mM Hepes, 5 mM NaHCO3, pH 6.9), and then 0.1 ml of Chase Medium containing a test agent is added and the plate is incubated for 30 minutes; each test agent concentration can be evaluated in triplicate wells. ATP then is introduced (from a 100 mM stock solution, pH 7) to achieve a final concentration of 2 mM and the plate is incubated at 37°C for an additional 3 hours. Media were harvested and clarified by centrifugation, and their IL-1P content was determined by ELISA (R&amp;D Systems; Minneapolis, MN).<br>

or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates or prodrugs thereof.<br>
The present invention also relates to the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of compounds of the formula I. The acids which are used to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the aforementioned base compounds of this invention are<br>
those which form non-toxic acid addition salts, i.e., salts containing pharmacologically acceptable anions, such as the chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, acetate, lactate, citrate, acid citrate, tartrate, bitartrate, succinate, maleate, fumarate, gluconate, saccharate, benzoate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and pamoate [i.e., 1,1'-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)]salts.<br>
The invention also relates to base addition salts of formula I. The chemical bases that may be used as reagents to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of those compounds of formula I that are acidic in nature are those that form non-toxic base salts with such compounds. Such non-toxic base salts include, but are not limited to those derived from such pharmacologically acceptable cations such as alkali metal cations (e.g., potassium and sodium) and alkaline earth metal cations (e.g., calcium and magnesium), ammonium or water-soluble amine addition salts such as N-methylglucamine-(meglumine), and the lower afkanolammonium and other base salts of pharmaceutically acceptable organic amines.<br>
This invention also encompasses pharmaceutical compositions containing prodrugs of compounds of the formula I. Compounds of formula I having free amino, amido, hydroxy or carboxylic groups can be converted into prodrugs. Prodrugs include compounds wherein an amino acid residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more (e.g., two, three or four) amino acid residues which are covalently joined through peptide bonds to free amino, hydroxy or carboxylic acid groups of compounds of formula I. The amino acid residues include the 20 naturally occurring amino acids commonly designated by three letter symbols and also include, 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, demosine, isodemosine, 3-methylhistidine, norvalin, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, citrulline, homocysteine, homoserine, omithine and methionine sulfone. Prodrugs also include compounds wherein carbonates, carbamates, amides and alkyl esters which are covalently bonded to the above substituents of formula I through the carbonyl carbon prodrug sidechain.<br>
This invention also encompasses compounds of formula I containing protective groups. One skilled in the art will also appreciate that compounds of the invention can also be prepared with certain protecting groups that are useful for purification or storage and can be removed before administration to a patient. The protection and deprotection of functional groups is described in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", edited by J.W.F. McOmie, Plenum Press (1973) and "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", 3rd edition, T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Wiley-lnterscience (1999).<br>
The compounds, salts and prodrugs of the present invention can exist in several tautomeric forms, including the enol and imine form, and the keto and enamine form and geometric isomers and mixtures thereof.

PHARMACOLOGICAL ANALYSIS<br>
Certain compounds such as benzoylbenzoyl adenosine triphosphate (bbATP) are known to be agonists of the P2X7 receptor, effecting the formation of pores in the plasma membrane (Drug Development Research (1996), 37(3). p. 126). Consequently, when the receptor is activated using bbATP in the presence of ethidium bromide (a fluorescent DNA probe), an increase in the fluorescence of intracellular DNA-bound ethidium bromide is observed. Alternatively, the propidium dye YOPRO-1 can be substituted for ethidium bromide so as to detect uptake of the dye. The increase in fluorescence can be used as a measure of P2X7 receptor activation and therefore to quantify the effect of a compound on the P2X7 receptor.<br>
In this manner, the compounds of the invention can be tested for antagonist activity at the P2X7 receptor. 96-Well flat bottomed microtitre plates are filled with 250 ul of test solution comprising 200 pi of a suspension of THP-1 cells (2.5 x 106 cells/ml, more preferably prestimulated as described in the literature with a combination of LPS and TNF to promote receptor expression) containing lO^M ethidium bromide, 25 ul of a high potassium, low sodium buffer solution (10mM Hepes, 150 mM KCI, 5 mM D-glucose and 1.0% FBS at pH 7.5) containing lO^M bbATP, ancL25 ul of the high potassium' buffer solution containing 3 x 10"5M test compound (more preferably 5 x 10""M, more preferably 1 x lO^M.more preferably 1 x 10"3M).   The plate is covered with a plastic sheet and incubated at 37°C for one hour. The plate is then read in a Perkin-Elmer fluorescent plate reader, excitation 520 nm, emission 595 nm, slit widths: Ex 15 nm, Em 20 nm.   For the purposes of comparison, bbATP (a P2X7 receptor agonist) and pyridoxal 5-phosphate (a P2X7 receptor antagonist) can be used separately in the test as controls.    From the readings obtained, a pICso figure can be calculated  for each  test compound,  this figure  being  the  negative  logarithm  of the concentration of test compound necessary to reduce the bbATP agonist activity by 50%.<br>
In like manner, the compounds of the invention can be tested for antagonist activity at the P2X7 receptor using the cytokine IL-1P as the readout. Blood collected from normal volunteers in the presence of heparin is fractionated using lymphocyte separation medium obtained from Organon Technica (Westchester, PA). The region of the resulting gradient containing banded mononuclear cells is harvested, diluted with 10 ml of Maintenance Medium (RPMI 1640, 5% FBS, 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 1% penicillin/streptomycin), and cells are collected by centrifugation. The resulting cell pellet was suspended in 10 ml of Maintenance Medium and a cell count was performed. In an average experiment, 2 x 10s mononuclear cells are seeded into each well of 96-well plates in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Monocytes are allowed to adhere for 2 hours, after which the supernatants are discarded and the attached cells are rinsed twice and then incubated in Maintenance Medium overnight at 37°C in a 5% CO2 environment.<br>
he cultured monocytes can be activated with 10 ng/ml LPS (E. coli serotype 055:65; Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO). Following a 2-hour incubation, the activation medium is removed, the cells are rinsed twice with 0.1 ml of Chase Medium (RPMI 1640, 1% FBS, 20 mM Hepes, 5 mM NaHCO3, pH 6.9), and then 0.1 ml of Chase Medium containing a test agent is added and the plate is incubated for 30 minutes; each test agent concentration can be evaluated in triplicate wells. ATP then is introduced (from a 100 mM stock solution, pH 7) to achieve a final concentration of 2 mM and the plate is incubated at 37°C for an additional 3 hours. Media were harvested and clarified by centrifugation, and their IL-1P content was determined by ELISA (R&amp;D Systems; Minneapolis, MN).<br>
