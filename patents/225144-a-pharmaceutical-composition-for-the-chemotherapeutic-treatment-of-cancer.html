				<td>PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION CONTAINING BREVIFOLIOL FOR<br>
USE IN CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC TREATMENT OF HUMAN BEINGS,<br>
METHOD THEREOF<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for the chemotherapeutic treatment<br>
of human beings using brevifoliol. More particularly, the present invention relates to<br>
the use of brevifoliol for the treatment human cancer lines. The present invention also<br>
relates to the bioactivity testing of taxanes from the leaves of Himalayan Yew tree<br>
Taxus wallichiana against human cancer cell lines grown in-vitro and subsequent<br>
identification of brevifoliol [1] as anticancer agent useful in the treatment of various<br>
types of cancer in humans. The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing brevifoliol and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for the<br>
chemotherapeutic treatment of human beings.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
In 1971, a novel compound isolated from the bark of the northwest Pacific<br>
yew tree, Taxus brevifolia Nutt. was described by Wani M.C. et al (in 1971,<br>
J.Am.Chem.Soc. 93, 2325-2327). This compound, named taxol (also known in the<br>
literature as paclitaxel) demonstrated moderate in vivo activity against the P-388, P-<br>
1534, and L-1210 murine leukaemia, the Walker 256 carcino-sarcoma, sarcoma 180,<br>
and Lewis lung tumor test systems. Taxol has a wide spectrum of anticancer activity.<br>
It has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration of United States in 1992<br>
for the treatment of ovarian cancer and again in 1994 for the treatment of breast<br>
cancers. It has also been found to be effective against leukemia, and cancer of the<br>
head, neck, endometrium and lungs. Recently, it has also been used to treat polycystic<br>
kidney disease which accounts for ten percent of the kidney transplant among the<br>
dialysis patients (Nature p.750,1994).<br>
In more than twenty years since the initial report of its isolation, structure<br>
elucidation, and bioactivity, taxol has garnered support as an anticancer agent,<br>
culminating in recent FDA approval of its use against breast and ovarian cancers.<br>
There are two main reasons for the attention directed toward this drug. First, it shows<br>
promise against refractory breast and ovarian cancers, which are difficult to treat and<br>
which are responsible for the deaths of 60,000 women every year (Chemical<br>
&amp;Engineering News 1991, (Sept.), 11-18). Second, it exhibits a mode of action, which<br>
is unique among cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Unlike known antimicrotubule<br>
agents, which block microtubule production, taxol promotes tubulin polymerisation<br>
and stabilizes microtubules against depolymerization (Schiff P.B., et al. 1979, Nature<br>
277, 665-667). Microtubules are important subcellular target for chemotherapeutic<br>
agents. Antimicrotubule agents, including the Vinca (Catharanthus) alkaloids, are<br>
extremely potent, requiring only a few molecules to disrupt the microtubular structure<br>
of cancer cells. The discovery of a new compound targeting these structures is of<br>
particular importance.<br>
Despite its promise, there is a problem with taxol. This highly functionalised<br>
diterpene is isolated from inner bark of relatively rare and slow growing Pacific yew<br>
tree Taxus brevifolia, and few related species in extremely small quantities (
dry wt) (Chemical &amp;Engineering News 1991, (Sept.), 11-18). Himalayan yew, Taxus<br>
wallichiana Zucc. is a tree or a large shrub distributed in the north temperate zone of<br>
the Indian subcontinent (The Wealth of India (1976), A dictionary of Indian raw<br>
materials and industrial products, Vol. X, CSIR publication, New Delhi, P. 132-134.).<br>
In contrast to the European yew (T. baccata Linn.), the Himalayan yew has a<br>
remarkable history of medicinal uses. The leaves of the Himalayan yew are used for<br>
treatment of hysteria, epilepsy, nervousness and as a lithic in calculus complaints<br>
while its non-poisonous fleshy arils have carminative, expectorant and stomachic<br>
properties (The Wealth of India (1976), p. 132-134). In addition to the above<br>
medicinal properties, Himalayan yew (Taxus wallichiana) also contains the potent<br>
anticancer drug taxol and its important precursor 10-deacetyl baccatin III (DAB).<br>
The currently practiced procedures for isolating taxol from bark have the<br>
disadvantages of being fatal to the source, being very difficult to carry out, and<br>
producing low yields. For example, (Vidensek et al 1990; Journal of Natural<br>
Products 53, 1609-1610) a 0.01% yield from a large-scale isolation starting with 806<br>
Ibs. or more of Taxus brevifolia bark has been reported. Similar procedures have been<br>
reported which comparably produce low yields, ranging from as low as 0.004%, up to<br>
about (but not above) 0.017%. A yield of 0.01% translates into 1 g being isolated<br>
from 10 kg of the bark, or 1 kg of taxol from 10,000 kg (approx.22,000 Ibs) of the<br>
bark. A mature tree is said to yield 20-25 Ibs. of bark, and this means that nearly 800-<br>
1000 trees are needed to produce a kilogram of taxol. Reported yields of taxol from<br>
various species of yew tree range from 50 mg/kg to 165 mg/kg (i.e., 0.005-0.017%).<br>
At present, bark of Taxus brevifolia is still being used as the major source of taxol.<br>
Because of (a) the low (0.01% or less) yields of taxol from the bark, (b) the relative<br>
unavailability of any other useful analogues, and (c) the need to cut the slow-growing<br>
trees to harvest the bark, it was decided that the bark was not an attractive source for<br>
taxol. Therefore, besides isolation from the bark, there are currently three avenues that<br>
are being pursued for the future production of taxol: (1) isolation from renewable<br>
plant parts, e.g., the ornamental yew clippings and needles; (2) semi-synthesis of<br>
taxol; (3) production of taxol by tissue culture procedures and (4) to find new taxanes<br>
from needles which are a renewable source of supply with anticancer properties.<br>
The aim of present invention was to isolate different types of taxanes other<br>
than taxol, from the leaves commonly called 'needles' of Taxus wallichiana and<br>
evaluate their anticancer potential. In the course of these investigations a taxane<br>
brevifoliol [1] was identified which showed promising anticancer activity against invitro<br>
grown human cancer cell lines.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a composition for the<br>
chemotherapeutic treatment of human beings.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a method for the<br>
chemotherapeutic treatment of human beings using brevifoliol, a taxane isolated from<br>
various Taxus species.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a method for the treatment of<br>
human cancer lines using brevifoliol, a taxane isolated from various Taxus species.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>

from leaves of Himalayan Yew tree Taxus •wallichiana against human cancer cell<br>
lines grown in-vitro and subsequent identification of brevifoliol [1] as anticancer<br>
agent useful in the treatment of various types of, cancer such as ovarian (PA-1), colon<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
As a part of the studies on the isolation of anticancer compounds a number of<br>
taxanes were isolated from the needles of the plant Taxus \vallichiana and tested for<br>
their anti-cancer properties against six human cancer cell lines in-vitro. The<br>
bioactivity testing was done at two stages. In the initial step, MTT assay was<br>
performed from which the inhibitory concentration (ICgo) the concentration (ug/mL)<br>
of the taxanes required for 90% inhibition of cell growth was deduced. Further, the<br>
compounds, which showed cell growth inhibitory activity was evaluated in the<br>
clonogenic assay. The MTT assay cannot discriminate between growth inhibition and<br>
cell death; it is an overall measurement of cell proliferation (Woerdenbag et al., 1993;<br>
J.Nat.Prod. 56 (6): 849-856). Therefore the IC90 data obtained by the MTT assay may<br>
overestimate the cell killing activity of a compound. Hence, the clonogenic assay for<br>
tumor cells which determines the actual cell death was performed to determine the<br>
cytotoxic potential of test compounds. Persons skilled in the art of anti-cancer drug<br>
discovery can perform both these assays.<br>
The data obtained in these bioassays against human cancer cells indicated that<br>
brevifoliol was highly inhibitory to ovarian (PA-1), colon (Caco-2), breast (MCF-7)<br>
and oral (KB-403) cancer cells where the IC90 values were comparatively similar or<br>
even less than that of standard drug 'taxol'. Thus brevifoliol can be used as cancer<br>
chemotherapeutic agent.<br>
Brevifoliol was first isolated from the leaves (also referred as 'needles') of the<br>
plant Taxus brevifolia (Balza et al Phytochemistry 30, p.1613-1614; 1991). The<br>
process of its isolation involved extracting the fresh leaves of Taxus wallichiana with<br>
ethyl alcohol to get an extract. The crude extract after concentration was diluted with<br>
water and partitioned between hexane, chloroform and ethyl acetate sequentially. The<br>
chloroform extract upon concentration yielded a dark brown residue. The resultant<br>
residue was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel and eluted with<br>
chloroform and chloroform-methanol gradient. Six fractions were collected and<br>
brevifoliol was isolated from fraction five by rechromatography over silica gel and<br>
eluting with hexane-ethyl acetate gradient.<br>
Brevifoliol has been isolated from other species of Taxus including the<br>
Himalayan yew tree Taxus wallichiana that is available in India. Recently, the<br>
structure of brevifoliol has been revised and it was shown to belong to 11 (15-1) abeo<br>
taxoid bicyclic skeleton of formula [1]. For this invention, brevifoliol was also<br>
isolated from the leaves of the plant following a process which involved extracting the<br>
dried and crushed needles of Taxus wallichiana with methanol for 72 hours and the<br>
extract was concentrated in vacua. The concentrate was diluted with water and<br>
extracted with hexane and chloroform respectively. Concentration of the chloroform<br>
phase under vacuum left a residue, which was separated by column chromatography<br>
over silica gel. Fraction eluted with chloroform-methanol (98:5) contained brevifoliol,<br>
which was further purified by rechromatography over silica gel and eluted with<br>
chloroform-methanol (99:2). Fractions containing brevifoliol were combined and<br>
concentrated and recrystallized from pet-ether and ethyl acetate mixture to get<br>
brevifoliol as needles (Chattopadhyay et al (1996) Indian J. Chemistry 35B, 175-177).<br>
The following examples further illustrate the invention and should not be<br>
construed as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example-1: In-vitro anticancer MTT assay<br>
The following six human cancer cell lines were procured from the Cell<br>
Repository of the National Center for Ce!! Sciences (NCCS) at Pune. Their<br>
corresponding ATCC No. and the organ from which they were isolated are also<br>
mentioned in Table 1 below:<br>
Cytotoxicity testing in vitro was done by the method of Woerdenbag et<br>
al.,1993; J.Nat.Prod. 56 (6): 849-856). 2xl03 cells/well were incubated in the 5%<br>
CO2 incubator for 24h to enable them to adhere properly to the 96 well polysterene<br>
microplate (Grenier, Germany). Test compounds dissolved in 100% DMSO<br>
(Merck,Germany) in at least five doses were added and left for 6h after which the<br>
compound plus media was replaced with fresh media and the cells were incubated for<br>
another 48h in the CO2 incubator at 37°C. The concentration of DMSO used in our<br>
experiments never exceeded 1.25%, which was found to be non-toxic to cells. Then,<br>
10 [i\ MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetiazolium bromide; Sigma M<br>
2128] was added, and plates were incubated at 37°C for 4 h. 100 ul dimethyl sulfoxide<br>
(DMSO, Merck, Germany) were added to all wells and mixed thoroughly to dissolve<br>
the dark blue crystals. After a few minutes at room temperature to ensure that all<br>
crystals were dissolved, the plates were read on a SpectraMax 190 Microplate Elisa<br>
reader (Molecular Devices Inc., USA), at 570 nm. Plates were normally read within 1<br>
h of adding the DMSO. The experiment was done in triplicate and the inhibitory<br>
concentration (1C) values were calculated as follows: % inhibition =[1-OD (570 nm)<br>
of sample well / OD (570 nm) of control well] x 100. IC90 is the concentration ug/mL<br>
required for 90% inhibition of cell growth as compared to that of untreated control.<br>
The results described in Table 2 indicate that brevifoliol is active against all cancer<br>
cell lines except liver cancer (WRL-68).<br>
ExampIe-2: Soft Agar Assay For Colony Formation<br>
The clonogenic assay for tumor cells which determines the actual cell death<br>
was performed to determine the cytotoxic potential of test compounds. The principle<br>
of clonogenic assay is to investigate the ability of an individual cell to form a colony<br>
on a soft agar plate containing various concentrations of test compounds.<br>
Cells not able to form colonies are considered clonogenically dead (Beekman<br>
et al 1997; J.Nat.Prod. 60(4): 325-330). The concentration of test compound resulting<br>
in 90 % of the control (untreated) colonies was denoted as ICgo and was used as a<br>
parameter for cytotoxicity. The assay was performed as described previously except<br>
that the test compounds were added into the top soft agar and the cells were plated out<br>
to form colonies. Anthracycline derivative doxorubicin and microtubule<br>
depolymerization inhibitor paclitaxel (Sigma Chem. Co., St. Loius, USA) both<br>
established anticancer agents were included as standard reference drugs.<br>
(Table Remove) Example 3: Chemical Process for the Isolation of Brevifoliol<br>
Dried and crushed needles of Taxus wallichiana ( 1 kg) were extracted with<br>
methanol (3x3L) for 72 hours and concentrated in vacuo. The concentrate was diluted<br>
with water and extracted with hexane (1L) and chloroform (1L) respectively.<br>
Concentration of the chloroform phase under vacuum left a residue (12g), which was<br>
separated by column chromatography over silica gel. Fraction eluted with chloroformmethanol<br>
(95:5) contained brevifoliol, which was further purified by rechromatography<br>
over silica gel and eluted with chloroform-methanol (98:2). Fractions<br>
containing brevifoliol were concentrated under vacuum and brevifoliol was obtained<br>
as amorphous solids, (50 mg).<br>
Brevifoliol was crystallized from petroleum ether-acetone mixture as needles.<br>
Brevifoliol, mp 200-201°C, [x]D-25°C (c 1, MeOH) was characterized on the basis of<br>
its reported spectral data and by direct comparison with an authentic sample<br>
(Chattopadhyay, S.K. et al, Indian J. Chemistry 35B, 175-177 (1996)).<br>
