				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
The present invention relates to a food intake restriction apparatus for an obese patient, comprising a restriction device implantable in the patient for engaging the stomach or esophagus, to form a restricted stoma opening in the stomach or esophagus, the restriction device being operable to change the restriction of the stoma opening. The term "patient" includes an animal or a human being.<br>
Food intake restriction apparatus in the form of a gastric banding device, in which a band encircles a portion of a patient7 s stomach to restrict the food intake of the patient, have been used in surgery for morbid obesity to form a small gastric pouch above the band and a reduced stoma opening in the stomach. Although such a band is applied around the stomach to obtain an optimal stoma opening during surgery, some prior gastric banding devices are provided with an adjustment means enabling a minor post-operation adjustment of the size of the stoma opening. In all such prior art devices such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4592339, European Patent No. 0611561 and International Patent Application WO 94/27504, the adjustment means typically comprises an inflatable cavity in the band and an injection port in fluid connection with the inflatable cavity for adding fluid to or withdrawing fluid from the latter. In practice, the band is made of silicone rubber which is a material approved for implantation and the fluid is a liquid such as an isotonic salt solution.<br><br>
It has also been found that the volume of the gastric pouch above the band increases in size up to ten times after operation- Therefore the pouch volume during surgery needs to be very small, approximately 7 ml. To enable the patient to feed the stomach with sufficient nutrition immediately after an operation considering such a small gastric pouch, the stoma initially needs to be relatively large and latex needs to be substantially reduced, as the pouch volume increases- To be able to achieve a significant range of adjustment of the band, the cavity in the band has to be relatively large and is defined by a thin flexible wall, normally made of silicone material. Furthermore, the size of the stoma opening has to be gradually reduced during the first year after surgery as the gastric pouch increases in size. As indicated above, the reduction of the stoma opening using the prior art devices is achieved by adding liquid to the cavity of the band via the injection port to expand the band radially inwardly.<br>
A great disadvantage of repeatedly injecting liquid via the injection port is the increased risk of the patient getting an infection in the body area surrounding the injection port. If such an infection occurs the injection port has to be surgically removed from the patient. Moreover, such an infection might be spread along the tube interconnecting the injection port and the band to the stomach, causing even more serious complications. Thus, the stomach might be infected where it is in contact with the band, which might result in the band migrating through the wall of the stomach. Also, it is uncomfortable for the patient when the necessary, often many, post-operation adjustments of the stoma opening are carried out using an injection needle penetrating the skin of the patient into the injection port.<br>
It may happen that the patient swallows pieces of food<br><br>
too large to pass through the restricted stoma opening. If that occurs the patient has to visit a doctor who can remove the food pieces, if the band design so permits, by withdrawing some liquid from the band to enlarge the stoma opening to allow the food pieces to pass the stoma. Then, 'the doctor has to add liquid to the band in order to regain the restricted stoma opening. Again, these measures require the use of an injection needle penetrating the skin of the patient, which is uncomfortable for the patient.<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a food intake restriction apparatus for forming a stoma opening in the stomach or esophagus of a patient which permits post-operation adjustments that are comfortable for the patient.<br>
Another obj ect of the present invention is to provide a new food intake restriction apparatus for forming a stoma opening in the stomach "or esophagus of a patient which is easy to adjust and does not require the use of an injection needle for accomplishing post-operation adjustments of the stoma opening.<br>
This object is obtained by an apparatus of the kind stated initially characterised by an energy transmission device for wireless transmission of energy from outside the patient's body to inside the patient's body for use in connection with the operation of the restriction device including to enlarge or restrict the stoma opening, when the restriction device is implanted.<br>
As a result, the advantage is achieved that the food intake restriction apparatus of the invention provides simple and effective energy transmission which ensures an extended and reliable functionality of the apparatus, possibly for the rest of the patient's natural life, and at least many years.<br><br>
The restriction device preferably controls the size of the stoma opening in the stomach or esophagus, wh:i.ch gives the advantage that the patient is enabled to adjust the size of the stoma opening if needed. This advantage should not be underestimated, because if pieces of food get ;5tuck in the stoma opening it would be very difficult for tha patient to remove the food pieces if the patient were unable to enlarge the stoma opening.<br>
Generally, the apparatus comprises an energy transforming device implantable in the patient for transforming the energy wirelessly transmitted by the energy transmission device from a first form into a second form, preferably different than the first form.<br>
The energy transforming device may comprise at least one semiconductor type of component or a circuitry of such semiconductor components. The semiconductor component may comprise, a transistor or microchip or similar -electronic components. However, the semiconductor component may not comprise rectifying diodes.<br>
In accordance with a main embodiment of the invention, the energy transforming device comprises at least one element having a positive region and a negative region and adapted to create an energy field between the positive and negative regions when exposed to the' energy of the first form transmitted by the energy transmission device, so that the energy field provides the energy of the second form Typically, the above-mentioned semiconductor component may include such an element.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the element comprises an electrical junction element capable of inducing an electric field between the positive and negative regions when exposed to the energy of<br><br>
the first form transmitted by the energy transmission device, whereby the energy of the second form comprises electric energy.<br>
Consequently, the restriction device suitably is electrically operated, whereby the positive- and negative regions of the electrical junction element supply electric energy for the operation of the restriction device. The apparatus suitably comprises implantable electric conductors connected to the positive and negative regions of the electrical junction element, whereby the electrical junction element is capable of supplying an electric current, such as a direct current, a pulsating direct current, a combination of a direct and pulsating direct current, an alternating current or a combination of a direct and alternating current, via the conductors, Furthermore, the electrical junction element may be capable of supplying a frequency, amplitude, or frequency and amplitude modulated analog, digital, or a combination of analog and digital signal, which is used in connection with control of the restriction device.<br>
The element, preferably in the form of an electrical semiconductor junction element, should be designed to generate an output current exceeding 1  when exposed to the energy of the first form transmitted by the energy transmission device. Suitably the electrical junction element forms a flat and thin sheet and has a volume of less than 2000 cm3 to be suited for subcutaneous implantation, so that the electrical junction element can be located just behind the skin of the patient. Alternatively, it would be possible to implant the element in the thorax or cephalic region of the patient, or in an orifice of the patient' s body and under the mucosa or intraluminar outside the mucosa of the orifice. Of course, all the components of the energy transforming device including the<br><br>
electrical junction element in contact with the patient's body should be of biocompatible material.<br>
For in vitro appliances, a particular type of an electrical semiconductor j unction element has been commonly used, namely a so-called p-n (positive/negative) junction element, typically in the form of solar cells, A solar cell transfers solar energy in the form of visible light into electric energy in the form of direct current. For example, a p-n junction element may comprise two layers of semiconductor, one p-type (positive) and the other n-type (negative), sandwiched together to form a "p-n junction". This p-n junction induces an electric field across the element when absorbing quanta of light (photons) •<br>
To be more precise, the quanta of light transfer their energy to some of the semiconductor's electrons, which are then able to move about through the material. For each such negatively charged electron, a corresponding positive charge -a "hole" - is created. In an ordinary semiconductor, these electrons and holes recombine after a short time and their energy is wasted as heat. However, when the electrons and holes are swept across the p-n junction in opposite directions by the action of the electric field, the separation of charge induces a voltage across the p-n junction element. By connecting the p-n junction element to an external circuit, the electrons are able to flow thereby creating a current.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been proved that although both the skin and subcutis absorb energy from an external light beam directed, against the skin portion behind which a properly designed p-n junction element is located, the light energy transmitted through the skin can induce a current from the p-n junction element strong enough (minimum 1 μA) to enable the operation of the electrically operated restriction device.<br><br>
Thus, such a p-n junction element is now for the first time used for in vivo applications.<br>
The apparatus may comprise an implantable pulse generator for generating electrical pulses from the energy of the second form produced by the energy field.<br>
Generally, the energy transforming device is adapted to transform the energy of the first form directly or indirectly into the energy of the second form.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the energy of the second form comprises electric energy and the energy transforming device comprises a capacitor, which may be adapted to produce electric pulses from the transformed electric energy. Preferably, the capacitor may be adapted to produce the pulses as the energy transforming device transforms the energy of the first form transmitted by the energy transmission device into the electric energy of the second form. The capacitor should be small to facilitate implantation thereof; i.e. its capacity<br>
may not be more than 0,1 JIF.<br>
The apparatus may comprise an implantable stabiliser for stabilising the energy of the second form. Where the energy of the second form comprises electric current the stabiliser may comprise at least one capacitor of the type described above.<br>
In most embodiments of the invention, the apparatus comprises implantable electrical components. Where the electrical components include a capacitor of the type described above or an accumulator, at least one, preferably a single, voltage level guard • may advantageously be provided, wherein the charge and discharge of the capacitor or accumulator is controlled by use of the voltage level guard. As a result, there is no need for any implanted current detector and/or charge level detector for the control of the<br><br>
capacitor, which makes the apparatus simple and reliable.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention, the wireless energy of the first form comprises sound waves and the energy of the second form comprises electric energy, wherein the energy transforming device is adapted to directly transform the sound waves into electric energy.<br>
The apparatus may comprise an implantable motor or pump for operating the restriction device, wherein the motor or pump is powered by the transformed energy.<br>
In accordance with a main aspect of the invention, the energy transmission device may be adapted to transmit wireless energy for direct use in connection with the operation of the restriction device, as the wireless energy is being transmitted. The advantage of directly using energy as it is transmitted is that the apparatus can be of a very simple design and the few components involved makes the apparatus extremely reliable. -For example, the energy transmission device may be adapted to directly power the motor or pump with wireless energy. The wireless energy may comprise a magnetic field or electromagnetic waves, suitably in the form of a signal, for direct power of the motor or pump. All the various functions of the motor and associated components described in the present specification may be'used where applicable.<br>
As an alternative to the above-noted main aspect of the invention, the energy transforming device may be adapted to supply the energy of the second form for direct use in connection with the operation of the restriction device, as the energy of the first form is being transformed into the energy of the second form. Consequently, the energy transforming device may be adapted to directly power the motor or pump with the energy of the second form.<br>
Generally,  the  energy  transforming  device  directly<br><br>
operates the restriction device with the energy of the second form in a non-magnetic, non-thermal or non-mechanical manner.<br>
Where the apparatus comprises a motor, which may be adapted to directly or intermittently operate the restriction device, the energy transforming device may power the motor with the energy of the second form. Suitably, the restriction device is operable to perform a reversible function and the motor is capable of reversing said function.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the restriction device comprises a hydraulic restriction device, and the apparatus comprises an implantable pump for operating the hydraulic restriction device, wherein the energy transforming device supplies the energy of the second form for driving the pump - Preferably, the pump is not a plunger type of pump, but may comprise a peristaltic or membrane pump.<br>
The energy transforming device preferably is capable of generating as the energy of the second form a current exceeding 1 |iA, when transferring the energy of the first form transmitted by the energy transmission device.<br>
The apparatus may comprise an implantable adjustment device for adjusting the restriction device to change the restriction of the food passageway. In accordance with a first alternative the adjustment device is adapted to mechanically adjust the restriction device. In accordance with a second alternative the adjustment device is adapted to hydraulically adjust the restriction device by using implanted hydraulic means. Such hydraulic means may not use hydraulic fluid of the kind having a viscosity that substantially increases when exposed to heat or a magnetic field.<br>
The apparatus of the present invention is not limited to the use of visible light for the wireless transmission of energy.  Thus,  in accordance with a broad aspect of the<br><br>
invention, the energy transmission device transmits energy by at least one wireless signal, preferably containing radiant energy.<br>
The wireless signal may comprises a wave signal, for example an electromagnetic wave signal, such as an infrared 5 light signal, a visible light signal, an ultra violet light signal, a laser signal, a micro wave signal, a radio wave signal, an x-ray radiation signal, and a gamma radiation signal. Where applicable, one or more of the above signals may be combined. Alternatively, the wave signal may comprise a sound wave signal, such as an ultrasonic signal ♦ Generally, l the wireless signal may comprise a digital, analog or a digital and analog signal.<br>
The energy of the first form transmitted by the energy transmission device may comprise an electric or magnetic field transmitted in pulses, for example digital pulses. Furthermore, the energy transforming device may transform the ; energy of the first form, which may comprise polarised energy, into a direct current, pulsating direct current, a combination of a direct and pulsating direct current, an alternating current or a combination of a direct and alternating current. Alternatively, the energy of the first form may comprise kinetic energy.<br>
The energy of the second form may comprise a frequency* amplitude or frequency and amplitude modulated analog, digital or combined analog and digital signal.<br>
The restriction device may be non-inflatable, i.e. with no hydraulic fluid involved for the adjustments of the restriction device. This eliminates problems with fluid leaking from the restriction device.<br>
The apparatus suitably comprises implantable electric conductors  connected  to  the  energy  transforming  device,<br><br>
whereby the energy transforming device is capable of supplying an electric current, such as direct current, a pulsating direct current, a combination of a direct and pulsating direct current, an alternating current or a combination of a direct and alternating current, via the conductors. Furthermore, the energy transforming device may be capable of supplying a frequency, amplitude, or frequency and amplitude modulated analog, digital, or a combination of analog and digital signal, which is used in connection with control of the restriction device.<br>
In accordance with a main embodiment of the invention, the apparatus comprises an implantable operation device for operating the restriction device and a control device for controlling the operation device, wherein the energy transforming device powers the operation device with the energy of the second form. The operation device preferably comprises a motor, for example an electric linear motor or an electric rotary motor that is controlled by the control device to rotate a desired number of revolutions. Optionally, an implantable gearing may be connected to the motor. The electric motor may have electrically conductive parts made of plastics. Alternatively, the motor .may comprise a hydraulic or pneumatic fluid motor, wherein the control device controls the fluid flow through the fluid motor. Motors currently available on the market are getting smaller and smaller. Furthermore, there is a great variety of control methods and miniaturised control equipment available. For example, the number of revolutions of a rotary motor may be analysed by a Hall-element just a few mm in size.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the restriction device comprises hydraulic means and the operation device is adapted to conduct a hydraulic fluid in<br><br>
tne nyaraulic means. The operation device comprises a fluid conduit connected to the hydraulic means of the restriction device, and a reservoir for fluid, wherein the reservoir forms part of the conduit. The reservoir may form a fluid chamber with a variable volume, and the operation device may be adapted to distribute fluid from the chamber to the hydraulic means of the restriction device by reduction of the volume of the chamber and to withdraw fluid from the hydraulic means to the chamber by expansion of the volume of the chamber. The operation device suitably comprises an implantable motor used for reducing and expanding the volume of the chamber. Also, the operation device may comprise a pump for pumping the hydraulic fluid in the hydraulic means of the restriction device. All of the hydraulic components involved are preferably devoid of any non-return valve. This is of great advantage, because with valves involved there is always a risk of malfunction due to improperly working valves, especially when long time periods passes between valve operations.<br>
The control device may be adapted to reverse the operation device by shifting polarity of the energy of the second form. Where the operation device comprises an electric motor the energy of the second form suitably comprises electric energy.<br>
In accordance with yet another embodiment of the invention, the restriction device is operable to perform a reversible function, such as enlarging and restricting the food passageway, and there is a reversing device implanted in the patient for reversing the function performed by the restriction device. Such a reversing function preferably involves enlarging and restricting the food passageway by the restriction device, suitably in a stepless manner. In this connection, the control device suitably controls the reversing<br><br>
device, which may include a switch, to reverse the function performed by the restriction device. The reversing device may comprise hydraulic means including a valve for shifting the flow direction of a fluid in the hydraulic means. Alternatively, the reversing device may comprise a mechanical reversing device, such as a switch or a gearbox.<br>
Where the reversing device comprises a switch it may be operable by the energy of the second form. In this case, the control device suitably controls the operation of the switch by shifting polarity of the energy of the second form supplied to the switch. The switch may comprise an electric switch and the source of energy may supply electric energy for the operation of the switch.<br>
In accordance with an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the apparatus further comprises an energy storage device implanted in the patient for storing the energy of the second form and for supplying energy in connection with the operation of the restriction device. The implanted energy storage device preferably comprises an electric source of energy, such as an accumulator, a rechargeable battery or a combination of an accumulator and rechargeable battery.<br>
The apparatus may further comprise a switch implantable in the patient for switching the operation of the restriction device and a source of energy implantable in the patient. This embodiment is particularly suited for applications where the energy transmission efficiency of the apparatus is insufficient, i.e. where the implanted restriction device is to perform more advanced operations. Such a source of energy preferably is a battery. Alternatively, the source of energy is an accumulator that also may store the energy of the second form.<br>
In accordance with a first alternative, the switch is<br><br>
operated by the energy of the second form supplied by the energy storage device to switch from an off mode, in which the source of energy is not in use, to an on mode, in which the source of energy, supplies energy for the operation of the restriction device. In this case, the implanted source of energy may comprise a'battery, preferably having a lifetime of at least 10 years, or an accumulator. However, other kinds of sources are also conceivable, such as a nuclear source of energy or a chemical source of energy (fuel cells) .<br>
In accordance with a second alternative, the apparatus further comprises a remote control for controlling the supply of energy of the implanted source of energy, wherein the switch is operated by the energy of the second form supplied by the energy storage device to switch from an off mode, in which the remote control is prevented from controlling the source of energy and the source of energy is not in use, to a standby mode, in which the remote control is permitted to control the source of energy to supply energy for the operation of the restriction device.<br>
In accordance with a third alternative, the energy storage device is omitted, wherein the switch is operated by the energy of the second form- supplied by the energy transforming device to switch from an off mode, in which the remote control is prevented from controlling the source of energy and the source of energy is not in use, to a standby mode, in which the remote control is permitted to control the source of energy to supply energy for the operation of the restriction device.<br>
In accordance with a fourth alternative, also the remote control is omitted, wherein the switch is operated by the energy of the second form supplied by the energy transforming device to switch from an off mode, in which the source of<br><br>
energy is not in use, to an on mode, in which the source of energy supplies energy for the operation of the restriction device. Where applicable, in the described embodiments the switch may switch when the energy transmission device is transmitting wireless energy, preferably while the transferred energy of the second form is stabilised by an implanted capacitor, which may temporarily (for a few seconds) store the energy of the second form.<br>
In the above noted third and fourth alternatives, the energy transmission device may be substituted for the energy transforming device, whereby the switch is operated by the energy of the first form.<br>
The switch mentioned above may comprise an electronic switch or, where applicable, a mechanical switch.<br>
The advantage of using a switch above all is increased control safety; i.e. interfering signals in the patient's surroundings cannot affect the implanted restriction device. Furthermore, the lifetime of the implanted source of energy will be significantly prolonged, since the energy consumption of the apparatus will be reduced to a minimum. During the above-mentioned standby mode, the remote control uses energy from the implanted source of energy. By means of the energy transmission device energy may be transmitted to activate the switch to connect the implanted source of energy only when energy is required in connection with the operation of the restriction device.<br>
All of the above embodiments may be combined with at least one implantable sensor for sensing at least one physical parameter of the patient, wherein the control device may control the restriction device in response to signals from the sensor. For example, the sensor may comprise a pressure sensor for directly or indirectly sensing the pressure against the<br><br>
restriction device or in the food passageway. Alternatively, the sensor may comprise o position sensor for sensing when the patient is lying. The control device may comprise an internal control unit implanted in the patient for, preferably directly, controlling the restriction device in response to signals from the sensor. In response to signals from the sensor, for example pressure, the patient's position or any other important physical parameter, the internal control unit may send information thereon to outside the patient's body. The control unit may also automatically control the restriction device in response to signals from the sensor. For example, the control unit may control the restriction device to enlarge the food passageway in response to the sensor sensing that the patient is lying, or enlarge the food passageway in response to the sensor sensing an abnormally high pressure against the restriction device.<br>
Alternatively, the control device may comprise an external control unit outside the patient's body for, suitably directly, controlling the restriction device in response to signals from the sensor. The externalT control unit may store information on the physical parameter sensed by the sensor and may be manually operated to control the restriction device based on the stored information. In addition, there may be at least one implantable sender for sending information on the physical parameter sensed by the sensor.<br>
An external data communicator may be provided outside the patient's body and an internal data communicator may be implanted in the patient, for communicating with the external communicator. The internal communicator may feed data related to the patient, or related to the restriction device, back to the external communicator. Alternatively or in combination, the external communicator may feed data to the internal<br><br>
communicator. The internal communicator may suitably feed data related to at least one physical signal of the patient.<br>
The apparatus may further comprise an implantable programmable control unit for controlling the restriction device, preferably over time in accordance with an activity schedule program. This will advance the apparatus and make possible an adaptation of the apparatus to the individual patients.<br>
Many of the above embodiments are suitably remote controlled. Thus, the apparatus advantageously comprises a wireless remote control transmitting at least one wireless control signal for controlling the restriction device. With such a remote control it will be possible to adapt the function of the apparatus to the patient' s need in a daily basis, which is beneficial with respect to the treatment of the patient. The control signal may comprise a frequency, amplitude or frequency or amplitude modulated signal. Furthermore, the control signal may comprise an analog or a digital signal, or a combination of an analog and digital signal.<br>
The wireless remote control may be capable of obtaining information on the condition of . the implanted restriction device and of controlling the restriction device in response to the information. Also, The remote control may be capable of sending information related to the restriction device from inside the patient's body to the outside thereof.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention, the wireless remote control comprises at least one - external signal transmitter or transceiver and at least one internal signal receiver or transceiver implantable in the patient. In another particular embodiment of the invention, the wireless remote control comprises at least one external signal receiver or<br><br>
transceiver and at least one internal signal transceiver implantable in the patient.<br><br>
The wireless remote control may transmit a carrier signal for carrying the control signal, wherein the carrier signal is frequency, amplitude or frequency and amplitude modulated. The carrier signal may also comprise digital, analog or a combination of digital and analog signals. Such signals may comprise wave signals. Also the control signal used with the carrier signal may be frequency, amplitude or frequency and amplitude modulated, and be digital, analog or combined digital and analog.<br>
The control signal may comprise a wave signal, for example, a sound wave signal, such as an ultrasound wave signal, an electromagnetic wave signal, such as an infrared light signal, a visible light signal, an ultra violet light signal, a laser signal, a micro wave signal, a radio wave signal, an x-ray radiation signal, or a gamma radiation signal. Where applicable, two or more of the above signals may be combined.<br>
The control signal may be digital or analog, and may comprise an electric or magnetic field. Suitably, the wireless remote control may transmit an electromagnetic carrier wave signal for carrying the digital or analog control signal. For example, use of an analog carrier wave signal carrying a digital control signal would give safe communication. The control signal may be transmitted in pulses by the wireless remote control.<br>
The energy transmission device may function different from or similar to the energy transforming device.

Thus, in FIGURE 1 all parts placed to the right of the patient' s skin 2 are implanted and all parts placed to the left of the skin 2 are located outside the patient's body.<br>
The apparatus of FIGURE 1 comprises an implanted operable restriction device 4, which engages the patient's stomach close to the cardia (or alternatively engages the esophagus) to form a restricted stoma opening in the stomach. The restriction device 4 is capable of performing a reversible function, i.e. to enlarge and reduce the stoma opening. An implanted energy transforming device 6 is adapted to supply energy consuming components of the restriction device 4 with energy via a power supply line 12. An external energy transmission device 10 includes a wireless remote control transmitting a wireless signal, which is received by a signal receiver incorporated in the implanted energy transforming device 6. The implanted energy transforming device 6 transforms energy from the signal into electric energy which is supplied via the power supply line 12 to the restriction device 4, which energy causes portions of the device 4 to move and thus adjust the stoma opening.<br>
FIGURE 2 shows an embodiment of the invention identical to that of FIGURE 1, except that a reversing device in the form of an electric switch 14 also is implanted in the patient for reversing the restriction device 4. The wireless remote control of the external energy transmission device 10 transmits a wireless signal that carries energy and the implanted energy transforming device 6 transforms the wireless energy into a current for operating the switch 14. When the<br><br>
polarity of the current is shifted by the energy transforming device 6 the switch 14 reverses the function performed by the restriction device 4.<br>
FIGURE 3 shows an embodiment of the invention identical to that of FIGURE 1, except that an operation' device in the form of a motor 15 for operating the restriction device 4 also is implanted in the patient.

FIGURE 4 shows an embodiment of the invention identical to that of FIGURE 1, except that an assembly 16 including a motor/pump unit 18 and a fluid reservoir 20 also is implanted in the patient. In this case the restriction device 4 is hydraulically operated, i.e. hydraulic fluid is pumped by the motor/pump unit 18 from the reservoir 20 through a conduit 22 to the restriction device 4 to reduce the size of the stoma opening, and hydraulic fluid is pumped by the motor/pump unit 18 back from the restriction device 4 to the reservoir 20 to enlarge the stoma opening. The implanted energy transforming device unit 6 transforms wireless energy into a current for powering the motor/pump unit 18 via an electric power supply line 24.<br>
FIGURE 5 shows an embodiment of the invention comprising the external energy transmission device 10 with its wireless remote control, the restriction device 4, in this case hydraulically operated, and the implanted energy transforming device 6, and further comprising an implanted hydraulic fluid reservoir 3 0, an implanted mot or/pump unit 32 and an implanted reversing device in the form of a hydraulic valve shifting device 34. The motor of the motor/pump unit 32 is an electric<br><br>
motor. In .response to a control signal from the wireless remote control of the external energy transmission device 10, the implanted energy transforming device 6 powers the motor/pump unit 32 with energy from the energy carried by the control signal, whereby the motor/pump unit 32 distributes hydraulic fluid between the reservoir 3 0 and the restriction device 4. The remote control of the energy transmission device 10 controls the shifting device 34 to shift the hydraulic fluid flow direction between one direction in which the fluid is pumped by the motor/pump unit 32 from the reservoir 3 0 to the restriction device 4 to reduce the size of the stoma opening, and another opposite direction in which the fluid is pumped by the motor/pump unit 32 back from the restriction device 4 to the reservoir 3 0 to enlarge the stoma opening.<br>
FIGURE 6 shows an embodiment of the invention identical to that of FIGURE 1, except that a control unit 3 6 controlled by the wireless remote control of the external energy transmission device 10, an accumulator 38 and a capacitor 40 also are implanted in the patient. The control unit 3 6 stores electric energy received from the energy transforming device 6 in the accumulator 38, which supplies energy to the restriction device 4- In response to a control signal from the wireless remote control of the energy transmission device 10, the control unit 6 either releases electric energy from the accumulator 38 and transforms the released energy via power lines 42 and 44, or directly transforms electric energy from the energy transforming device 6 via a power line 46, the capacitor 40, which stabilizes the electric current, a power line 48 and the power line 44, for the operation of the restriction device 4.<br>
In accordance with one alternative, the capacitor 40 in the embodiment of FIGURE 6 may be omitted. In accordance with<br><br>
another alternative, the accumulator 38 in this embodiment may be omitted.<br>
FIGURE 7 shows an embodiment of the invention identical to that of FIGURE 1, except that a battery 50 for supplying energy for the operation of the restriction device 4 and an electric switch 52 ' for switching the operation of the restriction device 4 also are implanted in the patient. The switch 52 is operated by the energy supplied by the energy transforming device 6 to switch from.an off mode, in which the battery 50 is not in use, to an on mode, in which the battery 50 supplies energy for the operation of the restriction device 4,<br>
FIGURE 8 shows an embodiment of the invention identical to that of FIGURE 7, except that a control unit 36 controllable by the wireless remote control of the external energy transmission device 10 also is implanted in the patient. In this case, the switch 52 is operated by the energy supplied by the energy transforming device 6 to switch from an off mode, in which the wireless remote control is prevented from controlling the control unit 36 and the battery is not in use, to a standby mode, in which the remote control is permitted to control the control unit 36 to release electric energy from the battery 50 for the operation of the restriction device 4.<br>
FIGURE 9 shows an embodiment of the invention identical to that of FIGURE 8, except that an accumulator 38 is substituted for the battery 50 and the implanted components are interconnected differently. In thj s case, the accumulator 38 stores energy from the energy transforming device 6. In response to a control signal from the wireless remote control of the external energy transmission device 10, the implanted control unit 36 controls the switch 52 to switch from an off<br><br>
mode, in which the accumulator 3 8 is not in use, to an on mode, in which the accumulator 3 8 supplies energy for the operation of the restriction device 4.<br>
FIGURE 10 shows an embodiment of the invention identical to that of FIGURE 9, except that a battery 50 also is implanted in the patient and the implanted components are interconnected differently. In response to a control signal from the wireless remote control of the external energy transmission device 10, the implanted control unit 36 controls the accumulator 3 8 to deliver energy for operating the switch 52 to switch from an off mode, in which the battery 50 is not in use, to an on mode, in which the battery 50 supplies electric energy for the operation of the restriction device 4.<br>
Alternatively, the switch 52 may be operact the food intake of the patient, have been used in surgery for morbid obesity to form a small gastric pouch above the band and a reduced stoma opening in the stomach. Although such a band is applied around the stomach to obtain an optimal stoma opening during surgery, some prior gastric banding devices are provided with an adjustment means enabling a minor post-operation adjustment of the size of the stoma opening. In all such prior art devices such as disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 4592339, European Paevice in the form of a gearbox 54 and a control unit 36 for controlling the gearbox 54 also are implanted in the patient. The implanted control unit 3 6 controls the gearbox 54 to reverse the function performed by the restriction device 4 (mechanically operated).<br>
FIGURE 12 shows an embodiment of the invention identical to that of FIGURE 10 except that the implanted components are interconnected differently. Thus, in this case the control unit 36 is powered by the battery 50 when the accumulator 38,n size up to ten times after operation. Therefore the pouch<br><br>
volume during surgery needs to be very small, approximately 7 ml- To enable the patient to feed the stomach with sufficient nutrition immediately after an operation considering such a small gastric pouch, the stoma initially needs to be relatively large and later needs to be substantially reduced, as the pouch volume increases. To be able to achieve a significant range of adjustment of the band, the cavity in the band has to be relatively large and and the external energy transmission device 10 including the external wireless remote control. As already described above the wireless remote control transmits a control signal which is received by the implanted control unit 36, which in turn controls the various implanted components of the apparatus.<br>
A sensor 56 may be implanted in the patient for sensing a physical parameter of the patient, such as the pressure in the stomach. The implanted control unit 3 6, or alternatively the external wireless remote control of the energy transmission device 10, may control the restriction device 4 in response to signals from the sensor 56. A transceiver may be combined with the sensor 56 for sending information on the sensed physical parameter to the external wireless remote control. The wireless remote control may comprise a signal transmitter or transceiver and the implanted control unit 36 may comprise a signal receiver or transceiver. Alternatively, the wireless remote control may comprise a signal receiver or transceiver and the implanted control unit 36 may comprise a signal transmitter or transceiver. The above transceivers, transmitters and receivers may be used for sending information or data related to the restriction device 4 from inside the patient's body to the outside thereof.<br>
Where the motor /pump unit 18 and battery 50 for powering the motor /pump unit 18 are implanted, the battery 50 may be<br><br>
equipped with a tranceiver for sending information on the condition of the battery 50.<br>
Those skilled in the. art will realize that the above various embodiments according to FIGURES 1-13 could be combined in many different ways. For example, the energy operated switch 14 could be incorporated in any of the embodiments of FIGURES 3,6-12, the hydraulic shifting device 34 could be incorporated in the embodiment of FIGURE 4, and the gear box 54 could be incorporated in the embodiment of FIGURE 3.<br>
FIGURE 14 shows an energy transforming device in the form of an electrical junction element 58 for use in any of the above embodiments according to FIGURES 1-13. The element 58 is a flat p-n junction element comprising a p-type semiconductor layer 60 and an n-type semiconductor layer 62 sandwiched together. A light bulb 64 is electrically connected to opposite sides of the element 58 to illustrate how the generated current is obtained. The output of current from such a p-n junction element 58 is correlated to the temperature. See the formula below.<br>
I = 10 (exp(qV/kT)-l)<br>
where<br>
I is the external current flow,<br>
10 is the reverse saturation current,<br>
q is the fundamental electronic charge of 1.602 x 10-19 coulombs,<br>
V is the applied voltage,<br>
k is the Boltzmann constant, and<br>
T is the absolute temperature.<br>
Under large negative applied voltage (reverse bias), the exponential term becomes negligible compared to 1.0, and I is approximately  -10.    10  is  strongly  dependent  on  the<br><br>
temperature of the junction and hence on the intrinsic-carrier concentration. 10 is larger for materials with smaller bandgaps than for those with larger bandgaps. The rectifier action of the diode , that is, its restriction of current flow to only one direction , is in this particular embodiment the key to the operation of the p-n junction element 58.<br>
An alternative way to design a p-n junction element is to deposit a thin layer of semiconductor onto a supporting material which does not absorb the kind of energy utilized in the respective embodiments . For use with wirelessly transmitted energy in terms of light waves, glass could be a suitable material. Various materials may be used in the semiconductor layers such as but not limited to cadmium telluride, copper- indium- diselenide and silicon. It is also possible to use a multilayer structure with several layers of p and n-type materials to improve efficiency-<br>
The electric energy generated by the p-n junction element 58 could be of the same type as generated by solar cells, in which the negative and positive fields create a direct current. Alternatively, the negative and positive semiconductor layers may change polarity following the transmitted waves, thereby generating an alternating current.<br>
The p-n junction element 58 is designed to make it suited for implantation. Thus, all the external surfaces of the element 58 in contact with the human body are made of a biocompatible material. The p-n junction semiconductors are designed to operate optimally at a body temperature of 37°C because the current output, which should be more than 1 μA, is significantly depending on temperature as shown above. Since both the skin and subcutis absorb energy, the relation between the sensitivity or working area of the element 58 and the intensity or strength of the wireless energy transmission is<br><br>
considered. The p-n junction element 58 preferably is designed flat and small. Alternatively, if the element 58 is made in larger sizes it should be flexible, in order to adapt to the patient's body movements. The volume of the element 58 should be kept less than 2000 cm3.<br>
FIGURE 15 generally illustrates how any of the above-described embodiments of the food intake restriction apparatus of the invention may be implanted in a patient. Thus, a restriction device 4 implanted in a patient engages the stomach 66 to form an upper pouch 61 of the stomach 66 and a restricted stoma opening. An implanted operation device 68, which may also be referred to as an adjustment device, such as an electric motor or a motor/pump assembly, operates the restriction device 4 through a transmission member 70, such as a mechanical transmission cord or a fluid tube. An energy transforming device in the form of an element 6 having a positive region and a negative region, as described above in more detail, is placed underneath the skin of the patient.<br>
Wireless energy carried by a signal transmitted by a wireless remote control of an external energy transmission device 10 at least partly penetrates the patient's skin and hits the element 6. The energy thus hitting the element 6 is transformred into energy of a different form that is suited for powering the operation device 68. For example, where the operation device 68 is an electric motor the element 6 comprises an electric p-n junction element that transforms the wireless energy into an electric current for powering the electric motor. Where the operation device 68 comprises a pump, the element 6 may transform the wireless energy into kinetic energy for powering the pump.<br>
The transformred energy may be utilized for directly operating the restriction device 4 or, where the restriction<br><br>
device 4 is electrically operated, for storage in a capacitor and/or an accumulator for later or parallel use. Preferably (but not necessarily) the element 6 is controlled by a microprocessor. The wireless remote control of the external energy transmission device 10 is used to control the utilization of the transmitted energy and any function or command to/from the implanted restriction device 4.<br>
Fig. 16 shows the basic parts of a wireless remote control of the apparatus of the invention including an electric motor 128 for operating a restriction member, for example of the type illustrated in Fig. 15. In this case, the remote control is based on the transmission of electromagnetic wave signals, often of high frequencies in the order of 100 kHz - 1 gHz, through the skin 130 of the patient. In Fig. 15, all parts placed to the left of the skin 13 0 are located outside the patient' s body and all parts placed to the right of the skin 130 are implanted. Any suitable remote control system may be used.<br>
An external signal transmitting antenna 132 is to be positioned close to a signal receiving antenna 134 implanted close to the skin 130. As an alternative, the receiving antenna 134 may be placed for example inside the abdomen of the patient. The receiving antenna 134 comprises a coil, approximately 1-100 mm, preferably 25 mm in diameter, wound with a very thin wire and tuned with a capacitor to a specific high frequency. A small coil is chosen if it is to be implanted under the skin of the patient and a large coil is chosen if it is to be implanted in the abdomen of the.patient. The transmitting antenna 132 comprises a coil having about the same size as the coil of the receiving antenna 134 but wound with a thick wire that can handle the larger currents that is necessary. The coil of the transmitting antenna 132 is ttined<br><br>
to the same specific high frequency as the coil of the receiving antenna 134.<br>
An external control unit 136 comprises a microprocessor, a high frequency electromagnetic wave signal generator and a power amplifier. The microprocessor of the control unit 136 is adapted to switch the" generator on/off and to modulate signals generated by the generator to send digital information via the power amplifier and the antennas 132,134 to an implanted control unit 138. To avoid that accidental random high frequency fields trigger control commands, digital signal codes are used. A conventional keypad placed on the external control unit 136 is connected to the microprocessor thereof. The keypad is used to order the microprocessor to send digital signals to either contract or enlarge the restriction device. The microprocessor starts a command by applying a high frequency signal on the antenna 132. After a short time, when the signal has energized the implanted parts of the control system, commands are sent to the restriction device to contract or enlarge the stoma opening in predefined steps. The commands are sent as digital packets in the form illustrated below.<br><br>
Start pattern, 8 bits	Command, 8 bits	Count, 8 bits	Checksum, 8 bits<br>
The commands are sent continuously during a rather long time period (e.g. about 30 seconds or more). When a new contract or enlarge step is desired the Count byte is increased by one to allow the implanted control unit 138 to decode and understand that another step is demanded by the external control unit 136. If any part of the digital packet<br><br>
is erroneous, its content is simply ignored.<br>
Through a line 140, an implanted energizer unit 126 draws energy from the high frequency electromagnetic wave signals received by the receiving antenna 134. The energizer unit 126 stores the energy in an energy storage device, -such as a large capacitor, powers the" control unit 13 8 and powers the electric motor 128 via a line 142.<br>
The control unit 13 8 comprises a demodulator and a microprocessor. The demodulator demodulates digital signals sent from the external control unit 136. The microprocessor of the control unit 13 8 receives the digital packet, decodes it and, provided that the power supply of the energizer unit 126 has sufficient energy stored, sends a signal via a signal line 144 to the motor 128 to either contract or enlarge the restriction device depending on the received command code.<br>
Alternatively, the energy stored in the energy storage device of the energizer unit may only be used for powering a switch, and the energy for powering the motor 128 may be obtained from another implanted energy source of relatively high capacity, for example a battery. In this case the switch is adapted to connect the battery to the control unit 138 in an on mode when the switch is powered by the energy storage device and to keep the battery disconnected from the control unit in a standby mode when the switch is unpowered.<br><br>
With reference to Fig. 17, the remote control schematically described above will now be described in accordance with a more detailed embodiment. The external control unit 136 comprises a microprocessor 146, a signal generator 14 8 and a power amplifier 150 connected thereto. The microprocessor 146 is ■ adapted to switch the signal generator 148 on/off and to modulate signals generated by the signal generator 14 8 with digital commands that are sent to implanted components of the apparatus. The power amplifier 150 amplifies the signals and sends them to the external signal transmitting antenna 132. The antenna 132 is connected in parallel with a capacitor 152 to form a resonant circuit tuned to the frequency generated by the signal generator 148.<br>
The implanted signal receiving antenna coil 134 forms together with a capacitor 154 a resonant circuit that is tuned to the same frequency as the transmitting antenna 132. The signal receiving antenna coil 134 induces a current from the received high frequency electromagnetic waves and a rectifying diode 160 rectifies the induced current, which charges a storage capacitor 158. A coil 156 connected between the antenna coil 134 and the diode 160 prevents the capacitor 158 and the diode 160 from loading the circuit of the signal receiving antenna 134 at higher frequencies. Thus, the coil 156 makes it possible to charge the capacitor 158 and to transmit digital information using amplitude modulation.<br>
A capacitor 162 and a resistor 164 connected in parallel and a diode 166 forms a detector used to detect amplitude modulated digital information. A filter circuit is formed by a resistor 168 connected in series with a resistor 170 connected in series with a capacitor 172 connected in series with the resistor 168 via ground, and a capacitor 174, one terminal of which is connected between the resistors 168,170 and the other<br><br>
terminal of which is connected between the diode 166 and the circuit formed by the capacitor 162 and resistor 164. The filter circuit is used to filter out undesired low and high frequencies. The detected and filtered signals are fed to an implanted microprocessor 176 that decodes the digital information and controls the motor 128 via an H-bridge 178 comprising transistors 180,182,184 and 186. The motor 128 can be driven in two opposite directions by the H-bridge 178.<br>
The microprocessor 176 also monitors the amount of stored energy in the storage capacitor 158. Before sending signals to activate the motor 12 8, the microprocessor 176 checks whether the energy stored in the storage capacitor 158 is enough. If the stored energy is not enough to perfoarm the requested operation, the microprocessor 176 waits for the received signals to charge the storage capacitor 158 before activating the motor 128.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
