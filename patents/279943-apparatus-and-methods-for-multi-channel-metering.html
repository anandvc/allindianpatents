divisional of U.S. Pat. App. No. 09/795,838, filed February 28, 2001 (now U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 6,947,854). Theentrre contents of each of those applications are incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
Background and Summary<br>
One embodiment of the present invention comprises a metering device that is<br>
related to the Quadlogic ASIC-based family of meters (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,947,854,<br>
and U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 20060036388, the entire contents of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference). Specifically, this embodiment (referred to herein<br>
for convenience as "Energy Guard") is a multi-channel meter that preferably is<br>
capable of providing much of the functionality of the above-mentioned family of<br>
meters, and further provides the improvements, features, and components listed<br>
below.<br>
Used in at least one embodiment, a MiniCloset is a 24-channel metering<br>
device that can measure electric usage for up to 24 single-phase customers, 12 two-<br>
phase customer, or 8 three-phase customers. Preferably connected to the MiniCloset<br>
are one or more Load Control Modules (LCMs), discussed below.<br>
Energy Guard preferably comprises a MiniCloset meter head module and two<br>
LCMs mounted into a steel box. Relays that allow for an electricity customer to be<br>
remotely disconnected and reconnected, along with current transformers, also are<br>
mounted into the box. See FIG. 1.<br>
Upon installation, an electricity customer's electricity supply line is tapped off<br>
the main electric feeder, passed through the Energy Guard apparatus, and run directly<br>
to the customer's home. The construction and usage of the Energy Guard will be<br>
 <br>
apparent to those skilled in the art upon review of the description below and related<br>
figures. Source code is supplied in the attached Appendix.<br>
Energy Guard meters preferably are operable to provide:<br>
(A)	Remote Disconnect/Reconnect: The meter supports full duplex (bidirectional)<br>
communication via power line communication ("PLC") and may be<br>
equipped with remotely operated relays (60 amp, 100 amp, or 200 amp) that allow for<br>
disconnect and reconnect of electric users remotely.<br>
(B)	Theft Prevention: The system is designed with three specific features to<br>
prevent theft. First, an Energy Guard apparatus preferably is installed on a utility pole<br>
above the medium-tension lines, making it difficult for customers to reach and tamper<br>
with. Second, because there are no additional signal wires with the system (i.e., all<br>
communication is via the power line), any severed communication wires are<br>
immediately detectable. That is, if a communication wire is cut, service is cut, which<br>
is readily apparent. A third theft prevention feature is that the meter may be used to<br>
measure the transformer energy in order to validate the measured totals of individual<br>
clients. Discrepancies can indicate theft of power.<br>
(C)	Tamper Detection: The Energy Guard preferably provides two modes of<br>
optical tamper detection. Each unit contains a light that reflects against a small<br>
mirror-like adhesive sticker. The absence of this reflective light indicates that the box<br>
has been opened. This detection will automatically disconnect all clients measured by<br>
that Energy Guard unit. In addition, if the Energy Guard enclosure is opened and<br>
ambient light enters, this will also automatically disconnect all clients measured by<br>
that Energy Guard unit. These two modes of tamper detection are continuously<br>
engaged and alternate multiple times per second for maximum security.<br>
(D)	Reverse Voltage Detection: In some cases, a utility company can<br>
disconnect power to an individual client and that client is able to obtain power via an<br>
alternative feed. If the utility were to reconnect power under these conditions,<br>
damage could occur to the metering equipment and/or the distribution system.<br>
Energy Guard preferably is able to detect this fault condition. The Energy Guard can<br>
detect any voltage that feeds back into the open disconnect through the lines that<br>
connect to the customers' premises. If voltage is detected, the firmware of the Energy<br>
Guard will automatically prevent the reconnection.<br>
 <br>
(E)	Pre-Payment: Pre-payment for energy can be done via phone, electronic<br>
transaction, or in person. The amount of kWh purchased is transmitted to the meter<br>
and stored in its memory. The meter will count down, showing how much energy is<br>
still available before reaching zero and disconnecting. As long as the customer<br>
continues to purchase energy, there will be no interruption in service, and the utility<br>
company will have a daily activity report.<br>
(F)	Load Limiting: As an alternative to disconnection for nonpayment or part<br>
of a pre-payment system, Energy Guard meters can allow the utility to remotely limit<br>
the power delivered to a set level, disconnecting when that load is exceeded. If the<br>
customer exceeds that load and is disconnected, the customer can reset a button on the<br>
optional remote display unit to restore load as long as the connected load is less than<br>
the pre-set limit. Alternatively, clients can call an electric utility service line by<br>
telephone to have the service restored. This feature allows electric utilities to provide<br>
electricity for critical systems even, for example, in the case of a non-paying<br>
customer.<br>
(G)	Monthly Consumption Limiting: Some customers benefit from subsidized<br>
rates and are given a maximum total consumption per month. The Energy Guard<br>
firmware is capable of shutting down power when a certain consumption level is<br>
reached. However, this type of program is best implemented when advanced<br>
notification to customers is provided. This can be achieved either with a display in<br>
the home whereby a message or series of messages notifies customers that their rate<br>
of consumption is approaching the projected consumption for the month.<br>
Alternatively (or in conjunction) timed service interruptions can be programmed so<br>
that as the limit is approaching, power is disconnected for periods of time with longer<br>
and longer increments to notify the residents. These planned interruptions in service<br>
act as a warning to customers that their limit is nearing so that they have time to alter<br>
their consumption patterns.<br>
(H) MeteT Validation: The integrated module of the system preferably is<br>
removable. This permits easy laboratory re-validation of meter accuracy in the event<br>
of client billing disputes.<br>
(I) Operational Benefits for Utility: The Energy Guard has extensive onboard<br>
event logs and diagnostic functions, providing field technicians with a wealth of data<br>
 <br>
for commissioning and trouble shooting the electrical and communication systems.<br>
Non billing parameters include: amps, volts, temperature, total harmonic distortion,<br>
frequency, instantaneous values of watts, vars and volt-amperes, V2 hrs, 12 hrs, power<br>
factor, and phase angle.<br>
These features and others will be apparent to those skilled in the art after<br>
reviewing the attached descriptions, software code, and schematics.<br>

Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
In one embodiment, an Energy Guard metering apparatus comprises a<br>
Mini Closet (that is, a metering apparatus operable to meter a plurality of customer<br>
lines); a Scan Transponder; one or more relays operable to disconnect service to<br>
selected customers; a Load Control Module; and optical tamper detection means.<br>
The MiniCloset and Scan Transponder referred to herein are largely the same<br>
as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,947,854. That is, although each has been improved<br>
over the years, the functionality and structure relevant to this description may be taken<br>
to be the same as described in that patent<br>
One aspect of the invention comprises taking existing multichannel metering<br>
functionality found in the MiniCloset and adding remote connect and disconnect via<br>
PLC. Providing such additional functionality required adding new hardware and<br>
software. The added hardware comprises a Load Control Module (LCM) and<br>
 <br>
connect/disconnect relays. Also added was support circuitry to route signal traces to<br>
and from the main meter processor- the MiniCloset5 Meter Head. The software<br>
additions include code modules that communicate with the added hardware, as<br>
described in the tables below.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of connections of a preferred embodiment. Medium<br>
voltage power lines A, B, C, and N (neutral) feed into Distribution Transformer 110.<br>
Low voltage lines connect (via current transformers 120) Distribution Transformer<br>
110 to Energy Guard unit 140. Energy Guard unit 140 monitors current transformers<br>
120, and feeds single phase customer lines 1-24.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of preferred structure of an Energy Guard unit 140.<br>
Scan Transponder 210 is the preferred data collector for the unit 140, may be<br>
located external to or inside the MiniCloset, and may be the main data collector for<br>
more than one MiniCloset at a time. The Scan Transponder 210 preferably : (a)<br>
verifies data (each communication preferably begins with clock and meter identity<br>
verification to ensure data integrity); (b) collects data (periodically it collects a data<br>
block from each meter unit, with each block containing previously collected meter<br>
readings, interval readings, and event logs); (c) stores data (preferably the data is<br>
stored in non-volatile memory for a specified period (e.g., 40 days)); and (d) reports<br>
data (either via PLC, telephone modem, RS-232 connection, or other means).<br>
The slide plate 280 comprises a Minicloset meter head and a load control<br>
module 240 that provides the control signals to activate the relays. All of the<br>
electronics preferably is powered up by power supply 250. The back plate assembly<br>
270 comprises multiple (e.g., 24) Current Transformers and relays - grouped, in this<br>
example, as three sets of 8 CTs and relays. Customer cables are wired through the<br>
CTs and connect to the circuit on customer premises 290. The remotely located Scan<br>
Transponder 210 accesses the Energy Guard meter head and bi-directionally<br>
communicates using power line carrier communication.<br>
The signal flow shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 preferably is accomplished by<br>
implementing different software code modules that work concurrently to enable<br>
remote connect/disconnect ability in the Minicloset. These software modules,<br>
provided in the Appendix below, are:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
FIGS. 3-10 are schematics of preferred components, as described below. The<br>
preferred connect/disconnect relays are series K850 KG relays, but those skilled in the<br>
art will recognize that other relays may be used without departing from the scope of<br>
the invention.<br>
 <br>
In another embodiment, the implementation of Energy Guard takes advantage<br>
of the similarity of architecture of traditional circuit breaker panels, with the<br>
multichannel metering environment. In a circuit breaker panel, electricity is fed to the<br>
panel and distributed among various customer circuits via circuit breakers that<br>
provide the ability to connect or disconnect the customer circuits.<br>
In the MiniCloset/Energy Guard, multiple current transformers measure the<br>
current in customer circuits and bring this data back to a central processing unit where<br>
the metering quantities are calculated. However, the MiniClosefEnergy Guard has<br>
several key differences with a circuit breaker panel. For example, whereas circuit<br>
 <br>
breakers are found near customer premises, the Energy Guard typically is installed<br>
near the utility distribution transformer. The advantages offered by this alternate<br>
embodiment will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, this<br>
embodiment offers improved dimensions and overall size over the embodiments<br>
discussed above. Space is always a constraint when equipment additions are made to<br>
existing electrical installations. This version of the Energy Guard ("EG"), with<br>
preferred dimensions of 28" X 22" X 11" provides a substantial advantage in<br>
situations where volumetric constraints exist.<br>
The following description includes preferred construction details, detailed<br>
schematics, and software descriptions. As with the embodiments discussed above,<br>
this embodiment is operable to providing remote disconnect/connect operations,<br>
preventing theft, detecting tampering, detecting reverse voltage, performing pre-<br>
payment and limiting load, and performing meter validation.<br>

 <br>
EG Base Assembly<br>
The EG base comprises an enclosure bottom with screws and retaining<br>
washers as a locking mechanism for the top cover of EG, which is connected on one<br>
side by piano hinges. See FIG. 11. The enclosure bottom provides routing for the<br>
customer cables.<br>
EG Assembly- Phase Bus Bars<br>
Three aluminum phase bus bars are placed towards the center of the Energy<br>
Guard assembly and staggered. See FIGS. 12 and 13. These provide connection to<br>
the customer metering modules by the use of transition bars. A staggered bus bar<br>
layout is depicted in FIG. 13. Bus bars are shown in black.<br>
Neutral Bars<br>
The EG preferably comprises 4 neutral bars that form a frame for EG<br>
assembly, thereby providing a path for the neutral current. This is shown in FIG. 14.<br>
The lug on the cross bar provides the neutral feed from the utility distribution<br>
transformer. Also, there are 2 mother board neutral bars that carry the neutral current<br>
to the control module.<br>
Transition Bars<br>
The transition bars complete the mechanical and electrical connection between<br>
the customer metering modules and the phase bus bars. See FIG. 15. A transition bar<br>
for phase A and C is shown in FIG. 15 A; a transition bar for phase B is shown in FIG.<br>
15B. FIG. 16 shows the transition bars in black.<br>
Acceptor Module<br>
An acceptor module preferably is made of plastic and mechanically accepts<br>
the metering modules that can be easily fitted in the EG assembly. Each EG has 4<br>
acceptor modules that are stacked together and can accommodate either 12 two-phase<br>
or 8 three-phase metering modules. See FIG. 17. The acceptor module also provides<br>
a mechanical route for the motherboard neutral bar which connects to the control<br>
module. See FIG. 18.<br>
Customer Metering Modules<br>
 <br>
Preferred customer metering modules provide metrology required to measure<br>
the consumption for a single phase, two phase, or three phase customer. An<br>
individual module functions as a complete stand-alone meter that can he tested and<br>
evaluated as a separate metering unit. Each module preferably comprises an<br>
integrated current sensing and relay module and metrology electronics, and provides a<br>
connection between the customer circuit and the phase bus bars. FIG. 19 depicts a<br>
preferred integrated current sensing and relay module. FIG. 20 depicts an exploded<br>
view of a preferred integrated current sensing and relay module.<br>
FIG. 21 shows exploded views of preferred metering modules. FIG. 22 shows<br>
the metering modules (shown in black) placed in the EG frame assembly and acceptor<br>
module.<br>

Electronics<br>
The Control Module boxes preferably comprise various PCBs that work<br>
concurrently to collect metering data from the individual metering modules and<br>
communicate over power lines to transmit this data to a master device, such as a Scan<br>
Transponder ("ST").<br>
FIG. 25 shows a preferred Energy Guard layout for this embodiment. Each<br>
customer line has a corresponding Metering Module (PCB 203 and PCB 204,<br>
discussed below) (schematics shown in FIGS. 26 and 27).<br>
A Back Place Board 2510 shown in FIG. 25 (PCB 234; see FIG. 28 for<br>
construction diagram and schematic) is the common bus that routes signals within the<br>
EG. There are two kinds of communication options on the Back Place Board 2510 to<br>
enable data transfer from Control Module 2520 to individual Metering Modules PCB<br>
203. This can be done either using the 2 wire I2C option or the 1 wire serial option.<br>
The Control Module 2520 comprises a Power Board (PCB 210; see FIG. 29<br>
for schematic) is the power supply board that also has the PLC transmit and receive<br>
circuitry on it. The Power Board provides power to the CPU board and the<br>
electronics of 203 boards. The Control Module 2520 also comprises an I/O Extension<br>
Board (PCB 230; see FIG. 30 for schematic) is a board with several I/O extension<br>
options that enable communication from Metering Modules to the CPU board.<br>
 <br>
Control Module 2520 also comprises a CPU Board (PCB 202; see FIG. 31 for<br>
schematic), which has a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) processor on board.<br>
Finally, Control Module 2520 comprises a foliting board (PCB 235; see FIG.<br>
32 for schematic) with traces and a header with no electronic components on it.<br>
Each Customer Display Module (CDM) 2530 is installed at the customer's<br>
premises and can bidirectionally communicate with the EG installed at the<br>
distribution transformer serving the customer. Two-way PLC enables utility-<br>
customer communication over low voltage power lines and allows the utility to send<br>
regular information, warnings, special information about outages, etc. to the customer.<br>
Each CDM 2530 comprises a selected combination of metering and power<br>
supply along with PLC circuitry on the same board (PCB 240; see FIG. 33 for<br>
schematic). Each CDM preferably also has a 9-digit display board (PCB 220; see<br>
FIG. 34 for schematic). This display communicates with EG and shows information<br>
about consumption, cautions, warnings, and other utility messages.<br>
Hardware Implementation<br>
In one embodiment, the Energy Guard implements Fast Fourier Transform<br>
(FFT) on the PLC communication signal both at the ST and the meter, and for<br>
metering purposes performs detailed harmonic analysis. This section discusses an<br>
implementation scheme of the Metering Modules, communication with Control<br>
Modules and PLC communication of the Control Module with a remotely located<br>
Scan Transponder.<br>
The Control Module 2520 comprises power supply and PLC circuitry (PCB<br>
210; see FIGS. 25 and 29); I/O extension (PCB 230; see FIG. 30) and CPU board<br>
named D Meter (PCB 202; see FIG. 31). The power supply supplies power to the D<br>
meter and I/O extension and contains the PLC transmitter and receiver circuitry. PCB<br>
235 provides a trace routing and header connection between various boards.<br>
The Metering Module may have two versions: 2-phase or 3-phase. The 2-<br>
phase version can be programmed by software to function as a single 2-phase meter or<br>
two 1-phase meters. The 2-phase version comprises a B2 meter (PCB 203 schematic<br>
shown in FIG. 26), whereas the 3-phase version comprises a B3 meter (PCB204<br>
schematic shown in FIG. 27). The B meters act as slaves to the D meter in Control<br>
Module 2520. The D and B meters can communicate via a serial ASCII protocol.<br>
 <br>
The various B meters are interconnected via BPB 2510 to 2520 that provides power, a<br>
I Hz reference and serial communications to the D meter. The preferred DSP engine<br>
for the B meter is the Freescale 56F8014VFAE chip. The preferred microprocessor<br>
used for implementing the CPU on the D meter is one among the family of ColdFire<br>
Integrated Microprocessors, MCF5207. The use of a specific processor is determined<br>
by RAM and Flash requirements dictated by the meter version. A separate power<br>
supply and LCD board complete the electronic portion of the D meter as a product.<br>
Apart from acting as a master for B meters, the D meter is also a 3-phase meter and<br>
measures fee total transformer output on which the EG is installed. As an anti-theft<br>
feature, this total is compared with the total consumption reported by the various B<br>
meters.<br>
 <br>
The signal streams constituency is as follows:<br>
B2: Two voltage, Two current, and No Power Line Carrier (PLC) Channel.<br>
B3: Three voltage, Three current, and No PLC Channel.<br>
D: Three voltage, Three current, and one PLC Channel.<br>
Each stream has an associated circuit to effect analog amplification and anti-<br>
aliasing.<br>
Specific to the D meter is the preferred implementation of:<br>
A Phase Locked Loop (PLL) to lock the sampling of the signal streams<br>
to a multiple of the incoming A/C line (synchronous sampling to the power line).<br>
A Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) at 90-100 MHz controlled by<br>
DSP processor via two PWM modules directly driving the system clock hence making<br>
the DSP coherent with the PLL.<br>
•	A synchronous phase detector that responds only to the fundamental of<br>
the incoming line frequency wave and not to its harmonics.<br>
•	Option for performing FSK and PSK modulation schemes.<br>
Each metering and communication channel preferably comprises front-end<br>
analog circuitry followed by the signal processing. Unique to the analog circuitry is<br>
 <br>
an anti-aliasing filter with fixed gain which provides first-order temperature tracking,<br>
hence eliminating the need to recalibrate meters when temperature drifts are<br>
encountered. This is discussed next, and then a preferred signal processing<br>
implementation is discussed.<br>
Voltage and Current Analog Signal Chain<br>
The analog front-end for voltage (current) channels comprises voltage<br>
(current) sensing elements and a programmable attenuator, followed by an antialiasing<br>
filter. The attenuator reduces the incoming signal level so that no clipping<br>
occurs after the anti-aliasing filter. The constant gain anti-aliasing filter restores the<br>
signal to full value at the input of the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). For<br>
metering, the anti-aliasing filter cuts off frequencies above 5 kHz. The inputs are then<br>
ted into the ADC which is a part of the DSP. See FIG. 35, which is a block diagram<br>
of a preferred analog front-end for metering.<br>
Whereas a typical implementation would include a Programmable Gain<br>
Amplifier (PGA) followed by a low gain anti-aliasing filter, the invention, in this<br>
embodiment, implements a programmable attenuator followed by a large fixed-gain<br>
filter. In addition, the implementation of both the anti-aliasing filters on a single chip<br>
is the same using the same Quad Op Amps along with 25 ppm resistors and<br>
NPO/COG capacitors. This unique implementation by pairing the anti-aliasing filters<br>
ensures that the phase drifts encountered in both voltage and current channels are<br>
exactly identical and hence accuracy of the power calculation (given by the product of<br>
V and I) is not compromised. This provides a means for both V and I channels to<br>
track temperature drifts up to first order without recalibrating the meter.<br>
In contrast, using a PGA along with a low gain filter cannot track the phase<br>
shift in the V and I signals introduced due to temperature. This is because the phase<br>
shift introduced by PGA is a function of the gain.<br>
Voltage, Current and PLC Digital Signal Chain<br>
FIG. 36 is a block diagram of the PCB 202 board; the functions of each block<br>
will be apparent to those skilled in the art. FIG. 36 shows a preferred DSP<br>
implementation.<br>
This embodiment preferably uses a PLL to lock the sampling of the signal<br>
streams to a multiple of the incoming A/C line frequency. In the embodiment<br>
 <br>
discussed above, the sampling is at a rate asynchronous to the power line. In the D<br>
meter, there is a VCO at 90-100 MHz which is controlled by the DSP engine via two<br>
PWM modules. The VCO directly drives the system clock of the DSP chip (disabling<br>
the internal PLL), so the DSP becomes an integral part of the PLL. Locking the<br>
system clock of the DSP to the power line facilitates the alignment of the sampling to<br>
the waveform of thepower line. The phase detector should function so as to respond<br>
only to the fundamental of the incoming 60Hz wave and not to it harmonics. FIG. 37<br>
is a block diagram of this preferred DSP implementation.<br>
A DSP BIOS or voluntary context switching code provides three stacks, each<br>
for background, PLC communications and serial communications. The small micro<br>
communicates with the DSP using a I2C driver. The MSP430F2002 integrated circuit<br>
measures the power supplies, tamper port, temperature and battery voltage. The tasks<br>
of the MSP430F2002 include:<br>
i. maintain an RTC;<br>
ii. measure the battery voltage;<br>
iii. measure the temperature;<br>
iv. measure the +U power supply;<br>
v. reset the DSP on brown out;<br>
vi. provide an additional watchdog circuit; and<br>
vii. provide a 1-second reference to go into the DSP for a time reference to<br>
measure the 1-second reference against the system clock from the VCO.<br>
D Meter PLC Communication Signal Chain<br>
A typical installation consists of multiple EGs and STs communicating over<br>
the power lines. The D meter communicates bi-directionally with a remotely located<br>
Scan Transponder through the distribution transformer. To enable this, this<br>
embodiment uses a 10-25 kHz band for PLC communication. The PLC signal is<br>
sampled at about 240 kHz (212 * 60), synchronous with line voltage, following which<br>
a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter is applied to decimate the data. Preferred FIR<br>
specifications are given below:<br>
10-25 kHz Band<br>
 <br>
 <br>
See FIG. 38 for preferred inphase filter frequency response and impulse<br>
response characteristics.<br>
After the decimation is done to 60 kHz (211 * 30), a 2048-point FFT is then<br>
performed on the decimated data. The data rate is thus determined to be 30 baud<br>
depending on the choice of FIR filters. Every FFT yields two bits approximately<br>
every 66 msec when using FIR in the 10-25 kHz band to communicate through<br>
distribution transformers.<br>
To circumvent the problem of communicating in the presence of line noise,<br>
this embodiment preferably implements a unique technique for robust and reliable<br>
communication. This is done by injecting PLC signals at frequencies that are half odd<br>
harmonics of the line frequency (60Hz). This is discussed below, for an embodiment<br>
using a typical noise spectrum found on AC lines in the range 12-12.2 kHz.<br>
FIG. 39 illustrates injecting PLC signals at half-odd harmonics of 60 Hz.<br>
Since FFT is done every 30 Hz and the harmonics are separated by 60 Hz, the data<br>
bits reside in the bin corresponding to the 201.5th and 202.5th harmonic of 60 Hz in<br>
FIG. 39. The algorithm considers these two bins of frequencies and compares the<br>
amplitude of the signal in the two to determine 1 or 0. This FSK scheme uses two<br>
frequencies and yields a data rate of 30 baud. Alternatively, QFSK, which uses 4<br>
frequencies, can be implemented to yield 60 baud.<br>
When traversing through transformers, both STs and D meters preferably<br>
perform FFT on the PLC and data signals every 30 Hz in a 10-25 kHZ range.<br>
Because the Phase Lock Loops (PLLs) implemented in both the ST and the D meter<br>
are locked to the line, the data frames are synchronized to the line frequency (60 Hz)<br>
as well. However, the data frames can shift in phase due to:<br>
1. various transformer configurations that can exist in the path between<br>
the ST and meter (delta-Wye, etc.); and<br>
 <br>
2. a shift in phase due to the fact that STs are locked on a particular<br>
phase, whereas single and polyphase meters can be powered up by other phases.<br>
The signal to noise ratio (SNR) is maximized when the meter data frame and-<br>
ST data frames are aligned close to perfection. From a meter's standpoint, this<br>
requires receiving PLC signal from all possible STs that it can "hear," decoding the<br>
signal, checking for SNR by aligning data frames, and then responding to the ST that<br>
is yielding maximum SNR. FIG. 40 depicts the 12 possible ways in which the FFT<br>
frame received by the meter can be out of phase with ST FFT frame. Dotted lines<br>
correspond to a 30 degree rotation accounting for a delta transformer in the signal<br>
path between ST and the meter.<br>
In addition, because the data frames are available every 30 Hz on a 60 Hz line,<br>
there are two possibilities corresponding to the 2 possible phases obtained by dividing<br>
60 Hz by 2. Hence, there are 24 ways that meter data frames can be misaligned with<br>
ST data frames.<br>
In each frame of the ST, there are an odd integral number of cycles of the<br>
carrier frequency. Since the preferred modulation scheme is Frequency Shift Keying<br>
(FSK), if there are n cycles for transmitting bit 1, bit 0 is transmitted using n+2 cycles<br>
of the carrier frequency. It becomes vital for the meter to recognize its own 2 cycles<br>
of 60 Hz in order to be able to decode its data bits which are available every 1/3 Oth of<br>
a second.<br>
If the D meter decodes signals with misaligned data frames, there is energy<br>
that spills over into the adjacent (half-odd separated) frequencies. If the signal level<br>
that falls into the "adjacent" frequency bin is less than the noise floor, the signal can<br>
be decoded correctly. However, if the spill-over is more than the noise floor, the<br>
ability to distinguish between 1 and 0 decreases, and hence the overall SNR drops,<br>
resulting in an error in decoding. In conclusion:<br>
a.	If the frames are misaligned, smearing of data bits occurs and the SNR<br>
degrades.<br>
b.	In the event that the frequency changes and there are misaligned data<br>
frames, there is a substantial amount of energy that spills over into the adjacent FFT<br>
bins, hence interfering with the other STs in the system that communicate using<br>
frequencies in that specific bins.<br>
 <br>
Once the clock shift is determined corresponding to the highest SNR, the<br>
meter then locks until a significant change in SNR ratio is encountered by the meter,<br>
in which case the process repeats.<br>
Implementation of Metering in D and B Meter using FFT<br>
Whereas versions of the B meter and the D meter perform metering, the D<br>
meter also is responsible for collecting the metering information from the various B<br>
meters via PCB 234. Each data stream in the meters has an associated circuit to effect<br>
analog amplification and anti-aliasing. Each of the analog front end sections has a<br>
programmable attenuator that is controlled by the higher level code. The data stream<br>
is sampled at 60 kHz (210 * 60) and then an FIR filter is applied to decimate the data<br>
stream to ~15 kHz (28 * 60). Preferred filter specifications are shown in the table<br>
below and FIG. 41.<br>
 <br>
Since only the data up to 3 kHz is of interest, praferably a 3-12 kHz rolloff on<br>
the decimating FIR is used with ~15KHZ sample rate. The frequencies from 0-3 kHz<br>
or 12-15 kHz are mapped into 0-3 kHZ. A real FFTs is performed to yield 2 streams<br>
of data which can be further decomposed into 4 streams of data: Real and Imaginary<br>
Voltage and Real and Imaginary Current. This is achieved by adding and subtracting<br>
positive and negative mirror frequencies for the real and imaginary parts, respectively.<br>
Since the aliased signal in the 12-15 kHZ range falls below 80 dB, the accuracy is<br>
achieved using the above-discussed FIR filter. Alternatively, a 256-point complex<br>
FFT can be performed on every phase of the decimated data stream. This yields 2<br>
pairs of data streams: a real part, which is the voltage, and an imaginary part, which<br>
is the current. This approach requires a 256 complex FFT every 16.667 milliseconds.<br>
The results of performing either FFT are the voltage and current shown in<br>
FIG. 42, where the notation Vm,n denotes the mth harmonic of the nth cycle number.<br>
For example, V11 and I11 correspond to the fundamental of the first cycle, and V21 and<br>
I21 to the first harmonic of the first cycle, etc., as shown in FIG. 42, which depicts<br>
FFT frames for voltage, indicating the harmonics.<br>
 <br>
The real and imaginary parts of the harmonic content of any k?h cycle are given<br>
by:<br>
Vink=Re(Vink)+i Im(Vink);m = l...M<br>
Iink = Re(Vink)+i Im(Vink);k = l...n<br>
The imaginary part of voltage is the measure of lack of synchronization<br>
between the PLL and the line frequency. In order to calculate metering quantities, the<br>
calculations are done in the time domain. In the time domain, the FFT functionality<br>
offers the flexibility to calculate metering quantities either using only the fundamental<br>
or including the harmonics. Using the complex form of voltage and current obtained<br>
from the FFT, the metering quantities are calculated as:<br>
P = Vink*Iink<br>
W = Re(P) = Re(Vink) * Re(Iink) + Im(Iink) * Im(Vink)<br>
Var = Im(P) = Re(Vink) * Im(Vink) + Re(Iink) * Im(Vink)<br>
PowerFactor = W/P<br>
However, in the above formulas, when the harmonics are included<br>
(Vink &amp; Iink; m = 1.. .M, k = 1...n), all metering quantities include the effects of<br>
harmonics. On the other hand, when only the fundamental is used (Vlk &amp; Itk), all<br>
calculated quantities represent only the 60 Hz contribution. As an example, we show<br>
the calculations when only the fundamental is used to perform calculations. Only V1<br>
and I1 are used from all FFT data frames. The following quantities are calculated for<br>
a given set of N frames and a line frequency of fline:<br>
 <br>
The displacement power factor is given by:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
This flexibility to either include or exclude the harmonics when calculating<br>
metering quantities translates to a significant improvement over the capabilities<br>
offered by the above-described embodiment. Yet another feature offered by this<br>
embodiment is the calculation of Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). The THD is the<br>
measurement of the harmonic distortion present, and is defined as the ratio of the sum<br>
of the powers of all harmonic components to the power of the fundamental. For the<br>
n'h cycle, this is evaluated as:<br>
 <br>
Customer Display Module<br>
The customer display module is installed at the customer premises,<br>
communicates with Energy Guard near the transformer, and comprises: PCB 240,<br>
power supply and PLC circuitry (see FIG. 33); and PCB 220, LCD display (see FIG.<br>

a bidirectional PLC unit that communicates with EG. For'example, not only can the<br>
utility send messages, the customer can also request a consumption verification with<br>
