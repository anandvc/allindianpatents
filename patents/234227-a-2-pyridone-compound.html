				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to novel 2-pyridone derivatives, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions comprising them, and their use in therapy.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Elastases are possibly the most destructive enzymes in the body, having the ability to degrade virtually all connective tissue components. The uncontrolled proteolytic degradation by elastases has been implicated in a number of pathological conditions. Human neutrophil elastase (hNE), a member of the chymotrypsin superfamily of serine proteases is a 33-KDa enzyme stored in the azurophilic granules of the neutrophils. In neutrophils the concentration of NE exceeded 5 mM and its total cellular amount has been estimated to be up to 3 pg. Upon activation, NE is rapidly released from the granules into the extracellular space with some portion remaining bound to neutrophil plasma membrane (See Kawabat et al. 2002, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 451,1-10). The main intracellular physiological function of NE is degradation of foreign organic molecules phagocytosed by neutrophils, whereas the main target for extracellular elastase is elastin (Janoff and Scherer, 1968, J. Exp. Med. 128,1137-1155). NE is unique, as compared to other proteases (for example, proteinase 3) in that it has the ability to degrade almost all extracellular matrix and key plasma proteins (See Kawabat et al., 2002, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 451,1-10). It degrades a wide range of extracellular matrix proteins such as elastin, Type 3 and type 4 collagens, laminin, fibronectin, cytokines, etc. (Ohbayashi, H., 2002, Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs, 11, 965-980). NE is a major common mediator of many pathological changes seen in chronic lung disease including epithelial damage (Stockley, R.A. 1994, Am. J. Resp. Crit. Care Med. 150,109-113).<br>
The destructive role of NE was solidified almost 40 years ago when Laurell and Eriksson reported an association of chronic airflow obstruction and emphysema with deficiency of<br><br><br>
serum tti-antitrypsin (Laurell and Eriksson, 1963, Scand. J. Clin. Invest 15,132-140). Subsequently it was determined that cci-antitrypsin is the most important endogenous inhibitor of human NE. The imbalance between human NE and endogenous antiprotease is believed to cause excess human NE in pulmonary tissues which is considered as a major pathogenic factor in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The excessive human NE shows a prominent destructive profile and actively takes part in destroying the normal pulmonary structures, followed by the irreversible enlargement of the respiratory airspaces, as seen mainly in emphysema. There is an increase in neutrophil recruitment into the lungs which is associated with increased lung elastase burden and emphysema in (Xi-proteinase inhibitor-deficient mice (Cavatra et al., 1996, Lab. Invest 75,273-280). Individuals with higher levels of me NE-cti protease inhibitor complex in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid show sigtiifbaiitly accelerated decline in lung functions compared to those with lower levels (Betsuyoku et al. 2000, Respiration, 67,261-267). Instillation of human NE via the trachea in r?.ts causes lung haemorrhage, neutrophil accumulation during acute phase and emphysematous changes during chronic phase (Karaki et al., 2002, Am. J. Resp. Grit Care Med., 166,496-500). Studies have shown that the acute phase of pulmonary emphysema and pulmonary haemorrhage caused by NE in hamsters can be inhibited by pre-trcatment with inhibitors of NE.( Fujie et al.,1999, Inflamm. Res. 48,160-167).<br>
Nputrophil-predominant airway inflammation and mucus obstruction of the airways are major pathologic features of COPD, including cystic fibrosis and chronic bronchitis. NE impairs mucin production, leading to mucus obstruction of the airways. NE is reported to increase the expression of major respiratory mucin gene, MUC5AC (Fischer, BM &amp; Voynow, 2002, Am. J. Respir. Cell Bid., 26,447-452). Aerosol administration of NE to guinea pigs produces extensive epithelial damage within 20 minutes of contact (Suzuki et al., 1996, Am. J. Resp. Crit. Care Med., 153,1405-1411). Furthermore NE reduces the ciliary beat frequency of human respiratory epithelium in vitro (Smallman et al., 1984, Thorax, 39,663-667) which is consistent with the reduced mucociliary clearance that is seen in COPD patients (Currie et al., 1984, Thorax, 42,126-130). The instillation of NE into the airways leads to mucus gland hyperplasia in hamsters (Lucey et al., 1985, Am. Resp. Crit. Care Med., 132,362-366). A role for NE is also implicated in mucus hypersecretion in asthma. In an allergen sensitised guinea pig acute asthma model an<br><br>
inhibitor of NE prevented goblet cell degranulation and mucus hypersecretion (Nadel et al., 1999, Eur. Resp. J., 13,190-196).<br>
NE has been also shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. NE: di.protenase inhibitor complex is increased in serum of patients with pulmonary fibrosis, which correlates with the clinical parameters in these patients (Yamanouchi et al., 1998, Eur. Resp. J. 11,120-125). In amurine model of human pulmonary fibrosis, aNE inhibitor reduced bleomychi-induced pulmonary fibrosis (Taooka et al., 1997, Am. J. Resp. Grit Care Med, 156,260-265). Furthermore investigators have shown mat NE deficient mice are resistant to bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (Dunsmore et al., 2001, Chest, 120,35S-36S). Plasma NE level was found to be elevated in patients who progressed to ARDS implicating the importance of NE in early ARDS disease pathogenesis. (Donnelly et al., 1995, Am. J. Res. Crit Care Med., 151,428-1433). Jhe antiproteases and NE complexed with antiprotease are increased in lung cancer area (Merchandise et al., 1989, Eur. Resp. J. 2,623-629). Recent studies have shown that polymorphism in the promoter region of the NE gene are associated with lung cancer development (Taniguchi et al., 2002, Clin. Cancer Res., 8,1115-1120.<br>
Acute lung injury caused by endotoxiu in experimental animals is associated with elevated levels of NE (Kawabata, et al., 1999,. Ajm. J. Resp. Crit. Care, 161,2013-2018). Acute lung inflammation caused by intratracheal injection of lipdpolysaccharide in mice has been shown to elevate the NE activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid which is significantly inhibited by a NE inhibitor (Fujie et al., 1999, Eur. J. PharmacoL, 374,117-125; Yasui, et al., 1995, Eur. Resp. J., 8,1293-1299). NE also plays an important role in the neutrophil-induced increase of pulmonary microvascular permeability observed in a model of acute lung injury caused by tumour necrosis factor a (TNFa) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) in isolated perfused rabbit lungs (Miyazaki et al., 1998, Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med., 157,89-94).<br>
A role for NE has also been suggested in monocrotoline-induced pulmonary vascular wall thickening and cardiac hypertrophy (Molteni et al., 1989, Biochemical PharmacoL 38, 2411-2419). Serine elastase inhibitor reverses the monocrotaline-induced pulmonary<br><br>
hypertension and remodelling in rat pulmonary arteries (Cowan et al., 2000, Nature Medicine, 6,698-702). Recent studies have shown that serine elastase, that is, NE or vascular elastase are important in cigarette smoke-induced muscularisation of small pulmonary arteries in guinea pigs (Wright et al., 2002, Am. J. Respir. Crit Care Med., 166, 954-960).<br>
NE plays a key role in experimental cerebral ischemic damage (Shimakura et al., 2000, Brain Research, 858,55-60), ischemia-reperfusion lung injury (Kishima et al., 1998, Ann. Thorac. Surg. 65,913-918) and myocardial ischemia in rat heart (Tiefenbacher et al.T 1997, Eur. J. Physiol., 433, 563-570). Human NE levels in plasma are significantly increased above normal in inflammatory bowel diseases, for example, Crohn's disease and ulcerau've colitis (Adeyemi et al., 1985, Gut, 26,1306-1311). In addition NE has also been assumed to be involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (Adeyemi et al., 1986, Rheumatol. Inf., 6, 57). The development of collagen induced arthritis in mice is suppressed by a NE inhibitor (Kakimoto et al., 1995, Cellular Lnmunol. 165,26-32).<br>
Thus, humon NE is known as one of the most destructive serine proteases and has been implicated in a variety of inflammatory diseases. The important endogenous inhibitor of human NE is ai-antitrypain. The imbalance between human NE and antiprotease is believed to give rise to an excess of human NE resulting in uncontrolled tissue destruction. The protease/ antiprotease balance may be upset by a decreased availability of cci-antitrypsin either through inactivation by oxidants such as cigarette smoke, or as a result of genetic inability to produce sufficient serum levels. Human NE has been implicated in the promotion or exacerbation of a number of diseases such as pulmonary emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ischemia reperfusion injury, rheumatoid arthritis and pulmonary hypertension.<br>

According to a further aspect of the invention we provide a compound.of formula (I) or a phannaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use as a medicament<br>
The compounds of formula (I), and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, are useful because they possess pharmacological activity in animals. The compounds of formula CO have activity as pharmaceuticals, in particular as modulators of human neutrophil elastase and homologous serine proteases such as proteinase 3 and pancreatic elastase, and as such are predicted to be useful hi therapy. The compounds of formula (I) are particularly useful as inhibitors of human neutrophil elastase. They may thus be used in the treatment or prophylaxis of inflammatory diseases and conditions.<br>
Examples of these conditions are: adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cystic fibrosis, pulmonary emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ischaemic-reperfusion injury. The compounds of this invention may also be useful in the modulation of endogenous and/or exogenous biological irritants which cause and/or propagate atherosclerosis, diabetes, myocardial infarction; hepatic disorders including but not limited to cirrhosis, systemic lupus erythematous, inflammatory disease of lymphoid origin, including but not limited to T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, thymocytes; autoimmune diseases, bone marrow; inflammation of the joint (especially rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and gout); inflammation of the gastro-intestinal traet (especially inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, pancreatitis and gastritis); inflammation of<br>
the sicin (especially psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis); in tumour metastasis or invasion; in disease associated with uncontrolled degradation of the extracellular matrix such as osteoarthritis; in bone resorptive disease (such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease); diseases associated with aberrant angiogenesis; the enhanced collagen remodelling associated with diabetes, periodontal disease (such as gingivitis), cornea! ulceration, ulceration of the skin, post-operative conditions (such as colonic anastomosis) and dermal wound healing; demyelinating diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems (such as multiple sclerosis); age related illness such as dementia, inflammatory diseases of cardiovascular origins; granulomatous diseases; renal diseases including but not limited to nephritis and polyarteritis; cancer; pulmonary hypertension, ingested poisons, skin contacts, stings, bites; asthma; rhinitis; HIV disease progression; for minimising the effects of organ rejection in organ transplantation including but not limited to human organs; and replacement therapy of proteinase inhibitors.<br>
Thus, another aspect of the invention provides the use of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of diseases or conditions in which inhibition of neutrophil elastase activity is beneficial; and a method of treating, or reducing the risk of, diseases or conditions in which inhibition of neutropliil elastase activity is beneficial which comprises administering to a person suffering from or at risk of, said disease or condition, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides the use of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of inflammatory diseases or conditions; and a method of treating, or reducing the risk of, inflammatory diseases or conditions which comprises administering to a person suffering from or at risk of, said disease or condition, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula 00 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
In particular, the^ompounds of this invention may be used in the treatment t&gt;f adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cystic fibrosis, pulmonary emphysema, chronic<br>
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension, asthma, rhinitis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, cancer, atherosclerosis and gastric mucosal injury.<br>
Prophylaxis is expected to be particularly relevant to the treatment of persons who have suffered a previous episode of, or are otherwise considered to be at increased risk of, the disease or condition in question. Persons at risk of developing a particular disease or condition generally include those having a family history of the disease or condition, or those who have been identified by genetic testing or screening to be particularly susceptible to developing the disease or condition.<br>
For the above mentioned therapeutic indications, the dose of the compound to be administered will depend on the compound employed, the disease being treated, the mode of administration, the age, weight and sex of the patient. Such factors, may be determined by the attending physician. However, in general, satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds are administered to a human at a daily dosage of between 0.1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg (measured as the active ingredient).<br>
Hie compounds of formula CO may be used on their own, or in the form of appropriate<br>
\,     J<br>
pharmaceutical formulations comprising the compound of the invention in combination with a phannaceutically acceptable diluent, adjuvant or carrier. Particularly preferred are compositions not containing material capable of causing an adverse reaction, for example, an allergic reaction. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable pharmaceutical formulations are described in, for example, "Pharmaceuticals - The Science of Dosage Form Designs", M. E. Aulton, Churchill Livingstone, 1988.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical formulation comprising preferably less than 95% by weight and more preferably less than 50% by weight of a compound of formula (I) in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
We also provide a method of preparation of such pharmaceutical formulations that comprises mixing the ingredients.<br>
The compounds may be administered topically, for example, to the lungs and/or the airways, in the form of solutions, suspensions, HFA aerosols or dry powder formulations, for example, formulations in the inhaler device known as the Turbuhaler*; or systemically, for example, by oral administration in the form of tablets, pills, capsules, syrups, powders or granules; or by parenteral administration, for example, in the form of sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions; or by rectal administration, for example, in the form of suppositories.<br>
Dry powder formulations and pressurized HFA, aerosols of the compounds of the invention may be administered by oral or nasal inhalation. For inhalation, the compound is desirably finely divided. The finely divided compound preferably has a mass median diameter of less than 10 i*m, and may be suspended in a propellaut mixture with the assistance of a dispersant, such as a Cg-Cao fatty acid or salt thereof, (for example, oleic acid), a bile salt, a phospholipid, an alkyl saccharide, a perfluorinated or polyethoxyiated surfactant, or other pharmaceutically acceptable dispersant.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be administered by means of a dry powder inhaler. The inhaler may be a single or a multi dose inhaler, and may be a breath actuated dry powder inhaler.<br>
One possibility is to mix the finely divided compound with a carrier substance, for example, a mono-, di- or polysaccharide, a sugar alcohol, or an other polyol. Suitable carriers are sugars, for example, lactose, glucose, raffinose, melezitose, lactitol, maltitol, trehalose, sucrose, mannitol; and starch. Alternatively the finely divided compound may be coated by another substance. The powder mixture may also be dispensed into hard gelatine capsules, each containing the desired dose of the active compound.<br>
Another possibility is to process the finely divided powder into spheres which break up during the inhalation procedure. This spheronized powder may be filled into the drug-reservoir of a multidose inhaler, for example, that Icnown as the Turbuhaler* in which a dosing unit meters the desired dose which is then inhaled by the patient. With this system the active compound, with or without a carrier substance, is delivered to the patient<br>
For oral administration the active compound may be admixed with an adjuvant or a carrier, for example, lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol; a starch, for example, potato starch, corn starch or aroylopecthi; a cellulose derivative; a binder, for example, gelatine or poly vinylpyrrolidone; and/or a lubricant, for example, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, polyethylene glycol, a wax, paraffin, and the like, and then compressed into tablets. If coated tablets are required, the cores, prepared as described above, may be coated with a concentrated sugar solution which may contain, for example, gum arabicy gelatine, talcum, titanium dioxide, and the like. Alternatively, the tablet may be coated with a suitable polymer dissolved in a readily volatile organic solvent<br>
For the preparation of soft gelatine capsules, the compound may be admixed with, for example, a vegetable oil or polyethylene glycol. Hard gelatine capsules may contain granules of the compound using either the above mentioned excipients for tablets. Also liquid or semisolid formulations of the drug may be filled into hard gelatine capsules.<br>
Liquid preparations for oral application may be in the form of syrups or suspensions, for example, solutions containing the compound, the balance being sugar and a mixture of ethanol, water, glycerol and propylene glycol. Optionally such liquid preparations may contain colouring agents, flavouring agents, saccharine and/or carboxymethylcellulose as a thickening agent or other excipients known to those skilled in art.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be administered in conjunction with other compounds used for the treatment of the above conditions.<br>
