				<td>DESCRIPTION CHOLESTEROL ABSORPTION INHIBITOR<br>
Technical Field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to bacteria belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium which have an excellent effect of inhibiting the cholesterol absorption, and a cholesterol absorption inhibitor containing these bacteria belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium as an active ingredient.<br>
Background Art [0002]<br>
Cholesterols exist in many cells and primarily play physiological roles of maintaining cellular functions as components of lipoproteins or biological membranes, serving as raw material for bile acid and various hormones, and the like. However, it is known that increased serum cholesterol levels resulting from excessive intake of foods with a high content of cholesterols lead to arteriosclerosis. In the modern dietary life with many opportunities of taking cholesterols, it is required to suppress the concentration of cholesterols in the body. [0003]<br>
Furthermore, it has been reported that bacterial cells of Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium adolescent is, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis, and Bifidobacterium longum have blood lipid ameliorating effects (Patent Document 1).  In particular, Bifidobacterium longum has been well studied, and reports have shown that Bifidobacterium longum SET 2933R (PERM P-8743) has excellent effects (Non-patent Document 1), and use of cells of this bacterium or a culture thereof as a serum cholesterol elevation inhibitor has been proposed (Patent Document 2).  In general, however, bacteria belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium are weak against oxygen as well as gastric acid and bile acid in the body. Therefore, there is a problem that, when cells of this bacterium or a culture thereof is orally taken, the cells have a poor survival ability in the gastrointestinal tract and show inadequate effects in many cases. Accordingly, bacteria belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium which have an excellent survival ability and a serum cholesterol elevation inhibiting effect have been desired. [0004]<br>
However, it is only known about such bacteria belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium having an excellent survival ability that Bifidobacterium longum SET 10254 (PERM P-14820) (Patent Document 3) and Bifidobacterium longum (PERM BP-7787) (Patent Document 4)<br>
have an excellent survival ability and show a serum cholesterol elevation inhibiting effect, that Bifidobacterium longum BB536, Bifidobacterium breve ATCC 15700, and Bifidobacterium animalis ATCC 25527 (Non-patent Document 2) show a cholesterol sedimentation effect, and the like.  In the current situation, there are few options of microorganisms which have an excellent survival ability and a cholesterol inhibiting effect. [0005]<br>
Furthermore, since it is often inevitable to store drugs or foods using these microorganisms for a long period, high storage stability is required. However, known microorganisms have a poor survival ability after long-term storage, and many of them have a poor survival ability, particularly, under a non-anaerobic condition. [Patent Document 1] JP-A-61-271223 [Patent Document 2] JP-B-6-96537 [Patent Document 3] JP-B-3384907 [Patent Document 4] JP-A-2003-238423<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0006]<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a bacterium belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium which shows an excellent survival ability in the gastrointestinal tract, has effects of inhibiting the cholesterol absorption in the intestinal tract, is excellent in lipid metabolism ameliorating effects including decreasing the blood cholesterol level, and shows a high survival rate after storage, and a cholesterol absorption inhibitor using the same.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems [0007]<br>
The inventors of the present invention conducted various researches to achieve the foregoing object. As a result, they surprisingly found that Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis YIT 10394, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 1253, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 7117, and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum are excellent in cholesterol eliminating effects, show potent acid tolerance and bile acid tolerance, further have an excellent effect of inhibiting cholesterol absorption in the intestines, and show a high survival ability after storage, in particular, a high survival rate after storage even under a non-anaerobic condition. Thus, the present invention was accomplished. Of the microorganisms used in the present invention, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis YIT 10394,<br>
Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10392, and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10393 are microorganisms newly discovered by the inventors of the present invention. [0008]<br>
Specifically, the present invention provides a cholesterol absorption inhibitor comprising, as an active ingredient, at least one microorganism selected from Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis YIT 10394, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 1253, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 7117, and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum. [0009]<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides a cholesterol absorption inhibitor comprising, as an active ingredient, at least one microorganism selected from Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 1253 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 7117. [0010]<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides a cholesterol absorption inhibitor comprising, as an active ingredient, at least one microorganism selected from Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis YIT 10394, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10392, and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10393 . [0011]<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides novel microorganisms, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis YIT 10394 (PERM ABP-10662), Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10392 (PERM ABP-10660), and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10393 (PERM ABP-10661). [0012]<br>
Since Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis YIT 10394, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 1253, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 7117, and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum of the present invention not only have an excellent cholesterol eliminating effect but also are excellent in acid tolerance and bile-acid tolerance, they also show an excellent effect of inhibiting the cholesterol absorption in the intestines and can be utilized for the purpose of ameliorating the lipid metabolism, for example, decreasing the blood cholesterol level.  Furthermore, since these microorganisms have a high survival rate after storage, in particular, a high survival rate even after storage under a non-anaerobic condition, the cholesterol absorption inhibitor of the present invention can be stored for a long period as well as under a non-anaerobic condition.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention [0013]<br>
Examples of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum used in the present invention include Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10392 and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10393. [0014]<br>
These Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10392, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10393, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis YIT 10394, one of the microorganisms used in the present invention, are novel bacterial strains isolated by the inventors of the present invention as bacterial strains having properties such as showing a cholesterol eliminating activity of 70% or higher, a survival rate of 20% or higher in an artificial gastric juice, and a proliferation rate of 100 or higher, as a Klett value (bacterial cell turbidity), in a bile-acid-containing medium. These bacterial strains have the following microbiological properties. Specifically, all these bacterial strains are Gram-positive polymorphic bacilli which are nonspore-forming, nonmotile, and obligate anaerobic, can grow at 37°C, and show properties of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis, respectively, in this order, apart from the cholesterol eliminating activity, the survival rate in an artificial gastric<br>
juice, and the proliferation rate in a bile-acid-containing medium shown above. [0015]<br>
The species of these novel bacterial strains were identified based on the findings in the bacterial species identification using 16S rDNA nucleotide sequence that the 16S rDNA nucleotide sequence of YIT 10392 shows a homology of 99.6% with that of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum (Accession No. D86194), the 16S rDNA nucleotide sequence of YIT 10393 shows a homology of 99.6% with that of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum (Accession No. D86194), and the 16S rDNA nucleotide sequence of YIT 10394 shows a homology of 99.7% with that of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis (Accession No. D86185). Here, the bacterial species identification using 16S rDNA nucleotide sequence was performed by amplifying the full-length of a 16S rDNA sequence by PCR using, as a template, DNA extracted from bacterial cells obtained by centrifugal washing of bacterial solution cultured anaerobically (carbon dioxide substitution) using a 0.5%-glucose-added GAM medium at 37°C for 24 hours, determining the nucleotide sequence of the amplification product by the dye terminator method, and searching the obtained nucleotide sequence in a database. Furthermore, these bacterial strains were determined to be novel based on the findings that their 16S rDNA nucwere different from those of the type strains, and the results of chromosome DMA polymorphism analysis by the Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) method were different. [0016]<br>
Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis YIT 10394, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10392, and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10393 were transferred as Accession Nos. PERM ABP-10662, PERM ABP-10660 and PERM ABP-10661, respectively, to International Patent Organism Depositary, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology on August 14, 2006. These microorganisms had been deposited at the same organization on August 18, 2005 before the transfer. The postal address of this depositary is zip code 305-8566, Tsukuba Central 6, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. [0017]<br>
Furthermore, both Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 1253 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 7117 used in the present invention can be purchased from Japan Collection of Microorganisms (JCM) and American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and ATCC numbers thereof are ATCC 27536 and ATCC 27674, respectively. [0018]<br>
these, a microorganism whose survival rate is 50% or higher when a fermented milk food or drink produced<br>
using the microorganism is stored at 10°C for 21 days under a non-anaerobic (aerobic) condition is preferred as the microorganism used in the present invention.<br>
[0019]<br>
Furthermore, as the microorganisms of the present invention, bacteria belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium with a cholesterol eliminating activity of 70% or higher are preferred, and bacteria belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium with a cholesterol eliminating activity of 70% or higher, a survival rate of 20% or higher in an artificial gastric juice, and a proliferation rate of 100 or higher, as the Klett value<br>
(bacterial cell turbidity), in a bile-acid-containing medium are more preferred. Common bacteria belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium, have a survival rate of about 0 to several percents in an artificial gastric juice and a proliferation rate of about 0 to several tens, as the Klett value (bacterial cell turbidity), in a bile-acid-containing medium. Many cells of bacteria having high acid tolerance and bile acid tolerance which are selected based on the above-mentioned value can reach the intestines in a viable state. [0020]<br>
Here, the cholesterol eliminating activity can be calculated by, for example, measuring the cholesterol<br>
level in the supernatant according to a usual method after microorganism cells are allowed to stand together with artificial lipid micelles, comparing with the cholesterol level in a supernatant not containing bacterial cells, and inserting the values into the following equation.<br>
Cholesterol eliminating activity (%) = 100 -(cholesterol level in supernatant containing bacterial cells)/(cholesterol level in supernatant not containing bacterial cells) x 100 [0021]<br>
Furthermore, the survival rate in an artificial gastric juice can be defined as, for example, the survival rate after storage in an artificial gastric<br>
juice of pH 3.0 at 37°C for 1 hour. When this value is high, it means that the survival rate in the gastrointestinal tract is high. [0022]<br>
Furthermore, the proliferation rate in a bile-acid-containing medium can be defined as, for example, turbidity upon culture in a medium containing 0.2% bile<br>
acid at 37°C for 24 hours expressed with a Klett value (Klett-Summerson Colorimeter, No.66 Filter). When this value is high, the survival rate and the proliferation rate in the gastrointestinal tract are high. [0023]<br>
Since genus, species, and strain names of a microorganism vary depending on the person who designated the microorganism and are also uncertain due to reclassifications of bacteria or the like, microorganisms which are substantially identical are included in the microorganisms of the present invention even though they have different genus, species, or bacterial strain names. Specifically, for example, although Bifidobacterium animalis and Bifidobacterium lactis have been regarded as separate species, Masco et al. have collectively classified these microorganisms as Bifidobacterium animalis, which is further divided into two subspecies, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, as subclasses (Int. J. Syst. Envoi. Microbiol. 54, 1137-1143, 2004). This classification remains to date. Therefore, bacteria used to be referred to as Bifidobacterium animalis and Bifidobacterium lactis also fall within the scope of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, respectively, of the present invention. [0024]<br>
Furthermore, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis ATCC 27536 is identical to Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 1253, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis ATCC 27674 is identical to Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 7117. All of these are<br>
included in the microorganisms of the present invention. All these bacterial strains are classified as Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis in JCM and ATCC. However, since the 16S rDNA nucleotide sequences of these two bacterial strains 100% matched those of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (Accession No. X89513) , these strains are classified as Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis in the present invention. [0025]<br>
Since the microorganisms of the present invention have a cholesterol eliminating activity and decrease the cholesterol level, in particular, the blood cholesterol level as shown in the examples described later, agents containing these microorganisms in an effective amount are useful as cholesterol absorption inhibitors, in particular, as inhibitors of cholesterol absorption from the intestinal tract.  It is expected that the cholesterol absorption inhibitor of the present invention can be used for decreasing the levels of blood cholesterols, triglyceride, and VLDL and LDL cholesterols, and the arteriosclerosis index, ameliorating the lipid metabolism including elevating HDL cholesterol, ameliorating hyperlipemia, which often develops due to postmenopausal lack of female sex hormones, and decreasing a risk of developing arteriosclerosis. [0026]<br>
Furthermore, since the microorganisms of the present invention show acid tolerance and bile-acid tolerance as shown in the examples described later, agents containing these microorganisms in an effective amount can be used as cholesterol absorption inhibitors for oral administration. [0027]<br>
Furthermore, since the microorganisms of the present invention have a high survival ability even after storage in a fermented milk food or drink under an aerobic (non-anaerobic) condition as shown in the examples described later, agents containing these microorganisms in an effective amount can be used as cholesterol absorption inhibitors stored under an aerobic (non-anaerobic) condition. The storage temperature can be set at, for example, -80 to 10°C. [0028]<br>
It is sufficient that the cholesterol absorption inhibitor of the present invention comprises, as an active ingredient, at least one microorganism selected from Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis YIT 10394, Blfldobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 1253, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 7117, and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum. Examples of a combination of microorganisms used here include at least one combination selected from Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 1253 and Bifidobacterium<br><br>
animalis subsp. lactis JCM 7117 and at least one combination selected from Blfidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis YIT 10394, Blfidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10392, and Blfidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10393.<br>
[0029]<br>
Furthermore, the cholesterol absorption inhibitor of the present invention uses Blfidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis YIT 10394, Blfidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 1253, Blfidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 7117, and Blfidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum solely or in combination or can use these microorganisms in combination with other microorganisms.

[0030]<br>
Further, the microorganisms contained in the cholesterol absorption inhibitor of the present invention may be lyophilized or utilized as a culture containing these microorganisms.  In any form, it is preferable that microorganisms are in the state of viable cells. [0031]<br>

Furthermore, commonly used additives such as stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, binders, and isotonizing agents can be suitably added as required. [0032]<br>
Furthermore, the cholesterol absorption inhibitor of the present invention can be taken as the above-mentioned microorganisms as they are, by adding directly to a food, or in the form of a food or drink. Preferred examples of the food or drink include fermented milk, fermented soy milk, fermented fruit juice, fermented plant juice, fermented rice juice, fermented wort, and fermented foods and drinks using materials derived from animals or plants (pickles, fermented soybean paste, soy sauce, fermented tea, fermented sausages, fermented mayonnaise, cheese, salted fish guts, etc.) which comprise the microorganisms of the present invention in the state of viable cells. The food or drink can be manufactured by a usual method. For example, when fermented milk is manufactured, first, a fermented milk base is obtained by inoculating and culturing at least one of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis YIT 10394, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp.<br>
lactis JCM 1253, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 7117, and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum solely or together with other microorganisms in a sterilized milk medium, and homogenizing the medium. Then, a separately prepared syrup solution is added and mixed, and the mixture is homogenized with a homogenizer or the like, and a flavor is further added to complete a final product. The fermented milk of the present invention thus obtained can be prepared as a product in any form such as of a plain type, soft type, or fruit flavor type, in a solid, liquid, or frozen state, or the like. Animal feeds are also included in the food or drink. The microorganism of the present invention in fermented milk can be contained, for example, at a concentration of 103 to 1013 cfu/mL. [0033]<br>

[0037]<br>
To improve the survival ability in fermented milk foods or drinks using bacteria belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium during storage, containers made of oxygen-impermeable package materials such as glass and aluminum coated paper have been mainly used. As shown in the examples below, however, the microorganisms of the present invention have high oxygen tolerance and do not require a strictly anaerobic condition. Therefore, as container materials for the cholesterol absorption<br>
highly oxygen-permeable resins (polystyrene, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, etc.) can also be used. Containers using these resins are inexpensive and have advantages such as high degree of freedom in molding as compared with containers made of oxygen-impermeable package materials. [0038]<br>
The microorganisms used as an active ingredient of the cholesterol absorption inhibitor of the present invention show excellent acid tolerance as shown in the examples below.. Therefore, the cholesterol absorption inhibitor of the present invention can be made acidic. For example, its pH at 25°C can be set to 2 to 7, in particular, 3 to 6. [0039]<br>
The bacteria belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium used as an active ingredient of the cholesterol absorption inhibitor of the present invention have been utilized as food, and safety of these bacteria has been confirmed. Therefore, doses of these bacteria when used as a cholesterol absorption inhibitor are not strictly limited, but are preferably 105 to 1013 cfu, particularly preferably 108 to 1012 cfu per day as a viable cell count.<br>
Examples [0040]<br>
The present invention will be explained more specifically with reference to the following examples. However, the scope of the present invention is not limited to these examples. Test Example 1 (1) Cholesterol eliminating activity<br>
Bacterial cells were anaerobically cultured in m-ILS medium (Int. J. Food Microbiol. 81. 131-136, 2003) at 37°C for 24 hours, the culture broth was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm and 4°C for 15 minutes, and the bacterial cells were washed with 150 mM phosphate buffer (pH 5.5). The centrifugal washing was repeated three times, and the bacterial cells were suspended in 150 mM phosphate buffer to give turbidity (absorbance at 660 nm) of 3 (bacterial cell count of 108-109 cfu/mL) to prepare a bacterial cell suspension. The bacterial cell suspension was further<br>
autoclaved at 121°C for 15 minutes to prepare a dead bacterial cell suspension.<br>
2 g of bovine bile powder, 921 mg of cholesterol, 135 mg of lysophosphatidylcholine, 90.2 mg of monooleic acid, and 702.2 mg of oleic acid were suspended in 150 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), the suspension was ultrasonicated for 12 minutes and then ultracentrifuged<br>
at 100,000 G and 25°C for 18 hours, and a micelle layer was collected to prepare artificial lipid micelles.  150<br>
jiL of artificial lipid micelles per mL of the bacterial cell suspension (bacterial cell count of 108-109 cfu) was<br><br>
added, and the suspension was allowed to stand at 37°C. After 18 hours, the suspension was centrifuged at 12,000<br>
rpm and 4°C for 15 minutes, and cholesterols in the supernatant were quantified using Determiner TC555 (Kyowa Medics Co., Ltd.). A phosphate buffer containing no bacterial cell was similarly treated as a control, and the cholesterol eliminating activity was calculated by the following equation. Furthermore, the cholesterol eliminating activity was similarly calculated for the dead bacterial cell suspension.<br>
Cholesterol eliminating activity (%) = 100 - (cholesterol level in supernatant containing bacterial cells)/(cholesterol level in supernatant containing no bacterial cells) x 100 [0041]<br>
(2)	Acid tolerance<br>
0.1 ml of bacterial solution cultured in GAM medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) to the stationary phase was added to 10 ml of 50 mM Na2HP04 solution adjusted to pH 3 with hydrochloric acid, and the mixture was treated<br>
at 37°C for 1 hour, and the survival rate was calculated<br>
by the following equation.<br>
Survival rate (%) = (viable cell count after acid<br>
treatment)/(viable cell count before acid treatment) x<br>
100<br>
[0042]<br>
(3)	Bile acid tolerance<br>
30 H.L of bacterial solution cultured in GAM medium to the stationary phase was inoculated in 3 mL of GAM medium containing 0.2% bile acid and anaerobically cultured at 37°C. After 24 hours, the bacterial cell turbidity was measured using Klett-Summerson Colorimeter (No. 66 Filter). [0043]<br>
The test results of the above (1) to (3) are shown in Table 1.<br>
 [0044]<br>
[Table 1]<br>
Results of determination of cholesterol eliminating activity, acid tolerance, and bile-acid tolerance of bacterium<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
NT: not tested<br>
-: It was determined by visual examination that virtually no bacteria had grown in the bile-acid-added GAM medium<br>
in examination of bile-acid tolerance.<br>
0045]<br>
As shown in Table 1, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum of the present invention showed a high cholesterol eliminating activity and were excellent in acid tolerance and bile-acid tolerance. Furthermore, since dead bacterial cells did not have a cholesterol eliminating activity, it was found that these bacteria show the activity in a viable cell state.<br>
[0046]<br>
Subsequently, to find out whether elimination of cholesterols from the supernatant resulted from precipitation, or conversion or degradation, the cholesterol level in the precipitate portion was measured. As a result, it was found that cholesterols eliminated from the supernatant were not converted or degraded and existed in the precipitate. This result suggested the possibility that cholesterols in the supernatant might have been taken up into bacterial cells and precipitated, or lipid micelles might have been disintegrated by the bile acid deconjugating effect of bacterial cells or the like and precipitated. [0047]<br>
Test Example 2: Effects on blood lipid and hepatic lipids in animals<br>
A 10% powdered skim milk medium containing 0.03% yeast extract were sterilized at 121°C for 15 minutes, and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10393 was inoculated at 1% and anaerobically cultured for 24 hours. This culture broth was inoculated at 2% in the same medium and anaerobically cultured at 37°C for 46 to 54 hours. The count of viable cells contained in the fermented milk thus prepared was 3.7 x 108 cfu/ml. This fermented milk was lyophilized, and a feed was prepared with a composition shown in Table 2. Here, the viable cell count in the feed was 1.0 x lo6 cfu/g. Meanwhile, as a control, a 10% powdered skim milk medium containing 0.03% yeast extract was sterilized at 121°C for 15 minutes and then lyophilized without inoculating bacteria as unfermented milk, and a feed was prepared with a composition shown in Table 2. [0048]<br>
[Table  2]<br>
Composition of  feed given to animals(%)(Table Removed)<br>
 [0049]<br>
Subsequently, after 1 week of preliminary breeding, 8-week-old Wistar ovariectomized rats (purchased from Japan SLC) or sham rats were habituated to AIN-93G purified diet for 1 week and divided into the experimental groups shown in Table 3 depending on the body weight.<br>
[0050]<br>
 [Table 3] Experimental groups<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Sham: animals that underwent sham operation, OVX: animals that underwent ovariectomy, SM: unfermented milk, FSM: fermented milk<br>
[0051]<br>
The rats thus grouped were bred in individual bracket cages using the test feeds at room temperature of<br>
24 ± 1°C and humidity of 55 + 5% with the feed corresponding to each group and water available ad libitum for 34 days. The daily intake of viable cells was about 107 cfu/animal.<br>
The animals were anesthetized with Nembutal. Food was withheld for 4h before death. Blood was collected from the aorta ventralis, and the liver was collected under reflux. The liver was stored at -20°C before analysis, and blood was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes to separate plasma. After lyophilization, the liver was extracted by the method of Folch (J. Biol. Chem. 226, 497-509, 1957).<br>
The levels of total cholesterol and triglyceride contained in the plasma and liver extract thus obtained<br>
were obtained using Determiner TC555 (Kyowa Medics Co., Ltd.) and Triglyceride E-test Wako (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), respectively. Further, the level of HDL cholesterol contained in plasma was obtained using HDL-cholesterol E-test Wako (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) . Further, the level of VLDL + LDL cholesterol contained in plasma was obtained by deducting the HDL cholesterol level from the total cholesterol level.<br>
Based on the obtained results, p value was obtained for the ovariectomy group by two-way analysis of variance. Further, t test was performed between the ovariectomized rats and the sham rats, both of which given same feed. The obtained results are shown in Tables 4 to 6. The<br>
values were expressed with mean ± SD. In Tables 4 to 6, the term "interaction" means an interaction between fermented milk and galactooligosaccharide.<br>

rats had more body weight and ingested more food as compared with the sham group, as previously reported (J. Comp. Physiol. Physicol 88: 183-193, 1975). However, effects of the presence or absence of oligosaccharide or administration of fermented milk were not observed in the ovariectomy group, and the animals grew favorably.<br>

NS: No significance<br>
 [0054]<br>
Furthermore, as shown in Table 5, effects of<br>
fermented milk prepared using Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10393 were observed in cholesterols, triglyceride, VLDL + LDL cholesterol in blood and the arteriosclerosis index, and all these parameters decreased.  In particular, the VLDL + LDL cholesterol level markedly decreased. Furthermore, although effects of oligosaccharide on these parameters and an interaction between fermented milk and oligosaccharide were not statistically significant, the levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, and VLDL + LDL cholesterol in blood, and the arteriosclerosis index were the lowest in the animals treated with oligosaccharide and fermented milk. It is known that galactooligosaccharide is utilized specifically by bacteria belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium. Therefore, it was demonstrated that Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10393 grows in the intestinal tract and decreases blood lipid levels effectively by administering fermented milk containing galactooligosaccharide. Furthermore, it is known that total blood cholesterol is elevated after ovariectomy, and an animal that underwent ovariectomy is useful as a postmenopausal hyperlipemia model. Comparison of data of the ovariectomy/unfermented milk/without oligosaccharide<br>
group and the sham group showed that ovariectomy in this test had been successful.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
*, ** : A significant difference was observed between the sham/unfermented milk/without oligosaccharide group and the ovariectomy/unfermented milk/without oligosaccharide group on a level of significance of 0.05 or 0.01.<br>
NS: No significance<br>
As shown in Table 6, the cholesterol content in the liver was not affected by the presence of oligosaccharide or administration of fermented milk, and lipids were not accumulated in the liver. A statistical significance was not observed in the triglyceride level per liver after administration of fermented milk, but the triglyceride content per g of the liver decreased.<br>
Since the fermented milk prepared using Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10393 decreased the total cholesterol, triglyceride, and VLDL + LDL cholesterol levels in blood and the arteriosclerosis index as shown above, it was found that this bacterium has a lipid metabolism ameliorating ability for not only cholesterol but various blood lipids and an effect of decreasing a risk of developing arteriosclerosis. [0057]<br>
Test Example 3: Examination of survival ability in fermented milk<br>
0.03% yeast extract was added to 10% powdered skim milk solution, and the mixture was sterilized, each of the bacteria of the present invention (Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis YIT 10394, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 1253, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 7117, and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10392, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10393) was inoculated at 2% and<br>
cultured at 37°C to pH 5.1 + 1.0, produced five kinds of fermented milk. Furthermore, as a control, a fermented milk was produced in the same manner using Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707.<br>
10 ml each of the prepared fermented milk was poured into a glass test tube for anaerobic storage and a polypropylene tube for non-anaerobic (aerobic) storage<br>
and stored at 10°C for 12 weeks. For anaerobic storage, the test tube was stoppered tightly with a butyl rubber plug under a nitrogen gas flow. For non-anaerobic storage, the lid of the polypropylene tube was closed loosely. Table 7 shows pH and viable cell count after the completion of culture. Table 8 shows changes in the bacterial cell count in non-anaerobic storage. Table 9 shows changes in the bacterial cell count in anaerobic storage.<br>

 [0061]<br>
As shown, in Table 8, after 3 weeks of storage under non-anaerobic (aerobic) condition, Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707 used as a control was decreased to 9.2 x 103 cfu/mL and was not detected after 8 weeks. On the other hand, no bacterial strain of the present invention was decreased to below 1 x 108 cfu/mL even after 3 weeks of storage, and the survival rate was 50% or higher as compared with the cell count at completion of the culture. Furthermore, after 12 weeks of storage, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 1253 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 7117 were not below 1 x 108 cfu/mL, and the remaining three bacterial strains<br>
(Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10392, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10393, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis YIT 10394) were decreased only by about 1 to 2 orders.<br>
As shown in Table 9, after 3 weeks of storage under anaerobic condition, the bacterial cell count of Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707 decreased to about 1/10. However, the bacterial cell counts of the Bifidobacterium bacteria of the present invention at the completion of culture were virtually maintained. The bacterial•cell counts of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10392, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum YIT 10393, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis YIT 10394 decreased only to about 1/2 to 1/6 after<br>
storage for 12 weeks, and the bacterial cell counts of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 1253 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis JCM 7117 remained virtually unchanged even after 12 weeks. [0062] Prescription Example 1: Production of tablet<br>
