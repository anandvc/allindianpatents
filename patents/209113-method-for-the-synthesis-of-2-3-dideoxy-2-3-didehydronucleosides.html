				<td>METHOD FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF 2'3'DIDEOXY-2',3'-DIDEHYDRONUCLEOSIDES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is a novel process for the synthesis of β-D and β-L-2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxy-nucleosides ("D4" nucleosides), and in particular β-D-2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluorocytidine (β-D-D4FC), useful as antiviral agents and chemotherapeutics.<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application nos. 60/272,434 and 60/272,441, both filed on March 1, 2001.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In 1981, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) was identified as a disease that severely compromises the human immune system. In 1983, the etiological cause of AIDS was determined to be the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Reverse transcription is a common feature of retrovirus replication. Viral replication requires a viral ly encoded reverse transcriptase to generate DNA copies of viral sequences by reverse transcription of the viral RNA genome. Reverse transcriptase, therefore, is a clinically relevant target for the chemotherapy of retroviral infections because the inhibition of virally encoded reverse transcriptase would interrupt viral replication.<br>
A number of compounds are effective in the treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which is the retrovirus that causes progressive destruction of the human immune system with the resultant onset of AIDS. Effective treatment through inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase is known for both nucleoside based inhibitors and non-nuclcoside based inhibitors. Nucleoside based HIV inhibitors in the treatment of AIDS. In 1985, it was reported that the synthetic nucleoside 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) inhibits the replication of human immunodeficiency virus.<br><br>
Since then, a number of other synthetic nucleosides, including 3'-azidoguanosine (AZG), 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC), 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine (ddA), S'-fluoro-S'-deoxythymidine (FDDT) and 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddl) have been proven to be effective against HIV. After cellular phosphorylation to the 5'-triphosphate by cellular kinases, these synthetic nucleosides are incorporated into a growing strand of viral DNA, causing chain termination due to the absence of the 3'-hydroxyl group. They can also inhibit the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase.<br>
The success of various synthetic nucleosides in inhibiting the replication of HIV in vivo or in vitro has led a number of researchers to design and test nucleosides that substitute a heteroatom for the carbon atom at the 3'-position of the nucleoside. Norbeck, et al., disclosed that (±)-l-[(2p,4p)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-4-dioxolanyl]thymine (referred to as (±)-dioxolane-T) exhibits a modest activity against HIV (ECso of 20 ^M in ATH8 cells), and is not toxic to uninfected control cells at a concentration of 200 µM. Tetrahedron Letters 30 (46), 6246, (1989). European Patent Application Publication No. 0 337 713 and U.S. Patent No. 5,041,449, assigned to BioChem Pharma, Inc., disclose racemic 2-substituted-4-substituted-l,3-dioxolanes that exhibit antiviral activity.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,047,407 and European Patent Application Publication No. 0 382 526, also assigned to BioChem Pharma, Inc., disclose that a number of racemic 2-substituted-5-substituted-l,3-oxathiolane nucleosides have antiviral activity, and. specifically report that the racemic mixture of 2-hydroxymethyl-5-(cytosin-l-yl)-l;3-oxathiolane (referred to below as BCH-189) has approximately the same activity against HIV as AZT, and little toxicity. BCH-189 has also been found to inhibit the replication of AZT-resistant HIV isolates in vitro from patients who have been treated with AZT for longer than 36 weeks. The (-)-enantiomer of the (3-isomer of BCH-189, known as 3TC, which is highly potent against HIV and exhibits little toxicity, has been approved for the treatment of HIV in humans by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in combination with AZT.<br>
It has also been disclosed that cis-2-hydroxymethyl-5-(5-fluorocytosin-l-yl)-l,3-oxathiolane ("FTC") has potent HIV activity. Schinazi, et al., "Selective Inhibition of Human Immunodeficiency viruses by Racemates and Enantiomers of eis-5-Fluoro-l~[2-(Hydroxymethy 1)-1.3 -Oxathiolane-5-yl]Cytosine" Antimicrobial Agents and Chemo-<br><br>

A number of 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydro-nucleosides have been shown to have potent anti-HIV-1 activity. 2',3'-Dideoxy-2',3'-didehydro-thymidine ("D4T"; also referred to as l-(2,3-dideoxy-β-D-glycero-pent-2-eno-raranosyl)thymine) is currently sold for the treatment of HTV under the name Stavudine by Bristol Myers Squibb. Other D4 nucleosides that have been tested include 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3:-didehydro-cytidine ("D4C"), 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3s-didehydro-uridine ("D4U"), 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydro-adenosine ("D4A"), 2\3'-dideoxy-2\3'-didehydro-inosine ("D4I"), and 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3 '-didehydro-guanosine ("D4G").<br>
Other 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydronucleosides have been reported to be effective against HIV and/or HBV. Starrett, Jr. et al., in U.S. Patent No. 4,904,770, and U.S. Patent No. 5,130,421, and Skonezny et al., in U.S. Patent No. 5,539,099, disclose processes for the preparation of compounds of formula:<br>

U.S. Patent No. 6,232,300 and International Patent Application No. PCT/US96/00965, published as WO 96/22778 discloses a method for the treatment of HIV using P-D-D4FC. U.S. Patent No. 5,703,058 discloses a method for the treatment of HIV and HBV infection that includes administering an effective amount of P-L-D4FC in combination or alternation with cis-2-hydroxymethyl-5-(5-fluorocytosin-l-yl)-l,3-oxathiolane, cis-2-hydroxymethyl-5-(cytosin-l-yl)-l ,3-oxathiolane, 9-[4-(hydroxy-methyl)-2-cyclopenten-1 -yl)-guanine (carbovir), 9-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]guanine (acyclovir), interferon, 3'-deoxy-3'-azido-thymidine (AZT), 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (DDI), 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (DDC), (-)-2'-fluoro-5-methyl-β-L-ara-uridine (L-FMAU) or 2\3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (D4T). U.S. Patent No. 5,905,070 discloses a method for the treatment of HIV and HBV infection that includes administering an effective amount of β-D-D4FC in combination or alternation with cis-2-hydroxymethyl-5-(5-fluorocytosin-l -yl)-1,3-oxathiolane, cis-2-hydroxymethyl-5-(cytosin-l-yl)-l ,3-oxathiolane, 9-[4-(hydroxymethyl)-2-cyclopcnten-l-yl)-guanine (carbovir), 9-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]guanine (acyclovir), interferon, 3:-deoxy-3'-azido-thymidine<br>
(AZT),   2',3'-dideoxyinosine   (DDI),   2'3'-dideoxycytidine   (DDC),   (-)-2'-fluoro-5-methyl-β-L-ara-uridme (L-FMAU) or 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (D4T).<br>
European Patent Application Publication No. 0 409 227 A2 filed by Ajinomoto Co., Inc., discloses P-D-D4FC (Example 2) and its use to treat hepatitis B. Netherlands Patent No. 8901258 filed by Stichting Rega V.Z.W. discloses generally 5-halogeno-2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrocytidine derivatives for use in treating HIV and hepatitis B ("HBV").<br>
Due to the importance of 2'.3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydro-nucleosides, and in particular, β-D-3'-didehydro-2,3'-dideoxy-5-fluorocytidine ("β-D-D4FC'), as potent antihuman immunodeficiency virus agents, there is a need for a commercial or industrial scale process for the synthesis of 2,3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydro-nucleosides, and in particular, p-D-D4FC. On addition, natural and unnatural D4 nucleosides can serve as synthetic intermediates for the preparation of a large variety of other nucleoside analogs, including but not limited to 2'.3'-dideoxy, and 2' or 3'-deoxyribo-nucleoside analogs as well as additional derivatives obtained by subsequent functional group manipulations. In view of the importance of 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydro-nucleosides, it is desirable to have a facile, efficient and general route of synthesis of these compounds. While several methods exist for the synthesis of 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydro-nucleosides, none has the ability to produce efficiently both enantiomeric forms of these compounds using purine bases, pyrirnidine bases, heteroaromatics or heterocycles.<br>
Several syntheses for the preparation of P-D-D4FC or its enantiomer, P-L-D4FC, have been reported. See Schinazi R. F. et al, J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42,859-867; Chen S., Biorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters 8(1998) 3245-3250; Doyle, T.W., et al., J. Org. Chem. 1997,62, 3449-3452; Cheng, Y., et al., J. Med. Chem. 1996, 62, 1757-1759; and Lin et al.. U.S. Patent No. 5,561,120.<br>
One of the earliest syntheses of 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydro-nucleosides is the published process for the preparation of 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydro-thymidine (D4T). The first reported method to produce D4T involved the base promoted elimination of 3'-O-sulfonyl esters of 2'-deoxynucleosides. This synthetic route is limited to pyrimidine nucleosides and cannot be used in the production of purine nucleosides. Horwitz, J. P..<br>
et al, J. Org. Chem. 1966, 31, 205; Horwitz, J. P., et ah, J. Org. Chem. 1967, 32, 817; and Horwitz, J. P., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964,86,1896.<br>
Some 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydro-nucleosides have been obtained directly from the corresponding ribonucleosides through their reaction with acetoxyisobutyryl halides, followed by the reductive elimination of the 2',3'-acetoxy-2',3'-halogeno derivatives with chromous ion. U.S. Patent No. 3,817,982 (1974); Chem. Abstr. 1974, 81, 63942; Russell, A. F., et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973, 95, 4025; Jain, T. C., et al., J. Org. Chem. 1974, 39, 30; Classon, B., et al, Ada Chem. Scand Sect B 1982, 52, 251; Robins, M. J., el al. Tetrahedron Letters 1984. 25, 367. In a variation of this method, zinc in dimethylformamide can be used instead of chromous acetate. Robins, M. J., et al., Tetrahedron letters 1984. 25, 367. The reaction is difficult, and results in several products, and is therefore an inefficient route to obtain the 2',3'-unsaturated compounds (Jain, T. C., et al,J. Org. Chem. 1974,39, 30).<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,455,339 to Chu describes a method for preparing 2',3'-dideoxy-2",3'-didehydro-nucleosides via dialkyl xanthate intermediates including:<br>
(i)        preparing a nucleoside derivative of the general structure:<br><br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
wherein B is a nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur heterocycle of from C1 to C15. Y is a suitable oxygen protecting group, each R is C(S)SR', where R' is an alkyl or cyanoalkyl group of C1 to C15, or both R's together are &gt;C=S ;<br>
(ii)      activating the 2' and 3' hydroxyls to form 2',3'-thiocarbonates; and then<br>
(iii)     deoxygenating the nucleoside derivative to the corresponding 2',3'-dieoxy-2',3'-didehydronucleoside.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,703,058; 5,905,070 and 6,232,300 and International Patent Application No. PCT/US96/00965, published as WO 96/22778 to Raymond F. Schinazi and Dennis C. Liolta describes [5-carboxamido or 5-fluoro]-2".3'-dideoxy-2,3'-didehydro-pyrimidine nucleosides and [5-carboxamido or 5-fluoro]-3'-modified-pyrimidine nucleosides. Example 3 of the '070 patent provides a process for the<br>
preparation of 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydro-nucleosides. The patent states that the procedure can be adapted for a wide variety of bases and can be used to provide either the β-D or the P-L isomer as desired. The process is illustrated below:<br>
(Formula Removed)wherein MMPP is magnesium monoperoxyphthalate, R is /-butyldiphenylsilyl, and STIPP is 2 A6-triisopropylphenyl.<br>
PCT WO 99/43691 describes 2'-fluoro-2'3'-dideoxy-2,3'-didehydronucleosides that are useful in the treatment of viral infections. Schemes 9, 30. and 11 of the PCT describe methods for the preparation of β-L-2'-fluoro-2',3"-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxy-nucleosides. The PCT publication states that previously, the synthesis of 2',3'-<br>
unsaturated L-nucleosides had been accomplished via an elimination reaction starting from readily available nucleoside analogs, which involved a lengthy modification procedure. There are few examples of the synthesis of 2:,3'-unsaturated purine micleosides by direct condensation due to the lability of the 2',3'-unsaturated sugar moiety under the coupling conditions in the presence of a Lewis acid, except one case of the pyrimidine analog using a thiophenyl intermediate (Abdel-Medied, A. W.-S., et al, Synthesis, 1991, 313; Sujino, K,, et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1996, 37, 6133). In contrast to the 2',3'-unsaturated sugar moiety, the 2'-fluoro-2',3'-unsaturated sugar, which bears enhanced stability of the glycosyl bond during the condensation with a heterocycle, is more suitable for the direct coupling reaction. As illustrated below (wherein B is a purine or pyrimidine base and R is an oxygen protecting group), (R)-2'-fluorobutenolide (prepared from L-glyceraldehyde acetonide) was used as the key precursor in the preparation of 2'-fluoro-2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydro-nucleosides. From the acetonide, a mixture of E and Z isomers was obtained via the Homer-Emmons reaction in the presence of triethyl a-fluorophosphonoacetate and sodium bisrim(tethylsilyl)amide in , THF (Thenappan, A., et al, J. Org. Chem., 1990, 55, 4639; Morikawa, T., et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 1992, 40, 3189; Patrich, T.B., et al., J. Org. Chem., 1994, 59, 1210). Due to the difficulties in separating the E and Z isomers, the mixture was carried on to the cyclization reaction under acidic conditions to give the desired lactone and uncyclized diol. The resulting mixture was converted to the silyl lactone and was subjected to reduction with DIBA1-H in CH2C12 at 78 °C to give the lactol. The lactol was treated with acetic anhydride to yield a key acetate intermediate, which was condensed with silylated 6-chloropurine under Vorbruggen conditions to afford anorneric mixtures of the protected nucleoside. Treatment of the protected nucleoside with TBAF in THF gave a mixture of free nucleosides that could be separated by silica gel column chromatography. The adenine analogs are obtained by the treatment of 6-chloropuridine with mercapto-ethanol and NaOMe in a steel bomb at 90 °C. Further treatment of the adenine analogs under the same conditions afforded the inosine analogs.<br>

The above methods for the syntheses of p-D-2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxy-5r fluorocytidine., or its enantiomer, β-L-D4FC, disclose synthetic routes employing combinations of toxic and/or difficult to handle reagents, linear or sequential reaction steps, and laborious chromatographic or purification steps. Consequently, these syntheses afford an inefficient synthesis of P-D-D4FC.<br>
Therefore, it is another object of the present invention to provide a process for the production of 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydro-nucleosides that is facile and efficient.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a high yield method to manufacture 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxynucleosides, and in particular (β-D-2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluorocytidine.<br>

It is another object of the present invention to provide a method to manufacture 2',3'-didehydro-2,3'-dideoxynucleosides, and in particular β-D-2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluorocytidine, which is amenable to commercial production.<br>
It is a particular object of the present invention to provide a method to manufacture 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxynucleosides, and in particular P-D-2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluorocytidine, which does not require protection of the purine or pyrimidine base, such as cytosine or 5-fluorocytosine.<br>
It is a particular object of the present invention to provide a method to manufacture 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxynucleosides, and in particular β-D-2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluorocytidine, which does not require purification by chromatography.<br>
It is a particular object of the present invention to provide a method to manufacture 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxynucleosides, and in particular p-D-2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluorocytidine, which does not require the use of toxic metals.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a process for the production of 2',3'-dideoxy-2'.3'-didehydro-nucleosides that can be used as synthetic intermediates for the preparation of a large variety of other nucleoside analogs, including but not limited to 2',3'-dideoxy, and 2' and 3'-deoxyribo nucleoside analogs as well as additional derivatives obtained by subsequent functional group manipulations.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

I.      Stereoisomerism and Polymorphism<br>
Compounds of the present invention have at least two chiral centers, and cart exist in and be isolated in optically active and racemic forms. Some compounds can exhibit polymorphism. The present invention encompasses racemic, optically-active, polymorphic, chiral, diastereomeric or stereoisomeric form, or mixtures thereof, of a compound of the invention, which possess the useful properties described herein. It will be appreciated that certain compounds of the present invention contain an asymmetrically substituted carbon atom, and can be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. The optically active forms can be prepared by, for example, resolution of the racemic form by recrystallization techniques, by synthesis from optically-active starting materials, by chiral synthesis, or by chromatographic separation using a chiral stationary phase or by enzymatic resolution. All chiral, diastereomeric, racemic forms and all geometric isomeric forms of a structure are intended, unless the specific stereochemistry or isomer form is specifically indicated.<br>
Optically active forms of the compounds can be prepared using any method known in the art, including by resolution of the racemic form by recrystallization techniques, by synthesis optically-active starting materials, by chiral synthesis, or by chromatographic separation using a chiral stationary phase.<br>
Examples of methods to obtain optically active materials include at least the following.<br>
i) physical separation of crystals - a technique whereby macroscopic crystals of the individual enantiomers are manually separated. This technique can be used if crystals of the separate enantiomers exist, i.e.. the material is a conglomerate, and the crystals are visually distinct;<br>
ii) simultaneous crystallization - a technique whereby the individual enantiomers are separately crystallized from a solution of the racemate. possible only if the latter is a conglomerate in the solid state;<br>
iii) enzymatic resolutions - a technique whereby partial or complete separation of a racemate by virtue of differing rates of reaction for the enantiomers with an enzyme;<br>
iv) enzymatic asymmetric synthesis - a synthetic technique whereby at least one step of the synthesis uses an enzymatic reaction to obtain an enantiomerically pure or enriched synthetic precursor of the desired enantiomer;<br>
v) chemical asymmetric synthesis - a synthetic technique whereby the desired enantiomer is synthesized from an achiral precursor under conditions that produce asymmetry (i.e., chirality) in the product, which can be achieved using chiral catalysts or chiral auxiliaries;<br>
vi) diastereomer separations - a technique whereby a racemic compound is reacted with an enantiomerically pure reagent (the chiral auxiliary) that converts the individual enantiomers to diastereomers. The resulting diastereomers are then separated by chromatography or crystallization by virtue of their now more structued differences and the chiral auxili  removed to obtain the desired enantiomer;<br>
vii) first- and second-order asymmetric transformations - a technique whereby diastereomers from the racemate equilibrate to yield a preponderance in solution of the diastereomer from the desired<br>
enantiomer or where preferential crystallization of the diastereomer from the desired enantiomer perturbs the equilibrium such that eventually in principle all the material is converted to the crystalline diastereomer from the desired enantiomer. The desired enantiomer is then released from the diastereomer;<br>
viii) kinetic resolutions - this technique refers to the achievement of partial or complete resolution of a racemate (or of a further resolution of a partially resolved compound) by virtue of unequal reaction rates of the enantiomers with a chiral. non-racemic reagent or catalyst under kinetic conditions;<br>
ix) enantiospecific synthesis from non-racemic precursors - a synthetic technique whereby the desired enantiomer is obtained from non-chiral starting materials and where the stereochemical integrity is not or is only minimally compromised over the course of the synthesis;<br>
x) chiral liquid chromatography - a technique whereby the enantiomers of a racemate are separated in a liquid mobile phase by virtue of their differing interactions with a stationary phase (including via chiral HPLC). The stationary phase can be made of chiral material or the mobile phase can contain an additional chiral material to provoke the differing interactions;<br>
xi) chiral gas chromatography - a technique whereby the racemate is volatilized and enantiomers are separated by virtue of their differing interactions in the gaseous mobile phase with a column containing a fixed non-racemic chiral adsorbent phase;<br>
xii) containing with chiral solvents . a technique whereby the enantiomers ate separated by virtue of preferential dissolution of one enantiomer into a particular chiral solvent;<br>
xiii) transport across chiral membranes - a technique whereby a racemate is placed in contact with a thin membrane barrier. The barrier typically separates two miscible fluids, one containing the<br>
acemate, and a driving force such as concentration or pressure differential causes preferential transport across the membrane barrier. Separation occurs as a result of the non-racemic chiral nature of the membrane that allows only one enantiomer of the racemate to pass through.<br>
Chiral chromatography, including simulated moving bed chromatography, is used in one embodiment. A wide variety of chiral stationary phases are commercially available.<br>
