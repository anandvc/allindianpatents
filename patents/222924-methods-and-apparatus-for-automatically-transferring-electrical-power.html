				<td>METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRING<br>
ELECTRICAL POWER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to electrical power transfer and, more particularly, to<br>
automatic transfer switches.<br>
An automatic transfer switch provides a continuous source of power for critical loads<br>
by automatically transferring from a normal power source to an emergency power<br>
source when the normal power source falls below a preset limit. Automatic transfer<br>
switches are in widespread use in hospitals, military installations, industrial sites, and<br>
commercial buildings where even brief power interruptions can be costly. Automatic<br>
transfer switches are also common to the power industry. Typical automatic transfer<br>
switches include a plurality of mechanical switching components controlled to<br>
minimize any interruptions during switching operations. Control of the switching<br>
components occurs through a series of sensing relays, transformers, and actuators,<br>
such as solenoids or linear motors to facilitate timely transfer from normal to<br>
emergency power. The solenoid actuators are energized until the controller senses<br>
that the switching component has moved to its desired position. Typically, a plurality<br>
of limit switches are positioned to provide a signal to the controller that switching is<br>
complete. Proper alignment of the limit switches facilitates a longer lasting automatic<br>
transfer switch because when the solenoid is energized, but the limit switch fails to<br>
actuate because of misalignment, the solenoid will be energized for a prolonged<br>
period of time which may damage the solenoid. Additionally, the limit switches,<br>
typically, are adjusted during assembly and/or installation resulting in an expenditure<br>
of time and raising assembly and/or installation costs.<br>
Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a cost-effective automatic transfer<br>
switch that is easy to assemble and install and facilitates a proper alignment of the<br>
limit switches and the switching components without adjustment during assembly and<br>
installation.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An automatic transfer switch includes a main body having a solenoid side and an<br>
auxiliary side. A solenoid side limit switch assembly is mounted to the solenoid side<br>
and an auxiliary side limit switch assembly is mounted on the auxiliary side. The<br>
solenoid side limit switch assembly includes a plurality of limit switches and a<br>
solenoid side mounting plate. The auxiliary side limit switch assembly includes a<br>
plurality of limit switches and an auxiliary side mounting plate. A unitary arc chute<br>
cover plate covers a plurality of phase plates.<br>
The limit switches are in fixed relationship to the mounting plates and assembly time<br>
is decreased because the limit switches are not adjusted during assembly.<br>
Additionally the unitary construction of the arc chute cover plate facilitates a<br>
reduction in assembly time versus an automatic transfer switch having a plurality of<br>
separate cover plates. The automatic transfer switch facilitates a decrease in assembly<br>
time by utilizing a pre-assembled auxiliary limit switch assembly, a pre-assembled<br>
solenoid side limit switch assembly, and a unitary construction. The limit switches<br>
are not adjusted during assembly and installation providing for easy assembly and<br>
installation. Additionally, a tabbed mounting plate provides for easy mounting of the<br>
automatic transfer switch to an enclosure facilitating a decrease in installation time.<br>
Accordingly, an easy to assemble and install automatic transfer switch that is cost-<br>
effective is provided.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure lis a perspective view of one embodiment of an automatic transfer switch 10<br>
including a solenoid side 12 and Figure 2 is a perspective view of transfer switch 10<br>
illustrating an auxiliary side 14 of transfer switch 10. Transfer switch 10 is mounted<br>
to a mounting plate 16 and includes a main body 17 including a plurality of bus<br>
assemblies 18 electrically connected to a plurality of phase plates 20. Mounting plate<br>
16 includes a plurality of mounting depressions 19 each including a mounting opening<br>
21 substantially centered therein. Mounting depressions 19 are generally<br>
semispherically shaped. On solenoid side 12, transfer switch 10 includes a solenoid<br>
22 and a solenoid side limit switch assembly 24. On auxiliary side 14, transfer switch<br>
10 includes an auxiliary side limit switch assembly 26.<br>
Figure 3 is a partially exploded view of transfer switch 10. Auxiliary side limit switch<br>
assembly 26 includes a plurality of limit switches 28 interspersed with a plurality of<br>
spacers 30. In an exemplary embodiment, auxiliary side limit switch assembly<br>
includes ten limit switches 28, twelve spacers 30, an auxiliary side mounting plate 32,<br>
and an auxiliary side end plate 34. In an exemplary embodiment, spacers 30 are<br>
fabricated from a flame resistant polypropylene, such as, for example, 30,000 Formax,<br>
commercially available from Absolute Industrial Fabricators, Adison II. Limit<br>
switches 28 are oriented substantially perpendicular to mounting plate 16 and are<br>
arranged in coplanar pairs with three pairs internal to main body 17 and two pairs<br>
external to main body 17. In an exemplary embodiment, auxiliary side mounting<br>
plate 32 is fabricated from nickel-plated 1/8 inch thick cold rolled steel and auxiliary<br>
side end plate 34 is fabricated from .052 inch thick galvanized steel.<br>
During assembly of transfer switch 10, auxiliary side limit switch assembly 26 is<br>
assembled and mounted to transfer switch 10 utilizing auxiliary side mounting plate<br>
32. Each switch 28 includes a plurality of mounting openings 36. Inserting a<br>
plurality of mounting rods 38 through end plate 34, spacers 30, switches 28, and<br>
auxiliary side mounting plate 32 positions switches 28 in a fixed relationship with<br>
auxiliary side mounting plate 32 which facilitates assembly of transfer switch 10<br>
without adjustment of switches 28. The fixed relationship of switches 28 with<br>
mounting plate 32 also facilitates a perpendicular orientation of switches 28 to<br>
mounting plate 16. In an exemplary embodiment, mounting rods 38 are threaded and<br>
threadably engage transfer switch 10.<br>
Figure 4 is an exploded view of solenoid side limit switch assembly 24 (shown in<br>
Figures 1-3) including a plurality of limit switches 50 interspersed with a plurality of<br>
spacers 52. In one embodiment, solenoid side limit switch assembly 24 includes four<br>
limit switches 50, six spacers 52, a solenoid side mounting plate 54, and a manual<br>
switch knob 56. Limit switches 50 are oriented substantially perpendicular to<br>
mounting plate 16 and are arranged in coplanar pairs external to main body 17.<br>
During assembly of transfer switch 10, solenoid side limit switch assembly 24 is<br>
assembled and mounted to transfer switch 10 utilizing solenoid side mounting plate<br>
54. Each switch 50 includes a plurality of mounting openings 58. Inserting a<br>
plurality of mounting rods 60 through spacers 52, switches 50, and solenoid side<br>
mounting plate 54 positions switches 50 in a fixed relationship with solenoid side<br>
mounting plate 54 which facilitates assembly of transfer switch 10 without adjustment<br>
of switches 50. The fixed relationship of switches 50 with solenoid side mounting<br>
plate 54 also facilitates a perpendicular orientation of switches 50 to mounting plate<br>
16. In one exemplary embodiment, mounting rods 60 are threaded and threadably<br>
engage transfer switch 10. In an alternative exemplary embodiment, transfer switch<br>
10 is molded and includes a unitary molded pocket sized to receive solenoid side<br>
mounting plate 54 which decreases assembly time and facilitates a perpendicular<br>
alignment between switches 50 and mounting plate 16. In a further alternative<br>
embodiment, transfer switch 10 includes a plurality of unitarily molded pockets to<br>
accept solenoid 22 and other accessories. Auxiliary side limit switch assembly 26 and<br>
solenoid side limit switch assembly 24 are mounted separately to mounting plate 16<br>
prior to main body 17 being mounted to mounting plate 16.<br>
During operation, transfer switch 10 provides a continuous source of power for critical<br>
loads by automatically transferring from a normal power source to an emergency<br>
power source when the normal power source falls below preset limits. Transfer<br>
switch 10 is rated for between 30 amperes and 225 amperes.<br>
Figure 5 is a top view and Figure 6 is a side view of transfer switch 10 (shown in<br>
Figures 1-4) mounted on a tabbed mounting plate 70 including a plurality of<br>
attachment tabs 72 extending from tabbed mounting plate 70. Each attachment tab 72<br>
is unitary with tabbed mounting plate 70 and each tab 72 extends obliquely from a<br>
first bend 74. Each tab 72 includes a second bend 76 after which each attachment tab<br>
72 extends substantially parallel to tabbed mounting plate 70 defining a width 77<br>
corresponding to a width of an enclosure (not shown). In one embodiment, mounting<br>
plate 70 is fabricated from sheet steel and attachment tabs 72 are formed with a punch<br>
press in a single operation. In an alternative embodiment, attachment tabs 72 are not<br>
unitary with tabbed mounting plate 70. Rather, attachment tabs 72 are fabricated<br>
separate from tabbed mounting plate 70 and are attached according to conventional<br>
methods. The enclosure includes a plurality of debossed tabs sized and positioned to<br>
receive attachment tabs 72. In an exemplary embodiment, each attachment tab 72<br>
includes at least one mounting opening 78 substantially centered thereon to facilitate<br>
attaching tabbed mounting plate 70 to an enclosure having mounting studs instead of<br>
debossed tabs. Tabbed mounting plate 70 can be mounted to an enclosure having<br>
embossed tabs utilizing width 77 of attachment tabs 72 and can be mounted to an<br>
enclosure without debossed tabs utilizing mounting openings 78 of attachment tabs<br>
72. Accordingly, tabbed mounting plate 70 provides for dual mounting capabilities.<br>
Attachment tabs 72 are disposed symmetric with respect to a first line of symmetry 80<br>
and are symmetric with respect to a second line of symmetry 82 orthogonal to first<br>
line of symmetry 80. Attachment tabs 72 include a leading edge 84 positioned<br>
between two tapered edges 86 that extend to two side edges 88.<br>
Figure 7 is a partially exploded view of transfer switch 10 including a removable arc<br>
chute cover plate 90 including a plurality of mounting openings 92. Arc chute cover<br>
plate 90 is a unitary piece of non-conductive material utilized to cover phase plates<br>
20. In an exemplary embodiment, cover plate is molded from a thermoset plastic i.e.,<br>
a plastic such that when heat is applied, the plastic softens and then hardens (sets) as<br>
the plastic cools wherein the plastic can not be softened again.<br>
During assembly of transfer switch 10, the unitary construction of arc chute cover<br>
plate 90 facilitates a reduction in assembly time versus an automatic transfer switch<br>
having a plurality of separate cover plates. Transfer switch 10 facilitates a decrease in<br>
assembly time by utilizing a pre-assembled auxiliary limit switch assembly, a pre-<br>
assembled solenoid side limit switch assembly, and a unitary construction. The limit<br>
switches are not adjusted during assembly and installation providing for easy<br>
assembly and installation. Additionally, tabbed mounting plate provides for easy<br>
mounting of transfer switch 10 to an enclosure facilitating a decrease in installation<br>
time.<br>
