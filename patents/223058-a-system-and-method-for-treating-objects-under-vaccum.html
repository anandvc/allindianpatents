				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a multi-chamber installation for treating objects under<br>
vacuum, comprising an evacuation system that is connected to the chambers.<br>
Moreover, the present invention relates to a method for evacuating said<br>
installation as well as an evacuation system therefor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Multi-chamber installations of the aforementioned kind are known. They serve<br>
the purpose of degassing, coating (metallization, for example) or etching<br>
substrates. Known methods of this kind are CVD or DVD processes. Commonly,<br>
such an installation is equipped with a process chamber, with one or several pre-<br>
chambers with load lock function being located upstream. The load locks are<br>
opened for the period of time while introducing or removing substrates, so that<br>
high pressure variations occur differing from chamber to chamber.<br>
In the instance of a multi-chamber installation equipped with two chambers, it is<br>
known to employ two separate vacuum pumps in order to be able to evacuate as<br>
rapidly as possible each of the chambers after closing the corresponding load<br>
lock.<br>
Typical forevacuum pumps are oil-sealed rotary pumps as they are known, for<br>
example, from DE-U-90 07 544.<br>
US patent 6251192 B1 discloses a vacuum exhaust system which can improve<br>
the operating efficiency of the vacuum exhaust system while reducing the<br>
system cost, to quickly attain a vacuum in the auxiliary chambers without<br>
increasing the size of the vacuum pumps. The vacuum exhaust system comprises<br>
a first pumping section and a second pumping section disposed downstream of<br>
and in series with the first pumping section. A main exhaust passage is provided<br>
to communicate a main chamber with a suction port of the first pumping section,<br>
and an auxiliary exhaust passage is provided to communicate an auxiliary<br>
chamber with a suction port of the second pumping section.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
It is the task of the present invention to reduce in the instance of multi-chamber<br>
installations of the aforementioned kind or similar kind, the complexity for the<br>
evacuation system.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a system for<br>
treating objects under vacuum, comprising a plurality of chambers; and an<br>
evacuation device having at least one forevacuum pump with several pumping<br>
stages, each of said several pumping stages being provided with one inlet each<br>
connectable to one of said several pumping stages. The plurality of chambers<br>
comprises a process chamber with at least one pre-chamber linked to the<br>
process chamber, and in that the pumping stages of the forevacuum pump have<br>
different pumping capacities, the stage with the highest capacity being<br>
connected to the process chamber.<br>
In a second aspect of the invention, there is provided A method for operating a<br>
system for treating objects under vacuum, the system having a process chamber<br>
with at least one pre-chamber connected to the process chamber, the required<br>
vacuum pressures are produced in the chambers by adapting an evacuation<br>
device having at least one forevacuum pump with several stages, each stages<br>
having different pumping capacities. The vacuum pressure is produced with the<br>
several pumping stages operated in parallel; the pumping stages each provided<br>
with one inlet which each being connectable to one of the chambers, and in that<br>
the process chamber is evacuated with the aid of a pumping stage having the<br>
highest pumping capacity.<br>
Thus, the system is characterized in that each of the stages is equipped with an<br>
inlet and in that each of the inlets is connected to one of the chambers, now only<br>
one vacuum pump is required in order to produce the desired pressure - be.........<br>
they approximately the same or also different - in the different chambers as<br>
rapidly as possible and maintain these. Several pumps each with a drive motor<br>
are no longer required. Also installation complexity - both mechanical and also<br>
electrical - is reduced. Preferably the pump stages are operated in parallel so<br>
that they have the function of two independent pumps.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Further advantages and details of the present invention shall be explained with<br>
reference to the examples of embodiments depicted schematically in the<br>
accompanying drawings 1 to 4:<br>
Figure 1: a multi-chamber installation with three chambers and a three stage<br>
forevacuum pump,<br>
Figure 2: a multi-chamber installation with two vacuum chambers and a two-<br>
stage forevacuum pump,<br>
Figure 3: a multi-chamber installation according to drawing figure 2 with an<br>
additional high vacuum pump and<br>
Figure 4: a sectional view through a two-stage forevacuum pump.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the drawing figures, the multi-chamber installation is generally designated as<br>
1, the chambers with 2, 3 and 4, and the evacuation system with 5. In the<br>
instance of the chambers 2 to 4 these consist each of a process chamber 2, to<br>
which further chambers 3, 4 (drawing figure in 1) respectively only 4 (drawing<br>
figures 2, 3) are associated which may, for example, have the function of load<br>
locks. Slotted load locks are schematically depicted and designated as 6, 7 and 8.<br>
The evacuation system 5 is designed by way of a multi-stage forevacuum pump.<br>
In the example of the embodiment in accordance with drawing figure 1, three<br>
chambers 2, 3, 4 are present. Correspondingly, the forevacuum pump 5 has<br>
three stages 11, 12, 13 each with one inlet 14, 15, respectively 16. Each of the<br>
inlets 14,15,16 is connected via one each connecting line 17,18, respectively in<br>
19 to one of the chambers 2, 3,4. The outlets 20, 21, 22 of the pump stages 11,<br>
12,13 open out within the pump 5 into a joint discharge line, so that the pump 5<br>
has only one outlet 23. In the instance of the pumping stages 11, 12, 13 having<br>
different pumping capacities, it is then expedient to connect the stage with the<br>
highest pumping capacity to the process chamber 2, so that there sufficiently low<br>
pressures are attainable as rapidly as possible.<br>
In the embodiment according to drawing figure 2, only two chambers 2, 4 and<br>
correspondingly two pump stages 11,13 are provided. Located in the connecting<br>
lines 17 and 19 are valves 24 and 25 in order to separate from the evacuation<br>
system 5 one or both chambers 2,4 in case these are vented.<br>
In the embodiment according to drawing figure 3, there is located in the<br>
connecting line 17 a turbomolecular vacuum pump 26 and - on its delivery side -<br>
a valve 27. High vacuum pumps of this kind excel through higher pumping<br>
capacities and lower ultimate pressures compared to forevacuum pumps,<br>
however, they require a forevacuum pump which in the instance of the case<br>
presented, forms the pumping stage 11. This embodiment is expedient for<br>
processes being performed in the process chamber 2 in which relatively low<br>
pressure (102 mbar, for example) shall be attained as rapidly as possible.<br>
Forevacuum pumps are also capable of attaining ultimate pressures of<br>
approximately 1 mbar to 5x10-2 mbar, however, through the utilization of high<br>
vacuum pumps it is possible to attain even lower pressures significantly faster.<br>
Drawing figure 4 depicts a partial sectional view through a commercial two-stage<br>
forevacuum pump 5 which has been modified for utilization in a multi-chamber<br>
installation. Said forevacuum pump is equipped with an outer casing 28 with an<br>
oil sump 29. Accommodated in the outer casing 28 is the actual pump 31, a<br>
rotary vane vacuum pump 31 with two stages 11 and 13. It comprises three<br>
discs 32, 33, 34 with pump rings 35, 36 accommodated in between. The pump<br>
rings 35, 36 form of the pump chambers 37, 38, in which there is located one<br>
each eccentrically arranged rotor 41, respectively 42 with its vanes 43,<br>
respectively 44. The rotor 42 is linked to the shaft 45 of a drive motor net<br>
depicted. Moreover, the bearing stubs of the rotors 41, 42 are linked to each<br>
other in the area of the disk 33. The diameter of the rotors 41, 42 is equal, their<br>
lengths are different. Thus there result for the two pump stages 11, 13 different<br>
pumping capacities. When employing the presented pump as a two-stage<br>
vacuum pump with series connected pump stages 11,13, the longer pump stage<br>
forms the inlet pump stage and the shorter one the delivery pump stage.<br>
The pump 5 presented has been modified such that the pump stages 11,13 may<br>
be operated in parallel. The inlet equipped with an anti-suck back valve 46 which<br>
is present in any case in pumping stage 11 serves as inlet 14. The outlet of<br>
pumping stage 11, not depicted in detail, is no longer linked to the inlet of the<br>
pumping stage 13, but instead opens out below the felt hat 47. The pumping<br>
stage 13 has been equipped with an independent intake port 48 forming the inlet<br>
16. The intake port 48 is linked via pipe section 49 run out of the casing 28 to<br>
the pump chamber 37. The not depicted outlet of this pumping stage 13 also<br>
opens out under the felt hat 47. The felt hat 47 serves the purpose of calming<br>
down the flow and coarsely separating the oil. Further separators which need to<br>
be connected to the outlets 23 need, compared to the state-of-the-art, to be<br>
present only once.<br>
