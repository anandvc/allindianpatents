CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application No. 09/198,718, filed November 24, 1998, which is, in turn, a continuation-in-part of International Patent Application No. PCT/US98/] 1036. filed May 28, 1998, which is, in turn, a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application No. 08/972,614, filed November 18, 1997, which is, in turn, a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application No. 08/864,455, filed May 18, 1997, now abandoned.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is directed to the inhibition of cell proliferation and/or cell matrix production and/or cell movement (chennotaxis) and/or T cell activation and proliferation using of quinoline/quinoxaline compounds which are useful protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKJs).<br>
Cellular signaling is mediated through a system of interactions which include cell-cell contact or cell-matrix contact or extracellular receptor-substrate contact. The extracellular signal is often communicated to other parts of the cell via a tyrosine kinase mediated phosphorylation event which affects substrate proteins downstream of the cell Membrane bound signaling complex. A specific set of receptor-enzymes such as the insulin receptor, epidermal grouch factor receptor (EGF-R) or platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) are examples of tyrosine kinase enzymes which are involved in cellular signaling. Autophosphorylation of the enzyme is required for efficient enzyme-mediated phosphorylation of substrate proteins containing tyrosine residues. These substrates are known to be responsible for a variety of cellular events including cellular proliferation, cellular matrix production. cellular migration and apoptosis to name a few.<br>
It is understood that a large number of disease states are caused by either uncontrolled reproduction of cells or overproduction of matrix or poorly regulated programmed cell death (apoptosis). These disease states involve a variety of cell types and include disorders such as leukemia, cancer, glioblastoma, psoriasis, inflammatory diseases, bone diseases, fibrotic diseases, atherosclerosis and restenosis occurring subsequent to angioplasty of the coronary, femoral or kidney arteries or, fibroproliferative disease such as in arthritis, fibrosis of the lung, kidney and liver. In addition, deregulated cellular proliferative conditions follow from coronary bypass surgery. The inhibition of tyrosine kinase activit&gt;' is believed to have utility in the control of uncontrolled reproduction of cells or overproduction of matrix or poorly regulated programmed cell deatli (apoptosis).<br>
It is also known that certain tyrosine kinase inhibitors can interact with more than one type of tyrosine kinase enzyme. Several tyrosine kinase enzymes are critical for the normal function of the body. For instance, it would be undesirable to inhibit insulin action in most normal circumstances. Therefore, compounds which inhibit PDGF-R tyrosine kinase activity at concentrations less than the concentrations effective in inhibiting the insulin receptor kinase could provide valuable agents for the<br><br>
selective treatment of diseases characterized by cell proliferation and/or cell matrix production and/or cell movement (chemotaxis) such as restenosis.<br>
This invention relates to the modulation and/or inhibition of cell signaling, cell proliferation, extracellular matrix production, chemotaxis, the control of abnormal cell growth and cell inflammalorv response. More specifically, this invention relates to the use of substituted quinoxaline compounds which exhibit selective inhibition of differentiation, proliferation or mediator release by effectively inhibiting platelet-derived growth factor-receptor (PDGF-R) tyrosine kinase activir&gt;' and/or Lck tyrosine kinase activity.<br>
2.	Reported Developments<br>
A number of literature reports describe tyrosine kinase inhibitors which are selective for tyrosine kinase receptor enzymes such as EGF-R or PDGF-R or non-receptor cytosolic tyrosine kinase enzymes such as v-abi, p56lck or c-src. Recent reviews by Spada and Myers {Exp. Opin. Ther, Patents 1995. j(8). 805) and Bridges (E^xp. Opin, Thcr. Patents 1995, 5(12), 1245) summarize the literature for tNrosinc kinase inhibitors and EGF-R selective inhibitors respectively. Additionally Law and Lydon have summarized the anticancer potential of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Emerging; Drugs:  The Prospect For Improved Medicines 1996, 241 "260).<br>
Known inhibitors of PDGF-R tyrosine kinase activirv' includes quinoline-based inhibitors reported by Maguire et al. U Med Chem. 1994, i7, 2129). and by Dolle et al. (J, Med, Cheni. 1994, 37, 2627), A class of phenylamino-pyrimidine-based inhibitors was recently reported by Traxler el al. in EP 564409 and by Zimmennan, J.: and Traxler, P. et al. {Biorg, &amp; Med. Chem, Lett. 1996. 
The correlation between the multifactorial disease of restenosis with PDGF and PDGF-R is well-documented throughout the scientific literature. However, recent developments into the imderstanding of fibrotic diseases of the lung (Antoniadcs, H. N.: et al../ Clin, Invest,  1990, 86. 1055), kidney and liver (Peterson, T. C. Hepatohg}\ 1993, 77, 486) have also implicated PDGF and PDGF-R as playing a role. For instance glomerulonephritis is a major cause of renal failure and PDGF has been identified to be a potent mitogen for mesangial cells in vitro as demonstrated by Shultz et al. (Am. J. Physiol. 1988. 255, F674) and by Floege, et al. (Clin, Exp. Immim, 199L 86, 334). It has been reported by Thomton, S. C: et al. (Clin. Exp, Imimin. 1991. 86, 79) that TNF-alpha and PDGF (obtained from human rheumatoid arthritis patients) are the major cylokines involved in proliferation of synovial cells. Furthermore, specific tumor cell types have been identified (see Silver, B. J., BioFactors, 1992, i, 217) such as glioblastoma and Kaposi's sarcoma which overexpress either the PDGF protein or receptor thus leading to the uncontrolled growth of cancer ceils via an autocrine or paracrine mechanism. Therefore, it is anticipated that a PDGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor would be useful in treating a variety of seemingly unrelated human disease conditions that can be characterized by the involvement of PDGF and or PDGF-R in their etiology.<br>
The role of various non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as p56'* (hereinafter 'Lck') in infiammalion-relatcd conditions involving T cell activation and proliferation has been reviewed by<br><br>
Hankc, et al {Inflamm. Res, 1995, -/-/. 357) and by Bolen and Brugge (Ann. Rev. Immwioi, 1997, 15. 371). These inflammatory conditions include allergy, autoimmune disease, rheumatoid arthritis and transplant rejection. Another recent review summarizes various classes of tyrosine kinase inhibitors including compounds having Lck inhibitory activity (Groundwater, et. al Progress in MeJichinl Chcmistrv. 1996, 33, 233). Inhibitors of Lck tyrosine kinase activity include several natural products which arc generally non-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as staurosporine, genistein. certain flavones and erbstatin. Damnacanthol was recently reported to be a low nM inhibitor of Lck (Faltynek, et. al. Biochemistry. 1995, 34. 12404). Examples of synthetic Lck inhibitors include: a series ofdihydroxy-isoquinoline inhibitors reported as having low micromolar to submicromolar activity (Burke, et. al J. Med. Cheni. 1993. 36. 425); and a quinoline derivative found to be much less active having an Lck IC50 of 610 micromolar. Researchers have also disclosed a series of 4-subsiilulcd quinazolines thai inhibit Lck in the low micromolar to submicromolar range (Myers et al, W095/15758 and Myers, et. al Bioorg Med. Chem. Lett. 1997, 7, 417). Researchers at Pfizer (Hanke, et. al J. Biol. Chem. 1996. 27L 695) have disclosed two specific pyrazolopyrimidine inhibitors known as PIN and PP2 which have low nanomolar potency against Lck and Fyn. (another Src-faniilv kinase). No Lck inhibitory has been reported regarding quinoline or quinoxaline based compounds. Therefore, it is anticipated that a quinoline or quinoxaline based inhibitor of Lck tyrosine kinase activity could be useful in treating a variety of seemingly unrelated human disease conditions that can be characterized by the involvement of Lck tyrosine kinase signaling in their etiology.<br><br>

Where the compound of the present invention is substituted with a basic moiet&gt;\ acid,addition salts are formed and are simply a more convenient form for use; and in practice, use of the salt form inherently amounts to use of the free base form. The acids which can be used to prepare the acid addition salts include preferably those which produce, when combined with the free base, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, thai is, salts whose anions are non-toxic to the patient in pharmaceutical doses of the salts, so that the beneficial inhibitory effects on PDGF inherent in the free base are not vitiated by side effects ascribable to the anions. Although pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said basic compounds are preferred, all acid addition salts are useful as sources of the free base form even if the particular salt, per se, is desired only as an intermediate product as. for example, when the salt is formed only for purposes of purification, and identification, or when it is used as intermediate in preparing a pharmaceutically acceptable salt by ion exchange procedures. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention are those derived from the following acids: mineral adds such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and sulfamic acid; and organic acids such as acetic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malonic acid, methanesufonic acid, eihanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, cyclohexylsulfamic acid, quinic acid, and the like.

In the alternative, the tyrosine kinase inhibition activity is determined according to the following method. A substrate (tyrosine-containing substrate. Biot-(p Ala)-Lys-Val-GIu-LyS'IIe-Giy-Glu-Gly-Thr-Tyr-GIu-Val-VaI-Tyr-Lys-(NH2) recognized by P56*''. I [iM) is first phosphorylated in presence or absence of a given concentration of the test compound, by a given amount of enzyme (enzyme is produced by expression of P56'*'*' gene in a yeast construct) purified from a cloned yeast (purification of the enzyme is done by following classical methods) in the presence of ATP (lO^M) MgCI2( 2,5mM), MnC12 (2.5mM), NaCl (25mM), DTT (0.4mM) in Hepes 50mM. pH 7.5, over 10 min at ambient temperature. The total reaction volume is 50^1, and the reactions are performed in a black 96-we!l fluoroplate. The reaction is stopped by addition of I50pl of slopping buffer (lOOmM Hepes pH7,5, KF 400mM, EDTA 133 mM, BSA Ig/1.) containing a selected anti tyrosine antibody labeled with the Europium cryptatc (PY20-K) at 0.8pg/ml and allophycocyanine-labelled streptavidin (XL665) at 4ng/mL The labeling of Streptavidin and anti-tyrosine antibodies were performed by Cis-Bio International (France). The mixture is counted using a Packard Discovery counter which is able to measure time-resolved homogeneous fluorescence transfer (excitation at 337 nm. readout at 620 nm and 665 nm). The ratio of the 665 nm signal / 620nm signal is a measure of the phosphorylated tyrosine concentration. The blank is obtained by replacing enzyme by buffer The specific signal is the difference between the ratio obtained without inhibitor and the ratio with the blank. The percentage of specific signal is calculated. The ICso is calculated with 10 concentrations of inhibitor in duplicate using Xlfit soft. The reference compound is staurosporine (Sigma) and it exhibits an Id, ol 30± 6 nM (n=20).<br><br>
