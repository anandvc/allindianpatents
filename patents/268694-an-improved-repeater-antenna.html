				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention discloses a repeater antenna for use in<br>
telecommunications systems in the microwave range. The repeater antenna<br>
is intended for connecting transmissions from a first radio unit at a first site to<br>
a second radio unit at a second site.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In telecommunications systems such as, for example, cellular telephony<br>
systems in the microwave range, there can be a number of problems for a<br>
base station when trying to communicate with the users located in the area<br>
covered by the base station, said area being referred to as "a cell", said<br>
problems being particularly noticeable in systems that use a high bit rate In<br>
urban areas, examples of such problems can be high-rise buildings which<br>
obstruct the line of sight to certain sub-areas, or that in certain sub-areas the<br>
number of users can exceed that which can be handled by the base station.<br>
One way of handling these problems, especially in the case of areas where<br>
the line-of-sight is obscured, is to use so called repeater antennas, i.e.<br>
antennas which are installed at a location where they may be reached from<br>
the base station, and from which location they may also relay transmissions<br>
to and from the obscured area.<br>
Another way of handling the described problems, especially in the case of<br>
sub-areas within the cell with an amount of users which is too large to be<br>
handled by the base station, is to install other base stations which can cover<br>
the sub-areas in question, usually base stations with smaller capacity, so<br>
called "pico-stations".<br>
These "pico-stations" then need to be connected to the network in some way,<br>
suitably with the pico-station as one of the points in a point-to-point<br>
connection. Said point-to-point connection could be made by means of a<br>
2<br><br>
repeater station, which would be directed at the "pico-station" from the base<br>
station, or from another higher level node in the network.<br>
Conventional repeater antennas are usually designed by means of two<br>
reflector antennas, often parabolic dishes, connected by means of a wave-<br>
guide and pointed in different directions. Installing such repeaters, especially<br>
in urban areas, is becoming increasingly difficult, due to a number of factors<br>
such as aesthetic considerations and difficulties in finding sufficient space for<br>
a repeater site.<br>
Another kind of previously known repeater is merely a large sheet of<br>
reflective material, such as metal. Such a repeater would suffer from a<br>
number of drawbacks, for example high losses due to low directivity, and<br>
would generally not be suitable for use in urban areas.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
As described above, there is thus a need for a repeater antenna in a<br>
telecommunications system on the microwave range which would overcome<br>
the previously described drawbacks of known repeater antennas.<br>
This need is addressed by the invention in that it discloses a repeater<br>
antenna for use in telecommunications systems on the microwave range, the<br>
repeater antenna being intended to connect a first radio unit at a first site to a<br>
second radio unit at a second site.<br>
The disclosed repeater antenna has at least a first and a second antenna<br>
element and a feed network for these antenna elements, and the antenna<br>
elements give rise to first and second antenna beams, so that the first beam<br>
can be used for connecting the repeater antenna to said first radio unit, and<br>
the second beam can be used for connecting the repeater antenna to said<br>
second radio unit.<br>
3<br><br>
In the repeater antenna, said first and second antenna elements are<br>
arranged on a surface where the distance between the two antenna elements<br>
along the surface is longer than the shortest distance between the antenna<br>
elements, in other words a non-flat surface, either a curved or bent such<br>
surface.<br>
In one embodiment of the repeater antenna, at least one of said first and<br>
second antenna elements are part of an array comprising a plurality of<br>
antenna elements. In one version of this embodiment, the repeater antenna<br>
can suitably have a longitudinal and a lateral direction of extension, and the<br>
array of antenna elements is a one-dimensional array which is arranged to<br>
coincide with one of said directions of extension of the antenna. In another<br>
version of this embodiment, the array of antenna elements is a two-<br>
dimensional array, with the two dimensions being arranged to essentially<br>
coincide with one of said directions of extension of the antenna.<br>
Suitably but not necessarily, the antenna elements can be essentially plane<br>
and created on a sheet of electrically conducting material, and the repeater<br>
antenna additionally comprises a ground plane spaced apart from the<br>
antenna elements by means of a dielectric material.<br>
Thus, by means of the invention, a repeater antenna is disclosed which can<br>
direct beams in more or less any azimuth (horizontal) or elevational angle so<br>
that it can have one beam which covers the base station antenna, and a<br>
second beam which covers an area within the cell where there is a need for<br>
additional coverage in addition to that afforded by the base station antenna.<br>
Said first and second beams can be separated by a more or less arbitrary<br>
angle, so that the repeater antenna can be used in a highly versatile manner.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will be described in more detail in the following description,<br>
with reference to the appended drawings, in which<br>
4<br><br>
Fig 1 shows a basic view of a system in which the repeater antenna of the<br>
invention can be applied, and<br>
Fig 2 shows a basic view of the system of fig 1 in which the repeater antenna<br>
of the invention is used, and<br>
Fig 3 shows a top view of the system of fig 2, and<br>
Fig 4 shows a schematic top view of repeater antenna of the invention, and<br>
Figs 5-7 show more detailed embodiments of the repeater antenna.<br>
EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig 1 shows an example of a telecommunications system 100 in which the<br>
invention may be used. The system 100 shown in this example is a cellular<br>
telephony system in the microwave range, i.e. from 1GHz and upwards.<br>
In the system 100, there is a base station 110 which is connected to higher<br>
levels in the system. The radio base station uses one or several antennas<br>
120 in order to cover a certain area, a so called cell, within which the base<br>
station handles communication to and from users of the cellular systems, as<br>
well as all control of the telephones of said users.<br>
The cell of the system 100 is located in an urban area with one or several<br>
high-rise buildings 125, 126, which block the communications from the base<br>
station antenna 120 to one or more areas. Thus, there will be areas such as<br>
the shaded area A within the cell which can only be serviced at degraded bit<br>
rates or which cannot be serviced at all by the base station 110 by means of<br>
the coverage given by the base station antenna 120.<br>
There can also be a number of other factors which would make it difficult or<br>
impossible for the base station 110 to service users in an area within the cell,<br>
one such reasons being that the number of users in that particular area is so<br>
high that the total number of users in the entire cell exceeds the base<br>
station's capacity.<br>
5<br><br>
Fig 2 shows the system of fig 1 with some additional equipment, which will be<br>
described in the following. In order to service users of the system in the area<br>
A, a repeater antenna 250 of the invention has been deployed, in this case<br>
on top of the building 126. The repeater antenna 250 is intended to connect<br>
the base station to one or more users of the system at sites within the area A.<br>
As shown in fig 2, the repeater antenna has at least a first 260 and a second<br>
270 antenna beam. As will be shown in more detail later on, the first beam<br>
can be used for reception of the signals from the base station, and the<br>
second beam can be used for transmitting the received signals to area A, to<br>
one or more users within that area.<br>
In fig 3, the system 200 of fig 2 is shown in a schematic "top view". As seen<br>
here, the repeater antenna 250 is deployed on top of one of the buildings<br>
126, from where there is line of sight to the obscured area A. The repeater<br>
antenna has the two beams 260, 270 mentioned previously, the first 260 of<br>
which is directed so that it covers the base station, and the second 270 of<br>
which is so directed that it covers the obscured area A. Thus, the repeater<br>
antenna 250 can connect the base station 110 to users in area A, users<br>
which would otherwise have been unable to connect to the base station,<br>
particularly if they wish to connect at high bit rates, such as typically 0.5<br>
Mbps or higher.<br>
In another application of the repeater antenna, if the users in area A aren't<br>
obscured from line of sight from the base station, or if they in addition to<br>
being obscured are also of such a quantity that the base station can't handle<br>
them, the system may be expanded to comprise an additional base station<br>
dedicated to servicing area A. This additional base station can be one which<br>
is similar to the base station 110, or it can be a so called "pico" base-station,<br>
i.e. a base station which has a smaller capacity than the base station 110,<br>
the pico station being a type of base station which is specifically intended to<br>
aid larger base stations. The repeater antenna would then be installed so that<br>
6<br><br>
it connects the pico station to the base station, the pico station handling the<br>
users in area A, instead of those users being handled directly by the base<br>
station.<br>
The first and the second antenna beams of the repeater antenna are, in order<br>
to meet the demands of the system, separated by a more or less arbitrarily<br>
chosen angle a. In order to achieve this, as shown in figs 4a and 4b, where<br>
two embodiments of the repeater antenna 250 are shown in a top view, the<br>
repeater antenna comprises a first 410 and a second 420 antenna element,<br>
which are arranged on a surface 430 where the distance between the two<br>
antenna elements along the surface is longer than the shortest distance<br>
between the antenna elements. In other words, the surface on which the<br>
antenna elements are arranged is curved or bent. The antenna elements as<br>
such can either follow the shape of the surface, i.e. curved or bent, or they<br>
can be essentially straight, as shown in figs 4a and 4b respectively.<br>
Before the design of the repeater antenna is described in more detail, one<br>
more aspect of the repeater antenna should be mentioned: the repeater<br>
antenna can be either an active or a passive antenna. In other words, the<br>
repeater antenna can either passively relay signals which have been<br>
received in one beam to be transmitted by another of the antenna beams, or<br>
the received signals can be amplified before they are re-transmitted. One and<br>
the same repeater antenna could in fact be used for both applications: if the<br>
repeater is to be used in a passive mode, the input/output ports to the<br>
respective beams would simply be connected to each other, and if the<br>
repeater is to be used in an active mode, the same ports could be connected<br>
to each other via an external amplifying equipment.<br>
Naturally, the repeater antenna could also be designed as an active or<br>
passive repeater from the beginning.<br>
7<br><br>
Turning now to some examples of the more exact design of the repeater<br>
antenna, the antenna is suitably but not necessarily designed as a so called<br>
"patch antenna". Such an antenna comprises as radiation elements patches<br>
of an electrically conducting material, which have usually been created on a<br>
non-conducting layer or substrate, in a manner which as such is well known<br>
within the art. The "patch" type of antenna will also comprise a ground plane,<br>
i.e. another plane of electrically conducting material, which is spaced apart<br>
from the radiation elements by means of a dielectric material, usually in the<br>
form of a separate physical layer of, but said layer of dielectric material may<br>
also be no more than a layer of air.<br>
The patch antenna also comprises a feeder network, by means of which the<br>
radiation elements are connected to input/output ports of the antenna, and<br>
also possibly to each other, and, where applicable, to other components of<br>
the antenna, such as, for example, phase shifters.<br>
The feed network can be created in the same conducting layer as the<br>
radiation elements, or as a separate network which would then, for example,<br>
be connected to the radiation elements by means of through-holes in the<br>
ground plane.<br>
The design of the feed network for the radiation elements can be chosen<br>
from a large number of principles, such as, for example, connecting radiation<br>
elements so that they form so called travelling wave antennas, or the feed<br>
network can be a Butler matrix antennas or there can even be individual<br>
antenna patches with individual feeder networks.<br>
An example of a travelling wave antenna 500 is shown in fig 5: the antenna<br>
500 comprises at least a first 511 and a second 512 radiation element, which<br>
are arranged in series at a centre distance D from each other.<br>
8<br><br>
Since the radiation elements are connected serially to each other there will<br>
be a first and a second "end element" to which are attached input/output<br>
ports 522, 523, of the antenna 500.<br>
As shown in fig 5, the antenna 500 has a first and a second antenna beam<br>
532, 533, each of which is associated with one of the antenna ports 522, 523.<br>
This means that the first beam 532 may be used by accessing the first port<br>
522, and in a similar way the second beam 533 is associated with the second<br>
port 523. The angle between the beams is determined by the centre distance<br>
D between the antenna elements of the antenna.<br>
As can also be seen in fig 5, the two antenna beams of the travelling wave<br>
antenna are each other's "mirror image" with respect to an imagined line 540<br>
which extends in a direction perpendicular to the antenna. Thus, the two<br>
beams are sometimes referred to as the "plus" or the "minus"-directions.<br>
The Butler matrix antenna will only be commented upon briefly here, since it<br>
is also quite well known within the art. A Butler matrix antenna comprises N<br>
input/output ports, and produces N antenna beams. By means of a network<br>
internal to the Butler matrix, a signal input at any one of the input/output ports<br>
produces equal amplitudes at all of the antenna ports, and a linear phase<br>
progression from (antenna) port to port. If the antenna ports are connected in<br>
sequence to an equally spaced linear antenna array, one antenna beam is<br>
formed for each input/output port.<br>
The internal network may comprise phase shifters and hybrids, and by<br>
externally combining two or more of the input/output ports, the antenna<br>
diagram can be moved, broadened or be given altered side lobe levels.<br>
Fig 6 shows a preferred embodiment 600 of the repeater antenna. As can be<br>
seen here, the antenna comprises a bent surface 620, in this case an<br>
octagonal surface or body. Said body is elongated, i.e. it has a longitudinal<br>
9<br><br>
(y) and a lateral (x) direction of extension, with the longitudinal extension in<br>
this case exceeding the lateral one, and there is arranged a number of arrays<br>
621-623 of antenna elements 621- 621N on each of the flat surfaces of the<br>
octagonal body, so as to afford a 360-degree coverage. Naturally, the body<br>
of the antenna can be hexagonal or any other shape with a plurality of<br>
surfaces in different directions, or it can be cylindrical, as shown in fig 4.<br>
As shown in fig 6, the antenna arrays 621-623 are one-dimensional arrays,<br>
i.e. column arrays, which are arranged to coincide with one of said directions<br>
of extension of the repeater antenna, in this case the lateral extension (y).<br>
Thus, the previously mentioned first and second antenna elements are in this<br>
embodiment part of respective arrays comprising a plurality of antenna<br>
elements.<br>
This array can be one-dimensional, as shown in fig 6, or it can be a two-<br>
dimensional array, said two dimensions being arranged to essentially<br>
coincide with the two main directions of extension of the repeater antenna.<br>
Fig 7 shows another embodiment 700 of a repeater antenna according to the<br>
invention:<br>
The antenna 700, in similarity to the antennas shown previously, has a first<br>
710 and a second 720 plurality of radiation elements, here shown as column<br>
arrays on the sides of an octagon. Both of said pluralities are connected to a<br>
two-dimensional beam forming network, by means of which a plurality of<br>
beams or radiation diagrams can be generated in both the azimuth<br>
(horizontal, "H") and elevation (Vertical, "V") directions. By means of the<br>
antenna 700, separate beams may thus be formed for a number of relevant<br>
areas within a cell, in order to, for example, cover the base station and the<br>
obscured areas "A" described above.<br>
10<br><br>
As indicated in fig 7, in the antenna 700 is a cylindrical array antenna, in this<br>
case an octagon, which, as mentioned, is equipped with beam-forming<br>
networks in two dimensions, both elevation and azimuth, so that a plurality of<br>
beams may be formed in elevation.<br>
As an example, the antenna 700 may feed each individual column with a<br>
separate feeder network, and the signals from the output ports of the vertical<br>
feed networks 720 can be combined using two or more beam-forming<br>
networks 730 in azimuth.<br>
Beam forming could here be carried out in both the vertical and horizontal<br>
(azimuth) direction. Calibration could also be implemented on column-basis<br>
only, i.e. between columns, with fixed beam forming networks within the<br>
columns.<br>
Beam-forming networks (for example Butler matrices) can be applied to one<br>
or both of two orthogonal polarizations (in the case of dual-polarized antenna<br>
elements) and can connect to different numbers of antenna elements in<br>
elevation.<br>
The invention is not limited to the examples of embodiments shown above,<br>
but may be freely varied within the scope of the appended claims. For<br>
example, different polarizations maybe used in the different antenna beams,<br>
or one or more of the antenna elements may be dual polarized.<br>
The radiation elements or antenna elements are typically so called patch<br>
antennas, but can also be dipoles or any other type of radiation elements, as<br>
is well known to those skilled in the field.<br>
It can also be pointed out that the repeater antenna can utilise any number of<br>
the beams it generates in order to achieve the desired coverage. For<br>
example, a repeater antenna with four beams could use one beam to receive<br>
11<br><br>
in and two beams pointed in different directions to retransmit the data it has<br>
received.<br>
