TEMPERATURE PREDICTION SYSTEM AND METHOD<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The invention relates generally to improvements in thermometers and, more<br>
particularly, to electronic predictive thermometers for more rapidly obtaining accurate<br>
temperature measurements from a plurality of patient measurement sites.<br>
It is common practice in the medical arts, as in hospitals and in doctors' offices, to<br>
determine the body temperature of a patient by means of a temperature sensitive device<br>
that measures the temperature and displays that measured temperature. One such device is<br>
a glass bulb thermometer incorporating a heat responsive mercury column that expands<br>
and contracts adjacent a calibrated temperature scale. Typically, the glass thermometer is<br>
inserted into the patient, allowed to remain for a sufficient time interval to enable the<br>
temperature of the thermometer to stabilize at the body temperature of the patient, and<br>
subsequently removed for reading by medical personnel. This time interval is usually on<br>
the order of two to eight minutes.<br>
The conventional temperature measurement procedure using a glass bulb<br>
thermometer or the like is prone to a number of significant deficiencies. Temperature<br>
measurement is rather slow and, for patients who cannot be relied upon (by virtue of age or<br>
infirmity) to properly retain the thermometer for the necessary period of insertion in the<br>
body, may necessitate the physical presence of medical personnel during the relatively<br>
long measurement cycle, thus diverting their attention from other duties. Furthermore,<br>
glass bulb thermometers are not as easy to read and, hence, measurements are prone to<br>
human error, particularly when made under poor lighting conditions or when read by<br>
harried personnel.<br>
Various attempts have been made to minimize or eliminate these deficiencies of the<br>
glass bulb thermometer by using temperature sensing probes that are designed to operate in<br>
conjunction with direct reading electrical thermometer instrumentation. In one such<br>
approach, an electronic temperature sensitive device, such as a thermistor, is mounted at<br>
the end of a probe and inserted into the patient. The change in voltage or current of the<br>
device, depending on the particular implementation, is monitored and when that output<br>
signal stabilizes, a temperature is displayed in digital format. This is commonly referred to<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/107630	PCT/US2006/010998<br>
as the direct reading approach and while it reduces the possibility of error by misreading<br>
the measured temperature, it may still require a relatively long period of time in which to<br>
reach a stabilized temperature reading. In the typical direct reading approach or mode,<br>
anywhere from three to five minutes are required for obtaining a temperature reading.<br>
An inherent characteristic of electronic thermometers is that they do not<br>
instantaneously measure the temperature of the body to which they are applied. It may<br>
take a substantial period of time before the temperature indicated by the thermometer is<br>
representative of the actual temperature of the body measured. This lag is caused by the<br>
various components of the measurement system that impede heat flow from the surface of<br>
the body to the temperature sensor. Some of the components are the sensor tip, the skin<br>
and tissue of the body, and any hygienic covering applied to the sensor tip to prevent<br>
contamination between measurement subjects. This approach therefore provides only a<br>
partial solution.<br>
One attempt to overcome the above-described deficiencies involves the use of a<br>
temperature sensitive electronic probe coupled with prediction or estimation circuitry to<br>
obtain a direct digital display of the patient's temperature before the probe has reached<br>
equilibrium with the patient. With this approach, assuming the patient's temperature is not<br>
significantly changing during the measurement time, the temperature that will prevail upon<br>
thermal stabilization of the electronic thermometer with the patient is predicted from<br>
measured temperatures and is displayed before thermal stabilization is attained. In many<br>
prior devices, prediction of temperature is performed by monitoring the measured<br>
temperature over a period of time, computing derivatives, and processing these variables to<br>
predict the patient's temperature.<br>
With an electronic thermometer that operates by predicting the final, stable<br>
temperature, an advantage is that the temperature measurement is completed before<br>
thermal stabilization is attained, thereby reducing the time required for measurement. This<br>
would lessen the risk that the patient would not hold the probe in the correct position for<br>
the entire measurement time and requires less time of the attending medical personnel.<br>
Another advantage is that, because body temperature is dynamic and may significantly<br>
change during the two to eight minute interval associated with traditional mercury glass<br>
thermometer measurements, a rapid determination offers more timely diagnostic<br>
information. However, a disadvantage with such a thermometer is that the accuracy with<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/107630	PCT/US2006/010998<br>
which temperature is predicted declines markedly unless the processing and analysis of the<br>
data are accurately performed.<br>
Electronic thermometers using predictive-type processing and temperature<br>
determination may include a thermistor as a temperature-responsive transducer. The<br>
thermistor approaches its final stable temperature asymptotically with the last increments<br>
of temperature change occurring very slowly, whereas the major portion of the temperature<br>
change occurs relatively rapidly. Such a temperature response is shown in FIG. 1. A<br>
graph of measured temperature 20 plotted as a function of measurement time 22 and<br>
temperature 24 for a typical thermistor is shown. As discussed above, the temperature 20<br>
indicated by the thermistor lags the actual temperature TF 26 of the subject being<br>
measured. This lag can be seen by comparing the measured temperature line 20 to the<br>
subject's actual temperature line 26. It can be seen that as the measurement progresses<br>
from a start time, t0, the temperature rapidly increases from TR to T1 between times t0 to t1.<br>
The rate of increase in the indicated temperature is reduced between times t1 and t2, and the<br>
temperature line gradually tends toward the stabilization temperature TF 26 asymptotically<br>
as the time increases even more. As discussed above, the present invention is directed to a<br>
system capable of analyzing the temperature data gathered during an early period of the<br>
measurement, for example, between times t1 and t2, and predicting the final temperature<br>
TF. Prior attempts have been made to monitor that initial, more rapid temperature change,<br>
extract data from that change, and estimate the actual temperature of the tissue that is<br>
contacting the thermistor at that time, long before the thermistor actually stabilizes to the<br>
tissue temperature.<br>
A prior approach used to more rapidly estimate the tissue temperature prior to the<br>
thermistor reaching equilibrium with the patient is the sampling of data points of the<br>
thermistor early in its response and from those data points, predicting a curve shape of the<br>
thermistor's response. From that curve shape, an asymptote of that curve and thus the<br>
stabilization temperature can be estimated. To illustrate these concepts through an<br>
example of a simpler system, consider the heat transfer physics associated with two bodies<br>
of unequal temperature as shown in FIG. 2, one having a large thermal mass and the other<br>
having a small thermal mass, placed in contact with each other at time = 0. As time<br>
progresses, the temperature of the small thermal mass and the large thermal mass<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/107630	PCT/US2006/010998<br>
equilibrate to a temperature referred to as the stabilization temperature. The equation<br>
describing this process is as follows:<br><br>
where: T(t) is the temperature of the smaller body as a function of time,<br>
Tp is the stabilization temperature of the system,<br>
TR is the initial temperature of the smaller body,<br>
t is time, and<br>
T is the time constant of the system.<br>
From this relationship, when the temperature T is known at two points in time t, for<br>
example T1 at time t1 and T2 at time t2, the stabilization temperature Tp can be predicted<br>
through application of Equation 2 below.<br><br>
Further, for a simple first order heat transfer system of the type described by<br>
Equation 1, it can be shown that the natural logarithm of the first time derivative of the<br>
temperature is a straight line with slope equal to -1/ as follows:<br><br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/107630	PCT/US2006/010998<br>
T = first derivative of temperature<br>
T" = second derivative of temperature<br>
Prior techniques have applied these simple first order relationships to the analysis<br>
of the temperature equilibration curve. In some cases use has been made of thermistor<br>
time constants established by the thermistor manufacturer. However, all these techniques<br>
have failed to recognize that the temperature response curve cannot be accurately modeled<br>
as first order since it is determined by the complex thermodynamic interactions of the<br>
patient's tissue and vascular system with the hygienic probe cover, sensor, and probe stem.<br>
When the thermometer is placed in contact with body tissue, such as a person's mouth for<br>
example, the response curve is affected by the physical placement of the probe in relation<br>
to that tissue, by the heat transfer characteristics of the particular tissue, by the hygienic<br>
probe cover 34 (FIG. 2) that separates the probe from the tissue, and by heat transfer<br>
through the probe sensing tip and shaft 36, as is shown in FIG. 3. Each of these factors 36<br>
in FIG. 3 affect the flow of heat from the thermistor and each possesses distinct<br>
thermodynamic qualities including thermal resistance and heat capacity. The biological<br>
factors 38 affect the flow of heat to the thermistor and vary significantly between patients,<br>
in particular with age and body composition. The factors, combined with the spatial<br>
geometry of the structures, cause the temperature sensed at the thermistor to follow a more<br>
complex characteristic curve than is predictable from a simple model such as that obtained<br>
using a priori factory-supplied time constant of the thermistor alone.<br>
Previous estimation techniques have depended on the assumption that the<br>
temperature rise following skin contact followed an exponential curve (so called Newton<br>
"heating"). Such a model would be accurate under conditions where an infinite and well-<br>
stirred source of heat was available to warm the sensor, again as illustrated by FIG. 2. A<br>
probe cover 34 is mounted over the temperature sensor or probe 32 which is immersed in a<br>
large source of water 30 with specific heat and an initial temperature "Tw(0)". The probe<br>
has a thermal mass "M" and an initial temperature "Tp(O)". The probe cover has a thermal<br>
resistance "R". Under these ideal conditions the flow of heat from the water bath to the<br>
probe is controlled by the simple equation:<br><br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/107630	PCT/US2006/010998<br>
where Q = flow _ of _ heat<br>
Solving the differential equation for probe temperature at any time yields an<br>
equation of the form following for the probe temperature at any time "t" following<br>
immersion in the water:<br><br>
The "time constant" of the thermal rise is determined largely by "M" the product of<br>
the thermal mass of the probe and "R" the thermal resistance of the probe cover.<br>
Application of this simple model to the warming of a temperature probe placed in<br>
contact with a portion of the body such as the mouth or the axilla fails to account for the<br>
finite heat capacity of the tissues in the immediate region of the probe and for the thermal<br>
resistance of the successive layers of tissue beginning with epidermal layer and proceeding<br>
to the inner structures.<br>
In particular, as the probe temperature increases, heat from the immediate region in<br>
contact with the probe has been removed requiring additional heat energy to travel through<br>
more tissue in order to reach the probe. This "remote" heat energy thus has a longer "time<br>
constant" than heat energy that has flowed into the probe from more proximate regions.<br>
At any time "t", there will be a temperature difference between the current value<br>
and the final value given by:<br><br>
Thus the limits of Equation 2 to model the complex conduction in body tissue may be seen<br>
by considering that the "rate of change" of temperature it predicts remains a constant<br>
proportion of the temperature change remaining to occur at any point in time.<br>
The need therefore has arisen for a measurement system that can predict<br>
stabilization temperatures and can adapt to the changing heat flow characteristics of both<br>
the body under measurement and the measurement system itself, unlike a first order model.<br>
Prediction techniques have been proposed that use sets of simultaneous equations solved in<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/107630	PCT/US2006/010998<br>
real time to yield a likely temperature rise curve that indicates the stabilization<br>
temperature. To be successful, such techniques require use of equations with substantial<br>
numbers of coefficients so that the shape of the rise curve can be adequately approximated.<br>
Practical constraints limit the number of terms that can be employed and thus impose<br>
limits of the accuracy of such approaches. Furthermore, the computational solution of<br>
these equations is not a trivial matter when relatively simple, low power, microprocessor<br>
circuitry is used in the thermometer.<br>
It is also noteworthy that while manufacturers can develop very sophisticated<br>
medical devices, the question of cost must be constantly kept in mind. Manufacturers<br>
strive to keep the cost of medical equipment as low as possible so that they can be made<br>
available to a wide variety of patients. While a thermometer with a much larger processor,<br>
with much faster computational speed, with much larger memory size could be made<br>
available so that computations could be performed faster and many more computations<br>
could be performed, the question of cost arises. Such increase in processing power would<br>
substantially increase the cost of a thermometer and may consequently make it unavailable<br>
to many patients. Instead, those skilled in the art desire a thermometer that is cost efficient<br>
but through the use of robust, accurate, and rapidly executing algorithms, is able to provide<br>
through sophisticated temperature data processing, accurate and fast prediction of the<br>
patient's temperature.<br>
A need has also been recognized for a single thermometer that can measure<br>
temperature at the oral, rectal, and axilla sites of a patient. Various factors may come into<br>
play with a particular patient that make one or more of these sites unavailable for use in<br>
temperature measurement. Therefore a thermometer that can measure all three sites would<br>
provide a desired advantage over the need to find different thermometers for different sites.<br>
It should be recognized that measuring the temperature at the axilla site of a patient differs<br>
significantly from the oral and rectal sites. The temperature response of a probe to the<br>
axilla site is in most cases much different from the oral and rectal sites. Due to the fact<br>
that this site is composed of non-mucous epidermal tissues with an underlying stratum of<br>
fatty tissues, the curvature of the temperature response of a probe located in the axilla is<br>
much flatter than that of oral and rectal sites (see FIG. 6 where curve 100 is typical for an<br>
oral site and curve 102 is typical for a axillary site).<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/107630	PCT/US2006/010998<br>
While prior predictive thermometry techniques have advanced the art of electronic<br>
thermometry significantly, those skilled in the art have recognized that a need still exists<br>
for an electronic thermometer that can predict a stabilization temperature at an early stage<br>
of the measurement process where measurement conditions and the characteristics of the<br>
subject under measurement vary from measurement to measurement. Additionally, it has<br>
been recognized that a need exists for a single thermometer that can measure and predict<br>
the patient's temperature from multiple sites, such as all of the oral, rectal, and axilla sites.<br>
Further, a need exists for a medical thermometer that is accurate, yet comprises relatively<br>
simple, inexpensive circuitry. The invention fulfills these needs and others.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Briefly and in general terms, the present invention provides a thermometer and<br>
method for determining the temperature of a subject by predicting the subject's<br>
temperature at an early stage of the measurement process. The thermometer system and<br>
method of the present invention adapt a nonlinear model containing multiple parameters to<br>
fit a model curve to the monitored temperature data. The parameters are selected at an<br>
early portion of the temperature rise curve and from the resulting model curve, the<br>
equilibrium temperature of the sensor, and hence the subject, is predicted. In this way, the<br>
predictive process is adaptive with respect to the thermal characteristics of the<br>
thermometer probe as well as the anatomy and physiology of the subject, and requires<br>
relatively little data acquisition and data processing time while yielding accurate<br>
predictions of the equilibrium temperature of the sensor.<br>
In one detailed aspect, one of the parameters, the "curvature index" C, is typically<br>
evaluated over a range of values appropriate to the selected anatomical site of<br>
measurement. Because of the adaptive characteristic of the thermometer system and<br>
method in accordance with the invention, multiple sites on a patient may be measured with<br>
a single thermometer.<br>
In other aspects, a sensor provides temperature signals in response to sensing the<br>
temperature of the subject, the temperature signals varying in time. A processor monitors<br>
the temperature signals over a first selected time frame, determines a selected<br>
characteristic subset of temperature samples of the first time frame, provides or "fits" a<br>
model temperature curve based on calculations of a set of nonlinear curve fitting<br>
parameters of the characteristics of the monitored temperature signals and based on the<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/107630	PCT/US2006/010998<br>
model curve, predicts the temperature of the subject. In a more detailed aspect, the<br>
processor selects the first time frame from a time period occurring before the sensor<br>
reaches the temperature of the subject and uses the nonlinear curve fitting parameters to<br>
provide the model curve to calculate a prediction of the temperature of the subject. In<br>
another more detailed aspect, the processor compares the model curve to the monitored<br>
temperature data and if the differences do not exceed a threshold, the processor predicts<br>
the subject's temperature from the model curve and displays it. In another more detailed<br>
aspect, the processor employs model parameters determined for the selected region to<br>
compute an offset term that is a linear function of the selected model parameter. In<br>
another more detailed aspect, the model parameter used to compute an offset term is<br>
related to the curvature parameter. In another more detailed aspect, the processor employs<br>
a time delay before the start of the selected prediction window to compute an offset term<br>
that is a linear function of the selected model parameter.<br>
In further aspects, the processor compares the nonlinear curve fitting of the selected<br>
first time frame to a predetermined integrity criterion and if the predicted temperature from<br>
the first frame does not meet the integrity criterion, the processor excludes the first time<br>
frame from its calculation of the temperature of the subject.<br>
In another aspect, the processor compares the aspects of the monitored temperature<br>
data to integrity criteria and if any characteristics of the monitored temperature data do not<br>
satisfy the integrity criteria, the processor does not use the data to predict the temperature<br>
of the subject. In yet further detailed aspect, one of the integrity criteria comprises a<br>
curvature quality of the monitored temperature data. In another further detailed aspect,<br>
another of the integrity criteria comprise a slope limit of the monitored temperature data.<br>
In yet another aspect, if the monitored temperature data does not satisfy the integrity<br>
criteria, the processor selects a different window of monitored temperature data to compare<br>
to the integrity criteria.<br>
In yet another aspect, the processor monitors the temperature signals over a second<br>
selected time frame if the first selected time frame is excluded in determining the<br>
temperature of the subject. Further, the processor selects the second time frame to occur<br>
after the first time frame in one aspect and in another aspect, the processor selects the<br>
second time frame to overlap the first time frame.<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/107630	PCT/US2006/010998<br>
In a broader aspect, the processor monitors the temperature signals over a plurality<br>
of different selected time frames if the preceding time frame is excluded from the<br>
determination of the temperature of the subject and the processor limits the number of the<br>
plurality of time frames monitored to those occurring within a predetermined period before<br>
the sensor reaches the temperature of the subject.<br>
In a different aspect, the processor determines a start time at which the sensor has<br>
begun sensing the temperature of the subject and the processor selects the first time frame<br>
to include temperature signals occurring after the start time. In a more detailed aspect, the<br>
processor determines that the sensor is sensing the temperature of the subject by<br>
calculating the current value of the temperature signals from the sensor and when the<br>
current value exceeds a tissue contact threshold temperature, sets the start time based on<br>
the calculation.<br>
Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from<br>

In the following description, like reference numerals will be used to refer to like or<br>
corresponding elements in the different figures of the drawings. Referring now to the<br>
drawings, and particularly to FIG. 4, there is shown one embodiment of an electronic<br>
thermometer 40 incorporating novel features of the present invention. The electronic<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/107630	PCT/US2006/010998<br>
thermometer contains a probe 42 for sensing the temperature of a selected part of the<br>
patient's body, connected by conductors 44 to the main body 46 of the thermometer. The<br>
probe has been removed from a storage well 48 in the main body. The main body of the<br>
thermometer contains the electrical components and power supply of the thermometer, and<br>
also has a display 50 for displaying temperature values and error or alarm messages, and a<br>
first input device 52, which in this case, is an on/off switch located below the display. A<br>
MODE switch 54 is also provided at the front panel 56 of the main body to select the site<br>
and method of processing the temperature data more appropriately so that the<br>
characteristics of sites are considered during temperature measurement. In one<br>
embodiment, the MODE switch provides the selections of "FAST ORAL," "FAST<br>
AXILLARY," and "FAST RECTAL." A second probe 58 is included with the<br>
thermometer and is shown in the stored position inserted in a well 60 of the main body. In<br>
accordance with the present embodiment, one probe is to be used for measuring a patient's<br>
oral and axillary temperatures and the other probe is to be used for rectal temperature<br>
measurement. Also shown is an hygienic cover 62 for placement over a probe before<br>
contact with the patient.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the block diagram generally shows major electronic<br>
components of one embodiment of a thermometer 40 in accordance with aspects of the<br>
present invention. The temperature sensor 42 provides temperature signals in response to<br>
the temperature sensed during measurement. There also exists the probe cover 62 located<br>
between the patient and the sensor of the probe. In the case where a thermistor is used as<br>
the temperature sensor, these signals are analog voltages representative of the resistance of<br>
the thermistor and therefore representative of the sensed temperature. The signals<br>
representative of temperature are amplified by the amplifier 70 and then are converted into<br>
digital form for further processing by an analog-to-digital converter 72. The analog-to-<br>
digital converter is connected to a processor 74 that receives the digitized voltage signals<br>
and processes them to determine the temperature of the subject being measured. A<br>
memory 76 stores the temperature and time signal data, along with algorithms, so that the<br>
signal data can be analyzed at a subsequent time. Once the signals have been processed,<br>
the processor provides a signal to the display 78 to display the predicted stabilization<br>
temperature. The probe includes a heater device that is controlled by a heater power<br>
source 80. The processor controls the probe heater to raise the temperature of the probe to<br>
a set point once it is withdrawn from the well of the body by turning on the heater power<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/107630	PCT/US2006/010998<br>
source. Such a set point is typically 93°F (33.9°C) but other temperatures may be selected.<br>
Activating a switch enables the temperature measurement functions of the thermometer.<br>
This switch is preferably located within the probe storage well such that removal of the<br>
probe automatically enables the measurement. A power supply 82 is provided for the<br>
power needs of the various components. Specific connections between the power supply<br>
and the components are not shown to retain clarity of the illustration; however those<br>
skilled in the art well understand such connections.<br>
Although the electronic predictive thermometer is shown in a particular<br>
embodiment in FIG. 5, this is for illustrative purposes only. The memory 76 may actually<br>
comprise multiple memory devices. The processor 74 may comprise multiple processors.<br>
The user interface 78 may comprise multiple switches or displays. It will be apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art that various modifications may be made to FIG. 5.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 6, general functions (tasks) of an embodiment of a method<br>
in accordance with aspects of the invention are shown, along with the data that flows<br>
among them. The tasks may run concurrently or in sequence, and some tasks shown may<br>
not run during a particular measurement carried out by the system. A data flow does not<br>
imply an activation sequence; control and activation are not shown on this diagram.<br>
The thermometer system is initialized 90 and data from the temperature sensor<br>
begins to be generated. When sufficient temperature samples (data) have been acquired,<br>
they are then filtered 92. The filtering depends on the filter type, order, and model<br>
implemented. In one case, a simple boxcar averager/decimator is used. Other more<br>
sophisticated filters may be used. The filtered temperature data is then used by the<br>
processor in calculating a predicted temperature 94. Once an acceptable calculation of<br>
predicted temperature has been made, it is displayed 96.<br>
A generalized embodiment of a means for making temperature prediction for each<br>
of three oral, rectal, and axillary sites will now be discussed Operator selection of a<br>
chosen site determines a selected set of control parameters and thresholds for use at that<br>
site.<br>
Overview of ABCE Nonlinear Multi-parameter Curve Fit Prediction<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/107630	PCT/US2006/010998<br>
Estimation or prediction of the temperature at a defined future time (such as a time<br>
at which the sensor would be expected to have equilibrated with the patient's temperature)<br>
is performed by fitting a non-linear multi-parameter model (Equation 9) to a sequence of<br>
filtered temperature samples (a "window") occurring following tissue contact (see FIG. 8).<br>
where: <br>
Tfu (n • ) is the estimate of the temperature at a particular time t = n •  (°F);<br>
n is an integer sample index initialized to 0 at the first sample meeting conditions<br>
for "Prediction Start";<br>
x is the number of seconds per sample (sec);<br>
A is the "offset" parameter (°F or °C);<br>
B is the "span" or "range" parameter (°F or °C);<br>
C is the "curvature" or "rate of equilibration" parameter (sec -1); and<br>
E is the "time warp" factor (unit-less) that may be used to make a nonlinear<br>
modification of the curvature of the model curve to make it better fit the<br>
curve of the temperature data.<br>
If the fit achieved in the first window does not meet criteria for prediction, the window is<br>
"slid" forward by one measurement sample (one second average of ten samples, see details<br>
of TAD computation below) and the model parameters are recomputed.<br>
For each of a number of discrete values of C and E, model parameters (A, B) are<br>
computed using linear least squares optimization methods. The solution set of A, B, C,<br>
and E that achieves the minimum "sum squared error" measured as the difference between<br>
model curve values and the window data element values is termed Am, Bm, Cm, and Em<br>
for that window. If this value is less than a defined threshold and other curvature quality<br>
("CQI" described below) and slope conditions ("Windowslope" also described below) are<br>
met in this window, the parameters ABC are used to predict temperature using Equation 10<br>
below.<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/107630	PCT/US2006/010998<br><br>
where:<br>
D(Cm) is the "curvature adjustment factor";<br>
D(T) is the "time adjustment factor";<br>
Do is the offset constant;<br>
w is the number of seconds elapsed since Prediction Start occurred; and<br>
n •  is the number of seconds in the future, relative to Start of Prediction, when the<br>
temperature is to be estimated.<br>
It will be noted that the exponent "E" for Cm (see Eq. 9) has been set to "1" in the<br>
embodiment of FIG. 10. However in another embodiment, it may be set to a value other<br>
than "1" to more precisely fit the model curve to the curvature of the temperature data.<br>
The temperature data is time dependent, that is, each data point was taken at a discrete<br>
point in time. When the data points are interconnected to show a temperature data<br>
"curve", such a curve has time as one axis and can therefore also be thought of as a time<br>
curve. This exponent "E" nonlinearly modifies the curvature of the model curve to more<br>
precisely match the curvature of the temperature/time data and is therefore referred to as a<br>
"time warp" factor since it alters the model curve in a time sense. Varying the exponent<br>
"E" to more precisely match the data curve would require more processing time and<br>
power.<br>
The model curve produced by Equation 10 predicts the rate of the probe<br>
temperature when being "warmed" by contact with tissue. The design requires higher C<br>
values for oral/rectal measurements compared to axillary due to the difference in heat<br>
transfer at these locations. A rough comparison is shown in FIG. 7. The graph line 100<br>
presents a typical shape of the temperature response to the oral and rectal sites. The graph<br>
line 102 presents a typical shape of the temperature response to the axillary site. It is<br>
apparent that the curvature for the oral and rectal sites is much greater than that of the<br>
axillary site. Some control parameters and thresholds are also different for axillary vs<br>
oral/rectal mode. These differences are described below.<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/107630	PCT/US2006/010998<br>
Further, once the various values of the factors have been determined (A, B, C, and<br>
D), the time of n • x can then be entered to determine the prediction of the equilibrium<br>
temperature. As an example, the value of 180 seconds may be entered for an oral or rectal<br>
measurement while a value of 300 seconds may be entered for an axillary measurement.<br>
The result of solving equation 10 (Tprcdict) will then be the equilibrium temperature.<br>
The factors D(C), D(w), and D0 compensate for minor systematic errors in the<br>
prediction which may arise in part when the E term is fixed. D(C) is a linear adjustment of<br>
the form:<br><br>
where:<br>
Cstope is a constant;<br>
C is the estimated value associated with the smallest sum square error.<br>
D(w) similarly is the form:<br>
where: <br>
w is the time elapsed since Prediction Start (seconds) at the time the current<br>
window is evaluated; and<br>
Do is constant which is used to remove bias effects of D(w) and D(C) as well as<br>
minor systematic offsets statistically observed in population studies.<br>
The range of "C" values used and the values for the "D" terms have been selected<br>
based on actual temperature tests of a wide, randomly-selected subject population. Based<br>
on those actual temperature tests, all of these values have been set to optimize the<br>
performance of the prediction of temperature for this wide population of subjects.<br>
However, as is apparent to those skilled in the art, the values may be changed depending<br>
on test results with other subject populations. It should also be noted that some or all of<br>
the "D" terms may go to a zero value, depending on the actual data measured. Further, if<br>
the exponent "E" for the "C" term in Eq. 9 is used to control the curvature of the model,<br>
the "D" terms may not be needed and can be set to zero. The "D" terms are used to<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/107630	PCT/US2006/010998<br>
provide some compensation for the shape of the model curve when the exponent "E" is set<br>
to one, as in Eq. 10. This embodiment of setting the exponent "E" to one and using the<br>
linear "D" terms was found to lower the demands on the processor yet yield accurate<br>
prediction results.<br>
If the estimated temperature is outside the Low or High Prediction limits, the<br>
instrument automatically transitions to the "Continuous Monitoring State." The<br>
"Continuous Monitoring State" is the state in which the thermometer does not predict the<br>
temperature of the subject but instead simply remains active until it has equilibrated with<br>
the temperature of the subject. Depending on the anatomical site selected, contact, fluid<br>
coupling, and pressure applied, this may take from three to eight minutes.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates a typical temperature profile and key features of the prediction<br>
process. When the probe 42 is removed from the instrument "well" 48 (see FIG. 4), it is<br>
typically at room ambient temperature. The probe heater power supply 80 (see FIG. 5) is<br>
activated 110 bringing the probe temperature to a target setpoint by means of the probe<br>
heater, but it may overshoot several degrees and oscillate, particularly if the probe cover 62<br>
is not mounted on the probe. The probe cover is then mounted to the probe. When the<br>
probe with cover is placed in contact with tissue, the temperature rises from the setpoint<br>
surpassing Tissue Contact Threshold 112 causing the heater to shut off.<br>
Determination of Prediction Start is accomplished by detection of the raw (100 ms)<br>
temperature exceeding Tissue Contact Threshold followed by a fixed, mode-dependent<br>
time delay. The delay is extended if the raw temperature falls below the Tissue Contact<br>
Threshold before reaching the Prediction Start condition.<br>
Beginning with the raw sample meeting criteria for Prediction Start 114, raw<br>
temperature samples in blocks of 10 are averaged and stored producing an array (window)<br>
116 of ten filtered samples. Each such average of ten is referred to as a "TAD"<br>
(Temperature Averaged and Decimated). If any TAD value is less than the maximum<br>
TAD value recorded by more than 1 °F ( 0.5°C), the instrument state is changed to<br>
Continuous Monitoring State since loss of tissue contact is presumed to have occurred.<br>
The TAD samples in each window are used to compute a curvature quality index<br>
(CQI) and a Window Slope value. These values, together with the Sum Squared Error<br>
(SSE) must all meet specified criteria in order for a prediction to be presented. If they are<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/107630	PCT/US2006/010998<br>
not met, a subsequent window is formed as follows. The TAD value for each successive<br>
second is added to the estimation window, and the oldest TAD value is removed until<br>
either a successful individual window prediction is produced or the maximum number of<br>
windows (MaxNumWindows) has been reached.<br>
If the final window is reached, and its SSE, CQI, and WindowSlope values do not<br>
achieve specified thresholds, then the SSE of the final window is compared against a<br>
threshold FSSE. If this is successful, then the prediction from the final window is made,<br>
otherwise the instrument transition into the Continuous Monitoring State. For any<br>
prediction that is otherwise qualified, if the predicted temperature is outside the Low or<br>
High prediction limits, the instrument automatically transitions to the Continuous<br>
Monitoring State.<br>
Several other conditions may initiate transition from the Prediction to the<br>
Continuous Monitoring state. These conditions are set by the software routines controlling<br>
the heater and monitoring the probe for failure of the thermistor. They are shown in FIG.<br>
12 for completeness and described elsewhere in this specification.<br>
Temperature Averaging and Decimation (TAD processing)<br>
The instrument samples a voltage from the temperature probe amplifier 70 (FIG.<br>
5), and digitally converts this value at 100 millisecond intervals. For efficiency and noise<br>
suppression, the 100 millisecond ("raw) samples are pre-filtered with a simple boxcar<br>
averager/decimator (Equation 13) to produce "temperature averaged decimated" or "TAD"<br>
samples at one second intervals.<br><br>
where N is the number of TAD samples/window, and where the first sample of the first<br>
TAD is that sample after the Prediction Start Delay 118. Prediction Start Delay in turn<br>
begins with the first sample exceeding the tissue contact temperature of 94°F (34.4°C). If<br>
during the Start Delay period, the raw temperature falls below the Tissue Contact<br>
Threshold, the Prediction Start Delay Timer is reset.<br>
Prediction Window Sample Selection<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/107630	PCT/US2006/010998<br>
Thermal equilibration curves frequently contain artifacts arising from several<br>
sources. The system and method in accordance with aspects of the invention attempt to<br>
avert the effects of artifacts through optimized selection of input data. In the first few<br>
seconds following tissue contact, residual effects of the probe heating may affect the<br>
equilibration curve shape. The sooner the probe contacts tissue after removal from the<br>
instrument, the more likely these effects are to be present. Variation in the position and/or<br>
compression of the probe cover with the skin varies the thermal resistance between tissue<br>
and cover. This affects both the shape of the thermal equilibration curve and the<br>
magnitude of the equilibration temperature.<br>
In order to mitigate the effects of noise sources, the algorithm computes multiple<br>
estimates from "time windows" each consisting of a fixed number of TAD samples each<br>
(see block diagram, FIG. 12. In order to determine whether the estimate from a particular<br>
window is suitable for prediction or whether the measurement window must be advanced<br>
(slid) to the next incoming TAD value, three metrics are computed.<br>
1.  The first qualification measure is the window Sum Square Error (SSE) (Equation<br>
14). In the case where the final window permitted is reached, the SSE value of the final<br>
window is used to determine whether a prediction should be displayed or whether the<br>
instrument should make a transition to the Continuous Monitoring State when unable to<br>
make a reliable prediction.<br><br>
2.  The second qualification measure is the "Curvature Quality Index" (CQI). Its<br>
purpose is to detect artifacts in the window TAD data that would cause the temperature<br>
curve to deviate from a normally concave downward shape (see FIG. 1). Beginning with<br>
the third TAD of a window, each three TAD values are evaluated to determine their<br>
"curvature". In one embodiment, the second point of a series of three must have a value<br>
that is equal to or higher than the average of the first and third points or the CQI will be<br>
considered to be unacceptable. If any of the triplet of TAD's in a window fail to meet the<br>
curvature criterion then that window is not usable for prediction and the algorithm must<br>
advance the window one step (one TAD).<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/107630	PCT/US2006/010998<br><br>
where:<br>
w is the index of the estimation window running from 1 to NumWindows<br>
N is the number of TAD's per window and the TAD index runs from 1 to<br>
NumWindows + N-1<br>
Note that the "if POSITIVE" operator indicates that if the value inside the parenthesis to the<br>
right is positive, it will be added to the sum. If the value is negative, it is not added to the<br>
sum. The CQI value for each window must equal or less than CQIThreshold in order for<br>
the estimate from a given window to be used to produce an immediate displayed<br>
prediction.<br>
3. The third qualification measure is the slope of the window (WindowSlope) which<br>
is simply computed as the difference between the first and the last TAD in each window.<br>
If the value exceeds the limit SlopeThreshold, then the next window must be selected or<br>
the final window evaluated.<br>
WindowSlope = TAD (NumTADs -1) - TAD (0)	(Eq. 16)<br>
where NumTADs is number of TAD samples in a window<br>
WindowSlope has been found to be quite helpful in the case of a subject who has a<br>
very high temperature, such as 104°F (40°C). In many cases, the temperature data curve of<br>
such a patient has a very high slope initially and could lead the processor to predict a<br>
temperature that is much higher than the subject's actual temperature. In accordance with<br>
the WindowSlope feature, when the slope is too high, indicating a possible "hot" subject,<br>
the processor will wait for a subsequent window of data. Subsequent data may be closer to<br>
a point where the temperature data of the subject begins to be more asymptotic and a<br>
prediction would be accurate. In one embodiment, in the event that no window meets the<br>
criteria for immediate prediction an alternate opportunity is provided once the<br>
LastWindow is reached. The SSE of the final window is compared against a threshold<br>
FinalWindowSumSquareThreshold. If this criterion is met, then a prediction is computed<br>
for the final window.<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2006/107630	PCT/US2006/010998<br>
Estimation Processing<br>
To produce an estimate, an estimation window must be completed by acquiring and<br>
producing the needed TAD samples. Next the TAD samples are processed to determine<br>
the fit parameters A, B, and C as well as the qualification measures, SSE, CQI, and<br>
WindowSlope.<br>
A and B are determined using least squares estimation methods (LSE), but due to<br>
the non-linear nature of Equation 9, C and E must be determined by computing the sum<br>
squared error for each value of C, E and finding the C, E values along with corresponding<br>
A and B values producing the minimum Sum Square Error ("SSE"). It has been found<br>
sufficient to choose C, E from a finite range of possible values for a particular body site.<br>
The mouth and rectum have sufficiently similar and relatively high thermal conductivity to<br>
use one range of C, E values. While the axilla, possessing lower average heat<br>
conductivity, uses a distinct and lower range of C, E values. In one embodiment in order<br>
to determine A and B, three fixed arrays of constants are constructed for each of the C<br>
values and E is set to a value of one and is not varied. FIG. 9 presents the determination of<br>
the A, B, and C parameters in the present embodiment. The processor selects each of<br>
fifteen C values with its associated A and B parameters and takes the sum squared error for<br>
each. The C value along with its associated A and B parameters with the lowest error is<br>
used in Equation 10 to compute the predicted temperature.<br>
FIG. 9 and FIG. 10 present a technique in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
invention in which the model temperature curve is precisely fit to the actual temperature<br>
measurement data points. In FIG. 9, various curves are shown, all of which are applied to<br>
the actual temperature measurement data points 126 shown in FIG. 10. In FIG. 10, it is<br>
shown that a model curve 128 having certain parameters A1, B1, and C1 has been fit to the<br>
data points. The errors e1 through e6, that is, differences between the data points and the<br>
model curve, are determined, and the sum squared error is taken. In one embodiment, if<br>
the SSE of this model curve is the lowest, it is used as the model curve for the temperature<br>
data of this measurement. Any well known least squares estimation routine can be used, as<br>
is well known to those skilled in the art. In an alternate embodiment, the two values of C<br>
producing the minimum SSE can be determined. From these two values an intermediate<br>
value of C is determined for which the SSE is computed. If this SSE is less than both the<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2006/107630	PCT/US2006/010998<br>
initial two SSE values, then it is used or the process is repeated until the SSE either falls<br>
below an acceptable threshold or ceases to decrease.<br>
Tissue Contact Detection, Start, and Restart of Prediction<br>
The time limit of detection of Tissue Contact for purposes of determining total<br>
prediction time is defined as the time of the last raw temperature sample (100 ms) to<br>
exceed the TissueContact Threshold temperature prior to a prediction. This sample will be<br>
referred to as the TC sample.<br>
The Start of Prediction sample (SOP) occurs following PredictStartDelay sample<br>
(raw samples). Note that if any sample following TC equals or fails below<br>
TissueContactThreshold, then the TC value is reset, prediction is halted and reset and the<br>
prediction start delay restarts. Thus the index value of SOP is defined as below:<br>
SOP = TC + PredictStartDelay	(Eq. 17)<br>
In the example of FIGS. 8 and 11, the first TC 120 is reset due to raw temperature 122<br>
falling below the TissueContactThreshold 112. Subsequently a final TC 124 is found with<br>
associated relative index = 1. Following PredictStartDelay 118 of samples, the<br>
StartPrediction 114 sample occurs, this sample is the first sample of the first TAD.<br>
Loss of Tissue Contact Detection<br>
Tissue contact may be lost at some point prior to a prediction being completed.<br>
This condition is detected when a TAD sample occurs that is less than the maximum TAD<br>
value by a preset margin.<br>
FIG. 12 provides a data flow diagram coupled to a diagram of a graph line 130 of<br>
the temperature response for a temperature sensor used in a predictive technique.<br>
Temperature samples 132 shown as dots in the graph line are taken each 100 milliseconds<br>
in this embodiment. During the interval 134, the heater brings the temperature of the<br>
sensor to a target preheat temperature typically about 1°F ( 0.5°C) below the tissue<br>
contact threshold 136, in this case 94°F (34.4°C). The graph line is shown in FIG. 11<br>
traversing the tissue contact threshold seven times. Due to a start delay 138, TAD<br>
computation processing 140 does not occur until the seventh time 142 the tissue contact<br>
threshold is crossed.<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2006/107630	PCT/US2006/010998<br>
The start delay operation avoids premature commencement of the prediction<br>
process by requiring that the sampled temperature must remain above the tissue-contact-<br>
threshold for at least an interval (typically 0.5 seconds ) before prediction processing<br>
commences. Even when this condition is satisfied, should the sampled temperature fall<br>
below the tissue-contact-threshold, the prediction process is aborted and sampling resumes<br>
to determine when, or if the sampled temperature again exceeds the tissue-contact-<br>
threshold as discussed above. Should the sampled temperature not exceed the tissue-<br>
contact-threshold for one minute, the mode is automatically transitioned to the Continuous<br>
Monitoring State together with associated audible notification and changes to the display<br>
indicators.<br>
Once sampled data exceeds the tissue-contact-threshold for the required time, the<br>
TAD values, shown as dashes, are computed in a first window 144 and in subsequent<br>
windows if a temperature prediction cannot be made from the first window. The functions<br>
of "predict temp from current window" 146, SSE 148, CQI 150, FSSE 152, final window<br>
154, and loss of tissue contact 156 are all performed from the TAD values as was<br>
described above. Logic is shown in FIG. 12 for these functions.<br>
Logical AND gate 162 is used to control whether the prediction from the current<br>
window is used and presented or whether the window must be advanced by one TAD<br>
value. Specifically the results of three comparisons must all be true in order for the output<br>
of 162 to be true causing the present prediction to be displayed. The three inputs are<br>
formed as follows. The SSE is compared 158 to a SSE Threshold 160, the CQI is<br>
compared 164 to a CQI threshold 166, and the window slope 168 is compared 170 to a<br>
windowslope threshold 172. The outputs of the three comparison operators 158, 164 and<br>
170 are presented at the input of AND gate 162.<br>
If the final window has been reached, a distinct set of rules are applied to determine<br>
whether the prediction of that window is displayed or transition to the Continuous<br>
Monitoring State occurs. Logical AND gate 178 is used to control transmission of the<br>
prediction produced by the final window to the user display via transmission gate 184.<br>
Specifically the results of two comparisons must both be true in order for the output of<br>
gate 178 to be true which in turn will permit transmission gate 184 to pass the prediction to<br>
the display 196. The two logical inputs are formed as follows. The FSSE 152 is tested by<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2006/107630	PCT/US2006/010998<br>
comparator 174 to an FSSE threshold 176 and the final window state 154 is assessed<br>
whether true or false, this logical signal is also sent to AND gate 178.<br>
Several logical conditions may arise that cause transition of the instrument's<br>
operating state to the Continuous Monitoring State 188. The logical OR gate 186 when<br>
true causes transition to the Continuous Monitoring State. Its inputs include the output of<br>
AND gate 182, which in turn receives two logical signals, one from the final window logic<br>
154, and the other from the inverted 180 output of comparator 174. The logic implements<br>
the following test". . . if the FSSE is greater than the FSSE threshold AND the final<br>
window is currently being used for prediction, then transition to the continuous monitoring •<br>
state."<br>
Additional inputs to logical OR gate 186 include safety and reliability tests<br>
including checking for abnormal initial probe temperature 190 immediately following<br>
probe withdrawal from its well, inability of the heater control logic to attain adequate<br>
temperature rise 192 and determination that the prediction from the final window is outside<br>
a permitted range 194.<br>
Also shown is a gate 195 for presenting the predicted temperature from the current<br>
window 146 on the display 196. However before this can be done, there must be an input<br>
from the AND gate 162 indicating that SSE, CQI, and WindowSlope are all acceptable. In<br>
another feature, the output of the AND gate 162 is provided to an inverter 198 which<br>
provides a signal to Advance the Prediction Window 200.<br>
In accordance with the above, there has been provided a system and a method for<br>
accurately predicting the temperature of a subject. Approximations of the temperature data<br>
curve are not used. Instead an actual curve is fit to the temperature data curve to result in<br>
increased accuracy. A non-linear, multi-parameter model curve is fit to the temperature<br>
measurement data. The multiple parameters are selected in dependence on the particular<br>
temperature measurement data itself thus adapting the model curve to the particular<br>
temperature situation at hand and thereby making it very accurate. Safeguards are<br>
 provided to avoid the use of misleading data, such as from heater effects, subjects having<br>
very high temperatures, and loss of tissue contact. The approach provided is capable of<br>
being conducted by processors having limited processing power yet is able to provide<br>
accurate predictions of the subject's temperature before equilibration occurs.<br>

A thermometer system and method that rapidly predict body temperature based on the temperature signals received<br>
from a temperature sensing probe when it comes into contact with the body. A nonlinear, multi parameter curve fitting process is<br>
performed and depending on the errors in the curve fit, parameters are changed or a prediction of the temperature is made. Criteria<br>
exist for the differences between the curve fit and the temperature data. The processor switches to a Continuous Monitor State if the<br>
curve fit over a limited number of time frames is unacceptable. Determining the start time on which the measurement time frame<br>
for prediction is based is performed by tissue contact threshold coupled with a prediction time delay.<br></td>
