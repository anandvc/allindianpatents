The sleeper is connected to the main track. The main track has steel buttons to which screws through the sleeper will be connected to main track in order to provide necessary width adjustment. The main track is made of Aluminium extrusions section. The sleepers are specially created in the form of specially designed C shape so as to take care of complete load. This system provides highly optimized jerk free motion of the cine camera trolleys, cranes and dollies etc providing variable width adjustments, contributing to space savings and easy transportation.</td>

				<td>The Master Track System according to this invention is for movie trolley tracks for cine field. The present tracks used in the cine field are made of steel pipes welded and provide a jerky motion at all points. The tracks are heavy and do not provide with an adjustment of width as they are welded. The master track system according to the invention eliminates all the above problems as it is a highly sophisticated new invention.<br>
The joints have been made of stainless steel, CNC Machined so as to enable a very perfect joint to ensure smooth and jerk - free motion.<br>
The salient feature of the invention is that the width of the Master track system can be changed so as to suit individual equipmental requirements. This is a special and highly novel feature of this new Master track system. Such a system has never been in existence before. By this invention transportation space requirements are very much reduced.<br>
Sleepers of the Master Tack System have been specially developed and designed with Aluminium so as to bear the burden or weight of the movie trolley, cranes and dollies etc. In the convention and existing system the sleeper is made of steel square or rectangular pipe. In this novel construction it is made of a special C shape illustrated in the drawings. This construction ensures taking of complete load up to 45 feet movie cranes.<br>
It is the primary object of the invention to design a novel master track system which is unique.<br>
It is another object of the invention to design and develop a master track system which is simple in construction, efficient in operation and easy to maintain.<br>
Further objects of the invention will be clear from the following description.<br>
A master track system consisting of pair of main tracks, sleeper being connected to main track wherein main track has steel knobs to which screws through the sleeper will be connected to main tack to provide the necessary width adjustments.<br>
This invention is described in detail with reference to drawings which accompany this specification. The nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed is clearly described in the complete specification.<br>
Fig.l shows the components of the master track system<br>
Fig.2 shows the construction details of main tack and    .<br>
Fig.3 shows the constructional details of sleeper<br>
Fig.l of the drawings shows the complete construction details of master track system. The main track is denoted by numeral (1) and the sleeper is denoted by numeral (2). The construction of the main track is specially designed and developed. The method of construction is by way of extrusion. This eliminates the process of welding. The welding results in fixed width construction of main track. By means of this novel process the width is adjustable. By simple hand twisting the width between main tracks or rails is<br>
-2-<br><br>
adjustable to suit individual equipmental requirements. The main track Aluminium extruded section is specially designed and constructed.<br>
The Master Track System has got bits or pieces of standard lengths of 2-1/2 feet, 5 feet and 7-1/2 feet. These bits are connected to one another to get the required length of the track.<br>
The track width is adjustable to meet the individual equipmental requirements. This is the novelty of this system never in existence before.<br>
The main track is made of Aluminium extrusions, specially designed to ensure a very smooth, jerk free motion of the cine camera trolleys,. Cranes and dollies etc. This new invention contributes to very smooth and jerk free motion. The system has very light weight compared to existing steel pipe fabricated and welded tracks with fixed widths and heavy to carry systems which produce jerks at every point and get rusted and very hard to maintain.<br>
Drawings of the newly invented main track and the sleepers have been illustrated by way of drawings enclosed with the complete specification<br>
The Master track System is a newly invented system to ensure smooth, jerk free motion of the cine camera trolleys, cranes and dollies etc. It also provides variable width adjustments, contributing to space savings and to meet individual equipmental requirements and for easy transportation. The two points mentioned are new inventions, never in existence before.<br>
The various parts of the Master Track System are indicated by numerals, wherein in Fig.l sleeper is represented by numeral 1 and main track is represented by numeral 2.<br>
Salient features are as follows:-<br>
1.	Optimization: The Master Track system is highly optimized for jerk free motion of trolleys, cranes and dollies etc. and also provides width adjustments, contributing to space savings, easy transportations and providing width adjustments to suit individual equipmental requirements.<br>
2.	Secure: It is highly secured and authenticated<br>
3.	Standard: The track system available so far in the markets provide a jerky motion at the joints and are heavy with steel pipes and do not possess width adjustments as they are welded. The Master Track system eliminates all the above problems and this is a highly sophisticated new invention.<br>
4.	Technology: This is a product developed and designed in house after almost 9 years of R&amp;D.<br><br><br>
 CLAIM<br>
1)	A master track system comprising of pair of tracks, a sleeper being connected to<br>
main track having steel knobs to which screws through the sleeper are connected<br>
to main track so as to provide the necessary width adjustments.<br>
2)	A master track system as claimed in claim 1 wherein the main track is made of<br>
aluminium extruded section<br>
3)	A master track system as claimed in claim 1 wherein the sleepers are created in<br>
the form of a designed C section so as to take care of complete load.<br>
4)	A master track system as claimed in clam 1 as described in the complete<br>
specification and as illustrated by way of drawings.</td>
