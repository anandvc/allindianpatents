BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to novel taxanes which have exceptional utility as antitumor agents.<br>
The taxane family of terpenes, of which baccatln HI and taxol are members, has been the subject of considerable interest in both the biological and chemical arts. Taxol itself is employed as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent and possesses a broad range of tumor-inhibiting activity. Taxol has a 2"R. 3"S configuration and the following structural formula:<br><br>
Although taxol and docetaxel are useful chemotherapeutic agents, there are limitations on their effectiveness, including limited efficacy against certain<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Among the objects of the present invention, therefore, is the provision of taxanes which compare favorably to taxol and docetaxel with respect to efficacy as anti-tumor agents and with respect to toxicity. In general, these taxanes possess an ester substituent other than formate, acetate and heterosubstituted acetate at C-10, a hydroxy substituent at C-7 and a range of C-3" substituents.<br>
Briefly, therefore, the present invention is directed to the taxane composition, per se, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the taxane and a phannaceutically acceptable carrier, and to methods of administration.<br>

Taxanes having the general formula 1 may be obtained by treatment of a p-lactam with an alkoxide having the taxane tetracyclic nucleus and a C-13 metallic oxide substituent to form compounds having a P-amido ester substituent at C-13 (as described more fully in Helton U.S. Patent 5,466,834), followed by removal of the hydroxy protecting groups. The p-iactam has the following structural formula (3):<br><br><br>
wherein M is a metal or ammonium, P, is a hydroxy protecting group and R^^ is as previously defined.<br>
Alkoxide 4 may be prepared from 10-deacetylbaccatin III (or a derivative thereof) by selective protection of the C(7) hydroxy! group and then esterification of the C(10)hydroxyl group followed by treatment with a metallic amide. In one embodiment of the present invention, the C{7) hydroxy! group of 10-deacetylbaccatin III is selectively protected with a silyl group as described, for example, by Denis, et. al, (J.Am. Chem. Soc, 1988,110, 5917). In general, the silylating agents may be used either alone or in combination with a catalytic amount of a base such as an alkali metal base.<br>
Alternatively, the C(10) hydroxyl group of a taxane can be selectively acylated in the absence of a base, as described, for example in Holton et al., PCT Patent Application WO 99/09021. Acylating agents which may be used for the selective acylation of the C(1 D) hydroxyl group of a taxane include substituted or unsubstituted alkyl oraryl anhydrides. While the acylation of the C(10) hydroxy group of the taxane will proceed at an adequate rate for many acylating agents, it has been discovered that the reaction rate may be increased by including a Lewis acid in the reaction mixture. Preferred Lewis acids include zinc chloride, stannic chloride, cerium trichloride, cuprous chloride, lanthanum trichloride, dysprosium trichloride, and ytterbium trichloride. Zinc chloride or cerium trichloride is particulariy prefen^ed when the acylating agent is an anhydride.<br>
Derivatives of lO-deacetylbaccatin III having alternative substituents at C{2), C{9) and C(14) and processes for their preparation are known in the art. Taxane derivatives having acyloxy substituents other than benzoyloxy at C(2) may be prepared, for example, as described in Holton et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,728,725 or Kingston et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,002.023. Taxanes having acyloxy or hydroxy substituents at C(9) in place of keto may be prepared, for example as described in Holton et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,011,056 or Gunawardana et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,352,806. Taxanes having a beta hydroxy substituent at C(14) may be prepared from naturally occurring 14-hydroxy-10-deacetylbaccatin 111.<br>
Processes for the preparation and resolution of the p-lactam starting material are generally well known. For example, the [J-!actam may be prepared<br>
a
 <br>
in PCT Patent Application No. 00/41204. In a preferred embodiment in whicti the p-lactam is fury! substituted at the C(4) position, the p-lactam can be prepared as illustrated in the following reaction scheme:<br><br><br>
substance which Is phannaceuticaliy inert, confers a suitable consistency or form to the composition, and does not diminish 1he therapeutic efficacy of the antitumor compounds. The carrier is "pharmaceutically or pharmacologically acceptable" if it does not produce an adverse, allergic or other untoward reaction when administered to a mammal or human, as appropriate.<br>
The phannaceutical compositions containing the antitumor compounds of the present invention n^ay be formulated in any conventional manner. Proper fomiulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. The compositions of the invention can be formulated for any route of administration so long as the target tissue is available via that route. Suitable routes of administration include, but are not limited to, oral, parenteral {e.g., intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, rectal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraorbital, intracapsular, intraspinal, intraperitoneal, or intrastemal), topical {nasal, transdennal, intraocular), intravesical, intrathecal, enteral, pulmonary, intralymphatic, intracavital, vaginal, transurethral, intradennai, aural, intramammary, buccal, orthotopic, intratracheal, intralesional, percutaneous, endoscopical, transmucosal, sublingual and intestinal administration.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for use in the compositions of the present invention are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and are selected based upon a number of factors: the particular antitumor compound used, and its concentration, stability and intended bioavailability; the disease, disorder or condition being treated with the composition; the subject, its age, size and general condition; and the route of administration. Suitable earners are readily detennined by one of ordinary skill in the art (see, for example, J. G. Nairn, in: Remington"s Pharmaceutical Science (A. Gennaro, ed.).

These components will for the most part Impart properties which enhance retention of the antitumor compound at the site of administration, protect the stability of the composition, control the pH. facilitate processing of the antitumor compound into pharmaceutical formulations, and the like. Preferably, each of these components is individually present in less than about 15 weight % of the total composition, more preferably less than about 5 weight %, and most preferably less than about 0.5 weight % of the total composition. Some components, such as fillers or diluents, can constitute up to 90 vrt.% of the total composition, as is well known in the formulation art.

While not being bound to a particular theory, it is believed that the ethanol solubility of the antitumor compound may be directly related to its efficacy. The antitumor compound can also be capable of being crystallized from a solution.
