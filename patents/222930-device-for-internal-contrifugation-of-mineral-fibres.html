				<td>PRQCFSS AND DEVICE FOR FORMATION<br>
OF MINERAL WOOL<br>
The invention relates to techniques for formation of mineral fibers or other<br>
thermoplastic materials through the process of internal centrifugation combined with<br>
drawing by a gaseous current at high temperature. It applies in particular to the<br>
industrial production of glass wool intended to be used, for example, in the<br>
composition of thermal and/or acoustic insulation products.<br>
The fiber-formation process to which the invention relates consists of feeding a<br>
thin stream of molten glass to a centrifuge, also called a fiberization spinner, turning<br>
at high speed and perforated on its periphery by a very large number of orifices<br>
through which glass is sprayed in the form of filaments under the action of centrifugal<br>
force. These filaments are then subjected to the action of a high-temperature and<br>
high-speed annular drawing current along the wall of the centrifuge. This current<br>
thins them down and transforms them into fibers. The fibers formed are carried along<br>
by this gaseous drawing current towards a receiving mechanism generally consisting<br>
of a gas-permeable strip. This process is known as "internal centrifugation."<br>
This process has undergone several improvements, some of them relating in<br>
particular to the fiberization spinner, others to the means of generating the annular<br>
drawing current, using a specific type of burner, for example. See in particular EP-B-<br>
0 189 354; EP-B-0 519,797; WO 97/15532 concerning this last point.<br>
Concerning the fiberization spinner, patent FR 1,382,917 (application February<br>
27, 1963) describes a fiberization device whose principle is still widely used: the<br>
molten material is led to a basket whose vertical wall contains orifices through which<br>
the material is sprayed onto the wall of a turning body, attached to the basket, and<br>
contains a great many orifices. This wall is called the "band" of the fiberization<br>
spinner. In order to obtain good quality fiberization the orifices are distributed in<br>
annular rows and the diameters of the orifices vary according to the row to which they<br>
belong, with this diameter decreasing from the top of the band to the bottom.<br><br>
In the context of the invention, the "top" of the centrifuge is defined in reference<br>
to the centrifuge in centrifugation position, i.e. according to a substantially vertical axis<br>
(of rotation).<br>
Improvements have been made to this basic principle, as shown in particular in<br>
patent FR 2,443,436 where mechanisms make it possible to obtain a laminar flow of<br>
the molten material from the top to the bottom of the spinner band.<br>
Thus the goal of the invention is to improve the device and the process of<br>
fiberization through internal centrifugation of mineral fibers. This improvement<br>
focuses in particular on the quality of the fibers obtained and on an increase in the<br>
yield of the process.<br>
First, the object of the invention is a device for internal centrifugation of mineral<br>
fibers including of a centrifuge equipped with a peripheral band perforated with<br>
orifices distributed over a plurality of annular zones arranged on top of each other<br>
(assuming that the centrifuge is in centrifugation position) which includes at least two<br>
annular zones where the number of orifices per unit of surface area (NS) differs by an<br>
amount greater than or equal to 5%, in particular greater than or equal to 10%, and<br>
even 20%.<br>
In a preferred method of realizing the invention, the annular zone containing<br>
the greatest number of orifices per unit of surface area is located below another<br>
annular zone containing a lower average number of orifices per unit of surface area,<br>
assuming that the centrifuge is in fiberization position.<br>
The term "annular zone" is used to define a zone of the band of the centrifuge<br>
contained between two perpendicular planes of the axis (of rotation) of the centrifuge.<br>
In the context of the invention, such an annular zone is defined as a region where the<br>
number of orifices per unit or surface area is substantially constant over the entire<br>
part of the periphery of the band contained in the said annular zone.<br>
The number of orifices per unit of surface area, NS, is defined as the number<br>
of orifices contained in an element of the surface of the annular zone, in particular on<br>
the order of a square centimeter, in relation to the surface area of this element of the<br>
surface. The number of orifices per unit of surface area is considered to be<br>
substantially constant if it varies by less than 0.5% over all of the elements of surface<br>
of a single annular zone. An annular zone may include a single orifice per vertical<br><br>
segment, but it usually contains several of them, in particular from 4 to 15. The term<br>
"vertical segment" refers to a part of the annular zone limited on the vertical axis by<br>
each of the planes defined above, as long as an average of only one orifice on a<br>
horizontal axis is observed there, assuming that the centrifuge is in fiberization<br>
position.<br>
Mineral fibers are conventionally manufactured with a centrifuge where the<br>
number of orifices per unit of surface area is constant over the entire height of the<br>
centrifuge band. In fact, a conventional centrifuge is perforated through electrical<br>
discharge machining, with a comb composed of electrodes distributed in line where<br>
the pitch between electrodes is constant. After simultaneous perforation of orifices in<br>
a vertical column, the comb is moved to carry out the perforation of the next column,<br>
after moving the comb along the band by a distance corresponding to the horizontal<br>
gap between the center of consecutive holes.<br>
This technique permits very precise perforation and the variations in the<br>
number of orifices per unit of surface area are extremely low, specifically less than 1<br>
per one thousand.<br>
A conventional centrifuge generally contains between 2000 and 40,000<br>
orifices, specifically for average diameters of the centrifuge of 200 mm to 800 mm,<br>
respectively.<br>
It has proven to be possible to increase significantly the quality of the fiber mat,<br>
in particular its mechanical properties, while obtaining a very significant reduction in<br>
the consumption of energy, and thus the yield of the fiberization process, using a<br>
device prepared according to the invention.<br>
This effect is especially notable in that, at constant pull rate, it is known that<br>
energy consumption decreases when the number of orifices for the same band height<br>
increases, because the more the molten material is divided, the less energy is<br>
required to draw it. When the number of orifices is increased for the same band<br>
height with a conventional centrifuge, however, the quality of the fiber mats produced<br>
does not increase, and even tends to decrease, while with the device prepared<br>
according to the invention it is possible to improve the properties of the products and<br>
the yield of the process at the same time.<br><br>
Recall that in the text, reference was made to a centrifuge observed in the<br>
position of centrifugation, i.e. with the band, including the orifices, arranged in a<br>
substantially vertical manner, around the axis along which the molten material is<br>
carried during fiberization. The molten material is carried through the "top" of the<br>
centrifuge in this position. The base of the centrifuge is substantially horizontal and<br>
the annular zones are parallel to this base and are superimposed on each other in<br>
this arrangement.<br>
A centrifuge according to the invention contains at least two superimposed<br>
annular zones, the lower one having a greater number of orifices per unit of surface<br>
area than the one located above it. In a preferred method of realization the centrifuge<br>
includes at least three superimposed annular zones and each of these zones includes<br>
a greater number of orifices per unit of surface area than the one in the closest<br>
annular zone located above the annular zone considered.<br>
According to a preferred method of realization the orifices of each zone are<br>
grouped in rows, with a diameter of orifice (d) substantially constant in each annular<br>
zone and decreasing from one annular zone to another, from the top to the bottom of<br>
the peripheral band of the centrifuge in centrifugation position.<br>
In the invention, it is also advantageous that at least two adjacent rows have<br>
orifices of different diameters, and more specifically, that the rows have, from the top<br>
to the bottom of the peripheral band, decreasing diameters of orifices (generally all<br>
orifices of a single row have the same diameter). Thus one can anticipate, from the<br>
top to the bottom, n row(s) of orifices of a given diameter, then p row(s) or orifices of a<br>
smaller diameter, then t row(s) of orifices of a still smaller diameter, etc. with n, p<br>
and t&gt; 1.<br>
For example, one could have a first annular zone, ZA1, consisting of n rows, a<br>
second, ZA2, consisting of p rows, and a third, ZA3, consisting of t rows.<br>
By thus establishing a sort of decreasing "gradient" in the size of orifices from<br>
top to bottom, an improvement in the quality of fiberization has been observed. Thus<br>
it has been possible to reduce the differences in the way in which filaments coming<br>
from the highest rows were fiberized in relation to those from the lowest: this<br>
"gradient" permits a development of primary filaments exiting the orifices and a<br>
drawing process that limits crossing of trajectories, and thus impact, between the<br><br>
fibers being drawn from different rows of orifices, hence the improved quality<br>
observed.<br>
This configuration is especially adapted to the production of less dense mineral<br>
wools.<br>
In certain cases, on the other hand, one wants to encourage impact between<br>
fibers in order to reduce their length. These cases correspond to the production of<br>
dense mineral wools, particularly suitable for panels used in roofing. In these cases<br>
one could, for example, alternate the size of the orifices from one zone to another,<br>
and one can thus anticipate, from the top to the bottom, n row(s) of orifices of a given<br>
diameter, then p row(s) of orifices of a greater diameter, then t row(s) of orifices of a<br>
diameter smaller than those of the orifices of the row located above, etc.<br>
It would be advantageous to have the rows spaced apart from each other by a<br>
distance between 1 and 2 mm, in particular from 1.2 to 1.8 mm, with preferably a<br>
pitch from one row to another of 1 to 2 mm, for example 1.2 to 1.6.<br>
Preferably, the diameter (d) of at least a part of the orifices of the centrifuge is<br>
at the most 1.5 or 1.2 mm, in particular from 1.1 to 0.5 mm, for example between 0.9<br>
and 0.7 mm.<br>
According to another method of realization of the device according to the<br>
invention, the distance, D, between the centers of the neighboring orifices closest to a<br>
single annular zone is substantially constant over all of a single annular zone and this<br>
distance, D, varies from one zone to another by at least 3%, or even at least 5% and<br>
even 10% or more, and decreases from top to bottom, assuming that the centrifuge is<br>
in fiberization position.<br>
Preferably the distance, D, is between 0.8 and 3 mm, for example between 1<br>
and 2 mm and even between 1.4 and 1.8 mm.<br>
It would be advantageous that the centrifuge according to the invention be<br>
chosen with an average diameter, DM, less than or equal to 800 mm, in particular at<br>
least 200 mm.<br>
The centrifuge is preferably devoided of a bottom in its lowest part (opposite<br>
part of the top of the centrifuge as defined above).<br><br>
According to this method of realization, the centrifuge is jointed with a basket in<br>
which the molten glass spreads, preferably joined by mechanical assembling. The<br>
basket rotates at the same rotation speed than the centrifuge.<br>
According to a preferred method of realization, the device according to the<br>
invention includes at least one mechanism of generating a high-temperature gaseous<br>
drawing jet in the form of an annular burner, in particular as described in the patents<br>
EP 0 189 354 and EP 0 519 797 by the applicant.<br>
It would be advantageous that the annular burner be a tangential burner which<br>
includes a mechanism of giving the gaseous drawing jet a tangential component in<br>
relation to the outer horizontal edge of the centrifuge, in particular as described in<br>
patent EP 0 189 354 by the applicant.<br>
Thus it is possible to obtain an inclination angle of the gaseous drawing jet in<br>
relation to the axis of the burner.<br>
It is also possible to use a heating mechanism "internal" to the centrifuge, of<br>
the internal burner type. This may play different roles, in particular terminating the<br>
thermal conditioning of the molten glass in the "basket" of the centrifuge (term<br>
explained below, using the figures), maintaining at an appropriate temperature the<br>
glass reserve in the centrifuge in order to continuously remelt the fibers which are<br>
susceptible to adhering to the external walls of the centrifuge.<br>
It may be advantageous to combine the "external" heating method, of the<br>
annular inductor type, with this internal heating method; this also permits better<br>
control of the temperature of the glass reserve and the remelting of the adhered<br>
fibers. In fact, it has been observed that, generally, at low pull rates it was sufficient<br>
simply to have recourse to an internal burner, while at high pull rates, the annular<br>
inductor proved to be necessary, and the possible addition of the internal burner is<br>
beneficial.<br>
The object of the invention is a process of formation of mineral fibers by<br>
internal centrifugation, combined with gaseous drawing at high temperature, in<br>
particular implementing the device above. The material to be fiberized is emptied into<br>
a centrifuge whose peripheral band is perforated with orifices distributed over a<br>
plurality of annular zones arranged on top of each other, assuming that the centrifuge<br>
is in the centrifugation position; it includes at least two annular zones, ZA1 and ZA2,<br><br>
whose number of orifices per unit of surface area NS1, NS2, differs by a value greater<br>
than or equal to 5%, in particular greater than or equal to 10% and even 20%, and the<br>
annular zones containing the greatest number of orifices per unit of surface area is<br>
located below the other annular zone, assuming that the centrifuge is in fiberization<br>
position.<br>
It is advantageous that the centrifuge be the one whose characteristics are<br>
described above.<br>
It is advantageous that the hot gaseous drawing be accomplished by an<br>
annular burner whose parameters of operation may be selected as follows:<br>
- preferably, it is possible to regulate the temperature of the gases leaving the<br>
burner to at least 1350°C, in particular at least 1400°C and, for example, between<br>
1400 and 1500°C, in particular between 1430 and 1470°C. The temperature is then<br>
adjusted according to the type of composition of the mineral fibers, in particular<br>
according to its viscosimetric behavior,<br>
- it is advantageous to regulate the speed of the gases exiting the burner to at<br>
least 200 m/s, measured just at the exit of the lips of the burner, in particular at values<br>
between 200 and 295 m/s,<br>
- finally, it is preferable to regulate the annular width of the gases exiting the<br>
burner to values between 5 mm and 9 mm.<br>
When the process of the invention has recourse to a means of harnessing the<br>
hot drawing gases and/or the material released from the orifices of the centrifuge<br>
under the effect of centrifugal force, it is advantageous that the means be a gas<br>
blowing collar which is at ambient temperature at most, and at a feed gas pressure<br>
between 0.5 and 2.5.105 Pa, in particular 0.7 to 2.10-5 Pa.<br>
One can have recourse to an inductor to heat the lowest zone of the centrifuge<br>
and avoid or limit the creation of a temperature gradient over the height of the<br>
centrifuge.<br>
Another object of the invention is the use of mineral fibers obtained by the<br>
device and/or the process described above to manufacture thermal and/or insulation<br>
products.<br>
The invention will be detailed below using non-restrictive examples illustrated<br>
by the following figures:<br>
8<br>
? Figure 1: a partial view of the centrifugation device according to the<br>
invention,<br>
? Figure 2: a partial view of the centrifuge according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 thus represents a partial view of a system of internal centrifugation<br>
using hot gas drawing adapted based on those known from prior art and described, in<br>
particular, in patents EP 91 866, EP 189 354 and EP 519 797, which can be referred<br>
to for more details on the general aspects of this method of fiberization.<br>
The system includes a centrifuge 1 attached to a shaft 2. The shaft and the<br>
centrifuge are animated by a movement of rapid rotation using an engine not pictured.<br>
The shaft 2 is hollow and the glass in the molten state flows from the feeding<br>
mechanism not represented in shaft 2 up to the "basket" 3 in which the molten glass<br>
spreads. The basket 3 is also carried along by rotation such that the molten glass is<br>
sprayed onto the peripheral wall 4 which is perforated with orifices and, from there, in<br>
the form of voluminous threads 6 on the peripheral wall 7, usually named "band" of<br>
the centrifuge 1, which will form on this wall a permanent reserve of molten glass to<br>
supply the circular orifices 14 perforated into said wall. This wall 7 is inclined by<br>
about 5 to 10° in relation to the vertical. Of very many circular orifices 14 arranged in<br>
rows, are coming out the flow cones 8 extending into pre-fibers 15, projected into the<br>
annular gaseous current emitted from the burner 9. Under the effect of this current,<br>
these pre-fibers stretch, their terminal portion generating discontinuous fibers 10<br>
which are then collected under the centrifuge. The system also contains a blowing<br>
column 11 which creates a "cloud of gas" surrounding the annular gas current<br>
generated by the burner 9. There is also an option to use an induction current 12<br>
under the centrifuge 1 and/or an internal burner not pictured.<br>
Under the standard conditions, the gap between the lines passing through the<br>
center of two parallel rows of orifices, termed the pitch, is constant over the entire<br>
height of the band. Under these conditions, the distance between the centers of<br>
neighboring orifices in the same row is also constant.<br>
Thus, in a standard centrifuge, the number of orifices per unit of surface area is<br>
constant over the entire surface of the band.<br>
Under standard operating conditions, such a device permits obtaining fibers of<br>
an average diameter of at least 2 µm, particularly about 3 to 12 µm.<br><br>
Thus the invention consisted of optimizing the fiberization process by<br>
modifying the distribution of orifices on the band 7 of the centrifuge.<br>
The most significant adaptation made in the context of the invention appears<br>
on figure 2.<br>
Figure 2 represents a partial frontal view of the band 7 of the centrifuge 1,<br>
where the orifices 14 perforated in said band are shaded.<br>
In this figure are pictured the two superimposed annular zones ZA1 and ZA2,<br>
ZA2 being below ZA1 when the device is viewed in fiberization position. In the case<br>
pictured, each of these annular zones includes three circular rows of orifices 14. In<br>
the annular zone ZA1 the rows present a pitch P1, the orifices a diameter d1, the<br>
distance D1 separates the centers of the closest orifices 14, the distance between the<br>
closest edges of neighboring orifices is DB1, and the number of orifices per unit of<br>
surface area is NS1 in the zone ZA1. In the annular zone ZA2, these parameters are<br>
respectively P2, d2, D2, DB2, and NS2.<br>
The pitch between ZA1 and ZA2 is called P1/2.<br>
Note on one hand that d2 is less than d1, and that P2 and D2 are, respectively,<br>
less than P1 and D1. As a result, NS2 is very much greater than NS1.<br>
This representation is in no way restrictive and a band 7 of a centrifuge 1 may<br>
contain more than two annular zones, each of said zones containing at least one<br>
series of orifices 14.<br>
In order to illustrate the value of the centrifuge according to the invention,<br>
comparative testing was performed, with, on one hand, a standard centrifuge, and on<br>
the other hand, a centrifuge according to the invention. The characteristics of the two<br>
centrifuges which were selected to have the same average diameter, DM, and the<br>
same band surface area, and an identical height of perforated band, are presented in<br>
table 1. Each of these centrifuges includes three annular zones each consisting of<br>
several rows of orifices of constant diameter and spacing in a row.<br>
The number of orifices per row is noted as NO, and the number of orifices per<br>
unit of surface area, NS, is calculated as follows: NS = NO/(p.D.P). It is expressed<br>
here in number of orifices per mm2.<br>
Note that the number of orifices per unit of surface area is constant for the<br>
standard centrifuge. In the case of the centrifuge according to the invention, it varies<br><br>
by annular zone and this number, NS, is lower than the one of the standard centrifuge<br>
for the highest annular zone, ZA1, and then higher than that of the standard<br>
centrifuge for the other annular zones, ZA2 and ZA3. Note that for the centrifuge<br>
according to the invention, the number of orifices per unit of surface area increases<br>
with the zone, from the top to the bottom of the centrifuge, by about 25 to 30% from<br>
one zone to another.<br>
The two centrifuges were manufactured from the same alloy, known under the<br>
reference SG30, produced in particular by the company SEVA. The standard<br>
centrifuge was perforated using the electroerosion technique described above, while<br>
the orifices of the centrifuge according to the invention were perforated using electron<br>
bombardment. Laser perforation could also be considered.<br>
Products were manufactured with each of the centrifuges under equivalent pull<br>
conditions.<br>
The types of products manufactured, the conditions of fiberization and the<br>
mechanical properties measured on the products obtained are reported in table 2.<br>
The fineness of the fibers is determined by the value of their micronaire (F)<br>
under 5 g. The measurement of micronaire, also called "fineness index," takes into<br>
account the specific surface area by measuring the loss in aerodynamic load when a<br>
given quantity of fibers extracted from a non-sized mat is subjected to a given<br>
pressure of a gas - generally air or nitrogen. This measurement is normal in mineral<br>
fiber production units, it is standardized (DIN 53941 or ASTM D 1448) for measuring<br>
cotton fibers and it uses a device called "micronaire device." In the present examples,<br>
one makes sure that the fineness of the products is the same, that is, in the present<br>
case, that the flow (in l/mn) is the same.<br>
The products obtained are of the same type, that is, of the same nominal<br>
thickness, the same density. To obtain them, the same burner was used, in this case<br>
a tangential burner, with an incline of the gas jet of about 10°. The baskets used are<br>
of the same geometry. Burner pressure is in mmCE (mm colonne d'Eau = mm of<br>
water).<br>
These products are all impregnated with the same formophenolic binder, with<br>
4.7% binder in relation to the weight of the fibers.<br><br>
The energy necessary to obtain products of the same type is compared, that<br>
is, in particular, the quantity of air and of gas supplied for combustion (output in Nm3/h<br>
: Normo Cubic meter per hour).<br>
The properties measured on products of the same type with each centrifuge<br>
are also compared.<br>
The thickness recovery is defined as the ratio (in %) between the thickness<br>
after compression test and the nominal thickness. It must be noted that the thickness<br>
of the product manufactured before compression testing is greater than the nominal<br>
thickness. In the case of the tests mentioned, the thickness of the product<br>
manufactured is 144 mm for a nominal thickness of 80 mm.<br>
From table 2 it can be deduced that the thickness of the fiber mat unloaded<br>
after 12 days of compression testing is about 90% of the original thickness<br>
(manufacturing thickness) of the fiber mat with the centrifuge according to the<br>
invention, and about 80% of the initial thickness with a standard centrifuge.<br>
To conduct the compression test above, panels of fiber mat are prepared after<br>
manufacture and loaded to obtain a compression rate of 8/1, i.e. in the case<br>
mentioned a compressed thickness of about 18 mm. After the compression time<br>
specified (12 days, 1 month), the panels are unloaded (4 panels are tested per<br>
compression time) and the average thickness after compression test is determined.<br>
The tensile strength is determined based on a test specimen in the form of ring<br>
cut with a punch in a mat of fibrous product. The "tensile strength" is expressed as<br>
the limit of the tensile force (breaking force of the ring torn out by two circular and<br>
parallel mandrels 12.5 mm in radius, with a load speed of 300 mm/min) in relation to<br>
the mass of the test specimen and is expressed in gf/g.<br>
The test specimen, loaded at the start of the test, is a substantially elliptical<br>
toric ring of 122 x 76 mm long and short axes and 26 mm thickness of torr. 15<br>
specimens are tested by product. This test refers to norms BIFT 5012-76 and ASTM<br>
C 681-76.<br>
The tensile strength is measured on the product after manufacture and, in<br>
order to estimate the product's capacity for aging, after an autoclave test. The<br>
duration of the autoclave test is 15 minutes, at a temperature of 107°C, a pressure of<br>
0.8 bar and humidity of 100%.<br><br>
From table 2 it may be observed that for a product of the same type, sharply<br>
improved mechanical properties are obtained with the device according to the<br>
invention compared to the standard device and at the same time, the energy needed<br>
to produce the fibers is significantly reduced.<br>
In fact, the pressure of the burner is lower, about 20% less with the centrifuge<br>
according to the invention compared to the results with the standard centrifuge. At<br>
the same time, the outputs of fluid, air and gas are relatively smaller, by about 10%.<br>
The energy yield of the process is thus very advantageously increased with the<br>
centrifuge according to the invention.<br>
The improvement in mechanical properties relates both to the thickness<br>
recovery, which is about 10% greater with the centrifuge according to the invention<br>
compared to products obtained with a standard centrifuge, and also the tensile<br>
strength, which is improved by about 20%.<br>
In addition from these remarkable results, it was noted that, unexpectedly, the<br>
increase in the number of orifices of the centrifuge does not have a negative effect on<br>
the life span of the centrifuge, when the latter is made according to the instructions of<br>
the invention.<br>
Under the fiberization conditions defined in table 2, the life span of the<br>
centrifuge according to the invention was about 370 hours and that of the standard<br>
centrifuge was about 300 hours.<br>
In the same way, it is noted that the quality of the products does not vary<br>
significantly with the time of use in fiberization of a spinner, although it might have<br>
been feared that the increase in the number of holes per unit of surface area may<br>
lead to accelerated aging of the centrifuge accompanied by a rapid deterioration in<br>
the properties of the product during fiberization with the same spinner.<br>
It is noted that the configuration described for the centrifuge according to the<br>
invention in table 1 is especially advantageous from a geometric point of view. In<br>
fact, while increasing the number of orifices in the centrifuge, the inventors were able<br>
to define a geometric configuration where the space between the edges of the<br>
orifices, DB1, is increased in relation to that of the standard centrifuge in the annular<br>
zone, ZA1, where the orifices have the largest diameter, D1, and where corrosion and<br>
erosion are the most active. In the median annular zone, ZA2, the space between<br><br>
edges of orifices, DB2, is identical in both configurations, and in the annular zone,<br>
ZA3, with the smallest diameter, D3, the configuration chosen permits decreasing the<br>
distance between edges of orifices, DB3, which is not harmful because corrosion and<br>
erosion are not as great there. Thus, very advantageously, the mechanical properties<br>
of the centrifuge according to the invention are preserved, and its life span can be<br>
maintained or increased compared to a standard centrifuge, while considerably<br>
increasing the number of orifices.<br>
The invention is not limited to these types of realizations and must be<br>
interpreted in a non-restrictive manner, encompassing any device for internal<br>
centrifugation of mineral fibers which contains a centrifuge equipped with a peripheral<br>
band perforated with orifices distributed in a plurality of annular zones arranged on<br>
